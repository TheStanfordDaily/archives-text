# ExCommittee May Revise Honor Code
## Members to Sound Faculty, Students On Code Validity 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Ex Committee last night laid down
the keel for a sweeping investigation
and possible revision of Stanford's
famous Honor Code system.
That students may not be allowed
to take exams outside of classrooms
is the action which may become ef
fective, following closely on the heels
of recent faculty protests against
violations.
Each member of Excom will con
fer with certain faculty members
during the coming week and report
at a special meeting next Tuesday
at 4:30 o'clock. Excom will later
present their findings in a body to
President Ray Lyman Wilbur that
night at his home.
CHEATING?
"Just how much cheating there
really has been," in the words of
Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president,
"and the suggestions to solve the
problem, will be ascertained during
the week." Following the discussion
next Tuesday, which will probe the
"student angle," an Excom-faculty
meeting will be held for further
discussion.
Other business of the committor
follows:
MEN'S NOM-COM: A proposal to
replace men's Hall and Row elec
tion caucuses with a Men's Nomi
nating Committee was presented by
Jessup, on the suggestion of Norm
Ross, '43.
(See page 4 for editorial dis
cussion: "Dump Caucuses?"
"I'm all for doing away with cau
cuses—l think they are horrible—
but I don't think you can," Pat Ad
ams told the committee. Ned Pugh
opined that a Nom-Com "would
amount to the same thing we have
been having."
TRACK LETTERS: Requirements
for varsity letter awards in track
were changed to require 7 points
out of six meets. This would mean
a minimum of five third places and
a second place.
STANFORD LITERARY MAGA
ZINE: Clarence Burley presented
plans for a proposed monthly liter
ary magazine. Dwight Hutchinson
pointed out that the local market is
"saturated with advertising media,"
while Pat Adams observed the mag
aizne has "great possibilities."
"It is a real need; I hate to think
Stanford will support only some-
thing like Chappie," declared Anne
Townsend, A.S.S.U. vice-president.
The proposition will go to Pub
lications Council for consideration.
DRAMATICS REVISION
DRAMATIC COUNCIL CONSTI
TUTION: Changes were read by Bob
Rich, dramatic manager, and ap
proved by Excom.
Probably the most profound state
ment of the evening was Rich's ob
servation that "Most of these con
stitutions are a big bunch of weasle
words."
SOCIAL PROBLEM
MOFFATT FIELD MEN: Mrs.
Morris of the Stanford Mothers' Club
told of the new population at Mof
fatt Field and the "consequent rela
tions involving the civilian and
military populations." She pointed
out there are 2,600 men stationed
there and that 1000 more are ex
pected.
"That number of men cannot be
ignored," Mrs. Morris warned, as
the result of what she described as
a "go-see" project. "The third day
after pay day there were men who
hadn't any money," she added.
"Mountain View offers 15 saloons,
and they may even get as far as
Palo Alto."
BULL SNARED
It was suggested that a league be
added to Scabbard and Blade, cam
pus military organization, to aid
Moffatt Field recreation, and Mrs.
Morris expressed the hope that
"some person with his ear to the
ground" would be appointed. Charlie
Bull will investigate and report.

the keel for a sweeping investigation
and possible revision of Stanford's
famous Honor Code system.
That students may not be allowed
to take exams outside of classrooms
is the action which may become ef
fective, following closely on the heels
of recent faculty protests against
violations.
Each member of Excom will con
fer with certain faculty members
during the coming week and report
at a special meeting next Tuesday
at 4:30 o'clock. Excom will later
present their findings in a body to
President Ray Lyman Wilbur that
night at his home.
CHEATING?
"Just how much cheating there
really has been," in the words of
Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president,
"and the suggestions to solve the
problem, will be ascertained during
the week." Following the discussion
next Tuesday, which will probe the
"student angle," an Excom-faculty
meeting will be held for further
discussion.
Other business of the committor
follows:
MEN'S NOM-COM: A proposal to
replace men's Hall and Row elec
tion caucuses with a Men's Nomi
nating Committee was presented by
Jessup, on the suggestion of Norm
Ross, '43.
(See page 4 for editorial dis
cussion: "Dump Caucuses?"
"I'm all for doing away with cau
cuses—l think they are horrible—
but I don't think you can," Pat Ad
ams told the committee. Ned Pugh
opined that a Nom-Com "would
amount to the same thing we have
been having."
TRACK LETTERS: Requirements
for varsity letter awards in track
were changed to require 7 points
out of six meets. This would mean
a minimum of five third places and
a second place.
STANFORD LITERARY MAGA
ZINE: Clarence Burley presented
plans for a proposed monthly liter
ary magazine. Dwight Hutchinson
pointed out that the local market is
"saturated with advertising media,"
while Pat Adams observed the mag
aizne has "great possibilities."
"It is a real need; I hate to think
Stanford will support only some-
thing like Chappie," declared Anne
Townsend, A.S.S.U. vice-president.
The proposition will go to Pub
lications Council for consideration.
DRAMATICS REVISION
DRAMATIC COUNCIL CONSTI
TUTION: Changes were read by Bob
Rich, dramatic manager, and ap
proved by Excom.
Probably the most profound state
ment of the evening was Rich's ob
servation that "Most of these con
stitutions are a big bunch of weasle
words."
SOCIAL PROBLEM
MOFFATT FIELD MEN: Mrs.
Morris of the Stanford Mothers' Club
told of the new population at Mof
fatt Field and the "consequent rela
tions involving the civilian and
military populations." She pointed
out there are 2,600 men stationed
there and that 1000 more are ex
pected.
"That number of men cannot be
ignored," Mrs. Morris warned, as
the result of what she described as
a "go-see" project. "The third day
after pay day there were men who
hadn't any money," she added.
"Mountain View offers 15 saloons,
and they may even get as far as
Palo Alto."
BULL SNARED
It was suggested that a league be
added to Scabbard and Blade, cam
pus military organization, to aid
Moffatt Field recreation, and Mrs.
Morris expressed the hope that
"some person with his ear to the
ground" would be appointed. Charlie
Bull will investigate and report.

famous Honor Code system.
That students may not be allowed
to take exams outside of classrooms
is the action which may become ef
fective, following closely on the heels
of recent faculty protests against
violations.
Each member of Excom will con
fer with certain faculty members
during the coming week and report
at a special meeting next Tuesday
at 4:30 o'clock. Excom will later
present their findings in a body to
President Ray Lyman Wilbur that
night at his home.
CHEATING?
"Just how much cheating there
really has been," in the words of
Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president,
"and the suggestions to solve the
problem, will be ascertained during
the week." Following the discussion
next Tuesday, which will probe the
"student angle," an Excom-faculty
meeting will be held for further
discussion.
Other business of the committor
follows:
MEN'S NOM-COM: A proposal to
replace men's Hall and Row elec
tion caucuses with a Men's Nomi
nating Committee was presented by
Jessup, on the suggestion of Norm
Ross, '43.
(See page 4 for editorial dis
cussion: "Dump Caucuses?"
"I'm all for doing away with cau
cuses—l think they are horrible—
but I don't think you can," Pat Ad
ams told the committee. Ned Pugh
opined that a Nom-Com "would
amount to the same thing we have
been having."
TRACK LETTERS: Requirements
for varsity letter awards in track
were changed to require 7 points
out of six meets. This would mean
a minimum of five third places and
a second place.
STANFORD LITERARY MAGA
ZINE: Clarence Burley presented
plans for a proposed monthly liter
ary magazine. Dwight Hutchinson
pointed out that the local market is
"saturated with advertising media,"
while Pat Adams observed the mag
aizne has "great possibilities."
"It is a real need; I hate to think
Stanford will support only some-
thing like Chappie," declared Anne
Townsend, A.S.S.U. vice-president.
The proposition will go to Pub
lications Council for consideration.
DRAMATICS REVISION
DRAMATIC COUNCIL CONSTI
TUTION: Changes were read by Bob
Rich, dramatic manager, and ap
proved by Excom.
Probably the most profound state
ment of the evening was Rich's ob
servation that "Most of these con
stitutions are a big bunch of weasle
words."
SOCIAL PROBLEM
MOFFATT FIELD MEN: Mrs.
Morris of the Stanford Mothers' Club
told of the new population at Mof
fatt Field and the "consequent rela
tions involving the civilian and
military populations." She pointed
out there are 2,600 men stationed
there and that 1000 more are ex
pected.
"That number of men cannot be
ignored," Mrs. Morris warned, as
the result of what she described as
a "go-see" project. "The third day
after pay day there were men who
hadn't any money," she added.
"Mountain View offers 15 saloons,
and they may even get as far as
Palo Alto."
BULL SNARED
It was suggested that a league be
added to Scabbard and Blade, cam
pus military organization, to aid
Moffatt Field recreation, and Mrs.
Morris expressed the hope that
"some person with his ear to the
ground" would be appointed. Charlie
Bull will investigate and report.
