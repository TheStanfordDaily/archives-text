# ExCommittee May Revise Honor Code
## Members to Sound Faculty, Students On Code Validity 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Ex Committee last night laid down
the keel for a sweeping investigation
and possible revision of Stanford's
famous Honor Code system.
That students may not be allowed
to take exams outside of classrooms

of recent faculty protests against

Each member of Excom will con

at a special meeting next Tuesday
at 4:30 o'clock. Excom will later
present their findings in a body to

"I'm all for doing away with cau
cuses—l think they are horrible—
but I don't think you can," Pat Ad
ams told the committee. Ned Pugh
opined that a Nom-Com "would
amount to the same thing we have
been having."
TRACK LETTERS: Requirements
for varsity letter awards in track
were changed to require 7 points
out of six meets. This would mean
a minimum of five third places and
a second place.
STANFORD LITERARY MAGA
ZINE: Clarence Burley presented
plans for a proposed monthly liter
ary magazine. Dwight Hutchinson
pointed out that the local market is
"saturated with advertising media,"
while Pat Adams observed the mag
aizne has "great possibilities."
"It is a real need; I hate to think
