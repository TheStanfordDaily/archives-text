## Vandenberg, Nye Lead Opposition, Say Bill Would Make FDR 'Dictator' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. IS (UP). —Senate Republicans today publicly re
buked Wendell L. Willkie for supporting' the British Aid Bill which they
said would make President Roosevelt the "dictator"' of the United States
and the "No. 1 power politician of the world."
Pot shots at the 1!M0 Republican Presidential candidate were taken by

Senators Arthur 11. Vandenberg, R.,
Mich., and Gerald P. Nye, R., N.D.,
two of the three opposition leaders
who spoke during the second day of
debate on the historic measure.
Vandenberg, unsuccessful candi
date for the 1940 nomination, re
ferred to Willkie as the President's
"Clipper ambassador." Nye called
him "that great expert on European
affairs."
MINORITY REPORT
A minority report of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, of
fered by Senator Hiram Johnson, R.,
Calif., who backed Willkie for the
presidency, said his testimony before
the committee in support of the bill
was a "one-man circus intended to
influence the citizens."
Other developments included:
President Roosevelt appointed
Averill Harriman, New York linan
ic r, as special defense "expediter"
to handle work on the lend-lease
program in London. The President
said Harriman would serve as a
liaison officer to keep the British ap
prised of the production situation in
the United States and this country
advised of Britain's war needs.
IN TEN DAYS
Mr. Roosevelt reported that he
hoped to have administrative details
of the all-out program completed
tentatively in ten days or two weeks.
He outlined government efforts to
provide assurance against delay in
supplying British assistance after
Congress was disposed of the bill.
Secretary of Commerce Jesse Jones
told the House Banking Committee
that the United States is "in the war,
or at least nearly in it," and "is pre
paring for it." The remark, made
while Jones was defending an ad
ministration proposal to permit the
Federal Housing Administration to
insure defense housing mortgages
up to $100,000,000, was stricken from
the committee record on Jones' re
quest.
Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of
Naval Operations, indicated after a
White House visit that the possibility
of additional naval vessels being
transferred to Britain is kept alive
by the flow of world events.
