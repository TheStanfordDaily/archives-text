# What Won't These Women Think of Next
## 
### BOB HANNAH 
The officers, students, and stable
men over at the R.O.T.C. stables are
feeling a little nervous these days.
For their freedom of action and
speech (mostly speech) has been
hampered by the presence of two
charming young ladies, Patricia Law
and Janice Hyatt.
This one-time habitat of males is
invaded on Tuesdays and Thurs
days by these women who are so
interested in horses that they take
a regular course dealing with the
animals, known by laymen as Mili
tary Science 5, but by the initiated
as "hippology."
Pat, who is a Roble freshman and
resident of Menlo Park, is thinking
of buying a horse and wants to
make sure of what she gets.
Nothing is more apropos than
hippology, which tells all about con
firmation. And confirmation tells all
about the establishment of a horse's
age, value, and breed.
Janice, an Alpha Omicron Pi jun
ior, takes the course for a number
of reasons: her love of horses, her
ability to play an outstanding game
of polo, and the fact that she "heard
it was a good course."
So the cadets are having one
rough old time.
But they say the horses love it.
California's 1940 bean crop is esti
mated at 5,492,000 hundred-pound
bags.
