## Stefansson Pictures U.S.-Russ Relations For Weekly Series

Picturing relations in the North
between the United States and the
Soviet Union and explaining how
that northern frontier can be de
fended against an invading mech
anized army, Dr. Vilhjalmur Stef
ansson, noted explorer and authority
on Polar living conditions, spoke
for the Tuesday Evening Series last
night.
"Russia is our third nearest
neighbor," he explained, "and it is
only three miles away from Little
Diamede Island in Alaska."
He expressed the hopes and fears
of the people living in Alaska by
telling how much they dread the
false or exaggerated statements
made in American newspapers and
how much they look forward to
co-operation between the United
States and the Soviet.
"We can to disagree on cer
taing points such as Communism
and capitalism," Dr. Stefansson
pointed out, "but with the added
strength of this country's word
combined with Russia's, much
trouble with Japan can probably be
avoided. The Alaskans would also
like to see co-operation on meteor
ology study in order to benefit from
the Russian wheat crop."
He outlined the defense put up
by Finland against Russia last year
by describing how Finland utilized
the natural defense found in the flat
terraines of the Northland. The
frontier of the United States on the
North is much the same as the Finn
ish contour, Stefansson said.
Besides explaining the northern
defense possibilities, Dr. Stefansson
remarked on the tremendous flying
opportunities possible over the Arc
tic areas.
