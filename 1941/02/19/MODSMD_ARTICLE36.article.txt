# Scalp-Seeking Bruins Set To Revenge Hoop Defeat
## 
### 
When U.C.L.A. comes north this week-end f«/r the second time in two
weeks, they are going to he raring to do something to Stanford's confer
ence-leading cagers that no other team has done or can possibly do this
season.
Because of their split with the Indians in the last Stanford-Ucla two-

game stand in Los Angeles a couple'
of weeks ago, the Bruins are in a
spot to cop a series from Stanford,
which is more than Cal can even
hope to accomplish. Of course, the
odds are all against the Bruins do
ing any such thing, but at least they
are better off in this respect than
are their cousins from over Berke
ley way or their cross-town rivals,
U.S.C.—the latter five having been
defeated in four straight games by
the Cards.
This week-end will be a test for
Coach Wilbur Johns' unpredictable
Bruin quintet, for in these two games
with the Indians basketball fans will
see whether Ucla's one-point vic
tory over the Indians was just a
fluke or whether Jackie Robinson
and his teammates really have
something on the ball.
It was a good guess that the Bruins
were really on their way two weeks
ago, but their three consecutive de
feats by U.S.C. and Cal (two
straight) makes any predictions con
cerning the southerners very risky.
Either Robinson, Fryer & Co. have
hit the toboggan since they defeated
Stanford or else the Bears are even
better than they were the last two
times they ran up against Coach Ev
erett Dean's flashy Indians. The
latter case is probably true.
According to figures released yes
terday by Stanford's publicity direc
tor, Don Liebendorfer, who is the
official statistician for the Southern
Division of the P.C.C., all five of
Coach Dean's starting team are in
cluded in the top 12 conference
scorers.
