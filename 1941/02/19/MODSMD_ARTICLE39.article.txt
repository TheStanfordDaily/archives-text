retraction to make. That ain't good.

I things. It seems that even the San

wrong and that often times Stan

what their coach is thinking.
To get to the point. Coach Clark
Shaughnessy WAS at the Board of
Athletic Control meeting when a
football game with U.S.F. was
scheduled for next fall and that he
was, at that time, IN FAVOR of
such a game.
True, in agreement with what the
various city papers had printed and
what your misguided sports editor
had learned from members of the
football team, Mr. Shaughnessy had
earlier expressed a strong desire to
maintain this open date. But upon
j conferring with the board and
; learning that this game will be the
I only bay area contest during the
week-end of October 18, Coach
Clark changed his mind.
I'm not printing this retraction be
cause I was TOLD to but because I
was definitely in the wrong and be
cause there is no reason in strain
ing relations with the B.A.C. any
more than necessary.
I'm just beginning to find out that 1

handle. There'll be no more hearsay
