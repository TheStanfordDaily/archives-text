# Lawyers to Hold Office Practice
## 
### 
The Stanford law school will hold
its first Office Practice Conference
hero Saturday and over 175 out
side lawyers are expected to attend,
according to Dean Kirkwood of the
law school.
The conference is based on a dis
cussion by Francis Price, his asso
icates, and the stafT of his Santa
Barbara law firm. For the last 10
years Mr. Price has invited Stan
ford law students to his offices for a
day of intensive study in the field of
office practice, and this year's event
is a continuation of this practice.
The program will be supplemented
by a discussion of drafting legal in
struments by Charles A. Beardsley
of Oakland, and another on brief
writing led by the Hon. Douglas Ed
monds, assoicate justice of the Su
preme Court of California. The
topics discussed will be of a tech
nical nature, but any undergraduates
who feel up to it are invited to
attend.
