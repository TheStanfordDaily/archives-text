# Farm Boxers To Meet Cal
## 
### 
Coach Clayton Frye is putting his
Farm boxers through the final work
outs for the meet with Cal's glove
team tomorrow night in the Pavil
ion.
Although the line-up is not yet
settled, it is certain that eight bouts
will be fought, according to Coach
Frye.
John Ward, probably the best
amateur fighter on the Coast, will
hold down the Card heavyweight
position in what will be the number
one bout of the evening. Ward won
his Cal Aggie fight with little diffi
culty, besides defeating Vic Lind
skog in the all-University cham
pionship.
The light-heavyweight spot will
be held down by Mel Ellett. The
105 position has not been decided,
but the senior welterweight man
will be Captain Tom Mac Michael,
who will fight Cal's Phil Fox. Frank
Hewitt will box McEvilly of Califor
nia in the welterweight class.
Bronson Cooley and Jack Rogers
will handle the bantamweight as
signments. Because of illness Stan
ford will forfeit the featherweight
bout.
Jim Thurmond, Bill Miller, and
John Ryan will probably see action
although the weights in which they
will fight are not certain yet. The
team is in far better shape for this
match than it was against Cal Ag
gies, Coach Frye reports.
This is the first Pacific Coast Con
ference competition the Indians have
faced all season. Nothing is known
of the past matches fought by the
Golden Bears, but the fighters that
enter the ring tomorrow night for
Stanford will be a wiser, more ex
perienced group. Several of the
glovemen scheduled to ;ee action
have had action only in uie all-Uni
versity championships, but the ma
jority faced the Aggies last week
end.
