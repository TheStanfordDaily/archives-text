# Aquatic Squad Meets Spartans
## 
### 
Stanford's great Cardinal tidal
wave is scheduled to churn the
smooth waters of San Jose State's
Spartan Plunge into a seething sea
of foam tomorrow evening.
Coach Charley Walker's mermen
recently outswam, out dove, and out
raced California's Golden Bears to
the tune of 39-36. Despite this
achievement, Stanford's power house
aquatic squad is a heavy favorite
not only to win by a lop-sided score
but to smash from one to three San
Jose pool records.
