# Dump Caucuses?
## 
### 
CHARACTERIZED by last night's Excom ac
tion as "too hot to handle" until study of
every aspect of the plan could be made
was a proposal which wouid eliminate Row-Hall
political caucuses and turn the Farm's ever
recurrent spring election problem into the hands
of a Men's Nominating Committee.
On first glance at the proposal Excom gulped
with laughter; second thought showed that the
matter was at least worthy of considerable
speculation.
There's been a bit of muck-raking and horse
trading going on each spring quarter.
Question which bothered Excom members
was: Would a nominating committee for men
solve all, most, or any of the problems created
by the present caucus system?
A long-range, clear-sighted picture of the
proposal and the system which it is intended to
eliminate shows that both caucuses and men's
nom-coms have their faults and favoring fea
tures. Neither is perfect—neither is worthless.
The Row-Hall caucuses have been in effect
at Stanford since time immemorial. And they
have given the Farm a student political mecha
nism which is probably as clean as any similar
university system.
It isn't an entirely clean and smoothly func
tioning system. Inter-Row and inter-Hall solons
have often turned things topsy-turvy long before
the voting stage was reached. Pre-caucus jug
glings have often boosted a more deserving man
off the slate. And a top-ranking man in a weaker
club or fraternity seldom reached a top-ranking
position through the caucus.
Major benefits of the system: There has
rarely if ever been a poor student body official;
the system is double-checked by the possibility
of bolting the caucus through the nomination
blank system; politics are such a tremendous
lot of fun.
A Men's Nominating Committee at Stanford
would eliminate much, but hardly all, of the
horse-trading and dickering involved in the cau
cus system. It would turn the major portion of
nominations over to a picked group who theo
retically, being seniors, would have no axe to
grind. It would give the good "little" man an
even break.
Major faults of the proposal: The caucuses
would boil and run rampant alter nom-com dis
closed its selections; a biased nominating com
mittee could stack the deck quietly and effec
tively; it would turn the Farm political season
into, not a new deal—but practically a closed
deal.
Excom will take the matter up for action at its
next regular meeting. Think it over.
