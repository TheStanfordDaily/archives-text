# Winter Quarter Fever
## 
### 
TOO often habits pass the helpful stage and
become merely vestigial growths, drains on
logical thought and logical action.
And no habit could be more vestigial than
Stanford students' peculiar, distinctive quirk,
that of failing to show any interest in the winter
quarter election.
It was just a week ago that the minority of
undergraduate Stanford straggled to the polls
and, without much deliberation or seeming
interest, scratched in the ballots for the winter
quarter election. By a fortunate coincidence, on
that balloting day syllabus fees were also due
in the Administration Building near the polls.
If such had not been the case, that minority of
voters might have been even more minor.
Yet, this problem is nothing new. We are
just reawakening a sleeping dog which has been
dozing since last winter and the winter before
at this same time. Mid-year elections have al
ways been such. Apparently few care. Few
vote.
Why the lack of interest? There is no justi
fiable answer because there is no justifiable
reason. Logical enough? Excluding the major
posts of student body president and vice-presi
dent and several class presidencies, the same
positions were going on the election block—
positions on Ex Committee, on Men's and Wom
en's Councils, on the B.A.C.
And yet, the final ballot showed that a scant
third of the student body took the trouble and
the insignificant time to place a few crosses
on a legibly printed, well alphabetized, and

easily understood ballot.
Why the lack of interest? Why do you put
on your right shoe first instead of your left?
Why do you walk down this side of the street
every day on the way to the Quad? Why do
you prefer one brand of mint gum to another?
Why? Because it has become a habit. In
some dark year back in the Farm's history,
Stanford students decided that there was little
point in voting in the winter election. Perhaps,
that year, they had some justifiable reason for
not voting. But the next year, they did not vote
—well, just because they had not voted the
year before. And so the incident has become
the habit.
And that habit is a vestigial organ. It is like
a human appendix. It goes on year after year,
just hanging there. Then suddenly, unexpect
edly, it is filled with pain, and must be removed
or the human will die.
Why not remove this habitual appendix, this
disinterest in the winter quarter election, before
pain sets in and some hasty and more drastic
operation becomes necessary?—B. A.

the habit.
And that habit is a vestigial organ. It is like
a human appendix. It goes on year after year,
just hanging there. Then suddenly, unexpect
edly, it is filled with pain, and must be removed
or the human will die.
Why not remove this habitual appendix, this
disinterest in the winter quarter election, before
pain sets in and some hasty and more drastic
operation becomes necessary?—B. A.
TOO often habits pass the helpful stage and
become merely vestigial growths, drains on
logical thought and logical action.
And no habit could be more vestigial than
Stanford students' peculiar, distinctive quirk,
that of failing to show any interest in the winter
quarter election.
It was just a week ago that the minority of
undergraduate Stanford straggled to the polls
and, without much deliberation or seeming
interest, scratched in the ballots for the winter
quarter election. By a fortunate coincidence, on
that balloting day syllabus fees were also due
in the Administration Building near the polls.
If such had not been the case, that minority of
voters might have been even more minor.
Yet, this problem is nothing new. We are
just reawakening a sleeping dog which has been
dozing since last winter and the winter before
at this same time. Mid-year elections have al
ways been such. Apparently few care. Few
vote.
Why the lack of interest? There is no justi
fiable answer because there is no justifiable
reason. Logical enough? Excluding the major
posts of student body president and vice-presi
dent and several class presidencies, the same
positions were going on the election block—
positions on Ex Committee, on Men's and Wom
en's Councils, on the B.A.C.
And yet, the final ballot showed that a scant
third of the student body took the trouble and
the insignificant time to place a few crosses
on a legibly printed, well alphabetized, and

easily understood ballot.
Why the lack of interest? Why do you put
on your right shoe first instead of your left?
Why do you walk down this side of the street
every day on the way to the Quad? Why do
you prefer one brand of mint gum to another?
Why? Because it has become a habit. In
some dark year back in the Farm's history,
Stanford students decided that there was little
point in voting in the winter election. Perhaps,
that year, they had some justifiable reason for
not voting. But the next year, they did not vote
—well, just because they had not voted the
year before. And so the incident has become
the habit.
