# BULL SESSION

### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
ALL CHECKS PAYABLE'
the Stanford men and women on the Peninsula
who are staying home with the wife, the kids, the
husband, a good book, or just staying home, will hear
the doorbell ring some evening this week.
''Aunt. Nell and Uncle Jim weren't coming over to
night, were they? Wonder who that is? Certainly
couldn't be the Fuller brush man at this hour."
They'll find it's a certain type of relative, and
that it is a salesman, too. In fact, it will be two sales
men and the product they'll be selling won't lie
around on the window sill in the kitchen. It will be
something intangible—a principle, an idea, and maybe
a memory.

like individuals, suffer economic
pangs. When the pressure on the bank stubs gets
too insistent, there are two alternatives. You can
either stop spending money or you can find an addi
tional source of revenue—like a rich relative. Usually
the former plan is the easier, but universities like
Stanford have fixed overheads and tremendously high
operating costs. They can't fail their obligations and
simply cease to spend.
Of course, it might be smarter not to construct
amphitheaters that cost a few hundred thousand and
are used twice a year—for graduation and a mother's
club pageant. But often such matters cannot be com
pletely controlled by the men who run a college.
Something there is about a grad that loves memo
rials. Usually the man who feels a loyalty to alma
mater shows his affection by giving Siwash a building,
or a fountain, or a stone bench—and it's always named
after him.

so the biggest necessity of a modern Univer
sity is its need for "unearmarked" funds, just
cash that can go into the books as such and be used
for any contingency that may arise.
The 120 students who sat in the Union and con
sumed a free meal last night will learn a practical
lesson in "How to Win Friends and Influence People"
this week. They will be ambassadors of Stanford,
members of the Stanford Family calling on other
members of the Family. In most cases, their job will
be easy. Their presence will be accepted with good
grace and they won't have too many doors slammed
in their faces.
The Family, in general, is a friendly clan. It is proud
to have shared the common heritage of Stanford.
And, if possible, it likes to contribute to the mainte
nance of the University.
The checks that flow in will constitute an important
part of the Stanford future—l94l, 1942. And the per
centage of brush-offs should be lower than ever this
year.
