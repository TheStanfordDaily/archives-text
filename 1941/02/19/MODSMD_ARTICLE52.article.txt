## COMEDY OF ERRORS 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Because of a recent misunderstanding, it seems
necessary to state that the "300" Club is a purely
fictitious organization, created by myself without the
knowledge or consent of the "members."
Originally intended as a joke, it has gone beyond
that stage, and caused unpleasant results for which I
am responsible and for which I wish to apologize to
the students involved.
I trust that this will clear up an unpleasant situa
tion in which the people involved are in no way
responsible.
