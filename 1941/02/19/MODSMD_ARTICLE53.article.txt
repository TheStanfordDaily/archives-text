'pIE EDITOR, SIR:
In a couple of months, spring elections will be
coming up. High pressure factions will form in the
halls, on the row, and among the independents. They'll
scheme, make "deals" and do their best to jockey
their candidates into the nominations. Then the cam
pus politicians will get to work bringing in the votes,
and a split will form with row men and women drawn
upon one side against hall men and women on the
other.
People who haven't thought about any split to
any great extent during the rest of the year will sud
denly feel themselves compelled to vote for' a man,
not because he's the best man for the job necessarily,
but because he was steam-rollered through a caucus
with which they very likely didn't have much to do.
One solution which might to a large extent remedy
this unnatural and unnecessary split would be to
abolish all caucuses, and to handle nominations
through nominating comimttees. That would necessi
tate forming a men's nominating committee to function
along with the present women's nominating committee,
to interview and investigate all prospective candidates,
choose a certain number from the halls, and inde
pendents, and a certain number from the row.
Anyone who was not chosen could be nominated
by means of a ballot signed by 15 people. A number
of difficulties would of course arise. Who should be
on the men's nominating committee? Should it con
sist of an even division between fraternity and non
fraternity men? Should it include only the president
of the A.S.S.U., Interfraternity, and Interclub Councils,
Cardinals, etc., without any distinction as, to affiliations?
Should the number of nominations be limited to
two row and two non-row candidates for each office, or
should nominations be split into proportional repre
sentation to club, halls, independents, and row men?
There would be a great number of snags which
would have to be compromised and ironed out in such
a scheme. But we believe lhat in the main it is a
good idea, and that it would certainly be a vast im
provement over the present caucus system. What do
some of the rest of you think about it?

sentation to club, halls, independents, and row men?
There would be a great number of snags which
would have to be compromised and ironed out in such
a scheme. But we believe lhat in the main it is a
good idea, and that it would certainly be a vast im
provement over the present caucus system. What do
some of the rest of you think about it?

'pIE EDITOR, SIR:
In a couple of months, spring elections will be
coming up. High pressure factions will form in the
halls, on the row, and among the independents. They'll
scheme, make "deals" and do their best to jockey
their candidates into the nominations. Then the cam
pus politicians will get to work bringing in the votes,
and a split will form with row men and women drawn
upon one side against hall men and women on the
other.
People who haven't thought about any split to
any great extent during the rest of the year will sud
denly feel themselves compelled to vote for' a man,
not because he's the best man for the job necessarily,
but because he was steam-rollered through a caucus
with which they very likely didn't have much to do.
One solution which might to a large extent remedy
this unnatural and unnecessary split would be to
abolish all caucuses, and to handle nominations
through nominating comimttees. That would necessi
tate forming a men's nominating committee to function
along with the present women's nominating committee,
to interview and investigate all prospective candidates,
choose a certain number from the halls, and inde
pendents, and a certain number from the row.
Anyone who was not chosen could be nominated
by means of a ballot signed by 15 people. A number
of difficulties would of course arise. Who should be
on the men's nominating committee? Should it con
sist of an even division between fraternity and non
fraternity men? Should it include only the president
of the A.S.S.U., Interfraternity, and Interclub Councils,
Cardinals, etc., without any distinction as, to affiliations?
Should the number of nominations be limited to
two row and two non-row candidates for each office, or
should nominations be split into proportional repre
sentation to club, halls, independents, and row men?
