"TIIE FAMILY." by Nina Fedorova. On sale at the Stanford Bookstore.
Every year the Atlantic Monthly awards $1(1,0011 to the best novel of
the year. The choice for 1940 was Nina Fedorova's poignant little book,
"The Family."
Essentially "The Family" is a series of observations, incorporated into

clearly lined sketches, strung to- (
gether on a slender threat of action.
And each sketch is in itself, poten
tial material for a complete book.
The action, such as it is, centers in
a boarding house in the poorest sec
tion of the British Concession of
Tientsin, China. Here the last five
members of large family of the
former Russian intelligentsia settled
after the Russian Revolution.
CHARACTERS DESTITUTE
Here we find them in 1937 feebly
clinging to the last refuge allowed to
those who have no country and no
pasports. The family, Granny,
Mother, daughter lida, and the two
nephews, Peter and Dima, have be
come the nucleus of an ever-chang
ing group of derelicts.
They have their exits and their
entrances —these hunted waifs of
Revolution and oppression — they
drift into the shabby pension and
out again with almost despite them
selves, impelled by forces of inter
national turmoil of which they are
scarcely aware. Most of them have
seen better days.
CASUALLY MOVING PLOT
The tenuous story follows a gen
tle meandering course. Crises arise
and pass away with little disturb
ance. It is the characters which
make the book charming and touch
ingly human — such a conglomerate
of bizarre specimens could be found
only this unusual setting—perhaps
only in a book.
But despite casualness, its delicate
thread of narrative, it's artfully
simple style, the understanding and
warm feeling with which the story
is told compels any one who starts
the book to read with unflagging in
terest to the very last page.—Doug
