# Journalism Students Profit $225 by Course Assignments
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Clifford F. Weiglc, journalism professor, is probing bis chances for a
job as commissioned magazine agent for Stanford writers. And with good
reason. In his fall quarter course, "Forms of Journalistic Writing," Mr.
Weigle's students collected checks totaling $225 from national and regional

magazines.
High-score seller in the class was
Kathleen Norris, whose aritcle on
the Palo Alto Children's Library
netted her $75. She sold it to Amer
ican Home, which will print the
story with pictures in the April,
1941 issue. American Home did not
buy the article under any illusions
as to the identity of its author, for
Miss Norris adopted a nom de plume.
For years she has been confused
with the Kathleen Norris of fiction
writing fame. The twins of name
live in the same part of town and
often receive each other's mail, but
they are not related.
"Coeds Love to Eat" is the title
of Miss Norris' second article, which
appeared in the last issue of Stan
ford Illustrated Review. In it she
traced the history of college women's
diets from the normal breakfast in
1891 consisting of two lamb chops,
French fried potatoes, and apple pie
to the modern female breakfast of
orange juice and melba toast.
AMES PROFITS
Close runner-up on Miss Norris'
writing success was Bud Ames,
former Daily Bull-Sessioner. His
best sale was an article on the tech
nical equipment of the Roadrunner
Theatrical group, for which "Me
chanics Illustrated" paid $50. Ames
was so amazed at the size of the
check that it took him three weeks
to decide how to spend it. He also
sold a personality feature on Stan
ford's swimming star, Paul Herron,
to "American Boy."
Ames is now working on an ar
ticle which describes suitable fur
nishing for government housing
projects in metropolitan areas.
Memories of his pet mountain lion
provided Jackson Edmunds with an
idea that proved to be worth $30 tc
Nature magazine. The completed
story plus pictures related Edmands'
experiences in raising Tom, a six
year-old Sierra mountain lion.
ANIMAL TALES POPULAR
Further attesting to the popularity
of animal stories among American
magazine editors, Roy Vitousck
placed an article on "Big Game
Hunting in Hawaii" in a magazine
"Paradise of the Pacific."
Jerry Brucker, former Daily sports
editor, succeeded in convincing the
Illustrated Review that his colorful
accounts of Big Game and Rose Bowl
victories were the best available
Harold Shafer sold the Review s
sports story of the revival of crew
at Stanford.

ANIMAL TALES POPULAR
Further attesting to the popularity
of animal stories among American
magazine editors, Roy Vitousck
placed an article on "Big Game
Hunting in Hawaii" in a magazine
"Paradise of the Pacific."
Jerry Brucker, former Daily sports
editor, succeeded in convincing the
Illustrated Review that his colorful
accounts of Big Game and Rose Bowl
victories were the best available
Harold Shafer sold the Review s
sports story of the revival of crew
at Stanford.
BUDGETING DESCRIBED
Instructions on how to handle s
checking account sounded like mucl
needed reader information to edi
tors of The Woman when they pur
chased Rose Douglas' article on thai
subject. Since Miss Douglas' fathei
is a banker, she was able to obtair
both authoritative and amusing ma
terial on the peculiarities of female
budget balancing.
Clifford F. Weiglc, journalism professor, is probing bis chances for a
job as commissioned magazine agent for Stanford writers. And with good
reason. In his fall quarter course, "Forms of Journalistic Writing," Mr.
Weigle's students collected checks totaling $225 from national and regional

magazines.
High-score seller in the class was
Kathleen Norris, whose aritcle on
the Palo Alto Children's Library
netted her $75. She sold it to Amer
ican Home, which will print the
story with pictures in the April,
1941 issue. American Home did not
buy the article under any illusions
as to the identity of its author, for
Miss Norris adopted a nom de plume.
For years she has been confused
with the Kathleen Norris of fiction
writing fame. The twins of name
live in the same part of town and
often receive each other's mail, but
they are not related.
"Coeds Love to Eat" is the title
of Miss Norris' second article, which
appeared in the last issue of Stan
ford Illustrated Review. In it she
traced the history of college women's
diets from the normal breakfast in
1891 consisting of two lamb chops,
French fried potatoes, and apple pie
to the modern female breakfast of
orange juice and melba toast.
AMES PROFITS
Close runner-up on Miss Norris'
writing success was Bud Ames,
former Daily Bull-Sessioner. His
best sale was an article on the tech
nical equipment of the Roadrunner
Theatrical group, for which "Me
chanics Illustrated" paid $50. Ames
was so amazed at the size of the
check that it took him three weeks
to decide how to spend it. He also
sold a personality feature on Stan
ford's swimming star, Paul Herron,
to "American Boy."
Ames is now working on an ar
ticle which describes suitable fur
nishing for government housing
projects in metropolitan areas.
Memories of his pet mountain lion
provided Jackson Edmunds with an
idea that proved to be worth $30 tc
Nature magazine. The completed
story plus pictures related Edmands'
experiences in raising Tom, a six
year-old Sierra mountain lion.
