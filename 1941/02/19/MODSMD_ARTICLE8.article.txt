### 
Mrs. Ellen Coit Elliott, author of
"It Happened This Way," an anthol
ogy of Stanford during its earliest
years, will be honored at a tea to
day at 4 o'clock in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Mrs. Elliott is the wife of the late
Dr. O. L. Elliott, first registrar of
the University, who wrote a book on
Stanford's first 25 years. "It Hap

account of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford
and daily life on the Farm.
Assisting at the tea will be four
Stanford students who belong to the
original Stanford family. They are
Jeanne Williams and Margaret El
liot, granddaughters of Mrs. Elliot;
Sebelle Harden, descendant of the
Lathrop family; and Enid Branner,
granddaughter of a former Stanford
president.
All university women and others
I interested in Mrs. Elliott's book are
invited to attend.
