# Wacky Women Canoe at Lake Despite Rain
##

"EE-gad, wot'll these wacky dames
think up next," muttered Hadley
Bacon into a two-day growth of
beard as lie watched the rain make
little splashes on the surface of
Lagunita.
"They come over here and get out
a canoe, bundle up in raincoats and
paddle around the lake until the
boat fills tip with rain water. Then
they bring the boat back to me to
empty out and put away," he com
plained.
"Not many of 'em go swimming,
they say it's a little cold for that
yet," he replied laconically to a
question put to him about the nata
torial uses of the lake.
All of which leads up to the fact
that the lake is already starting on
its season, in spite of the weather.
As far as the season has gone, it
has been very successful despite the
effort of the heavens to fill it up in
the next few days. Almost any
afternoon 10 or 12 earnest and ar
dent, albeit somewhat inexpert,
canoers can be seen splashing their
merry way across the muddy v/aters,
while the week-end total will go up
to 50 each day.
Lagunita is almost as full at this
time as it was last, year when it
threatened to overflow, but all worry
from this source has now been re
moved by the placing of special
valves to drain away the water.
