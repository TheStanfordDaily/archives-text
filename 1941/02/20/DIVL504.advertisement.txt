Know Your Bookstore
By 1897, students' and faculty's dissatisfaction with the
manner in which the co-op served the community caused
Dr. Jordan to ask a group of faculty members to organize
a bookstore which would be run under their direction and
with permanent management. An article appeared in the
Daily Palo Alto, Stanford University, March 11, 1897,
which begins as follows: "The faculty will start a store
where all will be treated alike." Professors Green, Powers,
Show, Hoskins, and Richardson composed the first Board
of Directors of the Stanford Bookstore.
