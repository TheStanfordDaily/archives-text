Homer Flunked Out!
NO wonder ... he never had time to do his
lessons. His domestic duties kept him too busy!
Homer's chief trouble was buttons . . . unfaithful
little perforated disks that kept coming off his shirts
(which weren't Arrows). While other guys were
out dating on weekends, you could always find
Homer nimbly thimbling a needle.
Why didn't someone tell him
about Arrow Shirts with anchored
buttons? They never come off!
They're as permanent as the fine
T style and fit of all Arrow shirts.
' m m Arrow whites are all-time favor
ed ites. As all Arrows they have the
Mitoga tailored fit and the one and only Arrow
collar in a variety of styles to suit your type. Stock
up on Arrows today. $2 up.
