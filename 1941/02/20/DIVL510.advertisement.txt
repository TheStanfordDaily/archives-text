Who Invented the
MOUSETRAP?
You've often heard the old adage: "Let a man make
a better mousetrap, and the world will make a beaten
path to his door."
But have you ever happened upon that path, or even
looked for it?
Why should you, when the people who today have
things to seli beat a path to your door to tell you about
them?
Every newspaper that comes into your home brings
you a new list of what you can gel", and where. You can
do your shopping in the advertising pages—instead of
beating a path from store to store to find what you want.
Make it a habit to look over the advertisements, and
you'll find many fine values you might have missed . . .
many exciting and useful things you otherwise might
\ never have known about!
