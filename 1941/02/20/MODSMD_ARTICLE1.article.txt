A LARMIST" is a title with which
we do not wish to be tagged. |
All the same, after checking over the
various developments in yesterday's j
world, we will admit that we are
slightly disturbed.
It's not the events in themselves
that are new and startling. Most of
them are just continuations of things
that have been simmering for some
time. But, taken all together, they
do present an unlovely picture — a
picture in which the United States
seems to belong.
First there is that bill, passed
by the House yesterday, authoriz
ing expansion of naval air bases
at Guam and Samoa. Nobody is
paying any attention to Japan's 1
protests about this any more.
Then, the legislators, in the heat of
the lend-lease debates, are begin
ning to drop one qualifying phrase
they have been very careful to in
clude up until recently. The phrase
is "short of war."
* *
r pilE British are "understood" to be
putting terrific pressure on the
Greeks to continue the Italian con
flict, and seem willing to send troops,
supplies, and planes to the penin
sula. The British have wanted to do !
this all along, but the Athens gov
ernment has been afraid that all
out British aid might precipitate the
German attack. Obviously the Brit
ish want to hang on to their Conti
nental toe-holds.
The Greeks are in the middle of
a squeeze play—and their decision
may mean victory or defeat to
Great Britain. Meanwhile Jugo
slavia is moving quickly into Hit
ler's Balkan hegemony, with a
Jugoslav-Bulgarian "non-aggres- I
sior." pact in the immediate ofling.
Over in the Pacific, Japan today
asserted that Britain's sensational
moves in the Singapore and Malay
area are part of a joint British-
American plan to "strangle Japan"
and will be countered with "appro
priate measures."
If Japan's "appropriate measures"
include anything like a war outside
of the Thailand-Indo-Chinese area,
the Philippines are almost certain to
be involved simply because of their
position. And in goes the United
States—that's us.
* # *
|N the language peculiar to diplo
mats the Japanese combined their !
remarks about "appropriate meas
ures" with the soothing statement
that "the British are excessively
nervous, and are being frightened by |
a bogey of their own creation." They
add that:
"Japan's intentions are peaceful
and this country rests on its dec
laration, as made Tuesday, that
the Empire stands for peace and is
ready to help in mediation of dis
putes all over the world."
"Britain naturally is free to move
her troops within British-controlled
territories as she may wish," they
say, "but in event these British
forces become a menace to Japan's
safety then our attitude will be |
firm."
* * *
HPHE Japanese mind is a strange
one. No doubt the British are
literally aching to start another war
for themselves. They probably
couldn't think of a more opportune
moment.
A rumor which turned up both
in Washington and London yes
terday is the most bothersome of
this sequence of events. Only a
rumor as yet, if it does become
fact it is going to be of the utmost
importance. For what it's worth,
here it is:
"Grave events" are pending in j
Vichy which might throw France j
into the war against Britain. The 1
British are sure that Hitler intends I
to take over Vichy, and a promi- :
nent former French government of
ficial in Paris said that France "is at
the point of- fighting against Brit
ain" probably in the Mediterranean.
There they are . . . yesterday's
important events, complete with
rumor, speculation, and some solid
facts. With all that going on, some
thing's bound to happen. At least
you can scare yourself to death j
thinking about it.

thinking about it.
A LARMIST" is a title with which
we do not wish to be tagged. |
All the same, after checking over the
various developments in yesterday's j
world, we will admit that we are
slightly disturbed.
It's not the events in themselves
that are new and startling. Most of
them are just continuations of things
that have been simmering for some
time. But, taken all together, they
do present an unlovely picture — a
picture in which the United States
seems to belong.
First there is that bill, passed
by the House yesterday, authoriz
ing expansion of naval air bases
at Guam and Samoa. Nobody is
paying any attention to Japan's 1
protests about this any more.
Then, the legislators, in the heat of
the lend-lease debates, are begin
ning to drop one qualifying phrase
they have been very careful to in
clude up until recently. The phrase
is "short of war."

r pilE British are "understood" to be
putting terrific pressure on the
Greeks to continue the Italian con
flict, and seem willing to send troops,
supplies, and planes to the penin
sula. The British have wanted to do !
this all along, but the Athens gov
ernment has been afraid that all
out British aid might precipitate the
German attack. Obviously the Brit
ish want to hang on to their Conti
nental toe-holds.
The Greeks are in the middle of
a squeeze play—and their decision
may mean victory or defeat to
Great Britain. Meanwhile Jugo
slavia is moving quickly into Hit
ler's Balkan hegemony, with a
Jugoslav-Bulgarian "non-aggres- I
sior." pact in the immediate ofling.
Over in the Pacific, Japan today
asserted that Britain's sensational
moves in the Singapore and Malay
area are part of a joint British-
American plan to "strangle Japan"
and will be countered with "appro
priate measures."
If Japan's "appropriate measures"
include anything like a war outside
of the Thailand-Indo-Chinese area,
the Philippines are almost certain to
be involved simply because of their
position. And in goes the United
States—that's us.

|N the language peculiar to diplo
mats the Japanese combined their !
remarks about "appropriate meas
ures" with the soothing statement
that "the British are excessively
nervous, and are being frightened by |
a bogey of their own creation." They
add that:
"Japan's intentions are peaceful
and this country rests on its dec
laration, as made Tuesday, that
the Empire stands for peace and is
ready to help in mediation of dis
putes all over the world."
"Britain naturally is free to move
her troops within British-controlled
territories as she may wish," they
say, "but in event these British
forces become a menace to Japan's
safety then our attitude will be |
firm."

HPHE Japanese mind is a strange
one. No doubt the British are
literally aching to start another war
for themselves. They probably
couldn't think of a more opportune
moment.
A rumor which turned up both
in Washington and London yes
terday is the most bothersome of
this sequence of events. Only a
rumor as yet, if it does become
fact it is going to be of the utmost
importance. For what it's worth,
here it is:
"Grave events" are pending in j
Vichy which might throw France j
into the war against Britain. The 1
British are sure that Hitler intends I
to take over Vichy, and a promi- :
nent former French government of
ficial in Paris said that France "is at
the point of- fighting against Brit
ain" probably in the Mediterranean.
There they are . . . yesterday's
important events, complete with
rumor, speculation, and some solid
facts. With all that going on, some
thing's bound to happen. At least
you can scare yourself to death j
thinking about it.
