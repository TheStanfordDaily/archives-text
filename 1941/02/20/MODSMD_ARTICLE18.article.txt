# House Passes Naval Air Base Expansion Bill
## 250 Millions Granted For Improvements In Pacific, Atlantic 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (UP). â€”
Tiu; House today approved a bill
authorizing expansion of naval air
bases at Guam and Samoa, astride
the western Pacific sealanes to
Japan, after Admiral Harold R.
Stark, chief of naval operations, said
bluntly if Japan look offense it
would be unmerited meddling in
U. S. affairs.
The measure, calling for $245,-
228,500 of improvements on stra
tegic bases in the Pacific, the At
lantic, and in continental United
States, was passed by voice vote,
with Rep. Vito Marcantonio, A-L.,
New York, the lone dissenter.
SHORT DEBATE
The vote was taken after less than
two hours of debate and while the
Administration maintained a "watch
ful waiting" policy toward the Far
Eastern situation.
Acting Secretary of State Sum
ner Welles declined to discuss de
velopments at his press conference.
He told reporters yesterday, after
Japan offered itself as a mediator
of world unrest, that the United
States "is far more interested in
the deeds of other nations than in
the statements some of their
spokesmen may make."
The Army strengthened its intel
ligence service in the Far East by
assigning observers to Thailand
(Siam), Singapore, and the Dutch
East Indies, effective by March 1.
WILL STRENGTHEN
The Navy anounced the fleet, now
in Hawaii, will be strengthened in
September by the addition of the
new 35,000-ton battleship Washing
ton. It said the vessel will be com
(jnissioned in May, six and one-half
months ahead of schedule.
Chairman Carl Vinson, D., Ga.,
of the Naval Affairs Committee,
paved the way for the vote by
reading a letter from Stark de
scribing the Guam improvement
as "inoffensive" and stating if
Japan did profess offense "it
would be unmerited and should, in
my opinion, be totally disre
garded."
