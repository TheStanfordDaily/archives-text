Addressing the Luncheon Club
yesterday, Dr. Bailey Willis, pro
fessor emeritus of geology, talked on
"Men I Have Known."
"I have known great men and
men who have committed every
crime in the country." In his 35-
minute speech, Dr. Willis took his
audience from New York to Oregon,
to Peking, to Argentina, to India
for brief sketches of the acquain
tances picked up in his amazing
career.
There was Dick Templeton, who
accompanied the 24-year-old Mr.
Willis on a three-year trip on foot
through the West in search of coal,
deposits for the Pacific Northwest
Railroad. He was a San Francisco
drunkard and a smuggler wanted by
the law when he asked to go with
Mr. Willis "into the wilderness."
"But every man you meet is an
opportunity, and you can al'.vays get
a spark out of him even if you only
have a contact," Dr. Bailey said.
