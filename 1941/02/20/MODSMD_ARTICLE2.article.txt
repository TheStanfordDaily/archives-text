# Joint Jugoslav-Bulgaria Pact Pending in Few Days; Would Totally Ring Greece
## On Other Fronts: Diplomats Report Italians, Greeks Have Sought Peace For Weeks; Britain Rejects 'Salve' 
### 
SOFIA, Thursday, Feb. 20 (IJP). —A joint declaration of non-aggression
by Jugoslavia and Bulgaria, instigated hy Adolf Hitler, is expected to be
announced within a few days and make more acute the position of Greece
and her British ally, authoritative sources said last night.
The declaration will be almost identical to the Bulgarian-Turkish

statement of Monday which served
to "neutralize" Turkey and open the j
way for a German push across Bul
garia to drive the British from their !
Balkan foothold in Greece.
The linking of Jugoslavia to the
Turkish-Bulgarian accord of friend
ship and non-aggression would en
circle Greece with a network of Nazi
influence.
And it would enable Hitler to en
force his reported demands that
Greece submit to a "quick peace"
with Italy under threat of a Nazi
invasion.
The groundwork for the forth
coming Jugoslav-Bulgarian declara
tion was said in authoritative quar
ters here to have been laid when
Jugoslav Premier Dragisha Svetko
vitch and Foreign Minister Alexan
der Cincarmarkovitch went to Ger
many last week and conferred with
Hitler and Foreign Minister Joa
chim von Ribbentrop.
Since then the negotiations have
progressed through diplomatic
channels with reports of an im
pending meeting between Cvetko
vitch and Bulgarian Urcmier Bog
dan Filoff.
Reports that King Boris had gone
to Berlin were denied here as were
reports that Germany already was
rushing war materials into Bulgaria
by way of Jugoslavia.
