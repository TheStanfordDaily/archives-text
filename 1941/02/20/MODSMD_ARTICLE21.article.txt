had secured Kyser after Boh Beckham, orchestra committee head, had
traveled south by train to discuss the deal with the popular hand leader,

his business manager, and two offi
cials of Music Corporation of
America.
Beckham spent several days com
pleting arrangements that will bring
the "makes you want to dance"
music to Stanford. Kyser's appear
ance here will mark the first time
he has ever played at any college
dance on the Coast, Beckham said.
"Kay said he wanted to play at
Stanford, and to prove it he turned
down two jobs that would have
meant about $500 extra in profits,"
Beckham declared.
'DOUBLE THE PRICE'
"On the following evening Kyser
will play a one-night stand at al
most double the price of his Farm
engagement," he added.
(For comment see page 4 edi
torial: "$1,500 Compliment.")
At the present time Kyser is com
pleting plans for his third picture
with R.K.O. and he and his orches
tra, featured vocalists Ginny Simms,
Harry Babbitt, "Ish Kabibble," and
Sully Mason are making recordings
in Hollywood.
FEATURED ON RADIO
Considered one of the two or
three top "name" bands in the
country, Kyser is featured on the
coast-to-coast radio program of
Lucky Strike's "College of Musical
Knowledge."
He will play for dancers from 9

7. Bids are expected to go on sale
next week, according to Dan Hays.
They will be priced at $3.50 and may
