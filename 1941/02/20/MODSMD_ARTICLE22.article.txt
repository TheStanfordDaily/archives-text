# Wanna Buy A Duck?â€”-Jump In The Lake
## 
### 
"Wanna buy a duck?" may well
become a revived expression around
the campus with the recent arrival
of approximately 300 little grey and
white canvasback ducks at Lake
Lagunita.
Any student wanting to get the
bird will have to come at night, as
the creatures make only nocturnal
appearances. It seems people scare
them away during the day time, al
though where the young ducks
spend their daylight hours remains
unsolved. Discoverer of this wild
life on the Farm was Bert Singer,
boathouse assistant.
Dr. Willis H. Rich, professor of
biology, ascribed the ducks' pres
presence to the aVmual migration
from their winter quarters in the
South. "They are a common species
in this region," he stated.
Despite its scientific insignifi
cance, the event should inspire
some enterprising Stanfordite to im
mortalize it with a ditty entitled,
"When the Ducks Come Back to
Lagunita."
