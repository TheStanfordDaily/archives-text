# Ellen Elliot Recalls Old Farm Days
## Press Honors Widow Of First Registrar At Yesterday's Tea 
### 
Mrs. Ellen Coil Elliot, wife of Stan
ford's first registrar and author of "It
Happened This Way," described the
scene of Stanford's founding at a tea
ven in her honor by the Stanford
University Press yesterday afternoon.
A lusty yell, "Wahoo, Wahoo, L.
S. J. U., Stanroru," greeted Mr. and
Mrs. Stanford as they entered the
inner quad for the founding cere
monies in 1891, Mrs. El licit recalled.
Mrs. Elliot related briefly the story
of her entrance into Cornell where
: lie met Mr. Elliot, who came to
Stanford with Dr. Jordan, Stanford's
first President.
DIFFICULTIES FACED
Faced with the numerous respon
sibilities of a home while her mother
wns absent, Mrs. Elliot found she had
to take twelve entrance examinations
for Cornell. Her father, a man with
an extraordinary sense of humor and
a groat tenderness for his daughter,
helped her to enter as a sophomore.
"We laid siege to the registrar and
I finally entered six weeks late, but
I did finish in three years," she
said.
Mrs. Elliot gave a stirring account
ol her personal experiences at Stan
ford during and following the earth
quake and its disastrous effects upon
the new University buildings.
"We could see a cloud of smoke
ri ing over the quadrangle, and there
was a mangled wreck where the bells
in the tower had chimed. The shin
ing mosaic of the 'Sermon on the
Mount' lay in fragments and the top
of the Memorial Arch was knocked
off like an ash from a cigar," she
said.
ANECDOTES TOLD
Anecdotes of what happened at
Roble and Encina produced chuckles
of amusement from her audience.
She told about how one of the girls,
seeing her roommate's bed fall into
a crack, called to see if she was
hurt and received a calm, "Oh, I'm
just down here in the parlor."
She read about the problems of
hour-glass corsets and numerous
sweeping petticoats in the life of an
1891 coed. The ideal article of ap
parel for winter was a heavy dark
skirt and for summer an almost
equally heavy white one. "Dress re
form" lifted .skirts just off the floor
.nd allowed black bloomers for
cycling and gymnasium activities.
