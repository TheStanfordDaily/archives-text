### HELEN CRAIG 
Emphasizing "The Spirit «;f French Poetry in Melodic Modern Music,"
Darius Milhaud and his wife, Madeleine, showed the profound relation
| ship that exists between melody and poetry in a lecture-recital in the
Education Auditorium last night.
"Poetry uses words while music depends only on sounds. Both are as

vital as the inner moving of
hearts. Poetry can approach music i
in vibration," M. Milhaud said.
GIVES EXAMPLES
Maintaining that there is no poetry
without music, and that as soon as
sound strikes there is poetry, the
composer-pianist gave examples of
the influence of French poets on such
well known French composers as
Debussy and Ravel. Goethe, Schil
ler, and Carlyle emphasized the mu
sical element in the melody of their
poetic lin.es, he explained.
Debussy, perhaps the best known
example of the modern style, was
greatly influences by the poetry of
Materlinck and it was because of
greatly influenced by the poetry of
his most melodious collections of
songs. He matched his harmonies to
certain sounds of the poem.

Madame Milhaud's interpretation j
of a number of French poems which j
inspired composers was excellent.

tempestuous tragedy of "Sea Wind," j
and incorporated shades of dramatic
ecstacy, serenity, excitement, and
tenderness with ease into every se- ;
lection.

played several of his own composi- j

touch he opened his recital with j
"Three Printemps." Outstanding se- |
