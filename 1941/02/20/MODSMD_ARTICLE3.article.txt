## 
### 
BELGRADE, Jugoslavia, Feb. 19
(UP). â€”It was reported persistently
but without confirmation in diplo
matic circles here tonight that both
the Greeks and the Italians have
"been ready" for peace for the past
two weeks, but have been unable
to come to terms.
Tire Greeks reportedly are insist
ing on retaining their gains, but the
Italians are said to be equally in
sistent on obtaining for the sake of
prestige a semblance of victory.
The British reportedly are pressing
the Greeks to continue fighting be
cause of the great strategic value of
the Greek island of Crete to British
Mediterranean operations.
