### JOHN HORRALL 
Marked by an abundance of middle and light-heavyweight fighters,
Stanford's potentially potent boxing team enters the ring tonight a slight
favorite to whip the invading California Golden Bears, 'the bouts will he
held at 8 o'clock in the Pavilion.

week-end; Jim Thurmond, who won

who has had tough luck thus far as
far a decisions go; and Mel Leaver,
who has not fought since he beat
Pete Gadd in the novice tournament
a month ago.

of the Bears in the curtain raiser.

more experience than Cooley. A win

in the local fistic world, for he lost
in the all-University fights and to
the Cal Aggie man in a close deci
sion last week.
Frank Hewitt faces Bob McEvilly
in the 145-pound division. Hewitt is
one of the best boxers on the Farm
today. Last week he was the victim
of a questionable technical k.0., but
he is set for revenge tonight. Mc-
Evilly also boxed for the Bears last
season.
HEAVYWEIGHT BOUT
Johnny Ward, powerful heavy
weight, matches gloves with Cal's
big man Jack Thorburn. Ward

around ring ability. To date he has
a decision over Vic Lindskog and a
smashing knockout win over Ken
Colin of the Cal Aggies to his credit.
Captain Tom Mac Michael handles
the 155-pound duties for the Indians
against Chris Fox. Mac Michael has
a perfect record this season with a

ponent.

venge tonight, and there is no other
team they would rather take it out
on than the Bears.
This will be the first contest of
the season for the invaders, which

vantage.

a perfect record this season with a
win in the all-University tourney
and a decision over his Aggie op
ponent.
LIGHT-HEAVY STARTERS
Milt Cunha, Jim McCrary, and
Ray Greenwood are the definite 165
and light-heavy starters for the
Bears; Cunha and McCrary are 165-
pounders; Greenwood fights the
light-heavy battle. Greenwood and
Cunha both fought last year.
Coach Frye's men will be in much
better condition tonight than they
were a week ago. Colds and injuries
bothered the ringmen during Aggie
fights. The Indians are out for re
venge tonight, and there is no other
team they would rather take it out
on than the Bears.
This will be the first contest of
the season for the invaders, which
places the Cards at a definite ad
vantage.
Marked by an abundance of middle and light-heavyweight fighters,
Stanford's potentially potent boxing team enters the ring tonight a slight
favorite to whip the invading California Golden Bears, 'the bouts will he
held at 8 o'clock in the Pavilion.
The definite starters in the 165-pound and light-heavy classes cannot

be decided until the official weigh
ing-in tomorrow, according to Coach
Clayton Frye. Four men are under
question: John Ryan, who lost his
match against the Cal Aggies last
week-end; Jim Thurmond, who won
his fight; Mcl Ellett, a good boxer
who has had tough luck thus far as
far a decisions go; and Mel Leaver,
who has not fought since he beat
Pete Gadd in the novice tournament
a month ago.
COOLEY MEETS ROGERS
Bronson Cooley meets Jack Rogers
of the Bears in the curtain raiser.
Rogers fought last year and has
more experience than Cooley. A win
would put Cooley several steps ahead
in the local fistic world, for he lost
in the all-University fights and to
the Cal Aggie man in a close deci
sion last week.
Frank Hewitt faces Bob McEvilly
in the 145-pound division. Hewitt is
one of the best boxers on the Farm
today. Last week he was the victim
of a questionable technical k.0., but
he is set for revenge tonight. Mc-
Evilly also boxed for the Bears last
season.

weight, matches gloves with Cal's

around ring ability. To date he has
a decision over Vic Lindskog and a
smashing knockout win over Ken
Colin of the Cal Aggies to his credit.

the 155-pound duties for the Indians
