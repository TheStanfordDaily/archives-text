### 
LONDON, Feb. 19 (UP).â€”Britain,
after consultation with the United
States, will reject a Japanese peace
proposal which has been received
from Tokyo, it was understood to
night.
The contents of the Japanese note
already have been made known to
the United States, it was understood,
and Viscount Halifax, British am
bassador in Washington, will confer
with the Department of State before
this country's reply is sent to Tokyo.
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden
now is studying the Japanese com
munication, signed by Foreign
Minister Yosukc Matsuoka, and is
outlining a general statement of
the British attitude toward Japan's
suggestion that the whole world
situation is capable of mediation
and London and Washington,
therefore, should cease their mili
tary preparations in the Far East.
Parliamentary Under-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs R. A. Butler re
vealed in the House of Commons
that the government is studying the
message from Matsuoka, couched in
courteous terms and following the
lines of a statement by Koh Ishii,
Japanese spokesman, in Tokyo Tues
day that Japan stands for peace and
is prepared to mediate anywhere in
the world in an effort to restore nor
mal conditions.
