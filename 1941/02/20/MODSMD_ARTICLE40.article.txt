rugby team managed to keep iis rec
ord clean yesterday in spite of a
hard-fighting but green Santa Rosa
Junior College squad, which it man
aged to defeat by a 6-5 score.
Early in the opening period, the
Indians took the ball and on a series
of passing and dribbling rushes went
to the 25-yard line where they were
given a penalty kick. Reynolds at

point, but the kick was short and
wide.
FROSH FAIL

push the ball over Tor the score.
Santa Rosa came right back and for
several minutes menaced the Stan

field to the 20-yard line where Rey
nolds scored three points on a free
kick.
With about a minute of play re
maining in the first half, Tiernan
and Bailey of the visitors managed

The second half saw even tougher
and more ragged playing and no
scoring until the last minutes of play
when Reynolds again place-kicked
the ball for three digits on a penalty
kick.
GAME RAGGED
"As a whole the game was ragged,
rough, and not too good," stated
Coach Bob Olden. "Outstanding
among our players were Bill Kreutz
man, who was always on the ball,
and Don Bilton."
No game is scheduled for this
week-end, and the players will take
a short breather, with practice be
ing resumed next Monday afternoon.
