## Indian Mermen Splash Tonight With San Jose 
### CHUCK SMITH, Sports Editor 
Tonight the championship-bound
Indian swimmers will meet the San
Jose mermen at San Jose, in a
tocth-and-nail battle.
With the recent Y.M.C.A. victory
still fresh in their minds, the Cards
are eager to drown any and all op
ponents. Coach Charlie Walker's
San Jose boys recently defeated the
California aggregation, 39-36. If
Stanford in turn beats these victo
rious Staters, they will have the
necessary confidence to take the all -
important Cal meet.
The first event on the evening's
bill is the 300-yard relay, which be
gins at 8 o'clock. Three years ago
Bill Weeden, Roy Vitousek, and
Chuck Wiper set a new tank rec
ord for San Jose in this event and
at the same time established a na
tional freshman record of 3:10.
MAY BREAK RECORD
Tonight, the same Weeden and
Vitousek with Bob Reynolds swim
ming instead of Chuck Wiper, are
expected to break the world record
in the 300-yard medley relay.
The 220-yard freestyle will see the
renewing of a rivalry between Farm
paddlers Doc Colyear and Don
Smith, the sophomore stars. The
varsity is expected to win first and
second places in this event although
Captain Martin Wempe of San
Jose may produce plenty of compe
tition.
The 50-yard freestyle will find
Gardner Miller and Brad Young as
the Indian standard bearers. The In
dians should win the first place but
Slaff, Spartan star, might nab sec
ond.
DIVING DUEL
The fancy diving will feature a
duel between Howard Adams of
Stanford and Dave Windsor, unde
feated San Jose springboard ace.
Adams is conference diving cham
pion and his beautifully executed
dives rank him among the nation's
best.
The 100-yard freestyle will have
versatile Vitousek and Brad Young
representing Stanford. The tank
record is 54.3 and it is just pos
sible that Vitousek will beat this
time.
The 150-yard backstroke is Stan
ford's strong event. Doc Colyear won
this event in the recent "Y" meet.
Co-captain Weeden was just recov
ering from an appendectomy so was
not up to form. With the additional
two weeks training he should be
right up there with the sophomore
ace.
These events, plus the 220-yard
freestyle, 440-yard freestyle, and
400-yard freestyle relay will pro
duce a meet that will rank with the
best.
