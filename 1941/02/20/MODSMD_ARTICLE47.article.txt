# Kenealy Seals Blast Stanford Moundmen, 8-6
## 
### 
Even Carl Kellenberger's seventh
inning home run with the bases
loaded failed to stop Kenealy's Seals
as the professionals overcame a
four-run deficit and topped Stan
ford's varsity fly-chasers, 8-(i, in a
game played at Sunken Diamond
yesterday afternoon.
Kellenberger's mighty clout came
in the sevenlh inning after the Cards
had resorted to "bunt 'em silly"
tactics and had loaded the bases.
COOTIE' GOES ROUTE
Chucker Cootie Thompson strung
out the Seals' 13—hit barrage beau
tifully until the fatal eighth when
Ray Kearse singler Babe Dahlgren
doubled, his third safety of the day,
Shelly McConnell dittoed, and Ted
Jennings, San Francisco Seal third
baseman slammed a triple deep into
center field to give Kenealy's four
runs.
That big inning only tied the
game, and Dahlgren and Kearse
gave a repeat performance in the
ninth stanza to score two runs,
which was the margin of victory.
SCORELESS TILL FOURTH
The first three cantos went with
out a man getting past second base,
and it looked like a first-rate pitch
er's battle. Both clubs scored a run
in the fourth frame, Dahlgren again
hitting safely to tally on Arnold
Traxler's lofty fly to center field.
Monty Pfyl, Card shortstop, who
batted three for four, singled to right
field, went to third on a wild throw
past first base, and crossed the plate
on Cherry Ccreghino's long fly to
left field.
The sixth inning went without a
run—came the frying pan-fire story
—and that was the ball game.

Even Carl Kellenberger's seventh
inning home run with the bases
loaded failed to stop Kenealy's Seals
as the professionals overcame a
four-run deficit and topped Stan
ford's varsity fly-chasers, 8-(i, in a
game played at Sunken Diamond
yesterday afternoon.
Kellenberger's mighty clout came
in the sevenlh inning after the Cards
had resorted to "bunt 'em silly"
tactics and had loaded the bases.
COOTIE' GOES ROUTE
Chucker Cootie Thompson strung
out the Seals' 13—hit barrage beau
tifully until the fatal eighth when
Ray Kearse singler Babe Dahlgren
doubled, his third safety of the day,
Shelly McConnell dittoed, and Ted
Jennings, San Francisco Seal third
baseman slammed a triple deep into
center field to give Kenealy's four
runs.
That big inning only tied the
game, and Dahlgren and Kearse
gave a repeat performance in the
ninth stanza to score two runs,
which was the margin of victory.
SCORELESS TILL FOURTH
The first three cantos went with
out a man getting past second base,
and it looked like a first-rate pitch
er's battle. Both clubs scored a run
in the fourth frame, Dahlgren again
hitting safely to tally on Arnold
Traxler's lofty fly to center field.
Monty Pfyl, Card shortstop, who
batted three for four, singled to right
field, went to third on a wild throw
past first base, and crossed the plate
on Cherry Ccreghino's long fly to
left field.
The sixth inning went without a
run—came the frying pan-fire story
—and that was the ball game.
