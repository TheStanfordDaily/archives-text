# Cards, Cougars Lead in P.C.C.
## 
### 
While the Indians from Stanford
are maintaining their spot on the {
top of the haskcthall heap in the
Pacific Coast Conference's Southern !
Division, the Washington State Cou
gars from up Pullman way are show
ing their heels in much the same
manner in the Northern Division.
From the way things stack up
now, with the season moving into its
closing stages, the Indians and the |
Cougars are the closest things to I
sure bets on this west coast. W.S.C.
is even further out in front in its
league than Stanford is down here,
for the Cougars' closest contenders,
Oregon U,. has only won half its j
games and is 318 percentage points !
in arrears.
PLAY FOR TITLE
Unless some mighty upsets are j
pulled it looks as if Indians will play |
the Cougars for the championship of j
the Pacific Coast Conference. But
the regular league season isn't over i
yet. '
Figures given The Daily by Don
Liebendorfer yesterday reveal the
one real reason why Stanford leads
the rest of the teams in the league.
Coach Everett Dean's boys just hang
up more points on the scoreboard
than do their opponents—that's the
reason. The Indians' offensive rec
ord for the conference season
through the U.S.C.-Stanford games
last week-end is far more impres- I
sive than the records of any of the
other quintets.
CAL SECOND
The scoring parade places the
teams just in the same order as they
are rated in games won and lost,
with Stanford on top, Cal second,
and U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. bringing up
the rear. Cal's defensive record can
be attributed mainly to Ucla's of
fensive slumps every time the
Bruins have played the Bears, al
though, of course, Cal's guarding had
something to do with those skimps.
Team scoring in the Southern Di
vision follows:

Figures given The Daily by Don
Liebendorfer yesterday reveal the
one real reason why Stanford leads
the rest of the teams in the league.
Coach Everett Dean's boys just hang
up more points on the scoreboard
than do their opponents—that's the
reason. The Indians' offensive rec
ord for the conference season
through the U.S.C.-Stanford games
last week-end is far more impres- I
sive than the records of any of the
other quintets.
CAL SECOND
The scoring parade places the
teams just in the same order as they
are rated in games won and lost,
with Stanford on top, Cal second,
and U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. bringing up
the rear. Cal's defensive record can
be attributed mainly to Ucla's of
fensive slumps every time the
Bruins have played the Bears, al
though, of course, Cal's guarding had
something to do with those skimps.
Team scoring in the Southern Di
vision follows:
Pts. Pts. I
for agst. j
Stanford 353 307
California 307 271
U.S.C 304 322 |
U.C.L.A 292 356 j
While the Indians from Stanford
are maintaining their spot on the {
top of the haskcthall heap in the
Pacific Coast Conference's Southern !
Division, the Washington State Cou
gars from up Pullman way are show
ing their heels in much the same
manner in the Northern Division.
From the way things stack up
now, with the season moving into its
closing stages, the Indians and the |
Cougars are the closest things to I
sure bets on this west coast. W.S.C.
is even further out in front in its
league than Stanford is down here,
for the Cougars' closest contenders,
Oregon U,. has only won half its j
games and is 318 percentage points !
in arrears.
PLAY FOR TITLE
Unless some mighty upsets are j
pulled it looks as if Indians will play |
the Cougars for the championship of j
the Pacific Coast Conference. But
the regular league season isn't over i
yet. '
