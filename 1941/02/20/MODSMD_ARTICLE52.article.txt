# Frosh Hoopsters Prepare For Lowell, Monterey Tilts
## 
### 
Coach Beeb Lee worked his frosh
hoop charges on a fast break of
fense yesterday afternoon in the
Pavilion for the week-end's double
| header with Lowell and Monterey
j high schools.
Tuesday afternoon the Lowell In
dians smothered Lincoln High of
San Francisco and will be coming
down Friday evening riding the crest
of their fifth victory in seven starts.
Nothing is known of Monterey's
potentialities, but the boys are mak
ing a long trip for the encounter and
may bring up a surprisingly snappy

outfit.
Lee plans to use his regular first
stringers against Lowell Friday, but
he will probably start a complete
new squad against Monterey Satur
day.
Probable to see action as starters
in the Monterey tiff will be Fred
Oliver, Dick West, Bob Halstead, Bob
Wreisner, and John Brooke.

California's seventh annual Con
servation Week, stressing non
wastage of natural resources, will
be observed from March 7 to 14.
