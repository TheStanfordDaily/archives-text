# Bellwether on Snares
## 
### 
THE quivering little Underwood on the green
table in the edit office was hammering away
like mad when a long nose impaled itself upon
the window screen and a voice interrupted
abruptly with:
"Greetings, laddie. Raining out here."
"Bellwether! Come in out of the wet."
I turned beamingly toward the door just as
a heavy foot, followed abruptly by a bulbous
ankle and an interminable shank, almost suc
ceeded in severing my shoulder blades.
"Emery, must you come through the win
dow?" I mustered up a frown as I combed a
shoelace out of my hair.
The haphazard Bellwetherian bulk completed
the unique entrance and beamed happily at
me. "Oh, hello, young 'un. Did my heel brush
you?"
I glanced up at him. "A trifle, Bellwether," I
blasted ironically. It didn't work. The Sage
was already deep in the office easy chair and
almost asleep. "Hey, wake up and listen."
The Great Man stirred. "Oh, say, laddie. Got
a campaign for you to run." He flipped the new
pipe off the desk and stuffed my expensive
tobacco into it. "Good campaign."
"Good pipe, too, Bellwether. Treat it gently.
What's the campaign?"
Clouds of smoke wafted lazily from the pipe
as the Sage slumped deeper into the chair.
"Campaign against the underpass." He blew
an effulgent smoke ring. "Don't like the fool
contraption. Can't understand it."
I was stirred. "True, Emery, true. Get lost in
the maze?"
By this time the Bellwether back was deep
in the cushion and several yards of Bellwether
shank were reposing on the desk. "Know where
I am, laddie. But doesn't do any good. Want
to hear about my latest tangle with the under
pass?"
I tenderly lifted one Bellwether foot off my
"World Almanac" and leaned forward atten
tively. "Shoot, Emery, let's have it."
The Great Man took a drag on the pipe. "Was
on my way to Paly the other p.m. Steered mer
rily down toward the contraption." I raised a
questioning eyebrow. "The underpass, that is."
"Ah, yes, Bellwether."
"I steered a clear course through that Hell's
Gate Bridge and started the gentle climb on the
other side. Then remembered had business
over on some street to the right side of Uni
versity. So I took the first side cut to the right."
"Yes, Bellwether."
The Great Man grimaced. "Didn't notice the
little 'To Redwood City' sign. Few minutes
later tried to turn left into Paly. Big 'No Left
Turn' sign. Farther on a 'No Right Turn' placard.
Then a 'No Left,' 'No Right,' 'No Left,' 'No Right'
and on and on till, fighting like mad, I was car
ried in the maelstrom till finally I found myself
about three hundred yards out of Redwood
City. Then came the most unkindest cut of all."
I winced. "Yes, Bellwether."
Emery winced back. "A big sign in the
middle of the road:
"BROTHER . . .
YOU'RE PLUMBERED!"

Then a 'No Left,' 'No Right,' 'No Left,' 'No Right'
and on and on till, fighting like mad, I was car
ried in the maelstrom till finally I found myself
about three hundred yards out of Redwood
City. Then came the most unkindest cut of all."
I winced. "Yes, Bellwether."
Emery winced back. "A big sign in the
middle of the road:
"BROTHER . . .
YOU'RE PLUMBERED!"
THE quivering little Underwood on the green
table in the edit office was hammering away
like mad when a long nose impaled itself upon
the window screen and a voice interrupted
abruptly with:
"Greetings, laddie. Raining out here."
"Bellwether! Come in out of the wet."
I turned beamingly toward the door just as
a heavy foot, followed abruptly by a bulbous
ankle and an interminable shank, almost suc
ceeded in severing my shoulder blades.
"Emery, must you come through the win
dow?" I mustered up a frown as I combed a
shoelace out of my hair.
The haphazard Bellwetherian bulk completed
the unique entrance and beamed happily at
me. "Oh, hello, young 'un. Did my heel brush
you?"
I glanced up at him. "A trifle, Bellwether," I
blasted ironically. It didn't work. The Sage
was already deep in the office easy chair and
almost asleep. "Hey, wake up and listen."
The Great Man stirred. "Oh, say, laddie. Got
a campaign for you to run." He flipped the new
pipe off the desk and stuffed my expensive
tobacco into it. "Good campaign."
"Good pipe, too, Bellwether. Treat it gently.
What's the campaign?"
Clouds of smoke wafted lazily from the pipe
as the Sage slumped deeper into the chair.
"Campaign against the underpass." He blew
an effulgent smoke ring. "Don't like the fool
contraption. Can't understand it."
I was stirred. "True, Emery, true. Get lost in
the maze?"
By this time the Bellwether back was deep
in the cushion and several yards of Bellwether
shank were reposing on the desk. "Know where
I am, laddie. But doesn't do any good. Want
to hear about my latest tangle with the under
pass?"
I tenderly lifted one Bellwether foot off my
"World Almanac" and leaned forward atten
tively. "Shoot, Emery, let's have it."
The Great Man took a drag on the pipe. "Was
on my way to Paly the other p.m. Steered mer
rily down toward the contraption." I raised a
questioning eyebrow. "The underpass, that is."
"Ah, yes, Bellwether."
"I steered a clear course through that Hell's
Gate Bridge and started the gentle climb on the
other side. Then remembered had business
over on some street to the right side of Uni
versity. So I took the first side cut to the right."
"Yes, Bellwether."
The Great Man grimaced. "Didn't notice the
little 'To Redwood City' sign. Few minutes
later tried to turn left into Paly. Big 'No Left
Turn' sign. Farther on a 'No Right Turn' placard.
Then a 'No Left,' 'No Right,' 'No Left,' 'No Right'
and on and on till, fighting like mad, I was car
ried in the maelstrom till finally I found myself
about three hundred yards out of Redwood
