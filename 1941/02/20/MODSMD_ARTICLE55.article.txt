# $1,500 Compliment
## 
### 
WIDE is the fame of Stanford's name. Or
so it would seem upon looking beneath
the surface of the topical—but hardly typical—
Kay Kyser-Campus merger which was brought
to a musical climax yesterday afternoon by
bigwigs on the various and sundry Senior Prom
committees.
Part of that music will be the metallic jingling
of coins, many hundreds of dollars of them,
into the coffers of the Senior Class.
What prompted Kay Kyser to sign the dotted
line on the prom contract? Money, you say?
No, as a matter of fact the Mr. Kyser in question
was offered two contracts for that night of March
7. And, more to the point, the other contract
offered the "Cigarette" bandleader more money,
almost twice the $1,500 he will receive for play
ing a one-night stand "down on the Farm."
And, thirdly, he has never before consented

to bring his orchestra to any other west coast
university.
Perhaps then we may go so far as to assume
that this is a compliment, a compliment to the
Stanford fame, the Stanford name, and more
particularly, a compliment to you, the Stanford
students who have created and fostered this
fame and name.
Thank you, Kay Kyser, and the same to you.
—B. A.
