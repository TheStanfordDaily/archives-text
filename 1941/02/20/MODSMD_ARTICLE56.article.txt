"I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN . .
are certain signs of spring around these
days. I don't think they mean much, though. It's
too early for genuine spring and there will be more
rains and women on the Quad unbecomingly wearing
bandanas over their heads.
All these early harbingers are just fakes.
For instance, the crowd at the lake doubled yes
terday. There were eight people there instead of four.
Someone came into The Daily yesterday afternoon
and said, "I've got a swell feature for you, if you can
check on it. Someone said there were 200 ducks at
the lake this morning." A reporter bagged a stack
of copy raper and a pencil and headed for the boat
house. i don't know whether he was going to inter
view a duck, or draw a picture of one. Anyway, the
birds had disappeared and the reporter sat down some
what disconsolately to manufacture a story about the
whole sad incident.
He seemed to think it was pretty tough to trace
down 200 ducks, once they'd decided to fly away.

''J'HE woman's editor is drifting around in a dream

She's asking everyone whether or not she should have
a picture of a bride and groom. Most people seemed
to believe that spring time and weddings were not
unrelated. Her only objection was, "What'll I do for
the groom without Howard Hickingbotham?"
There's one good, secure reason why I x-efuse to
believe all these signs of spring:
There are too many Ski Accidents walking around
the Quad.

college symphony program planned by Pierre
Monteux and others for Sunday night, March 2, is
just about sold out—to the rafters. Half the crowd
will be from Stanford.
One Indian male was lured away from flimsier
pursuits by the thought of hearing that austere or
chestra, augmented by 15 extra pieces and conducted
by small, heavily-mustached M. Monteux, giving
soundly and loudly with Ravel's Bolero. So he bought
a couple of tickets.
In fact, stirred so deeply by the spirit of brotherly
love and the common bond of music that would bring
together Stanford and Cal men in the same auditorium,
he bought four tickets.
He had a good friend at Cal and, yes, he'd send
him two of the ducats. But befrn-e he dropped them
in the mail, he got to thinking over the date situa
tion. Whoinell could he take? He ran rapidly over
the list of three Stanford women he knew. They
wouldn't do.
The one he really wanted to take was that Cal fel
low's girl-friend. She went to Mills and he had ob
served her several times before and he was sure that
she would remember his name.
And so, in the same spirit of brotherly love and
co-operation between the two great universities of the
West, he wrote a special delivery letter to the girl
friend of the Cal man.
And pasted a three-cent stamp on the letter con
taining the tickets for Cal man. "Old boy, get a date
and we'll have dinner together before the symphony."
The Stanford man got a reply from Mills that said,
"Thank you so much I'd love to and so on."
He hasn't heard from the Cal man yet.
