# CAMPUS OPINION
## IT'S 1776 AGAIN 
### 
r JpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Please note correction: the dissertation on the
use of the word "any" in the Lend-Lease bill, which
you generously printed in The Daily, Feb. 12, was
copied from "America," Jan. 25, 1941. Two sentences
toward the end contained a slight omission, read from
the original as follows: "Taking the Lend-lease bill as
a whole, it seems to me that there is not ANY power
which the President does not possess. There has never
been ANY President at ANY time who held ANY
such power."
Senator Wheeler and other leaders of the opposi
tion have asked that we who are against this bill
write to Congress. Messages are being counted in
Washington. A plain postal will do. Write, "Please
vote no on bill 1776," sign and pddress to Senator
Sheridan Downey, Senate Office Building, Washing
ton, D.C.
Very truly yours,
E.R.R.
