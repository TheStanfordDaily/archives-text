r [ 'lIE EDITOR, SIR:
Our faith in Stanford women has not only been
restored, but re-enforced.
Last Friday night three cute, and unfortunately
anonymous, Stanford fems were swell enough t»o give
us a ride from Paly to the steps of Encina, in a beau
tiful car.
We were so pleased and surprised that we would
like to express our thanks to them through The Daily.
P. L„ H. P.
