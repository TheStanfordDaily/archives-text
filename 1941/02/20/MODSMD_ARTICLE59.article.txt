THE EDITOR, SIR:
This is undoubtedly jumping the gun a bit, but
I feel that a word should be said about Ex Corn's
"sweeping investigation and possible revision of Stan
ford's famous Honor Code system." As nothing has
actually been done yet, there can be no scream about
accomplished facts.
But whatinhell brought up this investigation? When
the Honor Code was put into practice a good number
of years ago it was done, I believe, on a trial basis.
I presume that the originators considered the trial a
success, for the Honor Code has been functioning with
out too many squawks for quite a spell.
My point is that under any system of taking tests,
writing papers, etc., there will be a certain amount of
cheating. The Honor Code merely leaves the choice up
to the student. He can cheat if he wants to. He can
also play ball with the vast majority if he so chooses.
It becomes a point of personal honor. Under a
proctor system, or any other "you better not cheat be
cause I've got my eyes on you" system, cheating is
no longer a point of personal honor. It becomes a game
between the individual and the spy.
The Honor Code seems to be working like a de
fense industry. If the investigation proves to us that
cheating is rampant, which I doubt, I guess the ad
ministration will just have to put the local Gestapo
to work.
Yours for a barren investigation,
