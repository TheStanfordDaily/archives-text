# Choir to Sing Allen's Anthem
## Services to Be Held For Founders' Day 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist and professor of music, has
written a new anthem for the Stan
ford Choir to be sung at the Found
ers' Day services in Memorial
Chapel March 9.
The new anthem is dedicated to
the Stanford Choir and is written on
the motto of the chapel, "Dominus
Illuminatio Mea" (The Lord Is My
Light). Although this is Dr. Allen's
quarter on leave, he has returned
from the East to take part in the
50th Anniversary celebrations, of
which the chapel service will be the
first official function.
All choir members and all those
who have ever sung in the choir are
urged to attend the choir meeting
tonight at 7:15 o'clock in the organ
gallery. Plans for the Founders' Day
services will be discussed, and be
cause of the nature of the services a
special large choir is desired.
Those who cannot come to the
choir but who wish to take part in
the services are asked to get in
touch with Dr. Allen for ap
pointments.
Dr. Allen can be reached by phone
through the 9411 exchange, Local
259, or students may call at the
Choir Room, Memorial Church.
