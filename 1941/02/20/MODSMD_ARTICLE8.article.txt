# Stuart Begins Southern Tour This Saturday
## Poli Sci Professor Starts Pan-American Good Will Expedition 
### 
Dr. Graham Stuart, Stanford pro
fessor of political science, will leave
Saturday for New York City. From
there he will embark on a two
months' tour of South America. In
his absence Edwin Dole will take
over his classes in Contemporary
World Politics. The tour is under
auspices of the Carnegie Endowment
and is to further Pan-American re
lations.
Dr. Stuart is one of ten men
chosen to make the trip. Other mem
bers of the party include several
newspaper editors, college profes
sors and deans and authorities in
the field of international relations.
Special leave has been granted Dr.
Stuart from his academic duties so
that he might accept the invitation.
PURPOSE DEFINED
The purpose of this tour is, ac
cording to Nicholas Murray Butler,
president of the Carnegie Endow
ment and Columbia University, "to
offer a small selected group ... an
opportunity to increase their knowl
edge of Latin America, to exchange
information and opinions with col
leagues there, and to bring back to
their professional work fresh op
ions gained in that way."
A former member of the Stan
ford faculty, Dr. Harold Benjamin,
now at the University of Maryland,
has also been invited to join the
group.
PLANS GIVEN
The party plans to sail from New
York on the Grace liner, Santa
Lucia on Feb. 28 and proceed to
Santiago and Valparaiso, Chile.
From there it will continue over a
large part of South America. There
is a scheduled itinerary but the
travelers will be left to follow their
own interests.
The tour will terminate in Rio de
Janeiro, from where the travelers
will sail back to New York on April
23, arriving in the United States on
May 5.
