Oh, I wish I were poetic.
My attempts are so pathetic;
But, though, hesitant, I'm bound
to do my best.
You have asked lor my reaction
And you have a real attraction
So I cannot disregard your first
request.
Oh, the things you've said have pleased
me;
And though you have oiten teased me,
It's because oi you my world is
bright and cheery.
You have given me, I own,
A thing to me, before, unknown;
Without you now my days would bo
quite dreary.
But such gladness you have brought mo
From the iirst time that you sought me
That although I've oiten thought
that I would perish
For some greater satisfaction,
You've increased your first attraction.
And everything you've said I'll
always cherish.
To hope now would be futile
(And deceit, I find, is brutal)
But you've intrigued me and I
can't deny your charm;
With you I just can't cope,
Yet each day brings me new hope!
Now—could a little bit of can
dor do us harm?—adv.
