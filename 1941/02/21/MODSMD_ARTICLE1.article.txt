# History ... 1941

### Jean Nowell 
or Thessalonika, is a
k three-fingered peninsula jutting
out into the Aegean Sea. Like a
sign-post, the index "finger" points
west toward the Dardanelles, a
little over 100 miles away.
Half-way between the two lies
Lemnos, a small Greek island. It is
this island which, according to a
Belgrade news source, the British
naval and air forces occupied yes
terday. If the British have taken
this step it can be assumed that they
did so with the knowledge and con
sent of the Greek government . .
the Battle of the Balkans is ap
proaching actuality.
During all the furor of guess and
counter-guess winch flamed when
the Turko-Bulgarian non-aggression
past was signed Athens said nothing.
And the wiry Greek soldiers in their
little skirts went right on pounding
the groggy Italian divisions in Al
bania.
If Ilitler is planning to send his
armies down through Bulgaria to
Salonika in order to force the
Greeks to make peace, he had bet
ter hurry, because the British on
Lemnos are closer to strategic
Salonika than he is.
Events seem to indicate that Eng
land is sure of her little ally's will
ingness to continue the fight, else
why the occupation of Lemnos and,
more important, Chief of Britain's
General Staff, Sir John Dill and
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden's
sudden arrival in Egypt?

r race into the Balkans is on,
and maybe, if Hitler follows his
established Balkan policy of intimi
dation and accomplishment of his
ends without carrying the war to a
new front the British may have a
chance to get a powerful force into
Greece proper and to consolidate
their defenses on Lemnos. Then, with
Crete already well fortified, their
positions for the defense of Suez
would be infinitely stronger.
Balking as best it can, Jugoslavia
is holding up Hitler's attempt to
bring all the Balkan countries under
his sway. The Jugoslavians fear
rapprochement with Germany will
put them in danger of British bomb
attacks. Hitler must get Jugoslavia
if he plans to join the Greek attack,
since the only railroad he can use
for supply transport runs from what
\ised to be Austria down through
Jugoslavia to Greece.
Turkey announced yesterday
that its Bulgarian pact docs not
hold in the event that Germany
uses Bulgaria as a base for an
attack on Greece. If the Turks do
declare war they probably would
use their army for defense pur
poses only. However, what Brit
ain wants most is the use of the
Dardanelles.
If part of the Mediterranean fleet
could get into the Black Sea and
attack Bulgaria and Rumania from
the rear, Der Fuehrer would find
himself with a rather large headache.

lOSEF STALIN again takes up his
â€¢" position as a key man. Afraid of
the Nazis and in need of their tech
nicians and equipment, he has so
far played his politics all in their
favor. But traditionally he must
keep the Dardanelles clear. Other
than the great port of Odessa in the
Ukraine he has only one ice-free
port.
This is Murmansk up in the Bar
ents Sea, and it is necessary to use
ice-breakers to get ships through
up in that frigid region. Definitely
Stalin does not want an unfriendly
power in command of his only all
year water lane. Also, a German
victory over the Turks would mean
German bombers and forces tick
lishly close to the great Baku oil
fields. If you were in Stalin's posi
tion, who would you trust?
It's to Comrade Stalin's advan
tage to keep Turkey neutral, if he
can; but in case Turkey starts fight
ing it's to his advantage to back her
to the hilt. And that would include
letting Britain into the Black Sea.
So little Turkey, in a certain sense,
has the burly Soviets over a barrel.
