# "Convoy Cops" Lead The Way
## 
### 
And now it's "convoy cops."
The latest wrinkle in so-called
government paternalism is the re
cently inaugurated State Highway
Patrol practice of convoying herds of
cars traveling the Bayshore High
way.
Here's the rub: A state motor
cycle officer finds a string of cars,
plants himself in the lead and settles
down to a steady, uncompromising
45 per. Once in the pack and,
brother, you're stuck! Just try and
get ahead.
Say you're heading for the City—
one cop picks you up at Redwood
City and takes you the distance of
two or three cities up the line, and
then another Vulture of the High
way kicks the starter and swings
in to replace his buddy—and you're
stuck for another 15 or 20 miles!
