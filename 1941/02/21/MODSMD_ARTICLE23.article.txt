WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (UP).—Senate foes of the British Aid Bill
gained a surprise adherent today when Sen. Robert R. Reynolds, D., N.C.,
said he would vote against the measure because it might lead to a United
States "declaration of war."
Reynolds' defection was offset by Sen. Harold H. Burton's announce-

>ment he favored the bill. Burton,
Ohio Republican, had been listed
among the "doubtfuls."
Reynolds revealed his stand dur
ing a three-hour blistering attack on
the pending measure, which he
labeled as an attempt to pay for
Britain's war at this country's ex
pense. His opposition came as a
surprise since, as a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, he had voted "with reservations"
to report the bill favorably to the
Senate.
For the second time In as many
days, Administration forces were
thwarted in their efforts to obtain
action on amendments when Reyn
olds limited his speech to three
hours instead of five, as originally
scheduled.
When Reynolds finished his
speech, no speakers were ready to
continue debate on the measure and
the Senate was forced to turn to
other business.
Sen. Scott W. Lucas, D., 111., intro
duced an amendment for a joint six
man Congressional committee to
consult with President Roosevelt on
Administration of the aid. The
amendment, however, would not re
quire the President to consult with
the group which would consist of
the Democratic and Republican
leaders of the House and Senate and
the chairmen of the Senate and
House committees on foreign rela
tions.
Shortly afferwards, the chamber
recessed for the day—making this
the briefest of the four days of de
bate thus far on the measure.
