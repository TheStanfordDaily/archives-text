# Indian Quintet Favored To Cop Weekend Tilts From U.C.L.A. Cagers
## Underdog Bruin Quintet Seeks Series Victory 
### DON SELBY 
Decided favorites la take a couple
of more steps on their way to the
championship of the Southern Divi
sion of the Pacific Coast Conference,
Stanford's polished basketballers
play host to the U.C.L.A. quintet in
the Pavilion tonight and tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock.
But in this hoop league sure
things just don't exist, even when
the top team is playing the outfit that
is in the cellar. So, despite the fact
that you can find but few cage fans
who would pick the Bruins to cop
even one of the games, the Indians
are far from "dead cinch" to take
both tilts.
The Bruins, the only outfit to have
copped a game from Stanford dur
ing this conference season, have
great possibilities, as the Indians be
came well aware the last time the
two teams met. But since they
knocked over the Cards, the Uclan
cagers have failed to cop a league
game, having dropped a pair to Cal
last week and one to U.S.C. the
week before.
STRONG FORWARD WALL
But to anyone who saw Jackie
Robinson and his mates nose out the
Indians by one point, these three
losses far from force the conclusion
that the Bruins haven't anything on
the ball. Wilbur Johns, Ucla cage
mentor, has an outfit with a very
strong front line as long as Robinson
and Ernie Handelsman are at for
wards and Johnny Fryer is holding
down the pivot post.
All three of these fellows are
basketball players of no mean abil
ity and they handle a very good per
centage of the Bruin scoring, Rob
inson being the second highest
scorer in the Southern Division.
Handelsman is a little fellow for a
basketballer, but he really gets
around, and he has a half-hook-half
push shot that is surprisingly accu
rate. Combine these two forwards
with tall Fryer at center and you
have a hot offensive trio, for Fryer
is an exceptional ball handler and
backboard man.
INDIAN FAST BREAK
The part of the game that may
prove too much for the Bruins to
handle is Stanford's fast break,
which played havoc with U.S.C. two
nights in a row last week-end.
This, because the Bruin guards are
not quite up to snuff, neither of
fensively nor defensively. They do
very little of Ucla's scoring and it is
doubtful if they are adept enough
on defense to handle the smooth In
dians when they break downcourt
the moment they get their hands on
the ball.
Bob Null, Bruin captain, fills one
of the guard posts regularly, but the
other spot is handled by different
fellows in different games. George
started the last time the Indians and
the Bruins met, but at Berkeley last
week-end he shared starting honors
with Curti.
While U.C.L.A. and Stanford are
battling it out here on the Farm, the
Golden Bears from Berkeley will be
having at the U.S.C. Trojans. The
Bears will definitely be playing un
der pressure, for they must win both
Trojan contests to retain even a
mathematical chance of overtaking
the Indians. And, from this corner,
it looks extremely doubtful that the
Bears can duplicate the feat they
performed earlier in the season
when they waxed U.S.C. in both
ends of a double-header.
With Alex Omalev in their line
up, the Trojans are a rejuvenated
