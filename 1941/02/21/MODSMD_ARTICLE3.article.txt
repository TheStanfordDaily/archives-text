# Eden Visits Egypt Front To Map War
## Plans Final 'Knockout' Of Italian Resistance On All Africa Fronts 
### 
CAIRO, Fcl>. 20 (UP).â€”British
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and
the chief of the British Imperial
General Stall arrived in Egypt today
as smashing drives carried British
forces across the Juba River toward
the Italian Somaliland capital of Mo
gadiscio and captured the town of
Mega in southern Ethiopia.
General Sir John Dill, chief of
the imperial staff, and Eden arrived
on their surprise visit as British
quarters asserted Italy's African em
pire is crumbling rapidly under
Britain's assaults and that "the end
is in sight."
Eden and General Dill, who came
from London by plane, may outline
strategy for a complete "knockout"
of Italian resistance in Africa and
perhaps the rushing of land and air
forces across the Mediterranean to
the Greek Balkan war front.
Not only the military situation in
Africa but "the political and mili
tary situation of all the Near and
Middle East" is involved in the visit
and their consultations here with
General Sir Archibald Wavell and
other leaders, according to one in
formed source.
