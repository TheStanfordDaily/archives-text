Thorhurn of Cul last night, but (he Hears beat Stanford <>â– !{.
Fighting in place of Johnny Ward, who is laid up with a boil, Grant
used his natural left-handed ability to full advantage, shooting in long
lightning jjibs to the face and straightening up his opponent with

hooks and uppereuts. Although
somewhat out of shape, Don finished
strong, leaving little doubt as to the
decision.
"Mouse" MaeMichael, carrying the
light from the very first, cut up
Chris Fox badly in the 155-pound
bout. MaeMichael pounded Fox into
the ropes, going to work on his op
ponent's face instead of straightening
him up with body blows. With Fox
groggy and barely hanging on, Ref
eree Jack Downey stopped the ficht
at the end of the second,
ELLIOTT DECISIONED

Mel Ellett in the 175-pound division
after Ellett had carried the first part
of-the fight. Mel changed his tactics
midway in the second round, com
ing in very low and being rocked
with cl< le-in blows. Greenwood
flicked in left jabs by twos and
threes and then straightened Mel up
with uppereuts when the Stanford

by his opponent's reach, Bob Lea

and slashed his way to a decision
over Dave Rogers of Cal in the
second light-heavy bout on the card.

In the welterweight bout, the

that Frankie did the most damage
and booed the decision.
Going down for a one-count as the
bell sounded at the end of the third,
Bronson Cooley dropped the 120-
pound duke to Jack Rogers, in a
wild battle in which both boys missed
continually with looping lefts and
rights. Downey warned Rogers twice
on low blows.

Stanford's Jim Thurmond was
belted all over the ring by the ter
rific lefts of Milt Cunha. Jim fought
on even terms with the California
boy for the first part of the bout, but
Cunha's powerful jabs won him a
c lear decision in the third round.

of a bad hand and Stanford for
feited the 127 and 135 classes.
