Figuring to win its week-end
double-header in a walk, Stanford's
mighty frosh cage squad tackles
Lowell High tonight and Monterey
High tomorrow in the prelims to the
varsity-Bruin series. Both games
start at 6:30 o'clock in the Pavilion.
The Lowell preps trounced Lin
coln Tuesday, 31-21, for their fifth
victory. A good all-around aggre
gation, the northerners will give the
locals a fair fight, but the ever pres
ent height and playing experience
advantages still hold good for the
'44 yearlings.
Coach Bceb Lee's first team will
start against Lowell, and the second
j stringers will take over against Mon
terey.
