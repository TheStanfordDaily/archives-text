### 
ISTANBUL, Feb. 20 (UP). â€” A
Turkish Foreign Office source inti
mated tonight Turkey's new non
aggression accord with Bulgaria will
be repudiated if German armed
forces are permitted to use Bulgarian
territory as a base for attacking
Greece.
If Adolf Hitler attempts to strike
across Bulgaria against Greece, it
was suggested in British quarters,
Turkey may declare war under her
alliances with Britain and Greece.
