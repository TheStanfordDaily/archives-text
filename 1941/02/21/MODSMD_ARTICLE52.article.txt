# Undefeated Stanford Ruggers To Battle U.S.C Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated rugby team, seeking their liftli win of the season,
entrains tonight for Los Angeles, where the Indians take on one of the
West rugby squads U.S.C. lias turned out in years.
A s<|iiad of 2() players in addition to Coaches Jim Wylio and Willard
Classen, Faculty Representative Harry Maloney, and Manager Ike Church-

ill, will make the trip. The Indians,
will go into tomorrow's contest as
definite favorites on the basis of
their record of four wins, one tie,
and no defeats. This record gives
the Cards undisputed possession of
the Northern California Rugby
Union leadership.
Since their first game, in which
they were tied by the University
Club, the Stanford ruggers have
played an improved brand of ball,
and have copped contests from the
Olympic Club, U.S.F., Petaluma Ath
letic Club, and then the Olympic
Club again.
Of their development this season,
Harry Maloney, advisory rugby
coach, says:
"Their playing has improved to the
point where I think that the game
against the Olympic Club last Satur
day was one of the best that I have
seen in a great many years."
Coaches Wylie and Classen are
counting on the playing of several
American football stars to play a
large part for their charges tomor
row. The speed of Pete Kmetovic,
the power of Norm Standlee, and
the kicking of Frankie Albert will
more likely have a great deal to do
with the Stanford offense.
Men who will make the trip are:
Albert, Lee Bickenbach, Al Wool,
Kmetovie, Standlee, George Jede
noff, Ducky Davis, Al Cole, Bob
Olden, Roger Laverty, Franny Mor
gan, Paul Ugrin, Pop Barnard, Chick
Orme, John Kerman, Dick Lyon,
Ned Pugh, Jake Thompson, Cam
Pierce, and Bob DeMailly.
