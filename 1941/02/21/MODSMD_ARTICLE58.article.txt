# Literary Squitch
## 
### 
IT'S a shame to have to oppose a proposal with
the damning phrase—"lt's a good idea, but it
won't work."
And it's too bad to put the squitch on the
newly proposed Stanford literary magazine. A
smooth-paper monthly magazine incorporating
the best of the Farm's general article, fiction,
poetry, and playwright talent would most satis
factorily complete the campus publications pic
ture, sadly lacking in that phase of literature.
But, it won't work.
The suggestion for a student literary maga
zine of that sort is hardly new. Soon after Sena
tor Stanford saw the doors of his University
open, students witnessed the birth of Sequoia,
the first of the Farm's so-called literary maga
zines. The publication fared well for several
years in that literary-conscious age, then in
1919, after several not-so-good years, was taken
over together with its considerable debts by the
English Club.
A rival magazine, the Press Club Pictorial,
edged its way into the campus field several
years later. Both soon wavered on the edge of
bankruptcy and in 1924 merged into the Spec
tator. This ambitious publication, shouldering
the debts of its two parental pieces, gave up the
ghost one year later. The A.S.S.U. was forced
to give them the proceeds of one reg dance to
pull them out of the red.
The next, and last, similar publication
emerged as the Stanford Literary Magazine.
This effort opened its doors in 1925 and the bill
collectors closed them in 1929.
It took another graciously proffered A.S.S.U.
Reg dance to pull them out of the financial mire.
The panorama of Farm literary magazines
ended then. The four mentioned publications,
plus several more fly-by-nights, all wound up
in financial collapse.
All publications draw their revenue from two
main sources. First is subscriptions and second
advertising income. Their expenditures include
printing, publishing, distribution, accounting
and office costs, and myriads of others.
The author of the new project estimated a
circulation of 300, each issue selling at 25 cents.
Result: income of $75.
The local advertising market is all too well
glutted, as the business manager of any campus
publication will admit. The national advertising
market is a wide one—but one that is hardly
likely to cater to a magazine with a circulation
of only 300.
Net result: Income of between $75 and $100
per month. Expenses that will likely over-reach
those figures on each issue.
The only other alternative is for the A.S.S.U.
to personally sponsor and become financially
responsible for the magazine—ready at any time
to step in with a helping pocketbook. This
would also mean that the A.S.S.U. should as
sume the initial expenditures of the organiza
tion.
This would be a marvelous solution—except
for a few minor debts already contracted by the
A.S.S.U.
One is the $270,000 bill, plus considerable in
terest payments, which the students owe on
Memorial Hall. Another is the $4,000 due on
the Boathouse.
At the University of Michigan, publications
which flop and leave mountainous debts are
chalked up to "good experience." A new liter
ary magazine starts up every year.
Until Stanford can do that we'd best stay out
of the field.

the debts of its two parental pieces, gave up the
ghost one year later. The A.S.S.U. was forced
to give them the proceeds of one reg dance to
pull them out of the red.
The next, and last, similar publication
emerged as the Stanford Literary Magazine.
This effort opened its doors in 1925 and the bill
collectors closed them in 1929.
It took another graciously proffered A.S.S.U.
Reg dance to pull them out of the financial mire.
The panorama of Farm literary magazines
ended then. The four mentioned publications,
plus several more fly-by-nights, all wound up
in financial collapse.
All publications draw their revenue from two
main sources. First is subscriptions and second
advertising income. Their expenditures include
printing, publishing, distribution, accounting
and office costs, and myriads of others.
The author of the new project estimated a
circulation of 300, each issue selling at 25 cents.
Result: income of $75.
The local advertising market is all too well
glutted, as the business manager of any campus
publication will admit. The national advertising
market is a wide one—but one that is hardly
likely to cater to a magazine with a circulation
of only 300.
Net result: Income of between $75 and $100
per month. Expenses that will likely over-reach
those figures on each issue.
The only other alternative is for the A.S.S.U.
to personally sponsor and become financially
responsible for the magazine—ready at any time
to step in with a helping pocketbook. This
would also mean that the A.S.S.U. should as
sume the initial expenditures of the organiza
tion.
This would be a marvelous solution—except
for a few minor debts already contracted by the
A.S.S.U.
One is the $270,000 bill, plus considerable in
terest payments, which the students owe on
Memorial Hall. Another is the $4,000 due on
the Boathouse.
At the University of Michigan, publications
which flop and leave mountainous debts are
chalked up to "good experience." A new liter
ary magazine starts up every year.
Until Stanford can do that we'd best stay out
of the field.
IT'S a shame to have to oppose a proposal with
the damning phrase—"lt's a good idea, but it
won't work."
And it's too bad to put the squitch on the
newly proposed Stanford literary magazine. A
smooth-paper monthly magazine incorporating
the best of the Farm's general article, fiction,
poetry, and playwright talent would most satis
factorily complete the campus publications pic
ture, sadly lacking in that phase of literature.
But, it won't work.
The suggestion for a student literary maga
zine of that sort is hardly new. Soon after Sena
tor Stanford saw the doors of his University
open, students witnessed the birth of Sequoia,
the first of the Farm's so-called literary maga
zines. The publication fared well for several
years in that literary-conscious age, then in
1919, after several not-so-good years, was taken
over together with its considerable debts by the
English Club.
A rival magazine, the Press Club Pictorial,
edged its way into the campus field several
years later. Both soon wavered on the edge of
bankruptcy and in 1924 merged into the Spec
