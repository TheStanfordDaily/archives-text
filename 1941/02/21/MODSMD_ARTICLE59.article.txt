# Trojan Feet of Clay

### 
MUCH has been said in the past about the
apathetic attitude of Stanford students to
ward the world beyond the north end of Palm
Drive, but never has the accusation been made
that Stanford students did not take a vigorous,
wholehearted attitude toward their own demo

cratic self-government.
At least in recent years Stanford has not had
to dismiss high elected student officials because
they would take no interest in their duties.
It might be thought, since such is the way at
Stanford, that the same situation exists at all
other universities.
But a recent editorial in the Daily Trojan
shows us this is far from true.
From it we learn that two members of the
S.C. Senate, the senior class president and the
athletic council chairman, had to be relieved of
their duties because they failed to show up at
Senate meetings.
Editor Stanley Gortikov brought out the fact
that frequent defense for non-attendance at such
meetings is that nothing is ever done.
Picture, if you can, Stanford's Excom without
a docket filled with Convalescent Home Drive,
World Affairs Day, Finnish Relief, Constitution
revisions, and the like. And hardly a Tuesday
night goes by without every seat around the
Excom table filled with a competent student offi
cer with ideas on how to better Stanford and the
functions of the A.S.S.U.
Maybe it's the environment which is respon
sible for this interest in student activities—or
maybe it's just the brand of student.—C. B.
