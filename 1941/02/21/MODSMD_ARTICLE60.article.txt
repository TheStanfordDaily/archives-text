### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
BY WAV OF THE HIGH SEAS
A ROUND the end of the envelope had been pasted
a narrow, half-inch wide strip of paper to seal the
contents. In black Gothic letters were printed the
words, "Opened by Examiner 4590."
This is the way letters arrive from the Continent
and from England these days. The first one we saw
came to a Stanford student the other* day from one
of his masters at an English prep school.
The quiet, even story that followed wasn't filled
with descriptions of flaming cities and stuffy bomb
shelters, of death from grey, wintery skies. It was the
chronicle of war-time in the hinterland—how a na
tion, internally, reacted to military pressure.
"I must assure you of one thing which I find almost
incredible and if I were in a foreign country and de
pendent on censored news would flatly disbelieve, and
that is the sang froid of the natives of the island,
especially those in heavily attacked areas.
"I haven't been in any of these myself, but I've
seen people evacuated from them galore, and the boast
ing of what I might call 'bebombedness' is grotesque,"
he wrote.

44 r r , HE very gap in time between your last letter and
the present has made some of your phrases odd
reading—for instance, you said then, 'most Americans
have an idea that the French will do all the dirty
work, while, as usual, the English will take the credit.'
"I'm not tossing this in your teeth; on the contrary.
I was inclined to agree with you then, but it prompts
me to wonder what Stanford, and California in gen
eral, are thinking now.
"Believe me, the United States and California espe
cially seems to me God's own country. All of it, even
apart from the climate and the girls, apart from its
intense interest—fills me with a nostalgia for a sane
continent.
"The mind boggles at an imaginative picture of post
war Europe . . . What can we do with it after it's
conquered?"
