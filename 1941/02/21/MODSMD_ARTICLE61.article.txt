CONSIDERATION NEEDED

NEW IDOLATRY

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Not always worth fighting for is the status quo,
but Stanford's Honor Code is one thing that should not
be changed in any way without the most careful con
sideration.
Of minor importance is the "unfavorable publicity"
which results when any school finds it necessary to
modify or abandon such a code. Far more serious
questions are involved.
The Stanford Honor Code is more than famous; it
is almost unbelievable to students at some other uni
versities. It is something of which Stanford students
have a right to be proud.
Should the immediate ill efTccts on the validity of
grades, caused by cheating on the part of some, be
allowed to outweigh the lasting good which comes to
those who learn what honor means by being trusted
by students and faculty members alike?
Faculty protests are given as the reason for a pro
posed move to change the code. Paradoxically, it will
be the honest students, the ones with the highest
grades, who will support any changes, seeing only the
immediate gain of higher grades through lower class
averages, not realizing their greater loss.
For it is the honest students who gain the most
under the honor code; the dishonest ones who lose.
Under other systems the best cheaters will forge to
the top and the honest ones, being out of practice, will
fall behind as the situation reverses itself.
It is the complete trust and confidence—not re
stricted to classrooms alone—which, placed on each
student, give the Stanford Honor Code real value to
those who observe it.
Any modification, no matter how slight—no exams
to be taken from the room—will vitiate the code and
make it meaningless. The word "honor" becomes a
mockery.
Conditions in many schools operating under other
systems illustrate the point. To improve a grade you
need only cheat the proctor. At Stanford you must
cheat yourself and your friends.
Can certain professors believe it is worth sacrific
ing the spirit of the honor code for a mess of pottage—
or to keep a few cheaters from getting some worthless
grade-points?
There can be no compromise with honor—and be
sides, the words Stanford and Honor sound well to
gether.

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
I. too, want to bo in fashion and admire the
words of our latest official idol. And I quote:
"The disproportion between the quarrels of na
tions and the suffering which fighting out those quar
rels involves; the poor and barren prizes which re
ward sublime endeavor on the battlefield; the fleeting
triumphs of war; the long, slow rebuilding: the awful
risks so hardly run; the doom missed by a hair's
breadth ... all this should make the prevention of
another great war the main preoccupation of mankind.
. . . Next time the competition may be to kill women
and children, and the civil population generally, and
victory will give herself in sorry nuptials to the dili
gent hero who organizes it on the largest scale." -WIN
