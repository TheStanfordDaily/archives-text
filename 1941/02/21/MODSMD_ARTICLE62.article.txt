Saturday at the Palo Alto Community Theater.
Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's play, "The Enchanted Cottage," is a fanciful
drama about the transformation which comes to two people when they
fall in love. The boy, who was deformed in the World War, and his

bride, a homely village girl, become,
beautiful to each other and the trag
edy and the climax of the play is
in the moment that their dreams are
shattered when someone tells them it
is only an illusion.
David Manning as the war victim
got wonderful contrast into his role.
He was very real as the deformed
man whose life is broken, and he
seemed to convey his state of mind
to the audience.
But the one who showed the great
est change was Alta Bell Coopman
as Laura, the bride. She was com
pletely shy and retiring and when
she became beautiful she was al
most radiant.
Doris Church and Robert Lowery
added a good bit of comedy as the
Reverend and his "expecting" wile,
while Cli/f Giffin did an excellent
job as the blind Major Hillgrove
