IJOUGH, tough Benito Mussolini,
the realist, faced a few facts in
Rome yesterday, but he came
through the painful experience with
his chest, 'chin, and ego well to the
fore—as ever.
"We are not like the English," he
told a Blackshirt pep rally. "We call
bread bread, and wine wine."
This was all build-up for the
statement that "our Tenth Army (in
eastern Libya) has been destroyed,
and our Fifth Air Squadron has
been destroyed." After this straight
from-the-shoulder revelation, he
took a deep breath and added that,
since he had made this statement, it
was useless for the English to "ex
aggerate the facts." *
According to Signor Mussolini,
the Tenth Army numbered 10 di
visions, or about 170,000 men, in
cluding native Libyan warriors.
That should leave approximately
240,000 olTicers and soldiers in the
Fifth Army (also in Libya) still
milling '"»ui the desert dunes.
The British na>* estimated that the
army they shattered numbered about
250,000 men, from which the Army
of the Nile claimed to have taken
more than 125,000 prisoners. Per
haps this is the solution to the Ital
ian "overpopulation" problem.

HP HE military reverses of recent
months "exasperates our will
and must intensify our hate . . . hate
is indispensable for final victory . . .

real working Italians must not be
misled by a few anti-social people
who complain about the rations," he
declared.

Apparently someone in Italy is
annoyed with the food, and some
one else can see no point in hating
the Greeks or the British. That
Mussolini thought it necessary to
mention these elements may mean
that they are a sizeable part of the
population — perhaps more than
can he muzzled. Maybe several
"anti-social" Italians will climb off
the dime and hold themselves a
revolution.

Turning to his mystic comrade-in
arms, Herr Hitler, the pragmatic
Duce asserted:

"No matter what happens, Italy
will march beside Germany to the
end; the Fuehrer's offer to collabo
rate in the Mediterranean with air
and amored detachments has proved
this . . . the co-operation between
Italy and Germany is sincere and
lets foreigners know that the com
portment of the German soldiers in
Libya and Sicily is perfect and
worthy of them."

r was a nice little compli
ment to the man who is coming
to snatch Mussolini's Albanian
chestnuts. As far as the Duce is
concerned, '"Italy is awaiting the
spring to force the capitulation of
Greece." Come spring, the Nazis
will probably be in a nice position
for Italy to force that capitulation.
Interesting, in view of certain
other of the day's developments,
was his remark that "Russia's
fundamental interests lead her to
continue good relations with the
Axis."
In Moscow yesterday, Defense
Commissar Marshal Semyon Timo
.shenko said that Russia's armed
forces stand ready at a moment's
notice to "annihilate anyone violat
ing our sacred frontiers." The heads
of the Red Army and Navy joined
the Commissar in the statement that
both defense units are in tip top
shape and have "expanded enor
mously."

r British have been on the
Russian frontier down in India
for years now, but the only people
who have been worried about it are
(he British. Hitler is a newcomer to
the Russian borders.

Mussolini also mentioned that
one of his enemies had been liqui
dated (i.e., France). But the liqui
dated enemy may be aide to make
him writhe just a little if yester
day's report from Vichy is correct.

If Mussolini wants to evacuate
some 80,000 Italian civilian colonists
into French Tunisia, he'll give back
the French Riviera and Alpine ter
ritories. This, of course, will be nec
essary if the Army of the Nile goes
on to clean up Tripoli.

through the painful experience with
his chest, 'chin, and ego well to the

"We are not like the English," he
told a Blackshirt pep rally. "We call
bread bread, and wine wine."
This was all build-up for the
statement that "our Tenth Army (in
eastern Libya) has been destroyed,
and our Fifth Air Squadron has
been destroyed." After this straight
from-the-shoulder revelation, he
took a deep breath and added that,
since he had made this statement, it
was useless for the English to "ex
aggerate the facts." *
According to Signor Mussolini,
the Tenth Army numbered 10 di
visions, or about 170,000 men, in
cluding native Libyan warriors.
That should leave approximately
240,000 olTicers and soldiers in the
Fifth Army (also in Libya) still
milling '"»ui the desert dunes.
The British na>* estimated that the
army they shattered numbered about
250,000 men, from which the Army
of the Nile claimed to have taken
more than 125,000 prisoners. Per
haps this is the solution to the Ital
ian "overpopulation" problem.

months "exasperates our will

declared.

Apparently someone in Italy is
annoyed with the food, and some
one else can see no point in hating
the Greeks or the British. That
Mussolini thought it necessary to
mention these elements may mean
that they are a sizeable part of the
population — perhaps more than
can he muzzled. Maybe several
"anti-social" Italians will climb off
the dime and hold themselves a
revolution.

Turning to his mystic comrade-in

"No matter what happens, Italy
will march beside Germany to the

Italy and Germany is sincere and

Libya and Sicily is perfect and
worthy of them."

chestnuts. As far as the Duce is

In Moscow yesterday, Defense
Commissar Marshal Semyon Timo
.shenko said that Russia's armed
forces stand ready at a moment's
notice to "annihilate anyone violat
ing our sacred frontiers." The heads
of the Red Army and Navy joined
the Commissar in the statement that
both defense units are in tip top
shape and have "expanded enor
mously."

r British have been on the
Russian frontier down in India
for years now, but the only people
who have been worried about it are
(he British. Hitler is a newcomer to
the Russian borders.

Mussolini also mentioned that
one of his enemies had been liqui
dated (i.e., France). But the liqui
dated enemy may be aide to make
him writhe just a little if yester
day's report from Vichy is correct.

If Mussolini wants to evacuate
some 80,000 Italian civilian colonists
into French Tunisia, he'll give back
the French Riviera and Alpine ter
ritories. This, of course, will be nec
essary if the Army of the Nile goes
on to clean up Tripoli.
IJOUGH, tough Benito Mussolini,
the realist, faced a few facts in
Rome yesterday, but he came
through the painful experience with
his chest, 'chin, and ego well to the
fore—as ever.
"We are not like the English," he
told a Blackshirt pep rally. "We call
bread bread, and wine wine."
This was all build-up for the
statement that "our Tenth Army (in
eastern Libya) has been destroyed,
and our Fifth Air Squadron has
been destroyed." After this straight
from-the-shoulder revelation, he
took a deep breath and added that,
since he had made this statement, it
was useless for the English to "ex
aggerate the facts." *
According to Signor Mussolini,
the Tenth Army numbered 10 di
visions, or about 170,000 men, in
cluding native Libyan warriors.
That should leave approximately
240,000 olTicers and soldiers in the
Fifth Army (also in Libya) still
milling '"»ui the desert dunes.
The British na>* estimated that the
army they shattered numbered about
250,000 men, from which the Army
of the Nile claimed to have taken
more than 125,000 prisoners. Per
haps this is the solution to the Ital
ian "overpopulation" problem.

HP HE military reverses of recent
months "exasperates our will
and must intensify our hate . . . hate
is indispensable for final victory . . .

real working Italians must not be
misled by a few anti-social people
who complain about the rations," he
declared.

Apparently someone in Italy is
annoyed with the food, and some
one else can see no point in hating
the Greeks or the British. That
Mussolini thought it necessary to
mention these elements may mean
that they are a sizeable part of the
population — perhaps more than
can he muzzled. Maybe several
"anti-social" Italians will climb off
the dime and hold themselves a
revolution.

Turning to his mystic comrade-in
arms, Herr Hitler, the pragmatic
Duce asserted:

"No matter what happens, Italy
will march beside Germany to the
end; the Fuehrer's offer to collabo
rate in the Mediterranean with air
and amored detachments has proved
this . . . the co-operation between
Italy and Germany is sincere and
lets foreigners know that the com
portment of the German soldiers in
Libya and Sicily is perfect and
worthy of them."

r was a nice little compli
ment to the man who is coming
to snatch Mussolini's Albanian
chestnuts. As far as the Duce is
concerned, '"Italy is awaiting the
spring to force the capitulation of
Greece." Come spring, the Nazis
will probably be in a nice position
for Italy to force that capitulation.
Interesting, in view of certain
other of the day's developments,
was his remark that "Russia's
fundamental interests lead her to
continue good relations with the
Axis."
