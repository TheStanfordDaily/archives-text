# Puns, Pet Lions Enliven Visits For 1941 Family Call Solicitors
## 
### 
"Mr. Smith, we arc from Stanford University. May we have a few
minutes of your time?"
But the few minutes in question usually turn out to he much longer,
according to the student couples who have just completed the 1941 "Family
Call," hy personally visiting over fiOO homes of alumni and friends of

,the University living from Bur
lingame to Los Altos.
By Friday afternoon, the amount
collected by students of the Family
Call totaled $550. Since most dona
tions come by mail or personally,
this represents only a fraction of the
total which will be received in the
whole drive.
CALLS NOT COMPLETE
According to Bob Newell, head of
the drive, not more than one-third
of the couples completed their calls.
"It is important," he said, "that those
students who have not completed
their rounds do so as soon as pos
sible."
"Our calls took from half an hour
to two hours," a freshman couple
reports. "And was it fun! Or should
I say, 'Was it pun,' for in one house
we spent over an hour just seeing
who could out-pun the other. This
alumnus was rather young, however,
and other calls were more serious,"
the Roble member of the team added.
VARIED CONVERSATIONS
One sophomore man reports that
invariably the alumni would rem
inisce. "One in Redwood City really
was funny telling of the time he
swiped the Dean's horses and an
other told how at the end of each
quarter all men in Encina would
throw all the furniture out the win
dow and about blow up the place
with gun powder."
Most callers tell of spending in
teresting hours discussing every
thing from the Rose Bowl game to
the European War, but the conver
sations usually began or ended with
Stanford and its problems.
Those friends and alumni unfa
miliar with Stanford's financial
problem were greatly surprised that
the endowment is becoming more
and more inadequate, according to
many of the callers.
And the real old-timers were
amazed at the tuition students now
Pay.
Although returns are as yet in
complete, this year's Call promises to
be very successful — financially and
in experience for the 120 callers.

That is, except for one couple who
were more than a little worried
throughout their calls, for their last
visit was at an Atherton estate. On
this prospect cards was written:
"Find out if their pet lion roams
around loose."

"Our calls took from half an hour
to two hours," a freshman couple
reports. "And was it fun! Or should
I say, 'Was it pun,' for in one house
we spent over an hour just seeing

other told how at the end of each

according to the student couples who have just completed the 1941 "Family
Call," hy personally visiting over fiOO homes of alumni and friends of

By Friday afternoon, the amount
collected by students of the Family
