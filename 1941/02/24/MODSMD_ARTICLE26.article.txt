# Stanford Cagers Cinch Expected P.C.C. Crown By Double Uclan Defeat
## Even Subs Run Riot Over Swamped Bruins In 49-44, 56-34 Wins 
### DON SELBY 
Stanford's red hot caeers did so
nany things this past week-end that
it is impossible to put it all in the
beginning of tlis story, but their
most important feats were as fol
lows:
1. They defeated U.C.L.A. both
Friday and Saturday nights by
scores of 49-44 and 56-34.
2. They sewed up the Southern
Division P.C.C. championship.
3. Don Burness, brilliant Indian
center, i-etained his lead in the
P.C.C. scoring race, although his

closest competitor, Jackie Robinson,
managed to outscore him by two
points over the week-end.

Stanford turned in about five min
utes of as classy basketball as
been played in the Pavilion since the
exit of the immortal Hank Luisetti
to practically blow U.C.L.A. off the
court at the start of the second half
of Friday night's basketball game,
and from there on in it was a breeze
for the Indians.

This spurt, which came when
Stanford took the court right after
the intermission, found the Indians
stretching their half-time lead of
4 points to 15 points, their largest
lead of the game, in so short a time
that the Bruins were dizzy from
watching the white-shirted Redskins
toss the ball through the hoop.

Co-captain Kenny Davidson
started the scoring parade with a
lay-in on a fast break, and Bob
Penn, subbing for Fordy Anderson
at forward, followed up with a tip
in bucket on another fast break.
DAVIDSON COMES BACK
Following Ernie Handelsman's
tally for the Bruins, their only
score during the Indian spree, Dav
idson came back to tank a push shot
from about 10 feet out, Co-captain
Don Williams tallied from the cor
ner, Penn popped a free throw, and
Bill Cowden scored twice on lay-ins
and followed with a charity toss.
Then the Indians finally let up and
gave the Bruins a chance to look
around a bit, but it was too late for
the Westwooders to do anything
about it, and, despite a series of
baskets by Robinson, Handelsman,
and Roger Hillis with about three
minutes to go, the Bruins were never
again in the ball game.
This Stanford win, coupled with
U.S.C.'s 51-36 walloping of Cal in
the Southland Friday night, assured
the Indians of at least a tie for the
championship; and when they took
the Bruins down the line Saturday
night, the crown was already in the
bag, Troy's second victory over the
Bears, 57-47, only serving to
stretch the margin between Stanford
and California in the conference
standings,
NO DOUBT
The Saturday night affair wasn't
a game at all, unless you just
wanted to see how smooth the Stan
ford quintet could play, for Ucla
had shot its bolt and there wasn't
any doubt as to the outcome of the
game after the first ten minutes.
The Bruins only led at one point
in the entire tussle—that when Er
nie Handelsman popped a 25-foot
set shot to start the game's scoring.
