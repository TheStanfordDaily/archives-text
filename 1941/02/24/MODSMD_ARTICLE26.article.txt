# Stanford Cagers Cinch Expected P.C.C. Crown By Double Uclan Defeat
## Even Subs Run Riot Over Swamped Bruins In 49-44, 56-34 Wins 
### DON SELBY 
Stanford's red hot caeers did so
nany things this past week-end that
it is impossible to put it all in the
beginning of tlis story, but their
most important feats were as fol
lows:
1. They defeated U.C.L.A. both
Friday and Saturday nights by
scores of 49-44 and 56-34.
2. They sewed up the Southern
Division P.C.C. championship.
3. Don Burness, brilliant Indian
center, i-etained his lead in the
P.C.C. scoring race, although his

closest competitor, Jackie Robinson,
managed to outscore him by two
points over the week-end.

Stanford turned in about five min
utes of as classy basketball as
been played in the Pavilion since the
exit of the immortal Hank Luisetti
to practically blow U.C.L.A. off the
court at the start of the second half
of Friday night's basketball game,
and from there on in it was a breeze
for the Indians.

This spurt, which came when
Stanford took the court right after
the intermission, found the Indians
stretching their half-time lead of
4 points to 15 points, their largest
lead of the game, in so short a time
that the Bruins were dizzy from
watching the white-shirted Redskins
toss the ball through the hoop.

Co-captain Kenny Davidson
started the scoring parade with a
lay-in on a fast break, and Bob
Penn, subbing for Fordy Anderson
at forward, followed up with a tip
in bucket on another fast break.
DAVIDSON COMES BACK
Following Ernie Handelsman's
tally for the Bruins, their only
score during the Indian spree, Dav
idson came back to tank a push shot
from about 10 feet out, Co-captain
Don Williams tallied from the cor
ner, Penn popped a free throw, and
Bill Cowden scored twice on lay-ins
and followed with a charity toss.
Then the Indians finally let up and
gave the Bruins a chance to look
around a bit, but it was too late for
the Westwooders to do anything
about it, and, despite a series of
baskets by Robinson, Handelsman,
and Roger Hillis with about three
minutes to go, the Bruins were never
again in the ball game.
This Stanford win, coupled with
U.S.C.'s 51-36 walloping of Cal in
the Southland Friday night, assured
the Indians of at least a tie for the
championship; and when they took
the Bruins down the line Saturday
night, the crown was already in the
bag, Troy's second victory over the
Bears, 57-47, only serving to
stretch the margin between Stanford
and California in the conference
standings,
NO DOUBT
The Saturday night affair wasn't
a game at all, unless you just
wanted to see how smooth the Stan
ford quintet could play, for Ucla
had shot its bolt and there wasn't
any doubt as to the outcome of the
game after the first ten minutes.
The Bruins only led at one point
in the entire tussle—that when Er
nie Handelsman popped a 25-foot
set shot to start the game's scoring.
But the spectacular Indian fast
break sent Davidson under the
bucket for the tying tally, and. when
Anderson dropped two free throws
through the net a minute later, the
Indians had a lead which they held
throughout the rest of the game.
Tin? Indians had plenty of finesse
Saturday night, and the way they
used it had the Bruins going around
in circles.
Once again much of the credit
has to be given to the clever ball
handling of Fordy Anderson, who
did all the lead work on the fast
breaks. In addition, he hit the hoop
for 11 points to take second place
in the scoring parade to Don Bur
ness, whose lf> points gave him a 3-
point lead over Robinson in the
P.C.C. scoring battle. Burness' total
for the conference season to date is
10(5 points.
SCORE TALKS
The score—Stanford SG, U.C.L.A.
34—shows how much of a walkaway
Saturday night's game was, but it
doesn't begin to tell the story of he
easy manner in which the Cards
turned the trick. Ten minutes after
the start of the game, Stanford was
out in front by 13 points at 17-4,
with most of the Indians' buckets
coming on easy lay-in shots from
either fast breaks or clever maneu
vering against a set defense. Mean
while, the zone defense employed by
Coach Everett Dean's charges kept
the Bruins way out wide, which ac
counts for the poor percentage of
shots made by the Westwooders.
Both games saw a multitude of
fouls called, but Officials Lloyd
Leith and Bob Britt kept the games
well under control, especially the
Saturday night affair, from which
both U.C.L.A.'s Jack Robinson and
Stanford's Kenny Davidson were
banished on four personal fouls.
ROBINSON BRILLIANT
Jackie Robinson was brilliant for
the Bruins Friday night, but he faded
in the second tussle and so did
U.C.LA. Stanford, on the other
hand, could always count on some
one to do the scoring. It was just a
matter of laying the ball on the edge
of the hoop the way the Indians
were setting up the plays. Williams,
Davidson, and Cowden rang up most
of the points for Stanford Friday
night, and Saturday night it was
Burness' and Anderson's turn and
they did a thorough job.

breaks. In addition, he hit the hoop
for 11 points to take second place
in the scoring parade to Don Bur
ness, whose lf> points gave him a 3-
point lead over Robinson in the
P.C.C. scoring battle. Burness' total
for the conference season to date is
10(5 points.
SCORE TALKS
The score—Stanford SG, U.C.L.A.
34—shows how much of a walkaway
Saturday night's game was, but it
doesn't begin to tell the story of he
easy manner in which the Cards
turned the trick. Ten minutes after
the start of the game, Stanford was
out in front by 13 points at 17-4,
with most of the Indians' buckets
coming on easy lay-in shots from
either fast breaks or clever maneu
vering against a set defense. Mean
while, the zone defense employed by
Coach Everett Dean's charges kept
the Bruins way out wide, which ac
counts for the poor percentage of
shots made by the Westwooders.
Both games saw a multitude of
fouls called, but Officials Lloyd
Leith and Bob Britt kept the games
well under control, especially the
Saturday night affair, from which
both U.C.L.A.'s Jack Robinson and
Stanford's Kenny Davidson were
banished on four personal fouls.
ROBINSON BRILLIANT
Jackie Robinson was brilliant for
the Bruins Friday night, but he faded
in the second tussle and so did
U.C.LA. Stanford, on the other
hand, could always count on some
one to do the scoring. It was just a
matter of laying the ball on the edge
of the hoop the way the Indians
were setting up the plays. Williams,
Davidson, and Cowden rang up most
of the points for Stanford Friday
night, and Saturday night it was
Burness' and Anderson's turn and
they did a thorough job.
Stanford's red hot caeers did so
nany things this past week-end that
it is impossible to put it all in the
beginning of tlis story, but their
most important feats were as fol
lows:
1. They defeated U.C.L.A. both
Friday and Saturday nights by
scores of 49-44 and 56-34.
2. They sewed up the Southern
Division P.C.C. championship.
3. Don Burness, brilliant Indian
center, i-etained his lead in the
P.C.C. scoring race, although his

closest competitor, Jackie Robinson,
managed to outscore him by two
points over the week-end.

Stanford turned in about five min
utes of as classy basketball as
been played in the Pavilion since the
exit of the immortal Hank Luisetti
to practically blow U.C.L.A. off the
court at the start of the second half
of Friday night's basketball game,
and from there on in it was a breeze
for the Indians.

This spurt, which came when
Stanford took the court right after
the intermission, found the Indians
stretching their half-time lead of
4 points to 15 points, their largest
lead of the game, in so short a time
that the Bruins were dizzy from
watching the white-shirted Redskins
toss the ball through the hoop.

Co-captain Kenny Davidson
started the scoring parade with a
lay-in on a fast break, and Bob
Penn, subbing for Fordy Anderson
at forward, followed up with a tip
in bucket on another fast break.
DAVIDSON COMES BACK
Following Ernie Handelsman's
tally for the Bruins, their only
score during the Indian spree, Dav
idson came back to tank a push shot
from about 10 feet out, Co-captain
Don Williams tallied from the cor
ner, Penn popped a free throw, and
Bill Cowden scored twice on lay-ins
and followed with a charity toss.
Then the Indians finally let up and
gave the Bruins a chance to look
around a bit, but it was too late for
the Westwooders to do anything
about it, and, despite a series of
baskets by Robinson, Handelsman,
and Roger Hillis with about three
minutes to go, the Bruins were never
again in the ball game.
This Stanford win, coupled with
U.S.C.'s 51-36 walloping of Cal in
the Southland Friday night, assured
the Indians of at least a tie for the
championship; and when they took
the Bruins down the line Saturday
night, the crown was already in the
bag, Troy's second victory over the
Bears, 57-47, only serving to
stretch the margin between Stanford
and California in the conference
standings,
NO DOUBT
The Saturday night affair wasn't
a game at all, unless you just
wanted to see how smooth the Stan
ford quintet could play, for Ucla
had shot its bolt and there wasn't
any doubt as to the outcome of the
game after the first ten minutes.
The Bruins only led at one point
in the entire tussle—that when Er
nie Handelsman popped a 25-foot
set shot to start the game's scoring.
But the spectacular Indian fast
break sent Davidson under the
bucket for the tying tally, and. when
Anderson dropped two free throws
through the net a minute later, the
Indians had a lead which they held
throughout the rest of the game.
Tin? Indians had plenty of finesse
Saturday night, and the way they
used it had the Bruins going around
in circles.
Once again much of the credit
has to be given to the clever ball
handling of Fordy Anderson, who
did all the lead work on the fast
breaks. In addition, he hit the hoop
for 11 points to take second place
in the scoring parade to Don Bur

gave the Bruins a chance to look
around a bit, but it was too late for
the Westwooders to do anything
about it, and, despite a series of
baskets by Robinson, Handelsman,
and Roger Hillis with about three
minutes to go, the Bruins were never
again in the ball game.
This Stanford win, coupled with
U.S.C.'s 51-36 walloping of Cal in
the Southland Friday night, assured
the Indians of at least a tie for the
championship; and when they took
the Bruins down the line Saturday
night, the crown was already in the
bag, Troy's second victory over the
Bears, 57-47, only serving to
stretch the margin between Stanford
and California in the conference
standings,
NO DOUBT
The Saturday night affair wasn't
a game at all, unless you just
wanted to see how smooth the Stan
ford quintet could play, for Ucla
had shot its bolt and there wasn't
any doubt as to the outcome of the
game after the first ten minutes.
The Bruins only led at one point
in the entire tussle—that when Er
nie Handelsman popped a 25-foot
set shot to start the game's scoring.
But the spectacular Indian fast
break sent Davidson under the
bucket for the tying tally, and. when
Anderson dropped two free throws
through the net a minute later, the
Indians had a lead which they held
throughout the rest of the game.
Tin? Indians had plenty of finesse
Saturday night, and the way they
used it had the Bruins going around
in circles.
Once again much of the credit
has to be given to the clever ball
handling of Fordy Anderson, who
did all the lead work on the fast
breaks. In addition, he hit the hoop
for 11 points to take second place
in the scoring parade to Don Bur
ness, whose lf> points gave him a 3-
point lead over Robinson in the
P.C.C. scoring battle. Burness' total
for the conference season to date is
10(5 points.
SCORE TALKS
The score—Stanford SG, U.C.L.A.
34—shows how much of a walkaway
Saturday night's game was, but it
doesn't begin to tell the story of he
easy manner in which the Cards
turned the trick. Ten minutes after
the start of the game, Stanford was
out in front by 13 points at 17-4,
with most of the Indians' buckets
coming on easy lay-in shots from
either fast breaks or clever maneu
vering against a set defense. Mean
while, the zone defense employed by
Coach Everett Dean's charges kept
the Bruins way out wide, which ac
counts for the poor percentage of
shots made by the Westwooders.
Both games saw a multitude of
fouls called, but Officials Lloyd
Leith and Bob Britt kept the games
well under control, especially the
Saturday night affair, from which
both U.C.L.A.'s Jack Robinson and
Stanford's Kenny Davidson were
banished on four personal fouls.
ROBINSON BRILLIANT
Jackie Robinson was brilliant for
the Bruins Friday night, but he faded
in the second tussle and so did
U.C.LA. Stanford, on the other
hand, could always count on some
one to do the scoring. It was just a
matter of laying the ball on the edge
of the hoop the way the Indians
were setting up the plays. Williams,
Davidson, and Cowden rang up most
of the points for Stanford Friday
night, and Saturday night it was
Burness' and Anderson's turn and
they did a thorough job.
Stanford's red hot caeers did so
nany things this past week-end that
it is impossible to put it all in the
beginning of tlis story, but their
most important feats were as fol
lows:
1. They defeated U.C.L.A. both
Friday and Saturday nights by
scores of 49-44 and 56-34.
2. They sewed up the Southern
Division P.C.C. championship.
3. Don Burness, brilliant Indian
center, i-etained his lead in the
P.C.C. scoring race, although his

closest competitor, Jackie Robinson,
managed to outscore him by two
points over the week-end.

Stanford turned in about five min
utes of as classy basketball as
been played in the Pavilion since the
exit of the immortal Hank Luisetti
to practically blow U.C.L.A. off the
court at the start of the second half
of Friday night's basketball game,
and from there on in it was a breeze
for the Indians.

This spurt, which came when
Stanford took the court right after
the intermission, found the Indians
stretching their half-time lead of
4 points to 15 points, their largest
lead of the game, in so short a time
that the Bruins were dizzy from
watching the white-shirted Redskins
toss the ball through the hoop.

Co-captain Kenny Davidson
started the scoring parade with a
lay-in on a fast break, and Bob
Penn, subbing for Fordy Anderson
at forward, followed up with a tip
in bucket on another fast break.
DAVIDSON COMES BACK
Following Ernie Handelsman's
tally for the Bruins, their only
score during the Indian spree, Dav
idson came back to tank a push shot
from about 10 feet out, Co-captain
Don Williams tallied from the cor
ner, Penn popped a free throw, and
Bill Cowden scored twice on lay-ins
and followed with a charity toss.
Then the Indians finally let up and
gave the Bruins a chance to look
around a bit, but it was too late for
the Westwooders to do anything
about it, and, despite a series of

Friday and Saturday nights by
scores of 49-44 and 56-34.
2. They sewed up the Southern
Division P.C.C. championship.
3. Don Burness, brilliant Indian
center, i-etained his lead in the
P.C.C. scoring race, although his

closest competitor, Jackie Robinson,
managed to outscore him by two
points over the week-end.

Stanford turned in about five min
utes of as classy basketball as
been played in the Pavilion since the
exit of the immortal Hank Luisetti
to practically blow U.C.L.A. off the
court at the start of the second half
of Friday night's basketball game,
and from there on in it was a breeze
for the Indians.

This spurt, which came when
Stanford took the court right after
the intermission, found the Indians
stretching their half-time lead of
4 points to 15 points, their largest
lead of the game, in so short a time
that the Bruins were dizzy from
watching the white-shirted Redskins
toss the ball through the hoop.

Co-captain Kenny Davidson
started the scoring parade with a
lay-in on a fast break, and Bob
Penn, subbing for Fordy Anderson
at forward, followed up with a tip
in bucket on another fast break.
DAVIDSON COMES BACK
Following Ernie Handelsman's
tally for the Bruins, their only
score during the Indian spree, Dav
idson came back to tank a push shot
from about 10 feet out, Co-captain
Don Williams tallied from the cor
ner, Penn popped a free throw, and
Bill Cowden scored twice on lay-ins
and followed with a charity toss.
Then the Indians finally let up and
gave the Bruins a chance to look
around a bit, but it was too late for
the Westwooders to do anything
about it, and, despite a series of
baskets by Robinson, Handelsman,
and Roger Hillis with about three
minutes to go, the Bruins were never
again in the ball game.
This Stanford win, coupled with
U.S.C.'s 51-36 walloping of Cal in
the Southland Friday night, assured
the Indians of at least a tie for the
championship; and when they took
the Bruins down the line Saturday
night, the crown was already in the
bag, Troy's second victory over the
Bears, 57-47, only serving to
stretch the margin between Stanford
and California in the conference
standings,
NO DOUBT
The Saturday night affair wasn't
a game at all, unless you just
wanted to see how smooth the Stan
ford quintet could play, for Ucla
had shot its bolt and there wasn't
any doubt as to the outcome of the
game after the first ten minutes.
The Bruins only led at one point
in the entire tussle—that when Er
nie Handelsman popped a 25-foot
set shot to start the game's scoring.
But the spectacular Indian fast
break sent Davidson under the
bucket for the tying tally, and. when
Anderson dropped two free throws
through the net a minute later, the
Indians had a lead which they held
throughout the rest of the game.
Tin? Indians had plenty of finesse
Saturday night, and the way they
used it had the Bruins going around
in circles.
Once again much of the credit
has to be given to the clever ball
handling of Fordy Anderson, who
did all the lead work on the fast
breaks. In addition, he hit the hoop
for 11 points to take second place
in the scoring parade to Don Bur
ness, whose lf> points gave him a 3-
point lead over Robinson in the
P.C.C. scoring battle. Burness' total
for the conference season to date is
10(5 points.
SCORE TALKS
The score—Stanford SG, U.C.L.A.
34—shows how much of a walkaway
Saturday night's game was, but it
doesn't begin to tell the story of he
easy manner in which the Cards
turned the trick. Ten minutes after
the start of the game, Stanford was
out in front by 13 points at 17-4,
with most of the Indians' buckets
coming on easy lay-in shots from
either fast breaks or clever maneu
vering against a set defense. Mean
while, the zone defense employed by
Coach Everett Dean's charges kept
the Bruins way out wide, which ac
counts for the poor percentage of
shots made by the Westwooders.
Both games saw a multitude of
fouls called, but Officials Lloyd
Leith and Bob Britt kept the games
well under control, especially the
Saturday night affair, from which
both U.C.L.A.'s Jack Robinson and
Stanford's Kenny Davidson were
banished on four personal fouls.
ROBINSON BRILLIANT
Jackie Robinson was brilliant for
the Bruins Friday night, but he faded
in the second tussle and so did
U.C.LA. Stanford, on the other
hand, could always count on some
one to do the scoring. It was just a
matter of laying the ball on the edge
of the hoop the way the Indians
were setting up the plays. Williams,
Davidson, and Cowden rang up most
of the points for Stanford Friday
night, and Saturday night it was
Burness' and Anderson's turn and
they did a thorough job.
