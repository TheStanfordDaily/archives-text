# Farm Plans New Classes For Defense
## Stanford to Offer Engineering Courses In National Program 
### 
Courses in advanced study de
signed to provide specialized training
in lour engineering fields essential
to national defense are soon to be
offered at Stanford. The courses will
he offered free to all who are quali
fied to take them.
Subject matter of the four courses
include advanced mathematics for
engineers, wing theory, electronics,
and meteorology. No university
crcdit will be given for these courses;
tlu'ir aim is to prepare men to meet
the increasing burden of engineering
work involved in the national de
fense drive.
NATION-WIDE PLAN
According to Dean Samuel Morris,
regional adviser, opportunities for
00,000 students are being offered
throughout the United States in
these courses. The courses at Stan
ford are being initiated chiefly be
. a use of the demand of the men at
Moffett Field. But there are not
enough men at the field to fill the
quotas in the courses, so there will
also have to be University students
to take them.

Courses similar in nature are being
given at Santa Clara, University of
Utah, Nevada, and other Far West
ern institutions. Prospective stu
dents may enroll at the first meeting
of each class. Continuation of the
class will depend on enrollment of
the specified minimum of qualified
students, and in case more than the
specified maximum apply, the in
structor will select those who are to
continue.
NEW COURSES LISTED
Advanced mathematics, by Pro
fessor Halcott C. Moreno, will meet
for the first time on Feb. 26. Profes
sor Elliott G. Reid will teach Wing
Theory, which will meet for its first
session on April 1. The class in Me
teorology will be conducted by Pro
fessor Norris E. Bradbury, begin
ning March 4. Dr. James M. Sharp
will instruct students in Electro
statics. The first class will meet
March 18.
Information on the courses may
be obtained from Professor Eugene
L. Grant, School of Engineering.
