# Atom-Smasher Produces Ray
## Cal Discovery May Be Used in Defense 
### 
BERKELEY, Feb. 28 (UP). —A
gamma ray derived from radioactive
yttrium, developed by the Univer
sity of California's "atom-smasher,"

is so powerful that it is capable of
penetrating thicknesses of steel up
to ten inches and may prove valu
able in detecting metal flaws in na
tional defense work, it was disclosed
today.

University scientists who experi
mented with radioactive yttrium said
its ray is faster than X-rays and
gamma rays from radium, ordinarily
used in radiography.

Radioactive yttrium is a by-prod
uct of radio-strontium, which is pro
vided in the cyclotron for biological
studies. It is made by the bombard
ment of strontium and atomic "bul
lets." About 25 millicuries of radio
active yttrium are produced every
two weeks, enough to be used as a
source for radiography. A millicurie
is equal to a milligram of radium.
The yttrium gamma ray is harder

than the gamma ray emitted by ra
dium, the scientists said.
