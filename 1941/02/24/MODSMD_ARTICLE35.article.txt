# Span Fall Blamed On 'Light' Design

### 
SEATTLE. Feb. 23 (UP).—Charles
E. Andrew, designer of the San Fran
cisco-Oakland Bridge and consulting
engineer for the Washington Toil
Bridge Authority, yesterday said a
trend toward lighter and cheaper
construction of bridges was largely
to blame for the collapse of the Ta
coma Narrows bridge Nov. 7.

Declaring that heavier material,
along with design changes, will be
necessary in a new bridge, he recom
mended that a new bridge have a
four-lane deck.

Andrews said the brute force of the
wind was not the cause of the col
lapse, but the ability of the wind
to generate increasing oscillation in
yielding, flat surfaces. He said
heavier construction material, a
deep truss instead of a solid girder,
and a perforated steel deck rather
than one of concrete is advisable in
a new bridge.
