# Women Want Weddings-Not Work, Worry
## 
### 
It's not careers they want â€” it's
husbands, concluded the members
of the National Association of
Deans of Women when considering

the typical modern American col
lege girl at their 25th annual con
vention in Atlantic City, N.J.

Miss Anastasia Doyle, director of
residences for women at Stanford
stated that careers for women were
becoming less popular. Marriage
courses have superseded the usual
academic subjects in the curriculum
most desired by today's co-eds.

The girls are anxious to learn about
building a home, and many are mar
rying before graduation. Most of
the deans were convinced that the
ominousness of the future had a
great deal to do with the increased
interest in marriage and human
relations.
