the Papoose paddlers 40-35 Friday
in the Encina pools. Although Stan
ford won five of the nine events, the
Spartans managed to aggregate the
most points by taking seconds and
thirds.
The 50-yard relay provided the
chief thrill of the afternoon when
Rey Rule of Stanford came home a
split second ahead of San Jose's
Thompson. The time was 0:25.8.
Captain Ted Munroe showed him
self to be the outstanding swimmer
in the meet when he won the 220 in
2:32.3. Versatile Ted came through
again in the 440. which he won in
6:00.5, although he usually doesn't
[ swim the event.

! weak spot. When the Papooses met
San Francisco State a week ago,
they had no diver at all, and the
Staters were made a present of five
points.
At that time Stanford's victory
: was so complete and undisputed that
j it didn't make any difference, but
i Friday, San Jose took eight points
