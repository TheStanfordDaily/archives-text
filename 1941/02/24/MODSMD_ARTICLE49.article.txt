## Tomorrow 
### 
Playing its first intercollegiate en
j counter of (he year, Stanford's var- j
sily hasehall club tackles (he San ;
Joe S'-)te Spartans here tomorrow
Â».n the Sunken Diamond.
Rained out of their first start of
the season against San Francisco
Bank of America nine, Coach Walt |
McPherson's Spartans have had j
only three days to get in shape for [
the game,
McPherson has an array of stars
from which to choose his starting
squad. He has Pete "Khaki" Felice,
for one, who silenced the San Fran
cisco Seals in an exhibition contest
last summer. Felice is considered so
good by the Spartan coach that he
is being groomed for a semi-pro
team on graduation.
HEAVY SCHEDULE
Last year the Spartans slated a I
heavy schedule, broke even in their
*23 games. But the new pitching !
prospects are destined to put them
back in top form this season.
Other moundsmen who may see
action tomorrow for San Jose are
Tony Nasimento, who isn't a bad
hitter either, having hit the ball at a
..'MO clip last year; Ray Cression,
who barely lost the Spartans' final
tiff last year to Santa Barbara, 3-2,
in 14 innings; Big Jack Raine, from
Salinas J.C.; and Chet, Carsten. The
last two are of 6-foot-2, 200-pound
variety.
TAYLOR IS HUB
At the keystone position the Spar
tans have their best hitter, Cyril
Taylor, who set a San Jose summer
league record last year by hitting
safely in 28 consecutive games.
Three men are battling it out at
first: Johnny Lusar, classy looking
infielder from Sacramento; Ken
Sanborn, and Usher Tucker. At this
moment Lusar looks as if he'll get
the starting berth for tomorrow.
Third base is held down by the
veteran Ed Hunt, and shortstop by
Zip Zaro, a hard-hitting member of
last year's frosh aggregation.
