# Lowell, Monterey Preps Bow Before Freshman Hoopsters
## 
### 
half-time, 9-6, but the yearlings
turned on a "point-a-minute" drive,
j tallying 12 more before the dazed
I northerners could sink a bucket.
EVERYBODY HOT
Captain Jim Pollard hit his stride
Saturday, swelling his total for both
games to 13, which took top honors.
Tied at second in scoring with six
were Dick West, Bill Hooper, Bob
Wreisner, Frank McCann, and Bob
Halstead.
Everybody in suit got in Saturday,
j 15 in all. Coach Beeb Lee started
McCann, Bill Brubaker, Fred Oliver,
Halstead, and Hank Hege against
Monterey, and the second-stringers
really made out just about as well as
the starting five.
FROSH MAKE SLOW START
After a very mediocre start, which
c aw a low-scoring first half, the
| 'point a minute" drive set Lowell
I back on its haunches and the Card
babes were never headed again.
Hooper began the scoring spree*
taking Pollard's behind-the-back
hook pass for a field goal from the
keyhole. Wreisner, who started in
stead of Dick McDonogh at the
pivot spot, tallied on a lay-in, and
a minute later took Pollard's pass
from a tip-off and repeated from the
right side of the basket.
11-POINT LEAD
Pollard followed with one from
the extreme corner, and the locals
led, 17-6. Came one of those heart
failing back and forth passing rushes,
with Hooper finally getting clear un
der the basket for a simple set-up.
Bob Cherry brought Lowell back
into the picture for a fleeting mo
ment with the prep quintet's first
score of the second half on a long
prayer toss from about 30 feet out.

Lowell never had a chance after

out, only six fouls being called.

Monterey, too, came up with a
strong aggregation and stifled the
Papooses to a 15-10 advantage at
half-time. The second team played
the entire period. Lee inserted his
first squad in the last half, but the
doughty Montereyans played even
more aggressively and at one point
came to within one basket of the
leaders.

period, Bones Halstead two, and

scoring.
