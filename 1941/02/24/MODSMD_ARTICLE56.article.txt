# Casaba Dilemma
## 
### 
SATURDAY night over at the Pavilion the
Cards waxed U.C.L.A. and swept into un
disputed control of the Southern Division Con
ference casaba title.
But they've left the B.A.C. a tough nut to
crack. There'll be a few conflicting dates to
reckon with along in the third week in March.
Over the week-end a fast-finishing Cougar
basketball squad brought the Northern Division
championship home to Washington State.
Which means that Stanford and the Cougars will
tangle in the Pacific Coast championships in a
three-game series scheduled at Pullman, Wash.
The play-offs are set for March 14, 15, and 17.
First complicating factor is finals week. That
certain date at the end of winter quarter this
year runs from the 18th to the 21st of March.
The physical impossibility of returning to the
campus in time for the opening scholastic salvo,
and the difficulties of prepping for finals during
an away-from-home series, means that either
early or late finals should be in order.
This difficulty should not be too major a one.
Co-operation between the faculty and the B.A.C.
should bring some solution to this scholastic
problem that will be acceptable to those con
cerned.
But there is still another, and tougher, nut to
crack.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association's
tourney, bringing the eight best collegiate teams
in the nation together in a two-day program, is
scheduled for March 21 and 22.
The tournament is invitational. Stanford, con
sidered the top team in the nation in many
sports-page polls and a high-ranking contender
in every other, is virtually assured an invitation
to the Lincoln, Nebraska, finals.
The present time set-up would be impossible.
The Indians could not finish a three-game coast
titular series on March 17 and play their open
ing match in Nebraska four days later unless
the varsity flew to the N.C.A.A. competition.
Even should this be okehed by the 8.A.C., it
would mean walking onto the Nebraska court
with a tough series tucked under their belts and
practically no practice sessions during the pre
vious four-day period.
Suicidal, against the cream of the nation's
cage outfits.
Only practical solution is moving the Coast
Conference play-offs to an earlier date. And
even that will be a tough one to work out.

This difficulty should not be too major a one.
Co-operation between the faculty and the B.A.C.
should bring some solution to this scholastic
problem that will be acceptable to those con
cerned.
But there is still another, and tougher, nut to
crack.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association's
tourney, bringing the eight best collegiate teams
in the nation together in a two-day program, is
scheduled for March 21 and 22.
The tournament is invitational. Stanford, con
sidered the top team in the nation in many
sports-page polls and a high-ranking contender
in every other, is virtually assured an invitation
to the Lincoln, Nebraska, finals.
The present time set-up would be impossible.
The Indians could not finish a three-game coast
titular series on March 17 and play their open
ing match in Nebraska four days later unless
the varsity flew to the N.C.A.A. competition.
Even should this be okehed by the 8.A.C., it
would mean walking onto the Nebraska court
with a tough series tucked under their belts and
practically no practice sessions during the pre
vious four-day period.
Suicidal, against the cream of the nation's
cage outfits.
Only practical solution is moving the Coast
Conference play-offs to an earlier date. And
even that will be a tough one to work out.
SATURDAY night over at the Pavilion the
Cards waxed U.C.L.A. and swept into un
disputed control of the Southern Division Con
ference casaba title.
But they've left the B.A.C. a tough nut to
crack. There'll be a few conflicting dates to
reckon with along in the third week in March.
Over the week-end a fast-finishing Cougar
basketball squad brought the Northern Division
championship home to Washington State.
Which means that Stanford and the Cougars will
tangle in the Pacific Coast championships in a
three-game series scheduled at Pullman, Wash.
The play-offs are set for March 14, 15, and 17.
First complicating factor is finals week. That
certain date at the end of winter quarter this
year runs from the 18th to the 21st of March.
The physical impossibility of returning to the
campus in time for the opening scholastic salvo,
and the difficulties of prepping for finals during
an away-from-home series, means that either
early or late finals should be in order.
