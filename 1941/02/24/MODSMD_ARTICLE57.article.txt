DURING the last year of wearisome war, it
has been an out-of-the-ordinary week which
has not seen at least one editorial, interview, or
Daily story carrying weighty warnings against
the blinding pitfalls of Farm isolationism.
Bill Wilton, winner of the "Know Stanford"
contest, used different vocabulary tools to strike
the same note when he wrote: "Aloofness from
the daily news and current trends, a dangerous
habit of present-day Stanford students, will only
result in a type of cultural inertia . .
If what he writes is true, many Stanfordites
are culturally isolated. Possibly. But can we
also say that they are isolated from the wars in
the East and the West because the last Daily
student poll revealed that only 39 per cent
would be willing to fight if a British victory
could be assured by America's entrance into
the war, and that only 33 per cent would fight
if 'Japan invaded the Philippines?
These figures are old news. For months now,
Stanford students have emphasized one singu
lar fact in their conversations and bull sessions
across morning coffee and 10 p.m. cokes. That
fact let's keep our noses clean. Send hand
kerchiefs to Britain and China so they can keep
their own noses clean. But let's not go over and
blow their noses for them.
Such is Farm isolationism with regard to the
war in other hemispheres.
Significant figures in the last poll, however,
were those 60 per cent of the students who
would be willing to fight if Latin America were
invaded. So for Stanford students it has nar
rowed to a matter of miles.
In Britain, these students would probably be
fighting the same enemy they would fight if
Latin America were invaded. In the Philippines,
which will remain a United States possession
until 1946, they would be fighting the same
enemy as if Latin America, which is not our
possession, were invaded.

So it is a matter of miles, not of the enemy
or their principles. Do not misunderstand. This
is not an editorial favoring America's entry
into the war. This is an interpretation and a
defense of the war-worried thought running
through the minds of Stanford students. They
are not isolated from the world. Nor are they
pulling their legs and arms and head into a shell
turtle fashion.
They merely think naturally. It is difficult to
force one's self to worry about a measles epi
demic in a nearby town. There is little concern
even if the baby in the house down the block
gets the measles. Only when the boarder
downstairs contracts it, does one take definite
preventative precautions.
And Pan America is a boarder downstairs.
So the Stanford students sing "Don't You
Come Over in My Yard and Play."—B.A.

So the Stanford students sing "Don't You
Come Over in My Yard and Play."—B.A.
DURING the last year of wearisome war, it
has been an out-of-the-ordinary week which
has not seen at least one editorial, interview, or
Daily story carrying weighty warnings against
the blinding pitfalls of Farm isolationism.
Bill Wilton, winner of the "Know Stanford"
contest, used different vocabulary tools to strike
the same note when he wrote: "Aloofness from
the daily news and current trends, a dangerous
habit of present-day Stanford students, will only
result in a type of cultural inertia . .
If what he writes is true, many Stanfordites
are culturally isolated. Possibly. But can we
also say that they are isolated from the wars in
the East and the West because the last Daily
student poll revealed that only 39 per cent
would be willing to fight if a British victory
could be assured by America's entrance into
the war, and that only 33 per cent would fight
if 'Japan invaded the Philippines?
These figures are old news. For months now,
Stanford students have emphasized one singu
lar fact in their conversations and bull sessions
across morning coffee and 10 p.m. cokes. That
fact let's keep our noses clean. Send hand
kerchiefs to Britain and China so they can keep
their own noses clean. But let's not go over and
blow their noses for them.
Such is Farm isolationism with regard to the
war in other hemispheres.
Significant figures in the last poll, however,
were those 60 per cent of the students who
would be willing to fight if Latin America were
invaded. So for Stanford students it has nar
rowed to a matter of miles.
In Britain, these students would probably be
fighting the same enemy they would fight if
Latin America were invaded. In the Philippines,
which will remain a United States possession
until 1946, they would be fighting the same
enemy as if Latin America, which is not our
possession, were invaded.

So it is a matter of miles, not of the enemy
or their principles. Do not misunderstand. This
is not an editorial favoring America's entry
into the war. This is an interpretation and a
defense of the war-worried thought running
through the minds of Stanford students. They
are not isolated from the world. Nor are they
pulling their legs and arms and head into a shell
turtle fashion.
They merely think naturally. It is difficult to
force one's self to worry about a measles epi
demic in a nearby town. There is little concern
even if the baby in the house down the block
gets the measles. Only when the boarder
downstairs contracts it, does one take definite
preventative precautions.
And Pan America is a boarder downstairs.
