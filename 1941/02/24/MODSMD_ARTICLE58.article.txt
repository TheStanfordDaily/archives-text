### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
MONDAY MEDLEY
A CCOIiDING to some kind of a survey of college
deans, only about 7 per cent of men and 2 per cent
of women in universities show any kind of intei'est in
economic and social matters.
On the surface these figures sound a little invalid.
Maybe they are. I think that economic and social
science fields must claim more than this percentage as
majors, but that, of course, doesn't imply they're in
terested, actually interested, in the subjects.
Someone who was intrigued by the sociological as
pects of this phenomenon could whip up a withering
indictment of the play-mad college crowd. I leave all
such affairs to men of nobler intent and offer only
one small commentary:
Mr. Hearst, if this be true, where are all those
college radicals you're talking about? Do they lurk
along the Quad, dodging behind the sandstone arches
with copies of the Manifesto and hand-grenades tucked
in their overcoat pockets?

JT'RIDAY afternoon was clean-up time at the Boat
house. A couple of Roble maidens equipped them
selves with brooms, dust-pans, and feather dusters
and gave the men's quarters a working-over.
Maybe they were applying a little they learned in
"Women in the Home." If you can call a Boathouse
home.

Then there were two rookie cops that answered a
highway accident call. They found a car that had
left the road and was firmly, but firmly, lodged be
tween two trees so that neither door would open.
So the cops began to cut down the trees—both
trees, one cop on each side cutting down a tree. They
hurt themselves; cut themselves in the dark or some
thing. But they rescued the driver, who, too, was
bloody from the accident.
The ambulance came to the scene and took all
three to the hospital.

I CONFIDENTIAL: Whos your nomination
k for the best-dressed professor on campus? Some
one in Berkeley is conducting such a poll at the Uni
versity of California. What about Stanford? How
about Professors Robinson, Barclay, Reid, Ross? . . .
Sir, do you like to open doors for women? And,
Madame, do you like him to open doors for you? . . .
How has the underpass affected rides to Paly and
return? . . . And, mister, do you think the bids to
the Kyser dance will sell out in two days or three;
or does that makes-you-wanna-dance stuff bore you
stiff?

one small commentary:
Mr. Hearst, if this be true, where are all those
college radicals you're talking about? Do they lurk
along the Quad, dodging behind the sandstone arches
with copies of the Manifesto and hand-grenades tucked
in their overcoat pockets?

JT'RIDAY afternoon was clean-up time at the Boat
house. A couple of Roble maidens equipped them
selves with brooms, dust-pans, and feather dusters
and gave the men's quarters a working-over.
Maybe they were applying a little they learned in
"Women in the Home." If you can call a Boathouse
home.

Then there were two rookie cops that answered a
highway accident call. They found a car that had
left the road and was firmly, but firmly, lodged be
tween two trees so that neither door would open.
So the cops began to cut down the trees—both
trees, one cop on each side cutting down a tree. They
hurt themselves; cut themselves in the dark or some
thing. But they rescued the driver, who, too, was
bloody from the accident.
The ambulance came to the scene and took all
three to the hospital.

I CONFIDENTIAL: Whos your nomination
k for the best-dressed professor on campus? Some
one in Berkeley is conducting such a poll at the Uni
versity of California. What about Stanford? How
about Professors Robinson, Barclay, Reid, Ross? . . .
Sir, do you like to open doors for women? And,
Madame, do you like him to open doors for you? . . .
How has the underpass affected rides to Paly and
return? . . . And, mister, do you think the bids to
the Kyser dance will sell out in two days or three;
or does that makes-you-wanna-dance stuff bore you
stiff?
MONDAY MEDLEY
A CCOIiDING to some kind of a survey of college
deans, only about 7 per cent of men and 2 per cent
of women in universities show any kind of intei'est in
economic and social matters.
On the surface these figures sound a little invalid.
Maybe they are. I think that economic and social
science fields must claim more than this percentage as
majors, but that, of course, doesn't imply they're in
terested, actually interested, in the subjects.
Someone who was intrigued by the sociological as
pects of this phenomenon could whip up a withering
indictment of the play-mad college crowd. I leave all
such affairs to men of nobler intent and offer only
