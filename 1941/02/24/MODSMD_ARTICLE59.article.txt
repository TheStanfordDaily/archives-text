ANNIVERSARY ANTI-CLIMAX

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
My emotions are upset. Should I register disap
pointment, anger, shame, or just plain indifference?
For several months now I have been watching The
Daily articles on the 50th Anniversary celebration,
but slowly my interest has died. All the announce
ments continue designating the lGth to the 20th of
June as the apex of the celebration. It would be diffi
cult to find a time of the year when there are fewer
students on the campus.
Must we, who suffered the continual riveting for
three long months, be the last to see the interior of
our own Hoover War Libe or to hear the notes of the
famous Belgian carillon? Still if we are lucky, we may
have the chance to see the building in the newsreels
and maybe even hear the bells. Let's hope so. Also,
is it possible that the Stanford students do not have
the ability or the interest to appreciate an amphi
theater concert by the San Francisco Symphony and
would a three-day symposium on "The University and
the Future of America" be a bore for them? All this
comes at a time when wc are home working on summer
jobs or having a rest.
I am only a sophomore, but, nevertheless, I have
been around long enough to become proud of all parts
of Stanford, including the War Libe. Must we entirely
miss these important Stanford events?
Slighted,
J. Mc√ü.

CODE or ETHICS

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
The Stanford Honor Code has been a pretty fine
institution. It's something of which Stanford students
are tremendously proud; and its privileges, as well as
its obligations, should not be taken lightly.
It seems too bad that in order to prevent a few dis
honest students from cheating, the self-discipline and
honor of the rest of (he student body should have to be
done away with. The students who are going to cheat
will find some means of doing so no matter what the
system. And actually, the realization that it is one's
self, and one's fellow students, instead of merely a
proctor, on whom responsibility rests, is a very strong
inhibiting influence on cheating impulses.
Many times an examination room may be drafty
or noisy or uncomfortable for various reasons. The
privilege of getting up and taking one's exam some
where else becomes exceedingly valuable at such
times, and I doubt if many people, unless they would
cheat under any system, would take advantage of this
privilege.
It's a wonderful system as it stands. Any limitations
to the word "honor" must destroy its meaning en
tirely. Take away one part of our Honor System and
the rest is likely to disintegrate automatically.
F.J.

r FHE EDITOR. SIR:
Please continue the new policy of having fea
tures about unusual aspects of student life and activity.
I liked the stories about the girls in the military science
course and the girls who wash cars for pin money.
The paper has needed this sort of article badly for
some time.
Sincerely yours,
E. McCollum
