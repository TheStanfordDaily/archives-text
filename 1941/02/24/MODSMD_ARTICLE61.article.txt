# Hollywood Deletes Spice From Working-Girl Saga

"Kitty Foylc," starring Ginger
Rogers, now playing at the Fox
Stanford.
Christopher Morley wrote a book
— "Kitty Foyle" — The Saga of the
White Collar Girl—an unglamorized,
unsentimental picture of working
girls. The picture as he painted it
was as unfiatteringly revealing as an
unretouched snapshot taken in
bright sunlight at four feet.
The book was snapped up by
RKO. With painstaking care they
stripped the story of all the pungent
detail that made it a striking por
trait, and added a few typical "Holly
wood touches" with a hand as subtle
as a house-painter's.
Between deference for the Hays
office and catering to a public which
Hollywood credits with an I.Q. of
about 60 and the broad-mindedness
of a female temperance worker, the
sharp and spicy flavor of the book
has been destroyed by lavish help
ings of sugar.
The net result is an attractively
staged, rather nicely told, but none
theless trite tale of a poor little girl
who loves, marries, and loses a rich
Philadelphia mainliner, but keeps
smiling despite her tragedy. And
why not? In the end she gets the
most attractive man in the picture,

which should make both her and
the audience happy.
But don't miss the other picture
on the bill, "Night Train," a subtle
and exciting spy drama done in the
best casual English manner. And
that means that it's a blend of sus
pense and adult humor fit for the
most discriminating connoisseur —
