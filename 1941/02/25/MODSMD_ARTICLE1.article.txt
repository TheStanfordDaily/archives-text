# History ... 1941

"W/MILE Stanford was falling out
of bed and stumbling blindly
toward its various 8 o'clocks yes
terday morning, Adolf Hitler was
telling the world that he was pre
pared to "mobilize half of Europe"
for a knockout of Great Britain.
History, in dealing with Musso
lini's Rome speech, was not too
respectful . . . that is because
History thinks that the Duce is
fairly funny in a grim sort of
way. Hcrr Hitler isn't funny at
all. Of course, the fact I hat Hitler
isn't good for many laughs is a
modern day truism. We learned it
the hard way.
However, *if the Axis partners' po
sitions were reversed, it would be
very easy to point out the discrep
ancies, the bombastic nonsense, in
Herr Hitler's Hofbrauhaus speech.
But Hitler is riding the crest of the
wave these days, and what he has
to say is worthy of note whether
it makes sense or not.
* * *
r^', WO new points appeared in the
hour and a half Munich perora
tion. First, the "mobilization" men
tioned above, and second, the prom
ise that a vast Nazi U-boat fleet
will unleash merciless submarine
warfare next month.
While these two points have
never been brought up officially
by the Germans, neither can come
as a startling surprise to the
British. Everyone knows that Hit
ler has all of Europe except Greece
and Russia under his thumb.
Warnings concerning a fleet of
some 1000 vest-pocket subs have
been beating on English ear-drums
for months now.
No mention was made of his old
promise to wind up the war this
year, nor did he repeat his previous
boast that when the time comes his
forces will cross the English Chan
nel and pounce upon Britain.
â™¦ * *
JJE DID NOT refer to the sizzling
Balkan situation either, al
though both Balkan and British ob
servers believed the Nazi occupation
of Bulgaria might come within a
matter of hours.
The only thing in the speech that
London thought worth denying
was the Fuehrer's statement that
215,000 more tons of British ship
ping have been sunk, 190,000 of
this by U-boats. London said he
was jacking up the figures, but
made no retaliatory releases.
In reply to the submarine threat,
English naval quarters promised to
meet it with "new secret methods
for tracking and destroying enemy
submarines." Since the Nazis hove
already claimed to have some sort
of mystery weapon which they are
going to unveil during the invasion,
the experts should be quite eager to
rewrite the books on tactics. That is,
if the weapons do exist, and are as
effective as their publicity men
claim.
* * *
WAR of attrition may be the
Nazis' new method for knock
ing out the British Isles. If this is
the idea, then the "scene of real ex
citement will shift to the Balkans,
Gibraltar, and possibly the Far East.
For in order to starve out the island,
the Germans must cut off the Em
pire resources.
"Drang nach Ostcn" was Kaiser
Wilhelm's watchword, and. if it
can be done, it's as good an idea
today. Hitler in Suez, Palestine,
Iraq, and India would mean an
unlimited source of supplies. And
Japan in Singapore, the Malay
peninsula, and the Dutch East In
dies could successfully cut ofT aid
from Australia and New Zealand.
It would be the submarine's busi
ness to harry shipping from Canada,
South Africa, and the United States.
Then, when the English were really
hungry, the all-out air raids would
start again . . . and after that, in
vasion. An easy invasion.
It's a very good idea. But lots of
"ifs" are involved.
