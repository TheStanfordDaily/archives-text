the A.S.S.U. office, according to
Dan Hays.
Bids will be offered to the entire
campus tomorrow, and today's sale

Latest news from Kyser indicated
that the popular maestro will stage
a "college of musical knowledge" as
a half-hour floor show when he
plays here. His appearance at Stan
ford will mark the first college
dance on the Coast for which Kyser
has ever played.
The man who introduced singing
song titles began his sensational

San Francisco, though his original
band was organized when he was
an undergraduate at North Carolina.
He will bring his entire 14-piece
band and vocalists Ginny Simms,
Harry Babbitt, Sully Mason, and
"Ish Kabibble" to the Pavilion. Bids
will be priced at $3.50 and dress will
be semi-formal.
