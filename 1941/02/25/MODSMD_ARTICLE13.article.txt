THIS GROUP OF SENATORS is leading the fight against the lend-lease bill. From the left: Bennett
Champ Clark (D), Missouri; Hiram Johnson (R), California; Arthur 11. Vandenberg (R), Michigan; and
Burton K. Wheeler (D), Montana. The charge was repeatedly made that the bill would make President
Roosevelt a dictator.
