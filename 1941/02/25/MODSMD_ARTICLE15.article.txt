# Senate Resents Aid Pressure
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (UP).â€”
Senate leaders tonight virtually
abandoned hope of a final vote on
President Roosevelt's British Aid
Bill this week after new threats of
a filibuster by opposition forces pro
testing the Administration's "hurry
up" tactics.
Sen. Burton K. Wheeler, D., Mont.,
revealed plans of non-intervention
ists for nationwide effort after the
bill passes to muster sentiment
against presidential use of powers in
the bill which might plunge the
country into war. The drive will be
waged through mass meetings, talks
over the radio and every other ave
nue to public thought, he said.
He interrupted debate on the bill
today to complain against reported
administration plans to hold night
sessions and utilize other means to
speed a final vote. Warning against
any attempt to "put pressure on us,"
Wheeler said his group is prepared
to "talk all day and all night, if
necessary."
Senator Majority Leader Alben W.
Barkley, D., Ky., later conferred with
Wheeler and Sen. Bennett C. Clark,
D*, Mo., another leader of the oppo
sition, and informed the Senate
when it recessed he was seeking to
work out an agreement which would
hasten disposition of the measure.
