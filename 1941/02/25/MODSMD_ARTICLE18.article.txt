# Dr. Wilbur Decries U.S. Draft Plans
## 
### BOB CHANDLER 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
terday declared that the fault with
the present Selective Service Act is
that "the government failed to bene
fit by their experiences in the last
war."
"The British government went
through the same thing in the first
war, and when this war started they
provided for further training of se
lected groups ranging from archi
tects and steamfitters to doctors and
physicists. Men in these categories
up to a certain age could neither
volunteer nor be drafted."
STUDENTS NOT EXEMPT
Placing special emphasis upon the
fact that the tens of thousands of
men on local boards can not be cog
nizant of the full situation, he de
clared that university students
should not be excused from army
service, but that they should be al
lowed to finish their training in
work that will make them vastly
more valuable to their country when
they are finally called
Commenting upon the resolution
recently passed by several groups of
the American Medical Association,
he expressed his disapproval of the
way in which medical students, par
ticularly, are not being allowed to
finish their studies.
DOCTORS NEEDED
The resolution states that the gov
ernment's five-year preparedness
program will need about 3500 med
ical graduates each year to enter the
service of the army, navy, and pub
lic health services. He went on to
explain that there are only about
5200 medical students graduated
each year in the United States.
"Those 3500 graduates are needed
by the government each year, and
the remainder Is left for public
medical services," he said. "Their
education should not be interrupted
if the demands of both groups are to
be met.
