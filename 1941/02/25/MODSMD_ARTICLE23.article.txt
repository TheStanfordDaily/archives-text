# Anniversary Fund Drive Brings $57,000 in Pledges And Gifts to Stanford
## Forty Contributors Donate $1,000; Newell Warns Committee Members To Contact Unsolicited Alumni 
### 
.Over $57,000 in pledges and gifts have been received by Stanford as a
result of the 50th Anniversary Gift campaign, according to Paul C. Ed
wards, chairman of the annual drive.
This amount represents efforts of four different drives which arc still
in progress. The gifts are for unrestricted use and will be added to the

,amiual income.
Of the amount received so far,
$50,500 has been given by 40 don
ors in individual gifts of $1000 or
more. These gifts were secured by
the committee on speical gifts, trusts,
and bequests, headed by Morgan A.
Gunst.
Beginning last Tuesday, the Fam
ily Call, conducted by students, re
ports a total of $718.50 in gifts up to
last night. Since most donations
come by mail or are brought by the
student callers, this sum i*epresents
only a fraction of the total which
will be received.
LARGER RETURN
"We can look for a much larger
return from today on," reports Bob
Newell, chairman of the Student
Family Council. "It is important
that those students who have not
completed their calls do so as soon
as possible," Newell said.
About $4,500 has been secured by
special alumni committees repre
senting the various university
schools. Alumni whose allegiance to
individual schools are known have
been contacted on this basis. This
appeal, begun last November, will
continue for several months.
The fourth section of the campaign
contributes $1,281.50 in unrestricted
gifts presented in amounts of less
than $1,000. This drive is also con
tinuing.
TO APPEAL BY MAIL
The filial effort will occur with a
general mail appeal March 1 to those
alumni and friends who have not al
ready contributed. This will be the
largest drive in numbers of alumni
to be contacted.
The over-all effort in March con
cludes the 50th anniversary gift so
licitation campaign, which includes
the special "$l,OOO or more" drive,
the appeal by alumni committees of
the schools, student participation in
the Family Call, and the special ap
peal for less than $1,000.
However, efforts of the committee
on special gifts, trusts and bequests
have been unabated in seeking addi
tions to the endowment. Only in
connection with the 50th Year Cele
bration did this committee conduct
a special campaign.
