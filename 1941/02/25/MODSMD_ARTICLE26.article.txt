in operatic music in the person of
Dr. Herbert Jan Popper, heads the
list of talent behind "The Bartered
Bride," Stanford's first opera which

ater March 7 and 8.
Dr. Popper, who was formerly
musical director of the opera house

ductor at the "broadcasting station
there, comes down from his San
Francisco studio every day to be
present at rehearsals of the Smetana
folk-opera in addition to lecturing in
his opera course here.
Dr. Popper, a quiet-spoken Chech
oslovakian with fine hands and ex
pressive brown eyes, declared that
not since his first experiences in pro
ducing operas in Europe has he had
such fun in putting on a show.
"In my first operas I found it ex
citing because of the newness, but
heio I meet with co-operation on all
sides, and enthusiasm from the di
rectors down to the last chorus-boy

DIRECTORS GOOD
Also impressive to Dr. Popper was
the responsibility the student sing
ers take in putting on this show. He
declared that this help, along with
the aid from Chorus Director Joel
Carter and Supervisor F. Cowles
Strickland, is making the direction of
the opera an easier job than it could
possibly be otherwise.
Future dream of Dr. Popper is to
have an American Opera Workshop
where American talent along with
American production methods can
be developed to their utmost. Most
important to him would be the de
velopment of opera in English —
American English.
SCRIPT CHANGED
To this end he has had the orig
inal translation of "The Bartered
Bride" further streamlined into
modem language so that the full ef
fect of the broad Czechoslovakian
folk-language could be brought out.
Dr. Popper is also making an ef
fort to offset antiquated opera styles
which demanded that the nero sing
high tenor by transporting the
leading man's part into one fitted to
a lower, broader range.
In addition to his lecture work
here, Dr. Popper has a music studio
in San Francisco where he special
izes in teaching musicianship and
opera conducting. But to Dr. Pop
per, opera is not just music, he sees
a great future for the development
of the theater and music together so
that people may finally see operas
combining excellent acting and stag
ing, along with the best in vocal
music.

music.
A, varied and experienced career
in operatic music in the person of
Dr. Herbert Jan Popper, heads the
list of talent behind "The Bartered
Bride," Stanford's first opera which
will be presented in Memorial The
ater March 7 and 8.
Dr. Popper, who was formerly
musical director of the opera house
at Prague and also musical con
ductor at the "broadcasting station
there, comes down from his San
Francisco studio every day to be
present at rehearsals of the Smetana
folk-opera in addition to lecturing in
his opera course here.
Dr. Popper, a quiet-spoken Chech
oslovakian with fine hands and ex
pressive brown eyes, declared that
not since his first experiences in pro
ducing operas in Europe has he had
such fun in putting on a show.
"In my first operas I found it ex
citing because of the newness, but
heio I meet with co-operation on all
sides, and enthusiasm from the di
rectors down to the last chorus-boy
1 find," he said.
DIRECTORS GOOD
Also impressive to Dr. Popper was
the responsibility the student sing
ers take in putting on this show. He
declared that this help, along with
the aid from Chorus Director Joel
Carter and Supervisor F. Cowles
Strickland, is making the direction of
the opera an easier job than it could
possibly be otherwise.
Future dream of Dr. Popper is to
have an American Opera Workshop
where American talent along with
American production methods can
be developed to their utmost. Most
important to him would be the de
velopment of opera in English —
American English.
SCRIPT CHANGED
To this end he has had the orig
inal translation of "The Bartered
Bride" further streamlined into
modem language so that the full ef
fect of the broad Czechoslovakian
folk-language could be brought out.
Dr. Popper is also making an ef
fort to offset antiquated opera styles
which demanded that the nero sing
high tenor by transporting the
leading man's part into one fitted to
a lower, broader range.
In addition to his lecture work
here, Dr. Popper has a music studio
in San Francisco where he special
izes in teaching musicianship and
opera conducting. But to Dr. Pop
per, opera is not just music, he sees
a great future for the development
of the theater and music together so
that people may finally see operas
combining excellent acting and stag
ing, along with the best in vocal
music.
