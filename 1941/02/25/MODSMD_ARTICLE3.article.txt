### 
SHANGHAI, Tuesday, March 25 (UP). —Japanese Foreign Minister
Yosuke Matsuoka tentatively is planning a visit to Moscow and Berlin
next month, informed quarters in Shanghai heard today, and hopes his
mission will result in a Russo-Japanese non-aggression treaty.
No final decision has been made, it was said, but the Foreign Minister
feels that Japan's relations with Russia, particularly, are so important that

he should see Soviet Premier
Foreign Affairs Commissar V. M.
Molotov at the earliest possible mo
ment after the present session of the
Japanese Parliament adjourns.
Matsuoka hopes that the peace

conference between Thailand and.
Indo-China, which is being held in
Tokyo under his auspices, can be
completed within a fortnight, it was
said, and that he will then be free
to leave Japan.
TOKYO SAYS NOTHING
ABOUT PROPOSED TRIP
TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 25 (UP).—
Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka
said today that he hoped to obtain
the islands of the central and south
ern Pacific Ocean as a sphere for
Japanese and other Asiatic migration
through "an understanding" with
European nations and the United
States.
The Foreign Minister made it clear
that Australia, New Zealand and
Hawaii are not within the proposed
sphere which he mentioned during
debate in Parliament Tuesday. The
areas to which he refers, he said, in
clude such sparsely settled lands as
New Guinea, which now is con
trolled jointly by Australia and the
Netherlands.
Matsuoka said he has no imme
diate definite program, but as a long
range ideal the Western powers
should realize Japan and other
Asiatic nations must have some
place to send their excess population,
and the islands of "Oceania" are
logical places since they now are
largely undeveloped and under
populated.
