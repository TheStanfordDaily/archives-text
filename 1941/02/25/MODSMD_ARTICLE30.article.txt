# Students Hear Krick Discuss Banking Ideals
## Trust Company Head Outlines Objectives For Business Men 
### 
What is expected of the young man
entering the business world was the
central theme of the highly enlight
ening speech of Mr. E. V. Krick,
vice-president and cashier of the
American Trust Company. The talk
was given in the Encina lobby last
night and was sponsored by the
Men's Vocational Committee.
Mr. Krick divided his speech into
two parts. He first gave the under
lying requirements necessary for a
young man going into any business
career, then he gave the more spe
cific qualities necessary for a suc
cessful banker. "A young man must
have ideals and ideas in order to
succeed in the business world to
day," Mr. Krick pointed out.
In speaking of the connection be
tween a college education and a bus
iness career Krick said that although
good grades are important, charac
ter and integrity are the essential
qualifications. "The man coming
into the business world must leam
to apply his knowledge," Krick
said.
In closing Mr. Krick emphasized
the importance of ethics in business.
He told the men to "place their ideals
high and to live up to them."
