# Rain Today, Tomorrow, Forever, Like Roosevelt
## 
### 
Rain today, did you say? But of course. Rain yesterday plus rain
today at Stanford adds up to the inevitable conclusion that rain, like
Roosevelt, Will go on forever. But did you ever stop to wonder why this
year's elements have plagued Stanford with the largest seasonal rainfall
that the Farm has seen for fifteen years?

Unless you are a meteorology ma-,
jor you probably gave up in de
spair in the attempt to analyze this
quirk of nature. We took a short
cut by interviewing Stanford's
weather forecasting expert, Dr. N. E.
Bradbury of the physics department.
Even though the Bay Region's 19-
inch rainfall record is the highest
in 15 years, Dr. Bradbury maintains
that in the strict scientific sense our
rain isn't "abnormally abnormal."
RAINFALL VARIABLE
'"You see rainfall is extremely
variable," he said. "Twelve inches
is about the average amount for this
time of year but we expect a normal
deviation of 12 to 20 inches. No one
pays any attention to this deviation
when rainfall is less than normal."
Our unusually wet season this
year is caused by the southward
movement of a major high pres
sure area in the South Pacific, ac
cording to Dr. Bradford.
"Storms move across the country
in a shallow, bell-shaped curve
which originates in the northwest
Pacific," Dr. Bradbury said. "In its
normal'course this path of storms
hits Oregon, Washington, and north
ern California."
However, a mysterious relation
ship which exists between this storm
path and the pressure center in the
South Pacific causes them to move
in the same direction simultaneous
ly. The result? Stanford and the
Bay Region are now having normal
Washington and Oregon weather.
COAST DIFFICULT
"The difficulty of forecasting
' weather for the Pacific Coast is par
ticularly bad," Dr. Bradbury as
serted. "Since all our weather
moves in from the Northwest wc
must know today's or yesterday's
weathef over the ocean. For this in
formation we rely on ship weather
reports.
To be of any value the reporting
ships must cite their positions at sea,
Very few ships will divulge such
information in the present war
crisis, according to Dr. Bradbury.
RAIN MAY CONTINUE
"So you see I can't tell you when
the rain will stop or how wet a
March we will have," Dr. Bradbury
said. "All I can do in the way of
pi'edicting next month's weather is
to warn you of the worst to expect
from previous years' totals."
