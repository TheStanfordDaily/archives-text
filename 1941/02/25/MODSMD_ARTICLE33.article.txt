# Frosh Ruggers Prep for Menlo
## 
### 
The frosh rugby team went
through a scrimmage with part of
the junior varsity outfit this after
noon in preparation for the tilt with
Menlo J.C. Wednesday.
Menlo will probably hand out the
toughest opposition the frosh have
faced so far this season, having tied
our junior varsity in their clash
earlier this season. Still the frosh
squad has plenty of that old will to
win as shown in previous games.
"If only the players pull out of
their 'bit of a slump'," quoted* Coach
Bob Olden, "they shouldn't find it
too difficult to put the game on ice.
Still, Menlo's the toughest yet." The
game is to be played on the home
field at 4 o'clock Wednesday after
noon.
