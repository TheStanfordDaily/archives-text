# Nine to Meet Spartans In First Collegiate Clash
## 
### 
Good weather holding out, Stanford's varsity baseball squad and San
Jose State College clash here today on Sunken Diamond at .'5:15 o'clock.
Russ Smith will take the mount for the Cardinals and Pete Felice for
the Spartans.
First intercollegiate encounter of the season for Coach Harry Wolter's

aggregation, the game promises to (
show Stanford's real strength against
ball clubs of its own potential
strength.
Mentor Walt McPherson's San
Joseans were rained out of their
first practice tilt a week ago with
the San Francisco Bank of America
nine, and muddy fields have kept
down further practices to a mini
mum.
STANFORD RATES EDGE
On the strength of their early vic
tories over Kenealy's Seals, Gad
dafi's All-Stars, and the same Bank
of America outfit, the Redshirts
hold a definite edge.
Principal losses to the Spartan fold
this year who did not return to
school last fall are Aubrey Minter,
star halfback and second-string
catcher on the Slaters' '40 squad;
Floyd Sanchez, regular second base
man of last year's team, and Mc
pherson's prize "pro" trio, who have
all since joined the minor loops,
Johnny Rich, Mike Anello, and
Cliff Martinez.
WOLF MAY BE O.K.
Phil Wolf, starting Indian mounds
man, who injured his throwing
flipper two weeks ago, may be ready
to go today in the event that
Smith finds trouble. Cootie Thomp
son will probably be saved for to
morrow's struggle with the Kenealy
Seals, who return to the Farm for
their fourth engagement.
Aurelio "Botch" Caruso played
for the first time against Kenealy's
last week and will again take the
starting berth at second base. The
keystone combination will be com
plete with Monty Pfyl at shortstop.
