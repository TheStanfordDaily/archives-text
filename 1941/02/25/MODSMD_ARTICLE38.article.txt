# Frosh to Open Season Today
## 
### 
The Stanford frosh baseball team
will open tlieir long delayed season
at It:30 o'clock this afternoon on the
Frosh Diamond when they meet
San Jose High School, if weather
permits.
Stanford's starting line-up is at
present very problematical and lia
ble to change. A lot of the men
have not had much experience and
the lack of game practice has made
it difficult to predict just how each
player will look under fire.
The starting battery will prob
ably consist of Don Pendergrass,
pitcher, and Ward Walkup from Se
quoia High as backstop. Larry
Wolfe from Seattle will act as re
lief hurler.
Bob Koch will start at first and
Tex Byrd will hold the keystone
sack. Covering the short-stop zone
will be little Lee Scott, although
Colin MacKay may have a chance
to move in early in the game. Ted
Nell, one of the teams heaviest slug
gers, will be in the hot corner.
Out in the daisies will be Bob
Mitchell, Felix Poletti, and Harold
Pet rich. Poletti and Petrich have
had little experience, while Mitchell
is a tested slugger.
