FEW of the difficulties faced by
Stanford's high flying basket
ball team which for a while thought
it was going to have to travel five
thousand miles, play five or six bas
ketball games and take their finals
all in the same week have been
ironed out.
In the first place, arrangements
are under way between the basket
ball players individually and their
professors to either take early ox
postpone until next quarter those
un'escapable finals.
This will enable the Indians to
represent the West in Kansas City
in the N.CAA. the week-end of
March 21-22 if they succeed in
stopping Washington State or who
ever wins the Northern Division of
the Pacific Coast Conference.
And there is a strong possibility
that the play-offs for the Coast
crown will be changed from the
scheduled dates of March 14, 15,
and 17 in order to give the win
ning team, whoever it is, time to
catch its breath before heading
east to defend the reputation of
western basketball.
This can be arranged if Idaho and
Oregon State, the only teams with a
mathematical chance of catching the
also high flying Washington State
Cougars in the conference race, swap
dates for their scheduled games
with these league leaders.
This would mean that this coming
week-end while the Indians were
battling California's rough house
Bears in search of something almost
as dear to them as the Southern Di
vision title — a victory in the Cal
series—Oregon State and the Cou
gars would be deciding who has the
right to meet the Cards.
And with the Northern Division
Conference decided a week earlier
than scheduled, the two top teams
of the Coast, northern and southern
division winners could get their
play-off out of the way a few days
earlier and avoid crowding into the
space of a week an awful long train
ride and a half a dozen grueling
basketball games.

'T'HIS wet weather has been al
most as tough on Stanford ath
letics as it was on the now extinct
Golden Gate Turf Club. A grand
total of one frosh track meet, four
varsity baseball, four frosh base
ball, and one varsity rugby game
have been either postponed or can
celled in the past three weeks be
cause of the excess of moisture.
Rain and the resulting postpone
ment of the rugby game with U.S.C,
from last Saturday to tomorrow must
have rather upset the plans of four
of the varsity's ruggers. Bob Olden,
Frankie Albert, A1 Cole, and Pop
Barnard who left last Wednesday for
the south for the game and a few
extra days with friends and rela
tions, have found their short stay
stretched into a week and are prob
ably dying to get back to the books.

ever wins the Northern Division of
the Pacific Coast Conference.
And there is a strong possibility
that the play-offs for the Coast
crown will be changed from the
scheduled dates of March 14, 15,
and 17 in order to give the win
ning team, whoever it is, time to
catch its breath before heading
east to defend the reputation of
western basketball.
This can be arranged if Idaho and
Oregon State, the only teams with a
mathematical chance of catching the
also high flying Washington State
Cougars in the conference race, swap
dates for their scheduled games
with these league leaders.
This would mean that this coming
week-end while the Indians were
battling California's rough house
Bears in search of something almost
as dear to them as the Southern Di
vision title — a victory in the Cal
series—Oregon State and the Cou
gars would be deciding who has the
right to meet the Cards.
And with the Northern Division
Conference decided a week earlier
than scheduled, the two top teams
of the Coast, northern and southern
division winners could get their
play-off out of the way a few days
earlier and avoid crowding into the
space of a week an awful long train
ride and a half a dozen grueling
basketball games.

'T'HIS wet weather has been al
most as tough on Stanford ath

Golden Gate Turf Club. A grand
total of one frosh track meet, four
varsity baseball, four frosh base
ball, and one varsity rugby game
have been either postponed or can
celled in the past three weeks be
cause of the excess of moisture.
Rain and the resulting postpone
ment of the rugby game with U.S.C,
from last Saturday to tomorrow must
have rather upset the plans of four
of the varsity's ruggers. Bob Olden,
Frankie Albert, A1 Cole, and Pop
Barnard who left last Wednesday for

stretched into a week and are prob
