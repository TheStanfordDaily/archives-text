# Bears Gunning For Two Wins This Week-end
## 
### 
It's been a great year for Stanford's
basketball team, and if things could
end right now, all would be rosy
and everyone would be satisfied. But
things aren't to be that way, for
the Stanford Indians, Southern Divi
sion P.C.C. champs, have to tangle
with California's erratic hoopsters
twice this week-end.
While the Indians have nothing to
fear from Cal in the conference race,
it's still going to be mighty tough if
the Bears knock Williams, Davidson
& Co. off its lofty perch. And Cal is
going to be out to do just that, for
while they have little to lose in
this two-game series, they have ev
erything to gain.
A pair of victories over the South
ern Division title holders is nothing
to be sneezed at, and the Bears
would like nothing better than to
hang up those victories.
Furthermore, the cagers from over
Berkeley way are battling neck and
neck with U.S.C. for the second spot
in the conference standings; and,
while ihey lead the Trojans now,
two California losses to Stanford
and two U.S.C. wins over Ucla
would reverse their positions in the
final conference tabulations.
