BOUNCING down around the 10~,/er portion
of the back-page column to the :ight is the
best-read section, bar none, of The Daily. Farm
men and women generally manage to read
"Campus Opinion" every day even if they
delve no further into the paper than the two or
three student letters in 18-em type.
It's a good practice. It's a good column. And
there are no rules or regulations surrounding
the authorship of the efforts other than a bona
fide signature.
But the readers who enjoy the breezy chit
chat which often runs through these page-four
letters, fail to realize that these evidences of
how the Farm feels really play an enormous
role in the campus scene.
In Excom, at B.A.C. meetings, in the Councils,
and in almost every other organ <Ht student
government the same question repeatedly is
heard:
"What does the campus think about it?"
The page-four expressions of opinion, believe
it or not, are quoted widely at times like this.
Last week Excom members left with a mission
to sound out the student body on the present
effect of Stanford's Honor Code. Chewing the
fat with the brothers can bring forth some in
teresting and valuable observations, but the
black-and-white weight of the Campus Opinion
letter plays a heavy role in such student issues.
The page-four offerings fill another important
part of the campus picture. Matters which other
wise might have escaped attention are brought
to light and favorably disposed of. A Campus
Opinion gripe has often meant a big news story
a few days later.
Only pre-requisite is a bona fide signature.
And writers who prefer to remain anonymous
will be kept so for the asking.
