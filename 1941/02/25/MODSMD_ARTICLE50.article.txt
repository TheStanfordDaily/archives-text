rpHE Board of Trustees decided at their last
a. meeting to allot money to be used in recon
struction of Lomita Drive and broadening and
straightening of Santa Teresa from Lomita to the
Post Office.
This work is to be undertaken to relieve traf
fic congestion and might possibly lead' to use
of certain campus streets for one-way travel
only, according to Frank F. Walker, Financial
Vice-President.
However, the Trustees seemingly have not
disposed of the question of much-needed re
pairs to existing streets.
The Daily believes that any person who has
driven or ridden over almost any campus thor
oughfare within the last few months will agree
that more than just superficial repairs are
needed on practically all well-used roads.
It is not only to keep students' cars out of
Paly garages for periodically necessary "tight
en-up jobs," but also for the general impression
which unduly rough roads m on the great
numbers of visitors to Stanfoi
After turning off a smooth new onto Palm
Drive the tourist is met with one of California's
famous scenic views—a panorama of the Quad
with the Chapel's colorful mosaic fagade domi
nating the picture. This picture would be more
highly appreciated by a visitor were it not
blurred by a bumpy ride up the drive.
After getting off Palm Drive and onto Ar
guello a specific example can be cited—one
chuck hole outside Encina measuring a good
ten inches from pavement surface to bottom of
chuck hole—right in the track of Paly-bound
cars.
The Corporation Yard every so often goes
around and fills such holes with a gravel-and
tar mixture which soon packs down again, leav
ing the hole only a little shallower than before
repair.
But since the Fiftieth Year Celebrations will
draw many people to Stanford during early
summer and fall, we feel there would be time
enough during spring quarter to do some sub
stantial road repairing to existing thoroughfares
in order to prove that our roads too are not in
their "Fiftieth Year."—C. B.

The Daily believes that any person who has
driven or ridden over almost any campus thor
oughfare within the last few months will agree
that more than just superficial repairs are
needed on practically all well-used roads.
It is not only to keep students' cars out of
Paly garages for periodically necessary "tight

numbers of visitors to Stanfoi
After turning off a smooth new onto Palm
Drive the tourist is met with one of California's
famous scenic views—a panorama of the Quad
with the Chapel's colorful mosaic fagade domi
nating the picture. This picture would be more
highly appreciated by a visitor were it not
blurred by a bumpy ride up the drive.
After getting off Palm Drive and onto Ar
guello a specific example can be cited—one
chuck hole outside Encina measuring a good
ten inches from pavement surface to bottom of
chuck hole—right in the track of Paly-bound
cars.
The Corporation Yard every so often goes
around and fills such holes with a gravel-and
tar mixture which soon packs down again, leav
ing the hole only a little shallower than before
repair.
But since the Fiftieth Year Celebrations will
draw many people to Stanford during early
summer and fall, we feel there would be time
enough during spring quarter to do some sub
stantial road repairing to existing thoroughfares
in order to prove that our roads too are not in
their "Fiftieth Year."—C. B.
rpHE Board of Trustees decided at their last
a. meeting to allot money to be used in recon
struction of Lomita Drive and broadening and
straightening of Santa Teresa from Lomita to the
Post Office.
This work is to be undertaken to relieve traf
fic congestion and might possibly lead' to use
of certain campus streets for one-way travel
only, according to Frank F. Walker, Financial
Vice-President.
However, the Trustees seemingly have not
disposed of the question of much-needed re
pairs to existing streets.
