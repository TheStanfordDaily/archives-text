PERKED UP by the promise of spring, yet
afraid to turn things loose and jump into
dirndls and T-shirts, the fluttering standbys of
the Daily staff will gather in fond meeting this
afternoon at 1:15 o'clock. The bridge trust will
begin at 12:45.
Emboldened by one week's successes and
one complimentary Campus Opinion letter, Edit
Board will stalk into the edit office at 1 o'clock,

try out their new whips on the green files cabi
net in the corner. Major topic of conversation
will be the new staff contest. Associates will
foot the bill for afternoon club.
