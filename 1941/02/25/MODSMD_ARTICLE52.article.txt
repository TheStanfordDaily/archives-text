"THE SUN ALSO RISES"
Vj7E THOUGHT maybe it wouldn't happen again.
We figured that, after the last war, when the
post-war escapists had blazed through the jazz age
and settled down into left-wing radicalism during
the backwash of the depression, the whole show was
over.
And now nations are cutting each other's throats
again. America faces the all-too-grim prospect of an
other fight to save a cause or an ideal. And with it,
the prospect of another post-war age of what F. Scott
Fitzgerald called "tired young men."
There were tired young men the last time. And
there was a "lost generation." They weren't just lit
erary terms. They meant something in the measure
of humanity.
* * * *
r was a general search for escape. People re
tired from business. Small men sold out their
holdings to larger corporations. They were tired of
working and they realized the goals they sought were
perhaps not worth the effort. Post-war disillusion in
dicated a loss of faith—principally in the ethical and
economic aspects of capitalism.
The "success story man" became the subject of de
rision from literature and the speaker's platform. All
printed satire centered about the self-made man. He
was widely debunked.
Maybe it was this same disillusion that led to the
wild speculation on the market which dumped the
whole apple cart in 1929. People wanted to "clean up."
It was an opening to easy money and retirement—
and an existence of ease, known as "good living."

'JpHE dilemma of the intellectual was even more pre
carious. After the "war to save democracy" he
was tired of bad, empty words—of long, rolling, gib
berish sentences that emotionally sought to portray
things bigger than their meaning. He was tired and
he wanted to live, day after day, without stepping on
anyone's toes. He just wanted to live his own life and
in his own way.
The retreat from reality in the 1920's shaded away
into a kind of concentration on economic matters dur
ing the depression. From The Village and the farms
of Connecticut, the white collar intellectuals flooded
the publishers with books on predatory capitalism, on
economic planning, on co-operatives and governmental
regulation of business.
Then came the war—and Russia's attack on Fin
land—and Hitler's "wave" across Europe. And now
America is becoming "an arsenal for democracy." It
may one day be forced to send not only tools but men.
And the cycle will begin all over again.

'JpHE dilemma of the intellectual was even more pre
carious. After the "war to save democracy" he
was tired of bad, empty words—of long, rolling, gib
berish sentences that emotionally sought to portray
things bigger than their meaning. He was tired and
he wanted to live, day after day, without stepping on
anyone's toes. He just wanted to live his own life and
in his own way.
The retreat from reality in the 1920's shaded away
into a kind of concentration on economic matters dur
ing the depression. From The Village and the farms
of Connecticut, the white collar intellectuals flooded
the publishers with books on predatory capitalism, on
economic planning, on co-operatives and governmental
regulation of business.
Then came the war—and Russia's attack on Fin
land—and Hitler's "wave" across Europe. And now
America is becoming "an arsenal for democracy." It
may one day be forced to send not only tools but men.
And the cycle will begin all over again.
"THE SUN ALSO RISES"
Vj7E THOUGHT maybe it wouldn't happen again.
We figured that, after the last war, when the
post-war escapists had blazed through the jazz age
and settled down into left-wing radicalism during
the backwash of the depression, the whole show was
over.
And now nations are cutting each other's throats
again. America faces the all-too-grim prospect of an
other fight to save a cause or an ideal. And with it,
the prospect of another post-war age of what F. Scott
Fitzgerald called "tired young men."
There were tired young men the last time. And
there was a "lost generation." They weren't just lit
erary terms. They meant something in the measure
of humanity.

r was a general search for escape. People re
tired from business. Small men sold out their
holdings to larger corporations. They were tired of
working and they realized the goals they sought were
perhaps not worth the effort. Post-war disillusion in
dicated a loss of faith—principally in the ethical and
economic aspects of capitalism.
The "success story man" became the subject of de
rision from literature and the speaker's platform. All
printed satire centered about the self-made man. He
was widely debunked.
Maybe it was this same disillusion that led to the
wild speculation on the market which dumped the
whole apple cart in 1929. People wanted to "clean up."
It was an opening to easy money and retirement—
and an existence of ease, known as "good living."
