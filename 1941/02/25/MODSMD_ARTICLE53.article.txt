SENIOR PROM COVER-UP

COMES THE REVOLUTION

r EDITOR, SIR:
Perhaps you have noticed that the Daily articles
on the Senior Prom have three times stated that the
Prom chairman has co-operated completely with the
Activities Card File System. It is hardly possible that
the Daily staff inserted such a remark for its reading
value three successive times when such co-operation
hasn't been mentioned once where it has really ex
isted—in the Red Cross Drive Committee, the Sadie
Hawkins Sales Committee, and the Convalescent Home
Drive Committee, to mention but a few instances.
The only conclusion is that this statement was made
to the Daily by the Prom chairman, Dan Hays.
As Activity Files chairman, I know that the state
ment is untrue. When the Prom was planned for
Feb. 7, Dan, having been repeatedly requested to
select his committee chairmen, finally came into the
office little more than a week before that date.
Although he did not tell me, I discovered that he
had already notified some of his committee chairmen
of their appointments. Now, in the office, he was go
ing to pretend to select these people from the files.
After feigning work, he finally produced his list of
names. The Activity Files Committee agreed to ap
prove his list, with only a few changes, not because
he had fooled us, but because of the late date. No
point in making a fuss now, we figured.
The dance was postponed to March 7. Today, four
weeks after the approval of the committee chairmen,
none of them have come to the Activities File to
select their committee members.
Maybe they'll try the "late-date" angle again; it
won't woz-k this time.
The point is that all this talk about co-operation
where none exists is a cover-up for just the sort of
thing which the Activities File System wants to do
away with. The senior class should set a good ex
ample for other classes and the organizations at Stan
ford, yet what happens?
President Art Gore selects as his Prom chairman his
best friend and campaign manager, Dan Hays. Dan
Hays selects as his committee chairmen his good
friends and supporters. The result is that "you have to
be a friend of Art's and Dan's" to be on a senior com
mittee.
If this were a year ago, would Art and Dan have
put Bruce Jessup, Anne Townsend, Nell Plopper, or
Pete Whittlesey on their committees? Probably not,
but "the Senior Prom Committee is co-operating com
pletely with the Activity Files System."

EDITOR, SIR:
The quaint, homey crackerbox that we at Stan
ford affectionately call the Pavilion has approximately
two-hundred and fifty permanent seats from which
spectators can get an unobstructed view of both bas
kets and the floor. We would like to know why some
one hundred and eighty of these seats are reserved
for assorted free-list and privileged characters.
We have no objection to the bona fide working
press, but why should the fourth estate include fami
lies that in Italy would win medals for both parents;
B.A.C. employees accompanied by scions, heirs, maiden
aunts, confidential employees and trusted servants;
and unidentified persons whose sole claim to privilege
appears to be the particular sort of brassy dignity that
overawes our student police?
These estimable people usually appear just as the
varsity game gets under way and parade to their seats
with the aplomb and savoir faire of opera-goers about
to take their places in the Diamond Horseshoe.
If they constituted a more brilliant assemblage, wo
of the jaquerie might be resigned to our ignoble lot,
we might even cheer the appearance of the more popu
lar mmbers of the Pavilion royalty. But they don't
and we don't.
Our oppressors have raised our tuition; they have
raised our room rent; they have added mysterious
charges to our syllabus fees; now they encourage a
parasitical class to flaunt its privileges in our faces.
When they level a salt tax, a tea tax, and a stamp
tax, perhaps we will recognize an historical parallel.

SENIOR PROM COVER-UP

COMES THE REVOLUTION

r EDITOR, SIR:
Perhaps you have noticed that the Daily articles
on the Senior Prom have three times stated that the
Prom chairman has co-operated completely with the
Activities Card File System. It is hardly possible that
the Daily staff inserted such a remark for its reading
value three successive times when such co-operation
hasn't been mentioned once where it has really ex
isted—in the Red Cross Drive Committee, the Sadie
Hawkins Sales Committee, and the Convalescent Home
Drive Committee, to mention but a few instances.
The only conclusion is that this statement was made
to the Daily by the Prom chairman, Dan Hays.
As Activity Files chairman, I know that the state
ment is untrue. When the Prom was planned for
Feb. 7, Dan, having been repeatedly requested to
select his committee chairmen, finally came into the
office little more than a week before that date.
Although he did not tell me, I discovered that he
had already notified some of his committee chairmen
of their appointments. Now, in the office, he was go
ing to pretend to select these people from the files.
After feigning work, he finally produced his list of
names. The Activity Files Committee agreed to ap
prove his list, with only a few changes, not because
he had fooled us, but because of the late date. No
point in making a fuss now, we figured.
The dance was postponed to March 7. Today, four
weeks after the approval of the committee chairmen,
none of them have come to the Activities File to
select their committee members.
Maybe they'll try the "late-date" angle again; it
won't woz-k this time.
The point is that all this talk about co-operation
where none exists is a cover-up for just the sort of
thing which the Activities File System wants to do
away with. The senior class should set a good ex
ample for other classes and the organizations at Stan
ford, yet what happens?
President Art Gore selects as his Prom chairman his
best friend and campaign manager, Dan Hays. Dan
Hays selects as his committee chairmen his good
friends and supporters. The result is that "you have to
be a friend of Art's and Dan's" to be on a senior com
mittee.
If this were a year ago, would Art and Dan have
put Bruce Jessup, Anne Townsend, Nell Plopper, or
Pete Whittlesey on their committees? Probably not,
but "the Senior Prom Committee is co-operating com
pletely with the Activity Files System."

EDITOR, SIR:
The quaint, homey crackerbox that we at Stan
ford affectionately call the Pavilion has approximately
two-hundred and fifty permanent seats from which
spectators can get an unobstructed view of both bas
kets and the floor. We would like to know why some
one hundred and eighty of these seats are reserved
for assorted free-list and privileged characters.
We have no objection to the bona fide working
press, but why should the fourth estate include fami
lies that in Italy would win medals for both parents;
B.A.C. employees accompanied by scions, heirs, maiden
aunts, confidential employees and trusted servants;
and unidentified persons whose sole claim to privilege
appears to be the particular sort of brassy dignity that
overawes our student police?
These estimable people usually appear just as the
varsity game gets under way and parade to their seats
with the aplomb and savoir faire of opera-goers about
to take their places in the Diamond Horseshoe.
If they constituted a more brilliant assemblage, wo
of the jaquerie might be resigned to our ignoble lot,
we might even cheer the appearance of the more popu
lar mmbers of the Pavilion royalty. But they don't
and we don't.
Our oppressors have raised our tuition; they have
raised our room rent; they have added mysterious
charges to our syllabus fees; now they encourage a
parasitical class to flaunt its privileges in our faces.
When they level a salt tax, a tea tax, and a stamp
tax, perhaps we will recognize an historical parallel.

SENIOR PROM COVER-UP

COMES THE REVOLUTION

r EDITOR, SIR:
Perhaps you have noticed that the Daily articles
on the Senior Prom have three times stated that the
Prom chairman has co-operated completely with the
Activities Card File System. It is hardly possible that
the Daily staff inserted such a remark for its reading
value three successive times when such co-operation
hasn't been mentioned once where it has really ex
isted—in the Red Cross Drive Committee, the Sadie
Hawkins Sales Committee, and the Convalescent Home
Drive Committee, to mention but a few instances.
The only conclusion is that this statement was made
to the Daily by the Prom chairman, Dan Hays.
As Activity Files chairman, I know that the state
ment is untrue. When the Prom was planned for
Feb. 7, Dan, having been repeatedly requested to
select his committee chairmen, finally came into the
office little more than a week before that date.
Although he did not tell me, I discovered that he
had already notified some of his committee chairmen
of their appointments. Now, in the office, he was go
ing to pretend to select these people from the files.
After feigning work, he finally produced his list of
names. The Activity Files Committee agreed to ap
prove his list, with only a few changes, not because
he had fooled us, but because of the late date. No
point in making a fuss now, we figured.
The dance was postponed to March 7. Today, four
weeks after the approval of the committee chairmen,
none of them have come to the Activities File to
select their committee members.
Maybe they'll try the "late-date" angle again; it
won't woz-k this time.
The point is that all this talk about co-operation
where none exists is a cover-up for just the sort of
thing which the Activities File System wants to do
away with. The senior class should set a good ex
ample for other classes and the organizations at Stan
ford, yet what happens?
President Art Gore selects as his Prom chairman his
best friend and campaign manager, Dan Hays. Dan
Hays selects as his committee chairmen his good
friends and supporters. The result is that "you have to
be a friend of Art's and Dan's" to be on a senior com
mittee.
If this were a year ago, would Art and Dan have
put Bruce Jessup, Anne Townsend, Nell Plopper, or
Pete Whittlesey on their committees? Probably not,
but "the Senior Prom Committee is co-operating com
pletely with the Activity Files System."

EDITOR, SIR:
The quaint, homey crackerbox that we at Stan
ford affectionately call the Pavilion has approximately
two-hundred and fifty permanent seats from which
spectators can get an unobstructed view of both bas
kets and the floor. We would like to know why some
one hundred and eighty of these seats are reserved
for assorted free-list and privileged characters.
We have no objection to the bona fide working
press, but why should the fourth estate include fami
lies that in Italy would win medals for both parents;
B.A.C. employees accompanied by scions, heirs, maiden
aunts, confidential employees and trusted servants;
and unidentified persons whose sole claim to privilege
appears to be the particular sort of brassy dignity that
overawes our student police?
These estimable people usually appear just as the
varsity game gets under way and parade to their seats
with the aplomb and savoir faire of opera-goers about
to take their places in the Diamond Horseshoe.
If they constituted a more brilliant assemblage, wo
of the jaquerie might be resigned to our ignoble lot,
we might even cheer the appearance of the more popu
lar mmbers of the Pavilion royalty. But they don't
and we don't.
Our oppressors have raised our tuition; they have
raised our room rent; they have added mysterious
charges to our syllabus fees; now they encourage a
parasitical class to flaunt its privileges in our faces.
When they level a salt tax, a tea tax, and a stamp
tax, perhaps we will recognize an historical parallel.
