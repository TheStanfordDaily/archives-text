"Born in Paradise," by Arminc von Tempski; Literary Guild of Amer
ica, Inc., New York.
Instead of looking ahead to a paradise, Arminc von Tempski considers
that she is able to look back (o a paradise in the days of her childhood
and youth on the Island of Maui where he father was manager of one of
the large cattle ranches in Hawaii.

This may sound a little too much
like a steamship line's advertise
ment, but if one gets beyond the
idealized illustration on the jacket
and beyond the first page he will
find a poignant story of the gradual
eclipse of a child's world of security
and excitement by a world of inse
curity and responsibility.
STRANGE FAMILY
One's interest is held largely be
cause the von Tempskis wex-e an in
teresting family, not conventional in
the local sense. Louis von Tempski,
Armine's father, was the son of a
Polish aristocratic political exile
who led a romantic life commanding
armies in remote parts of the world,
finally settling in New Zealand.
Louis, while on his way around
the world at the age of 18 to seek
adventure, stopped off at the Island
of Maui where his mother had once
been governess in a wealthy Maui
family. The island immediately
captivated him and he determined to
seek his fortune there.
LEAD SOCIAL LIFE
In the last years of the 19th cen
tury he married Amy Wodehouse,
daughter of the British ambassador
to the Court of Hawaii. At the great
ranch house on the slopes of Halea
kala volcano they presided over
60,000 aci'es and a home filled with
a continual flow of house guests
(after the manner of the Islands) in
cluding everyone from English
nobles and diplomats to champion
ropers.
Louis von Tempski was a man
who enjoyed life in spite of local
criticism or English restraint. But
even though Armine was naturally
more like her father in spirit, the
reader gets a picture of Mrs. von
Tempski as a graceful, dignified,
charming English lady.—Adams

the world at the age of 18 to seek
adventure, stopped off at the Island
of Maui where his mother had once
been governess in a wealthy Maui
family. The island immediately
captivated him and he determined to
seek his fortune there.
LEAD SOCIAL LIFE
In the last years of the 19th cen
tury he married Amy Wodehouse,
daughter of the British ambassador
to the Court of Hawaii. At the great
ranch house on the slopes of Halea
kala volcano they presided over
60,000 aci'es and a home filled with
a continual flow of house guests
(after the manner of the Islands) in
cluding everyone from English
nobles and diplomats to champion
ropers.
Louis von Tempski was a man
who enjoyed life in spite of local
criticism or English restraint. But
even though Armine was naturally
more like her father in spirit, the
reader gets a picture of Mrs. von
Tempski as a graceful, dignified,
charming English lady.—Adams
"Born in Paradise," by Arminc von Tempski; Literary Guild of Amer
ica, Inc., New York.
Instead of looking ahead to a paradise, Arminc von Tempski considers
that she is able to look back (o a paradise in the days of her childhood
and youth on the Island of Maui where he father was manager of one of
the large cattle ranches in Hawaii.

This may sound a little too much
like a steamship line's advertise
ment, but if one gets beyond the
idealized illustration on the jacket
and beyond the first page he will
find a poignant story of the gradual
eclipse of a child's world of security
and excitement by a world of inse
curity and responsibility.
STRANGE FAMILY
One's interest is held largely be
cause the von Tempskis wex-e an in
teresting family, not conventional in
the local sense. Louis von Tempski,
Armine's father, was the son of a
Polish aristocratic political exile
who led a romantic life commanding
armies in remote parts of the world,
finally settling in New Zealand.
