# English Corner Is Now Faculty Parking Lot
## 
### 
Construction has begun on several
concrete barriers which will replace
the temporary chains and stop signs
blocking off the street from the Eng
lish Corner to the Engineering.
Corner. The space in front of the
English Corner has recently been
designated as a faculty parking lot
and students are reminded that the
same restrictions govern it as do the
parking lot behind the Education
Building.
