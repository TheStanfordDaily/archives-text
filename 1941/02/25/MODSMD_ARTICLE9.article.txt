# Excom to Talk To Dr. Wilbur On Honor Code
## Student Findings On Violation to Be Presented Tonight 
### 
Whether Stanford students will
continue ro lie allowed lo take ex
ams outside of classrooms may be
decided when Ex Committee meets
at the campus home of President
Ray Lyman Wilbur at 7:30 o'clock
tonight.
Ex Committee will present any and
all findings on violations of the Stan
ford Honor Code before Dr. Wilbur
for discussion and possible solution
at that time.
CODE INVESTIGATED
Evidence to be presented culmi
nates a week's investigation, includ
ing extensive questioning of faculty
members, precipitated by faculty
complaints on Honor Code violations
registered with the Administration.
Results of the week-long queries
will be sifted and prepared for the
evening meeting with Dr. Wilbur by
Excom at an earlier confab at 4:30
o'clock today in the A.S.S.U. com
mittee room.
FACULTY QUIZZED
The charge that Farm students are
in some instances guilty of violat
ing the famed Stanford Honor Code
was originally laid before Excom at
last Tuesday night's meeting, and
at that time Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U.
president, appointed each member of
the committee to interrogate certain
faculty members.
Jessup expressed the hope that by
means of these visits the student
leaders would be able to ascertain
the amount of cheating prevalent
and, subsequently, to formulate ideas
on what penalties, if any, should be
inflicted to curb the difficulty.
