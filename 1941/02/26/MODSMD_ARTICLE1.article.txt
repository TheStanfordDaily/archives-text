A DOLF HITLER has had it all his
way in Europe during the last
year. The Fuehrer's brand of diplo
macy (the "say uncle" variety),has
been most successful, particularly in
the Balkans.
Now it is Great Britain's turn,
and Anthony Eden and Co. are
taking their turn at cooking up a
deal. British diplomats have al
ways been rather good at fincgling
when they set their minds to it—
and the time has come.
History pointed out last week that
some sort of an agreement must be
brewing between England and
Greece. Otherwise the British would
not have occupied the island of
Lemnos. Turkey's announcement
that its non-aggression pact with
Bulgaria does not hold in case Ger
many uses Bulgaria as a base for an
invasion of Greece, indicated that
something was stiffening Turkish
backbones.
# * *
/'HEAT BRITAIN'S "excellent un
' derstanding" with Turkey and
Greece on "mutual defense" prob
lems, if it goes according to indica
tions, can create either of two situa
tions. It can stop the Nazi drive
into the Balkans by simply scaring
them out. Or it can bring about an
explosion that will shift the focal
point of the war and involve about
five more nations — hitherto fairly
neutral—in the conflict.
Hitler has shown no signs of
backing down. A dispatch from
Belgrade yesterday said that the
German army in Rumania has
been increased to about 450,000
troops, about half of which are
concentrated along the Danube
River just across from the Bul
garian border. This means that
about 100,000 more men have been
moved into Rumania in the last
three weeks.
Should British expeditionary
forces be sent into Turkey and
Greece, and should Hitler go ahead
with his march through Bulgaria
down to the Greek port of Salonika,
it would be impossible for Rumania
and Bulgaria to keep out of the con
flict. Bomb attacks on communica
tion lines, supply depots, and troop
concentrations would certainly take
place upon their territory.
* * *
JUGOSLAVIA would suffer for the
•* same reason, since it is the un
fortunate possessor of the only
railroad going directly from Ger
man territory to Greece. And, if
Turkey holds to her original claims,
she too would be involved in the
defense of the Dardanelles and Sa
lonika.
No capital in Europe can be
more baffling than Moscow. Evi
dently the think that
they are going to fight someone in
the very near future. But just who
they expect to fight is a moot
question.
Last night the Supreme Soviet
endorsed a 2G per cent increase in
Russia's military budget because of
"tenseness abroad" and doubled the
income taxes, which millions of
peasants must pay, for a speed-up
of arms production and defense
measures.

JN lIIS speech to the delegates,
Finance Commissar A. G. Zverev
said that the Soviet Union "enjoys
its peaceful labor due to a wise for
eign policy which is based on mili
tary might . . . but it cannot ignore
the tenseness abroad."
Which of the belligerent nations
does Josef Stalin fear? On one
hand, Hitler has never rctractcd
his statements in "Mein Kampf'
that Germany must take Ukraine
and the Urals. Moscow had given
every indication of being scared to
death of the Nazi forces. Perhaps
Stalin is hastily arming against
the day when Hitler starts out to
keep his word.
On the other hand, there may be
a secret agreement between Hitler
and Stalin. An agreement that will
send the Red Army down through
Iraq and Persia to the Persian Gulf,
or across Afghanistan to India.
And it would be the answer to a
great many Soviet problems. First,
they would have control of the
Mesopotamian oil fields. They don't
need oil particularly, but it would
be a handy thing to bargain with.

Belgrade yesterday said that the
German army in Rumania has
been increased to about 450,000
troops, about half of which are

about 100,000 more men have been

A DOLF HITLER has had it all his
way in Europe during the last
year. The Fuehrer's brand of diplo
macy (the "say uncle" variety),has
been most successful, particularly in
the Balkans.
Now it is Great Britain's turn,
and Anthony Eden and Co. are
taking their turn at cooking up a
deal. British diplomats have al
ways been rather good at fincgling
when they set their minds to it—
and the time has come.
History pointed out last week that
some sort of an agreement must be
brewing between England and
Greece. Otherwise the British would
not have occupied the island of
Lemnos. Turkey's announcement
that its non-aggression pact with
Bulgaria does not hold in case Ger
many uses Bulgaria as a base for an
invasion of Greece, indicated that
something was stiffening Turkish
backbones.

/'HEAT BRITAIN'S "excellent un
' derstanding" with Turkey and
Greece on "mutual defense" prob
lems, if it goes according to indica
tions, can create either of two situa
tions. It can stop the Nazi drive
into the Balkans by simply scaring
them out. Or it can bring about an
explosion that will shift the focal
point of the war and involve about
five more nations — hitherto fairly
neutral—in the conflict.
Hitler has shown no signs of
backing down. A dispatch from
Belgrade yesterday said that the
German army in Rumania has
been increased to about 450,000
troops, about half of which are
concentrated along the Danube
River just across from the Bul
garian border. This means that
about 100,000 more men have been
moved into Rumania in the last
three weeks.
Should British expeditionary
forces be sent into Turkey and
Greece, and should Hitler go ahead
with his march through Bulgaria
down to the Greek port of Salonika,
it would be impossible for Rumania
and Bulgaria to keep out of the con
flict. Bomb attacks on communica
tion lines, supply depots, and troop
concentrations would certainly take
place upon their territory.

JUGOSLAVIA would suffer for the
•* same reason, since it is the un
fortunate possessor of the only
railroad going directly from Ger
man territory to Greece. And, if
Turkey holds to her original claims,
she too would be involved in the
defense of the Dardanelles and Sa
lonika.
No capital in Europe can be
more baffling than Moscow. Evi
dently the think that
they are going to fight someone in
the very near future. But just who
they expect to fight is a moot
question.
Last night the Supreme Soviet
endorsed a 2G per cent increase in
Russia's military budget because of
"tenseness abroad" and doubled the
income taxes, which millions of
peasants must pay, for a speed-up
of arms production and defense
measures.

JN lIIS speech to the delegates,
Finance Commissar A. G. Zverev
said that the Soviet Union "enjoys
its peaceful labor due to a wise for
eign policy which is based on mili
tary might . . . but it cannot ignore
the tenseness abroad."
Which of the belligerent nations
does Josef Stalin fear? On one
hand, Hitler has never rctractcd
his statements in "Mein Kampf'
that Germany must take Ukraine
and the Urals. Moscow had given
every indication of being scared to
death of the Nazi forces. Perhaps
Stalin is hastily arming against
the day when Hitler starts out to
keep his word.
On the other hand, there may be
a secret agreement between Hitler
and Stalin. An agreement that will
send the Red Army down through
Iraq and Persia to the Persian Gulf,
or across Afghanistan to India.
And it would be the answer to a
great many Soviet problems. First,
they would have control of the
Mesopotamian oil fields. They don't
need oil particularly, but it would
be a handy thing to bargain with.
