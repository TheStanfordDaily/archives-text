# Halecki Views Polish Future
## Nation's Fate Hangs On Nazi Successes 
### 
In a clear, convincing voice Dr.
Oscar Halecki, noted Polish scholar,
told a large Tuesday Series audience
last night that the future of Poland
depends upon Hitler's success in his
present campaign, and whatever the
outcome may be, Poland's hope for
tomorrow cannot be expected to be
bright.
"My views on the future of Po
land are naturally personal and
private opinion," he declared.
"Thex'e are four possible alterna
tives: The first is Hitler's victory
in his present war. If this should
come true, then there is not much
hope, but Hitler will find the colo
nies the Nazis have established in
the center of Europe will be centers
of unrest."
Dr. Halecki's second point cov
ered a negotiated peace. He be
lieved that if this should come
about, the Poles and Nazis would
have the same trouble as under the
first point. He stated emphatically
that the Germans would never give
concessions to the Poles.
"My third point," he continued,
"is concerned with the defeat of Hit
ler and the consequent breakdown
of the totalitarian system all over
the world. The concluding possi
bility is a full liberation and a com
plete reconstruction of Poland, a
moral and spiritual reconstruction
for the future."
