# Anderson to Talk To Luncheon Club
## 
### 
Luncheon Club meets today at
noon in the Nitery with Dr. Fred
erick Anderson of the Romanic
languages department as the guest
speaker.
Dr. Anderson will contrast and
compare education 20 and 30 years
ago with education today in a talk
on "Education Today ar.d Yester
day." In addition to educational
facts, Dr. Anderson will give some
personal ideas on how to get an
education.
Believing in smaller institutions
for the best educational opportuni
ties, Dr. Anderson's talk should be
of special interest to students. Ad
