# Excom, Wilbur Agree Students Not Bearing Honor Responsibilities
## Value of Honor System Confirmed At Informal Conference; President Urges Increased Group Feeling 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Ex Committee took a strong shot in the arm last night and admitted
that Stanford students are not facing "individual and group responsi
bilities" under the Honor Code, in a meeting with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur at his campus home.
An educational campaign to curb violations will be instituted by the

committee, and students will con
tinue to be allowed to take exams
outside of classrooms.
"Abuse of the Honor Code lias
come from a few, but, like the rot
ten spots in an apple, we have to cut
it out," Dr. Wilbur told a total of
21 student leaders, Excom included,
Mrs. Wilbur, Dean of Women Mary
Yost, and Dean of Men John Bunn.
LETTER. STARTS IT
The special meeting with Dr. Wil
bur and the deans was precipitated
by a letter charging student tres
passing of the code, and by recent
faculty and alumni complaints.
"I think changing the classroom
system would be a direct slap in the
face to the Honor Code," declared
Dana Winters. "Before I came to
Stanford I had heard of two things,
the football team and the honor
system, and I marveled at the free
dom and saw no infringements. J.
believe revision would jeopardize
the honor system," he concluded.
JESSUP OPINION
Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president,
expressed the opinion the commit
tee would be "taking a backward
step" by revision of the code.
"The individual student can't
cheat if other students are wide
awake," Dr. Wilbur pointed out. He
stated there are two kinds of cheat
ers, those who "momentarily suc
cumb" to temptation, and "the fel
low who is naturally a cheater —
under your system he can grow up
and get away with it.
"How are you going to get that
1 per cent — why don't you throw
them out?" Dr. Wilbur challenged.
"The A.B. degree for me and for
the public is a guarantee of achieve
ment, and if you have any cheating
you have a 'dishonor' system. We
can't let this thing drift."
Excom met earlier yesterday in
the A.S.S.U. committee room to pre
pare for the evening meeting and, at
that time, drew up several sugges
tions for reform.
The committee cinched its belt as
a result of the two discussions, and
plans the following program:
1. Adequate room will be provided,
with faculty co-operation, for every
exam, so students will not be en
couraged to leave classrooms. With
adequate room, students can take al
ternate seats.
2. A campaign of student educa
tion, particularly for transfers, will
be undertaken.
3. Bluebook "pledge lines" should
be reworded to read, "No unper
mitted aid given or received, signed,
TOWNSEND TALKS
In regard to social regulations,
Anne Townsend, A.S.S.U. vice
president, said:
"The main amusement at present
is to evade the system we have."
Dr. Wilbur stated that he has been
"really very much pleased with the
way student government has worked
out here," but charged that students
have been smoking on the Quad. He
said he wished "somebody would in
vent a cigarette that would go out
as soon as you stop working on it,"
to prevent forest fires.
In his plea for student co-opera
tion and better understanding, Dr.
Wilbur smiled and said:
"I'm a Stanford man just like you
