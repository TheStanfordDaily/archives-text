For the first time in many a moon, a student has been chosen as assist
ant director of part of a Stanford production. Margo Crain, the Farm's first
dance major, has designed and will direct the dance numbers in "The
Bartered Bride."
The Smetana folk-opera is concerned mainly with peasants and the

dances reflect the theme of the play<
to a great degree. Most important
dance is the polka which is the finale
of the first act. The music for the
dance is one of the best known of
the opera.
The dance lasts five minutes and
is written in the catchy rhythmic
folk-music of the Czechoslovakian
natives. Twelve couples will take
part in the dance, including John
Barber, Joyce Glassman, Dave Jack
man, Eleanor Judell. Sam Knowles,
Jean Pennington, Jacques Poley,
Bill Quinn, Margaret Repetto, Gar
ret Starmer, Marianne Townsend.
and Quentin Warren.
A furiant number, danced to waltz
time, will be performed in the mid
dle of the second act. Every opera
of note has its ballet and this num
ber rounds out of the production to i
full operatic requirement. Two !
women and one man are in the num
ber, Margo Crain, Jacques Poley, !
and Sam Knowles.
"The Bartered Bride" will be pre
sented in Memorial Hall March 7
