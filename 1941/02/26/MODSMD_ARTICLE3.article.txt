### 
SHANGHAI, Wed., Feb. 26 (UP).
â€”France is strengthening her de
fenses in Indo-China and appears
prepared to fight rather than submit
to Thailand's territorial demands at
the Tokyo Peace Conference, occi
dental diplomats heard today.
New Thai demands were drawn
up, following extension of the Thai
land-Indo-China Armistice to March
7, it was understood, and have been
made known informally to the
French and Indo-Chinese delegates
in Tokyo. Nominally they are being
referred to Vichy for consideration
but actually the French have told
British and American sources in
Japan they will be rejected.
The attitude of the French and
Indo-Chinese delegates was de
scribed as a "great deal stiffer."
