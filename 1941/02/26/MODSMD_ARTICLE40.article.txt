# Farm Flyers Seek Wings
## 
### 
Motors roar and propellers spin
| this morning as a new CAA flight
I training program begins for some
! 50 Farm students who have enrolled
in the government-sponsored pro
gram at the Palo Alto Airport.
The landing field still bears a
slight resemblance to Lagunita but
has drained sufficiently to permit
operations, weather permitting.
Among the many sprouting wings
are three Farm women seeking their
licenses. Mary Jane Isham, Gamma
Phi Beta, Peggy Helms, Pi Beta Phi,
and Ann Ufer are taking to the air
along with their more rugged co
horts. Basketballer Bill Cowden is
trying his hand at loops and rolls
instead of fast-breaks.
