# Indians, Troy To Clash Today
## 
### 
Leaving last night on a delayed
trip to Los Angeles for a tilt with
s powerful U.S.C. squad, Stanford's
undefeated varsity rugby team goes
into the game decided favorites
because of their impressive record
in games played to date, including
two wins over a strong Olympic
Club squad.
The team entrained without the
presence of Advisory Coach Harry
Maloney, who is confined to his
Palo Alto home with a bad cold,
and is making the trip under the
chaperonage of Assistant Coach
Wiliaid Classen. They will return
immediately after the game this
afternoon, and will arrive in time
for classes tomorrow.
Led by little Jack Reynolds, rated
as the best freshman rugby prospect
to hit the Stanford turf in recent
years, the Papoose ruggers tangle
with a powerful Menlo Junior Col
lege fifteen on the varsity rugby
field at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
Given a complete rest yesterday
in order to prepare for this after
noon's tilt, the frosh are favored to
win on the basis of comparative
records, as is shown by their 6-5
win over Santa Rosa Junior Col
lege last Wednesday, a team which
whipped Menlo decisively two
weeks ago. In addition to Reynolds,
Bill Kreutzman and Don Bilton are
expected to star, although the whole
squad is sure to see action.
