# Burness Still Leads Robinson In Conference Scoring Race
## 
### 
Although he was outscored over
j the week-end by Jackie Robinson.
Ucla star forward, Stanford's Don
Burness held onto his conference
scoring lead with a 3-point margin.
His total to date is 106 points, while
the West wood flash has amassed 103
digits during the conference season.
The Stanford cagers show their
definite superiority in the Southern
Division not only by their position
on the top rung of the standings, but j
also by the scoring statistics, which j
place the entire starting Indian quin- |
tet among the first 12 scorers. And
four of the Indians are in the top |
six, with only Robinson and U.S.C.'s j
Bob Ormsby sneaking in to break up j
a clean sweep by the Dean-coached
hoopsters.
Kenny Davidson, in third place, is
far and away the best scoring guard
in the Southern Division, an honor

which was his last year, too. The
only other guard listed in the first
12 scorers is Johnny Luber, who
gave his total a terrific boost last
week-end while U.S.C. was drub
bing Cal twice. However, Davidson
has a 21-point lead over the Trojan
guard.
The Stanford forwards, Don Wil
liams and Fordy Anderson, are mov
ing along neck and neck with each
other in the scoring race, and al
though Anderson has a one-point
lead in total points scored, Williams
has tallied more field goals.

scoring lead with a 3-point margin.
His total to date is 106 points, while
the West wood flash has amassed 103
digits during the conference season.
The Stanford cagers show their
definite superiority in the Southern
Division not only by their position
on the top rung of the standings, but j
also by the scoring statistics, which j
place the entire starting Indian quin- |
tet among the first 12 scorers. And
four of the Indians are in the top |
six, with only Robinson and U.S.C.'s j
Bob Ormsby sneaking in to break up j
a clean sweep by the Dean-coached
hoopsters.
Kenny Davidson, in third place, is
far and away the best scoring guard
in the Southern Division, an honor

which was his last year, too. The
only other guard listed in the first
12 scorers is Johnny Luber, who
gave his total a terrific boost last
week-end while U.S.C. was drub
bing Cal twice. However, Davidson
has a 21-point lead over the Trojan
guard.
The Stanford forwards, Don Wil
liams and Fordy Anderson, are mov
ing along neck and neck with each
other in the scoring race, and al
though Anderson has a one-point
lead in total points scored, Williams
has tallied more field goals.
