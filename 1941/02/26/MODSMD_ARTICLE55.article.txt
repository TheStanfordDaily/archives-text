A STANFORD MAN sat down last night in
a bull session with a few members of the
Farm family.
And Doctor Wilbur chatted with members of
Excom, Men's and Women's Councils, and other
student representatives about the campus' most
intrinsic of intrinsics—the Honor Code.
It was a bull session pure and simple. And
the younger members of the Stanford family
walked away with the clear realization that they,
as students, had not been carrying out their
portion of the Honor Code contract.
It didn't mean any vast change in the outward
Scheme of things. But it meant a revitalization
of the inward workings of the famous system.
No one satirized the Honor Code as a defunct
organism. Hardly that. But no one raised a
question to the finding that Stanford students
had not accepted their group responsibilities
under the code.
No student in the informal conference knew of
an instance where a student in an examination
had challenged another for an obvious Honor
Code infringement. Figures for the past five
year period showed no case where a student
had reported an infraction to the proper Council.
In other words, protection of the principles
of the Honor Code has been increasingly left
up to the faculty. Twenty years ago the faculty
turned the responsibility over to the students in
the original Honor Code grant.
No one likes to be a tattler. No one advocates
that course purely and simply. But features
like student ostracism, pencil-tapping, and the
like have made similar systems work elsewhere.
And they used to work here.
A Stanford man of long standing laid the
cards on the table for his younger brothers and
sisters. And the students recognized that the
deck needed re-shuffling.
