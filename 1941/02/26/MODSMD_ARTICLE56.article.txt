# Something Old, Something New

### 
OUT with the old order, in with the new. In
this rapidly and unexpectedly changing
world and whirl of today, so seems to be the
thought, the purpose, and the trend of many,
many moderns. But, despite the fact that the
"new" may be of a constructive nature, it is
none the less a difficult task to oust the "old."
People just do not, from force of habit, find
anything which is new digestible unless it is
a short cut to an easier existence. New ideas
cut against the grain. New ideas ruff the hair
the wrong way.
And frankly, recent doings of the Activities
Card Files have ruffed the hair of many Stanford
old-timers the wrong way. Particularly so the
seniors. For four years now, they have been
appointed as a matter of course and merit to
various and sundry campus committees.
More directly, they questioned the value of
trotting down and filling out an Activities Card
Files autobiography, since only half a year
remained before they stepped over the brink
of graduation into that abyss beyond.
Evidence of this fact was painfully brought
front and center yesterday as a result of a
letter published in Campus Opinion and writ
ten by Betty Avery, co-chairman of the Activi
ties Card File. That letter directed its syntac
tical missiles at the chairman of the Senior Prom
Committee, who Betty Avery felt had been
attempting to pull the proverbial wool over the
drawers of her card file. She has coddled and
mothered her new and constructive program
well.
As it turns out now, her stroke was unneces
sary though at the time it appeared to her that
it was needed. She had merely misinterpreted
the facts involved in the case.
The naked facts as they now stand show that
the Senior Prom chairman selected six of the
ten members of his all-senior committee from
the cards of persons duly registered in the Card
Files. And the other four members were se

lected from the campus at large because at the
date of selection, over three weeks ago, only
25 senior men were registered in the files.
This, then, is the point to be stressed. There
were at that time only 25 senior men catalogued
in the Card Files. Those few represented only
approximately 8 per cent of their total Stanford
number.
It is true that since this Senior Prom infesta
tion came to a head many more seniors, both
men and women, have signed Activities cards.
But the seeds of the infestation remain yet, be
cause the majority of seniors have not taken
the trouble to sign up.
They still resist the new and cling to the old
with schoolboy determination. Their immedi
ate future, these next four months, they feel will
be little altered if they do not fall in line with
the remainder of the campus, a remainder which
is now a majority.
An appeal has been made for co-operation
with a plan which is new and which will be of
benet in the future. Do not think in short-run
terms. This is a long-run situation. The seniors
could help by adding their weight.—B. A.

the remainder of the campus, a remainder which
is now a majority.
An appeal has been made for co-operation

OUT with the old order, in with the new. In
this rapidly and unexpectedly changing
world and whirl of today, so seems to be the
thought, the purpose, and the trend of many,
many moderns. But, despite the fact that the
"new" may be of a constructive nature, it is
none the less a difficult task to oust the "old."
People just do not, from force of habit, find
anything which is new digestible unless it is
a short cut to an easier existence. New ideas
cut against the grain. New ideas ruff the hair
the wrong way.
And frankly, recent doings of the Activities
Card Files have ruffed the hair of many Stanford
old-timers the wrong way. Particularly so the
seniors. For four years now, they have been
appointed as a matter of course and merit to
various and sundry campus committees.
More directly, they questioned the value of
trotting down and filling out an Activities Card
Files autobiography, since only half a year
remained before they stepped over the brink
of graduation into that abyss beyond.
Evidence of this fact was painfully brought
front and center yesterday as a result of a
letter published in Campus Opinion and writ
ten by Betty Avery, co-chairman of the Activi
ties Card File. That letter directed its syntac
tical missiles at the chairman of the Senior Prom
Committee, who Betty Avery felt had been
attempting to pull the proverbial wool over the
drawers of her card file. She has coddled and
mothered her new and constructive program
well.
As it turns out now, her stroke was unneces
sary though at the time it appeared to her that
it was needed. She had merely misinterpreted
the facts involved in the case.
The naked facts as they now stand show that
the Senior Prom chairman selected six of the
ten members of his all-senior committee from
the cards of persons duly registered in the Card
Files. And the other four members were se

lected from the campus at large because at the
date of selection, over three weeks ago, only
25 senior men were registered in the files.
This, then, is the point to be stressed. There
were at that time only 25 senior men catalogued
in the Card Files. Those few represented only
approximately 8 per cent of their total Stanford
number.
It is true that since this Senior Prom infesta
tion came to a head many more seniors, both
men and women, have signed Activities cards.
But the seeds of the infestation remain yet, be
cause the majority of seniors have not taken
the trouble to sign up.
They still resist the new and cling to the old
with schoolboy determination. Their immedi
ate future, these next four months, they feel will
be little altered if they do not fall in line with
