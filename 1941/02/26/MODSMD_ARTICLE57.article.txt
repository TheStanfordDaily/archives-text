### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
NO RANDOM HARVEST
Stanford debaters are lining up a transconti
nental tour that will take them back into the "ivy
league." (I guess they have an ivy league in debate,
too.)
The debate manager has been carrying on rather
extensive correspondence with the managers in the
East and thinks maybe he has discovered something
fundamental about the schools by the way they write
letters.
Vassar, Yale, and Princeton all scrawl replies in
ink on a small half-sheet of letterhead. None of them
type letters. This group makes up the "social heri
tage of the eastern-seaboard" classification.
The debate manager reports, though, that as his
correspondence moved westward—even a little ways
—he found the typewriter rather generally used. Cor
nell not only typed replies but also gave up the en
graved or printed letterhead and used a standard
size piece of white typing paper.
This is the westward tide of democracy.

VSf/E HEARD Darius Milhaud play and lecture here
last week. And then, last Saturday night, we
saw him conduct the San Francisco Symphony orches
tra in his latest symphony (it didn't have a name —
just symphony). If the music were not .so inconse
quential, it would fit Elliott Paul's description of the
modern French musician who composed things "for
18 stratoplanes and an airplane propeller."

They announced in Roble the other day that, after
the Sadie Hawkins dance, someone found "two wet
blankets" in the Roble lobby.

'J'HEN there was the fellow who got his hands on
two comps—you know, Annie Oaklies—for the
symphony last Friday. He phoned that new woman
he'd had his eye on for some time. She said okay, so
he donned his neatest pin-stripe and picked her up.
She was a few minutes late, so he berated her
all the way up Bayshore. They got to the war Memo
rial Opera House and wondered why things were so
dark.
They beat on the doors and finally succeeded in
rousing some sort of night watchman. "We're sorry
we're late to the symphony, but can you let us in?"
the smooth one said.
"Oh, that was this afternoon," the watchman re
plied, clicking the key in their faces.
So they went to see the latest Mickey Rooney show
instead.
