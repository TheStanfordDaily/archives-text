# CAMPUS OPINION

ATTENTION, CARD FILES

EDITOR, SIR:
In lieu of the misunderstanding created by the
Senior Prom Committee appointments, I should like
to clarify certain points which should aid in making
the Activity Files a continued success.
If the chairman of the files may feel that our co
operation was lacking, we tender our sincere regrets
for our part, we found her co-operation absolutely be
yond reproach. Further, we feel that under her able
direction the Activity Files will come to play a wider
and wider role in campus activities.
The appointment problem this year was briefly
this: all committee-heads must be seniors; there are,
practically speaking, no senior men in the files. Sen
iors, in general, with a half year ahead, are not much
interested in committee work.
The problem of the Daily publicity was undoubt
edly one of those things which goes through too many
mouths before it reaches print. Neither myself nor
any member of the committee ever pretended in our
relations with Daily men that the application of the
Activity Files to the selection of senior men, because
of the considerations above, could be anything but
farcical.
Let not the Activity Files Committee, and particu
larly its chairman, be discouraged by this seeming
unco-operativeness in the senior class. We are, after
all, the last class to begin Stanford uninitiated in the
progressive spirit which has fathered the file, and
which is exemplified by its heads.
After our departure in June, the file will undoubt
edly spread its already almost all-inclusive sphere to
reap good works in other fields.
With sincere regrets for making you feel disap
pointed in us, and personally best wishes to Betty
Avery and to you, Phil Rosenthall, for the growth and
continued benefits of the Activity File, I remain
Dan Hays,
Senior Prom Committee

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
A voice from the radio tells us we must keep
our fundamental rights: right of free speech, freedom
of the press, and right of assembly.
"We must fight for our American way of life." And
then the music continues.
Let us only say this: Hitler, some years ago, began
telling the Germans that they must fight for the Ger
man way of life, the German way of thinking, racial
pride, or some similar vague and disguised concept.
Finally, that nation began persecuting the Jews, sub
jugating Czechoslovakia, crushing Poland, Norway, the
Low Countries, and France.
Who is telling us to fight for the American life?
Why? Will it lead to ?
We venture to say that Hitler was crying to the
Germans for "national defense" about four years ago.

to clarify certain points which should aid in making
the Activity Files a continued success.
If the chairman of the files may feel that our co
operation was lacking, we tender our sincere regrets
for our part, we found her co-operation absolutely be
yond reproach. Further, we feel that under her able
direction the Activity Files will come to play a wider
and wider role in campus activities.
The appointment problem this year was briefly
this: all committee-heads must be seniors; there are,
practically speaking, no senior men in the files. Sen
iors, in general, with a half year ahead, are not much
interested in committee work.
The problem of the Daily publicity was undoubt
edly one of those things which goes through too many
mouths before it reaches print. Neither myself nor
any member of the committee ever pretended in our
relations with Daily men that the application of the
Activity Files to the selection of senior men, because
of the considerations above, could be anything but
farcical.
Let not the Activity Files Committee, and particu
larly its chairman, be discouraged by this seeming
unco-operativeness in the senior class. We are, after
all, the last class to begin Stanford uninitiated in the
progressive spirit which has fathered the file, and
which is exemplified by its heads.
After our departure in June, the file will undoubt
edly spread its already almost all-inclusive sphere to
reap good works in other fields.
With sincere regrets for making you feel disap
pointed in us, and personally best wishes to Betty
Avery and to you, Phil Rosenthall, for the growth and
continued benefits of the Activity File, I remain
Dan Hays,
Senior Prom Committee

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
A voice from the radio tells us we must keep
our fundamental rights: right of free speech, freedom
of the press, and right of assembly.
"We must fight for our American way of life." And
then the music continues.
Let us only say this: Hitler, some years ago, began
telling the Germans that they must fight for the Ger
man way of life, the German way of thinking, racial
pride, or some similar vague and disguised concept.
Finally, that nation began persecuting the Jews, sub
jugating Czechoslovakia, crushing Poland, Norway, the
Low Countries, and France.
Who is telling us to fight for the American life?
Why? Will it lead to ?
We venture to say that Hitler was crying to the
Germans for "national defense" about four years ago.
