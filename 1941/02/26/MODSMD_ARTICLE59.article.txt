"Blitzkrieg in the West," at the
Princess Theater, San Francisco.
"Blitzkrieg in the West" is a Ger
man propaganda picture. About that
there can be no doubt.
Photographed by official German
cameramen, it concerns the Nazi
drive through the Lowlands and
France which resulted last June in
the utter humiliation of the French.
Rs hero is Adolf Hitler. Its sup
porting cast is the German army
and subjugated populations. These
characters are not "hams." They
play their parts superbly.
Beginning with a brief statement
that "due to the threat of enemy in
vasion through the Lowlands" the
German army had decided to step
into The Netherlands and Belgium
itself. "Blitzkrieg in the West" re
cords the drive upon and conquest
of France.
With graphic clarity unfold the
bombings and street fighting, cap
tures and destruction, of the light
ning war, winding up with Hitler's
peace in the last reel.
The picture's photography is ex
cellent, while the music dubbed in
by the UFA producers is equally ef
fective, for the sound track's sym
phonic climax is calculated to re
inforce the psychological effect of
the ultimate Nazi victory. The Eng
lish commentators are very poor and
the climax might be criticized be
cause of its episodic rather than
panoramic effect.—Steif
