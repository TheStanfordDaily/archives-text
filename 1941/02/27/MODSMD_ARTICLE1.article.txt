### Jean Nowell 
IVAZI psychology is rather like
that of a small bully in a street
fight. As long as his opponent
doesn't land a blow he is all blus
ter. But if he is tagged, even very
lightly, he begins to yell and make
threats.
A good example of this sort oT
screaming took place in Buenos
Aires yesterday, when German
Ambassador Edmund von Ther
mann made a statement to the
press. Von Thermann said in
part:
"I hope there will be maintained
here an indispensable common re
spect for our nationals who have
contributed to the creation of in
dustries and commerce, and have
given their active life to this young
nation."
* ■* *
64/ 'OMMON respect" is quite right.
J The Argentine Republic has no
business treating the German na
tionals within its borders as if it
didn't trust them. Why, it was only
last May that Argentine police
seized secret radio stations and
broke up Nazi-inspired street dem
onstrations.
The Argentine Germans are
good, solid home-folk who, no
doubt, Iniild radio stations and in
cite riots out of sheer exubera|ce.
And it's too had that just recently
the government has been so wicked
as to make an attempt to break up
their cosy little communities, and
reorganize their schools. Now,
maybe, they won't be able to bring
up their kiddies by the rules so
carefully set down in "Mein
Kampf."
Ambassador von Thermann is
sorry to hear that the Argentine
people are so misguided because, he
says, "trade relations with the
United States have no future" and
American aid to Great Britain is
only a British "dream." Also the
Argentinians must not forget Japan,
"who is now on Germany's side."
* * *
TUST back from a flying trip to
*" Berlin, the ambassador pointed
out that post-war Germany would
become the biggest buyer of South
American goods. What the gentle
man implied was that Argentina
had better string along now or she'd
get it in the neck, comes the big
victory.
Illogically, hut interestingly, he
added that United States aid was
important in the first world war
because that aid went to France,
England. Russia, and Italy. It is
now "unimportant" because Italy
is an Axis partner, France is oc
cupied by the German army, and
Russia is neutral.
It seems to this writer that if
United States aid is concentrated on
one power instead of being distrib
uted among four, it should be about
four times as effective. The ambas
sador must have a very complex
mind.
* * *
comes from this
speech, in the way of a pro or
con action from the Argentine gov
ernment will be of tremendous im
port in Washington. If Argentina
decides to buddy up with the Nazi
buzz-saw, we cannot click our
tongues and go on about our busi
ness.
German infiltration into all the
republics has been a matter of
grave concern to us for some time.
W ere the great Argentine nation to
submit to Nazi economic and po
litical domination, it is probable
that the rest of the South-of-the
bordcr nations would soon follow
suit. And then. "Cuidado!"
That reference to Japan in the
ambassador's speech was not purely
rhetorical. From Washington, yes
terday, came word that Japan is do
ing a very neat job of sabotaging the
American rearmament race ... by
outbidding her in the South Ameri
can markets.
* * *
HPHIS competition began about
eight months ago, and has been
"pyramiding tremendously." Par
ticularly important have been Japa
nese purchases of mercury, a highly
important military item. It is be
lieved in "some Washington circles"
that quantities of this and other
strategic materials have been find
ing their way into Germany through
Japan.

mann made a statement to the
press. Von Thermann said in

"I hope there will be maintained
here an indispensable common re

contributed to the creation of in
dustries and commerce, and have
given their active life to this young
nation."

64/ 'OMMON respect" is quite right.
J The Argentine Republic has no
business treating the German na
tionals within its borders as if it
didn't trust them. Why, it was only
last May that Argentine police
seized secret radio stations and
broke up Nazi-inspired street dem
onstrations.
The Argentine Germans are
good, solid home-folk who, no
doubt, Iniild radio stations and in
cite riots out of sheer exubera|ce.
And it's too had that just recently
the government has been so wicked
as to make an attempt to break up
their cosy little communities, and
reorganize their schools. Now,
maybe, they won't be able to bring
up their kiddies by the rules so
carefully set down in "Mein
Kampf."
Ambassador von Thermann is
sorry to hear that the Argentine
people are so misguided because, he
says, "trade relations with the
United States have no future" and
American aid to Great Britain is
only a British "dream." Also the
Argentinians must not forget Japan,
"who is now on Germany's side."
* * *
TUST back from a flying trip to
*" Berlin, the ambassador pointed
out that post-war Germany would
become the biggest buyer of South
American goods. What the gentle
man implied was that Argentina
had better string along now or she'd
get it in the neck, comes the big
victory.
Illogically, hut interestingly, he
added that United States aid was
important in the first world war
because that aid went to France,
England. Russia, and Italy. It is
now "unimportant" because Italy
is an Axis partner, France is oc
cupied by the German army, and
Russia is neutral.
It seems to this writer that if
United States aid is concentrated on
one power instead of being distrib
uted among four, it should be about
four times as effective. The ambas
sador must have a very complex
mind.
* * *
comes from this
speech, in the way of a pro or
con action from the Argentine gov
ernment will be of tremendous im
port in Washington. If Argentina
decides to buddy up with the Nazi
buzz-saw, we cannot click our
tongues and go on about our busi
ness.
German infiltration into all the
republics has been a matter of
grave concern to us for some time.
W ere the great Argentine nation to
submit to Nazi economic and po
litical domination, it is probable
that the rest of the South-of-the
bordcr nations would soon follow
suit. And then. "Cuidado!"
That reference to Japan in the
ambassador's speech was not purely
rhetorical. From Washington, yes
terday, came word that Japan is do
ing a very neat job of sabotaging the
American rearmament race ... by
outbidding her in the South Ameri
can markets.
* * *
HPHIS competition began about
eight months ago, and has been
"pyramiding tremendously." Par
ticularly important have been Japa
nese purchases of mercury, a highly
important military item. It is be
lieved in "some Washington circles"
that quantities of this and other
strategic materials have been find
ing their way into Germany through
Japan.
IVAZI psychology is rather like
that of a small bully in a street
fight. As long as his opponent
doesn't land a blow he is all blus
ter. But if he is tagged, even very
lightly, he begins to yell and make
threats.

business treating the German na
tionals within its borders as if it
didn't trust them. Why, it was only
last May that Argentine police
seized secret radio stations and
broke up Nazi-inspired street dem
onstrations.
The Argentine Germans are
good, solid home-folk who, no
doubt, Iniild radio stations and in
cite riots out of sheer exubera|ce.
And it's too had that just recently
the government has been so wicked
as to make an attempt to break up
their cosy little communities, and
reorganize their schools. Now,
maybe, they won't be able to bring
up their kiddies by the rules so
carefully set down in "Mein
Kampf."
Ambassador von Thermann is
sorry to hear that the Argentine
people are so misguided because, he
says, "trade relations with the
United States have no future" and
American aid to Great Britain is
only a British "dream." Also the
Argentinians must not forget Japan,
"who is now on Germany's side."

TUST back from a flying trip to

out that post-war Germany would
become the biggest buyer of South
American goods. What the gentle
man implied was that Argentina
had better string along now or she'd
get it in the neck, comes the big
victory.
Illogically, hut interestingly, he
added that United States aid was
important in the first world war
because that aid went to France,
England. Russia, and Italy. It is
now "unimportant" because Italy
is an Axis partner, France is oc
cupied by the German army, and
Russia is neutral.
It seems to this writer that if
United States aid is concentrated on
one power instead of being distrib
uted among four, it should be about
four times as effective. The ambas
sador must have a very complex
mind.

comes from this
speech, in the way of a pro or
con action from the Argentine gov
ernment will be of tremendous im
port in Washington. If Argentina
decides to buddy up with the Nazi
buzz-saw, we cannot click our
tongues and go on about our busi
ness.
German infiltration into all the
republics has been a matter of
grave concern to us for some time.
W ere the great Argentine nation to
submit to Nazi economic and po
litical domination, it is probable
that the rest of the South-of-the
bordcr nations would soon follow
suit. And then. "Cuidado!"
That reference to Japan in the
ambassador's speech was not purely
rhetorical. From Washington, yes
terday, came word that Japan is do
ing a very neat job of sabotaging the
American rearmament race ... by
outbidding her in the South Ameri
can markets.

IVAZI psychology is rather like
that of a small bully in a street
fight. As long as his opponent
doesn't land a blow he is all blus
ter. But if he is tagged, even very
lightly, he begins to yell and make
threats.
A good example of this sort oT
screaming took place in Buenos
Aires yesterday, when German
Ambassador Edmund von Ther
mann made a statement to the
press. Von Thermann said in
part:
"I hope there will be maintained
here an indispensable common re
spect for our nationals who have
contributed to the creation of in
dustries and commerce, and have
given their active life to this young
nation."
