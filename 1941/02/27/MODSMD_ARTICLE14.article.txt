# Gore Predicts Prom Sellout
## Only 100 Bids Left For Senior Dance 
### 
All bids to the Senior Prom will
be sold by noon today.
This was the prediction of Art
Gore, senior president, last night
when it was learned that 500 stu
dents had paid their $3.50 yesterday
for bids to the Kyser dance in one
of the largest one-day sales on rec
ord. Only 100 bids are left.
At one time during the day over
25 students waited in line in front
of the A.S.S.U. office for a chance to
buy tickets. With the dance set for
Friday, March 7, a week and a half
away, the complete sellout seemed
imminent and, according to A.S.S.U.
and class officials, was the "fastest
sell-out that any Stanford dance has
ever had."
Meanwhile Kay Kyser, who ap
peared on his coast-to-coast NBC
radio show last night from San
Diego, will continue to work on his
new picture in Hollywood at RKO
studios and will come north espe
cially for his Farm engagement on
March 7.
Kay Kyser organized his orches
tra while he was a student at North
Carolina. If it hadn't proved suc
cessful he would now be a lawyer
instead of a band leader. The en
gagement which jumped him into
the big-time classification was his
stay at the Bal Tabarin in San
Francisco. At the present time he is
rated by experts as one of the two
or three top "name" bands in the
country.
He holds the all-time record for
one-night stand audiences and has
played at popular supper-rooms
throughout the nation. With his 14-
piece band, Kyser will bring beauti
ful Ginny Simms, Harry Babbitt,
Sully Mason, and "Ish Kabibble."
Dress for the Prom will be semi
formal, with dancing from 9 to 1
o'clock.

one-night stand audiences and has
played at popular supper-rooms
throughout the nation. With his 14-
piece band, Kyser will bring beauti
ful Ginny Simms, Harry Babbitt,
Sully Mason, and "Ish Kabibble."
Dress for the Prom will be semi
formal, with dancing from 9 to 1
o'clock.
All bids to the Senior Prom will
be sold by noon today.
This was the prediction of Art
Gore, senior president, last night
when it was learned that 500 stu
dents had paid their $3.50 yesterday
for bids to the Kyser dance in one
of the largest one-day sales on rec
ord. Only 100 bids are left.
At one time during the day over
25 students waited in line in front
of the A.S.S.U. office for a chance to
buy tickets. With the dance set for
Friday, March 7, a week and a half
away, the complete sellout seemed
imminent and, according to A.S.S.U.
and class officials, was the "fastest
sell-out that any Stanford dance has
ever had."
Meanwhile Kay Kyser, who ap
peared on his coast-to-coast NBC
radio show last night from San
Diego, will continue to work on his
new picture in Hollywood at RKO
studios and will come north espe
cially for his Farm engagement on
March 7.
Kay Kyser organized his orches
tra while he was a student at North
Carolina. If it hadn't proved suc
cessful he would now be a lawyer
instead of a band leader. The en
gagement which jumped him into
the big-time classification was his
stay at the Bal Tabarin in San
Francisco. At the present time he is
rated by experts as one of the two
or three top "name" bands in the
country.
He holds the all-time record for
one-night stand audiences and has
played at popular supper-rooms
throughout the nation. With his 14-
piece band, Kyser will bring beauti
ful Ginny Simms, Harry Babbitt,
Sully Mason, and "Ish Kabibble."
Dress for the Prom will be semi
