# 'Animal' to Open Tomorrow at 8:15
## 
### 
Second of this quarter's revitalized
Ram's Head readings will be given
tomorrow and Saturday nights at
8:15 o'clock in the Education Au
ditorium. The play is "The Male
Animal," by James Thurber and
Elliot Nugent.
Starting last month with "The
Gentle People," Ram's Head has
planned a full program of plays pre
sented in the intimate manner. Dead
for two years, the readings in the
past had served as vehicles for such
by-gone theater greats as J. P. Kahn,
Melba Rae Toombs, Jim Copp, and
many others.
The cast includes: Chuck Phelps
as Joe Ferguson, I\'ancy Burkett as
Patricia, Pat Allen as Ellen, Jack
Dawson as Tommy, Lucille Terrell
as Cleota, Wes Howell as Wally
Myers, John High as Dean Damon,
Quentin Warren as Ed Keller, Ted
Marcuse as Michael, Donna Good
heart as Myrtle, and Bob Libbott as
a reporter.
