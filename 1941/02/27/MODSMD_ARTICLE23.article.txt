# British Diplomats Act To Crimp Axis Offense By Balkan Checkmate
## English Meet 'Panzer' Troops; Take Naval Base 
### United Press 
Great Britain struck mighty blows
Wednesday at the Axis powers'
preparations for an all-out spring
offensive and moved, with quick
diplomatic strokes, to checkmate
Adolf Hitler in the Balkans.
Both Italy and Germany felt the
fury of Britain's assaults, with Be
nito Mussolini's African empire suf
fering new damaging blows despite
the appearance of Nazi mechanized
"panzer" troops in the Libyan des
ert and the Royal Air Force stepping
up its round-the-clock bombardment
of German objectives.
Taking advantage of a vulnerable
chink in Hitler's armor, British For
eign Secrclary Anthony Eden began
negotiations in Ankara seeking to
line up Turkey, Jugoslavia, and
Greece in a bloc to bar Germany's
threatened thrust through Bulgaria
against Greece.
The British know Hitler's objec
tive is to use intimidation rather
than arms in mopping up southeast
ern Europe, that he is wary of wag
ing war on two fronts such as meant
disaster for Kaiser Wilhem.
BALKAN FRONT
Eden's task is to build up a Balkan
front confronting Germany with the
prospect of war. if she strikes down
upon Greece.
Wednesday was a day of decisive
action on warfronts stretching from
the North Sea to the Equator, in
cluding:
1. A British announcement that
British naval and land forces have
seized and occupied Italy's tiny
island and seaplane base of Castel
Oritzo on Turkey's southern coast
in a move that may herald a Brit
ish assault on the Italian Dodecanese
island group at the gateway to the
Dardanelles.
2. Capture of the Italian Somali
land capital of 'Mogadiscio in a com
bined British assault by land, sea
and air to climax one of the swift
est victories of the entire war and,
according to British officials at Nai
robi in Kenya, to "doom" Italy's
weakened hold on southern Ethiopia
and Somaliland.

3. The first clash in North Africa
between British troops and German
mechanized forces rushed to Italy's
aid, a clash which the German and
Italian high commands claimed gave
the German "panzer" units a deci
sive victory near Agedabia near the
frontier between eastern and west
ern Libya. The British said that if
such an engagement occurred it
probably was a small one.
4. Germany's Channel "invasion
coast" again was ablaze early Thurs
day as the Royal Air Force carried
out a round-the-clock assault which
some British Parliamentary circles
believed might be the forerunner of
"Coventry-type" British vengeance
aimed at getting the jump on Hitler's
threatened all-out U-boat and aei'ial
warfare this spring.

offensive and moved, with quick
diplomatic strokes, to checkmate
Adolf Hitler in the Balkans.

chink in Hitler's armor, British For
eign Secrclary Anthony Eden began
negotiations in Ankara seeking to

Dardanelles.
2. Capture of the Italian Somali
land capital of 'Mogadiscio in a com
bined British assault by land, sea
and air to climax one of the swift
est victories of the entire war and,
according to British officials at Nai
robi in Kenya, to "doom" Italy's
weakened hold on southern Ethiopia
and Somaliland.
