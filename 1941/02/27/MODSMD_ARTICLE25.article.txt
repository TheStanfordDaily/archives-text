# Allen Writes New Version Of Libretto
## 'Bartered Bride' Set In Streamlined Form For Card Production 
### 
Stanford's first opera, "The Bar
tered Bride," will hit the boards of
Memorial Hall in a completely
.streamlined form. Opera in English
is usually groaned at, so Stanford
producers cast out mid-Victorian
phrasing by having Keith Allan,
Stanford student, recast the score.
The original translation of the
Czechoslovakian folk-opera was
made in the 1880's by Libushka Bar
tusek in the language of the times,
which made the wording cumber
gome and old-fashioned.
15ASIC MEANING
With the aid of Dr. Herbert Jan
Popper, Allan delved into the orig
inal Bohemian version of the libretto
by Smetana to get the basic mean
ing of the play, and unearthed the
broad vernacular which the com
poser used to carry the peasant
theme of the opera.
In many instances, it was found
that high-flown literary English had
been substituted for the every-day
language of the peasants, with fre
quent repetition where adequate
translation could not be found.
'DOWN TO EARTH'
In its new form, American idiom
has been used where Czechoslovak
ian vernacular was found, making
the wording as down to eai*th as Ira
Gershwin's libretto of "Of Thee I
Sing." An example is seen where
a chorus originally had the words
"and all is set and done" repeated
endlessly. Allan substituted "every
thing is now 0.K.," which carries the
meaning quite as adequately, and
brings the opera into the range of
modem vocabularies.
Stanford is not the first to realize
that the first translation was too
stilted for modern audiences. The
Metropolitan Opera Company gave
the opera last spring, and gave a
modernized version' to meet the
tastes of American audiences.
Allan has done work in radio and
light opera, specializing in script in
many instances. He realized that
Smetana was trying to present
Czech humor and broad comedy in
his opera, and that his main idea
was characterization by music.
WORDS IMPORTANT
"Today," Allan declared, "words
have to represent ideas, and getting
the words across is the first task of
those who wish to make opera in
English a success in the future."
"The Bartered Bride" was writ
ten in 1850 in Bohemian and has
had two translations, one in German
and one in English. The opera is
noted for its national flavor, the mu
sic representing the folk-tunes to a
great degree, making for catchy
rhythms which set audiences to
swinging in time.

women to take over men's work in J
war factories.
