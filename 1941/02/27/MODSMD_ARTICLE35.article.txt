# Cards Meet Bears Twice In Final Tilts
## 
### 
Lacking just a little of the color
that might be attached to it if the
participants were coming down the
home stretch neck and neck, Big
Series time rolls around again with
a pair of contests this week-end. Fri
day night's game will be played in
the California Men's Gymnasium at
Berkeley with Saturday night's con
test taking place in the Pavilion.
But it's still the Big Series and,
despite the fact that Stanford has
already clinched the league crown,
there will be no let up for these
last two games of the regular con
ference season. It has been 21 years
since a Stanford basketball team has
swept the Big Series, and the In
dians will be driving hard in both
games to break that record.
Stanford had great basketball

teams during the Luisetti ei'a; there
is no doubt about that. Yet even
Hank's great teams never took the
Bears down the line in four consecu
tive conference games in one year.
The 21-year-old record and Cal's
fight for second place in the South
ern Division standings are the two
big things at stake in this final two
night stand of the Cal-Stanford
1941 hoop series.
While practice sessions have been
rolling along smoothly for Stan
ford's championship quintet, the
same cannot be said for the basket
ball situation up at Berkeley, where
a team that reached its peak in mid
season hit the skids last week-end
as it dropped a pair to U.S.C.
Coach Nibs Price still hasn't a defi
nite first team, Captain John Mc-
Gee and Jim Bailey being the only
sure starters at present.. There is a
chance that Roy Tamm's forward
spot may be taken over by Bob
Biles, for Tamm is still favoring a
back injury received last week.
Merv Lafaille, leading Bear scorer,
is having a battle for the other
starting forward spot with Thurston
Davis, who showed up well in the
Cal-Trojan hoop games last week
end.
Price apparently hasn't yet decid
ed on his other starting guard. Bob
Alameida and Irv Hodes are the two
candidates for starting honors.
