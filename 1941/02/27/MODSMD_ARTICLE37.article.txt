# Frosh Hoopmen Prepare for Cal
## 
### 
Coach Becb Lee sent his frosli
hoop charges through another stiff
practice session yesterday in the Pa
vilion in preparation for the resump
tion of the Papoose-California frosh
series to be played Friday and Sat
urday nights.
Friday the Card babes go to Ber
keley and Saturday play here for
the third and final game. Lee's '44
edition won the first encounter
about three weeks ago in an over
time period.
Right now, Bob Wreisner and Dick
McDonough are waging a terrific
battle for the starting spot at. cen
ter, and Dick West and Frank Mc-
Cann are fighting for the other for
ward spot opposite Jim Pollard.
West seems to be the more aggres
sive of the two forwards, while Mc-
Cann is a bit steadier. It's a toss
up as to who will get the call Fri
day. In the pivot spot battle, 'Mc-
Donough and Wriesner are about
the same height and both have had
about the same playing experience.
A mere toss of a coin will decide the
starter here, too.
Cal hasn't been sleeping during
the interim, either, for they drub
bed a couple of high school teams
that are now leading in the San
Francisco prep loop. The two teams
are pretty evenly matched and the
games should be corkers.
