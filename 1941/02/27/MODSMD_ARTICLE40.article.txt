# Stanford, Bronco Nines Open C.I.B.A. Season Saturday
## 
### 
With only two days remaining before the C.1.8.A. opener with Santa
Clara, Stanford's varsity Ryhawks lost their last practice chance as rain
forced cancellation of yesterday's scheduled game with Kenealy's Seals.
Adding to the bad weather situation. Bill Hanlon is limping around
the campus with a stifV knee, sustained when the first string catcher made

a diving slide into second base in,
Tuesday's game wtih San Jose. At
this time it is not known just how
long Hanlon will be out, but his
absence dims the Cards' chances
aplenty against the Broncos Satur
day.
Coach Harry Wolter's ace back
stop drove in three of Stanford's five
runs against the Spartans and hit
.750 for the day's efforts at the plate.
In all probability, rather than take
a chance of reinjuring the knee,
Wolter will keep Hanlon on the
bench Saturday regardless of his
condition. If so, either Herb Atkin
son or Red Fay will start behind the
plate.
SHORT KECAP
A short recap on Tuesday's en
counter: Russ Smith did a beautiful
job on the mound for seven innings,
giving up five well-spread safeties.
Claude Purkitt took his turn in the
last two innings and gave four men
three-and-two counts before get
ting rid of themâ€”three via the
strike-out route.
Starting on first base, Ray Ham
mett turned in a great effort, grab
bing two singles in four trips, and
making a beautiful pick-up of
Monty Pfyl's low throw in the fifth
inning for a double killing.
11-HIT BARRAGE
Cherry Cereghino picked a brace
of singles, Aurelio Caruso and Bob
Ditlevson completing the Indians'
11-hit. barrage with a single apiece.
Saturday's league opener will be
played at the Bronco diamond start
ing at 2:30 o'clock. While Wolter's
aggregation was winning from San
Jose Tuesday, the Broncos bowed
before Kenealy's, 9-4.
