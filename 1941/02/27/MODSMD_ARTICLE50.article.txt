# Honor ... in Fact
## 
### 
ENGLISH corner, the Cellar, the P.O. steps
and The Daily's Campus Opinion files
buzzed today with student comment on Tues
day evening's fact-and-figure discussion of Stan
ford's Honor Code.
Comment was varied. Some was purely per
sonal and some covered the broadest possible
aspects of the situation.
But one unifying thread ran through the hurly
burly of the coke-time conversations; continued
through noon-day bull sessions; and neared
completion in written Campus Opinion letters.
And that unifying thread was a comforting,
warming understanding of the situation.
The thrill of the Honor Code itself, perhaps
lessened in past years by the familiar fact that
it was always there, was rejuvenated in yes
terday's discussions after the famous system
was recalled more forcibly to the public eye
by the Tuesday evening informal bull session.
And in rediscovering the values of this fun
damental student standard, Stanford under
graduates found again the vital necessity of
keeping the Honor Code at its highest levelâ€”
a system in fact, down to the last man or woman.
It takes only one cheater who completes his
education at the Farm unmolested to discredit
every other one of us. The old axiom of the
chain and its weakest link applies here too.
Today The Daily prints one of the many Campus
Opinion letters received. That one was chosen
because it came from one of the 95 per cent to
whom our Honor Code means Stanford. But,
that one in particular was picked because it
also implied a fear that the system would be
injured by any subsequent action.
The result can only be the opposite.
That the system, in so far as it applies to the
individual, has grown steadily through the years
no one can deny. You and I, each in our own
fashion, have made the Honor Code one of our
own fundamentals.
But, sad to say, even at Stanford there are a
few whom the Code does not affect. Shall we
let them alone? Shall we accept them as one
of us?
Or shall we accept our responsibility as a
group?
No one can answer that except you.
