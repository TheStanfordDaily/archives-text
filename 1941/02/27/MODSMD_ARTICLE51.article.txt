SUCH must be the inward theme of a great
many Stanfordites this wet winter quarter.
For twice during the short space of one month
on-campus student dances have sold out. First
it was the Sadie Hawkins affair. Now it's the
Senior Prom, which in tw6 days has sold 500
bids.
If the customers line up in droves as they
did yesterday at the little window at the A.S.S.U.
office, it is just a matter of conjecture as to
whether the last 100 bids will be sold by noon
or by three o'clock today.
But when the Sadie Hawkins Hop sold out
they printed 200 more bids. These were imme
diately snapped up.
The Sadie Hawkins Hop was a howling suc
cess, financially as well as socially. But there
were many people who objected to having
their toes literally trod upon. There just plain
wasn't enough room to maneuver safely about
the dance floor. Luckily the Hop was one of
those dances where a few discomforts do not
matter —the good old jig-time frolic.
The Senior Prom, however, is a different type
of dance; and the Pavilion will hold just so
many people.
It is to be hoped that the Class of '41, merely
to hike their treasury balance for one short
quarter, will not resort to the tactics of printing
another hundred or more bids. —C. B.
