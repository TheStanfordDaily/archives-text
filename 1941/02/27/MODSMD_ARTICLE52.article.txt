HONOR AMONG STUDENTS
Stanford Honor System came into existence in
the earliest days of the University. The relations
between students and faculty had always been most
cordial, and Dr. Jordan's faculty Committee on Student
Affairs (which was appointed the first day Stanford
opened its doors) seldom had to exert strong influence
on undergraduate matters.
It was in 1895 that The Daily Palo Alto, predeces
sor of the present Daily, editorialized, "Faculty sur
veillance cannot be a substitute for student honor. . . .
That control of the matter should be left to student
sentiment is especially desirable, because in that way
only can the unique relation existing here between
faculty and students be preserved."

COMMITTEE of 15 appointed by the President of
the student body brought in a report at the "larg
est meeting of the Associated Students ever held" (De
cember, 1895) extolling the relations between faculty
and students, regretting "our apparent indifference
toward cases of dishonesty in examinations," and prom
ising to "use our public and private influence to pre
vent further violations of good faith among us."
Then a student honor committee of seven was insti
tuted. This probably was the forerunner of the present
Men's Council.
Current plans, then, to revitalize the Honor Code
and make it a system in fact as well as name are not
new wrinkles in the history of undergraduate affairs.

r JpHE important thing about touching anything that
wears the halo of an ideal is that it tends to be
come mortal. If you limit it and place restrictions
upon its functions, you inhibit its purpose and it re
solves into a body of written rules. TTie Honor Code
will obviously never have this fate, because no one
expects to rephrase its fundamental thought—that hon
orable conduct is the spirit of the University.
But even the Honor Code needs an occasional con
sideration by all of us. It does not function alone, by
itself, in a vacuum. Men of honor will not violate it
willfully, but it can suffer at the hands of those who
do not understand it.
The Honor System is the conscience of the Univer
sity; and it must never be permitted to sleep.
