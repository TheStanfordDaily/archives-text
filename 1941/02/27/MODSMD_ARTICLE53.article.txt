THANK YOU, MISS AVERY

'J'HE EDITOR, SIR:
I should like to publicly thank Miss Avery for
her kind suggestions in regard to the senior class pol
icy. As Activity Files Chairman and a potential Phi
Bete, she is in an excellent position to help us with
our class affairs, which she has graciously consented
to do.
I should like to frankly apologize to the senior class
for the manner in which I have misused my office.
And, further, I openly confess my misdeeds.
Betty, I should have known from the start that the
25 men in the Activity File were the men that the
senior class needed to handle their class affairs. Of
course you told me that I did not need to select my
chairmen from the files; but I should have realized
that this is undemocratic.
Dan Hays is my best friend. It is easy to see from
the poor job that he is doing that this was the only
reason for his appointment. Any dance with Kay
Kyser must undoubtedly be a flop. I could have at
least had sense to accept Dan's original refusal of
the job.
As you say, Betty, Dan's lack of foresight in com
ing to you for approval of his committee only one week
before Feb. 7, the tentative Prom date, was inexcus
able. It is incidental that this tentative date was post
poned one month, until March 7, some three weeks
before this time.
Thanks for the tip about Bruce and Ann; they are
my friends, too. I shall keep them off all future com
mittees. I should also like to clear up any misappre
hension that Betty may have in regard to my fra
ternity affiliation. Although none of my fraternity
brothers are on my committee, I really get along with
them very well and, in fact, I even number them
among my best friends.
I should have scolded Dan when he asked several
seniors to sign up in the Files, although you made no
complaint.' We don't need any more men in the Files,
do we Betty? Those 25 stalwart men of the senior
section of the Activity Files can surely handle the en
tire activities of the class for the year.
And so again, Miss Avery, I thank you for your
interest in our class activities. Trusting that you will
continue to advise me on our class policy, I remain,
Art Gore

LEAVE IT ALONE

r EDITOR, SIR:
If I were asked what one feature of Stanford
meant the most to me I would without hesitation reply,
the Honor Code.
My first week here I saw the trust put in the stu
dents, heard professors tell my classmates and me
that tests weren't proctored, saw the importance of
he Honor Code in Roble. It seemed almost unbeliev
able to me. In my high school, as in every other,
cheating was not considered a matter of honor. The
only crime in cheating was in getting caught. I im
mediately vowed inside me that I would uphold to
the Honor Code in spirit as well as name.
One night when Roble got too noisy I walked down
on the Quad and into a room. One or two other stu
dents were there but no supervisor of any kind. Quad
doors are left unlocked for student use—the Honor
Code, you know.
In other schools one often hears of students locked
out who climb in windows with the aid of fellow con
spirators or who otherwise evade the authorities. But
here, as one girl said, "Since no one checks up and
it's a matter of honor, we couldn't do that"—the Honor
Code again.
One day when casually talking I mentioned trans
ferring to another college. "You wouldn't do that.
Why, you'd feel lost there. They have no Honor
Code!" a friend replied.
When I walk down the Quad and thrill to feel
myself a part of Stanford, I thrill as much over the
Honor Code as over anything else. Nothing furthers
democracy and a spirit of fellowship more than to
feel one's self a part of an honorable group of people.
Is all this worth giving up or mutilating because
few people ever turn others in? Personally I never
expect anyone around me to cheat. When I lean over
to ask another student a question during a test I thrill
because no one suspects me of cheating. I, in turn, am
sure my neighbors are honorable. Perhaps that is
why I have never caught anyone. Perhaps because
the cheaters are such a minority, few students come
in contact with them!
For me a large section of my love for Stanford
would be destroyed with the Honor Code, and I be
lieve that I represent a large group of students. Please,
powers that be, think long and hard before taking such
an important step.
One to whom the Honor Code is Stanford.
