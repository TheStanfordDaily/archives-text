# Conrad Story Rates Tops as Movie Thriller
## 
### 
"VICTORY," appearing at the
Stanford Theater.
Frederic March, Betty Field, and
Sir Cedric Hardwicke, with the re
straint that seems to be the hall
mark of convincing horror, got to
gether with the remnants of a Jo
seph Conrad story and produced
one of the top-flight movies of the
season. "Victory" as it came out of
Hollywood, possesses a strangeness,
a little remote, and an impersonality
that draw an audience along in the
smooth flow of a mounting cres
cendo straight to a denouement
which is out and out melodrama,
and seems only a culmination and a
release.
The Conrad story from which the
picture was made is not one of the
best-known ones. Hendrik Heyst
has an island in the East Indies
where he lives with one servant,
and he escapes the world and all its
dishonesty; and he has never loved
a woman nor killed a man.
• Right there the new reticence of
the movie industry stepped in, and
although the trailers and the blurbs
played up the education of Fred
eric March as Heyst, the taste in
direction and preoccupation with a
more subtle problem than mere he
and-she stuff pulled it out of what
could have been a pretty gooey
alone-on -an-island presentation.
March was excellent, and re
frained from being anything more
glamorous than a middle aged man
who had taken it on the chin. Betty
Field turned in a job of acting, and
seemed to make her particular brand
of unreality a perfect complement to
March's.
But it was Hardwicke who stole
the show. As the leader of a horrific
trio of cut-throats in the islands,
Mr. Jones, the gentleman, is per
haps the most thorough, cold, and
unescapable villain that ever ap
peared on the screen. When Sir
Cedric brushes a lock of lank, fair
hair over his forehead and murmurs,
"You see, Mr. Heyst, we are not
tame people," every one in the au
dience knows it more completely
than he knows anything else for
about three hours.
"Victory" is good as an example,
it's strenuous as an entertainment,
and it's certainly worth anyone's
time. —Secrest
