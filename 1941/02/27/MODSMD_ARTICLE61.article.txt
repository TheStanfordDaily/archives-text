# Toll Cut Proposal Meets Opposition
## 
### 
A proposal for a 10-cent toll cut
by Director A. R. O'Brien was given
a cool reception by Golden Gate
Bridge directors yesterday, and in
dications were that it would be
voted down.
Although Mr. O'Brien insisted the
reduction would be beneficial to the
bridge in the long run, Sidney Tay
lor, bridge traffic expert, expressed
fear that the reduction would knock
down the anticipated toll income
from $2,400,000 to $1,900,000.
