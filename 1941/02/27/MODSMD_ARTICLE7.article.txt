# Explosive Fermentation Marks Crawford Cider
## 
### NEWTON WISE 
Bam! An explosive rocked the room at 3 o'clock in the morning and
three Enclnamen rolled out of bed to find their sealed jug of cider a
puddle on the floor mingled with the wire and wax that had seamed it.
The freshmen had learned what seniors know as an old story—the jugs
of G. A. Crawford, campus cider agent, don't stand the pressure of fcr-
A mentation.

Crawford, 78 years old, has made
his living for ten years by selling
sweet cider in Paly and on the
Stanford campus. He owns and cul
tivates 22 acres of apple trees in the
foothills, from which he makes all
his cider. The cider, which contains
no preservative, is never over 16
hours old. Crawford said he gets
about two gallons of cider from
every box of apples.
PERMIT RENEWED
Almon Roth was the first to per
mit Crawford to solicit on the cam
pus and his permit was recently re
newed by Dean J. Hugh Jackson,
then acting comptroller. Fraterni
ties, halls, and other living groups
are patrons of Crawford, although
his price is slightly higher than mar
ket price because of the care he
takes in preparing the cider.
Crawford is a short, red-faced
gentleman. Four years ago he was
hit by a car in Palo Alto, which
broke his arm and leg, and a year
ago he was injured in another acci
dent. He recovered from both acci
dents with no ill effects, and has
continued to deliver cider to the
campus three times weekly despite
the injuries.
TREATED WITH COURTESY'
Crawford was sitting on a bed
resting his feet after climbing four
stories in Encina. He wiped his red
brow with his handkerchief and
emphasized all the time that he
talked that he had "always been
treated with the utmost courtesy on
the Stanford campus."
"How long does it take to make a
gallon of cider, Mr. Crawford?"
"About an hour and a half," he
stated, and said that the night be
fore he had worked from 5 to 12
o'clock to make five gallons of cider.
He went on down the hall to sell
his last jug. Later, he went down
the front, steps, slowly and tired.
There was another explosion that
night—down the hall.

night—down the hall.
Bam! An explosive rocked the room at 3 o'clock in the morning and
three Enclnamen rolled out of bed to find their sealed jug of cider a
puddle on the floor mingled with the wire and wax that had seamed it.
The freshmen had learned what seniors know as an old story—the jugs
of G. A. Crawford, campus cider agent, don't stand the pressure of fcr-
A mentation.

Crawford, 78 years old, has made
his living for ten years by selling
sweet cider in Paly and on the
Stanford campus. He owns and cul
tivates 22 acres of apple trees in the
foothills, from which he makes all
his cider. The cider, which contains
no preservative, is never over 16
hours old. Crawford said he gets
about two gallons of cider from
every box of apples.
PERMIT RENEWED
Almon Roth was the first to per
mit Crawford to solicit on the cam
pus and his permit was recently re
newed by Dean J. Hugh Jackson,
then acting comptroller. Fraterni
ties, halls, and other living groups
are patrons of Crawford, although
his price is slightly higher than mar
ket price because of the care he
takes in preparing the cider.
Crawford is a short, red-faced
gentleman. Four years ago he was
hit by a car in Palo Alto, which
broke his arm and leg, and a year
ago he was injured in another acci
dent. He recovered from both acci
dents with no ill effects, and has
continued to deliver cider to the
campus three times weekly despite
the injuries.
TREATED WITH COURTESY'
Crawford was sitting on a bed
resting his feet after climbing four
stories in Encina. He wiped his red
brow with his handkerchief and
emphasized all the time that he
talked that he had "always been
treated with the utmost courtesy on
the Stanford campus."
"How long does it take to make a
gallon of cider, Mr. Crawford?"
"About an hour and a half," he
stated, and said that the night be
fore he had worked from 5 to 12
o'clock to make five gallons of cider.
He went on down the hall to sell
his last jug. Later, he went down
the front, steps, slowly and tired.
There was another explosion that
night—down the hall.
