over the Far Eastern
situation is growing even more
tense ... if such a thing is possible.
In Vichy, London, Berlin, Moscow,
Washington, and Tokyo lights are
burning late and diplomats are bit
ing their nails.
The Japanese themselves admit
that their position as "mediator"
of the dispute between French
Indo-China and Thailand (Siam)
is a "difficult" one. It is also a
position loaded with dynamite for
most of the important nations in
the world.
If Japan can force a dictated
peace, its position in French Indo-
China will be immeasurably
strengthened. Strong enough in fact
to make a drive on the Dutch East
Indies, and the Malay States, in
cluding Singapore, far more feasible
than it is at present.
** * *
JF THERE is anything the British
do not want at this time it's an
other war on their hands, particu
larly in the Far East. And if there
is anything Berlin wants it is just
that. Berlin, according to the dis
patches, has been "moving heaven
and earth" to get the Japanese to
make their long-presaged "drive to
the South."
Russia, virtually watching the
situation with a microscope, will
probably base its actions in the
Balkan cauldron on what happens
this week-end in Tokyo. If the
Japanese do join the Axis war
effort, Russia's vulnerable back
door will be fairly safe for the
time being. Although in the long
run a Japanese victory would
bring the possibility of another
Russo-Japanese war much closer.
Thus it would be to Russia's ad
vantage to join the British in the
Balkans, and to help as much as
possible in the Far East. On the
other hand, if the Japanese do not
begin their war the Soviet must be
very cagey about getting into any
sort of conflict in the Balkans, be
cause Nipponese soldiers will bt. sit
ting in Manchukuo and other stra
tegic spots with nothing but time
on their hands.

JfOREIGN Minister Matsuoka is
"taking a very firm stand" in the
matter of the settlement, but he ad
mitted that the negotiations have not
reached the ultimatum stage. How
ever, he has told all the delegates
to the conference that he "desires a
solution by this week-end."
Sources "close to the Japanese
Foreign Office"—this is a news
paperman's phrase meaning any
one from the ianitor to the foreign
minister's wife—admit that failure
of the conference would be a
heavy blow to Japan's plans for
"constructing a new order in East
Asia."
Meanwhile in Washington diplo
matic conferences concerning the
situation brought further strength
ening of this country's Pacific out
posts. Secretary of War Stimson
disclosed that three army air corps
units have already been dispatched
to new stations in Alaska, and that
three more units will follow within
the next two months. Two addition
al air corps pursuit groups have
been assigned to the Philippines.

r pHE HOUSE yesterday approved
and sent to the Senate a $1,533,-
000,000 appropriation to bulwark the
nation's domestic and overseas de
fenses, including "passive fortifica

that Congress has made appropria
tions for any type of fortification of
the little atoll situated in the midst
of a group of Japanese mandated
islands.
Japanese Ambassador Kichisaburo
Nomura conferred with Sumner
Welles yesterday. He said it was a
"social call." Observers believe that
Nomura may have discussed Japa
nese protests against reported activi
ties of a "third power" which caused
a breakdown in Japanese efforts to
force peace in the Thailand-Indo-
China territorial dispute. If the
"third power" wasn't the United

a breakdown in Japanese efforts to
force peace in the Thailand-Indo-
China territorial dispute. If the

that their position as "mediator"

Indo-China and Thailand (Siam)
is a "difficult" one. It is also a
position loaded with dynamite for

If Japan can force a dictated
peace, its position in French Indo-
China will be immeasurably
strengthened. Strong enough in fact
to make a drive on the Dutch East

other hand, if the Japanese do not
begin their war the Soviet must be
very cagey about getting into any
sort of conflict in the Balkans, be

JfOREIGN Minister Matsuoka is
"taking a very firm stand" in the
matter of the settlement, but he ad
mitted that the negotiations have not
reached the ultimatum stage. How
ever, he has told all the delegates
to the conference that he "desires a
solution by this week-end."
Sources "close to the Japanese
Foreign Office"—this is a news
paperman's phrase meaning any
one from the ianitor to the foreign
minister's wife—admit that failure
of the conference would be a
heavy blow to Japan's plans for
"constructing a new order in East
Asia."
Meanwhile in Washington diplo
matic conferences concerning the
situation brought further strength
ening of this country's Pacific out
posts. Secretary of War Stimson
disclosed that three army air corps
units have already been dispatched
to new stations in Alaska, and that
three more units will follow within
the next two months. Two addition
al air corps pursuit groups have
been assigned to the Philippines.

r pHE HOUSE yesterday approved
and sent to the Senate a $1,533,-
000,000 appropriation to bulwark the
nation's domestic and overseas de
fenses, including "passive fortifica
tion" of Guam. This is the first time
that Congress has made appropria
tions for any type of fortification of
the little atoll situated in the midst
of a group of Japanese mandated
islands.
Japanese Ambassador Kichisaburo
Nomura conferred with Sumner
Welles yesterday. He said it was a
"social call." Observers believe that
Nomura may have discussed Japa
nese protests against reported activi
ties of a "third power" which caused
a breakdown in Japanese efforts to
force peace in the Thailand-Indo-
China territorial dispute. If the
"third power" wasn't the United
States or Great Britain, who was it?
over the Far Eastern
situation is growing even more
tense ... if such a thing is possible.
In Vichy, London, Berlin, Moscow,
Washington, and Tokyo lights are
burning late and diplomats are bit
ing their nails.
The Japanese themselves admit
that their position as "mediator"
of the dispute between French
Indo-China and Thailand (Siam)
is a "difficult" one. It is also a
position loaded with dynamite for
most of the important nations in
the world.
If Japan can force a dictated
peace, its position in French Indo-
China will be immeasurably
strengthened. Strong enough in fact
to make a drive on the Dutch East
Indies, and the Malay States, in
cluding Singapore, far more feasible
than it is at present.

JF THERE is anything the British
do not want at this time it's an
other war on their hands, particu
larly in the Far East. And if there
is anything Berlin wants it is just
that. Berlin, according to the dis
patches, has been "moving heaven
and earth" to get the Japanese to
make their long-presaged "drive to
the South."
Russia, virtually watching the
situation with a microscope, will
probably base its actions in the
Balkan cauldron on what happens
this week-end in Tokyo. If the
Japanese do join the Axis war
effort, Russia's vulnerable back
door will be fairly safe for the
time being. Although in the long
run a Japanese victory would
bring the possibility of another
Russo-Japanese war much closer.
Thus it would be to Russia's ad
vantage to join the British in the
Balkans, and to help as much as
possible in the Far East. On the
other hand, if the Japanese do not
begin their war the Soviet must be
very cagey about getting into any
sort of conflict in the Balkans, be
cause Nipponese soldiers will bt. sit
ting in Manchukuo and other stra
tegic spots with nothing but time
on their hands.
