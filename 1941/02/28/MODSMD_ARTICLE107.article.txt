# 'Covered-Up' Shoulders Make Spring Evening Fashion News
## Silk Jersey Heads List For Tall, Sleek Figures 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Taking their cue from world events, the designers have gone all-out
nautical and military this season. And the trend, so noticeable in street
clothes, is present in evening attire too.
It's practically impossible to tell dinner dresses from evening dresses,
these days, what with "cover-up" shouldersâ€”also part of the trend. The

major spring material is silk jer-<
sey, the clingy smooth stuff so be
coming to the tall sleek woman,
and sheer death to the little chubby
sort.
If you are in the latter class, the
designers haven't simply left you to
your fate. As an alternative to the
almost de rigeur jersey they offer
the "Juliet" dress which consists of
yards and yards of fluffy marqui
sette and huge bishop sleeves.
Pan - American relations, much
in the headlines at present, have
also received the nod from Car
negie, Valentina, Rosenstein, et al.
And so we have with us yards and
yards of splashing south-of-the
border materials. There is nothing
retiring about them either; "bold"
is the word for this year's prints.
Half of the dresses are "cover-up"
all the way, with the shirt-maker
top taking the lead. However,
some of the couturicrs, sure that
madame desires some sort of physi
cal allure, have gotten around the
swathe-your-shoulders dictum in a
rather novel and certainly startling
fashion.
They put in sleeves all right, the
dresses are not particularly decolle
te, but all the cloth intended to
cover the diaphragm just isn't there.
These gowns are drafty, but ex
tremely becoming in an abandoned
sort of way. Get an all-over tan
before you wear one.
This particular effect is turning
up in the Grecian type gowns and
in the Hindu styles. Gandhi would
die a thousand deaths if he could
see the latter. Attached drapery
wound around the head and neck
lends you an air of mystery, if you
haven't got one of those open, hon
est faces to begin with.
Then there is the bare midriff and
to top it off the skirt turns under at
the bottom, after the fashion of the
pants ladies in harems wear.
Many of the skirts are slim, or
cut so that they nip in at the an
kles. This diamond-shaped silhou
ette is called the "war-drape" be
cause it was popular during World
War I.
One Palo Alio shop has what we
consider the best dress in the mili
taristic mode, because it is not too
extreme. It is white jersey with
epaulettes of braided white cord.
This cord forms a sort of fringe
which serves for sleeves. The gown
has a deep V-neck, a slender bodice
with knotted buttons of the same
braid, and a straight full skirt..
