# Stylists Show Roomy Purses
## 
### 
Pity the under-five-footers this
spring, because Koret—the big name
in purse manufacturers — has de
creed large handbags for spring.
Even purses for campus wear,
which are all in natural saddle
leather, are mammoth. Saddle
leather purses and shoes to match
are big news for spring sports wear
and have the young look that col
legiennes adore. In addition, the
purses are roomy enough for a
small note book, obviating the ne
cessity for a binder on Quad.
Dress purses are supersized navy
calfskin to tally with red, beige,
and yellow. However, sleek calfskin
purses in red blend well with the
new naval styles in navy blue.
New this year are complete cos
tumes in one shade. It has always
been difficult in the past to find
colored leather purses to match out
fits, but no more. The new color
affiliates scheme features purses
from the same dye-pot as the suit
and shoes.
For those conformists who cling
to black purses and white gloves,
black faille is a godsend. A beau
tifully rich fabric, it won't rub off
on your gloves and lends the touch
of elegance that dressy black and
navy blue demand.
This spring shoes and purses to
match are important. They add a
well-turned-out look to any outfit.
Alligator purses and shoes, as al
ways, are good with dressy sports
clothes, but branch out and wear
giddy red or green calfskin pumps
with purse to match. Or if you are
more conservatively inclined, there's
a deep orange-brown, stunning with
natural wools and plaids.
