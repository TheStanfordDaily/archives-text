# Spring Hairstyles Require Neatness
## 
### 
It is easy to know what to do
with your hair for campus wear
even though warm weather brings
down the tops of convertibles and
raises problems of neatness.
We must adopt styles that look
cute even when they have been
blown and that at the same time can
be easily made to look chic and
more formally flattering at night.
To withstand convertibles, hair must
be worn in an informal style, for it
is the formal hairdos that look
downright messy when they are

not kept neat as a pin.
Brush your hair often and briskly.
Don't have a lot of curls that fall
apart at the first sign of weather.
And above all, don't change your
hair radically every day or so.
Make changes in which the hair
lies along similar lines. Don't change
the direction of your hair.
Pompadours are ideal for change
able modes in hairstyles. If you
can wear them, you're lucky, for
with a pompadour to take care of
the hair on top of your head you
haven't much to worry about but
the lower curls. This style is es
pecially advisable as most of the

spring hats are made to sit behind
a shock of hair.
Don't take trends in hair styles
too seriously. Just because a coif
fure may appear in Hai*pcr's Bazaar
or Vogue doesn't mean that it will
look good on you or even appro
priate on anyone. It is said that hair
is going up again but regardless of
the fact wear your hair in the most
becoming fashion no matter how
simple that way may be.
Grass green shorts and a long
sleeved white blouse are highly rec
ommended by Harper's Bazaar to set
off a tan.
