# '41 To Feature Feminine Lines
## 
### 
The silhouette fox- spring, 1941,
is definitely on the feminine side.
Newest of the trends is the drop
shoulder, created by fashion de
signers who evidently felt that there
were enough military shoulders in
the world. The shoulder seams ap
pear to slide down over the arm, and
the sleeve is set low, giving a smooth
curved line rather than a square
one.
The low descending waistline will
also be very popular. For the slen
der woman, fashion decrees one or
two peplunis and tiers. Two pep
lums will be seen on %iany of the
new jackets. For the woman of
more ample proportions, side dra
pery on skirts carries out the low
waistline idea. Skirts will be slim
and quite straight.
Capes, always exciting and dra
matic for evening wear, are back
this spring for daytime dress. A
hem-length cape with smooth, flow
ing lines is flattering to almost any
figure, but long capes demand height
and slimness.
An interesting innovation in lines
is the introduction of the symmetry
of Chinese clothes into American
fashion. Note the loose swinging
coolie jackets, side-fastened neck
lines, and kimono sleeves.
