# Full-Sleeved Blouse Carries Into Spring
## 
### 
Long-sleeved white silk shirts that
became almost a campus uniform
this fall and winter are going to be
just as important in the spring fash
ion scene.
Worn with huge, swirling skirts in
brightly patterned wash silks and
cottons, thin silk blouses look crisp
and cool. The idea of long sleeves
for warm weather, which made a
tentative appearance last year, has
finally won over the campus. This
style is amazingly effective with the
new, longer shorts, too.
Frothy sheer blouses with jabots
are making a comeback with this
spring's vogue for "dandy" suits. A
new touch is ruffles around the cuffs
4o show beneath bracelet length, or
slit suit sleeves.
