# Quad Clothes To be Gaudy
## 
### 
With warm weather coming in at I
more and more frequent intervals
the Quad is about to emerge from
the drab uniformity of rain para- j
phcrnalia into the bright and daring j
shades that will predominate this
spring. A surprise was the way the j
rubber boot craze took the campus j
by storm this winter, and it will be i
interesting to note whether, despite'
tradition, the rumored hobby sock
innovation on the Quad will be
given popular a reception during |
the next few months.
From the new cocoanut bonnet
hats down to the blond saddle-calf
"chappies," beige will be the basic
color at least for the early spring.
Matching, small zipper bags and
studded belts will carry out the
saddle leather note.
The year-round necessity of skirt
and sweater combination will head
line the crazy, pastel, plaid skirts,
with the new flared cut, and worn
with sweaters (sleeves pushed up
again) to carry out any one of the
colors in the design. Matching plaid
jackets and plain pastel skirts or a
! reversal of the combination worn i
! with soft sweaters will combine
I into a wardrobe of several smart
I md informal suits for either on the
Quad or on informal dates. A "spe
cial" will be the natural covert
| cloth three-piece suit worn with
French tailored blouses in crisp
\ white.
For something new but definitely
a "must" is the navy skirt worn
with long-sleeved blouses in green,
red, yellow, and blue stripes. Along
with the navy trend are the stand
! ird sailor blouses, dresses, and
! white dresses with a sailor collar
and navy touches. To those who
I prefer the plainer and sometimes
more flattering skirts, they may be
! had in beige, pink, and powder blue
! and will be worn with white blouses
| and jerkins either matching or con
j trasting with the skirts.
As the weather gets warmer wash
dresses will gradually come into the
j majority. The dirndl skirt will ex
j perience a revival, but the perennial
! tailored cotton and rayon favorites
j will hold their own.
A blue and white bistro check,
, just like the tablecloth in your fa
| vorite North Beach restaurant, is the
] material used to fashion a peasant
i dress.

innovation on the Quad will be
given popular a reception during |
the next few months.
From the new cocoanut bonnet
hats down to the blond saddle-calf
"chappies," beige will be the basic
color at least for the early spring.
Matching, small zipper bags and
studded belts will carry out the
saddle leather note.
The year-round necessity of skirt
and sweater combination will head
line the crazy, pastel, plaid skirts,
with the new flared cut, and worn
with sweaters (sleeves pushed up
again) to carry out any one of the
colors in the design. Matching plaid
jackets and plain pastel skirts or a
! reversal of the combination worn i
! with soft sweaters will combine
I into a wardrobe of several smart
I md informal suits for either on the
Quad or on informal dates. A "spe
cial" will be the natural covert
| cloth three-piece suit worn with
French tailored blouses in crisp
\ white.
For something new but definitely
a "must" is the navy skirt worn
with long-sleeved blouses in green,
red, yellow, and blue stripes. Along
with the navy trend are the stand
! ird sailor blouses, dresses, and
! white dresses with a sailor collar
and navy touches. To those who
I prefer the plainer and sometimes
more flattering skirts, they may be
! had in beige, pink, and powder blue
! and will be worn with white blouses
| and jerkins either matching or con
j trasting with the skirts.
As the weather gets warmer wash
dresses will gradually come into the
j majority. The dirndl skirt will ex
j perience a revival, but the perennial
! tailored cotton and rayon favorites
j will hold their own.
A blue and white bistro check,
, just like the tablecloth in your fa
| vorite North Beach restaurant, is the
] material used to fashion a peasant
i dress.
With warm weather coming in at I
more and more frequent intervals
the Quad is about to emerge from
the drab uniformity of rain para- j
phcrnalia into the bright and daring j
shades that will predominate this
spring. A surprise was the way the j
rubber boot craze took the campus j
by storm this winter, and it will be i
interesting to note whether, despite'
tradition, the rumored hobby sock
innovation on the Quad will be
given popular a reception during |
the next few months.
