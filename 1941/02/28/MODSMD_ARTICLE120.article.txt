# Tea-goers to Step Out in Splashy Prints
## 
### 
Dresses for tea-time and dancing
will feature crepes, rayons, and
acetates in splashy prints, and fig
ures carrying out the bright color
trend of the corning spring season.
The standard navy will return to be
especially good with navy and white
check trim and matched petticoats
worn an inch below the dress.
White lingerie and petit point
touches on navy dresses are coming
in with unusual popularity. The
puritan influence is strong and is
found in a pique collar with Irish

crocheted lace worn with dark
rayon.
The military cut and accessories
in red, white and blue will carry
through spring and into summer.
Skirts will be full in front and
back, but not on the sides. Last
year's boleros will give way a little
to the fitted coat or redingote en
sembles to be worn over date
dresses.

feminine," in spring of '37. |
