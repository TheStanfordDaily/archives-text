# Hats Show Wide Brims; All Fabrics
## Extreme Turbans, Off-Face Influence, Reverse Brims Good 
### PAT SMITH 
What's the word about hats? Well,
we know that the Stanford woman
seldom wears one, hut there's noth
ing to dress her up more quickly
when the occasion does come along.
Fashion is being broad-minded
about hats again this spring. Al
most anything gets by as Jong as
it's either ultra-becoming or too un
usual to be ignored.
The really important trends you'll
be hearing about:
1. Wider brims on at least half
your hats, with <i few really tre
mendous ones for glamour girls.
2. Lots of turbans of ribbon, felt,
crepe, and most anything else.
Even one stran ;e concoction that
is a flat straw hat sewed atop a com
plete turban.
3. A great many hats, especially
sailors and bretons, are tipping for
ward on the head again.
4. Tne pure-browed influenceâ€”
quite a group of off-the-face and
reverse brim creations that show
plenty of forehead and hairline.
PILLBOXES RETURN
5. Just as many delightful pill
boxes as ever. They're always
youthful, comfortable, adaptable,
and flattering.
ti. For spring, no end of flowers
and birds and loads of very pale
pastel straws and felts.
Now for a little more detail.
BRIMS CHANGE CASUALS
The college girl, and sportswomen
in general, still have all the casual
felts they want. The brims tend to
be wider than last year, and they
tip farther forward on the head.
Brown, grey, green, white, and
plenty of pastels are available.
Straw sailors are very much the
thing. Most of them sit nretty
straight on the head, and the brims
ranee in width from about iwo
inches on out. Lots of Panamas, of
course, some with large, soft brims
and a good many very off-the-face.
PICTURESQUE TREND
Dressy straws vary a lot. Off-the
face, pompadour sailors, a huge
white Indian straw with a V cut out
of the back for convenience in mov
ing the head, Gibson Girl designs,
and the usual spring rash of flower
bouquets. One of the trickiest jobs
is a "glider hat" that looks as though
the wearer could take off on a mo
ment's notice. All the spring colors,
plus navy, black, and natural, are
being seen.
Dressy felts are all pastels with
much wider brims. They're trimmed
with drapes of silk jersey, flowers,
birds, feather butterflies, veils, and
what-have-you. One of the nicest
is a pagoda hat of white felt that
reflects ever-so-faintly that Orien
tal influence.
