# Harmonizing Gloves Complete Costumes
## 
### 
Although it is rather ironic to
speak of gloves in a "farmland"
where handcoverings are shame
fully neglected, spring gloves do
play an important part in com
pleting a costume.
'"Vogue"' is now featuring the new
"one color" outfits in bright colors.
Everything matches. If you choose
a "one color" outfit, by all means
buy and wear, not carry, matching
gloves. Wrist length gloves that
tuck under the sleeve of your jacket
or coat complete the matching
scheme.
For dress-up, with your navy and
white sheer, the traditional white
midway - between - the - wrist -
ana-elbow gloves definitely com
plete the "dressy" look.
