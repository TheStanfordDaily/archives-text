# Corduroy Scheduled For Increased Wear
## 
### 
Corduroy is still wish us for j
spring. Coats, suits, slacks, play |
clothes, arid sport dresses are in new
light weight materials in enchant
ing colors, adopted from the sunny
Bahamas, the palomino pony, and
the hue of champagne.
Destined to be especially popu
lar for spectator sports and infor
mal afternoon tete-a-tetes is the
liÂ«iht weight corduroy coat in
"honey chile," the latest in browns, j
It has a sloping sleeve with padded
shoulder. Box pleats in both the
front and belted back give exactly
the right degree of freedom to the
arms.
An interesting detail of this new
corduroy is the wide ribbing which
gives an effect of bulkiness without '
the actual incumbrance of weight.
It will also be worn in palomino
beige, v/hich promises to be the |
first choice for all-around wear,
and Bahama blue, adopted from the
color of the sea around these is
lands.
