LUCY THOMAS, ROBLE, is seen at left coming from the yarn craft shop
at Allied Arts wearing a Roos Bros, powder blue polka-dotted sports dress

with a soft wool jacket of matching color. Frances Harvey, Tri-Delt, at
left comes down the stairs in a beige suit with white pique collar and cuffs


from the Clothes Closet. The suit looks equally well with a blouse.
