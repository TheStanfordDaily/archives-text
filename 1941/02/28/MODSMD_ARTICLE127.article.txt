# KNITTED CLOTHES REVIVED
## 
### 
Knitted fashions are once again
returning to popularity, with women
taking time off from their Red
Cross socks and sweaters for sol
diers to do a little handiwork for
themselves. Sweaters are being
made to look like Braemers and
other imported brands, and even
whole knitted suits are being shown.
