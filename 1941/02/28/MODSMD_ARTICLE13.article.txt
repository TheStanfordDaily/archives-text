# Champion Card Five Threaten 21 – Year – Old Bear Series Stalemate
## Indian Cagers End Regular Season With Traditional Big Game Clashes; Bears Seek Second Spot in League 
### DON SELBY 
With the Pacific Coast Conference play-off situation definitely settled,
Stanford's clever hoop team will settle down to a little serious basketball
this week-end in an attempt to score the first Big Game hoop series clean
sweep in 21 years.
The Indians travel across the bay tonight to take on the second-place
Bears in California's men's gymnasium, while the scene of conflict switches

to the Farm tomorrow night with
the two teams clashing in the Pa
vilion at 8:15 o'clock.
Although they have nothing to
fear from the Bears as far as con
ference standings are concerned, the
Cards will still have the pressure on
them when they tangle with the
raging Bears tonight, because, for
the first time in several years, Stan
ford has a very good chance of
making a clean sweep of the Cal
series. If they win tonight, the In
dians will be driving for that 21-
year-old record in no uncertain
manner, while a loss tonight would
force them to fight tomorrow night
to keep from letting Cal get a split
in the series.
BFAR ADVANTAGE
Psychologically, the Bears have
all the advantages, for they are ex
pected to lose and most anything
that they do will be considered okay.
But it won't be surprising to find
Coach Nibs Price's hoopsters press
ing just a little, for a pair of vic
tories over Stanford would assure
them of second spot in the Southern
Division no matter what U.S.C. does
to U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles' big
game. Those Bears would hate to
have the Trojans ace them out of
that runner-up position.
Whether or not the Indians play
this week - end's ball games for
keeps depends on their attitude. If
they want to let up, they can. No
one is going to criticize them if they
drop one of these last two games,
for the Southern Division crown is
what counts—and Stanford already
has that in the bag.
GUN FOR CLEAN SWEEP
However, it doesn't seem as if the
Stanford quintet that we have been
watching all season likes to play
that kind of ball. The chances are
that they'll be gunning for that clean
sweep in the Big Game series, but
they'll still have that let-down to
guard against.
Everett Dean, Stanford cage men
tor, could settle the whole problem
by playing his second outfit in prep
aration for next season, but, accord
ing to present plans, it will be the
regular starting five that will open
against the Bears. All of which
should lead to the conclusion that
the whole Stanford basketball con
tingent, from Dean down to the last
sub, is out to make history by
sweeping the Cal series. Then, too,
Stanford hasn't even copped the
series yet.
GAME STYLES DIFFER
There is another thing that the
Indians will be seeking tonight and
tomorrow night: the conference's in
dividual scoring crown for Don Bur
ness. The tall Indian pivot man,
who is probably the most effortless
eager in the league, is now out in
front of Jackie Robinson of U.C.LA.
in the scoring race by a mere 3-point
margin.
The dusky Bruin flash might easily
run up an imposing point total
against the Ti-ojans this week-end.
He has done it before. If the en
tire Stanford quintet is on its game,
the chances are good that Burness
will do a considerable bit of scoring
himself. But a lot of his scoring

(Continued on page 5)
With the Pacific Coast Conference play-off situation definitely settled,
Stanford's clever hoop team will settle down to a little serious basketball
this week-end in an attempt to score the first Big Game hoop series clean
sweep in 21 years.
The Indians travel across the bay tonight to take on the second-place
Bears in California's men's gymnasium, while the scene of conflict switches

to the Farm tomorrow night with
the two teams clashing in the Pa
vilion at 8:15 o'clock.
Although they have nothing to
fear from the Bears as far as con
ference standings are concerned, the
Cards will still have the pressure on
them when they tangle with the
raging Bears tonight, because, for
the first time in several years, Stan
ford has a very good chance of
making a clean sweep of the Cal
series. If they win tonight, the In
dians will be driving for that 21-
year-old record in no uncertain
manner, while a loss tonight would
force them to fight tomorrow night
to keep from letting Cal get a split
in the series.
BFAR ADVANTAGE
Psychologically, the Bears have
all the advantages, for they are ex
pected to lose and most anything
that they do will be considered okay.
But it won't be surprising to find
Coach Nibs Price's hoopsters press
ing just a little, for a pair of vic
tories over Stanford would assure
them of second spot in the Southern
Division no matter what U.S.C. does
to U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles' big
game. Those Bears would hate to
have the Trojans ace them out of
that runner-up position.
Whether or not the Indians play
this week - end's ball games for
keeps depends on their attitude. If
they want to let up, they can. No
one is going to criticize them if they
drop one of these last two games,
for the Southern Division crown is
what counts—and Stanford already
has that in the bag.
GUN FOR CLEAN SWEEP
However, it doesn't seem as if the
Stanford quintet that we have been
watching all season likes to play
that kind of ball. The chances are
that they'll be gunning for that clean
sweep in the Big Game series, but
they'll still have that let-down to
guard against.
Everett Dean, Stanford cage men
tor, could settle the whole problem
by playing his second outfit in prep
aration for next season, but, accord
ing to present plans, it will be the
regular starting five that will open
against the Bears. All of which
should lead to the conclusion that
the whole Stanford basketball con
tingent, from Dean down to the last
sub, is out to make history by
sweeping the Cal series. Then, too,
Stanford hasn't even copped the
series yet.
GAME STYLES DIFFER
There is another thing that the
Indians will be seeking tonight and
tomorrow night: the conference's in
dividual scoring crown for Don Bur
ness. The tall Indian pivot man,
who is probably the most effortless
eager in the league, is now out in
front of Jackie Robinson of U.C.LA.

margin.
The dusky Bruin flash might easily
run up an imposing point total
against the Ti-ojans this week-end.
He has done it before. If the en

will do a considerable bit of scoring
