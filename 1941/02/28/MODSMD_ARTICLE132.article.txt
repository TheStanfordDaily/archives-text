# Light-Weight Woolens Lead Spring Fabrics
## Prints to Take Over Role of 'Good Black' Dress for Dancing 
### 
One of the host ways to make
your clothes look like you—and no
one else—is to make them, or have
your dressmaker make them, says
a leading fashion magazine. Ergo,
the importance of materials in the
spring fashion picture.
L.kn plaid suits are news this
spring because they are appearing
in pastel plaids. Blue, pink, and
brown plaids rival mixtures of
green, yellow, and brown and other
soft colorings.
Anproximating the popularity of
plaids in the spring skirt and suit
scene are the solid color pastels and
neutral shades in Botany woollens,
flannels, camel's-hair, alpaca, and
cashmere.
PRINTS APPEAR
Traditionally the coming of spring
can be forecast any Friday or Sat
urday night on the dance floors of
any of the city hotels. The "good
blacks" no longer monopolize the
floor; they are supplanted by flow
ered silk prints.
mis year prints concentrate on
flattery. Angelic cherubs, uncon
ventional fruit and flower designs,
and fragile lace and scroll prints are
among the cleverest of new de
signs.
MILITARISM AGAIN
Navy blue—naturally—is not a
material, but it might as well be
this spring, for it appears in all
fabrics. Always a strong "avorite
with fresh and frilly white, the new
militaristic and navy-inspired styles
have caused it to shoot to first place
in the material picture.
Fabrics this year are American
designed, original and serviceable.
