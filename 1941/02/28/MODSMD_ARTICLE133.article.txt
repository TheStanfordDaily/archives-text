# PEARLS IN NEW DESIGNS
## 
### 
Â£ brands of pearls, long considered
I the best means of '"lightening that
! little black dress," have been rede
signed this year to include great
ropes of the twisted beads, normal
or tinted. The greatest innovations
are the long, ungraduated strings,
and the small, delicate little strands
| which look like graduation-from
high-school gifts, and can be worn
in the evening with demure formals.
Dolls and watches were worn as
hair ornaments in the spring oi'
1 1937.
