# Tailored Washables Lead in Popularity With Farm Women
## Cottons Bow In Glorified Quad Styles 
### ROSE DOUGLASS 
The backbone of any lifc-in-the
suii wardrobe is the cotton wash
dress. No sooner have rubber boots
and bucket hats been permanently
consigned to the darkest corner of
the closet, than the fashion-con
scious college woman starts casting
about for clothes to blend in with
the spring scene.
In campus clothes tailored wash
ables are the solution; they take
over and provide practical outfits
for school, when the faithful old
sweater and skirt are tucked away
in moth balls.
But just because cottons are prac
tical and comfortable does not mean
that they can't be attractive. Very
much to the contrary—designers and
manufacturers have bent their best
efforts to glorifying the great Amer
can fabric, with the result that cot
tons now loom large on the fashion
scene.
SHANTUNG TAKES LEAI)
Here are a few examples of what
they have to offer to Farmerettes in
the sun, this season.
Shantung is the big news in sports
dresses: it tailox-s; it washes; it
drapes. You'll find it used to make
your favorite classic shirtmaker—
fly front, action sleeves, pleated
skirt, with saddle stitching trim, or
leather buttons and belt—or to fash
ion less severe afternoon dresses.
For strictly sports, natural shan
tung heads the list, being particu
larly effective to set off that first
hint sf sun-tan. But if you're not
the outdoor type you'll find it in the
complete range of delicious pastel
shades. And for something really
striking, dead black shantung is the
ultimate.
STANDBYS STILL GOOD
Chambray is destined to go on
and on; it proved itself last year,
and now holds a secure position in
the cotton kingdom. Its casual crisp
ness lends itself to any* degi'ee of
tailoring. You'll find it in dirndls,
shirtmakers, pinafores, and sailor
dresses: striped, polka-dotted, or
plain, and in every conceivable pas
tel tint.
Then there are the other stand
bys which are welcomed back year
after year—pique, gingham, broad
cloth, poplin, linens, washable ray
ons, and an array of novelty weaves.
The shirtmaker as usual monopo
lizes the scene, but though a veteran
of many seasons, always contrives
to look new and refreshing. This
classic! gracefully lends itself to
endless variations.
