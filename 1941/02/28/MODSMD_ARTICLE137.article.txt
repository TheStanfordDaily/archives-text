# SPORT TURBANS DRAPED
## 
### 
Turbans for sport wear are draped
in a new style this spring. This ar
ticle of head-weai', whicji is a
good substitute for a hat, sells in a
long looped band which winds
around in a stunning manner. The
turban ties at the right of the face
and loops of yarn fall on the side
in a striking way. It does not neces
sarily have to be draped but can
be designed in the usual turban
style.
