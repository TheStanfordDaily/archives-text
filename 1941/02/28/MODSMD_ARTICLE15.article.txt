Hoping to lead a few marginal
students on the 4-H Club path,
The Daily printed the other day a
few terse comments on Dick Stepp's
way of life. The Daily reporter ex
tolled the student manager for his
habit of leaving his 1940 Buick
parked in Palo Alto at the depot and
walking out to Stanford.
Huzzah, huzzah for Stepp.
That's why he's healthy.
That's why he's student manager.
If you sluggards would so much
as set your saddle shoes up and
down a dozen consecutive times,
your lives would be a little better.
But no, you'll never be like Stepp,
full of health, resistance.
Miss Aten, A.S.S.U. secretary,
phoned yesterday.
"Just thought you might like to
know. Stepp was taken to the hos
pital this morning. Measles."
