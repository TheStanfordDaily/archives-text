# Last Prom Bid Sold Yesterday
## Seniors to Increase Decorations Budget 
### 
The last bid for the Senior Prom
was sold at 10 o'clock yesterday
morning, according to Dan Hays,
dance chairman.
With 65 names on the waiting list
for names, Art Gore last night de
clared that "absolutely no more
tickets will be sold."
"Six hundred were printed and
they were gone in two and a half
days. We feel the Pavilion cannot
comfortably accommodate more
than this number and we have no
intention of packing the hall," Gore
said.
When the A.S.S.U. office opened
yesterday morning, 15 people were
waiting in line, secretaries in the
office said. The last ticket was
passed out about 10 o'clock and de
mand for the ducats did not lessen
all day, it was learned.
Last night Hays announced that
"the sale exceeded any of our hopes
and we intend to transfer the great
est part of the profit which would
normally have come to the class of
'41 into refreshments and decora
tions." He said that the decorations
budget had been increased by about
$100. "Our wish is to present one
of the finest dances that the Farm
has seen for a long time," he added.
