And then there are those times in bull sessions when you reach the
point of philosophy, and you have to decide who influences who most:
women or fashion—whether fashion is at the mercy of women or women
are at the mercy of fashion.
And, of course, if you believe the last, you know nothing about the his
tory of Stanford, absolutely noth-*

ing. Why, women have been wear
ing stockings on the Quad since 50
years ago, and the words "simplicity
and cleanliness" have been the mot
to of three generations of Stanford
women.
Yes, for 50 years women have been
wearing stockings on the Quad; for
50 years they have suffered the tor
tures of the damned when after a
h ivy rainstorm their wet stockings
c .twled around their legs. Back in
tit * days.of Aunt Hester the stock
ings were substantial parts of the
female wardrobe.

Hosiery was of the heavy knit va
rit »y, built to last. Some was gay
with stripes, some colored tops, and
nearly all had fancy clocks down
the side. Then when the boom
years came, bare legs were the
1; shion; but Stanford women could
n't be bare-legged on the Quad, so
tlii y bought seamless silk stockings
to fool the unknowing. Now Nylon
enters the picture.
Hair may be described in three
easy notions. First it was long,
drawn back from the face, and
dangling on the neck in a knot; then
it was short, and scraped the eye
lids in front. Now, anything goes.

Evening dresses have also had
tips and downs. In the early days of
the University, women were coy and
modest, intent upon getting an edu
cation. Their evening dresses rus
tled on the floor, and were encir
cled at the waist by satin ribbons.
Then skirts matched the climb of the
stock market, dipped as frequently
as each financial gyration, and final
ly came down with a crash in the
depression, where they've been ever
since.
Fashion says that this spring the
military influence will appear in all
the clothes we wear. Stanford girls
have been military minded for
years—not just because the trimness
of a uniform appeals to them, but
because sailor collars, braid, and
gold buttons are a Farm custom from
the turn of the century. Fifty years
r 1 Stanford sees us wearing modified
versions of sailor hats and dresses
that the earliest coeds also found be
coming.
That's why, if you ask a coed who
knows her Stanford, she'll say, "It's
f;ishion which is at the mercy of
women."
