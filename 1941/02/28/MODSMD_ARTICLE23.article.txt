# Boathouse Sojourns Demand Suntan Oil
## 
### 
"Mere comes the sun . . ."
Yeah. Here it comes. And for
some 'twill mean a tan For others
. . . oh, ouch!
In a few weeks, now, the coeds
will don their sun and bathing suits
and the boathouse and/or sundeck
hiatus will commence. With them,
Farm women will carry towels,
cards, sun glasses, the required
reading in innumerable courses,
cork slippers, klecnex, lipstick, pow
der, mascara, eyelash curlers, and
other absolutely necessary articles.
The smart ones will have some kind
of sun oil along; at least for the first
few cookings.
