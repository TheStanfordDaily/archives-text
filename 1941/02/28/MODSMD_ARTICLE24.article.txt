# Women Create The Darnedest Combinations!
## 'Popoff' Expresses Views on Feminine Get-ups for Campus 
### LITTLE POPOFF 
So you want to know what I don't
like ahout women's clothes. Well,
you get used to almost everything
but some of their get-ups are awful!
Take what they wear in the rain,
for instance. Those reversible coats
that always look* like the lining's
hanging out. And those big black
boots. I like to see their legs. I
figure if their pins were presentable
they wouldn't be hiding them.
And while we're on legs, let's
get down to stockings. Why don't
women bother to straighten their
stocking seams, and why don't they
hide what's holding up their stock
ings?
I hate fancy shoes. Those wedge
things for instance; and moccasins,
and those men's shoes. I like sad
dle shoes on campus. And while
they're on campus, why don't the
gals wear more sweaters? I LOVE
sweaters.
lIAIII BAFFLES
What baffles me, though, is what
women can do with their hair. There
are two things that I definitely
blacklist—Herjy Lamarr style on
Quad and hair worn off the konk!
They're OUT.
You know the other day a girl
came into my history class carrying
one of those useless valises that
they call purses. When she opened
the thing it was a revelation. She
could have gone camping with what
she had in there. And even so the
thing wasn't half full. Why does
anyone want to carry around so
much stuff?
NO SHORT SKIRTS
But her purse wasn't the half of it.
When she walked out after class I
noticed her skirt. It was one of those
tight jobs and looked like it shrank
at the last cleaning. And (hat's not
all. It came up above her knees.
Do I like hats? No, of course not.
Especially those extreme things and
the ones with long, long feathers,
just long enough to get in your eye
across the table when she looks
down at her soup. And I don't like
veils, they're always gettin' in the
way.
AGAIN STRAPLESS FORMALS
Now about evening dresses.
There's no excuse for hoods on
formals. The things are never up
anyway and even when they are,
they don't look very attractive.
I like formals to be pretty sub
stantial. None of those photograph
jobs. You know, overexposed. But
anything rather than the strapless
kind. They scare me. No kidding,
when a gal comes down in one of
those I have to run to a bar to get
up courage enough to dance with
the gal. Why, just think what would
happen if you stepped on the hem.
Say, how do they keep those up
anyway?

she had in there. And even so the
thing wasn't half full. Why does
anyone want to carry around so
much stuff?
NO SHORT SKIRTS
But her purse wasn't the half of it.
When she walked out after class I
noticed her skirt. It was one of those
tight jobs and looked like it shrank
at the last cleaning. And (hat's not
all. It came up above her knees.
Do I like hats? No, of course not.
Especially those extreme things and
the ones with long, long feathers,
just long enough to get in your eye
across the table when she looks
down at her soup. And I don't like
veils, they're always gettin' in the
way.
AGAIN STRAPLESS FORMALS
Now about evening dresses.
There's no excuse for hoods on
formals. The things are never up
anyway and even when they are,
they don't look very attractive.
I like formals to be pretty sub
stantial. None of those photograph
jobs. You know, overexposed. But
anything rather than the strapless
kind. They scare me. No kidding,
when a gal comes down in one of
those I have to run to a bar to get
up courage enough to dance with
the gal. Why, just think what would
happen if you stepped on the hem.
Say, how do they keep those up
anyway?
So you want to know what I don't
like ahout women's clothes. Well,
you get used to almost everything
but some of their get-ups are awful!
Take what they wear in the rain,
for instance. Those reversible coats
that always look* like the lining's
hanging out. And those big black
boots. I like to see their legs. I
figure if their pins were presentable
they wouldn't be hiding them.
And while we're on legs, let's
get down to stockings. Why don't
women bother to straighten their
stocking seams, and why don't they
hide what's holding up their stock
ings?
I hate fancy shoes. Those wedge
things for instance; and moccasins,
and those men's shoes. I like sad
dle shoes on campus. And while
they're on campus, why don't the
gals wear more sweaters? I LOVE
sweaters.
lIAIII BAFFLES
What baffles me, though, is what
women can do with their hair. There
are two things that I definitely
blacklist—Herjy Lamarr style on
Quad and hair worn off the konk!
They're OUT.
You know the other day a girl
came into my history class carrying
one of those useless valises that
they call purses. When she opened
the thing it was a revelation. She
could have gone camping with what
she had in there. And even so the
thing wasn't half full. Why does
anyone want to carry around so
much stuff?
