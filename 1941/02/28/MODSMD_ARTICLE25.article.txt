# Make-up Goes Pan-American
## 
### 
Make-up, like fashions, is follow
ing the front pages this spring. Clear,
bright retls are being featured with
military styles, and brown-reds
with the new South American
shades.
One of the most effective make
ups to wear with navy blue, red, and
white is "Drum Major," a set that
is packaged in a blue and gold
French soldier's hat, with a red
cockade.
Authorities on cosmetics decree
that a light, clear powder and very
little rouge should be worn with
brilliant reds.
On the "south of the border"
tront, deep, rich-toned powders,
and brick red lipstick and rouge
lead the parade. They're particu
larly good when you have a slight
tan to back them up.
The outstanding difference be
tween this spring's rust shades and
the ones that have periodically made
fashion news before is that there is
nothing orange about this year's
colors. Chilibean and Tamale Red
are the favorites in the fast-growing
list of reds with a brown under
tone.
Women who make their own
clothes can easily have a hat to
match each costume if they stick to
the turban style. A clever seam
sress can manufacture a turban out
of most anything from velvet and
jersey to knitting yarn for sports
wear.
