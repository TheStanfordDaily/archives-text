# Fitted Arches Lend Elegance To Dressy Shoes For Spring
## 
### 
Stanford's feminine feet will be
extra trim (his spring for shopping
tours or dancing in the City. That
slender, neat line is emphasized in
all the new dress shoes.
Pumps, well-fitted through the
arch, give the desired slim effect of
elegance with dressiness. Shoe ma
terials have been cut to fit like a
glove. Gabardine, always popular
in spring, is being shown more than
ever this year in an elasticized form
which slenderizes the foot.
Open toes are definitely fashion
able. Ninety per cent of all the
dress shoes made this spring have
them. But very few shoes will have
open heels.
PATENT LEATHER OUT
Gabardine and calf lead in shoe
materials. Very little patent leather
is being shown, and this mostly in
trimming.
By the way, bows are practically
the only kind of trimming on dress
shoes. These range from dainty pat
ent bows on gabardine pumps to
large square ones on dressy call
walking shoes.
Many of the walking shoes sport
square heels and toes. Medium
graceful heels are shown for walk
ing and high slender heels for femi
nine-looking dress shoes.
Brown, which goes so well with
again-popular beige, has taken its
place with blue and black as a lead
ing color for dress shoes. Along

I with chocolate and earth brown,
many new shades have come to the
fore. These include natural calf,
known as saddle tan, and a new
British tan, redder than last year's,
which is supposedly the color of
aged saddle leather.
British tan is used beautifully in
medium-heeled walking shoes with
square toes and square bows. These
shoes might be worn with any color
ensemble — beige, blue, black, or
pastel blue or green.
The naval influence is affecting
shoes just as it is affecting all spring
fashions. Dark blue calf pumps
sport tongues simulating sailor col
lars. Gold and silver st;;rs gleam
from the toes of many new pumps.

which slenderizes the foot.
Open toes are definitely fashion
able. Ninety per cent of all the
dress shoes made this spring have
them. But very few shoes will have
open heels.
PATENT LEATHER OUT
Gabardine and calf lead in shoe
materials. Very little patent leather
is being shown, and this mostly in
trimming.
By the way, bows are practically
the only kind of trimming on dress
shoes. These range from dainty pat
ent bows on gabardine pumps to
large square ones on dressy call
walking shoes.
Many of the walking shoes sport
square heels and toes. Medium
graceful heels are shown for walk
ing and high slender heels for femi
nine-looking dress shoes.
Brown, which goes so well with
again-popular beige, has taken its
place with blue and black as a lead
ing color for dress shoes. Along

I with chocolate and earth brown,
many new shades have come to the
fore. These include natural calf,
known as saddle tan, and a new
British tan, redder than last year's,
which is supposedly the color of
aged saddle leather.
British tan is used beautifully in
medium-heeled walking shoes with
square toes and square bows. These
shoes might be worn with any color
ensemble — beige, blue, black, or
pastel blue or green.
The naval influence is affecting
shoes just as it is affecting all spring
fashions. Dark blue calf pumps
sport tongues simulating sailor col
lars. Gold and silver st;;rs gleam
from the toes of many new pumps.
Stanford's feminine feet will be
extra trim (his spring for shopping
tours or dancing in the City. That
slender, neat line is emphasized in
all the new dress shoes.
Pumps, well-fitted through the
arch, give the desired slim effect of
elegance with dressiness. Shoe ma
terials have been cut to fit like a
glove. Gabardine, always popular
in spring, is being shown more than
ever this year in an elasticized form
which slenderizes the foot.
Open toes are definitely fashion
