# Skirts Flare, Pleat In Flattering Lines
## 
### 
Skirls for spring have not changed
much from past years. Beige is the
best color, but pastels are still very
good. Light wools and flannels still
fill the bill, and of course, gay cot
tons in print or solid color are musts
which can carry over to summer.
Styles still hold to the simple
flare which will give a slim hip-line
which is to be desired. Soft box
pleats which fall into a gentle flare
below the stitch line are taking over
from the narrower pleats. News in
cottons is the broom straw wrinkle
which takes it cue from the preva
lent American Indian design.
