# 'No Raise in Tuition Now,' Say Trustees; Students To Pay Flat $10 Syllabus
## Dr. Wilbur Announces 'Unit Fees, Careful Planning, Rigid Economy' Will Balance University Budget 
### 
There will he "no further increase in University tuition at present," and
all students will he required to pay a flat syllabus fee of $10, the Board
of Trustees announced through President Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday.
Average syllabus fee paid by Stanford students has been $10.11, and
the figure of $10 was fixed on this basis.
The statement follows:
"While the income of the University has been seriously impaired by
existing conditions, it is anticipated that the income and outgo of the

University can be brought nto rea
sonable balance by careful budget
ing and rigid economy.
UNIT FEE OF $10
In order to avoid the many diffi
culties associated with the present
laboratory and syllabus fees, it was
decided to bring all of these mul
tiple fees into a unit laboratory and
syllabus fee of $10 a quarter in all
schools and departments for full
time registrants, except in the Grad
uate School of Business, Medical
School in San Francisco, Hopkins
Marine Station, Summer Field Geol
ogy, Civil Engineering, Surveying
Course, and Permits to Attend.
"This will obviate the nuisance
and expense of collecting and re
move many sources of irritation. It
will be effective for the academic
year 1941-1942.
BREAKAGE, RENTAL FEES
"With the elimination of the mul
tiple fee system and the installa
tion of the unit laboratory and syl
labus fee there will still be certain
expenses for the use of material and
breakage in Chemistry and micro
scope rental fees in various depart
ments. There will be no change in
the application fees, aptitude test
fees, appointment office fees or fines
for various purposes.
"In order to meet the constantly
growing requirements for Library
administration and acquisition, a $3
fee per quarter will be applied to
practically all of the students with
the beginning of the autumn quar
ter, 1941-1942."
