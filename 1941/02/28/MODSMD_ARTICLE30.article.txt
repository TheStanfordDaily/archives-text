# California Will Bear Standard Of Fashion Designing in U.S.A.
## Casual Sports Clothes Originate in West; Hollywood Sets Pace with Stars' Styles 
### 
With the eclipse of Parisian influence, California has taken the lead
in American fashion designing. Los Angeles, the center of the Western
clothes industry, supports a $15,000,000 yearly business, and employs over
10,000 workers.
Leaving dressy clothes to the Easterners, California designers special-

ize in the functional sports clothes
that are so popular and practical for
Western life-in-the-open.
Hollywood's designs for movies
and for the stars' personal ward
robes have been front-page news
for a long time, but only recently
have the volume manufacturers
come into prominence.
Buyers who are accustomed to
the chromium-plated salons of New
York are amazed at Far-Western
methods of doing business. Superb
ly tailored slacks, shorts, and spec
tator sports costumes are displayed
in large open factories decorated
with a gourd or two hanging in a
corner and a serape draped over a
chair.
But the stylists and manufacturers
are only a part of the huge Lor, An
geles clothing industry. Many Japa
nese, Filipinos, and Mexicans are
employed at piece work. Novel
necklaces, fine embroidery, original
leather work, and rawhide sandals
are their contribution to the busi
ness.
California's huge clothing indus
try has grown from a very bare start
15 years ago. At that time, a few
brave firms sent salesmen to Den
ver with samples of their sport
clothes. But even in 1932, only three
out-of-state firms thought that the
Los Angeles business was suffi
ciently important to merit resident
buyers. Today there are 15 buyers
there, serving 750 stores throughout
the United States.
