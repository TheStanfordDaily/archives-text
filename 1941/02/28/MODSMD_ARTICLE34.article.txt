# Spring Coats Feature Pastels, Soft Materials for Casual Wear
## White Camel's Hair Good For Casual Wear; Reefers Appear In Glen Plaids Influence of World War I Fashions Causes Revival of Capes in All Lengths 
### RUTH CAMPBELL 
The biggest news in spring coats is the increased use of pastels. Shades
inspired by Bahaman landscapes are enlivening old favorite materials.
One of the nicest coats for in-between-seasons is the perennial camel's
hair wrap-around, loose and comfortable, and tied casually around the
waist. In white or cloud-drift pastels it's perfect for spring evening excur-

sions to Dinah's.
Another stand-by fabric that is
getting a lift from softer shades -is
covert cloth. Always a college fa
vorite, in robin's egg blue or apple
green it takes on new glamour.
BLANKET CLOTH COATS
A Lanz coat that was introduced
this winter in Florida promises to
make spring and summer headlines.
It's white blanket cloth, fitted snugly
at the waist, and features a flaring
skirt and a hood. That last item
makes it especially valuable in
convertibles. The shoulders, sleeves,
and hood are decorated with leaf
green applique.
Perfect for Palm Springs is a
loose, fflll-length station wagon
coat in awning cloth, complete with
broad stripes. It would be particu
larly effective in beige with cinna
mon brown stripes.
Classic Glen plaid topcoats are
appearing in pinks, light blues, and
yellows. It's universally flattering in
a fitted reefer with this season's
wider, notched lapels.
CONSERVATIVE FLANNEL
Another new coat that should
please the more conservative ele
ment is a navy blue flannel shirt
waist model with a white pique col
lar and inverted cartridge pleats at
the shoulder. Perfect for teas and
dinner dates.
The new sloping shoulder line is
making its appearance in short, flar
ing coats of coduroy — surprisingly
good on tall girls. Another short
coat comes from war-time Paris, and
is distinguished by its complete
wearability for every occasion. Fall
ing half-way to the knees, it is very
full, with raglan sleeves and a draw
string waistline.
CAPE IS REVIVED
Rivaling these styles is the cape,
one of spring's nicest military inspi
rations. Sheer drama for evening
in white lamb's wool with gold
braid epaulets, the cape is practical
and flattering over suits. For more
formal afternoon wear, a navy blue
military cape with gold buttons at
the neck, and scarlet lining is sure
to promote favorable comment.
For the short woman who cannot
wear a long cape, wrist-length mod
els, often two- or three-tiered, are
particularly good.
Altogether, this spring's styles in
coats offer more variety than a
grateful public has seen in a long
time — and better than that, prac
ticality and flattery seem to be the
keynotes.
