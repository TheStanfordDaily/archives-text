# Shirtwaist Dresses Have New Touches
## 
### 
Shirtwaist frocks will as usual
come under the heading of spring
dependables this season, according
to American fashion arbiters in cur
rent conferences.
The switch will be from winter
and fall woollens to spring and sum
mer silks and washables. Colors
will start the slow merger from
navy to robin's egg to pale blue,
from rust through lacquer to pink,
from forest to apple green and so
on until the winter to spring tran
sition is accomplished.
Variations on the straight-up-and
down tailored version of the shirt
waist are several and interesting
this season. The fly-front has been
introduced and is sometimes used
on both the shirt and skirt, some
times on one or the other. Full, bil
lowy skirts are, for some occasions,
replacing the narrower, more tai
lored type.
For those with the not-so-small
waists, it will be welcome news that
the draw-string waistline, so popu
lar in woollens this fall, will be used
in spring and summer shirtwaists.
When this principle is extended to
the necklines, as soon it will be,
fashion experts will have a defini
tional problem on their hands: When
does a shirtwaist cease to be a
shirtwaist?
