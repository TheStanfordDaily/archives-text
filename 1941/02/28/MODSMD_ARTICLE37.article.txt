# Spring Papers Make Letters Fun To Write
## Stanford Co-eds Co For China Figures As Room Do-dads 
### 
With the coining of spring, the
stationers have put out new papers
to correspond to the prevailing
spirit of lightness and make letter
writing fun.
The new airmail paper is being
put out by Sheerlite in tans, browns,
blues, and pinks. Combined with
varied-colored inks, this new paper
should find favor with a large femi
nine public.
Another novelty in the stationery
world are gingham-lined envelopes
combined with plain paper. The
"return to grandmother's day" theme
seems to have hit this phase of the
woman's world, too. Similar to this
gingham are the all-over checked
papers which add variety to letter
writing.
Spring note paper is featured in
all the new colors—rust, terra cotta,
blue, and the usual white for con
servatives.
Spring also stimulates the desire
to dress one's room with silly do
dads. The craze for tiny china fig
ures seems to have hit the Stanford
co-ed with a vengeance. Kay's
terra cotta angel figures are very
popular. Two of the best feature
candles and ice-cream cones.
The DeLee figures are made in
many and varied styles. The ani
mals all carry appropriate names
which adds to their fascination for
collectors. Horses, rabbits and pigs
are among the favorites. The new
est additions to this family are the
tiny black skunks named "Stinkie"
and "Phew," and the flower-holding
brown chipmunk, "Mr. Chips."
