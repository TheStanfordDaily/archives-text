Sun glasses are naturally as im
portant for summer wear this year
as they have been in the past. Nev
ertheless, many improvements have
been made to perfect them, since they
were pi'eviously bad on the eyes.
Optometrists now prescribe sun
glasses for eye protection. People
will therefore put on their disguise
for almost any occasion, for these
specs do not harm one's seeing.
Now all we're waiting for are some
beautiful, sunny days in order to
test the glasses.
The Polaroid Corporation has put
on the market a newly shaped type
of sun glasses. One of the greatest
improvements is to master the
problem of overcoming glare, and
Polaroid has put out their glasses
with this addition.
These are greenish in color, lie
comfortably on the face, and are
held in place by an adjustable rub
ber head-strap. There is a bridge
across the back of the glasses which
protects the eyes and nose from the
danger of glass. The bridge rests
on the forehead. They are sold in
a leather case for two dollars.
The scalloped glasses have been
revived this year in view of their
success last season.
In general, the new glasses have
smokish lenses and are bordered by
rims of all colors. Because of their
popularity, practically all drug and
department stores carry these specs

in their merchandise. They are
more stylish in the slanting shape
than the past hectagon form. Sun
glasses are tending to be much
more flattering this year than they
have ever been, according to manu
facturers.
