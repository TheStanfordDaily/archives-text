# Farm Coeds to Don Palomino Footwear
## 
### 
This spring you'll find a variety of
really good ideas which have been
brewing for several seasons among
the shoemakers. The Palomino
shoes are the most interesting for
campus wear. They are the leather
mocassins that were introduced last
fall. New touches have been added
to make the shoes a little different
for spring.
There is one style with a strap
over the top and others with lacing
in the middle or up the side of the
shoes. The Palominos are incredibly
light and soft and flexible; hence they
are remarkably comfortable as well
as flattering. These shoes give you
that desired swinging stride at con
siderate prices.
Saddle shoes are still popular for
college women, but a new idea has
been added that really wows the
feet. Flowers are painted on the
front part of the shoes, and then you
have a good excuse for not cleaning
the leather.
