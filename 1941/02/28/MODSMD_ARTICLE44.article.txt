# Eastern Fashion Experts Praise Classic Styles At Stanford
## Mademoiselle's Campus Representative Reports Comments by Visiting Editors 
### CLAIRE BURTCHAELL Mademoiselle Editor, Stanford 
Keep wearing classics, Stanford coeds! For we are known as the col
lege girls who wear clothcs of impeccable, classic taste.
In a recent chat with the editor of "Mademoiselle," Betsy Talbot
Blackwell, I learned that we hold a high place in the eyes of the eastern
magazines of fashion. Our long cardigans, simple wools, camels-hair

coats, and rainy-weather boots are,
all symbols of the conservative and
collegiate.
"Not only are Stanford coeds
known for their simple, well made
clothes," I was told, "but as girls
who have learned what good groom
ing is." It's my personal belief that
our long healthy hair is the founda
tion of this good grooming. Despite
the chlorinated water, our Thurs
day night rush for the wash-basin
and hair-dryer is to some avail.
When last year's winner of the
famous "Vogue Prix de Paris," Miss
Mae Moon of Northwestern, was
here, she repeated the statement of
Mrs. Blackwell.
"You girls don't realize the awfully
high reputation you have back
East," she told me. "Going around
the campus I can see why." She
pointed out the simplicity of dress
on the Quad.
"While I've noticed in other col
leges that bobbie socks and anklets
are worn with clothes much dressier
than yours," she said, "here I find
silk stockings and quite a few high
heels combined with very plain
sports clothes. I think your way is
decidedly preferable."
Probably the long strands of shells
we've taken up only recently will
join the parade of classics for which
we've been so highly commended.
In addition, reversibles, crew or oil
skin hats, rubber boots, plaid suits,
spectator pumps, Shetland sweaters,
gored or pleated wool skirts, and
shirtmaker cottons are known as
"Stanford classics."
So our stamp of approval really
means as much as the ingenuity of
eastern coeds, who are famous as
originators of many college fads.
