If you've noticed the strands of
shells worn by the feminine con
tingent about the Quad, you may
be surprised to learn that they may
be purchased on the Geology Cor
ner. The shells come from the
Philippines, and since they are not
needed for research, they've been
strung and are being sold at a mod
erate price.
