# Daintiness Will End War Mode
## 
### 
It's always interesting to watch
feminine fashions' reaction to war,
a famous designer declared in an
interview over the air recently, j
There are two definite phases to
stylists' designing, she declared: the
ultra-military and mannish trend,
offset later by a return to daintiness.
To demonstrate her point the cou
turiere described the changes in
modes in the last three years.
First, she announced, thei'e was
the completely comic-opera military
design—large epaulettes, gay little
caps, rows of ribbon to simulate
medals, exaggerated belts to look
like cartridge carriers.
"Everyone looked like a charac
ter out of the ballet of 'The Student
Prince'," she said. "Any minute you
expected the women walking down j
an avenue to do a little marching
routine. That is an unfortunate pe
riod that apparently we had to go
through."
Then came tailored mannishness
—the crisp high shoulders that de
mand perfect carriage, the slender
skirts, a reduction in elaborate trin
kets and braid.
Out of this masculine trend there
has emerged a new desire to be
decorative, graceful, and charming.
This new idea, she added, is much
more apparent in the East and in
Europe — "what European designs
there are now."
