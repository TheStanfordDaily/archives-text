# Files Given Conditional Approbation
## Student Leaders Let Derision on Cards Go Until Spring Quarter 
### CHARLES BULL 
After an hour and a half of con
slant bickering back and forth,
eleven student leaders last night
came to the conclusion that the Ac
tivity Card Files had not been given
a completely fair trial and that judg
ment on abandonment or change
should be withheld until late in
spring quarter.
Chief reservation to the agreement
to let the Files continue was made
at the insistence of A.S.S.U. Vice-
President Anne Townsend — that a
good number of new and untried
aspiring activitymen registered in
Ihe Files be used on every com
mittee appointed.
Chairmen of Senior Prom and
Convalescent Home Drive Dan Hays
and Graham Barbee, have both vol
untarily used the files and have
taken on many new students who
have not played any part hereto
fore in one of Stanford's many com
mittees.
WAIT FOR REPORTS
"When reports come in from both
these men, we will have something
concrete to work with," reported
Files Co-chairman Phil Rosenthal.
During the course of the discus
sion these students shed the follow
ing light on the matter:
Bruce Jessup—Their purpose is to
increase democracy in committee
appointments; if they don't do this
then they have no justification.
George Jackson—Make the card a
part of the Registration book so ev
eryone will have to fill one out at
least once.
Jim Haugh—lf the files aren't
complete, they can't be democratic.
Anne Townsend—The whole pur
pose and only purpose is to spread
;'obs. There must be new people on
c very committee.

Graham Barbee — You can trust

Dan Hays—lf you get a friend to
work for you, you know the job
will be done, but I was curious.
Betty Avery—lt is not fair for one
person to be on more than one Con
valescent Home committee. . . . We

little needs.
Dwight Hutchinson — There is a
tremendous tendency to over-organ
ize everything.

tivity Card Files had not been given
a completely fair trial and that judg
ment on abandonment or change
should be withheld until late in
spring quarter.
Chief reservation to the agreement
to let the Files continue was made
at the insistence of A.S.S.U. Vice-
President Anne Townsend — that a
good number of new and untried
aspiring activitymen registered in
Ihe Files be used on every com
mittee appointed.
Chairmen of Senior Prom and
Convalescent Home Drive Dan Hays
and Graham Barbee, have both vol
untarily used the files and have
taken on many new students who
have not played any part hereto
fore in one of Stanford's many com
mittees.
WAIT FOR REPORTS
"When reports come in from both
these men, we will have something
concrete to work with," reported
Files Co-chairman Phil Rosenthal.
During the course of the discus
sion these students shed the follow
ing light on the matter:
Bruce Jessup—Their purpose is to
increase democracy in committee
appointments; if they don't do this
then they have no justification.
George Jackson—Make the card a
part of the Registration book so ev
eryone will have to fill one out at
least once.
Jim Haugh—lf the files aren't
complete, they can't be democratic.
Anne Townsend—The whole pur
pose and only purpose is to spread
;'obs. There must be new people on
c very committee.
MORE QUOTES
Graham Barbee — You can trust
and get better work from new people
whom you don't know.
Dan Hays—lf you get a friend to
work for you, you know the job
will be done, but I was curious.
Betty Avery—lt is not fair for one
person to be on more than one Con
valescent Home committee. . . . We
) iust co-ordinate all these separate
little needs.
Dwight Hutchinson — There is a
tremendous tendency to over-organ
ize everything.
After an hour and a half of con
slant bickering back and forth,
eleven student leaders last night
came to the conclusion that the Ac
tivity Card Files had not been given
a completely fair trial and that judg
ment on abandonment or change
should be withheld until late in
spring quarter.
