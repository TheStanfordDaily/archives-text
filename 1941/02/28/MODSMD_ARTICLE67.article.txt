# Sluggers to Fight Uclans
## Farm Glove Team Seeks Win Tonight 
### JOHN HORRALL 
If experience means anything, ami
it should in ring warfare, Stanford's
boxing team will take its first de
cision of the year tonight from the
invading 15ruins of U.C.L.A. This
is the first competition of the season
for the Little Hears, while the In
dians have met and heen defeated
by the Cpl Aggies and U.C.
There will be only five official
fights and one exhibition match on
tonight's program because the Bru
ins forfeited the heavyweight and
light - heavy bouts. Seeking his
third successive intercollegiate win,
Captain Tom Mac Michael will lead
the Cards into the fray. He fights
Ketchell in the 155-pound class.
Mac Michael scored a T.K.O. over
Cal's Chris Fox and the Aggies' Alex
Mechikoff.
Eronson Cooley, who has had just
the opposite luck as his captain in
losing both of his fights by close de
cisions, meets Hector Anton in the
120-pound bout. Anton is the only
returning member of U.C.L A's
1940 team.
LYON, WILSON TO BOX
Fight fans will see two Indians
putting on the gloves for the first
time this year for intercollegiate
competition in Dick Lyon and John
Wilson. Lyon battles Rutt in the
127-pound group, the class Stanford
has forfeited until tonight. Wilson,
a member of last year's team, fights
in the 135-pound division against
Oniki.
Flunk Hewitt or Johnson Chin
will box an exhibition in the 145-
pound weight against the Bruins'
Alia. Because Stanford is working
under the no-frosh ruling and be
cause the U.C.L.A. fighter is a first
year student, the fight in this weight
has to be ruled an exhibition. If
Chin, a frosh, fights, however, the
bout may be included in the final
results.
1 OS-POUNDERS MEET
Slugger John Ryan meets Lynch
in the heaviest fight of the night, the
165-pound class. Ryan could not
fight last week because of a sore
hand and lost his Aggie bout by
decision. He showed plenty of
power in the all-University cham
pionships, however, and should
come out on top this evening.
The first bell sounds at eight
o'clock tonight in the Pavilion when
Announcer Johnny Ward introduces
the 120-pounders. Toby Irwin will
referee, and Chris Connor and D. B.
Kearney will keep the time. There
will be no admission charee.
