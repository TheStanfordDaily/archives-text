# Indians to Face Bronco Nine In League Opener tomorrow
## 
### 
Blue chips go down tomorrow as the California Inter col legiato Baseball
Association opens with Stanford and Santa Clara colliding on the Bronco
diamond at o'clock. Up at Berkeley, Cal and St. Mary's. IC4O pennant
w inner, square oIY in the other game of northern league play.
Potentially the Santa Clarans have a stronger team this year than ever
before. Only three veterans were lost through graduation and have been
amply replaced. Coach Len Casa- *

nova has one of the finest keystone
combinations in the loop with Bill
Mullens at second and Neil Reese
at shortstop.
"Ace" Hanlon is definitely out of
the Indian line-up for Saturday's
j encounter. Coach Harry Wolter's
slugging soph catcher is hobbling
around with a stiff knee and may
not play for almost three weeks.
Taking over the backstop chores
will be either Jack Randall, now
eligible, or "Red" Fay. Herb At
kinson, regular second string catch
er, is in the hospital and probably
won't be in shape by game time.
Wolter has elected the veteran
"Cootie" Thompson to oppose the
Bronco sluggers on the mound. Ray
Hammett will start on first base and
"Botch" Caruso on second. The re
mainder of the line-up is the same
as in past games.
