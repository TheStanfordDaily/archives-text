# UNCLE SAM DRAWS FOUR ACES
## 
### 

POKER HAS NOTHING on Unce Samâ€”right in a row are four poten
tial aces at Hamilton Field, where the four Johnson brothers from
New Mexico are members of the 10th Pursuit Wing. Frederic, the
oldest, sits in the cockpit of a P-40 pursuit plane, Alexander points to
where he wants to go, James points to the controls and explains how
to get there, while Joseph, left, seems to say, "Phoey! You'll never
make it."
