A couple of times each year, the women on
The Daily staff come into their own.
Last night and the night before they really
arrived. And today's Spring Fashion Issue is
the result. They won't boast about it, so we'd
best toss a few orchids to them on our own ac
count. The issue was a honey.
Women's Editor Marge Hovey took the reins
on the 10 pages of fashions; edited, pencil
marked, muttered, and swallowed aspirins over
the whole thing. It was her baby from start to
finish.
It was her baby, but she wasn't alone with
it. The little green Shack was swarming with
Daily women for hours. What with copy read
ing, proof marking, swapping yarns, and
swizzling cokes, the Shack was kept humming.
And there was a lot more behind it all—the trips
to Paly and City stores, the leafing through
fashion magazine after fashion magazine—that
was a big part of the fun.
There were so many that we can't name them
all.
But we can't forget Managing Editor Janny
Gould. Or right-hand women Rosemarie Mul
lany, Ruth Campbell, Hattie Fisher, Pat Smith
or Olga Widmann. Each did a bit more than
her share.
Only masculine aide-de-camp was head pho
tographer Ted Reed, who shot all fashion
photographs. And he loved it.
As we interpret his (Dr. Wilbur's) words,
he takes the attitude that if the draft is to serve
the national defense cause most effectively,
each individual must be drafted for the
special tasks at which he could render the
most important service of which he is capable.
That is not a discriminatory plan. If all people,
whatever their vocational or social ranking,
are assigned in accordance with that prin
ciple, the draft administration will be fair to
all alike. If it should appear that the butcher,
the baker and the cahdlestick maker could
serve the national defense cause best by stick
ing to their present tasks, they should be held
there.
It merely happens that it is far more evi
dent in the case of the research groups that
their highest service could be rendered in
their regular vocational fields. Chances of
improvement in the very weapons of warfare
depend upon continuance of research activi
ties in the laboratories.—From the Palo Alto
Times editorial page.
