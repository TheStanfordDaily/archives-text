# Bellwether on Muck

\\T A7e11," said Bellwether as he walked along
VV the lake bank, "I must say this is mucky
stuff."
I smirked. "Emery, best keep an eye out to
where you're walking. Can't expect those pud
dles to move, you know."
The Great Man looked down an interminable
length of nose at me. "Laddie," he gesticulated
reprovingly, "I was speaking of something on
a higher plane than mud puddles. Pud muddles
indeed." He absent-mindedly ambled through
another just to prove his scorn.
"Listen, Bellwether," I answered humbly,
"what mucky stuff were you talking about?
The Union coffee?" We eased over to the boat
house dock and sat down.
The Sage clapped one ham-like paw on my
shoulder and filched the pack of smokes from
my jacket with the other. "Laddie," he said as
he lighted up, "this cheating in exams is plenty
mucky."
I nodded somberly. "Emery," I said, "you hit
the nail on the head."
"I think I'm sitting on one, too," muttered
Bellwether, gingerly moving over a few inches.

"Don't be persnickity, Bellwether. What about
this muck stuff?"
The Great Man rubbed himself mournfully.
"Well, laddie, we'd best do something about
this cheating business. We'd best form a vigi
lantee committee."
I was amazed. "What kind of a vigilantee,
Bellwether? Aren't you going a bit hog-wild?"
The Sage sniffed. "No, laddie, what I mean
is a pencil-tapping vigilantee. Work like a
charm."
It was baffling. "What, may I ask, is this
pencil-tapping brigade of yours? Sounds like a
wild-West movie."
Bellwether glanced disgustedly at me. "Lad
die," he said. "It's the logical approach. Say
you're taking an ex. You spot somebody deal
ing from the bottom of the deck. You start tap
ping with your pencil. Somebody else takes it
up. Pretty soon the whole class is doing it.
Simple. The guy breaks under the strain.
Came the dawn. "Bellwether," I applauded.
"It's gigantic. You're a great man!"
The Sage nodded wisely. "True," he said.
