### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
NOTHING VENTURED
HPHEY turned the lights on in the Hoover War
Library tower last night. For two years people
have been insisting that a 280-foot pinnacle jutting
above the Quad just didn't slip into the pattern of
Stanford architecture.
Now that they've pulled down the scaffolding and
they're thinking of mounting the bells and pretty soon
they'll be playing tunes from "the top of the libe," the
tower doesn't look too bad.
In fact, last night through the Farm's perennial
winter quarter mist, the libe looked downright beau
tiful.

committee workers gathered around Ex
com's oval table last night to hash over the Activi
ties Card File. If E. Phillips Oppenheim were writing
about the little gathering he'd say it was a "tense,
dramatic situation."
On one side of the table was Betty Avery, the Card
File czar, and on the other side Dan Hays, senior prom
chairman and public enemy number one. Before the
discussion, the usual group had collected in Bruce
Jessup's office. Some gagster started to introduce Dan
and Betty, but the Czar nodded to the Enemy and
said, "Thanks, we've met. At least, we correspond."
It was a very friendly meeting all around.

the last few days a very worried Women's Edi
tor and her very feminine staff have been working
on the Fashion Edition of the paper. A fashion issue
appears twice a year. It is a concession that the edi
torial staff makes to the business staff, because the
revenue from ad sales is tremendous.
All the women have been writing very rhapsod
ically about "charming spring touches" and "stylized
simplicity." One of their fashion mags that was lying
around the Shack had a story about week-ends in
New York.
These week-ends were classified as "cheap," "mod
erately priced," and "expensive." We got some px-etty
fancy tips on where-to-go-and-what-to-do.
The cheap week-end, it seems, is anything under
about $25. The next bracket extends to around $100.
And for a really expensive week-end, the sky's the
limit.
After investigating the situation through the pages
of Mademoiselle, this is my personal warning: be pro
vincial, but stay away from New York.
