# CAMPUS OPINION
## SLIGHTED RIGHTED 
### 
r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
In an edition of The Stanford Daily there ap
peared a letter signed "Slighted J. Mcß." registering
disappointment regarding the time set for the climax
of the Fiftieth Anniversary Celebration.
It is of course unfortunate that the time of the
Dedication of the Hoover Library, the Symposium, and
the Formal Academic Convocation, will prevent a great
number of the student body to participate in these
events. The explanation lies in the fact that Stanford,
during the week of June 15-21, will be host to hun
dreds of institutions which have been invited to send
representatives and the dates had to coincide with a
time when the delegates would be free from their
academic duties.
Regarding the Hoover Library and the playing of
the carillon bells, the building will be finished prior to
the time of its dedication and will be open to the
inspection of the students. The installation of the car
illon will begin the first week in March and the bells
will be heard many times before the end of the spring
quarter.
Also, it is not the purpose of the Commemoration
Committee to exclude the students from the Sympos
ium on "The University and the Future of America,"
or for that matter, any of the events of the Anniver
sary year. All students who remain over for the
week of Academic Celebration from June 15 to 21
will be cordially welcome to attend these events.
Of particular interest to the students will be the
program planned for October 1-2-3, which is now being
formulated. These dates will be University holidays
especially designed for undergraduate participation in
the Anniversary program. "Slighted J. Mcß." will not
feel slighted when this program unfolds.
Sincerely yours,
Arthur L. Gore,
Member of Committee
on Commemoration
