# CLEAR. PASSIONATE HATE
## 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
Ickcs said tonight: "I hate Hate."
I hope we all do —passionately and clearly.
No one does not hate what Hitler stands for—but
I personally believe and think that men like Ford and
Lindbergh believe or, better yet, realize that Hitler is
merely a product of Hate.
This Hate was undeniably created only and solely
because one side won the last war and on that excuse
set up the Hate by their actions—get the real story—
which has sprung to undemocratic actions by the guys
that got kicked when they were down.
Lindbergh and Ford and many others are sincerely
interested in preventing a repetition of this hateful
cycle. The only single way in which this is possible
now is that this war will not be won—and be contin
ued after conquest by persecution of the conquered—
either by Germany, Britain, or any other interested
party.
If anyone would like to show that the victors of
World War I did not create the Hate which now
plagues them, it will be humorously interesting to see
him present the evidence-the cold, hard facts.
C.G.
