# Bogey-Man Bogart Plays 'Good' Badman in Latest
## 
### 
"High Sierra," with Humphrey 80-<
gart and Ida Lupino, now playing
at the Fox Stanford.
There have been other pictures
about notorious bad men, there have
been a lot of them, but that doesn't
stop this from being a dramatic,
tender hour and a half.
it tells the story of Roy Earle,
who has been in prison for eight
years and who, after he gets out,
sets immediately to work on a big
job that will set him up in Europe
for the rest of his life.
But you don't hate Roy Earle
because Roy Earle is a good kind
of a bad man. You like him be
cause he looks up at the mountains
and the trees and the stars and feels
fine. You like him because he stops
and talks to a little dog. Because
he helps a crippled girl to walk
again, because he is loyal in his dis
torted way, because he lets Marie,
a girl he doesn't love, hang around
with him when she has nowhere to

> These things make you like Roy
Farle, but they don't stop him from
getting his just due. He gets it on
the High Sierras, leaning on a slab
of rock.
if you like Humphrey Bogart, you
will really enjoy this picture. From
the very begining when he slaps
big Bartop. McLane you know that
he is what he should be and that
the picture is sure to be good.
The way he was so cool when he
was working a job, the way he
talked, the way he winced, the way
he looked when he kissed Marie. It
was all good and he was perfect even
when he died leaning on the rock.
Miss Ida Lupino was also very
good and proved again that she is
one of Hollywood's finest actresses.
She was Marie, the girl from the
Dime and Dance hall in Los Ange
les, who had never known anyone
worth knowing until she saw Earle,
the killer bandit.
It is good. See it.â€”Saroyan
