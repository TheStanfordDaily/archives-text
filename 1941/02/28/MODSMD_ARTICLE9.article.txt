# Coach Frye Lauds New High In Modern Boxing Competition
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
"Boxing has undergone a marvelous change in the last 30 years, even
if I don't go back that far. It's now on a much higher plane and we arc
fighting to keep it there—even to raise the standards higher."
Boxing Coach Clayton Frye was talking, trying to be heard above the
staccato of the punching bags and rope-skipping.
"The change in college boxing is even more pronounced," the coach
plains. There was little intercollegiate competition in the early 'twen-

ties and all fighting was under the,
American Athletic Union."
"Now intercollegiate meets are
prevalent, and under no one organi
zation. But boxing is now safer—
bigger gloves—has better personnel
and training equipment, and the
spirit is much finer."
WON CHAMPIONSHIPS
And Coach Frye should know of
what he speaks; he has fought in
the amateur ring up and down the
coast, winning numerous titles, and
has coached amateurs for years.
He first saw action at Oregon State,
and after winning the college wel
terweight title he became coach of
the team while still a student.
Between surveying trips for the
government, Coach Frye won the
middle and welterweight champion
ships of the Pacific Northwest, the
Coast championship, a national
A.A.U. title, and boxed for the
Multnomah Athletic Club of Port
land.
Before coming to Stanford in 1937,
Coach Frye was head boxing coach
at the Los Angeles Athletic Club
and his pupils won berths on the
1928 and 1932 Olympic teams.
"And were those '28 Olympic fights
something," the coach says. "Tuz

zolini was defeated easily enough,
but when they gave the decision to
Miller's opponent, the English and
American boxing teams just about
withdrew from the meet, because
the decision was so bad."
HE LIKES FARM
When speaking of his experiences
at Stanford, the coach smiles. "I've
never seen anything like it here—the
way the fellows work and the cour
age they show. Take the Cal
matches for example. We were short
several fighters because of sickness
but four other fellows took to the
ring with only 15 minutes' notice."
"No, I've never seen anything like
the spirit here."

"Now intercollegiate meets are
prevalent, and under no one organi
zation. But boxing is now safer—
bigger gloves—has better personnel
and training equipment, and the
spirit is much finer."
WON CHAMPIONSHIPS
And Coach Frye should know of
what he speaks; he has fought in
the amateur ring up and down the
coast, winning numerous titles, and
has coached amateurs for years.
He first saw action at Oregon State,
and after winning the college wel
terweight title he became coach of
the team while still a student.
Between surveying trips for the
government, Coach Frye won the
middle and welterweight champion
ships of the Pacific Northwest, the
Coast championship, a national
A.A.U. title, and boxed for the
Multnomah Athletic Club of Port
land.
Before coming to Stanford in 1937,
Coach Frye was head boxing coach
at the Los Angeles Athletic Club
and his pupils won berths on the
1928 and 1932 Olympic teams.
"And were those '28 Olympic fights
something," the coach says. "Tuz

zolini was defeated easily enough,
but when they gave the decision to
Miller's opponent, the English and
American boxing teams just about
withdrew from the meet, because
the decision was so bad."
HE LIKES FARM
When speaking of his experiences
at Stanford, the coach smiles. "I've
never seen anything like it here—the
way the fellows work and the cour
age they show. Take the Cal
matches for example. We were short
several fighters because of sickness
but four other fellows took to the
ring with only 15 minutes' notice."
"No, I've never seen anything like
the spirit here."
"Boxing has undergone a marvelous change in the last 30 years, even
if I don't go back that far. It's now on a much higher plane and we arc
fighting to keep it there—even to raise the standards higher."
Boxing Coach Clayton Frye was talking, trying to be heard above the
staccato of the punching bags and rope-skipping.
"The change in college boxing is even more pronounced," the coach
plains. There was little intercollegiate competition in the early 'twen-

ties and all fighting was under the,
American Athletic Union."
"Now intercollegiate meets are
prevalent, and under no one organi
zation. But boxing is now safer—
bigger gloves—has better personnel
and training equipment, and the
spirit is much finer."
