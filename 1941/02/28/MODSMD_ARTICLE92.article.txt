# American Designers Step Into Fashion's Top Spots With Demise of Parisians
## 'Fashion Futures' Demonstrates Close U.S.A. Harmony with South America, Greece; Army, Navy Motifs Predominate 
### ZELDA JOLIN 
No more Paris; no more Parisian labels. Paris, the fashion center for
the world, is a thing of the past.
America, long a runner-up for fashion supremacy of the world, has
at last come into her own right. She is now the world's exclusive fashion
center.
The general trend of American fashion as illustrated hy "Fashion Fu
tures" in New York City, Jan. 8 and !), runs in direct harmony with

America's national feeling. Amer
ica has borrowed much from her
friends — China, South America,
Mexico, Greece, and Turkey. We
notice concentration on friendly,
"neutral" colors or heartening vivid
colors. There will be little black
shown this spring. And what could
be more in harmony with the na
tion's feeling than the predominance
of army and navy motifs, that
started last year and has gone this
year in all types of clothes —from
batiling suits to formals.

From China, American fashion has
borrowed grace of symmetry and
balance. We see loose-swinging coolie
jackets, small upstanding collars, ki
mono sleeves, pagoda hats, frog
fa.Uonings on all types of gowns,
and tunics that Hare out over slim
-killed evening dresses.
From Greece we get the beauty
of simplicity and grace of line. Gre
cian drapery is seen in afternoon
dresses as well as in evening gowns.
The fabric is twisted and draped
hi:>h in front and is allowed to fall
in slim graceful lines.
TURKEY GIVES
Turkey's gift to vis is seen in the
latest skirt creations designed after
the harem skirts. They are pulled
on like trousers and show a billowy
loveliness and grace.
John-Frederics, one of the fore
most of American designers, whose
superb collection is carried exclu
sively in San Francisco by Living
ston Bros., got a world of ideas from
a collection of American primitive
paintings. He is now turning to
the straw bonnet, the fichu ball
dress, and the hearth-side crocheted
wrapper.
"Dandyism" is another trend that
has clasped fashion by the throat.
FASHION RETURNING
Tomorrow's fashion will return,
too, to the thirty-years-ago period
for more of its varied inspirations.
The erocheted dress, white and fussy
in our mothers' day, is back in
streamlines. Back too are fur-tails
for suit trimmings, dog-collars, ja

! bots in stalk white that do so much
i for the dark stand-by dress, bold
| buttons, wool stockings, and the un-
I forgettable serge.
Germaine Monteil, whose designs
are exclusive at Ransohoff's, was the
first to bring the bare midriff into
popularity. She was the first to
bring out skirts tiered around the
hemlines which are becoming in
creasingly popular this season.
BEIGE IS FAVORITE
Charles Amour, whose superb de
signs are displayed by Livingston's,
concentrates chiefly upon the Sun
day night dinner dress and the
street length lame cocktail gown.
His favorite color—the one he pre
dicts will be the fashion future of
America—is beige.
The Startling use of colors in this
season's fashion review comes large
ly from the paint-boxes of our own
American Indians. Tehelitchew, an
artist fascinated by the subterranean
vistas of the South Seas, brought to
the fore such luscious shades as red
amber, sea wheat, fire coral, and
aquamarine.
NO MORE PADDING
Smooth sloping shoulders are pre
dicted; no more stiff masculine pad
ding. This season shoulders are defi
nitely dropped and sleeves have
deeper arrnholes. The woman of
fashion must be feminine. She must
wear peplums to make her waist
look smaller and ruffles to make
her look more dainty.
Her hats must have lots of flow
ers, ribbons, and veils. She can be
sweet and demure or exotic, but she
must be well-groomed and smart.
On the whole, the trend in afternoon
clothes is toward dressier garments,
with umbrella skirts made of alter
nating tiers of grosgrain and crepe.
