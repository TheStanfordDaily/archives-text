# Ex-Bull Sessioner Urges Students to Collect Odd Bits: Jeans, Old Pumps
## Campus to Shed Boots, Slickers; Don Light Clothes; Ames Suggests Loud Hawaiian Shirts for Beach Excursions 
### BUD AMES 
What sort of clothes will y«u need t:> (it into the activities of the coming
spring quarter? At first thought, the answer might well he, "Oh, just a
bathing suit and a pair of sun glasses."
It is true that for the wilder side of spring quarter activities, a bath
ing suit and a pair «if sun glasses will just about cover everything. Period.

But Farm men and women have
found and will find that they will
need knicknacks in order to be
dressed for the occasion.
It is a good idea to begin saving
odd bits of rustic clothing now.
Don't throw away those old jeans,
or those red-checked laundry bags,
or that old pair of pumps. They
will be the height of fashion during
Back to (he Farm Week and Con
valescent. Home Week when Stan
ford students will really be down on
the Farm.
GET READY TO WALK
Spring quarter, with its absence
of rain puddles, will probably see
the widespread return of moccasins
to the campus walks and fields—
mostly fields. Fur women, specta
tor pumps wili increase with the
sunshine. They are just the thin**,
and make the legs look 100 per cent
better.
Both men and women will find it
well worth the investment to pur
chase at least a couple of those loud
Hawaiian shirts which are just the
thing on those forages on Haifmoon
Bay. They wear well, and look sim

ply swell chasing or being chased
down the beach.
And a note to the women in the
'more formal vein. Spring quarter
is the quarter of proms, dances,
house and hall dances, and every
type of smooth-up dance imaginable.
So for the women who "simply can't,
who simply wouldn't think of being
seen in the same formal twice in
the same week," it would be a good
idea to buy an extra formal, some
thing of a frothy, summery nature.
Or you can teach your mother how
to sew and have her put her eyes
out making formals for you.
And finally, remember that you
will be going home pretty soon for
Easter vacation. When you are
home, remember to pick up the fol
lowing knicknacks which will prove
no end of convenience and the height
of fashion for spring quarter.
More Stanford roughs have brown
hair than any other color, with
black, blond and red following in
occurrence frequency.

GET READY TO WALK
Spring quarter, with its absence
of rain puddles, will probably see
the widespread return of moccasins
to the campus walks and fields—
mostly fields. Fur women, specta
tor pumps wili increase with the
sunshine. They are just the thin**,
and make the legs look 100 per cent
better.
Both men and women will find it
well worth the investment to pur
chase at least a couple of those loud
Hawaiian shirts which are just the
thing on those forages on Haifmoon
Bay. They wear well, and look sim

ply swell chasing or being chased
down the beach.
And a note to the women in the
'more formal vein. Spring quarter
is the quarter of proms, dances,
house and hall dances, and every
type of smooth-up dance imaginable.
So for the women who "simply can't,
who simply wouldn't think of being
seen in the same formal twice in
the same week," it would be a good
idea to buy an extra formal, some
thing of a frothy, summery nature.
Or you can teach your mother how
to sew and have her put her eyes
out making formals for you.
And finally, remember that you
will be going home pretty soon for
Easter vacation. When you are
home, remember to pick up the fol
lowing knicknacks which will prove
no end of convenience and the height
of fashion for spring quarter.
More Stanford roughs have brown
hair than any other color, with
black, blond and red following in
occurrence frequency.
What sort of clothes will y«u need t:> (it into the activities of the coming
spring quarter? At first thought, the answer might well he, "Oh, just a
bathing suit and a pair of sun glasses."
It is true that for the wilder side of spring quarter activities, a bath
ing suit and a pair «if sun glasses will just about cover everything. Period.

But Farm men and women have
found and will find that they will
need knicknacks in order to be
dressed for the occasion.
It is a good idea to begin saving
odd bits of rustic clothing now.
Don't throw away those old jeans,
or those red-checked laundry bags,
or that old pair of pumps. They
will be the height of fashion during
Back to (he Farm Week and Con
valescent. Home Week when Stan
ford students will really be down on
the Farm.
