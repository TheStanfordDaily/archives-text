# Ideal 'Dressy Sport' Good For Symphony Or Show Date
## Shantung Leads Fabrics In Season's 'Spectators' 
### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
"Dressy sports clothes" is a category, something like the "basic dress"
category, hut it serves a definite purpose in the college wardrobe. "Oh,
just wear dressy sports things" is heard in reference to anything from
faculty dinner nights to a Phi Delt fireside.
Dressy sports things range from tailored silks to silk prints with
matching redingote, contrary to the Stanford co-ed's belief that "dressy

sports" means the usual skirt and<
sweaters plus high heels.
Typical good spring dressy sports
is a three-toned dress of wool
jersey, made with tailored shirt
waist top and full skirt. The blouse
is of a sandy beige, with a cummer
bund insert of scarlet, and navy
blue skirt. Navy pumps and beret
for teas, etc.
ADAPTABILITY RKQUIREI)
The essential requirement of a
dressy sports outfit is that it be
adaptable. It must be a "smooth"
outfit when accessories are used,
and yet it should be simple enough
for a movie and a quick dash down
to Dinah's.
Dominating the late spring dressy
sports clothes will be that casual
fabric, silk shantung. In natural
and pastel shades, shantung shirt
dresses and suits will make many
an "indispensable" dress.
SILK PRINTS POPULAR
Always popular, the silk print
with harmonizing redingote will be
an all-around outfitâ€”for lunch in
the city, teas, and dressier events.
According to local shops, silk
prints this spring are going to be
more vivid. Paisleys in bright red,
green, and blue will brighten the
campus, replacing the casual cash
meres of tall and winter quarters.
Less dressy, but adaptable are
three outfits from a Paly shop re
nowned for its sports clothes.
DRESSMAKERS AGAIN
A blue and white polka-dotted
dressmaker dress with a misty blue
rabbit's - wool short - sleeved jacket
will be good on Quad, and smooth
with high heels at L'Omelette. A
sheer wool of beige, green, and pink
small plaid with pigskin belt and
round neck under a spring topcoat
of pale blue-green wool will also
brighten up spring evenings.
Ever-vocal campus stylists are
loud in their praise of pastel covert
cloth suits. The longer jackets with
handstitched edges and flared skirts
to match are perfect for spring shop
ping expeditions, and they give you
that peas-in-the-pod look if you
can inveigle him into donning an
identical-in-cut-and-styling gabar
dine suit.
