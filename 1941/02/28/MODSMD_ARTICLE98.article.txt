"Bathing suits for girls who really
want to swim" is the motto for this
year's bathing styles, and the de
signers really seem to mean it, for
all the new features make for added
comfort and service.
We can be thankful that no longer
will we see all the frilly beach
daisies dressed in coy strapless mod
els of such a treacherous character
that the owners are afraid to go
near the water. No longer will we
see them, I say, because, thanks to
some heaven-born inspiration, this
year's style leaders have declared
them out. Instead we have smooth
little models with bold straps, bare
midriffs and skirts less flared.
The latest suits stress straps.
There are straps in contrasting col
ors, wide straps that imitate sailor
collars and even straps with strange
little figure designs on them; but in
all the models the straps play an
important part in the design of the
whole.
MIDRIFFS RAKE
The midriffs are bare, whether the
suits be one piece or two. Some of
the tops are like little short bodices
and we see much of the old stand
by—the halter-neck top. Many of
the suits are relieved by sashes of
bright materials around the waist.
The suits are less ballerina than
last year, although the feminine
little flared skirts are quite popular.
These, however, have less flare in
them and no frills. It seems to be
a toss-up in popularity between the
flared skirt models and those which
have only little shorts, although
many models with skirts only at the
front are being shown.
JERSEY IN VOGUE
Though wool jersey and Jastex
materials are very much in vogue,
there is a great trend toward rub
ber bathing suits. Tlyse come in
plain colors with contrasting knitted
straps or fringes on the flared skirts.
Plain-colored bathing suits are
most popular except in the satin
lastex, which come in printed all
over patterns, and in jerseys which
have candy stripes.
All in all, this year seems to have
taken on a more reserved note. The
strapless suit has been replaced by
the smoother strapped model, the
frilly skirt of last year has been
toned down, and the wild prints and
eccentricities have been replaced by
simple sophisticated lines and im
provements for comfort.

We can be thankful that no longer
will we see all the frilly beach
daisies dressed in coy strapless mod
els of such a treacherous character
that the owners are afraid to go
near the water. No longer will we
see them, I say, because, thanks to
some heaven-born inspiration, this
year's style leaders have declared
them out. Instead we have smooth
little models with bold straps, bare
midriffs and skirts less flared.
The latest suits stress straps.
There are straps in contrasting col
ors, wide straps that imitate sailor
collars and even straps with strange
little figure designs on them; but in
all the models the straps play an
important part in the design of the
whole.
MIDRIFFS RAKE
The midriffs are bare, whether the
suits be one piece or two. Some of
the tops are like little short bodices
and we see much of the old stand
by—the halter-neck top. Many of
the suits are relieved by sashes of
bright materials around the waist.
The suits are less ballerina than
last year, although the feminine
little flared skirts are quite popular.
These, however, have less flare in
them and no frills. It seems to be
a toss-up in popularity between the
flared skirt models and those which
have only little shorts, although
many models with skirts only at the
front are being shown.
JERSEY IN VOGUE
Though wool jersey and Jastex
materials are very much in vogue,
there is a great trend toward rub
ber bathing suits. Tlyse come in
plain colors with contrasting knitted
straps or fringes on the flared skirts.
Plain-colored bathing suits are
most popular except in the satin
lastex, which come in printed all
over patterns, and in jerseys which
have candy stripes.
All in all, this year seems to have
taken on a more reserved note. The
strapless suit has been replaced by
the smoother strapped model, the
frilly skirt of last year has been
toned down, and the wild prints and
eccentricities have been replaced by
simple sophisticated lines and im
provements for comfort.
Jewelry highlight of '36—synthetic
emeralds, rubies, and sapphires
banded together by large silver or
gold settings into man-sized rings.
"Bathing suits for girls who really
want to swim" is the motto for this
year's bathing styles, and the de
signers really seem to mean it, for
all the new features make for added
comfort and service.
