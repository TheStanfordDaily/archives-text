# Sport Clothes To Join Swing To Patriotism
## Variety to Keynote Trend in Playsuits For Summer Wear 
### 
America's sport-loving designers
of shorts and play suits have jumped
on the military bandwagon with a
vengeance. But with special pref
erence for the navy. You'll find
sailor suits and gold buttons, big
collars and star-emblazoned sleeves.
And everywhere it's red, white, and
hi ue.
This spring will see the innova
tion of a new type of shorts â€”longer
and with cuffs. And, to be worn
with them, long-sleeved shirts, some
'of them with a red and gold and
blue eagle insignia.
DENIMS STILL IN FAVOR
And then there are denims again.
Li)*ht blue, faded-looking denim
playsuits with white-bordered sai
lor collars and white stars on the
pockets.
Silk jersey is being used more
and more for play suits but these
are far less functional than the
old standbys: cotton, linen, pique,
denim, and sharkskin.
There's a new material on the
market which has recently been de
veloped by enterprising American
sports designers. It's a rayon woven
to resemble the popular Glen plaid
tweed. This too is being used for
playsuits, but it's way up there in
the money.
FEMININE PLAY SUITS
Ever popular are the dirndl type
play suits, ruffly and feminine with
full peasant skirts. They come in
gay soft-colored cotton prints and
are the best bet in the less-tailored
group.
Stripes are very popular, for
complete play suits and for shirts
and tops which resemble crew
shirts. Red and white candy stripes
are best.
And as always, there are the clas
sic gabardine shorts in white or
navy, the smooth sharkskin en
sembles, and countless gaudy plaids.
All are cool, practical, and good
looking.
