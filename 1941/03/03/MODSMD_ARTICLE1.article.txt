jpROM four Balkan capitals yes
terday came ominous reports, all
of which indicated that the Nazis
and the British are drawing closer
and closer to each other in that re
gion . . . and neither has any inten
tion of turning back. When the two
collide, the concussion is going to
knock the little Balkan countries,
without exception, galley-west.
This week-end the Germans,
hitherto stationed in Rumania,
poured across the Danube into
Bulgaria. Already crack panzer
divisions are reported to have
taken up positions at the Struma
valley passes just about <»0 miles
from the sore-thumb port of Sa
lonika.
In Sofia, the Bulgarian govern
ment issued what was probably the
most futile statement made by a
"neutral" in the last eight months.
". . . the presence of German
troops here has changed nothing in
Bulgaria's peace policy," the state
ment said, "and Bulgaria remains
loyal to the contracted engagements
she has assumed, and is firmly de
cided not to depart from the funda
mental course of abstaining from
all aggression and all that would
menace the interests of anyone."

r JPHE Nazis have taken up their
menacing position on the Greek
border in order to put teeth into
Hitler's promise that unless the
Greeks submit to peace with Italy
within a few days, they will "suffer
the consequences."
On the other hand, the occupa
tion of Bulgaria has removed all
necessity for the Greeks' keeping
British troops out of their coun
try. Prior to this time, Athens has
shied away from a British Expe
ditionary Force, because it might
provoke a German attack.

EDEN and a large staff
of military and diplomatic ad
visers arrived in Athens yesterday
afternoon. Neutral diplomats in
Athens, who don't mind talking to
newspapermen, expressed the opin
ion that he will probably discuss
plans for the landing of a British
force very soon.
Since Eden had with him a
complete outline of the agreement
concluded with Turkey last week,
it is probable that he will inform
Premier Korisis and King George
of the full extent of the Anglo-
Turkish plans. Ankara sources
think that he will also seek a "no
separate peace" pledge from the
Greek allies.
On the surface the Greeks appear
undaunted by the Nazi moves, and
have stated officially that there can
be no question of their submitting
to a dictated peace, and that Greece,
confident of the support of her
British ally, will fight till she drops.

of all the comments
coming out of the supercharged
area, however, was a report from
Belgrade in a Budapest newspaper,
claiming that Greece had asked
President Roosevelt for advice on
the Balkan situation. A Jugoslavian
report published in a Hungarian
newspaper regarding a Greek sit
uation can be taken for what you
think it's worth. Neither Athens nor
Washington has mentioned such a
request.
Meanwhile in Ankara, reports
that Russia is moving toward
"improved relations" with Great
Britain arc making (he diplomatic
rumor-rounds. Such a develop
ment is logical in view of the fact
that Nazi forces in Bulgaria are
about 15 miles from Adrianople
and about 100 miles from the Dar
danelles and Istanbul. All three
key spots arc the property of
Turkey, but of vital interest to
Soviet Russia.
An attack by Germany on both
Greece and Turkey is logical since
an attack on Greece alone would
leave the Nazi flank exposed at the
point where the Turkish army is
mobilized on the Greek and Bul
garian borders. And Turkey has a
"complete agreement on all mat
ters" with Great Britain.
Shakespeare's "Dame Rumor"
also said that Stalin and Molotov
would arrive in Ankara soon. No
confirmation, either in Moscow or
Ankara.
