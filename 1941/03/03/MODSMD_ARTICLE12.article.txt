# Reporters Find Car Chivalry Is Not Dead, Just Dormant
## 
### 
(Just to check on how the old "Rides to Paly" tradition was holding
up since completion of the underpass, The Daily, on two separate after
noons last week, sent out two reporter teams: Beryl Robison and Claudia
Nettles; Bob Sontag and John liorrall. Most newsworthy finding is that
women DO NOT believe in the old tradition. The separate stories of each
team are printed below.—The Editor)

THE WOMEN SAY—
Two windblown girls stood in the
rain in front of Encina to test the
courtesy of the Stanford family and
to see if the old "rides to Paly" tra
dition was still alive. We felt rather
silly but encouraged ourselves by
saying that The Daily must have
facts and stepped forward.
First to pick us up were a boy and
girl from U.C.L.A. who said that
their campus had the same tradi
tion. We alighted in Paly, and
waited on Wilson's corner for a
ride back. As we were waiting, a
truckman hollered, "Rey girlies,
next time try horses." Very fu.my,
we murmured.
Mrs. Fagan, wife of Professor El
mer Fagan of the Economics De
partment, was the only woman who
stopped for us in our eight pick-ups.
Several Stanford girls whizzed by
without even looking; the majority
were driving new coupes—alone.
Needless to say, we were bitterly
disappointed in what we had always
considered the "better half" of the
Stanford family.
Several gray-haired couples in
Packards took no notice of us but
drove serenely on, enjoying the
scenery on Palm Drive.
In our four round trips, one out of
about every four cars stopped to
pick us up. Of the four that passed,
two were usually full. We arrived
back at the Daily shack slightly
windblown but happy to know that
chivalry is not yet dead and that a
great part of the Stanford family
who have cars are still friendly and
thoughtful enough to give rides to
the less fortunate members. It's a
swell tradition!

THE MEN SAY—
A Pi Phi roared by, naturally. A
fraternity brother with a blind date
did the same, obviously. We were
getting a little cold standing out
there on the Y turn, Johnny and I.
Suddenly a courageous soul in a
blue Plymouth pulled up, and we
had our ride to Paly. We were
kinda nervous, not knowin' the
fella or nothin". He spoke first.
"Where y'a headed, boys?"
"Smith's, on the Circle, you know,"
piped Johnny, trying to sound nice
and friendly like.
"Nice place, Smith's," remarked
the driver.
From Smith's back, a queen
zoomed by in a Model A, two more
fraternity brothers waved as they
passed us, and finally a guy and his
gal slowed down, looked us over,
and decided to pick us and four
other ride-chasers up. Before we
knew it the driver let us out thir
teen blocks away from our destina
tion without a word.
We found that about one in every
five gave us rides—but never a lone
woman, or any other kind of a
woman for that matter. It was
always the men who stopped, talked,
and went out of their way to get
us where we wanted to go. Older
people, such as professors or visi
tors, didn't even slow down, but
that was to be expected.
As far as make of car goes, there
was no discrimination. Within one
hour, we had rides in a big Buick,
a Plymouth, and a couple of Fords.
However, from the rather small
amount of cars that went by, appar
ently some people don't go by the Y
turn. How come, we don't know.

chivalry is not yet dead and that a
great part of the Stanford family
who have cars are still friendly and
thoughtful enough to give rides to
the less fortunate members. It's a
swell tradition!

THE MEN SAY—
A Pi Phi roared by, naturally. A
fraternity brother with a blind date
did the same, obviously. We were
getting a little cold standing out
there on the Y turn, Johnny and I.
Suddenly a courageous soul in a
blue Plymouth pulled up, and we
had our ride to Paly. We were
kinda nervous, not knowin' the
fella or nothin". He spoke first.
"Where y'a headed, boys?"
"Smith's, on the Circle, you know,"
piped Johnny, trying to sound nice
and friendly like.
"Nice place, Smith's," remarked
the driver.
From Smith's back, a queen
zoomed by in a Model A, two more
fraternity brothers waved as they
passed us, and finally a guy and his
gal slowed down, looked us over,
and decided to pick us and four
other ride-chasers up. Before we
knew it the driver let us out thir
teen blocks away from our destina
tion without a word.
We found that about one in every
five gave us rides—but never a lone
woman, or any other kind of a
woman for that matter. It was
always the men who stopped, talked,
and went out of their way to get
us where we wanted to go. Older
people, such as professors or visi
tors, didn't even slow down, but
that was to be expected.
As far as make of car goes, there
was no discrimination. Within one
hour, we had rides in a big Buick,
a Plymouth, and a couple of Fords.
However, from the rather small
amount of cars that went by, appar
ently some people don't go by the Y
turn. How come, we don't know.
(Just to check on how the old "Rides to Paly" tradition was holding
up since completion of the underpass, The Daily, on two separate after
noons last week, sent out two reporter teams: Beryl Robison and Claudia
Nettles; Bob Sontag and John liorrall. Most newsworthy finding is that
women DO NOT believe in the old tradition. The separate stories of each
team are printed below.—The Editor)

THE WOMEN SAY—
Two windblown girls stood in the
rain in front of Encina to test the
courtesy of the Stanford family and
to see if the old "rides to Paly" tra
dition was still alive. We felt rather
silly but encouraged ourselves by
saying that The Daily must have
facts and stepped forward.
First to pick us up were a boy and
girl from U.C.L.A. who said that
their campus had the same tradi
tion. We alighted in Paly, and
waited on Wilson's corner for a
ride back. As we were waiting, a
truckman hollered, "Rey girlies,
next time try horses." Very fu.my,
we murmured.
Mrs. Fagan, wife of Professor El
mer Fagan of the Economics De
partment, was the only woman who
stopped for us in our eight pick-ups.
Several Stanford girls whizzed by
without even looking; the majority
were driving new coupes—alone.
Needless to say, we were bitterly
disappointed in what we had always
considered the "better half" of the
Stanford family.
Several gray-haired couples in
Packards took no notice of us but
drove serenely on, enjoying the
scenery on Palm Drive.
In our four round trips, one out of
about every four cars stopped to
pick us up. Of the four that passed,
two were usually full. We arrived
back at the Daily shack slightly
windblown but happy to know that
chivalry is not yet dead and that a

(Just to check on how the old "Rides to Paly" tradition was holding
up since completion of the underpass, The Daily, on two separate after
noons last week, sent out two reporter teams: Beryl Robison and Claudia
Nettles; Bob Sontag and John liorrall. Most newsworthy finding is that
women DO NOT believe in the old tradition. The separate stories of each
team are printed below.—The Editor)

THE WOMEN SAY—
Two windblown girls stood in the
rain in front of Encina to test the
courtesy of the Stanford family and
to see if the old "rides to Paly" tra
dition was still alive. We felt rather
silly but encouraged ourselves by
saying that The Daily must have
facts and stepped forward.
First to pick us up were a boy and
girl from U.C.L.A. who said that
their campus had the same tradi
tion. We alighted in Paly, and
waited on Wilson's corner for a
ride back. As we were waiting, a
truckman hollered, "Rey girlies,
next time try horses." Very fu.my,
we murmured.
Mrs. Fagan, wife of Professor El
mer Fagan of the Economics De
partment, was the only woman who
stopped for us in our eight pick-ups.
Several Stanford girls whizzed by
without even looking; the majority
were driving new coupes—alone.
Needless to say, we were bitterly
disappointed in what we had always
considered the "better half" of the
Stanford family.
Several gray-haired couples in
Packards took no notice of us but
drove serenely on, enjoying the
scenery on Palm Drive.
In our four round trips, one out of
about every four cars stopped to
pick us up. Of the four that passed,
two were usually full. We arrived
back at the Daily shack slightly
windblown but happy to know that
chivalry is not yet dead and that a
great part of the Stanford family
who have cars are still friendly and
thoughtful enough to give rides to
the less fortunate members. It's a
swell tradition!

THE MEN SAY—
A Pi Phi roared by, naturally. A
fraternity brother with a blind date
did the same, obviously. We were
getting a little cold standing out
there on the Y turn, Johnny and I.
Suddenly a courageous soul in a
blue Plymouth pulled up, and we
had our ride to Paly. We were
kinda nervous, not knowin' the
fella or nothin". He spoke first.
"Where y'a headed, boys?"
"Smith's, on the Circle, you know,"
piped Johnny, trying to sound nice
and friendly like.
"Nice place, Smith's," remarked
the driver.
From Smith's back, a queen
zoomed by in a Model A, two more
fraternity brothers waved as they
passed us, and finally a guy and his
gal slowed down, looked us over,
and decided to pick us and four
other ride-chasers up. Before we
knew it the driver let us out thir
teen blocks away from our destina
tion without a word.
We found that about one in every
five gave us rides—but never a lone
woman, or any other kind of a
woman for that matter. It was
always the men who stopped, talked,
and went out of their way to get
us where we wanted to go. Older
people, such as professors or visi
tors, didn't even slow down, but
that was to be expected.
As far as make of car goes, there
was no discrimination. Within one
hour, we had rides in a big Buick,
a Plymouth, and a couple of Fords.
However, from the rather small
amount of cars that went by, appar
ently some people don't go by the Y
turn. How come, we don't know.
