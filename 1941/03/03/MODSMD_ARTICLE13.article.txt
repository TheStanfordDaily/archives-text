Dorothy Maynor, sensational negro

In the last two years since her
discovery by Koussevitzky, conduc
tor of the Boston Symphony Or
chestra, Miss Maynor has become
one of the most applauded singers in
the East. The versatility of her
range is remarkable and her tones
have the deep clear intonations
characteristic of her race.
She sings with ease in both
French and German. Her own ne
gro spirituals are very important to
her and her interpretations of them
are equally as stirring as her op
eratic arias. Her father was a
Methodist minister and Miss May
nor's first musical training was in
the choir of his church in Norfolk,
Virignia. She graduated from the
Hampton Institute when she was 14
and afterwards toured Europe as a
member of their famous negro
chorus.
