# Nazi Mechanized Forces Push to Greek Frontier
## Jugoslavia Seems Ready to Join Alliance to Escape 'Encirclement' 
### United Press 
German mechanized forces, sweeping across Nazi-occupied Bulgaria,
have reached the vicinity of the Greek frontier amid indications that Jugo
slavia is ready to join the Tri-powcr Alliance to escape "encirclement"
by the Axis.
The German forces were said to be preparing to enforce a "peace ulti-

matum" which AdoLf Hitler is re-,
ported to have served on the
Greeks. But authorized Nazi spokes
men in Berlin denied that "anything
resembling an ultimatum" had been
directed against Greece.
Jugoslavia, last of the Balkan
countries to cling to strict neutral-

ity in the struggle between Britain
and the Axis in southeastern Europe,
appeared to be drawing nearer a
decision as to her course in inter
national relations.
STOP AT DARDANELLES
Amid a flood of rumors streaming
out of Europe, there were reports
that Turkey had ordered all ships
passing through the Dardanelles to
identify themselves and pick up a
Turkish pilot.
Rumors circulated in Belgrade
that British planes had begun bomb
ing Rumania noil fields in the Ploesti
district, north of Bucharest, but
they were promptly denied in the
Rumanian capital where the Min
istry of Information described them
as wholly untrue.
In Berlin official statements said
that the German forces are rolling
into Bulgaria to "protect" the small
Balkan nation against Great Britain
and to defeat a British plot to "ex
tend the war" throughout south
western Europe.
SITUATION CHANGES
Jugoslav quarters said that the
Nazi occupation of Bulgaria has
created a "profound change" in the
Balkan situation involving the al
most certain finish of the Greek-
Italian wax\
If this occurs it will mean that
Jugoslavia would be left surrounded
by Axis countries or countries sol
idly drawn into the Axis orbit. This
situation, it was hinted, makes it
immediately necessary for Jugo
slavia to reconsider her entii'e policy
and probably adhere to the Axis.
