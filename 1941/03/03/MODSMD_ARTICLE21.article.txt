# CAGERS TAKE CAL SERIES
## Indian 49-36 Win Avenges Friday Loss Hoopster Off Form In First Encounter; Williams High Scorer 
### DON SELBY 
Those fighting Stanford cagers
have the stuff of which champions
are made.
Coach Everett Dean's Southern
Division title holders gave evidence
of that fact in no uncertain manner
Saturday night as they came back
after a 40-2!) Friday night defeat
that would have knocked the props
out from under an outfit with less
spunk to take a Rood California
quintet down the line, 49-36. The
win gave Stanford the Big Game
hoop series, three games to one.
During a dull first half the In
dians managed to keep within
shouting distance of the flying Bears,
but as the second canto got under
way the Cal quint, fighting for sec
ond spot in the league, moved away
with a flash of fast breaking that
left the Indians flat-footed. The half
time score was California 23, Stan
ford 18.
INDIANS OFF
The Indian first team played most
of the game but, when it became
evident in the second half that it
just wasn't their night, Coach Dean
tried out several other combinations,
none of which could stop the Cali
fornia drive.
Saturday night's game was a dif
ferent story altogether. With the
chips down—for Stanford had to win
the game to take the series—Wil
liams, Davidson & Co. played the
kind of basketball that put Stan
ford at the top of the southern divi
sion heap. The result was a contest
that was Cardinal from beginning
to end, Califoi-nia threatening semi
seriously only once—that with about
two minutes to go in the second
half.
DONNIE' LEADS
Saturday night was Donnie Wil
liams' night, as the slender Indian
forward and co-captain, playing his
last game against Cal, regained his
early season shooting form and
pumped through 17 points to take
high scoring honors. California's
Captain Johnny McGee was second
in the score column with 15 digits.
The game started out with both
teams playing very conservatively,
but once Williams popped the first
field goal, the Indians were on their
way. A pair of free throws put
California even with Stanford at
2-2, but Williams hit the hoop again
with a one-handed shot and the
score was never again close. Wil
liams and Burness tallied 16 of the
Cards' first-half total of 22, and at
the intermission Stanford led the
Bears by seven points.
SECOND HALF I LURRY
The second period found the In
dians even more superior, as their
offensive maneuvers against a set
defense sent men into the hole time
and time again for lay-in shots.
Fordy Andersons one-hand shot
from the side started the ball roll
ing in this half; and, while McGee
and Thurston Davis wore tallying a
mere two buckets, Burness and An
derson collected a field goal apiece,
Wililams chalked up two baskets
on fast breaks, and Anderson di*op
ped a charity toss to give Stanford a
14-point. ead.
With about 8 minutes to go in the
ball game, Jim Bailey, Davis, Irv
Hodes, and McGee, and then Bailey
again hit the hoop in that order and
