# Carter Says Chorus Easy To Organize
## Stanford Glee Club Nucleus of Singers In 'Bartered Bride' 
### 
The chorus for 'The Bartered
Bride," which will be given next
Friday and Saturday nights under
the auspices of the Stanford Players
and the Division of Music, has prov
en the easiest to organize and work
with of any opera chorus ever col
lected at Stanford, according to Joel
Carter, who is directing the singers.
The show is under the direction of
Herbert Jan Popper and F. Cowles
Strickland. It starts at 8:15 o'clock in
the Auditorium of Memorial Hall.
"The opera is proving a much
f;ster working production than
former musicals have been," Mr.
Carter said. "It is probably due to
the fact that many of the students
h;ive worked before in Stanford
musical shows."
Nucleus of the chorus was the
Stanford Glee Club and members of
the opera workshop group which is
being conducted by Dr. Herbert
Popper this quarter. Mr. Carter de
clared that this chorus is better bal
anced because' for once the men
have volunteered to sing.
"It isn't hard to get the women to
participate. They seem to get out for
musical activities," Mr. Carter said,
"but it is hard to get enough male
singers for a good-size chorus; that's
why musical activity has been quiet !
at Stanford for the last few years." j
However, Stanford is not the only J
organization which is having a hard I
time getting tenors and basses, for
the San Francisco opera is nearly
frantic seeking for male voices due
to the draft calling out many eli
gibles, according to Mr. Carter.
The chorus of 37 members for the
Czechoslovakian folk-opera is made
up of individual characters rather
than a mass production of singers
who all dress alike and do routines.
Even faculty members are taking
part, with Professor Bayard Q.
Moi'gan, Germanic languages head,
taking the part of the village police
man, and Philip McLean, Hoover
War librarian also singing in the '
chorus.
Those participating in the chorus
include Eugenia Beam, Claire
Burtchaell, Ray Clegg, Pauline
Deuel, Marietta Garfias, Vail Goss,
Barbara Graham, Lucille Grant,
Jean Holcomb, Marilou Heber, Vir
ginia Kerr, Nymphia Lam, Bernice
T inden. Man' Mitchel, Molly Poole,
l I?A lO cilia Reynolds.
Others are Audrey Salter, Dolores
Thornton, Margaret Tuttle, Caroline
Tyson. Mareeille Wicker, Marjory j
Winkler, Crowell Beech, John Ber
ger, Edward Carpenter, Cyclone |
Covey, Leif Frandsen, Robert Helli- \
well, John High, Philip McLean,

The chorus for 'The Bartered
Bride," which will be given next
Friday and Saturday nights under
the auspices of the Stanford Players
and the Division of Music, has prov
en the easiest to organize and work
with of any opera chorus ever col
lected at Stanford, according to Joel
Carter, who is directing the singers.
The show is under the direction of
Herbert Jan Popper and F. Cowles
Strickland. It starts at 8:15 o'clock in
the Auditorium of Memorial Hall.
"The opera is proving a much
f;ster working production than
former musicals have been," Mr.
Carter said. "It is probably due to
the fact that many of the students
h;ive worked before in Stanford
musical shows."
Nucleus of the chorus was the
Stanford Glee Club and members of
the opera workshop group which is
being conducted by Dr. Herbert
Popper this quarter. Mr. Carter de
clared that this chorus is better bal
anced because' for once the men
have volunteered to sing.
"It isn't hard to get the women to
participate. They seem to get out for
musical activities," Mr. Carter said,
"but it is hard to get enough male
singers for a good-size chorus; that's
why musical activity has been quiet !
at Stanford for the last few years." j
However, Stanford is not the only J
organization which is having a hard I
time getting tenors and basses, for
the San Francisco opera is nearly
frantic seeking for male voices due
to the draft calling out many eli
gibles, according to Mr. Carter.
The chorus of 37 members for the
Czechoslovakian folk-opera is made
up of individual characters rather
than a mass production of singers
who all dress alike and do routines.
Even faculty members are taking
part, with Professor Bayard Q.
Moi'gan, Germanic languages head,
taking the part of the village police
man, and Philip McLean, Hoover
War librarian also singing in the '
chorus.
