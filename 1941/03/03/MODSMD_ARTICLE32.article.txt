Laura Boulton was musicologist
and ethnologist on four scientific ex
peditions to Africa—the Straus Cen
tral African Expedition, Carnegie
South African Expedition, Pulitzer
Angola Expedition, and the Straus
West African Expedition; These ex
plorations were under the auspices
of the American Museum of Nat
ural History, the Carnegie Museum,
and the Field Museum of Natural
History.
Mrs. Boulton's research, financed
by grants from the Carnegie Corpo
ration and sponsored by the Univer
sity of Chicago, included numerous
tribes from Cairo to Capetown, from
Timbuktu to Mozambique. On all of
these expeditions she made records
of the primitive native rhythms and
songs.
In addition to records from four
African expeditions, Mrs. Boulton
has transcribed music on eight
islands of the West Indies. She
found remarkable survivals in the
voodoo music in Haiti and in the
chants of the rarely visited sur
rounding small islands. Mrs. Boulton
has also recorded 500 American In
dian melodies (including those of
Hopi, Navajo, and Winnebago tribes)
