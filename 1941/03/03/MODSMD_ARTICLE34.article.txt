# Group Lunch Held For Senior Women
## 
### 
A hundred senior women attended
the second informal buffet luncheon
held by the group this year in the
women's clubhouse Thursday.
The luncheon, an activity designed
to weld the women of the Class of
'41 closer as a group, was chair
manned by Ruthelen List. Julia
Johnson's arrangement committee
used spring flowers to carry out a
spring motif for the decorations.
