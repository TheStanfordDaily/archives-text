frequent heavy showers, Stanford's
powerful varsity rugby team took
ancther big step on its road to (he
championship of the Northern Cali
fornia Rugby Union when it de
feated (he University Club of San
Francisco fifteen by a lopsided 23-3
score.
The Indians avenged the only
black spot on their seasonal record,
an 11-11 tie at the hands of the
same team in the first game of the
current season. Leading from the
opening minute of play, the Cards
led 13-0 at the half and were never
in trouble throughout the game.
Stanfords first score came after
about a minute of play, when Co
captain Jake Thompson took the ball
over the Clubbers' line and fell on it
for a try after a long dribbling rush.
John Kermon made the conversion
to put Stanford into the lead at 5-0.
Shortly afterward, Thompson scored
again, adding another three points

STAN 1)1 j:k scores
The only other score during the
first 40-minute period was made by
Norm Standlee, who powered his
way across the line from about 30
yards out, bulling his way over
tackier after tackier, bringing the
score to 13-0, where it remained
when the gun ended the first half
with the ball in University Club
territory.
Stanford started out the second
period with a rush that again cul
minated in a long powerhouse run
by Standlee, this time for 40 yards,
the conversion by Carl Gerlach
bringing the score to 18-0.
A combination of several kicks
and rushes brought the ball to the
Indians' five-yard line, where a
scrum was called. The Clubmen
gained control of the ball and
Hockey carried it over for a try
and his team's only three points of
the contest.
FINAL TALLY
The final Card score came late in
the Inst half, when little A1 Cole
made a brilliant 30-yard run to
midfield and George Jedenoff went
the rest of the rest of the way to
paydirt. Gerlach again converted to
bring the final score to 23-3.
For almost the first time this sea
son there were no outstanding in
dividual stars on the team, as was
evidenced by the fact that the for
wards were handling the ball as
much as the backs in the first half.
Next week Stanford's varsity, re

the frosh meet Menlo Junior Col
