# Frosh Cagemen Cop Cal Series With 45-20 Win
## 
### 
Revenge was sweet for Stanford's
fresh basketball team Saturday
night as Jimmy Pollard rang up 21
points. leading his mates lo a 45-20
win ever Boh Herwig's California
fresh in a game played in the Stan
ford Pavilion. Friday night (lie
Papooses were stopped cold at Ber
keley, suffering a 3!)-31 setback as
Jack Mocker almost equalled Pol
lard's effort by tanking 20 for the
Blue and Gold.
Friday the Bear Cubs were on
their home court, which may have
accounted in a large way for the
Redshirts' first toss of the season.
The amazing Rocker shot from any
where on the court that night and
seemingly couldn't miss. The floor,
bigger than the Cardinals' home
roost, had the Stanford babes com
pletely baffled, but Saturday's en
counter was entirely different.
After the Cards built up a 19-13
lead at the half, Cal never had a
chance. Only once in the first period
did the Cubs look anything like the
club that defeated Stanford Friday
as Bob Dable tied up the score at
13-13. Six quick (allies put the Card
babes in front, and Cal didn't score
again until five minutes after the
second half had started.
Besides Pollard's shooting wiz
ardry, Fred Oliver found himself
Saturday and potted 10 points. It
was the first time "Ollie" was ever
given a real chance to prove his
worth, and the tall forward respond
ed with a great ball game.
