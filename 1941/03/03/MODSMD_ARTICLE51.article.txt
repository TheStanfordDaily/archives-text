STANFORD'S Honor Code received a touch
ing compliment over the week-end.
On the front page of today's Daily is a brief
story regarding a trip two men from a Southern

to discuss details of the system with student and
administration leaders.
Highly impressed with what they saw and
heard, they're hoping they can install a similar
system at their own institution, Whittier College.
It was a real compliment to a system which
Stanford men and women have honored for
twenty years.
It was proof that Stanford's code had ven
