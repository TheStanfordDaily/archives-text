# Those Bills Again
## 
### 
THE headline last Friday read "Students to Pay
Flat SlO Syllabus." But many students did
not read Dr. Wilbur's statement in full. When
that syllabus bill comes around about the middle
of next fall quarter, most students will find the
figure in the little box down in the corner
marked "total" will not read $10 but will read
Sl3.
This $3 fee in addition to the flat rate of $10
will be charged, in Dr. Wilbur's own words, "in
order to meet the constantly growing require
ments for Library administration and acquisi
tion."
Though a $13 syllabus fee bill will seem "as
big as a house" to many students whose bills
have in the past run around $5 or $6, it will
be compensated for by the great number of
science students who didn't even bat an eye
when the little white envelope came around
with a bill for $30.
Though both groups of students will look at
the picture with their former bills in mind, the
fact is the University will be taking in the same
amount as before at a greatly reduced operating
cost. ,
To be able to send out the same bill to prac
tically every student will save a large part of
the former cost of allocating and collecting sylla
bus fees and will, at least for the academic year
1941 42, make another general tuition increase
unnecessary.â€”C. B.
