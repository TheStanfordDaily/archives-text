(The Daily reprints below an editorial per
tinent to our present "national emergency"
writen by Allen Drury, former Bull Sessioner
and Associate Editor ot The Daily, now editor
ot the Tulare Bee.)
Out of the passionate debate in the Senate,
out of the bitter discussion in the public press
and on the public platform, there is beginning
to rise in the East—where, unfortunately, the
policies ot the nation must be decided by men
who evidently feel themselves to be some
three thousand miles closer to Hitler than they
actually are—a dangerous miasma of hate and
fear and hysteria which is rapidly blinding
America to the issue before her, destroying
her balance and her sanity and robbing her of
the calm and dispassionate realism she must
have if the task she has set herself is to be
completed successfully. The forms it takes
are many and varied, but the result is every
where the same: an increasing intolerance,
an increasing righteousness, an irresponsible
recklessness growing like fire on the wind
until it is already possible for Senators and
columnists to rise and state virtually without
challenge that they are "ready to go to war";
that they are "perfectly willing to send a mil
lion American boys to Europe it that's what
it takes to beat Hitler"; that they are anxious
and eager to rush the nation into a course of
action utterly foreign to the American pur
pose and the American destiny.
Is that all America sees in this war? Is that

the only purpose ot her effort? Is this all she
intends to achieve, this sorry sum ot more
dead, more maimed, more wasted? Will her
might and power never come to anything but
this? Can she never see a job straight and do
it whole and complete without getting lost
and blinded by her terrifying emotionalism?
Is this always to be the bitter fruit of her
endeavor? Are Flanders fields to be forever
the consummation of her crusades?
If so, then America is slain already, and by
her own hand. If she permits herself to be
come frantic with hysteria, there will come
from her no answer to the problems of the
world. No word or deed of hers will serve to
point mankind the way from darkness back
to light. If she too goes mad, who will be left
to restore sanity to the earth? .There will be
none.
Direct American participation in the con
flict has been repeatedly condemned by the
President, by the British, and by every re
sponsible leader in America, yet it is reveal
ing no secret to state that it is quite possible
that it will eventually occur. It is quite pos
sible that the only thing which can stop Hit
ler is a million American boys, and it is
quite possible that when they are needed,
they will be sent. It is further quite possible
that by the time the need for them comes,
America will be ready to see them go. But
she will be ready to see them go only if some
constructive purpose is to be gained from
their going. Unless their mission is used to
build a just and lasting peace America will
not be willing to see them go, and if they
are sent against her will, their sacrifice will
ultimately prove to be as pointless as that of
those who went before.
What the outcome of the war will be,
no one can say. But whatever it is, it cannot
be served by an America whipped into the
sort of wild-eyed frenzy too many Americans
are doing their best to create. The task of
the ages lies before us: a world must be re
built. Pray God America can keep her head,
for if she does not nothing will have been
achieved, and the future will hold only the
endless repetitions oi the past.
