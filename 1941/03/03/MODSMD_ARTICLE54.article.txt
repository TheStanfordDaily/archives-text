# BULL SESSION
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
A BLUE MONDAY
tomorrow's issue, page four of the Daily will
be blessed with a new column, "Quad-wrangle."
It's a good name and should work out very well.
The Editor was explaining the column to the ex-
Managing Editor and the Bull Sessioner a week or two
ago. He said it would be a general column open to
the staff at large. "They can comment on anything
they wish. You know, it'll be a sort of staff campus
opinion," Willie said.
To which Scoot replied, "That's swell, but who'll
write the regular campus opinions then?"
By this I do not mean to imply that Campus Opin
ion is written by the staff. No.
I can foresee some trouble with Quad-wrangle,
though. I mean personally. Now whenever anyone on
the staff has an idea for a column he'll write it instead
of telling me about it. I think that it may prove very
disturbing because ideas will not be bandied about
freely. They will only appear in print and until after
deadline time will be guarded with great care.
This will create an unhealthy atmosphere around
the Shack and will tend to encourage a furtive,
stealthy manner.

jpOUR members of the staff have been testing the
"rides to Paly" tradition. Instead of just watch
ing how the ride situation looked, objectively and from
a distance, they decided to employ research technique
and study the problem first hand.
So they stood at the prescribed places and l'ode
back and forth from campus to town. Back and forth
for a whole afternoon. At the end of the day they
decided that the percentage worked out about five
trips to the hour.
Who said the tradition is dead.
