HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Does Friendship, sacred to the Gods of old, pre
clude joint activity participation? Kindly recall that
last year's fabulously successful Ellington Prom was
managed by Grey Bryan, president MellinkofFs "best
friend." Perhaps what Friendship accomplished in the
past; it can repeat this year with the Senior Prom.
And, after all, aren't we all friends here on the farm
and look at the fun we have.

THOSE REVIEWS AGAIN

r rilE EDITOR. SIR:
For a while I had begun to think that The Daily
reviews had taken a turn for the better. Then that
"masterpiece of journalistic writing" appeared in the
paper a few days ago.
Why is it, Mr. Editor, that college reviewers feel
that in order to be literary they must deride things
that the majority acclaim? How this Douglass person
can pass off such a film classic as "Kitty Foyle" with a
few words about it being too clegn is more than I can
feature. Not a word is given to Ginger Rogers' mag
nificent performance as America's white collar girl;
the discovering of two promising male leads in the
persons of Dennis Morgan and James Craig is com
pletely overlooked; and Sam Wood's masterful (and
I do mean masterful) direction isn't even mentioned.
I read "Kitty Foyle." I thought it was an excel
lently written bunch of tripe. That Hollywood could
write a novel based on such a hackyneyed theme into
an excellent piece of entertainment is certainly a
credit to the "fair" city. It seems slightly ridiculous
for this Douglass to condemn a picture because the
Hays office has robbed it of the book's "precious" pro
fanity. One might as well condemn God for making
the world go round. It would be so much nicer if it
were standing still. But God and the Hays office are
both beyond our power.
What I'm trying to say is that it takes a pretty per
verted mind to condemn a picture because its charac
ters say "By Judas' priest" instead of "Jesusgod "; and
I hate perverted reviewers.
Respectfully,
R. K. W.

THOSE REVIEWS AGAIN

r rilE EDITOR. SIR:
For a while I had begun to think that The Daily
reviews had taken a turn for the better. Then that
"masterpiece of journalistic writing" appeared in the
paper a few days ago.
Why is it, Mr. Editor, that college reviewers feel
that in order to be literary they must deride things
that the majority acclaim? How this Douglass person
can pass off such a film classic as "Kitty Foyle" with a
few words about it being too clegn is more than I can
feature. Not a word is given to Ginger Rogers' mag
nificent performance as America's white collar girl;
the discovering of two promising male leads in the
persons of Dennis Morgan and James Craig is com
pletely overlooked; and Sam Wood's masterful (and
I do mean masterful) direction isn't even mentioned.
I read "Kitty Foyle." I thought it was an excel
lently written bunch of tripe. That Hollywood could
write a novel based on such a hackyneyed theme into
an excellent piece of entertainment is certainly a
credit to the "fair" city. It seems slightly ridiculous
for this Douglass to condemn a picture because the
Hays office has robbed it of the book's "precious" pro
fanity. One might as well condemn God for making
the world go round. It would be so much nicer if it
were standing still. But God and the Hays office are
both beyond our power.
What I'm trying to say is that it takes a pretty per
verted mind to condemn a picture because its charac
ters say "By Judas' priest" instead of "Jesusgod "; and
I hate perverted reviewers.
Respectfully,
R. K. W.
PRAYER TO FRIENDSHIP

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Does Friendship, sacred to the Gods of old, pre
clude joint activity participation? Kindly recall that
last year's fabulously successful Ellington Prom was
managed by Grey Bryan, president MellinkofFs "best
friend." Perhaps what Friendship accomplished in the
past; it can repeat this year with the Senior Prom.
And, after all, aren't we all friends here on the farm
and look at the fun we have.
