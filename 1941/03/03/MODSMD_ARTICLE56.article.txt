# "Male Animal" Turns Out Bewildering But Funny
## 
### 
"The Male Animal," by James Thur
ber and Hlliott Nugent, presented
by Rum's Head Dramatic Society.
This, the second effort in Ram's
Head's attempt to popularize play
readings, demonstrates again that
drama can be effectively interpreted
without the aid of stage business
and scenery. Not that readings can
hope to equal full theatrical presen
tation in color and interest, but they
do serve as an admirable substitute.
Both the players and the audience
seemed to get a lot of fun out of
"The Male Animal" Friday night.
The play doesn't amount to much;
the presentation was, however, ex
cellent; and on the whole it was
all one could ask in the way of an
amusing evening.
Now for the play. That it was
funny goes without saying. It's also
very muddled. If it hadn't been
written by Thurber, this would
be quite annoying. But somehow
Thurber can get away with it, and
you find yourself enjoying its
slightly bewildered air in spite of
yourself.
The playwrights were trying to
put a message across—a plea for the
protection of free speech against
well-meaning persons who trample
on liberty in their effort to sup
press subversive doctrines. But the
message gets tangled up in the do
mestic problems of a young profes
sor and his wife, and everyone soon
loses interest in the more intangible
issue.

I By the middle of the second act,
just as the audience has settled
down to a struggle between the pro
fessor and the board of trustees over
a letter which he wants to read to
his class, the whole thing goes skip
ping madly of! on a tangent.
From there on In it's a lopsided
triangle situation—with the profes
sor, his pretty wife, and her former
boy friend sitting uncertainly at the
corners.
The cast did an admirable job of
keeping in hand their bewildering
stew of political liberties, wile-tam
ing, and college atmosphere.
Pat Allen was charming as the
wife; Ted Ma reuse made the be
fuddled professor sympathetic and
credible; and John High gave a
neatly finished characterization of
the unscrupulous dean.
The whole thing was done with
spirit and an honest effort to put on
a good show. It's too bad more of
the campus wasn't there to enjoy
the fun.
