# New Sign Replaces University Landmark
## 
### 
One of the oldest landmarks on
the campus was the battered wooden
sign in front of the University Press
office. Thursday that sign was down
and a new copper-plated sign was
in its place. The old sign was
weather-beaten and the letters were
carved on the wood, but it had seen
many generations of the Stanford
family come and go. The new sign
is shiny and the letters are in
white metal, it almost looks like a
ireshman who doesn't exactly un
derstand the campus yet. However,
in spite of sentiment, progress must
continue. The battered old sign had
outworn its usefulness.
