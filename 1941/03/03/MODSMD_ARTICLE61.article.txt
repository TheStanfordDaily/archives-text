# Rain Discourages Bathers, Boaters
## 
### 
Although there were only a few
boats out yesterday because of the
cloudy skies and rainy weather,
Lake Lagunita has seen a steady
dribble of boaters and bathers since
the season officially opened two
weeks ago.
A record crowd showed up a week
ago Saturday afternoon to make one
of the biggest days in the history of
the new Boathouse. At one time all
of the boats, 35 in all, were in the
water, while the warm weather
brought out large crowds of swim
mers and sunbathers.
The weather of the past week-end
made a different story, however, and
at no time were there more than 20
boats in the water, while the swim
mers were confined to eight or ten
girls and two lone boys.
