SAN FRANCISCO, March 2 (UP).
â€”A German seaman from the scut
tled liner Columbus disappeared
from Angel Island immigration sta
tion a week ago while on "shore
leave," it was disclosed today.
As a result immigration authori
ties have canceled all leaves for the
remaining men, approximately 300
Germans, who have been awaiting
transfer to a new "detention" camp
in New Mexico.
The Germans, who have been
held at Angel Island as bonded pay
ing guests of the federal govern
ment, had been granted leaves to
San Francisco under a "gentlemen's
agreement" whereby they promised
to return to the island.
