# History ... 1941

r jpHE Russians are a melancholy
race, but nobody seems to mind.
This is probably because the world
has gotten used to Slavic emotional
acrobatics. But silent Russians are
another thing . . . and the Russians,
with their newly-acquired taste for
quiet, have just about driven the
world crazy.
Since the first faint odor from
the bubbling Balkans began to
waft across Europe, all ears have
been glued to the Kremlin's key
hole. But not so much as a
"nichevo" came out of the IJ. S.
S. It. until yesterday.
Josef Stalin has finally gotten
around to saying something. It
wasn't much, but it was something
the men-who-find-hidden-meaning.s
can get their teeth into. As a mat
ter of fact, if Stalin nad only said
"fine day" to some diplomat or cor
respondent, it would have made
banner-lines in the world press and
been "interpreted" to shreds.

|>USSIA broke its statement strike
with a melancholy note to Bul
garia protesting the latter's com
plete capitulation to occupation by
the German army.
It warned unhappily that with
the German army sweeping across
Bulgaria and up to both the Turk
ish and Greek frontiers, war
threatens to explode in the Balkans
close to Russia's own vital in
terests.
And it wound up with the mourn
ful remark that Russia refuses to
give "any support" to the Sofia gov
ernment's new Nazi-dictated policy,
and washes its hands of the fate of
the little nation which has always
looked to Moscow for protection.

r British beamed when they
read the contents of the com
munication, and hailed it as a start
ling about-face in Josef Stalin's pol
icy of extreme caution. Some went
so far as to call it the most im
portant Soviet development since
the shattering Nazi-Russian pact of
August 1939.
Peering at the note through
rose-colored glasses and brushing
wisps of silver-lined clouds out of
its hair, London chose to believe
that the Soviets have "denounced"
Germany's policy in the Balkans.
However, the note could mean that
Russia, feeling herself too weak to
challenge the Fuehrer's presaged
Balkan thrust, is simply putting
himself "on record." Perhaps this is
just to let the rest of the Balkans
know that, in their future dicker
ings and bickerings, they can ex
pect no help from the Red Army.

vital point did appear in the
Soviet note. Turkey, with
German mechanized troops and
tanks already on her Thracian front
only 100 miles from the Dardanelles,
is perilously close to war against
Germany, and the Russians, always
the Turks' chief guide and council,
will not try to restrain Turkey from
entering the battle ... if and when.
Meanwhile George Rcndcl, Brit
ish Minister to Bulgarian and vir
tually the only Englishman left" in
Sofia, wandered around the de
serted British legation, while the
Bulgars bit their nails. Accord
ing to the reports he may not de
liver that little note breaking off
diplomatic relations between Bul
garia and England today, hut he
certainly will tomorrow. The Bul
garian government is frantically
taking the steps necessary to get
Sofia declared an "open city" and
so save it from R.A.F. attack.
A wonderful little item came out
of Berlin last night. An authorized
spokesman said that any British
declaration of war on Bulgaria re
sulting from the presence of Nazi
troops there would be a "gross
breach of international law."
To that crack the Russians would
probably say "Nichevo" or some
thing. History is speechless.
