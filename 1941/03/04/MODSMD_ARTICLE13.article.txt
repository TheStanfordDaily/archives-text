# Weather Hinders Repair on Streets
## 
### 
Reconstruction and repiars to
Lomita Drive have been seriously
handicapped by the rainy weather.
The repairs to the road should have
been completed some time ago, but
the rain has held up progress of
the job.
Repairs to aSnta Teresa have been
going on as fast as the weather per
mitted. Widening of the area around
the post office will begin as soon as
sufficient funds are available and
the rain stops.
