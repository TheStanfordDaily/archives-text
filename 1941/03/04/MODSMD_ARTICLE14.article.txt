# Adventurous Frosh Tell Story of Police Beating
## 
### 
(From their room in the Stanford Hospital, this personal account of
their visit to the slum areas of San Francisco Saturday night, their arrest,
and their alleged beating at the hands of city policemen was related by
Freshmen Carter Barber and Don Allan. Their story was transcribed
from shorthand by Roseniarie Mullany.—Editor's Note.)

We went up just to see how
are takin' the hard knocks and how
they're livin'. You see we've been
having big discussions at Encina
about government and politics and
their sociological affects. We just
wanted to talk to those guys and !
get their slant on life.
TRAVELED INCOGNITO

We got to the City about 10 o'clock
at night. We were dressed up real
trampish and carried no identifica
tion. We started out around the
waterfront and we talked to people
there for a while. We ran into the
Salvation Army and were going to
sing hymns for coffee and sand
wiches, but they were having some
kind of costume shindig in there so
they couldn't use us. Some guy was
telling us about a mission over on
Mission Street and that's where we
were bound when we were picked
up at Third and Howard Streets.
M.P.'s were patrolling the district
'cause it's restricted for the army
and we saw a bunch of army men
thrown out. Anyhow, we were
picked up with a bunch of other
vagrants and booked, questioned
and searched at some substation.
LUNATIC IN CELL
Everything was rosy when wc
were thrown into the substation, be
cause an hour or so there just fitted
right in.
They put us in a cell, a fairly
small one. The only other occupant
was a lunatic who kept rolling
imaginary cigarettes which he pre
tended to light. We thought he was
going to burn his moustache. He
said his name was Harmless. He
shouldn't have been in jail; he
should have been in a hospital.
They took Carter out for question
ing first. As he was starting to put
on his coat they clipped him and
spun him around and then smacked
him down. They clipped him in the
stomach with a shillelagh and then
got him In the leg. While this was
goin' on they were saying, "Whad
dya say, whaddya say, now?" He
didn't say a word and I think that
made 'em mad.
Then they brought me (Allan) out
and smacked me across the nose,
then in the stomach and shins. This
was after I had asked which way I
should go coming out of the cell, and
as they were hitting me they kept
saying, "Where do you wanta go
now?"
After that we were taken to the
City Prison. They put us in the
"drunk tank." Have a feeling that's
what it was, anyway. It was really
crowded in there. There were a
lotta wrecks, sick people, people lay
ing senseless on the floor. They came
and offered us bread and coffee
which was worse than the Union's.
Don't see why they beat us up.
Maybe our attitude wasn't quite as
humble as it might have been. We
wei-en't, however, provoking them.
We don't care about getting any
thing for ourselves out of this. We
only want to call the situation to
the attention of the authorities. The
only thing to be gained is the raising
of public sentiment. Maybe people
will see that things aren't so rosy
down there.

Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur has pub
lished, aside from innumerable ar
ticles and monographs, three books
which have been recognized as out
standing in their field.

We went up just to see how
are takin' the hard knocks and how
they're livin'. You see we've been
having big discussions at Encina
about government and politics and
their sociological affects. We just
wanted to talk to those guys and !
get their slant on life.
TRAVELED INCOGNITO

We got to the City about 10 o'clock
at night. We were dressed up real
trampish and carried no identifica
tion. We started out around the
waterfront and we talked to people
there for a while. We ran into the
Salvation Army and were going to
sing hymns for coffee and sand
wiches, but they were having some
kind of costume shindig in there so
they couldn't use us. Some guy was
telling us about a mission over on
Mission Street and that's where we
were bound when we were picked
up at Third and Howard Streets.
M.P.'s were patrolling the district
'cause it's restricted for the army
and we saw a bunch of army men
thrown out. Anyhow, we were
picked up with a bunch of other
vagrants and booked, questioned
and searched at some substation.
LUNATIC IN CELL
Everything was rosy when wc
were thrown into the substation, be
cause an hour or so there just fitted
right in.
They put us in a cell, a fairly
small one. The only other occupant
was a lunatic who kept rolling
imaginary cigarettes which he pre
tended to light. We thought he was
going to burn his moustache. He
said his name was Harmless. He
shouldn't have been in jail; he
should have been in a hospital.
They took Carter out for question
ing first. As he was starting to put
on his coat they clipped him and
spun him around and then smacked
him down. They clipped him in the
stomach with a shillelagh and then
got him In the leg. While this was
goin' on they were saying, "Whad
dya say, whaddya say, now?" He
didn't say a word and I think that
made 'em mad.
Then they brought me (Allan) out
and smacked me across the nose,
then in the stomach and shins. This
was after I had asked which way I
should go coming out of the cell, and
as they were hitting me they kept
saying, "Where do you wanta go
now?"
After that we were taken to the
City Prison. They put us in the
"drunk tank." Have a feeling that's
what it was, anyway. It was really

spun him around and then smacked
him down. They clipped him in the
stomach with a shillelagh and then
got him In the leg. While this was
goin' on they were saying, "Whad
dya say, whaddya say, now?" He
didn't say a word and I think that
made 'em mad.
Then they brought me (Allan) out
and smacked me across the nose,
then in the stomach and shins. This
was after I had asked which way I
should go coming out of the cell, and
as they were hitting me they kept
saying, "Where do you wanta go
now?"
After that we were taken to the
City Prison. They put us in the
"drunk tank." Have a feeling that's
what it was, anyway. It was really
crowded in there. There were a
lotta wrecks, sick people, people lay
ing senseless on the floor. They came
and offered us bread and coffee
which was worse than the Union's.
Don't see why they beat us up.
Maybe our attitude wasn't quite as
humble as it might have been. We
wei-en't, however, provoking them.
We don't care about getting any
thing for ourselves out of this. We
only want to call the situation to
the attention of the authorities. The
only thing to be gained is the raising
of public sentiment. Maybe people
will see that things aren't so rosy
down there.
