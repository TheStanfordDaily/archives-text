# "LEGALIZED BRUTALITY"
## 
### 
If charges brought yesterday by two Stanford freshmen are
true, San Francisco's police force deserves the biggest shake-up
that Chief of Police Dullea, Mayor Rossi and public opinion can
effect.
If the "legalized brutality" that these two 18-year-old boys
describe is actually a part of the San Francisco police system,
then that system is rotten to the core.
If the city of San Francisco is genuinely interested in the
problem of their "Dead-end Kids," they must first eliminate any
police system that would only succeed in making "cop-haters"
out of these youngsters from the "other side of Market Street."
If Stanford students and the administration are interested in
nghting a wrong done to two freshman members, they will
bring all possible pressure to bear upon the authorities and the
system which may have been at fault. I would like to see 4,000
Stanford students send 4,000 letters to Mayor Rossi demanding
that a thorough investigation of this instance in particular and
the system in general be made.
It goes much deeper than a reported injustice done to two of
our fellows. It seemingly indicates a San Francisco police force
in which the man with a badge assumes the responsibilities of a
judge and an executionerâ€”as well as those which are legally
his own.
Regardless of what else is done, San Francisco should demand
a sweeping investigation of the incident and the system. And
should such an investigation verify the charges of the two
Stanford freshmen the system must be white-washed in and out.
Commendable steps recently have been taken by the city in
clearing up the troubled waters created by San Francisco "Dead
end Kids." Are these youngsters being "educated" by the sys
tem which Stanford's freshmen described?
It would make me a cop-hater.
