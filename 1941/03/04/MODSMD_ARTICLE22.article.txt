Quad-trotters will just have to
improve their traction.
So said the Corporation Yard in
response to a plea thai coarse
sand he scattered near the Ro
manic languages classrooms, the
section of walk near the
Steps, and the wooden stairs lead
ing from Lomita Drive to the Gc
ology Corner.
Several students sponsored the
request, saying that the driving
rain and the mud tracked in from
the roads rendered a last-minute
dash to class in hard-ruhber soles
a spectacle and a hazard.
But the yard spokesman said:
"We can't scatter sand around.
The kids will just have to improve
their traction."
