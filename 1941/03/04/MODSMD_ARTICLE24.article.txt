# FROSH CLAIM S.F. POLICE BEATING
## Tour of City Lands Pair In Hospital Allan, Barber Offer To Identify Assailant From Police Force 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
"We can pick the man that
slugged us out of a line-up of 12
policemen," two Stanford freshmen
claimed yesterday in the Palo Alto
Hospital after asserting that they
were beaten "without provocation"
when booked for vagrancy by San
Francisco police early Sunday morn
ing.
Carter Barber, 18, Winnetka, 111.,
and Don Allan, 18, Woodside, who
told The Daily in an interview yes
terday they were slumming on "skid
row" as a "sociological experiment"
Saturday night, both were in the
campus hospital yesterday with ex
tensive injuries, which they claimed
resulted from the beating.
OFFICER DENIES STOKY
Officer John J. Desmond denied
the boys' story that they were as
saulted by police at San Francisco's
Southern Station, where the pair
asserted it had occurred.
The youths told Captain Arthur
L. Christiansen yesterday that the
only possible provocation for the
slugging was their statement when
picked up, "Take a good look at us."
He said they carried two lemons and
a paperweight inside a man's sock.
The students claimed it was "for
protection."
Hospital authorities would re
lease no report on their injuries, but
Allan claimed he suffered a broken
nose, hemorrhage of a leg blood ves
sel, cracked rib and a black eye.
DESCRIBE EXPERIENCES
Barber said his injuries included
a fractured nose, cracked cheek
bone, chipped tooth, black eye and
numerous minor abrasions.
They said they had been in San
Francisco Saturday evening and vis
ited the waterfront, the Salvation
Army where they wanted to sing
for food but were turned down, and
were on their way to Mission Street
when picked up at Third and How
ard streets. The section they visited
included the army restricted area,
patrolled by M.P.'s, they asserted.
FROSII TELL STORY
Captain Christiansen and Frank
Jones, police stenographer, ques
tioned the frosh for more than three
hours yesterday afternoon in their
hospital room, in the presence of
John Baldwin, Allan's step-father,
and Hubert Wyckoff, law partners.
Captain Christiansen and Jones later
conferred with Dean of Men John
Bunn who confirmed the "high
character" of the Stanford pair.
Captain Christiansen said the two
"would not be available" for a week
to attempt identification of their
asserted assailant.
"If there is any evidence these
boys were beaten by police the
guilty officers will stand trial before
the Police Commission," San Fran
cisco Chief of Police Charles Dul
lea said yesterday after dispatching
Captain Christiansen to the Stan
ford campus.
ARRESTED AS VAGRANTS
Sergeant Thomas Flanagan and
Officer Joseph H. Green reported
they arrested the youths under the
impression they were vagrants.
They denied striking the boys, ac
cording to United Press. "We called
a patrol and sent the youths to the
Southern Station," Flanagan said.
"We didn't accompany them." The
them up were not the ones they
boys admit the men who picked
claim beat them. The Encinamen
expressed the belief that what they
claim was a police beating is "rou
tine treatment."
They said they received no medi
cal treatment for over four hours
after their asserted beating, and
that they were not ministered to
until after their release.
When booked at the sub-station
and later at the City Prison, Carter
gave his name as Joseph R. Smith,
19, and said he had keen living
"around San Jose."
RIDE IN BLACK MARIA'
They claimed they were beaten in
the substation, then packed into a
crowded "black Maria," taken to
the prison and thrust into the
"drunk tank." They said there were
no benches and just rubber mats on
the floor. "You couldn't sleep be
cause guys would step in your face,
it was so crowded," Allan said.
"There were human wrecks all
over the place, fights, and drunks
sprawled on the floor," he added.
He stated a lunatic, who called him
self Harmless, "kept wandering
around" trying to light imaginary
cigarettes and nearly .burning his
mustache. "He should have been
in a hospital instead of the jail,"
Barber observed.
RELEASED ON BAIL
When Mr. Baldwin appeared to
bail the youths out, Allan said he
offered his pack of cigarettes to
"Harmless." "Fifteen great arms
were thrust forward to snatch it
away," he said.
When booked, they had $6 be
tween them, they said, and it was
refunded after they were released
on bail.
The Stanford men yesterday told
The Daily they hope to "bring con
ditions to light, gain public senti
ment, and call the attention of the
proper authorities."

RIDE IN BLACK MARIA'
They claimed they were beaten in
the substation, then packed into a
crowded "black Maria," taken to
the prison and thrust into the
"drunk tank." They said there were
no benches and just rubber mats on
the floor. "You couldn't sleep be
cause guys would step in your face,
it was so crowded," Allan said.
"There were human wrecks all
over the place, fights, and drunks
sprawled on the floor," he added.
He stated a lunatic, who called him
self Harmless, "kept wandering
around" trying to light imaginary
cigarettes and nearly .burning his
mustache. "He should have been
in a hospital instead of the jail,"
Barber observed.
RELEASED ON BAIL
When Mr. Baldwin appeared to
bail the youths out, Allan said he
offered his pack of cigarettes to
"Harmless." "Fifteen great arms
were thrust forward to snatch it
away," he said.
When booked, they had $6 be
tween them, they said, and it was
refunded after they were released
on bail.
The Stanford men yesterday told
The Daily they hope to "bring con
ditions to light, gain public senti
ment, and call the attention of the
proper authorities."
"We can pick the man that
slugged us out of a line-up of 12
policemen," two Stanford freshmen
claimed yesterday in the Palo Alto
Hospital after asserting that they
were beaten "without provocation"
when booked for vagrancy by San
Francisco police early Sunday morn
ing.
Carter Barber, 18, Winnetka, 111.,
and Don Allan, 18, Woodside, who
told The Daily in an interview yes
terday they were slumming on "skid
row" as a "sociological experiment"
Saturday night, both were in the
campus hospital yesterday with ex
tensive injuries, which they claimed
resulted from the beating.
OFFICER DENIES STOKY
Officer John J. Desmond denied
the boys' story that they were as
saulted by police at San Francisco's
Southern Station, where the pair
asserted it had occurred.
The youths told Captain Arthur
L. Christiansen yesterday that the
only possible provocation for the
slugging was their statement when
picked up, "Take a good look at us."
He said they carried two lemons and
a paperweight inside a man's sock.
The students claimed it was "for
protection."
Hospital authorities would re
lease no report on their injuries, but
Allan claimed he suffered a broken
nose, hemorrhage of a leg blood ves
sel, cracked rib and a black eye.
DESCRIBE EXPERIENCES
Barber said his injuries included
a fractured nose, cracked cheek
bone, chipped tooth, black eye and
numerous minor abrasions.
They said they had been in San
Francisco Saturday evening and vis
ited the waterfront, the Salvation
Army where they wanted to sing
for food but were turned down, and
were on their way to Mission Street
when picked up at Third and How
ard streets. The section they visited
included the army restricted area,
patrolled by M.P.'s, they asserted.
FROSII TELL STORY
Captain Christiansen and Frank
Jones, police stenographer, ques

hours yesterday afternoon in their
hospital room, in the presence of
John Baldwin, Allan's step-father,
and Hubert Wyckoff, law partners.
Captain Christiansen and Jones later
conferred with Dean of Men John
Bunn who confirmed the "high
character" of the Stanford pair.
Captain Christiansen said the two
"would not be available" for a week
to attempt identification of their
asserted assailant.
"If there is any evidence these
boys were beaten by police the
guilty officers will stand trial before
the Police Commission," San Fran
cisco Chief of Police Charles Dul
lea said yesterday after dispatching
Captain Christiansen to the Stan
ford campus.
ARRESTED AS VAGRANTS
Sergeant Thomas Flanagan and

They denied striking the boys, ac

Southern Station," Flanagan said.

them up were not the ones they

Barber observed.
RELEASED ON BAIL

"We can pick the man that
slugged us out of a line-up of 12
policemen," two Stanford freshmen

told The Daily in an interview yes
terday they were slumming on "skid
row" as a "sociological experiment"
Saturday night, both were in the

resulted from the beating.
OFFICER DENIES STOKY
Officer John J. Desmond denied
the boys' story that they were as
saulted by police at San Francisco's
Southern Station, where the pair
asserted it had occurred.
The youths told Captain Arthur

only possible provocation for the
slugging was their statement when
picked up, "Take a good look at us."
He said they carried two lemons and
a paperweight inside a man's sock.
The students claimed it was "for
protection."
Hospital authorities would re
lease no report on their injuries, but
Allan claimed he suffered a broken

a fractured nose, cracked cheek

for food but were turned down, and
were on their way to Mission Street

Captain Christiansen said the two
"would not be available" for a week

Captain Christiansen to the Stan
ford campus.
