### HAROLD SHAFER 
"We can pick the man that
slugged us out of a line-up of 12
policemen," two Stanford freshmen
claimed yesterday in the Palo Alto
Hospital after asserting that they
were beaten "without provocation"
when booked for vagrancy by San
Francisco police early Sunday morn
ing.
Carter Barber, 18, Winnetka, 111.,
and Don Allan, 18, Woodside, who
told The Daily in an interview yes
terday they were slumming on "skid
row" as a "sociological experiment"
Saturday night, both were in the
campus hospital yesterday with ex
tensive injuries, which they claimed
resulted from the beating.
OFFICER DENIES STOKY
Officer John J. Desmond denied
the boys' story that they were as
saulted by police at San Francisco's
Southern Station, where the pair
asserted it had occurred.
The youths told Captain Arthur
L. Christiansen yesterday that the
only possible provocation for the
slugging was their statement when
picked up, "Take a good look at us."
He said they carried two lemons and
a paperweight inside a man's sock.
The students claimed it was "for
protection."
Hospital authorities would re
lease no report on their injuries, but
Allan claimed he suffered a broken
nose, hemorrhage of a leg blood ves
sel, cracked rib and a black eye.
DESCRIBE EXPERIENCES
Barber said his injuries included
a fractured nose, cracked cheek
bone, chipped tooth, black eye and
numerous minor abrasions.
They said they had been in San
Francisco Saturday evening and vis
ited the waterfront, the Salvation
Army where they wanted to sing
for food but were turned down, and
were on their way to Mission Street
when picked up at Third and How
ard streets. The section they visited
included the army restricted area,
patrolled by M.P.'s, they asserted.
FROSII TELL STORY
Captain Christiansen and Frank
Jones, police stenographer, ques
tioned the frosh for more than three
hours yesterday afternoon in their
hospital room, in the presence of
John Baldwin, Allan's step-father,
and Hubert Wyckoff, law partners.
Captain Christiansen and Jones later
conferred with Dean of Men John
Bunn who confirmed the "high
character" of the Stanford pair.
Captain Christiansen said the two
"would not be available" for a week
to attempt identification of their
asserted assailant.
"If there is any evidence these
boys were beaten by police the
guilty officers will stand trial before
the Police Commission," San Fran
cisco Chief of Police Charles Dul
lea said yesterday after dispatching
Captain Christiansen to the Stan
ford campus.
ARRESTED AS VAGRANTS
Sergeant Thomas Flanagan and
Officer Joseph H. Green reported
they arrested the youths under the
impression they were vagrants.
They denied striking the boys, ac
cording to United Press. "We called
a patrol and sent the youths to the
Southern Station," Flanagan said.
"We didn't accompany them." The
