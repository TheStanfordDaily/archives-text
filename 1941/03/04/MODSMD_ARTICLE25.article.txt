Noll Plopper, ex-chairman of
Women's Council, snow-shoed mad

day afternoon, coached by Miss
Elizabeth Crandall, Lagunita direc
tor, on whose "rackets" she was
breaking the sabbath calm of the
hall.
Nell's experiment was the result
of a discussion of the Grenfell Lab
rador handicrafts, which will be dis
played at the Women's Clubhouse
on Friday, from 10 to G o'clock. Miss
Crandall, who once spent 13 months
in Labrador as an industrial arts
teacher with the Grenfell Mission,
i;; assisting with the campus sale of
the products.
SALES SUPPORT MISSION
The proceeds from the sale of
these near-arctic products, mittens,
dickies (fur-edged parkas), carved
walrus ivory figurines, and skin
boots, are used to support the Lab
rador Industries, a supplementary
activity of the Grenfell International
Medical Mission.
When the late Sir Wilfred Gren
fell first visited Labrador in 1892,
sickness and privation were wide
spread on that lonely and little
known coast. Dr. Grenfell's work
there as a physician, which is now
well known as a result of his books
and lectures, was the first step in
the establishment of the Grenfell
Medical Mission which today carries
on its work on the coast of New
foundland and Labrador through
hospitals, nursing stations, indus
trial centers, orphanages, and
workers.
GRADUATES VOLUNTEER
Each summer the Grenfell people
accept the applications of a number
of college graduates for places as
volunteer workers with the mission.
Usually the volunteers are from the
eastern universities, Princeton, Har
vard, Dartmouth, and Wellesley be
ing among those represented. Miss
Crandall went to Labrador as a
Grenfell worker upon her gradua
tion from Western Reserve Uni
versity.
Never before have these New
foundland and Labrador products
been shown on the West Coast, but
because of war-closed markets in
Canada and England, the New York
offices of the Mission this year are
sending handicraft work through
out the country.
