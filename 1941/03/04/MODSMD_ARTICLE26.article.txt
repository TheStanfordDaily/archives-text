The Dean of Men's office yester
day again reminded students grad
uating at the end of Winter Quar
ter that they must, within five days
of graduation, notify their local
draft board of this fact so that their
classification may be officially
changed on the record.
Failure to comply with the rules
of the Selective Service Act is a
federal offense and punishable by
both fine and imprisonment. The
Dean's office stated that any other
change in a student's status affecting
his classification must be reported
