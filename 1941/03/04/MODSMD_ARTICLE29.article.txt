# Card Skiers Win And Then Againâ€”
## 
### 
According to the scoring system
of the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
Ski Union, Stanford won Friday's
meet at Yosemite. But by the Pa
cific Coast Conference ruling, Stan
ford placed third.
The slalom was the only event
completed, in which Bob Blatt, one
of the nation's top ten skiers and
Stanford freshman, took first place.
The cross country event was held
in a driving snow storm. Ninety
participants started and only 20 fin
ished, the rest being lost. Conse
quently the race was cancelled. If
the race had been completed and
the results made official, Blatt
would have established a record for
the event.
The downhill race and jumps
were scheduled for Sunday but
were cancelled.
