# Soviet Union Refuses Aid To Bulgaria
## U.S.S.R. Challenges Invasion of Balkans By German Troops 
### 
MOSCOW. March I! (UP).â€”Soviet
Russia today informed Bulgaria in
a formal note that Germany's mili
tary occupation of the Balkan na
tion threatens "extension of the
war" and that Russia refuses to give
support of any kind to Bulgaria's
new Axis-dominated policy.
Russia's strong statement, break
ing an enigmatic silence on the part
of the Kremlin toward the Balkan
crisis, was handed to Bulgarian Min
ister Ivan Stamenoff by Soviet
Vice-Commissar of Foreign Affairs
A. V. Vyshinsky.
(British quarters in London re
garded Russia's strongly-worded
note to Bulgaria early today as a
distinct Soviet "challenge" to
Germany's sweep across the Bal
kans and an implied warning
against any Nazi attack on Tur
key.)
The note carried strong criticism
of Bulgaria for agreeing to the Ger
man-armed occupation in what the
Soviet government called a mistaken
belief that the Balkans, and Bulgaria
herself, would be spared the horrors
of war.
(This Soviet assertion was in con
tradiction of Germany's official ex
planation of the occupation which,
according to Berlin, was undertaken
as "protection against British moves
in southeastern Europe.")
