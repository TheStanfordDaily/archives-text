Gay and colorful peasant cos
tumes, in keeping with the theme of
"The Bartered Bride," will deck the
cast members of the Smetana folk
opera to be given in Memorial Hall
Friday and Saturday nights.
A large cast of dancei'S and sing
ers will stamp and sway through
the catchy polka tunes arrayed in
billowing skirts and gaily embroi
dered leder-hosen. Little threef
cornered caps with big bows and
white boots will adorn the peasant
maids, while the men will carry off
the gay wool socks and flower
decked hats in true Czech style.
All the costumes are designed on
authentic Bohemian, Moravian and
Slovakian styles, resplendent in
bright colors and crisp whites. The
skirts of the chorus will have only
innumerable white ruffles to give
the effect of the six petticoats usu
ally worn by the Czech peasants,
as the weight of materials other
wise would hamper all activity.
Clever painting and slashing by
costume makers will simulate the
broderie anglaise which the peas
ants wear on their blouses, but yards
of knife-pleating will enhance the
true Czech costumes.
Tickets for the production are now
on sale and may be reserved by
calling at the box office or by calling
Mr. Barker at P.A. 22041.
