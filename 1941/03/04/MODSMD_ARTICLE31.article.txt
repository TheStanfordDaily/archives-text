## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, recently
re-elected national president of the
Motion Picture Research Council,
states that interest in the educa
tional value of movies will charac
terize the activities of the council in
1941.
"We want to see the motion pic
ture rise to its full stature as an
educational, cultural, and esthetic
force," Dr. Wilbur said. "More pic
tures should be produced with the
needs of children in mind," the well
known educator continued.
Much of the work of the council
is devoted to the education of par
ents. helping them to choose wisely
the films suitable for their children.
The council also tries to discrimi
nate between films suitable for adults
and those suitable for children.
Honorary vice-presidents of the
council are Mrs. Calvin Coolidge
and Mrs. Stephen P. Cabot. The
council has a national advisory
committee of educators, sociologists,
and religious and civic leaders of the
nation.
