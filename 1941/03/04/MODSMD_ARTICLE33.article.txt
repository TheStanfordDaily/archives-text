# Background Of Carillon Described By Lefevere
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Carillon bells will ring in the .
coming of spring quarter at Stan
ford. Dreamy students will be gen
tly awakened at the end of a class
by mellow tones pealing out the
hour from the belfry of the Hoover
War Library.
For today, Kamiel Lefevere, one
of the World's greatest carilloneurs,
starts work on the installation of the
35 bells presented to Herbert Hoo
ver as a gift from the Belgian gov
ernment.
"I think I can safely predict thai !
the carillon will be ready to play in !
about three weeks," Mr. Lefevere '
said yesterday afternoon. "Bui be- '
fore that, I will be puttering around
the keyboard with my own impro
visations to test the tuning."
FIRST TOWN CRIER
"The original purpose of the Eu
ropean carillon was to announce the
time for town activities," Mr. Le
fevere explained. The townsfolk had
a different tune for closing of the
gates, opening of their markets and
special festivities."
Sharply enunciating in his stac
cato French accent, Mr. Lefevere
described his task here.
"First we will build a wooden
frame in the tower to hold the bells.
When this job is complete, we ad
just the clapper—you know, the big
thing that strikes the bells to make
them ring—to produce just the right
tone. Mr. Young, my assistant from
Rockefeller Center, is going to at
tend to the electrical work connected
with the automatic playing. I will
specialize in perfecting the clavier
control, that is the French for key
board, as in your piano."
CARILLON 'LIGHT'
Although the largest bell in the
Belgian carillon weighs 1300 pounds,
Mr. Lefevere calls the set "light."
In a full carillon, the largest, or
base, bell weighs four or five tons.
The heaviest bell in the New York
church where Mr. Lefevere plays
is over twenty tons in weight.

"I hope Stanford eventually can
add at least three more heavy bells
to its collection," Mr. Lefevere said.
"The larger its weight range, the
more variety it will have in musical
interpretation. A small carillon must
concentrate its harmony."
On days when the wind is blowing
east, residents of Palo Alto may be
able to hear the carillon music, ac
cording to Mr. Lefevere.

said yesterday afternoon. "Bui be- '
fore that, I will be puttering around
the keyboard with my own impro
visations to test the tuning."
FIRST TOWN CRIER
"The original purpose of the Eu
ropean carillon was to announce the
time for town activities," Mr. Le
fevere explained. The townsfolk had
a different tune for closing of the
gates, opening of their markets and
special festivities."
Sharply enunciating in his stac
cato French accent, Mr. Lefevere
described his task here.
"First we will build a wooden
frame in the tower to hold the bells.
When this job is complete, we ad
just the clapper—you know, the big
thing that strikes the bells to make
them ring—to produce just the right
tone. Mr. Young, my assistant from
Rockefeller Center, is going to at
tend to the electrical work connected
with the automatic playing. I will
specialize in perfecting the clavier
control, that is the French for key
board, as in your piano."
CARILLON 'LIGHT'
Although the largest bell in the
Belgian carillon weighs 1300 pounds,
Mr. Lefevere calls the set "light."
In a full carillon, the largest, or
base, bell weighs four or five tons.
The heaviest bell in the New York
church where Mr. Lefevere plays
is over twenty tons in weight.

"I hope Stanford eventually can
add at least three more heavy bells
to its collection," Mr. Lefevere said.
"The larger its weight range, the
more variety it will have in musical
interpretation. A small carillon must
concentrate its harmony."
On days when the wind is blowing
east, residents of Palo Alto may be
able to hear the carillon music, ac
cording to Mr. Lefevere.
Carillon bells will ring in the .
coming of spring quarter at Stan
ford. Dreamy students will be gen
tly awakened at the end of a class
by mellow tones pealing out the
hour from the belfry of the Hoover
War Library.
For today, Kamiel Lefevere, one
of the World's greatest carilloneurs,
starts work on the installation of the
35 bells presented to Herbert Hoo
ver as a gift from the Belgian gov
ernment.
"I think I can safely predict thai !
the carillon will be ready to play in !
about three weeks," Mr. Lefevere '
said yesterday afternoon. "Bui be- '
fore that, I will be puttering around
the keyboard with my own impro
