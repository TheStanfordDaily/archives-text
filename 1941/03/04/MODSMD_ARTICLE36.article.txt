Stanford's league hoop chumps
look every position on the mythical
All-Southern Division basketball
team, which was released by statis
tician Don Liehendorfer yesterday.
This in contrast to last year, when
the Indians, in second place, failed
to place a man on the first team.
The team was selected by the
loop's hoop coaches, Sam Barry,
Nibs Price, Wilbur Johns, and Ev
erett Dean, each of whom had five
first-team votes. The selection was
on the basis of five points for a
first team selection, three for sec
ond, and one for honorable men
tion.
Don Williams and Fordy Ander
son took the forward spots, Don
Burness won the honors at center,
and Kenny Davidson and Bill Cow
den captured the guard position.
Burness and Davidson were unani
mous choices. Anderson had 18
points, Cowden 16, and Williams 14.
For the second y£gr in a row,
Jackie Robinson, U.C.L.A.'s one-man
athletic institution, copped scoring
honors, while Burness came in
second. Williams, Davidson, and
Anderson were fourth, fifth, and
sixth in scoring to complete what
was almost a Stanford clean sweep
of Southern Division honors.
