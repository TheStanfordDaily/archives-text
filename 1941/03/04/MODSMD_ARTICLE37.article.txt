### CHUCK SMITH 
JT TOOK only the first minute of
fierce action last Saturday night
to convince Stanford's house full of
basketball fans that their team was
going to knock the dickens out of
California in sweet revenge for the
upsetting beating they took at the
hands of the Bears the night before
up in Berkeley's House of 800.
Seldom has a team been as fired
up for a ball game as were the cham
pionship Cards when they took the
floor against Cal. More than a little
embarrassed at the outcome the
night before, Everett Dean's cagers
had made up their minds to win and
win decisively.
I'll bet those Cal kids thought
they had run into a buzz saw dur
ing those first couple of minutes
<;f play. Williams, Davidson & Co.
just about hustled them right off
the Pavilion floor with their drive
and fire. The first four shots the
Bears attempted were blocked
hack into their faces and almost
rammed down their throats.

AFTER the game there was
as much confusion and arm wav- |
ing in the showers as there was the
night the Indians sewed up the con
erence with a victory over U.C.L.A.
But Saturday night Mr. Dean
played it smart. He waited until
ihings had cooled down a bit before
putting in his appearance in the
dressing rooms and probably in this
way avoided another dunking in the
showers.
Last Saturday night it was
Freshman Coach Becb Lee's turn
to get tossed into the cold showers.
His team had won their second
and deciding game from Cal's
frosh in a most convincing man
ner.
In this way the frosh wound up ;
about the most successful season in !
(he history of Stanford. Due mainly j
to the fine coaching of Bceb and the
brilliance and cool experienced hand
of lanky Jim Pollard, the Papooses
made it 17 wins in 18 starts last
Saturday. Both Pollard and his
coach have a shiny future assured !
them in basketball.

In this way the frosh wound up ;
about the most successful season in !
(he history of Stanford. Due mainly j
to the fine coaching of Bceb and the
brilliance and cool experienced hand
of lanky Jim Pollard, the Papooses
made it 17 wins in 18 starts last
Saturday. Both Pollard and his
coach have a shiny future assured !
them in basketball.
JT TOOK only the first minute of
fierce action last Saturday night
to convince Stanford's house full of
basketball fans that their team was
going to knock the dickens out of
California in sweet revenge for the
upsetting beating they took at the
hands of the Bears the night before
up in Berkeley's House of 800.
Seldom has a team been as fired
up for a ball game as were the cham
pionship Cards when they took the
floor against Cal. More than a little
embarrassed at the outcome the
night before, Everett Dean's cagers
had made up their minds to win and
win decisively.
I'll bet those Cal kids thought
they had run into a buzz saw dur
ing those first couple of minutes
<;f play. Williams, Davidson & Co.
just about hustled them right off
the Pavilion floor with their drive
and fire. The first four shots the
Bears attempted were blocked
hack into their faces and almost
rammed down their throats.

AFTER the game there was
as much confusion and arm wav- |
ing in the showers as there was the
night the Indians sewed up the con
erence with a victory over U.C.L.A.
But Saturday night Mr. Dean
played it smart. He waited until
ihings had cooled down a bit before
putting in his appearance in the
dressing rooms and probably in this
way avoided another dunking in the
showers.
Last Saturday night it was
Freshman Coach Becb Lee's turn
to get tossed into the cold showers.
His team had won their second
and deciding game from Cal's
frosh in a most convincing man
ner.
