fett Field, 18-1.
In the lopsided victory Jack Tobin

two runs. Darryl Reynolds led the
i hitting with two singles and a double
! in four attempts .

TWO-YEAR CHAMPS
For two years straight now the :
Fhoenix have topped the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion and are out to repeat. Sheeley
I hasn't had a weak ball club for a I

long time and Wolter will have
much to fear from big stickers like
Reynolds and Tobin.
The Cardinal mentor is counting
on Cootie Thompson to turn back
the St. Mary's sluggers. Veteran of
three years at the baseball wars,
Thompson's dazzling right-hand
slants have humbled big guns be
fore, and if the tall, broad-shouldered
senior hits his stride St. Mary's may
be in for a surprise.
Cardinals' hitting has been pretty
much divided between the first four
men on the batting order, Alex
Cereghino, Monty Pfyl, Kay Ham
mett, and Hanlon. If this first four
continues its streak, Stanford will
have a good chance to upset the
defending champions.

TWO-YEAR CHAMPS
For two years straight now the :
Fhoenix have topped the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion and are out to repeat. Sheeley
I hasn't had a weak ball club for a I

long time and Wolter will have
much to fear from big stickers like
Reynolds and Tobin.
The Cardinal mentor is counting
on Cootie Thompson to turn back
the St. Mary's sluggers. Veteran of
three years at the baseball wars,
Thompson's dazzling right-hand
slants have humbled big guns be
fore, and if the tall, broad-shouldered
senior hits his stride St. Mary's may
be in for a surprise.
Cardinals' hitting has been pretty
much divided between the first four
men on the batting order, Alex
Cereghino, Monty Pfyl, Kay Ham
mett, and Hanlon. If this first four
continues its streak, Stanford will
have a good chance to upset the
defending champions.
Two-time pennant winners in the C.1.8.A.. St. Mary's Phoenix invade
Sunken Diamond Thursday afternoon to battle Stanford's varsity nine
in the opening league encounter of the season.
Coach Earl Sheeley's Moragans made an auspicious '41 beginning
about a week ago, defeating a St. Mary's Alumni Club, 7-2. A few days

later the northerners took a bit
batting practice and smothered Mof
fett Field, 18-1.
In the lopsided victory Jack Tobin
slammed out two doubles and a
homer in four trips, driving in nine
runs for the winners. Tobin quit
basketball for baseball and has be
come one ol' Sheeley's most powerful
sluggers.
BAILEY STARS
Against the Alumni big Wes Bai
ley, sophomore fast-baller, worked
seven innings and let down the
grads with but- two safeties. Red
Tran relieved him in the eighth and
was touched for the opponents' only
two runs. Darryl Reynolds led the
i hitting with two singles and a double
! in four attempts .
Stanford's Coach Harry Wolter
has his troubles—for regular catch
er Ace Hanlon has a game knee and
will be sitting on the bench when
j the two clubs tee off Thursday,
i Red Fay and Jack Randall go to
it on the receiving end. Herb At
