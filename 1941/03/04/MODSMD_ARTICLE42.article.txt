# INTRAMURAL TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Intramural Manager Bert Pike
faces a big problemâ€”weather. Six
times he has scheduled the finals
of the annual intramural track
meet; six times rain has forced
postponement. If no rain falls, the
meet will be held today at 4 o'clock
on Angell Field. If it rains, the
meet will be held tomorrow if no
rain falls then, and so on through
the week.
