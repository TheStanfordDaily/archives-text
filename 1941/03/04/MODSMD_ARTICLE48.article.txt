# Rides to Paly
## 
### 
RIDES to Paly—licked during the last year
by the construction of Palo Alto's bewilder
ing underpass —last month sat up and took light
nourishment.
Now that the structure is complete, and trans
portation into Paly over a bee-line route once
again possible, the campus refound one of the
better and more invigorating of its traditions.
Last week-end four members of the Daily
staff hitch-hiked back and forth from the cam
pus, finding that the tradition was still very
much alive.
But they found that hitching back from Paly
was the tough spot of the game.
There were too many conflicting spots down
town on which to wait for that ride back to the
campus. No one knew where to stand.
So now there's a new official "Rides from
Paly" spot. A corner that's made to order for
the Stanfordite who needs the assistance of the
brethren with wheels.
It's on University. It's the corner directly in
front of Wilson's.
The set-up is perfect. It turns out to be the
only possible choice for the "student stand."
First of all, the corner is the official bus stop,
and thus is red-marked as a no-parking zone.
There won't be any tie-up with cars parked in
that area.
The curbing from Wilson's on down in front
of Roos' is a white zone, with parking permitted
only for picking up passengers.
There's an awning in front of Wilson's, so
that in rainy weather or during those scorching
spring quarter afternoons the waiting student
won't be a hospital case when he finally gets
that "ride from Paly."
There's a phone in Wilson's. And the phone
has been pronounced available for Stanford
students at any time.
The spot could have been farther down Uni
versity and deeper into Paly. But that would
hardly do. Traffic and parking congestion ruled
that out.
It could have been farther down into the un
derpass. We tried the tiny triangle just past the
corner. But drivers step heavy on the foot
throttle after passing the last intersection of
University, and it's not too handy to stop.
Moreover, the traffic problem at that particular
spot is too acute. It's not a parking zone, and
the fellow who stops there runs a not incon
siderable danger of having his car's rear end
bashed in by the driver behind him.
And with the underpass completed and the
new corner in Paly staked out, let's move the
campus spot back to the English corner. The
re-routing of traffic down past the B.A.C. last
year pulled the logical spot over in front of En
cina. But it'll be Palm Drive that sees the heavy
traffic now, and English corner that will see
the best results.
Here it is. Let's make it a real tradition again.

the Stanfordite who needs the assistance of the
brethren with wheels.
It's on University. It's the corner directly in
front of Wilson's.
The set-up is perfect. It turns out to be the
only possible choice for the "student stand."
First of all, the corner is the official bus stop,
and thus is red-marked as a no-parking zone.
There won't be any tie-up with cars parked in
that area.
The curbing from Wilson's on down in front
of Roos' is a white zone, with parking permitted
only for picking up passengers.
There's an awning in front of Wilson's, so
that in rainy weather or during those scorching
spring quarter afternoons the waiting student
won't be a hospital case when he finally gets
that "ride from Paly."
There's a phone in Wilson's. And the phone
has been pronounced available for Stanford
students at any time.
The spot could have been farther down Uni
versity and deeper into Paly. But that would
hardly do. Traffic and parking congestion ruled
that out.
It could have been farther down into the un
derpass. We tried the tiny triangle just past the
corner. But drivers step heavy on the foot
throttle after passing the last intersection of
University, and it's not too handy to stop.
Moreover, the traffic problem at that particular
spot is too acute. It's not a parking zone, and
the fellow who stops there runs a not incon
siderable danger of having his car's rear end
bashed in by the driver behind him.
And with the underpass completed and the
new corner in Paly staked out, let's move the
campus spot back to the English corner. The
re-routing of traffic down past the B.A.C. last
year pulled the logical spot over in front of En
cina. But it'll be Palm Drive that sees the heavy
traffic now, and English corner that will see
the best results.
Here it is. Let's make it a real tradition again.
RIDES to Paly—licked during the last year
by the construction of Palo Alto's bewilder
ing underpass —last month sat up and took light
nourishment.
Now that the structure is complete, and trans
portation into Paly over a bee-line route once
again possible, the campus refound one of the
better and more invigorating of its traditions.
Last week-end four members of the Daily
staff hitch-hiked back and forth from the cam
pus, finding that the tradition was still very
much alive.
But they found that hitching back from Paly
was the tough spot of the game.
There were too many conflicting spots down
town on which to wait for that ride back to the
campus. No one knew where to stand.
So now there's a new official "Rides from
Paly" spot. A corner that's made to order for
the Stanfordite who needs the assistance of the
brethren with wheels.
It's on University. It's the corner directly in
front of Wilson's.
