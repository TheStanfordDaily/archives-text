# Tuesday Afternoon Series
## 
### 
IT'S hard to realize that it's only been seven
days since ye olde editor had us all over
here at the Shack and raked us over the coals.
But there's no getting away from it—it is Tues
day again and the staff will gather, and prompt
ly, at the usual hour of 1:15. In addition to the
ed's ramblings, the "boss," who twists her hair
around her finger, will put a little TNT under
slacking staffers, and toss bouquets to others.
Afternoon seance in the Cellar will find a
couple of top staff members digging deep for
the wherewithal for our eats.—C. B,
