# Forum for You

PERHAPS the most intricate problem now
facing the undergraduate on any university
campus is that of just how the national defense
program will affect him.
It's a problem that is difficult to answer. And
it's a problem that is becoming increasingly

important with the approach of July and the end
of draft deferment for college students.
Tomorrow night a student forum in the Audi
torium will do its part in smoothing out the more
difficult of student problems relating to national
defense. This forum, second held since Sep
tember, will be slanted along the line of how
students can use their training to the fullest ex
tent during the present emergency.
The panel of speakers will include men from
representative major fields, and will discuss the
problem from each particular point of view.
All Stanford men of draft age will find the
forum pointing out new and valuable lines of
training for them. And younger men, who face
the possibility of a lower-age draft bill in the
near future, will find the discussion similarly
advantageous.
Memorial Hall seats 1,700. A forum like this
should pack it.
