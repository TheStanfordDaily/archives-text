### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
OF MEN AND MUSIC
r first Stanford-California "Pop" Concert in the
Opera House the other night drew a large crowd
from the Farm and from across the bay. Its program
left no doubt that it was, definitely, a "pop" concert, too.
There were several vaguely disturbing factors,
though, aside from the list of selections. It was never
quite certain that Gordy Nicoll, Joe Messina, and
Charlie Van Deusen wouldn't hop out of the front row
seats, clad in their rally committee sweaters, and lead
us in a few snappy yells.
At intermission time we rather expected the whistle
to blow and Bill Kimball to trot out the cardboards
for the stunts. "All right, gang, everybody sit right
behind the person in front of him. And remember, no
tearing up cards until the second half starts. Then
we'll throw them all together."
JJURING the William Tell we kept glancing over our
shoulder to see when the Lone Ranger was going
to ride Silver down the aisle. At one point during
the proceedings we would have sworn that Tonto was
trying to brush past the alert usher who stood at the
end of our row.
In general, the orchestra seemed a little perturbed
by the concert. We feel it must have jarred them to
see so many young faces out front—and to be playing
so many unfamiliar numbers. The last time they of
fered Bolero—about two years ago—dozens of San
Francisco dowagers left their plush orchestra seats and
stalked up the aisle in solemn, majestic disdain.
We noticed, incidentally, by yesterday's Want Ads
that Pierre Monteux is in the market for a new trom
bone player. Any interested takers?

seniors have decided to issue 20 tickets to the
first 20 members of the Class of '41 who signed the
Kay Kyser waiting list. Their motives were not, ac
cording to Public Enemy Number One, Dan Hays,
economic; they were purely humanitarian.
Of course the seniors had first chance preference
at buying the bids before they were placed on public
sale. And then they had a couple of days to pick them
tip during the time the 600 lasted. But Hays and his
committee hate to listen to hard-luck stories all day
from senior men who have dates with queens for one
of their last campus dahces—and don't have a bid.
Somewhat justifiably, they decided to give them an
other break.
The whole problem is like a vicious whirlpool.
Many a comimttee chairman has been lost in the vor
tex. The deans' offices encourage Stanford men and
women to stay at home—stay away from highway
palaces of pleasure and San Francisco bright spots.
But almost every campus dance has proved a suc
cess. In fact, the Farm does not have any place suffi
ciently large to accommodate a crowd of over 1,000
people. There are 4.000 Stanford students.
The result is simply this: committee chairmen issue
more tickets, responding to the desperate wail of those
who didn't slide in under the original quota. This
occurred at the Sadie Hawkins dance, for example.
And then original buyers attend the dance, discover
it is packed, leave for a more cheerful atmosphere
where they don't have to elbow the surrounding throng
for a square foot to dance. It's a choice between an
elbow on the bar or one of your ribs.
