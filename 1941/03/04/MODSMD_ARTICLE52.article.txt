LIBRARY TROUBLE

r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Some time ago I went to the Document Room
in the Libe to look at the bound volume of the New
York Times for 1938 for a paper I happened to be
writing. This being the first time I had ever set
foot in the place in my three years at Stanford, I
can't say that I've been much of a nuisance around
there, but the librarian refused to let me see it simply
because I was enrolled in a course with a number be
low 200—the fact that it was only 11 below didn't
seem to make the necessary difference.
I must admit that I was offered the doubtful alter
native of getting a permit from the instructor, but
on a week-end such could hardly qualify as an alter
native.
It is such things as this that will drive students to
violate the Honor Code and start numbering all their
courses at 456Q7893.
Incidentally, I went down to the Palo Alto Library
where I haven't even so much as a card, and they
turned the place upside down to find the information
I needed. Too bad the Paly Libe doesn't have that
$2,000 the Stanford Universty Library gets from the
students every time syllabus fees roll around—or the
$12,000 they'll be getting when we start paying $3 a
quarter instead of 50 cents.

STANFORD SNOBBERY

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
Last Friday night when our team boxed U.C.L.A.
we were forced to forfeit one of our matches. It
seems that the U.C.L.A. boy involved in the particu
lar match was a colored boy and Stanford has a rul
ing that none of her athletes shall box against a
negro.
This attitude seems to be not only inconsistent with
the "democratic" ideals that Stanford endeavors to
teach us, but that it also borders on hypocrisy.
The fact that Stanford does allow her athletes to
participate in basketball and football against teams
using negro athletes seems only to make a bad matter
worse. That it would be a great financial loss to the
B.A.C. not to play such teams has, I'm sure, no bear
ing on the matter.
The administration's policy thus seems to be based
on competing financial and snobbish motives. Let's not
make Stanford's prestige depend upon snobbery. Why
don't we allow our boxers to compete against colored
boys just for the sport of it as well as allowing the
boys in the major sports to compete against them for
the financial return il brings the University?
