# Popular Concert Marred By Orchestral 'Butches'
## 
### 
Amidst a program enlivened by paper airplanes at intermission and
some of the most distressing trombone playing ever heard in the Opera
House, the first University "Pop" Concert was presented by the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra in San Francisco Sunday night.
The less said about (he alleged symphonic arrangement of "Hail, Stan-

ford, Hail" the better. Same for the<
"Fires of Wisdom" of Mills College.
First noticeable butches in the or
chestra came in the too well known
overture to "William Tell," in which
both horns and trumpets violated
the rules of harmony, and managed
to drag in some marvelous examples
of symphonic discord. An otherwise
well behaved audience awoke with
a hum of voices when it recognized
the familiar theme song of the
Lone Ranger and his noble steed.
NATOMA' WELL RECEIVED
Victor Herbert's prelude to the
third act of "Natoma" filled in very
well for about ten minutes, and even
managed to sound the way a sym- !
phony should. The audience was
then treated to a weak-voiced so
prano, Margaret Speaks, singing
two numbers, an aria from "Louise"
by Charpentier, and "Ouvre ton
coeur" by Bizet, which she managed
to get through very well.
The overture-fantasie from "Ro
meo and Juliet" by Tschaikowsky
was one of the better spots of the
program. As one listener expressed
it, "it was the only time I ever
heard 'Our Love' played right." Se
riously, it ranged with Debussy's
prelude to "The Afternoon of a
Faun' as one of the best numbers on
the entire program.
Following an enjoyable intermis
sion, the audience was subjected to
a symphonic presentation of "All
Hail, Blue and Gold," which had been
considered one of the most beauti
ful of college alma maters.
BOLERO SCORES HIT
The two selections from "The
Damnation of Faust" by Berlioz were
indeed excellent, and were very well
received by an enthusiastic audience,
as was the Debussy number. Speaks
sang again. Ravel's immortal Bo
lero was excellent except for the
trombone playing and the forcing

of the clarinetist.
Too much credit cannot go to Dick
Lyon and the committee which made
the concert possible. The idea is a
wonderful one, and should be car
ried further. It is indeed unfortunate
that the few orchestral butches had
to come, for they spoiled an other
wise enjoyable evening.â€”Chandler
