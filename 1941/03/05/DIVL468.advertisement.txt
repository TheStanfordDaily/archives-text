A Message From Dr. Wilbur

Selective Service
Summer Study
"The National Selective Service Saw covers a five-year period
and will probably affect directly nearly all the men now enrolled
in our colleges and universities. It is important that they complete
as much of their education as soon as possible in order to be of
greater value in national service, and this same consideration ap
plies less directly to women students. Under the selective draft,
and for national service, each individual is of value to the country
in proportion to his or her educational attainments.
"Our Summer Quarter offers an opportunity to accelerate the
education of our students. It is a distinctive part of the academic
year. Smaller classes, freedom from extracurricular distractions
promote study and research; a favorable climate, and superior
recreational facilities make the campus unusually attractive.
"This summer will be notable in view of an especially distin
guished group of visiting professors, the Symposium and numer
ous conferences, and other features incident to the Fiftieth An
niversary. The School of Engineering, for the first time, will offer
summer courses to make possible the completion of the twelve
quarter course in three years. Similarly, the other schools of the
University offer distinctive training to complete their require
ments in a shorter time."
