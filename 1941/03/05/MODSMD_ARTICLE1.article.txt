IN ANKARA yesterday Turkish
diplomats were buzzing about,
murmuring in each other's ears,
glancing sidewise at the German
embassy, and methinking the Nazis
do protest too much.
"Here," they said, ''are those
vicious-looking mechanized forces
lined up on our European border."
"But here," they said again, "is
Mr. Ambassador Franz Von Papen
with a delightful little note, right
out of the Fuehrer's mouth, say
ing that Germany is going to 're
spect' our territory like a per
fect gentleman."
Turkish political leaders an
nounced that the note is the begin
ning of a strong campaign to "con
vince" the Turks that it is to their
interest not to regard the Nazi occu
pation of Bulgaria as a threat. The
note expressed a lovely sentiment.
Nazi troops making snoots at the
Turks from across a border are
more "convincing."
# * *
I N A special session to discuss Hit
ler's billet-doux, the Turkish
cabinet invited General Fevis Chak
mak, chief of their general staff, to
sit in on the session. While they're
at it, they probably will mull over
the fact that one Berlin newspaper
hinted yesterday that Germany
might be compelled to occupy Turk
ish territory in the same manner as
she occupied Rumania and Bul
garia.
Britain, which spent the years
between the Rhineland occupation
and Munich being "convinced"—
and got bit—is wondering if the
Reich, contrary to earlier indica
tions, might strike at Turkey
rather than Greece. These quar
ters add that they wouldn't be a
bit surprised. As a matter of fact,
the General Staff "is prepared for
any eventuality in southeastern
Europe."
At 10 o'clock Wednesday morning
(midnight, P.S.T.) British Minister
George Rendel dropped around to
see the Bulgarian prime minister
and pick up his passport. Diplomatic
relations between England and Bul
garia ceased the moment he walked
in the door. The Bulgarians think
that the minute Rendel leaves Sofia,
the R.A.F. will move in. Toward this
eventuality, they are taking steps to
get their capital declared an "open
city."
* * *
JJITLER rapped Russia across the
knuckles with his left hartd as
he patted Turkish palms with his
right. He rejected the Soviet's
strong rebuke over the Nazi armed
occupation of Bulgaria with the as
sertion that he "can tolerate no re
strictions" on his means to crush
Great Britain. His spokesman fur
ther disputed what he called Russia's
"allegation" that the occupation of
Bulgaria threatens "extension of the
sphere of war."
The Germans also admitted for
the first time that their relations
with Greece "arc not good." Any
body else in the world could have
told them that two weeks ago.
Anyway, they also announced that
"they are prepared for any even
tuality in the Balkans."
The Soviet's attitude toward Ger
many's protective custody of nations
has taken a turn for the better—
from Britain's point of view. At the
lime of the Denmark and Norway
occupation, the Russian press stated
editorially that the German move
was guided by "war's own logic" and
noted that Britain and France pre
viously had attempted to utilize
Scandinavia as a "war base" against
Germany.
* * *
that the Fuehrer has moved
in their sphere of influence, the
full text of the Bulgarian note is
being blazoned across all their news
papers, and official Soviet-mouth
piece editors screamed like hawks.
Italy said yesterday that she re
fuses to negotiate peace with
(.recce and is determined to
achieve a "complete military .set
tlement" with Greece. Any talk
of an armistice is "tenacious and
impossible to take seriously."

the fact that one Berlin newspaper
hinted yesterday that Germany
might be compelled to occupy Turk
ish territory in the same manner as
she occupied Rumania and Bul
garia.
Britain, which spent the years
between the Rhineland occupation
and Munich being "convinced"—
and got bit—is wondering if the
Reich, contrary to earlier indica

rather than Greece. These quar

the General Staff "is prepared for

At 10 o'clock Wednesday morning
(midnight, P.S.T.) British Minister
George Rendel dropped around to
see the Bulgarian prime minister
and pick up his passport. Diplomatic
relations between England and Bul
garia ceased the moment he walked
in the door. The Bulgarians think
that the minute Rendel leaves Sofia,
the R.A.F. will move in. Toward this
eventuality, they are taking steps to
get their capital declared an "open
city."

JJITLER rapped Russia across the
knuckles with his left hartd as
he patted Turkish palms with his
right. He rejected the Soviet's
strong rebuke over the Nazi armed
occupation of Bulgaria with the as
sertion that he "can tolerate no re
strictions" on his means to crush
Great Britain. His spokesman fur
ther disputed what he called Russia's
"allegation" that the occupation of
Bulgaria threatens "extension of the
sphere of war."
The Germans also admitted for
the first time that their relations
with Greece "arc not good." Any
body else in the world could have
told them that two weeks ago.
Anyway, they also announced that
"they are prepared for any even
tuality in the Balkans."
The Soviet's attitude toward Ger
many's protective custody of nations
has taken a turn for the better—
from Britain's point of view. At the
lime of the Denmark and Norway
occupation, the Russian press stated
editorially that the German move
was guided by "war's own logic" and
noted that Britain and France pre
viously had attempted to utilize
Scandinavia as a "war base" against
Germany.

IN ANKARA yesterday Turkish
diplomats were buzzing about,
murmuring in each other's ears,
glancing sidewise at the German
embassy, and methinking the Nazis
do protest too much.
"Here," they said, ''are those

Mr. Ambassador Franz Von Papen
with a delightful little note, right
out of the Fuehrer's mouth, say

Turkish political leaders an

note expressed a lovely sentiment.

IN ANKARA yesterday Turkish
diplomats were buzzing about,
murmuring in each other's ears,
glancing sidewise at the German
embassy, and methinking the Nazis
do protest too much.
"Here," they said, ''are those
vicious-looking mechanized forces
lined up on our European border."
"But here," they said again, "is
Mr. Ambassador Franz Von Papen
with a delightful little note, right
out of the Fuehrer's mouth, say
ing that Germany is going to 're
spect' our territory like a per
fect gentleman."
Turkish political leaders an
nounced that the note is the begin
ning of a strong campaign to "con
vince" the Turks that it is to their
interest not to regard the Nazi occu
pation of Bulgaria as a threat. The
note expressed a lovely sentiment.
Nazi troops making snoots at the
Turks from across a border are
more "convincing."

I N A special session to discuss Hit
ler's billet-doux, the Turkish
cabinet invited General Fevis Chak
mak, chief of their general staff, to
sit in on the session. While they're
at it, they probably will mull over
the fact that one Berlin newspaper
hinted yesterday that Germany
might be compelled to occupy Turk
ish territory in the same manner as
she occupied Rumania and Bul
garia.
Britain, which spent the years
between the Rhineland occupation
and Munich being "convinced"—
and got bit—is wondering if the
Reich, contrary to earlier indica
tions, might strike at Turkey
rather than Greece. These quar
ters add that they wouldn't be a
bit surprised. As a matter of fact,
the General Staff "is prepared for
any eventuality in southeastern
Europe."
At 10 o'clock Wednesday morning
(midnight, P.S.T.) British Minister
George Rendel dropped around to
see the Bulgarian prime minister
and pick up his passport. Diplomatic
relations between England and Bul
garia ceased the moment he walked
in the door. The Bulgarians think
that the minute Rendel leaves Sofia,
the R.A.F. will move in. Toward this
eventuality, they are taking steps to
get their capital declared an "open
city."
