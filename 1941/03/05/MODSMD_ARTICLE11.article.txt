versatility. Because of its popular

her selections Schubert's "Ave
Maria." She will present also a
group of her beloved negro spirituals
including Hall Johnson's arrange
ment of "His Name So Sweet."
This will be Miss Maynor's first

She began her training in the
choir school of her father. After
graduating from Hampton Institute
she toured Europe with the Insti
tute's negro chorus. Her entire life
has been devoted to music.
