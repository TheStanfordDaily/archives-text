# FROSH BEATING RILES FARM
## Campus Simmers Over Incident 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
"Look, let's get every freshman—
there's 450 of us—and knock hell
out of every cop on Third and How
ard."
"Aw, be practical! We couldn't
get away with that."
"Well, how about just water-bag
ging every cop in the city?"
But Encina bull sessions, discuss
ing the recent beatings of two Stan
ford frosh in San Francisco, have
now calmed down and the only ac
tion promised is sending petitions to
Mayor Rossi and Governor Olson.
Encina is particularly aroused
over the affair because they know
and like the two freshmen. The col
lective opinion is that Allan and
Barber are "good Joes" and were
not touring the slums just for the
bang of it.
And on the other side of the cam
pus at Roble, bull sessions were less
vehement, but equally indignant. As
one frosh woman said, "It's terrible
and Roble is stirred up. We want to
see justice done."

All over the campus students were
echoing these opinions.
"We are upset about it, not only
because the victims are someone we
know, but because it shows that
sort of thing is a routine practice
with San Francisco police."
"It's a shame that two innocent
persons have to suffer before such
a situation is aired."
MORE OPINIONS
"Those kids were just slumming;
they had no sincere sociological mo
tives. They were asking for some
thing and they got it."
"Sure, they were asking for some
thing, but no matter what they did
or what they said there is not the
slightest justification for beating
them up."
And a humorous slant: "That just
goes to show you when a Stanford
man puts on old clothes and grows a
little beard, he's just like any other
human being."
A professor in an economics sec
tion yesterday revealed a significant
fact—the Wickersham report, com

piled by a congressional committee
during Hoover's administration, lists
the San Francisco police force as the
most notorious of any in the Uni
ted States.

POSTCARD BARRAGE
Campaigns to barrage Mayor Rossi
and San Francisco newspapers with
post cards and letters arc under way
in Roble, Lagunita, Union, and En

Examples of the post cards fol

"Honorable Mayor Rossi:
"May I take this means of ex
pressing my sincere displeasure and
alarm caused by the beatings of two
fellow Stanford students by mem
bers of the San Francisco police de
partment when arrested Saturday
night. I trust that your office will
demand a thorough investigation.
"Dear Mayor Rossi:
"Some San Francisco police beat
up two friends of mine. How about
an investigation?"
(Signed)
"Look, let's get every freshman—
there's 450 of us—and knock hell
out of every cop on Third and How
ard."
"Aw, be practical! We couldn't
get away with that."
"Well, how about just water-bag
ging every cop in the city?"
But Encina bull sessions, discuss
ing the recent beatings of two Stan
ford frosh in San Francisco, have
now calmed down and the only ac
tion promised is sending petitions to
Mayor Rossi and Governor Olson.
Encina is particularly aroused
over the affair because they know
and like the two freshmen. The col
lective opinion is that Allan and
Barber are "good Joes" and were
not touring the slums just for the
bang of it.
And on the other side of the cam
pus at Roble, bull sessions were less
vehement, but equally indignant. As
one frosh woman said, "It's terrible
and Roble is stirred up. We want to
see justice done."

All over the campus students were
echoing these opinions.
"We are upset about it, not only
because the victims are someone we
know, but because it shows that
sort of thing is a routine practice
with San Francisco police."
"It's a shame that two innocent
persons have to suffer before such
a situation is aired."
