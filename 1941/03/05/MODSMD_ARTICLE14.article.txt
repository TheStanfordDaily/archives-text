# 'It's Happened Before,' Says S.F. 'Skid Row' Character
## 
### 
(A wandering Daily reporter last night toured the "other side of the
slot" district in which Don Allen and Carter Barber were arrested for
vagrancy. The following interview with members of the city's "other
half" contains no names, as none were asked or given. Comments, per
haps, must be taken with a grain o fsalt, but they were received in good
faith.—Editor's note.)

"Sure I read about them kids in
the papers," said the hairy guy in
the undershirt.
"Don't surprise me none. I've
heard it happen before."
He was one of fourteen men from
"the other side of Market Street" I
talked to last night.
Most of them wouldn't say much.
The usual response was, "Who are
you?" or "What the hell's your
racket?"
The hairy man continued. "I
could tell you plenty, kid." (They
all called me "kid" or "sonny," but
most were about my own age.) "But
what's the use? I've got no money
so what does it matter? But I'll tell
you this much: it's happened be
fore."
This was just the voice of one
man from that "other side" of San
Francisco, but, basically, his voice
expressed the thoughts and the
words of those thirteen other men
with whom I talked on street cor
ners, in backwash beerhalls, or just
sitting on the curb.
They all remained tight-lipped.
They seemed sore and all were sus
picious.
JUST A GAME
An Irish kid, about 19, snickered a
little when I questioned him. "It's
just a game between us and the cops.
There's no hard feelings."
Then he smiled again, but his lips
did not bend.
All of them looked like good guys.
That is, all except the one who threw
a rock at my car when I stopped to
talk. And all of them haven't been
down-and-outers all their lives. I
spoke a long time with a fellow
who called himself John. He came
from a junior college "somewhere
in southern California." *
"These men aren't tough," he said,
nodding at nearby loiterers. "They
just think they are."
And I thought of the hairy guy in
the undershirt saying, "Don't sur
prise me none; I've heard it happen
before."
Why?

"Sure I read about them kids in
the papers," said the hairy guy in
the undershirt.
"Don't surprise me none. I've
heard it happen before."
He was one of fourteen men from
"the other side of Market Street" I
talked to last night.
Most of them wouldn't say much.
The usual response was, "Who are
you?" or "What the hell's your
racket?"
The hairy man continued. "I
could tell you plenty, kid." (They
all called me "kid" or "sonny," but
most were about my own age.) "But
what's the use? I've got no money
so what does it matter? But I'll tell
you this much: it's happened be
fore."
This was just the voice of one
man from that "other side" of San
Francisco, but, basically, his voice
expressed the thoughts and the
words of those thirteen other men
with whom I talked on street cor
ners, in backwash beerhalls, or just
sitting on the curb.
They all remained tight-lipped.
They seemed sore and all were sus
picious.
JUST A GAME
An Irish kid, about 19, snickered a
little when I questioned him. "It's
just a game between us and the cops.
There's no hard feelings."
Then he smiled again, but his lips
did not bend.
All of them looked like good guys.
That is, all except the one who threw
a rock at my car when I stopped to
talk. And all of them haven't been
down-and-outers all their lives. I
spoke a long time with a fellow
who called himself John. He came
from a junior college "somewhere
in southern California." *
"These men aren't tough," he said,
nodding at nearby loiterers. "They
just think they are."
And I thought of the hairy guy in
the undershirt saying, "Don't sur
prise me none; I've heard it happen
before."
Why?
