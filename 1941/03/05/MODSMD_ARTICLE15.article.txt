At a late hour last night, the
Sunset Limited, crack Espee train
due in San Francisco yesterday
morning, was still sitting on its
track north of Santa Barbara â€”
between a 600-foot slide and a
washout.
And so was Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur.
Four San Francisco newspapers,
three international wire-services,
and the Stanford Daily want a
statement about cops and a couple
of boys in the Palo Alto Hospital.
