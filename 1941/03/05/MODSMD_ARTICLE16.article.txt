# Barber, Allan Ride to City Told by Friend
## 
### BILL STEIF 
Someone walked into the room
last Saturday evening. I turned
around and in almost the same
movement jumped up and back
wards several feet. "Fer God's
sake " I said, and gaped.
It was Carter — Carter Barber —
and he had come up to the room to
see about the ride I had offered to
give him into San Francisco that
night. He had asked me about it a
day or two earlier, saying that he
and Don Allan were going up, and
since I had to go to Oakland any
way I said I'd take them along. I
didn't have any idea what they
wanted to go to the city for, and
hadn't asked to know.
CARTER'S DISGUISE
Carter's get-up piqued my inter

had emphasized his appearance with
make-up pencil. Naturally I jumped.
We made our arrangements and
then about 8:30 o'clock Carter, Don
Allan in the same array, and my
self set out for San Francisco. It
was a tough night. Gusts of rain
swept through the darkness toward
us. Driving was hard. Outside of
Menlo we stopped to buy gas. I be

whim of two kids walking into San
Francisco's "skid row," as Carter
had told me they intended to do.
KNOWLEDGE SEEKERS
Don and Carter, I know, had often
had serious discussions about relig
ion, about God, about politics, about
those things which today are often
neglected in such talks. Carter had
often talked to me about these same
intangibles. Western Civ and Eng
lish had stimulated these interests.
Most kids, green and fuzzy, have
talked about these same things, I
imagine. Few have had the guts to
find out something about some of
the social problems which they dis
cuss — unemployment, slums, habit
ual drunkenness, vagabondage, des
titution and prostitution.
Don and Carter were interested in
these things. They were aware that
