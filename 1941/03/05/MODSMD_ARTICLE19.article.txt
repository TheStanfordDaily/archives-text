# Injured Frosh To Try To Identify Policemen In S.F. Line-Up Friday
## Allan, Barber Are Reported 'Getting Along All Right' 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Two Stanford freshmen, who
charge their persons were "bruised
and smashed wantonly and without
provocation" by San Francisco po
lice, will appear before Police Chief
Charles Dullea Friday to attempt
identification of the man or men
who they say slugged them.
Meanwhile no identification of
just what San Francisco policeman,
if any, is guilty of beating two Stan
ford students had been made late
last night.
Both are "getting along all right
and will be out of the hospital (Palo
Alto Hospital on campus) in two
or three days," declared Dr. Blake
Wilbur, their attending physician,
last night. He would make no fur
ther statement concerning the ex
tent of their injuries.
CLAIM. INJURIES
Donald Allan and Carter Barber,
18-year-old Encinamen, who were
picked up and booked for vagrancy
by police early Sunday morning
while wandering about San Fran
cisco's "South of Market" district
as a "sociological experiment,"
claim they suffered extensive in
juries, which now confine them to
hospital beds, at the hands of South
Station policemen.
Chief Dullea said yesterday he
had ordered all officers involved to
report to Southern Station Friday
afternoon, following the students'
statement that they 'could identify
their assailant in a line-up of 12
uniformed men.
Dr. Russell Lee, local physician
who ministered to the youths upon
their return to the campus Sunday
noon, said last night:
"They had received no attention
up there (jail) at all as far as 1
know."
GENUINE INTEREST
Dean of Men John Bunn pro
claimed emphatically yesterday af
ternoon:
"These are high class kids—they
are boys of superior ability. I am
sure they would not go up there,
just on a lark, and I'm sure they
were genuinely interested (in social
conditions)."
"I can see no reason," he con
tinued, "why they should be beaten
up by the police. If this is the situ
ation, it behooves the city of San
Francisco to watch police tactics
carefully and the police department
should certainly be investigated."
Academic ability of the students
is indicated by the fact that both
arc on independent study in the
freshman course in Western Civili
zation, considered a stumbling block
and "bugaboo" by many.
UP TO POLICE CHIEF
John Baldwin, step-father of Al
lan and prominent San Francisco
lawyer, said yesterday the matter
is in the hands of the chief of
police and that he and his law part
ner, Hubert Wyckoff, are awaiting
the report on the investigation.
"I expect Chief Dullea will have
some answer to make to the charges
the boys have made," he said. "The
boys are doing okay, although they
are pretty well battered up."
Baldwin and Wyckoff were pres
ent in the hospital room Monday
j afternoon w hen Supervising Cap
tain Arthur L. Christiansen and
Stenographer Frank Jones of the
city police questioned the lads for
more than three hours.
The press could not contact the
injured pair for a statement yester
day. A note from Barber answer
ing a Daily query said laconically,
"This is not intended to be sarcastic
but you'll have to see our attor-
I neys."
The occurrence in San Francisco
recalled the Wickersham Commis
sion report to Congress in 1931, na
! (ion - wide investigation of police
activities. The report on San Fran
cisco stated that "all (sources) agree
that the third degree exists in San
Francisco."
Police reports yesterday are sub
mitted to Chief Dullea by arrest
ing Officers Sergeant Thomas Flana
gan and Joseph Green; Officer Roy
Loran, who booked the boys; Ser
geant John Keeley, Officer John
Desmond; Arthur Gibson, Charles
Frescura and Robert Winter, three
radio car officers; and Driver Benito
Escobar.

CLAIM. INJURIES
Donald Allan and Carter Barber,
18-year-old Encinamen, who were
picked up and booked for vagrancy
by police early Sunday morning
while wandering about San Fran
cisco's "South of Market" district
as a "sociological experiment,"
claim they suffered extensive in
juries, which now confine them to
hospital beds, at the hands of South
Station policemen.
Chief Dullea said yesterday he
had ordered all officers involved to
report to Southern Station Friday
afternoon, following the students'
statement that they 'could identify
their assailant in a line-up of 12
uniformed men.
Dr. Russell Lee, local physician
who ministered to the youths upon
their return to the campus Sunday
noon, said last night:
"They had received no attention
up there (jail) at all as far as 1
know."
GENUINE INTEREST
Dean of Men John Bunn pro
claimed emphatically yesterday af
ternoon:
"These are high class kids—they
are boys of superior ability. I am
sure they would not go up there,
just on a lark, and I'm sure they
were genuinely interested (in social
conditions)."
"I can see no reason," he con
tinued, "why they should be beaten
up by the police. If this is the situ
ation, it behooves the city of San
Francisco to watch police tactics
carefully and the police department
should certainly be investigated."
Academic ability of the students

arc on independent study in the

UP TO POLICE CHIEF
John Baldwin, step-father of Al

lawyer, said yesterday the matter

"I expect Chief Dullea will have
some answer to make to the charges
the boys have made," he said. "The
boys are doing okay, although they
are pretty well battered up."
Baldwin and Wyckoff were pres
ent in the hospital room Monday
j afternoon w hen Supervising Cap

Stenographer Frank Jones of the
city police questioned the lads for
more than three hours.
The press could not contact the

their assailant in a line-up of 12
uniformed men.
Dr. Russell Lee, local physician
who ministered to the youths upon
their return to the campus Sunday
noon, said last night:
"They had received no attention
up there (jail) at all as far as 1
know."
GENUINE INTEREST
Dean of Men John Bunn pro
claimed emphatically yesterday af
ternoon:
"These are high class kids—they
are boys of superior ability. I am
sure they would not go up there,
just on a lark, and I'm sure they
were genuinely interested (in social
conditions)."
"I can see no reason," he con
tinued, "why they should be beaten
up by the police. If this is the situ
ation, it behooves the city of San
Francisco to watch police tactics
carefully and the police department
should certainly be investigated."
Academic ability of the students
is indicated by the fact that both
arc on independent study in the
freshman course in Western Civili
zation, considered a stumbling block
and "bugaboo" by many.
UP TO POLICE CHIEF
John Baldwin, step-father of Al
lan and prominent San Francisco
lawyer, said yesterday the matter
is in the hands of the chief of
police and that he and his law part
ner, Hubert Wyckoff, are awaiting
the report on the investigation.
"I expect Chief Dullea will have
some answer to make to the charges
the boys have made," he said. "The
boys are doing okay, although they
are pretty well battered up."
Baldwin and Wyckoff were pres
ent in the hospital room Monday
j afternoon w hen Supervising Cap
tain Arthur L. Christiansen and
Stenographer Frank Jones of the
city police questioned the lads for
more than three hours.
The press could not contact the
injured pair for a statement yester
day. A note from Barber answer
ing a Daily query said laconically,
"This is not intended to be sarcastic
but you'll have to see our attor-
I neys."
The occurrence in San Francisco
recalled the Wickersham Commis
sion report to Congress in 1931, na
! (ion - wide investigation of police
activities. The report on San Fran
cisco stated that "all (sources) agree
that the third degree exists in San
Francisco."
Police reports yesterday are sub
mitted to Chief Dullea by arrest
ing Officers Sergeant Thomas Flana
gan and Joseph Green; Officer Roy
Loran, who booked the boys; Ser
geant John Keeley, Officer John
Desmond; Arthur Gibson, Charles
Frescura and Robert Winter, three
radio car officers; and Driver Benito
Escobar.
Two Stanford freshmen, who
charge their persons were "bruised
and smashed wantonly and without
provocation" by San Francisco po
lice, will appear before Police Chief
Charles Dullea Friday to attempt
identification of the man or men
who they say slugged them.
Meanwhile no identification of
just what San Francisco policeman,
if any, is guilty of beating two Stan
ford students had been made late
last night.
Both are "getting along all right
and will be out of the hospital (Palo
Alto Hospital on campus) in two
or three days," declared Dr. Blake
Wilbur, their attending physician,
last night. He would make no fur
ther statement concerning the ex
tent of their injuries.
CLAIM. INJURIES
Donald Allan and Carter Barber,
18-year-old Encinamen, who were
picked up and booked for vagrancy
by police early Sunday morning
while wandering about San Fran
cisco's "South of Market" district
as a "sociological experiment,"
claim they suffered extensive in
juries, which now confine them to
hospital beds, at the hands of South
Station policemen.
Chief Dullea said yesterday he
had ordered all officers involved to
report to Southern Station Friday
afternoon, following the students'
statement that they 'could identify
their assailant in a line-up of 12
uniformed men.
