# Excom Initiates Five-Point Plan Designed to Improve Practice of Honor System
## Long Meeting Results in Fabling Men's Nom Com Proposal; Ross Sees Bewildering Flaws in Program 
### CHARLES BULL 
Ex Committee last night pledged itself to a five-point program sub
mitted by President Brute Jessup for upholding student responsibility
for the Honor Code as the aftermath of last week's meeting with Dr. Wilbur.
"I don't think any of us is in favor of making definite rules governing
the Code," Jessup asserted in proposing that the following student action
be taken: A «

1. The president of every campus
living group will meet next Tues
day night for dinner at the Beta
house and discuss the matter, taking
it back to the individual organiza
tions.
2. Investigation of each depart
ment's procedure in exams.
3. Letters to be sent to every fac
ulty member urging early arrange
ment for adequate room for exams.
4. Encourage staying in class
rooms during exams.
5. Act individually to bring to
light any cheating. Discourage it
before it reaches the councils.
MEN'S NOM COM
Despite Norm Ross's "utter bewil
derment" at general student disfavor
for his pet idea of a Men's Nominat
ing Committee, the matter was
brought up, thoroughly hashed over,
and tabled in last night's session.
Hugh O'Donnell told of Cal's dis
satisfaction with a similar system in
use at Berkeley.
After agreeing that such a commit
tee would not abolish caucuses, it
was suggested sororities drop out of
the present caucus system. Propo
nent Ross admitted "it would take
an awful lot of fun out of the
caucuses."
After charge and counter-charge
on such vital topics as pressure
politics, horse-trading, personal
merits, straight tickets, democratic
practices, et al. with members
Hutchinson and Pugh continually
damning the proposal on all counts,
Ross Agreed that the plan "was not
mature enough" and the matter was
pigeon-holed indefinitely.
FROSH DIRECTORY
Far from being dismayed at his
first defeat, Norm Ross plunged into
another subject which met with
more favor at the hands of the com
mittee—a directory of freshmen
(men and women) including indi
vidual pictures of each frosh, names,
home-towns, high school attended.
He cited similar publications at
Harvard, Yale, and Oberlin. Jessup
asked that he secui'e more definite
infomation as to costs and doubling
with Quad or registration photos.
ALL-UNIVERSITY SINGFEST
"To keep Rally Committee from
dying out during Winter and Spring
Quarters," Chairman Bill Kimball
submitted first-draft plans for an
all-University competitive singfest
to be held in the Frost Amphitheater
May 7 when the moon will be al
most full.
"The moon helps a lot; it gets
pretty dark down in there," spoke
Kimball in an experienced tone.
It was agreed that living groups
must have 20 persons in the "choral"
group in order to compete for the
proposed loving cup to be made an
annual trophy.
Now having something to work
on, Rally Committee will go to work
and bring forth some concrete de
tails.
FIFTH CONCERT
A proposal by Elinor Hall to pre
sent a dance concert by Veloz and
Yolanda in April to "help retire the
Memorial Theater debt" was dinged
as financially impractical.
NOTHER POP CONCERT
Bruce Jessup is going to dig into
further details of a Spring Quarter
"pop" concert by the San Francisco
Symphony in the Frost Amphi
theater.
