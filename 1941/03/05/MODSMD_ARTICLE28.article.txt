# Mendelowitz Keeps Busy With Mural At Oxnard
## 
### LUCILLE THOMPSON 
Daniel M. Mendelowitz, associate professor in art and education, has
been spending a lot of time commuting between Stanford and Oxnard.
Under the sponsorship of the Fine Arts Division of the PWA, he is work
ing on a mural for the new Oxnard post office.
Last year Mr. Mendelowitz entered a contest sponsored by the Fine Arts
As one of the finalists in

the competition, he received the
commission to decorate the PWA
built post office.
The mural is a panorama of a few
of the characteristic features of Ox
nard. "My object," saicl Mr. Men
delowitz, "has been not to paint a
photograph of the town, but rather
to give the personality of the town."
The 14.x 3 canvas contains a view
of the sea, the shore, and the town.
Behind the town is painted a sugar
beet factor, the airport, and the
typical eucalyptus and Cyprus wind
breaks around the fields.
Other than the design which he
submitted in the competition, Mr.
Mendelowitz has had no previous
mural painting. He has worked
with Mr. Arnautoff on several of the
four murals which Mr. Arnautoff
has painted.
In all PWA buildings, 1 per cent
of the cost of the building is allotted
to the decoration. The murals were
customarily commissioned by the
architects, but now the Fine Arts
Division commissions the paintings.
The mural is almost finished at
present. It will be hung in the Ox
nard post office sometime this month.
