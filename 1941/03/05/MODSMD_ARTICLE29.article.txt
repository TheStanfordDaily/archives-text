# Farm to View Grenfell Display In Women's Clubhouse Friday
## 
### 
Joining other West Coast colleges and universities that have been vis
ited by the touring station wagon of the Grenfell Labrador Association,
Stanford will have the opportunity Friday to view a display of handi
craft, made by Labrador fisher folk, in the Women's Clubhouse.
From 10 to (i o'clock students will be able to view and purchase real

fur-edged parkas, skin boots, knit-,
ted mittens and socks, carved figur
ines of walrus ivory, and hooked
rugs made on the near-arctic coasts
of Labrador and North Newfound
land. Miss Catherine Vaughn, of
the Grenfell Association, will con
duct the exhibit and be in charge of
sales.
The handicraft products that will
be displayed are a part of the Gren
fell Association's project to organ
ize industrial work for a people
whose only possible economic activ
ity had been fishing. The proceeds
from sales of these articles are to be
used in keeping the supplementary
home industries alive, as well as in
the maintenance of hospitals, or
phanages and schools established by
Sir Wilfred Grenfell.
Since the advent of the war to
the British colony of Newfound
land, of which the coast of Labra
dor is a part, so many men have
been conscripted that these indus
tries represent almost the sole source
of livelihood of the population.
Women are unable to operate the
fishing and sealing schooners, thus
precluding their former revenue.
A Grenfell "alumnae," Miss Eliza
beth Crandall, director of Lagunita,
is assisting Miss Vaughn with Fri
day's sale, as is the Social Service
Group of the "Y." Miss Crandall
once spent 13 months in Labrador
as an industrial arts teacher.
