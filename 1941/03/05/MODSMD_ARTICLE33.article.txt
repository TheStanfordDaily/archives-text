# Varsity Nine Rated Even Chance Against Moragans In League Tilt Tomorrow
## 
### 
After ytstcrday's superlative practice on Sunken Diamond, Stanford s
baseball squad is rated an even chance to stop St. Mary's tomorrow after
noon win n (he two clubs meet in the opening C.1.8 A. game.
Looking every inch like a million dollar team, the Indians held their
best batting and infield workout to date. Coach Harry Wolter has an

extra long infield and the hoys
looked good.
Monte Pfyl and "Botch" Caruso
are beginning to synchronize the
play around second base, and Ray
Hammett is covering a lot of ground
at first.
All four of Stanford's starting j
pitchers, "Cootie" Thompson, Russ ,
Smith, Claude Purkitt, and Phil j
Wolf took turns on the hill and
everybody batted around twice.
Wolf, seemingly in perfect shape
after his recent throwing flipper in
jury, was going great guns, as were j
the rest of the pitchers.
ATKINSON READY
More good news filtered out of the
fast-drying baseball Held as word
came that catcher Herb Atkinson
will be able to suit up for the St.
Mary's struggle. Jack Randall had
a good day yesterday too, and either
may start behind the plate against
the Phoenix.
Another ray of sunshine came as
Bill "Ace" Hanlon will be ready to
play by the time spring vacation
series with U.C.L.A. and Southern
California starts four weeks hence.
Manager Eddie Zeisler scheduled
a game with the Maher Paint Co.,
which will be played here at 2:30
o'clock Saturday afternoon. It will
probably be the last until the In
dians go on their barnstorming
southern tour.
NEVER,CAN TELL
Though Stanford finished far in
the wake of other conference clubs
last year, no one will be too sur
prised to see the Indians play "St.
Mary's to a standstill tomorrow and
defeat the defending champions.
Veteran Thompson figures to get
the starting call on the mound,
while big Wes Bailey will chuck
'em in for the Phoenix.
Jack Tobin, flashy Moragan bas
ketballer, quit the cage game for
baseball and is one of Coach Earl
Sheely's heaviest hitters. Another
big sticker to watch will be Ray
Tran, short stop, who beat Califor
nia last year in the ninth inning
on a Texas leaguer that drove in
the two winning runs.
