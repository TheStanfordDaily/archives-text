TO7ELL, how do you like that? All '
five of those championship In- j
dian cagers were picked by the
coaches of the Southern Division of i
the Pacific Coast Conference as the
best ball players in the conference
for their respective positions!
And what a contrast this is to
last year's selections. Remcmber
—though the Cards finished up in
second place, not a single mem
ber of the team was named
Coast.
Last season the coaches completely I
ignored Stanford's most deserving i
hoopster, Co-captain Kenny David- i
son, who scored more points in a !
season of conference competition
than any guard has ever scored,
finishing third in the scoring race.
* * *
B UT those Indians just couldn't ;
be denied this season. For in- |
stance, last year, when Donnie Wil- |
liams lost his eye after going on !
several scoring sprees in the earlier j
games and when Fordy Anderson up j
and came down with pneumonia in |
the middle of the conference race. J
U.C.L.A.'s Jackie Robinson, high
scorer in the conference, was made
an All-Coast forward, along with
U.S.C.'s Ralph Vaughn.
But this year, with "Willie"
hitting consistently throughout
the season and with Fordy healthy
and faster and trickier than ever,
the Bruins' dusky Mr. Robinson,
despite the fact that he was the
Coast's high scorer, had to be sat
isfied with second-string All -
Coast.
* * *
T CAN just hear the moaning that
is going on over at Berkeley or !
down south on the U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. campuses at this unprece
dented but very logical selection of
an All-Coast team.
But I think I can find several good
reasons why the coaches would make
such a choice. In the first place, the
Indians have won 22 out of their 25
ball games. In the second place, four
Cards were among the top six high
scorers in the conference. And in
the third place and more important
in the eyes of a coach attempting to i
pick an All-Something team, the In- j
dians made each other look good with
well executed blocks or quick pass
off s.
And in the fourth place I scrim
maged against them three times a !
week.
And by the way, this is the first j
time I have ever heard of an All- I
Something-or-Other team which j
cannot be called a mythical team.
This year's All-Coast quintet is
Stanford's basketball team—just as
real as the Hoover War Libe.

RECENTLY Ex Committee made
{ a few slight but very welcome
changes in the requirements for a
varsity track award. In the past a
cinderman has been required to
place against the tough competition
of either California, U.S.C., in the
Pacific Coast Conference or in the
National Collegiates. And, oh yes, if
I he was a member of a world record
j breaking relay team at the Fresno
Relays, he would be given a letter.
But this was awfully tough. For
instance ,a few years ago a pole
vaulter, if he tied up against Cali
fornia, would be out of luck for
U.S.C. had three men who could
do 14-4. Even this year an aver
age half-milcr would have to place
against the Trojans or else, for C'al
is supposed to have the tremen
dous total of 8 men who can do
1:54.
But all this is changed. Accord
ing to the new requirements, points
against U.C.L.A. have been included
and if a trackster makes a total of 7
points in collegiate competition, not
\ including the relays nor practice
j dual meets — those with San Jose
S State or Fresno State—he earns him-
I self a letter.

five of those championship In- j
dian cagers were picked by the
coaches of the Southern Division of i
the Pacific Coast Conference as the
best ball players in the conference
for their respective positions!
And what a contrast this is to
last year's selections. Remcmber
—though the Cards finished up in
second place, not a single mem
ber of the team was named
Coast.
Last season the coaches completely I
ignored Stanford's most deserving i
hoopster, Co-captain Kenny David- i
son, who scored more points in a !
season of conference competition
than any guard has ever scored,
finishing third in the scoring race.

B UT those Indians just couldn't ;
be denied this season. For in- |
stance, last year, when Donnie Wil- |
liams lost his eye after going on !
several scoring sprees in the earlier j
games and when Fordy Anderson up j
and came down with pneumonia in |
the middle of the conference race. J
U.C.L.A.'s Jackie Robinson, high
scorer in the conference, was made
an All-Coast forward, along with
U.S.C.'s Ralph Vaughn.
But this year, with "Willie"
hitting consistently throughout
the season and with Fordy healthy
and faster and trickier than ever,
the Bruins' dusky Mr. Robinson,
despite the fact that he was the
Coast's high scorer, had to be sat
isfied with second-string All -
Coast.

T CAN just hear the moaning that
is going on over at Berkeley or !
down south on the U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. campuses at this unprece
dented but very logical selection of
an All-Coast team.
But I think I can find several good
reasons why the coaches would make
such a choice. In the first place, the
Indians have won 22 out of their 25
ball games. In the second place, four
Cards were among the top six high
scorers in the conference. And in
the third place and more important
in the eyes of a coach attempting to i
pick an All-Something team, the In- j
dians made each other look good with
well executed blocks or quick pass
off s.
And in the fourth place I scrim
maged against them three times a !
week.
And by the way, this is the first j
time I have ever heard of an All- I
Something-or-Other team which j
cannot be called a mythical team.
This year's All-Coast quintet is

RECENTLY Ex Committee made
{ a few slight but very welcome
changes in the requirements for a
varsity track award. In the past a
cinderman has been required to
place against the tough competition
of either California, U.S.C., in the
Pacific Coast Conference or in the
National Collegiates. And, oh yes, if
I he was a member of a world record
j breaking relay team at the Fresno
Relays, he would be given a letter.
But this was awfully tough. For
instance ,a few years ago a pole
vaulter, if he tied up against Cali
fornia, would be out of luck for
U.S.C. had three men who could
do 14-4. Even this year an aver
age half-milcr would have to place
against the Trojans or else, for C'al
is supposed to have the tremen
dous total of 8 men who can do
1:54.
But all this is changed. Accord
ing to the new requirements, points
against U.C.L.A. have been included

j dual meets — those with San Jose

dian cagers were picked by the
coaches of the Southern Division of i
the Pacific Coast Conference as the
best ball players in the conference
for their respective positions!
And what a contrast this is to
last year's selections. Remcmber
—though the Cards finished up in
second place, not a single mem
ber of the team was named
Coast.
Last season the coaches completely I
ignored Stanford's most deserving i
hoopster, Co-captain Kenny David- i
son, who scored more points in a !
season of conference competition
than any guard has ever scored,
finishing third in the scoring race.

B UT those Indians just couldn't ;
be denied this season. For in- |
stance, last year, when Donnie Wil- |
liams lost his eye after going on !
several scoring sprees in the earlier j
games and when Fordy Anderson up j
and came down with pneumonia in |
the middle of the conference race. J
U.C.L.A.'s Jackie Robinson, high
scorer in the conference, was made
an All-Coast forward, along with
U.S.C.'s Ralph Vaughn.
But this year, with "Willie"
hitting consistently throughout
the season and with Fordy healthy
and faster and trickier than ever,
the Bruins' dusky Mr. Robinson,
despite the fact that he was the
Coast's high scorer, had to be sat
isfied with second-string All -
Coast.
* * *
T CAN just hear the moaning that
is going on over at Berkeley or !
down south on the U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. campuses at this unprece
dented but very logical selection of
an All-Coast team.
But I think I can find several good
reasons why the coaches would make
such a choice. In the first place, the
Indians have won 22 out of their 25
ball games. In the second place, four
Cards were among the top six high
scorers in the conference. And in
the third place and more important
in the eyes of a coach attempting to i
pick an All-Something team, the In- j
dians made each other look good with
well executed blocks or quick pass
off s.
And in the fourth place I scrim
maged against them three times a !
week.
And by the way, this is the first j
time I have ever heard of an All- I
Something-or-Other team which j
cannot be called a mythical team.
This year's All-Coast quintet is
Stanford's basketball team—just as
real as the Hoover War Libe.

RECENTLY Ex Committee made
{ a few slight but very welcome
changes in the requirements for a
varsity track award. In the past a
cinderman has been required to
place against the tough competition
of either California, U.S.C., in the
Pacific Coast Conference or in the
National Collegiates. And, oh yes, if
I he was a member of a world record
j breaking relay team at the Fresno
Relays, he would be given a letter.
But this was awfully tough. For
instance ,a few years ago a pole
vaulter, if he tied up against Cali
fornia, would be out of luck for
U.S.C. had three men who could
do 14-4. Even this year an aver
age half-milcr would have to place
against the Trojans or else, for C'al
is supposed to have the tremen
dous total of 8 men who can do
1:54.
But all this is changed. Accord
ing to the new requirements, points
against U.C.L.A. have been included
and if a trackster makes a total of 7
points in collegiate competition, not
\ including the relays nor practice
j dual meets — those with San Jose
S State or Fresno State—he earns him-
I self a letter.
