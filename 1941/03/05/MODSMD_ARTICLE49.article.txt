# Standing Room Only

### 
AT times, nothing is so irking as an adminis
trative administration.
One ot those times arose last week in the
minds of Stanford students when their Admin
istration announced that henceforth —and that
probably means forever more—the short dead
end tributary of Escondido Road touching the
English Corner would be reserved for faculty
parking.
No Stanford students allowed.
Reactions were immediate and in the ex
pected vein. These students felt that the Ad
ministration had become too administrative and
that their right of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of a parking space near the English Corner had
been obscured by an undemocratic and dis
tinctly preferential move.
Now another such move has been made. Few
of these students are yet aware, but all will soon
become conscious of the fact that beginning as
of yesterday another section at English Corner
has been set aside under glaringly obvious yel
low signs which read "Faculty Parking Only."
This section extends from the Ride-to-Paly tree
opposite English Corner, about 75 yards along
in front of the Administration Building, to the
beginning of the oval.
Reactions to this second "inclosure" will be
immediate and in the expected vein.
But, not to coin a phrase, the mills of God
grind slowly but they grind exceedingly fine.
And, things oft are not what they seem. Such
is the case here.
The complaining cry has gone up that granting
these few parking spaces to the faculty will
prove of little real value to the faculty and will
prove only a pitfall in the path of those numeri
cally stronger students who will be attempting
to find a parking spot in order to make their
8 o'clocks on time. Haven't the faculty already
been given exclusive rights to the lot behind the
Education Building? the cry goes on.
But the cry is not well taken. Numerically
speaking, these exclusive faculty spaces, 33 by
the count, scarcely dent the total number of
parking spaces open to the Campus around
that area. A count taken around the oval, on
the near streets in front of the Memorial Thea
ter, and in the Library lot shows that students
still have well over 350 stalls which they may
use. This means that student parking around
English Corner has been thinned by less than
10 per cent. From the remaining spaces, it is
just a few steps and as many breathless pants
farther to immediate classrooms.
And if those 8 o'clocks are elsewhere on the
Quad, there are other parking areas nearer to
those classes.
But why was this unexpected move taken in
the fifst place? The answer is simple and sane,
and surprising in that it has not been made long
before.
There are many Stanford and out-of-town ad
ministrative officials who have business in
and about the Administration Building. But their
day is not gauged by 8 and 9 o'clocks. They
must come and go many times during the day.
And in the past, they have usually found all
parkings already stocked with student cars.
So these men have been forced to park where
they could, somewhere in the foggy distance on
the far side of the oval.
Each time, their walking to the Administration
Building has meant the loss of many valuable
minutes with their integral dollars and cents.
So these few spaces have been reserved. At
second glance Stanford students should see it
as a considered rather than inconsiderate move.
