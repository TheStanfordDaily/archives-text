STUDENTS on the Quad yesterday walked up
to members of Excom and asked what the
special meeting last night was about.
"Special meeting?" wondered Excom mem
bers. "It's no different from any other."
"Then why did The Daily say the meeting
was open to all students?"
No, the meeting wasn't extra-special.
Nor did The Daily butch the story.

Excom meetings, in which the elected repre
sentatives of the campus hash over questions
and problems with varying intensity and vo
ciferousness, are all open to the general stu
dent public.
The heavy panel door of their Tuesday eve
ning meeting room is never locked. And any
student with particular interest in any phase of
the Excom docket is always cordially invited
to attend.
Ex Committee's docket is always available in
Tuesday morning's Daily.
Rather than discouraging visitors to their
meetings, Excom, this year especially, has al
ways welcomed strangers at their Tuesday eve
ning sessions. The voice of the campus, always
a hallowed thing in committee decisions, be
comes doubly strong when delivered first hand.
Excom is frequently on the pan in student
gossip circles. Sometimes deservedly and
sometimes not.
There's a remedy for that. With Excom meet
ings an open-door proposition, student reactions
to situtions of interest should come before the
committee hands down a decision. Post-meet
ing gripes too often show a forcible trend of
campus opinion too late.
So The Daily will continue to print in each
Tuesday morning's paper:
