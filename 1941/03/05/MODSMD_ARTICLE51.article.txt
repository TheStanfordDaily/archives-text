### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
A WORLD THEY NEVER MADE
two socially-concious freshmen who
went on a week-end slumming party have touched
off what papers love to call "a sweeping investigation."
Whatever the result may be, the current expose has
made it clear that a situation needs correction.
A lot of people are on the spot. And a lot of goats
are going to take the rap when the investigation gets
under way.
One wonders how many actual vagrants have been
knocked around before the cops happened to pick two
University students who had access to means of pub
licity and the backing of responsible and prominent
leaders. This is a little commentary on the American
myth of ""equality of opportunity."

JT IS strange, too, how values alter under the pres
sure of situations. If the beating the two frosh re
ceived had come from a Stanford fraternity brother in
stead of a San Francisco flat-foot, no one would have
worried much about it.
Of course those things don't happen any more in a
well - regulated, Interfraternity Council - controlled
world. But they have happened,' and they've been
passed off with a "aren't those fraternity men rough,
but kids-will-be-kids" shrug. It didn't really make
any difference about a few scars among friends, as
long as everyone was cementing "the bond" which ex
ists between men of the Row.

W/E haven't talked to the men who were involved,
but our sympathies lie with their side of the ar
gument. We can't help feeling, though, that the situa
tion was not as beautifully simple as it has been
painted. We have a sneaking hunch that the Stanford
men gave the Irishmen a little back-talk. We have a
feeling, too, that they were "out to see the masses"
and this seems, to us, an unwholesome way to inves
tigate any social problem.
You must be in sympathy with a class to under
stand the conditions under which its people are forced
to live. Inspired by Western Civ and a burning pas
sion for social reform, two Encinamen went out to
look at "the other half." Probably they were sincere,
but possibly they just couldn't forget that they were
moving in a world that was not theirs and which
could no touch them, secure as they were in their Palo
Alto stronghold. Anything they said or did wouldn't
matter; they could step out of the picture and catch
a Greyhound down the Peninsula.
Maybe they learned how it is.
