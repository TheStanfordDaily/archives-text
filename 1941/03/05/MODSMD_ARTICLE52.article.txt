LOCK-OUT SLIP-UPS

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Can't something please be done about this lock
out system? We don't mind being locked in Saturday
night if we get a lockout—we expect it. But. when we
receive a Saturday night lock-in for blowing out a
candle in Roble's dining room, we think things are
being carried a little too far.
Lock-ins are supposed to be penalties for violations
of social late leaves, not punishments for violations of
"Emily Post." Couldn't some more fitting fine be im
posed to keep the totally different crimes distinct?
Also, there have been a few slips on the part of
the Committee of Five in their measures of lock-out
penalties. Now, we realize that it is a hard job and
most of us are glad we aren't on the committee, but,
when we receive the same lock-in for forgetting to
sign in as for getting in 15 minutes late, it doesn't
seem fair.
If this continues, people might begin to disregard
the importance of a lock-out and the whole value
would be lost. So couldn't there be a little revision
in the penalties?

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
This is to express my sympathy for poor Mr.
Chandler, whose whole evening was spoiled by "a few
orchestral butches" at the concert Sunday night. My!
Mr. Chandler must have a fine sensitive soul! I wish
that I and my friends had more music appreciation so
that we, too, could have had a positive reaction when
that trombone slipped, but we, tragic as it may seem
to an expert like Mr. Chandler, could only half smile
in amused sympathy. Perhaps we had heard that the
trombonist had been very ill for days previous to the
concert and was playing on nerve alone.
But Mr. Chandler must have received some enjoy
ment from the concert, because he states that Victor
Herbert's prelude to "Natoma" filled in very well for
about ten minutes, and even managed to sound the
way a symphony should." Perhaps if Mr. Chandler
will continue to encourage the symphony in this way
and point out more of its potentialities, Mr. Monteux
will not have to end it all; but only be careful in the
future not to present "weak-voiced sopranos."
Cheer up, though, Mr. Chandler, because even if
you didn't enjoy the concert, your article on it was
very good. Your crisp sentence, "Speaks sang again,"
was too clever; and your scintillating remarks on "Our
Love" and "William Tell" were just too, too trite.
It is indeed unfortunate that a few reporting butches
had to come, for they spoiled an otherwise enjoyable
Daily.

LOCK-OUT SLIP-UPS

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Can't something please be done about this lock
out system? We don't mind being locked in Saturday
night if we get a lockout—we expect it. But. when we
receive a Saturday night lock-in for blowing out a
candle in Roble's dining room, we think things are
being carried a little too far.
Lock-ins are supposed to be penalties for violations
of social late leaves, not punishments for violations of
"Emily Post." Couldn't some more fitting fine be im
posed to keep the totally different crimes distinct?
Also, there have been a few slips on the part of
the Committee of Five in their measures of lock-out
penalties. Now, we realize that it is a hard job and
most of us are glad we aren't on the committee, but,
when we receive the same lock-in for forgetting to
sign in as for getting in 15 minutes late, it doesn't
seem fair.
If this continues, people might begin to disregard
the importance of a lock-out and the whole value
would be lost. So couldn't there be a little revision
in the penalties?

YOU NASTY MR. CHANDLER

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
This is to express my sympathy for poor Mr.
Chandler, whose whole evening was spoiled by "a few
orchestral butches" at the concert Sunday night. My!
Mr. Chandler must have a fine sensitive soul! I wish
that I and my friends had more music appreciation so
that we, too, could have had a positive reaction when
that trombone slipped, but we, tragic as it may seem
to an expert like Mr. Chandler, could only half smile
in amused sympathy. Perhaps we had heard that the
trombonist had been very ill for days previous to the
concert and was playing on nerve alone.
But Mr. Chandler must have received some enjoy
ment from the concert, because he states that Victor
Herbert's prelude to "Natoma" filled in very well for
about ten minutes, and even managed to sound the
way a symphony should." Perhaps if Mr. Chandler
will continue to encourage the symphony in this way
and point out more of its potentialities, Mr. Monteux
will not have to end it all; but only be careful in the
future not to present "weak-voiced sopranos."
Cheer up, though, Mr. Chandler, because even if
you didn't enjoy the concert, your article on it was
very good. Your crisp sentence, "Speaks sang again,"
was too clever; and your scintillating remarks on "Our
Love" and "William Tell" were just too, too trite.
It is indeed unfortunate that a few reporting butches
had to come, for they spoiled an otherwise enjoyable
Daily.
