## 
### 
Frank Walker, financial vice
president of the University, said
yesterday that "owing to the con
tinued growth of responsibilities in
connection with the supervision of
the University's outside properties
and of the campus police force" it
has been deemed advisable to re
arrange the duties of Mr. Fred
Frehe.
"Effective March 5, Mr. Frehe will
devote his time exclusively to the
outside properties, while Mr. Gor
don Davis will supervise the cam
pus police activities," Mr. Walker
declared.
Lemon, cherry, and chocolate are
the favorite flavors, in order, for
cokes ordered at the Union Cellar.
