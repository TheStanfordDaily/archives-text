Know Your Bookstore
By August of 1900 the Stanford Bookstore was very much
a going concern, having paid off considerable of its in
debtedness and greatly increased its sales. Indeed it was
in this year that Miss Frances Layes was retained as book
keeper and secretary, not only because of her charm and
ability but because she owned her own typewriter. This
was a redoubtable instrument called a Blickerisdorfer.
You see, although the Bookstore had progressed, it did
not feel that it could yet afford the expense involved in
the purchase of a typewriter.
