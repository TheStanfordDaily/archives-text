"What's in a Name?"
The Hard of Avon was right about the rose — its name
is unimportant. But if he'd had anything to do with
naming telephone exchanges, he'd have learned a lot!
Names must be easy to pronounce and transmit—must
not look or sound like other exchange names — must
not use the same dial linger spaccs.
Take MUIR and OTTS, for example. Fine!—except
they dial alike! For the first two letters of each appear
in the same finger spaces on the dial.
Often hundreds of names are listed, studied, discarded
before one is found that meets all requirements. Suclt
care in every phase of licll System work helps to make
your telephone service the world's finest.
Why nottelephone home often? Long Dis
tance rates to most points are lowest any
night after 7P. M. and all day Sunday. f§( IHTW& V]
