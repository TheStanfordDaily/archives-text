IN DEALING with world events,
History tries each day to cover
what it considers the most important
occurrences. This fact does not im
ply a lack of interest in other world
shaking situations. It is just an at
tempt to discuss the thing that is
going to shake the world soonest.
Lately emphasis has been on the
Balkans and the Far East. True,
Italian forces are still taking a
healing from both the Greeks and
the British. Bomber and fighter
planes are winging over England
and the continent day and night.
Miillions are living underground,
because their homes are gone or
unsafe. In the United States, the
vital Aid to Britain bill is the ob
ject of one of the fiercest Senate
lights in our time.
Tension in the Balkans is just as
high as it was yesterday, and the
Far Eastern situation is unlovely, as
usual. But today Washington and
London quietly took the spotlight.

the Houses of Parliament yes
terday, the British legislators
voted an appropriation of $400 to be
used l'or "many more ships and a
great number of men" to challenge
Adolf Hitler's bid for a showdown
struggle in the war at sea.
The sum of $400 seems infinites
imal, but it was only a "token"
appropriation. The actual sum,
unknown even to the men who
voted on it, was fabulous. At the
time the measure was passed, the
members were told of a new Nazi
weapon—swarms of tiny "suicide
submarines" intended to seriously
cripple British shipping.
These "minnows," manned by pa
triotic young Nazis, will dart out
from their bases and hit at all ship
ping near the British Isles. The
chances of survial for these men
will be about 500 to 1.

Lord of the Admiralty A. V.
Alexander told the Commons
that "the battle of the Atlantic is
opening," and added that "in facing
this battle we need every ounce of
our workers' energy and ever-in
creasing production."
Alexander's picture of British
shipping losses was not as black
as the Germans have painted it.
He said Nazi claims of British
merchant ships lost were about
double the actual total, "which is
3,000,000 tons." New shipping ac
quired abroad and seized from the
enemy has replaced more than
two-thirds of the shipping lost in
German attack.
In Washington the lend-lease bill
moved into the Senate amendment
session, as Senator Allen J. Ellen
tier, D., La., proposed that the bill
be changed so that it would not per
mit the use of American troops out
side of this hemisphere.

this proposal will do, if
passed, is to register the Sen
ate's opposition to such action. As
commander-in-chief of the nation's
armed forces, President Roosevelt
can at any time dispatch an expe
ditionary force abroad. Ellender fa
vors the legislation anyhow.
The administration, however, is
opposing the amendment because
"it would be a blow to British
morale and would encourage
Japan's campaign in East Asia.
Ellender says it will "allay the
fears of millions of American
mothers."
Administration leaders, headed by
Senator Barkley of Kentucky admit
the vote will be close. Administra
tion polls show that at present the
pros have 50 to 55 votes. A Senate
simple majority, all that is required,
is 48.
Speed—a thing hard to achieve in
the only legislative chamber in the
world where you can talk your head
off if you want to is essential to
getting the bill passed. Pressure
groups are eating away at that ma
jority.
