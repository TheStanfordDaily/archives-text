## 
### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
Commenting on the sale and ex
hibit of Labrador handicraft that is
to be held tomorrow from 10 to 6
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse,
Dr. Wilbur yesterday recalled his
friendship with the late Sir Wilfred
Grenfell.
"I've known him a number of
years. He visited the University
twice in times past, and always had
an enthusiastic response from this
community."
MEDICAL SERVICE
Referring to the work of the
Grenfell International Committee,
which is carrying on the work of the
great medical missionary in Labra
dor and North Newfoundland, Dr.
Wilbur continued.
"His work was a combination of
medical service and social service
for people living under primitive and
difficult conditions, so his success in
building up an effective organization
hag made a public appeal far beyond
the size of the project and number
of people involved."
FORTY YEARS' SERVICE
Dr. Grenfell first went to Labra
dor 40 years ago, when he was
freshly graduated from the Univer
sity of London. He had sailed with
a British hospital ship to spend the
summer treating the natives of
Labrador.
fie found a country of 4500 na
tives, mostly of Scotch-Irish de
scent with a few Eskimos. The peo
ple had no money, their only worldly
goods and sources of income were
fishing equipment. Due to deficien
cies in their diet they were plagued
with tuberculosis, scurvy, anemia,
beri-beri.
From this first year, Dr. Grenfell
adopted "the land that God gave to
Cain" as his own, and devoted the
remainder of his life to giving hope
and help to an isolated and neglected
people in a rut of economic stagna
tion.
Tomorrow's sale of handicraft
made by these Labrador fisher folk
is sponsored by the Grenfell Indus
trial Association, an organization
devoted to helping the natives aug
ment the meager income, so that
they can purchase neded medicine
and supplies to combat these de
ficiency diseases. Miss Catherine
Vaughn, the Grenfell worker in
charge of the campus display, will
be assisted by the Social Service
Group of the "Y."
California is first among the 48
States in rural electrification.

a British hospital ship to spend the
summer treating the natives of
Labrador.
fie found a country of 4500 na
tives, mostly of Scotch-Irish de
scent with a few Eskimos. The peo
ple had no money, their only worldly
goods and sources of income were
fishing equipment. Due to deficien
cies in their diet they were plagued
with tuberculosis, scurvy, anemia,
beri-beri.
From this first year, Dr. Grenfell
adopted "the land that God gave to
Cain" as his own, and devoted the
remainder of his life to giving hope
and help to an isolated and neglected
people in a rut of economic stagna
tion.
Tomorrow's sale of handicraft
made by these Labrador fisher folk
is sponsored by the Grenfell Indus
trial Association, an organization
devoted to helping the natives aug
ment the meager income, so that
they can purchase neded medicine
and supplies to combat these de
ficiency diseases. Miss Catherine
Vaughn, the Grenfell worker in
charge of the campus display, will
be assisted by the Social Service
Group of the "Y."
California is first among the 48
States in rural electrification.
Commenting on the sale and ex
hibit of Labrador handicraft that is
to be held tomorrow from 10 to 6
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse,
Dr. Wilbur yesterday recalled his
friendship with the late Sir Wilfred
Grenfell.
"I've known him a number of
years. He visited the University
twice in times past, and always had
an enthusiastic response from this
community."
MEDICAL SERVICE
Referring to the work of the
Grenfell International Committee,
which is carrying on the work of the
great medical missionary in Labra
dor and North Newfoundland, Dr.
Wilbur continued.
"His work was a combination of
medical service and social service
for people living under primitive and
difficult conditions, so his success in
building up an effective organization
hag made a public appeal far beyond
the size of the project and number
of people involved."
FORTY YEARS' SERVICE
