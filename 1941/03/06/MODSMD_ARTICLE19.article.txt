# Forum Considers Role Of Stanford Students In Emergency Program
## President Wilbur Outlines Campus Activities During Last World War; Panel Presents Student Viewpoint 
### 
A statement by Boh I'cckham, Forum chairman, that the average Stan
ford student wants to play his part in the national defense program, but
has little idea of how he can he of most value to his country, began last
night's Foruin meeting on the role of the college student under the Selec-

'tivc Service Act.
In his introductory speech, Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur outlined the sys
tem of co-ordinating college and
military training which was em
ployed at Stanford during the last
war. He stated that engineering and
medical students were "protected"
in the 1917-18 period, and suggested
that some such program might be
worked out in the present emer
gency.
ONE-THIRD UNFIT
Dr. Charles Edward Shepard of
the Men's Health Service gave a
brief informal talk, stating that one
third of all Stanford students eli
gible for the draft have been found
physically unfit under the severe
examinations of the draft board.
With that encouraging news, the
student panel, under the direction
of Bill Turner, chairman of the
Student Defense Council, presented
a discussion on "What we can do to
help the national defense program,
and at the same time utilize the
educational facilities acquired at
Stanford."
TERRY VIEWPOINT
Sid Terry, president of Tau Beta
Pi, presented the position of engi
neering students. He said, "Nobody
is to be exempt in the draft, but the
student who is learning an occupa
tion which may be useful to the
country may be deferred."
John Moore, president of Inter
faith Council, presented the views
of conscientious objectors, and em
phasized that they were willing to
serve in any way that would not
constitute a violation of their prin
ciples.
Dan Hays, substituting for Sher
man Mellinkoff, stated that medical
students were in much the same po
sition as engineers, but that "most
authorities feel that the worth of the
medical student in the draft is insig
nificant compared to the worth to
the national defense program if he
is allowed to finish his training and
go into the medical service."
Betty Avery discussed women's
role in national emergencies. Wom
en, she declared, should keep the
home and community together
while men are away at battle.
RESERVES CHANCES
Opportunities in the army, navy,
and air reserves were discussed by
Bill Kimball, cadet major in the
Stanford R.O.T.C. He outlined ways
in which a student may avoid be
ing a buck private, through special
training in one of these services.
Bob Newell, speaking for social
science majors, emphasized the op
portunities available in the intelli
gence service and the supply de
partment.
The program, which was present
ed under the joint sponsorship of
the Stanford Forum and the Student
Defense Council, was concluded by
an informal question session.
