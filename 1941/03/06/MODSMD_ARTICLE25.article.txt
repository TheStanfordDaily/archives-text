# Stanford Art Patron Dies
## 
### 
Albert M. Bender, a patron of the
arts and contributor of many val
uable collections of books to several
university libraries, died in San
Francisco at the age of 74 after a
life spent in spreading cultural ben
efactions and humanitarianism.
Bom in Ireland, he became an
American citizen in 1889, rising from
an errand boy in an insurance com
pany to the owner of his own com
pany. The profits of his success
were poured lavishly into art treas
ures, libraries, charitable organiza
tions, and many other philanthropic
channels.
On February 1940, Stanford rec
ognized Mr. Bender's friendship to
the University in presenting numer
ous collections of first and limited
editions to the Rare Book Room, by
renaming it the Albert M. Bender
Room. He presented thousands of
rare books to other universities,
among them six thousand rare edi
tions, invaluable manuscripts, and
rare examples of fine printing to
Mills College.
Mr. Bender's studio was a veri
table museum which attracted visi
tors and friends from all over the
world. His wealth of knowledge, his
famous art collections, and his gentle
engaging manner brought rich and
poor alike into his presence. He was
a member of cultural organizations
all over the United States and in
Europe.
