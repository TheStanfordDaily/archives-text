# Sun Too Late To Save Fair
## Event to Hibernate Until Spring Quarter 
### 
It's all over, but there wasn't any
shouting. The weather man said
"Rain all week" so Women's Con
ference said "No County Fair." Then
the sun came out, as it has a way
of doing at just the wrong moment,
and everyone realized what a dirty
trick had been played. And there's
no one to blame.
So all the paraphernalia has been
tied up and put away until some
time during spring quarter. The
white fences are stacked at the Corp
Yard; the balloons, which luckily
weren't blown up, are stored on top
shelves; the crepe paper streamers
have been rewound and stored care
fully in boxes.
POSTERS NOT USABLE
The posters and telephone cards
on which Janice Bradbury and her
committee did such a fine job will
be preserved until someone can fig
ure out how to overcome the slight
difficulty of the prominently printed
"March 6."
All orders for pickles, potato
chips, hot dogs, and such have been
cancelled. Auction merchandise has
been returned to the Palo Alto mer
chants who donated it.
STYLES TO BE CHANGED
The Fashion Show models, who
had spent tedious hours enduring
fittings, returned all clothes to the
Palo Alto stores who contributed
them. When spring comes around,
the styles will have changed.
The tickets have been marshalled
back to the fold. A Roble freshman
has sold $8 worth.
So the County Fair is tied up and
put away in moth balls until some
sunny day in spring quarter and
the hard-working committee chair
men have recovered from the first
awful shock and gone back to the
term papers and the "thousand
pages of reading due Monday."
