### 
In response to nationwide alarm reverberating from the alleged heat
ing of two Stanford freshmen hy uniformed officers of San Francisco's
police force, Chairman & Raymond Murphy of the County Grand Jury
police committee yesterday told The Daily his committee would meet
last night at 8 o'clock to decide whether it will open an investigation.

Resultant was not available to
the press at deadline.
Asked what action might be taken,
Mr. Murphy replied, "It's hard say
ing." He said he knew of no similar
case previous to the one now pend
ing the recovery of the youths in
the Palo Alto Hospital.
Foreman Jeremiah Sullivan of
the San Francisco Grand July
turned the case over to Mr. Mur
phy and his committee for investi
gation yesterday.
OFFICERS DENY
Injured students are Carter Bar
ber and Donald Allan, 18-year-old
Encinamen, who toured the city's
"skid row" on what they claim was
a "sociological experiment'* Sunday
night. The two charge "unmerciful
beating without provocation" by
sub-station police following arrest
for vagrancy.
They will appear at San Fran
cisco's South Station, where they
say the slugging occurred, Friday
at 3:30 o'clock to attempt identifi
cation of their attackers from among
12 uniformed policemen. All offi
cers who were on duty deny knowl
edge of any such "beating" as
charged.
DEPUTY INTERVIEWS
Deputy Chief Michael Riordan,
who will serve as prosecutor if
charges are filed before the police
commission, came to the campus
yesterday with Dr. John Graves,
San Francisco police surgeon, and
Supervising Captain Arthur Chris
tiansen to interview the youths.
Christiansen said, "The injuries
appear less serious than had been
reported. Although I haven't seen
the X-rays, only one of the boys
appears to have a broken nose."
BROKEN NOSE, TOOTH
Dr. Graves said Allan had a bro
ken nose and a blood clot on the
right shin. Barber had a chipped
tooth and a black and blue spot on
his upper right thigh, and both had
blackened right eyes.
"I think the principal thing is for
the boys to identify the policeman
who they say beat them up," Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur said yes
terday upon his return, delayed by
heavy weather, from the Southland.
CHANCE TO CLEAR
"I think it's pretty clear what
should be done if they (the boys)
can make the identification," Dr.
Wilbur continued. "The police
should be given first chance to
clear themselves of the charges."
Dr. Wilbur had not seen the boys or
talked with Dean of Men John
Bunn, who spoke for the University
in the President's absence, previous
to making this statement.
Dr. Blake Wilbur, attending phy
sician to the youths, said yesterday
through his secretary, "They arc
getting along all right; yes, they're
perfectly all right." Asked if this
meant the boys are fully recovered,
she replied, "Well, practically."
Dr. Wilbur said Tuesday night
the two would be out of the hospital
in "two or three days."
