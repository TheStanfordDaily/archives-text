# Paly Draft Board To Furnish 6 Men
## 
### 
In line with the new system of
apportioning quotas to local draft
boards determined by the number
of 1-A men rather than total num
ber of registrants, the Palo Alto
Board No. 112 will furnish only six
men for the fourth call.
In addition to the large number
of students deferred until the end
of Spring Quarter, this board has a
large number of men who have not
yet gone through the physical ex
amination. Other boards who had a
large number of men already classi
fied as 1-A got larger requests for
men in this latest call.
