# Indians Face St. Mary's In CUBA Diamond Opener
## 
### 
It's St. Mary's "luck of the Irish" versus Stanford's up-and-coming
varsity as the long-awaited C.1.8.A. season finally gets under way today
on Sunken Diamond at 3:30 o'clock. Veteran Cootie Thompson will oppose
the Phoenix from the mound with Jack Randall working behind the plate.
Sophomore fast hall artist Wes Bailey will pitch for the Moragans.

Coach Harry Wolter's campaigners
have come through a long, slightly
water-logged practice season with
only two losses, those .to Kenealy's
Seals, and the victory margins were
only one run in both games. In
eluded in the Indians' scalp belt are
wins over Bank of America, 13-4,
San Jose State, 5-2, and Kenealy's,
2-1.
OUT FOR REVENGE
The Cards are out to avenge a
triple loss to St. Mary's suffered last
year, and indications shown out on
Ihe field in practice yesterday find
the Redshirts ready to go in all de
partments.
Back from last year's squad,
playing for the first time this sea
son, is catcher Jack Randall. Ran
dall is filling in the backstop job
for Ace Hanlon, injured first-string
catcher. Herb Atkinson, second
string receiver, may see action to
day, but Randall will start.
Ray Hammett and Hal Costello are
still battling for the opening berth at
first base and either may get the
call. In the outfield Cookie South
may go after a few with Wolter's
three regulars. Clark Graham, Alec
Cereghino, and Bob Ditlevson. The
rest of the line-up remains the
same.
50-50 CHANCE
You never can tell what's going to
happen in a baseball game, and it's
entirely possible that tJie Indians may
take the cue from their champion
ship football and basketball breth
ren and really go after the Coast
title. By the looks of the workouts

the past few days the possibility has
at least a 50-50 chance of actually
happening.
St. Mary's, on the other hand,
comes up year after ypar with
steady, hustling clubs and will be
one of the toughest of all the teams
the Indians must meet during the
season.

have come through a long, slightly
water-logged practice season with
only two losses, those .to Kenealy's
Seals, and the victory margins were
only one run in both games. In
eluded in the Indians' scalp belt are
wins over Bank of America, 13-4,
San Jose State, 5-2, and Kenealy's,
2-1.
OUT FOR REVENGE
The Cards are out to avenge a
triple loss to St. Mary's suffered last
year, and indications shown out on
Ihe field in practice yesterday find
the Redshirts ready to go in all de
partments.
Back from last year's squad,
playing for the first time this sea
son, is catcher Jack Randall. Ran
dall is filling in the backstop job
for Ace Hanlon, injured first-string
catcher. Herb Atkinson, second
string receiver, may see action to
day, but Randall will start.
Ray Hammett and Hal Costello are
still battling for the opening berth at
first base and either may get the
call. In the outfield Cookie South
may go after a few with Wolter's
three regulars. Clark Graham, Alec
Cereghino, and Bob Ditlevson. The
rest of the line-up remains the
same.
50-50 CHANCE
You never can tell what's going to
happen in a baseball game, and it's
entirely possible that tJie Indians may
take the cue from their champion
ship football and basketball breth
ren and really go after the Coast
title. By the looks of the workouts

the past few days the possibility has
at least a 50-50 chance of actually
happening.
St. Mary's, on the other hand,
comes up year after ypar with
steady, hustling clubs and will be
one of the toughest of all the teams
the Indians must meet during the
season.
