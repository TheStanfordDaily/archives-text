, "YESTERDAY gave a faint indica
tion that the rainy weather was
over for a while and with the re
turn of the sun came mutterings of
activity among those sports which
thrive on plenty of sunshine.
Out on the baseball diamond yes
j terday the Stanford nine went
through its longest drill of the sea
[ son. working out for almost three
hours in preparation for its confer
! ence opener with St. Mary's today
i at 3:30 o'clock on the Farm field.
Once again the Cards enter the
conference season with plenty of
optimism. But this year things
look brighter than ever before.
There's the brilliant and depend
| able Cootie Thompson heading a
pitching slafi that is not entirely
j barren of support.
Behind Cootie are right-handers
Phil Wolfe, a fast developing sopho
more, and Claude Purkitt, the pow
erful senior speed ball artist who is
gradually acquiring a little control,
and left-handed Russ Smith, who
has improved a hundred per cent
over last year.
Last year the Indians would have
done well enough on Thompson's
pitching alone if they could have
only hit now and -then. Who will
ever forget that one-hitter Cootie
i lost to U.C.L.A. 3-2 last spring?
Coach Harry Wolter has half a

I dozen potential hitters to back up
| Thompson's hurling this season.
There are veterans Alec Cereghino,
! center field. Monte Pfyl, short-stop,
Hal CostHlo, first base, and Elton
j Boone, third base.
The newcomers who are liable
to supply the hitting power to lift
the Indians from a so-so team into
a 'J ampioivihip outfit are Ace
Hanlon, who has filled in behind
i the plate and does a good bit of
hitting besides, two sophomore
| cut fielders, Clark Graham and
i Carl Kcllenberger, and Botch Ca
! ruso. another hard-bitter, at sec
ond base.

LITTLE warm weather is going
j x to do the track team loads of
j good.
The coming warm weather will
: enable them to go to work for the
I second annual California-Stanford
Relays on March 22.
Of course the Indian trackmen
j aren't the only ones who have suf
fered because of the continual bad
J weather. Rain in the bay area and
I in Southern California, of all places,
j for the past month has kept Cali
fornia and Trojan run-and-jump

pitching slafi that is not entirely
j barren of support.
Behind Cootie are right-handers
Phil Wolfe, a fast developing sopho
more, and Claude Purkitt, the pow
erful senior speed ball artist who is
gradually acquiring a little control,
and left-handed Russ Smith, who
has improved a hundred per cent
over last year.
Last year the Indians would have
done well enough on Thompson's
pitching alone if they could have
only hit now and -then. Who will
ever forget that one-hitter Cootie
i lost to U.C.L.A. 3-2 last spring?
Coach Harry Wolter has half a

I dozen potential hitters to back up
| Thompson's hurling this season.
There are veterans Alec Cereghino,
! center field. Monte Pfyl, short-stop,
Hal CostHlo, first base, and Elton
j Boone, third base.
The newcomers who are liable
to supply the hitting power to lift
the Indians from a so-so team into
a 'J ampioivihip outfit are Ace
Hanlon, who has filled in behind
i the plate and does a good bit of
hitting besides, two sophomore

i Carl Kcllenberger, and Botch Ca
