# Mural Cinder Meet to Take Spotlight Today
## 
### 
II - the .skies remain clear, the an
nual intramural track finals, post
poned six times, at last will be run
off today at 4 o'clock on Angcll
Field, according to Bert Pike, mural
manager.
If it rains today, the meet will be
definitely postponed until early next
quarter.
Off the basis of the trials held
two weeks ago, Sigma Nu and the
Firehouse should fight it out for top
honors. Johnny Silva, carrot-topped
Sigma Nu sprinter, ran away with
his 100 and 220 dash trials in 10.4
and 23.6 seconds, respectively, and
is favored to cop both sprints today.
With Vaughn Brown of Sequoia
and Pete Gadd and Monte Pfyl of
the Firehouse all looking good in
the trials, the hurdle races today
should be close.
