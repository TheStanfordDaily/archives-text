# Frosh Trackmen To Face Modesto
## 
### 
Another change was made yester
| day in ihe Stanford freshman track
team's opening 1941 meet with the
withdrawal of Sacramento Junior
College from the scheduled three
way contest Saturday among Stan
ford, Modesto J. C., and Sacra
mento.
Since they would meet Modesto
later in league dual competition, the
Capital City cinder men decided not
to compete against them Saturday.
However, if clearing skies continue,
j the frosh will face the Modesto
i Buccaneers here as scheduled.
Modesto, known for its strong
j track squads, should offer Coach
i Clyde Jeffrey's promising freshmen
plenty of competition. A pair of Ha
waiian half brothers, Sam and Ed
Johnson, who between them have
broadjumped 23 feet 11 inches and
23 feet 4, run the 100 in 9.9 and
I 10.0, and pole vaulted 13 feet 4
I inches, head the Modestans.
