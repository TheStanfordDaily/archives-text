## 
### 
After whipping through a fast
practice last night, Stanford's var
sity and reserve rugby squads will
put the finishing touches on their
preparations for the Cal games to be
played in the Stanford Stadium next
j Saturday afternoon.
Two star players, Frankie Albert
and A1 Cole, were missing from last
night's workout with minor in
juries, but are expected to be in
suit for today's final drills. The re
i turn of Albert will probably shoot
I the odds on the Indians to even
more in their favor, for without his
services last Saturday they managed
to whip the University Club fifteen
by a 23-3 score.
"Squad pictures will be taken
' this aflernoon at 4 o'clock," an- j
nounced Advisory Coach Harry Ma
| loney. "All men expecting to play !
