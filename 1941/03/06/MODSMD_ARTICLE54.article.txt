# The 						Boiling Pot
## 
### 
SOMETIMES the mildewed axiom "A watched
pot never boils" doesn't work.
A pot brimming with charges of brutality on
the part of San Francisco's police force is being
closely watched by Bay Area citizens—and the
pot's just about ready to boil over.
And no matter which way it pours, it's bound
to be hot for someone.
Someone is going to be on the spot.
Last night the police committee of the San
Francisco County Grand Jury convened to de
termine whether or not the case warranted in
vestigation. At the time of writing, the meeting
had not yet adjourned.
Two courses were open to the committee.
Either they could throw the case out; or they
could open a full-fire search of the police set-up
in the city.
If they chose the former, which is hardly pos
sible, they are warmly and firmly on the spot.
And if they elected to open the investigation
it means that several other parties are eligible
for the griddle.
It could be Chief Dullea. With the first serious
scandal since his accession to the position on
tap, Dullea faces a serious test of his discipline.
Or it could be one or more of the nine police
officers who were on duty at the south side
station last Saturday evening. Should the com
mittee and Chief Dullea force the investigation
it would be impossible for any guilty officer to
escape.
Or it could be Don Allan and Carter Barber.
According to newspaper accounts this morn
ing, high officials in the department stated that
unless the two Stanford freshmen positively
identified an assailant the case would neces
sarily be thrown out of court.
Which, if followed through, would leave the
two Stanford boys faced with the proof of the
pudding.
Which makes it difficult to follow the logic
of official reasoning.
There were nine men on duty that evening.
Certain can be ruled out —either because of
their official positions or because of their loca
tion during the hour and night in question.
Which narrows it down plenty. Which makes
it difficult to understand just how police could
consider the case a closed book unless positive
identification by Barber and Allan is made.
Yesterday afternoon a police official "grilled"
(to use the term applied in evening dispatches)
the two boys in their Stanford hospital room.
The same official was named prosecuting at
torney, the man who will handle the case for
the boys when and if the case comes to open
trial.
Yes, there are many people on the spot. And
the watched pot is getting hotter.
