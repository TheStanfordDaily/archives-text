# The
						Worry Wart
## 
### 
A BOTHERSOME wart on a finger can be
quickly and logically remedied by cutting
out the growth. There is also a more effective
and more rapid method of remedy. Axe off the
whole finger with a well-aimed slash of a
butcher's cleaver.
The latter treatment is, of course, foolhardy
and beyond the bounds of intelligent compre
hension. And yet, last Sunday night at the San
Francisco student "pop" concert, many Stan
ford students cut off the entire finger.
At chain store prices they plunked in their
money to be in on an experiment, the materiali
zation of well-considered and well-intentioned
efforts on the part of Stanford, the University
of California, and a Mills minor minority, to
present a student-prepared, student-auditioned
"pop" concert.
If this experiment was received favorably,
music-minded agents from these three institu
tions planned further promotion, with their goal
set at a series of such concerts in the future.
As the school boy says, "Warts just happen."
And some of those warts, in the form of an un
avoidable off-color trombone passage and a few
bars of unsymphonic symphony, just happened
during the program.
In the blast of a ten-minutes-to-deadline Daily

review and many unconsidered, spur-of-the-mo
ment remarks, out came the butcher's cleaver
and off came the whole finger.
Now what are those music-minded agents to
think? Somewhere in the San Francisco Opera
House last Sunday night, operatic big-wigs were
watching carefully for signs of favorable stu
dent reaction. If our experiment worked, they
planned to attempt the same thing at colleges in
the East. Reading and listening to comment
made regarding the expernment, they may have
become discouraged. What are they to think?
Let us think for them and for those local music
appreciators who hope to see their experiment
become a practice. Their idea is sound. With
a few exceptions it was warmly welcomed.
Since Sunday, many students have expressed
the view that this symphony has served a very
definite need, that it should be continued.
Perhaps it is too late. Perhaps there will be
no more symphonic slips because there will
be no more symphony. Perhaps there will be
no more warts because there is no more finger.
Perhaps, however, the cleaver did not cut all
the way through, and the finger may knit.—B. A.
