NOT TO EAT, NOT FOR LOVE
JDEOPLE used to save tinfoil in large rolls. They
were always ripping the lining out of candy wrap
pers and cigarette packages. Someone on Executive
Committee decided this might be a new way to gather
coins for the Convalescent Home. Everyone would
save tinfoil and drop it in a big box in the Union.
It seems that this procedure had been followed once
before, in the dimmer regions of Farm history. Some
one remembered this and called Dr. Mitchell, who
said he thought maybe Mrs. Timothy Hopkins could
shed some light on the practice. Mrs. Hopkins said she
didn't know much about the tinfoil, but recalled that
it had never been sold.
So Mrs. Hopkins looked around the house and dis
covered 1500 pounds of tinfoil in the cellar. It seems
Mr. Hopkins, being a shrewd business man indeed, had
investigated the market price of tinfoil and found that
it sold at 2 cents a pound. This, to Mr. Hopkins, didn't
represent an equitable price.
Thereupon he carted the tinfoil into the basement
and began a waiting campaign. The price and Mr.
Hopkins both were stubborn. And the tinfoil is still
there.
The current quotation on tinfoil, after lo these
many years, is—2 cents a pound.

autumn you and you and you will be pay
ing $3 across the board for a library fee. If you
are happy at this prospect, walk up to the periodical
room and ask for the back file of any large American
daily. You will not get it. You may not even look at
it unless you bear a note signed and countersigned by
every important personage who lives on the Farm.
You will also be happy to know that, denied this
first-hand source material from date-lined stories, you
may resort to only one weekly news magazine for
material. If you think news is reported accurately,
completely, and curtly, so the slogan goes, by this
magazine, you will not be disappointed. But if you
sometimes question its coverage, you are just out of
luck.
So you had better resign yourself to subscribing to
the New York Times, Newsweek—and paying your
$3 on time.
