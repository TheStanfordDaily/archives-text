SINCERELY, ALBERT GUERARD

r fHE EDITOR, SIR:
Congratulations for reprinting Allen Drury's edi
torial. It impressed me so much that I felt moved to
write to him. I thought you might be interested in
seeing a copy of the letter.
Sincerely yours,
Albert Guerard

I was deeply impressed with your editorial, re
printed in today's issue of The Stanford Daily. You
are right: we must look beyond blinding hate as well
as beyond unrealistic selfishness. The problem, as you
say, is to build a just and lasting peace. We had to
face exactly the same issue twenty-four years ago.
We chose the right path, in a crusading spirit (again
I am alluding to your article), and we did make a
definite beginning. We secured the acceptance by the
belligerents of a world organization through which all
the imperfections of the treaty could easily have been
corrected. But, through the hysteria of blind political
hatred, and through the narrowness of false patriotism,
men like Henry Cabot Lodge, Hiram Johnson, Wil
liam Randolph Hearst killed the Wilsonian promise of
"a just and lasting peace." We could not expect Eu
rope or Asia to believe in it after we, its sponsors,
had rejected it. The world is paying for the folly of
these few men. For twenty years, propagandists sold
us the idea that America had been trapped into a
futile war; whereas we went into it with our eyes
open, and it was they who made it futile. We are
now waking to the realization that we can never have
peace except in an organized world. This you clearly
see, and your attitude is constructive. We may have
to fight: but it must be for rebuilding the world. And
we must see to it that the Johnsons and the Borahs of
our own days do not again make the sacrifice fruitless.
With sincere congratulations and sympathy,
Yours very truly,
Albert Guerard

ORCHIDS TO OPINION

THE EDITOR, SIR:
I think that the Campus Opinion column in The
Stanford Daily is very worth while. I have never
written to it before; however, the letter signed by
A.K.D., '41, in regards to the Document Room in our
library deserves an answer.
In the first place, I think that the worthy contrib
utor would have enough self respect to refrain from
admitting that in three years at Stanford he had
never been in the Document Room. Certainly it does
not speak well for his intellectual pursuits. The docu
ment collection here at Stanford is a source of envy
to several universities on the Pacific Coast.
Miss Stillman and her assistant in the Document
Room are two of the most co-operative librarians that
I have known.
If A.D.K. had taken the trouble to approach the
situation rationally with the librarian, instead of hur
rying home to write a letter, he would have learned
that a regulation in regards to old newspapers is
necessary; since they can not be replaced. Every uni
versity library that I know of—which is six in num
ber—has a similar regulation.
The Stanford library is a good one and I object
to the inferences that the letter published in The
Daily places on it.

rope or Asia to believe in it after we, its sponsors,
had rejected it. The world is paying for the folly of
these few men. For twenty years, propagandists sold
us the idea that America had been trapped into a
futile war; whereas we went into it with our eyes
open, and it was they who made it futile. We are
now waking to the realization that we can never have
peace except in an organized world. This you clearly
see, and your attitude is constructive. We may have
to fight: but it must be for rebuilding the world. And
we must see to it that the Johnsons and the Borahs of
our own days do not again make the sacrifice fruitless.
With sincere congratulations and sympathy,
Yours very truly,

ORCHIDS TO OPINION

THE EDITOR, SIR:
I think that the Campus Opinion column in The
Stanford Daily is very worth while. I have never
written to it before; however, the letter signed by
A.K.D., '41, in regards to the Document Room in our
library deserves an answer.
In the first place, I think that the worthy contrib
utor would have enough self respect to refrain from
admitting that in three years at Stanford he had
never been in the Document Room. Certainly it does
not speak well for his intellectual pursuits. The docu
ment collection here at Stanford is a source of envy
to several universities on the Pacific Coast.
Miss Stillman and her assistant in the Document
Room are two of the most co-operative librarians that
I have known.
If A.D.K. had taken the trouble to approach the
situation rationally with the librarian, instead of hur
rying home to write a letter, he would have learned
that a regulation in regards to old newspapers is
necessary; since they can not be replaced. Every uni
versity library that I know of—which is six in num
ber—has a similar regulation.
The Stanford library is a good one and I object
to the inferences that the letter published in The
Daily places on it.

r fHE EDITOR, SIR:
Congratulations for reprinting Allen Drury's edi
torial. It impressed me so much that I felt moved to
write to him. I thought you might be interested in
seeing a copy of the letter.
Sincerely yours,
Albert Guerard

I was deeply impressed with your editorial, re
printed in today's issue of The Stanford Daily. You
are right: we must look beyond blinding hate as well
as beyond unrealistic selfishness. The problem, as you
say, is to build a just and lasting peace. We had to
face exactly the same issue twenty-four years ago.
We chose the right path, in a crusading spirit (again
I am alluding to your article), and we did make a
definite beginning. We secured the acceptance by the
belligerents of a world organization through which all
the imperfections of the treaty could easily have been
corrected. But, through the hysteria of blind political
hatred, and through the narrowness of false patriotism,
men like Henry Cabot Lodge, Hiram Johnson, Wil
liam Randolph Hearst killed the Wilsonian promise of
"a just and lasting peace." We could not expect Eu
rope or Asia to believe in it after we, its sponsors,
had rejected it. The world is paying for the folly of
these few men. For twenty years, propagandists sold
us the idea that America had been trapped into a
futile war; whereas we went into it with our eyes
