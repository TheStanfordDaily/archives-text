# 'Bride' Opera Cast Sparkles In Rehearsal
## 
### 
Bedrich Sinctana's best known
work, "The Bartered Bride," ambi
tiously attempted this quarter by
the Stanford Players and the Divi
sion of Music, went through dress
rehearsal in the auditorium of Me
morial Hall last night and reflected
a great deal of the work and en
thusiasm of four men.
Dr. Herbert Jan Popper has for
quite a while had visions of an en
tirely college-produced opera, and
is assisted by F. Cowles Strickland
with the staging, Ferenc Molnar
with the orchestra, and Joel" Carter
with the chorus.
In the first act, as in the whole
opera, the heavy romantic interest
is carried very well by Marjorie
Benson and Antonio Rovano. Keith
Allen, Joel Carter, and Harold Mil
len carried the comedy more than
ably, assisted by Edith Strickland.
Costuming was done superbly, as
was the direction of the dances.
Dancers in the polka were elabo
rately costumed, while Joel Carter
gives the best comedy scene of the
entire show. Playing the part of a
girl-shy stutterer, he carries out the
part to its fullest extent, even to the
point of making his bow tie wiggle
up and down in front of his with
every word he utters.
The circus scene, done from a
large wagon pulled onto the stage
by the villagers, is good, and the
acrobatic, staged and directed by
Harry Muheim, should come in for
their share of the praise. Especially
so in the case of Dana Winters as
the strong man, a role to which he
gives the full "Winters business."
