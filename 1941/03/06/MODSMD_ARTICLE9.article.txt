# Dorothy Maynor Makes Coast Debut in Memorial Hall, 8:30
## 
### 
Tonight at 8:.'50 o'clock Dorothy Maynor, famed negro soprano, will
present the premier concert of her first Pacific Coast tour here in the
Memorial Auditorium under the auspices of the Stanford Concert Scries.
This is the third of the 15>40-41 series. Tickets may still be obtained in
the Concert Scries office in Old Union and at the box office tonight.

An unknown singer two

Koussevitzky, conductor of the Bos
ton Symphony Orchestra. Kousse
vitsky, surprised at the power of
her voice and her careful diction,
gave her a chance to perform before
members of his orchestra and music

critics. Since then she has risen to
the top of the music world, and has
become one of the most applauded
singers in Eastern music circles.
Miss Maynor was born in Norfolk,
Va., the daughter of a Methodist
minister. She began her musical
training singing in her choir and
continued in the Hampton Institute,
graduating when she was 14. She
made her first public appearances
touring Europe with the Institute as
a member of their famous negro
chorus.
Dorothy Maynor's entire life has
been dedicated to music. Not the
least of her interest is directed
toward the spirituals of her own
deep South.
With the remarkable range of her
voice she is able to sing clear, op
eratic arias, and deeply intoned
spirituals with equal success. There
is very little, if any, trace of that
inherent southern accent left in her
voice. Her diction is one of her out
standing points and she is able to
sing with equally as much ease in
French and German as in English.
Accompanied by Arpad Sandor at
the piano, Miss Maynor will present
the following program tonight, de
