I |URING the coming days when
Stanford is battling its way
through finals and enjoying a sun
kissed vacation-recovery, the sundry
festering regions of the globe will
probably become even more infected
—and more contagious.
With the advent of spring and
good weather, wars pick up mo
mentum like business at the boat
house and a young man's fancy.
This column will appear again on
April 1. But its writer has no
hope that the information it will
contain on that date will be April
fooling.
With the aid of a crystal ball,
most available information, and
some garden variety wish-thinking,
it is possible to be optimistic about
the eventual outcome of the present
mess. But any diagnosis of the sit
uation, with due consideration of all
the symptoms, is bound to be nega
tive.

|>ROBABLY the first explosion will
come in the Balkans, although
it is possible that the Fuehrer may
be concentrating attention there so
that he can take Britain off her
guard. Perhaps, a three-way offen
sive will be launched—with Hitler
taking on the British Isles, com
bined Nazi and Italian troops driv
ing through the Balkans toward
Suez, and Japan attempting a knock
out over Britain in the South China
Sea area.
None of these things may hap
pen during the next 21 days, but
the possibility is there. Certainly
there is no chance of an ease-off
in the tension. Hitler must strike
somewhere this spring. He
premised his people that the war
would be over last year.
He'll have to get going pretty soon
in order to take advantage of the
improved battle conditions. If he
doesn't another whole year will be
wasted, and the British blockade is
a very effective weapon.

for the first time,
the Nazi pattern of strategy in
the Balkans began to take clear
shape. On the verge of closing up
the last gap in his "encirclement"
plan, Hitler again put the heat on
England's only two remaining Eu
ropean allies, Greece and Turkey.
Jugoslavia will probably sign up
with the Axis some time within
(he next 18 hours. What else could
>ihe do? She is completely sur
rounded by countries under Nazi
domination.
Hitler has invited a high Turkish
statesman to visit Germany and dis
cuss "closer collaboration" with the
Axis. Turkey has heard of that one
before . . . and, according to the
latest reports, she isn't going to ac
cept the invitation.
■is * *
(he Balkans and the Far
East, Britain now has another
worry to keep her awake. It seems
evident that Hitler is trying to gain
a foothold in French North Africa,
and might be readj®to seize France's
vital bases there such as Bizerte.
Somebody is worried about some
thing, because General Maxime
Weygand, chief of half a million
Frenchmen, arrived in Vichy from
Algiers under "mysterious circum
stances" yesterday.
Another "mysterious" gct-to
gcthcr happened yesterday when
General Nuri Es-Said, foreign
minister of Iraq (Mesopotamia)
arrived in Cairo. Anthony Eden
is still in Cairo. Probably Es-Said
didn't make the trip from Bagdad
to Cairo for a change of air.
In this country, famous old Gen
eral David Barrows, past president
of U.C., and (he man whose Poli Sci
courses still wow the Cal student,
called for an "immediate show- I
shown" with Japan. He thinks wc
should move now before we get
into the European tea-fight. General
Barrows feels that "if Japan risked
her battle fleet in engagements with
our own . . . the Japanese fleet would
be destroyed."
