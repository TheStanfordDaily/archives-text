many committee heads for the an
nual Convalescent Home Drive,
scheduled from April 18 to 25. These
recommendations will result in the
appointment of more than a hundred
committee members to assist in this
years' drive.
"But," in the words of Graham
Barbey, drive chairman, "many of
these appointees will be freshmen,
transfers, or persons to whom the
purpose of Convalescent Home Week
is unfamiliar. An explanation is
needed to avoid confusion on their
part after their appointment."
Goal of the drive is to supply
funds for the support of the Con
valescent Home on the northeast
corner of the campus. The Home
provides care and treatment for
many children recovering from se
rious operations, who, without such
assistance, would be unable to af
ford the costs of hospital bills,
