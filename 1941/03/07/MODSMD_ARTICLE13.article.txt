# Men Must File Room Changes
## 
### 
Men students living in Toyon,
Branner, Sequoia, or Encina who
plan to change their residence for
Spring Quarter should call at the
Dean of Men's office any afternoon
before March 15 to receive refund
authorizations for room deposits. No
refunds will be made after that date.
This is made necessary by the new
annual reservation system started
last spring. Reservations are made,
on payment of a $10 deposit for a
certain room for the entire year.
This deposit applies on the Spring
Quarter rent if the room is kept for
the whole school year.
This new system does away with
the old quarterly renewal of room
option and the quarterly $5 deposit.
Only students planning to change
rooms must notify the dean's office.
