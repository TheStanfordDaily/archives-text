## Grand Jury Promises Investigation If Stanford Frosh Are Successful In Picking Out 'Guilty' Officers 
### 
If the two Stanford freshmen who heatedly claim they were beaten
and slugged by San Francisco police can identify their assailant t!iis
afternoon at 3::i0 o'clock, the County Grand Jury will launch an investiga
tion at its next Wednesday meeting.
This was a statement direct to The Daily made yesterday by E. Ray-

Murphy, chairman of the
Grand Jury's police committee.
''As soon as they accuse some
body (in person) we can go ahead,"
Mr. Murphy said. The two Encina
men, Carter Barber and Don Allan,
leave Palo Alto Hospital this morn
ing at 11 o'clock for the city, where
they will attempt identification at
South Station this afternoon.
UNMERCIFULLY BEATEN'
The pair claim they were unmer
cifully beaten following arrest for
vagrancy while making the rounds
on "skid row" early last Sunday
morning. Attempt at identification
has not been possible until this time
because of injuries sustained, which
kept the students in the hospital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Michael
Riordan and Supervising Captain
Arthur Christiansen were engaged
yesterday in a search for witnesses
who might throw light on the charge
facing the police department.
Over 100 vagrants and drunks
were questioned yesterday, and four
were found who were in Southern
Station at the time of the alleged
beating.
DIDN'T SEE BLOOD
Frank Romano, 40, serving a 30-
day sentence for vagrancy, said, "The
boys did not complain to me about
a beating, nor did I see any blood."
Abe Beyer, 52, apartment house
owner, 1240 Grove Street, was quot
ed as having heard "a lot of screams
at Southern Station about 3:30 last
Sunday morning," had not been
questioned.
Police Surgeon Dr. John Graves,
who examined the youths at the
local hospital Wednesday, reported
that he found the injuries less se
vere than previously indicated. X
ray pictures were taken, and a re
port will be made at a later date,
possibly today.
INJURED THIGH
Dr. Graves said Barber had a
black and blue mark on his right
thigh, a swollen tipper lip, part of a
tooth out, and a bruised nose. Allan
has a broken nose, a blood clot on
his shin, and a black eye.
The lads claimed there was no
provocation for the beating with
night sticks, which they say occur
red in Southern Station, before they
were transferred in a patrol wagon
to City Prison.
They said the only statement which
might have aroused anger of the
policemen was when one of them
said, "Take a good look at us."
San Francisco papers immediately
picked up the story and carried front
page stories and editorials early this
week stating that Police Chief
Charles Dullea faced the first se
rious threat of scandal since his in
ception as head of the department.

This was a statement direct to The Daily made yesterday by E. Ray-

Murphy, chairman of the
Grand Jury's police committee.
''As soon as they accuse some
body (in person) we can go ahead,"
Mr. Murphy said. The two Encina
men, Carter Barber and Don Allan,
leave Palo Alto Hospital this morn
ing at 11 o'clock for the city, where
they will attempt identification at
South Station this afternoon.
UNMERCIFULLY BEATEN'
The pair claim they were unmer
cifully beaten following arrest for
vagrancy while making the rounds
on "skid row" early last Sunday
morning. Attempt at identification
has not been possible until this time
because of injuries sustained, which
kept the students in the hospital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Michael
Riordan and Supervising Captain
Arthur Christiansen were engaged
yesterday in a search for witnesses
who might throw light on the charge
facing the police department.
Over 100 vagrants and drunks
were questioned yesterday, and four
were found who were in Southern
Station at the time of the alleged
beating.
DIDN'T SEE BLOOD
Frank Romano, 40, serving a 30-
day sentence for vagrancy, said, "The
boys did not complain to me about
a beating, nor did I see any blood."
Abe Beyer, 52, apartment house
owner, 1240 Grove Street, was quot
ed as having heard "a lot of screams
at Southern Station about 3:30 last
Sunday morning," had not been
questioned.
Police Surgeon Dr. John Graves,
who examined the youths at the
local hospital Wednesday, reported
that he found the injuries less se
vere than previously indicated. X
ray pictures were taken, and a re
port will be made at a later date,
possibly today.
INJURED THIGH
Dr. Graves said Barber had a
black and blue mark on his right
thigh, a swollen tipper lip, part of a
tooth out, and a bruised nose. Allan
has a broken nose, a blood clot on
his shin, and a black eye.
The lads claimed there was no
provocation for the beating with
night sticks, which they say occur
red in Southern Station, before they
were transferred in a patrol wagon
to City Prison.
They said the only statement which
might have aroused anger of the
policemen was when one of them
said, "Take a good look at us."
San Francisco papers immediately
picked up the story and carried front
page stories and editorials early this
week stating that Police Chief
Charles Dullea faced the first se
rious threat of scandal since his in
ception as head of the department.
If the two Stanford freshmen who heatedly claim they were beaten
and slugged by San Francisco police can identify their assailant t!iis
afternoon at 3::i0 o'clock, the County Grand Jury will launch an investiga
tion at its next Wednesday meeting.
