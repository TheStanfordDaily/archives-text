# FARM PROFESSORS APPROVE CODE
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Stanford's Honor Code has been
and is succcssful and is vastly su
perior to the proctor system believe
Farm faculty members.
Of the cross-section of professors
interviewed last night by The Daily,
the honor code was praised without
exception, although several cited
the need for improvement along
some lines.
The following are representative
statements of faculty members,
when asked their opinion of the
honor code.
Dr. Lewis M. Terman, Psychology:
"I have had no unpleasant expe
rience with it. Nor have I heard any
psychology professors complaining
about it in the last two or three
years, although some time back
there were several suspicious inci
dents that I knew of."
Dr. Carl F. Brand, History:
"In the 17 years I've taught at

Stanford, I am unaware of any vio
lation in my classes."
Dean Marion R. Kirk wood, Law:
"We have had an honor code in
the law school for 40 years, while
the University has had it only since
the War. During all this time it has
worked very well."
Dr. Bayard Q. Morgan, German:
"I have not known any failures at
all in the code. After teaching at
Wisconsin for many years—under a
different system, Stanford's honor
code has brought me much pleas
ure. I found a different atmosphere
here. One who has never been in
the other atmosphere doesn't realize
the amazing difference."
Dr. Elmer I). Pagan, Economics:
"Although I never stay in the
classroom, naturally, I am inclined
to believe it is being observed and
is working very well."
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, Journalism:
"It is very successful. The frater
nity houses, however, ought not keep

term papers and the like to be cop
ied from time to time. This, I think,
is a violation."
Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, Education:
"As compared with other institu
tions, the code is relatively success
ful here."
Dr. Everett Hall. Philosophy:
"After teaching in another uni
versity, I recollect the sense of dis
trust between the faculty and stu
dents under the proctor system.
This develops because the professor
has to patrol the classrooms. There
is a tremendous advantage in the
spirit that exists here."
Professor James Wells, civil engi
neering:
"I have never had occasion to
question the honor code. Perhaps
there is cause to question the code
in lower division classes and in
other schools where students are
just after a 'degree,' but certainly
not in my department."
Dean John Bunn:

"The honor code is the basis on
which all successful student govern
ment must be built. It entails the
acceptance on the part of the stu
dents of both a personal and group
responsibility. It is the failure in
the exercise of the group responsi
bility that our honor code has re
cently received some criticism. As
evidence of this fact, it is rather
startling to realize that practically
all code violations during recent
years have been brought to light
through faculty rather than student
initiative.
"It is fortunate that we have been
aroused to realize this trend before
we have lost the value of one of
the greatest of our institutions. I
have faith in the integrity of our
student leadership and feel sure that
the honor code will come out of I
this challenging period a stronger, ;
more vital, and conscious part of our i
campus life."

"In the 17 years I've taught at

Stanford, I am unaware of any vio

Dean Marion R. Kirk wood, Law:
"We have had an honor code in
the law school for 40 years, while
the University has had it only since
the War. During all this time it has
worked very well."
Dr. Bayard Q. Morgan, German:
"I have not known any failures at
all in the code. After teaching at
Wisconsin for many years—under a
different system, Stanford's honor
code has brought me much pleas
ure. I found a different atmosphere
here. One who has never been in
the other atmosphere doesn't realize
the amazing difference."
Dr. Elmer I). Pagan, Economics:
"Although I never stay in the
classroom, naturally, I am inclined
to believe it is being observed and
is working very well."
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, Journalism:
"It is very successful. The frater
nity houses, however, ought not keep

term papers and the like to be cop

is a violation."
Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, Education:
"As compared with other institu
tions, the code is relatively success

Dr. Everett Hall. Philosophy:
"After teaching in another uni
versity, I recollect the sense of dis
trust between the faculty and stu
dents under the proctor system.
This develops because the professor
has to patrol the classrooms. There
is a tremendous advantage in the
spirit that exists here."
Professor James Wells, civil engi
neering:
"I have never had occasion to
question the honor code. Perhaps
there is cause to question the code
in lower division classes and in
other schools where students are
just after a 'degree,' but certainly
not in my department."
Dean John Bunn:

"The honor code is the basis on
which all successful student govern
ment must be built. It entails the
acceptance on the part of the stu
dents of both a personal and group
responsibility. It is the failure in
the exercise of the group responsi
bility that our honor code has re
cently received some criticism. As
evidence of this fact, it is rather
startling to realize that practically
all code violations during recent
years have been brought to light
through faculty rather than student
initiative.
"It is fortunate that we have been
aroused to realize this trend before
we have lost the value of one of
the greatest of our institutions. I
have faith in the integrity of our
student leadership and feel sure that
the honor code will come out of I
this challenging period a stronger, ;
more vital, and conscious part of our i
campus life."

Of the cross-section of professors

the need for improvement along
some lines.
The following are representative
statements of faculty members,
