# Row House Is Penalized By Council
## 100 Hours Assessed As Unit to Fraternity For Rule Violation 
### 
A "certain fraternity" was found
guilty of a violation of A.S.S.U. so
cial regulations yesterday by Men's
Council and assessed 100 hours of
work to be completed not later than
May 1, four weeks after the start
of spring quarter.
Council met in extraordinary ses
sion yesterday afternoon to take
final action on the case.
Stressed in the decision was the
fact that should the hours not be
completed by deadline, the "certain
house" will be denied all social
functions during the academic year
1941-42.
HOUSE FINED AS UNIT
The 100 hours were assessed the
house as a unit, and may be worked
off in any manner the house sees fit.
Also on the docket in yesterday's
meeting was recognition of a re
quest for extension of time on the
part of the 24 Stanford frosh who
were given 30 hours apiece for their
part in the Cal-Stanford raids. The
frosh were given until May 1 to
complete the penalty.
"They've only had six clear days
to work this quarter," said Chair
man Hugh O'Donnell. "It wasn't
possible to complete the hours."
PARKING VIOLATIONS
Stan Owen, Council member, also
stressed the new faculty parking
zones on English corner, saying that
students apparently are not well
aware of the new zones.
"The signs there are perfectly
clear," he said, "but we've got'en
lots of gripes in spite of them."
Regarding the fine assessed the
"certain fraternity," Council stated
that investigation during the past
several days had shown that the
social regulation had definitely been
broken.
VIOLATION VERY EVIDENT
Member Jess Hazlett stated that
"we were hesitant to crack down on
theni for the mere spirit of the
law.' He said that there was no
question of the violation.
The social regulation in question
was that which states that:
(1) No campus living group may
hold an off-campus dance without
clearing a date through the A.S.S.U.
(2) No campus living group may
hold a dance with an open bar on
the premises.
