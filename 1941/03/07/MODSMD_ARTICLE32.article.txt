# Grenfell Art Benefit Sale Set Today
## Labrador Handicraft Offers Ski Apparel, Other Native Wares 
### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
A 30-foot dogwhip was brandished
through the Daily Shack last night,
as Business Manager Frank Bush
pursued Managing Editor Janny
(iuuld into her ollice in Clark Ga
hlish fashion.
The whip is the property of Miss
Elizabeth Crandall, Lagunita direc
tor, who used it on dog-team trips
during her 13-month stay in Labra
dor as a volunteer worker with the
Grenfell medical mission.
The whip, made of green and
tanned seal skin, is an example of
the type of work that will be on
sale and display today in the Wom
en's Clubhouse from 10 to 6 o'clock.
The sale of handicraft, the work of
Labrador fisher folk, is under the
auspices of the International Gren
fell Association.
FUR-EDGED PARKAS
Articles on sale include fur-edged
parkas (known as "dickies," and
worn by native Labradorites when
crossing the country on snowshoes
or by dog team), knitted mittens and
socks, jewelry of Labradorites, a
semi-precious stone of a blue shade,
skin boots, and carved ivory figur
ines. Also for sale will be hooked
rugs and woven articles.
Though the opportunity to use
wearing apparel made for a country
where a 30-below-zero temperature
is ordinary would seem scarce in
sunny California, Miss Crandall
mentioned yesterday that the "dick
ies" are very popular at American
ski resorts this year, and the mit
tens and socks are also good ski
fashion.
MISS VAUGHN DIRECTS
Proceeds of the sale, directed by
Miss Catherine Vaughn of the Gren
fell Labrador Industries, will be
used for the support of the organi
zation that is providing a means of
subsistence for a people whose
source of income was cut off by the
war.
When Labrador's great benefac
tor, the late Sir Wilfred Grenfell,
first visited its isolated coasts in
1893, he found a people entirely de
pendent on the fishing industry. Dr.
Grenfell alleviated their desperate
plight by the establishment of a
community handicraft industry, but
with the advent of the war the men
were enlisted in the navy, particu
larly on mine sweepers, and the
people seem likely to be reduced to
the miserable existence they suf
fered before Dr. Grenfell went there.
Before his death in October of
last year, Dr. Grenfell explained
their situation.
TOURIST TRADE COLLAPSES
"Every able-bodied man has en
listed in the British navy," he said,
and the women can't run the fish
ing schooners. Moreover, tourist
trade has collapsed, so they no
longer have a market for their won
derful handicraft."
Because of this situation, Grenfell
headquarters in New York this year
has decided to create a market for
and make people conscious of these
Labrador products. Miss Vaughn is
touring the country with a station
wagon of these articles, and her
visit to Stanford marks one of the
first times the West Coast has had
an opportunity to inspect and buy
these products made in fishermen's
homes of these subarctic coasts.
The social service group of the
"Y" and Miss Crandall will assist
Miss Vaughn at tomorrow's sale.

has decided to create a market for
and make people conscious of these
Labrador products. Miss Vaughn is
touring the country with a station
wagon of these articles, and her
visit to Stanford marks one of the
first times the West Coast has had
an opportunity to inspect and buy
these products made in fishermen's
homes of these subarctic coasts.
The social service group of the
"Y" and Miss Crandall will assist
Miss Vaughn at tomorrow's sale.
A 30-foot dogwhip was brandished
through the Daily Shack last night,
as Business Manager Frank Bush
pursued Managing Editor Janny
(iuuld into her ollice in Clark Ga
hlish fashion.
The whip is the property of Miss
Elizabeth Crandall, Lagunita direc
tor, who used it on dog-team trips
during her 13-month stay in Labra
dor as a volunteer worker with the
Grenfell medical mission.
The whip, made of green and
tanned seal skin, is an example of
the type of work that will be on
sale and display today in the Wom
en's Clubhouse from 10 to 6 o'clock.
The sale of handicraft, the work of
Labrador fisher folk, is under the
auspices of the International Gren
fell Association.
FUR-EDGED PARKAS
Articles on sale include fur-edged
parkas (known as "dickies," and
worn by native Labradorites when
crossing the country on snowshoes
or by dog team), knitted mittens and
socks, jewelry of Labradorites, a
semi-precious stone of a blue shade,
skin boots, and carved ivory figur
ines. Also for sale will be hooked
rugs and woven articles.
Though the opportunity to use
wearing apparel made for a country
where a 30-below-zero temperature
is ordinary would seem scarce in
sunny California, Miss Crandall
mentioned yesterday that the "dick
ies" are very popular at American
ski resorts this year, and the mit
tens and socks are also good ski
fashion.
MISS VAUGHN DIRECTS
Proceeds of the sale, directed by
Miss Catherine Vaughn of the Gren
fell Labrador Industries, will be
used for the support of the organi
zation that is providing a means of
subsistence for a people whose
source of income was cut off by the
war.
When Labrador's great benefac
tor, the late Sir Wilfred Grenfell,
first visited its isolated coasts in
1893, he found a people entirely de
pendent on the fishing industry. Dr.
Grenfell alleviated their desperate
plight by the establishment of a
community handicraft industry, but
with the advent of the war the men
were enlisted in the navy, particu
larly on mine sweepers, and the
people seem likely to be reduced to
the miserable existence they suf
fered before Dr. Grenfell went there.
Before his death in October of
last year, Dr. Grenfell explained
their situation.
TOURIST TRADE COLLAPSES
"Every able-bodied man has en
listed in the British navy," he said,
and the women can't run the fish
ing schooners. Moreover, tourist
trade has collapsed, so they no
longer have a market for their won
derful handicraft."
