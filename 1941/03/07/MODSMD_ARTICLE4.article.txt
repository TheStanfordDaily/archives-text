## 
### 
Dr. Hendrik Dam, great Danish
biochcmist, and discoverer of Vita
min K, will speak here next Mon
day. March 10. The lecture will be
held in the bacteriology lecture room
at 4:15 o'clock, preceded by a tea
at 4 o clock, and is open to students,
faculty and visitors.
The subject of Dr. Dam's lecture
will be "A Survey of the Present
State of Knowledge on Vitamin K,"
a subject on which he is the world's
foremost authority. This vitamin is
essential for the development of
adequate coagulability in the blood,
a property which is of utmost im
portance to the organism, since it
prevents the leakage of blood
through minute breaks in the cir
culatory system or loss of blood
lrom wounds.
It was discovered originally
through the development of a
hemorrhagic condition in chicks
maintained on an inadequate diet;
and it can be isolated from spinach,
alfalfa, and fish meal.
Dr. Dam is a member of the fa
mous Copenhagen school of scien
tists. Since 1929 he has been Asso
ciate Professor of the Biochemical
Division of the University of Co
penhagen, and is now on a leave of
absence, lecturing in the United
States and Canada under the aus
pices of the American-Scandinavian
Foundation.
The lecture will be held jointly by
Sigma XI, the Biological Sciences
Seminar, the Chemistry Seminar,
and the Physiology Seminar.
