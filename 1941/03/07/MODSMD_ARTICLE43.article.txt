### CHUCK SMITH 
Y E STERDAY morning Stanford's
basketball coach, Everett Dean,
left for Pullman, Wash., and a quick
look-see at a Washington State
quintet that has burned up the
Northern Division of the Pacific
Coast Conference and meets those
flying all-All-Coast Indians next
wee k in the Coast playoffs.
The general facts known about
this Cougar team weren't sufficient
to satisfy Mr. Dean. Sure, we all
know they've won their last 12 ball
games against competition just as
tou;;h as California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A.
We also know that they have a
world of height. To be specific,
Paul Lindemann, their center, is
(»-i'ect-7, their forwards, Dale
Gentry, a former footballer, and
Vera Butts, are both fi-feet-3. The
two guards are somewhat smaller,
Captain Ray Sundquist at (i-fect-l
and Kirk Gebert, 5-feet-!).
According to Seattle newspaper
men who saw the Cougars take two
games from the home team, Wash
ington's Huskies, "They (W.S.C.)
have a world of drive. They have
size and range, they shoot well, pass
accurately, and are smart."
* * *
r S'HOSE are big words but only
vague generalities to Stanford's
"Gentleman from Indiana." He al
ready knows they must be all of
what the northern papers say about
them to have gotten as far as they
have.
But Mr. Dean felt it was worth
his while to leave his team for four
days to watch the Cougars in their
once crucial but now only conven
tional games with Oregon State.
He'll be on the look-out for a
hundred-and-one little details which
will help Stanford in the play-offs.
Do the Cougars play a tight man-to
man defense or do they shift off
often? If they shift do they get
caught up in blocks easily? Or do
they use a zone defense which
slacks off to the weak side?
How does thjrir giant center
respond to fakes; does he overplay
the man lie is guarding and will
Don Burness be able to leave him
on a quick cut to the bucket? Do
any of the Cougars have outstand
ing weaknesses 011 defense such as
taking their eyes off their men or
loafing back on defense after los
ing possession of the ball?
The answers to all these questions
will help Doan formulate his team's
offense for the coming play-offs. As
for choosing the best kind of de
fense to stop the Cougars, Dean will
be taking mental notes on their
offense.
Do they like to work the ball in
close with a lot of drive and quick
passoffs for a shot or do they fire
long and depend on their height to
get rebound shots? Do they employ
any fast breaks or do they play de
liberately?
Which of the Cougars is a dan
gerous set shot? Do they try blocks
to set up their shots? Is a certain
man strong with one hand and in
clined to go to that direction or is
he deadly with either hand? By
knowing these facts Dean will be
able to hand out the guarding assign
ments and build his defense for the
team as a whole accordingly.
It's all in the business of coach
ing, to analyze your opponent, pick
out his weak points and capitalize 011
them, as well as to determine his
best offensive weapon and make
plans to stop it. And so the prac
tice of scouting has grown into a
science.
For your information Washington
State had two men scouting the
Cards in their last two California
games.
* in *
r^ IHE1HE Farm almost had the oppor
tunity of seeing the nation's best
high hurdler in action tomorrow.
But no soap, for Sacramento Junior
College has informed the B.A.C,
they will not be present for Satur
day's scheduled triangle meet with
the Stanford freshmen and Modesto
Junior College.
You see, Negro Joe Batiste is
Sacramento's high hurdler. Last
summer as only a high school boy
from Tuscon, Arizona. Batiste ran
the highs in 14.1 in the A.A.U. to
beat such big names as Wolicott
of Rice and Towns of Louisiana.
By the way, Stanford's own track
coach, Franklin "Pitch" Johnson,
was quite a hurdler in his own day.
Pitch tied the existing world record
of 14.8 for the highs back in the
1924 Olympics.

By the way, Stanford's own track
coach, Franklin "Pitch" Johnson,
was quite a hurdler in his own day.
Pitch tied the existing world record
of 14.8 for the highs back in the
1924 Olympics.
Y E STERDAY morning Stanford's
basketball coach, Everett Dean,
left for Pullman, Wash., and a quick
look-see at a Washington State
quintet that has burned up the
Northern Division of the Pacific
Coast Conference and meets those
flying all-All-Coast Indians next
wee k in the Coast playoffs.
The general facts known about
this Cougar team weren't sufficient
to satisfy Mr. Dean. Sure, we all
know they've won their last 12 ball
games against competition just as
tou;;h as California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A.
We also know that they have a
world of height. To be specific,
Paul Lindemann, their center, is
(»-i'ect-7, their forwards, Dale
Gentry, a former footballer, and
Vera Butts, are both fi-feet-3. The
two guards are somewhat smaller,
Captain Ray Sundquist at (i-fect-l
and Kirk Gebert, 5-feet-!).
According to Seattle newspaper
men who saw the Cougars take two
games from the home team, Wash
ington's Huskies, "They (W.S.C.)
have a world of drive. They have
size and range, they shoot well, pass
accurately, and are smart."
* * *
r S'HOSE are big words but only
vague generalities to Stanford's
"Gentleman from Indiana." He al
ready knows they must be all of
what the northern papers say about
them to have gotten as far as they
have.
But Mr. Dean felt it was worth
his while to leave his team for four
days to watch the Cougars in their
once crucial but now only conven
tional games with Oregon State.
He'll be on the look-out for a
hundred-and-one little details which
will help Stanford in the play-offs.
Do the Cougars play a tight man-to
man defense or do they shift off
often? If they shift do they get
caught up in blocks easily? Or do
they use a zone defense which
slacks off to the weak side?
How does thjrir giant center
respond to fakes; does he overplay
the man lie is guarding and will
Don Burness be able to leave him
on a quick cut to the bucket? Do
any of the Cougars have outstand
ing weaknesses 011 defense such as
taking their eyes off their men or
loafing back on defense after los
ing possession of the ball?
The answers to all these questions
will help Doan formulate his team's
offense for the coming play-offs. As
for choosing the best kind of de
fense to stop the Cougars, Dean will
be taking mental notes on their
offense.
Do they like to work the ball in
close with a lot of drive and quick
passoffs for a shot or do they fire
long and depend on their height to
get rebound shots? Do they employ
any fast breaks or do they play de
liberately?
Which of the Cougars is a dan
gerous set shot? Do they try blocks
to set up their shots? Is a certain
man strong with one hand and in
clined to go to that direction or is
he deadly with either hand? By
knowing these facts Dean will be
able to hand out the guarding assign
ments and build his defense for the
team as a whole accordingly.
It's all in the business of coach
ing, to analyze your opponent, pick
out his weak points and capitalize 011
them, as well as to determine his
best offensive weapon and make
plans to stop it. And so the prac
tice of scouting has grown into a
science.

State had two men scouting the
Cards in their last two California
games.

Sacramento's high hurdler. Last
summer as only a high school boy
from Tuscon, Arizona. Batiste ran
the highs in 14.1 in the A.A.U. to
beat such big names as Wolicott
of Rice and Towns of Louisiana.
By the way, Stanford's own track
coach, Franklin "Pitch" Johnson,
was quite a hurdler in his own day.
Pitch tied the existing world record
of 14.8 for the highs back in the
1924 Olympics.
Y E STERDAY morning Stanford's
basketball coach, Everett Dean,
left for Pullman, Wash., and a quick
look-see at a Washington State
quintet that has burned up the
Northern Division of the Pacific
Coast Conference and meets those
flying all-All-Coast Indians next
wee k in the Coast playoffs.
The general facts known about
this Cougar team weren't sufficient
to satisfy Mr. Dean. Sure, we all
know they've won their last 12 ball
games against competition just as
tou;;h as California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A.
We also know that they have a
world of height. To be specific,
Paul Lindemann, their center, is
(»-i'ect-7, their forwards, Dale
Gentry, a former footballer, and
Vera Butts, are both fi-feet-3. The
two guards are somewhat smaller,
Captain Ray Sundquist at (i-fect-l
and Kirk Gebert, 5-feet-!).
According to Seattle newspaper
men who saw the Cougars take two
games from the home team, Wash
ington's Huskies, "They (W.S.C.)
have a world of drive. They have
size and range, they shoot well, pass
accurately, and are smart."
* * *
r S'HOSE are big words but only
vague generalities to Stanford's
"Gentleman from Indiana." He al
ready knows they must be all of
what the northern papers say about
them to have gotten as far as they
have.
But Mr. Dean felt it was worth
his while to leave his team for four
days to watch the Cougars in their
once crucial but now only conven
tional games with Oregon State.
He'll be on the look-out for a
hundred-and-one little details which
will help Stanford in the play-offs.
Do the Cougars play a tight man-to
man defense or do they shift off
often? If they shift do they get
caught up in blocks easily? Or do
they use a zone defense which
slacks off to the weak side?
How does thjrir giant center
respond to fakes; does he overplay
the man lie is guarding and will
Don Burness be able to leave him
on a quick cut to the bucket? Do
any of the Cougars have outstand
ing weaknesses 011 defense such as
taking their eyes off their men or
loafing back on defense after los
ing possession of the ball?
The answers to all these questions
will help Doan formulate his team's
offense for the coming play-offs. As
for choosing the best kind of de
fense to stop the Cougars, Dean will
be taking mental notes on their
offense.
Do they like to work the ball in
close with a lot of drive and quick
passoffs for a shot or do they fire
long and depend on their height to
get rebound shots? Do they employ
any fast breaks or do they play de
liberately?
Which of the Cougars is a dan
gerous set shot? Do they try blocks
to set up their shots? Is a certain
man strong with one hand and in
clined to go to that direction or is
he deadly with either hand? By
knowing these facts Dean will be
able to hand out the guarding assign
ments and build his defense for the
team as a whole accordingly.
It's all in the business of coach
ing, to analyze your opponent, pick
out his weak points and capitalize 011
them, as well as to determine his
best offensive weapon and make
plans to stop it. And so the prac
tice of scouting has grown into a
science.
For your information Washington
State had two men scouting the
Cards in their last two California
games.

high hurdler in action tomorrow.
But no soap, for Sacramento Junior
College has informed the B.A.C,
they will not be present for Satur
day's scheduled triangle meet with
the Stanford freshmen and Modesto
Junior College.
