SAN FRANCISCO, March (j (UP).
—Joe Di Maggio, the New York
Yankee's annual holdout, signed his
1941 contract today and will leave
tomorrow for St. Petersburg, Fla.,
with his wife, the former Dorothy
Arnold.
"Yes, it's true,' Mrs. Di Maggio
said. "Joe is satisfied with the
terms." The terms, however, were
not divulged, but were believed to
be between $33,000 and $35,800 an
nually—at least a small increase
over his last year's salary.
