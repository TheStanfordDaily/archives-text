# Sluggin' Frank Sees Action
## 
### 
Frank Hewitt, varsity 145-pound
boxer, will be surprised to see this.
Last week Hewitt ably cartooned
a strip depicting the Stanford box
ers in action. It attracted widespread
and very favorable comment on The
Daily's sports page.
Hewitt, one of the key fighters on
the squad, wouldn't add his own
picture to the cartoon. "Pshaw," he
said, "this trip I'm drawing and
not fighting."
So the cartoon ran without Hew
itt. So Ed McClellan whipped us up
one on the sly.
This time Hewitt's doing double
duty.
