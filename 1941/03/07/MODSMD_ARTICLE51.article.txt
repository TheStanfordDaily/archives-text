# Gaels Nose Out Card Nine, 2-1
## Quintana's Ninth Inning Hit Breaks Deadlock as Cards Drop CIBA Tilt 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford's varsity nine was fit to be tied yesterday afternoon, but a
ninth-inning single by Val Quintana with Ray Tran on second broke tin
deadlock and gave St. Mary's a 2-1 decision over the Indians in the first
conference game of the season played on Sunken Diamond.
"Cootie" Thompson and Wes Bailey locked horns in a tight pitching
duel and Thompson sent down four Gaels via the strike-out route while

Bailey whiffed only one Indian at,
the plate. "Botch" Caruso, Stanford
second baseman, slammed out two
singles as the Cards outhit Coach
Earl Sheely's club, 6-3.
Stanford nabbed its first run in the
initial inning. "Cherry" Cereghino
opened by flying out to center field,
but Monty Pfyl hit a Texas League
single into short left field, Caruso
following with a long blast deep
into right field that sent Pfyl around
to third base. A nice throw-in by
Quintana kept Caruso from stretch
ing the safety into a double.
DOUBLE STEAL
Coach Harry Wolter hung up the
double steal sign, and Stanford
stole — Pfyl sliding between Bud
Cardoza's legs at the plate with the
Indians' one and only run of the
afternoon. Hal Costello, who de
serted his first-base spot for left
field, got a free pass as did Clark
Graham, Card rightfielder. But
Trail took care of Thompson's
grounder between second and third,
forcing Graham at second.
Sanders kept up Texas League
day, dropping a blooper over sec
ond to begin the third that went for
a base hit. Bud Cardoza walloped
a hard ball down to Pfyl at short,
the Redshirt infielder making a nice
play on the ball over to Caruso for
the start of what looked like a cinch
double killing. Caruso, however
stumbled over the bag while taking
the throw, and all hands were safe.
CHERRY' ON THE BALL
Cereghino came up with a beauty
deep in center field in the sixth, tak
ing Quintana's long drive over his
shoulder to rob the Gael rightfielder
of a sure double.
Came the ninth inning, and a
walk to Tran blew the duke. Pere
vich bunted the shortstop to sec
ond, and Quintana got his only hit
of the day, but it was good enough
to win the game, Tran scoring from
second.

Stanford's varsity nine was fit to be tied yesterday afternoon, but a
ninth-inning single by Val Quintana with Ray Tran on second broke tin
deadlock and gave St. Mary's a 2-1 decision over the Indians in the first
conference game of the season played on Sunken Diamond.
"Cootie" Thompson and Wes Bailey locked horns in a tight pitching
duel and Thompson sent down four Gaels via the strike-out route while

Bailey whiffed only one Indian at,
the plate. "Botch" Caruso, Stanford
second baseman, slammed out two
singles as the Cards outhit Coach
Earl Sheely's club, 6-3.
Stanford nabbed its first run in the
initial inning. "Cherry" Cereghino
opened by flying out to center field,
but Monty Pfyl hit a Texas League

following with a long blast deep

to third base. A nice throw-in by

DOUBLE STEAL
Coach Harry Wolter hung up the
double steal sign, and Stanford
stole — Pfyl sliding between Bud
Cardoza's legs at the plate with the

field, got a free pass as did Clark
Graham, Card rightfielder. But

grounder between second and third,
forcing Graham at second.

Stanford's varsity nine was fit to be tied yesterday afternoon, but a
ninth-inning single by Val Quintana with Ray Tran on second broke tin
deadlock and gave St. Mary's a 2-1 decision over the Indians in the first
conference game of the season played on Sunken Diamond.
"Cootie" Thompson and Wes Bailey locked horns in a tight pitching
duel and Thompson sent down four Gaels via the strike-out route while

Bailey whiffed only one Indian at,
the plate. "Botch" Caruso, Stanford
second baseman, slammed out two
singles as the Cards outhit Coach
Earl Sheely's club, 6-3.
Stanford nabbed its first run in the
initial inning. "Cherry" Cereghino
opened by flying out to center field,
but Monty Pfyl hit a Texas League
single into short left field, Caruso
following with a long blast deep
into right field that sent Pfyl around
to third base. A nice throw-in by
Quintana kept Caruso from stretch
ing the safety into a double.
DOUBLE STEAL
Coach Harry Wolter hung up the
double steal sign, and Stanford
stole — Pfyl sliding between Bud
Cardoza's legs at the plate with the
Indians' one and only run of the
afternoon. Hal Costello, who de
serted his first-base spot for left
field, got a free pass as did Clark
Graham, Card rightfielder. But
Trail took care of Thompson's
grounder between second and third,
forcing Graham at second.
Sanders kept up Texas League
day, dropping a blooper over sec
ond to begin the third that went for
a base hit. Bud Cardoza walloped
a hard ball down to Pfyl at short,
the Redshirt infielder making a nice
play on the ball over to Caruso for
the start of what looked like a cinch
double killing. Caruso, however
stumbled over the bag while taking
the throw, and all hands were safe.
CHERRY' ON THE BALL
Cereghino came up with a beauty
deep in center field in the sixth, tak
ing Quintana's long drive over his
shoulder to rob the Gael rightfielder
of a sure double.
Came the ninth inning, and a
walk to Tran blew the duke. Pere
vich bunted the shortstop to sec
ond, and Quintana got his only hit
of the day, but it was good enough
to win the game, Tran scoring from
second.
