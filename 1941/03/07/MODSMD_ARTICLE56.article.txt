he best Stanford rugby aggregation
n years. There are no real weak
icsses on the team, the backs being
ast, shifty, hard-running, good

i great deal of competition from the
3al scrum, are big, powerful, and
mything but slow.

Captain of the winning team
will be presented the Dr. Frank
Angell perpetual trophy, which

pion of the Northern California
Rugby Union. The presentation
will be made by Frank F. Walker,

ball fans—Paul Ugrin, Jake Thomp
son, Norm Standlee, Pete Kmetovic,
A1 Cole, Lee Bickenbach, Frankie
Albert, Chick Orme, John Kerman,
md Roger Laverty.
The Indians have won six games
to date and tied one contest. Scor
ing an average of slightly more than
15 points per game they still been

lowed their foes to 29, 19 of them in
the first two games.
CAL HAS WON THREE
California has to date won three
games and tied two, for an also un
defeated record. In their last ap
pearance, last Wednesday after
noon, they managed to powerhouse
aver U.S.C. by an 18-6 count, mainly
through the work of their scrum,
rated at least the equal of Stan
ford's.
On the basis of comparative rec
ords Stanford holds the edge, how
ever slight it may be. The Indians
score 107 points for the season to
date, as against 71 for Cal, 48 of
which have come in the last two
games. The Bears' defensive rec
>rd is slightly better, as they have
bold their foes to 17 points, while
Stanford's opponents have man
tged to run up a total of 29 so far
this year.
The game will be preceded by a
'.ilt between the favored Stanford
"rosh and the Cal yearlings at 1:45,
md followed by a contest between
the junior varsities of both schools
immediately after the main attrac
tion.
