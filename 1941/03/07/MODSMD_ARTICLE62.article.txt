# Cardinal Mittmen to Seek Win Over Cal Tonight at Berkeley
## 
### 
Seeking revenge for a defeat suffered two weeks ago, Stanford's boxing
team travels to Berkeley tonight to meet the Golden Bears at !) o'clock
in the Cal gym. The Bears won in the last meeting of the schools, 6-3.
Captain Tom Mac Michael leads the Cards in the 155-pound class
against Chris Fox. "Mouse" handed Fox a T.K.O. the last time. Mac-

Michael also wants to vindicate
himself for the draw he received
last week against U.C.L.A., the first
time he hasn't won a bout in two
years of collegiate boxing.
Johnny Ward returns to the ring
after a two weeks' absence against
Jack Thoburn in the heavyweight
battle. Ward's understudy, Don
Grant, decisioned Thorburn two
weeks ago, which definitely estab
lishes Johnny as the favorite.
Mel Ellett and Bob Leaver meet
either Dave Rogers or Ray Green
wood in the two light-heavy bouts.
Greenwood decisioned Ellett in their
last fight, and Leaver stopped Rog
ers. John Ryan fights in the 165-
pound class.
The remainder of the card fol
lows: Frank Hewitt, 145 pounds, vs.
Bob McEvilly; Johnny Wilson, 135
pounds, vs. an undecided Cal start
er; Dick Lyon, 127 pounds, vs. an
indefinite Cal man; Branson Cooley,
120 pounds, vs. Jack Rogers.
Leaver, Grant, and McMichael
were the only victors two weeks ago.
