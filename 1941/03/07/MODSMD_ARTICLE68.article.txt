# Dean Scouts Cougar-Beaver Hoop Tilt in Pullman Tonight
## 
### 
When Washington and Oregon Stale College quintets collide tonight
and tomorrow in Pullman, Stanford's varsity basketball mentor, Everett
Dean, will be scouting the series for his Southern Division champions.
The Indian coach left here Wednesday after putting his men through
a vigorous workout in preparation for the coming playoffs with the Cou
gars March 14, 15, and maybe

17th too, if the Cards should fail to
knock over their opponents twice
straight.
In the northern series between
Oregon State and Washington State,
the Cougars have dropped two and
will be out for blood and an even
break in the last pair. Dean will
have a good chance to study the
Cougar offense and defense styles as
well as see the individual perform
ances of the Washington five. The
Cougars cinched the northern title
a week ago and are finishing the
regular season against the Beavers.
TWELVE GO
Twelve players are slated to make
the trip for the Redshirt varsity:
Don Williams, Don Burness, Kenny
Davidson, Fordy Anderson, Bill
Cowden, Bob Penn, Ed Voss, Jack
Dana, Fred Linari, Bob Wensel,
Dick Taylor, and John Alltuckei".
They will leave next Wednesday
morning, arriving in Pullman Thurs
day afternoon in time for a light
drill.
Next week practices are slated
for Monday and Tuesday afternoons.
TRAVELING JACKETS
The traveling squad will get 12
new silky jackets to grace their
forms during the northern play
offs.
The Indians will prefer a fast
break in the northern encounters,
but can and will shift to their more
deliberate, steady type of offense
when it seems more advantageous.
Dean's regular style of employing an
assigned man for man defense, with
variations, will be used exclusively.
Easily shown this season is the
fact that the Redskins can either
press their opponents all over floor
or can at other times use a retreat
ing defense. Stanford has five scor
ing players and Washington States
will have to watch them all.
Following is the up-to-date scor
ing, including the two final games
of the season against California and
all non-conference tilts.
