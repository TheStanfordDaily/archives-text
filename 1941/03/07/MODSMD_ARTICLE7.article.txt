## 
### 
With skis, bathing suits, tennis
racquets and riding boots and the
hope that the good weather of the
last few days will continue for the
vacation, the influx of Farm stu
dents to various vacation spots will
begin just as soon as the last name
is signed to the honor code on the
last final.
By car, train, and plane, Stanford
students will head north and south
for their vacations. Christmas vaca
tion the majority head for their
homes. Spring vacation, though,
Carmel, the snowfields and other
play spots get the call.
This year the living groups are
scattering to various parts of the
state. The A.T.O.'s are planning a
vacation at Death Valley. The Zetes
are going to Carmel and Sun Valley
and the Dekes are to go to Balboa.
The Sigma Chis have taken a house
at Palm Springs.
Going to vacation at Carmel are
the Phi Delts, some of the Fijis, and
the Delta Chi menage. Heading

down the Seventeen Mile Drive, bag,
baggage and chaperones, will be the
Alpha Phi's and the Delta Gamma
house. The Pi Phi's are bound for
Palm Springs.
Yosemite will be favored by a
great majority of the Farm men and
women whether they are intending
to ski or just to play in the snow.
The S.A.E.'s, Tri-Delts, and the

ties some will have to do during the
vacation will be the making up of
last quarter's exams missed by those
who came down with the flu and
measles.
For this year's seniors, spending
their last vacation while at Stan
ford, there is the prospect of turn
ing what they have learned at Stan
ford into something permanent—in
other words, looking for a job will
occupy their vacation.
