# Ain't Gonna Rainâ€”Maybe

### 
In Chicago it may have been
.snowing; in New York it may have
been sleeting; in New Orleans it
may have been raining; but yester
day at Stanford the sun, stranger to
California for the last two and a
hall months, shone. And with the
sun, peace and happiness returned
to the Farm.
The warmness of the spring day
made everybody jovial. The Union
waiters were almost chipper. Pro
lessors fairly beamed and started
off their classes with coy remarks.
Athletes hallelujahed. Even the
birds and flowers perked up.
Yesterday marked the second of a
predicted four-day stretch of sunny
bliss. Only a threatening storm front
just south of Alaska disturbs the
picture. This low pressure area is
supposed to be moving toward Cali
lornia, but this is the sole shadow
on the sunny horizon.
Meanwhile the tourist bureaus
can once again advertise "sunny"
California without looking furtively
over their shoulders, gas companies
are repairing pipe leaks, and the
tiains are again running regularly.
The rivers are carrying maximum
loads but no floods are expected.
And at Stanford smiles are replac
ing rain-sodden frowns.
