## 
### 
It's not often that a reviewer feels
the need for more superlatives, for
new words to express admiration
for an artist. But Dorothy Maynor's
singing in Memorial Hall last night
was enough to send the most en
thusiastic listener scurrying to the
dictionary for more expressive ad
jectives.
Miss Maynor repi*esents a phe
nomenon in the world of concert
performers—a truly great artistry
combined with a charmingly in
genuous personality. She has tiie
gift of singing for the audience, as
well as to them. Lavish applause

and even a few "bravos" unusual
from a Stanford audience attest to
this.
Her program was thoughtfully
chosen to please many tastes, as well
as to demonstrate her ability at a
wide diversity of techniques. And
in each number, from the exacting
"Adelaide" by Beethoven to the ir
repressible rhythms of American
negro spirituals, her interpretation
and quality were faultlessly adapted
to the music.
Perhaps the outstanding was
Schubert's "Ave Maria," an all too
familiar number.
