# SPRING COMES TO STANFORD
## 
### CHARLES BULL 
"Stanford in the spring."
To the frosh it's a vague rumor.
They think it does nothing but rain
here. But to the rest of the campus
it is real, vital, and filled with ad
ditional activities. Incidentally the
weather man trained his all-seeing
eye ahead to April and May and
promises nothing but blue skies and
warm days.
Highlight of the quarter, of course,
is that hectic week when studying
is forgotten, everyone will be on a
committee (courtesy Activity Card
Files) and everyone will give will
ingly to a cause worthy of support.
FEATURE OF QUARTER
Yes, Convalescent Home Drive
will be the feature of spring quarter.
Brunch, Bean Day, Tag Day, Labor
Day, Soph Carnival, Junior Water
Carnival, Back to the Farm Day, and
winding up with the Back to the
Farm Dance. It'll be a great week.
Soon after the quarter starts, Farm
politicos will start to get the votes
in line for general A.S.S.U. elections.
Sports headlines in the Daily
probably won't be quite the same
this year without that track team
breaking a world record every
week, but (he boys will carry on and
there'll he the swimmers too.
CHIEF EVENT
Chief Fiftieth Year event will be
the celebration of the laying of the
cornerstone on May 14.
Probable center of most activity

on campus during the quarter will
be—you guessed it—the Boathouse
(still minus that other top deck).
Itiat would normally seem like
enough for one quarter, but there
will be World Affairs Day (nee
Peace Day , Bookstore Rebates,
Junior Prom, Spring Show and all
the rest.
FAR-AWAY LOOK
As the quarter draws to a close,
the old-timers in the Class of '41
will start getting that far-away look
in their eyes as they pass Encina and
Roble, thinking how short a time
it seems since they lived there. Four
years is such a short time, they'll
think as they look ahead toward life
in the army, getting a job, getting
married and all that.
It's great, this spring quarter.

FAR-AWAY LOOK
As the quarter draws to a close,
the old-timers in the Class of '41
will start getting that far-away look
in their eyes as they pass Encina and
Roble, thinking how short a time
it seems since they lived there. Four
years is such a short time, they'll
think as they look ahead toward life
in the army, getting a job, getting
married and all that.
It's great, this spring quarter.
"Stanford in the spring."
To the frosh it's a vague rumor.
They think it does nothing but rain
here. But to the rest of the campus
it is real, vital, and filled with ad
ditional activities. Incidentally the
weather man trained his all-seeing
eye ahead to April and May and
promises nothing but blue skies and
warm days.
Highlight of the quarter, of course,
is that hectic week when studying
is forgotten, everyone will be on a
committee (courtesy Activity Card
Files) and everyone will give will
ingly to a cause worthy of support.
FEATURE OF QUARTER
Yes, Convalescent Home Drive
will be the feature of spring quarter.
Brunch, Bean Day, Tag Day, Labor
Day, Soph Carnival, Junior Water
Carnival, Back to the Farm Day, and
winding up with the Back to the
Farm Dance. It'll be a great week.
Soon after the quarter starts, Farm
politicos will start to get the votes
in line for general A.S.S.U. elections.
Sports headlines in the Daily
probably won't be quite the same
this year without that track team
breaking a world record every
week, but (he boys will carry on and
there'll he the swimmers too.
CHIEF EVENT
Chief Fiftieth Year event will be
the celebration of the laying of the
cornerstone on May 14.
Probable center of most activity

on campus during the quarter will
be—you guessed it—the Boathouse
(still minus that other top deck).
Itiat would normally seem like
enough for one quarter, but there
will be World Affairs Day (nee
Peace Day , Bookstore Rebates,
Junior Prom, Spring Show and all
the rest.
