# Honor Code Acid Test
## 
### 
THAT old Honor Code buqaboo of group re
sponsibility will meet the acid test again in
just 12 days.
Winter quarter finals are rolling around to
top spot on the docket.
During the past two weeks, campus bull
sessions have been buzzing with comments on
student responsibilities in regard to the code
and the system. The problem has been hashed
and rehashed many times over.
And as far as the bull sessions and informal
discussions were concerned, the Farm under
graduate had warmly accepted his own personal
part of the group responsibility.
The test will arrive with this quarter's finals
week.
Individual honor, the kind that keeps a Farm
man or woman from going off the deep end
himself, played a major part in the discussions,
also. But this angle of the code was just plain
taken for granted.
That side of the code has developed so much
during the 21 years the code has been in effect
that it is practically letter-perfect.
It's too bad there's been such a lag between
the individual and the group aspects of the
system. Because group responsibility is the
only insurance that each of us has against those
who do not conform to the principle of indi
vidual honor.
Without that insurance a minority as small
as five per cent can make the system a failure.
Without that insurance one man in a class of
fifty can throw a pall of suspicion over the
entire group. Without that insurance the re
sponsibility of upholding the code reverts back
to the faculty.
And without that insurance Stanford's rich
est tradition can be torn apart by alumni and
students who deny that our Honor Code is still
in working order.
That's what a "stinking five per cent" can
do for the system.
No one wants to be a tattler. No one advocates
that.
But there are so many things that can be
done by the group. The pencil-tapping habit,
or a gentle hint to an offender, to mention two of
the most obvious.
Or if you don't favor those button-hole the
offender after class and talk turkey.
It's up to you.
