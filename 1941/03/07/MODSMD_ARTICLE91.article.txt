# Half-Told Tale
## 
### 
rjiHERE's always a slight ecstatic feeling in the
a. little Daily shack when publication ceases for
the quarter. The idea that you can quit hitting
yourself now because it feels so good to stop.
It's ironical that today there's no such feeling.
Because unfortunately The Daily stopped pub
lication in the middle of what might become the
hottest news story of the year.
When Don Allan and Carter Barber first told
their story in the Palo Alto Hospital they un
loosed a wave of anger and incredulity over the
asserted actions of San Francisco's police force.
The story's only half over now.
This afternoon the two freshmen will attempt
to identify the officer they claim assaulted them
last Saturday night. If they succeed, the city's
police force will likely be subjected to a most
thorough and much-needed house-cleaning.
Should they fail, the grand jury may elect to
carry on an investigation of their ownâ€”with
the same result.
It's too bad we have to quit publication now.
Just another thing we can blame on finals.
