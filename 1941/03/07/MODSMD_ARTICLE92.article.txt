# Handbook for War
## 
### 
THERE isn't much about modern warfare that's
funny. It was rather a relief to find a whim
sical sort of grim humor in the way that Britain
prepares her home defenders for the expected
German invasion.
Much in the style of the modern "helpful
hints" cookbook, Tom Wintringham, command
er of England's local defense volunteers, wrote
the handbook by which millions of Britons are
being trained to resist the threatened invasion.
Writing slowly and comfortably, Wintringham
brought forth all the lessons taught by the
Nazi infiltrations and conquests in the minor
continental states and France. The "New Ways
of War" is the result of his study.
Perched safely in neutral America, the book
makes for quite entertaining reading. The man
on-the-street is calmly taught to build hand
grenades in his garage; to dig tank traps; where
to thrust a crow-bar to best put a tank out of
commission; and other similar details calculated
to strengthen the home defenses.

The humor of it becomes a bit pointed, how
ever, when he brings in lessons like the fol
lowing terse instruction:
"No tomrny-gun can possibly hit you at 500
yards; at 200 yards it will not hit you if you are
quick; at 100 yards or less it will cut you in half
within two seconds. Keep these qualities in
mind."
