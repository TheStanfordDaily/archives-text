SWAN SONG, REALLY
stickers will not be popular on cars in
San Francisco for a few months. In fact, we've
heard the Bookstore is offering, for an unlimited time,
one can of especially prepared "sticker remover," con
sisting of gasoline and alcohol, with each three stickers.
Drivers may thus remove their Stanford signs as
easily as they put them on.
We suspect, though, that San Francisco cops are
going to be a little more abrupt than usual with Farm
men and women. Whenever they get the chance we
figure they'll throw "the book" at them.
One enterprising Stanford undergraduate decided to
test just how unpopular the Indians are in the City,
so he walked up and down San Francisco streets
whistling "Come Join the Band." Whenever he came
near a corner—and a cop—he whistled louder, and
augmented his repertoire with "Sons of the Stanford
Red" and the chorus of the Alma Mater.
The percentage of dirty looks he got was gigantic.
Toward the end of the afternoon, he was almost
on the verge of walking up to that officer who stands
on the corner by the St. Francis and breaking down,
utterly and miserably. "Okay, okay, officer, I'm a
Stanford man. I can't stand it any longer. Just take
me away."

of the better features of the San Francisco
expo's second Treasure Island show was the "Art
in Action" exhibit. We used to like to watch that
man who worked on the Redwood with the axe. And
we were a little awed by Diego Rivera and his femi
nine assistant as they moved slowly about on the
scaffolding in front of their giant mural.
The mural will repose, we understand, in one of
the San Francisco Junior College buildings, which is
a bi'eak for S.F.J.C. One of the women in the mural
is very clearly Paulette Goddard. And holding Paul
ette's hand is, very clearly, someone who looks like
Diego Rivera.
When questioned about this resemblance, Diego
admitted that, yes, it was he. But the idea which
prompted the two figures, Diego says, was "Pan-
American good will." Yes.
With this same project in mind—that of further
ing Pan-American unity—your Bull Sessioner offers
himself to the cause. He is willing to promote this
unity in practically the same way that Diego did.
How does Miss Goddard feel about the idea?

13ESTS of the Week: Best introduction in any book
—"All the names used in this book are purely fic
tional; the characters are not." Best words in any
recorded song—". . . and though our little life is
rounded by a sleep, don't weep; the stars remain,"
played by Eddy Duchin.

This is leave-taking time. With this issue, The Daily
will quietly fold its tents and depart, like the Arabs.
When publication begins next quarter, Bull Session
will be handled by Jerry Mayer, who is now under
the excellent care of Mrs. Allen.
Too many times has this Bull Sessioner written
what Muheim calls "all that drivel" and what senti
mental Daily-ites call "farewell words." Any addi
tional exits or entrances this writer can make will not
be graceful.
So let's say "thirty."
