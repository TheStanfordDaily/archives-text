ROBLE REGULATIONS

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
Wc feci that the Committee of Five has slipped
up on not making elear to the Roble girls how penal
ties are assessed.
Violations of all Roble rules are punished as the
Committee of Five sees fit. taking into consideration
not only the violation but the past record of the girl in
question. The Committee believes that a girl with
numerous regular and technical lockouts, as well as
quiet-hours violations, shows a lack of co-operative
spirit, and is deserving of a penalty in order that she
might realize the significance of rules in a large group.
We think that the girls are absolutely right in the
fact that blowing out a candle is not serious enough
in itself to warrant a Saturday night lock-in, but it
was necessary to consider the attitude taken by the
girls and also the number and nature of their past
violations.
We .have warned repeatedly that playing with
the candles would be sufficient reason for discontinu
ing the candlelight dinners that the majority of the
girls enjoy. The "subjects" said that they did it im
pulsively knowing they were breaking rules and dis
tracting from the dignity of Wednesday's guest dinner.
If girls understand the rules, they will find that
there is nothing in the system to make them disregard
the importance of a lockout.
The Committee
P.S.: Although some Roble rules may resemble
Emily Post, they arc still Roble rules.

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Stanford's traditions and customs have long been
the envy of other universities; have been milestones in
the glorious history of the Farm; have been features
that distinguish Stanford from other universities, and
to these traditions we can turn with pride, proud to
be sons and daughters of the Stanford Red.
Recent years have seen these cherished traditions
slowly fading into the dim past, and with the Senior
Prom and other campus formals arise another dying
Stanford tradition—namely, that of not sending cor
sages to the young lady.
It goes without saying that all of us like to send
flowers to our dates to ofTer that "added touch ' to her
charm and loveliness. In the past, some have adhered
to the "no flowers" custom, others have not, causing
mild consternation and slight inferiority or superiority,
as the case may be.
Come on seniors, let's join and present a united
front, and "all aid" to the "no corsage tradition. Let s
make this Senior Prom one of tradition and one we
will all remember.

numerous regular and technical lockouts, as well as
quiet-hours violations, shows a lack of co-operative
spirit, and is deserving of a penalty in order that she
might realize the significance of rules in a large group.
We think that the girls are absolutely right in the
fact that blowing out a candle is not serious enough
in itself to warrant a Saturday night lock-in, but it
was necessary to consider the attitude taken by the
girls and also the number and nature of their past
violations.
We .have warned repeatedly that playing with
the candles would be sufficient reason for discontinu
ing the candlelight dinners that the majority of the
girls enjoy. The "subjects" said that they did it im
pulsively knowing they were breaking rules and dis
tracting from the dignity of Wednesday's guest dinner.
If girls understand the rules, they will find that
there is nothing in the system to make them disregard
the importance of a lockout.

P.S.: Although some Roble rules may resemble
Emily Post, they arc still Roble rules.

Stanford's traditions and customs have long been
the envy of other universities; have been milestones in
the glorious history of the Farm; have been features
that distinguish Stanford from other universities, and
to these traditions we can turn with pride, proud to
be sons and daughters of the Stanford Red.
Recent years have seen these cherished traditions
slowly fading into the dim past, and with the Senior
Prom and other campus formals arise another dying
Stanford tradition—namely, that of not sending cor
sages to the young lady.
It goes without saying that all of us like to send
flowers to our dates to ofTer that "added touch ' to her
charm and loveliness. In the past, some have adhered
to the "no flowers" custom, others have not, causing
mild consternation and slight inferiority or superiority,
as the case may be.
Come on seniors, let's join and present a united
front, and "all aid" to the "no corsage tradition. Let s
make this Senior Prom one of tradition and one we
will all remember.
