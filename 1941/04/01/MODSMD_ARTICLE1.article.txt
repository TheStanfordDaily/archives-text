r PHE embarrassing incidents which
occurred just in time to sour
Mr. Matsuoka's visits to both Berlin
and Rome became even more pain
ful to his hosts yesterday ... if such
a thing is possible.
In Berlin, it became evident that
the odds against the peaceable
settlement of Yugoslavia's Balkan
balk have climbed nearly out of
sight. And in Rome, the Italians
writhed as the British released
their complete report on Sunday's
biggest-since-Jutland naval battle
in the lonian Sea.
Because of the tremendous loss of
face suffered by the Nazis when they
failed in their attempt to bring
Yugoslavia into the Axis, it is clear
that they must either force the orig
inal agreement on young King Pet
er's new government, or fight. If
they compromise, every subject na
tion in Europe will hear of it—to say
nothing of Germany's titular ally,
Russia, and her Tri-partite partner,
Japan. Things have a way of get
ling around, and people under alien
rule get very adept at talking out of
the corner of the mouth.

jVAZIDOM'S prestige is built on
the keystone of invincibility.
No "invincible" juggernaut would
brook defiance from a tiny nation of
miscellaneous Slavs. On the other
hand, the new Belgrade government,
backed by an army of 1,200,000 men
in strategic mountain positions, and
the hard-fighting Serbian peasantry
seems unwilling to knuckle under to
Herr Hitler. There would have
been no reason for last week's coup
d'etat if they had been eager for or
even apathetic toward Axis domina
tion.
The Croats of the north have
definite Axis leanings, primarily
because they dislike Serb domina
tion. Refugees from this area have
been jamming the roads and rail
ways leading south from this re
gion for the past two days.
Logically, Germany should strike
from Rumania and she should have
no difficulty occupying the Croatian
plain. At the same time she should
begin her Greek offensive. Yugo
slavia, in its present state of mind,
cannot be ignored, since the German
flank in Bulgaria would be com
pletely exposed, during an attack
carried out on Greece alone.

very little the Duce can
do to cover over this last blow
to his prestige. It seems apparent
that Sunday's lop-sided set-to in the
lonian sea in which not one British
ship was lost just about cleaned up
any dreams the Italians were treas
uring about a Mare Nostrum for an
other decade or two.
Careful reports and eye-witness
accounts reveal that the Fascists
lost a battleship, four cruisers,
and three destroyers, with 3000
officers and men drowned and an
other 1000 taken prisoner. Taking
into account the size of the Italian
navy, these losses—if accuratcly
reported—would just about put the
British in complete command of
the Mediterranean.
In Ethiopia, the British are now
pounding along tovyard Addis Ababa
after taking Diredawa and cutting
Ethiopia's only railway. In both
Eritrea and Ethiopia, it is clear that
the British have little else to do but
clean up before the terrible African
rains arrive.

and last night, the
R.A.F. went after the channel
ports concentrating particularly on
Brest, where the two pocket battle
ships, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau,
were at anchor. Neither ship was
hit in the afternoon, but the R.A.F.
went back to try again. Removal of
either of these raiders would be a
blessing and relief to harried Atlantic
convoys.
In this country President Roose
velt had a busy day what with re
vealing that a quantity of French
75's stored at North Carolina's Fort
Bragg will be shipped with other
materiel to Greece immediately, and
managing to stave off the imminent
C.1.0. coal strike for at least another
day.
The Stanford University Press has
published thirty titles in the past
twelve months in addition to its
other activities.
