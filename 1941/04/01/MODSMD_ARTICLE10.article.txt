# Ratio Changes As Enrollment Drops By 94
## 
### 
Enrollment figures for spring
quarter this year dropped below
last year's by 94, lowering the old
men-women average to 2.1 to 1.
Enrollees this year totaled 3776;
2573 men and 1203 women. Last
year 2661 men enrolled and 1209
women. The women are enrolling
in about the same number while the
men have dropped off, possibly due
to the draft, although spring quarter
generally has less enrolled students
than any other quarter.
An average number of couples at
tended the Reg Dance, numbering
530 couples in all, the same total
that attended the dance last year at
this time.
