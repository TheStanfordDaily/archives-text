# Martini to Give Last Concert Of Series Thursday Evening
## 
### 
Nino Marlini, leading tenor of the Metropolitan Opera, will be pre
sented by the Stanford Concert Series Thursday evening, April 3, at 8:15
o'clock in the Memorial Auditorium. Tickets for the concert are on sale
at the Concert Series Office in the Old Union.
Mr. Martini, who is now not only leading lyric tenor of the Metropolitan,

but is also a favorite of concert,
screen, and radio, was born in Ve
rona, Italy, where he began his ca
reer as soloist in the choir of San
Fermo's church. He made his op
eratic debut at 21 as the Duke in
"Rigoletto." His success was so
great that he was immediately signed
for "I Puritani," an opera that had
not been sung for over 51 years in
its original key because one of the
tenor arias called for F above high C.
GOOD PERSUASION
While on tour of European music
centers, he met Jesse Lasky, who
persuaded him to come to America
and contracted him for five singing
pictures in Italian. Here in the
United States he signed as leading
tenor with the Philadelphia Opera
Company and after a successful sea
son made a series of nationwide
concerts.
Nino Martini, through his radio
singing, has been granted the Co
lumbia Medal for "distinguished
contribution to radio art," a medal
granted to only five other individ
uals, including Lindbergh and Stok
owski.
DEBUT IN 1933
In 1933, Mr. Martini made his de
but with the Metropolitan Opera
Company and then went to Holly
wood, where he starred in three
films. He has been voted the world's
most handsome tenor and has been
selected â€¢by the Fashion Guild of
America as the country's best
dressed opera singer.
