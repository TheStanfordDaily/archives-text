# Excom Mulls Heavy Docket
## Considers Proposal For Naval R.O.T.C. 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Ex Committee, bitten by spring
fever, took a deep breath and
plunged into one of the heaviest
dockets of the year at its last meet
ing of winter quarter. Excom meets
tonight a t7:15 o'clockj
Plans to establish a Naval R.O.T.C.
at Stanford were presented by Bill
Turner, head of the Emergency Stu
dent Defense Council, and Freshman
Howard Wright, and investigation of
the idea was sanctioned by Excom.
"Because freshmen will be those
most concerned by such action, in
formal polls have been taken in
Encina and we find that out of 210
balloters, 155 are wholeheartedly in
favor of the idea for next year,"
Turner said. "However, the idea
must emanate from the students
themselves within the next month of
school," he added. Turner reports
the Navy, which is establishing eight
new units, is behind the idea and will
require 85 in the first enlistment.

BARBEY PLOTS
BACK TO THE FARM: Plans
were presented to Excom by Gra
ham Barbey, program chairman, and
it was decided that all profits of the
500 Dance will go to the Conva
lescent Home.
A blanket okay was given Back
to the Farm committees, which used
up all the names in the Activities
Card Files, according to Barbey. He
also presented suggested slogans for
Tag Day, and when he got around
to "Ten cents will hold up their
pants," Dana Winters blurted out
with, "That's getting a little bit basic,
isn't it?"
SCREWY SLOGANS
Other catchlines presented by
Barbey included: "Give what you
like to help a tyke"; "Give all
you've got to a Con Home tot";
"You've got what it takes, give the
kiddies the breaks"; "Hi Ho Silver
for the kiddies"; "Hi dee ho, give
the kiddies your dough"; "Tag up
fof a tot"; "Give 'em hell-p"; and
"Get off the dime and give it to the
kiddies." The last has since been
chosen.
QUAI) PROPOSAL: Jim McKel
lar, Quad business manager, pro
posed plans to create a new pro
motion manager to include the man
aging editor's duties and share the
profits. "This program," according
to McKellar, "would increase the
number of students in these jobs."
The proposition was tabled, and will
be discussed with McKellar by
Dick Stepp, student manager, and
Dwight Hutchinson.
STUDENT CONCERT: Frank
Towner told the committee that
chances for an on-campus concert
this spring are "pretty gloomy," but
brought news that the University
will build a new shell, to cost $600.
He expressed the belief that "the
student body couldn't handle a con-
cert" this spring. Isabel Fawcelt
retaliated with, "Why, people prac
tically leap at the chance to go to
the symphony every week." No final
decision was reached.
Ned Pugh confronted a nodding
committee with a long list of con
stitutional changes which were sub
sequently passed.
BASKETBALL AWARDS: Ross
Anderson presented changes in frosh
basketball awards which were
passed. An award will be given any
man who plays one-half the regu
larly scheduled games or one-sixth
the playing time of the Cal series.
WOMEN'S ATHLETICS: Changes
in awards and handling of women's
sports were proposed by Muriel
Boggs and passed by Excom.

BARBEY PLOTS
BACK TO THE FARM: Plans
were presented to Excom by Gra
ham Barbey, program chairman, and
it was decided that all profits of the
500 Dance will go to the Conva
lescent Home.
A blanket okay was given Back
to the Farm committees, which used
up all the names in the Activities
Card Files, according to Barbey. He
also presented suggested slogans for
Tag Day, and when he got around
to "Ten cents will hold up their
pants," Dana Winters blurted out
with, "That's getting a little bit basic,
isn't it?"
SCREWY SLOGANS
Other catchlines presented by
Barbey included: "Give what you
like to help a tyke"; "Give all
you've got to a Con Home tot";
"You've got what it takes, give the
kiddies the breaks"; "Hi Ho Silver
for the kiddies"; "Hi dee ho, give

"Get off the dime and give it to the

cert" this spring. Isabel Fawcelt
retaliated with, "Why, people prac

decision was reached.
Ned Pugh confronted a nodding
committee with a long list of con
stitutional changes which were sub
sequently passed.

fever, took a deep breath and
plunged into one of the heaviest
dockets of the year at its last meet

Plans to establish a Naval R.O.T.C.
at Stanford were presented by Bill
Turner, head of the Emergency Stu
dent Defense Council, and Freshman
Howard Wright, and investigation of
the idea was sanctioned by Excom.
"Because freshmen will be those
most concerned by such action, in
formal polls have been taken in
Encina and we find that out of 210
balloters, 155 are wholeheartedly in
favor of the idea for next year,"
Turner said. "However, the idea
must emanate from the students
themselves within the next month of
school," he added. Turner reports
the Navy, which is establishing eight
new units, is behind the idea and will
require 85 in the first enlistment.

BARBEY PLOTS
BACK TO THE FARM: Plans
were presented to Excom by Gra
ham Barbey, program chairman, and
it was decided that all profits of the
500 Dance will go to the Conva
lescent Home.
A blanket okay was given Back
to the Farm committees, which used
up all the names in the Activities
Card Files, according to Barbey. He
also presented suggested slogans for
Tag Day, and when he got around
to "Ten cents will hold up their
pants," Dana Winters blurted out
with, "That's getting a little bit basic,
isn't it?"
SCREWY SLOGANS
Other catchlines presented by
Barbey included: "Give what you
like to help a tyke"; "Give all
you've got to a Con Home tot";
"You've got what it takes, give the
kiddies the breaks"; "Hi Ho Silver
for the kiddies"; "Hi dee ho, give
the kiddies your dough"; "Tag up
fof a tot"; "Give 'em hell-p"; and
"Get off the dime and give it to the
kiddies." The last has since been
chosen.
QUAI) PROPOSAL: Jim McKel
lar, Quad business manager, pro
posed plans to create a new pro
motion manager to include the man
aging editor's duties and share the
profits. "This program," according
to McKellar, "would increase the
number of students in these jobs."
The proposition was tabled, and will
be discussed with McKellar by
Dick Stepp, student manager, and
Dwight Hutchinson.
STUDENT CONCERT: Frank
Towner told the committee that
chances for an on-campus concert
this spring are "pretty gloomy," but
brought news that the University
will build a new shell, to cost $600.
He expressed the belief that "the
student body couldn't handle a con-
cert" this spring. Isabel Fawcelt
retaliated with, "Why, people prac
tically leap at the chance to go to
the symphony every week." No final
decision was reached.
Ned Pugh confronted a nodding
committee with a long list of con
stitutional changes which were sub
sequently passed.
BASKETBALL AWARDS: Ross
Anderson presented changes in frosh
basketball awards which were
passed. An award will be given any
man who plays one-half the regu
larly scheduled games or one-sixth
the playing time of the Cal series.
WOMEN'S ATHLETICS: Changes
in awards and handling of women's
sports were proposed by Muriel
Boggs and passed by Excom.
