### 
Fourteen Stanford men moved
into a nine-room house on Alvarado
Row yesterday, thus establishing the
first ollicia) co-operative living group
in Stanford's history.
Establishment of this co-opera
tive unit, however, was not simply
a matter of moving into a house. It
is the result of a year's untiring
effort by students, professors, mem
bers of the Palo Alto Consumers'
Co-op, and co-operative leaders at
other universities. Russ Curtis, Dick
MacCann, and Mac Wynne have led
the local movement.
APPROVAL SECURED
Final administration approval for
the organization was secured a week
ago, and as soon as negotiations for
the house were completed members
collected furniture and completed
preparation during spring vacation.
Almost all furniture has been do
nated or loaned by the Cal co-op
houses, by members of the Palo Alto
Co-op, professors, and others inter
ested in the movement. Over 50
chairs of all types have been re
ceived, as well as dressers, tables,
rugs, lamps, beds, and mattresses.
Only study tables have been pur
chased.
BEDS INSTALLED
Double-deck beds, donated by the
Duveneck Ranch, have been in
stalled on the sleeping porch. Tem
porary closets have been made from
large refrigerator shipping crates.
The co-op house, located at 536
Alvarado Street, consists of a front
room and dining room, kitchen, four
bedrooms, sleeping porch, and attic.
Study rooms have been prepared,
one for three members.
The house offers only room ac
commodations, but it is planned to
open a dining room later, according
to Russ Curtis.
FINANCIAL SHOESTRING'
"Our house is being started on a
financial shoestring," Curtis said.
"Very little has been spent for
equipment."
Financial obligations of the unit
are guaranteed by 23 professors, each
of whom has pledged $10 to pay any
liabilities incurred if the co-op is
unable to continue.
BUDGET ESTIMATES
Present managers of the house ex
plain that budget estimates call for
a room rent of $9.50 a month per
member, but $11 will be charged to
insure against unforeseen expenses.
A $2 membership fee is required as
well as an $8 deposit.
The house is founded on the
Rochdale principles. Members will
vote on all questions of major pol
icy and will elect their own officers
to operate the house. Any profits
will be rebated to the members.
Members are required to make
their own beds, clean their rooms,
and do an hour's work a week on the
house. The present house can ac
commodate 16 men and already 14
have joined.
