### 
BELGRADE. Tuesday, April 1 (UP). —Germany's minister to troubled
Jugoslavia was on his way to Berlin today and reliable reports circulated
that the government had closed the frontier with Rumania.
Warlike signs and portents multiplied rapidly, and the new military
regime said the army, navy and air force were "ready to fulfill their
duties."
Amid a welter of rumors regarding Germany's intentions toward Jugo
slavia public concern mounted to a pitch of utmost gravity. Authorities

sought to calm the people and at,
the same time steel them for any
eventualities, urging that they stand
by their homes and posts of duty
regardless of what happens.
The departure of the German min
ister, Viktor von Heeren, came as no
surprise. It had been prospective for
days, and he boarded a train for
Berlin last night to report to Nazi
authorities.
Rumors also had circulated pre
viously of the closing of Jugoslav
frontiers. Late last night reliable
sources said that the border with
Rumania, a scant 50 miles from Bel
grade, had been sealed. Any Ger
man thrust from Rumania presum
ably would come up the Danube
Valley straight west to the capital.
Germans were getting out of Ju
goslavia as fast as possible, and
many residents of Belgrade were
leaving for the interior where they
expected to be safer in case of an
invasion.
