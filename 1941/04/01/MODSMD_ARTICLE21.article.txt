# Senior Prom Band Leader, Kay Kyser Sends Thanks
## 
### 
It's an old story when a big-name band draws a jam-packed audience
in a one-night stand down on the Farm.
But it's a new twist when the big-name band leader tosses the orchids
buck on Stanford and on Stanford men and women. Kay Kyser of Senior
Prom fame heaped them on thick in a letter to The Daily.

The letter follows:
Could I steal a few inches in
your paper to tell all the students
how much we enjoyed our recent
visit to your campus.
Everyone was wonderful to us
at the dance, and we got a big
kick out of playing your Senior
Prom. I can truthfully say we
have never had a nicer, better be
haved or more appreciative audi
ence. And as for the gals—well,
it's an old Southern custom to rec
ognize beauty when you see it—
and we saw it!
You all lived up to everything
vvc had anticipated, and if possible
even more.
Thanks again, Stanford—we'll
set you in the Rose Bowl again
iv>xt year, and until then, we'll
Ik: ''Thinking of You."
Sincerely,
Kay Kyser
