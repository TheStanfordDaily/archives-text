# Stanford Student Escapes Death
## 
### 
A Carmel tide came close to pro
longing indefinitely the spring va
cation of a Stanford student last
Saturday when Frank Hammond,
Theta Delta Chi, was overcome by
a chill and the strong tide carried
him beyond safety.
After a half-hour in the ocean he
was washed onto the beach where
two onlookers came to his rescue.
Witnesses had thought he was just
out swimming and had not realized
his plight.
On reaching shore Hammond col
lapsed and was taken to the local
hospital, where he spent the night
and was well enough to return home
Sunday.
Motorists are warned by the Na
tional Automobile Club that, unless
they have received their 1941 regis
tration cards, they should check with
the office from which they obtained
their plates.
