# Bill Saroyan's Screwy Play Draws Laughs
## Queer People Wander In and Out of Bar En Plea for Kindness 
### 
"The Time of Your Life" by Wil
liam Saroyan, now playing at the
Curran Theater in San Francis*o.
Nick's dive on Pacific Street just
off the Embarcadero isn't out of this
world. According to Nick himself,
it's "on a city street and the people
who eome in bring what they got
with 'em and they say what they
gotta say."
A strange aggregation of human
beings wander in and out of the
dingy little bar, but fundamentally
they all dance to the same tune.
Playwright (or what you will) Sa
royan has written a plea for human
kindness, and at one time or other
each of the major characters makes
that plea.
William Saroyan is no slick writer,
and "The Time of Your Life" is not
a smooth integrated piece of work.
As in his books, he is ribald, blunt,
and screwy. The laughs are fre
quent and of the sort that make your
diaphragm cramp. But the feeling
you carry out of the theater is one
extraordinarily close to tears.
DOWLING IS KEY MAN
Key man in the play is Joe, played
by Eddie Dowling. Joe is a cham
pagne drunk, who spends most of
his time talking to the people who
enter Nick's. He has plenty of
money, and he simply doesn't want
to hurt anyone. Dowling's low
keyed performance contrasts nicely
with the more vociferous members
of the cast. I liked the yelling, how
ever. It seemed as though, being
simple folk, they just had to get
things off their chests in the loudest
manner possible. Shouting seemed
to ease their sensibilities.
PROSTITUTE WITH DREAMS'
Of all the rest of the characters,
Julie Haydon's Kitty Duval seemed
to me to be the least clear cut. As a
Polish prostitute with dreams—the
most innocent person Joe has ever
met—she gives the requisite amount
of fragility and sadness to the role.
Perhaps her slightly foggy quality is
due to the fact that she is the most
nearly normal human in the play.
Saroyan seems to be at his best
when he is making fantastic people
so real that normality becomes in
congruous.
All the rest of the people are mag
nificent—Nick, the bartender, his
minute Italian mother; the natural
born dancer who wants to make
people laugh; the colored piano
player; the "no foundation" Arab
derelict with the harmonica; the in
tellectual longshoreman; the un
happy cop; the drunk who gets nick
els out of the telephone; and the
fabulous Kit Carson ("Did you ever
fall in love with a 39-pound mid
ge.t?") and the Assyrian pin-ball
game addict.—Nowell
