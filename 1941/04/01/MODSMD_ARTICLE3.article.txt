## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 31 (UP).—
Germany and Italy today formally
protested against the United States'
seizure of 30 German and Italian
merchant ships in the face of clear
indications from President oßosevelt
and Secretary of State Cordell Hull
that the protests would be firmly
rejected.
The protests were filed at the State
Department by Dr. Hans Thomsen,
German charge d'affaires, and Ital
ian Ambassador Prince Colonna.
The texts were not made public
immediately. Hull, Secretary of War
Henry L. Stimson and Secretary of
the Navy Frank Knox went into
conference.
Earlier, Hull had taken a strong
stand in defense of the seizure of
the ships. He said he had no inten
tion of officially notifying the Ital
ian and German governments of the
seizures. He explained action speaks
louder than words.
