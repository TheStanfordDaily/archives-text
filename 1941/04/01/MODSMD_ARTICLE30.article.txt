# Stanford, Cal Celebrate Joint Anniversaries; Wilbur Speaks
## 
### 
Last week, while Stanford students were vacationing, the traditional
sporting field rivalry between Stanford and California was forgotten as
the two universities co-operated to celebrate Cal's seventy-third Charter
Week and Stanford's "First Fifty Years."
President Kay Lyman Wilbur gave the key addresses at three of the

seventy-third anniversary celebra-,
tions, one at U.C.L.A., one at Ber
keley, and one at a joint alumni
meeting in San Francisco.
University of California students
presented Dr. Wilbur with a placque
commemorating Stanford's fiftieth
anniversary at the Charter Day
Alumni Banquet last Thursday eve
ning in the Palace Hotel, which was
attended by alumni and faculty
members of the two institutions.
The text of the placque was as
follows:
"In 'commemoration of the 50th An
niversary of Stanford University.
Presented by the students of the
University of California, March 27,
1941.
OUR DESTINY'
Dr. Wilbur's topic for his Charter
Day addresses at U.C.L.A. and Ber
keley was "Our Pacific Destiny," in
which he emphasized "that a new
order must be developed through
universal education, science, good
will, and a true inclusive democ
racy."
Charter Week was celebrated on
all the University of California's
seven campuses and three other
Stanford men took part in the cere
monies:
History Professor Edgar Eugene
Robinson spoke at the Davis campus
last Wednesday; Dean Loren R.
Chandler of Stanford Medical School
spoke in U. C. Hospital's Toland Hall
on "Future Problems in Medicine";
Capt. W. C. Crandall represented
Stanford alumni when he spoke at a
Charter Week dinner in La Jolla
following an open house at the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography
ATTACKS SELECTION
In his talk on "The First Fifty
Years" at the alumni banquet, Dr.
Wilbur reviewed Stanford's colorful
history and renewed his attack on
the operation of the Selective Serv
ice Act in respect to university stu
dents active in technical work
