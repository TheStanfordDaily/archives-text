# Senator Nye Asks Nation To Ban War
## Speaks at Palo Alto Auditorium, Voicing Isolationist Plea 
### 
Predicting that the forward surge
of the American ship of state into
the European maelstrom "can and
will be halted" should the true opin
ion of the American people be
voiced, Senator Gerald P. Nye spoke
last night at the Palo Alto High
School auditorium.
Senator Nye spoke under the aus
pices of the America First Commit
tee. Novelist Kathleen Norris also
spoke, with Stanford History Pro
fessor Max Savelle acting as chair
man for the meeting.
Following isolationist Nye's dis
cussion, Dr. Richard Jones, Stan
ford history instructor, offered a
resolution that the 900 persons pres
ent go on record as opposing Amer
ica's entrance into any European or
Asiatic war. There were only five
dissenting votes.
"We are much nearer war now
than we were 15 days before Con
gress declared war in 1917," Nye
declared. He offered as a solution
a united stand against war on the
part of the American electorate.
"We're being fooled as we've never
been fooled before," the Senator
stated.
He claimed that the American
people are always fighting hates and
fears. "Each time," he said, "we
call these hates and fears an emer
gency."
Voicing a strong warning against
blind subjugation to the paths cho
sen by our leaders, Senator Nye
urged all thinking Americans to give
vent to their true feelings.
"Our foreign policy, in brief should
be: First, last and all the time â€”
America first."
