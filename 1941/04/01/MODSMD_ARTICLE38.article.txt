# Ichthyologist Returns to Farm
## 
### 
Dr. Albert Herre, Stanford's cura
tor of ichthyology, returned to the
campus yesterday after eleven
months in the Philippines, India,
and the Malay Peninsula devoted to
collecting specimens and investi
gating fishery conditions in the
western Pacific. He also brought
back many impressions of the war
conditions in that area.
The war's principal effect, Dr.
Herre reports, is to disrupt traveling,
since the vessels remaining in non
military service are small and in
ferior, with poor accommodations.
In India, he saw evidence that the
British campaign in Africa was as
carefully planned as any Nazi blitz
krieg. Before the first victories in
Libya, camps for 100,000 prisoners
had been prepared. Before Dr.
Herre's departure they had been
filled.
In all the countries he visited,
Dr. Herre worked with the govern
ment fisheries departments, and
also delivered a lecture at the meet
ing of the Indian Academy of Sci
ences at Madras.

largest winery.
