These business managers are a
cagey bunch. They never leap
until they've looked around a lot.
Daily Business Manager Frank
Bush is a walking monument to
the tradition.
Last June, Bush noticed his
Ford coupe was getting a hit dirty.
Bush scouted around a while, and
finally in July he bought a can of
heavy duty auto polish.
The rest of the summer lie
waited for the right day for the
big effort. He waited through
fall and winter quarters. The
right day didn't come. Then spring
vacation was finally set as the
time for the big wash and polish.
He's still waiting.
