1 IVING up to his reputation as a
news maker, Stanford's football
coach, wizard of the T-formation,
Clark Shaughnessy, started prepa
rations for spring football practice
With a rather startling statement.
"I'd like nothing better than to
have two hundred or more men
mil theie this spring. Size and
previous experience are not im
portant . . ."
This plea is so typical of Stan
ford's unique eoaeh and his equally
i nique system. In the first place,
there an: lew coaches in the country
v hich would be willing to spend the
time and effort sorting out and di
recting 150 newcomers as well as 50
veterans just to uncover some new
n.uterial.
And in (he second place, the re
nowned Shaughnessy T-formation
Oj . more generally, the Shaughnessy
system, is the only, system which
could possibly use a man who had
h; d no previous experience. Shaugh
n< ssy himself has said that "the sys
te n which we employ gives every
oi e a chance."
So here is a chance for every guy
w io has always had a hankering to
play football, for I promise you that
SI aughnessy, with his character
istic energy, will give everyone THE
CI'ANCE he was speaking of as
w< 11 as plenty of individual atten
tion to every prospect.

'THAT 41 TO 19 beating California
handed Stanford's track team
wa >, to say the least, expected. But
the ugh the track situation on the
Fa in this coming season will defi
nit ly be tough, there were a few
consoling performances against the
powerful Bears.
There were those two brilliant
flights of hurdles run by Vern Ilart
ai d anchor man Ed Hertel, re
sj ( lively, which gave the Indians
th.ir only relay victory. Taking
over ahout Â£2 yards behind the Cal
m n in the third llight of the re
lay, Hart picked up about 5 yards
while Hertel, who must have run
cl :se to li.li, closed the remainder
of (he gap and even went in front
by about two yards.
Most gratifying was that 158-foot
toss in the discus gotten off by Em
erson Hiler. For the past two yeax's
Hi! -i' has been the hardest working
;na i on the track squad and against
Ca! his hours of practice paid off.
