# National Anthem Halts Studying
## 
### 
What to do when you're studying
in the Libe and the Hoover Libe
carillon starts playing "The Star
Spangled Banner"?
That was the problem which
confronted students studying for
Winter Quarter finals one day dur
ing finals week. The carilloneur
who was installing the bells was
practicing and started to play the
national anthem, to the dismay of
patriotic but nevertheless self
consuscious - about-the-whole-thing
Stanfordites.
The more well-drilled patriots in
the Library immediately rose to their
feet, others following a bit uncer
tainly. Others were evidently too
engrossed in their studies to bother
with patriotism.
Library directors have announced,
however, that the national anthem
will not be on the regular repertoire
of the carillon.
