# Mud, Stumps, Ditches Herald Campus Road improvements
## 
### ROSE DOUGLASS 
They're tearing up the streets agaHf. During spring vacation a crew of
I huskies anmul with picks and shovels went to work on Santa Teresa
Street and I.omita Drive with the result that the two thoroughfares now
look like a gold field just after the dredges have passed over.
However, James \V. McDonnell, superintendent of buildings and

declares that the present
| state is only temporary, and that the
work is being carried out in the ef
fort to improve traffic conditions on
the campus.
The two projects, expected to be
I completed by June 1, will turn
| Santa Teresa and Lomita Drive into
' 60-feet-wide roadways, with ma
-1 cadam surfaces.
WIDENED 2000 FEET
Lomita Drive, the western bound
i ary of the Quad, is being widened
for 2000 feet, from Santa Teres:.
| Street to the Chemistry Building.
The new road, approximately twice
as wide as the present one, will
eliminate the old curves.
Oiled macadam sidewalks, 8 feet
wide, will be constructed on the
west side of the new road, along its
whole length. On the east side a
similar sidewalk will extend from
Serra Street to Panama Street (Press
corner).
LOMITA TO P.O.
The construction on Santa Teresa
takes in about 1000 feet, from Lo
mita Drive to the post office. In or
der to widen the roadway to 60 feet,
it was necessary to transplant 14
trees near the corner of Lomita and
Santa Teresa. Mr. McDonnell, with
justifiable pride, boasts, "Every one
of them is still growing."
The hedge that formerly secluded
The Oaks has been removed, as have
j been some of the trees. However,
the largest oak tree will be pre
served in a traffic island.
TRAFFIC REROUTED
When the job is completed traffic
will be rerouted so thot cars going
east toward the post office will swing
to the right behind the P.O. in order
to reach Lasuen Street. Cars turn
ing from Lasuen into Santa Teresa
will turn as they do now, going past
the north side of the post office.
Some detouring will be necessary
later on. Traffic headed west will
detour to the west of the Chemistry
Building to avoid Lomita Drive.
S Traffic on Santa Teresa will turn at
| Roble, pass in front of Roble, head
I south, and proceed along Lagunita
| Drive to the post office.
Mr. McDonnell estimates the total
expense at $22,000. The work is be
ing carried out by Piazza and Hunt
ley, San Jose contractors.
