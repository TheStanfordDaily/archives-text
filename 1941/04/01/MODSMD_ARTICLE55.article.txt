# Farm Oarsmen Lose to O.S.C. In Crew Debut
## 
### 
Entering into competition for the
first time in twenty-two years, the
Stanford crew lost a hard-fought
race to a more powerful and expe
rnieced Oregon Slate crew on the
Oakland Estuary on Saturday, March
22. The course was over two thou
sand meters (about a mile and a
quarter).
Starting off at an excessive forty
eight strokes to the minute, the Car
dinal crew soon drpoped two lengths
behind the Oregon State boat. The
Beavers started off at thirty-two,
then dropped to a steady twenty
nine, a rate which they never
changed for the rest of the race.
About halfway down the course,
the crew hit smoother water. Clary,
rowing stroke, dropped the rate to
thirty-six, and the Stanford boat
began to look like a real crew. They
gained back over a length and a
half, but couldn't hold on after their
fine spurt. Oregon State rowed
steadily away at the finish to win
by two lengths.
EFFORT COMMENDABLE
Under the circumstances, the
crew's effort was quite commendable.
They met a group of experienced
oarsmen who had been training for
much longer than the Stanford men.
Added to this was the difficulty in
getting a good crew together. Two
weeks before the race the crew that
had been training together all quar
ter began to disintegrate. Taylor,
Cox and Reese were unable to row.
Bob Schaeffer, an experienced oars
man who rowed for Tabor Academy, v
was recruited the morning the race
was to take place.
STANFORD CREW
The Stanford crew was: bow, Bob
Porter; No. 2. Burl Cobb; No. 3, Bob
Schaeffer; No. 4, Roger Boas; No. 5,
Henry Melczer; No. 6, Lee Peake;
Nt. 7, Carl Gerlach; stroke, Bud
Clary; coxswain, Walt Di'ake.
With one race under their belts,
the crew is now pointing for its main
racing season. In four weeks the
first race will be held on the Oak
land Estuary with the West End
Rowing Club of San Francisco. Two
weeks later the crew will travel
south to meet one of the U.C.L.A.
crews, and the season will wind up
with a race with the tough Sacra
mento J.C. crew at Sacramento.
GERLACH LOST TO CREW
One of the greatest losses to the
crew was that of Carl Gerlach, No.
7, who did more than anyone to
build up the Stanford crew. Ger
lach dropped out from school to take
a job with the Army Ordnance Di
vision in San Francisco.
Every effort will be made this
quarter to train men who have not
been rowing for the last two quar
ters. These men can sign up for gym
credit on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday from four to six. Freshmen
and sophomores are especially
wanted.
A meeting will be held Wednes
day night at 7:30 o'clock in Room 214
of the History Building, when the
future course of the crew will be
decided tin, and a new secretary will
be elected to replace Gerlach.
All those signed up for the course,
and all those interested, are urged
to attend.

About halfway down the course,
the crew hit smoother water. Clary,
rowing stroke, dropped the rate to
thirty-six, and the Stanford boat
began to look like a real crew. They
gained back over a length and a
half, but couldn't hold on after their
fine spurt. Oregon State rowed
steadily away at the finish to win
by two lengths.
EFFORT COMMENDABLE
Under the circumstances, the
crew's effort was quite commendable.
They met a group of experienced
oarsmen who had been training for
much longer than the Stanford men.
Added to this was the difficulty in
getting a good crew together. Two
weeks before the race the crew that
had been training together all quar
ter began to disintegrate. Taylor,
Cox and Reese were unable to row.
Bob Schaeffer, an experienced oars
man who rowed for Tabor Academy, v
was recruited the morning the race
was to take place.
STANFORD CREW
The Stanford crew was: bow, Bob
Porter; No. 2. Burl Cobb; No. 3, Bob
Schaeffer; No. 4, Roger Boas; No. 5,
Henry Melczer; No. 6, Lee Peake;
Nt. 7, Carl Gerlach; stroke, Bud
Clary; coxswain, Walt Di'ake.
With one race under their belts,
the crew is now pointing for its main
racing season. In four weeks the
first race will be held on the Oak
land Estuary with the West End
Rowing Club of San Francisco. Two
weeks later the crew will travel
south to meet one of the U.C.L.A.
crews, and the season will wind up
with a race with the tough Sacra
mento J.C. crew at Sacramento.
GERLACH LOST TO CREW
One of the greatest losses to the
crew was that of Carl Gerlach, No.
7, who did more than anyone to
build up the Stanford crew. Ger
lach dropped out from school to take
a job with the Army Ordnance Di
vision in San Francisco.
Every effort will be made this
quarter to train men who have not
been rowing for the last two quar
ters. These men can sign up for gym
credit on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday from four to six. Freshmen
and sophomores are especially
wanted.
A meeting will be held Wednes
day night at 7:30 o'clock in Room 214
of the History Building, when the
future course of the crew will be
decided tin, and a new secretary will
be elected to replace Gerlach.
All those signed up for the course,
and all those interested, are urged
to attend.
