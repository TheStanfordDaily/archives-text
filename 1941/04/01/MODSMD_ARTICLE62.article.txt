Clark Shaughnessy's Model "T"
rolled out of the garage where it
has been in storage since January 1,
and after preliminary trial spins to
day and tomorrow will go into the
Spring Practice repair shop, where
mechanics Shaughnessy, Schwartz,
Bengston and Lawson will attempt to
replace parts lost by graduation.

aspirants at the Encina Cymnasium
today and Â«i!l men planning to re
port will' meet with the coaches to
morrow afternoon at 4:30 o'clock in
Room 214 of the B.A.C. Building.
The semi-annual inventory will
show that the Indians have lost three
regulars and ten other lettermen
from the 1940 squad, which rolled
through the Pacific Coast Confer
ence without a loss and climaxed the
j season with a 21-13 victory over
Nebraska in the Pose Bowl. Gone
will be Stan Graff, left end; Hugh
i Gallarneau, right half; and Norm
J Standlee, fullback; while Clem
j Tomerlin and Bill Willard, reserves
; for left end; "Cookie" South and
John Casey, sub right halves; and
Rod Parker, reserve fullback, are
also through.
Other lettermen lost include: John
Kerman and Chick Orme. guards;
Jake Thompson and Jim Verdieck,
I centers; and Thor Peterson, quar
! terback.
Chief Mechanic Shaughnessy to
day invited every man in the Uni
versity who is interested, regardless
i of whether or not he has had any
football experience, to report for
spring practice. He said, "I'd like
nothing more than to have two hun
dred men out there this spring. Size
and experience are not important as
the system we employ gives every
one a chance."
Members of the 1940 freshman
I team, which was undefeated in six
sanies, are expected to bolster up
some of the weaker spots. Among the
yearlings who are expected to make
the strongest bids are: Jim Ellis,
end; Jim Cox and Jean Lamoure,
I tackles; Bill Joslyn and Kelly Ross,
j guards; Loren LaPrade, center;
Frank Forbes, quarterback: Bob
Koch and Bob Mitchell, halves;
Buck Fawcett and John Kenward,
fullbacks.
Although definite plans have not
been completed, the first field ses
j sion will probably be held Thursday
afternoon. Practices will run from
3:45 to 5:45 o'clock, although hash
ers will be dismissed earlier. The
thirty drills allowed by conference
rules will terminate with a final
workout on Saturday, May 31.
