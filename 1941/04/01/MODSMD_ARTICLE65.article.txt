# Card Hoopmen Close Season With Losses in Cougar Series
## 
### 
All good things must come to an end. And so it was with Stanford's
basketball team, champions of the southern division of the Pacific Coast
Conference, who were defeated, in the play-offs for the coast crown by
J Washington State College.
The Cougars took the title with two consecutive victories, downing the

Indians, 46 43, Friday night (March,
14), and 44-40, Saturday night.
Washington State had a real basket
! ball team, and made a good showing
in the N.C.A.A. tourney for the Pa
cific Coast, winning the western
{ r inals, 04-53, from Arkansas Univer
i sity. In the national finals, however,
j the Cougars were beaten, 39-34, by
I Wisconsin.
The Cards started the series like
j a house afire, playing what Coach
Everett Dean described as their top
brand of basketball. But in the sec
ond half Washington State started
to drive, and although Stanford was
i still playing good ball, the Cougars
| weren't to be denied. They played
red-hot basketball and overcame the
| Indians' half-time lead with a few
I points to spare.
W.S.C. ALL THE WAY
In the second game it was Wash
| ington State all the way, Stanford
j only threatening seriously near the
end of the contest. Big Paul Linde-
T».an was more than the Indians
'.•ould handle, p?. he rang up 14 points
to lead the Cougar attack.
L'ndeman was the key to the whole
Cougar attack, for while Stanford
was going great guns at the start of
the first game, Lindeman was not
playing under the backboard. As
i ronn as he started to really rebound
in the second half, the Cougars
moved out and overtook the In
i dians.
SAD END TO SEASON
The series defeat put a sad ending
J on one of the most successful bas
' ketball seasons Stanford has had
' ;ince the Luisetti era. The Indians
;ufTered only three defeats during
'he entire season prior to the Wash
| : nv;ton Slate games. Early in the
reason Indiana University downed
j the Indians and during the confer-
I once season U.C.L.A. and Cal each
took a game from Coach Dean's
j charges.
Prospects are bright for a good
•eason next year, for three regulars
from this year's first quintet return
j for action. They are Bill Cowden,
""ordy Anderson, and Don Burness.
<on Davidson and Don Wililams,
i 00-captains of this season's team,
both graduate.
