# RCAF Rejects Card Gridders
## 
### 
Norm Standlee, Stanford fullback,
and Jake Thompson, second-string
center, both members of Clark
Shaughnessy's Rose Bowl team, were
back at Stanford yesterday regis
tering for spring quarter, after a
three weeks' hitch-hiking tour to
British Columbia.
The two men left the campus
about a week before final exams
without telling friends where they
intended to go. A telegram in
formed members of their fraternity
that they were in Vancouver, at
tempting to enlist in the Canadian
air force.
Standlee, it was learned, was re
jected because of color-blindness,
while Thompson was admitted but
decided not to part company with
"the Chief." Both men were ad
mitted to the army and, it is ru
mored, were offered positions as "in
structors" because of their univer
sity training. They decided, how
ever, that they would enter Stanford
again because their interest in en
listing centered about the actual
flying experience which was denied
them.
According to Dean of Men John
Bunn, both men are in "good stand
ing" with University officials but
must finish courses in which they
were given incompletes last quarter.
If those requirements are fulfilled,
Thompson will graduate in June and
Standlee will have two quarters be
fore graduation.
