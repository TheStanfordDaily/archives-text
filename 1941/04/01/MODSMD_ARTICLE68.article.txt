## 
### 
Howard Adams, conference div-
I ing champion and a key man on
the Stanford squad, placed sixth
in the high hoard and fifth in the
low hoard events he'd by the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
te n in East Lansing, Mich., last
week.
Adarns ran into scholastic diffi
culties last quarter and was de
clared ineligible for further compe
tition. His loss will be keenly felt
by the Indian squad which is be
ginning preparations for the confer
ence meets. Diving duties are now
delegated to Bill Niccolls.
CARDS TO MEET BRUINS
Two undefeated swimming teams
will clash Friday afternoon in En
cina Pools when Stanford meets
U.C.L.A. Stanford boasts six straight
wins as against five straight of the
Uclans.
U.C.L.A. has never won a meet
against the Indians, although Stan
ford won by only one point last
year (38-37). The Bruins have a
great array of free-stylers and are
basing their hopes on the 50, 100,
and 400-yard free-style races. Key
man for the Bruins is Captain Bill
Kuehne, the Pacific Coast's greatest
short dash man.
The Indians will rely on Co-cap
tains Roy Vitousek and Bill Weeden
along with the sophomore star, Doc
Colyear, for the lion's share of their
points. Expecting to score heavily in
300-yard medley relay, 220, 440
| backstroke and breaststroke, the In
dians have high hopes of maintain
ing their streak.
, FREESTYLE RELAY
This event may be the deciding
I factor of the meet. The Bruins boast
the greatest relay team in the con
ference and are capable of approxi
mately 3:42. The Indians have turned
in 3:42.6 in practice. However, if
Vitousek has to swim the grueling
200-yard breaststroke Ihe Indians
J cannot hope to touch Ihe Bruins with
| a tired Roy swimming the anchor
j lap.
If Vitousek can be kept out of the
j breaststroke without losing the
1 meet, the Indians and Br .ins should
j stage one of the closest races ever
I seen in Encina Pools. Smith, Vitou
j sek, Miller, and Regnelds will swim
I this race for Stanford and Chandler,
j Schwaub, Siegal, and Kuehne will
j swim for U.C.L.A.
LAST YEAR'S MEET
Last year's meet was as close as
jit was possible to be (37-38). This
[ year's meet promises to be equally
i close and exciting. The Indians hope
:to win before the relay, and the
Bruins cannot hope to win wilhout
! the final relay. Should Stanford win
| this final event it would give them a
winning margin of around 7 or 8
I point, despite the closeness of the
j competition. Every point in every
event is bound to be of importance.
According to Coach Nort Thorn
ton, Friday's meet is certain to be
one of the best and most closely
contested of the year.
