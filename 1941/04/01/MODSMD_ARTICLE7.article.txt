## Well Known Actress To Give Impressions Of Famous Persons 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Cecilia Loftus, known as "Cissie"
to players and patrons the world
over, will open the Tuesday Eve
ning Series for the spring quarter
tonight at 7:30 in the auditorium of
the Memorial Hall. She will give her
program of "Impressions and Im
personations," it was announced by
the Committee on Public Exercises.
Cecilia Loftus set all London talk
ing about her impersonations in
1893, and after five decades of legiti
mate, vaudeville, and motion picture
acting, she still has people talking
about her performances.
STARTLING ACCURACY
Her voiee has echoed with start
ling accuracy hundreds of well
known personalities, from the
throaty singing of Florence Reed to
the East Side accents of Fanny
Brice. She may impersonate John
or Ethel Barrymore or Sarah Bern
hardt at her stateliest—or success
fully imitate Gertrude Lawrence or
Beatrice Lillie.
"Cissie" made her first appear
ance at 14 on the stage of the Al
hambra in Belfast singing the bal
lad "Molly Darling," and at 15 she
was at the Oxford Music Hall in
London achieving instantaneous
popularity by her simplicity and
complete absence of makeup.
DISCOVERED BY SULLIVAN
Her vocal abilities were discovered
by Sir Arthur Sullivan, who took
her to Blanche Marchesi for a try
out. "Cissie" was surprised to learn
that she had an unusual voice fit for
grand opera. Her mother felt, how
ver, that the music hall was her
world, and since she had lived in it
all her life, she didn't know any
other.
Miss Loftus' career on the stage
has been varied. She left the Lon
don music halls to come to this
country in 1900 when she appeared
in comic opera as Bettina in "The
Mascot."
She played Viola in "Twelfth
Night," Hero in "Much Ado About
Nothing." She then worked under
Daniel Frohman, appearing in "The
Man of Forty." She was leading
lady for three years with E. H.
Sothern in "Ophelia" and "If I Were
King."
Miss Lnftus is now in Hollywood
where she has appeared with De
anna Durbin in "It's a Da? e," Shir
ley Temple in "The Blue Bird,"
Bctte Davis in "The Old Maid," and
Ronald Colman and Ginger Rogers
in "Lucky Partners."
What it is that makes Cissie Lof
tus, what faculty is hers by which
she reproduces so strikingly the
tones and mannerisms of other folk
of the stage, nobody has every been
able to explain.
She has said, "Don't ask me how
I do it. People have asked me for
years, and the truth is, I don't know.
I do know that it is not a matter of
gestures; they are easy enough to
duplicate, and they don't mean any
thing unless I have actually 'got'
the person I'm trying to do.
STUDIES BREATH TIMING
"Gestures are all on the surface.
I do know that it has something to
do with the timing of the breath, for
1 could do Caruso's voice before I
ever heard him sing by studying
his breathing on a phonograph rec
ord. The imitation came to me as
soon as I had caught the timing."
Miss Loftus describes her program
as "The Sound of Many Voices," and
she will select from an extensive
repertoire upon the inspiration of
the audience and the moment, as is
her custom. Her repertoire includes
the great figures of Sarah Bern
hardt, Mrs. Fiske, and Mrs. Pat
rick Campbell.
CONTEMPORARY STAGE
Impersonating such women of the
contemporary stage as Ethel Barry
more, Pauline Lord, Constance Col
lier, Gertrude Lawrence, Jeanne Ea
gles, Lynn Fontanne, and Norma
Shearer, Miss Loftus will select
speeches or scenes from plays re
cently popular, including "The King
dom of God," "Idiot's Delight," "Su
san and God," and "Rain."
She also reads from plays in which
she has appeared, among which are
"Romeo and Juliet," "The Devil
Passes," "Storm Over Patsy," and
"Juno and the Paycock." She has
written for herself an original im
personation of a "London Flower
Girl."

where she has appeared with De
anna Durbin in "It's a Da? e," Shir
ley Temple in "The Blue Bird,"
Bctte Davis in "The Old Maid," and
Ronald Colman and Ginger Rogers
in "Lucky Partners."
What it is that makes Cissie Lof
tus, what faculty is hers by which
she reproduces so strikingly the
tones and mannerisms of other folk
of the stage, nobody has every been
able to explain.
She has said, "Don't ask me how
I do it. People have asked me for
years, and the truth is, I don't know.
I do know that it is not a matter of
gestures; they are easy enough to
duplicate, and they don't mean any
thing unless I have actually 'got'
the person I'm trying to do.
STUDIES BREATH TIMING
"Gestures are all on the surface.
I do know that it has something to
do with the timing of the breath, for
1 could do Caruso's voice before I
ever heard him sing by studying
his breathing on a phonograph rec
ord. The imitation came to me as
soon as I had caught the timing."
Miss Loftus describes her program
as "The Sound of Many Voices," and
she will select from an extensive
repertoire upon the inspiration of
the audience and the moment, as is
her custom. Her repertoire includes
the great figures of Sarah Bern
hardt, Mrs. Fiske, and Mrs. Pat
rick Campbell.
CONTEMPORARY STAGE
Impersonating such women of the
contemporary stage as Ethel Barry
more, Pauline Lord, Constance Col
lier, Gertrude Lawrence, Jeanne Ea
gles, Lynn Fontanne, and Norma
Shearer, Miss Loftus will select
speeches or scenes from plays re
cently popular, including "The King
dom of God," "Idiot's Delight," "Su
san and God," and "Rain."
She also reads from plays in which
she has appeared, among which are
"Romeo and Juliet," "The Devil
Passes," "Storm Over Patsy," and
"Juno and the Paycock." She has
written for herself an original im
personation of a "London Flower
Girl."
Cecilia Loftus, known as "Cissie"
to players and patrons the world
over, will open the Tuesday Eve
ning Series for the spring quarter
tonight at 7:30 in the auditorium of
the Memorial Hall. She will give her
program of "Impressions and Im
personations," it was announced by
the Committee on Public Exercises.
Cecilia Loftus set all London talk
ing about her impersonations in
1893, and after five decades of legiti
mate, vaudeville, and motion picture
acting, she still has people talking
about her performances.
STARTLING ACCURACY
Her voiee has echoed with start
ling accuracy hundreds of well
known personalities, from the
throaty singing of Florence Reed to
the East Side accents of Fanny
Brice. She may impersonate John
or Ethel Barrymore or Sarah Bern
hardt at her stateliest—or success
fully imitate Gertrude Lawrence or
Beatrice Lillie.
"Cissie" made her first appear
ance at 14 on the stage of the Al
hambra in Belfast singing the bal
lad "Molly Darling," and at 15 she
was at the Oxford Music Hall in
London achieving instantaneous
popularity by her simplicity and
complete absence of makeup.
DISCOVERED BY SULLIVAN
Her vocal abilities were discovered
by Sir Arthur Sullivan, who took
her to Blanche Marchesi for a try
out. "Cissie" was surprised to learn
that she had an unusual voice fit for
grand opera. Her mother felt, how
ver, that the music hall was her
world, and since she had lived in it
all her life, she didn't know any
other.
Miss Loftus' career on the stage
has been varied. She left the Lon
don music halls to come to this
country in 1900 when she appeared
in comic opera as Bettina in "The
Mascot."
She played Viola in "Twelfth
Night," Hero in "Much Ado About
Nothing." She then worked under
Daniel Frohman, appearing in "The
Man of Forty." She was leading
lady for three years with E. H.
Sothern in "Ophelia" and "If I Were
King."
Miss Lnftus is now in Hollywood
where she has appeared with De

over, will open the Tuesday Eve
ning Series for the spring quarter
tonight at 7:30 in the auditorium of
the Memorial Hall. She will give her
program of "Impressions and Im
personations," it was announced by
the Committee on Public Exercises.
Cecilia Loftus set all London talk
ing about her impersonations in
1893, and after five decades of legiti
mate, vaudeville, and motion picture
acting, she still has people talking
about her performances.
STARTLING ACCURACY
Her voiee has echoed with start
ling accuracy hundreds of well
known personalities, from the
throaty singing of Florence Reed to
the East Side accents of Fanny
Brice. She may impersonate John
or Ethel Barrymore or Sarah Bern
hardt at her stateliest—or success
fully imitate Gertrude Lawrence or
Beatrice Lillie.
"Cissie" made her first appear
ance at 14 on the stage of the Al
hambra in Belfast singing the bal
lad "Molly Darling," and at 15 she
was at the Oxford Music Hall in
London achieving instantaneous
popularity by her simplicity and
complete absence of makeup.
DISCOVERED BY SULLIVAN
Her vocal abilities were discovered
by Sir Arthur Sullivan, who took
her to Blanche Marchesi for a try
out. "Cissie" was surprised to learn
that she had an unusual voice fit for
grand opera. Her mother felt, how
ver, that the music hall was her
world, and since she had lived in it
all her life, she didn't know any
other.
Miss Loftus' career on the stage
has been varied. She left the Lon
don music halls to come to this
country in 1900 when she appeared
in comic opera as Bettina in "The
Mascot."
She played Viola in "Twelfth
Night," Hero in "Much Ado About
Nothing." She then worked under
Daniel Frohman, appearing in "The
Man of Forty." She was leading
lady for three years with E. H.
Sothern in "Ophelia" and "If I Were
King."
Miss Lnftus is now in Hollywood
where she has appeared with De
anna Durbin in "It's a Da? e," Shir
ley Temple in "The Blue Bird,"
Bctte Davis in "The Old Maid," and
Ronald Colman and Ginger Rogers
in "Lucky Partners."
What it is that makes Cissie Lof
tus, what faculty is hers by which
she reproduces so strikingly the
tones and mannerisms of other folk
of the stage, nobody has every been
able to explain.
She has said, "Don't ask me how
I do it. People have asked me for
years, and the truth is, I don't know.
I do know that it is not a matter of
gestures; they are easy enough to
duplicate, and they don't mean any
thing unless I have actually 'got'
the person I'm trying to do.
STUDIES BREATH TIMING
"Gestures are all on the surface.
I do know that it has something to
do with the timing of the breath, for
1 could do Caruso's voice before I
ever heard him sing by studying
his breathing on a phonograph rec
ord. The imitation came to me as
soon as I had caught the timing."
Miss Loftus describes her program
as "The Sound of Many Voices," and
she will select from an extensive
repertoire upon the inspiration of
the audience and the moment, as is
her custom. Her repertoire includes
the great figures of Sarah Bern
hardt, Mrs. Fiske, and Mrs. Pat
rick Campbell.
CONTEMPORARY STAGE
Impersonating such women of the
contemporary stage as Ethel Barry
more, Pauline Lord, Constance Col
lier, Gertrude Lawrence, Jeanne Ea
gles, Lynn Fontanne, and Norma
Shearer, Miss Loftus will select
speeches or scenes from plays re
cently popular, including "The King
dom of God," "Idiot's Delight," "Su
san and God," and "Rain."
She also reads from plays in which
she has appeared, among which are
"Romeo and Juliet," "The Devil
Passes," "Storm Over Patsy," and
"Juno and the Paycock." She has
written for herself an original im
personation of a "London Flower
Girl."
