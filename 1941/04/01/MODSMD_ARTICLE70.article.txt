the second annual relay carnival here
lust week. The Blue and Gold lived
up to advance dope and showed ex
ceptional strength particularly in
distances and middle-distances. But
the Indians, with Pitch Johnson at
the helm, surprised with new talent.
CARDS LOOK GOOD
Blond Kai Larsen, the Farm's
great all-around athlete, ran a 1:55
half in the two-mile relay, after less
than a month's training. Anchoring
the two-mile team, Francis Olson,
former San Mateo J. C. star, turned
in a fine performance but couldn't
qiute catch the flying Clarence
Barnes. Burm Skrable and Blair
Hyde, teammates of Olson's at San
Mateo, also looked good in the two
mile relay.
Bringing Stanford its only victory
on the track, Ed Hertel turned in a
brilliant anchor lap in the shuttle
hurdle event. Vern Halt ran a fine
third lap in the barrier race and
tied for first in the high jump at G
feet, 1% inches.
NEW MEET RECORD
Emerson Hiler, who has been
flipping the discus way out there in
practice for two years, came through
with a new meet record of 155 feet,
1 inches. Stanford won the aggregate
shot put but the individual win went
to Cal's Bob Biles. The Indians
nosed out the Bears' javelin team by
one foot in the aggregate total, but
couldn't muster enough entries to
take the high jump or pole vault.
The Bears pretty well swept the
track, but old timers took some con
solation in the alumni walk, won by
Stanford in new meet record time.
The meet ran true to form. Along
with a couple of sportswriters, Pitch
hit the score right on the nose in his
prophecy, although he was pleas
antly surprised by the work of cer
tain of his boys.
The Fresno State dual meet sched
uled for last Saturday was rained
out, much to the disappointment of
both the Bulldogs and Cardinals.
Fresno had figured on their first
major track win, and Stanford need
ed practice badly.

Stanford in new meet record time.
The meet ran true to form. Along
with a couple of sportswriters, Pitch
hit the score right on the nose in his
prophecy, although he was pleas
antly surprised by the work of cer
tain of his boys.
The Fresno State dual meet sched
uled for last Saturday was rained
out, much to the disappointment of
both the Bulldogs and Cardinals.
Fresno had figured on their first
major track win, and Stanford need
ed practice badly.
It looks like Cal's year in (rack and field. So say the experts who
have practically ignored Stanford in their season forecast. On the coast,
(he big dual attraction will he the Bear-Tro'an meet, and the Bears are
given a good chance to heat Dean Cromwell's hoys.

up to advance dope and showed ex
ceptional strength particularly in
distances and middle-distances. But
the Indians, with Pitch Johnson at
the helm, surprised with new talent.
CARDS LOOK GOOD
Blond Kai Larsen, the Farm's
great all-around athlete, ran a 1:55
half in the two-mile relay, after less
than a month's training. Anchoring
the two-mile team, Francis Olson,
former San Mateo J. C. star, turned
in a fine performance but couldn't
qiute catch the flying Clarence
Barnes. Burm Skrable and Blair
Hyde, teammates of Olson's at San
Mateo, also looked good in the two
mile relay.
Bringing Stanford its only victory
on the track, Ed Hertel turned in a
brilliant anchor lap in the shuttle
hurdle event. Vern Halt ran a fine
third lap in the barrier race and
tied for first in the high jump at G
feet, 1% inches.
NEW MEET RECORD
Emerson Hiler, who has been
flipping the discus way out there in
practice for two years, came through
with a new meet record of 155 feet,
1 inches. Stanford won the aggregate
shot put but the individual win went
to Cal's Bob Biles. The Indians
nosed out the Bears' javelin team by
one foot in the aggregate total, but
couldn't muster enough entries to
take the high jump or pole vault.
The Bears pretty well swept the
track, but old timers took some con
solation in the alumni walk, won by
Stanford in new meet record time.
