# Rugbymen Choose Two New Captains
## 
### 
Pete Kmetovic and A1 Wool were
elected co-captains of the 1942 Stan
ford rugby team at the annual rugby
banquet immediately following the
Cal game two weeks ago. Stanford's
13-8 win climaxed a successful sea
son and won the championship of
the Northern California Rvigby Un
ion for the Indian fifteen.
Kmetovic and Wool will replace
Jake Thompson and "Pop" Barnard,
co-captains of the 1941 champions.
