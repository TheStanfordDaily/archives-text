SHAKESPEARE'S "Comedy of Errors," with a
new set of characters, played a 10-day stand
in San Francisco.
While Stanford's student body vacationed,
the story of two Farm freshmen versus the San
Francisco Police Department whirled through
intricacy after intricacy —with Carter Barber and
Don Allan as straight men and the city police
supplying both the comedy and the errors.
To sum up the straight news value of what
has occurred over the vacation:
Nothing tangible happened.
It was a comedy pure and simple. Digging
dangerously deep in their efforts to clear the two
accused officers, the Police Department suc
ceeded in unearthing several more beating
cases from the past, and in staging one more
against a 15-year-old San Francisco high school
boy.
A pair of surprise witnesses appeared to
further strengthen the part played by the two
Stanford frosh. The first, who was in South
City Station during the evening in question,
swears he saw one of the frosh being beaten.
The second has sworn on the witness stand
that police officials offered him a trip to Alaska
if he would offer as evidence a story of seeing
the two boys involved in a waterfront fracas
during the evening in question.
Those were the errors.
The comedy was offered by the Police Com
mission. Chameleon-like, they divided their
time between ripping into existing conditions
within the police department and emotional dia
tribes against the evidence offered by the two
Stanford men.
Right now commission members are mulling
over the weighty transcript of the trial, attempt
ing to reach a decision before the end of the
week.
%
And thereby will hang the tale.
