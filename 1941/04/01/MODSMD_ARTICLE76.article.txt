# 73rd Birthday Party
## 
### 
WHILE Stanford and Stanford students holi
dayed over the between-the-quarters va
cation, the University of California celebrated a
birthday.
Charter Week at Berkeley celebrated the 73rd
anniversary of the California university which
has become one of the largest educational in
stitutions in the world.
Five days ago, on March 27, California stu
dents, faculty and alumni paid tribute on their
Charter Day. And a tribute of the finest sort
was also paid Stanford Univeresity and its Pres
ident, Ray Lyman Wilbur.
The tribute to Stanford was the commemora
tion, during the Charter Day exercises, of the
Farm's 50th anniversary. California men and
women honored Stanford's birthday with their
own.
President Wilbur delivered California's Char
ter Day address, wearing, in honor of the occa
sion, the cap and gown he forbears donning at
Farm Commencement exercises. Other mem
bers of the Farm faculty were also guests of
honor at the California birthday.
The toast delivered to Dr. Wilbur came in the
form of a plaque presented him by the Asso
ciated Students of the University of California.
Pleased and flustered by the unexpected tribute,
Dr. Wilbur's expression of appreciation ended
with the puckish remark:
"I don't know where I'll put this plaque. Our
trophy case is already full of trophies that the
University of California has given to Stanford."
It was a splendid birthday party.
