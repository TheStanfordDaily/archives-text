NOT infrequently the cry goes on high that
about twice a week some new Stanford or
ganization is asking you to contribute to the
coffers of the something-or-other fund.
And it must be admitted that the Farm cal
ender is liberally blotched with drives to save
this and that starving nation, or to provide
crayons for this and that migratory workers'
camp. The point is, in a monetary sense, well
taken.
It is difficult to contribute something real,
something material such as a dime or a dollar
or a pair of shoes in return for nothing—or at
best, for only the psychic satisfaction of know
ing you have helped some person who cannot
help himself.
Now another campus drive is gathering mo
mentum. Busy committee members under the
able scurrying of Graham Barbey are polishing
up on the best styles of bell-hops' uplifted palms
in preparation for Convalescent Home Week
which begins April 18.
But they strike a new note in drive music,

since they do not ask you to contribute some
thing in return for nothing. In return for your
contributed something they are offering you
something. Your dimes and dollars and bodily
assistance v/ill be repaid with dances and bar
becues and boathouse festivities and a host of
varied entertainment.
This drive won't hurt as much. Help where
you can. You will be getting something for your
something.—B. A.
