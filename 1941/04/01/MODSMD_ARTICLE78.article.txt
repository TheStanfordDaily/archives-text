### JERRY MAYER 
SO THE STOItY GOES
W/RITE something vital, says my conscience.
Write something funny, you toad, says the editor.
Write something risque, you roue, says an anony
mous friend, who realizes that the deans would let
me get away with it because I'm such a helluva good
guy.

Realizing the tremendous responsibility that accrues
to the writer of this column, I decided to track down
my immediate predecessors, Sherman Mellinkoff, Bud
Ames, and Dwight Hutchinson. I wanted to find out if
they had any ideas as to how this column should be
conducted.
"Tell me, Sherm, old noodle," I said one night when
we were stagging it at Earl Carroll's, "were you just
infatuated with the column? Did you get a thrill from
its manufacture?"
"Yes," he said, buying seven cartons of cigarettes
from the cigarette girl with the beautiful legs. The
girl gave Sherm stock smile number IG-X, which is
reserved strictly for draftees in class 1-A, and passed
on to the next table. "Tell me, Sherm, old thing, do
you think I'm capable of following in your footsteps,"
I asked tremulously.
"Yes," he said, trying to resell the cigarettes to the
rest of us (at a profit). I hugged him to my bosom.
"You really think so?" I trilled.
"Yes," he said, throwing a peanut at the second
girl from the left in the first row. "You're not joshing
me, Sherm, old bean," I inquired, my head in the
clouds.
"No," he said, as twelve bouncers (all scabs) threw
him out of the door.

jV"EXT I turned to Bud Ames for advice. "Tell me,
Bud, old fruitcake, do you feel you made any
friends writing this column?"
"No," he said, running down the street after a
little queen.
I caught up with him with some difficulty, he being
very determined to catch up with the little beauty.
"Do you have any suggestions for me?" I asked, my
voice drooling with sincerity.
"Yes," he said, "get out of my way. She made a
right turn at the next block." We sped around the
corner after the little creature.
"Did your writing the column get you any more
dates on campus," I pressed, my very life depending
upon the answer. We had almost caught up with the
little bombshell. "No," he answered, "I haven't had a
date since spring quarter in my freshman year when
I was the only one in the class who had the outside
reading notes."
We had caught up with the little bag and were
returning homeward from Mountain View. "Tell me,
old man, do you do this sort of thing often?"
"Yes," he said, "ever since I finished writing Bull
Session."

TXUTCHINSON was easy to find. He was trying to
hit me for the five-spot I borrowed. Disengaging
his hot little palms from my wallet, I asked him what
he thought of Bull Session.
"They're fine things," he said, "very good for im
proving the mindâ€”that is, until you get on the second
subject."
"No, old egg, I mean the column in The Daily," I
explained.
"Oh, of course," he said, "everyone should read it.
Fine piece of work."
"I don't think you understand, old avocado." I was
adamant. "I mean the column you wrote."
"My God, was that the column I wrote," squeaked
Hutchinson >and staggered down the street, my wallet
firmly entrenched in his hawklike claw.
Obviously, the tremendous responsibility entrusted
to me will be very difficult to handle. I hope that I
can be as competent and level-headed as my prede
cessors.
