THAT LOATHSOME KOAI)

r JTHE EDITOR, SIR:
I don't wish to seem to be complaining about the
condition of the campus roads. I own no car myself;
so it is of no direct concern to me whether or not
tires are smashed and springs broken. But something
more serious has occurred.
A few days ago one of our freshmen, a certain Joe
McSnitch, was returning from the fraternity to Encina,
and was driving past the east side of the hall in his
Austin when the car disappeared completely in one of
the yawning caverns that pock the road at that point.
He really wasn't much of a fellow, and we don't
miss him badly, but I feel that for the sake of his
parents the university should obtain grappling hooks
and drag for his body. I trust that your co-operation
can be enlisted in this matter.
Hopefully,
Gurk, '42

BOUQUETS TO BUILDERS

TP HE EDITOR, SIR:
May I use your columns to thank publicly those
non-Ram's Head people who have made it possible for
Ram's Head to produce its annual onc-act program
this month? The following gave up all or part of their
spring "vacation" and stayed on campus, building the
sets for the shows: Bob Andreini, Mary Lou Linsley,
Gus Hebgen, Merle Meacham, Chuck Phelps, Janice
Schwensen, aPt O'Brien, Hubert Heffner, Jr.
Sincerely,
Bud Cady
Technical Director

BETTER LATE THAN . . .

r EDITOR, SIR:
It is well worth the risk to triteness to be able
to thank publicly the hundred or more seniors who
gave time and effort in preparation for the Senior
Prom.
The decorations, provided by Marge Tight and John
Piel, were completely designed and constructed by
students. The faculty-cartoon figures were the work
of Bob Andreini and Kirk Stevenson. To these, to
Mary Lou Gretzer Wheeler, Betty Auger, Ann Kille
fer, Jim Farqueson, Jim Lincoln, Bob Beckham, and
Maurnice Knox and to the many seniors who helped
them, the class owes a real debt.
The class also owes a vote of appreciation to Coach
Everett Dean, who changed his basketball practice
schedule, so that the Prom might be held in the
Pavilion.

the yawning caverns that pock the road at that point.
He really wasn't much of a fellow, and we don't
miss him badly, but I feel that for the sake of his
parents the university should obtain grappling hooks
and drag for his body. I trust that your co-operation
can be enlisted in this matter.
Hopefully,

BOUQUETS TO BUILDERS

TP HE EDITOR, SIR:
May I use your columns to thank publicly those
non-Ram's Head people who have made it possible for
Ram's Head to produce its annual onc-act program
this month? The following gave up all or part of their
spring "vacation" and stayed on campus, building the
sets for the shows: Bob Andreini, Mary Lou Linsley,
Gus Hebgen, Merle Meacham, Chuck Phelps, Janice
Schwensen, aPt O'Brien, Hubert Heffner, Jr.
Sincerely,
Bud Cady
Technical Director

BETTER LATE THAN . . .

r EDITOR, SIR:
It is well worth the risk to triteness to be able
to thank publicly the hundred or more seniors who
gave time and effort in preparation for the Senior
Prom.
The decorations, provided by Marge Tight and John
Piel, were completely designed and constructed by
students. The faculty-cartoon figures were the work
of Bob Andreini and Kirk Stevenson. To these, to
Mary Lou Gretzer Wheeler, Betty Auger, Ann Kille
fer, Jim Farqueson, Jim Lincoln, Bob Beckham, and
Maurnice Knox and to the many seniors who helped
them, the class owes a real debt.
The class also owes a vote of appreciation to Coach
Everett Dean, who changed his basketball practice
schedule, so that the Prom might be held in the
Pavilion.

Senior Prom Committee

r JTHE EDITOR, SIR:
I don't wish to seem to be complaining about the
condition of the campus roads. I own no car myself;
so it is of no direct concern to me whether or not
tires are smashed and springs broken. But something
more serious has occurred.
A few days ago one of our freshmen, a certain Joe
McSnitch, was returning from the fraternity to Encina,
and was driving past the east side of the hall in his
Austin when the car disappeared completely in one of
the yawning caverns that pock the road at that point.
He really wasn't much of a fellow, and we don't
miss him badly, but I feel that for the sake of his
parents the university should obtain grappling hooks
and drag for his body. I trust that your co-operation
can be enlisted in this matter.
