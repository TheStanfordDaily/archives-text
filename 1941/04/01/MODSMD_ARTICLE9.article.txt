## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
While decision on possible punishment of the two San Francisco police
officers accused of beating Stanford freshmen Don Allan and Carter Barber
was momentarily being awaited last night, Mayor Angclo J. Rossi prom
ised that "neither the Police Commission nor the Chief of Policc or my
self will tolerate or condone brutality" in a communication to Daily Editor
Wilson Cannon.
Deliberating since Wednesday night, following conclusion of hearings,
the Police Commission was expected to hand down its decision sometime

this week, possibly last night as re-,
ported in at least one city paper.
INVESTIGATION THOROUGH
Mayor Rossi told Cannon:
. . I have followed the progress
of the hearing before the Police
Commission very closely. You may
rest assured that misleading re
ports to the contrary notwithstand
ing, neither the Police Commission
nor the chief of police nor myself will
tolerate or condone brutality. I am
certain that this investigation will
be most thorough and that ulti
mately justice will be done."
Since identification of Policemen
John Desmond and Joseph Green,
whom the two students accused di
rectly at San Francisco's Southern
Station of having beaten them "with
out provocation," hearings have
been highlighted by testimony of
Bill Steif, Encina chum of the pair,
by the bringing to light of some five
other asserted beatings, and by at
tempts to challenge the character of
the freshmen.
The two were arrested for va
grancy while on a sociological tour
of the city's slum districts, and
charge they were subsequently at
tacked by the officers while being
booked.
IMPERTINENT TESTIMONY
While Allan was abed with a cold
at his Woodside home, Barber last
night told The Daily, "The hearings
were very lengthy, with a lot of
pertinent and impertinent testimony.
I think the Commissioners were
sincere in getting to the bottom of
the case from both sides.
"In connection with our original
purpose, we learned a great deal
about how justice is administered,
