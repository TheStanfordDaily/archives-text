INTERNAT lON ALLY speaking
yesterday was comparatively dull.
Of course several things happened:

The British took Asmara in Ethi
opia; Hitler said that Roosevelt had
practically rent international law
asunder when he took over those
foreign ships; Roosevelt retorted
with the diplomatic equivalent of
"so what" and beamed benignly as
most of the Latin American coun
tries did a little ship-grabbing of
their own; the Greeks beat up on
another contingent of Italians; and
the Serbs jockeyed with the Croats
and the Nazis.

None of these incidents is exactly
minor. But considering what's been
happening during the last few days
and what's probably going to hap
pen during the next few days, yes
terday was a welcome breather for
a punch-drunk world.

JJTERR HITLER'S puppet press has
not yet told the German people
about this country's seizure of 28
Italian, 2 German, and 39 Danish
vessels anchored in various Ameri
can harbors. But one of those "au
thorized spokesman" lashed out (to
the foreign newsmen in Berlin) with
the statement that the action was
"an absolute violation of human
rights."

Germany, lie said in effect, is
amazed at the United States' in
terference since "German crews
have full right to damage ships in
any way they s< fit, so long as
the damage not endanger
American harbors." It was as
sumed both Germany and Italy
would demand return of the ships
or full reparations. Denmark
didn't even squeak. Washington
went ahead with blanket orders
for immediate prosecution of offi
cers and crew members who sabo
taged one German and 25 Italian
ships.

Mexico hopped onto the band
wagon yesterday, seizing 12 Italian
and German ships, and Venezuela
picked up three Italian tankers, ap
parently in an effort to keep the
Italians and Germans from clutter
ing up her ports with driftwood.
Earlier one German and three Ital
ian freighters had been scuttled at
Puerto Cabello. Peru had three Ger
man freighters set afire in her baili
wick. Cuba bagged one Italian ship,
and Ecuador observed a nice little
bonfire kindled by the crew of a
Nazi freighter in Guayaquil harbor.

To date the total of Axis shipping
seized, damaged or scuttled in this
hemisphere exceeds 300,000 tons.

jp'NGLISH, Indian and Scottish
Highlander troops whizzed along
the road to Massawa tonight after
taking Asmara, the city from which
the Italians launched the main of
fensive on Ethiopia during 1935-36.
With the British in complete control
of the Gulf of Aden, all means of
retreat are now cut off for the re
maining Italian forces in Eritrea and
Somaliland, and Ethiopia.
As battalions of veteran Nazi
parachute trops lined her borders,
Yugoslavian sources hinted at a
possible mutual assistance pact be
tween the Balkan nation and Tur
key, and an understanding of some
sort with Russia. Basis for this ru
mor was an announcement that
Yugoslav minister to Moscow, Milan
Gabrilovitch, had flown to Ankara,
where he conferred with Turkish
leaders and then rushed back to
Moscow.

J NSIDE Yugoslavia, the new gov
ernment is shuffling key positions
in the provinces, no doubt attempt
ing to remove men in sympathy with
Prince Paul's appeasement group.
Croatian leaders are conferring with
Serb and Slovene leaders, and a
possible "solid front" coalition of the
three major Yugoslavian groups ap
peared dimly on the horizon.
Italy has offered her ambassa
dor's "good offices" and is appar
ently attempting to act as media
tor. Her frantic interest in the
Yugoslavs becomes apparent when
you look at a map. A hostile
Yugoslavia would put the battered
Italian forces in Albania between
a very nasty cross-fire.
Oh yes, it is probably significant
that London has had no bomb at
tacks for 12 consecutive days.

vessels anchored in various Ameri

the foreign newsmen in Berlin) with
the statement that the action was
"an absolute violation of human
rights."

Germany, lie said in effect, is
amazed at the United States' in
terference since "German crews
have full right to damage ships in
any way they s< fit, so long as
the damage not endanger
American harbors." It was as
sumed both Germany and Italy
would demand return of the ships
or full reparations. Denmark
didn't even squeak. Washington
went ahead with blanket orders
for immediate prosecution of offi

taged one German and 25 Italian
ships.

Mexico hopped onto the band
wagon yesterday, seizing 12 Italian
and German ships, and Venezuela
picked up three Italian tankers, ap

Italians and Germans from clutter
ing up her ports with driftwood.
Earlier one German and three Ital
ian freighters had been scuttled at
Puerto Cabello. Peru had three Ger
man freighters set afire in her baili
wick. Cuba bagged one Italian ship,
and Ecuador observed a nice little
bonfire kindled by the crew of a

To date the total of Axis shipping
seized, damaged or scuttled in this

that London has had no bomb at
tacks for 12 consecutive days.
INTERNAT lON ALLY speaking
yesterday was comparatively dull.
Of course several things happened:

The British took Asmara in Ethi
opia; Hitler said that Roosevelt had
practically rent international law
asunder when he took over those
foreign ships; Roosevelt retorted
with the diplomatic equivalent of
"so what" and beamed benignly as
most of the Latin American coun
tries did a little ship-grabbing of
their own; the Greeks beat up on
another contingent of Italians; and
the Serbs jockeyed with the Croats
and the Nazis.

None of these incidents is exactly
minor. But considering what's been
happening during the last few days
and what's probably going to hap
pen during the next few days, yes
terday was a welcome breather for
a punch-drunk world.

JJTERR HITLER'S puppet press has
not yet told the German people
about this country's seizure of 28
Italian, 2 German, and 39 Danish
vessels anchored in various Ameri
can harbors. But one of those "au
thorized spokesman" lashed out (to
the foreign newsmen in Berlin) with
the statement that the action was
"an absolute violation of human
rights."

Germany, lie said in effect, is
amazed at the United States' in
terference since "German crews
have full right to damage ships in
any way they s< fit, so long as
the damage not endanger
American harbors." It was as
sumed both Germany and Italy
would demand return of the ships
or full reparations. Denmark
didn't even squeak. Washington
went ahead with blanket orders
for immediate prosecution of offi
cers and crew members who sabo
taged one German and 25 Italian
ships.

Mexico hopped onto the band
wagon yesterday, seizing 12 Italian
and German ships, and Venezuela
picked up three Italian tankers, ap
parently in an effort to keep the
Italians and Germans from clutter
ing up her ports with driftwood.
Earlier one German and three Ital
ian freighters had been scuttled at
Puerto Cabello. Peru had three Ger
man freighters set afire in her baili
wick. Cuba bagged one Italian ship,
and Ecuador observed a nice little
bonfire kindled by the crew of a
Nazi freighter in Guayaquil harbor.

To date the total of Axis shipping
seized, damaged or scuttled in this
hemisphere exceeds 300,000 tons.

jp'NGLISH, Indian and Scottish
Highlander troops whizzed along
the road to Massawa tonight after
taking Asmara, the city from which
the Italians launched the main of
fensive on Ethiopia during 1935-36.
With the British in complete control
of the Gulf of Aden, all means of
retreat are now cut off for the re
maining Italian forces in Eritrea and
Somaliland, and Ethiopia.
As battalions of veteran Nazi
parachute trops lined her borders,
Yugoslavian sources hinted at a
possible mutual assistance pact be
tween the Balkan nation and Tur
key, and an understanding of some
sort with Russia. Basis for this ru
mor was an announcement that
Yugoslav minister to Moscow, Milan
Gabrilovitch, had flown to Ankara,
where he conferred with Turkish
leaders and then rushed back to
Moscow.

J NSIDE Yugoslavia, the new gov
ernment is shuffling key positions
in the provinces, no doubt attempt
ing to remove men in sympathy with
Prince Paul's appeasement group.
Croatian leaders are conferring with
Serb and Slovene leaders, and a
possible "solid front" coalition of the
three major Yugoslavian groups ap
peared dimly on the horizon.
Italy has offered her ambassa
dor's "good offices" and is appar
ently attempting to act as media
tor. Her frantic interest in the
Yugoslavs becomes apparent when
you look at a map. A hostile
Yugoslavia would put the battered
Italian forces in Albania between
a very nasty cross-fire.
Oh yes, it is probably significant
that London has had no bomb at
tacks for 12 consecutive days.
