ing of Stanford Freshmen Carter
Barber and Don Allan. They are
charged with neglect of duty.
Trial of the four additional offi
cers, Thomas Flanagan, Roy Loran,
Edward Vandervorth and Benito
Escobar, who were on duty at the
Southern Station the night of the
beating, will take place next Mon
day night, Police Commission Presi
dent William P. Wobber told The
Daily last night.
DEFINITELY BEATEN'
At the time of the suspension yes
terday, Wobber said the three-man
commission had decided definitely
Barber and Allan "were beaten
while in police custody" early March
2, and ordered a retrial of Officers
John Desmond and Joseph Green,
originally accused of the beating
"without provocation" of the pair.
The Stanford men were arrested
for vagrancy while on a tour of the
city's Skid Row district, later charged
they were beaten while in police
custody, and hearings of the case
ended last week. Mr. Wobber said
last night decision on the case has
been postponed until after the new
hearings next week. "We are deter
mined to find out who did the beat
ing," he said.
FAILED TO REPORT
The four officers suspended yes
terday were charged with being
present at the time of the assaults
and failing to report them to their
superior officer. Officer Flanagan
was in charge of Southern Station
the night of the beatings.
The new suspension followed
closely Monday night's dismissal
of Patrolman John Liston from the
police force by the commission in
another beating case. He was found
guilty of slugging 15-year-old Sam
Long Jr., and pronounced "tem
peramentally unfit to be a police of
ficer." In another case, involving an
officer in an automobile accident, the
commission exonerated Inspector
James McCarthy. Meanwhile, police
are reported to have closed up all
places of vice in the city.

beating, will take place next Mon

Daily last night.
DEFINITELY BEATEN'
At the time of the suspension yes
terday, Wobber said the three-man
commission had decided definitely
Barber and Allan "were beaten
while in police custody" early March
2, and ordered a retrial of Officers
John Desmond and Joseph Green,
originally accused of the beating
"without provocation" of the pair.
The Stanford men were arrested
for vagrancy while on a tour of the
city's Skid Row district, later charged
they were beaten while in police
custody, and hearings of the case
ended last week. Mr. Wobber said
last night decision on the case has
been postponed until after the new
hearings next week. "We are deter
mined to find out who did the beat
ing," he said.
FAILED TO REPORT
The four officers suspended yes
terday were charged with being
present at the time of the assaults
and failing to report them to their
superior officer. Officer Flanagan
was in charge of Southern Station
the night of the beatings.
