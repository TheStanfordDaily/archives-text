# Riots Hit Ford Plant As Striking CIO Men Halt War Production
## Minnesota Governor Requests U.S. Troops After Bricks, Tear Gas Fly; General CIO Holiday Threatened 
### 
DETROIT. April 1 (UP). —The United Automobile Workers (CIO)
called a strike against the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge plant
tonight after paralyzing the huge factory—largest industrial unit in the
world—with an eight-hour sitdown.
"The strike is now on," said Norman Smith, one of the leaders in the

proximately 98,000 workers in three
Detroit, plants of the Ford system.
Workers who had occupied vital
departments of the sprawling 1,100
acre factory through a full working
shift were called out of the plant
to stage a mass meeting at union
organizing headquarters and pre
pare picket lines.
Violence flared in the plant when
workers wearing union buttons
rushed from the "B" building hous
ing final assemblies to the fabricat
ing plant and broke down doors in
an attempt to drive out other em
ployes.
Ford officials called for all avail-

able police protection and Police
Chief Carl A. Brooks of Dearborn
immediately requested Gov. Mur
ray D. Van Waggoner for aid from
the state police. Riot squads went
to Gate 4, main entrance of the
Rouge plant, and attempted to quell
the disorders.
Michael F. Widman Jr., director
of the UAW-CIO organizing drive
against Ford, said the cessation of
operations was the result of "con
tinuous and deliberate" efforts by
the company "to bring a showdown
with the UAW-CIO before the issue
could be decidcd by a peaceful em
ploye election under the National
Labor Relations Board."
Ford has $154,000,000 worth of de
fense contracts, most of which are
for airplane engines to be produced
in a building that is now being com
pleted. The building is in the River
Rouge group. Production on pygmy
trucks for the U. S. Army is a day
shift job in one of the struck de
partments.
The strike started late today as
the night shift began work. It
spread rapidly through the plant's
steel-making unit, and by 10 p.m.
all departments except the motor
building, new tool and die shop and
foundry were affected.

the night shift began work. It
spread rapidly through the plant's
steel-making unit, and by 10 p.m.
all departments except the motor
building, new tool and die shop and
foundry were affected.
DETROIT. April 1 (UP). —The United Automobile Workers (CIO)
called a strike against the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge plant
tonight after paralyzing the huge factory—largest industrial unit in the
world—with an eight-hour sitdown.
"The strike is now on," said Norman Smith, one of the leaders in the

proximately 98,000 workers in three
Detroit, plants of the Ford system.
Workers who had occupied vital
departments of the sprawling 1,100
acre factory through a full working
shift were called out of the plant
to stage a mass meeting at union
organizing headquarters and pre
pare picket lines.
Violence flared in the plant when
workers wearing union buttons
rushed from the "B" building hous
ing final assemblies to the fabricat
ing plant and broke down doors in
an attempt to drive out other em
ployes.
Ford officials called for all avail-

able police protection and Police
Chief Carl A. Brooks of Dearborn
immediately requested Gov. Mur
ray D. Van Waggoner for aid from
the state police. Riot squads went
to Gate 4, main entrance of the
Rouge plant, and attempted to quell
the disorders.
Michael F. Widman Jr., director
of the UAW-CIO organizing drive
against Ford, said the cessation of
operations was the result of "con
tinuous and deliberate" efforts by
the company "to bring a showdown
with the UAW-CIO before the issue
could be decidcd by a peaceful em
ploye election under the National
Labor Relations Board."
Ford has $154,000,000 worth of de
fense contracts, most of which are
for airplane engines to be produced
in a building that is now being com
pleted. The building is in the River
Rouge group. Production on pygmy
trucks for the U. S. Army is a day
shift job in one of the struck de
partments.
The strike started late today as
the night shift began work. It
spread rapidly through the plant's
steel-making unit, and by 10 p.m.
all departments except the motor
building, new tool and die shop and
foundry were affected.
