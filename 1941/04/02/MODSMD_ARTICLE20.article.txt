MILWAUKEE, Wis., April 1 (UP).
—Police who battled 1500 CIO strik
ers in a duel of bricks and tear-gas
at the Allis-Chalmers manufacturing
plant tonight pleaded for reinforce
ments as a general CIO holiday was
threatened in the city's industries.
At least 25 persons were injured,
two seriously, in the hour-long
melee.
After the strikers had been driven
from plant gates, Sheriff Joseph
Shinners of Milwaukee county noti
fied Gov. Julis P. Heil that his force
of 400 men was "unable to cope with
the situation."
He took the grave view, Shinners
told Heil, because he understood a
general CIO membership walkout
was scheduled for Milwaukee to
morrow.
Meyer Adelman, chairman of the
CIO Industrial Council, denied a
holiday had been called but said
that "if the strike continues Wed
nesday" the council would consider
a holiday call for Thursday.
Gov. Heil was reported authori
tatively tonight to have appealed for
5,000 federal troops to safeguard
production at the Allis-Chalmers
manufacturing plant. He advised
President Roosevelt by telegram that
the Allis-Chalmers manufacturing
plant will shut down tomorrow to
avoid "bloodshed and possible loss
of life."
