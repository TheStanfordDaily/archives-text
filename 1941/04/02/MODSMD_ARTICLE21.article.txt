# 'Cissie' Loftus Impresses Capacity Series Audience
## Comedy, Pathos, Drama Combined In Program, 'Sound of Many Voices' 
### JOHN HORRALL 
A little, silver-haired old lady stepped out onto the stage of Memorial
Hall last night and immediately won the hearts and admiration of a
capacity Tuesday Series audience. She was Cecelia Loftus, famed imper
sonator and actress for five decades.
Miss Loftus combined comedy, palhos, and drama in her program

which she called "The; Sound of
Many Voices." She had a repertoire
of 25 numbers, from which she chose
nine, featuring comedy selections.
Her first act was an impression
of a musical comedy duet. Her
change of voice from a high-pitched
soprano to a throaty baritone was
amazing. Her second selection, an
impersonation of Fanny Brice as
Mrs. Cohen at the beach and as
Baby Snooks, was amusing.
Continuing her comedy strain,
Mi Loftus had the audience roar
ing with her burlesque of Beatrice
Lillie singing "There Are Fairies in
Our Garden" and wilh her original
.sketch of four old maids at a lunch
eon. The spinsters discussed doctors,
diets, and operations over four .spe
cial lunches, one a cold boiled tur
nip, another a bunch of carrots, an
other the juice of 11 lemons (with
out sugar), and the hostess' three
chocolate eclairs.
Cissie turned from comedy for a
moment to present an example of
acting as it used to be, as Ada Rehan
used to interpret "Twelfth Night."
1 hen Miss Loftus became Mis. Fiske
and gave a speech from "Contrary
Mary." Mary lost her oars in a
row boat when she stood up to recite
"The Ancient Mariner."
Even though most of the audience
had never seen either actress in per
son, it appreciated her impersona
tions of Ethel Barrymore in a scene
from "The Kingdom of God" and
Sarah Bernhardt. "Cissie" concluded
her program with an impression of
Ruth Draper in "Three Generations
in a Court of Domestic Relations"
and another original sketch, "Lon
don Flower Seller."

Mi Loftus had the audience roar
ing with her burlesque of Beatrice
Lillie singing "There Are Fairies in
Our Garden" and wilh her original
.sketch of four old maids at a lunch
eon. The spinsters discussed doctors,
diets, and operations over four .spe
cial lunches, one a cold boiled tur
nip, another a bunch of carrots, an
other the juice of 11 lemons (with
out sugar), and the hostess' three
chocolate eclairs.
Cissie turned from comedy for a
moment to present an example of
acting as it used to be, as Ada Rehan
used to interpret "Twelfth Night."
1 hen Miss Loftus became Mis. Fiske
and gave a speech from "Contrary
Mary." Mary lost her oars in a
row boat when she stood up to recite
"The Ancient Mariner."
Even though most of the audience
had never seen either actress in per
son, it appreciated her impersona
tions of Ethel Barrymore in a scene
from "The Kingdom of God" and
Sarah Bernhardt. "Cissie" concluded
her program with an impression of
Ruth Draper in "Three Generations
in a Court of Domestic Relations"
and another original sketch, "Lon
don Flower Seller."
A little, silver-haired old lady stepped out onto the stage of Memorial
Hall last night and immediately won the hearts and admiration of a
capacity Tuesday Series audience. She was Cecelia Loftus, famed imper
sonator and actress for five decades.
Miss Loftus combined comedy, palhos, and drama in her program

which she called "The; Sound of
Many Voices." She had a repertoire
of 25 numbers, from which she chose
nine, featuring comedy selections.
Her first act was an impression
of a musical comedy duet. Her
change of voice from a high-pitched
soprano to a throaty baritone was
amazing. Her second selection, an
impersonation of Fanny Brice as
Mrs. Cohen at the beach and as
Baby Snooks, was amusing.
Continuing her comedy strain,
Mi Loftus had the audience roar
ing with her burlesque of Beatrice

Our Garden" and wilh her original
