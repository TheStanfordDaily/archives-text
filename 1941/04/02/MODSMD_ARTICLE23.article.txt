# Engineers Can Now Graduate After 3 Years
## Dean Says Courses Will Now Be Offered At Summer Session 
### 
The Stanford School of Engineer
ing announced last week that it is
now possible to complete the lull
four-year curriculum in three years.
This is to supply the growing de
mand for competent engineers in na
tional defense.
Reversing a policy of 50 years, the
Engineering School will be in ses
sion during Summer Quarter. The
first classes will begin on June 23.
According to Dean Samuel B. 'Mor
ris, many students will be able to
complete the course before reaching
the age of 21. Dean Morris also
pointed out that this is not an ab
breviated course but designed to en
able the high school or junior col
lege student to complete work for
his degree without interruption by
physical or military training. Stu
dents in this school are expected to
be especially useful in mechanized
warfare.
By this plan, students will be able
to enter as freshmen in June, and
graduates of junior colleges will be
able to graduate one or two quar
ters early.
Announcement of the condensed
engineering courses was mailed to
over a thousand education centers
throughout the country as well as to
nearly 3000 Stanford engineering
alumni. This is the first time that
any school of engineering has of
fered a full curriculum throughout
the summer.
