# Mysterious Chest Given to Library
## 
### 
The Library is now the possessor
of a full-fledged mystery. It is a
wrought-iron chest, the gift of Rob
ert C. Hoper of Palo Alto, the origin
and history of which is totally un
known. One non-expert opinion, ac
cording to Dr. Nathan Van Patten,
director of libraries, makes it at
least a century old, perhaps of Span
ish or Italian origin.
This "pirate" box is about a foot
and a half square, heavily banded,
and studded with rivets. The lock
ing mechanism is made up of a
series of involved springs and lev
ers, There are two concealed key
holes that can be found only by
pressing a pair of concealed springs,
and it requires two elaborate keys
which must be turned simultaneous
ly.
