# Cox Covers the Campus Keeps University Posted

### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Have you ever wondered who
puts up all those announcements
about the Tuesday Evening Lecture
Series all over the campus? Or who
puts up the calendar of the Univer
sity happenings week after week on
all the bulletin boards from the
B.A.C. to the Geology Building?
And have you wondered about the
smiling, sprucely-dressed gentle
man whom you are liable to run
into any place on the Quad? The
three all tie in together. The gen
tleman with the carefully trimmed
mustache is Mr- Ross Cox, the inter
departmental mail carrier for the
University.
ACTS AS CLEARING HOUSE
It is his job, among other things,
to get all of the calendars and the
announcements up on all the bill
boards around the Quad. He car
ries messages, reports, and notices
from each department to the other,
acting as a sort of clearing house.
Three times a day, he thoroughly
covers the campus from one building
to another. In this way one de
partment of Stanford is sure to get
business pertaining to another de
partment over there in short order.
Mr. Cox in his trim gray suit and
gray hat has spent eight years at
Stanford. Before taking over his
present job, he drove the water
wagon, manipulated tractors around
and worked in the storeroom here.
GRADUATE OF NOTRE DAME
He is a Chicagoan by birth and
is a graduate of Notre Dame Uni
versity. After his college career he
followed the real estate business for
a while.
For many years he was secretary

to Richard Mansfield, the famed
Shakespearean' Mr. Cox has never
had any stage ambitions although he
had to take over once on the stage.
Mr. Cox thinks that anybody who
doesn't plan to take the Shakespeare
courses offered at Stanford is losing
out on a lot.
STARTS AT 7:15
Since his first trip around the Uni
versity picking up mail begins at
7:15 and his last one gets him back
about 5 o'clock, he has little time for
relaxation. Over the week-end he
definitely does not play golf; in
stead he prefers to work in his
garden.
Mr. Cox believes that the students
and the faculty at Stanford are
about the best in the country. "They
certainly have always been grand to
me," he says.
