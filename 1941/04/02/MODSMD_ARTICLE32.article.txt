# Shaughnessy Asks Every Man Interested in Grid Sport to Join 'T' Party
## 
### 
The Stanford football coaching siitlT, headed by Clark Shaughnessy,
today extended an invitation to every man in the University not already
enrolled in an activity for the quarter to report to the meeting in Room
214 of the History Corner. With a coaching staff large enough to give
plenty of individual attention to :500 men, it is planned to run through the

entire spring schedule with no eut<
in the squad.
"I have no doubt that there are
many good prospective football
players in the University who have
never played (he game and who
have just put off giving it a try. It
is this group that we wish to reach,"
said Shaughnessy yesterday. "We'd
like to have all of these men come
out, and particularly we should like
to have them attend the meeting to
day even though they do not plan to
attend the field drills."
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION
The point is being stressed that
everyone is to have individual at
tention during the spring drills,
which have heretofore been only for
men planning to play on the varsity
in the following season. It is hoped j
that enough men will turn out to
form different squads according to
the weigh) of the players. This plan
has been followed with a deal of
success in several of the larger east
ern colleges and universities. There
will be enough uniforms to handle
the large squad expected to turn
out.
''In spring practice we lay the
foundation for the fall and have the
time to give everyone plenty of in
dividual attentioif," Shaughnessy de
clared. "Those men who are able to
report this spring will have a big
advantage over those who do not j
take part in these 30 sessions."
EXPERIENCE UNNECESSARY
In stressing the fact that previous
experience is not necessary in order
to develop a good college football
player, it can be pointed out that
Shaughnessy himself never even
saw a football game until after he
entered college, although he later
made the All-American team as a
fullback. Hugh Gallarneau, right
half and leading ground-gainer on
last year's Rose Bowl team, never
played football until he entered
Stanford.
"We won't have the opportunity to
Issue a personal invitation to every i
man, but we do want to have the j
largest turnout in the history of the
University," Shaughnessy declared, i
Several new changes in positions j
are being discussed by the coaching
Staff. These include the shifting of j
Roger Laverty, reserve end last ,
year, to fullback. Also under discus
sion is the shifting of Bob Koch and
Bob Mitchell, star halves on the ;
1940 undefeated frosh team, to the
fullback position. With the return of
Vic Lindskog, Doug Stahle and
Colin McClintock to the center posi
tion. there is a possibility that Loren !
LaPrade, ace center for Harry Ship
key's aggregation last year, may be
changed in order to bolster up one
of the guard or tackle positions.
SIX LINEMEN RETURN
Returning for another season will
be six regulars from the 1940 for
ward wall—right end Freddy Meyer, I
right tackle Bruno Banducci, right [
guard Dick Palmer, center Vic
Lindskog, left guard Chuck Taylor, |
and left tackle Ed Stamm. Other j
lettermen who will be available for i
line duty include: Doug Stahle and
Colin McClintock, centers; Ken Ro
besky and Jack Francis, guards; Ed
McCain, Claude Purkitt and Jack
Warnecke, tackles; Bob Ditlevsen
and Arnie Meiners, ends.
"Remember, this afternoon at 4:3(1 '
o'clock in Room 214. You'll be most !
welcome, even if you never wore a
uniform or had your hands on a
football," Shaughnessy reiterated.

In stressing the fact that previous
experience is not necessary in order
to develop a good college football
player, it can be pointed out that
Shaughnessy himself never even
saw a football game until after he
entered college, although he later
made the All-American team as a
fullback. Hugh Gallarneau, right
half and leading ground-gainer on
last year's Rose Bowl team, never
played football until he entered
Stanford.
"We won't have the opportunity to
Issue a personal invitation to every i
man, but we do want to have the j
largest turnout in the history of the
University," Shaughnessy declared, i
Several new changes in positions j
are being discussed by the coaching
Staff. These include the shifting of j
Roger Laverty, reserve end last ,
year, to fullback. Also under discus
sion is the shifting of Bob Koch and
Bob Mitchell, star halves on the ;
1940 undefeated frosh team, to the
fullback position. With the return of
Vic Lindskog, Doug Stahle and
Colin McClintock to the center posi
tion. there is a possibility that Loren !
LaPrade, ace center for Harry Ship
key's aggregation last year, may be
changed in order to bolster up one
of the guard or tackle positions.
SIX LINEMEN RETURN
Returning for another season will
be six regulars from the 1940 for
ward wall—right end Freddy Meyer, I
right tackle Bruno Banducci, right [
guard Dick Palmer, center Vic
Lindskog, left guard Chuck Taylor, |
and left tackle Ed Stamm. Other j
lettermen who will be available for i
line duty include: Doug Stahle and
Colin McClintock, centers; Ken Ro
besky and Jack Francis, guards; Ed
McCain, Claude Purkitt and Jack
Warnecke, tackles; Bob Ditlevsen
and Arnie Meiners, ends.
"Remember, this afternoon at 4:3(1 '
o'clock in Room 214. You'll be most !
welcome, even if you never wore a
uniform or had your hands on a
football," Shaughnessy reiterated.
The Stanford football coaching siitlT, headed by Clark Shaughnessy,
today extended an invitation to every man in the University not already
enrolled in an activity for the quarter to report to the meeting in Room
214 of the History Corner. With a coaching staff large enough to give
plenty of individual attention to :500 men, it is planned to run through the

entire spring schedule with no eut<
in the squad.
"I have no doubt that there are
many good prospective football
players in the University who have
never played (he game and who
have just put off giving it a try. It
is this group that we wish to reach,"
said Shaughnessy yesterday. "We'd
like to have all of these men come
out, and particularly we should like
to have them attend the meeting to
day even though they do not plan to
attend the field drills."
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION
The point is being stressed that
everyone is to have individual at
tention during the spring drills,
which have heretofore been only for
men planning to play on the varsity
in the following season. It is hoped j
that enough men will turn out to
form different squads according to
the weigh) of the players. This plan
has been followed with a deal of
success in several of the larger east
ern colleges and universities. There
will be enough uniforms to handle
the large squad expected to turn
out.
''In spring practice we lay the
foundation for the fall and have the
time to give everyone plenty of in
dividual attentioif," Shaughnessy de
clared. "Those men who are able to
report this spring will have a big
advantage over those who do not j
take part in these 30 sessions."

"Remember, this afternoon at 4:3(1 '
o'clock in Room 214. You'll be most !
welcome, even if you never wore a
uniform or had your hands on a
football," Shaughnessy reiterated.
The Stanford football coaching siitlT, headed by Clark Shaughnessy,
today extended an invitation to every man in the University not already
enrolled in an activity for the quarter to report to the meeting in Room
214 of the History Corner. With a coaching staff large enough to give
plenty of individual attention to :500 men, it is planned to run through the

entire spring schedule with no eut<
in the squad.
"I have no doubt that there are
many good prospective football
players in the University who have
never played (he game and who
have just put off giving it a try. It
is this group that we wish to reach,"
said Shaughnessy yesterday. "We'd
like to have all of these men come
out, and particularly we should like
to have them attend the meeting to
day even though they do not plan to
attend the field drills."
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION
The point is being stressed that
everyone is to have individual at
tention during the spring drills,
which have heretofore been only for
men planning to play on the varsity
in the following season. It is hoped j
that enough men will turn out to
form different squads according to
the weigh) of the players. This plan
has been followed with a deal of
success in several of the larger east
ern colleges and universities. There
will be enough uniforms to handle
the large squad expected to turn
out.
''In spring practice we lay the
foundation for the fall and have the
time to give everyone plenty of in
dividual attentioif," Shaughnessy de
clared. "Those men who are able to
report this spring will have a big
advantage over those who do not j
take part in these 30 sessions."
EXPERIENCE UNNECESSARY
In stressing the fact that previous
experience is not necessary in order
to develop a good college football
player, it can be pointed out that
Shaughnessy himself never even
saw a football game until after he
entered college, although he later
made the All-American team as a
fullback. Hugh Gallarneau, right
half and leading ground-gainer on
last year's Rose Bowl team, never
played football until he entered
Stanford.
"We won't have the opportunity to
Issue a personal invitation to every i
man, but we do want to have the j
largest turnout in the history of the
University," Shaughnessy declared, i
Several new changes in positions j
are being discussed by the coaching
Staff. These include the shifting of j
Roger Laverty, reserve end last ,
year, to fullback. Also under discus
sion is the shifting of Bob Koch and
Bob Mitchell, star halves on the ;
1940 undefeated frosh team, to the
fullback position. With the return of
Vic Lindskog, Doug Stahle and
Colin McClintock to the center posi
tion. there is a possibility that Loren !
LaPrade, ace center for Harry Ship
key's aggregation last year, may be
changed in order to bolster up one
of the guard or tackle positions.
SIX LINEMEN RETURN

be six regulars from the 1940 for
ward wall—right end Freddy Meyer, I
right tackle Bruno Banducci, right [
guard Dick Palmer, center Vic

o'clock in Room 214. You'll be most !
welcome, even if you never wore a
uniform or had your hands on a
football," Shaughnessy reiterated.
