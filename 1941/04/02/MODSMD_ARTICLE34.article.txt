# Mentor Drills Swimming Aces For Bruin Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity mermen worked
out during yesterday's driving rain
in preparation for the conference
tilt with U.C.L.A- Friday. Because
of the ten-day lay-off, Coach Nort
Thornton has found it necessary to
bring some cf the hoys down to the
pods twice a day.
Judging by all portents, the Fri
day battle will bo one of the best
of this season. Both teams are un
defeated and Stanford has never lost
to the Uclans in this water classic.
U.C.L.A. is bent on revenging last
year's defeat when they were edged
out by Stanford, 38-37.
USES BUTTERFLY STROKE
In the 200-yard breaststroke, Roy
Vitousek, co-captain and conference
champion, should have little diffi
culty in defeating the conference's
number two man, Dick Reed of
U.CL.A. Using the butterfly stroke,
Vitousek has several times ap
proached the world record.
Stanford's sophomore ace, Doc
Colyear, should streak through the
water for an easy victory in the 440-
yard freestyle. Doc turned in a
5:09 for the quarter in practice a
week ago and is really developing
into a definite threat for the confer
ence title. A1 FroSt, Indian "come
through" boy, will match strokes
with the Bruins' Holmes for second
place.
Admission to the meet Friday af
ternoon will be free to students with
their student body cards. Persons
not connected with the University
or U.C.L.A. will not be admitted.
