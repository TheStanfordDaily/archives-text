# Rain Completes Pitch's Misery
## 
### 
Another week of rain is adding to
the miseries of Pitch Johnson, in his
first year at the helm of Stanford's
track team.
When Pitch came out here from
Drake, he inherited the remnants of
a great team, riddled by graduation,
and he's had no end of worry trying
to piece together a squad with some
balance and power. In addition to
rain, which hasn't stopped since
Pitch came to the Farm, the Indians'
new mentor has seen his captain and
his high jumper both injured, and
several other potential stars fore
saking track for one reason and an-
QjJier-
Neithpr Ernie Clark nor Jim Lin
coln have been able to get into shape
because of injuries. Ken Battaglia
went out for rugby and Bob Smith
has just signed up for soccer. Jack
Moore left school and A! Soldate de
cided to concentrate on scholastic
work.
Then the much-needed meet with
Fresno State was cancelled and the
Indians lost valuable practice under
fire. Now Pitch is working on the
coming San Jose State meet, sched
uled for this Saturday—if it doesn't
rain.
