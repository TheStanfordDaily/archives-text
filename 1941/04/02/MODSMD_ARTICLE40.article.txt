# Netmen Leave For Southland
## 
### 
One of the finest tennis teams in
Stanford's history will leave tonight ;
for the Southland, where they will
open their t!MI conference campaign
with matches against U.C.L.A. on !
i Friday and the University of South- j
I ern California on Saturday.
The Indians, represented by a
veteran squad, should be top-heavy
favorites over the Bruins and have a
good chance of dumping the power
ful Trojan team. Leading the In
dians will be Larry Dee, last year's
! sophomore number one man. Dee
has been out of the hospital only a
short time and has been having
scholastic difficulties but he should
be ready for the week-end matches.
Following Dee will be Jimmy
Wade, veteran Bob Low, the sopho
more trio of Tom Kruger, Chuck
Hutchison and Emery Neale, and
transfer Jack Gurley. Stan Owen
and A1 Rose round out the traveling
squad.
The Trojan match on Saturday
should be crucial. U.S.C., always one
of the strongest collegiate teams in
the country, has come up with an
other power team. Heading the
Trojans will be Ted Oltwine, and
such stars as George Toley, Bill
Reedy and Charles Mattman from
Florida. Playing number five and
six for the Trojans will be Ronald
Lubin and Jack Carlock, respec
tively.
The rainy weather has hampered
the play of the Stanford netmen,
but a net has been strung up in
the Pavilion where workouts have
been held for the past few days.
While the varsity men are away,
the frosh will tangle with the Mar
tinez Tennis Club on Saturday af
ternoon on the varsity courts.
