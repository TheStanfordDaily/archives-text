Talk about pressure. Talk about evasion of
the issues. Talk about mud-slinging and flag
waving and completely ignoring the hard cold
facts—and you've got this country's leaders
debating the momentous question of war ver
sus peace.
"War versus peace?" A few years ago
there was no question-mark for America.
"Peace" was the only American way of life.
There are certain basic issues today on
which the decision between war and peace
should depend. Yet these basic issues have
rarely been discussed.
Instead we hear isolationist and interven
tionist quibble over terms like "American
ism"; see them wave the same flag to empha
size opposing doctrines; see them stubbornly
refuse to come to swords' points over funda
mental issues.
1 cannot but believe that America wants
peace. I also sincerely believe that this nation
will fundamentally retain that desire even
should it be drawn into the European conflict.
But I cannot disregard the fear that should that
last step be taken it will be because one group
waved the flag higher or threw more mud—
and not because a sober interpretation of facts
willed it so.
