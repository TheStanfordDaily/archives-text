# War on Peace
## 
### 
WITH each successive year, that word peace
means more and more. Vivid in the mem
ories of the Farm should be the near-cataclysm a
few weeks ago when Hitler marched into Cze
choslovakia. But it probably isn't. Probably
peace is still as vague a notion as ever.
Christopher Morley had the right idea . . .
when he said that there would be peace as soon
as the people wanted it. That puts it about as
simply and as realistically as possible—"peace
if you want it." Consequently, all the hubbub
involved in upholding collective security, iso
lationism, or anything else is just so much waste
motion.
But that concept is too idealistic for this com
promising age. Rather would political and eco
nomic theorists consider it to be the fact that
the world must have one of the mass of -isms
before it gets peace.
