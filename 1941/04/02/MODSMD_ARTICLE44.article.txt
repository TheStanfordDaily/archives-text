# Requiem in Red

AMERICA will observe Armistice Day this
morning, using the memory of our war
dead as a spring board for oratorical acrobatics
and emotional high dives.
Stanford will lay a wreath on an altar and
attempt to give one minute's thought to the
question of war peace. Most of America will
go on an emotional binge, using the memory of
the war dead as an excuse. Somehow, I don't
think the war dead would like it. â€”Bull Sessioner
John Cobbs, November, 1938
