IN the midst of the greatest rearmament pro
gram the world has ever staged, a small
group of Stanford men and women is in the
process of planning Stanford's Peace Day. . . .
Peace, recognized as a desirable state, to be
realized, will take more than planning a "Peace
Day"—it will take far more than planning 100
more batleships or the administration of a new
and enlarged army.
It will take more courage, more foresight to
win peace than to fight wars.
The Peace Day Committee is making a step
in the right direction. Under the circumstances,
however, the most it can do is call attention to
peace, hope that the campus will be interested
for the time being.
But peace, and the planning of that peace,
must soon be put on a full-time basis.—Editor
