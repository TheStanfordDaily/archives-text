						Real Armistice

### 
TOMORROW is Armistice Day.
Tomorrow Americans may remember that
they haven't declared war yet, they aren't
trapped yet. They will think of the last war, and
what this country lost by it . . . and they can
laugh at what they gained.
A whole country will be thinking of this,
feeling this. And if that country does not want
another war . . . she will give herself her big
gest chance to remain at peace.
There will be no public announcement, no
declaration that America has decided not to go
to war. It simply will be something that the

American people believe. — Associate Editor
