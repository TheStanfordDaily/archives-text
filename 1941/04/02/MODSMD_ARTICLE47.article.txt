AMERICANS must guard more jealously than
ever their determination to stay out of war.
That resolution must not be allowed to weaken
merely because fighting temporarily is at a halt.
Higher and higher the pyramid of public opin
ion for peace must be built. And more than any
other single group, the college students of
America bear the responsibility for this task.
They are the educated people who can face
the problem intelligently and sanely. They are
the young people who will be killed if the
United States goes to war.
For the protection of their country, for the pro
tection of themselves, Stanford students must
keep working for peace.â€”Editor Larry Living
