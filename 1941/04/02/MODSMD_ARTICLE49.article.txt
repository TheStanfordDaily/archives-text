# What Armistice?
## 
### 
LET America worship peace, as a shrine to
ward which every government, every civili
zation, will strive. Through its tenets every
member of this nation will gain; and if its prin
ciples fail, every man or woman will lose. And
with each personal loss —of life or property or
aspiration—will come a loss to the world at
large, to civilization in general.
America stands alone in a confused, insecure
universe.
When, today, "taps" sounds in Memorial
Church after those few seconds of silence, let
us pray that it wili not sound for civilzation as
a whole. Let us hope that a chance still exists
for a fair way of life and a democratic means
of existence. —Editor Dwight Hutchinson, No
vember, 1940
