### JERRY MAYER 
OUR LIFE AS AN AUTHOR
VkrAE WERE rudely shocked the other day. Funda
mentally, we're still a little child at heart. When
we were a wee tot, we thought it would be fine to
be a railroad engineer. A little later we were con
vinced that to be a milkman would be the best thing
in the world, next to a date with the little girl next
door who forsook our skooter for the brand-new four
wheel wagon job belonging to the little thug who
lived down the block.
There were other worthy ambitions. For instance,
after we learned to play solitaire we wanted to be a
card sharp. After we saw our first motion picture,
we wanted to be an actor. The furthest we got in the
latter ambition was in a junior high school play when
we walked back and forth behind a big window with
a different hat on each time. In the program we were
credited with being a "brisk Christmas Day crowd."
* * * *
VS7HEN we were in the hospital recently we had
plenty of time. So we read Jan Valtin's "Out of
the Night." We didn't really want to read it, but we
were afraid that the Book-of-the-Month Club would
level an accusing finger at us and mumble, "Uncul
tured, uncultured."
Reading day and night it took us seven days to
read the book' We read very rapidly but, of course,
that good-looking nurse came on duty at 3 o'clock
and we always spent eight hours discussing Shake
speare, philosophy, and life in general. For all the
good we did in that league, we had the time to write a
sequel to Valtin's book.
But, to get back to the story, after reading "Out of
the Night" we wanted to be a famous author, an ad
venturer, a rough-tough laddie who lived life to the
hilt, as they say, loving, laughing, and spreading the
doctrine. The fact that we were several pounds under
weight and had not had a fight since the day in gram
mar school when the little Italian kid who was six
inches shorter sent us running home to our mother's
loving arms, did not deter the ambition.
Naturally, at the end of our book we would re
nounce the doctrine and escape to some foreign coun
try to start life anew. We thought Valtin was just
marvelous. Not only did he get a lot done in the way
of political activity, but on practically every page he
had enough time for an unpolitical affair or two. Yes,
sir, there was no alternative but that we should be a
vital author.
■H * * *
OUT we were rudely shocked (refer back to first
paragraph) by an interview with Valtin in The
New Yorker magazine. This interview described My
Hero as being "gap-toothed." We almost cried. Gap
toothed, indeed. Tsch, tsch. Our Man on a Pedestal
with a gap between his teeth. No wonder the Com
munists got rid of him. Imagine a guy with gap
teeth spreading the doctrine (and making love on
Party time). No self-respecting movement could tol
erate such a thing. Why, there is no doubt in our
mind but what his Gestapo tortures were vastly over
exaggerated. Probably some Nazi orthodontists trying
to fix his teeth.
We ran to the nearest mirror, which wasn't a long
run considering the fact we always carry one in our
wallet. We smiled sweetly. And our teeth were per
fect! Oh, happy day. Not very much else that re
flected from the mirror was perfect (or even accept
able) but our teeth were the finest fangs that Dr.
Lyons could produce.
So we haven't given up our hope of some day be
ing an author. It appears that minus that attractive,
too too divine gap we might be handicapped to some
extent, but what's a love affair among friends? (We
really don't know, we've never had one.)
So we'll restrict ourselves to parlor-room litera
ture until the day when we can pry a cozy gap in our
teeth.
But life is definitely not as sweet as it could be.
In fact, we feel like a raspberry seed in the teeth of
fate. Another of our ambitions has been quashed.
There's only one thing to do—borrow someone's
draft card and hit down the highway to Belt's. At
least, Claude will understand us.

marvelous. Not only did he get a lot done in the way
of political activity, but on practically every page he

■H * * *
OUT we were rudely shocked (refer back to first
paragraph) by an interview with Valtin in The
New Yorker magazine. This interview described My
Hero as being "gap-toothed." We almost cried. Gap
toothed, indeed. Tsch, tsch. Our Man on a Pedestal
with a gap between his teeth. No wonder the Com
munists got rid of him. Imagine a guy with gap
teeth spreading the doctrine (and making love on
Party time). No self-respecting movement could tol
erate such a thing. Why, there is no doubt in our
mind but what his Gestapo tortures were vastly over
exaggerated. Probably some Nazi orthodontists trying
to fix his teeth.
We ran to the nearest mirror, which wasn't a long
run considering the fact we always carry one in our
wallet. We smiled sweetly. And our teeth were per
fect! Oh, happy day. Not very much else that re
flected from the mirror was perfect (or even accept
able) but our teeth were the finest fangs that Dr.
Lyons could produce.
So we haven't given up our hope of some day be
ing an author. It appears that minus that attractive,
too too divine gap we might be handicapped to some
extent, but what's a love affair among friends? (We
really don't know, we've never had one.)
So we'll restrict ourselves to parlor-room litera
ture until the day when we can pry a cozy gap in our
teeth.
But life is definitely not as sweet as it could be.
In fact, we feel like a raspberry seed in the teeth of
fate. Another of our ambitions has been quashed.
There's only one thing to do—borrow someone's
draft card and hit down the highway to Belt's. At
least, Claude will understand us.
OUR LIFE AS AN AUTHOR
VkrAE WERE rudely shocked the other day. Funda
mentally, we're still a little child at heart. When
we were a wee tot, we thought it would be fine to
be a railroad engineer. A little later we were con
vinced that to be a milkman would be the best thing
in the world, next to a date with the little girl next
door who forsook our skooter for the brand-new four
wheel wagon job belonging to the little thug who
lived down the block.
There were other worthy ambitions. For instance,
after we learned to play solitaire we wanted to be a
card sharp. After we saw our first motion picture,
we wanted to be an actor. The furthest we got in the
latter ambition was in a junior high school play when
we walked back and forth behind a big window with
a different hat on each time. In the program we were
credited with being a "brisk Christmas Day crowd."
* * * *
VS7HEN we were in the hospital recently we had
plenty of time. So we read Jan Valtin's "Out of
the Night." We didn't really want to read it, but we
were afraid that the Book-of-the-Month Club would
level an accusing finger at us and mumble, "Uncul
tured, uncultured."
Reading day and night it took us seven days to
read the book' We read very rapidly but, of course,
that good-looking nurse came on duty at 3 o'clock
and we always spent eight hours discussing Shake
speare, philosophy, and life in general. For all the
good we did in that league, we had the time to write a
sequel to Valtin's book.
But, to get back to the story, after reading "Out of
the Night" we wanted to be a famous author, an ad
venturer, a rough-tough laddie who lived life to the
hilt, as they say, loving, laughing, and spreading the
doctrine. The fact that we were several pounds under
weight and had not had a fight since the day in gram
mar school when the little Italian kid who was six
inches shorter sent us running home to our mother's
loving arms, did not deter the ambition.
Naturally, at the end of our book we would re
nounce the doctrine and escape to some foreign coun
try to start life anew. We thought Valtin was just
marvelous. Not only did he get a lot done in the way
of political activity, but on practically every page he
had enough time for an unpolitical affair or two. Yes,

vinced that to be a milkman would be the best thing
in the world, next to a date with the little girl next
door who forsook our skooter for the brand-new four
wheel wagon job belonging to the little thug who
lived down the block.
There were other worthy ambitions. For instance,
after we learned to play solitaire we wanted to be a
card sharp. After we saw our first motion picture,
we wanted to be an actor. The furthest we got in the
latter ambition was in a junior high school play when
we walked back and forth behind a big window with
a different hat on each time. In the program we were
credited with being a "brisk Christmas Day crowd."
* * * *
VS7HEN we were in the hospital recently we had
plenty of time. So we read Jan Valtin's "Out of
the Night." We didn't really want to read it, but we
were afraid that the Book-of-the-Month Club would
level an accusing finger at us and mumble, "Uncul
tured, uncultured."
Reading day and night it took us seven days to
read the book' We read very rapidly but, of course,
that good-looking nurse came on duty at 3 o'clock
and we always spent eight hours discussing Shake
speare, philosophy, and life in general. For all the
good we did in that league, we had the time to write a
sequel to Valtin's book.
But, to get back to the story, after reading "Out of
the Night" we wanted to be a famous author, an ad
venturer, a rough-tough laddie who lived life to the
hilt, as they say, loving, laughing, and spreading the
doctrine. The fact that we were several pounds under
weight and had not had a fight since the day in gram
mar school when the little Italian kid who was six
inches shorter sent us running home to our mother's
loving arms, did not deter the ambition.
Naturally, at the end of our book we would re
nounce the doctrine and escape to some foreign coun
try to start life anew. We thought Valtin was just
marvelous. Not only did he get a lot done in the way
of political activity, but on practically every page he
had enough time for an unpolitical affair or two. Yes,
sir, there was no alternative but that we should be a
vital author.
■H * * *
OUT we were rudely shocked (refer back to first
paragraph) by an interview with Valtin in The
New Yorker magazine. This interview described My
Hero as being "gap-toothed." We almost cried. Gap
toothed, indeed. Tsch, tsch. Our Man on a Pedestal
with a gap between his teeth. No wonder the Com
munists got rid of him. Imagine a guy with gap
teeth spreading the doctrine (and making love on
Party time). No self-respecting movement could tol
erate such a thing. Why, there is no doubt in our
mind but what his Gestapo tortures were vastly over
exaggerated. Probably some Nazi orthodontists trying
to fix his teeth.
We ran to the nearest mirror, which wasn't a long
run considering the fact we always carry one in our
wallet. We smiled sweetly. And our teeth were per
fect! Oh, happy day. Not very much else that re
flected from the mirror was perfect (or even accept
able) but our teeth were the finest fangs that Dr.
Lyons could produce.
So we haven't given up our hope of some day be
ing an author. It appears that minus that attractive,
too too divine gap we might be handicapped to some
extent, but what's a love affair among friends? (We
really don't know, we've never had one.)
So we'll restrict ourselves to parlor-room litera
ture until the day when we can pry a cozy gap in our
teeth.
But life is definitely not as sweet as it could be.
In fact, we feel like a raspberry seed in the teeth of
fate. Another of our ambitions has been quashed.
There's only one thing to do—borrow someone's
draft card and hit down the highway to Belt's. At
least, Claude will understand us.
OUR LIFE AS AN AUTHOR

mentally, we're still a little child at heart. When
