# McCullers Makes Psych Study in Newest Novel
## 
### 
"REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE," by Carson McCullers, on sale
at the Ramona Bookshop.
Carson McCullers is the author of the best seller of last year, "The
Heart Is a Lonely Hunter." At that time she was supposed to be one of
the coming young writers. In this book she certainly lets her reputation

down *
"Reflections in a Golden Eye" is
supposed to come from some inner
compulsion which is unplanned and
is as inevitable as life itself. The
inner compulsion must have been
pretty ghastly if the four oddities
about whom the book centers is the
result.
ARMY POST LOCALE
The locale of the story is an army
post and there are a captain and his
wife, a major and his wife, and a
private of no particular class. Among
other things there is an off-the-rec
ord love affair between the wife of
the captain and the major, which
results in the death of the major's
wife.
There is a Filipino up to no good
throughout the book and the reader
is never clear as to the status of the
private who, nevertheless, seems to
be the occasion for the action of the
story.
EERIE ATMOSPHERE
The eerie atmosphere of mad
horses galloping wildly and people
who watch others through their
windows is scattered through this
little psychological epic. You feel as
though you should be eating worms
or something as you are reading this.
Carson McCullers is evidently at
tempting to say something through
this weird novel which has as abrupt
a beginning as an ending. But what
she wants to say remains a question,
for the book ends with the private
lying in a bloody mess at the cap
tain's feet.
It's all too uncanny to be even
incredible. Psychologically, it's a
Roman holiday.—Wuenschel
The Chinese name for San Fran
cisco is "Gold Mountain."

is never clear as to the status of the
private who, nevertheless, seems to

EERIE ATMOSPHERE
The eerie atmosphere of mad
horses galloping wildly and people
who watch others through their
windows is scattered through this
little psychological epic. You feel as
though you should be eating worms
or something as you are reading this.
Carson McCullers is evidently at
tempting to say something through
this weird novel which has as abrupt
a beginning as an ending. But what
she wants to say remains a question,
for the book ends with the private
lying in a bloody mess at the cap
tain's feet.
It's all too uncanny to be even
incredible. Psychologically, it's a
Roman holiday.—Wuenschel

"REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE," by Carson McCullers, on sale
at the Ramona Bookshop.
Carson McCullers is the author of the best seller of last year, "The
Heart Is a Lonely Hunter." At that time she was supposed to be one of
the coming young writers. In this book she certainly lets her reputation

down *
"Reflections in a Golden Eye" is
supposed to come from some inner
compulsion which is unplanned and
is as inevitable as life itself. The
inner compulsion must have been
pretty ghastly if the four oddities
about whom the book centers is the
result.
ARMY POST LOCALE
The locale of the story is an army
post and there are a captain and his
wife, a major and his wife, and a
private of no particular class. Among
other things there is an off-the-rec
ord love affair between the wife of
the captain and the major, which
results in the death of the major's
wife.
There is a Filipino up to no good
throughout the book and the reader
is never clear as to the status of the
private who, nevertheless, seems to
be the occasion for the action of the
story.
