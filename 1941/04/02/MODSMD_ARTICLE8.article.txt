# Moses, Newell Report Debate Tour Success
## 
### 
(Editor's No(e: This is the first
of a series of letters from Linn
Moses and Bob Newell, representing
Stanford on a debating tour which
includes 21 scheduled matches at 17
colleges and universities throughout
the country.)
We are now in Seattle.
The trip to date has called for
one debate in Portland and one
here. Yesterday our opponents were
Angelo Varesio and William Don
nelly of the University of Portland.
Perhaps the most touching phase
of this hospitality was voluntary ap
pearange of 60 students —one-third
of those resident—and that at the
end of finals week.
'UNION NOW'
The subject was "Resolved: That
-the nations of the Western Hemi
sphere should form a permanent
union." Stanford took the negative.
No decision.
Today—after getting off the train
in the middle of the night—we ar
rived at the home of the University
of Washington. The audience gath
ered in Garfield High School, the
university being in vacation. The
debate was of the problem solving
type. The question for discussion
was "What should we do about the
problem of propaganda?"
TWO SOLUTIONS
It was analyzed by the first Wash
ingotn speaker, following which I
presented a solution to the problem;
then a second solution was offered
by the other Washington speaker.
Newell gave the concluding
speech—an evaluation of both argu
ments, in which he concluded that a
short run answer no matter what it
might be would certainly be in er
ror, and that the final answer to the
question must be found in education
—primarily the high school educa
tion.
Tomorrow we debate the Univer
sity of Montana at Missoula. Stan
ford will take the affirmative of the
question it. opposed at Portland.
Evaluation of success so far—
good.

rived at the home of the University
of Washington. The audience gath
ered in Garfield High School, the
university being in vacation. The
debate was of the problem solving
type. The question for discussion
was "What should we do about the
problem of propaganda?"
TWO SOLUTIONS
It was analyzed by the first Wash
ingotn speaker, following which I
presented a solution to the problem;
then a second solution was offered
by the other Washington speaker.
Newell gave the concluding
speech—an evaluation of both argu
ments, in which he concluded that a
short run answer no matter what it
might be would certainly be in er
ror, and that the final answer to the
question must be found in education
—primarily the high school educa
tion.
Tomorrow we debate the Univer
sity of Montana at Missoula. Stan
ford will take the affirmative of the
question it. opposed at Portland.
Evaluation of success so far—
good.
