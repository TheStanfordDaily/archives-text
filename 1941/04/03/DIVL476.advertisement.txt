Oh I wish I were poetic
I "My" attempts are so pathetic,
| But, though hesitant, I'm
bound to do my best.
I You have asked for my reaction
And you have a real attraction
So I cannot disregard
your first request.
Oh the things you've said have pleased
me
And though you have often teased me
It's because of you my world
is bright and cheery.
You have given me, I own,
A thing to mc, before, unknown
Without you now my days
would be quite dreary.
But such gladness you have brought
me
From the first time that you sought
me
That although I've often thought
that I would perish
For some greater satisfaction,
! You've increased ycur first attraction
{ And everything you've said
I'll always cherish.
All my past hopes have seemed futile
I And deceit, I found, was brutal)
But you've intrigued me and
I can't deny your charm;
Though with you I just can't cope,
Every day brings me new hope
Now—coud a little bit of candor
do us harm?!
| You today asked me to summon,
| And to bid you now to come on
I To my side, and at long last
! drop your mask.
j My excitement now runs rife—
Come —bring my happiness to life.
Oh please do not refuse this only
I thing I ask.
