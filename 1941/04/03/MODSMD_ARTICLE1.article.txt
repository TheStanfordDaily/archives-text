YESTERDAY Yugoslavia again
became a united nation. That is
to say, the various warring groups
in the little country settled their dif
ferences and combined to face the
world with a "common front against
invasion," although promising to
pursue a policy of peace.
Considering the terrific pres
sure (from both Britain and the
Axis) to which the Yugoslavs are
being subjected, and the hetero
geneous character of the people
themselves, the gvt-togcther is
quite an achievement.
One of those arbitrary compromise
countries created after World War I,
the Balkan kingdom of Serbs,
Croats, and Slovenes combines the
pre-war kingdoms of Serbia and
Montenegro, and the provinces of
Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Croatia-
Slavonia, as well as parts of five
other provinces—all of which were
formerly part of Austria-Hungary.
* * *
The Croats have been at logger
heads with the predominant Serb
group ever since General Dusan
Simovitch's anti-Axis coup d'etat of
a week ago. In the first place the
powerful Croatian element has
shown strong Nazi leanings because
of their original status under the
Hapsburgs. (They fought the Serbs
in World War I). Then too they are
geographically situated right in the
path of the invasion on terrain flat
enough to permit the swift passage
of mechanized forces.
The Serbs and Slovenes have a
more mountainous region to de
fend, and since they took on the
huge Austrian Empire in the last
war, they are not too averse to
doing so again—with the promise
of strong and immediate British
support.
With the retention of Dr. Vladimir
Matchek, Croat peasant leader, as
first vice-premier in the new gov
ernment, it became evident that the
Yugoslavs are going to hang together
—at least for the present.
* * *
is still reported to be eagerly
offering its good offices as media
tor —though the Duce is being very
cagey about it. The idea is that the
Yugoslavs must appear to ask him
for help. He thinks it would look
bad for Italy to appear over-eager.
Terms under which Dr. Matchek
entered the government include
guarantees of continuation of the
Croatian autonomy agreement of
August 1938; the appointment of a
supreme council of three—a Serb,
a Croat, and a Slovene—to out
rank the cabinet in matters of high
policy; and a promise by the gov
ernment to avoid war with Ger
many by all means compatible with
Yugoslav "independence, integ
rity, and honor."
Clearly the Yugoslavs thought the
agreement signed by Prince Paul's
cabinet, though it did not permit the
passage of German troops through
Yugoslav territory, was not com
patible with the three tenets named
above. And the question now is: can
the Yugoslavs come to any sort of
agreement with Germany which
will not make the Germans look like
perfect prize dam' fools, and still
retain their independence, integrity,
and honor?
* * *
STRATEGICALLY, Hitler almost
has to have Yugoslavia within
the Axis orbit, and psychologically
it will be next to impossible for him
to withdraw from his present stand
without tremendous loss of prestige.
"Face" is almost as big a word in
Germany as it is in Japan.
At present the only way Hitler
can attack the British in Greece
is down the Struma River valley
which goes from Bulgaria to Sa
lonika, unless he chooses to try to
join the Italians in Albania. The
only railroad which can be used
for the transport of his supplies
and men goes from what used to
be Austria down through Yugo
slavia to Greece. Then, too. Yugo
slavia's Marava and Vardar val
leys lead straight down from Bel
grade to Salonika. And the strong
est British forces are entrenched
on this peninsula.
It looks as though Yugoslavia's
chance of avoiding an invasion with
out falling flat on its face at Hitler's
feet are very slim indeed.

YESTERDAY Yugoslavia again

The Croats have been at logger
heads with the predominant Serb
group ever since General Dusan
Simovitch's anti-Axis coup d'etat of
a week ago. In the first place the
powerful Croatian element has
shown strong Nazi leanings because
of their original status under the
Hapsburgs. (They fought the Serbs
in World War I). Then too they are
geographically situated right in the
path of the invasion on terrain flat
enough to permit the swift passage
of mechanized forces.
The Serbs and Slovenes have a
more mountainous region to de
fend, and since they took on the
huge Austrian Empire in the last
war, they are not too averse to
doing so again—with the promise
of strong and immediate British
support.

Clearly the Yugoslavs thought the
agreement signed by Prince Paul's
cabinet, though it did not permit the
passage of German troops through
Yugoslav territory, was not com
patible with the three tenets named

the Yugoslavs come to any sort of
agreement with Germany which
will not make the Germans look like
perfect prize dam' fools, and still

At present the only way Hitler
