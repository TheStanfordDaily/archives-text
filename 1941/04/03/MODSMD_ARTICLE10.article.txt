# Farm's F.D.R. Gets Grades While Being 'Good Democrat'
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
(Editor's Note: Today's article on Laurence Grannis is the first of a
series of features on outstanding scholarship holders.)

Stanford's favorite F.D.R. impersonator is "Shorty" Grannis, who signs
his first name Laurence on the dotted line of a reg book. Grannis holds
one of the nine current Gamble scholarships.

"Muheim put me in the Gaieties,
this year because he was desper
ate," Shorty modestly asserts. "Harry
is just a sour, bitter old man. He's
getting bald and very fat."
CAREER AT PASADENA
Grannis picked up his acting hobby
at Pasadena J.C., where he starred
in a Roosevelt impersonation at a
program called Crafty Music Hall.
He got his technique down pat by
faithfully attending all movies which
were preceded by newsreels of the
President.
"I want it understood that I do
not make fun of Roosevelt," Grannis
emphasized. "I portray him as a
nice, good humored man because I
am a good Democrat. And that
word "good" is unnecessary since it
is synonymous with Democrat."
ACTIVITY MAN ON FARM
Besides his role in Farm enter
tainment, Grannis takes an active
part in student government as a
member of Men's Vocom. He is also
one of 12 students in charge of stu
dent body participation in the Fif
tieth Anniversary Celebrations.
The extent of Grannis' sports rec
ord at Stanford is fourth-string
rugby.
"It is very doubtful that I will
ever rise above fourth string," Gran
nis said. "In fact, I think I'm prob
ably the worst athlete that ever hit
Stanford."
WON SCHOLARSHIP
Most interesting event in Grannis'
financial achievements is his hashing
job. Shorty is not an ordinary
hasher of the everyday run. He is a
Beta who hashes at the Theta house.
"I have no comment to make on
this situation," Grannis said when
first queried. Later he added that
the Thetas are a good bunch and
that he has lots of fun hashing
there.
