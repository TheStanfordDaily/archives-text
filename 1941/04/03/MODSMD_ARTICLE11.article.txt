# Halls Aim First Campaign Guns

### 
The starting gun for the A.S.S.U.
spring elections went off with a
bang today when certain hall mem
bers sent out a circular letter based
on the idea that, by the combined
actino of all those in halls, a repre
sentative student body president and
vice-president can be elected.
They claim that for a long time
there has been a belief that the Row
can't be beaten. The proof of this
arises from the fact that the last
hall president was elected in 1934,
the letter says. Since then, the Row
has won every time, sometimes by
large margins, sometimes by small
ones.
According to the letter, the im
portant fact is that the hall men
and women did not vote. In many
cases, a few more hall voters would
have elected a hall candidate. The
leaders of this movement urge all
those living in halls to co-operate
in the coming election.
