# Martini Sings Tonight at 8:15 To End Series
## Seats Still Available In Union, Box Office For Tenor's Concert 
### 
Nino Martini, leading tenor of the
Metropolitan Opera, will present the
last concert of the 1940-41 series to
night at 8:15 o'clock in the Memorial
Auditorium. Tickets may still be ob
tained at the Concert Series office in
the Old Union, or at the box office
tonight.
Bom in Verona, Mr. Martini began
his colorful singing career as soloist
in the choir of San Fermo's Church.
He made his operatic debut in "Rigo
letto" and through his successful
performance was signed for the lead
in "I Puritani." An F above high C
is called for in one of the arias of
this opera and for 50 years no tenor
had been able to undertake it. With
a vocal range of three octaves, Mr.
Martini accomplished the difficult
part.
After a concert tour of European
music centers, Mr. Martini came to
America to produce five singing pic
tures in Italian. He was signed as
leading tenor of the Philadelphia
opera. His fame in the United
States has been equally great in ra
dio, on the screen, and on the con
cert stage as well as in opera. He is
now the leading lyric tenor of the
Metropolitan opera, and is the only
singer ever to have signed with the
Metropolitan without an audition.
Miguel Sandoval will be the ac
companist at the piano tonight and
will also render several solos be
tween Mr. Martini's groups of selec
tions. The first group will include
three famous arias, "O Del Mio Dolce
Ardor" by Gluck, "L'esperto No
chiero" by Bononcini, and "Ama
rilli" by Caccini. Also listed on the
program is the "Aria from the opera
'Suzzane'" by Paladilhe.
Mr. Martini will end his program
with two groups of songs, including
Rachmaninoff's "The Floods of
Spring," "Sigh no more," by Aikin,
Sandoval's "I Come to You," "La
Campanella" by Liszt-Busoni, and
Paderewski's "Nocturne."
