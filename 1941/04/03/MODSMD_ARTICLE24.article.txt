Declaring the United States to be
legally at war with Germany, Dr.
Waldo Chamberlain, associate re
search historian of the Hoover War
Libe, went on to prove his state
ment to the Luncheon Club yester
day noon.
Dr. Chamberlain analyzed the re
cent United States occupation of
German, Italian and French ships in
American harbors. The occupation
by the Coast Guard was the first
action of that kind since the law
making such occupation or forfeiture
legal was passed in 1917.
Dr. Chamberlain explained that
almost all countries have similar
laws forbidding foreign or domestic
ships to "wittingly" cause damage
to their own ships as was intended
by the Axis ships. All those involved
in the scene are liable, under the
same law, to $25,000 fine or 20 years
imprisonment or both. Nothing has
been decided yet.
"According to international law,"
said Dr. Chamberlain, "we have
been at war with Germany since last
fall when we first sold England a
ship; but neither America nor Ger
many wishes to admit it."
