# New Paly Plan To Eliminate Traffic Jams
## 
### VIC MINAHAN 
If the machinery that makes up
Palo Alto's municipal government
can get under way in the near fu
ture on a master traffic plan re
cently adopted by the city council,
Stanford students may soon go to
Paly via their new underpasses with
out fears of becoming lost in the
maze of petty traffic jams that now
make up University Avenue.
The plan, which was suggested by
the Chamber of Commerce over a
year ago and has since been accepted
by both the City Planning Com
mission and the Council, will do
away with all parking on Univer
sity Avenue, turning it into a six
lane boulevard.
FREE PARKING
The objections of the merchants
to this eliminating of street parking
will be met by the providing of free
public parking lots in the center of
each square block, connected by al
leys to the cross-streets.
According to the Chamber of
Commerce report, these lots would
add 423 parking spaces to the total
of the business district, thus theo
retically providing merchants with
more customers than at present.
Tho plan, unique among cities the
size of Palo Alto, became the official
plan of the city when the Council
adopted it, but whether it will be
put into operation or not still de
pends on a number of other factors
â€”mostly financial. City engineers
are now studying the practicability
of cutting out holes in some of the
more filled-up blocks in order to
provide the parking spaces.
TRAFFIC MUDDLED
The main controversy at present
is not over the new plan, but what
to do about the traffic situation un
til it is put into operation. Various
civic organizations have suggested
parallel parking instead of the diag
onal system now in effect. This
would make the avenue a four-lane
one, and the stoppages in traffic flow
now caused by cars backing out of
the diagonal spaces would be elimi
nated. It seems, however, that this
would lessen the total parking spaces
by 49, and the merchants are fight
ing the proposal bitterly.
In the meantime, Stanford stu
dents and other car-driving resi
dents of the community breeze
through the underpasses ("Gee,
won't it be swell when the under
passes are finished? We'll just
breeze through . . .") and start the
long trek of stops, starts and cuss
ing that make up a trip down the
avenue. They say there's a psy
chiatrist on Ramona Street that's
doing wonderful business.
