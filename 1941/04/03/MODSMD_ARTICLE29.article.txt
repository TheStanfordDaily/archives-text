## 
### BERYL ROBISON 
"I read a story of the Inca Em
pire as a small boy," said Paul R.
Hanna, professor of education, "and
ever since that time I have had a
desire to explore the Inca trails of
the Andes. When the chance to see
the West Coast of South America
actually presented itself I jumped
at the opportunity ot satisfy my boy
hood ambition.
Professor Hanna presented an il
lustrated lecture entitled, '"Follow
ing Inca Trails Through the Andes"
in the Education Auditorium yester
day evening. He showed colored
slides of his travels on the west
coast of South America, through
Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. The
trips were made by plane, train, au
tomobile, burro, and foot.
The slides were divided into two
main groups, one showing contempo
rary life in the Andes, the other

showing ancient Inca archaeological
remains. The slides of contempo
rary life showed small Indian vil
lages with their markets in which
Indian women sell pottery and fruits
to "the gringos" and many brilliantly
colored slides of the Peruvian coun
tryside.
Among slides showing archaeo
logical remains, Professor Hanna
presented pictures showing the re
cent discovery of Phuyu Pata Marka
(City Above the Clouds) considered
one of the most important discov
eries in recent decades.
In closing, Professor Hanna spoke
of the contributions which the
American Republics can make to
one another. We should help our
South American neighbors to attain
universal free education and they
can teach us their philosophy of the
good life, he said.
