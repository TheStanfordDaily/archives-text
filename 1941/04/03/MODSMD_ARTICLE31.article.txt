### 
When Ram's Head presents the
trio of one-act plays next Friday
and Saturday nights at 8:15 o'clock
in the Little Theater it will be well
on the way to establishing a tradi
tion.
The idea of a one-act play con
test, open to the campus, with full
stage production and membership in
Ram's Head as the prizes, was first
put to the test during winter quar
ter of 1939. First plays given were
June Lee Dimmett's "Angry Moun
tain," Art Levinson's "Thirty Years,"
and Jim Stone's "Beginning With
out End." Levinson and Stone were
Chappie and Daily editors, respec
tively.
Last year the program moved out
of the experimental stage with "Sat
urday Night," a portrait of sorority
house life by Gloria Workman; "We
Shall Not Sleep," a bitter war play,
by Ted Hatfield; and "Meet Mr.
Smith," a domestic comedy by Bud
Cady.
Next week's performances will
signify a now fully accepted idea,
and a full realization of Ram's Head's
effort to give serious, experimental
play presentations, according to Di
rector Ash Wilson. The program
includes "Where's Mr. Dryer" by
Harry Muheirn, "Reunion of the
Crown" by Alladine Bell, and
"Louis Takes a Wife" by A1 Zelver.
