# Third Place Indians Face Strong Gael Nine Today In C.I.B.A. League Game
## 
### 
Floating along in third place in an aquatic CIIJA pennant race, Stan
ford's varsity nine ties into St. Mary's today in the last encounter of the
two teams' three-game series—barring further rain.
Plans were being made last night to switch the game, originally sched
uled for the Cacl diamond, to Sunken Diamond—if the local field is in

better condition than the
turf. If played here, the time will i
be 3:15 o'clock.
Yesterday afternoon Earl Sheely's
crew upset California, 6-4. Bear er- !
rors and pitcher Freddie Kirtlan's
wildness spelled defeat for the
Blue and Gold. Bob Cardoza, j
catcher, and Lee Mohr, second base- [
man for the Gaels, each got three '
hits.
DECIDES SERIES
Today's game will decide the Phoe
nix-Indian f'eudin' for the '41 sea
son, both clubs having one victory
in their scheduled three-game
series. Wes Bailey, Gael fireballer,
pitched his mates to a 2-1 win in
the opening encounter, but Stanford
came back to even the count the
next week, 6-5, getting to Bailey for
10 safeties.
With 10 games yet to be played,
a Stanford squad for the first time
in many a moon actually has pen
nant hopes which are not un
founded. Occupying third spot be
hind Southern Cal and California in j
the standings, the Cardinals have a
great chance of upsetting the dope
and taking a high position in the
league finish.
Two conference victories over El I
Bruin during spring vacation show- j
ed the Indians with a goodly amount I
of hitting power and the ability to
bunch their hits at the right times.

Hal Costello led the hit parade at a I
