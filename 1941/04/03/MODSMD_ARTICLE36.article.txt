# Cinder Squad To Meet S.J.
## 
### 
Without a single veteran on his
squad, Tiny Hartranft brings the
San Jose Spartans to Angell Field
Saturday to do battle with the Stan
ford track team.
Tiny has eleven junior college
transfers on his team and he isn't
sure just what any of them can do,
inasmuch as the Spartans' meet with
Cal Poly was rained out last week.
Last year San Jose State built
around Tony Sunseri and Tickie
Vasconcellos. With the graduation
of these two stars, the nucleus of
the squad is gone, and it is hard to
tell just how strong the Spartans
will be. However, a good guess is
that they won't be very powerful.
NEWCOMERS GOOD
If the newcomers live up to their
best marks, San Jose will have bal
• ance in the field events; but there is
not a single outstanding runner on
the team. Fred Kmetovic, brother
of Stanford's Pete, is probably the
best middle distance man on the
squad. He runs the half in two min
utes flat. Jim Kerr is the sprinter,
with a mark of 22.5 in the furlong.
A1 Ornelas from Los Angeles has
been clocked in 4:40 for the mile.
San Jose will give the Indians
plenty of trouble in the field events.
Roger Romines, a Salinas J.C. trans
fer, has done 6 feet 3 inches in the
high jump and should take points
for the Spartans. Stanford will have
Jim Lincoln back in action along
with Vern Hart and Ed Voss.
13-FOOT VAULTER
Ed Schneider has cleared 13 feet
3 inches in the pole vault, which is
good enough to win the meet unless
Tomaso has a good day. John Dier
ker from Sacramento J.C. took sec
ond in the Class B javelin event at
the Long Beach Relays. His best
mark 5s 190 feet.
Larry O'Connor, transfer from Ba
kersfield, is the Spartans' best weight
man with marks of 46 feet in the
shot and 145 feet in the discus.

the team. Fred Kmetovic, brother
of Stanford's Pete, is probably the
best middle distance man on the
squad. He runs the half in two min
utes flat. Jim Kerr is the sprinter,
with a mark of 22.5 in the furlong.
A1 Ornelas from Los Angeles has
been clocked in 4:40 for the mile.
San Jose will give the Indians
plenty of trouble in the field events.
Roger Romines, a Salinas J.C. trans
fer, has done 6 feet 3 inches in the
high jump and should take points
for the Spartans. Stanford will have
Jim Lincoln back in action along
with Vern Hart and Ed Voss.
13-FOOT VAULTER
Ed Schneider has cleared 13 feet
3 inches in the pole vault, which is
good enough to win the meet unless
Tomaso has a good day. John Dier
ker from Sacramento J.C. took sec
ond in the Class B javelin event at
the Long Beach Relays. His best
mark 5s 190 feet.
Larry O'Connor, transfer from Ba
kersfield, is the Spartans' best weight
man with marks of 46 feet in the
shot and 145 feet in the discus.
Without a single veteran on his
squad, Tiny Hartranft brings the
San Jose Spartans to Angell Field
Saturday to do battle with the Stan
ford track team.
Tiny has eleven junior college
transfers on his team and he isn't
sure just what any of them can do,
inasmuch as the Spartans' meet with
Cal Poly was rained out last week.
Last year San Jose State built
around Tony Sunseri and Tickie
Vasconcellos. With the graduation
of these two stars, the nucleus of
the squad is gone, and it is hard to
tell just how strong the Spartans
will be. However, a good guess is
that they won't be very powerful.
NEWCOMERS GOOD
If the newcomers live up to their
best marks, San Jose will have bal
• ance in the field events; but there is
not a single outstanding runner on
the team. Fred Kmetovic, brother
