# '44 Tracksters To Race Preps
## 
### 
With just two days of real prac
tico behind them after spring vaca
tion, Stanford's powerful freshman
tracksters, weather permitting, will
face the Contra Costa County High
School All-Stars Saturday morning
at 10 o'clock on Angell Field.
According to Frosh Mentor Clyde
Jeffrey, many of the frosh cinder
men will be somewhat out of con
dition due to their week vacation
layoff. However, the yearlings, off
their 81 to 50 shellacking of the
Modesto Junior College the next to
last week of school, still have a
strong chance of victory.
Among the encouraging items is
the performance of sprinter Bob
Waters, who copped the 100-yard
dash in 9.8 and the 220 in 21.8
against the jaysee men. Waters,
Buck Fawcett, and Kenny Taix may
sweep the sprints Saturday.
One of the closest rivalries on the
team is between hurdlers Don Reiss
and Joe Mardesich. In the Modesto
meet Reiss hit three hurdles and
went down but Mardesich went on
1o run away from the Modesto high
hurdlers with a fast 15.3 flight. Reiss
came back later to edge Mardesich
in the 220 lows in 25.7.
Olher good performances have
been turned in by Russ Collier in
the 880, Bob Compton in the mile,
Bill Spaulding in the 440, and Jean
LaMoure and Bill Joslyn in the
weight events. Bob Bonner also has
shown great improvement in the
middle distance races.
