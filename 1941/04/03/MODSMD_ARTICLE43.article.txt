## 
### 
Stanford's freshman swimming
team will meet Sequoia High School
this afternoon at the Encina Pools.
The meet is not open to the public.
Saturday the frosh mermen tussle
with Stockton J.C. at 2 o'clock.
Admission is free and open to
the public. This meet has pi*omise
of producing some of the best ex
hibitions of swimming of this sea
son. Swimming for the frosh will
be a new man, Bob Hind. Accord
ing to Coach Nort Thornton, he is
a promising breaststroker and will
probably be used in the 50- and
100-yard events.
Stockton's chief threat is in the
person of free-styler Ralph Wright.
He has swum the 220 in 2:27.0,
which is one and one-half seconds
faster than the official P.C.C. record
established by Roy Vitousek of Stan
ford. Undoubtedly, Wright will be
out to beat Vitousek's time.
