# Eighty Football Men turn Out For Practice
## 
### 
With an initial turnout of 81 men,
Stanford's spring practice sessions
were formally inaugurated yester
day with a meeting in Room 214.
With field workouts for new men
scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday afternoons from :»:45
to 5:45 and chalk talks on Monday
and Thursday, old men were re
leased for two weeks.
"A year age we started on a pro
gram of football here at Stanford.
The results were satisfying when we
wound up the season on January 1.
But if you think that the rest of the
teams that are in this conference
aren't going to try to make things
mighty tough for us next season,
you're sadly mistaken," Shaugh
nessy said.
STRESSES GRADES
Stressing the necessity of report
ing to each session of the practice
period, Shaughnessy also impressed
upon those present the need of keep
ing up their academic work.
"Last year's football team had the
highest average grades of any Stan
ford squad in the past 12 years," he
said. "If you can't keep up your
work, we don't want you out there."
REVIVAL OF GREYS
Repeating what he had said be
fore about wanting a large turnout,
Shaughnessy said that if there are
enough men out for the squad, the
Greys will be revived next year and
a schedule of games made out for
them. Urging new men to report for
practice regularly, he stressed the
point that they will have a great
deal of trouble getting any place
on the squad next fall if they miss
the first few drills and blackboard
sessions.
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION
"We have a large enough coaching
staff to give plenty of individual at
tention to every man that turns out
for practice," he stated. "All men on
last year's Rose Bowl squad will be
excused from workouts for the first
two weeks so that we can give more
attention to those fellows out for the
first time this spring."
The meeting broke up into confer
ences with the individual coaches,
after training rules had been ex
plained to all of the newcomers.

scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday afternoons from :»:45
to 5:45 and chalk talks on Monday
and Thursday, old men were re
leased for two weeks.
"A year age we started on a pro
gram of football here at Stanford.
The results were satisfying when we
wound up the season on January 1.
But if you think that the rest of the
teams that are in this conference
aren't going to try to make things
mighty tough for us next season,
you're sadly mistaken," Shaugh
nessy said.
STRESSES GRADES
Stressing the necessity of report
ing to each session of the practice
period, Shaughnessy also impressed
upon those present the need of keep
ing up their academic work.
"Last year's football team had the
highest average grades of any Stan
ford squad in the past 12 years," he
said. "If you can't keep up your
work, we don't want you out there."
REVIVAL OF GREYS
Repeating what he had said be
fore about wanting a large turnout,
Shaughnessy said that if there are
enough men out for the squad, the
Greys will be revived next year and
a schedule of games made out for
them. Urging new men to report for
practice regularly, he stressed the
point that they will have a great
deal of trouble getting any place
on the squad next fall if they miss
the first few drills and blackboard
sessions.
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION
"We have a large enough coaching
staff to give plenty of individual at
tention to every man that turns out
for practice," he stated. "All men on
last year's Rose Bowl squad will be
excused from workouts for the first
two weeks so that we can give more
attention to those fellows out for the
first time this spring."
The meeting broke up into confer
ences with the individual coaches,
after training rules had been ex
plained to all of the newcomers.
With an initial turnout of 81 men,
Stanford's spring practice sessions
were formally inaugurated yester
day with a meeting in Room 214.
With field workouts for new men
scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday
