r jj , llOTS thunk up while watching
Ihc Stanford baseballers in ac
tion against U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.:
CLAUDE PURKITT is a greatly
improved pitcher this year. Follow
ing Stanford's Tuesday (5-4 win over
the Bruins, the Indians' hefty num
ber two flinger pitched his club to a '
4-1 win. And the manner in which j
he set the Bruins down with only
five hits left no doubt but what
Coach Harry Wolter has a much
better pitching staff to work with
this year than he had last season.
Purkitt was never in serious
trouble and several times he struck
out the final batter of the inning
when the pressure was on. Last year
Big Claude had plenty of speed but
had a lot of trouble finding the
plate. Against the Bruins, however,
he was just wild enough to be very
effective and never walked a man
when the chips were down.
All through his high school days
and his freshman year at Stanford.
Purkitt was a catcher, but in his
sophomore season Wolter decided to
make a pitcher out of him. From
the looks of things, he has suc
ceeded.
* * id
HAL COSTELLO really pounded
the apple on the southern trip, com
ing home with a .400 average for the
three games, which includes a home
run clout against the Trojans. Cos
tello was a classy fielder at first base
last season but wasn't too strong at
the plate. Playing left field this sea
son, he has found his batting eye and
is covering his territory afield in
good style.
BOCH CARUSO looks more like a
big time baseballer than any other
Indian, with the exception of Cap
tain Cootie Thompson. Jyst the way
he handles himself around the key
stone sack and at the plate marks
Caruso as a man to watch in the fu
ture. We understand he had more
than one chance to move into or
ganized baseball before he even
came to college. Against the Bruins,
Caruso whacked out a nice triple
with men on base, but he was
tagged out at home when the third
base coach waved him in.
RUSS SMITH, a southpaw pitcher,
looked plenty good on relief duty
against U.S.C., giving up only one
run in the seven and a third innings
he toiled on the mound. He got in
hot water several times, but most of
the time he managed to pitch him
self out of the hole. Chances are
he'll see lots of duty as a relief hurler
this season.
ACE lIANLON gives the Indians
added batting power, as evidenced
by his run-scoring line drive over
third base in the second Ucla fracas,
but so far he doesn't appear to be
I much ahead of either Jack Randall
or Herb Atkinson as far as work be
hind the plate is concerned. RAN
DALL turned in a good perform
j ance as the Cards dropped a ball
game to the Trojans.
PHIL WOLF, who was a sensa
tion as a pitcher on Harry Shipkey's
frosh nine last season, got off to a
bad start against U.S.C., his first
conference starting role. Nervous
ness appeared to be Wolf's biggest
difficulty, and he had such a tough
time finding the platter that he
I grooved several pitches to keep from
I walking too many men. That was
| duck soup for the Trojan hitters,
and they pounded him for seven
runs before Smith relieved him with
two out in the second inning.
But we're still convinced that this
big right-hander has plenty on the

ball and that he'll erase that Tro-
I jan setback in no uncertain manner
, before tho season goes much further.
Just when Wolf was rounding into
form early this season, he suffered a
cut hand when he stuck his paw
through a glass door. It seems quite
likely that the delay thus caused in
his training period was largely re
sponsible for his poor start in con
ference competition.
! IT'S going to be a rough, tough 1
job for any team in the C.1.8.A.
to knock U.S.C. out of the top spot
in the standings. Coach Sam Barry
has a red hot ball club, make no
mistake about that.
A great deal of the Trojan
strength comes from their infield,
which is the classiest we have seen
in the C.1.8.A. in the last two years.
Bruce Konopka at first, Frank
Koski at second, Bud Dawson at (
third, and Merrill Combs at short
make up as near an airtight first
defense as will be found in college
ball on the Pacific Coast this season.
Against the Indians Konopka look
ed particularly effective, especially
on defense, where he speared peg
after peg with effortless ease. And
Dawson, who is only a sophomore,
will probably burn up the league be

fore he graduates. In at least a dozen
chances against Stanford, Dawson
made nary an error or a false move.
He has the makings all right.
The thing that is likely to give the
Barrymen more than a little trouble
before the year is out is the pitching
situation. For aside from lanky Ed
Vitalich, the Trojans aren't too well
set for hurlers.
They can get along in fine style as
long as they don't have to play too
many games in the same week and
can let Vitalich get rested up. But
when they come north next week,
they're likely to run into trouble, es
pecially since they'll be playing a
double header against Stanford on
Wednesday, the game to start at
1:15 o'clock.
It is doubtful if Barry will be able
to use his ace flinger more than
twice during the trip, and that's
likely to make it bad for U.S.C. At
least, that is what the Indians are
hoping, for Stanford appears to have
the best chance of any team in the
C.1.8.A. to knock the Trojans off
their lofty perch. However, we
can't forget the California Bears,
who still have Mike Koll, the pitcher
who triumphed over Stanford in
three straight games last season.

HAL COSTELLO really pounded
the apple on the southern trip, com
ing home with a .400 average for the
three games, which includes a home
run clout against the Trojans. Cos
tello was a classy fielder at first base
last season but wasn't too strong at
the plate. Playing left field this sea
son, he has found his batting eye and
is covering his territory afield in
good style.
BOCH CARUSO looks more like a
big time baseballer than any other
Indian, with the exception of Cap
tain Cootie Thompson. Jyst the way
he handles himself around the key
stone sack and at the plate marks
Caruso as a man to watch in the fu
ture. We understand he had more
than one chance to move into or
ganized baseball before he even
came to college. Against the Bruins,
Caruso whacked out a nice triple
with men on base, but he was
tagged out at home when the third
base coach waved him in.
RUSS SMITH, a southpaw pitcher,
looked plenty good on relief duty
against U.S.C., giving up only one
run in the seven and a third innings
he toiled on the mound. He got in
hot water several times, but most of
the time he managed to pitch him
self out of the hole. Chances are
he'll see lots of duty as a relief hurler
this season.
ACE lIANLON gives the Indians
added batting power, as evidenced
by his run-scoring line drive over
third base in the second Ucla fracas,
but so far he doesn't appear to be
I much ahead of either Jack Randall
or Herb Atkinson as far as work be
hind the plate is concerned. RAN
DALL turned in a good perform
j ance as the Cards dropped a ball
game to the Trojans.
PHIL WOLF, who was a sensa
tion as a pitcher on Harry Shipkey's
frosh nine last season, got off to a
bad start against U.S.C., his first
conference starting role. Nervous
ness appeared to be Wolf's biggest
difficulty, and he had such a tough
time finding the platter that he
I grooved several pitches to keep from
I walking too many men. That was
| duck soup for the Trojan hitters,
and they pounded him for seven
runs before Smith relieved him with
two out in the second inning.
But we're still convinced that this
big right-hander has plenty on the

ball and that he'll erase that Tro-
I jan setback in no uncertain manner
, before tho season goes much further.
Just when Wolf was rounding into
form early this season, he suffered a
cut hand when he stuck his paw
through a glass door. It seems quite
likely that the delay thus caused in
his training period was largely re
sponsible for his poor start in con
ference competition.
! IT'S going to be a rough, tough 1
job for any team in the C.1.8.A.
to knock U.S.C. out of the top spot
in the standings. Coach Sam Barry
has a red hot ball club, make no
mistake about that.
A great deal of the Trojan
strength comes from their infield,
which is the classiest we have seen
in the C.1.8.A. in the last two years.
Bruce Konopka at first, Frank
Koski at second, Bud Dawson at (
third, and Merrill Combs at short
make up as near an airtight first
defense as will be found in college
ball on the Pacific Coast this season.
Against the Indians Konopka look
ed particularly effective, especially
on defense, where he speared peg
after peg with effortless ease. And
Dawson, who is only a sophomore,
will probably burn up the league be

fore he graduates. In at least a dozen
chances against Stanford, Dawson
made nary an error or a false move.
He has the makings all right.
The thing that is likely to give the
Barrymen more than a little trouble
before the year is out is the pitching
situation. For aside from lanky Ed
Vitalich, the Trojans aren't too well
set for hurlers.
They can get along in fine style as
long as they don't have to play too
many games in the same week and
can let Vitalich get rested up. But
when they come north next week,
they're likely to run into trouble, es
pecially since they'll be playing a
double header against Stanford on
Wednesday, the game to start at
1:15 o'clock.
It is doubtful if Barry will be able
to use his ace flinger more than
twice during the trip, and that's
likely to make it bad for U.S.C. At
least, that is what the Indians are
hoping, for Stanford appears to have
the best chance of any team in the
C.1.8.A. to knock the Trojans off
their lofty perch. However, we
can't forget the California Bears,
who still have Mike Koll, the pitcher
who triumphed over Stanford in
three straight games last season.

CLAUDE PURKITT is a greatly
improved pitcher this year. Follow

the Bruins, the Indians' hefty num
ber two flinger pitched his club to a '
4-1 win. And the manner in which j
he set the Bruins down with only
five hits left no doubt but what
Coach Harry Wolter has a much
better pitching staff to work with
this year than he had last season.
Purkitt was never in serious
trouble and several times he struck
out the final batter of the inning
when the pressure was on. Last year
Big Claude had plenty of speed but
had a lot of trouble finding the
plate. Against the Bruins, however,
he was just wild enough to be very

against U.S.C., giving up only one
run in the seven and a third innings
he toiled on the mound. He got in
hot water several times, but most of
the time he managed to pitch him
self out of the hole. Chances are
he'll see lots of duty as a relief hurler
this season.
ACE lIANLON gives the Indians
added batting power, as evidenced
by his run-scoring line drive over
third base in the second Ucla fracas,
but so far he doesn't appear to be
I much ahead of either Jack Randall
or Herb Atkinson as far as work be
hind the plate is concerned. RAN
DALL turned in a good perform
j ance as the Cards dropped a ball
game to the Trojans.
PHIL WOLF, who was a sensa
tion as a pitcher on Harry Shipkey's
frosh nine last season, got off to a
bad start against U.S.C., his first
conference starting role. Nervous
ness appeared to be Wolf's biggest
difficulty, and he had such a tough
time finding the platter that he
I grooved several pitches to keep from
I walking too many men. That was
| duck soup for the Trojan hitters,
and they pounded him for seven
runs before Smith relieved him with
two out in the second inning.
But we're still convinced that this
big right-hander has plenty on the

ball and that he'll erase that Tro-
I jan setback in no uncertain manner
, before tho season goes much further.
Just when Wolf was rounding into
form early this season, he suffered a
cut hand when he stuck his paw
through a glass door. It seems quite
likely that the delay thus caused in
his training period was largely re
sponsible for his poor start in con
ference competition.
! IT'S going to be a rough, tough 1
job for any team in the C.1.8.A.
to knock U.S.C. out of the top spot
in the standings. Coach Sam Barry
has a red hot ball club, make no
mistake about that.
A great deal of the Trojan
strength comes from their infield,
which is the classiest we have seen
in the C.1.8.A. in the last two years.
Bruce Konopka at first, Frank
Koski at second, Bud Dawson at (
third, and Merrill Combs at short
make up as near an airtight first
defense as will be found in college
ball on the Pacific Coast this season.
Against the Indians Konopka look
ed particularly effective, especially
on defense, where he speared peg
after peg with effortless ease. And
Dawson, who is only a sophomore,
will probably burn up the league be

fore he graduates. In at least a dozen
chances against Stanford, Dawson
made nary an error or a false move.
He has the makings all right.
The thing that is likely to give the
Barrymen more than a little trouble
before the year is out is the pitching
situation. For aside from lanky Ed
Vitalich, the Trojans aren't too well
set for hurlers.
They can get along in fine style as
long as they don't have to play too
many games in the same week and
can let Vitalich get rested up. But
when they come north next week,
they're likely to run into trouble, es
pecially since they'll be playing a
double header against Stanford on
Wednesday, the game to start at
1:15 o'clock.
It is doubtful if Barry will be able
to use his ace flinger more than
twice during the trip, and that's
likely to make it bad for U.S.C. At
least, that is what the Indians are
hoping, for Stanford appears to have
the best chance of any team in the
C.1.8.A. to knock the Trojans off
their lofty perch. However, we
can't forget the California Bears,
who still have Mike Koll, the pitcher
who triumphed over Stanford in
three straight games last season.
r jj , llOTS thunk up while watching
Ihc Stanford baseballers in ac
tion against U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.:
CLAUDE PURKITT is a greatly
improved pitcher this year. Follow
ing Stanford's Tuesday (5-4 win over
the Bruins, the Indians' hefty num
ber two flinger pitched his club to a '
4-1 win. And the manner in which j
he set the Bruins down with only
five hits left no doubt but what
Coach Harry Wolter has a much
better pitching staff to work with
this year than he had last season.
Purkitt was never in serious
trouble and several times he struck
out the final batter of the inning
when the pressure was on. Last year
Big Claude had plenty of speed but
had a lot of trouble finding the
plate. Against the Bruins, however,
he was just wild enough to be very
effective and never walked a man
when the chips were down.
All through his high school days
and his freshman year at Stanford.
Purkitt was a catcher, but in his
sophomore season Wolter decided to
make a pitcher out of him. From
the looks of things, he has suc
ceeded.

HAL COSTELLO really pounded
the apple on the southern trip, com
ing home with a .400 average for the
three games, which includes a home
run clout against the Trojans. Cos
tello was a classy fielder at first base
last season but wasn't too strong at
the plate. Playing left field this sea
son, he has found his batting eye and
is covering his territory afield in
good style.
BOCH CARUSO looks more like a
big time baseballer than any other
Indian, with the exception of Cap
tain Cootie Thompson. Jyst the way
he handles himself around the key
stone sack and at the plate marks
Caruso as a man to watch in the fu
ture. We understand he had more

Caruso whacked out a nice triple

| duck soup for the Trojan hitters,
and they pounded him for seven
runs before Smith relieved him with
two out in the second inning.
But we're still convinced that this
big right-hander has plenty on the

ball and that he'll erase that Tro-
I jan setback in no uncertain manner
, before tho season goes much further.
Just when Wolf was rounding into
form early this season, he suffered a
cut hand when he stuck his paw
through a glass door. It seems quite
likely that the delay thus caused in
his training period was largely re
sponsible for his poor start in con
ference competition.
! IT'S going to be a rough, tough 1
job for any team in the C.1.8.A.
to knock U.S.C. out of the top spot
in the standings. Coach Sam Barry
has a red hot ball club, make no
mistake about that.
A great deal of the Trojan
strength comes from their infield,
which is the classiest we have seen
in the C.1.8.A. in the last two years.
Bruce Konopka at first, Frank
Koski at second, Bud Dawson at (
third, and Merrill Combs at short
make up as near an airtight first
defense as will be found in college
ball on the Pacific Coast this season.
Against the Indians Konopka look
ed particularly effective, especially
on defense, where he speared peg
after peg with effortless ease. And
Dawson, who is only a sophomore,
will probably burn up the league be

fore he graduates. In at least a dozen
chances against Stanford, Dawson
made nary an error or a false move.
He has the makings all right.
The thing that is likely to give the
Barrymen more than a little trouble
before the year is out is the pitching
situation. For aside from lanky Ed
Vitalich, the Trojans aren't too well
set for hurlers.
They can get along in fine style as
long as they don't have to play too
many games in the same week and
can let Vitalich get rested up. But
when they come north next week,
they're likely to run into trouble, es
pecially since they'll be playing a
double header against Stanford on
Wednesday, the game to start at
1:15 o'clock.
It is doubtful if Barry will be able
to use his ace flinger more than
twice during the trip, and that's
likely to make it bad for U.S.C. At
least, that is what the Indians are
hoping, for Stanford appears to have
the best chance of any team in the
C.1.8.A. to knock the Trojans off
their lofty perch. However, we
can't forget the California Bears,
who still have Mike Koll, the pitcher
who triumphed over Stanford in
three straight games last season.
r jj , llOTS thunk up while watching
Ihc Stanford baseballers in ac
tion against U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.:
CLAUDE PURKITT is a greatly
improved pitcher this year. Follow
ing Stanford's Tuesday (5-4 win over
the Bruins, the Indians' hefty num
ber two flinger pitched his club to a '
4-1 win. And the manner in which j
he set the Bruins down with only
five hits left no doubt but what
Coach Harry Wolter has a much
better pitching staff to work with
this year than he had last season.
Purkitt was never in serious
trouble and several times he struck
out the final batter of the inning
when the pressure was on. Last year
Big Claude had plenty of speed but
had a lot of trouble finding the
plate. Against the Bruins, however,
he was just wild enough to be very
effective and never walked a man
when the chips were down.
All through his high school days
and his freshman year at Stanford.
Purkitt was a catcher, but in his
sophomore season Wolter decided to
make a pitcher out of him. From
the looks of things, he has suc
ceeded.
* * id
HAL COSTELLO really pounded
the apple on the southern trip, com
ing home with a .400 average for the
three games, which includes a home
run clout against the Trojans. Cos
tello was a classy fielder at first base
last season but wasn't too strong at
the plate. Playing left field this sea
son, he has found his batting eye and
is covering his territory afield in
good style.
BOCH CARUSO looks more like a
big time baseballer than any other
Indian, with the exception of Cap
tain Cootie Thompson. Jyst the way
he handles himself around the key
stone sack and at the plate marks
Caruso as a man to watch in the fu
ture. We understand he had more
than one chance to move into or
ganized baseball before he even
came to college. Against the Bruins,
Caruso whacked out a nice triple
with men on base, but he was
tagged out at home when the third
base coach waved him in.
RUSS SMITH, a southpaw pitcher,
looked plenty good on relief duty
against U.S.C., giving up only one
run in the seven and a third innings
he toiled on the mound. He got in
hot water several times, but most of
the time he managed to pitch him
self out of the hole. Chances are
he'll see lots of duty as a relief hurler
this season.
ACE lIANLON gives the Indians
added batting power, as evidenced
by his run-scoring line drive over
third base in the second Ucla fracas,
but so far he doesn't appear to be
I much ahead of either Jack Randall
or Herb Atkinson as far as work be
hind the plate is concerned. RAN
DALL turned in a good perform
j ance as the Cards dropped a ball
game to the Trojans.
PHIL WOLF, who was a sensa
tion as a pitcher on Harry Shipkey's
frosh nine last season, got off to a
bad start against U.S.C., his first
conference starting role. Nervous
ness appeared to be Wolf's biggest
difficulty, and he had such a tough
time finding the platter that he
