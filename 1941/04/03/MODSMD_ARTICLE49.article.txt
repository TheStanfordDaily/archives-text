IN this age of specialization, it is more than
ever necessary that a student in college have
definitely in mind what field he plans to enter.
It has been the self-assumed function of the
Men's Vocational Guidance Committee, under
the direction of Assistant Dean of Men Stanley
Sharp, to help students in every way possible to
make their decisions and to make them wisely.
This years program started fall quarter with
a concerted and highly successful drive to "sell
the students" on the Strong "Vocational Interest
Test," and during winter quarter consisted of a
well-attended series of Monday evening talks
by professors and experts in six general voca
tional fields.
But this quarter the program really hits its
peak.
Any Stanford man who wishes to is going to
have the opportunity to interview a top-ranking
executive in any vocational field.
And when Chairman Frank Mallory said "any
field," he meant just that —not just the old stand
bys law, medicine, etc. Successful men in trans
portation, personnel, radio, and the other mod
ern careers, in addition to the professions, have
gladly agreed to set aside half-hour periods from
their normal rush of duties just to sit down and
talk things over with any student or small group
of students who plan to enter their various fields
of work.
It should be emphasized that this is not a job
interview and moreover that the student is the
one doing the interviewing.
In the words of Dr. Sharp, the interviews pro
vide "a marvelous opportunity to get at first
hand a realistic picture of the vocation under
consideration."
These men who are granting their valuable
time to the students are enthusiastic about the
idea. And they are not going to dish out a rosy
picture of "easy money and quick advance
ment" if that is not the case. It usually isn't. Nor
are they going to paint the picture of their re
spective fields as black and uninviting.
They are going to be able to give their inter
viewers an unbiased, personal, commonsense
viewpoint which would not be available in any
other way to university students.
The whole idea, which The Daily heartily
endorses, cannot be claimed as original with
Stanford. Walter Hoving, prominent New York
businessman and influential Brown University
alumnus, first suggested the plan and it has
operated with commendable success at Brown.
But it is unique that during the first trial of the
idea at Stanford last year, 100 men applied for
interviews and 80 of them traveled the 35 miles
to and from San Francisco to talk it over with
the men who had made good. This year the
program has been greatly expanded and there
will be no repetition of the cases of the 20 men
who were turned away last year because no
one was available in the field requested.
If a man hasn't been contacted in your field,
they'll get you a man.
With the unlimited opportunities available,
the program should more than double its suc
cess of last year.—C. B.

Test," and during winter quarter consisted of a
well-attended series of Monday evening talks
by professors and experts in six general voca
tional fields.
But this quarter the program really hits its
peak.
Any Stanford man who wishes to is going to
have the opportunity to interview a top-ranking
executive in any vocational field.
And when Chairman Frank Mallory said "any
field," he meant just that —not just the old stand
bys law, medicine, etc. Successful men in trans
portation, personnel, radio, and the other mod
ern careers, in addition to the professions, have
gladly agreed to set aside half-hour periods from
their normal rush of duties just to sit down and
talk things over with any student or small group
of students who plan to enter their various fields
of work.
It should be emphasized that this is not a job
interview and moreover that the student is the
one doing the interviewing.
In the words of Dr. Sharp, the interviews pro
vide "a marvelous opportunity to get at first
hand a realistic picture of the vocation under
consideration."
These men who are granting their valuable
time to the students are enthusiastic about the
idea. And they are not going to dish out a rosy
picture of "easy money and quick advance
ment" if that is not the case. It usually isn't. Nor
are they going to paint the picture of their re
spective fields as black and uninviting.
They are going to be able to give their inter
viewers an unbiased, personal, commonsense
viewpoint which would not be available in any
other way to university students.
The whole idea, which The Daily heartily
endorses, cannot be claimed as original with
Stanford. Walter Hoving, prominent New York
businessman and influential Brown University
alumnus, first suggested the plan and it has
operated with commendable success at Brown.
But it is unique that during the first trial of the
idea at Stanford last year, 100 men applied for
interviews and 80 of them traveled the 35 miles
to and from San Francisco to talk it over with
the men who had made good. This year the
program has been greatly expanded and there
will be no repetition of the cases of the 20 men
who were turned away last year because no
one was available in the field requested.
If a man hasn't been contacted in your field,
they'll get you a man.
With the unlimited opportunities available,
the program should more than double its suc
cess of last year.—C. B.
IN this age of specialization, it is more than
ever necessary that a student in college have
definitely in mind what field he plans to enter.
It has been the self-assumed function of the
Men's Vocational Guidance Committee, under
the direction of Assistant Dean of Men Stanley
Sharp, to help students in every way possible to
make their decisions and to make them wisely.
This years program started fall quarter with
a concerted and highly successful drive to "sell
the students" on the Strong "Vocational Interest
Test," and during winter quarter consisted of a
well-attended series of Monday evening talks

tional fields.
