# Bust in T-Party
## 
### 
YESTERDAY afternoon Coach Shaughnessy
held the first of Stanford's spring practice
sessions. And many of the guests invited to this
T-party failed to appear. The host did not have
much to say about the absences, but obviously
the party was not the howling success it might
have been.
The invited guests were the able-bodied men
of the Farm. Just a few days ago Coach Clark
made it known to the Campus that working
with him was a coaching staff sufficient to
handle almost 300 men during these coming
spring sessions. Neither hulking size nor pre
vious experience was a prerequisite for enter
ing through the gold-gilt gates of gridiron great
ness.
Three hundred were invited. Eighty-one ap
peared.
And while it must be admitted that, for Stan
ford, 81 is something of a record for a spring
practice turnout, nevertheless the ranks are far
from filled. And remember too that Coach
Shaughnessy's call for many men does not come
because he believes that numerical might will
make him right in the Pacific Coast standings
at the end of next fall's season.
His view reaches beyond next year, and the
year after that. Looking back, he has seen the
lean football years that have come before. Look
ing ahead, he hopes to get enough Stanford
men interested in football, either varsity or
lightweight teams, to provide for the lean foot
ball years to come.
No one university can win the Pacific Coast

Conference title forever. And when the lean
years come, Coach Shaughnessy wants Stan
ford well populated with men who will say,
"Football is a swell game. I play it myself. Let's
see what we can do about bringing back the
years of plenty."â€”B. A.
