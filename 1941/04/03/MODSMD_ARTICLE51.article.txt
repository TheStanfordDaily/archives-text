# Standing Room Only?
## 
### 
ALL 10 o'clock classes will be dismissed this
morning in order that students may attend
an all-University assembly in Memorial Hall at
which Thomas Mann, winner of the 1929 Nobel
prize for literature, will be the speaker.
And my way of a word of warning, you stu
dents might bring along your student body
cards. Although the Public Exercises Committee
has made no such stipulation as yet, they may
decide at the last minute that such a check is
needed if Stanford students are to find enough
seats left vacant by the Palo Alto townsfolk.
And by way of a bit of pre-optimism, not self
ishness, let us hope that they do decide to see
that all Stanford students will have seats at this
assembly.â€”B. A.
