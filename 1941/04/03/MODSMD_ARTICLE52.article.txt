# BULL SESSION
## THE 						'WAR-MONGER' 
### JERRY MAYER 
''WAR-MONGER" speaks at Stanford today! It
makes no difference that he is Thomas Mann,
one of the greatest contemporary figures of interna
tional literature, that he is a Nobel Prize winner, that
his works have been translated into almost every
language.
He has said that "democracy can bear off the as
saults of the dictatorships by a militant rediscovery
of itself." He is therefore a "fake idealist." (Phrase
used by a former Daily editor to describe "war
mongers".)
In these days of growing crisis, there is a tendency
among many persons to condemn any indictment of
Naziism as propaganda and "war-mongering." Seldom
is it remembered that the word "propaganda" means
nothing more than the "dissemination and the defense
of beliefs and opinions." Propaganda, therefore, works
both ways, on either side of a given question. Too
often we think of it merely as undesirable information
on behalf of the opposing side of a proposition. Thomas
Mann is a propagandist, definitely.
He is a man who, at the age of 61, left his own
country, the country he had been born and reared
in, the country that was the birthplace of his two
children, and came to the United States. He did not
leave Germany because of his religious affiliation—he
is neither a Jew nor a Catholic—nor did he become
a refugee because of any ingrained political convic
tion. He is a victim of the Nazi system of intellectual
censorship.

r I" , HOMAS MANN, author of such fine works as
"Magic Mountain," "The Beloved Returns," "Bud
denbrooks" (which won the Nobel Prize), and the Jo
seph biblical series, is a man whose mind cannot be
caged by an all-out philosophy of government. Rather
than compromise his writings and his intellectual in
tegrity, Thomas Mann fled from the country that he
could no longer call his own. His books were burned
in public squares, his name that had brought so much
credit to Germany was reviled.
Mann's dislike for the Germany of today, the Ger
many that he knows but cannot understand in the
light of the former Germany, is apparent in his book,
"The Coming Victory of Democracy." Today Stanford
will have the opportunity to hear this great intellec
tual describe the advantages of our way of life.
There will be much for Stanford to learn, provided
Stanford's minds arc open to such learning. A Stanford
student of my acquaintance was thumbing through
"School for Barbarians," a book concerning Nazi edu
cational methods by Erika Mann, brilliant daughter of
the famous author. "Propaganda," he snorted.
Which, of course, was true. Everything that a vital
person does—or writes —is propaganda. Dorothy
Thompson has said that the person who is absolutely
neutral —is dead. Thomas Mann has something to say
that be believes should be said. The fact that he is one
of the world's finest writers, a man with a keen mind,
a cultured intellect, and an international conscience
makes what he has to say exceptionally valuable.
You may not agree with him, but to shrug him off
as a blind propagandist for democracy is inexcusable.
Merely to hear such a man—no matter what his
topic—is a privilege. To call him a "fake idealist" is
sheer sophism.

makes no difference that he is Thomas Mann,
one of the greatest contemporary figures of interna
tional literature, that he is a Nobel Prize winner, that
his works have been translated into almost every
language.
He has said that "democracy can bear off the as
saults of the dictatorships by a militant rediscovery
of itself." He is therefore a "fake idealist." (Phrase
used by a former Daily editor to describe "war
mongers".)
In these days of growing crisis, there is a tendency
among many persons to condemn any indictment of
Naziism as propaganda and "war-mongering." Seldom
is it remembered that the word "propaganda" means
nothing more than the "dissemination and the defense
of beliefs and opinions." Propaganda, therefore, works
both ways, on either side of a given question. Too
often we think of it merely as undesirable information
on behalf of the opposing side of a proposition. Thomas
Mann is a propagandist, definitely.
He is a man who, at the age of 61, left his own
country, the country he had been born and reared
in, the country that was the birthplace of his two
children, and came to the United States. He did not
leave Germany because of his religious affiliation—he
is neither a Jew nor a Catholic—nor did he become
a refugee because of any ingrained political convic
tion. He is a victim of the Nazi system of intellectual
censorship.

r I" , HOMAS MANN, author of such fine works as
"Magic Mountain," "The Beloved Returns," "Bud
denbrooks" (which won the Nobel Prize), and the Jo
seph biblical series, is a man whose mind cannot be
caged by an all-out philosophy of government. Rather
than compromise his writings and his intellectual in
tegrity, Thomas Mann fled from the country that he
could no longer call his own. His books were burned
in public squares, his name that had brought so much
credit to Germany was reviled.
Mann's dislike for the Germany of today, the Ger
many that he knows but cannot understand in the
light of the former Germany, is apparent in his book,
"The Coming Victory of Democracy." Today Stanford
will have the opportunity to hear this great intellec
tual describe the advantages of our way of life.
There will be much for Stanford to learn, provided
Stanford's minds arc open to such learning. A Stanford
student of my acquaintance was thumbing through
"School for Barbarians," a book concerning Nazi edu
cational methods by Erika Mann, brilliant daughter of
the famous author. "Propaganda," he snorted.
Which, of course, was true. Everything that a vital
person does—or writes —is propaganda. Dorothy
Thompson has said that the person who is absolutely
neutral —is dead. Thomas Mann has something to say
that be believes should be said. The fact that he is one
of the world's finest writers, a man with a keen mind,
a cultured intellect, and an international conscience
makes what he has to say exceptionally valuable.
You may not agree with him, but to shrug him off
as a blind propagandist for democracy is inexcusable.
Merely to hear such a man—no matter what his
topic—is a privilege. To call him a "fake idealist" is
sheer sophism.
