# CAMPUS OPINION
## MELODY MEDITATION 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
May a mere listener, possessing only the qualifi
cation of having been a concert listener for some thirty
years in this and other countries, express a candid
opinion and puzzlement on the subject of the chimes
now being sounded from the Hoover tower?
Ever since composers began to write music, the
best of them always wrote each piece with a specific
designation as to the instrument which was to repro
duce the work of his brain for listeners: organ, choir,
single voice, harpsichord, violin, xylophone, or an or
chestra of several different instruments. Why did com
posers do that? Because the best, most expressive
pieces of music can be truly expressed only on one or
not much more than one instrument of ensemble of
instruments. One who knows, for instance, the charm
of Grieg's '"Nocturne" and has recently heard it ren
dered in the stereotyped radio orchestration, will prob
ably agree with me that it should be played on the
piano only, for which it was written.
Chimes are no exception. Melodies, particularly
melodies with modulations of keys, melodies that are
built for voice or a voice-like instrument, cannot be
reproduced in chimes. The main characteristic of
chimes is the prevalence in them of overtones to an
extent which defies and makes impossible purity of
tone. Bells and chimes are not made to have pure
tones. They are made for such music as will not suffer
from disharmonious overtones hanging in the air long
after the melody has wandered forward. This morn
ing's "Jcanie with the Light Brown Hair" was a dis
tressing revelation, following as it did a splendid pas
sage, whether improvised or not doesn't matter, by
which the carilloneur began his little concert and
which did sound like chime music made for chimes.
Why not look into Rimsky Korsakov's "Russian Eas
ter' and Musorgsky's "Great Gates of Kiev"—l hope
the names are near enough exact —where these two
composers imitated somewhat successfully the inimi
table play of Russian church bells? Why not give us
the best that these perfect chimes can give? They
seem to be perfect, and when single sounds are heard,
without an attempt at melody, they sound like truly
angelic voices. These chimes are a perfect, and a won
derful instrument and musical violence should not be
perpetrated on them.
