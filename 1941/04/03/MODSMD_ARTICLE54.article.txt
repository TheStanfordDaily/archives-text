# 'Miss Bishop' Good For Nice Quiet Evening
## 
### 
United Artsists' "Cheers for Miss
Bishop," now playing in San Fran
cisco.
"Cheers for Miss Bishop'" is the
feminine version of "Mr. Chips."
Martha Scott of "Our Town" fame
plays a girl who attends a small
midwestern university in its early
days, graduates with honors, and
from there on in devotes her life to
tho profession of teaching.
This devotion triumphs over all
else and Miss Scott travels through
the years to a gracious old age,
spurning all else, including mar
riage. True, there are men in her
Ifie, but, by hook or by crook, she
manages to lose them.
FAITHFUL LOVE
Sam Peters, played by William
Gargan, remains faithful to the end.
The first love is Delbert Thompson,
who is copped by the younger sister.
The next is John Stevens, a col
league at Midwestern University,
who unfortunately has a wife in
Virginia and Ella Bishop's love for
her career stops her from travelling
to Italy with him.
HAPPY ENDING
Again, the happy ending reigns
supreme and Miss Bishop receives
honors from her university, which
has become great and at which she
has spent 51 years of her life.
"Cheers for Miss Bishop" is a trifle
dull in spots in spite of the authen
ticity, but there are many vivid
passages punctuated with some
good humor. These coupled with
the excellent acting make the movie
"good." It is very well worth seeing
for on evening of nice, quiet enter
tainment. —Deane
