### Jean Nowell 
r pHE Army of the Nile announced
yesterday that it had pulled out
of Benghazi. Diehard Anglophiles
may choose to accept the explana
tion in the British communique
which stated that "our light cover
ing detachments have now with
drawn to selected concent rated areas
to choose our own battleground";
but it is more probable that Ben
ghazi was getting too hot to handle.
Situated at the eastern side of the
Gulf of Sidra, rather near the site
of ancient Carthage, Benghazi was
the capital of eastern Libya and a
military prize worth keeping. Of
course, it is possible that the British
felt it wasn't worth the price they'd
have to pay to keep it. Certainly
the Tommies, particularly Anzacs,
can put up as tough a fight as any
set of men now living—when they
feel it's necessary.
Hut the point is this: the Brit
ish gave up a city of some 60,000
people, a strategic naval and air
base, and are now 170 miles far
ther away from Tripoli than they
were last week. Few military ex
perts. however, had expected the
English to drive on to Tripoli after
their shattering victories over the
Italian army.
In the first place, such a move did
not seem too nccessary—the Italian
army was very nearly out of com
mission anyway; and in the second
place, the desert between Benghazi
and Tripoli is a difficult one to tra
verse. The British are never ones to
string their communication lines too
long or thin.

B"T. the Germans are fighting in
Libya now, and Nazi soldiers are
made out of tougher stuff than the
Italians. Some sources believe that
last week's naval battle between the
British Mediterranean fleet and the
Italians, in which the Italians defi
nitely did not live up to the an
cestral Roman tradition, was delib
erately planned by the Germans as
a decoy.
These sources think that while
the British fleet was occupied
elsewhere, thousands of Nazi
troops and huge supplies of mech
anized equipment were rushed
from Sicily to Tripoli. Still oper
ating on the decoy theory, the
same sources claim that the re
newed action in Libya is being
definitely planned to prevent Gen
eral Wavell from sending more of
his seasoned African troops into
Greece.
At any rate, Wavell should soon
have most of his "dark African"
campaigners at liberty for bigger
and better things. The Italians al
ready seem to have shot their deci
sive bolt during the gallant siege of
Cheren.

r |' , HE lights went out in another
corner of the world yesterday as
the major cities of Yugoslavia un
derwent their first blackout. It will
probably be a long time before the
Yugoslavs know the pleasure of a
friendly street-light again, since
war with Germany seemed to be
drawing nearer by the hour. That
the three capital cities Belgrade,
Zagreb, and Ljubljana were de
clared "open" (meaning undefended
from attack) shows that the Yugo
slavs are grimly preparing for the
worst.
The few Germans now remain
ing in Yugoslavia are members of
a skeleton diplomatic staff. All
others have left for safer quarters.
Incidentally, the departure of the
Germans was quite an exodus,
since the German "tourist" trade
bad boomed tremendously during
the latest Balkan squeeze play.
Strangely enough, the German
controlled press was mum on the
Yugoslav problem yesterday, though
it carried streamers on a reported
British expeditionary force of 350,-
000 troops on the north borders of
Greece. This silence may simply be
preparation for a violent propa
gandist. blast at the little Balkan
country. No one knows, except
Hitler.

ghazi was getting too hot to handle.
Situated at the eastern side of the
Gulf of Sidra, rather near the site
of ancient Carthage, Benghazi was
the capital of eastern Libya and a
military prize worth keeping. Of
course, it is possible that the British
felt it wasn't worth the price they'd
have to pay to keep it. Certainly
the Tommies, particularly Anzacs,
can put up as tough a fight as any
set of men now living—when they
feel it's necessary.
Hut the point is this: the Brit
ish gave up a city of some 60,000
people, a strategic naval and air
base, and are now 170 miles far
ther away from Tripoli than they
were last week. Few military ex
perts. however, had expected the
English to drive on to Tripoli after
their shattering victories over the
Italian army.
In the first place, such a move did
not seem too nccessary—the Italian
army was very nearly out of com
mission anyway; and in the second
place, the desert between Benghazi
and Tripoli is a difficult one to tra
verse. The British are never ones to
string their communication lines too

last week's naval battle between the
British Mediterranean fleet and the
Italians, in which the Italians defi

a decoy.

the British fleet was occupied

troops and huge supplies of mech

his seasoned African troops into

At any rate, Wavell should soon

but it is more probable that Ben
ghazi was getting too hot to handle.
Situated at the eastern side of the
Gulf of Sidra, rather near the site
of ancient Carthage, Benghazi was
the capital of eastern Libya and a
military prize worth keeping. Of
course, it is possible that the British
felt it wasn't worth the price they'd
have to pay to keep it. Certainly
the Tommies, particularly Anzacs,
can put up as tough a fight as any
set of men now living—when they
feel it's necessary.
Hut the point is this: the Brit
ish gave up a city of some 60,000
people, a strategic naval and air
base, and are now 170 miles far
ther away from Tripoli than they
were last week. Few military ex
perts. however, had expected the
English to drive on to Tripoli after
their shattering victories over the
Italian army.
In the first place, such a move did
not seem too nccessary—the Italian
army was very nearly out of com
mission anyway; and in the second
place, the desert between Benghazi
and Tripoli is a difficult one to tra
verse. The British are never ones to
string their communication lines too
long or thin.

B"T. the Germans are fighting in
Libya now, and Nazi soldiers are
made out of tougher stuff than the
Italians. Some sources believe that
last week's naval battle between the
British Mediterranean fleet and the
Italians, in which the Italians defi
nitely did not live up to the an
cestral Roman tradition, was delib
erately planned by the Germans as
a decoy.
These sources think that while
the British fleet was occupied
elsewhere, thousands of Nazi
troops and huge supplies of mech
anized equipment were rushed
from Sicily to Tripoli. Still oper
ating on the decoy theory, the
same sources claim that the re
newed action in Libya is being
definitely planned to prevent Gen
eral Wavell from sending more of
his seasoned African troops into
Greece.
At any rate, Wavell should soon
have most of his "dark African"
campaigners at liberty for bigger
and better things. The Italians al
ready seem to have shot their deci
sive bolt during the gallant siege of
Cheren.

r |' , HE lights went out in another
corner of the world yesterday as
the major cities of Yugoslavia un
derwent their first blackout. It will
probably be a long time before the
Yugoslavs know the pleasure of a
friendly street-light again, since
war with Germany seemed to be
drawing nearer by the hour. That
the three capital cities Belgrade,
Zagreb, and Ljubljana were de
clared "open" (meaning undefended
from attack) shows that the Yugo
slavs are grimly preparing for the
worst.
The few Germans now remain
ing in Yugoslavia are members of
a skeleton diplomatic staff. All
others have left for safer quarters.
Incidentally, the departure of the
Germans was quite an exodus,
since the German "tourist" trade
bad boomed tremendously during
the latest Balkan squeeze play.
Strangely enough, the German
controlled press was mum on the
Yugoslav problem yesterday, though
it carried streamers on a reported
British expeditionary force of 350,-
000 troops on the north borders of
Greece. This silence may simply be
preparation for a violent propa
gandist. blast at the little Balkan
country. No one knows, except
Hitler.
Yugoslav anti-aircraft batteries at
Miribor on the northern frontier
with Germany fired on and perhaps
hit a foreign pursuit plane which
crossed the closed and armed border
yesterday. The plane was thought to
be German.
r pHE Army of the Nile announced
yesterday that it had pulled out
of Benghazi. Diehard Anglophiles
may choose to accept the explana
tion in the British communique
which stated that "our light cover
ing detachments have now with
drawn to selected concent rated areas
to choose our own battleground";
