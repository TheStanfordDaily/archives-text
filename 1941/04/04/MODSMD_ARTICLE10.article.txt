Jackson's duties as Encina sponsor
is explaining to hopeful frosh the
fatal fascination of upperelassmen
over Roble women.
"I usually tell them it's a matter
of gray hairs," the Newell scholar
said.
The Henry E. Newell scholarship
fund was founded in 1932 for men
and women of high scholastic
standing and financial need, pref
erably from Utah. Mr. Newell was
a close friend of Senator Stanford.
Jackson has won this scholarship for
three successive years by competi
tive examination.

Studying at Encina is a simple
matter, according to Jackson be
cause "They're quiet boys, outside
of a few fires, firecrackers, and
radios."
Chairmanship of Speakers' Bureau
claims the largest allotments of time
on Jackson's activity schedule. He
thinks this type of public speaking
will be especially valuable to him in
his future law career.
"We talk to Kiwanis Clubs, Ro
tary Clubs, and many other busi
ness and service organizations dur
ing the course of a year," Jackson
said. "I'm very much enthused
about the possibilities of Speakers'
Club because of the practical train
ing it provides for any profession."

experience he gets through Speak
ers' Club, Jackson has also been de
bating ever since his freshman year

Delta Sigma Rho, honorary forensic
society. He started his debate tours
during high school in his home
state, Utah.

about mentioning the fact that I'm
from Utah," Jackson said. "Every
body immediately wants to know
how many wives I have. They don't
seem to know there's a law against
that now."
Jackson is also a member of Jun
ior Ex Committee and Axe Society.

Jackson has won this scholarship for
three successive years by competi

J
Studying at Encina is a simple
matter, according to Jackson be

of a few fires, firecrackers, and
radios."
Chairmanship of Speakers' Bureau
claims the largest allotments of time
on Jackson's activity schedule. He
thinks this type of public speaking
will be especially valuable to him in
his future law career.
"We talk to Kiwanis Clubs, Ro
tary Clubs, and many other busi
ness and service organizations dur
ing the course of a year," Jackson
said. "I'm very much enthused
about the possibilities of Speakers'
Club because of the practical train
ing it provides for any profession."
Not content with the amount of
experience he gets through Speak
ers' Club, Jackson has also been de
bating ever since his freshman year
at Stanford and is now a member of
Delta Sigma Rho, honorary forensic
society. He started his debate tours
during high school in his home
state, Utah.
"You know I'm getting wary
about mentioning the fact that I'm
from Utah," Jackson said. "Every
body immediately wants to know
how many wives I have. They don't
seem to know there's a law against
that now."
Jackson is also a member of Jun
ior Ex Committee and Axe Society.
