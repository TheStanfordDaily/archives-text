# Farm Assembly Hears Mann Propose Combat for Fascism
## 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Advocating a "social democracy to combat the false revolutions of
fascism and communism," Dr. Thomas Mann, noted author and Nobel
Prize winner, boldly blasted the political philosophy of Germany, his
former homeland, beSore an all-University student-faculty assembly
yesterday.

"This social democracy," he ex
plained, "involves a new adjustment
between the demands of the indi
vidual and the demands of society.
The center of gravity has moved
toward the social aspect of democ
racy, away from the individual."
Dr. Mann maintained that the
only real revolution is that of dem
ocracy to be secured by "the re
newal and rejuvenation" of demo
cratic ideals. Hitler, he added, is
only "an out-of-date free-hooter of
revolution." "Unrestrained state
sovereignty" and "the egotism of the
national states" must be sacrificed
toward this end.
PLACE IN THE SUN
"Germany deserves its place in
the sun," Dr. Mann emphasized, "but
a nation does not achieve its place
in the sun by shrouding the world
in night."
He asserted that the present con
flict is "a raging world civil war."
If Germany wins, there will be a
moral disintegration brought about
by "the triumph of evil, the triumph
of brute force in this world," he
claimed.
WARNS OF FIFTH COLUMN
In warning against fifth-column
ists in this country, Dr. Mann
claimed, "A pacifist . . . belongs to
the fifth column, whether he knows
it or not. Open treason and loyalty
to the opposition is not the only in
dication of the fifth columnist."
PSYCHOLOGICAL WEAKNESS
Holding the chief reason for the
eakness of democracy in Germany
was psychological, not political, Dr.
Mann termed Germany today "an
example of a lack of democratic
pragmatism and the dangers of such
an omission."
Germany, in spending 40 billions
for armament, has led Dr. Mann to
believe that bankruptcy is only a
matter of time. TTiis armament,
aimed particularly against England,
is now an example of Germany's
hate of England, which is truthfully
a product of admiration. He claims
that Germany saw England as a
master race, and the Germans nat
urally wanted to replace the Brit
ish. This present move is a "twisted
imitation."
