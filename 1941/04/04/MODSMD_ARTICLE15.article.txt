# Hall, Row Start '41 Campaign
## 
### ROWAN HALL 
With spring elections hovering
only 12 days away, Farm politicos
yesterday and last night fired what
amounted to the opening salvos in
the '41 campaign.
Spurred by reports of united ac
tion in the Halls, Row political ma
chinery began to crystalize last night
in the form of three, and possibly
four, separate engines. Names prom
inently discussed in Row bull ses
sions included Jim Haugh, Delt;
Sandy Tatum, Zete; Bob Breckner,
Alpha Delt; and Frankie Albert,
Deke.
Wtih Breakers' George Jackson
rumored to be the unofficial Hall
choice, Interclub Council put the
final touches on plans to hold a
Tuesday evening caucus to draw up
the final Hall slate. No definite plans
have appeared as yet from the Row.
Last night Toyon and Branner
residents met in separate smokers to
discuss possible candidates for the
various spots on the Hall slate. La
gunita and the Union units report
edly will hold similar meetings in
the near future.
First shot of the spring campaign
was fired Wednesday evening when
a circular was distributed to mem
bers of all halls. Not. an interclub
action, the circular was published
and distributed by an unofficial
committee of Hall men and women
who urged united action on the part
of all Hall residents.
