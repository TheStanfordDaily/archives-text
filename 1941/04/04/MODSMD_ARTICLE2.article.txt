COMPTROLLER'S REPORT
The Comptroller's report, also

versity's total income was $5,168,235,
compared with $5,018,342 in the year
preceding. Total assets amounted
to $47,509,795.60.
"The statement in last year's re
port concerning housemothers for
fraternities provoked considerable
discussion and debate during the
year," Dean Bunn reports. "Several
fraternities have considered the mat
ter very seriously and may decide
o employ housemothers in the near
future. The Dean of Men was in
vited to discuss the plan at a num
oer of houses," he continues.
CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA
"My sincere interest in seeing our
Stanford fraternities assume the
.strongest possible position as or
ganizations which are exerting the
most constructive influence upon
jach of their members and upon the
campus generally led me to suggest
the value and desirability of having
housemothers. My experience with
housemothers in fraternities and my
observation of our local situation
convince me that they would be an
isset to the Stanford chapters."
Dean Bunn lists the advantages of
housemothers as stressing the im
portance of cleanliness, order, and
neatness about the house and of the
reduction of wear and tear on the
curnishings and buildings.
DEFER RUSHING
He further suggests the deferment
of rushing and pledging until late
in winter quarter as an aid to schol
arship.
Development of the Glystron is
