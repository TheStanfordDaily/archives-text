# Tenor Fails To impress Farm Crowd
## Martini Closes 1941 Concert Series With Mediocre Program 
### 
Nino Martini is a fortunate young
man—he has the reputation of being
the "handsomest tenor on the con
eert stage"; he possesses an excel
lent physique; and he is supported
by a capable accompanist. He might
be one of the great contemporary
tenors if he only had the voice.
Mr. Martini can sing, yes; his
voice shows unmistakable signs of
training. But it's the sort of voice
that is at its best in simple melodious
songs. It can't quite cope with more
demanding operatic arias.
The program was chosen wisely.
Only three of the numbers could be
described as "heavy." Of these two
were so obsolete that they were un
familiar to most of the audience.
The other, "Una furtiva lagrima"
from L'Elisir d'Amore, is an unde
manding sort of number which
most garden variety tenors can han
dle adequately. By choosing this
sort of program Mr. Martini avoids
comparison with other well known
singers.
LIGHTER SONGS
He did nicely enough on the
lighter songs—he has a certain effi
ciency of rendition, and his voice is
pleasant. He also keeps on pitch.
Once these qualities have been listed
Mr. Martini's vocal abilities have
been pretty well inventoried.
However, perhaps this reviewer
was not in the proper frame of mind,
having just finished listening to Bing
Crosby. Did you hear that super
Crosby arrangement of "Georgia"?
MARTINI ATTRACTIVE
However, Mr. Martini probably is
quite attractive in motion pictures—
with a story and a couple of good
looking leading ladies for diversion,
his singing could be enjoyed. What
he needs in his concerts is a couple
of good comedians to liven up the
show.
Last night the Concert Scries
audience was presented with an
evening of music, and the privilege
of looking at a sartorially elegant
tenor. That man must have a good
tailor.—Douglas
