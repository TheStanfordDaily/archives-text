# Termite Armies Blitzkrieg Daily

"Shut the door, they're coming
through the window, shut the win
dow, they're coming through the
door!" This was the plaintive wail
of Frank Bush, business manager of
j The Daily, when he discovered his
' advertising mats swarming with
hordes of termites last night.
It seems that over vacation the
j little termites found little holes in
the floor of the Daily shack.
The little termites promptly came
in the little holes and the first thing
j they discovered were the business
staff cabinets full of advertising
i matsâ€”mats made of wood pulp. The
little termites started chewing and
breeding, and it was only the dis
covery of the advertising mats
crawling around the shack's floor
which brought the termite plot to
light.
