# Students Asked To Avoid Road Repair Zones
## Lanterns, Barriers Mark Danger Areas In Construction Area 
### 
A warning to students to be more
careful of the obstructions in campus
roads and paths caused by the re
paving and planting work being
done was voiced yesterday by James
W. McDonnell, Corporation Yard
head.
"We put up warnings and barriers
where there is danger of accidents,
but if students pay no attention to
them we can't be responsible for
what happens," Mr. McDonnell de
clared.
"For instance, it's not only very
muddy but at night very dangerous
to attempt to take the short-cut to
RoTde where we have been planting
new trees. The girls, however, have
been repeatedly going around or
jumping over the barriers.
"Also, drivers should slow down
when they come to the humps in
the highways caused by the con
struction work. All these tempo
rary bumps are marked well."
The question came to a head the
night before last when a woman
student came close to having a se
rious accident by tripping over an
iron grill in the construction zone
in front of the Daily shack. In this
case the workmen admitted that the
obstruction was not well enough
marked off.
"We are going to put forth addi
tional attempts to mark these dan
ger zones with barriers and red
lanterns, but it would help a lot if
the students would co-operate by
avoiding these zones altogether," Mr.
McDonnell remarked.
