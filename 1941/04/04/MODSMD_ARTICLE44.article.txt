# Reports Confirm Favorable Skiing
## 
### 
Stanford skiers should have fun
(his week-end with good spring
snow conditions on most slopes and
"good skiing" reports coming in from
all points.
Road conditions to Badger Pass
and Sugar Bowl have been termed
as being passable but drivers are
urged to use chains and to check at
all stations as to conditions.
The snowpack at Badger is eighty
inches which should provide the
needed snow for the inter-club meet
which will be held tomorrow. There
will be competition in downhill and
slalom events.
