# Senior Drive Heads Named
## 60 Students to Work For Members, Funds 
### 
Sixty seniors will reach every
member of Stanford's fiftieth class
next week when the fifth annual
Senior Fund Appeal and Alumni
Membership Drive gets under way,
Art Gore, president of the class of
'41, said yesterday.
Rosamond Upson and Dwight
Hutchinson were named co-chair
men of the 1941 appeal by Gore.
They will pick a committee list from
the card file and meet with the GO
solicitors on Monday night at 8
o'clock, they said.
The drive serves a double pur
pose, according to the chairmen. It
enlists outgoing seniors in the Alum
ni Association, offering them a year's
membership at half price. And, in
addition, it affords senior men and
women, members of the Farm's fif
tieth class, an opportunity to assist
the University in a financial way.
"Inasmuch as this is Stanford's
'fifty-year' class, we feel that seniors
will wish to join the association and
will be more than happy to con
tribute something—no matter how
little—to the University's future,"
Rosamond Upson said yesterday.
Last year's Senior Fund chairmen
were Dorothy Champion and Stan
Swafford, while Jack Laney and
George Dietz headed the appeal in
the previous two years.
