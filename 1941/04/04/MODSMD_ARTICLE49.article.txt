# Indians Face Cal's 'Jinx' Koll
## Two Teams Clash Here Tomorrow 
### 
Bear and Indian square off to
morrow as the annual Big Game
baseball series gets under way on
Sunken Diamond at 3:30 o'clock.
California's "jinx" pitcher, Mike
Koll, who set the Cards down three
straight last year, is slated to op
pose veteran Cootie Thompson on
the mound.
Threatening skies yesterday forced
cancellation of the scheduled St.
Mary's-Indian tilt, and the game
was set up to April 14. As a result
of the 6-4 licking handed California
by the Gaels Wednesday, Stanford
moves into a second-place deadlock
With the Berkeleyites.
A fast-drying field gave the In
dians a good batting workout yes
terday, and the same goes for this
itfternoon, if the weather remains
t Jerable.
LEAKS HAVE POWER
The Bears have tremendous power
si. the plate in the form of their big
buckstopper, Carl Hoberg, who
s:ummed out two for four against
Santa Clara as the Californians out
h.t El Bronco, 15-11, two weeks ago,
Hoberg bats in the clean-up spot.
Ed Ongerth does the leading lady
act for the Bears, nabbed two safe
ties in three attempts against Santa
Clara, and scored three runs. Stan
Griffith, third-sacker, next in the
butting order, got two for four
against the 'Clarans, and Jack Al
fa ight, shortstop, smashed out a
homer with two aboard.
KOLL GREAT
Mike Koll, Cal's top mound artist,
knocked over Stanford three straight
last season, and already this year
h; s a two-hitter to his credit against
S,;nta Clara back on March 12. The
big boy unwinds from the port side
ai.d has a puzzling assortment of
offerings for the Indians to play
w.th.
If Koll should get into trouble,
Freddy Kirtlan will be next in line
for throwing. Kirtlan started out
like a house afire against the Gaels
Wednesday but grew wilder as the
g; me progressed, and a couple of
errors in the infield made it a total
loss as the bears were beaten, 6-4.
CARDS HOT AND COLD
On Stanford's side of the ledger,
anything can happen. If the Indians
turn in a repeat performance of the
type of ball they played against
U.C.L.A., the Californians and Mike
Koll will have plenty of trouble on
tl eir hands when the two teams
fice off.
Next Wednesday the league-lead

d >üble-header, first game starting
ai. 1:15. Claude Purkitt and Thomp

the Indians, while Ed Vitalich, Troy's

Bear and Indian square off to
morrow as the annual Big Game
baseball series gets under way on
Sunken Diamond at 3:30 o'clock.
California's "jinx" pitcher, Mike
Koll, who set the Cards down three
straight last year, is slated to op
pose veteran Cootie Thompson on
the mound.
Threatening skies yesterday forced
cancellation of the scheduled St.
Mary's-Indian tilt, and the game
was set up to April 14. As a result
of the 6-4 licking handed California
by the Gaels Wednesday, Stanford
moves into a second-place deadlock
With the Berkeleyites.
A fast-drying field gave the In
dians a good batting workout yes
terday, and the same goes for this
itfternoon, if the weather remains
t Jerable.
LEAKS HAVE POWER
The Bears have tremendous power
si. the plate in the form of their big
buckstopper, Carl Hoberg, who
s:ummed out two for four against
Santa Clara as the Californians out
h.t El Bronco, 15-11, two weeks ago,
Hoberg bats in the clean-up spot.
Ed Ongerth does the leading lady
act for the Bears, nabbed two safe
ties in three attempts against Santa
Clara, and scored three runs. Stan
Griffith, third-sacker, next in the
butting order, got two for four
against the 'Clarans, and Jack Al
fa ight, shortstop, smashed out a
homer with two aboard.
KOLL GREAT
Mike Koll, Cal's top mound artist,
knocked over Stanford three straight
last season, and already this year
h; s a two-hitter to his credit against
S,;nta Clara back on March 12. The
big boy unwinds from the port side
ai.d has a puzzling assortment of
offerings for the Indians to play
w.th.
If Koll should get into trouble,
Freddy Kirtlan will be next in line
for throwing. Kirtlan started out
like a house afire against the Gaels
Wednesday but grew wilder as the
g; me progressed, and a couple of
errors in the infield made it a total
loss as the bears were beaten, 6-4.
CARDS HOT AND COLD
On Stanford's side of the ledger,
anything can happen. If the Indians
turn in a repeat performance of the
type of ball they played against
U.C.L.A., the Californians and Mike
Koll will have plenty of trouble on
tl eir hands when the two teams
fice off.
Next Wednesday the league-lead
ii g Southern California Trojans
invade Sunken Diamond for a
d >üble-header, first game starting
ai. 1:15. Claude Purkitt and Thomp
son will get the pitching chores for
the Indians, while Ed Vitalich, Troy's
