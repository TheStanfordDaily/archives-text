# Trackmen Host San Jose State
## 
### 
Looking for a track victory be
fore the competition gets too tough,
Stanford's Indians face an, unknown
quantity in the San Jose Spartans
tomorrow afternoon at Angell Field.
Pitch Johnson will . probably be
without the services of Captain Ernie
Clark, capable of 48 flat and prob
ably the Indians' best middle-dis
tance man. Clark is working out a
pulled muscle and won't be ready
to go this week.
Also on the cripple list is Francis
Olson, half-miler, who is laid up
with boils. In the absence of these
two stars, Kai Larsen, Burm Skrable,
and Blair Hyde will handle the mid
dle - distance assignments. Larsen
has been out for track just a little
over a month and has already turned
in a 1:55 half. Skrable is a member
of two record-holding teanat>. He
ran with Hyde and Olson for San
Mateo J.C. when the Bulldogs set a
new junior college record in the
l'our-rnan two-mile, and he was
also a member of Stanford's record
breaking two-mile team last year.
Hyde is one of the few returning
veterans from the championship 1940
squad.
Jim Lincoln, who was out last
quarter with scholastic difficulties,
is in poor shape and will have to
| fight for points in the high jump
I with Roger Romines of San Jose,
Ed Voss and Vern Hart.
One of the big come-through jobs
; of the year is Emerson Hiler's con-
I sistency in the discus. Last season,
lliler tossed over 150 feet in prac
tice day after day, but tied up in
j the meets. With the graduation of
Arn Cornett and Stan Anderson,
; Hiler has settled down, flipping the
! platter out 155 feet in the first meet
of the year against Cal two weeks
| ago, and is showing signs of im
| provement and more consistency
i right along. He will be a heavy
favorite in his pet event tomorrow.
Neither San Jose nor Stanford is
| gifted with an outstanding sprinter.
Jim Kerr of the Spartans has a top
j mark of 22.5 for the 220. With Ken
[ Battaglia off the squad, Stanford has
a flock of fair dash men, but no one
capable of 9.7. Gene Kern, Roy
But'sch, Don McFarland, Johnny
j Grant, and Bob Olden are ail around
! 10 flat.

Stanford's Indians face an, unknown
quantity in the San Jose Spartans
tomorrow afternoon at Angell Field.
Pitch Johnson will . probably be
without the services of Captain Ernie
Clark, capable of 48 flat and prob
ably the Indians' best middle-dis
tance man. Clark is working out a
pulled muscle and won't be ready
to go this week.
Also on the cripple list is Francis
Olson, half-miler, who is laid up
with boils. In the absence of these
two stars, Kai Larsen, Burm Skrable,
and Blair Hyde will handle the mid
dle - distance assignments. Larsen
has been out for track just a little
over a month and has already turned
in a 1:55 half. Skrable is a member
of two record-holding teanat>. He
ran with Hyde and Olson for San
Mateo J.C. when the Bulldogs set a
new junior college record in the
l'our-rnan two-mile, and he was
also a member of Stanford's record
breaking two-mile team last year.
Hyde is one of the few returning
veterans from the championship 1940
squad.
Jim Lincoln, who was out last
quarter with scholastic difficulties,
is in poor shape and will have to
| fight for points in the high jump
I with Roger Romines of San Jose,
Ed Voss and Vern Hart.
One of the big come-through jobs
; of the year is Emerson Hiler's con-
I sistency in the discus. Last season,
lliler tossed over 150 feet in prac
tice day after day, but tied up in
j the meets. With the graduation of
Arn Cornett and Stan Anderson,
; Hiler has settled down, flipping the
! platter out 155 feet in the first meet
of the year against Cal two weeks
| ago, and is showing signs of im
| provement and more consistency
i right along. He will be a heavy
favorite in his pet event tomorrow.
Neither San Jose nor Stanford is
| gifted with an outstanding sprinter.
Jim Kerr of the Spartans has a top
j mark of 22.5 for the 220. With Ken
[ Battaglia off the squad, Stanford has
a flock of fair dash men, but no one
capable of 9.7. Gene Kern, Roy
But'sch, Don McFarland, Johnny
j Grant, and Bob Olden are ail around
! 10 flat.
Looking for a track victory be
fore the competition gets too tough,
Stanford's Indians face an, unknown
