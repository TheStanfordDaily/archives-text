JUST a few lines about Stanford's
grand old man of athletics—Har
ry Maloney. Today director of the
minor sports program, Mr. Maloney
has been connected with athletics
on the Farm for a period of 30 years.
Harry Maloney is teaching his
second generation of Stanford men
primarily sportsmanship, courage;
and cleanliness and, secondarily,
how to play soccer and rugby.
Many present Stanford athletes
have fathers who were 25 and 30
years ago exposed to this same
unselfish desire to build Stanford
manhood.
For the twenty-second consecutive
year Maloney is conducting his so
called boys' classes. With the satis
faction he gets out of seeing boys
build their minds and bodies through
exercise and competition as his only
compensation, Maloney instructs
Palo Alto grammar school and jun
ior high school boys in swimming
and gymnastics every Saturday
morning.
An example of Maloney's popu
larity with the present generation is
the surprising number of prospects
which signed up for spring soccer.
A total of G7, only 14 less than ap
peared for football when Coach
Clark Shaughnessy gave the call
Wednesday, have registered . for
spring soccer.
And the flood of prospects was
too great for the store of soccer
equipment to handle. But Stanford
men want to play soccer under
Harry Maloney and are going out
to buy their equipment.
* * *
JF THE weather only clears, the
Farm will have an awful full
sports program this coming week
end. The varsity baseballers meet
Cal in the Sunken Diamond tomor
row at 3:30 o'clock in the only event
which will charge admission. The
frosh nine tackle Menlo Junior Col
lege today and the Cal frosh tomor
row. •
Another event will be the track
team's second appearance of the sea
son in a meet with San Jose State
on Angell Field tomorrow afternoon
at 2 o'clock. In the morning the
freshmen tracksters will face a con
tingent of Contra Costa County All-
Stars at 10.
This afternoon, the varsity
swimming team entertains the
also undefeated paddlers from
U.C.L.A. The frosh swimmers
meet Stockton Junior College Sat
urday afternoon.
To round out activities the frosh
tennis team meets Martinez Tennis
Club at 2 tomorrow afternoon and
the freshman golfers have matches
with Lowell High the same day.
Both varsity tennis and golf teams
are in the south facing both U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. on Friday and Saturday.
* * :!«
£T WOULD keep a guy awful busy
covering all these events but he
would see a lot of top-notch ath
letes in action. For instance, he
would see the two best pitchers in
the coast conference in what prom
ises to be a real pitchers' battle
Saturday. I mean Mike Koll of
California and "Cootie" Thompson
of the Indians.
He would see a vastly improved
440-yard free-stylist in the swim
ming meet with U.C.L.A. Friday.
I mean Doc Colyear, who during
spring vacation cut his time down so
much that he seems headed for a
coast conference crown in this event.
Then there is Stanford's trio of
speedy 880-yard men who will be
performing out on Angell Field
Saturday afternoon — Kai Larsen,
who came from nowhere to ramble
the half mile in 1:55 against Cali
fornia in the relays; Francis Ol
son, who will remind him a lot of
the great Paul Moore, and the de
pendable Blair Hyde.
A survey in 1937 declared that the
meat used in meals in Eneina is the
same as that used in class A hotels
in San Francisco.

£T WOULD keep a guy awful busy
covering all these events but he
would see a lot of top-notch ath
letes in action. For instance, he
would see the two best pitchers in
the coast conference in what prom
ises to be a real pitchers' battle
Saturday. I mean Mike Koll of
California and "Cootie" Thompson
of the Indians.
He would see a vastly improved
440-yard free-stylist in the swim
ming meet with U.C.L.A. Friday.
I mean Doc Colyear, who during
spring vacation cut his time down so
much that he seems headed for a
coast conference crown in this event.
Then there is Stanford's trio of
speedy 880-yard men who will be
performing out on Angell Field
Saturday afternoon — Kai Larsen,
who came from nowhere to ramble
the half mile in 1:55 against Cali
fornia in the relays; Francis Ol
son, who will remind him a lot of
the great Paul Moore, and the de
pendable Blair Hyde.

meat used in meals in Eneina is the

JUST a few lines about Stanford's
grand old man of athletics—Har
ry Maloney. Today director of the
minor sports program, Mr. Maloney
has been connected with athletics
on the Farm for a period of 30 years.
Harry Maloney is teaching his
second generation of Stanford men
primarily sportsmanship, courage;
and cleanliness and, secondarily,
how to play soccer and rugby.
Many present Stanford athletes
have fathers who were 25 and 30
years ago exposed to this same
unselfish desire to build Stanford
manhood.
For the twenty-second consecutive
year Maloney is conducting his so
called boys' classes. With the satis
faction he gets out of seeing boys
build their minds and bodies through
exercise and competition as his only
compensation, Maloney instructs
Palo Alto grammar school and jun
ior high school boys in swimming
and gymnastics every Saturday
morning.
An example of Maloney's popu
larity with the present generation is
the surprising number of prospects
which signed up for spring soccer.
A total of G7, only 14 less than ap
peared for football when Coach
Clark Shaughnessy gave the call
Wednesday, have registered . for
spring soccer.
And the flood of prospects was
too great for the store of soccer
equipment to handle. But Stanford
men want to play soccer under
Harry Maloney and are going out
to buy their equipment.

frosh nine tackle Menlo Junior Col
lege today and the Cal frosh tomor

grand old man of athletics—Har
ry Maloney. Today director of the
minor sports program, Mr. Maloney
has been connected with athletics
on the Farm for a period of 30 years.
Harry Maloney is teaching his
second generation of Stanford men
primarily sportsmanship, courage;
and cleanliness and, secondarily,
how to play soccer and rugby.
Many present Stanford athletes
have fathers who were 25 and 30
years ago exposed to this same
unselfish desire to build Stanford
manhood.
For the twenty-second consecutive
year Maloney is conducting his so
called boys' classes. With the satis
faction he gets out of seeing boys
build their minds and bodies through
exercise and competition as his only
compensation, Maloney instructs
Palo Alto grammar school and jun
ior high school boys in swimming
and gymnastics every Saturday
morning.
An example of Maloney's popu
larity with the present generation is
the surprising number of prospects
which signed up for spring soccer.
A total of G7, only 14 less than ap
peared for football when Coach
Clark Shaughnessy gave the call
Wednesday, have registered . for
spring soccer.
And the flood of prospects was
too great for the store of soccer
equipment to handle. But Stanford
men want to play soccer under
Harry Maloney and are going out
to buy their equipment.

JF THE weather only clears, the
Farm will have an awful full
sports program this coming week
end. The varsity baseballers meet
Cal in the Sunken Diamond tomor
row at 3:30 o'clock in the only event
which will charge admission. The
frosh nine tackle Menlo Junior Col
lege today and the Cal frosh tomor
row. •
Another event will be the track
team's second appearance of the sea
son in a meet with San Jose State
on Angell Field tomorrow afternoon
at 2 o'clock. In the morning the
freshmen tracksters will face a con
tingent of Contra Costa County All-
Stars at 10.
This afternoon, the varsity
swimming team entertains the
also undefeated paddlers from
U.C.L.A. The frosh swimmers
meet Stockton Junior College Sat
urday afternoon.
To round out activities the frosh
tennis team meets Martinez Tennis
Club at 2 tomorrow afternoon and
the freshman golfers have matches
with Lowell High the same day.
Both varsity tennis and golf teams
are in the south facing both U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. on Friday and Saturday.

£T WOULD keep a guy awful busy
covering all these events but he
would see a lot of top-notch ath
letes in action. For instance, he
would see the two best pitchers in
the coast conference in what prom
ises to be a real pitchers' battle
Saturday. I mean Mike Koll of
California and "Cootie" Thompson
of the Indians.
He would see a vastly improved
440-yard free-stylist in the swim
ming meet with U.C.L.A. Friday.
I mean Doc Colyear, who during
spring vacation cut his time down so
much that he seems headed for a
coast conference crown in this event.
Then there is Stanford's trio of
speedy 880-yard men who will be
performing out on Angell Field
Saturday afternoon — Kai Larsen,
who came from nowhere to ramble
the half mile in 1:55 against Cali
fornia in the relays; Francis Ol
son, who will remind him a lot of
the great Paul Moore, and the de
pendable Blair Hyde.
A survey in 1937 declared that the
meat used in meals in Eneina is the
same as that used in class A hotels
in San Francisco.
