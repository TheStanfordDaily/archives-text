# Freshman Nine To Meet Bears
## 
### 
Out for a double-killing, Stan
ford's frosh nine tangles with Menlo
J. C. today at 3:30 o'clock and to
morrow with their ancient rivals â€”
California, at 9:30 on Sunken Dia
mond.
Yesterday Harry Shipkey's crew
dropped a 2-1 decision to San Mateo
high, in a game that showed the '44
men sadly off form. After starting
off with Ted Nell's homer in the
first inning, the Papoose attack
faded dismally and produced nary a
hit more for the remainder' of the
game.
The Bear frosh downed St. Mary's
Gaelets, 8-5, a week ago and present
one of the best frosh collegiate out
fits in the north. Don Pendergrass
will probably get the starting call
on the mound for the locals, with
Ward Walkup behind the plate.
The only two independent coun
tries in the continent of Africa are
Liberia and Egypt.
