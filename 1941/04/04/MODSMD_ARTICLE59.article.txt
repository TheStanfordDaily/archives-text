# Indian Tennists Travel South
## 
### 
Stanford's promising tennis team
opens its 1941 conference season this
afternoon when they meet U.C.L.A.
on the Bruin courts. The team left
for the South last Wednesday eve
ning for the Bruin and Southern
California matches.
The Indian team, which is the
strongest outfit in recent years,
should have no trouble in winning
their fifth mateh. The Bruins, as in
recent years, have not come up
with much of a team. But the Sat
urday match with Troy should be
another story.
U.S.C. always a power in colle
giate tennis circles boasts of one of
the strongest teams in the nation.
With stars like Ted Olewirie, George
Toley, Bill Reedy, Charles Mattman,
along with a host of others the Tro
jans seem unbeatable, but with a
lew upsets the Indians can come
through.
The Indians were given a lift
when top man Larry Dee cleared up
his scholastic difficulties and was
declared eligible. With Dee back the
Indians have a good chance of win
ning both the number one singles
and doubles matches.
Behind Dee will be Bob Low,
Jimmy Wade, Emery Neale, Tom
Kruger, Jack Gurley, Chuck Hutch
ison, Stan Owen, and A1 Rose in an
undetermined order.
The Stanford freshmen netmen,
led by Bruce Wylie and Emery
Rogers, will meet the Martinez Ten
nis Club on the varsity courts to
morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.
