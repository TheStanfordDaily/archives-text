# Varsity Mermen Face Uclans Today in First P.C.C. Meet
## 
### BOB HANNAH 
Stanford's varsity swimmers staged a last-minute brush-up yesterday
in preparation for today's battle with U.C.L.A. Contrary to report, there
will be no charge for admission lo the meet which begins at 3:30 o clock
this afternoon at the Encina Pools.
Both teams are undefeated this season and both are potentially top

teams in the country. U.C.L.A. has,
never defeated Stanford and this is
the year when they have their best
chance to break the jinx. The Bruins
almost came through last year but
Stanford eased them out for a 38-37
win.
300-yard medley relay: Stanford's
medley relay team of Bill Weeden,
Roy Vitousek and Don Smith is
heavily favored not only to win but
to smash the meet record of 3:OG.£
set in 1938. '
220-yard free style: Stanford's
sophomore "human torpedo," Dor
Colyear, is favored to win the fur
long with Indian A1 Frost and Bruin
Holmes staging a great race for sec
ond place.
50-yard free style: The Bruins'
ace, Captain Bill Kuehne, should win
by himself. Chandler of U.C.L.A.
and Brad Young and Gardner Miller
of Stanford should give the galleries
a thrill in their race for second and
third spot.
Fancy diving: Here the Indians
will miss Howie Adams, great div
ing champion, who is ineligible for
spring swimming. The Indian en
tries, Bill Niccolls, Bob Laverty, or
Bill Card will perform against the
Bruin, Fisher. The outcome of this
event is uncertain and both teams
badly need first place. Adams' loss
is a bitter blow to the Indian hopes
for the rest of the season.
ISO-yard free style: Captain Bill
Kuehne of U.C.L.A. should easily
win this eyent unless versatile Roy
Vitousek should swim for the In
dians, in which case a great race
would occur. Both boys have been
hitting around 54 flat for the century
and are in a class by themselves on
the Coast. However, Vitousek will
probably be needed in the breast
stroke. Should the Indians do bet
ter than expected, however, Vitou
sek may be able to be saved until
the 100. Don Smith and Brad Young
of Stanford will battle Schwaub of
the Bruins for those important sec
ond and third place points.
150-yard backstroke: Co-captain
Bill Weeden and Jim Canning of
Stanford are favored to sweep first
and second in this event. Weeden
should clip the meet record of 1:43.8
in winning all by himself. Canning
will probably be followed closely by
Siegal of U.C.L.A.
200-yard breaststroke: Co-captain
Roy Vitousek, Conference champion
and record-holder in this event,
should have little trouble in de
feating the Conference's number
two man, Dick Reed of U.C.L.A
Using the butterfly stroke, the huge
swimming ace should swim the event
in near record time.
440-yard free style: Doc Colyear
Farm sophomore star, should easily
take a first place in this race. Doc
turned in 5:09 for the quarter in
practicc a week ago and is really
develpoing into a definite threat for
the Conference title in this event. A1
Frost, the lad that's always where
he's needed most, will do his best
to beat Holmes of U.C.L.A. for the |
three second-place points.
4M-yard free style relay: This
event may be the deciding factor in
the meet. The Bruins boast the
greatest relay team in the Confer
ence and are capable of 3:42. The
Indians have turned in 3:42.6 in
practice. However, if Vitousek has
to swim in the grueling 230-yard
breaststroke, the Indians cannot hope
to touch U.C.L.A. with a tired Roy
swimming the anchor lap. If Vitou
sek can be kept out of the breast
stroke without losing the meet, the
two teams should stage one of the
closest relay races ever seen in En
cina pools. The Bruin quartet is
composed of Chandler, Schwaub,
Siegal, and Kuehne. Smith, Vitou
sek, Miller, and Regnolds are sup
posed to swim for the Indians. Mil
ler has been missing from practice
this quarter but showed up Wed
nesday. Regnolds has been ill with
a cold and may not be sufficiently
recovered to swim today. However,
if he can't make it today, versatile
Doc Colyear can fill in. This meet is
Stanford's first Conference tilt.

440-yard free style: Doc Colyear
Farm sophomore star, should easily
take a first place in this race. Doc
turned in 5:09 for the quarter in
practicc a week ago and is really
develpoing into a definite threat for
the Conference title in this event. A1
Frost, the lad that's always where
he's needed most, will do his best
to beat Holmes of U.C.L.A. for the |
three second-place points.
4M-yard free style relay: This
event may be the deciding factor in
the meet. The Bruins boast the
greatest relay team in the Confer
ence and are capable of 3:42. The
Indians have turned in 3:42.6 in
practice. However, if Vitousek has
to swim in the grueling 230-yard
breaststroke, the Indians cannot hope
to touch U.C.L.A. with a tired Roy
swimming the anchor lap. If Vitou
sek can be kept out of the breast
stroke without losing the meet, the
two teams should stage one of the
closest relay races ever seen in En
cina pools. The Bruin quartet is
composed of Chandler, Schwaub,
Siegal, and Kuehne. Smith, Vitou
sek, Miller, and Regnolds are sup
posed to swim for the Indians. Mil
ler has been missing from practice
this quarter but showed up Wed
nesday. Regnolds has been ill with
a cold and may not be sufficiently
recovered to swim today. However,
if he can't make it today, versatile
Doc Colyear can fill in. This meet is
Stanford's first Conference tilt.
Stanford's varsity swimmers staged a last-minute brush-up yesterday
in preparation for today's battle with U.C.L.A. Contrary to report, there
will be no charge for admission lo the meet which begins at 3:30 o clock
this afternoon at the Encina Pools.
Both teams are undefeated this season and both are potentially top

teams in the country. U.C.L.A. has,
never defeated Stanford and this is
the year when they have their best
chance to break the jinx. The Bruins
almost came through last year but
Stanford eased them out for a 38-37
win.
300-yard medley relay: Stanford's
medley relay team of Bill Weeden,
Roy Vitousek and Don Smith is
heavily favored not only to win but
to smash the meet record of 3:OG.£
set in 1938. '
220-yard free style: Stanford's
sophomore "human torpedo," Dor
Colyear, is favored to win the fur
long with Indian A1 Frost and Bruin
Holmes staging a great race for sec
ond place.
50-yard free style: The Bruins'
ace, Captain Bill Kuehne, should win
by himself. Chandler of U.C.L.A.
and Brad Young and Gardner Miller
of Stanford should give the galleries
a thrill in their race for second and
third spot.
Fancy diving: Here the Indians
will miss Howie Adams, great div
ing champion, who is ineligible for
spring swimming. The Indian en
tries, Bill Niccolls, Bob Laverty, or
Bill Card will perform against the
Bruin, Fisher. The outcome of this
event is uncertain and both teams
badly need first place. Adams' loss
is a bitter blow to the Indian hopes
for the rest of the season.
ISO-yard free style: Captain Bill
Kuehne of U.C.L.A. should easily
win this eyent unless versatile Roy
Vitousek should swim for the In
dians, in which case a great race
would occur. Both boys have been
hitting around 54 flat for the century
and are in a class by themselves on
the Coast. However, Vitousek will
probably be needed in the breast
stroke. Should the Indians do bet
ter than expected, however, Vitou
sek may be able to be saved until
the 100. Don Smith and Brad Young
of Stanford will battle Schwaub of
the Bruins for those important sec
ond and third place points.
150-yard backstroke: Co-captain
Bill Weeden and Jim Canning of
Stanford are favored to sweep first
and second in this event. Weeden
should clip the meet record of 1:43.8
in winning all by himself. Canning
will probably be followed closely by
Siegal of U.C.L.A.
200-yard breaststroke: Co-captain
Roy Vitousek, Conference champion
and record-holder in this event,
should have little trouble in de
feating the Conference's number
two man, Dick Reed of U.C.L.A
Using the butterfly stroke, the huge
swimming ace should swim the event
in near record time.

Bruin, Fisher. The outcome of this
event is uncertain and both teams
badly need first place. Adams' loss
is a bitter blow to the Indian hopes
for the rest of the season.
ISO-yard free style: Captain Bill
Kuehne of U.C.L.A. should easily
win this eyent unless versatile Roy
Vitousek should swim for the In
dians, in which case a great race
would occur. Both boys have been
hitting around 54 flat for the century
and are in a class by themselves on
the Coast. However, Vitousek will
probably be needed in the breast
stroke. Should the Indians do bet
ter than expected, however, Vitou
sek may be able to be saved until
the 100. Don Smith and Brad Young
of Stanford will battle Schwaub of
the Bruins for those important sec
ond and third place points.
150-yard backstroke: Co-captain
Bill Weeden and Jim Canning of
Stanford are favored to sweep first
and second in this event. Weeden
should clip the meet record of 1:43.8
in winning all by himself. Canning
will probably be followed closely by
Siegal of U.C.L.A.
200-yard breaststroke: Co-captain
Roy Vitousek, Conference champion
and record-holder in this event,
should have little trouble in de
feating the Conference's number
two man, Dick Reed of U.C.L.A
Using the butterfly stroke, the huge
swimming ace should swim the event
in near record time.
440-yard free style: Doc Colyear
Farm sophomore star, should easily
take a first place in this race. Doc
turned in 5:09 for the quarter in
practicc a week ago and is really
develpoing into a definite threat for
the Conference title in this event. A1
Frost, the lad that's always where
he's needed most, will do his best
to beat Holmes of U.C.L.A. for the |
three second-place points.
4M-yard free style relay: This
event may be the deciding factor in
the meet. The Bruins boast the
greatest relay team in the Confer
ence and are capable of 3:42. The
Indians have turned in 3:42.6 in
practice. However, if Vitousek has
to swim in the grueling 230-yard
breaststroke, the Indians cannot hope
to touch U.C.L.A. with a tired Roy
swimming the anchor lap. If Vitou
sek can be kept out of the breast
stroke without losing the meet, the
two teams should stage one of the
closest relay races ever seen in En
cina pools. The Bruin quartet is
composed of Chandler, Schwaub,
Siegal, and Kuehne. Smith, Vitou
sek, Miller, and Regnolds are sup
posed to swim for the Indians. Mil
ler has been missing from practice
this quarter but showed up Wed
nesday. Regnolds has been ill with
a cold and may not be sufficiently
recovered to swim today. However,
if he can't make it today, versatile
Doc Colyear can fill in. This meet is
Stanford's first Conference tilt.
Stanford's varsity swimmers staged a last-minute brush-up yesterday
in preparation for today's battle with U.C.L.A. Contrary to report, there
will be no charge for admission lo the meet which begins at 3:30 o clock
this afternoon at the Encina Pools.
Both teams are undefeated this season and both are potentially top

teams in the country. U.C.L.A. has,
never defeated Stanford and this is
the year when they have their best
chance to break the jinx. The Bruins
almost came through last year but
Stanford eased them out for a 38-37
win.
300-yard medley relay: Stanford's
medley relay team of Bill Weeden,
Roy Vitousek and Don Smith is
heavily favored not only to win but
to smash the meet record of 3:OG.£
set in 1938. '
220-yard free style: Stanford's
sophomore "human torpedo," Dor
Colyear, is favored to win the fur
long with Indian A1 Frost and Bruin
Holmes staging a great race for sec
ond place.
50-yard free style: The Bruins'
ace, Captain Bill Kuehne, should win
by himself. Chandler of U.C.L.A.
and Brad Young and Gardner Miller
of Stanford should give the galleries
a thrill in their race for second and
third spot.
Fancy diving: Here the Indians
will miss Howie Adams, great div
ing champion, who is ineligible for
spring swimming. The Indian en
tries, Bill Niccolls, Bob Laverty, or
Bill Card will perform against the
Bruin, Fisher. The outcome of this
event is uncertain and both teams
badly need first place. Adams' loss
is a bitter blow to the Indian hopes
