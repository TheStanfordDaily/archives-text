# Frosh Trackers To Face Preps
## 
### 
If it rains today or tomorrow,
Freshman Track Coach Clyde Jef
frey will be a very disappointed man
for it will mean postponement of
another yearling track meet. The
potentially powerful freshman cin
der men are slated to face the Contra
Costa County High School All-Stars
tomorrow morning at 10 on Angell
Field.
Heavy rains and spring vacation
have combined to allow the Indian
babes barely three weeks of good
track weather. As a result, the En
cinamen, conceded to have the best
material in ten years, have not had
a chance to properly get in condi
tion. Tomorrow's meet is urgently
needed to prepare the frosh squad
for their final meet with California
at the end of this month.
Despite adverse conditions, several
men have turned in excellent marks
in practice and in the one meet held
this season. Tomorrow's hurdle races
should be very close between Joe
Mardesich, national prep school
champ, and Don Reiss, state high
school champion, who should run
one, two. Mardesich has done the
highs in 15.1 while Reiss has run the
220 lows in 25.7.
Stanford may $core a sweep in the
sprints with Bob Waters, Kenny
Taix, and Buck Fawcett even though
Fawcett has had to divide his time
between football dnd track. The All-
Stars are reported to have a 440 man
capable of 50 seconds flat or better.
Bill Spaulding will be his opponent
tomorrow.
Other prospective Farm point win
ners are Bob Compton, Bob Raitt,
Jean LaMoure, Russ Collier, Bill
Joslyn, and Bob Bonner.
