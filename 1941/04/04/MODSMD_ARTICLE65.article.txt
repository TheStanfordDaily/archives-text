# Spring Football Practice Opens This Afternoon
## 
### 
With the first field drill scheduled
for 3:45 this afternoon, Stanford's
spring practice season definitely gets
under way with a turnout of over
80 hopeful aspirants for the 1941
version of the little Indian and his
i Model "T."
Each day brings forth new ru
mored position changes, among the
latest being that of the shift of Bill
Joslyn, former San Francisco prep
center and guard on last year's
Trosh aggregation, to one of the end
positions, which seem to be the
weakest on the squad at this early
date.
A campus rumor, as yet unveri
fied by Coach Shaughnessy, is that
Vic Lindskog, center on the 1940
Rose Bowl team, is to be shifted to
fullback, a spot at which he has had
some experience. In case of this
change the center spot will prob
ably be handled by Doug Stahle and
Loren LaPrade. LaPrade, up from
last year's frosh, is rated by many
observers as the best freshman cen
ter to enroll at Stanford in several
years, while Stahle was a more
than-capable substitute for Linds
kog last season.
Approximately 70 football suits
have been issued in the past three
days, while more are laid aside for
men that will not report for another
week or two. Shaughnessy is still
desirous of having more men turn
out for the practices, and urges
everyone having any intention of
doing so to report for the field drill
J this afternoon and to draw out a
suit.
Although the practice field is still
in pretty good shape, it is hoped that
the rain will stop soon enough so
that the practices can be run off
without any interference from the
weather.
