# Spring Fervor

### 
MOUNT Spring Election, quiescent for almost
a year now, has begun to rumble again,
and its political lava has begun to let off billow
ing clouds of gas.
Without the traditional flourish of nickel cigar
and dented derby, Farm ward-heelers have be
gun, in a subtle way, to ice campus factors under
a thick layer of sweet plum promises. And
their promises come none too soon, for only 12
days remain before Stanford students—or prob
ably only a fraction of them—will saddleshoe
to the ballot boxes and elect next year's leaders.
And despite the rasping metallic denotations
which are associated with such words as plum,
and promise, and blocks of votes, Stanford's
electioneering system is strikingly similar to the
two-party system which every four years gives
us the President of the United States.
Our Row and Hall factions parallel the Re
publican and Democratic parties. Our campus
caucuses, like the party conventions, are extra
legal—not illegal—since no provision has been
made for them in the Constitution.
Things are not as odious nor as odoriferous as
they seem. In the words of the Frosh Hand
book, which is presented to each incoming Stan
ford student:
"The first thing you will hear about is the
Row-Hall split. It will sound as it it were some
devilish spirit dividing an otherwise happy
family. It isn't. The Hall-How split is a natural
and practical part of the Stanford system, ex
actly parallel to the Democrat-Republican op
position in the national democracy. For prac
tical purposes, any election needs two or
more opposing parties. The natural division
of living groups into fraternities and sororities,
and university halls provides this bi-party
system.
An occasional glimpse on the inside of
Stanford politics may tend to disillusion you.
You may hear tales of promised positions ex
changed for promised votes. But don't worry;
in most cases, they are no more than prom
ises. And these "inside" deals, too, are a
natural part of a democratic system in prac
tice, and of the instinctive human hankering
to be pulling unseen strings—a hankering
more fulfilled if the strings are not really hid
den, but only glamorously obscured."—B.A.
