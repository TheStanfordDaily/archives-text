# Naval R.O.T.C.?
## 
### 
GIVEN especial impetus this- year by polls
in Encina, by the Stanford Emergency
Student Defense Council and by favorable ac
tion on the part of Ex Committee, annual dis
cussions on and lobbying for the installation of
a Naval R.O.T.C. unit on the Farm this year have
boiled down to the following points:
(1) Stanford men desire the installation of
such a unit. «
(2) Definite action on the part of students
must come in the very near future if such a unit
is to become an actuality on the Farm.
Moving beyond the usual point which student
bull sessions on a Naval R.O. have reached
yearly, Encina men this year polled fellow
frosh on the subject with gratifying results.
Out of 210 freshman balloters, 155 expressed
themselves as being wholeheartedly in favor
of the plan. Eighty-five enrollees would be re
guired in the first enlistment, according to naval
regulations. The over-lap of prospective appli
cants leaves little doubt as to student opinion.
Some have asked why a naval unit should be
established. Some are convinced that the army
R.O.T C. quite satisfactorily fills the bill.
Many men, either for personal or for family
reasons, quite frankly desire naval training and
are opposed to training for the army. These
men, at Stanford, are given only the choice be
tween army training or no training at all.
Facts must be faced. With conditions in their
present state the incoming Stanford freshman

of next year will be handicapped in comparison
with students at other universities—who can
make their choice between naval and army train
ing while at school. And there will be few
incoming freshmen who will not desire such
training.
It is extremely probable that lack of naval
training facilities may even affect the Farm male
freshman enrollment for next year. But from a
student viewpoint this is secondary to the fact
that the incoming frosh has absolutely no alter
native beyond that of no training at all.
Yes, students want to see a Naval R.O.T.C. on
the Farm. But official naval information alarm
ingly reveals that unless action is taken within
the next month no such unit will be established.
Eight new units are being planned by the
navy. No more. And official sources have stated
that these units will be selected within the next
month.
There can't be any beating around the bush.
Let's have one.
