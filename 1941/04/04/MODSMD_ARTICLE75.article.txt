# BULL SESSION
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
THE ANVIL CHORUS
YY/E WERE light-heartedly playing hop-scotch out
in front of Wilson's the other day waiting for the
famous myth—the ride from Paly—to appear, when
our attention was arrested by a lying in
the gutter. We had no special reason to be in the gut
ter (inasmuch as we were in front of Wilson's) but
we thought it would be interesting to see what the
gutter in front of Wilson's looks like. It looks fine.
Henceforth, any person passing by Wilson's with
the purpose of giving someone a ride please take a
casual peek into the gutter to see if there happens to
be a human figure there. If there is a good figure there,
stop! It won't be me. I don't have a good figure.
But to get back to our narrative, we were playing
hop-scotch (with plain water, that soda is habit
forming), when our eye was arrested by a newspaper.
(It makes no difference that our whole body was ar
rested a short time later—by the Palo Alto police
department.)
* * * *
VWE READ voraciously the latest exploits of Terry
and the Pirates—you see, we're quite in love with
Burma, although if Dale Arden would ever toss over
that over-rated bum, Flash Gordon, we might get a
wee bit interested in her, too. Incidentally, that Flash
makes me so angry. All he does is run around Mongo
chasing that turkey Ming. He does nothing to earn a
living; I doubt that he even gets an allowance from
his father. But money or no money, every woman in
the comic section falls in love with him.
It makes us unhappy, inasmuch as we think we
feel obligated to take a girl to dinner in the city to
even so much as hold her little hand. Come to think
of it, we don't know any girls with little hands.
♦ * » *
I>UT turning from the comic sections to the general
news section we discovered an interesting fact—
the University of Minnesota band is going to carry a
250-pound anvil around with it this year in order to
play the "Invocation of Alberich" from Wagner's "Das
Rheingold." Sound effects will be created by a certain
William (Big Bill) Zesiger beating the anvil with a
sledge hammer.
We think that it is a wonderful idea. We can't
quite figure out who is going to tote the anvil around
when the band marches, but Minnesota probably has
the thing all worked out.
But there is more to this than meets the eye. Just
think of all the draft-dodgers who were going to join
some service musical organization in order to get out
of doing heavy-duty work. Brother, take a hint from
an old-line musician (me) and forget all about that
little piccolo that you've been fondling so affection
ately.
Because if our army ever takes over that anvil idea,
there are going to be some mighty unhappy musicians
around. And|lhe big way army preparations are going
on suggests that they won't stop with a measley 250-
pound anvil. If worse comes to worse, they can always
convert it into a battleship.
As for us, dearie, we're heading for Mose's joint to
get a good second-hand sledge. Old '"Be Prepared"
Mayer, they call us. We're not going to carry that
nasty old anvil, we're going to beat hell out of it.

VWE READ voraciously the latest exploits of Terry
and the Pirates—you see, we're quite in love with
Burma, although if Dale Arden would ever toss over
that over-rated bum, Flash Gordon, we might get a
wee bit interested in her, too. Incidentally, that Flash
makes me so angry. All he does is run around Mongo
chasing that turkey Ming. He does nothing to earn a
living; I doubt that he even gets an allowance from
his father. But money or no money, every woman in
the comic section falls in love with him.
It makes us unhappy, inasmuch as we think we
feel obligated to take a girl to dinner in the city to
even so much as hold her little hand. Come to think
of it, we don't know any girls with little hands.
♦ * » *
I>UT turning from the comic sections to the general
news section we discovered an interesting fact—
the University of Minnesota band is going to carry a
250-pound anvil around with it this year in order to
play the "Invocation of Alberich" from Wagner's "Das
Rheingold." Sound effects will be created by a certain
William (Big Bill) Zesiger beating the anvil with a
sledge hammer.
We think that it is a wonderful idea. We can't
quite figure out who is going to tote the anvil around
when the band marches, but Minnesota probably has
the thing all worked out.
But there is more to this than meets the eye. Just
think of all the draft-dodgers who were going to join
some service musical organization in order to get out
of doing heavy-duty work. Brother, take a hint from
an old-line musician (me) and forget all about that
little piccolo that you've been fondling so affection
ately.
Because if our army ever takes over that anvil idea,
there are going to be some mighty unhappy musicians
around. And|lhe big way army preparations are going
on suggests that they won't stop with a measley 250-
pound anvil. If worse comes to worse, they can always
convert it into a battleship.
As for us, dearie, we're heading for Mose's joint to
get a good second-hand sledge. Old '"Be Prepared"
Mayer, they call us. We're not going to carry that
nasty old anvil, we're going to beat hell out of it.
