r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
The practice of class roll-taking is typically an
elementary school procedure. Yet the number of Stan
ford professors who cling to this antiquated method of
forcing lecture attendance is somewhat appalling.
Without any such regulations, a professor may gen
erally expect his class attendance to correspond to both
the degree of interest aroused by his lectures and the
value of his lectures in providing information which
he deems vital as evidenced by his examinations.
If a lecture course has neither of these drawing
powers, the intelligent student will do better to spend
that time acquiring the necessary information from
reading references. And if that student succeeds in
mastering the sub.'ect matter as will be shown by his
exam grades, it should be of no concern to the pro
fessor whether or not the student has attended classes.
There is an opinion that roll-taking is to prevent
chronic cutters from wasting time and making low
grades. This argument can best be answered by the
recognition that since universities are not designed
for apathetic students, teaching-procedure cannot as
sume university courses to be directed to such students.
