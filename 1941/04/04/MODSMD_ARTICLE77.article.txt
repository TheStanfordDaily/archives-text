# S. F. GESTAPO
## 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
j Having read the statements of Carter Barber and
Don Allan in The Daily, March 4, 1941, I am reminded
of Life's article on Jan Valtin's "Out of the Night,' in
which Valtin describes the horrible and inhuman
methods used by the Gestapo in Germany. Compared
to the treatment received by Barber and Allan, Valtin
enjoyed a Fourth-of-July picnic. Valtin was flogged—
but he was theoretically an enemy of the Third Reich;
Barber and Allan, so they say and so I am inclined to
; believe, were unmercifully beaten—yet they were not
I political enemies of the United States, but merely citi
i zens supposedly out of work. If this latter be a crime,
j I suggest that a few Americans, numbering in the mil
[ lions, be taken into custody and thoroughly beaten.
The San Francisco Gestapo had better communi
cate with Heinrich Himmler; he will tell them that
even in Germany vagrancy does not warrant concen
tration-camp treatment.
