W/ITHIN u few hours, maybe a day
or two at the most, Hitler's
crack mechanized armies, which for
nineteen and a half months have
proved invincible, are going to meet
a picked force of seasoned British
troops, most of them Anzacs —men
with the reputation for being among
the world's toughest fighters.
And for the first time they'll
he fighting on fairly equal terms.
The German High Command
wasn't hanking on Yugoslavian
resistance, and their plans can he
at best only a week or two old.
The British, too, have had little
time to consider the Yugoslavian
ahout-face.
Fighting with the Germans are
the Bulgarians; and with the British
are the Greeks (ask the Italians if
they're tough) and the Yugoslavs
mountain fighters, who as Serbs
during World War I, saw their coun
try overrun, were beaten, reformed
their armies, joined the British and
the French in the Salonika "cage,"
and fought to victory.

Y"ESTERDAY, it was nearly im
possible to get any sort of con
crete information. From Belgrade
(reported from Berlin via Zurich to
be in flames) there was no word.
Athens said little, except that her
forces had held at every position
except one.
Britain officially admitted for the
first time that part of General
Wavcll's victorious Army of the
Nile was in Greece "to stand in
line with the soldiers of our brave
ally" and that fleets of British
warplanes were ready for a show
down struggle in the Balkans.
In this country Secretary Hull
announced that the United States is
"proceeding as speedily as possible
to send military and other supplies
to Yugoslavia." The American Bed
Cross has already announced the
purchase and shipment of great
quantities of relief materials, includ
ing 10 field hospitals, tons of medi
cines and blankets.
# Hi *
first reports it seems that
the Germans are attempting a
two-way drive on Salonika where
one British force is stationed. They
are driving down through the
Struma River valley from Bulgaria
into Greece, and across from Bul
garia toward the Bulgarian Vardar
River valley which also leads
toward Salonika.
At the same time they are at
tempting a thrust across the
mountains from Bulgaria through
Yugoslavia to Albania, where the
beleaguered Italians are now fac
ing two enemies and in imminent
danger of being forced to swim
home. This move would cut Yu
goslavia off from Greece. But the
mountains are high.
With the fall of Addis Ababa it is
certain that Italy's East African Em
pire can not possibly last for longer
than another two weeks, and two
key factors will then come to a head.
First, a considerable British force
will be released for duty in Greece;
and second, it will be possible for
President Roosevelt to remove the
Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea from
the "combat zone."

The question of convoys is
a ticklish one. All-out aid to
Britain is of no use if all the sup
plies are torpedoed. We have prom
ised aid to Greece and now to
Yugoslavia. Logically, with East
Africa out of the fighting, the
American navy could convoy either
across the Pacific and around India
up to Suez, or across the Atlantic
around Africa up to Suez. Nazi
raiders are probably in no mood to
tip their hats politely when a mer
chantman carrying supplies to their
enemies goes sailing by—even if the
convoy belongs to an ostensible
neutral.
At any rate, two factors are defi
nitely in Britain's favor in the
Balkans. German communication
lines are very long—and they can
be bombed heavily. And Cunning
barn's fleet has complete command
of (he Mediterranean. The fleet,
particularly at Salonika, can bomb
the daylights out of Nazi troops
maneuvering around that peninsula.
Daily publicity has done much to
reduce traffic violations.
