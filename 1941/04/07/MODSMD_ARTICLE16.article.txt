# Police 'Tip' Shifts Finger Of Suspicion
## 
### 
A "grapevine" tip that the police
man or policemen who bestially
slugged two Stanford freshmen with
out provocation is one of the four
newly suspended officers and not
Officers Joseph Greene and John J.
Desmond, already tried on the
charges, was conveyed to Walter
McGovern, police commissioner, this
week-end.
Trial of the four officers whose
badges have been at least tempo
rarily lifted by the Police Commis
sion and retrial of the two officers
originally accused by the two stu
dents, Carter Barber and Don Allan,
tentatively is scheduled for tonight
in the Hall of Justice.
SECRET SOURCE
Mr. McGovern indicated this tip,
source unrevcaled, "puts the finger"
on one of the four recently sus
pended policemen, Sergeant Thomas
Flanagan, Patrolwagon Driver Be
nito Escobar, and Patrolmen Roy
Loran and Edward Van Devort.
He also claims the latest lead,
which breaks a week's deadlock,
clears both Patrolman Greene and
Patrolman Desmond. Mr. McGov
ern pointed out that his "tip" was
in connection with only one of the
four officers, and that his investi
gation was not complete.
OFFICER DRUNK?
The commissioner's tip indicated
the officer now under direct suspi
cion of the beating was drunk while
on duty at the time the beatings
occurred. The commission earlier
concluded the students definitely
were beaten while in police custody
the night of March 1, when they
were arrested for vagrancy while
on what the pair said was a "socio
logical tour" of the city's Skid Row
district.
Another police headache this
week-end was the ' suspension by
Chief Charles Dullea of Officer Wal
ter Martin, 4(1, of Ingleside Station,
on a charge of intoxication while
on duty.
In addition, the Police Commission
dismissed as untrue the claim of a
22-year-old confessed Negro ex
tortionist that police offered him a
trip to Alaska to "take the rap" for
the now-famous Barber-Allan beat
ings.
