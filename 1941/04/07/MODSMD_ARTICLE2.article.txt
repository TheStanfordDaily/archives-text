## Albert, Breckner, Haugh, Jackson, Tatum Prime for Presidential Post 
### ROWAN HALL 
With spring quarter calendars showing election day barely a week in
the distance, Farm politicos feverishly greased election machines over a
busy week-end that brought the following crystallizations:
(1) Inter-club solons apparently are seeking a united Hall front under
the impetus of a movement that is pushing Breakers' George Jackson to

the fore as the leading Hall candidate,
for A.S.S.U. president.
(2) Row big-wigs in four sepa
rate camps worked over the week
end to secure backing for the formal
Row caucus, with coalitions hinted
at in at least two camps.
Frankie Albert, Deke; Bob Breck
ner, Alpha Delt; Sandy Tatum,
eZte; and Jim Haugh, Delt, remain
as dead-locked competitors for ■ the
Row nomination.
Along the feminine front:
Pat Adams, Tri Delt, and Alpha
Phi Sylvia Berry loomed as sure
thing entrants in the Row parade of
aspirants for the student body vice
presidency.
lIAYNES MAY RUN

Union and Roble sponsor, received

for the official Hall caucus sched
uled tomorrow evening. Following
the caucus, Interclub big-wigs plan
a pep rally in the Toyon lobby, with
