# TOMMIES, GREEKS FIGHT TOGETHER
## 
### 
ZURICH, April 6 (UP).â€”Jugoslav
and Greek troops fought side by side
with British Tommies tonight to
halt Germany's war machine crash
ing across their frontiers.
Adolf Hitler's vast Balkan army
of 500,000 or more troops and fleets
of terrifying dive-bombers, at
dawn smashed simultaneously into
Jugoslavia and Greece while Italy's
air force attacked southern Jugo
slavia.
The Bucharest radio reported
early today that, despite Rumania's
neutrality, the Jugoslavs yesterday
shelled the frontier town of Orsova
from across the Danube, killing one
person.
(Jugoslav planes bombed Timi
soara and Oravica as well as a Ru
manian airdrome near Arad, the
Bucharest radio said.)
The Nazi radio boasted that day
long aerial bombardment had left
Belgrade "a sea of flames."
Belgrade with three daylight raids
was treated to the same merciless
devastation which Warsaw and Rot
terdam suffered.
