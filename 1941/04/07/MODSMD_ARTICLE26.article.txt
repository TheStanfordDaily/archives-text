# ADDIS ABABA FALLS TO EMPIRE TROOPS
## 
### 
CAIRO, April 6 (UP). â€” British
Empire forces today captured the
Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa
without a struggle. It was the cli
max of a triumphant conquest
which, in only 11 weeks, shattered
Fascism's east African empire that
took Italy 70 years to build.
The union jack was raised over
the plateau city of 170,000 popula
tion, still smoking with fires set by
waves of British bombers, after its
surrender by beaten tlalian troops
of the Duke of Aosta. They were re
ported to have fled before British
South African forces stormed into
the town.
