# Soph Carnival Heads Named
## 
### 
Work on the 1941 Sophomore
Carnival, slated for the evening of
Friday, April 18, got under way over
the week-end with the naming of
chairmen and committees by class
officers Ralph Bjorkland and Joan
Hill.
The carnival, which is the first
big social event of Spring Quarter,
will take place as usual in the Pa
vilion and will contain the usual
amount of "secret" concessions, egg
tossing and general sophomoric
hilarity.
Ralph Kiewitz will be chairmen of
the affair, and will be assisted by
the following committees:
Finance: Margaret Wallace, chair
man. Publicity: Frank Bauman,
chairman, Barbara Cull, Vic Mina
han. Living groups committee: Ben
Parkinson, chairman; Burt Berry,
men's halls; 'Mary Ann Walker,
women's halls; Bob Blaker, fraterni
ties; and Hester de Lisle, sororities.
Construction and lighting commit
tee: Tiny Mozier, chairman. Tick
et committee: A1 Hass, chairman.
Clean-up committee: Jack Pugh,
chairman.
The committees are not complete
as yet and will be filled early this
week with the aid of the Activity
Card Files, Kiewitz announced.
