"Pardon me, but can you tell me how to get to the Hoover home?"
"Oh God, it's in the hushes."
So goes a typical answer which The Daily obtained on an investiga
tion of how many students know where Stanford's most distinguished
graduate lives. Over half of those queried haven't the slightest idea

where the ex-President's home
The other half were attacked by an •
extreme loss of words in attempting |
to utter the directions.
WHOSE HOME
Here are some of the answers:
"You go out—what's that road up
there? The last time I told some
tourists how to get there they drove
around the same block four times,
so maybe you'd better ask somebody
else."
"Go out Portola Road until you
hit the Deke house, turn left and
Ihen go winding up around that hill.
Sorry, I've been here four years but
that's as near as I can tell you.
"Damned if I know—it's back up
there some place where the homes
are."
NO ONE KNOWS
"You go to the schoolhouse and
go up that road until it goes this way
and turn to the left until you see a
house with lots of chimneys."
"It's so hidden by trees f-nd stuff
that nobody can find it."
One conscientious soul drew us a
map showing the Bookstore, the
post office and the golf course. His
directions were "to go up the road
by the Bookstore, turn right a
block beyond the post office, turn
left at the next intersection, keep
going till you go over a little knoll,
and then start going around in cir
cles until you get there."
"Pardon me, but can you tell me how to get to the Hoover home?"
"Oh God, it's in the hushes."
