## 
### 
COLUMBUS, O. (UP).â€”An 11-
year study of student's achieve
ments, soon to be completed, has led
educators to the conclusion that suc
cess in college does not depend on a
student's following a prescribed
course in high school.
The study by the Progressive Edu
cation Association is expected to end
within a few months and it will be
published in six volumes by a spe
cial commission under the chair
manship of Dr. Wilford M. Aiken of
Ohio State University.
