# Weather Does Queer Things To Stanford
## 
### HARRIET FISHER 
Stanford has been lucky in its
weather the last week: not in the
weather itself but in its effects. No
serious damage has been reported
on the campus except the mildewing
of a few trunks in sorority and fra
ternity house basements and the
return of the "winter quarter" coif
fure of fallen curls for Farm women.
In fact, the campus seems to be the
only place in Northern California
not greatly affected by the rain
storms and gales which have swept
the whole area. In Palo Alto the
weather bureau reports a rainfall
which threatens to exceed that of
1915 by the end of the season. The
ground floor of one Palo Alto home
was covered with 14 inches of water.
Traffic halted in San Francisco and
streets were turned into lakes and
rivers. Over half an inch of rain
fell in the same amount of time
Friday morning, bringing this sea
son's total to the highest mark since
the legendary big rains of 1889-90.
Slides and floods blocked roads and
railroad tracks throughout the Bay
district. Even the Sacramento River
Is "dangerously high."
And on the Farm the weather was
nice enough this week-end for a few
brave souls to go in swimming in
the swollen waters of Lake Lagunita.
Yesterday, sun porches all over the
campus were filled with students
trying to get the first stages of a
California tan. But tomorrow, says
the weather man, will see "light
showers" throughout the Bay area.
"Sunny California?" Bah! Page
that Chamber of Commerce.
