## 
### BOB HANNAH 
Stanford's mighty swimming ag
gregation piled up their seventl
straight victory Friday when tliej
steainrolled U.C.L.A., 4(5-2!). Forg
ing into an early lead liy winning
and establishing a new meet record
of 3:04.3 in the medley relay, the In
dians never left the driver's seat
although at times (hey were onlj
one point ahead of the Uclans.
Despite their victory, the star ol
Ihe meet did not come from the
Cardinal ranks. He was Captain
Bill Kuehne of U.C.L.A., who estab
lished new meet records of :23.0 in
the 50-yard free slyle and :53.6 in
the 100-yard freestyle. This last
it me was 1.4 seconds better than
previous marks.
DIVERS FLASH
Encouraging indeed were the rec
ords turned in by Bill Niccolls and
Bob Laverty, Indian divers. Show
ing beautiful form, Niccolls aggre
gated 93.4 points to take first place
from Fisher, the heavily favored
diver from U.C.L.A. Leaving plenty
of room for improvement, Laverty
showed a lot of promise for future
tilts.
Going into the 440-yard freestyle,
the score was Stanford 33, U.C.L.A.
2G. Realizing that if Stanford won
this event, it would have the points
necessary to win the meet, Coach
Nort Thornton entered the Indians'
sophomore torpedo, Doc Colyear.
For the first 14 laps it looked like a
nip and tuck race; but from then on
it was a walk away. Colyear glided
away from the Uclan's highly touted
Holmes to finish a good quarter
length ahead. The time was 5:18.6.
WEEDEN WINS
Bill Weeden and Jim Canning of
Stanford took first and second in
the 150-yard backstroke to win in
1:43.1. The relay team, swimming
after the meet was won, swam home
to an easy victory. Following the
lead set by Co-captain Vitousek,
Smith, Young and Miller retained
the advantage to win by a half
length over the Bruin anchor man,
Bill Kuehne.
One of the best races of the after
noon was the 220-yard freestyle in
which Doc Colyear nosed out
Holmes of U.C.L.A. in a 2:22.2 win.
A1 Frost came in third in this event.
Colyear, besides being a versatile
utility man. is the best distance man
on the Card squad He not only won
the 220 but also the 440. Doc has
beautiful form and always seems to
know just when to "pour it on."
The Indians didn't look good in
the 200-yard breaststroke, although
Big Bob Jones took an easy second.
With another season's practice he
should develop into one of the
Coast's best men in this event.
