### CHUCK SMITH 
RUMBLINGS from the Southland
i where the greatest track team in the
country is just getting under way
for the 1941 season.
And I DO mean that U.S.C. will,
for the seventh consecutive year,
have the greatest cinder outfit in
the nation. Granted that California
has the unapproachable Grover
Klemmer and a host of other stars,
not even the Bears will be able to
compete with the power of the
Trojans.
Take for example the sprints,
I where Dean Cromwell should be
j badly crippled by the graduation
j cf Mickey Anderson and Barney
Willis and injury to the promis
ing Jack Trout, brother of Stan
i ford's shot-putting Bill Trout of
I two years back.
Troy has Dean Rickman, who has
, marks of 9.7 and 21.9; Cliff Bour
land, who broke Frank Wyckoff's
Bovard Field record for the 220
around one turn with a mark of 21.7.
Then, for fillers, there is Stan Skafte
with marks of 9.8 and 21.3; Howard
Carter, who has done 9.9 and 21.6;
| and Wayne Matson, who has the
| same best times that Carter has.
In the quarter mile there is Cap
: lain Howard Upton, who has done
47 flat; Howard Bachman, at 47.2;
; Hubert Kerns, with a relay lap of
; 47.4; and (he aforementioned Bour
land, who won the Junior A.A.U.
400-meter in 47.4.
The half mile is rather weak, the
only prospect being Warren Smith,
; a sophomore, who was timed in
1:53.7 behind Woodruff of Pittsburg
and Stanford's Paul Moore in last
year's A.A.U. Leroy .Weed leads the
Trojans distance men with a mark
of 4:13 in the mile last year. The
poor Trojans have only four men
who are under 15 fiat in the high
hurdles, too bad. They are Art Ka
cewicz and John Biewener with
best marks of 14.4, Don Hommel at
14.6, and Hay ward Wheeler at 14.8.
In the low hurdles there is Art
I Laret who lias done 23.4 and Ed
| Grunbock who has been beating
Laret in practice so far this year.
Turning to the field events: i
Cromwell has perhaps the two j
best collegiate high jumpers in
the country. They are Johny Wil
son, the one-foot-bare jumper who
is just shy of the world record
with a leap of 6-!) :i k and Gil La-
Cava, who has done CJ-7'/•» this
season.
The traditionally strong Trojan
pole vaulters are present as usual.
This year there is Willard Schaefer
who has done 14 feet this year and
Byron Dudley, due to clear this
height any day.
Mel Bleeker has done 23-9 as
has Art Laret in the broad jump.
Bob Peoples, holder of the American
record in the javelin at 234-2, is still
hanging around and has fully re
covered from the broken arm which
handicapped him somewhat last
year.

In the low hurdles there is Art
I Laret who lias done 23.4 and Ed
| Grunbock who has been beating
Laret in practice so far this year.
Turning to the field events: i
Cromwell has perhaps the two j
best collegiate high jumpers in
the country. They are Johny Wil
son, the one-foot-bare jumper who
is just shy of the world record
with a leap of 6-!) :i k and Gil La-
Cava, who has done CJ-7'/•» this
season.
The traditionally strong Trojan
pole vaulters are present as usual.
This year there is Willard Schaefer
who has done 14 feet this year and
Byron Dudley, due to clear this
height any day.
Mel Bleeker has done 23-9 as
has Art Laret in the broad jump.
Bob Peoples, holder of the American
record in the javelin at 234-2, is still
hanging around and has fully re
covered from the broken arm which
handicapped him somewhat last
year.
RUMBLINGS from the Southland
i where the greatest track team in the
country is just getting under way
for the 1941 season.
And I DO mean that U.S.C. will,
for the seventh consecutive year,
have the greatest cinder outfit in
the nation. Granted that California
has the unapproachable Grover
Klemmer and a host of other stars,
not even the Bears will be able to
compete with the power of the
Trojans.
Take for example the sprints,
I where Dean Cromwell should be
j badly crippled by the graduation
j cf Mickey Anderson and Barney
Willis and injury to the promis
ing Jack Trout, brother of Stan
i ford's shot-putting Bill Trout of
I two years back.
Troy has Dean Rickman, who has
, marks of 9.7 and 21.9; Cliff Bour
land, who broke Frank Wyckoff's
Bovard Field record for the 220
around one turn with a mark of 21.7.
Then, for fillers, there is Stan Skafte
with marks of 9.8 and 21.3; Howard
Carter, who has done 9.9 and 21.6;
| and Wayne Matson, who has the
| same best times that Carter has.
In the quarter mile there is Cap
: lain Howard Upton, who has done
47 flat; Howard Bachman, at 47.2;
; Hubert Kerns, with a relay lap of
; 47.4; and (he aforementioned Bour
land, who won the Junior A.A.U.
400-meter in 47.4.
The half mile is rather weak, the
only prospect being Warren Smith,
; a sophomore, who was timed in
1:53.7 behind Woodruff of Pittsburg
and Stanford's Paul Moore in last
year's A.A.U. Leroy .Weed leads the
Trojans distance men with a mark
of 4:13 in the mile last year. The
poor Trojans have only four men
who are under 15 fiat in the high
hurdles, too bad. They are Art Ka
cewicz and John Biewener with
best marks of 14.4, Don Hommel at
14.6, and Hay ward Wheeler at 14.8.
