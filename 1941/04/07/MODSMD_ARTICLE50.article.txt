# Stanford Netmen Bow Before Troy
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity netmen took a
7-2 shellacking from the hands of
the University of Southern Califor
nia racketmen last Saturday in their
first conference match of the year.
The Friday match with the U.C.L.A.
Bruins was rained out.
The Trojans showed unexpected
power as they swept five of the
singles matches and two of the
doubles. Jack Gurley was the only
Indian to win his singles match,
while the team of Bob Low and
Stan Owen gave the Cards their
other win.
Twice a year, in February and in
April, the majority of Stanford's
student body officers is elected.
