## CHUCK SMITH, Sports Editor Trojan Nine Due to Weaken 
### 
Chances of Stanford's baseball
squad catching up a couple of games
on the league-leading Southern
California Trojans are in the mak
ing this week—for Troy and its one
man pitching master, Ed Vitalich,
must play five games between Tues
day and Saturday, meeting Santa
Clara Tuesday, Stanford in a double
header Wednesday, St. Mary's
Thursday, and California Saturday.
So far, the Trojan pitching staff
has been Vitalich all the way, the
amazing side-arm hurler having won
five straight for the leaders of the
C.1.8.A.
Coach Sam Barry will probably
pitch either Bob Foltz or Earl Cham
bers against the Broncos tomorrow
and will save his ace for the double
barreled Indian fray on Wednesday.
Barry may even ask Vitalich to go
I? or innings.
The S.C. pitcher makes great use

I of a slow dinker pitch and may turn
the hick. The Cards couldn't master
I his slow ball in the South until the
late innings when it was too late to
do any damage, but Wednesday will
give them a better chance if Vitalich
attempts to pitch the first game and
part of the second.
Stanford will probably use Cootie
Thompson and Claude Purkitt on
the hill against the Trojans.
