# Card, San Jose Meet Cancelled
## 
### 
Stanford's dual meet with San
Jose State was washed out Satur
day and the meet has tentatively
been set for Tuesday afternoon.
Badly in need of practice meets
before they face Cal and U.S.C., the
Indians have been gypped out of
their last two meets by the weather
man. And a new storm threatens
the track situation this week.
Meanwhile, from across the bay,
conies the news of sensational
marks by some of Cal's runners.
Dick Peter ran the fastest mile ever
seen at Berkeley two days ago in
the remarkable time of 4:12.8.
Barnes, Froom, and Klemmer gave
â– 1000 spectators a show with some
swell time trials.
