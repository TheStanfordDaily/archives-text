A NEWS item appearing on page one of to
day's Daily states the position of Deputy
Selective Service Director Lewis B. Hershey
with regard to deferment of students in training
for "a necessary occupation in an activity neces
sary to the national health, safety, or interest."
These items were sent out by the U.S. Com
missioner of Education on March 27, but the
releases quoted were made by Lewis Hershey
on February 21 and March 7.
Mr. Hershey was evidently very interested at
this time in seeing that students who would be
of future use to the government got a fair deal
by not being taken out of school to pack a gun
if a little later they were going to be trained in
the delicate use of the scalpel, or in designing
better airplanes, or in the engineering of sani
tary protection for massed armies.
But a few short weeks after Mr. Hershey sent
these dispatches to all state directors of Selec
tive Service, he went to Chicago to give the
closing address to a convention of the North
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary
Schools.
Here on March 29 Mr. Hershey made an
abrupt "right-about-face." In addressing these
educators he absolutely contradicted his posi
tion of a few short weeks before.
A press association dispatch reporting the
convention read as follows:
"Lewis Hershey, Deputy Director of the Se
lective Service System, today opposed contin
uing the draft act provision which gives tempo
rary deferment to high school, college, and uni
versity students to enable them to complete
their present academic school year before join
ing the colors.
"Hershey told the educators he would recom
mend a discontinuance of the provision because
the army needed young men who had been
educated for leadership."
This story went practically unnoticed in the
newspapers, both college and city, throughout
the country.
But only a short time ago, all papers carried
top headlines to the effect that the "Draft Is
Ahead of Schedule."
We grant that everybody has the right to
change his mind, but also we in college would
like very much to know, if the big-shots could
get together for a few minutes, just where we
stand.—C. B.

day's Daily states the position of Deputy
Selective Service Director Lewis B. Hershey
with regard to deferment of students in training
for "a necessary occupation in an activity neces
sary to the national health, safety, or interest."
These items were sent out by the U.S. Com
missioner of Education on March 27, but the
releases quoted were made by Lewis Hershey
on February 21 and March 7.
Mr. Hershey was evidently very interested at
this time in seeing that students who would be
of future use to the government got a fair deal
by not being taken out of school to pack a gun
if a little later they were going to be trained in
the delicate use of the scalpel, or in designing
better airplanes, or in the engineering of sani
tary protection for massed armies.
But a few short weeks after Mr. Hershey sent
these dispatches to all state directors of Selec
tive Service, he went to Chicago to give the
closing address to a convention of the North
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary
Schools.
Here on March 29 Mr. Hershey made an
abrupt "right-about-face." In addressing these
educators he absolutely contradicted his posi
tion of a few short weeks before.
A press association dispatch reporting the
convention read as follows:
"Lewis Hershey, Deputy Director of the Se
lective Service System, today opposed contin
uing the draft act provision which gives tempo
rary deferment to high school, college, and uni
versity students to enable them to complete
their present academic school year before join
ing the colors.
"Hershey told the educators he would recom
mend a discontinuance of the provision because
the army needed young men who had been
educated for leadership."
This story went practically unnoticed in the
newspapers, both college and city, throughout
the country.
But only a short time ago, all papers carried
top headlines to the effect that the "Draft Is
Ahead of Schedule."
We grant that everybody has the right to
change his mind, but also we in college would
like very much to know, if the big-shots could
get together for a few minutes, just where we
stand.—C. B.
