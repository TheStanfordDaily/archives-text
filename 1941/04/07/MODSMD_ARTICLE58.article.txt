AT the risk of being criticized for over-empha
sis today on matters pertaining to the draft
and college men, this column wishes to com
mend highly a recent action of Colonel Robert
Roos.
Colonel Roos, vice-president of the National
Retail Dry Goods Association and president and
general manager of Roos Bros., has had the cour
age to bring out into the open the matter of re
ported refusal of "un-American" employers to
hire college men because they might be in
ducted into the army.
In urging the directors of his association to
take the lead in remedying this situation, Colo
nel Roos said:
. . according to a recent survey made at
36 of our leading universities and colleges
throughout the United States, the men of grad
uating classes are finding it difficult to obtain
employment. They state that employers are
unwilling to employ them since most of them
are of draft age and may be inducted into serv
ice.
"If the above statement is borne out by fact
. . . such un-American action on the part of
even a few of the employers of this country
could destroy every effort we are making for
national unity."
We hope the recipients of this letter did not
file it in the waste-basket and that some concrete
action will come of it.
The army will not be able to take immediately
the entire class of '41 from all the universities
of the country. And the graduating senior's in
born instinct is to look for a job as soon as he
gets out. If the question asked by the nation's

employers changes from "What are your quali
fications?" to "What is your draft number?"
the situation definitely will not be healthy for
society—or the college man.—C. B.
