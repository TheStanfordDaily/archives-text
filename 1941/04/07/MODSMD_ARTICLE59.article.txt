# Dear Ma:

### 
THIS editor boss of mine whipped in this
afternoon and flipped a quip my way asking
if I had left any room at the bottom of the edit
column. I answered in the affirmative, and as
he tore out of the Shack (dressed up fit to kill)
he told me to fill the bottom with something
screwy telling the staff that we were putting
out a paper this quarter and that they ought to
drop around tomorrow afternoon to staff meet
ing and find out what was going on.
The time this quarter agreed to by everybody
except Chandler is Monday at 1:15, so conse
quently the staff will meet Monday at 1:15.
Edit Board will hash things over in secret
session at 1 o'clock sharp.â€”C. B.
