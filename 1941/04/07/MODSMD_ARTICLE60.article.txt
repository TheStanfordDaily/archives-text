### JERRY MAYER 
THE GREAT CRUSADE
64WTHY don't you ride a white charger?" my friend
asked me the other day. "Here you have a col
umn all to yourself. Why don't you crusade for some
thing fine and noble? The least you can do is conduct
a campaign for betterment and upliftment."
I thanked my friend, told him that it was a fine
idea, and ran down the street to buy my daily all-day
sucker.
But actually my mind traveled back through the
years (two of them) to the time I rode my last white
charger. At that time, I daintily galloped my gallant
steed into the front room, pirouetted gracefully,
scratched my left ear, and told my father that I
thought the Democrats were pretty good guys all
around, and Roosevelt was a helluva fine guy.

Â£T WAS Hannibal, I think, who demonstrated for
the benefit of all history the efficacy of the elephant.
My father is no Hannibal, but I doubt sincerely whether
Hannibal could handle an elephant the way my father
can handle the G.O.P. beast of burden.
"What!" he whatted, and climbed onto the Repub
lican elephant's back.
But the crusade was on. I refused to back down.
I would bring light into our darkened home if I died
in the attempt. I discovered all of a sudden that my
fiery steed was naught but the Democrats' donkey.
And when my father let fiy with some figures on taxa
tion, I felt like a centaur.
But we loyal Democrats l'efuse to be outdone. I
had some figures of my own. "Do you know," I de
manded, pointing my little finger at the apostle of
Republicanism in our domicile, "that twelve and
eleven-sixteenths of the undivided finance taxes are
used to augment the corporal structure of the utility
sub-foundation?" I was on familiar ground now.
"Do you know," I pounded my point home by
crashing my mother's favorite vase through the stained
glass window, "that Roosevelt's policy in regard to
migrant capital has made possible the reinvestment
of millions of dollars of loans in practically fool-proof
boondoggling projects."

J WAS doing marvelously. my father was amazed.
My mother was so proud of me. Our maid (who is
a socialist because she thinks she'll get two days oil
a week under a socialist regime) was standing on the
dining room table applauding.
But success went to my head, as success often does.
My crusading white charger, that had transmitted into
a donkey right under my very . . . seat, was quiver
ing triumphantly. My next statement absolutely ruined
the crusade.
"Furthermore," I cried inexorably, "do you know
that Senate Bill number 760, promulgated under Mr.
Roosevelt's influence, has made it compulsory for pig
eons to wear diapers? That has proved an absolute
boon to bridge-building throughout the country and
has promoted tremendous savings on paint jobs."
A wicked gleam came into my father's eye. His
Republican elephant moved toward me with a malevo
lent expression in its eye.
The rest of the details are gory. Suffice it to say
that my father is still a Republiean. My great crusade
had failed.
The moral of the story is:
Never ride a white charger. He might end up being
a donkey.
Oh, yes, I did convert the maid. She became a
Democrat because I promised her three days of! a
week.
