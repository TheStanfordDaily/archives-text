r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I heard Nino Martini Thursday night and I wish
to say that I think that Douglass really "missed the
boat" on her review of the concert. If Mr. Martini
failed to impress the audience, why in the world
would they ask him back for six encores?
It could be pointed out to Miss Douglass that all
of the audience might not have attended the concert
just to be thrilled by Mr. Martini's rendition of opera.
Perhaps a few hundred people went for entertainment.
It seems to me that this was the most informal and
friendly concert I have attended at Stanford. My cul
tural tastes may not be up to the Stanford par, but I
believe that last Thursday's Nino Martini is more of
the thing we want for our concert series—pleasurable,
understandable, intellectual entertainment.
