# AND AGAIN

r FIIE EDITOR, SIR:
Who is Miss Douglass, anyhow? From her com
ments on the Martini concert I should judge that she
is a person who has no business writing music re
views.
Will someone please tell her that Mr. Martini is
only a measly lyric tenor who does not even pretend
to be Lauritz Melchior? (Or does Miss Douglass know
who Melchior is?) Mr Martini sings "simple melodious
songs" because that is what his voice is suited for.
Mr. Martini's concert was chosen "wisely" from the
point of view of suitability to his voice but it cer
tainly did not show it to its best advantage as Miss
Douglas should know if she has ever heard him in
opera or the movies or in concert before.
Really, someone should tell Miss Douglass that those
arias Mr. Martini sang are not so heavy as she thinksâ€”
don't pretend to be, but they are from roles suited to
his voice.
Well, the Metropolitan is all wrong and hundreds
of thousands of Americans are all wrong. May I sug
gest that Miss Douglas go to hear Mr. Martini once
more before writing another review on him or any
other artist?
On second thought, maybe she'd better stick to Bitig
Crosby.
A Crosby und Martini fan
