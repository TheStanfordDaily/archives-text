# Perennial 'Back Street', Without Mush, Satisfies
## 
### 
"BACK STREET," with Margaret Sullavan and Charles Boycr.
Now hero is an example of excellent craftsmanship on the part of
Universal Studios. When the people who make movies (whoever they
are) can take an antiquated and much mistreated story like "Back Street"
and turn it into a dramatically satisfying motion picture, it's enough to

make all reviewers rise and in a <
body chortle, ""Motion pictures are
the best form of entertainment."
Fannie Hurst should be the pro
ducer's best friend—it seems that
whenever literary inspiration is a
bit slack in the cinema capital (also
known as the city of a thousand
sorrows), there's always an old Fan
nie Hurst story in the files that can
be trotted out and preserved in
celluloid.
SAME OLD STORY
The story is usually "Back Street,"
a hardy sort of perennial that can
always be relied on to furnish fat
roles for a couple of seasoned actors.
It has the right proportions of
pathos and romance and nostalgia to
make it enjoyable no matter how
well you know the story.
This particular version is espe
cially pleasing. With Margaret Sul
lavan and Charles Boyer in the
leading roles, the story thankfully
avoids sentimentality and damp
tragicality. Of course it's sad, but
with the expert performances of
Boyer and Miss Sullavan the some
what trivial story of love unrequited
achieves a dignity and restraint that
keep it from being revoltingly teary.
LOVE UNREQUITED
Everyone knows the story—so I'll
repeat it #nyway. Margaret Sulla
van and Charles Boyer are in love,
of course. She misses the boat, lit
erally, and thus misses her chance to
marry the ambitious young banker
(that's Boyer). When they meet
again he is married, still ambitious,
and very successful. Since he can't
get a divorce, because the effect of
scandal on his career, they go on
for the next 25 years—well, they go
on.
Meanwhile she gives up a chance
to marry another man, and he dem
onstrates his versatility by dividing

his life between his family and the
Other Woman.
Of course, it's undisputably a pe
riod piece—but polished acting and
skillful direction make it an excel
lent and gentle little drama.
"Scattergood Baine," with Guy
Kibbee as the corpulent sage is the
accompanying feature.—Douglass
