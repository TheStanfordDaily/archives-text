NEW YORK, April 6 (UP).â€”.S.
Steel Corporation's labor troubles
and the war in the Balkans becloud
the stock market outlook for the
coming week.
S.W.O.C. announcement Saturday
night that a work stoppage would
be called at Big Steel's plants Tues
day at midnight came as a surprise
to men close to the company.
A source close to the U.S. Steel
management said, however, that the
corporation will delay the work
stoppage call for one week, at least,
by agreeing to a S.W.O.C. proposal
at a conference tomorrow. Under
the plan, rejected by the Steel man
agement last Friday, work will con
tinue at Big Steel's plants until
midnight, April 15, with any contract
benefits to be applied retroactively
to April 1.
