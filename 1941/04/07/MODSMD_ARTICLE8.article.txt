# Student Deferment Clarified By Education Commissioner
## 
### 
The Registrar's office recently received information regarding the de
ferment of students' training for "a necessary occupation in an activity
necessary to the national interest, from the U. S. Office of Education.
The material received from Education Commissioner John W. Stude
bakcr was in the form of copies of memoranda from Deputy Selective

Service Director Lewis B. Harshey to
state draft directors. These state
ments urged serious consideration by
local draft boards of students and

teachers in and training others for
occupations "necessary to national
interest."
In reclassification of students in
Class 1-D whose group deferment
will end July 1, local boards were
urged by Hershey to defer persons
found to be "necessary men in any
industry, business employment, ag
ricultural pursuit, governmental
service, or any other service or en
deavor or IN TRAINING OR PREP
ARATION THEREFOR, the mainte
nance of which is necessary to the
national health, safety, or interest.
He particularly urged considera
tion of the factor "in training or
preparation therefor."
The dispatch also stated, "In de
termining whether or not a student
is a necessary man within the pro
visions of paragraph 351, the local
board should give due consideration
to such factors as the length of time
which the student has been pur
suing the course in question, his
relative progress and standing in
such course, and his relative chances
for employment or placement in the
activity for which he is preparing."
Commissioner Studebaker, in
view of the stand taken by Mr. Her
shey, urged university executives
and students concerned to not feel
reluctant to petition local boards
for deferment for both students and
teachers.
