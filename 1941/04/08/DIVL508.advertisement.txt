OLDEST
TRADITIONS
It started about 1899 when "Sticky Wilson was a
student at Stanford and was making his candies in his
first little shop right on the Campus. Stanford Co-Eds
started the custom of announcing their engagements by
passing a five-pound box of "Sticky's" candies at the
dinner table.
This custom has become a tradition at Stanford, and
the five-pound boxes of Wilson's Co-Ed Chocolates are
still being passed at dinner when engagements are an
nounced.
