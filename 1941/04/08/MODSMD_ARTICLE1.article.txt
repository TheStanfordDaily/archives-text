### Jean Nowell 
with rumor and conflict
ing viewpoints, the reports of
the two-day-old Battle of the Bal
kans clattered over the teletypes all
day yesterday. From Istanbul, Zu
rich, Athens, Berlin, London, and
Budapest, the words flashed in. But
there was no word from Belgrade—
the Yugoslavian capital, a city built
of wood, has been bombed five
times in the last two days. Berlin
says the city is in flaming ruins;
and in this case there is no reason
to doubt. Berlin's word.
Though very little concrcte in
formation lias really come through
in spite of the reams of copy on
the subject, it is clear that in most
instances the expected is happen
ing. The Nazi "panzer" divisions
driving down through the Hat
Croatian plain, though meeting
admittedly "stiff" resistance, are
going ahead and should occupy
the whole region, including Bel
grade, within a few weeks.
In Greece, they have reached the
shores of the Aegean and have cut
of! the Turks from the Greek forces.
This they were expected to do, and
the region was not particularly well
defended. The Greeks have dug in
in the mountains above the eastern
bank of the Struma River and are
going to make their stand there.

FIRST glance this cut-off ma
neuver looks bad for the anti-
Axis forces, but the fact that no
particular fight was put up by the
Greeks would indicate that Turkey,
if she declares war, will concentrate
on defensive action and give the
British access through the Darda
nelles to the Black Sea. The Brit
ish Navy would probably like noth
ing better than a chance to take a
few cracks at Bulgaria and Rumania
from behind.
Apparently the Greeks are hold
ing their lines in the Struma Val
ley proper. iThey admit losing
two forts and claim to have beaten
off a German attack on a third
fort. Athens reports that ihc two
forts fought to the last man. The
German communiques admit that
the going is tough, and the fact
that they have been using para
chute troops would indicate that
they cannot break the Greek
lines.
No information was given on the
German drive toward the Vardar
River Valley in Albania. If the Ger
mans haven't reported getting any
where they probably are really not
getting anywhere.

r | I HE German Luftwaffe blasted
away at both Yugoslavia and
Greece in an effort to break stub
born Greek and Yugoslav resistance.
The "fighting fool" Serbs of the
south slashed into Albania and took
the important city of Scutari. Up in
the north they siezed Zara, an Ital
ian port just five rrflles from their
border.
The Fascist forces arc in a tough
spot—and they're going to have
considerable difficulty getting out
of it. British naval units are un
doubtedly infesting the waters of
the Adriatic, and the advancing
Yugoslav and Greek forces arc
going to make it necessary for the
Italians to go home very soon—
unless the Germans can get across
the mountains, but quick.
Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria
are going to be in the war imme
diately, since it has been necessary
for British and Yugoslav planes to
bomb troop concentrations, supply
depots and communications in all
three countries.
The Battle of the Balkans has put
the Battle of Britain into the remote
possibility class, since Hitler cannot
possibly carry on a full-dress war on
two fronts. And time is fighting
with England. The Nazi press has
already warned the German people
that the rugged terrain is not going
to permit any blitzkrieg breeze in
the Balkans. Give Britain another
year and with United States help
she'll be outproducing the Germans.
