### 
"One of the outstanding Stanford personalities in the late '9()'s." That

emeritus, concerning Will Irwin, internationally famous reporter and grad
uate with the Class of '!)9, who will speak for the Tuesday Evening Series

Irwin and Dr. Swain were class- <
mates and lived just a few doors
from each other at Encina. "Bill,"
as Dr. Swain affectionately called
the reporter, was the leader among
his fellow students. He is the back
ground for many of the famous
legends about the freshman "barn."
Irwin's sparkling humor and re
markable talent for writing were
known and admired by all. Dr.
Swain related many touching and
humorous incidents with which Ir
win was always connected. Besides
being noted as a leader and humor
ist, Dr. Swain recalled that he pos
sessed a "world of sentiment and
sympathy."
After Irwin left Stanford he en
tered journalism as a career. He
became editor of the San Francisco
Wave, Sunday editor for the San
Francisco Chronicle, managing edi
tor of McClure's, and a writer for
Collier's. Besides being connected
with newspapers and magazines,

peace, and affairs, four novels, and
two plays.
Will Irwin has the information and
background of experience on which
to base his discussion of "Propa
ganda in the News" tonight. When
the United States government in
1918 found it advisable to establish
a Foreign Propaganda Service, Ir
win, because of his experience, was
called upon to organize the work.
He spent several months getting the
service going in o0 countries.
He believes that the forces of de
struction have a most potent weapon
in the perversion of journalism, but
it has not been until totalitarian
nations have showed what could be
done with a shut-your-mouth cen
sorship on one hand, and a complete
control of the press on the other,
that people have awakened to the
danger.

win, because of his experience, was
called upon to organize the work.
He spent several months getting the
service going in o0 countries.

struction have a most potent weapon
in the perversion of journalism, but
it has not been until totalitarian
nations have showed what could be
done with a shut-your-mouth cen
sorship on one hand, and a complete
control of the press on the other,
that people have awakened to the
danger.

legends about the freshman "barn."
Irwin's sparkling humor and re
markable talent for writing were
known and admired by all. Dr.
Swain related many touching and
humorous incidents with which Ir
win was always connected. Besides
