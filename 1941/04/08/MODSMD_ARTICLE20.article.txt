ATHENS, Tues., April 8 (UP).â€”
Greek forces on the Struma Valley
front have hurled back "vicious
German onslaughts" and destroyed
many Nazi tanks, the high command

reported early today as the Greeks
cheered news their Jugoslav allies
have invaded both Hungary and
Albania.
The Greek high command an
nounced it had abandoned western
Thrace, near the Turkish frontier, in
order to "avoid bloodshed" but two
Greek forts there still were holding
out to prevent the Germans from
moving heavy materials across the
territory.
