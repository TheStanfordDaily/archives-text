# Alarm Breaks Sunday Peace
## 
### 
The alarm sounds and the Sunday
peace in the Firehouse is shattered.
Seconds later four engines roll out
of the Firehouse heading for Box 13,
on Physics Corner, from whence the
alarm originated.
Box 13 indicates that the original
alarm has been sent from an aux
iliary box in the Museum, so the
trucks roar down the street. And
in 1 minute and 55 seconds the
trucks are in fire-fighting position
before the museum.
Not a fire, but Chief Dugan awaits
the crew to criticize the alarm
practice.
