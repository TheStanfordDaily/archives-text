# Farm Speakers Talk to 40,000
## Bureau Reorganized; Completes 6th Year 
### 
Covering every subject from :
"Chair Boys at the World's Fair" to
"What Lies Ahead in the Interna- 1
tional Sphere," the Stanford Speak
ers' Bureau is this year completing
its sixth successful year.
The special child of Charlie Sha
fer's brain, the Speakers' Bureau
was created way back in 1936 and
from slim beginnings has grown to I
be one of the most important or- [
ganizations on the campus. The
Bureau in its first year of existence
was entirely independent, but the
following year became affiliated
: with the A.S.S.U. and up to this
year has functioned under A.S.S.U.
auspices.
This year, however, under the j
leadership of Manager George Jack- !
son, the Bureau has been reorganized
and placed under the jurisdiction
of the Speech Department. This
move has been a notable success, as
the 40,000 people that members of
the Bureau have already spoken to
will testify.
The importance of the Bureau
cannot be overemphasized, for in
sending out an average of four
speakers a day to all types of clubs
and organizations in the Bay Area,
the Bureau is second only to the
football team in reaching the public.
The speakers, furthermore, receive
what, according to Jackson, is"for
the average student the most valu
! able experience proffered by the
University."
This year the reorganized Bureau
is meeting with its greatest success
yet. Including such able speakers
as Bruce Jessup, Art Gore, Bill Tur
ner, Hugh O'Donnell, Art Stoessel
