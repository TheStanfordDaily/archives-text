# Card Track Team Meets First Spring Competition Against San Jose Today
## 
### 
With oik- eye cocked on the weather report, Pitch Johnson sent his
Stanford track squad through its final practice yesterday afternoon in
preparation for today's dual meet with San Jose State. Rain forced post
ponement of the Spartan meet Saturday.
Stanford's new coach shattered precedent when he ordered the work-

out. The boys usually take it easy
on the day before a meet; but not
knowing where their next sunny day
is corning from, the coaching staff
can't afford to waste one clear after
noon.
The Indians will be heavy favor
ites to lick the* Spartans when the
two outfits collide at 4 o'clock out at
Angell Field. Situ Jose is a big ques
tion mark. The Spartans' first meet,
with Cal Poly, was rained out two
weeks ago and the boys have been
under wraps since the season
opened. Missing from the roster are
Tiekie Vasconcellos and Tony Sun
seri, two stars who formed the nu
cleus of the 1940 team.
If the newcomers live up to their
best marks, San Jose will have bal
ance in the field events. Roger Ro
rnines from Salinas J. C. has a mark
of 6 ft. 3 in. in the high jump and
.should give Stanford's trio of Vern
Hart, Jim Lincoln, and Ed Voss some
trouble. Ed Schneider, with a mark
of 13 ft., 3 in., may win the pole
vault and Larry O'Connor will take
points in the weights.
John Dierker, transfer from Sac
ramento J. C., took second in the
Class B javelin event at the Long
Beach Relays. His best mark is li) 0
feet, good enough for at least sec
ond against Stanford's Stone, Peni
nou, and Himovitz.
Jimmy Kerr heads the Spartan
runners. He's a sprinter with a 22.5
furlong to his credit. Fred Kmeto
vic, brother of Stanford's Pete,
leads the middle distance men, hav
ing been clocked in a shade under
2 minutes for the 880. A1 Ornelas
ran a 4:40 mile at Los Angeles City
College and should win points.
Badly in need of practice, Stan
ford wants to get rolling this after
noon to get a line on their chances
against the Olympic Club Saturday.

Badly in need of practice, Stan
ford wants to get rolling this after
noon to get a line on their chances
against the Olympic Club Saturday.
With oik- eye cocked on the weather report, Pitch Johnson sent his
Stanford track squad through its final practice yesterday afternoon in
preparation for today's dual meet with San Jose State. Rain forced post
ponement of the Spartan meet Saturday.
Stanford's new coach shattered precedent when he ordered the work-

out. The boys usually take it easy
on the day before a meet; but not
knowing where their next sunny day
is corning from, the coaching staff
can't afford to waste one clear after
noon.
The Indians will be heavy favor
ites to lick the* Spartans when the
two outfits collide at 4 o'clock out at
Angell Field. Situ Jose is a big ques
tion mark. The Spartans' first meet,
with Cal Poly, was rained out two
weeks ago and the boys have been
under wraps since the season
opened. Missing from the roster are
Tiekie Vasconcellos and Tony Sun
seri, two stars who formed the nu
cleus of the 1940 team.
If the newcomers live up to their
best marks, San Jose will have bal
ance in the field events. Roger Ro
rnines from Salinas J. C. has a mark
of 6 ft. 3 in. in the high jump and
.should give Stanford's trio of Vern
Hart, Jim Lincoln, and Ed Voss some
trouble. Ed Schneider, with a mark
of 13 ft., 3 in., may win the pole
vault and Larry O'Connor will take
points in the weights.
John Dierker, transfer from Sac
ramento J. C., took second in the
Class B javelin event at the Long
Beach Relays. His best mark is li) 0
feet, good enough for at least sec
ond against Stanford's Stone, Peni
nou, and Himovitz.
Jimmy Kerr heads the Spartan
runners. He's a sprinter with a 22.5
furlong to his credit. Fred Kmeto
vic, brother of Stanford's Pete,
leads the middle distance men, hav
ing been clocked in a shade under
2 minutes for the 880. A1 Ornelas
ran a 4:40 mile at Los Angeles City
College and should win points.
