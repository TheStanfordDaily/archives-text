# Golfers Scalp U.C.L.A., S.C.
## 
### 
Replacing their divots with Trojan
scalps and Bruin pelts the Stanford
golfing avalanche literally annihi
lated their two southern opponents
in Los Angeles last week-end.
On Friday, the Indian six engaged
U.S.C. at Cheviot Hills C. Câ€ž turn
ing them back 21 Va to s'/2. Bud
Finger's subpar 70 was the high
light of the day, although the whole
team displayed remarkable control
on a soggy, foreign course.
Not content with this perform
ance, the irate Indians surged across
town and encountered a weak
U.C.L.A. aggregation at Rancho C. C.
on Saturday morning. This time the
result was even worse, 24 to 3 to be
exact, and the remains of a badly
bruised Bruin limped back to West
wood for refuge. Stanford's aces
Bud Brownell and Captain Warren
Berl led the attack with G9.
This week-end the victory-mad
Redskins invade the lair of the Ber
keley Bear, and if the boys retain
their warmth of last week, look for
another Big Red victory. The boys
are hot this year.
The match originally scheduled
for Thursday with the University of
Oklahoma has been postponed in
definitely because Oklahoma officials
could see no reason for traveling
2000 miles across the continent to
get massacred by a band of Indians.
