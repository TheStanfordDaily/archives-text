# Frosh Trackmen Rained Out Again
## 
### 
For the fourth time, rain forced
Coach Clyde Jeffrey to call off one
of his freshman track meets. This
time it was the scheduled affair
last Saturday with the Contra Costa
County High School All-Stars that
was cancelled.
Unless another meet can be
scheduled, just two meets remain
before the Papoose cinder men wind
up their 1941 season against the
California freshmen either April 25
or 26 in the Little Big Meet. There
is a possibility that it may be run
off in conjunction with the Big
Meet Saturday afternoon instead of
the usual Friday afternoon.
