# Coaches Put Grid Neophytes Through First Practice Today
## 
### 
Starling with a chalk talk by members of the coaching stall yesterday
afternoon, Stanford's spring practice season will continue this afternoon
with the first of the 30 drills allowed by Pacific Coast Conference rules.
The meeting was conducted by Assistant Coaches Marchie Schwartz,
Phil Bengtson and Jim Lawson in the absence of Head Coach Clark

Shaughnessy, who was in Oakland
at an alumni conference. Only new
men were required to attend, as the
coaches explained the Stanford sys
tem of signals and a few of the
technical terms that these men will
be required to know.
Newspapers of colleges and uni
versities all up and down the Pacific
Coast have been prognosticating
various and sundry changes that
Coach Shaughnessy definitely will
make when the drills get started.
Some even go so far as to state that
the Stanford coach will do away
with the "T" formation entirely.
With this afternoon's session the
first on the list, it was announced
recently that field work will be done
on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday,
with regular chalk talks taking
place on Monday and Thursday. Due |
to the fact that the first two weeks
will be devoted almost entirely to
the fundamentals of the "T" forma
tion, only new men will report to
these drills, which will be secret.
With preliminary work out of the
way varsity men left over from the
Rose Bowl squad will I'eport for j
practice in two weeks.
