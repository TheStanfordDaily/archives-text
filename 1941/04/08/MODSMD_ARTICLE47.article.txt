# Cardinal Nine Preps for S.C.
## 
### 
While an invading Southern Cali
fornia nine tangles with Santa Clara
today, Stanford's varsity baseball
squad holds its last workout before
tomorrow's Indian-Trojan double
header on Sunken Diamond, first
game starting at 1:15 o'clock.
All the S.C. league-leaders need
-to do to stay in the top CIBA spot
is to win two out of their five games
this week, provided those two are
over California and Stanford. The
Cards, tied with Cal for second,
could creep into first place if they
dump the Trojans tomorrow and
U.C.L.A. Saturday.
IRON MAN VITALICH
And there is a 50-50 chance that
the leaders will drop one of their
remaining three games. For Ed
Vitalich, Sam Barry's one-man
mound sensation, has pitched every
one of the Trojans' five conference
victories during the past five weeks,
but this time the tight-fitting sched
ule means that the star hurler of
the S.C. throwing corps may be able
to see action only twice, possibly
pitching 12 or 14 innings of the
double-header tomorrow and against
Cal Saturday.
Bob Foltz, another Troy fiinger,
may turn out to be as good as Vita
lich and even better, for last Friday
he pitched an 11-4 win over the
Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific
Coast League. Though aided by 10
free passes given by Los Angeles
hurlers, Foltz pitched masterfully,
striking out three and allowing four
walks.
BOWMAN CATCHES
Doing the receiving job for the
Trojans is footballer Jerry Bowman,
and covering the initial sack is the
dependable veteran, Bruce Konopka.
Around the infield it's Frank Koski,
captain and leading hitter last year,
at second base; Merrill Combs, who
got two for four off the Angels, at
j shortstop, and Bud Dawson, who
I also connected twice in four trips
against Los Angeles, at third.
Back to Stanford — hopes will be
| pinned on Cootie Thompson and
I Claude Purkitt to turn back the
1 Troy big guns. First four men in
j the Cards' batting order. Alec Cere
; ghino, Monle Pl'yl, Boch Caruso, and
i Ace Hanlon, may get over their
j "slow-ball" trouble, encountered in
i the first Trojan game in which
| Vitalich pitched his mates to an 8-3
| victory. The slow tantalizer fooled
I the Red batters again and again,
and mixed with a smoking fast ball
and a sharp-breaking curve, Vita
lich's offerings were hard to get at
with any success. Hal Costello got
onto the Trojan ace for a home run
in the seventh inning of the first
| Trojan tilt but Troy's murderer's
! row had already done its work and
J the Indians lost.

While an invading Southern Cali
fornia nine tangles with Santa Clara
today, Stanford's varsity baseball
squad holds its last workout before
tomorrow's Indian-Trojan double
header on Sunken Diamond, first
game starting at 1:15 o'clock.
All the S.C. league-leaders need
-to do to stay in the top CIBA spot
is to win two out of their five games
this week, provided those two are
over California and Stanford. The
Cards, tied with Cal for second,
could creep into first place if they
dump the Trojans tomorrow and
U.C.L.A. Saturday.
IRON MAN VITALICH
And there is a 50-50 chance that
the leaders will drop one of their
remaining three games. For Ed
Vitalich, Sam Barry's one-man
mound sensation, has pitched every
one of the Trojans' five conference
victories during the past five weeks,
but this time the tight-fitting sched
ule means that the star hurler of
the S.C. throwing corps may be able
to see action only twice, possibly
pitching 12 or 14 innings of the
double-header tomorrow and against
Cal Saturday.
Bob Foltz, another Troy fiinger,
may turn out to be as good as Vita
lich and even better, for last Friday
he pitched an 11-4 win over the
Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific
Coast League. Though aided by 10
free passes given by Los Angeles
hurlers, Foltz pitched masterfully,
striking out three and allowing four
walks.
BOWMAN CATCHES
Doing the receiving job for the
Trojans is footballer Jerry Bowman,
and covering the initial sack is the
dependable veteran, Bruce Konopka.
Around the infield it's Frank Koski,
captain and leading hitter last year,
at second base; Merrill Combs, who
got two for four off the Angels, at
j shortstop, and Bud Dawson, who
I also connected twice in four trips
against Los Angeles, at third.
Back to Stanford — hopes will be
| pinned on Cootie Thompson and
I Claude Purkitt to turn back the
1 Troy big guns. First four men in
j the Cards' batting order. Alec Cere
; ghino, Monle Pl'yl, Boch Caruso, and
i Ace Hanlon, may get over their
j "slow-ball" trouble, encountered in
i the first Trojan game in which

Bob Foltz, another Troy fiinger,
may turn out to be as good as Vita
lich and even better, for last Friday
he pitched an 11-4 win over the
Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific
Coast League. Though aided by 10
free passes given by Los Angeles
hurlers, Foltz pitched masterfully,
striking out three and allowing four
walks.
BOWMAN CATCHES
Doing the receiving job for the
Trojans is footballer Jerry Bowman,
and covering the initial sack is the
dependable veteran, Bruce Konopka.
Around the infield it's Frank Koski,
captain and leading hitter last year,
at second base; Merrill Combs, who
got two for four off the Angels, at
j shortstop, and Bud Dawson, who
I also connected twice in four trips
against Los Angeles, at third.
Back to Stanford — hopes will be
| pinned on Cootie Thompson and
I Claude Purkitt to turn back the
1 Troy big guns. First four men in
j the Cards' batting order. Alec Cere
; ghino, Monle Pl'yl, Boch Caruso, and
i Ace Hanlon, may get over their
j "slow-ball" trouble, encountered in
i the first Trojan game in which
| Vitalich pitched his mates to an 8-3
| victory. The slow tantalizer fooled
I the Red batters again and again,
and mixed with a smoking fast ball
and a sharp-breaking curve, Vita
lich's offerings were hard to get at
with any success. Hal Costello got
onto the Trojan ace for a home run
in the seventh inning of the first
| Trojan tilt but Troy's murderer's
! row had already done its work and
J the Indians lost.
