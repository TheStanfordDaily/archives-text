# Plot Threatens Soph Carnival
## 
### 
Sabotage against the Convalescent
Home Drive, the sophomore class
and Stanford as a whole will be ex
posed by the Class of '43 at the an
ual Sophomore Carnival to be held
a week from Friday, April 18, in
the Pavilion.
As the first attack in the blitzkrieg
known as the Convalescent Home
Drive, the carnival will carry out
the idea of fifth-column activity.
Posters, slogans and cartoons will
direct a tirade against the junior
class and Cal, principally, as or
ganizations attempting to under
mine the success of the drive for
the kiddies and other Stanford ac
tivities.
Some concessions may carry out
the theme, according to Frank
Baumau, carnival publicity chair
man. Each fraternity, sorority, hall,
and eating club will sponsor a con
cession. Egg and pie throwing,
games of chance, games of skill and
eats from hot dogs to popcorn will
contribute to the fun as well as
bring in dimes.
Profits derived from the carnival
will constitute the first drop in the
bucket for the benefit of the Con
valescent Home.
