# Freshman Nine Wins, Battles Berkeley Today
## 
### 
Errors, walks, and the three-hit
hurling of Stanford's Don Pender
grass yesterday played a major role
in the pitchers' duel in which the
frosh hasehall squad defeated Chico
High. 5-1. Although Chico's Boh
Maddux gave up only one more
safety than Pendergrass. frequent
walks and errors in lidding gave
the Farm yearlings their four-run
advantage. The '44 basehallers to
day face Berkeley High at 3:15 o'-
clock on the Freshman Diamond.
Stanford's initial run in yester
day's tilt came in the second frame
on Ward Walkup's single after Mad
dux had walked two men.
Big inning lor (he Farm frosh was
the third. Pendergrass opened the
frame by going to second on an error,
scoring on Bob Mitchell's long single
to left field. After Maddux had
passed another man, Bob Koch, first
baseman, drove out a smashing sin
gle to bring in two more tallies.
Koch stole second and then crossed
the plate on Harry Reichling's out
of-reach drive to left, to bring the
scoring for the inning and for the
game to a close.
In addition to driving in a run in
the third, Mitchell connected with
one of Maddux's tosses for a three
bagger in the fifth. Pendergrass
fanned nine men during the game,
including three in the final frame.
Larry *Wolf will probably see ac
tion as starting hurler in today's
fray with the Berkeley prepsters.
Otherwise, the lineup is tentatively
the same as that which faced Chico
yesterday.
Repeated surveys show that nei
ther the Halls nor the Row votes
anywhere near "solid."
