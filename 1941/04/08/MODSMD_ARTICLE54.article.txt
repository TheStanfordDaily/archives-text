# Naval R.O.T.C. No. 2
## 
### 
IN the hubba-hubba of Farm political furor, one
other key local topic is persistently remain
ing close to the surface throughout bull sessions.
The topic of a Naval R.O.T.C. for the Farm.
Rising each year like the Phoenix it emulates,
this subject over at least the past four-year pe
riod has furnished the meat for a hoped-for plan
which has never quite met with complete ap
proval.
This year, spurred on by international con
ditions and by the news that naval authorities
will establish only eight more such institutions,
discussion has reached new heights on the
campus with information that the eight units will
be selected within the next month.
It's a question of now or never.
Encina men took the bit in their teeth early
this year with a poll among fellow freshmen
which showed conclusively that Farm first year
men, at least, are overwhelmingly in favor of
such a unit on campus. Following considerable
comment, Excom took the dream-child to its
arms, tacitly approved further consideration of
the project.
Student leaders, who hope to bring the Naval
R.O.T.C. situation to a head before naval dead
lines preclude establishment of a unit, now are
working for a definite show of approbation from
the student body.
Unless Encinamen and their older Row-Hall
brothers sincerely desire such a plan, there will
never be a Neval R.O.T.C. on the Farm.
Arguments for the establishment of a unit
have been discussed almost to the saturation
point. Arguments against boil down to the one
fact:
Will an enrollment the size of Stanford's be
able to support both a Naval R.O.T.C. and the
Army R.O.T.C. now firmly established here?
Which boils further down to:
Do Stanford men want a Naval R.O. unit?
Do you?
