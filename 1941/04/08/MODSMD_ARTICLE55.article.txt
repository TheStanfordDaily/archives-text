# 1917 Rehash?

### 
DURING the last war a powerful Committee
on Public Information practically controlled
the action of the press with regard to war news.
Actually they used the laws which were theirs
only as a veiled threat to papers which would
not fall into line. Personal rebukes from George
Creel, head of the C.P.1., were usually enough
for such papers.
The matter of press censorship is one vital
to the interests of democracy and it is arising
again.
Last night United Press sent through the fol
lowing dispatch under a New York dateline:
The Daily News, which today published a
detailed story of the arrival of a British war
ship in the United States, tomorrow (Tuesday)
will publish an editor's note suggesting "to
the government that it put into effect an offi
cial censorship; that it issue definite orders,
not requests, as to what may be printed and
what may not."
The statement will be run above a story
headlined "Crowds View British Warship"
and was described by the News as the result
of a statement in Washington by Secretary of
the Navy Frank Knox commending those news
organizations which withheld information on
"the recent arrival of a British warship in this
country."
We would be led to believe from this story
that a British ship did arrive in a port of this
country; that the Secretary of the Navy, for rea
sons best known to himself, did request the
press of the nation not to print any such in
formation, and that the New York Daily News
did print the forbidden information contrary to
the request of the government.
It is not very often that a newspaper advo
cates press censorship, much less a newspaper
like the Daily News which has the largest cir
culation in the country.
It must therefore be assumed that the Daily
News is not really asking for government cen
sorship, but is actually trying to bring out into
the open a makeshift method apparently utilized
by the Secretary of the Navy for the withholding
of news from the people.
America has not yet reached that super-pa
triotic pitch of 1918 when a request was enough
to kill a hot story.
But our entanglement in European affairs has
seemingly reached the point where the govern

ment rightly finds it necessary "for the common
good" to keep the public from learning certain
facts.
What the ultra-sensational Daily News is try
ing to do is to bring the matter to the fore where
it can enjoy public discussion.
And what will probably happen will be a re
enactment of the fight of 1917. Congress will
tackle the matter amid terrific howls of "free
dom of the press" from the "Fourth Estate."
Congress will long-windedly appease the press
until patriotic fervor overwhelms the nation.
Then Congress will slip the censorship proposal
in some other national defense measure and the
papers will never notice it.
That is what happened in 1917 and that is
what the Daily News is trying to settle now
while there is still some semblance of sane
thinking throughout the country.â€”C. B.
