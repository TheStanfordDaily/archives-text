### JERRY MAYER 
ODE TO CULTURE
JJULL SESSION decided to get down to brass tacks
the other night. "I,' this with a grandiloquent
expression, and a majestic roll of my beautiful fal
setto voice, "am going to hear Nino Bacardi tonight,"
I told to my scoffing roommates.
Haw," they said as one (come to think of it ,there
was only one there. The rest had gone out for a
short beer), "you are an oaf. You definitely will not
fit in with the concert crowd. You will not under
stand the great artist because his talent is so far above
your comprehension. You cannot get a ticket at this
late date. Besides, you lumpenhund, his name is
Martini."
Armed with all this information I approachejl con
fidently to the A.S.S.U. office to demand a ticket. I
pounded on the window, I bellowed at the top of my
lungs, I stuck out my tongue. "Give me a ticket,"
I screamed.
"Shoot-, Cupie," said Stevie and Aten. I ran like
hell. It had never occurred to me that there might
be tickets for sale. It was the closest thing to a trap
I had ever wandered into. Imagine, paying to hear
some bird-seed tenor warble when my cousin who
goes to the University of Missouri is going to get a
whole album of classical music for his thirty-second
birthday.
* * * #
£ APPLIED for an ushering job, which I received be
cause of my interest in music, my knowledge of
opera, my fine reputation, my efficient manner, and
because the head usher is my best friend.
It was marvelous. "Blue tickets are here, orange
are here, and green back here," the head usher told
me, and disappeared down the neck of a bottle like
a geni. It is obvious what happened. Being color
blind I got things a little mixed up. It wasn't so bad
that three rows had absolutely no people in them, but
the Concert Series manager really got angry when
another row had three customers in every seat.
"That's the worst thing I've ever seen," she said.
"What's the idea of putting the Stanford students on
the bottom."
* * * *
JJAQUIRI, or Collins, or Martini, or whatever his
name was, was fine. Things were going along ex
cellently. I clapped at the right times. 1 yawned just
enough to appear sophisticated. But things really
blew up when Miguel Sandoval, the accompanist,
rapped out a couple of hot numbers on his own. The
crowd applauded vociferously because they thought he
was through. Old Sandoval thought they wanted an
encore.
"This is a gavotte by Mushky-Beanstock," he an
nounced. The crowd went wild. "I mean, by Sliversky-
Gotrockberg." It is a good thing he corrected him
self. I was just about to picket the joint. For many
years, I have felt that Sliversky-Gotrockberg was the
finest gavotte-writer in the business. His famous ga
votte from the Danse Dinosaurus is a classic of its
kind. To think that Sandoval had almost given credit
to Mushy-Beanstoek, whose gavottes are definitely
second-rate, was almost too much to hear. That crowd
might not have known the difference, but being an old
expert of the gavotte I would have known. And there
would have been hell to pay.
But I must admit that Martini pleased me im
mensely. The only thing missing was an olive.

birthday.
* * * #
£ APPLIED for an ushering job, which I received be
cause of my interest in music, my knowledge of
opera, my fine reputation, my efficient manner, and
because the head usher is my best friend.
It was marvelous. "Blue tickets are here, orange
are here, and green back here," the head usher told
me, and disappeared down the neck of a bottle like
a geni. It is obvious what happened. Being color
blind I got things a little mixed up. It wasn't so bad
that three rows had absolutely no people in them, but
the Concert Series manager really got angry when
another row had three customers in every seat.
"That's the worst thing I've ever seen," she said.
"What's the idea of putting the Stanford students on
the bottom."
* * * *
JJAQUIRI, or Collins, or Martini, or whatever his
name was, was fine. Things were going along ex
cellently. I clapped at the right times. 1 yawned just
enough to appear sophisticated. But things really
blew up when Miguel Sandoval, the accompanist,
rapped out a couple of hot numbers on his own. The
crowd applauded vociferously because they thought he
was through. Old Sandoval thought they wanted an
encore.
"This is a gavotte by Mushky-Beanstock," he an
nounced. The crowd went wild. "I mean, by Sliversky-
Gotrockberg." It is a good thing he corrected him
self. I was just about to picket the joint. For many
years, I have felt that Sliversky-Gotrockberg was the
finest gavotte-writer in the business. His famous ga
votte from the Danse Dinosaurus is a classic of its
kind. To think that Sandoval had almost given credit
to Mushy-Beanstoek, whose gavottes are definitely
second-rate, was almost too much to hear. That crowd
might not have known the difference, but being an old
expert of the gavotte I would have known. And there
would have been hell to pay.
But I must admit that Martini pleased me im
mensely. The only thing missing was an olive.
ODE TO CULTURE
JJULL SESSION decided to get down to brass tacks
the other night. "I,' this with a grandiloquent
expression, and a majestic roll of my beautiful fal
setto voice, "am going to hear Nino Bacardi tonight,"
I told to my scoffing roommates.
Haw," they said as one (come to think of it ,there
was only one there. The rest had gone out for a
short beer), "you are an oaf. You definitely will not
fit in with the concert crowd. You will not under
stand the great artist because his talent is so far above
your comprehension. You cannot get a ticket at this
late date. Besides, you lumpenhund, his name is
Martini."
Armed with all this information I approachejl con
fidently to the A.S.S.U. office to demand a ticket. I
pounded on the window, I bellowed at the top of my
lungs, I stuck out my tongue. "Give me a ticket,"
I screamed.
"Shoot-, Cupie," said Stevie and Aten. I ran like
hell. It had never occurred to me that there might
be tickets for sale. It was the closest thing to a trap
I had ever wandered into. Imagine, paying to hear
some bird-seed tenor warble when my cousin who
goes to the University of Missouri is going to get a
whole album of classical music for his thirty-second
birthday.
