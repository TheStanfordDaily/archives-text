## BEAUTY AND THE BRAIN

EDITOR, SIR:
The female of the species is forever cornering the
desirable things of life. But in most instances her
generous (and selfish) motives prompt her to share the
sought-after with the male.
This happy circumstance, however, does not seem
to apply to the badminton courts in the Women's Gym.
It would seem to require a modicum of executive
ability to see that the Women's Gym is open every
Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock. This feat might even
be accomplished by two conscientious people with their
bare hands. But when a whole staff of women with
such modern conveniences as keys, telephones, auto
mobiles, and, in some cases, even brains fail to solve
this simple puzzle, what are we to think?
The Good Lord seems to have concentrated a maxi
mum of beauty into a minimum of mentality.
And think—some have suggested a place for women
in national defense!
