T<HE EDITOR, SIR:
With sincere respect for Mr. Bull's personal rea
sons for the draft policy he advocates in The Daily
editorial columns, 1 believe it represents a very nar
row point of view. His stand that college students
should be deferred from army service is the voice of
a small interest group opposed to the immediate in
terest of the nation as a whole in effecting thorough
preparation for hemisphere defense.
Whether drafting of college students is morally
right or wrong in terms of the general intelligence of
American manhood in the long run is beside the point.
That intelligence wouldn't do America much good if
she were dominated by dictators.
College students are being drafted to meet an
emergency for which American public opinion de
mands support from every walk of life. Their defer
ment would, to say the least, present an insidious
comparison.
It is no harder for collegd men to finish their edu
cation after a year in the army than for business men
to regain their customers after a year's training.
One point I must grant to Mr. Bull. The admin
istration of the Selective Service Act is clearly not
what it was cracked up to be. If we are to judge
defense efficacy by the placement of specialized men
in specialized jobs, American administrators haven't
learned much from the lessons of the last war.
Signed as Mr. Mayer would put it.
