# Players Romp, Lure Through Naughty 'Eve'
## 
### 
"THE LADY EVE," coining to the
Stanford Theater Saturday.
For his third Hollywood writing
directing effort Preston Sturges has
tossed together an entertaining bit
of froth and filth pleasingly titled,
for several obvious reasons, "The
Lady Eve."
Barbara Stanwyck and Henry
Fonda as the romantic-comic leads
and a fine cast of able supporting
players are chased through a se
quence of amusing and sometimes
confusing incidents that Mr. Sturges
dreamed up to form the substance
of quote The Lady Eve unquote
again.
Miss Stanwyck starts out as the
daughter of an international card
sharp. Mr. Fonda starts out as the
son of Pike's Ale, The Ale that Won
for Yale, Rah, Rah, Rah. He has
been up the Amazon for a year,
hunting snakes.
Seduction rears its ugly head
once or twice between gags and
comic situations as Miss Stanwyck
helps smooth the road for her
father's manipulations of the cold
deck.
Nevertheless, her performance in
the title role is very good. Her tim
ing in comedy situations is excel
lent, and that ol' debil Brooklyn
accent only crops up once or twice,
a vast improvement over some of
her pictures. Mr. Fonda is, if any
thing, too convincing as the more
or-less righteous Ale heir.
"The Lady Eve" is a fine comedy,
more than worth anybody's time
and money.â€”Brucker
