### 
After stoking the fires of public sentiment for over a month to get up
steam in favor of their plan, Stanford student leaders will weigh anchor
some time this week with hopes of establishing a Naval Reserve Ofliccrs
Training Corps on the Farm.
With their course plotted to bear down on a full four-year training
program to include "everything from pins to battleships," lor which Lni-

versity credit probably would
given, the potential skippers will ask
a definite show of student approba
tion before presenting the plan to
the Administration.

Fostered by Lieut,. Howard W.
Wright, '15, U.S.N., Ret., and his son,
Howard, Jr., now an Encinaman, the
plan has spread through Encina and
reached the attention of Ex Com
mittee, which will discuss the pro
posal again tonight. Lieut. Wright,
a Los Angeles attorney, is chairman
of Naval Affairs for the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce.
The suggestion was made to Ex
com late in Winter Quarter by Bill
Turner, Student Emergency Defense
Council head, now in Washington,
D.C., to confer with President Frank
lin D. Roosevelt in connection with
student aid to Britain.
JESSUP COMMENTS
"I am very heartily in favor of the
establishment of such a unit if it's
at all possible and feasible," com
mented Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. pres
ident, yesterday. He plans to inter
view Capt. Barker of the University
of California unit and Capt. Godkin
of the 11th Naval District in this
respect tomorrow.
Virtually to enable a graduate
deck officer "to navigate a combat
ant ship and handle its personnel,"
the course would cover a four-year
period "because of the mathemat
ical nature of nautical astronomy
and the breadth of the field," accord
ing to information received from
the Navy Department. Most import
ant courses would include seaman
ship, astronomy (navigation), ord
nance and gunnery, and a summer
training cruise of 24 days.
