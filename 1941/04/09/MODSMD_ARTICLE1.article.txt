WO FAR the Germans are doing a
k magnificent job in their drives on
Yugoslavia and Greece. Their com
muniques (German army commu
niques established a record for ac
curacy during the invasion of France
which incidentally was not shared
by the navy and air force) list gains
on all fronts although they admit
encountering "fierce" resistance.
But the Nazis said several times
that they had not as yet encoun
tered any of the large British
forces now stationed in Greece.
That fact is just about the only
ray of light in a situation which
looks distinctly gloomy for both
the Greeks and the Yugoslavs.
The R.A.F. has been in action
since the first hour the Germans
marched, but if the British land
forces have not yet been engaged, it
is because (he Germans have not yet
reached the prepared positions pre
viously agreed upon by the Greek
and British high commands.

r l ''HE Germans drove on Salonika
early yesterday in a three
pronged attack down the Vardar
Valley from Ghevgheli pass, down
from Lake Dorian on the Yugoslav
frontier and in from the Rupel pass
along the Struma Valley at the
Greek-Bulgarian border.
When the Yugoslavs, defending
their part of the Vardar, collapsed
before the lightning German at
tack. the whole Greek flank was
left exposed and it would have
been next to impossible to hold
the territory, since the Germans
had the Greeks terrifically out
numbered.
Athens communiques while admit
ting the gravity of the situation, still
claim that the abandonment of the
whole of Thrace and western Mace
donia had been expected. (Late last
night it was announced that all
Greek forces east of Salonika are
trapped and that the Germans are
within 23 miles of Salonika itself.)

Jj F THERE are no British in Salo
nika, then it would seem that the
historically strategic city is not con
sidered as important as it once was,
probably because of the increased
effectiveness of air warfare.
Besides the British naval and air
force based on the island of Lem
nos in the Aegean are probably in a
fairly good position to defend the
Dardanelles and harry the Germans
in Salonika.
All the evidence seems to indi
cate that the big attempt to halt
the slashing German advance will
he made by the British and
Greeks in prepared positions east
of the Vardar. Watch for it.
Still the unexpected crumpling of
the Serbs has accomplished two
things. First, the Yugoslavs are now
cut off from Greek and British aid,
and second, the Germans may be
able to get into Albania and bolster
up the Duce's reeling forces. But
the Serbs may be able to rally to
stop this drive, because there are
still more mountains to be crossed.

r I I HE abandonment of the west
Vardar region has not however
been a complete route. Most of the
rear-guard fighting in that region
has been done by shock troops, ac
cording to Athens, and they have
certainly not given a bad account
of themselves. North of Kilkis at
the head of the Greek part of the
Vardar, they have taken back two
forts lost to the Germans earlier in
the week.
Up in the Struma Valley region
and on the Nevrokop plateau, the
Greek forces "violently threw
hack" massive assaults by German
tanks, artillery and planes, one
government spokesman said.
Grimmest fighting was going on
around the Kupcl Pass where the
Greeks claim to have held stub
bornly in the so-called Mctaxas
Lineâ€”a chain of forts.
The Yugoslavs continued their
drive into Albania, taking another
city. If they can get the Italians out
before Germany gets in, the Yugo
slavs may get material aid from
Greece, Britain, and the United
States through that country.
