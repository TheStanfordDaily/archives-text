# Strikes Slow Defense, Says Farm Expert

'The curve of time lost on account
of strikes continues to point steadily
upward. With probably three-quar
ters of a million man-days lost per
month during the first three months
of this year, the time lost in April
will be materially increased as a re
sult of the soft coal strike.
Each day that the bituminous
mines are closed represents lost
time equivalent to about six weeks
at such a plant as the Allis-Chal
mers Company where the strike
was settled on April 7.
BLOW TO DEFENSE
Should the threatened strike at
the U. S. Steel Corporation be called
April 16, the time lost on account of
strikes would climb very sharply
upward as this company has more
than 200,000 employees. The Ford
Company strike is apparently af
fecting about an equal number of
men of whom about one-half are
direct employees of the Ford Com
pany and the other half are employ
ees of companies manufacturing
parts for Ford.
These large strikes materially in
crease the statistical importance of
the lost time problem, and the con
tinuation of any of them for an ap-
preciable length of time will create
a really serious blow to the defense
program.
Up to the first of April, however,
it may be said that considered
purely from the standpoint of the
number of man-days lost, the strike
picture was not a serious one. There
have been several years since 1933
when lost time on account of strikes
has materially exceeded the record
of the first quarter of this year. This,
however, is not the only measure of
the importance of the strike prob
lem.
A strike in a small but vital plant
can seriously affect the whole de
fense program even though it con
tributes a comparatively small por
tion of the total time lost. There
have been strikes of this character
since the first of the year and it
seems certain that the present con
tinued increase in the number of
strikes cannot help but affect plantb
of this category as well as larger
establishments where the effect on
the defense program is more ob
vious.
STRIK K CLA SSI FI CATIONS
These defense industry strikes
generally can be classified under
five heads: economic strikes, polit
ical strikes, ideological strikes, or
ganizational strikes, and protest
strikes.
A strike involving questions of
wages or hours without other ele
ments involved is an economic strike.
The machinists' strike in San Fran
cisco was of this character.
A political strike is one in which
the leaders of a union are, in effect,
defying the public authorities in
order to demonstrate their strength
and power. The bus strike in New
York and the soft coal strike are of
this sort.

Up to the first of April, however,
it may be said that considered
purely from the standpoint of the
number of man-days lost, the strike
picture was not a serious one. There

has materially exceeded the record
of the first quarter of this year. This,

A strike in a small but vital plant
can seriously affect the whole de

tributes a comparatively small por

have been strikes of this character
since the first of the year and it
seems certain that the present con
tinued increase in the number of
strikes cannot help but affect plantb
of this category as well as larger
establishments where the effect on
the defense program is more ob
vious.
STRIK K CLA SSI FI CATIONS
These defense industry strikes
generally can be classified under
five heads: economic strikes, polit
ical strikes, ideological strikes, or
ganizational strikes, and protest
strikes.
A strike involving questions of
wages or hours without other ele
ments involved is an economic strike.
The machinists' strike in San Fran
cisco was of this character.
A political strike is one in which
the leaders of a union are, in effect,
defying the public authorities in
order to demonstrate their strength
and power. The bus strike in New
York and the soft coal strike are of
this sort.

'The curve of time lost on account
of strikes continues to point steadily
upward. With probably three-quar
ters of a million man-days lost per
month during the first three months
of this year, the time lost in April
will be materially increased as a re

Each day that the bituminous
mines are closed represents lost
time equivalent to about six weeks

Should the threatened strike at
the U. S. Steel Corporation be called

Company strike is apparently af
fecting about an equal number of
men of whom about one-half are
direct employees of the Ford Com

parts for Ford.
