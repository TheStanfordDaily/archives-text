# 'Police' Chaparral Out This Morning
## 
### 
"The Ballad of the Roguish Po
liceman," a saga dedicated to the
San Francisco police by Ed Hutshing
with illustrations by Reiser, com
prises one of the outstanding fea
tures of the April issue of the Stan
ford Chaparral which comes out this
morning.
The cover of this number was
done by Ed McLellan and was
printed by a new color process which
is the most complex printing of such
a type that the Chappie has ever
done. Other art features are two
police cartoons by Hurt and Reiser
and a two-page spread of the best
cartoons from other college humor
magazines.
In the way of articles the Chappie
offers one on ways and means to
evade the government draft and, be
cause of its increased popularity,
twice the usual number of Fables
of the Farm. "Consumer Produc
tion" by Barney MeClure, and
"Death by Frustration," by Max
Meyers, plus the usual exchange
gems, complete the issue.
