# Newspaperman Stresses Need Of Free Press
## Will Irwin Lectures To Series Audience On News Propaganda 
### 
Advising, t;he American people
"to watch out for their institution
of the freedom of the press and to
keep it as free as they can," Will
Irwin, noted reporter, spoke for the
Tuesday Series last night on "Prop
aganda in the News."
PROPAGANDA EFFECTS
Irwin called himself a "perplexed
guide to the perplexed*' in trying to
define and tell about the effects of
propaganda. He gave the audience
three places and ways in which
propaganda can be presented to the
public. First, he advised the read
ing of pamphlets with care. He gave
special warning concerning those
pamphlets which claim to dispense
great chunks of information.
Citing several examples with
which he personally was connected,
the journalist named rumors as the
second danger spot. As a third item,
radio, according to Irwin, is the new
est yet most powerful organ in the
dispensation of propaganda. While
writing as in newspapers is wired to
the rnind, sound as in the radio is
connected with ihe emotions. Radio
has its dangers, he claimed, which
is realized by the owners of the
great broadcasting chains. He ad
vised the public to read in the news
papers the news they hear over the
radio before forming any definite
opinions.
ORIGIN OF JOURNALISM
Irwin traced the origin of jour
nalism in the United States and its
influence on the reading public. He
also compared the American news
paper style with that of continental
Europe and England.
"One of the great causes of the
French collapse was the corruption
of French papers," ho pointed out.
"The British press, on the other
hand, is the best in Europe. But a
newcomer to English journalism has
to spend about two years learning
the country's libel laws."
Irwin said that in any war there
are really two battles being waged,
"a war above ground fought with
guns and shells where men die, and
the war below ground fought with
paper and pen where men lie."
Commenting on this type of jour
nalism either during peace or war
time, he stated, "It is amazing, but
if you have a state of Iree journal
ism in a country, propaganda
cleanses itself out of Ihe stream of
public thought."
NEWSPAPER POLICY
He told how the policy of Ameri
can newspapers has changed in the
past fifty years. Formerly the edi
tors tried to influence public opin
ion through the editorial columns;
now they know they have a more
powerful weapon in their selection
of news. Irwin claimed that the edi-,
tors, by their selection of news, help
to mold the minds of the public in
relation to contemporary affairs.
He also showed how the meaning
of the word propaganda has changed
since 1914. "It is an unfortunate
word," he said. "Formerly it was
the means one used to advance opin
ion. Now the word means the jug
gling or slighting of the truth."
The Class of 1937 dedicated the
Laurence Frost Amphitheater with
its commencement.
