Ex Committee donned its Boathousc togs and dived into Spring Quarter
plans with a cold splash last night when it surveyed plans for a "Water
Extravaganza" May 14, to he sponsored by the senior class in connection
with Stanford's 50th Anniversary celebrations.
A women's aquacade, log-rolling tussles and a lighted canoe parade

in varied colors would feature
night show on Lake Lagunita, pro
posed by Art Gore, senior president
and student chairman for anniver
sary celebrations, through Bruce
Jessup, A.S.S.U. president.
Dana Winters threw in his senti
ments with, "It's going to be colder'n
heck out there. I was swimming
out there at night last year and
split my head on an ice cube." The
proposed affair would replace the
Junior Water Carnival. Other busi
ness follows:
SPECIAL ASSEMBLY: A spe
cially-scheduled election assembly
to introduce candidates for the
spring A.S.S.U. elections will be
held next Monday from 9:45 to
10:15 o'clock, with all 9 o'clocks dis
missed.
SUNDAY NIGIIT MOVIES: A
proposal by Anne Townsend,
A.S.S.U. vice-president, to show
Sunday night movies on the campus
was considered after she pointed out
profits would help pay off the Boat
house debt.
While "A.T." proved she not only
can be a vice-president but also a
"tie-up artist," by becoming com
pletely befuddled, she put across the
point that cartoons can be secured
"cheap as dirt, even as low as $1.50."

were granted to Robert Hall, Joe
Messina, Gabriel Davalos, ' and
