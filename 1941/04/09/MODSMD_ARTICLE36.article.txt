# B.A.C. Picks Net Coach
## Tennis Pro Takes Over Card Forces 
### 
John Lamb, former tennis pro at
the El Mirador Hotel in Palm
Springs, was yesterday appointed
coach of the Stanford varsity net
men for the remainder of the year.
I-amb will replace Marchie Schwartz
who took over the team temporarily.
Schwartz is now occupied with
spring football.
Lamb, who is 25 years old, at
tended the University of Southern
California, and has been coaching
tennis for six years. Besides being
at Palm Springs, Lamb also worked
as a pro at the Denver Country
Club in Denver during the summer
months. The new coach is married
and has a one-year-old daughter.
Meanwhile the varsity netmen
went back to work in anticipation
of the Trojan, Bruin matches this
week-end. The Cards take on
U.S.C. for the second time this sea
son on Friday at 2 o'clock, and the
Brains on Saturday afternoon.
Coach Lamb stated that he has been
trying to have the second match
with the Bruins played next Mon
day, to make up for last week's
postponement.
Although it seems that the Trojans
are on the inside track for the con
ference championship, the Cards
have a good chance to upset them
Friday. Everyone on the team is
gunning for the Trojans and the
boys think they can pull out a win.
