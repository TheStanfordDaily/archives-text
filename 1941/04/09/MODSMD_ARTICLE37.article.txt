# Coaches Slate Grid Workout
## 
### 
With the first field workout of the
season past, Stanford's version of
the 1941 Model will again take
the field this afternoon in another
of the ,']() practice sessions allowed
to them by Pacific Coast Conference
rules. As will he the usual case, this
session will he secret.
Starting the drill, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy told his players that
spring practice would consist of a
lot of heavy contact work and scrim
mages, and urged all players to get
into condition before the heavy
work starts.
STIFF DRILL
Starting the practice with a stiff
calisthenics drill, the squad was
split up into three groups, and with
backfield candidates doing the pass
ing, went through a series of short
pasr.es for about half an hour, The
work of Bob Crane, reserve on the
Rose Bowl squad, and Bob Koch
and Frankie Forbes, up from the un
defeated frosh team, was particu
larly outstanding during this period,
along with some commendable pass
ing by Jack Barkley, another re
turning veteran of the Rose Bowl
tnam.
With several separate backfields
working under the direction of
Marchie Schwartz, it was again
Forbes who caught the eye. Filling
in the quarterback spot, he looked
as if he had been playing the posi
tion for years as he faked and passed
with the skill of a veteran.
WINK JONES RETURNS
The return of Winkie Jones bol
stered up the weakened tackle po
sitions. A veteran of the '39 cam
paign, Jones dropped out of school
last fall and has just returned to
make a strong bid for one of the
starting posts, while Bill Joslyn, a
guard on the last frosh aggregation,
but who has elected to try out for
one of the end posts this year,
looked rather good on the receiving
end of some of Forbes' short passes.
Fast for a big man, Joslyn looks as
if he will make a strong bid for one
of the starting spots.
Barring threatened rain, another
field drill will be held this afternoon
for the 61 men that greeted Coach
Shaughnessy at the beginning of the
workout yesterday, with the second
in the series of blackboard talks
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon at
4:30 o'clock.

STIFF DRILL
Starting the practice with a stiff
calisthenics drill, the squad was
split up into three groups, and with
backfield candidates doing the pass
ing, went through a series of short
pasr.es for about half an hour, The
work of Bob Crane, reserve on the
Rose Bowl squad, and Bob Koch
and Frankie Forbes, up from the un
defeated frosh team, was particu
larly outstanding during this period,
along with some commendable pass
ing by Jack Barkley, another re
turning veteran of the Rose Bowl
tnam.
With several separate backfields
working under the direction of
Marchie Schwartz, it was again
Forbes who caught the eye. Filling
in the quarterback spot, he looked
as if he had been playing the posi
tion for years as he faked and passed
with the skill of a veteran.
WINK JONES RETURNS
The return of Winkie Jones bol
stered up the weakened tackle po
sitions. A veteran of the '39 cam
paign, Jones dropped out of school
last fall and has just returned to
make a strong bid for one of the
starting posts, while Bill Joslyn, a
guard on the last frosh aggregation,
but who has elected to try out for
one of the end posts this year,
looked rather good on the receiving
end of some of Forbes' short passes.
Fast for a big man, Joslyn looks as
if he will make a strong bid for one
of the starting spots.
Barring threatened rain, another
field drill will be held this afternoon
for the 61 men that greeted Coach
Shaughnessy at the beginning of the
