# Frosh Mermen To Meet Paly
## 
### 
Thursday afternoon Stanford's
freshman swimmers will meet the
mermen from Palo Alto High at 4
o'clock. The meet will be held in
I the Encina Pools and is open to men
! only.
Captain Ted Munroe of Stanford
is going to have plenty of competi
tion from Jim Armstrong of Palo
Alto in the 220 r yard freestyle. Mun
roe is the frosh's best distance swim
j mer and combines beautiful form
with plenty of power to produce his
remarkable speed.
RULE FAVORED
Counted on to win the 50-yard
{ freestyle for the Indians is long,
lanky Rey Rule, a comparative new
comer to the swimming game. Rule
started out the season without much
besides arms and legs but has devel
oped into one of the better fresh
man swimmers in the bay region.
Tod Gardner and Bob Hind are
Stanford's hopes .in the breast stroke.
Gardner has proved a real asset to
the team this year, always coming
through when he was needed most.
Hind did not turn out for swim
ming until quite recently which is,
in a way, too bad, for he has the
build to develop into a top-notch
swimmer. This last week of prac
tice should have cut his time con
siderably.
BEST BACKSTROKER
Pete Lee is Stanford's best back
stroker. He will no doubt do as well
as usual, which should be good
enough for the boys from Paly.
As usual, the freshmen have no
one worthy of being called a diver
so they start the meet with an ini
tial handicap of 8 points. So far this
season, this has made no vital dif
ference in the final outcome of any
one meet, but the score would cer
tainly look better if those 8 points
were stacked up for the Indians, or
at least part of them were.
