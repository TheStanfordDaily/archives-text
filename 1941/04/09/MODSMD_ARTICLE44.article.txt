# Card, Troy Nines Clash In Twin Bill
## 
### 
Riding atop the California Inter- :
collegiate Baseball Association
standings, an invading Trojan nine
collides with Stanford today in a
divubleheader on Sunken Diamond,
first game called for 1:15 o'clock.
Coach Harry Wolter of the Indians
throws his ace huricr, Cootie
Thompson against Troy's Ed Vita
lieh. who has pitched the southern
ers to five straight wins this season.
Russ Smith will take the mound
for the second game, while Earl
Chambers will probably handle the
throwing duties for the leaders.
Though the Trojans are in a spot
to walk off with the league stand
ings this week, Stanford is still in
the thick of the flag raceâ€”at least
until this week's wars are over.
After today's twin bill, the Indians
meet U.C.L.A. Saturday, and after
that the Cards have seven games
coming up: three with California
and Santa Clara, and one with St.
Mary's.
Yesterday Wolter held an exten
sive batting workout under good
weather conditions for a change, but
toward the end of the afternoon the
clouds began piling up and the
weatherman predicted light showers
for today and tomorrow.
Claude Purkitt will be ready for
relief duty today and will open
against the Bruins Saturday.
Scores of the U.C.L.A.-California
and S. C.-Santa Clara games played
yesterday were not available at
press time.
