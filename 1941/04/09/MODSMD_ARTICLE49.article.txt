# Bellwether on Ballots

\wr)ON m y word," said Bellwether. "Why
Jr didn't they wait on the caucuses until I
got back from Carmel?"
I snickered. "Well, Emery, we weren't quite
sure whether you were going to make it back
this quarter at all."
The Great Man outreached me lor the pack
of smokes, one banana-like forefinger waggling
reproachfully as he said, "Mustn't grab, laddie.
And mustn't ever overlook the Old Master when
politics begin brewing."
The cigarette situation had developed into
almost a pitched battle. "Listen, Old Master,"
I said as I reached deeper into his coat pocket,
"the caucuses are over. What are you going
to do about it?" I tossed the crumpled pack of
cigarettes into the wastebasket.
"Simple, laddie." The Great One beamed.
"Gonna round up a slate of my own."
I gaped. "Bellwether, you're off the rocker.
It's too late. It can't be done."
Emery didn't move a muscle. "Sure it can
be done. Going to line up every woman on
campus and form a pressure group behind
Bellwether for President. Simple, wot?"
"But, Bellwether . .
"It's simple, laddie. Every woman falls in
line, pressure groups form among themâ€”all
backing Bellwether of course. Then the pres
sure really starts. No coke dates, no hand-hold
ing, no trips to the city, no nothing until the boy
friend guarantees he'll back the Bellwether
slate to victory!"
Nonplussed, I rummaged in the wastebasket
and salvaged a woe-begone butt. "Weeelll, Em
ery," I hesitated, "I can see where . .
The Great Man's haphazard frame quivered
with virtuous self-assuredness. "Nonsense, it's
a cinch. The women naturally will follow the
Bellwether profile to the ballot box. Think it
over, laddie, think it over. How can we lose?"
Numb beneath the logic of the sage's political
wizardry, I nevertheless remained not quite
convinced.
"Emery," I apologized, "excuse the asking.
Granted that the women will follow you, how
can you be sure their pressure group will keep
the men waving the Bellwether banners?"
Bellwether looked reproachfully down an in
terminable nose. "Laddie, if the plan doesn't
proceed according to schedule, every women in
the pressure group will wear her stocking seams
crooked for a week. That'll get them."
It was enough. "Bellwether, you're in," I said.
