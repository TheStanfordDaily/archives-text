EASTER vacation. And everyone at Carmel
enjoyed the best possible week. That is,
everyone except the people who live in Carmel.
In vigorous, biting words the Carmel towns
folk have expressed the hope, that in the future
that well-worn cliche which reads, "Stanfordites
are isolated from what goes on in the outside
world," will prove a fact.
From a Carmel newspaper has come an edito
rial headed "Those Visiting Stanford Youngsters
Have Been Deporting Themselves Distressingly
Like College Boys." Such words from a tourist
town such as Carmel which draws great bene
fits from itinerant trade can mean just one thing.
The damage done and the worry caused by
Stanford students overshadows the benefits,
monetary or otherwise, which this vacation
town gains by our presence.
There must be other just as profitable and as
psychically satisfying pastimes as fighting the
police, damaging property, and stealing men
at-work signs. Here at Stanford, the fulcrum of
our school life, as exemplified in the Honor
System, rests upon the precept that a person
in college is old enough to think and to act in
telligently and maturely.
And yet, just read what the Carmel paper has
to say:
"The boys from Stanford ran a trifle wild
around our town last week, as boys from col
lege sometimes do. They caused our police a
bit of extra work, they ran away with some
signs, they indulged in adventures of various
sorts -many of them deplorable and thought
less and sort of foolish. . . . These weren't the

only things that happened. There was some
vandalism. Some of our new street signs were
wrenched out of their concrete bases by the
roots, for instance. And to think that one of
these days they'll be professors and presidents
of the United States, and things like that."
That is far from a bread-and-butter editorial
thanking us for a pleasant visit. And it is no
invitation for a return visit. Rather, our bag
gage has been tossed into the street. How about
dusting that footprint off the seat of your trou
sers?
A quick check-up with any psychiatrist will
teach you that any person who is 20 years old,
acts like a "youngster," and breaks up property
just for fun, is mentally a moron. Perhaps an
idiot.—B. A.

fits from itinerant trade can mean just one thing.
The damage done and the worry caused by
Stanford students overshadows the benefits,
monetary or otherwise, which this vacation
town gains by our presence.
There must be other just as profitable and as
psychically satisfying pastimes as fighting the
police, damaging property, and stealing men
at-work signs. Here at Stanford, the fulcrum of
our school life, as exemplified in the Honor
System, rests upon the precept that a person
in college is old enough to think and to act in
telligently and maturely.
And yet, just read what the Carmel paper has
to say:
"The boys from Stanford ran a trifle wild
around our town last week, as boys from col
lege sometimes do. They caused our police a
bit of extra work, they ran away with some
signs, they indulged in adventures of various
sorts -many of them deplorable and thought
less and sort of foolish. . . . These weren't the

only things that happened. There was some
vandalism. Some of our new street signs were
wrenched out of their concrete bases by the
roots, for instance. And to think that one of
these days they'll be professors and presidents
of the United States, and things like that."
That is far from a bread-and-butter editorial
thanking us for a pleasant visit. And it is no
invitation for a return visit. Rather, our bag
gage has been tossed into the street. How about
dusting that footprint off the seat of your trou
sers?
A quick check-up with any psychiatrist will
teach you that any person who is 20 years old,
acts like a "youngster," and breaks up property
just for fun, is mentally a moron. Perhaps an
idiot.—B. A.
EASTER vacation. And everyone at Carmel
enjoyed the best possible week. That is,
everyone except the people who live in Carmel.
In vigorous, biting words the Carmel towns
folk have expressed the hope, that in the future
that well-worn cliche which reads, "Stanfordites
are isolated from what goes on in the outside
world," will prove a fact.
From a Carmel newspaper has come an edito
rial headed "Those Visiting Stanford Youngsters
Have Been Deporting Themselves Distressingly
Like College Boys." Such words from a tourist
town such as Carmel which draws great bene
