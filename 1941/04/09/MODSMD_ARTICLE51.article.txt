### JERRY MAYER 
THE GREAT AMERICAN
JJENRY FORD, whose place on the pedestal of great
Americans is slowly being sabotaged by his own
actions, took the lives of approximately one million
persons into his own hands five days ago when he
closed down his great River Rouge assembly plant.
Of course, such an action by Ford is not entirely
unprecedented. He has on numerous occasions at
tempted to take certain matters into his own hands,
and with disastrous results. Ford is certainly a me
chanical genius, but he has made the mistake of nu
merous successes in specific fields—they attempt to
discourse on grounds absolutely unfamiliar to them.
Ford's excursions into the fields of politics, eco
nomics ,and sociology have been utter travesties. His
"peace ship" was one of the most ridiculous, if per
haps well-meaning, affairs in history, manned as it
was by school teachers, artists, and others absolutely
unqualified to solve the problem they wei'e attacking.
His proposal to issue paper money backed by the
Muscle Shoals project in the Tennessee Valley was
the laughing stock of economists. Backing for the
paper would be units of kilowatts on a development
that had not even been organized.

\ ND, of course, his attitude toward organized labor
is famous. Ford has publicly declared that he
would never, deal with labor unions. In a number of
cases, however, he has been forced to allow union
elections in many of his smaller plants. He abso
lutely refused to allow unionization of his main plant
at River Rouge.
Recently the National Labor Relations Board ruled
that the employees of the River Rouge plant had pe
titioned the board for an election. The latter body
duly informed Ford that the election should be held.
But the man who refused to deal with labor unions
decided that his power was greater than that of a
body organized by an act of the Congress of the United
States. He shelved the matter completely.
The N.L.R.B. then informed the courts, and in
junction proceedings against Ford are now pending in
the federal courts. With the country in a state of
national emergency at the present, it will probably
take several years before the matter is settled. The
important thing is that Ford believed that he was
bigger than the government of the United States.

TN RESPECT to labor, Ford has always claimed that
there was no reason for his plant to unionize be
cause he paid above the union wage anyway. Au
thoritative statistics show this to be a false assertion.
The following figures compare Ford's minimum hour
standards to those of two automobile plants that have
been unionized under the aegis of the U.A.W., a C.1.0.
affiliate:
Whereas Ford pays his arc and gas welders 75 cents
an hour, Briggs pays $1.10 and Chrysler $1.13. Ford
pays his water sanders 90 cents, while Briggs and
Chrysler pay them the same wage their arc and gas
welders receive. Ford pays his doorhangers 75 cents an
hour, Briggs pays them $1.10. and Chrysler $1.11. These
are just isolated examples. The same is true all down
the line in the other individual assembly jobs.
It is obvious, then, why Ford employees are strik
ing. It is also obvious why Ford has closed his plant.
He has shown by his past actions that he believes him
self capable of solving all problems. The fact that
300,000 persons—workers, dealers, jobbers—will be
thrown out of work means nothing to him. Counting
families, that amounts to almost a million persons who
are affected by Ford's refusing to deal with organized
labor.
His dealers, of course, bear the brunt of the shut
down. They are caught short with thousands of orders
on their hands. The repercussions from the affair have
not yet begun to be heard.
But this much is certain. An unhealthy stale of
affairs exists when one man can control the lives of
one million Americans.
