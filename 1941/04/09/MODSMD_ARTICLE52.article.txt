# CAMPUS OPINION
## YOU MAY BE RIGHT 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
Last week two national figures spoke in the Palo
Alto vicinity, each representing opposite views upon
American intervention in the present war. One, Thomas
Mann, who led us to believe that every person who
wants to stay out of the European conflict is a fifth
columnist whether he thinks so or not, was allowed to
speak on the campus before an all-campus assembly.
The other, Senator Nye, who has been working for
years to keep us out of war, applied for and was de
nied the privilege of speaking upon the campus. We
talk of democracy, and are the defenders of democ
racy, yet the democratic process is blocked on our
own campus.
What then is the meaning of Stanford's creed, "Let
the winds of freedom blow?"
Sincerely,
Colin McClintock
