# ABOUT THE HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
It has always been so much easier to emote sen
timentally than have the courage to face the facts. Is
there anyone of the past two generations of students
who has not sat through exes in old room 214 and
NOT seen cheating galore?
With a competitive grading system the honor code
definitely penalizes the honest stude and gives all the
prizes to the weak. It helps, encourages the weak to
become weaker. What's wrong with giving the breaks
and grades to those that earn them (and won't tattle
on the others for a change)? Honor will never be
honor under such a cloak of hypocrisy.
Don't kid yourselves, it sounds pious but nobody, I
really mean NOBODY, is fooled. Cheat the honest stu
dent, if you must, but don't brag about it—and do for
get the sentimental tosh! This comes from an alum
who loves and is supporting Stanford but not its lame
old excuse for dishonest grading.
Sincerely,
Practical Grad
