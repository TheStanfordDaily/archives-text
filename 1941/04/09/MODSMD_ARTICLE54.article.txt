# Venetian Room to Exhibit Leventritt Art Collection
## 
### 
Doctor Annemarie lienle and Professor W. S. •Wellington, who have
been installing the Mortimer J. Leventritt Collection of Oriental and
Venetian Art have announced that the Venetian Room has now been com
pletely finished and will be ready for the reopening of the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford Art Gallery on April 20.

The Venetian Room has been com-,
pletely furnished with examples of
18th century decoration taken from
Mr. Leventritt's famous Medici
villa "II Pozzino" at Castello, near
Florence. This villa is famous for its
frescoes by the sixteenth century
artists Poccetti and Giovanni di San
Giovanni.
Mr. Leventritt also possessed a
beautiful Palazzino in Venice, filled
wtih rare works of art which now
form part of the gift to Stanford.
Other donations from Mr. Leven
tritt's art collection went to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York.
VENETIAN ATMOSPHERE
The Venetian Room is filled with
examples of true Venetian atmos
phere. There are colorful lacquered
commodes, tables and chairs of Ba
roque design all in their original
finish. Furniture during this period
was characterized by brilliant color
combinations and an excess of deco
ration both painted on the furniture
and carved on it.
A rare set of two settees and six
chairs in yellow lacquer from the
Grassi Palace show how the Vene
tians had developed this process of
lacquering furniture. Even the peas
ant art of the period shows this
particular finish.
PORCELAIN CHINA
In two wall cases in the room
there is a complete set of porcelain
china which was made to order in
China for some Venetian family.
This is one of the most valuable
parts of the collection.
The way this china blends with
the furniture which was made in
Venice indicates that a strong affinity
exists between the arts of China and
those of Venice, which during the
time of Marco Polo was the princi
pal port for the Orient. This is how
Oriental art first gained its entry
into western Europe, where it be
came an all-important motif for 18th
century western art, influencing
even the English furniture makers,
such as Chippendale.
EXEMPLARY TREND
The Leventritt Collection is espe
cially rich in works of art exempli
fying this trend. The Chinese group
showing the backgrounds whence
the Venetian art came is also ex
tremely complete. The Chinese
Room is now being assembled.
In a special ceremony on April
20th the Leventritt Collection will be
presented to the University in con
junction with the 50th Anniversary
celebration of the University. —

Other donations from Mr. Leven
tritt's art collection went to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York.
VENETIAN ATMOSPHERE
The Venetian Room is filled with
examples of true Venetian atmos
phere. There are colorful lacquered
commodes, tables and chairs of Ba
roque design all in their original
finish. Furniture during this period
was characterized by brilliant color
combinations and an excess of deco
ration both painted on the furniture
and carved on it.
A rare set of two settees and six
chairs in yellow lacquer from the
Grassi Palace show how the Vene
tians had developed this process of
lacquering furniture. Even the peas
ant art of the period shows this
particular finish.
PORCELAIN CHINA
In two wall cases in the room
there is a complete set of porcelain
china which was made to order in
China for some Venetian family.
This is one of the most valuable
parts of the collection.
The way this china blends with
the furniture which was made in
Venice indicates that a strong affinity
exists between the arts of China and
those of Venice, which during the
time of Marco Polo was the princi
pal port for the Orient. This is how
Oriental art first gained its entry
into western Europe, where it be
came an all-important motif for 18th
century western art, influencing
even the English furniture makers,
such as Chippendale.
EXEMPLARY TREND
The Leventritt Collection is espe
cially rich in works of art exempli
fying this trend. The Chinese group
showing the backgrounds whence
the Venetian art came is also ex
tremely complete. The Chinese
Room is now being assembled.
In a special ceremony on April
20th the Leventritt Collection will be
presented to the University in con
junction with the 50th Anniversary
celebration of the University. —
