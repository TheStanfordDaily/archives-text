# War Libe to Get Formal Plantings
## 
### 
Plans for extensive landscaping on
the grounds around the Hoover
Library were disclosed last week.
Plantings will be undertaken as soon
as street alterations now under way
are completed.
In general, the landscaping will be
made to conform to the Romanesque
architecture of Memorial Hall, and
the two buildings, the War Libe and
Memorial Hall, will eventually be
viewed as a single unit. The plant
ings will be formal in nature and at
some later date there may be tiled
and brick walks, as there now are
at Memorial Hall.
Finally, shrubs and trees will be
so arranged that parking lots and
the accompanying disagreeable view
will be invisible from the Library
and the whole area will assume an
unmatched aspect of beauty.
The walls of the Hoover Library
have been simply and economically
reinforced against stresses induced
by earthquake.
