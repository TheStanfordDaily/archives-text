# History ... 1941

### Jean Nowell 
MtIMLY the world watched the
9 Balkans yesterday. Practically
crowded out of the headlines by the
bloody mess up in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia were two other inci
dents, both of which may in the long
run prove even more disastrous to
Britain than the headline making
melee going on at present.
It was Winston Churchill and
President Roosevelt who brought
attention to these two facts.
Churchill, speaking in the House
of Commons, said that the Brit
ish face disaster unless the At
lantic sea lanes are kept open so
that U. S. aid can get to Britain.
And he pointed out also that only
"hard fighting" by the Empire
forces can keep the Germans from
taking back all of Yugoslavia and
possibly pushing into Egypt.
At the very time that Churchill
was making this pessimistic survey
of the situation, President Roosevelt
made available to the Royal Navy
ten coast guard cutters capable of
combatting submarines and there
fore useful to British convoy work.
Incidentally those 39 Danish ves
sels should be turned over to Eng
land any time now.
Churchill also stated that only
full resources of America's ship
building industry can enable Brit
ain to carry on full-scale warfare
into 1942. A definite yes or no on the
question of American convoys must
come soon, since the Britishers are
desperately calling for supplies, and
it is clear that they cannot carry on
their own convoy system much
longer.
sjt * *
r pHE LIBYAN situation is not a
pretty one to consider either.
The amazing rapidity with which the
Nazi divisions are advancing in that
desert region indicates that the
British are having a helluva time.
Already the Germans have taken
Bengasi and Derna. If the Army of
the Nile cannot stop the Nazis at
Tobruk (which is about 30 miles
inside Libya) there is imminent dan
ger that Egypt will be invaded —
with Suez the logical objective.
The ramifications of such an at
tack are frightful. Britain would
be cut off from quick access to her
Asiatic Empire, and it is almost
certain that at least some of the
crown colonics and mandates
would make trouble. But more
than that, such a display of Na/.i
strength would bring Japan into
the war. Either convoys or a Japa
nese drive to the south would al
most certainly bring the United
States in.
Indications of Japanese sentiment
are already coming in, from Vichy
of all places. Among other things
the report said that somebody-or
other thinks that Hitler has set
Easter Monday—April 14—for the
British invasion. (Churchill again
warned of the invasion in his
speech.) And the report added that
Japan thinks the Balkans will be
cleaned up in two weeks.
* * *
VOCAL point of the Balkan war
has suddenly shifted. Watch the
Monastir Pass at the Yugoslav-
Greek frontier 85 miles west of Salo
nika and barely 20 miles from where
the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Alba
nia and Greece join.
The next big German blow is
likely to come there, aimed at
swinging shut the western flap of a
huge encirclement designed to en
trap the British and Greek forces
digging in along the Vardar de
fense line.
There'll probably be a tremendous
explosion when the Germans finally
get to those British-Greek defense
lines. If there's going to be any sort
of a stand it must be there. Reports
on the progress of the campaign ia
Albania differ. Some sources claim
that the Germans are driving in t«
aid the Italians, but the Germans
merely reported a drive to the
Yugoslav-Albanian frontier, and a
welding of the two forces was not
indicated.

VOCAL point of the Balkan war
has suddenly shifted. Watch the
Monastir Pass at the Yugoslav-
Greek frontier 85 miles west of Salo
nika and barely 20 miles from where
the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Alba
nia and Greece join.
The next big German blow is
likely to come there, aimed at
swinging shut the western flap of a
huge encirclement designed to en
trap the British and Greek forces
digging in along the Vardar de
fense line.
There'll probably be a tremendous
explosion when the Germans finally
get to those British-Greek defense
lines. If there's going to be any sort
of a stand it must be there. Reports
on the progress of the campaign ia
Albania differ. Some sources claim
that the Germans are driving in t«
aid the Italians, but the Germans
merely reported a drive to the
Yugoslav-Albanian frontier, and a
welding of the two forces was not
indicated.
MtIMLY the world watched the
9 Balkans yesterday. Practically
crowded out of the headlines by the
bloody mess up in Macedonia and
Yugoslavia were two other inci
dents, both of which may in the long
run prove even more disastrous to
Britain than the headline making
melee going on at present.
It was Winston Churchill and
President Roosevelt who brought
attention to these two facts.
Churchill, speaking in the House
of Commons, said that the Brit
ish face disaster unless the At
lantic sea lanes are kept open so
that U. S. aid can get to Britain.
And he pointed out also that only
"hard fighting" by the Empire
forces can keep the Germans from
taking back all of Yugoslavia and
possibly pushing into Egypt.
At the very time that Churchill
was making this pessimistic survey
of the situation, President Roosevelt
made available to the Royal Navy
ten coast guard cutters capable of
combatting submarines and there
fore useful to British convoy work.
Incidentally those 39 Danish ves
sels should be turned over to Eng
land any time now.
Churchill also stated that only
full resources of America's ship
building industry can enable Brit
ain to carry on full-scale warfare
into 1942. A definite yes or no on the
question of American convoys must
come soon, since the Britishers are
desperately calling for supplies, and
it is clear that they cannot carry on
their own convoy system much
longer.
sjt * *
r pHE LIBYAN situation is not a
pretty one to consider either.
The amazing rapidity with which the
Nazi divisions are advancing in that
desert region indicates that the
British are having a helluva time.
Already the Germans have taken
Bengasi and Derna. If the Army of
the Nile cannot stop the Nazis at
Tobruk (which is about 30 miles
inside Libya) there is imminent dan
ger that Egypt will be invaded —
with Suez the logical objective.
The ramifications of such an at
tack are frightful. Britain would
be cut off from quick access to her
Asiatic Empire, and it is almost
certain that at least some of the
crown colonics and mandates
would make trouble. But more
than that, such a display of Na/.i
strength would bring Japan into
the war. Either convoys or a Japa
nese drive to the south would al
most certainly bring the United
States in.
Indications of Japanese sentiment
are already coming in, from Vichy
of all places. Among other things
the report said that somebody-or
other thinks that Hitler has set
Easter Monday—April 14—for the
British invasion. (Churchill again
warned of the invasion in his
speech.) And the report added that
Japan thinks the Balkans will be

The amazing rapidity with which the
Nazi divisions are advancing in that
desert region indicates that the
British are having a helluva time.
Already the Germans have taken
Bengasi and Derna. If the Army of
the Nile cannot stop the Nazis at
Tobruk (which is about 30 miles
inside Libya) there is imminent dan
ger that Egypt will be invaded —
with Suez the logical objective.
The ramifications of such an at
tack are frightful. Britain would
be cut off from quick access to her
Asiatic Empire, and it is almost
certain that at least some of the
crown colonics and mandates
would make trouble. But more
than that, such a display of Na/.i
strength would bring Japan into
the war. Either convoys or a Japa
nese drive to the south would al
most certainly bring the United
States in.
Indications of Japanese sentiment
are already coming in, from Vichy
of all places. Among other things
the report said that somebody-or
other thinks that Hitler has set
Easter Monday—April 14—for the
British invasion. (Churchill again
warned of the invasion in his
speech.) And the report added that
Japan thinks the Balkans will be
cleaned up in two weeks.

VOCAL point of the Balkan war
has suddenly shifted. Watch the
Monastir Pass at the Yugoslav-
Greek frontier 85 miles west of Salo
nika and barely 20 miles from where
the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Alba
nia and Greece join.
The next big German blow is
likely to come there, aimed at
swinging shut the western flap of a
huge encirclement designed to en
trap the British and Greek forces
digging in along the Vardar de
fense line.
There'll probably be a tremendous
explosion when the Germans finally
get to those British-Greek defense
lines. If there's going to be any sort
of a stand it must be there. Reports
on the progress of the campaign ia
Albania differ. Some sources claim
that the Germans are driving in t«
aid the Italians, but the Germans
merely reported a drive to the
Yugoslav-Albanian frontier, and a
welding of the two forces was not
indicated.
