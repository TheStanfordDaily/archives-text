"I want my bicycle, I want my bi
cycle," A.S.S.U. Vice-President Anne
Townsend has been fuming for
weeks to her pals at Lagunita.
Anne's bicycle, according to her
friends, has been stored at the Brta
house all year. Since it is a boy's
bike, the Betas, including Student
Body President Bruce Jessup, have
been most obliging to make use of it.
They even raised the seat to provide
streamline convenience for long legs.
Yesterday Anne got hold of her
bicycle. On the downswing of the
second pedal revolution, her neck
was about even with the level of the
bicycle seat.
Today Anne is wearing white
gauze bandages on both of her
knees and her left wrist.
