# Police Commission Fires Two, Suspends Two, Frees Others
## Greene Exonerated from Charges; Officials Juggle Officers' Stations 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Two policemen were junked outright, two others suspended for 90
days, and two went soot free yesterday when the San Francisco police
commission wound up the Stanford beating case after hanging the entire
police force out for an airing for over a month.
Simultaneously, police ranks reverberated with the shunting of six

captains into new station commands,
and a shake-up which scattered
some 70 officers to new beats all over
the city.
The commission did not. see fit to
fire or suspend Officer Joseph
Greene, the man whom Stanford
freshman Don Allan confronted face
to face and personally aecused as
the policeman who brutally slugged
him while he was in police custody.
Allan's nose was broken in the
assault.
NEGLECT OF DUTY'
Fired on the spot were Patrolman
John J. Desmond, the man who En
cinaman Carter Barber picked out
as his assailant, and Patrol Wagon
Driver Benito Escobar. Both were
found guilty of charges of neglect
of duty. Neither was convicted for
the actual beatings.
Sergeant Thomas I. and
Patrolman Roy Loran were sus
pended for 90 days for neglect of
duty. Exonerated of neglect of duty
charges were Patrolman Greene
and Edward Van Dervort.
POLICE ADMIT
While the police commission ad
mitted again that the students were
mauled while in police custody early
the morning of March 2, just who
committed mayhem upon the per
sons of the two students was not an
nounced and apparently went unde
cided by the commissioners.
Police Commission President Wil
liam P. Wobber condemned the
"know nothing, say nothing" atti
tude of the accused, and charged
them with "the height of disloyalty
to permit the splendid reputation of
the San Francisco police department
to be hammered and besmirched day
after day to save the job of some
one or more men."
