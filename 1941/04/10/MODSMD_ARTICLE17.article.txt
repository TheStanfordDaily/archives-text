## Eliel States Danger Of Workers' Rights

Ideological strikes are inspired by
those who favor drastic changes in
the basic form of our economy and
who are supporters of either the left
or the right elements among the to
talitarian states. There apparently
was some of this influence in the
Allis-ChaLmers strike and also in
the Harvill Die Casting Company
strike.
Organizational strikes are called
for the purpose of enlarging the ex
isting union organization or protect
ing it against the presumed attacks
of a rival labor organization. This
element was involved in the Inter
national Harvester Company strike
and is a minor element in the Ford
strike.
AMERICAN ATTITUDE
Finally, we have protest strikes
which are called because of some
serious error in managerial judg
ment so far as industrial relations
are concerned, and against which
the workers rebel. Apparently this
factor was also involved in the Allis-
Chalmers strike and is certainly a
major element in the Ford strike.
No matter what the cause of the
strike may be, to the American pub
lic in its present frame of mind a
strike is a strike, and the workers
are charged with the responsibility
for calling it. It is perfectly obvious
that the temper of the American
people and of those who represent
them in Congress and in our state
legislatures is growing progressively
shorter and the sympathy and tol
erance which labor has enjoyed is
rapidly disappearing under the im
pact of the strike wave. This is, in
my opinion, the most serious aspect
of the whole strike scene. It is cer
tain that a continued enlargement of
the time lost due to strikes will most
adversely affect, the defense pro
gram.
LEGISLATION DRASTIC
The really serious problem, how
ever, from the standpoint, of indus
trial relations is the effect of the
continuation of strikes, no matter
what the reason back of them may
be, upon the public mind. Legisla
tion to check free action of work
ers in striking, or possibly legisla
tion of a more drastic character, is
inevitable if the leaders of organ
ized labor are unwilling or unable
to prevent the increase and spread
of strikes. Since the core of the
problem of industrial relations is a
human one, legislative efforts to
meet it are bound to take the direc
tion of withdrawing rights from
workers that they have struggled to
win, and which, in the large, as
human beings they are entitled to
enjoy. Should the present epidemic
of strikes continue, and should more
really important industries engaged
in the defense program be involved,
retaliatory legislation will undoubt
edly be passed which will take from
labor for years, if not for decades,
many of the things which they have
fought so long to obtain.

trial relations is the effect of the
continuation of strikes, no matter
what the reason back of them may
be, upon the public mind. Legisla
tion to check free action of work
ers in striking, or possibly legisla
tion of a more drastic character, is
inevitable if the leaders of organ
ized labor are unwilling or unable
to prevent the increase and spread
of strikes. Since the core of the
problem of industrial relations is a
human one, legislative efforts to
meet it are bound to take the direc
tion of withdrawing rights from
workers that they have struggled to
win, and which, in the large, as
human beings they are entitled to
enjoy. Should the present epidemic
of strikes continue, and should more
really important industries engaged
in the defense program be involved,
retaliatory legislation will undoubt
edly be passed which will take from
labor for years, if not for decades,
many of the things which they have
fought so long to obtain.

Ideological strikes are inspired by
those who favor drastic changes in
the basic form of our economy and
who are supporters of either the left
or the right elements among the to
talitarian states. There apparently
was some of this influence in the
Allis-ChaLmers strike and also in
the Harvill Die Casting Company
strike.
Organizational strikes are called
for the purpose of enlarging the ex
isting union organization or protect
ing it against the presumed attacks
of a rival labor organization. This
element was involved in the Inter
national Harvester Company strike
and is a minor element in the Ford
strike.
AMERICAN ATTITUDE
Finally, we have protest strikes
which are called because of some
serious error in managerial judg
ment so far as industrial relations
are concerned, and against which
the workers rebel. Apparently this
factor was also involved in the Allis-
Chalmers strike and is certainly a
major element in the Ford strike.
No matter what the cause of the
strike may be, to the American pub
lic in its present frame of mind a
strike is a strike, and the workers
are charged with the responsibility
for calling it. It is perfectly obvious
that the temper of the American
people and of those who represent
them in Congress and in our state
legislatures is growing progressively
shorter and the sympathy and tol
erance which labor has enjoyed is
rapidly disappearing under the im
pact of the strike wave. This is, in
my opinion, the most serious aspect
of the whole strike scene. It is cer
tain that a continued enlargement of
the time lost due to strikes will most
adversely affect, the defense pro
gram.
LEGISLATION DRASTIC
