# Student Acquitted On Bullion Charge
## 
### 
Richard Prieth, second-year Stan
ford business student, was acquitted
last Wednesday of a federal charge
of acquiring and holding in custody
gold bullion.
Last July one grand jury refused
to indict, and the charge lay dormant
eight months before Wednesday's
retrial in which Prieth was acquitted
within five minutes. Prieth is regis
tered from Palo Alto.
