ATKNS, Thurs., April 10 (IT).—
Greek troops cut off by the sweep
of Germany's mechanized jugger
naut which sliced Greece in half
and seized Salonika still are holding
"impregnable lines" deep in eastern
Macedonia, the command an
nounced early today.
Reinforced British air squadrons,
blasting at the Nazi "panzer" forces
24 hours a day, were said to be
supporting a "hold-or-die" Greek
stand in new positions west of fallen

Salonika, Greece's second city and
great Aegean port which the Ger
mans occupied yesterday.
Jugoslav forces were said offi
cially to have slormed across the
Drin River into the interior of Ital
ian Albania against the Fascist
army and to be battling the Ger
mans in rugged mountain passes 20
miles north of Skolpje along the
Vardar, already fallen to the Nazis.
The Greek high command's an
nouncement that the isolated Greeks
in eastern Macedonia are still bat
tling the German tide near the Bul
garian frontier disputed a German
high command claim the Greeks,
hopelessly entrapped, had "thrown
down their arms and capitulated."
