### 
ROME, April 9 (UP). —The Greek
army iti Albania was imported to
night to be withdrawing across the
border to avoid any chance of be
ing trapped by the German and
Italian forces newly joined in
southern Jugoslavia.
Accounts from Tirana, the Alba
nian capital, told of the Greek re
treat from the mountains where they
had pushed back the Italian armies
and held them in check for months.
Axis sources expected the Greeks
to make a stand along a line some
where north of Athens. They said
the British expeditionary force in
Greece, including Australians, New
Zealanders and various units sent in
from Africa and Palestine, probably
would join in the defense of any
such line established.
Authoritative sources said the
German and Italian forces met in
south Jugoslavia near Tetovo, west
of Skoplje. At least two divisions of
Italians started eastward at dawn
and met the Germans by prear
rangement at a Jugoslav mountain
pass after smashing all resistance.
