# Vocom to Cross Examine S.F. Executives on Jobs
## Men Given Individual Opportunities To Discuss Vocational Interests 
### 
Six prominent San Francisco businessmen are "on the spot today.
This afternoon they will he visited by curious men who will bombard
them with questions about their businesses â€”what they pay their men,
chances of advancement, what they offer their employees, what vocational
education they give them, and other personal business data.

It isn't a government investiga-4
tion, or even a feature writer's con- j
t. t. The men who will visit the
executives are Stanford students
who are taking advantage of the I
Men's Vocational Committee Spring !
Quarter program of vocational in- I
terviews, and the businessmen are
p< rfectly willing to be cross-exam- !
hied; in fact, they like it.
