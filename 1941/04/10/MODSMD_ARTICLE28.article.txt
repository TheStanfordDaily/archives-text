# Palo Alto Traffic Faces Revisions
## 
### 
Improvement of the traffic situa
tion in Palo Alto was foreseen
Monday by the city board of works
with the consideration of widening
Alma Street between Everett apd
Palo Alto Avenues, and possibly the
widening ol Emerson Street between
University and Charming Avenues.
The cost, to be paid out of gas tax
funds, would reach about $38,000.
The city council was again ad
vised that traffic signals should be
placed on University Avenue be
tween High Street and Cowper.
