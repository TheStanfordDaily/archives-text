# Mexico Can Wait; Helen Green Favors S.F. Ballet
## 
### 
It's a matter of general speculation whether or not Helen Green, in
structor in costuming, will ever take that trip to Mexico.
After postponing her departure to the political volcano once, she was
planning her farewells for this month. And then the San Francisco Opera

Ballet got hold of her!
As a result Mrs. Green has again
postponed her trip and in the in
terim she will work with the ballet
as costumer for their forthcoming
productions in San Francisco.
This group of young artists, just
back from a nationwide tour, will
present the classic "Swan Lake" at
ihe Opera House on April 24, "Cop
pelia" and "Now the Bride" on
April 26. These last two works are
new and Mrs. Green has created the
costumes for them.
Traveling across the bay, the
terpsichoreans will dance Tschai
kowsky's "Romeo and Juliet" and
Strauss' "In Old Vienna" at the Ber
keley Festival on May 11.
Tickets for all of these produc
tions are available at Memorial
Hall office and at the Peninsula Box
Office. Prices range from 75 cents
to $2.50.
And Helen Green leaves for
Mexico on May 12, according to lat
est reports. Subject to change, no
doubt!
