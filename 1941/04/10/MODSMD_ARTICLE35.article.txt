# Farm Trackmen to Face Winged 'O' in Dual Meet
## 
### 
The Olympic Club track team, a loosely-knit aggregation of ex-college
stars and tired business men, comes to Stanford this week to engage the
Indians in the annual duel meet at Angell Field.
Just how strong the Winged "O" will be won't be known until the last
minute, depending on the arrival <if various weight men from outlying

region and runners who sometimes
perform for the S.C.A.A. behind
Charley Hunter's back. While a
portion of the squad works with
Bill Ellington in these parts, such
gents as Connie Warmerdam are
heard from, trying to get away from
little towns in the San Joaquin
Valley.
Fortunately, ihe Olympic Club
can usually rely on Tom Moore, Ed
Preston, and a few others to be on
hand, and will be powerful.
Hiding on the crest of a lop-sided
victory gained at the expense of
Tiny Hartranft's Spartans Tuesday,
the Stanford team is somewhat fired
up for Saturday's affair. Blair Hyde
has been driving himself for the
past week. He wants a good crack
at some of his old pals who will be
running for the Olympic Club, par
ticularly in the half-mile.
Emerson Hiler, coming along fast,
looks the best of all the college dis
cus men on the Coast. He will face
his toughest competition of the year
in Phil Fox of the Winged '"O." Fox,
who once performed for Stanford
under the name of Levy, is consist
ent at around 155 and 160 feet and
will be heavily favored in his pet
event.
Hiler threw 158 after winning at
154 in the dual meet Tuesday. He
has thrown well in practice now for
two years and has recently broken
his habit of tying up when the heat
is on.
Ray Dean, ex-Indian sprinter, just
answered Uncle Sam's call and will
not be available for the Olympic
Club.

will be heavily favored in his pet
event.
Hiler threw 158 after winning at
154 in the dual meet Tuesday. He
has thrown well in practice now for
two years and has recently broken
his habit of tying up when the heat
is on.
Ray Dean, ex-Indian sprinter, just
answered Uncle Sam's call and will
not be available for the Olympic
Club.
The Olympic Club track team, a loosely-knit aggregation of ex-college
stars and tired business men, comes to Stanford this week to engage the
Indians in the annual duel meet at Angell Field.
Just how strong the Winged "O" will be won't be known until the last
minute, depending on the arrival <if various weight men from outlying

region and runners who sometimes
perform for the S.C.A.A. behind
Charley Hunter's back. While a
portion of the squad works with
Bill Ellington in these parts, such
gents as Connie Warmerdam are
heard from, trying to get away from
little towns in the San Joaquin
Valley.
Fortunately, ihe Olympic Club
can usually rely on Tom Moore, Ed
Preston, and a few others to be on
hand, and will be powerful.
Hiding on the crest of a lop-sided
victory gained at the expense of
Tiny Hartranft's Spartans Tuesday,
the Stanford team is somewhat fired
up for Saturday's affair. Blair Hyde
has been driving himself for the
past week. He wants a good crack
at some of his old pals who will be
running for the Olympic Club, par
ticularly in the half-mile.
Emerson Hiler, coming along fast,
looks the best of all the college dis
cus men on the Coast. He will face
his toughest competition of the year
in Phil Fox of the Winged '"O." Fox,
who once performed for Stanford
under the name of Levy, is consist
ent at around 155 and 160 feet and
will be heavily favored in his pet
event.
