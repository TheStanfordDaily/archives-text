# Grid Practice Stops for Rain
## 
### 
With yesterday's field practice
rained out, Chief Mechanic Shaugh
nessy will run (he 1941 edition of
the Model "T" into the garage for a
mental check-up and a short chalk
talk at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon,
with the second workout of the sea
son being held tomorrow afternoon
on the practice field.
Although there was some talk of
shifting Loren LaPrade, ace center
on last year's frosh team, to guard
or tackle, LaPrade worked out in
the pivot spot in Tuesday's drill,
along with Vic Lindskog, Tyler Nor
ton, reserve on the frosh squad last
year, and Tony Medved, reserve
lackle on the Piose Bowl squad.
The speed of Darwin Seeley, first
string tackle on last year's frosh
team, was another feature of the
Tuesday workout. Weighing about
210 pounds, Seeley is extremely fast
for a big man, and will be remem
bered as the player who intercepted
a pass and ran 65 yards for a touch
down in the game with the U.S.C.
frosh last fall.
Another prominent guard candi
date has come up out of the frosh
ranks in the person of Kelly Ross,
former all-state guard from Arkan
sas, while Jim Ellis has lived up to
his advance publicity so far. Big
and fast, Ellis has been rated by ob
servers as one of the best frosh ends
to enroll at Stanford in recent years.
