suspect of a guy who has spent
his winters at Palm Springs' El Mira

swanky Denver Country Club, Stan

Lamb means business.
He arrived in Palo Alto Monday,
lot the job of tennis coach on the
Farm Tuesday, and yestei'day, Wed
nesday really went to work. He put
the Card tennis team through an
unheard-of 4-hour practice session.
Under Lamb's direction Dee,
Low, Wade, and Co. practiced in
dividually from 1:30 to 2:!>0 o'clock
and from then to 5:15(1 the boys
held practice matches with their
various teammates.

trackman—work and plenty of it.
From now on under Lamb's direc
tion the Indian tennis team will not
take their practice matches with
characteristic carelessness. And ac
