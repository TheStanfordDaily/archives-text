### 
Fickle Jupe Pluvius did it again
yesterday, washing out the Indian-
Trojan double-header scheduled for
1:15 o'clock on Sunken Diamond.
The twin bill has been reset for to
morrow at the same time, weather
permitting as usual.
One thing about the Troy forces
was proved Tuesday—U.S.C. can be
beat — and Santa Clara's John
"Lefty" Collins did it, setting the
southerners down with four scat
tered hits as the Broncos won, 10-4.
'Claran catcher Bill Mustanich had
a perfect day at bat, getting a homer,
three singles, and a walk.
Bob Foltz, the S.C. pitcher who
hurled his mates to an 11-4 win over
the Los Angeles Angels, started on

I the hill but was driven to the show- j
j ers in the sixth inning as the Broncos
i slammed out four hits interspersed j
t with a like number of walks to
I score five runs. Earl Chambers re- j
j lieved him and was lifted for pinch
| hitter in the eighth.
Up at Berkeley Tuesday U.C.L.A.
i slid deeper into the C.1.8.A. cellar, ;
! dropping an 11-3 verdict to Calif or- :
i nia The Bruins outhit Cal, 12-10,
; but couldn't bunch their safeties !
when the chips were down.
The Trojan's loss to Santa Clara |
cut their margin over the second j
place Bears to only half a game,
while Stanford, remaining idle,
dropped a few percentage points and

j went into third place in the stand
| ings
j Today St. Mary's sends its star
; hurler, Wes Bailey, against the Tro
| jans at Moraga, while the Bruins
i meet Santa Clara. Should bad
weather force today's games to be

'Claran catcher Bill Mustanich had
a perfect day at bat, getting a homer,
three singles, and a walk.
