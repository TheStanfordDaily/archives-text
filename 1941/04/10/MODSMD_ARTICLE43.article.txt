# Mermen Face Heavy Weekend
## 
### 
This week-end marks the heaviest
yet for Stanford's undefeated varsity
swimmers. For en Friday at 3::i0
o'clock they meet the P.C.C. cham
pions, Southern California, at the En
cina Pools, and Saturday, imme
diately following 1 the track meet,
(hey meet the Olympic Club. Ad
mission to the S.C. tilt is 25 cents
with student hody cards and 50
cents general admission. Admission
to the Olympic Cluh meet is free.
The Trojans have not lost a dual
meet in three years and have been
Conference champs for the past two
years. The Indians go into this meet
with seven straight victories to
I heir credit and have every reason
to believe that they will break the
Trojan streak.
P.C.C. RECORDS
P.C.C. records are kept for the
20-yard course, and another group
of records are kept for the 25-yard
course (that which Stanford and
S.C. have been swimming all year).
Oregon holds three P.C.C. records
due to the fact that they regularly
swim in a 20-yard pool. The rec
ords thai Friday's swimmers hope to
shatter are the 300-yard medley
relay, the 100-yard freestyle, the
150-yard backstroke, and the 400-
yard freestyle relay.
While Stanford expects to win
(he meet they will probably need
the relay to clinch the victory. The
Indians will count on Doc Colyear
for a win in the 220-yard freestyle,
and Bill Niccolls and Bob Laverty
for points in diving. Brad Young
and Gardner Miller may score in
(he 50-yard sprint.
OLYMPIC MEET
When Stanford meets the Olym
pic Club Saturday they will run into
probably the stiffest competition that
they have yet been called upon to
face. Among the Post Street greats
are Henry Paris, Bill Lucas, Jim
Werson, Emmett Cashin, and Ray
Taft. All of these stellar attractions
compromise the nucleus of a team
that has not lost a dual meet in four
years and is the Far Western A.A.U.
championholder.
The Olympians are using four
transfers from other clubs who are
not eligible for A.A.U. competition,
on the grounds that this is not an
A.A.U. meet. In direct contrast to
this policy, the Indians are being
deprived of the services of Howie
Adams.
