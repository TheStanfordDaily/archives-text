# Daze of Our Youth
## 
### 
IT comes as a considerable shock to realize
that, after all, we're still pretty young.
Along about the time that one is a sophomore,
there comes that startling hour when one paws
about gawkishly, beats one's chest, and tells
the world and the neighbor in the next row—
"By golly, you know, I'm a man!"
Then, for the next few ages, one waves this
new-found blessing around like a banner, mak
ing certain that every acquaintance learns about
this heaven-inspired change in one's life.
One discovers that in order to be grown-up
one must have a mind of one's own; must be
adamant on every conversational topic; must
never compromise on subjects of art, govern
ment, drama, politics or even football.
One is "grown-up."
* * * *
Then, along about a few years later, one
bumps into the great, wide world. One takes a
few rough knocks, and begins to wonder just
how much of this new-found mental poise and
perspective is much more than mere tinfoil.
* * * *
This warring world around us today isn't the
same old world we thought we'd be living in.
The minds we thought had developed into the
firmness and perspective of adulthood are be
ginning to feel more than a wee bit disillu
sioned.
One begins to weigh the likelihood of a
twenty-second birthday wearing a tin hat on the
shores of the Aegean Sea, and the prospect of
spending all those afterwards under the sands
of Egypt. And one discovers with a start that
that prospect just won't be forgotten.
Then follows a period where one tries to gaze
disinterestedly at this new intellectual play
thing; where one still attempts to utilize the
"mind of one's own" theory of adulthood.
And along comes another startling hour. The
hour where the goals we have built fade into
hazy dream-castles. The hour when one first
realizes that study-hours, that five-unit incom
plete, those tough courses we've been carrying,
and even graduation itself melt away under the
little-boy theories of "have a good time while
you can."
* * * *
Bowed by the weight of this sudden realiza
tion, one potters away trying desperately to live
up to a new ideology. One attempts to soothe
away one's cares in many rounds of beers; in
violent canoeing or skiing; or in just generally
loosening one's grip on the things that count.
* * * *
This goes on under the impetus of what one
feels is an inescapable, pushing force. And
then, if one is lucky, there comes another star
tling hour.
An hour where things begin to settle down
into relative focus again. Where one realizes
that these big and little things are durable and
lasting, and more important than the tantrums
of a sick old world.
Where one suddenly discovers that the
achievement of adulthood isn't so dained far
away after all.

away after all.
IT comes as a considerable shock to realize
that, after all, we're still pretty young.
Along about the time that one is a sophomore,
there comes that startling hour when one paws
about gawkishly, beats one's chest, and tells
the world and the neighbor in the next row—
"By golly, you know, I'm a man!"
Then, for the next few ages, one waves this
new-found blessing around like a banner, mak
ing certain that every acquaintance learns about
this heaven-inspired change in one's life.
One discovers that in order to be grown-up
one must have a mind of one's own; must be
adamant on every conversational topic; must
never compromise on subjects of art, govern
ment, drama, politics or even football.
One is "grown-up."
* * * *
Then, along about a few years later, one
bumps into the great, wide world. One takes a
few rough knocks, and begins to wonder just
how much of this new-found mental poise and
perspective is much more than mere tinfoil.
* * * *
This warring world around us today isn't the
same old world we thought we'd be living in.
The minds we thought had developed into the
firmness and perspective of adulthood are be
ginning to feel more than a wee bit disillu
sioned.
One begins to weigh the likelihood of a
twenty-second birthday wearing a tin hat on the
shores of the Aegean Sea, and the prospect of
spending all those afterwards under the sands
of Egypt. And one discovers with a start that
that prospect just won't be forgotten.
Then follows a period where one tries to gaze
disinterestedly at this new intellectual play
thing; where one still attempts to utilize the
"mind of one's own" theory of adulthood.
And along comes another startling hour. The
hour where the goals we have built fade into
hazy dream-castles. The hour when one first
realizes that study-hours, that five-unit incom
plete, those tough courses we've been carrying,
and even graduation itself melt away under the
little-boy theories of "have a good time while
you can."
* * * *
Bowed by the weight of this sudden realiza
tion, one potters away trying desperately to live
up to a new ideology. One attempts to soothe
away one's cares in many rounds of beers; in
violent canoeing or skiing; or in just generally
loosening one's grip on the things that count.
* * * *
This goes on under the impetus of what one
feels is an inescapable, pushing force. And
then, if one is lucky, there comes another star
tling hour.
An hour where things begin to settle down
into relative focus again. Where one realizes
that these big and little things are durable and
lasting, and more important than the tantrums
of a sick old world.
Where one suddenly discovers that the
achievement of adulthood isn't so dained far
away after all.
