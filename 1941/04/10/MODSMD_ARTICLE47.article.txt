WITH every tick of the teletype machines
and every point on the radio dial harmo
nizing on the tune of the German panzer troops'
phenomenal putsch through Jugoslavian, Greek
and British forces in the Balkans, the American
public yesterday and last night whistled col
lectively and admitted, "It sure looks bad."
With the front page columns reporting, and
History 1941 interpreting, the Balkan situation,
these columns present today the following brief
predictions on just how these United States will
be internally affected.

Watch for notice of the following events be
fore the end of the week:
(1) The United States will receive a "note"
from the Japanese government regarding an
other "serious incident" in the Orient. This
one may really prove "serious" unless the Ger
man advances bog down.
(2) As a result of great pressure from Lord
Halifax, administration leaders in Congress will
hasten their word-of-mouth campaign for con
voying.
(3) While labor remains adamant, Roosevelt
will tell a press conference that unless an
agreement is reached the government will be
forced to step in as arbitrator.
(4) Secretary Cordell Hull or Frank Knox will
tell a press conference, and/or the country, that
"close co-operation" is essential between gov
ernment and the press.
(5) South American and U.S. officials will ex
change notes regarding the "desirability" of
greater commodity exchanges between this
nation and the nations below the border.
