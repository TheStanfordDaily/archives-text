"Considering both the colonial and national
periods, we find that between 1689 and 1918
there were eight general European wars. And
the American people were involved in every
one of them, whether they wanted to be or
not. Although one would not be justified in
concluding that the United States must in
evitably be drawn into every general war, it
seems reasonably clear that America has
never been, and probably can never be, com
pletely separated from Europe."â€”Professor
Thomas A. Bailey of Stanford in his book, "A
Diplomatic History of the American People"
