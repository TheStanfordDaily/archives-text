'J'HE phrase, "Jim Crow," has been the bugaboo of
American democracy for the entire history of the
country. It stands for one of the worst tendencies of
an ostensibly cultured and civilized country. Jim
Crow tactics (or negro-baiting) have appeared on the
American scene on numerous occasions, always pro
mulgated by organizations that have been considei'ed
un-American by the vast majority of the American
public, the Ku Klux Klan, for instance.
But occasionally such tactics arise in places where
they would least be expectedâ€”in the American uni
versities, supposedly cornerstones of tolerance and en
lightenment.

days ago The Harvard Crimson, undergrad
uate daily newspaper of Harvard University,
charged that the university had "kowtowed to in
tolerant Jim-Crowism" by withdrawing a negro mem
ber of the varsity la crosse team from a recent game
against the United States Naval Academy.
Harvard's director of athletics admitted that the
negro had been withdrawn from the game because
"Annapolis objected very violently" to his participa
tion. The Navy, of course, has been a stronghold of
anti-negro forces. In the history of the academy only
two negroes have ever been admitted, and none has
been graduated.

IJECENTLY a negro graduate of the University of
Minnesota passed third high in his CAA. flying
course. When he applied for duty, he was informed
that there was no place for him in our air corps. He
went to Canada and was immediately signed up by
the RA.F., which is fighting a death battle and doesn't
have the time to worry about a man's color as long
as he is willing to defend his country.
Several years ago, when the great All-American,
Willis Ward, was playing end for the University of
Michigan, the Wolverines had a scheduled game with
the University of Georgia. The southerners objected
to Ward's playing, but the Michigan coach refused to
keep his best man on the sidelines.

ITERE on the Pacific Coast, charges of Crow-baiting
have occasionally been leveled since the influx of
negro athletes at the University of California at Los
Angeles. The Daily Californian at Berkeley a year
ago charged that U.C.LA.'s basketball coach has prac
ticed such tactics on negro candidates for the Bruins'
cage team. The writer, who comes from Southern
California, had heard of this many years ago, al
though he does not pretend to know whether such
charges are true. The U.C.L.A. coach vigorously de
nied the allegations.
The flagrant unsportsmanship of the whole thing is
obvious. Negroes have shown themselves to be superb
athletes. And when educational facilities have been
open to them they have also displayed enough intel
ligence to disprove the theory of unenlightened per
sons that they constitute an inferior race. No inferior
race could have survived under the handicaps that
the negroes have been subjected to.
