## 
### 
Stark realism will feature the
three sets designed fur Ram's Head's
annual one-act play presentation
scheduled for tomorrow and Sat
urday nights in the Little 'Theater
at 8:15 o'clock.
Most ambitious of the sets is "Re
union of the Crows," which de
picts the facade and front lawn of
a Utah farm-house.
"That set is accurate down to the
last fake butternut tree," Lois Feld
hym, technical director, said yes
terday. "We've even got a sag in
the roof. I want to emphasize that
the sag is deliberate," she added.
"Louis Takes a Wife," A1 Zelver's
draft comedy, requires the cluttered
living room of a Brooklyn boarding
house, complete with a flight of
stairs that squeak. According to
Miss Feldhym, the technical crew
had no trouble with that problem.

For Harry Muheim's "Where's Mr.
Dryer" the emphasis has been put
on wall colorings, with hangover
green and salmon egg the predomi
nating tones in the decor.
The theory is that the bilious look
ing set will put both cast and au
dience right in the mood of the
play.
Tickets for both performances are
50 cents and will be on sale at the
door.
