# CAMPUS OPINION
## PAGING BENEDICT ARNOLD 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
I notice that some of the boys feel abused be
cause the administration wouldn't let Senator Nye
speak on the campus. If we all had to learn every
thing that the average man knows today by ourselves
without any guidance from others it would take us
about a million years apiece. We, therefore, go to
school to learn and we chose this school because we
believed that it would teach us well. And the Ad
ministration did do well when it kept Senator Nye
off the campus.
I heard Senator Nye speak in Palo Alto. It is my
opinion and the opinion of the great majority of
Americans that Nye is a traitor. He is a traitor to the
American ideal of government, I base this statement
on one sentence from his speech. He said that if any
war came it would then be "My Country right or
wrong." That's what millions of Germans are saying
today. Our government, contrary to that of Germany,
is based on a higher principle than the state alone.
Here an act of the state is not of necessity right.
Does Senator Nye mean that he actually would fight
for his country if he were morally certain that it was
in the wrong? In Germany that would make him better
than Hitler's best man. Nye is not fit to be bootblack
to the ancient Pilgrims and the modern European refu
gees who were willing to flee to strange lands rather
than remain and compromise their conscience by doing !
what they know to be wrong.
