# Stanford Bill Provides Mild Entertainment
## 
### 
"A Gal, a Guy, and a Gob" and "Life
with Henry" now playing at the
Stanford Theater
If you're in the mood for light
entertainment, here it is. Both pic
tures are mildly funny American
type comedies which you may not
want to see twice. For a little re
laxation, the bill is okay.
"A Gal, a Guy, and a Gob" is the
tale of a triangle consisting of a
secretary, her stuffed-shirt but good
looking boss, and her sailor boy
friend.
GOB VS. BOSS
After usurping the guy's box at a
symphony, the gal, played by Lu
cille Ball, accidentally drops her
handbag on his head. Imagine his
surprise when the gal appears as
his new secretary the next day.
All goes well until the fleet comes
in and the gal's boy friend "Coffee"
Cupp arrives with it. Then the gal
and the gob set about humanizing
the boss by showing him how life
is aside from symphonies, operas,
and garden parties. The gal's family
helps them along in a way which is
reminiscent of the Sycamores in
"You Can't Take It with You."
Meanwhile, the boss has a falling
out with his fiancee. He and the gal
find out that they are in love just
as she is about to marry the gob.
And the gob backs out and rejoins
the navy.
MURPHY DOESN'T DANCE
Lucille Ball looks good if you
like blondes. Edmond O'Brien as
the boss is a Franchot Tone with a
lower hair line and less charm. And
George Murphy as the gob spills a
lot of personality but doesn't dance
much, darn it.
The second movie is based on the
Aldrich family of radio. Henry, the
adolescent son, gets into several
scrapes trying to earn one hundred
dollars toward a trip to Alaska, the
rest of the money to be supplied by
a philanthropist who takes a group
of boys on the tour every summer.
Henry tries to make money by man
ufacturing a soap which ruins the
clothes of all the Aldrichs' neigh
bors.
Jackie Cooper as Henry imitates
the voice adequately. The whole
thing is pleasant but not exciting.â€”
