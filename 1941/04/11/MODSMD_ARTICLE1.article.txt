### Jean Nowell 
D AY before yesterday the Ger
mans were yelling "come on out
and fight." Yesterday the British
holed in along a line stretching from
Mount Olympus to Larissa com
plaining that the Germans haven't
indicated any desire to fight with
them. This is a strictly temporary
situation, and the big fight may be
going on by the time this column
hits the 8 o'clocks. Or if it isn't it'll
happen some time today.
The Croats, as predicted, have
welshed out on the war. Yester
day several of the leaders, in
cluding two who have been hiding
in Italy since they were convicted
of plotting King Alexander's as
sassination in Franco in 19IM, got
together and set up a separatist
Croat state with Zagreb as the
capital.
The army which was trapped on
the Croatian plain was composed
mainly of Croats whose hearts prob
ably weren't in their work.
But the Yugoslavian navy escaped
from its base and got away to join
the British fleet operating out of
Greek ports, and the Serbs appar
ently don't know when they're
licked. Around the Vardar valley
town of Skoplje, an important rail
road center, the battle is raging fu
riously, and the Serbs wouldn't be
trying if they didn't think they
could get the town back.
* * *
set of Serbs and loyal
Croatians is reported to be
smashing its way deeper into Italian
Albania going southwest across the
Drin river after having taken Scu
tari, Lesh, and Kukes.
The Greeks, too, don't seem to
know when the fight is useless.
Hopelessly cut off, they are still
holding the Rupel Pass fortress, and
are still fighting fiercely on the
Struma Valley and Nevrokotrop
Plateau fronts. Over in Albania
there was only patrol and artillery
activity in the Tepelini sector.
The Nazis took Salonika all
right, hut it now appears that
they didn't get much. British sap
pers working almost up to the
minute of German occupation
managed ot blow up the entire
harbor works, according to long
expected and well-executed plans.
Noticeably absent from last night's
reports was Berlin announcement of
any new Libyan victories. Judging
from this fact, and a map, indica
tions are that the Empire forces
are going to make their stand at
Tobruk.
Meanwhile in this country the
United States moved to within three
miles of the German sea war zone
when it took over Greenland. The
move, made without the consent of
the Danish home government, was
done because, according to Stephen
Early, "... German planes have
been flying over Greenland."

the Danish Ambassador
k just handed the big island to us
on a platter, it is probable that the
Danish Government will make
strong protests. No doubt they
really don't mind any more than
they mind the 39 vessels we took
the other day, but they'll at least
give lip-service to Hitler for their
own good.
Greenland is just 1200 miles
from the British Isles and would
be just as good a jumping ofT place
for supplies to England as it would
be an air and naval base for us.
Perhaps the United States will
adopt a sort of half-way convoy
system whereby we take the stuff
to Greenland, and Britain picks
it up there.
The Hungarian government, flap
ping along on the tail of the Nazi
kite, ordered its armed forces to
prepare to "protect" the Hungarian
minority in Yugoslav territory
across the Drava river which was
cut off from Austria-Hungary and
attached to Yugoslavia at Versailles.
Adolf Hitler may be doing all right
in his war, but his cultural life is
going to take an awful lag now that
the State Opera House in Berlin has
been bombed to bits. The British
really got at the heart of Berlin in
their last raid, because that and
other buildings hit were right on
the Unter dcr Linden.
