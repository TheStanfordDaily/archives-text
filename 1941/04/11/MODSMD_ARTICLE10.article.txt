# Interfraternity Chooses Haugh For President
## Fraternities State Housemothers Have Not Been Considered 
### 
Jim Haugh, junior class president
and Delt, swept into next year's In
terfraternity Council and Board of
Control presidency on the first bal
lot last night at a dinner meeting at
the Chi Psi house, after being
"kicked upstairs" by Tuesday night's
Row A.S.S.U. election caucus.
Colin McClintock, Phi Psi debater
an dgridiron center, nudged Chuck
Smith, Daily sports editor and Phi
Delt basketball reserve, in a close
tilt for Interfraternity secretary,
after Smith lost to Haugh and auto
matically stepped into the race for
secretary. McClintock shaded Smith
13 to 10 on the third ballot.
Twenty-three votes were cast for
president, Haugh collecting 18. Louie
Reese, Alpha Delt, trailed Smith's 4
votes with 1. Haugh was a strong
favorite for the Row nomination for
the A.S.S.U. presidency in the spring
elections prior to Tuesday's caucus,
at which Frankie Albert, All-Ameri
can Deke, was tabbed. Haugh was
1940 Pre-Reg chairman.
Haugh and McClintock will ini
tiate plans immediately for next
fall's Regional Interfraternity Con
ference, which Stanford will host
and which college representatives
from six Far Western states will
attend.
Bob Shiner, Sigma Chi, and Ray
Durham, D.U., were also candidates
for the presidency. Other secretarial
nominees were John Pollack, Zete;
Jess Hazlett, Beta; Doug McDonald,
Sigma Nu; Shiner, Durham and
