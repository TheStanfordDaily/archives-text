# U.S. Adopts Greenland While Croats Slice Up Jugoslavia for Germans
## Action Puts American Soil Within Three Miles of Combat Zone; F.R. Asks Requisition of Foreign Ships 
### BY UNITED PRESS 
The United Stales extended its sphere of military influence to within
three miles of the German war zone Thursday while the Nazis' Balkan
campaign was furthered by the Croats. They abandoned the Jugoslav
war elTort to welcome the German invaders.
The United States government announced it had assumed responsibility

>for defending the ice-capped Dan
ish island of Greenland. Southeast
ern Greenland is only three miles
from .the limit of Germany's coun
ter-blockade zone recently an
nounced as covering Iceland and ter
ritorial waters.
President Roosevelt struck at the
Axis war effort by requesting from
Congress authority to requisition
any foreign ships immobilized in
American waters—an estimated 500,-
000 tons, mostly German, Italian,
Danish, and French—in a move pre
sumably intended to free an equiva
lent amount of American shipping
for transfer to the hard-pressed
British merchant marine.
CROATS SURRENDER
Years of intense bitterness be
tween the Croats and Serbs flared
openly under pressure of Germany's
Balkan blitzkx-ieg.
Adolf Hitler's legions marched
into Zagreb, second city of Jugo
slavia and capital of the Croats, after
the venerable Dr. Vladimir Matchek,
vice-premier of the Jugoslav war
cabinet, purportedly proclaimed cre
ation of the "Free Croat State" and
told his 4,500,000 followers to wel
come the "friendly German troops."
Germany's latest bloodless tri
umph by "fifth column" tactics
came one year after the "Quislings"
of Norway had surrendered their
nation into Hitler's hands.
JUGOSLAVIA SLICED UP
Thus the complete disintegration
|pf Jugoslavia — created in the last
war and dying in this one—appeared
to be only a matter of days.
German troops had sliced off the
southern portion of Jugoslavia with
a thrust across its narrow "waist" to
the Albanian frontier, and German
secret agents had lopped off the
northern portion by skillful exploita
tion of racial hatreds.
But Jugoslavia of the center por
tion was reported battling savagely
to recapture its Vardar Valley town
of Skoplje. The Germans said
20,000 Jugoslavs had been captured
and the number was rising.
GREEKS STILL TRAPPED
In Greece the heroic troops in the
Rupel Pall of the Struma were re
ported fighting valiantly, although
cut off and apparently hopelessly
entrapped by the capitulation of
Salonika.
German tank columns were re
ported maintaining their lightning
pace by driving down the Aegean
coast upon the right flank of the
main Greek and British army at
Mount Olympus, legendary home of
the Greek gods.
Britain's troubles were extended
to northern Africa, where only a
few weeks ago her army of the Nile
was registering brilliant victories.
Lieut. Gen. Sir Richard O'Connor
and two other high ranking gen
erals, as well as 2,000 soldiers, ap
parently have been captured by
German - Italian counter - offensive,
Cairo military headquarters admit
ted.
