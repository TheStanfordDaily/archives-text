# Try, Try Again Cady Kings Bell with 'Have One on Me'
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
The story behind "Have One on
Me," Bud Cady's script selected for
the annual Spring Show to he aired
on campus May Hi and 17, is a
tale fraught with broken hopes, un
happy memories, and a Horatio Al
ger ending. Cady not only wrote
the show hut is going to dircct it.
"It all began back in '37 or '38
when I was an undergraduate," he
said yesterday. "I wanted to write a
show, but I never got around to it.
I guess I hadn't lived enough."
BRIEF ACTING CAREER
After graduation and a brief ca
reer as an actor—Cady says "very
brief"—he decided that the only way
to break into the theater was to
write a show. So in a dreary Green
wich Village apartment he and ex-
Stanfordite Hal Kahn pounded out
a show.
"It stank," says Cady.
Nothing daunted, Cady shifted to
a hotel on 63rd Street in New York,
also pretty dank, teamed up with an
other Farm graduate, J. P. Cahn, and
wrote another show.
"It also stank," says Cady.
Then the despairing author heard
that Dr. Heffner was giving a play
writing course back at Stanford.
I So he determined to come back,
I learn playwriting, and get married.
"I got married," says Cady.
j He got the idea for "Have One on

Me" last summer, and states that it
just simmered all fall. "Never would
come to a boil, dammit," he adds.
During Christmas he progressed to
the point where he had the opening
song all written, so he took it down
to the Rose Bowl and lost it. But,
by the middle of winter quarter he
had Act I all done, with Charlie
Bulotti turning up from time to time
to help with the songs.
NO SHIRKER HE
Spring vacation he worked nine
hours a day on sets for the one-acts,
then each night returned home to
write Act 11. With the advent of
the rain came the ideas, and he got
not only Act 11, but Act 111, with
the help of his wife, nee Shirley
Jones.
"I'm sorry that I didn't drink
black coffee all the time," he apolo
gized, "but I just didn't. I drank
tea. Once we tried sherry, but then
we didn't get anything done."
Song try outs for the show will be
held Monday from 3 to 6 o'clock.
The author-director announces:
"There are two women soloists
called for, plus all manner of start
ling small group and choral effects
involving both sexes. Two men have
to sing well —the others may have
adenoids."
Straight part tryouts will be an
nounced in Monday's Daily.
