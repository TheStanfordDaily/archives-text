# Rain Is Gonna Establish New Mark, Maybe
## 
### 
That "unusual" weather you hear
so much about in California visited
Stanford and vicinity yesterday —
complete with hail, thunder, and
lightning, high winds, rain and
more rain.
A more cheery side to the rain
situation was sounded last night,
however, when the Paly Times an
nounced proudly that this year's
rainfall is coming mighty near to that
of the record year of 1915. The 1941
total as of last night was 24.88
inches; the 1915 record was 2G.U4.
Yesterdays storm was short-lived,
but packed in a lot while it lasted.
After walking to morning classes in
a steady drizzle, students emerged
from their 11 o'clocks to find a stiff
wind whipping merrily about the
Quad. '
About a half-hour later the rain
started again, this time accompanied
by 'hunder and lightning, and even
tually by a hail storm that lasted
about three minutes.
The storm was too short-lived to
do any damage, and the Corporation
Yard and Boathouse both sent in
"all's well" reports.
And the weather prediction for
today is—rain, more rain.
