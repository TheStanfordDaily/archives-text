# Quad Deadline
## 
### 
The deadline for buying Quads is
rapidly approaching as the probable
publication date is set for May 20
and Business Manager Jim McKcllar
urges everyone to order his now in
stead of waiting until the last min
; ute. There will be a Quad sale on
j the step of the post office this Friday
j from 8 to 2 o'clock.
Since this edition will celebrate
the fiftieth anniversary, it will be of
interest not only to students but to
alumni, and students should buy
I theirs now before the alumni start
| ordering. There will be no extra
Quads printed after the order dead
t line. "Two hundred have been sold
| in the last two weeks, which shows
how rapidly they are going," Mc-
Kcllar says.
A particular feature of the Quad
' this year is the name of the owner
of the copy in a gold scroll.
