On paper the Winged "O" would appear heavy favorites; but Bill El
lington and Charley Hunter never know until the last minute how many
< f their entries will show up. and Stanford, with the old college try. lost

by many of the "tired
men," will score unexpected points.
A dope sheet is worth next to noth
ing for an affair such as this.
The meet will be somewhat in the
nature of an alumni gathering, with
a bunch of old Stanford men on
the Club roster. Ray Dean, the
best sprinter belonging to the
Winged "O," has been drafted and
will not compete for the Club. So
Harry Jackson, captain and dynamo
of the ex-college stars, will handle
the sprint duties, along with Earl
Ford, ex-Bear.
MUSHY TO RUN
Mushy Girard, who will long be
remembered for his display of in
testinal fortitude at Fresno last
year, is heavily favored over Seed,
Bostwick, and Skrable in the mile.
Charley Shaw, another ex-Indian,
will run the 440 for the Club against
Don McFarland, who ran a fine 49
flat Tuesday, Blair Hyde, and Cap
tain Ernie Clark. Bill McCurdy will
battle Kai Larson and Francis Olson
in the half-mile.
Bob Stone faces tough competi
tion in the javelin. The Club has
Boyd Brown, Lowell Todd, and Ed
Waterbury, all of these men having
bettered Bob's best mark of the
year.
Tom Moore, an Olympic Club
veteran, and Tom Whitney of Pep
perdine College will have a tough
time with Stanford's two new hurdle
sensations, Vern Hart and Ed Hertel.
Captain Jackson will be right on
Hertel in the lows in what may be
the closest race of the day.
TED'S BACK AGAIN
Reed and Bostwick face the
thankless task of racing three dis
tance men from California, where
they make a specialty of two
milers. Ted Vollmer, who has en
joyed ruining Stanford's ci'oss
country team in the past, will be
favored, with a top time of 9:37.8.
Feature of the field events is the
discus, in which Emerson Hiler
meets the Coast's greatest in the
person of Phil Fox, better known
to Stanfordites as Phil Levy. Fox
can hit 160 feet on most occasions
and Hiler, who is developing fast,
has a mark of 155 feet to his credit.
The high jump may develop into
a grand battle between Vern Hart
and Jim Lincoln of Stanford and
Connie Varneck and Russ Wulff of
the Olympics. Connie has been get
ting in shape by picketing Mont
gomery Ward, and has cleared 6
feet, 4 inches already this season.
Hart and Lincoln have both topped
6 feet, 3 inches, and a third Indian,
Jack Fyfe, back in the game after a
stab at pole vaulting, may get up
there.
MICHAELS FAVORED
Herb Michaels, a powerhouse, is
expected to walk off with the shot,
being the only man in the vicinity
to push the pellet over 50 feet this
year. Bill Trout and A1 Hershey,
ex-Farm weight men will put for
the Club, while Stanford's A1 Grey
will try to get in for a place.
Vic Chambers battles Tickie Vas
roncellos for broad-jump honors.
A star-studded field in the pole
vault may bring a new Angell Field
record if Connie Warmerdam, world
record holder, shows up. The Flying
Dutchman from Fresno State can
clear 14 feet just about any time.
Tony Sunseri, ex-Spartan, and Bob
Kenyon, who is one of the few
Stanford men to have cleared 14
feet, will be added Club attractions.
They oppose Ed Tomaso, Walt Mc-
Kenzie and Russ Peck of Stanford.
With a break in the weather, Stanford and the Olympic Club clash
tomorrow in a dual meet at Angell Field starting at 1:.']() o'clock.
