# Cards to Face S.C., Olympians In Swim Meets
## 
### 
At 3:30 o'clock this afternoon,
Stanford's undefeated swimming
team will tangle with P.C.C. cham
pions from the University of South
ern California, in what promises to
be the greatest battle of the con
ference. Admission is 25 cents with
student body card and 50 cents gen
eral admission.
The meet will be held in the 20-
yard pool instead of the 25-yard
pool which is the one regularly used
by both teams. The reason for this
is that the P.C.C. times are re
corded in a 20-yard pool. Due to
the fact that there are more turns
in the shorter pools, the time is a
little faster. Members of both
teams have ample reason to believe
that they will shatter P.C.C. records
today swimming under these new
conditions.
Big Roy Vitousek, Stanford's cap
tain, is aiming at breaking the 100-
yard freestyle record of 54.4, held
by Jim Hurd of Oregon. Judging
by his times last week, he should
have little trouble in turning the
trick.
Ivan Duke of S.C. and Bill Weed
en of Stanford are two lads who are
gunning for the 150-yard back
stroke record held by Sherman Wet
more of Oregon. When these two
men are in the tank together, they
will give the fans one of the best
races of the afternoon.
Out to break the old Stanford
record of 3:42.8 in the 400-yard free
style relay is the Indian quartet of
Vitousek, Doc Colyear, Don Smith
and Bob Regnolds. Vitousek will
probably set an early lead of a quar
ter length in the race and the rest
of the men will have little difficulty
in holding it.
SET FOR SATURDAY
Immediately following the track
meet Saturday, the varsity mermen
will meet the Olympic Club in the
Encina Pools. Admission will be
fx*ee and the meet will not begin
until spectators have had a chance
to get over from the track meet.
The Winged "O" lads are prob
ably the greatest aggregation of
swimmers that is now to be found
in California. Names like Bill Lu
cas, Jim Werson (former U. S.
breast-stroke champion), Emmett
Cashin, and Ray Taft are not to be
brushed off lightly; and especially
when they represent the nucleus of
a team that has not lost a dual meet
in four years.
The Stanford freshman swimmers
will hold a preliminary meet with
San Francisco J. C. at 2 o'clock.
