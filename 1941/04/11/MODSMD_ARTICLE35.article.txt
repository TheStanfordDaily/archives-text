# Frosh Prepare For All-Stars
## 
### 
Despite yesterday's heavy rains,
Clyde Jeffrey, freshman track coach,
went ahead with preparations for
the meet scheduled here for tomor
row afternoon between his Papoose
cinder men and the Peninsula High
School All-Stars. The meet will be
held along with the Stanford-
Olympic Club tilt, which will get
under way at 2 o'clock.
Although the track was too wet
to run upon yesterday, about 10
hardy freshmen during the after
noon worked out on the grass inside
the track or ran along the Embar
cadero Road, which runs near the
track, to keep in condition if the
rain does let up.
If skies remain reasonably clear
today and tomorrow, both the fresh
man and varsity contests will be
held.
The meet is urgently needed by
the first-year men, who face the
prospect of having just two or
three meets in their entire season.
This is particularly unfortunate
since the freshmen are slated to have
the best material in ten years and
excellent times could have been re
corded if the season had been a
normal one.
The Jeffreymen will compete
against the San Mateo Junior Col
lege, Wednesday, April 16, and wind
up their season against the Califor
nia freshman either April 25 or 26.
There is a possibility that a meet
may be scheduled for a week from
tomorrow.
