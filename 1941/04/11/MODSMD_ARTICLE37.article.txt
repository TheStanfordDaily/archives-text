# Pike Schedules Spring Murals
## 
### 
With 74 teams ready for compe
tition in hardball, softball, and ten
nis, Bert Pike, intramural manager,
today made final plans for the open
ing of spring quarter competition
Monday.
Included in the large entry list
are 32 softball, 12 hardball, and 30
tennis teams.
Three softball contests, beginning
at 3:05 on the intramural field, will
start things rolling Monday with
Breakers, the 1940 winner, facing
the Dekes in one of the top con
tests of the day.
Behind the stellar pitching of
Sherm Selix, the Breakers edged El
Toro in the finals last year to cop
a hotly fought mural race. Included
in their wins was a 26 to 1 shel
lacking of Encina 2E in the quar
terfinals. El Toro will see action
Monday against El Cuadro. Se
quoia will meet Chi Psi in the third
game scheduled.
The Kappa Sigs won the 1940
hardball crown while the Alpha Sigs
were the tennis champions. Tennis
is also slated to begin Monday al
though hardball will not start until
later in the week.
