# Grid Coach Plans Secret Workout
## 
### 
Although not counting too heavily |
|on good weather, Coach Clark
I Shaughnessy announced yesterday
! afternoon that a workout will be
; held on the practice field if there is
no more rain. In keeping with the '
general policy on spring practice
j sessions, this will be secret.
In yesterday's chalk talk, Coach
Shaughnessy continued with his
policy of explaining the technical
terms and gave a few more defini
tions to the new men, ending up
the blackboard drill with the dia
gramming of the first five plays that
the men have been given this year,
four running plays and one pass.
Although Loren LaPrade, former
frosh center, worked out at center
in the field drill Tuesday afternoon,
it was indicated yesterday that he
will be shifted to another line posi
tion, probably one of the guard
spots, in order to take care of holes
left by the graduation of reserve
J men from last year's squad.
