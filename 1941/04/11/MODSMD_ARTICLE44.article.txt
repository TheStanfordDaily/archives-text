# Farm Golfers To Battle Cal
## 
### SID HAYES 
Another week-end is here again
| and the "terrific Twiggsmen" are
sharpening up their iron shots and
I putting eyes in anticipation of a
bloody battle with the Berkeley
Bear.
Coach Edward Twiggs is sending
nine golfers across the bay to face
Cal. It is indeed one of the sweetest
swinging aggregations that ever rep
resented the Stanford Red.
I Playing in the No. 1 spot will be
| gawky, rawboned Bud Brownell, the
i sophomore sage from the wilds of
Carmel. Bud's sensational, subpar
shooting kept the course warm all
winter and reminded Stanford golf
enthusiasts of former heroes Lawson
Little, Art Doering, etc. In the sec
ond spot will be the old veteran,
Warren Berl. Wan-en shoots any
where from 71 to 72, depending on
wind conditions, the texture of the
fairways, and the houi's of sleep he
gets the night before. Third is Bud
Finger, the hot and cold man on
the team. Bud shoots under par
when he is hot, close to par when
he's cold. Ice would have to form
on his limbs to stop this kid.
In fourth position is Frank Tatum,
the jolting junior who putts with a
baseball bat and still clings to par
figures with the tenacity of an Eng
lish bulldog. Next is Gordon Hough,
the stoic man with a swing as smooth
as molasses. Consistency and accu
racy are this man's bywords and
when Gordy goes 10 feet off the
line of the middle of the fairway, he
hastens to the practice tee to correct
his faults. Sixth is the rotund
rifler Don Haslett who would prob
ably be first man on any other golf
team up and down the Pacific Coast
if he were not playing for the Stan
ford Red.

figures with the tenacity of an Eng
lish bulldog. Next is Gordon Hough,
the stoic man with a swing as smooth
as molasses. Consistency and accu
racy are this man's bywords and
when Gordy goes 10 feet off the
line of the middle of the fairway, he
hastens to the practice tee to correct
his faults. Sixth is the rotund
rifler Don Haslett who would prob
ably be first man on any other golf
team up and down the Pacific Coast
if he were not playing for the Stan
ford Red.
