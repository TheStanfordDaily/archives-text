AS a tribute to President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
who celebrates his sixty-sixth birthday this
Sunday, his last as President of Stanford Uni
versity, The Daily reprints the following quota
tion which appeared in the March, 1941, issue
of the Journal of the Association of American
Medical Colleges:
With the close of the present academic year
(Jan. 1, 1942—Editor's note), Dr. Wilbur will
retire from the presidency of Stanford Univer
sity after twenty-five years of service. Dr.
Wilbur is one of the outstanding personages
in the whole field of education, humanitarian
ism, pedagogy. As a teacher, dean and presi
dent he made a record which will always re
main outstanding. He accomplished many
things which improved whatever he set out
to do. He left everything better than he found
it when first contacted. He has held many
positions of influence and trust, more than
any other man of his time, and in each in
stance he has left his mark as a stimulus for
emulation by his successors. The Association
of American Medical Colleges is proud to
number Dr. Wilbur as one of its ex-presidents
after many years of service as a member of
the Executive Council. His wisdom and ex
perience contributed much to the success of
the work done by the Association. Our best
wishes for his success in whatever field he
may engage after his retirement go with him.
We say "a u revoir" not "goodbye."
