Asserting that the "superiority of
the German army is enormous,"
Archduke Otto von Hapsburg yes
terday told The Daily that France
fell not only because of fifth col
umnists but also because "France
hadn't learned anything from
Poland."
Enlarging upon this statement he
said that "the Polish leader Rydz-
Smigly made all sorts of reports on
the Nazi Army from his Rumanian
haven to France," but that "the
French wouldn't listen."
The Archduke accompanied by
Count Henry Degenfeld, arrived at
Stanford yesterday afternoon. Tall,
slender, mustachioed, he was met
by Professors Madden and Lutz and
Acting President Edgar Eugene
Robinson.
The archduke, on his first extend
ed visit to the United States, is mak
ing a tour of the nation. Through
the efforts of Professor Henry M.
Madden, the Hapsburg pretender to
the Austrian and Hungarian thrones,
came to Stanford and after being
received by Mrs. Wilbur at the Wil
bur home last night, addressed the
Farm faculty.
The young Hapsburg told The
Daily that he thought it was due
only to fifth column activities that
the Nazis have been able to make
such rapid progress in Yugoslavia.
"Though their arms are pitiful, the
Yugoslavs are very good soldiers"
the archduke said. He further stated
that the territory had so few roads
that he did not see how the German
army could have penetrated into
Yugoslavia without the aid of treach
ery. On this subject he stated that
Germany had been preparing for
her Balkan drive since 1938 or 1939
and that fifth column activities had
been going on in Yugoslavia for
several years.
On the Russian sphinx the arch
duke said that "the commynists
were in closest co-operation with
the Nazis." He discredited rumors
of Red troop movements toward
their western border as idle talk
and said that Stalin has turned his
face to the East.
Questioned on the "suicide" of
Hungary's late prime minister, Count
Teleki, Hapsburg stated that he be
lieved Teleki to have been mur
dered by the Nazis. Elaborating on
this he said that Teleki was defi
nitely pro-Ally and anti-Nazi and
that as a "healthy, active man and
a good Christian, Teleki never
would have committed suicide."
Concerning the vacant Hungarian
throne, the archduke shrugged his
shoulders and intimated that as long
as Hungary is dependent, willingly
or unwillingly, upon some other na
tion the throne will not be occupied.
The archduke visited the United
States for a few days last April to
confer with President Roosevelt.
After leaving the United States,
Hapsburg flew back to France and
on May 7 went up to his castle,
Steenoekrezel, near Brussels. Three
days later the Nazi invasion drove
him from Belgium to Paris and just
24 hours before the German army
entered Paris Otto von Hapsburg
fled to southern France. He then
proceeded to Bordeaux and from
Bordeaux came to the United
States.
The man in whose veins runs the
blood of a dozen emperors likes
this country "very, very much."
On a tour "to see the country,"
the archduke has visited many uni
versities throughout the nation.
Stanford, however, is the first west
coast school he has visited. He is
not going to Berkeley. After spend
ing a little time in San Francisco
he will head for Los Angeles to
morrow. , A i '#j

Asserting that the "superiority of
the German army is enormous,"
Archduke Otto von Hapsburg yes
terday told The Daily that France
fell not only because of fifth col
umnists but also because "France
hadn't learned anything from
Poland."
Enlarging upon this statement he
said that "the Polish leader Rydz-
Smigly made all sorts of reports on
the Nazi Army from his Rumanian
haven to France," but that "the
French wouldn't listen."
The Archduke accompanied by
Count Henry Degenfeld, arrived at
Stanford yesterday afternoon. Tall,
slender, mustachioed, he was met
by Professors Madden and Lutz and
Acting President Edgar Eugene
Robinson.
The archduke, on his first extend
ed visit to the United States, is mak
ing a tour of the nation. Through
the efforts of Professor Henry M.
Madden, the Hapsburg pretender to
the Austrian and Hungarian thrones,
came to Stanford and after being
received by Mrs. Wilbur at the Wil
bur home last night, addressed the
Farm faculty.
The young Hapsburg told The
Daily that he thought it was due
only to fifth column activities that
the Nazis have been able to make
such rapid progress in Yugoslavia.
"Though their arms are pitiful, the
Yugoslavs are very good soldiers"
the archduke said. He further stated
that the territory had so few roads
that he did not see how the German
army could have penetrated into
Yugoslavia without the aid of treach
ery. On this subject he stated that
Germany had been preparing for
her Balkan drive since 1938 or 1939
and that fifth column activities had
been going on in Yugoslavia for
several years.
On the Russian sphinx the arch
duke said that "the commynists
were in closest co-operation with
the Nazis." He discredited rumors
of Red troop movements toward
their western border as idle talk
and said that Stalin has turned his
face to the East.

Poland."
Enlarging upon this statement he
said that "the Polish leader Rydz-
Smigly made all sorts of reports on
the Nazi Army from his Rumanian
haven to France," but that "the
French wouldn't listen."
The Archduke accompanied by
Count Henry Degenfeld, arrived at
Stanford yesterday afternoon. Tall,
slender, mustachioed, he was met
by Professors Madden and Lutz and
Acting President Edgar Eugene
Robinson.
The archduke, on his first extend
ed visit to the United States, is mak
ing a tour of the nation. Through
the efforts of Professor Henry M.
Madden, the Hapsburg pretender to
the Austrian and Hungarian thrones,
came to Stanford and after being
received by Mrs. Wilbur at the Wil
bur home last night, addressed the
Farm faculty.
The young Hapsburg told The
Daily that he thought it was due
only to fifth column activities that
the Nazis have been able to make
such rapid progress in Yugoslavia.
"Though their arms are pitiful, the
Yugoslavs are very good soldiers"
the archduke said. He further stated
that the territory had so few roads
that he did not see how the German
army could have penetrated into
Yugoslavia without the aid of treach
ery. On this subject he stated that
Germany had been preparing for
her Balkan drive since 1938 or 1939
and that fifth column activities had
been going on in Yugoslavia for
several years.
On the Russian sphinx the arch
duke said that "the commynists
were in closest co-operation with
the Nazis." He discredited rumors
of Red troop movements toward
their western border as idle talk
and said that Stalin has turned his
face to the East.
Questioned on the "suicide" of
Hungary's late prime minister, Count
Teleki, Hapsburg stated that he be
lieved Teleki to have been mur
dered by the Nazis. Elaborating on
this he said that Teleki was defi
nitely pro-Ally and anti-Nazi and
that as a "healthy, active man and
a good Christian, Teleki never
would have committed suicide."
Concerning the vacant Hungarian
throne, the archduke shrugged his
shoulders and intimated that as long
as Hungary is dependent, willingly
or unwillingly, upon some other na
tion the throne will not be occupied.
The archduke visited the United
States for a few days last April to
confer with President Roosevelt.
After leaving the United States,
Hapsburg flew back to France and
on May 7 went up to his castle,
Steenoekrezel, near Brussels. Three
days later the Nazi invasion drove
him from Belgium to Paris and just
24 hours before the German army
entered Paris Otto von Hapsburg
fled to southern France. He then
proceeded to Bordeaux and from
Bordeaux came to the United
States.
The man in whose veins runs the
blood of a dozen emperors likes
this country "very, very much."
On a tour "to see the country,"
the archduke has visited many uni
versities throughout the nation.
Stanford, however, is the first west
coast school he has visited. He is
not going to Berkeley. After spend
ing a little time in San Francisco
he will head for Los Angeles to
morrow. , A i '#j
