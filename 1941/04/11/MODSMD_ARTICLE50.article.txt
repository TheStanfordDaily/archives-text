SCHEDULED to go to the polls next Tuesday
together with 86 nominated candidates and
several write-ins are two proposed changes in
the A.S.S.U. Constitution. Differing from by
laws, which Excom may create, change, or throw
out by a simple majority vote, changes in the
Constitution proper must be approved by the
student body.
On the front page of today's Daily are listed
the two proposed changes. One change is
aimed at the elimination of an awkward ob
stacle in Women's Council elections. The other
necessitates student body approval for elimi
nation of superfluous and out-dated material
in the Constitution.
The first proposed change augments the eli
gibility of women students for Women's Council
positions in both winter and spring quarter elec
tions. Women leaders have for years opposed
the regulation which puts 120 units as a requi
site for candidacy—this new provision would
slice the requirement.
It's a good move; the present regulations have
proven so cumbersome that several times Wom
en's Nomcom had to close its eyes to a "viola
tion."
The second change, listed under Article XI of
the Constitution, stands unchanged except for
the omission of non-relevant material which
serves no purpose except to make the Consti
tution almost non-understandable.
Best vote yes on the constitutional changes.
