OUR friends across the Bay under the Cam
panile have made the headlines more than
once for radical demonstrations, Communist
charges, and the like.
While Stanfordites were log-rolling their way
to spring election slates last Tuesday night, nine
members of the A.S.U.C. Excom beat down a
minority of four members and withdrew official
recognition of the American Student Union.
In 1938 when the A.S.U. was granted recog
nition at Berkeley, it was a different organization
than it is now. Even conservative Stanford had
a chapter then, and liberal-thinking students
were active in the group.
But since that time, all over the country a
great many of the "just liberal" class of students
dropped the A.b.U. like a hot potato.
They dropped it because it was openly be
ginning to blush with the unhealthy ruddiness
of Communism. Stanford's chapter went de
funct.
But at Cal they had a more fertile field—until
last Tuesday night. Now they have only the
concrete street beyond the outer extremity of
Sather Gate. They will undoubtedly still try to
cultivate the field by remote control.

Freedom of speech and beliefs is a cardinal
tenet of democracy, but that is no reason for a
university educating students at state expense
to sanction the furthering of ideas which spring
from basically anti-democratic ideas.—C. B.
