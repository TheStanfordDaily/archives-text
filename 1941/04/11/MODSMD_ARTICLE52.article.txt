STANFORD'S Rally Committee Wednesday
evening buffed away the rough edges of
the newest event on the Farm's spring quarter
calendar.
Plans for the first all-University sing-fest were
worked to near completion.
The sing-fest, first ever attempted within the
limits of the Farm, will bring together all Uni
versity undergraduate groups in friendly com
bat via the harmony route.
It's slated for the first week in May in the
Memorial Amphitheater, with trophies sched
uled for the winners.
Almost every university of any size and spirit
has been enjoying the sing-fest get-together for
some time. It's one of the most popular student
functions at each university in which it has
been installed.
Stanford will dust off its newest tradition on
May 7 in the amphitheater. And, as Rally head
Bill Kimball told committee members last Wed
nesday evening:
"With a nice spring night and a full moon—
it can't help being a success."
