### JERRY MAYER 
OH! YOU BEAUTIFUL DOLL
JJULL SESSION'S attention has been drawn to one
of the most despicable, underhanded, fallacious
publicity stunts that has ever been perpetrated upon
the American public. Texas College of Mines (we
have never heard of this institution, but judging from
its name it is located in the great Southwest, prob
ably at a location known as Mines, Texas) has laid
claim to the mythical American Intercollegiate "School
of-Beauties" Championship.
As a Stanford man steeped in local traditions, as
one who has actively supported every Stanford en
deavor for almost four years, as one who knows that
anything connected with Stanford is the acme, I per
sonally protest. No Stanford man in my position
could possibly concede the Ail-American beauty crown
to the Mines, Texas, School of Mines of Mines, Texas.
My high school should have won the championship.
Which reminds me of the time I was in grammar
school. Incidentally, I proudly claim a record of my
own (obviously nothing in the Ail-American beauty
line). I am perhaps the only person in the history of
organized education to flunk kindergarten three se
mesters in a row. I stayed out of school three years,
served a hitch in the navy, and finally went back to
graduateâ€”from kindergarten.

B u ? to get back to our narrative, lam reminded of
the time I was in grammar school and was asked
to judge a beauty contest which was held in conjunc
tion with National Health Week. Some fifteen young
girls paraded before me in their bathing suitsies for
three days and three nights (I couldn't seem to make
up my mind, and I never get sleepy).
Finally, just as the principal was about to get im
patient, I cried: "Stop! I've made my decision." The
principal beamed. "Fine," he said. "Take it away."
They caught me half-way down the block with the
little red-head tucked securely (albeit affectionately)
underneath my arm. I guess I had misunderstood him.
To get back to the Texas champions, however, the
publicity release states that "there is no doubt to the
fact that the coeds in a body far surpass the average
college trend." Which, at best, is an ambiguous claim.
Just what constitutes the average college trend in a
body? I have studied the situation at great length
(the great length was no fault of my own; I tried to
get a close-hand viewpoint with singularly poor re
sults), and from all I can see the average college trend
in a body is considerably short of standards set by
Madeleine Carroll.

jl/IY HIGH SCHOOL had the most beautiful girls
that have ever ignored me, and brother, I've
been ignored from coast to coast. I had a girl friend
in the third grade, as I remember. But she cut me
cold when I finally refused to carry her home piggy
back seven miles every day. She was the funniest girl
I've ever known. She used to call me Frankenstein,
all the time. I used to die laughing every time she
called me that. Gee, she was a riot.
Even here on the peninsula, there is a school that
should take offense at the Texans' claim to ail-
American beauty. It is a school located at Palo Alto,
and the girls constantly go out with Stanford men.
Which is the tip-off right there. No Stanford man
ever takes out a Stanford woman. Castilleja is the
school which has the beautiful women. Every Stan
ford man who can call himself a Stanford man has
been thrown out of Castilleja on his ear, at least once.
As for me, I'm going back to Stanford women while
I still have some ears left.
After all, Henry Ford may offer me a job, and I
want to hear him when he calls me.
I would also like to hear what he calls me.
