# CAMPUS OPINION
## JUNIORS ON THE PAN 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
May I ask why the Junior Class did not have
a class caucus this year? In view of the success of
last year's caucus I can see no reason why we should
not have had one. Unless, of course, certain members
of the Class of '42 had no political axes to grind which
could not be ground in row and hall caucuses.
Or is the job of senior class president too important
to leave in the hands of the students from whose
ranks the officer must be elected? It seems to me
that it is not the Row's business or the Halls' business
just who is elected to the job. In the hands of a Row
or Hall caucus, the position becomes merely some
thing to trade for a few votes.
In the caucuses which the Class of '42 has hold
before, each representative present had his chance
to say something about class elections. And if his
candidate did not win out, at least he knew that the
majority of his classmates wanted the man who did.
And he forgot it.
But this way no one is satisfied. We have a bunch
of candidates nominated by a group of people who
have not even considered whether or not the nomi
nees have the qualifications necessary for class officers.
In fact, they don't give a hoot what the candidates
are like so long as they bring in a bloc of votes.
Who's responsible for not having that caucus, any
how? How about that, Jim Haugh and Mary Jean
Haynes?
