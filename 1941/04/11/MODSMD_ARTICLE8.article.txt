The question of who assaulted
Stanford freshmen Don Allan and
Carter Barber with night sticks and
slashing fists still dangled unan
swered in the face of a stymied San
Francisco Police Commission last
night.
Although Patrolman John Des
mond and Patrol Wagon Driver Be
nito Escobar were sacked by the
three-man commission Wednesday
afternoon after they were found
guiltq on neglect of duty charges,
and two others were suspended for
90 days, no solution was forthcom
ing yesterday on the "whodunit"
stalemate.
Barber told The Daily he could
make no statement on his "personal
opinions or reactions" last night to
the Commission's action. The Com
mission also shuffled the police
force in one of the most extensive
shakeups in recent years when it
switched six captains, six lieuten
ants and 60 sergeants and patrol
men to new stations.
In an editorial labeled "A Dis
quieting Conclusion," the San Fran
cisco News commented yesterday:
"The verdict of the Commission . . .
must be interpreted as meaning that
brutality in the department is not
officially disapproved.
