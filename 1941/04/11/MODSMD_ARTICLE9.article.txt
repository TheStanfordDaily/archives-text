# STUDENTS PLUG NAVAL R.O.T.C.
## 
### 
With Encina frosh starting this
year's ball rolling through a poll of
freshman opinion, the question of
a Naval R.O.T.C. unit at Stanford has
since received the endorsement of
thie Student Emergency Defensp
Council, and the tacit approval of
Ex Committee.
Student leaders, pushed by official
notice from naval sources that only
eight more units will be established,
have since been sounding out each
aspect of the problem.
Yesterday The Daily asked each
of the following Farm men, "Do you
favor the establishment of a Naval
R.O.T.C. unit at Stanford?" The
answers follow:
Stan Glikbarg, senior R.O.T.C.
student: "I'm strongly in favor of
it. It seems to me that a naval unit
is a necessity in ensuring Stanford's
part in the national defense pro
gram."
Kingslcy Baldwin, freshman: "Yes,
I do. The navy to my way of think
ing furnishes a much more advan
tageous field of training, with the
possible exception of the army Air
Corps. I strongly believe that in
coming freshmen should be able to
choose between army and naval
training."
Colin IVlcCliiitock, junior: "I think
| so. As long as training is desirable,

In an attempt to discover the
actual extent of student body feel
ing regarding the installation of a
Naval 1i.0.T.C. unit on campus,
The Daily early next week will
attempt to poll each undergradu
ate inan on the Farm on the ques
tion.
Arrangements have already been
completed, through head Encina
sponsor Boh Dodge, to conduct
the poll of freshmen through the
E.ncina dining halls. Inter-fra
ternity Council officials have also
pledged their assistance in poll
ing (he men along Lasucn.

the men should be able to choose
between naval and army training."
John Bonn, Dean of Men: "It
seems to me that in a school such as
Stanford, with its position here on
the coast, the establishment of a
naval training unit would be ideal.
I hope it may be possible, without
complication with our present pro
gram, to secure such a unit."
A1 Ilennessy, senior: "I endorse it
most warmly. A Naval R.O. is some
thing that Stanford has always
needed. I only wish I were a fresh
man again with the opportunity to
take thus training."
John Horrall, sophomore: "Yes.

ff they're going to have an army
R.0.T.C., I believe that the estab
lishment of a naval unit is necessary
to give every incoming frosh his
choice."
Boh Dodge, senior RO.T.C. stu
dent: "I'll go on record as favoring
it. It seems to me that Stanford has
the facilities and the enrollment nec
essary to make a Naval R.O.T.C
possible, and I'd like to see it."
Harold Shafer, junior: "This pro
posal, in my opinion, is one of the
most worthy contributions that
Stanford University can make to the
national defense program. I only
regret that I will not be able to take
advantage of this opportunity should
it go into effect next year."
Frank Bauman, spohomore: "I'm
all for it. I'm not taking army train
ing here now, but should a naval
unit have been in effect when I was
a freshman in all probability I would
have joined it."
..Bruce Jessup, senior: "The es
tablishment. of a Naval R.O.T.C. is
dependent upon the ability of the
Stanford student body to support
the navy unit in addition to the ex
isting army unit. It is my opinion
that our student body can accom
plish this, and that a Naval R.O.T.C.
would furnish splendid opportuni
ties to Stanford men."
