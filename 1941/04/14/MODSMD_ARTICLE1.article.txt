### Jean Nowell 
WAS a lovely Easter.
The Soviets and the Japanese
Hot together; the Battle of the Bal
kans edged into its decisive phase
as British forces met the Nazis for
the first time—and held; the German
army in North Africa drove to with
in 290 miles of Alexandria; and the
weather was fine.
Almost unheard in all the ruckus
was the voice of Pope Pius XII who,
in his annual Easter message, held
out no hope for an early peace, and
confined his words to a plea for
"kindness ... to prisoners and the
people of occupied and trampled na
tions." He begged the belligerent
nations to refrain from the use of
"still more homicidal instruments of
warfare." (This was an apparent
reference to the use of poison gas.)
Tired and hopeless, Pius XII
symbolized civilized thought, hu
man kindness, and all the other
ideals the people of the world put
aside when they begin to settle
their arguments by force. People,
however, did listen to what he
had to say—perhaps a little nostal
gically.
But you can bet that if brutality
to conquered peoples, the unrestrict
ed use of poison gas or even beating
babies is going to win the war, they
will be used. And don't kid your
self that only the Germans will do
it. The British will skip short-term
mercy for long-term results — if
they think it'll work.
Ht ail *
() N THE surface (no one knows
what secret clauses were in
cluded) the Russo-Japanese pact is
doubt-edged, since it combined a
nice slap at Hitler with an equally
nice slap at the United States. It be
gins to look as though Russia's wait
ing game is planned to keep both
sides fighting until they are ex
hausted.
For instance, the support to Tur
key and the stand she is taking on
German aggression in the Balkans
should prolong the war in Europe.
But the Annie Oakley the So
viets handed Japan in the South
Pacific is good for a very bad head
ache in the United States, because
Japan can very effectively scotch
our aid-to-Hritain program by
starting a fuss in the Pacific. No
doubt we could fight on two
fronts, but just as surely we'd be
just about half as effective on two
fronts.
And Russia can sit back and wait
for the capitalistic and fascistic na
tions to eat each other up—like the
gingham dog and the calico cat. It's
a good idea, but it will require some
of the trickiest diplomatic fence
walking the world has ever seen.

r pHE situation in Egypt is getting
steadily worse with the Germans
claiming that Tobruk is surrounded,
and the advance German forces are
in Egypt at Solium. The British
deny the Tobruk claim, but. the ques
tion is: can the British get their
forces out of East Africa and into
Egypt in time to stop the Germans?
And even if they do stop them,
it will be next to impossible to do
any fighting during the coming hot
season. So the Nazi bombers will
be stationed just 2!)() miles from
Alexandria and 425 miles from
Suez. Salonika is a good bomber
base, too. With the Red Sea out
of the "war zone" it will be no
trick at all for the Nazis to get at
all those American mcrchantment
who will be sailing in that region.
..The Yugoslavs who have been re
ported completely licked off and on
for a week have not yet been in
formed about this fact and are
smashing into Albania. They were
last reported as being within 20
miles of the capital Tirena and the
seaport Durazzo.
Down in the south, the Serbs
trapped one entire Nazi armored
column 38 miles south of captured
Belgrade, sliced the Germans' thin
communication line, and staved off
a full force attack down the Mon
astir gorge upon the left flank of the
British-Greek line.
So far, the above-mentioned
British-Greek line is holding up
nicely. The Germans haven't even
mentioned that part of the cam
paign for two days.

Down in the south, the Serbs
trapped one entire Nazi armored
column 38 miles south of captured
Belgrade, sliced the Germans' thin
communication line, and staved off
a full force attack down the Mon

British-Greek line.

The Soviets and the Japanese

kans edged into its decisive phase
as British forces met the Nazis for
the first time—and held; the German
army in North Africa drove to with
in 290 miles of Alexandria; and the
weather was fine.
Almost unheard in all the ruckus
was the voice of Pope Pius XII who,
in his annual Easter message, held
out no hope for an early peace, and
confined his words to a plea for
"kindness ... to prisoners and the
people of occupied and trampled na
tions." He begged the belligerent
nations to refrain from the use of
"still more homicidal instruments of
warfare." (This was an apparent
reference to the use of poison gas.)
Tired and hopeless, Pius XII
symbolized civilized thought, hu
man kindness, and all the other
ideals the people of the world put
aside when they begin to settle
their arguments by force. People,
however, did listen to what he
had to say—perhaps a little nostal
gically.
But you can bet that if brutality
to conquered peoples, the unrestrict
ed use of poison gas or even beating
babies is going to win the war, they
will be used. And don't kid your
self that only the Germans will do
it. The British will skip short-term
mercy for long-term results — if
they think it'll work.

doubt-edged, since it combined a
nice slap at Hitler with an equally
nice slap at the United States. It be
gins to look as though Russia's wait

sides fighting until they are ex

For instance, the support to Tur

German aggression in the Balkans
should prolong the war in Europe.

Japan can very effectively scotch

our aid-to-Hritain program by
starting a fuss in the Pacific. No
doubt we could fight on two
fronts, but just as surely we'd be
just about half as effective on two
fronts.
And Russia can sit back and wait
for the capitalistic and fascistic na
tions to eat each other up—like the
gingham dog and the calico cat. It's
a good idea, but it will require some
of the trickiest diplomatic fence
walking the world has ever seen.

r pHE situation in Egypt is getting
steadily worse with the Germans
claiming that Tobruk is surrounded,
and the advance German forces are
in Egypt at Solium. The British
deny the Tobruk claim, but. the ques
tion is: can the British get their
forces out of East Africa and into
Egypt in time to stop the Germans?
And even if they do stop them,
it will be next to impossible to do
any fighting during the coming hot
season. So the Nazi bombers will
be stationed just 2!)() miles from
Alexandria and 425 miles from
Suez. Salonika is a good bomber
base, too. With the Red Sea out
of the "war zone" it will be no
trick at all for the Nazis to get at
all those American mcrchantment
who will be sailing in that region.
..The Yugoslavs who have been re
ported completely licked off and on
for a week have not yet been in
formed about this fact and are
smashing into Albania. They were
last reported as being within 20
miles of the capital Tirena and the
seaport Durazzo.
Down in the south, the Serbs
trapped one entire Nazi armored
column 38 miles south of captured
Belgrade, sliced the Germans' thin
communication line, and staved off
a full force attack down the Mon
astir gorge upon the left flank of the
British-Greek line.
So far, the above-mentioned
British-Greek line is holding up
nicely. The Germans haven't even
mentioned that part of the cam
paign for two days.
WAS a lovely Easter.
The Soviets and the Japanese
Hot together; the Battle of the Bal
kans edged into its decisive phase
as British forces met the Nazis for
the first time—and held; the German
army in North Africa drove to with
in 290 miles of Alexandria; and the
weather was fine.
Almost unheard in all the ruckus
was the voice of Pope Pius XII who,
in his annual Easter message, held
out no hope for an early peace, and
confined his words to a plea for
"kindness ... to prisoners and the
people of occupied and trampled na
tions." He begged the belligerent
nations to refrain from the use of
"still more homicidal instruments of
warfare." (This was an apparent
reference to the use of poison gas.)
Tired and hopeless, Pius XII
symbolized civilized thought, hu
man kindness, and all the other
ideals the people of the world put
aside when they begin to settle
their arguments by force. People,
however, did listen to what he
had to say—perhaps a little nostal
gically.
But you can bet that if brutality
to conquered peoples, the unrestrict
ed use of poison gas or even beating
babies is going to win the war, they
will be used. And don't kid your
self that only the Germans will do
it. The British will skip short-term
mercy for long-term results — if
they think it'll work.

() N THE surface (no one knows
what secret clauses were in
cluded) the Russo-Japanese pact is
doubt-edged, since it combined a
nice slap at Hitler with an equally
nice slap at the United States. It be
gins to look as though Russia's wait
ing game is planned to keep both
sides fighting until they are ex
hausted.
For instance, the support to Tur
key and the stand she is taking on
German aggression in the Balkans
should prolong the war in Europe.
But the Annie Oakley the So
viets handed Japan in the South

ache in the United States, because
Japan can very effectively scotch
our aid-to-Hritain program by
