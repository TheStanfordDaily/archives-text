# Farm Listening Post Records Foreign Broadcasts for Libe
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
In the little radio hut back of the Stanford campus near the Ryan
Electric Lab two student operators nightly switch in the 9 o'clock propa
ganda-news program from Japan and record the broadcast on phonograph
disks or on dictaphone cylinders.
Next day the broadcast is transcribed by a staff at the Hoover Library.

Thus is preserved for the historian
and political scientist the barrage of
words, ammunition in the radio
propaganda war, to be utilized in
writing of the past and in inter
preting events of the future.
Last September the Stanford lis
tening post was established by the
Hoover Library, aided by the elec
trical engineering department and
the Radio Club, and financed by the
Rockefeller Foundation. Its purpose
is to record the amount and variety
of propaganda reaching the United
States from the Orient and to pre
serve it for history, thus accom
plishing on the Pacific Coast what
the Princeton listening post does on
the Atlantic.
ENGLISH BROADCASTS
Oswald Garrison Villard Jr., tech
nical supervisor, assisted by three
other members of the Radio Club,
daily record English broadcasts from
the powerful stations in Asia. The
daily schedule follows:
Chungking, China (nationalist cap
ital) —7 a.m.; Saigon, Indo-China—
7:45 a.m.; and Tokyo—9 p.m.
In addition sample broadcasts are
recorded from Sidney, Australia;
Shanghai, Hong Kong .Manchoukuo,
and the Japanese broadcasts to
South America, Hawaii, and South
western Asia. News and commen
taries are chronicled, although pro
grams for children, music, and his
torical sketches are available.
SCRIPTS MADE
In the Hoover Library the records
and cylinders are played back to
secretaries who transcribe complete
scripts, which in turn are forwarded
to the Departments of State, War,
and Navy, and the Federal Commu
nications Commission.
In time the transcripts will be
thoroughly studied, compared with
otfier broadcasts, checked for dis
crepancies and meaningful inter
pretations.
