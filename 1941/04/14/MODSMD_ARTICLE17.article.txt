letter was written exclusively to
The Daily by Stanford's Bill Tur
ner, Student Emergency Defense
head, who is in Washington as
one of the four students in the
United States selected to meet
and to chat with President Roose
velt regarding youth's aid to Brit
ain. The letter is addressed to
Wilson Cannon, Daily Editor.)
April 9, 1941
Dear Wils:
Today has been a day of really
being on the "inside" at the nation's
capitol.
About 11 a.m. we were ushered
into the President's office in the
east wing of the White House. The
President was in the extremely cor
dial mood for which he is famous.
Incidentally, he was looking tanned
and healthy from his last fishing
trip.
. . . our short chat was light, hu
morous, yet it was to the point. . . .
Mr. Roosevelt emphasized the need
of hard work in the Middle West
and the South for promotion of aid
to Britain. I asked him if he felt
the Pacific Coast states to be sym
pathetic and he answered in effect
that the Pacific Coast is "all right."
The President closed our meeting
with a serious message. He stressed
the importance of students contact
ing the editors of local papers if they
dislike the foreigtl policy the editors
. . . advocate. He urged those in
favor of aid to Britain not to hesi

tate to write to our local editors and
criticize their stands on this question,
if opposed; or applaud the editors if
approving.
After seeing the President, we
were escorted by Mrs. Kermit Roo
sevelt all through the White House.
We met "Eleanor" coming in from
her morning horseback riding and
she invited us upstairs to the inner
sanctuaries . . . the first lady was
very kind to us and I could not help
but admire her refreshing person

ality and unassuming quick-witted
ness. She recalled, by the way, her
visit, to Stanford and graciously said
she has a soft spot in her heart for
our Farm.
The afternoon was twice as ex
citing as the morning, Wils. . . . Our
group went to visit Lord and Lady
Halifax at the British Embassy
where we hud an afternoon of pleas
ant and serious conversation and
also appeared befroe a barrage of
newsreel cameras. . . . Among the
other guests . . . were none othei
than Secretary of War Stimson, Sen
ator George of Georgia, the former
Polish Prime Minister, the Polish
Ambassador, and the Polish party
leader. . . . Contrary to the usual
diplomatic attitude, these politicos
openly discussed diplomatic afTairs
with us. In due regard to the per
sonalities present, I cannot now
quote each individually. But I can
now sadly say that 1 have every
reason to believe that we 11 be in
war within three months. By par
ticipation in war, I mean we will at
least be actually convoying goods.
Several remarks were dropped to the
efleet that "gifts" . . . will no longer
be enough. It was stressed that wc
must make up our minds and do so
quickly . . . that since the beginning
of time, nothing has ever been done
without hurting someone. . . .
Tomorrow I leave for New York,
old man, so until the Big City . . .
So long,
Bill
