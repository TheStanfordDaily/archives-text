# U.S. Studies Russo-Japan Peace Pact
## Nazis, Italians Push British into Sellum In Thrust to Suez 
### 
MOSCOW, April 13 (UP).â€”Japan
and Soviet Russia today signed a
pact of neutrality. Under terms of
the declaration, Russia recognizes
the territorial integrity and invio
lability of the Japan-sponsored state
of Manchukuo while Japan accords
the same recognition to the adjacent
Russian-sponsored Mongolian Peo
ple's Republic.
Announcement of the Russo-Japa
nese neutrality treaty exploded of
ficial Washington's Easter Sunday
calm today and sent United States
foreign policy experts and diplomats
into a study of the full implications
in relation to the world situation.
Two interpretations that found
most favor among observers were
that the pact represented:
1. A diplomatic setback for Ger
many in her Balkan drive.
2. A threat to the Anglo-American
position in the Far East.
Many thought that the treaty like
wise virtually sounded the death
knell of the anti-Comintern front.
