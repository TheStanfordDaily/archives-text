# Varsity Nine Scuttles U.C.L.A., 4-3, Deadlocks Bears in Pennant Race
## Smith Turns in Great Relief Role As Cardinals Sweep Bruin Series; Troy Doubleheader Billed for Today 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford's unpredictable varsity baseball team kicked itself right up
intq a first-place tie with California in the CIBA by virtue of its 10-
inning 4-11 win over U.C.L.A. Saturday afternoon. The victory gave the
Indians a clean sweep in the scries. Today Coach Harry Woltcr's club
toils against Southern California in its long-postponed doubleheader,

.first game starting at 1:15 o'clock
on Sunken Diamond.
Up at Edwards Field, Berkeley,
the Trojans did a Saturday matinee
flip-flop, dropping both games of
their twin bill, the first to St.
Mary's, 7-1, the second to the
Bears, 2-1.
Saturday the Cards had every
thing—hitting, pitching, and fielding
were supreme. Timely hitter of
the day was dependable center
fielder Alec Cereghino, who hit
safely with Elton Boone on second
base in the tenth frame to bring
home the deciding tally.
BUSS SMITH GREAT
Big Claude Purkitt pitched seven
masterful innings, handcuffing the
Bruin batters with one hit. The
next inning found Claude giving up
two hits and two runs, so Russ
Smith went to the mound with one
on and none out.
In his relief role, Smith turned in
the greatest hurling exhibition of
the year, striking out five of the nine
men who faced him in the two and
two-thirds innings he worked and
allowing only one scratch bingle in
the tenth. The stocky righthander
was in the driver's seat all the way
for the short time he was in the
game, completely overcoming his
mediocre performance against S.C.
during spring vacation.
THREE DOUBLE PLAYS
The Indian infield played stellar
ball, completed three double plays
for the day, stifled a like number
of Bruin rallies. Boone came up
with a fielding gem on one of the
double-killings. The Card third
baseman scooped up a grounder
i about 12 feet to the left of his nat
ural playing position, scooted back
to force a runner at the bag and
whipped the ball over to Ray Ham
mett at first in time for the putout.
Stanford came within an ace of
winning the game in the ninth inn
ing but fell victim to a bad case of
"stranditised on third base." Caruso
opened the inning with a hefty
triple to deep center and was parked
on third base for the rest of that
stanza while every attempt to score
him went for nought.
BUNT FAILS
Hal Costello tried to bunt him in,
but Caruso was forced to hold his
base, for it looked like Kirk Sinclair,
Bruin third-sacker, would catch the
ball on the fly. It fell safely, and
Sinclair nipped Costello at first,
while Caruso remained on third.
Hanlon golfed up a fly that was
too short to allow Caruso to score
after the catch, Hammett grounded
out and the game went into extra
innings.
In the tenth, fatal for the hapless
Bruins, Pitcher Rudy Hummes gave
Boone a free ticket to first. We went
to second on a passed ball and came
home on Cereghino's hit to center
field.
Cootie Thompson and either Smith
or Phil Wolf will perform on the
mound today. Tomorrow the Cardi
nals meet Santa Clara.

winning the game in the ninth inn
ing but fell victim to a bad case of
"stranditised on third base." Caruso
opened the inning with a hefty
triple to deep center and was parked
on third base for the rest of that
stanza while every attempt to score
him went for nought.
BUNT FAILS
Hal Costello tried to bunt him in,
but Caruso was forced to hold his
base, for it looked like Kirk Sinclair,
Bruin third-sacker, would catch the
ball on the fly. It fell safely, and
Sinclair nipped Costello at first,
while Caruso remained on third.
Hanlon golfed up a fly that was
too short to allow Caruso to score
after the catch, Hammett grounded
out and the game went into extra
innings.
In the tenth, fatal for the hapless
Bruins, Pitcher Rudy Hummes gave
Boone a free ticket to first. We went
to second on a passed ball and came
home on Cereghino's hit to center
field.
Cootie Thompson and either Smith
or Phil Wolf will perform on the
mound today. Tomorrow the Cardi
nals meet Santa Clara.
Stanford's unpredictable varsity baseball team kicked itself right up
intq a first-place tie with California in the CIBA by virtue of its 10-
inning 4-11 win over U.C.L.A. Saturday afternoon. The victory gave the
Indians a clean sweep in the scries. Today Coach Harry Woltcr's club
toils against Southern California in its long-postponed doubleheader,

.first game starting at 1:15 o'clock
on Sunken Diamond.
Up at Edwards Field, Berkeley,
the Trojans did a Saturday matinee
flip-flop, dropping both games of
their twin bill, the first to St.
Mary's, 7-1, the second to the
Bears, 2-1.
Saturday the Cards had every
thing—hitting, pitching, and fielding
were supreme. Timely hitter of
the day was dependable center
fielder Alec Cereghino, who hit
safely with Elton Boone on second
base in the tenth frame to bring
home the deciding tally.
BUSS SMITH GREAT
Big Claude Purkitt pitched seven
masterful innings, handcuffing the
Bruin batters with one hit. The
next inning found Claude giving up
two hits and two runs, so Russ
Smith went to the mound with one
on and none out.
In his relief role, Smith turned in
the greatest hurling exhibition of
the year, striking out five of the nine
men who faced him in the two and
two-thirds innings he worked and
allowing only one scratch bingle in
the tenth. The stocky righthander
was in the driver's seat all the way
for the short time he was in the
game, completely overcoming his
mediocre performance against S.C.
during spring vacation.
THREE DOUBLE PLAYS
The Indian infield played stellar
ball, completed three double plays
for the day, stifled a like number
of Bruin rallies. Boone came up
with a fielding gem on one of the
double-killings. The Card third
baseman scooped up a grounder
i about 12 feet to the left of his nat
ural playing position, scooted back
to force a runner at the bag and
whipped the ball over to Ray Ham
mett at first in time for the putout.
