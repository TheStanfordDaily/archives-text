# Claremont Man joins Farm Staff
## Dr. Saunders Takes Political Science Post on Faculty 
### RUTH MELLINKOFF 
Recruited from Claremont College
to teach a new course spring quar
ter at Stanford is Dr. Allen Saun
ders of the Political Science depart
ment.
Dr. Saunders, who "likes the Farm
very much" but who disapproves of
Monday 8 o'clocks and Stanford rain,
is now teaching American Political
Theory and Modern Political Theory.
FAVORS LEND-LEASE
As an undergraduate at Amherst,
Dr. Saunders was forced to admit
that he was a star goalie on the
Amherst ice-hockey team. Athough
fond of tennis, exercise is not his
l'orte. "I am perfectly willing to dip
my toes in the ocean, but I do not
enjoy swimming."
As for the European situation, Dr.
Saunders is in favor of the Lend-
Lease law, but thinks it is "un
likely and improbable" that the
United States will send men to fight
for England. While Dr. Saunders
thinks that the war will probably
end in a stalemate, he admits that a
German military defeat by England
is unlikely.
When asked whether he thought
that President Roosevelt wanted to
involve the United States in actual
war, the answer was a definite "No."
FAVORS OPEN SPACES
When questioned on the Japanese
situation, Dr. Saunders replied that
the "possibility of a Japanese inva
sion of the Stanford campus was a
mythical menace."
Dr. Saunders says that he may be
quoted as preferring San Francisco
to Los Angeles. While, in general,
he likes the wide open spaces bet
ter than the big cities, his main
objection to Los Angeles is that the
"people have too much empty space
on their faces." Hollywood, accord
ing to Dr. Saunders, is a "resort for
the frustrated."
Minor Los Angeles peeves are For
est Lawn and Aimee Semple Mac-
Pherson.
DISLIKES 8 O'CLOCKS
Dr. Saunders' favorite book of re
cent tunes is Jan Valtin's "Out of the
Night," and he definitely likes Fan
tasia. He likes classical music and
is uneducated on the subject of jazz.
Favorite magazines are Harper's, Na
tion, and the New Yorker, and Jack
Benny is the favorite comedian.
Dr. Saunders approves of class
discussion and dislikes term papers
and Monday 8 o'clocks and rain. He
will return to Claremont in the fall.

DISLIKES 8 O'CLOCKS
Dr. Saunders' favorite book of re
cent tunes is Jan Valtin's "Out of the
Night," and he definitely likes Fan
tasia. He likes classical music and
is uneducated on the subject of jazz.
Favorite magazines are Harper's, Na
tion, and the New Yorker, and Jack
Benny is the favorite comedian.
Dr. Saunders approves of class
discussion and dislikes term papers
and Monday 8 o'clocks and rain. He
will return to Claremont in the fall.
Recruited from Claremont College
to teach a new course spring quar
ter at Stanford is Dr. Allen Saun
ders of the Political Science depart
ment.
Dr. Saunders, who "likes the Farm
very much" but who disapproves of
Monday 8 o'clocks and Stanford rain,
is now teaching American Political
Theory and Modern Political Theory.
FAVORS LEND-LEASE
As an undergraduate at Amherst,
Dr. Saunders was forced to admit
that he was a star goalie on the
Amherst ice-hockey team. Athough
fond of tennis, exercise is not his
l'orte. "I am perfectly willing to dip
my toes in the ocean, but I do not
enjoy swimming."
As for the European situation, Dr.
Saunders is in favor of the Lend-
Lease law, but thinks it is "un
likely and improbable" that the
United States will send men to fight
for England. While Dr. Saunders
thinks that the war will probably
end in a stalemate, he admits that a
German military defeat by England
is unlikely.
When asked whether he thought
that President Roosevelt wanted to
involve the United States in actual
war, the answer was a definite "No."
FAVORS OPEN SPACES
When questioned on the Japanese
situation, Dr. Saunders replied that
the "possibility of a Japanese inva
sion of the Stanford campus was a
mythical menace."
Dr. Saunders says that he may be
quoted as preferring San Francisco
to Los Angeles. While, in general,
he likes the wide open spaces bet
ter than the big cities, his main
objection to Los Angeles is that the
"people have too much empty space
on their faces." Hollywood, accord
ing to Dr. Saunders, is a "resort for
the frustrated."
Minor Los Angeles peeves are For
est Lawn and Aimee Semple Mac-
Pherson.
