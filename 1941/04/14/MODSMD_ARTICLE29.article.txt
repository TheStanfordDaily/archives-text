# Ram's Head One-acts Score As 'Louie' Takes Top Honors
## 
### CHESLEY SAROYAN 
Three Ram's Head plays went on the stage of the Little Theater last
Friday and Saturday nights, and judging from the response, more than
pleased the two large student audiences.
Let's talk about the plays in the order that they appeared.
The first was Harry Muheim's "Where's Mr. Dryer?" The story wa?

sometning iiKe tnis. lvir. u.raig,
is a young married businessman, is
supposed to find a Mr. Dryer, an un
derwear magnate, and drink with
him until he can make a huge sale.
The play opens in Mr. Craig's
bedroom the mornig after. It turns
out that Ihe person he brought home
isn't Mr. Dryer but is Brownlee
Con-in. This makes everyone mad
and his boss gives him 15 minutes
to find the real Mr. Dryer or clear
out. That's about all, except that
Mr. Dryer is under the bed all the
time. The characters don't know it,
but the audience does.
SCANT JUSTIFICATION
I didn't think there was enough
to it. A play that doesn't have much
plot must have excellent incidentals
to justify itself. I didn't think that
there was enough justification.
Brownlee Corrin turned in a hu
morous performance and George
Spelvin as the elusive Dryer was
especially effective.
The second play was "Reunion of
the Crows" by Miss Alladine Bell.
The story is the tragedy of a settled
man, trying to rebel against Mor
mon conventions. He finally de
cides, persuaded by his older and
wiser sister, to give up his wild ideas
and stay on the farm.
The play runs smoothly, the dia
logue runs along very naturally, but
lor some reason it misses. In placfes
it is vague, some of the main ideas
of the play are repeated, some of the
characters are inconsistent, the end
ing not convincingly motivated.
But still it is a notable effort, pre
sented well.
In particular the acting of Jean
Nowell as the older and wiser sister
was exceptional. Frank Burt and
Bob O'Neil both handled difficult
roles with a commendable reticence,
while Joan Woodward sparkled in
the few minutes she was on stage.
'LOUIE' IS TOPS
Probably the best of the three
plays was "Louie Takes a Wife" by
A! Zelver. The story concerning the
effects of conscription on a Brooklyn
woman and her only son is human,
real, and packed with laughs.
Lome Stanley played the son with
a brilliance that marks him as one
of the Farm's best actors. His arm
and leg gestures rocked the house
time after time.
Georgette Hatfield as his mother
looked and talked very much like
his mother should look and talk.
Pally Bouchard, Hal Millen and
Quentin Warren, all fitted in per
fectly.
