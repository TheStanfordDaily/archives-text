# Beech Sports Loud Bow Tie
## 
### 
Nominating himself, as the season's
best-dressed man, Crowell Beech,
| frosh, is sporting a dazzling bow tie.
| "While stealing cigarettes from the
bowl in Phelps Terkel," Beech said,
"I suddenly decided to overthrow the
open-collar, tieless tradition at Stan
| ford."
Beech's lanky figure and red hair
! can be recognized a mile away; even
J his pink freckles are visible at a
j hundred yards. Typical of his icono-
I clastic attitude as well as his supe
! rior taste in dress is the loud or
ange-striped bow tie. "It fits my
personality and brings out my true
pastel beauty, don't you think?" he
will say, constantly adjusting the
object of his pride. "I wear it to
class, to meals, and to bed."
