### HAP EVERETT 
A powerful Olympic* Cluli track team defeated Stanlord 70 2-3 to (!ll 1-3
:it An gel I Field Saturday, but a lanky, serious Dutchman from the San
Joaquin Valley blotted out the performances of his teammates with one
of the greatest feats in athletic history.
Connie Warmerdam, discovered by Flint Hanner years ago in a spinach

patch near Hanford, amazed
spectators by hoisting himself 15 |
feet, 2% inches into the air for a ,
new world's record in the pole vault. :
On his third try at the new height,
Dutch sailed over with room to j
spare.
Taking his great performance right |
in stride, Connie had the bar put up
to 15 feet, 4 inches which he barely
missed. Everyone was high in praise
of the man who seems to have no
ceiling, and Charley Hunter ven- j
tured to predict a vault of 15 feet,
(j inches for the Flying Dutchman
this season.
Meanwhile a surprising Stanford ,
team piled up an impressive total j
against the Winged "O," making a j
fine showing for their new coach.
Pitch Johnson. Blair Hyde and
Johnny Grant gave indication that
Stanford will be a bigger threat on
the track in meets to come.

Larsen had drawn Mush out with a
blistering first lap. Grant won both j
sprints, nosing out Harry Jackson
in a 9.9 hundred, and copping the
220 in 21.8.

performance in the discus, with a
heave of 169 feet, 2 inches. Stan- j

A powerful Olympic* Cluli track team defeated Stanlord 70 2-3 to (!ll 1-3
:it An gel I Field Saturday, but a lanky, serious Dutchman from the San

of the greatest feats in athletic history.
Connie Warmerdam, discovered by Flint Hanner years ago in a spinach

patch near Hanford, amazed
spectators by hoisting himself 15 |
feet, 2% inches into the air for a ,
new world's record in the pole vault. :
On his third try at the new height,
Dutch sailed over with room to j

Taking his great performance right |
in stride, Connie had the bar put up
to 15 feet, 4 inches which he barely
missed. Everyone was high in praise
of the man who seems to have no
ceiling, and Charley Hunter ven- j
tured to predict a vault of 15 feet,
(j inches for the Flying Dutchman

Meanwhile a surprising Stanford ,
team piled up an impressive total j
against the Winged "O," making a j
fine showing for their new coach.

BLAIR, GRANT WIN
Blair nipped Captain Ernie Clark
in 48.8, the best quarter-mile run
here this year; and came back to
whip Girard in the half after Kai
Larsen had drawn Mush out with a
blistering first lap. Grant won both j
sprints, nosing out Harry Jackson
in a 9.9 hundred, and copping the
220 in 21.8.
Phil Fox turned in a remarkable
performance in the discus, with a
heave of 169 feet, 2 inches. Stan- j
ford's Em Hiler got in for a second
ahead of Arny Cornett.
The Olympics' weight squad swept j
the shot with Bill Trout at 53 feet,
