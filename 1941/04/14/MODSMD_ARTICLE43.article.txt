showed themselves to be one of the
strongest teams on the coast.
The 300-yard medley relay team
smashed the old P.C.C. record of
3:01.3 held by Oregon, when they
lopped off a solid three-tenths of a
second.
The 400-yard freestyle relay team

won by Stanford's A1 Frost, who was
closely followed by Hays Bush, also

style, won by Vitousek, who tied the
P.C.C. record of :54.4, held by Jim

OLYMPIC MEET
Swimming much better than ex
pected, the Stanford Indians bowed
down to 41-34 defeat at the hands of
a superior Olympic Club swimming
team, at Encina Pools Saturday. De
spite the defeat, Stanford turned in
some remarkable times. Chief
among these was the 400-yard free

dians swam one second and four
tenths faster than the P.C.C. record
of 3:42.2, which the same team of
Smith Regnolds, Colyear. and Vitou

P.C.C. record as such records have
to be established in intercollegiate
competition.
Vitousek swam the 50-yard free
style in :54.2, which is two-tenths
of a second faster than the P.C.C.
record which he tied in the S.C.

reason as above.

OLYMPIC MEET
Swimming much better than ex

down to 41-34 defeat at the hands of
a superior Olympic Club swimming
team, at Encina Pools Saturday. De
spite the defeat, Stanford turned in
some remarkable times. Chief

dians swam one second and four
tenths faster than the P.C.C. record
of 3:42.2, which the same team of
Smith Regnolds, Colyear. and Vitou

ever, this does not establish a new
P.C.C. record as such records have
to be established in intercollegiate
competition.
Vitousek swam the 50-yard free
style in :54.2, which is two-tenths
of a second faster than the P.C.C.

lopped off a solid three-tenths of a

OLYMPIC MEET
Swimming much better than ex
pected, the Stanford Indians bowed
down to 41-34 defeat at the hands of
a superior Olympic Club swimming
team, at Encina Pools Saturday. De
spite the defeat, Stanford turned in
some remarkable times. Chief
among these was the 400-yard free
style relay time in which the In
dians swam one second and four
tenths faster than the P.C.C. record
of 3:42.2, which the same team of
Smith Regnolds, Colyear. and Vitou
sek set Friday against S.C. How
ever, this does not establish a new
P.C.C. record as such records have
to be established in intercollegiate
competition.
Vitousek swam the 50-yard free
style in :54.2, which is two-tenths
of a second faster than the P.C.C.
record which he tied in the S.C.
meet. However, this time does not
go on the P.C.C. books for the same
reason as above.
WERSON STARS
Hero of the day for the Olympians
was Jim Werson, former world
breaststroke champion who won the
breaststroke in a walkaway. The
time was 2:37.4. Bill Lucas, also
swimming for the Club, broke the
pool record as established by Paul
Heron of Stanford, when he swam
the 220-yard freestyle in 2:14.9.
Stockton's former municipal air
port will be formally placed in use
as an Army Air Corps Advanced
Flying School.
Smashing one Conference record
and tying another, Stanford's var
sity swimmers defeated the South
ern California Trojans 49-26 and
showed themselves to be one of the
strongest teams on the coast.
The 300-yard medley relay team
smashed the old P.C.C. record of
3:01.3 held by Oregon, when they
lopped off a solid three-tenths of a
second.
The 400-yard freestyle relay team
set 3:42.2 as the official P.C.C. record
time. This is seven-tenths of a sec
ond better than the former record
as established by a Stanford team
in 1937.
OTHER RACES
Other notable races of the after
noon were the 440-yard freestyle,
won by Stanford's A1 Frost, who was
closely followed by Hays Bush, also
of Stanford; and the 100-yard free
style, won by Vitousek, who tied the
P.C.C. record of :54.4, held by Jim
Hurd of Oregon.
