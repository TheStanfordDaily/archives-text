# Berl Leads Winning Cards
## 
### SID HAYES 
The merciless Mr. Twiggs was
mighty mean last Saturday. He
turned loose his nine golfing execu
tioners on a surprisingly impotent
Berkeley Bear, and before he called
them off they had rendered the poor
animal absolutely and completely
helpless. The score was 23>/2 to 3Mj.
The Califomians were supposed to
be a fairly tough outfit on their
home course, but only the mediocre
performances of a pair of Indian
divoteers kept the men from Berke
ley from suffering a thorough
whitewashing. In short, the despised
Bears were no match for our Red
skins.
It was Warren Berl who led the
assault on Saturday. The wiry vet
eran fairly blistered the Berkeley
course with rounds of 69-68, and
once again appeared to be in the
same form that carried him to the
finals of the national intercollegiate
championship in 1939. Bud Brownell
continued his winning ways in the
singles and then teamed with the
slashing, drawling Okie, Dee Re
plogle, to chalk up another victory
in the afternoon.
The other Indian victories were
accomplished by Frank Tatum and
Gordon Hough in singles matches
and by the doubles team of Guy
Showley and George Bradley. The
3V2-point deficit divided between
Bud Finger and Don Haslett is un
doubtedly a sore subject to the boys,
but 23 l / 2 to 31/2 is bad enough.
