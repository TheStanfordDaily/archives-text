# Spring Show Tryouts Today
## 
### 
With the statement that "expe
rience is not necessary, but it sure
would help," Bud Cady, author
director of this year's Spring Show,
"Have One on Me," yesterday an
nounced the full tryout schedule.
This afternoon from 2 to 6 o'clock
all singing tryouts will be held on
the main stage of Memorial Hall.
Cady emphasized that everyone try
ing out for singing must bring their
own music, and it would be appre
ciated if the tryoutees would bring
sheet music which has guitar or uke
cords on it.
"If you absolutely cannot get it,
sing something familiar to everyone
â€”and vary your offerings with
sweet and strictly hep stuff," he
added.
Tryouts for speaking parts will be
from 7 to 10 o'clock tonight in the
Little Theater and tomorrow after
noon from 1 to 6 o'clock in the Ram's
Head room. According to Cady,
anyone who hopes to be in the show
must come around and sing, "even
if you know you're bad."
Much of the singing will be choral,
and the script calls for a German
band, of about five pieces. Instru
mentalists are asked to get in touch
with either Cady, Bill Quinn, or Hal
Moreno, all of whom will be pres
ent at each tryout.
"Also, let's not have anybody get
too sure they won't fit in," Cady
said. "This year there will be un
derstudies for each principal part,
and these understudies will either
be in the chorus or will be given
small roles."
