# Trojan Netmen Shade Indians
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis men
made a gallant fight for the confer
ence net crown Friday afternoon,
but finally bowed, 5-4, before the
powt rful Southern California team.
The Indians came hack Saturday to
humble U.C.L.A., 6-3.
The surprise performance of the
afternoon was turned in by Emery J
Neale, a Portland sophomore. After
number one man Larry Dee had
been swept off the courts by Trojan
Ted Olewine, and after Jimmy
Wade lost to the smooth-stroking
Bill Reedy, the Lanky Neale put his
unorthodox strokes to work to upet 1
stylist George Toley 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. j
Captain Bob Low, after battling
courageously for three hours, finally
fell before the hard-serving, smash
ing Charles Mattman. Low had
match point twice at 5-3 in the third
set, but Mattman fought back to win
12-10, 5-7, 16-14.
In Saturday's match with the
Bruins the Indians proved too po- i
tent for U.C.L.A.. sweeping five of
the singles matches and one of the
doubles.
Neale, playing the number one j
spot for Larry Dee, who competed j
at Del Monte, drubbed Dick Dear
don of the Bruins 6-3, 6-1.
