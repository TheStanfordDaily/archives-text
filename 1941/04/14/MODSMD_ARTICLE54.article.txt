# Gurk vs. Murgatroyd
## 
### 
THOSE little slips of blue or white paper, the
ballots which the Farm electorate will ink
tomorrow indicative of their choice for next
year's student body officers, have all too often
been plaintively dinged as "too darned com
plicated to understand."
The wail is nothing new. Nor is it a problem
that only freshmen, new to the system, meet.
It's a problem that conversely gathers more
and more moss as it rolls along.
Most of the misunderstandings arise from a
carry-over of the old-time political maxim, "Don't
give your strongest opponent any votes."
Even if your strong opponent is the guy
whom, next to yourself, you would like to see
win.
That maxim held up well under the old system
of voting. But under the preferntial ballot the
opposite is true.
Take, for example, a hypothetical case with
hypothetical candidates running for a student
body office. The voting is done under the pref
erential system.
Emery Bellwether, Joe Gurk, Ken Jones, and
Clark Murgatroyd are candidates.
On the first ballot:
Bellwether 500 first-choice votes
Gurk 500 first-choice votes
Murgatroyd 400 first-choice votes
Jones 600 first-choice votes
A majority of the votes cast is necessary for
election. Jones, the leader, polled 600, which is
not a majority of the 2,000 votes cast.
Murgatroyd, the trailer, is eliminated from
the running. He was first choice on 400 ballots.
These 400 ballots, and these alone, are recon
sidered and their second-choice votes tabulated.
Bellwether—2oo of them for a total of 700
votes.
Gurk—loo of them for a total of 600 votes.
Jones —100 of them for a total of 700 votes.
Again none of the candidates has a majority
of the 2,000 votes cast.
Gurk, lowest man, is eliminated from the run
ning. His 600 ballots, and these alone, are recon
sidered. The next-choice votes on these bal
lots are now tabulated.
Bellwether—4oo of them for a total of 1,100.
Jones —200 of them for a total of 900.
Bellwether now has the necessary majority,
and the election.
Now look back over the hypothetical ballot
ing and notice these essentials:
(1) The second-choice votes on the ballots
which named Bellwether and Jones as first
choices were never considered.
(Second-choice votes are never considered
until the candidate is the lowest man in the
tabulation, and therefore eliminated.)
(2) A majority of the total votes cast is neces
sary for election.
(Should on candidate have a majority on the
lirst tabulation, no counting ot second choices,
etc., is needed.)
Now, coming back again to the old political
maxim, "Don't give your strongest opponent
any votes," even if he is the guy whom, next to
yourself, you would like to see win.
Consider yourself Gurk's manager. Naturally
you want to see him win. But if he can't win you
would like to see Bellwether elected. You don't
want to see Jones win under any circumstances.
After Murgatroyd was eliminated, Bellwether,
Jones, and your man Gurk divided his second
choice ballots. Unfortunately Gurk then became
last-place man, and thus is out of the running.
The second-choice votes on Gurk's ballots are
then tabulated. You were afraid Bellwether was
the man to beat so you gave all second choices
on Gurk's ballots to Jones. Jones, the man you
did not want to see win under any circum
stances, thus rides in to victory.
Just remember this:
(1) There is nothing inherently tricky about
the preferential system of voting. It wasn't de
vised to confuse you.
(2) Vote for your candidates in the order you
prefer them.

(2) Vote for your candidates in the order you
prefer them.
THOSE little slips of blue or white paper, the
ballots which the Farm electorate will ink
tomorrow indicative of their choice for next
year's student body officers, have all too often
been plaintively dinged as "too darned com
plicated to understand."
The wail is nothing new. Nor is it a problem
that only freshmen, new to the system, meet.
It's a problem that conversely gathers more
and more moss as it rolls along.
Most of the misunderstandings arise from a
carry-over of the old-time political maxim, "Don't
give your strongest opponent any votes."
Even if your strong opponent is the guy
whom, next to yourself, you would like to see
win.
That maxim held up well under the old system
of voting. But under the preferntial ballot the
opposite is true.
Take, for example, a hypothetical case with
hypothetical candidates running for a student
body office. The voting is done under the pref
erential system.
Emery Bellwether, Joe Gurk, Ken Jones, and
Clark Murgatroyd are candidates.
On the first ballot:
Bellwether 500 first-choice votes
Gurk 500 first-choice votes
Murgatroyd 400 first-choice votes
Jones 600 first-choice votes
A majority of the votes cast is necessary for
election. Jones, the leader, polled 600, which is
not a majority of the 2,000 votes cast.
Murgatroyd, the trailer, is eliminated from
the running. He was first choice on 400 ballots.
These 400 ballots, and these alone, are recon
sidered and their second-choice votes tabulated.
Bellwether—2oo of them for a total of 700
votes.
Gurk—loo of them for a total of 600 votes.
Jones —100 of them for a total of 700 votes.
Again none of the candidates has a majority
of the 2,000 votes cast.
Gurk, lowest man, is eliminated from the run
ning. His 600 ballots, and these alone, are recon
sidered. The next-choice votes on these bal
lots are now tabulated.
Bellwether—4oo of them for a total of 1,100.
Jones —200 of them for a total of 900.
Bellwether now has the necessary majority,
and the election.
Now look back over the hypothetical ballot
ing and notice these essentials:
(1) The second-choice votes on the ballots
which named Bellwether and Jones as first
choices were never considered.
(Second-choice votes are never considered
until the candidate is the lowest man in the
tabulation, and therefore eliminated.)
(2) A majority of the total votes cast is neces
sary for election.
(Should on candidate have a majority on the
lirst tabulation, no counting ot second choices,
etc., is needed.)
Now, coming back again to the old political
maxim, "Don't give your strongest opponent
any votes," even if he is the guy whom, next to
yourself, you would like to see win.
Consider yourself Gurk's manager. Naturally
you want to see him win. But if he can't win you
would like to see Bellwether elected. You don't
want to see Jones win under any circumstances.
After Murgatroyd was eliminated, Bellwether,
Jones, and your man Gurk divided his second
choice ballots. Unfortunately Gurk then became
last-place man, and thus is out of the running.
The second-choice votes on Gurk's ballots are
then tabulated. You were afraid Bellwether was
the man to beat so you gave all second choices
on Gurk's ballots to Jones. Jones, the man you
did not want to see win under any circum
stances, thus rides in to victory.
Just remember this:
(1) There is nothing inherently tricky about
the preferential system of voting. It wasn't de
vised to confuse you.

the preferential system of voting. It wasn't de
vised to confuse you.
(2) Vote for your candidates in the order you
prefer them.
THOSE little slips of blue or white paper, the
ballots which the Farm electorate will ink
tomorrow indicative of their choice for next
year's student body officers, have all too often
been plaintively dinged as "too darned com
plicated to understand."
The wail is nothing new. Nor is it a problem
that only freshmen, new to the system, meet.
It's a problem that conversely gathers more
and more moss as it rolls along.
Most of the misunderstandings arise from a
carry-over of the old-time political maxim, "Don't
give your strongest opponent any votes."
Even if your strong opponent is the guy
whom, next to yourself, you would like to see
win.
That maxim held up well under the old system
of voting. But under the preferntial ballot the
opposite is true.
Take, for example, a hypothetical case with
hypothetical candidates running for a student
body office. The voting is done under the pref
erential system.
Emery Bellwether, Joe Gurk, Ken Jones, and
Clark Murgatroyd are candidates.
On the first ballot:
Bellwether 500 first-choice votes
Gurk 500 first-choice votes
Murgatroyd 400 first-choice votes
Jones 600 first-choice votes
A majority of the votes cast is necessary for
election. Jones, the leader, polled 600, which is
not a majority of the 2,000 votes cast.
Murgatroyd, the trailer, is eliminated from
the running. He was first choice on 400 ballots.
These 400 ballots, and these alone, are recon
sidered and their second-choice votes tabulated.
Bellwether—2oo of them for a total of 700
votes.
Gurk—loo of them for a total of 600 votes.
Jones —100 of them for a total of 700 votes.
Again none of the candidates has a majority
of the 2,000 votes cast.
Gurk, lowest man, is eliminated from the run
ning. His 600 ballots, and these alone, are recon
sidered. The next-choice votes on these bal
lots are now tabulated.
Bellwether—4oo of them for a total of 1,100.
Jones —200 of them for a total of 900.
Bellwether now has the necessary majority,
and the election.
Now look back over the hypothetical ballot
ing and notice these essentials:
(1) The second-choice votes on the ballots
which named Bellwether and Jones as first
choices were never considered.
(Second-choice votes are never considered
until the candidate is the lowest man in the
tabulation, and therefore eliminated.)
(2) A majority of the total votes cast is neces
sary for election.
(Should on candidate have a majority on the
lirst tabulation, no counting ot second choices,
etc., is needed.)
Now, coming back again to the old political
maxim, "Don't give your strongest opponent
any votes," even if he is the guy whom, next to
yourself, you would like to see win.
Consider yourself Gurk's manager. Naturally
you want to see him win. But if he can't win you
would like to see Bellwether elected. You don't
want to see Jones win under any circumstances.
After Murgatroyd was eliminated, Bellwether,
Jones, and your man Gurk divided his second
choice ballots. Unfortunately Gurk then became
last-place man, and thus is out of the running.
The second-choice votes on Gurk's ballots are
then tabulated. You were afraid Bellwether was
the man to beat so you gave all second choices
on Gurk's ballots to Jones. Jones, the man you
did not want to see win under any circum
stances, thus rides in to victory.
Just remember this:
(1) There is nothing inherently tricky about
the preferential system of voting. It wasn't de
vised to confuse you.
(2) Vote for your candidates in the order you
prefer them.
