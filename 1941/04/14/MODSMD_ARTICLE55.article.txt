# Well. "All Right" ...?

PERHAPS prodded by Mrs. Roosevelt, who
lectured here at Stanford last year, the Presi
dent recently invited Stanford to send a student
delegate to the White House for a chat concern
ing the part that America's youth is to play in the
Aid-to Britain program. Doubly significant is
the fact that Stanford was one of just four uni
versities in the entire United States invited to
send a delegate.
So off to Washington went Bill Turner, the
Farm's Student Defense chairman, despite the
fact that he looked nothing like Deanna Durbin
or Mickey Rooney. Last week-end Turner met
and spoke with President Roosevelt and diplo
mats from foreign lands.
Regarding Pacific Coast feeling for the present

and future program of Aid-to-Britain, President
Roosevelt expressed to Turner his belief that the
West is "all right." Then, after chatting with
Washington diplomats, Bill wrote back to the
Farm their sentiments which read:
"I can now sadly say that I have every reason
to believe that we'll be in war within three
months. By participation in war I mean we will
kat least be actually convoying goods."
Apparently Stanford's right hand, in Wash
ington, did not know what its left hand, in Palo
Alto, was doing. Apparently the West Coast
was not, as President Roosevelt put it, "all
right."
For here on the Farm, three busy students
were circulating a petition which read across
the top:
"We, the undersigned Stanford University
students, with the idea of keeping America out
of war, believe that war materials should not be
convoyed overseas by American ships or sea
men."
Already over 1,000 of Stanford's 4,000 odd
students have signed this petition in the first
three days. Another week will probably show
mounting and startling results, and undoubt
edly not the "all right" results which the Presi
dent mentioned in his conference with Bill
Turner.
But as contradictory as this petition may seem,
it is none the less what President Roosevelt has
sought. Repeatedly he has asked the American
public to express to editors their opinion re
garding steps in the Aid-to-Britain program.
Stanford merely answers the challenge.
As the Timeish magazine Newsweek adver
tises, "A well-informed public is America's best
defense." A well-informed President will help
matters too.—B. A.

Turner.
But as contradictory as this petition may seem,
it is none the less what President Roosevelt has
sought. Repeatedly he has asked the American
public to express to editors their opinion re
garding steps in the Aid-to-Britain program.
Stanford merely answers the challenge.
As the Timeish magazine Newsweek adver
tises, "A well-informed public is America's best
defense." A well-informed President will help
matters too.—B. A.
PERHAPS prodded by Mrs. Roosevelt, who
lectured here at Stanford last year, the Presi
dent recently invited Stanford to send a student
delegate to the White House for a chat concern
ing the part that America's youth is to play in the
Aid-to Britain program. Doubly significant is
the fact that Stanford was one of just four uni
versities in the entire United States invited to
send a delegate.
So off to Washington went Bill Turner, the
Farm's Student Defense chairman, despite the
fact that he looked nothing like Deanna Durbin
or Mickey Rooney. Last week-end Turner met
and spoke with President Roosevelt and diplo
mats from foreign lands.
Regarding Pacific Coast feeling for the present

and future program of Aid-to-Britain, President
Roosevelt expressed to Turner his belief that the
West is "all right." Then, after chatting with
Washington diplomats, Bill wrote back to the
Farm their sentiments which read:
"I can now sadly say that I have every reason
to believe that we'll be in war within three
months. By participation in war I mean we will
kat least be actually convoying goods."
Apparently Stanford's right hand, in Wash
ington, did not know what its left hand, in Palo
Alto, was doing. Apparently the West Coast
was not, as President Roosevelt put it, "all
right."
For here on the Farm, three busy students
were circulating a petition which read across
the top:
"We, the undersigned Stanford University
students, with the idea of keeping America out
of war, believe that war materials should not be
convoyed overseas by American ships or sea
men."
Already over 1,000 of Stanford's 4,000 odd
students have signed this petition in the first
three days. Another week will probably show
mounting and startling results, and undoubt
edly not the "all right" results which the Presi
dent mentioned in his conference with Bill
Turner.
