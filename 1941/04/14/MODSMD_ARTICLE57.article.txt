### JERRY MAYER 
THE LESSON FOR TODAY
SESSION decided last Saturday that enough
was enough. It's perfectly all right for some
people to sit around and live like parasites off their
parents, never earning a cent, never doing a bit of
self-supporting work. In college, especially, is this
condition found to be true. But I decided that I
was too much of a man to sit around and do nothing
constructive to earn my own way except cash my
father's checks. The time had come for me to take
matters into my own hands and earn my keep by my
own intelligence and hard work.
I went to the races at Bay Meadows.
I went with one of my roommates—the one who
sits down so much he has to stand up to rest. We de
sided that we would take only a small amount of
cash. We decided that because we are naturally fru
gal, because we didn't feel we are entitled to squander
our parents' money, because we didn't think it was
the thing to do, and because none of our other room
mates would lend us a cent.
"> * « *
£N THE first race everything was fine. Our horse led
all the way. He was a beautiful horse, and he had
a fine jockey. It was just like depositing money in
the bank. A sure thing. We giggled like Stanford
women. We pounded each other on the back. We
tickled the chin of the beautiful blonde standing be
hind us. We were the happiest guys alive. The only
trouble was that our horse got lonesome. He waited
for another nag to catch up with him. It developed into
a photo finish, and then we received an awful blow.
Our &% V2'*" horse was camera shy.
* * * *
B U I we still had seven races to get us out in front.
The story is old. We just couldn't get on the right
horse. Things got so tough that in one race the jockey
refused to ride a horse because we had bet on him.
Our beetle in the fifth race finished so far hack that
he almost got into a photo finish with the \Tinner of
the sixth race.
We would like to report that we hit a long shot
right on the nose in the last race and walked away
with a profit. As a matter of record, we hit our horse
right on the nose with a beer bottle and walked away
with the blonde whose chin we had been tickling.
But on our way home, munching jelly beans and
whistling at all the little high school girls, we realized
that we had learned a great lesson:
Never work for an - honest penny, because Roose
velt will get it from you anyway. Or:
A horse is like a beautiful woman. They both run
wide on the curves and are fast on the stretch—for a
scotch and water.

SESSION decided last Saturday that enough
was enough. It's perfectly all right for some
people to sit around and live like parasites off their
parents, never earning a cent, never doing a bit of
self-supporting work. In college, especially, is this
condition found to be true. But I decided that I
was too much of a man to sit around and do nothing
constructive to earn my own way except cash my
father's checks. The time had come for me to take
matters into my own hands and earn my keep by my
own intelligence and hard work.
I went to the races at Bay Meadows.
I went with one of my roommates—the one who
sits down so much he has to stand up to rest. We de
sided that we would take only a small amount of
cash. We decided that because we are naturally fru
gal, because we didn't feel we are entitled to squander
our parents' money, because we didn't think it was
the thing to do, and because none of our other room
mates would lend us a cent.
"> * « *
£N THE first race everything was fine. Our horse led
all the way. He was a beautiful horse, and he had
a fine jockey. It was just like depositing money in
the bank. A sure thing. We giggled like Stanford
women. We pounded each other on the back. We
tickled the chin of the beautiful blonde standing be
hind us. We were the happiest guys alive. The only
trouble was that our horse got lonesome. He waited
for another nag to catch up with him. It developed into
a photo finish, and then we received an awful blow.
Our &% V2'*" horse was camera shy.
* * * *
B U I we still had seven races to get us out in front.
The story is old. We just couldn't get on the right
horse. Things got so tough that in one race the jockey
refused to ride a horse because we had bet on him.
Our beetle in the fifth race finished so far hack that
he almost got into a photo finish with the \Tinner of
the sixth race.
We would like to report that we hit a long shot
right on the nose in the last race and walked away
with a profit. As a matter of record, we hit our horse
right on the nose with a beer bottle and walked away
with the blonde whose chin we had been tickling.
But on our way home, munching jelly beans and
whistling at all the little high school girls, we realized
that we had learned a great lesson:
Never work for an - honest penny, because Roose
velt will get it from you anyway. Or:
A horse is like a beautiful woman. They both run
wide on the curves and are fast on the stretch—for a
scotch and water.
