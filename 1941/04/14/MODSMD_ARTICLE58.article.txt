r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
In reply to Mr. Philip Dirstinc and regarding
Mr. Nye.
It seems to me that. Mr. Dirstine is overlooking one
very important point in his letter. That is the fact
that under our form of government we believe in
hearing both sides of an argument before making a
decision.
That is the point the boys were peeved about. The
fact that one administration denied the senator the
right to speak here was in direct opposition to that
policy, for it made it difficult, and in some cases im
possible to get to hear him talk.
Because we want to hear the senator speak does
not necessarily mean that we side with him.
