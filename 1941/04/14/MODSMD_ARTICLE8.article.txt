"Easter time is da time for eggs
and da time for da eggs is da Easter
time."
So saying two Lagunita girls
jumped in their car last Saturday
afternoon to go duck hunting. They
came back with two fuzzy little
balls of yellow fur named Cynthia
and Viceroy, called "Cyn" and
"Vice" for short.
The ducks, which are now resid
ing in a pen back of Lagunita, went
for their first swim yesterday in a
mud puddle left over from the
rains. Their owners are anxiously
awaiting the birth of some little
"Vices" and "Cyns" which they pro
pose to name "Drink," "Covetous
ness" and the rest of the seven sins
in the order of their arrival.
