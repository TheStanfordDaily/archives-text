YOU paid your money and took
your choice on the Battle of
the Balkans reports yesterday. Ac
cording to Athens, London, and
Yugoslav reports from Vichy, things
didn't look so bad. According to
Rome and Berlin the position of the
Allies couldn't have been much
worse.
But there was no question about
the Battle of Libya and Egypt.
Cairo and Berlin saw eye to eye
on their statements about that sit
uation, and the communiques pre
sented a very unlovely sight to the
Democracies.
Desert warfare is supposed to de
pend not on territory taken but on
the number of enemy lighting units
put out of action. Supposedly there
are about 40,000 men in surrounded
Tobruk, and if the Nazis can take
these divisions and their motorized
equipment the capture should con
stitute quite an achievement.

|T MAY be that the British, still
fighting furiously in this city, will
be forced to get out by sea as they
did at Dunkirk. (Although Nazi
propagandists are trying to put the
"second Dunkirk" on Greek soil.)
With the British withdrawal to
Marsa Mat rub practically an ac
complished fact, it is safe to as
sume that the hulk of the newly
released Ethiopian forces are lined
up there. In the realm of hopeful
thinking you could say that the
amazing rapidity of the Nazi ad
vance under General Rommel has
accomplished just about the same
thing that happened to the Ital
ians in their march to the same
positions.
Even now the "panzer" forces are
getting their water and fuel by
plane. Communications in an ad
vance of this sort must be strung
out ana can not be well protectedâ€”
easy bomb targets. Just the same,
Marsa Matruh is 100 miles inside
of the Egyptian border, and the
British haven't been able to stop
the Nazis yet.

HPHIS "withdrawal to new posi
tions" along the eastern wing of
the allied lines in Greece, admitted
in London, is still a far cry from
the "Dunkirk withdrawal" the Ger
man propaganda ministry has been
blasting about; but they did retreat.
The fact that the action took place
Saturday night after a "defeat of a
crack S.S. division" and was not an
nounced till today makes you won
der just; what other "unannounced
things" have been happening since
then.
From the Berlin correspondent
of the United Press came an ar
ticle which must have gotten out
for a reason. Just what reason is
not clear. According to Joseph
Griggs, the controlled press is giv
ing a gloomy account of the Nazi
troops' predicament in Greece, ap
parently as a precautionary no
tice to the people not to expect
ready successes against the British
and Greek forces. The Berlin
press is also hinting that the
Balkan forces are iinding the
Greeks formidable foes.
If this dispatch was not an over
sight on the part of the propaganda
ministry (which is unlikely) there
must be some reason for letting it
out. Maybe it's to make the German
victories, when and if they come, ap
pear all the more commendable.

|>UT neither side has reported a
large-scale battle, so the real
test is yet to come. This delay may
be because the Germans are pausing
to mop up Yugoslavia. They are
trying to pour a huge force down
through the Monastir gorge, and
little has come through yet, so per
haps this is what is holding up the
proceedings.
Sarajevo, the provisional Yugo
slav capital, announced jubilantly
yesterday that the bulk of the
Yugoslav army had fought its way
out of the German trap. If it is
they who are holding up that ad
vance through Monastir they arc
proving themselves line allies, in
spite of their original poor show
ing.
The Italians claim to have taken
Koritza in Albania, while the Yugo
slavs claimed to have taken Durazzo
and be near taking the capital,
Tirana.
