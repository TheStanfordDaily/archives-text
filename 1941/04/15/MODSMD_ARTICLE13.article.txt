# STANFORD OPPOSES U.S. CONVOYS

### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Stanford opposes the use of American war
ships to convoy British merchantmen across
the Atlantic.
In a survey of campus opinion conducted
yesterday by The Daily, 72 per cent of the
cross section voted against American con
voys. Favoring convoys are 25 per cent of
the campus, and 3 per cent are undecided.
However, the cross section splits on the ques
tion of whether or not the United States should
loan its warships to Britain for convoy service.
Forty-five per cent favor such a measure, 42 per
cent oppose, and 13 per cent are undecided.
The question asked was, "If a decision is
made against convoying, would you favor the
loan of American warships to Britain to be used
in convoy work with British crews under the
British flag?"
An analysis of the cross section reveals that
women students are less emphatic in opposing
the loan of American warships than are the men.
A similar trend is seen in the original question

of U.S. convoys for British ships. The tabulation
is as follows:
Unde-
Favor Oppose cided
Women 27% 66% 7%
Men 25% 74% 1%
Another significant trend is that seniors and
graduates, students most vitally concerned with
any future conflict involving this country, were
less emphatic in condemning United States con
voys than underclassmen. In fact, only 52 per
cent of the graduate students oppose the meas
ure. A majority of graduate women favor con
voys, the only group to do so.
Commenting on the questions, many stu
dents expressed themselves against convoys,
but said such a measure is inevitable, that the
leaders of the nation have already decided
on convoys. Others explained that "we might
desperately need the ships ourselves."
The typical comment was, "Convoys mean
war for the United States."
