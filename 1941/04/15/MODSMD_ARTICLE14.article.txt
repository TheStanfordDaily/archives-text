# REPRESENTATION

(Editorial)
A REPRESENTATIVE cross-section of the Farm electorate to
day will notice the four ballot boxes along the Quad; take
the five minutes necessary to ink the ballots; and will elect the
student body officers for the ensuing school year.
The rest of the student body will convene at 10 o'clock coke
club, as usual, and will let the rest of the world go by.
Experience has proved that this will be the case.
And while experience has also proved that the Farm's student
body leaders have been, almost without exception, men and
women of the highest caliber, it's a crying shame that student
candidates should be elected by a bare majority of the student
body.
Over the last four years, only slightly more than half of the
Farm has bothered to vote at the yearly spring elections—elec
tions which carry twice the importance of the mid-year balloting.
Look at the figures:
Year Votes Cast Enrollment
1940 2,111 3,995
1939 1.849 3.639
1938 2.033 3,590
1937 1,744 3,603
The figures hardly compliment student interest in undergrad
uate affairs.
Democracy to the American way of thinking is the best of all
possible ways of life. Representation in the affairs of the student
body is one of the keynotes of the Farm system.
Both democracy and representation flutter into mere watch
words, when the voters don't voice their desires at the polls.
Today 87 Farm men and women stand for election to the 31
most important undergraduate positions. They will be at the top
of the student body picture next year. Their decisions will mark
out the course which the student body will take.
You'd think the student body would be interested enough to
take five minutes off this morning to decide who these leaders
will be.

club, as usual, and will let the rest of the world go by.
Experience has proved that this will be the case.
And while experience has also proved that the Farm's student
body leaders have been, almost without exception, men and
women of the highest caliber, it's a crying shame that student
candidates should be elected by a bare majority of the student
body.
Over the last four years, only slightly more than half of the
Farm has bothered to vote at the yearly spring elections—elec
tions which carry twice the importance of the mid-year balloting.
Look at the figures:
Year Votes Cast Enrollment
1940 2,111 3,995
1939 1.849 3.639
1938 2.033 3,590
1937 1,744 3,603
The figures hardly compliment student interest in undergrad
uate affairs.
Democracy to the American way of thinking is the best of all
possible ways of life. Representation in the affairs of the student
body is one of the keynotes of the Farm system.
Both democracy and representation flutter into mere watch
words, when the voters don't voice their desires at the polls.
Today 87 Farm men and women stand for election to the 31
most important undergraduate positions. They will be at the top
of the student body picture next year. Their decisions will mark
out the course which the student body will take.
You'd think the student body would be interested enough to
take five minutes off this morning to decide who these leaders
will be.
