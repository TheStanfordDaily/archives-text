# Excom Will Vote Tonight On Magazine
## Publications Council Recommends Plans On Literary Attempt 
### 
For the fifth time in 50 years Stan
ford will support a literary maga
zine as okayed by Publications
Council yesterday, if Ex Committee
sees fit to accept the recommenda
tion tonight at the regular 7:15 meet
ing in the A.S.S.U. committee room.
Proposed by Clarence Burley and
John Tornlinson, the magazine would
not be strictly literary, but would
carry articles of general interest on
science and politics, "so as to be rep
resentative of the whole College."
NON-PROFIT
The new publication would be
composed of 32 pages, 9 by 12 inches,
and published nine times a year. It
would be a non-profit enterprise, to
be supported by national advertis
ing and sales. From 350 to 450 copies
of each issue would be printed and
sold at 20 cents each. Four trial
issues were recommended by the
Council, the first to appear this
spring.
Forebears of the new magazine, if
accepted, are the Stanford Sequoia,
the Stanford Illustrated Review, now
published by the Alumni Associa
tion, the Stanford Lit, the Cardinal,
and the Spectator.
OTHER BUSINESS
Other business on tonight's docket
includes possible appointment of a
new Concert Series manager to re
place Elinor Hall, retiring manager,
possible appointment of next fall's
Pre-Reg chairman, and Excom ap
proval of today's A.S.S.U. election
returns.
Students may contact Excom mem
bers for any business which they
wish to place before the committee
members, or attend in person.
