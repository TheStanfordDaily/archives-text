# Farm's Wandering Debaters Visit Schools in Midwest, East
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond in a series of letters written
to The Daily by Bob Newell and
Linn Moses, Stanford debaters
who are making a swing-around
tour of the country meeting (be
debating teams of eastern colleges
and universities,
April 11, 1941
This letter is to inform you that
Stanford's wandering debaters are
still wandering about in the East en
joying themselves most heartily.
As a matter of fact, since our
last letter we have covered a lot
of ground, having debated at the
Universities of Montana, Minnesota,
Michigan, Cornell and Colgate.
In all ol these schools, the one |
thing that impressed us the most
was the great respect which these
other institutions have for Stanford.
Not only had they a deep-seated i
respect for the athletic prowess of |
Stanford, but they regard it most
highly in all other respects. In fact,
we felt more like visiting potentates i
than humble debaters at all of
these schools.
LARGE UNIONS
Another fact that would deeply
impress any Stanford student is the
size of the student unions on all of
these campi.
At Minnesota, there is a new
$4,000,000 Coffman Memorial Union.
It is finished most elaborately. In
fact, it. actually parallels a Holly
wood version of a hotel for pluto
crats more,»than it does a hall for
students. Even the various student
offices are rigged up as if they
were the sanctorium of the rulers of
Wall Street—lush curtains, modern
istic furniture, and thick carpets,
furnishing the environment for im
portant 8.M.0.C.'5. Incidentally,
there are three ballrooms in the
building, a cafeteria, a student book
store, a post office, and a 16-alley
bowling alley entirely run by
students.
As a matter of fact, 400 students
have full-time jobs at this union.
IMPRESSIVE MUSEUM
The University of Minnesota also
has an impressive Museum of Nat-

Ural History (excuse out of ink). The
exhibits attain a three-dimensional
effect that is most real. It is done in
this way: the particular animal or
bird which is on display is placed in
a natural environment, and either a
natural color photograph or a paint
ing is used as a background. The
photograph or the painting, which
ever the case may be, is done in
such a way that the natural setting
blends into them perfectly. One
gets a perspective and setting that
is so real that it is a shock to realize
that he is actually in a building.
