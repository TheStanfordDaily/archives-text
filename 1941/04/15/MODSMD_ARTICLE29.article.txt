# Farm Loses League Lead As Troy Takes Card Nine in Doubleheader, 13-8,8-6
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford's league lead in the CTBA was short-lived, as Southern Cali
fornia grabbed both ends of yesterday's doubleheader, 13-K. and 8-(>. The
Trojans piled up IS hits in the first game and 15 in the nightcap.
A nervous Cardinal infield booted the ball around in the first inning
of the opener and set-up the southerners with a three-run lead. Stanford
scored two in their half of the ___

but from then on it was Troy all
the way. Sam Barry's club scored
at will, hitting in every inning ex
cept one, while the Indians got to
"Ace" Wilkins for eight safeties.
The Cards came to life in the sec
ond game, leading S.C., 0-5, at the
end of the fifth inning. Ray Ham
mett, Riiss Smith, Monte Pfyl, and
Ilal Costello each got two hits to
head the Indians offense. Southern
Cal stepped to the front again in
the next frame, 7-(5, and killed off a
belated ninth-ining rally after get
ting another run in their half of the
ninth.
Frank Koski, Trojan second base
man, played brilliantly at the key
stone spot, making several nice
pickups, and one sensational throw
to first while lying at full length
on the turf.
Stanford was "in the thick of it"
in the nightcap, but for every run
Ihey scored, the Trojans came back
with two more. Cootie Thompson
went the route in the first game, but
the top of the S.C. batting order
found him very much to its liking.
Five errors didn't help Thompson
either.
Cootie struck out five as did
Smith in the nightcap, but appar
ently the Barrymen had found the
batting eye they lost at Cal Satur
day. Stanford left a total of 14 men
stranded on the paths in both
games, while the Trojans let 26 die
on the bases.
Stanford's ninth-frame rally was
really tough to watch. Clark Gra
ham walked to start the inning, but
Boch Caruso flied out. Hal Costello
loped a Texas-leaguer behind first
base, but Graham couldn't tell
whether or not the ball would be
caught, so he started back to first.
Bill White, S.C. first baseman, fielded
ihe ball, whipped it to Koski at sec
ond, forcing Graham. Costello in the
meantime had rounded first and was
tagged sliding back.
Today the Card travel to Moraga
to meet St. Mary's in the last of its j
three-game series with the Gaels.
Phil Wolf will probably pitch against
the Phoenix.

but from then on it was Troy all
the way. Sam Barry's club scored
at will, hitting in every inning ex
cept one, while the Indians got to
"Ace" Wilkins for eight safeties.
The Cards came to life in the sec
ond game, leading S.C., 0-5, at the
end of the fifth inning. Ray Ham
mett, Riiss Smith, Monte Pfyl, and
Ilal Costello each got two hits to
head the Indians offense. Southern
Cal stepped to the front again in
the next frame, 7-(5, and killed off a
belated ninth-ining rally after get
ting another run in their half of the
ninth.
Frank Koski, Trojan second base
man, played brilliantly at the key
stone spot, making several nice
pickups, and one sensational throw
to first while lying at full length
on the turf.
Stanford was "in the thick of it"
in the nightcap, but for every run
Ihey scored, the Trojans came back
with two more. Cootie Thompson
went the route in the first game, but
the top of the S.C. batting order
found him very much to its liking.
Five errors didn't help Thompson
either.
Cootie struck out five as did
Smith in the nightcap, but appar
ently the Barrymen had found the
batting eye they lost at Cal Satur
day. Stanford left a total of 14 men
stranded on the paths in both
games, while the Trojans let 26 die
on the bases.
Stanford's ninth-frame rally was
really tough to watch. Clark Gra
ham walked to start the inning, but
Boch Caruso flied out. Hal Costello
loped a Texas-leaguer behind first
base, but Graham couldn't tell
whether or not the ball would be
caught, so he started back to first.
Bill White, S.C. first baseman, fielded
ihe ball, whipped it to Koski at sec
ond, forcing Graham. Costello in the
meantime had rounded first and was
tagged sliding back.
Today the Card travel to Moraga
to meet St. Mary's in the last of its j
three-game series with the Gaels.
Phil Wolf will probably pitch against
the Phoenix.
Stanford's league lead in the CTBA was short-lived, as Southern Cali
fornia grabbed both ends of yesterday's doubleheader, 13-K. and 8-(>. The
Trojans piled up IS hits in the first game and 15 in the nightcap.
