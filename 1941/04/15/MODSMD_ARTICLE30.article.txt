# Freshman Nine To Meet Broncos
## 
### 
The frosh baseball team goes to
work against Santa Clara High
School on the freshman field at 3:30
o'clock this afternoon.
Since the beginning of spring
football the frosh baseballers have
been handicapped by not knowing
whether the whole team will be out
on the field or not. Nevertheless,
(hey have managed to win the great
majority of their games and are
carving out a record which not many
Stanford teams, frosh or varsity, can
equal.
Probable pitcher for this after
noon's game will be Larry Wolf,
who turned in a sparkling perform
ance a week ago and should be
ready to go. Big Larry, however,
will have to pitch real ball to belter
the records of his two fellow hurl
ers, Bill Brubaker and Don Pender
grass, who pitched three- and four
hit games, respectively, last Friday
and Saturday.
