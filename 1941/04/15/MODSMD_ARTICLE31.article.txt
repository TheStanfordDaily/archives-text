# Chi Psi, Dekes Win Ball Games
## 
### 
Featuring a tight Chi Psi-Sequoia
pitching duel and a Deke-Breakers
slugfest, the 1941 intramural base
ball season got started yesterday.
The Chi Psi-Sequoia game ex
hibited baseball at its best. The
j contest was close all the way and
Sequoia with just a couple of
"breaks" might just as well have
won. The Chi Psi boys, however,
capitalized on extra-base wallops
and though Sequoia put plenty of
men on base, demonstrated a classy
j defense which finally gave the game
! to the Row men, 3-2,
The Deke-Breakers game was a
j hitting affair all the way. With the
score knotted at seven runs apiece
j going into the sixth inning the
Dekes finally blasted Breakers wide
open with a barrage of hits to count
five runs. The Dekes added two
I more runs in the seventh inning
| just for good measure, making the
final score 14-8.
El Cuadro forfeited to El Toro.
