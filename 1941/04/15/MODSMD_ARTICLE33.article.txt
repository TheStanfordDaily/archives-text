# Frosh Cindermen Face Big Season
## 
### 
With good track weather finally in
prospect, two and possibly three
| meets lie before the Stanford fresh
man cindermen in their already
shortened season.
A tilt with the San Mateo J. C.
tracksters, originally scheduled for
tomorrow, has been moved up to a
week from today. There is a possi
bility that a meet Saturday will be
scheduled with Visalia Junior Col
lege.
Winding up the frosh year will be
the annual Little Big Meet with the
California first-year men. Coach
Clyde Jeffrey is still in doubt as to
whether the meet will be run off
Friday, April 25, or Saturday, April
I 26.
