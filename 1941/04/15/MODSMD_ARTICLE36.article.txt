# Mitchell, Norberg, Koch Show Promise in Spring Workouts
## 
### 
Again facing the possibility of further weather complications. Coach
Clark Shaughnessy will run his Model "T" onto the practice field this
afternoon for another of the ."10 practice sessions allowed to each team by
ruling of the Pacific Coast Conference.
Friday afternoon's drill saw the entire squad divided into three smaller

units, with each group
through a series of plays in a dummy
scrimmage. The plays showed sev
eral new men as definite threats to '
make strong bids for first-string
spots.
CHANGES POSITION
Bob Mitchell, left halfback on the
1940 frosh team, and rated as both
a good runner and passer, worked
out at the quarterback position in
stead of the fullback spot as was
previously expected, and managed
to turn in some of the best work
done so far by any frosh. In his
first, field session, Mitchell showed
himself to have a lot of the faking
ability that is demanded of a quar
terback on the "T" formation.
Mitchell has had some experience
with the duties, having held down
the quarterback spot on the frosh
last year during the several times
that they used the system.
Hank Norberg, big, fast and ex
tremely brittle end candidate, show
ed to a good advantage in the pass
ing drills. Rated as one of the best I
prospects on the frosh team of two
years ago, this big sophomore has
been plagued by injuries ever since
he hit Stanford. He is not showing
the effects of any of his injuries at
this time, however, and should
make a strong bid for a starting j
position.
ANOTHER FROSH
Bob Koch, former all-City half
from Portland and a star on the frosh
last year, has shifted to the fullback i
spot left vacant by the graduation of I
Norm Standlee. Big, but not par
ticularly fast, Koch is nevertheless
a hard runner, as well as being an
excellent passer, and should see a
lot of action, while Ed McCain, who
somewhat failed to live up to ex- j
pectations last season, has shifted
from tackle to his old position at
guard.
With the returning veterans due to
report td practice Soon, and with
scrimmage ready to get under way
at that time, it still remains to be
seen how the frosh and transfers
will fit into the distinctive Shaugh
nessy system.

lot of action, while Ed McCain, who
somewhat failed to live up to ex- j
pectations last season, has shifted
from tackle to his old position at
guard.
With the returning veterans due to
report td practice Soon, and with
scrimmage ready to get under way
at that time, it still remains to be
seen how the frosh and transfers
will fit into the distinctive Shaugh
nessy system.
Again facing the possibility of further weather complications. Coach
Clark Shaughnessy will run his Model "T" onto the practice field this
afternoon for another of the ."10 practice sessions allowed to each team by
ruling of the Pacific Coast Conference.
Friday afternoon's drill saw the entire squad divided into three smaller

units, with each group
through a series of plays in a dummy
scrimmage. The plays showed sev
eral new men as definite threats to '
make strong bids for first-string
spots.
CHANGES POSITION
Bob Mitchell, left halfback on the
1940 frosh team, and rated as both
a good runner and passer, worked
out at the quarterback position in
stead of the fullback spot as was
previously expected, and managed
to turn in some of the best work
done so far by any frosh. In his
first, field session, Mitchell showed
himself to have a lot of the faking
ability that is demanded of a quar
terback on the "T" formation.
Mitchell has had some experience
with the duties, having held down
the quarterback spot on the frosh
last year during the several times
that they used the system.
Hank Norberg, big, fast and ex
tremely brittle end candidate, show
ed to a good advantage in the pass
ing drills. Rated as one of the best I
prospects on the frosh team of two
years ago, this big sophomore has
been plagued by injuries ever since
he hit Stanford. He is not showing
the effects of any of his injuries at
this time, however, and should
make a strong bid for a starting j
position.
ANOTHER FROSH
Bob Koch, former all-City half
from Portland and a star on the frosh
last year, has shifted to the fullback i
spot left vacant by the graduation of I
Norm Standlee. Big, but not par
ticularly fast, Koch is nevertheless
a hard runner, as well as being an
excellent passer, and should see a
lot of action, while Ed McCain, who
somewhat failed to live up to ex- j
pectations last season, has shifted
from tackle to his old position at
guard.
