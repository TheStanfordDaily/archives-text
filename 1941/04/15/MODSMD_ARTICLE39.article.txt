# Card Trackmen Show Promise Against 'Club'
## 
### 
Stanford showed surprising
strength in piling up GO points on
the Olympic Club Saturday. The In
dians now appear a fairly well-bal
anced club except for the shot and
the two-mile.
A1 Grey has not lived up to his
performances as a sophomore and
iunior, and has had trouble hitting
48 feet. Bob Millington, who can
put the shot farther from a standing
position than he can with the hop,
and Ed Stamm, a hard worker, have
possibilities, but neither will take
any firsts this year.
As for the two-mile, Aub Seed is
all alone with the Stanford banner.
Bill Bostwick has fractured his foot
and will be out indefinitely, so Aub
will have to handle Mclntyre, Weed,
and the others all by himself. His
marks indicate he can get down
around 4:45.
The Indians will more than hold
their own in the high jump and
broad jump. Jim Lincoln, getting
into shape rapidly, has cleared 6
feet, 4 inches and is headed for a
good year. Vern Hart, sophomore,
has developed steadily through the
early part of the season, jumping 6
feet, 1% inches in the Cal Relays,
6 feet, 3 inches against San Jose
State, and 6-4 against the Olympic
Club.
In the broad jump, both Chambers
and Peterson are well over 23 feet
and going strong.
The situation in the javelin is not
as discouraging as it may seem. Bob
Stone will undoubtedly get going.
His mark of 195 feet for the season
so far is not bad at all; and the
stocky blond should be out over 200
feet before the season is up. Ila I
Himovitz threw 189 last week, the
best performance of his career.

early part of the season, jumping 6
feet, 1% inches in the Cal Relays,
6 feet, 3 inches against San Jose
State, and 6-4 against the Olympic
Club.
In the broad jump, both Chambers
and Peterson are well over 23 feet
and going strong.
The situation in the javelin is not
as discouraging as it may seem. Bob
Stone will undoubtedly get going.
His mark of 195 feet for the season
so far is not bad at all; and the
stocky blond should be out over 200
feet before the season is up. Ila I
Himovitz threw 189 last week, the
best performance of his career.
