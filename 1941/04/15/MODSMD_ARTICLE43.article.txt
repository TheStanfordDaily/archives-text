# After the Armistice
## 
### 
IT seems a far cry from the stories of war and
destruction which keep insistently pounding
over the teletype from the battle fronts and
the diplomatic fronts of Europe to a rather ideal
istic thought of the implications of the word
"peace."
Maybe we shouldn't even use that word
"peace." It has so many implications. Rarely
has there been a peace following war which,
in the light of sober historical analysis, has not
laid the seeds for another war. And when we
hear the Nazi mouthpieces uttering honeyed
statements that Hitler's "ultimate object is peace
-—a permanent peace, based on justice and com
mon sense," the word seems to lose the ideal
istic implication it usually carries.
It may be because of military victory, or it
may be from sheer exhaustion, but sooner or
later it's a dead cinch that people are going to
have to quit fighting one another.
Call it peace if you will.
No matter what you call it when people stop
killing each other, there is going to have to be
some sort of settlement made at the end of this
war.
Many theories have been advanced for world
organization at the end of the present conflict.
Most of them take into consideration the prob
able part America will play in such a settle
ment.
A prominent San Francisco lawyer, John
Francis Neylan, however, has tried to promote
the thought that America should have abso
lutely no part in European settlement at the end
of this war.
He bases his plan on three premises:
1. Let us say in plain English: "This is not
our war and we are not going to romance
about jerking war-drunk Europe to salvation."
2. Let us make it plain to the English that
because of our abhorrence ol tyranny . . . and
the ideals shared . . . by the English people
and ourselves, we are willing and ready to
give the English every assistance possible.
3. Let us . . . tell them that after they have
paid what they can with liquid resources and
outposts in this hemisphere which are of no
service to them, the rest will be a gift so that
they will not be bad debtors ducking around
corners in the future.
If Mr. Neylan would take a long-range view
point in the matter he would see that we would
merely be adding fuel to the fire. After the war
there would be a treaty. This treaty would be
like all other treaties. And it would probably be
worse than the Versailles Treaty since it may
not have the sobering influence of American
support of the weaker powers.
It is granted that Wilson's voice at Versailles
was almost, but not quite, futile against the
greedy clamorings of great powers. And it is
also granted that had America gone into the
League of Nations we would today have a better
basis for forming some organization of interna
tional co-operation.
Today it is more generally realized that, from
the practical viewpoint, the world is much
smaller than it has ever been before and that
there must be some form of international co
operation to secure the future of democracy.
This form of government can safely co-exist only
with a pacific world order.
Mr. Neylan goes on:
"Old Mother England has had a rather active

part in the handling of European matters for over
four hundred years, and she has done a pretty
successful job."
Whether or not Mr. Neylan really feels that
this is true is beside the point; the point today
is that conditions are very different from what
they have been for the past four hundred years.
England can't do it alone and neither can any
other one country.—C. B.
