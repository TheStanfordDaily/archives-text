# Singfest Preferred
## 
### 
YESTERDAY morning the first undergraduate
organization turned up at the A.S.S.U. office,
was granted "exclusive right" to its song—and
officially started the ball rolling on the Farm's
first all-University singfest.
The ball has started rolling, and it'll gather a
lot of momentum between now and the May 7
scheduling of this newest event on the Farm
social calendar.
Already houses along the Row, clubs along
Encina commons, and the corridors of the wom
en's living groups are ringing with the first
manifestation of voices tuning up—after long
disuse.
Rally Committee, sponsor of the event, is
working manfully on the plans for the event.
And first drafts of the schedule promise a big
time for the evening will be had by all.
A singfest is something the Farm has been
needing for a long time. There are all too few
events in which the entire student body can
participate; just as there are too few attractions
to hold the Roughs and Farmerettes on the
campus over the week-end.
The singfest will satisfy both of these press
ing needs in fine shape.
It would make a truly top-notch yearly event
—a tradition in the finest sense. And it will
become a tradition, without a doubt, if this year's
trial goes over the hump of uncertainty which
always accompanies the first try at everything.
We can make it a tradition. Let's really go to
work on it.
