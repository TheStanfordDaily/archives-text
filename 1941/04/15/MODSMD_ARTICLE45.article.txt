LONDON BRIDGE
gRIDGE is a marvelous game. It is a game of in
telligence, perseverance, cool-headedness, tact.
Anyone who has enough sense to put cards of a
similar suit next to each other can play bridge. Work
ing on that assumption I sat down for a nice, friendly
little game the other day. I was playing with a friend
as a partnerâ€”the one with whom I have never lost
a match. On the other hand, we have never won a
match together, either. In fact, as I think it over,
neither of us had ever played bridge before.
I picked up my hand. There were three queens in
it. Inasmuch as I've been a student on the Farm for
almost four years now and have never even seen one
queen, I was overwhelmed with my sudden aflluence.
"Hello, honey," I said to the one on the far left,
and bent over and kissed her passionately over the left
eye. The only drawback is that in my haste I planted
one of my little fingers, which could hardly compare
with kissing a queen over the left eye.
"Three queens," I bid, suavely and confidently.
"Four accs," my partner said. I was determined to get
the bid. "Five queens," I cooed, kicking hell out of
his leg that was kicking hell out of my leg.

"W/F GOT it for that. "What suit are you playing this
in," asked our amazed opponents.
"Oh, I don't know," I said thoughtfully. "I guess
I'll play it in my brown suit. You know, the cute little
chintz with the purple polka dots."
My partner laid down his hand. "That looks like
a grand slam to me," one of our opponents said.
"Yes, it is grand, isn't it," I said, kicking my heels
in the air and pole-vaulting out the window.
"You'll have to finesse me out of my jack," said
one of the opponents. I didn't have any idea that we
had been playing for money.
The contest ended in a free-for-all when one of
our opponents screamed:
"I'll beat you with my last club."
No one can threaten me like that. I got my small
slam anyway, by the simple expedient of using my
famous airplane-spin wrestling hold. It would have
been a grand slam, but you know how it is when
padding in the shoulders of your sweater gets in the
way.
