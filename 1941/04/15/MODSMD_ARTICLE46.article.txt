## HERE WE GO AGAIN 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
In reply to yesterday's letter —Have you ever
stopped to think that perhaps the American people
arc foregetting the true meaning of free speech and
are losing to some degree the fond discernment that
characterizes the judgments of our country's founders
on questions of freedom? It is only to be expected,
since for many hundreds of years we have had little
contact with any force tending to whet the edge of
that judgment.
The founders and early settlers of our country
would have howled down Hitler from the house-tops,
yet, it is a farily safe bet that if Hitler asked for a
speaking tour of this country today and raised a cry
for free speech, that 50 per cent of our people, aside
from any question of natural curiosity, would affirm
his rights to speak. That same Hitler, who has lied,
and Lied, and LIED, and broken promise after prom
ise, and called on God in his speeches, and then perse
cuted His followers behind the scenes would be heard
and believed by millions and tremendous arguments
would arise as to whether he were lying again.
Do you see what I mean?
Then, do you see why it is so foolish to hear Sen
ator Nye, who proclaims at the top of his voice that
he is a great American? He has made hundreds of
speeches in Congress and in every one of them are
found the words which show that he does not even
understand our mighty ideal of Americanism which
can not tolerate injustices and which shows respect
for the people of all nations even as for its own.
Why should we listen more to the spell-binding
oratory of one who stands already self-condemned?
I reaffirm my approval of that act of our Admin
istration that demonstrates its ability to perceive true
freedom—not freedom bestowed haphazardly and with
out thought, but freedom administered by the duly
authorized representatives of the people with reason
and with regard for its own preservation.

contact with any force tending to whet the edge of
that judgment.
The founders and early settlers of our country
would have howled down Hitler from the house-tops,
yet, it is a farily safe bet that if Hitler asked for a
speaking tour of this country today and raised a cry
for free speech, that 50 per cent of our people, aside
from any question of natural curiosity, would affirm
his rights to speak. That same Hitler, who has lied,
and Lied, and LIED, and broken promise after prom
ise, and called on God in his speeches, and then perse
cuted His followers behind the scenes would be heard
and believed by millions and tremendous arguments
would arise as to whether he were lying again.
Do you see what I mean?
Then, do you see why it is so foolish to hear Sen
ator Nye, who proclaims at the top of his voice that
he is a great American? He has made hundreds of
speeches in Congress and in every one of them are
found the words which show that he does not even
understand our mighty ideal of Americanism which
can not tolerate injustices and which shows respect
for the people of all nations even as for its own.
Why should we listen more to the spell-binding
oratory of one who stands already self-condemned?
I reaffirm my approval of that act of our Admin
istration that demonstrates its ability to perceive true
freedom—not freedom bestowed haphazardly and with
out thought, but freedom administered by the duly
authorized representatives of the people with reason
and with regard for its own preservation.
