# Cartoons Overshadow Music in Color Fantasy
## 
### 
The visions of Walt Disney are now running in their ninth week at
the Geary in San Francisco. The visions are in color and arc very im
pressive with all those little horses and mushrooms and baby dinosaurs.
That new kind of sound is a great improvement. It's amazing how
natural the orchestra sounds. You can hear, distinctly, the violins coming

from one side and the cymbals in,
the back.
It is my humble opinion, however,
that it is practically an impossi
bility (blind men excluded) to watch
the cartoon and appreciate the beau
tiful music at the same time.
The engaging little mushrooms
and quaint little dinosaurs leave
Beethoven, Tschaikowski, and Mus
sorgsky running a losing second.
Mark Twain once said that the sense
of smell took precedence over the
other eight, but in the case of Fan
tasia the sense of sight certainly
excluded the hearing sense. In fact,
for two and a half hours it was a
battle of the senses to see whether
you would watch the mushrooms 01*
listen to the music.
It certainly is an interesting ex
periment, though, and a colorful one
too. Almost everyone likes it except
Dorothy Thompson, who claimed
that it was insidious Nazi propa
ganda. I think that's a little far
fetched.
Almost everyone admits that it's
a great panorama; I just happen to
be conservative enough to like sym
phony music by itself and cartoons
by themselves. Everyone around
The Daily, though, is just crazy
about it.â€”Mellinkoff
