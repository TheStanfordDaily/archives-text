## 
### 
BUDAPEST, April 14 (UP).â€”Bel
grade was a silent city of rubble
and death after waves of, German
dive-bombers savagely blasted it for
four days, Outerbridge Horsey,
United States vice-consul at Buda
pest, said today.
Many of the city's IjOOO dead still
lay in the streets. The power plant
lay in ruins, and there was no light
or water. Ambulances could not
operate in the crater-pocked streets,
the vice-consul said. Stupefied in
habitants did not venture from their
cellars for days.
The Jugoslav government divided
and left Belgrade for difTerent des
tinations, he said. British, Greek,
Belgian and Dutch officials went
with one group. The first secretary
of the American legation went with
another, while Lane and the majo
rity of his staff remained in the
capital.
