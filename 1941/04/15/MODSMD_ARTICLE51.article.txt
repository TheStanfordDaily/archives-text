# Street Repairs Scar Campus
## 
### 
Working with vengeance after the
weeks of rainy weather, workmen
early yesterday began to tear up
Lomita Drive and Santa Teresa
Street. Santa Teresa will be blocked
for only a few days until the drain
age ditch is completed.
The widening of Lomita Drive, a
major project, will close the road
for approximately a month. The
drive will be widened about 50 feet
from the Chemistry Building up to
the comer of Santa Teresa. Santa
Teresa will be widened about 30
feet.
The concrete division barrier be
tween Lomita Drive and the Quad
from the Geology Comer to the
Biology Corner will be torn out and
a slight grade of shrubs and grass
will be substituted.
When the new pavement on Lo
mita has been laid, Santa Teresa
will again be blocked off, this time
for paving. Farm students will have
to resign themselves to an extra few
minutes in getting over to Roble for
the next month or so.
Offices in the Administration
Building during the last week have
been getting a coat of fresh white
paint. This work will be completed
soon.
