# Flyers Practice For Bear Meet

### 
With the resumption of good
weather, the Stanford Flying Club
has been diligently practicing for the
approaching meet with the California
team.
Peter Waggenheim won the prac
tice meet last Saturday by averaging
R6 feet in three spot landings.
President Chuck Sharp, noting the
gradual improvements in the dis
tances, predicted that the club
should be whipped into shape for
California next meet for this Sat
urday for spot landings and bomb
dropping.
Both the practice Saturday and
the California meet Sunday will be
at 9 o'clock in the morning.
The club will have its regular
weekly meeting this Wednesday in
the clubroom at the Palo Alto Air
port. Besides the regular members,
all those interested in aviation are
invited to attend.
