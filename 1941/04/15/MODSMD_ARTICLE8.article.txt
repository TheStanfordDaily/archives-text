to discuss the collapse of continental
Europe's democracies.
Participants were informed of the
general topic last week in order to
allow time for research, but the
specific question will not be an
nounced until two hours before the
event.
Established 47 years ago by Baron
Pierre de Coubertin as a memorial
to Sadi Carnot, martyred president
of France, the award, a silver me
dallion, was changed in 1917 to
honor Field Marshall Joffre, French
war-time general.
GAUCIIERON PRESENTS
The medal will be presented to the
best individual speaker of the eve
ning by M. Roger Gaucheron, con
sul general of France, in behalf of
the Alliance Francaise of San Fran
cisco. Despite the recent political
occupation of France, the award is
still recognized by the French gov
ernment and is made in its name.
The medal itself was cast in the
French national mint.
The debate, although extempora
neous in effect, is a true battle of
wits, a test of skill in both debating
and organization of material as all
contestants are fully informed in
the general field for the question.
BRIEF HISTORY
Acting as chairman for the con
test, Prof. Georges Lemaitre of the
Romanic languages department will
first present M. Albert Bcrgerot,
who will give a brief history of the
debate.
Breaking a seven-year Stanford
winning streak, a Berkeley man won
the event in 1939. Last year, how
ever, Sherm Mellinkoff brought the
honor back to the Farm.
