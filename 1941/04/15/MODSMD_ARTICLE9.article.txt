## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, who re
cently returned from sevei'al east
ern conferences, told a Daily re
porter yesterday that he preferred
to remain unquoted on the current
American convoy controversy. Dr.
Wilbur believes that neither his
opinion nor the opinions of any
other typical citizen will have any
effect on government foreign policy
formation.
"We've reachcd a position in world
affairs where less than half a dozen
men are determining the future of
civilization by changes in our gov
ernments and legislation, such as
the Lend-Lease Act. Responsibility
where the world becomes a war
scene depends on Hitler, Stalin,
Roosevelt, and Churchill."
In regard to the advertisement for
convoying of the "Defend America
by Aiding the Allies Committee'
which appeared in Sunday's San
Francisco Chronicle with Dr. Wil
bur's name attached, he stated that
he had not attended the committee
meeting at which it voted on the
issue.
While in New York, Dr. Wilbur

Social Hygiene Association, of which
he is president. He also presided at
a conference of the American Coun
cil of the Institute of Pacific Rela
tions. In Chicago, Jie attended the
meeting of the World Citizens Asso
ciation, of which he is president.
