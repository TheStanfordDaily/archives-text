the British communiques
begin to call a situation "grave"
it's safe to assume that things are
verging on the desperate. Yester
day's events in Greece were "grave,"
but a faint glimmer of hope came
through in the Cairo communique.
The British are still holding at
Solium and their communications
with Tobruk have not yet been
broken. In Tobruk the besieged
forces counter-attacked, killed more
than 100 of the enemy, took 200
prisoners, and destroyed 15 Nazi
tanks. So long as General Wavell
feels there is no reason to evacuate
Tobruk, the men there will be a
definite threat to Nazi communica
tions, although they are about 80
miles behind the spearhead of the
Nazi drive.
Since Sunday the It.A.F. lias
been hammering at German and
Kalian air bases, troop concentra
tions, and motor transports in
Libya to stem "what has become a
definite threat to the Suez canal."
I'll say it has.
Reports on the Solium action are
obscure, but it seems that the Army
of (he Nile forces are still holding
part of the town. (It's probably just
a collection of mud huts around a
water hole.) General Wavell is
quoted as saying the situation has
"stabilized," whatever that means;
but it is not yet clear whether the
fighting at Solium is the definite
stand, or a rear-guard action de
signed to give the main body of
troops a chance to get set at Marsa
Matruh.

/ WER in Greece it would seem that
the B.E.F. and its Greek allies
arc getting it in the neck. Although
the British deny those persistent
Berlin reports of an evacuation of
the Empire forces from the Hellenic
peninsula, their reports agree with
the main claims of the Nazis.
The still in vincible German
troops are now some 50 or fiO miles
into northern Greece, after break
ing through the Monastir gap. At
present they are striking at the
towns of Kozani and Siaista. iJU
Kozani they are only about 40
miles from the eastern end of the
British-Greek lines near Mount
Olympus.
According to the C.B.S. corre
spondent in Ankara the Germans
are counting on taking all the Brit
ish forces hemmed in between the
Mount Olympus massif and the
Gulf of Salonika. If the British can't
fight their way out of this trap, the
only possible way they can escape is
by sea from the strategic port and
railway center of Larissa.

fpHE Italian-German capture of
Koritza in Albania has been con
firmed, and now this column is push
ing its way steadily downward to
meet the Nazi columns at Phlorina
and the Monastir pass. The Greek
retreat from Albania means that all
the sains made during the last
months are lost in that sector.
'Hie Greeks still maintain that
their lines across the peninsula,
except for the "strategic" aban
donment of Koritza and the Phlo
rina break-through, are holding
fast. They also deny the collapse
of Jugoslav resistance, and main
tain that fierce fighting is still go
ing on in the Kachnik gorge,
where the Serbian troops arc at
tempting to recapture the im
portant and unpronouncahlc
town of Skoplje. That particular
city has been reported taken and
lost so many times during the last
week that some circles are begin
ning to think it is only a mirage.
The long presaged appointment of
Harry Hopkins to the post of "Lend-
Lease Administrator" finally became
a fact last night in Washington.
Hopkins will supervise all arms pur
chases by countries in the "lend
lease area."
Since his return from England,
where he acted as President Roose
velt's personal "fact-finder," he has
been holding this post hi an unoffi
cial capacity. Thus his appointment
Wcis a mere formality.

Since Sunday the It.A.F. lias
been hammering at German and
Kalian air bases, troop concentra
tions, and motor transports in
Libya to stem "what has become a
definite threat to the Suez canal."
I'll say it has.
Reports on the Solium action are
obscure, but it seems that the Army
of (he Nile forces are still holding
part of the town. (It's probably just
a collection of mud huts around a
water hole.) General Wavell is
quoted as saying the situation has
"stabilized," whatever that means;
but it is not yet clear whether the
fighting at Solium is the definite
stand, or a rear-guard action de
signed to give the main body of
troops a chance to get set at Marsa
Matruh.

/ WER in Greece it would seem that
the B.E.F. and its Greek allies
arc getting it in the neck. Although
the British deny those persistent
Berlin reports of an evacuation of
the Empire forces from the Hellenic
peninsula, their reports agree with
the main claims of the Nazis.
The still in vincible German
troops are now some 50 or fiO miles
into northern Greece, after break
ing through the Monastir gap. At
present they are striking at the
towns of Kozani and Siaista. iJU
Kozani they are only about 40
miles from the eastern end of the
British-Greek lines near Mount
Olympus.
According to the C.B.S. corre
spondent in Ankara the Germans
are counting on taking all the Brit
ish forces hemmed in between the
Mount Olympus massif and the
Gulf of Salonika. If the British can't
fight their way out of this trap, the
only possible way they can escape is
by sea from the strategic port and
railway center of Larissa.

fpHE Italian-German capture of
Koritza in Albania has been con
firmed, and now this column is push

meet the Nazi columns at Phlorina
and the Monastir pass. The Greek
retreat from Albania means that all
the sains made during the last
months are lost in that sector.
'Hie Greeks still maintain that
their lines across the peninsula,

the British communiques
begin to call a situation "grave"
it's safe to assume that things are
verging on the desperate. Yester
day's events in Greece were "grave,"
but a faint glimmer of hope came
through in the Cairo communique.
The British are still holding at
Solium and their communications
with Tobruk have not yet been
broken. In Tobruk the besieged
forces counter-attacked, killed more
than 100 of the enemy, took 200
prisoners, and destroyed 15 Nazi
tanks. So long as General Wavell
feels there is no reason to evacuate
Tobruk, the men there will be a
definite threat to Nazi communica
tions, although they are about 80
miles behind the spearhead of the
Nazi drive.
