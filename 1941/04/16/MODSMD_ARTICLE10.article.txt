# Quad Editor Sets Publication Date
## 
### 
Editor Chuck Runacres has set
the probable publication dale of the
Quad as May 20 but, at the same
time, he is asking for co-operation
of one and all to make that date a
certainty.
All the heads of organizations and
other groups who have not turned
in their reports of their year's activi
ties are asked to do so this week to
Managing Editor Marian Smith. The
copy deadline is getting close and
many of these people have not re
sponded to the letters they have re
ceived.
