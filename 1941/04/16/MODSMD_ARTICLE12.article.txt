(Editor's Note: On United States Senate stationery, Bill Turner sent
his second letter from New York. He is one of the four delegates to
"Young America Wants to Help" in Washington. The letter was written
Easier Sunday.)

Bob Newell and I are now sitting in my room at the Pennsylvania Hotel.
It's Easter Sunday in New York, old man, and you ought to see the new
Easter bonnets. The New York men and women arc the best dressed that

yours truly has seen. You can imag-<
ine how hard it was to keep Newell
walking in a straight line on Fifth
Avenue as the Easter specimens
glided by.
Yesterday, I finally settled the
business that I had with the "Young
America Wants to Help" organiza
tion. Perhaps now would be a good
time to outline briefly what has
been accomplished in our meetings.
"Young America Wants to Help"
has already done much toward al
leviating the suffering in England,
especially among the women and
children. This group, which is
headed by Theodore Roosevelt's
daughter-in-law, Mrs. Kermit Roo
sevelt, is a subsidiary organization to
the officially sanctioned British War
Relief Society. Already these two
organizations have gained a repu
tation as the greatest contributor by
far to the needy, depleted English
families. Together they have raised
twice as much as all the other or
ganizations put together have. The
money raised goes toward sending
relief in the form of ambulances, old
clothes, rolling kitchens, diapers,
rescue boats for shot-down aviators,
materials for bomb shelters, and
lastly, of great importance, food
stuffs. "Young America Wants to
Help" particularly helps the women
and children.
LIKE RED CROSS
There arc two things I want to
emphasize about this organization to
aid the sufferers of Britain. First the
functions of the groups as I sec it, do
not lead us any closer toward bel
ligerent entanglements than we are
now already. It is merely a relief
organization, designed for humani
tarian purposes, to help those bombed
out of their homes in England. Its
work, as you can see, is like that of
the Red Cross except that its efforts
are directed toward one country.
Note especially that no war mate
rials are included in its donations to
the English.
The second point is that the fin
ancial accounting of "Young Amer
ica Wants to Help" shows clearly
the sincerity of purpose behind the
organization. I have had the ac
counting system laid before me and
explained; I have seen the ware
house of goods ready to go to the
suffering English people on early
shipment. My conclusion is that no
one is getting any "gravy" from
