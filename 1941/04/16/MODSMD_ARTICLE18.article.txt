# Excom Okays Proposed New Literary Mag
## Associates on Daily Granted Compensation After Lengthy Debate 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Ex Committee last night gave
painful birth to the sixth literary
magazine in Stanford's 50 years, in
one of the longest and best attended
meetings of the year.
First issue of the publication,
which received official okay after
lengthy debate, will appear on pro
bation this spring, and will be fol
lowed by four more trial issues next
year.
Driving a hard bargain, Excom
talked Clarence Burley and John
Tomlinson, proposers of the rebirth,
into underwriting the magazine for
$75. The committee granted $150
initial capital, and if returns on the
first issue fall below $75 the sup
porters will make up this amount
and return it to the A.S.S.U., and
the Stanford Literary Magazine will
automatically cease publication.
"I think you guys are buying a
lease on an 8-ball to agree to that,"
cracked Dwight Hutchinson, senior
man and newly-elected B.A.C. mem
ber.
Excom reserves the right to grant
continuance or quash the project
after the first issue.
Other business follows:
DAILY SALARIES: Five per cent
of The Daily profits up to $1000 will
be paid this year's two losing asso
ciate editors in the editorship races
as compensation for work done, and
thereafter a straight salary of $10 a
month will be paid each associate
editor, as approved by Excom after
over an hour's heated discussion.
This year's pay will come out of
The Daily improvement fund, and
hereafter will be deducted from
Daily business staff salaries, to be
determined by a committee com
posed of Stepp, Editor Wilson Can
non and Business Manager Frank
Bush.
The final action was a compro
mise between the proposal of Publi
cations Council, presented by Hutch
inson, and the oppositon of Stepp,
who told the committee he spent
20 hours' research to defeat the
proposition.
CONCERT SERIES: Helen Peter
son was appointed Concert Series
manager for 1941-42, upon the rec

Ex Committee last night gave
painful birth to the sixth literary
magazine in Stanford's 50 years, in
one of the longest and best attended
meetings of the year.
First issue of the publication,
which received official okay after
lengthy debate, will appear on pro
bation this spring, and will be fol
lowed by four more trial issues next
year.
Driving a hard bargain, Excom
talked Clarence Burley and John
Tomlinson, proposers of the rebirth,
into underwriting the magazine for
$75. The committee granted $150
initial capital, and if returns on the
first issue fall below $75 the sup
porters will make up this amount
and return it to the A.S.S.U., and
the Stanford Literary Magazine will
automatically cease publication.

ber.
Excom reserves the right to grant
continuance or quash the project
