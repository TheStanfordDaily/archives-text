# California Wins Joffre Debate
## Ralph Kramer Takes First in 47th Contest 
### HARRIET FISHER 
Honors for this year's Medaille
Joffre debate went to the University
of California last night as Ralph
Kramer of the Berkeley team took
first place in the 47th consecutive
contest in this oldest of American
college forensic rivalries.
Speaking on the negative side of
the question, "Resolved, that France
can evolve a form of democratic
government that will outlast totali
tarianism," Kramer based his argu
ment on the belief that democracy
cannot successfully compete with
totalitarian efficiency.
Kramer gave three reasons for
this belief. First, that democracy
relies on the individual to choose the
leaders of the state. Since most in
dividuals are insuffiicently educated,
he said, this only results in ineffi
ciency and chaos.
TOLERATE OPPOSITION
Second, democracy of itself must
tolerate opposition and the efficiency
of the state is hampered by those
not in accord with its policies. And
third, democracy has no magical
formula to unite the individual
states of Europe, separated as they
are by language and custom barriers.
A single political unit of Europe
would be necessary in order that
France could have democracy, said
Kramer, because democracy cannot
function in competition with effi
cient, well-integrated totalitarian
isms.
In rebuttal, Kramer stated, "Dem
ocracy has not the techniques nor
organization for European unity.
Until democracy has a solution for
the problems of contemporary Eu
rope, we shall not see it there
again."
CLEAN SWEEP
Making a clean sweep for Cali
fornia, Mary Griffin and Llewellyn
Evans of Berkeley took second and
third places, respectively.
Because of the return to France of
Consul-General Roger Gaucheron,
Vice-Consul-General de Nicolai
presented the silver medallion to the
winner in the name of the French
government and the Alliance Fran
caise of San Francisco.
Judges of the debate were John K.
Chapel, radio news commentator;
Dr. A. I. Nelden of the University of
California; Howard Pianter, attor
ney; John K. Langurn of the Uni
versity of California; and Cyril
Tobin, attorney.

can evolve a form of democratic
government that will outlast totali
tarianism," Kramer based his argu
ment on the belief that democracy
cannot successfully compete with
totalitarian efficiency.
Kramer gave three reasons for
this belief. First, that democracy
relies on the individual to choose the
leaders of the state. Since most in
dividuals are insuffiicently educated,
he said, this only results in ineffi
ciency and chaos.
TOLERATE OPPOSITION
Second, democracy of itself must
tolerate opposition and the efficiency
of the state is hampered by those
not in accord with its policies. And
third, democracy has no magical
formula to unite the individual
states of Europe, separated as they
are by language and custom barriers.
A single political unit of Europe
would be necessary in order that
France could have democracy, said
Kramer, because democracy cannot
function in competition with effi
cient, well-integrated totalitarian
isms.
In rebuttal, Kramer stated, "Dem
ocracy has not the techniques nor
organization for European unity.
Until democracy has a solution for
the problems of contemporary Eu
rope, we shall not see it there
again."
CLEAN SWEEP
Making a clean sweep for Cali
fornia, Mary Griffin and Llewellyn
Evans of Berkeley took second and
third places, respectively.
Because of the return to France of
Consul-General Roger Gaucheron,
Vice-Consul-General de Nicolai
presented the silver medallion to the
winner in the name of the French
government and the Alliance Fran
caise of San Francisco.
Judges of the debate were John K.
Chapel, radio news commentator;
Dr. A. I. Nelden of the University of
California; Howard Pianter, attor
ney; John K. Langurn of the Uni
versity of California; and Cyril
Tobin, attorney.
Honors for this year's Medaille
Joffre debate went to the University
of California last night as Ralph
Kramer of the Berkeley team took
first place in the 47th consecutive
contest in this oldest of American
college forensic rivalries.
Speaking on the negative side of
the question, "Resolved, that France
can evolve a form of democratic
government that will outlast totali
tarianism," Kramer based his argu
