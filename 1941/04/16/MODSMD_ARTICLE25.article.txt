# Stanfordites' Heavy Buying Rooms Palo Alto Business
## Daily Survey Shows Students Shun Stamp Collecting, Cafeteria Meals 
### VIC MINAHAN 
Stanford men buy moderately-priced, sporty clothes, smoke popular
brands of cigarettes, go to the movies, send flowers for heavy dates and
buy expensive shoes. They do not collect stamps, buy patent medicines
or eat in cafeterias.
Stanford women buy moderately-priced skirts and sweaters, lots of

silk stockings, go to the movies,
send candy at Valentine'.'; Day and
Mother's Day, and buy expensive
shoes. They do not buy hats, collect
stamps, or cat in cafeterias.
Such were the results of a survey
conducted yesterday by The Daily
among the business establishments
of Palo Alto, in an attempt to find
out what students like and do not
like, and how much Paly business
depends upon student trade.
An averaging up of the figures ob
tained shows that purchases made
by Farm students and faculty raise
the retail trade in the city 30 per
cent from August to September
tvery year. Over 200 Stanfordites
are regular customers during the
regular term.
Clothing establishments were the
most emphatic in their praises for
student trade, estimating that more
than 50 per cent of their yearly
business is from Stanford students.
In answer to a question of
whether the Farmites bought more
expensive clothing than the general
public, estimates differed. A shop
mat specializes in moderately-priced
clothing stated that student pur
chases were at the same price levels
as the general trade. Chain depart
ment stores specializing in cheap
garments, however, reported that
they received very little student
trade; and the higher-priced estab
lishments claimed that Stanfordites
like expensive wearing apparel.
In the realm of shoes—especially
women's—the survey showed that
Stanford students are definitely par
ticular. A shop selling only cheap
and moderately-pricod footwear re
ported that Stanford accounts for
only 3 per cent of its trade, while
the more expensive shops attributed
up to 40' per cent of their trade to
the students.
Drug stores reported that students
patronize their prescription depart
ments, but few patent medicines and
advertised pharmaceutic products.
Although declining to give any fig
ures, theater managers admitted that
Stanford students make up a large
portion of their nightly audiences.
"They aren't so hot for the mati
nees, though," they reported.
Bank figures show that clearings
in the August-September period
jump anywhere from one to two
million dollars. And the gasoline
companies also admit a great in
crease in trade during that time.
The business depending most on
student trade was the agency sell
ing theater, music and other "cul
ture" tickets for San Francisco the
aters. "Fantasia" has enjoyed a spe
cial amount of popularity among
the students, the figures show.

Bank figures show that clearings
in the August-September period
jump anywhere from one to two
million dollars. And the gasoline
companies also admit a great in
crease in trade during that time.
The business depending most on
student trade was the agency sell
ing theater, music and other "cul
ture" tickets for San Francisco the
aters. "Fantasia" has enjoyed a spe
cial amount of popularity among
the students, the figures show.
Stanford men buy moderately-priced, sporty clothes, smoke popular
brands of cigarettes, go to the movies, send flowers for heavy dates and
buy expensive shoes. They do not collect stamps, buy patent medicines
or eat in cafeterias.
Stanford women buy moderately-priced skirts and sweaters, lots of

silk stockings, go to the movies,
send candy at Valentine'.'; Day and
Mother's Day, and buy expensive
shoes. They do not buy hats, collect
stamps, or cat in cafeterias.
Such were the results of a survey
conducted yesterday by The Daily
among the business establishments
of Palo Alto, in an attempt to find
out what students like and do not
like, and how much Paly business
depends upon student trade.
An averaging up of the figures ob
tained shows that purchases made
by Farm students and faculty raise
the retail trade in the city 30 per
cent from August to September
tvery year. Over 200 Stanfordites
are regular customers during the
regular term.
Clothing establishments were the
most emphatic in their praises for
student trade, estimating that more
than 50 per cent of their yearly
business is from Stanford students.
In answer to a question of
whether the Farmites bought more
expensive clothing than the general
public, estimates differed. A shop
mat specializes in moderately-priced
clothing stated that student pur
chases were at the same price levels
as the general trade. Chain depart
ment stores specializing in cheap
garments, however, reported that
they received very little student
trade; and the higher-priced estab
lishments claimed that Stanfordites
like expensive wearing apparel.
In the realm of shoes—especially
women's—the survey showed that
Stanford students are definitely par
ticular. A shop selling only cheap
and moderately-pricod footwear re
ported that Stanford accounts for
only 3 per cent of its trade, while
the more expensive shops attributed
up to 40' per cent of their trade to
the students.
Drug stores reported that students
patronize their prescription depart
ments, but few patent medicines and
advertised pharmaceutic products.
Although declining to give any fig
ures, theater managers admitted that
Stanford students make up a large
portion of their nightly audiences.
"They aren't so hot for the mati
nees, though," they reported.
