# Scrambled Twins Provide Plot For farcical Shakespeare Play
## 
### 
"The Comedy of Errors" by William Shakespeare, a rollicking mix-up
of scrambled twins will be presented by the Speech and Drama Division
the nights of April 24, 25 and 20 in Memorial Theater.
The uproarious farce by the Bard of Avon was based on a comedy
by Plautus which told the story of two sets of twins separated when very

young and then meeting years
later.
Aegeon of Syracuse had twin sons,
born the same day as twins be
longing to the innkeeper of the lodge
where he was staying in Epidam
num. The low-born twins were
bought for slaves to Aegeon's sons.
When Aegeon and his wife were
returning to Syracuse, the ship was
wrecked and the twins (both sets)
were separated, as well as Aegeon
and his wife.
When the twin Antipholus (who
was with Aegeon) was 18 he went
in search of his brother, accompa
nied by his slave, Dromio. After
seven years passed with no news,
Aegeon went in search, too. He was
caught in Ephesus, where Syracus
ans were banned.
At that time, Antipholus of Syra
cuse arrived in Ephesus with Dro
mio, where, unknown to them, their
respective twins lived. There fol
lowed a series of embarrassing and
ridiculous mix-ups wherein the
twins are constantly mistaken for
one another, even to the confusion
of Antipholus of Ephesus' wife,
Adriana.
After a day of adventure, the
whole plot is revealed by the com
ing together of the two sets of twins,
the mother and the father, and ev
erything ends happily.
