SOMEWHERE IN JUGOSLAVIA, via Berne, April 15 (UP). —Jugoslav
troops recovering from the first reeling blows of the German blitzkrieg
have stormed and re-captured the important Vardar valley town of Sko
plje after smashing a Nazi column of 400 tanks and 1,000 trucks, according
to latest advices.
One week after the start of Germany's Balkan invasion with a terrible

bombing of the ancient city of Bel
grade, the situation appears to be
greatly improved, according to all
available information.
Three days of rain, snow and
cloudy weather vastly hampered the
operations of the German Luftwaffe
after the Nazi columns had thrust
down through Jugoslavia to beyond
Skoplje, vital railroad and highway
center 220 miles south of Belgrade
and about 70 miles from the Greek
border.
General Nediteh waited until the
German "panzer" column of 400
tanks and 1,000 trucks reached a
deep canyon of the Nerodimka River
just north of Skoplje.
Then he ordered the Jugoslav
counter-attack which met the Ger
mans near Kachanik Pass. The Ger
mans' gasoline supplies were de
stroyed and the "panzer" column was
isolated and cut to bits.
Swi;iVl|y the Jugoslavs stormed

they still hold, according to latest
