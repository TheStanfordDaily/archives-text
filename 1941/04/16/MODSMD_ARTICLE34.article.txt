(Editor's Note: This is the see- |
ond half of a letter written hy j
Linn Moses and Bob Newell, Stan
ford's wandering debaters, who !
are meeting debate teams from
Eastern universities in a swing- j
around tour of the country. Yes- !
terday's installment ended with a
description of the student union I
building at the University of IVlin- |
nesota.)
I
Michigan and Cornell too have
large and imposing student unions.
Cornell's is unique in that beer and
ale are served there. We had great
difficulty in being at ease under
these circumstances. In fact every
time an older person who looked
like a prof came .in the union, we
quit breathing and hid the evil stuff
under our coats until he left.
Finally, at our frenzied request,
our escorts pulled down the shades.
We then felt much more at home.
As far as our debates are concerned,
we have been debating the pros and
cons of our present foreign policy,
for the most part. The farther East
one gets the more pronounced is the
pro - interventionist sentiment. At
Cornell, for example, opponents of
the Lend-Lease bill are a definite
small minority. To our own dis
may, the students there seemed to
be somewhat resigned to our even
tual participation in the war.
All of our debates have been non
decision, except at Minnesota where
we won an audience decision. This
manner of debating does have the
advantage of producing a more ob
jective and sincere presentation of
ideas even if no nominal winner is
forthcoming. At Cornell, the stu
dent radio club broadcast the de
bate, and we found later that all
such events are broadcast to the
school as a whole.
