and Ray Hammett each collected
two in four attempts.
After nabbing one run on a hit
and a walk in the initial frame, the
Indians didn't score again until the
fourth. Ace Hanlon opened the inn
ing by flying out to right field, but
Cookie South drove a line drive
single to start the ball rolling. Elt
Boone followed with a one-bagger
and both men advanced as Wolf
grounded out, short to first.
'CHERRY' SCORES
Alec Cereghino drove a hit down
the first baseline, scoring Wolf and
South, and Pfyl popped up to end
the inning.
Only outhit, 11-8, Harry Wolter's
crew again couldn't bunch their
blows except in the fourth, when
ihey tallied two runs.
As far as the CIBA league picture
goes, Southern California and Cal
are tied for first place, and the
Cardinals' chances lie in a win over
Santa Clara today and the Bears
Saturday.
