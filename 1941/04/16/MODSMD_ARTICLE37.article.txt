# FROSH DIAMONDMEN DOWN SANTA CLARA
## 
### 
The frosh baseball team did it
again yesterday afternoon. They
whipped the Santa Clara High
School Panthers by an 11-1 score
and were under wraps most of the
way. ,
Don Pendergrass and Larry Wolf
of the freshmen shared the pitching
chores. Pendergrass pitched the
first four innings and allowed just
two hits, while Wolf hurled the
final three frames and was nicked
for five hits and a run.
FOURTH INNING GOOD
The frosh garnered all their runs
in the third, fourth, and fifth inn
ings. In the third singles by Brooks
and Nell, a walk to Reichling, and
Larry Wolf's fielder's choice totaled
three runs for the freshmen. The
fourth was the big inning for the
frosh. With the help of a single by
Larry Wolf, doubles by Johnny
Brooks and Don Pendergrass, a
walk to Dick Middleton, and a pair
of Santa Clara errors the Cardinal
youngsters shoved across five mark
ers. These were followed by three
more runs in the fifth inning, where
upon Coach Harry Shipkey put his
substitutes in the game and coasted
on his lead.
