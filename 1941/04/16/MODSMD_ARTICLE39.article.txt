# Card Splashers Point for 220 Record in Cal Meet Saturday
## 
### 
Feature and crucial race of the day in the Cal-Stanford swimming
meet to he held at 2:30 o'clock Saturday in Berkeley is the 220 yard free
style. Sophomore Doc Colyear will attempt to heat Cal's Bill Campbell.
This event should turn out to he another one of those great furlongs that
have occurred in every Big Meet in the past four years. A1 Frost of

Stanford and Ted McCarthy of
should also give a good race in the
same event.
The fancy diving will bring Stan
ford's Bill Niccolls and Bob Laverty
against Cal's Bill Barker and Covey.
This event will be a toss-up. Last i
year Barker and Niccolls broke I
even.
The 440-yard freestyle relay should
undoubtedly decide the meet. In
this event the two teams are very
evenly matched. Stanford will swim
Vitousek, Smith, Regnolds, and Col
year against Hill, McCarthy, Yee,
and Maclise of Cal.
Alternated with the varsity events
will be those of the respective fresh
man teams. Stanford is heavily fa
vored in the freshman meeting. '
