# GERMAN PANZEZRS BREAK ENGLISH LINE

### 
ATHENS, Wednesday, April 16
(UP). â€” German armored forces
smashed through the main Allied
line and swept nearly 50 miles down
across northern Greece in a great
arc aimed at entrapping the British
and Greek armies, it was stated offi
cially early today.
The German "panzer" forces were
said by the official Greek spokesman
to be striking at the towns of Ko
zani and Siatista and to have ad
vanced to the vital Siatista Pass
west of Kozani in the Vourinon
Mountains.
At Kozani, just north of the Vis
tritza River, the German spearhead
of tanks was only about 40 miles
from the eastern end of the Allied
line on the gulf of Salonika near
Mount Olympus.
(An Ankara radio broadcast heard
in London said that the Germans
had swept behind Mount Olympus
and entrapped British forces holding
the Allied flank between Mount
Olympus and the sea coast.)
