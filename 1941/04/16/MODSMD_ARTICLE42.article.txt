# New End Stars In Passing Drill
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity football team
held its third field practice during
the spring season yesterday, with
several returning veterans showing
up early to have the jump on their
teammates.
In the passing drills held at the
beginning of the practice sessions, it
was the passers that shone again,
but the receiving of Dean Gelwick,
sophomore transfer from San Luis
Obispo Junior College, was particu
larly outstanding. Bob Sheller, jun
ior transfer from Long Beach Jun
ior College. Bob Crane, and Jack
Barkely showed up well in the
pitching department.
The workout was marked by the
return of Bruno Banducci, Ed
Stamm, A1 Cole, Bill Mannon, and
several other members of Stanford's
Rose Bowl team.
Before the backs, ends, and line
men were put together in five dif
ferent teams for play drills, each
unit worked separately. Centers
worked with the backfield, while
the linemen went through vigorous
blocking and charging fundamentals.
After a half-hour's workout, each
of the five coaches took a full 11-
man squad and sent it through a
series of passing plays. A kicking
drill followed with quarterbacks
down the field on the receiving end.
