### CHUCK SMITH 
A GUY who has been around
Stanford for only one year, '
Marchie Schwartz, assistant varsity j
football coach, is pretty sold on the
Farm and everything that goes
with it.
Last week "Freshman" Schwartz
took several members of The Daily
sports staff out to luncheon to ex
plain and attempt to improve fu
ture relationships between The
Daily's scoop artists and the football
coaching staff.
What Marchie had to say about
Stanford made these sports writers
rather proud and optomistic about
the future of Stanford in general
and Stanford football in particular.
What he said is worth passing on
to as football conscious a student
body as Stanford's.
First, the Cards assistant coach is
firmly convinced that his boss, Head
Coach Clark Daniel Shaughnessy,
will, within the next few years, hold j
as big a position of influence in
American football as that held back
by the glorified Knute Rockne.
â™¦ * *
that never in his ex
k perience (and this includes four 1

years of football at Notre Dame, the
home of the famed Fighting Irish)
had Schwartz seen such team and
student body spirit as shown by the
1940 "Wow Boys" and their student
body.
Thirdly, that Stanford on the
whole was the most balanced col
lege athletically, socially, and
scholastically that Marchie has
ever been associated with either as
a coach or an undergraduate.
To get back to football which was
naturally the chief topic of conver
sation, Marchie said he felt, per
sonally, that Hugh Gallameau was
going to be a lot harder to replace
than anyone suspected. In fact,
Marchie felt that the "Duke" was
an All-American if there ever was
one from the very start of the
season.
When questioned on what sort of
variations the coaching staff planned
to use in the famed T-formation at
tack next year Schwartz rather
dumbfounded his small audience
with his answer. "We'll probably
use only 10 per cent new stuff at the
most.
