# Chet Dennis Wins Bowling Crown
## 
### 
Southpaw Chet Dennis' left hand
earned for him the title of "All-
Stanford Bowling Champ" Monday
afternoon as he bowled his way
through the All-University play-o(T
with a 579 scries to defeat Bill
Cooley's 491. Dennis had been de
clared the winner of the open title
I Saturday, but a recheek of scores
I revealed that Cooley had also rolled
! 534.
In Monday's play-off, Dennis con-
J sistently hit the 1-2 pocket for
I strikes and spares to amass his 579,
and Cooley was unable to cope with
such style. High point of the three
game match was Dennis' red-hot
second game of 220. In the handicap
division, Fordy Anderson edged out
! Bob Getz, 617-615, to take that title.
