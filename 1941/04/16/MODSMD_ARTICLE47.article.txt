# Pick of the Crop

SEVERAL times each year a little band of in
dustrious workers dust off their working
caps and see a lot of heavy action in a very
short time.
And when Election Board goes into action,
there's a lot more work behind the scenes than
the campus usually appreciates.
For the past week Election Board Chairman
Betty Moses and her group of aides have been
busy as beavers, what with nominations, decli
nations, assemblies, ballots and ballot boxes to
hex them.
Yesterday their co-operation and fine handling
of a tough job made possible The Daily's special
election edition which hit the Quad and the
living groups with the election information
shortly after the dinner hour.
And so we'd like to extend a word of appre
ciation and of approbation to a chairman and a
committee that this year have consistently come
through with flying colors.
Thanks from all of us.
