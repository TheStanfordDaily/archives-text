# The 						More, the . . .

IN what newspapers tritely term "unprece
dented numbers," Stanford yesterday turned
out to the polls and made that effort of checking
in a few significant squares on those little col
ored slips of paper.
This has been a hot campaign, with undoubt
edly the hottest finale that the Farm has seen
in many years. A confusing number of cau
cuses have been held, with the result that every
day of campaigning saw more and more can
didates tossing their rooters' caps into the ring.
And many students, refuting the official nega
tive nods of the caucuses, decided to run inde
pendently in the best Mrs. Pettybone style—
"come what may."
Figures are significant, and figures show that
in 1938 there were only 55 candidates running
in the spring election. This year saw 84 candi
dates and at least three write-ins in the final
tabulations.
A greater number of candidates means more
friends who will turn out to the polls to vote for
"good ol' Joe."
The Daily has long campaigned for larger and
still larger turnouts at the poll. This year, either
through journalistic prodding or for reasons un
known, Stanford students have accepted the
invitation. Unexpected things happened at the
polls yesterday.
But those things are the voice of the Stanford
students. More voters make for truer representa
tion. —B. A.
