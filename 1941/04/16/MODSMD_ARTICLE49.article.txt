ONE of Stanford's closest friends is celebrat
ing an anniversary today.
Today is "Aunt Lucie's" birthday.
Mrs. Lucie Stern has held a deep affection for
Stanford since she moved to the outskirts of
the Farm in the early 1930'5. She has many
times demonstrated this affection, and the Lucie
Stern Loan Fund and the Medical Research
Fund she created for Stanford medical students
are among the many of her gifts which will not
soon be forgotten.
Her "gift closet" has become almost a campus
legend, as has her steady interest in helping the
men and women of Stanford over many of their
difficulties.
And so Stanford men and women express
their appreciation and wish "Aunt Lucie" Stern
a very happy birthday.
