WASHINGTON, April 15 (UP).—
Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox
today told the House Naval Affairs
Committee national unity is essen
tial because "we are now in the
midst of the decisive period of this
present world war."
Knox testified at hearings on a
bill by Committee Chairman Carl
Vinson, D., Ga., which would provide
for compulsory mediation of labor
disputes in industries working on
naval orders. He favored the idea of
a compulsory "cooling of!" period
before strikes could be effected but
suggested the bill be "pruned up
a bit."
