# Business as Usual
## 
### 
FROM Washington one day comes a letter
telling you that your number is up. From the
local draft board comes an Army representative.
And off you go for a year of khaki and canteens.
But what is to happen to the job you left open
behind you? Obviously enough, some person
must fill your gap while you are away. And
just as obvious is the fact that such conditions
do much to destroy initiative on the part of
American youth. Why work too hard? Why
strive for promotion? Any day now you may
be drafted, and for all your effort you will only

have the dissatisfaction of knowing that some
little man with flat feet or thick-lensed glasses
will take over where you left off. And after your
year in the Army you will have to begin all
over again.
Isn't it better to save your efforts, just to wait
until you see whether qr not you will be drafted?
The government has foreseen this problem.
And they have taken action.
Yesterday Governor Olsen signed the Doyle
bill which provides that jobs of employees of
the state government entering military service
shall be kept open. As a protection for you,
this act also provides that jobs of workers in
private employment shall also be held open
"unless the employer's circumstances have so
changed as to make it impossible or unreason
able to do so."
There is your answer. Business as usual—
before and after you are drafted.—B. A.
