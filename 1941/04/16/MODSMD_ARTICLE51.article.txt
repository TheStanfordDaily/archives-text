### JERRY MAYER 
POLITICIAN'S LIFE
JVOW THAT elections are over, we can discuss the
subject freely.
I can hearken back to the days when I was a can
didate for offices in Stanford and in high school and
in grammar school and in kindergarten. I was one of
the smoothest politicians it has ever been my pleasure
to know. I'll never forget the cagey deal I pulled when
I was running for monitor in my natural history class
in grammar school.
It was one of the hottest elections that was ever
held at good old Carthay Circle. Here I was the inde
pendent candidate pitted against the teacher's pet. But
you have to be smart when you have your back to
the wall. Especially when the wall is covered with
chalk and its getting over your sweater. I moved away
from the wall and got my machine organized, in that
order.
First of all, I got the marble shooting clique lined
up behind me. I did this by the simple expedient of
trading stonies for bubble gum. I had trouble with
the women in the class, though. I borrowed my best
friends scooter and took them all for rides. But I
guess I didn't have the right approach because I have
it on good authority that very few of the women
voted for me. As a matter of fact, not very many of
the marble shooters voted for me. As I look back, I
was defeated 26-1 for the position.

JN HIGH SCHOOL I did much better. There were
ten positions open on the ruling board. There were
seven candidates. I was a sure thing, I figured. I
couldn't possibly lose. I would finally get myself
elected to something. I beat one of the four write-in
candidates for the tenth position by two votes. I
found out later that the one man I had beaten didn't
even exist. He was strictly fictitious. It was the hap
piest day of my life.
The time I ran for office at Stanford was another
big moment. I went to the caucus, which was won
derful. They read the list of democratically-appointed
hall candidates. Finally, when they got down to Men's
Council they discovered that one of their candidates
was ineligible.
A great scurry. "There must be some other eligible
candidate besides Mayer," everyone said. "No," I said,
"I'm the only one; you'll have to nominate me."
' Maybe we'd better not run anyone," everyone said.
But I had an ace up my sleeve. It was the ace of
hearts. I had used the ace of clubs to cop a big pot
in a poker game the night before.
"I'll shoot you guys craps to see if you nominate
me or not," I suggested. It was a cinch. My loaded
dice landed me right on the Council. Whenever a
traffic offender has argued with Council, we merely
bring out the dice and shoot him double or nothing.
One guy wanted to keep it up and we ran his $1
parking violation up to $36,000. Unfortunately, his
check bounced.

MEN' S COUNCIL has a couple of other tricks up
its sleeve. Especially when we are accused of be
ing rubber stamps for the Administration. We draw
ourselves up to our full height, so that we can see
over the table. We double our fists. "You'll be sorry,"
we always say. Then we stick out our tongues.
It never fails. Our accuser always backs down.
In that way we insure respect for our position. I'll
never forget the time that two freshmen had so much
respect for our position that they emulated itâ€”which
was strictly horizontal in the gutter.
We took the misguided kids in hand. We realized
that they were too young to know better. It was our
duty as Councilmcn to inform them of their misdeeds.
We would straighten them out, make them real Stan
ford students.
"Brothers," we told them, "find your own spot. It's
crowdcd down here."
