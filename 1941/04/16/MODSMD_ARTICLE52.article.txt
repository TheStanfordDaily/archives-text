# CAMPUS OPINION
## SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, JOHN 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
In presuming to answer Mr. Dirstine's letter in
The Daily of April 15, I should like to assert my
certainty that in the Stanford Community thei'e must
be many others who were as alarmed as I at the tone
of his letter, and remark that I only venture to use
the medium of Campus Opinion in answering him
because as another student in the Chemistry Depart
ment I do not wish his sentiments to be imputed to all
us in that department.
Mr. Dirstine may argue that the University's motto,
since it is of Germanic origin, is a dangerous ideal.
Nevertheless, the thought expressed in the phrase
"Der Luft der Freiheit weht" is perhaps the central
issue of the whole ideological struggle in the world
today. And among the freedoms, that of speech is,
after the freedom of thought itself, the most essential
factor in the support and preservation of those Ameri
can ideals which Mr. Dirstine himself has cited.
Although I am tempted to ask where in each of
the hundreds of Senator Nye's speeches in Congress
Mr. Dirstine has found words "which show that he
does not even understand our mighty ideal of Ameri
canism which can not tolerate injustices and which
shows respect for the people of all nations even as for
its own."
I should prefer to inquire whether he thinks we
should be allowed to listen impartially to all men,
Thomas Mann and Gerald Nye, Bertrand Russell and
Father Coughlin, Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler,
or whether we should hear only those of whom our
American counterparts of Herr Doktor Goebbels ap
prove, no matter with what lofty intentions?
Finally, if Mr. Dirstine believes that a speaking tour
by Hitler in this country could seduce 50 per cent of
the American people to the purposes of Naziism as he
seems to infer, then he has less faith in his fellow coun
trymen than have I. I commend to him the words of
Voltaire: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will
defend to the death your right to say it."
