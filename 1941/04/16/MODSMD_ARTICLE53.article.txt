# Baxter Movie Just A Good Tear-Jerker

### 
"ADAM HAD FOUR SONS," now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
Utilizing the novel "Legacy" by
Charles Bonner, Robert Sherwood
has half-heartedly assembled the
acting of Warner Baxter, Ingrid
Bergman, Fay Wray, and Susan
Hayward in "Adam Had Four Sons."
Good for a few tears from the fe
male members of the audience, the
picture tells of the trials of a war
time financier, played by Warner
Baxter, in raising four motherless
sons. The task is made more diffi
cult when the financier loses all in
the panic of 1908. He finds it im
possible to retain the governess,
played by Miss Bergman, to care
for the sons. The governess returns
to the story after the sons are fully
grown and are about to go to war.
She attempts* to straighten out the
numerous difficulties that the sons
find themselves in. Most notable of
these is the marriage of one of the
sons to a faithless girl just before
he leaves for France.
The picture reaches its climax in
a fight for supremacy in the family
between Miss Bergman and the
faithless wife who is well portrayed
by Susan Hayward.
The picture notably fails to make
the most of Miss Bergman's acting
ability. Miss Bergman, who was
widely acclaimed for her acting in
"Intermezzo," had no chance to ex
hibit her talents in the confining
role of the governess.
The double bill is saved by the
presence of a "B" picture, "Behind
the News," a Lloyd Nolan slug-fest,
that succeeds merely because it
makes no pretense of drama—just
good straight corn.—Mull
