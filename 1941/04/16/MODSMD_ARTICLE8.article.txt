# Soph Carnival To Open Drive
## Varied Concessions Planned for Friday 
### 
Wanta throw a tomato at a San
Francisco policeman? Wanta dance
with one of Stanford's "queens," for
only a dime? Wanta win a Model
"T" on a two-bit ticket?
These and other equally sensa
tional poportunities will be offered
to Stanfordites when the 1941 Soph
omore Carnival, opening event of
the Convalescent Home Drive, hits
the well-known boards in the En
cina Pavilion Friday evening.
Egg - throwing, roulette wheels,
kissing tests, old-fashioned melo
dramas and maybe a minstrel show
or two will be other features in the
Carnival, traditionally known as the
year's one event at which Stanford
ites really "let loose" and enjoy
themselves hilariously.

As usual, tickets good at all con
cessions will be on sale at the Pa
vilion door, and all profits will be
turned over to the Convalescent
Home. Late last night members of
Frank Bauman's publicity commit
tee were busy plastering stickers on
campus cars, their newest slogan
being "Convoy a Date to the Sopho
more Carnival."
In regard to a concession at which
students will be able to toss toma
toes at a San Francisco policeman,
Bauman hinted last night that this
had something to do with the cam
paign against "subversive elements"
conducted last week.
"They're still trying to sabotage
us," he remarked.
The Carnival will get under way
at 7 o'clock and oflicially end at
midnight.
