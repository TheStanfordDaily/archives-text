Know Your Bookstore
It was first planned to build the Bookstore of stone
but when it was found that this would prove too expen
sive, a bid was asked for and received constructing the
building of brick and plaster. By July 26, 1905, the Board
of Directors agreed that they would have to spend be
tween $10,000 to $12,000 for the proposed building and
it was on this basis that work proceeded. On March 8,
1906, we find the Board of Directors meeting in the
New Bookstore Building, which is the building now oc
cupied by that organization.
