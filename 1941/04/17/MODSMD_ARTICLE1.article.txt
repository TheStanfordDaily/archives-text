r PHOUGH the tremendous London
air-raid just about choked the
wires with flashes, bulletins, new
leads, eye-witness accounts, and
other graphically horrible verbiage,
the most significant news of the day
came out of the Mediterranean.
What happened during the British
naval attack on an Italian convoy is
important in itself; but what this at
tack and possible future attacks
mean to the desperate defense of the
Suez Canal is far more important.
There are about .'{o,ooo mechan
ized Nazi troops in Africa. (At
least, approximately that many
are engaged in the Drive Toward
Suez.) The major fighting is at
Solium and Tobruk, which is be
tween 800 and 1000 miles from
Tripoli. Tactically the "panzer"
divisions are superior to the
British forces, since they have
managed to drive the British
back from Benghasi in just about
half the time it took the British to
get there. And the Army of the
Nile mopped up the Italians in an
amazingly short time.

However, any army is dependent
upon supplies, and a mechanized
army must not only have the ordi
nary staples like food, ammunition,
and water, it must have gasoline,
and materials with which to repair
its intricate equipment.

W/HEN the British got out of
Benghasi, they probably blew
all garages and other accoutrements
necessary to tank repair sky high,
just as they will if they evacuate
Tobruk. The various whistle-stops
in the Libyan desert can offer no
more to General Rommel's army
than a few raw dates and some water
to cool off the engines.
The above mentioned facts arc
the reasons why the convoy attack
was important. According to lat
est reports the British troops
to the Egyptian border
from Ethiopia have not only held
the German attack, they've coun
ter-attacked at a town right on the
Egyptian border. So, if the navy
can keep further supplies from
gettng to Africa, and the army can
hold off the drive toward Alex
andria, the German forccs. despite
their mechanical superiority, will
be choked off.

The British bagged five merchant
men and three destroyers, losing one
destroyer in the engagement. This
seems to be a very small kill, but
then the force in Libya is compara
tively small. Two troop ships, a
vessel carrying ammunition, and
two others loaded with mechanized
equipment are worth getting in any
man's war.

JNCIDENTALLY, the boys in To
bruk are holding their own in fine
style so far. The first reports since
the siege started came from Jan
Yindrich of the United Press via
Cairo yesterday. He described the
attacks made by tanks, one of
which took place inside the perim
eter barbed wire strung around
the city, and the air raids which
have been taking place almost con
tinuously.
He then goes on to let some of the
soldiers describe the action. Most
of the accounts were bloody in the
extreme, but the report, of a young
Australian officer is particularly in
teresting.:

. . at our post we got a re
port that about 40 Germans were
inside the wire. I took six men in
order not to weaken the post too
much. . . . Our people behind were
blazing away over our heads. Then
we tore into them with bayonets.

. . . I got the shock of my life
because not one wanted to fight.
They had machine guns and auto
matics, but not one stood by his
gun . . .
"I must have killed about 12
Germans. My opinion of the Ger
mans now is that in hand-to
hand fighting they arc on a par
with the Italians. In a scrap
where it's every man for himself
they go to pieces, perhaps be
cause they're so well trained."

Yindrich, the reporter, is an
American and supposedly unbiased.
You can draw your conclusions.
