UNCLE SAM TAKES GREENLAND under his protection and extends United States naval and military
defenses to that strategic island. The map shows Greenland to be 7(10 miles away by air from Newfound
land and about 1,11*5 miles from New York City. It has a population of only about 17,000. Defense ex
perts have long urged the U. S. to occupy the island as a defense outpost in the Atlantic.
