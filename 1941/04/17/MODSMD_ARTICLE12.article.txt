Not strictly a literary magazine, the non-profit publication will include

articles of scientific, political
general interest, according to Bur- i
ley. Publication date of the first j

ALL WELCOME
"Those who are at present working
on the project urge that everyone
who would like to take part in any
way come to the meeting and help
to discuss the magazine's aims, prob
lems, and organization, whether his
interest lies in contributing articles
on any subject of popular concern
or in purely literary material, or in
working on the staff in the edi
torial, artistic, or business fields,"
said Burley.

Working staff of the magazine,
second issue of which will be on the
stands next October, will include
10 or 12 students, plus contributors.
Organizers of the publication with
Burley are John Tomlinson and
Johnny Lucas. A press run of 500

be sold at 25 cents a copy.
