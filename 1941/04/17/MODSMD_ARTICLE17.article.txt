LONDON, Thurs., April 17 (UP). â€”The German air force struck its
most intensive and destructive blow of the war at London during the
night, virtually all of the sprawling metropolitan area was subjected to a
bombardment lasting about eight hours.
At .'1 a.m. the assault upon London had been under way six hours.

>Its fury did not abate as the big
Nazi planes identified as dive-bomb
ers screeched down and unloaded
tons of explosives and incendiaries.
The capital was rocking under
terrific blows as the moon became
visible early this morning at the
peak of the raids.
Casualties were expected to be
very heavy, although detailed re
ports can not be gathered until after
dawn when rescue work will be ex
pedited.
Anti-aircraft shell fragments,
raining amid the high explosives and
incendiaries, increased the hazard
for the civilian defense personnel

who struggled through the raid to
carry on their jobs.
The Nazi bombers dived far be
low the balloon barrage and skim
med the rooftops, dumping their
cargoes despite terrific anti-aircraft
fire.
