# Vanderburgh Fatally Injured In Cycle Crash
## Farm Junior Dies As Machine Hurls Him Against Pole 
### 
Stan Vanderburgh, 20-year-old
junior student from Fresno, died of
a fractured skull shortly after 5
o'clock last night at the Palo Alto
hospital. The injury was sustained
when he lost control of his motor
cycle on Mayfield Avenue imme
diately past Lake Lagunita.

A Stanford Phi Gamma Delta,
Vanderburgh was also a member of
"Five Hits and a Dent" in this year's
Gaieties.

Leaving the golf course about 4,
a bag of golf clubs slung over his
shoulder, Vanderburgh apparently
lost control of his machine, plunging
over the shoulder to the right of the
highway and through heavy muck
and grass.

After traveling 200 feet off the
pavement, the front wheel of his
machine buckled, throwing him ten
feet clear and apparently directly
into a telephone pole.

It was not possible to ascertain
whether a defect in the steering gear
or interference from the bag of
clubs prevented him from nego
tiating the slight turn in the road.
There was no gravel on the high
way, and the wheel marks in the
grass indicated that the brakes had
not been applied.

Stan Miller, Kappa Alpha, who
was first at the scene of the acci
dent, notified both the hospital and
the police. Vanderburgh was taken
by ambulance to the hospital, where
he died an hour later.
