Stanford settled l ack into its seats yesterday, still jabbering over a
student body election that came in like a zephyr but went out like a
hurricane.

years, the '41 elections swept Hall's George Jackson into the A.S.S.U.

presdency by a huge unexpected
margin of over 500 votes. Tri Delt

dency with a 300-vote majority on
the second count.

tire election was the 2,200-vote tab
ulation, the largest turnout to the
polls that the student body has seen
in over nine years.
ROW COMFORTED
Alhough smothered in the presi
dential race, the Row found comfort
today in the fact that they smoothed
to victory in 14 out of 20 major posi
tions on the Tuesday ballot. Four
out of six Excom positions went to
candidates on Lasuen, and most
drastic landslide was a vote that sent
a Row man or woman' to every one
of seven class offices.
Men's and Women's Council posi
tions were split evenly. B.A.C. posi
tion went to the Hall candidate.
SLOW START
Campus politics began slowly this
year, with neither Hall or Row
caucuses bringing the student body
to any pitch of excitement. The
original Hall slate lasted through
election day, with the Row slate
mixed by many feverish last-min
ute candidates.
Only organized attempt of the
year to change slate selections came
from Encina, where frosh held two
caucuses designed to the choosing
of candidates from the freshman
class, by the frosh themselves.
