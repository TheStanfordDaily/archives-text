Helen Severance, Stanford senior,
spoke today to the Social Service
Group of the Y.W.C.A. on the sub
ject, "Food for the Small Democra
cies. and What We Can Do about It."
She presented the plan formulated
by Herbert Hoover and endorsed by
President Wilbur, E. E. Robinson,
Dean Jackson of the Business
School, and other prominent mem
bers of the faculty and staff.

Miss Severance pointed out that
since 37 million people in the five
small democracies of Europe are
facing starvation today, while the
United States has a surplus of food
stuffs, the need for action is evi
dent. The plan proposes sending
food to the small democracies in
special well-marked ships, which
will be guaranteed passage through
blockaded waters by the warring
nations.

The principal evidence of the
practicability of the plan is the fact
that it worked during the last war,
at which time it was also under the
leadership of Hoover. If carried
into effect the plan would be to the
advantage of all concerned, mainly
because more food prevents the ap
pearance and spread of disease.
