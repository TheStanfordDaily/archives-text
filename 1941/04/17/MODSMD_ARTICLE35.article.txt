# Frosh Netmen Face Cal Today
## 
### 
When frosh tennis coach Elwyn
Bugge calls the roll across the bay
at. Cal this afternoon, Emery Rogers,
No. 2 man on the squ;id which faces
the Bear yearlings today, will be
absent. The loss of Rogers, who
lractured his wrist at a skating party
last week-end, is a serious blow to
the hopes of the frosh netmen.
The undefeated Bear racqueteers
have been called "the best Cal year
ling squad ever" and have lived up
to this, winning all their matches I
by large margins. Tine Farm squad, j
on the other hand, unable to over- j
come the handicap rainy weather has I
dealt in forcing cancellation of a ma- i
jority of matches, has had only a '
fair season.
If the Card frosh are able to
overcome the loss of Rogers and the
lack of practice to outplay the Cal
racqueteers. the wrecking of the
Bears' undefeated season will rank j
as a major upset.
Lining up on the Stanford side of
the not will be Bruce Wylie, Don
Salisbury, Zook Sutton, Gordon
Kimball, Ross Hughes, and Frank
Tibbetts. Wylie and Salisbury will
team to form the No. 1 doubles
team, followed by Sutton and Kim
ball, and Hughes and Tibbetts. Top I
man on the huge Cal squad is Harry
Buttimer. Hippensteil, Foff, Smith.
St. Goar, Fair, Kendall, Kubey, and
Matthews will also swing racquets
for the Bears.
