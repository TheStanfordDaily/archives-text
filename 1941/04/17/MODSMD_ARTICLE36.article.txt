IT SURE is funny the way this In
dian nine plays baseball.
They're good all right, but anyone
| would have a tough time proving it
! this last week. Going into the
1 Southern California series with the
C.1.8.A. lead in their possession by
virtue of a win over U.C.L.A., the
Indians went all to pieces. They
dropped both ends of the double
header against the Trojans, then
blew their first game to Santa Clara
yesterday by a 4-1 score.
It just ain't right.
Monday v/asn't Stanford's day to
play ball, nor was it Captain Cootie
Thompson's day to pitch good ball.
When Thompson was a sophomore,
he set the league on fire with his
tremendous flinging, and, outside of
the Cal games last season, he set
! the opposition down with amazingly
lew hits as a junior. But U.S.C. cer
tainly made a "cousin" of him in the
j first game Monday.

From the looks of things of late,
Claude Purkitt, the made-over
catcher, is about the best pitcher on
the Indian nine. In the second Bruin
game he handcufTed the Bruins with
only five hits, and up until the sev
enth canto Monday he had those
same Bruins well under control.

PJUSS SMITH got credit for the
win because he relieved "Purk"
when the score was tied, but when
he went out Purkitt had only given
up two clean bingles.

The way that Stanford outhit the
Broncs yesterday and still were far
behind in the run column reminds
one of the last season when that
was the case in almost every game.
And the Redshirts couldn't win for
losing. The Indian hits were as well
scattered as the other team could
ever want to see them: they were
spread over nine innings with one
each canto except the second.

Every inning at least one Stanford
player reached first base, and usu
ally it was more than one, for Gene
McFadden, the Bronc hurler, issued
five walks and a couple of Red
shirts got on the bags through
Bronco errors. But four double
plays by the heads-up Santa Clara
infield squelched as many scoring
chances. In other words, Stanford
just didn't hit in the clutches, and
eight Cards were left stranded on
base during the game.

All in all, however, Coach Harry
Wolter's charges are working much
more smoothly than last season, both
in the field and at the plate. And
despite their slump in the last three
games, the Indians still have a
mathematical chance for the C.1.8.A.
pennant, slim though it is.

Stanford still has two Santa Clara
games and three Cal games on its
schedule. One of the Cal games is
scheduled for this Saturday, but it's
just possible, though not probable,
that Coaches Wolter and Evans
will agree to make it a double
header in order to facilitate the task
of getting this schedule cleared up.

Providing the Indians can cop the
rest of their games, very far from
an easy task, yet one not entirely
impossible, and providing St. Mary's
and U.S.C. knock each other off in
their two games in the Southland,
Stanford can still come out on top
in the league for the first time in
years.
It's a slight hope, but it's cer
tainly -one to work on.

the Cal games last season, he set
! the opposition down with amazingly
lew hits as a junior. But U.S.C. cer
tainly made a "cousin" of him in the
j first game Monday.

From the looks of things of late,
Claude Purkitt, the made-over
catcher, is about the best pitcher on
the Indian nine. In the second Bruin
game he handcufTed the Bruins with
only five hits, and up until the sev
enth canto Monday he had those
same Bruins well under control.

PJUSS SMITH got credit for the
win because he relieved "Purk"
when the score was tied, but when
he went out Purkitt had only given
up two clean bingles.

The way that Stanford outhit the
Broncs yesterday and still were far
behind in the run column reminds
one of the last season when that
was the case in almost every game.
And the Redshirts couldn't win for
losing. The Indian hits were as well
scattered as the other team could
ever want to see them: they were
spread over nine innings with one
each canto except the second.

Every inning at least one Stanford
player reached first base, and usu
ally it was more than one, for Gene
McFadden, the Bronc hurler, issued
five walks and a couple of Red
shirts got on the bags through
Bronco errors. But four double
plays by the heads-up Santa Clara
infield squelched as many scoring
chances. In other words, Stanford
just didn't hit in the clutches, and
eight Cards were left stranded on
base during the game.

All in all, however, Coach Harry
Wolter's charges are working much
more smoothly than last season, both
in the field and at the plate. And
despite their slump in the last three
games, the Indians still have a
mathematical chance for the C.1.8.A.
pennant, slim though it is.

Stanford still has two Santa Clara
games and three Cal games on its
schedule. One of the Cal games is
scheduled for this Saturday, but it's
just possible, though not probable,
that Coaches Wolter and Evans
will agree to make it a double
header in order to facilitate the task
of getting this schedule cleared up.

Providing the Indians can cop the
rest of their games, very far from
an easy task, yet one not entirely
impossible, and providing St. Mary's
and U.S.C. knock each other off in
their two games in the Southland,
Stanford can still come out on top
in the league for the first time in
years.
It's a slight hope, but it's cer
tainly -one to work on.
IT SURE is funny the way this In
dian nine plays baseball.
They're good all right, but anyone
| would have a tough time proving it
! this last week. Going into the
1 Southern California series with the
C.1.8.A. lead in their possession by
virtue of a win over U.C.L.A., the
Indians went all to pieces. They
dropped both ends of the double
header against the Trojans, then
blew their first game to Santa Clara
yesterday by a 4-1 score.
It just ain't right.
