# Colorful Props Enhance 'Comedy'
## 
### 
Although there is only one set for
the full three acts of "The Comedy

| of Errors," which will be presented
April 24, 25, and 26 in Memorial
i Hall, Charles Vance, director of the
i play, has crammed all the color and

gayety representative of the farce
into that one scene.

The whole comedy will be pre
sented in a street scene which is a
stylized version of the old Roman
streets. Pink and purple, blue and
green combine harmoniously for a
lively effect. A fountain will spout
from a gargoyle's mouth in the rear.
As an added feature the play is be
ing scored with music throughout.

Tickets for the play may be ob
tained by calling Mr. Barker at the
box office, or by calling P.A. 22041.
