# Card Trackmen Travel South
## 
### 
Stanford travels south this week
end to take on the U.C.L.A. track
team in a dual meet which shapes
up as one of the closest contests of
the season.
The Bruins have key men in im
portant events and will certainly not
give Stanford the meet on a silver
platter as they have done in the past.
Rogey Hoeger has shoved the shot
out over 51 feet and won't have any
trouble in that event. Another tower
of Bruin strength is Hal Sinclair,
colored dash man, just about tops
in the conference.

But local track stock is booming
and there are even wild guesses that
the Indians will give U.S.C. trouble.
Marks of the Cal-Trojan meet Mon
day were excellent but both teams
disappointed Ihe fans in certain de
partments.

Stanford's new developments are
coming along fast. Russ Peck, a
transfer, is a threat in the pole vault
and should do at least 13-6 this sea
son. Don McFarland will do well in
the 440. Vic Chambers and Thor
Peterson are jumping ahead of Jur
kovich of Cal.

MODESTO. April 16 (UP).—Pres
ident William J. Silva of the Mo
desto Trap Club announced today

Washington, Oregon, Nevada. Idaho
j and California will compete in the
! 30th annual California state trap-
I shoot here, May 8-11.
