field J.C., 71 to 60. last week.

Two of the top Papoose runners,
Don Rciss and Bob Waters, may
meet their nemesis in the person of

sticks is 25 seconds fiat, not quite
fast enough to shade the Visalia

frosh sprinter, can make Browning
run wide open in the 220. the lack
of time to recover should slow him
down over the hurdles.
