# Card Paddlers Hit by Illness

### 
When Stanford's varsity swim
j mers tackle the University of Cali
j fornia at Berkeley Saturday they
, will begin the meet seriously handi
i capped. For Co-captain Roy Vitou
sek, Indian sprinter and key man of
; the relay team, is in the hospital
with a high temperature. Added to
; this sad news is the fact that Doc
! Colyear, ace distance man, is in the
Rest Home with a cold.
Colyear may be able to practice by
Friday, but it is extremely doubtful
if Vitousek will be out in time for
the meet. This new blow hits the
swimming team right between the
eyes.
If neither of these men are able to
participate, the responsibility of the
i afternoon will fall squarely on the
| shoulders of Don Smith, Bob Reg
! nolds, Co-captain B;ll Weeden, Bill
j Niccolls, Bob Young, and a number
;of others. They will have a tough
j battle but may be able to turn the
f trick.

The meet will begin at 2:30 o'clock
Saturday afternoon at Berkeley. The
frosh Cal-Stanford meet will alter
nate their events with the varsity.
