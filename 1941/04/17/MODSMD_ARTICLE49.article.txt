# The
						New Baby

EVEN though it will be getting on toward the
end of the quarter and all possible drives
for money will have practically cleaned out the
collective pocket of most Stanfordites, stick a
two-bit piece down in the bottom of your dresser
drawer right now.
Because about May 28 when Stanford s new
baby in the publications field crawls out of the
galleys on to the campus news stands, you'll
probably want to check the contents.
And that original interest or curiosity is go
ing to decide whether the young arrival will
really get up on its own two feet and make a
permanent niche for itself in Stanford's reading
budget.

The contents will be different from any of
Stanford's five former ill-fated literary maga
zines. The backers assert it will contain articles
by students, professors and experts on present
day problems, stories, and poetry.
And the finances. Excom granted Sl5O which
will just cover the cost of the first issue. And if
the enterprise nets less than 575 from sales and
advertising, it will immediately become de
funct, and the backers will scrape together the
difference between receipts and $75 so that
they will be able to pay back the A.S.S.U. one
half its original investment.

But if it reaches up its hand, catches the upper
rail of its creeping pen, and nets enough to
cover costs for the second issue ($9O), it will
appear again soon after the opening of fall
quarter. And it will print two more trial issues
during fall quarter, providing its resources
never drop below the $75 level.

Then after the fourth issue, Publications Coun
cil will go into a huddle over the infant, diag
nose its good and bad features, and determine
whether it shall live.

The A.S.S.U. is risking a maximum of $75 to
let the stockholders in its organization decide
whether they feel—as expressed by their pur
chases of the magazine—there is room for this
new publication.—C. B.
