# Gallup on the Nose
## 
### 
ON page 1 of today's Daily is a small article
of great import.
This is the story outlining the results of a
recent poll conducted by George Gallup, di
rector of the American Institute of Public Opin
ion.
The results of this poll of national opinion
show that Americans are whole - heartedly
against taking any college student out of school
to serve in the army before he has finished his
education—whether he has one semester or
two years to go.
In answer to the question of whether students
should be allowed to finish their courses before
induction, 69 per cent answered in the affirma
tive.
When the same sampling of the people was
asked if deferment until completion of courses
of study should be given to students in the fields
of engineering and medicine, the answer was
even more vehement—B7 per cent opposed to
induction before completion.
This figure can be relied upon to represent
a true picture of what the composite American
citizen thinks about this question. George Gal
lup, by means of personal interviews with a
weighted, or so-called "stratified," sample of
the population, was able to predict in every
state, and for the nation as a whole, the outcome
of the last presidential election within the rela
tively negligible 2Vi per cent of error.
If his scientific method works on one question,
it cannot then be far off on this latest poll.
Quite a different viewpoint is being taken by
the general public on the matter of completion
of college education than was taken by Lewis
B Hershey, Deputy Director of the Selective

Service System, a few weeks ago when he said
he would go so far as to recommend a discon
tinuance of the group deferment for college
students, exempting them until July 1, 1941.
The authorities can now see what the public
actually thinks.
They were indefinite on the position of college
students after July 1, 1941, in the original bill
because they felt the general public would
object to seeming favoritism toward students.
They felt the layman would claim a favored
class was receiving exemptions because one
must have money to be in college.
This point is now completely disproved by
this recent Gallup poll.
The necessary step, now that the mind of the
public has so conclusively been shown, is a
concerted effort on the part of both colleges and
the general populace to impress the high offi
cials of the draft system with their point: both
college men and the army will benefit from
deferment until education has been completed.

of great import.
This is the story outlining the results of a
recent poll conducted by George Gallup, di
rector of the American Institute of Public Opin
ion.
The results of this poll of national opinion
show that Americans are whole - heartedly
against taking any college student out of school
to serve in the army before he has finished his
education—whether he has one semester or
two years to go.
In answer to the question of whether students
should be allowed to finish their courses before
induction, 69 per cent answered in the affirma
tive.
When the same sampling of the people was
asked if deferment until completion of courses
of study should be given to students in the fields
of engineering and medicine, the answer was
even more vehement—B7 per cent opposed to
induction before completion.
This figure can be relied upon to represent
a true picture of what the composite American
citizen thinks about this question. George Gal
lup, by means of personal interviews with a
weighted, or so-called "stratified," sample of
the population, was able to predict in every
state, and for the nation as a whole, the outcome
of the last presidential election within the rela
tively negligible 2Vi per cent of error.
If his scientific method works on one question,
it cannot then be far off on this latest poll.
Quite a different viewpoint is being taken by
the general public on the matter of completion
of college education than was taken by Lewis
B Hershey, Deputy Director of the Selective

Service System, a few weeks ago when he said
he would go so far as to recommend a discon
tinuance of the group deferment for college
students, exempting them until July 1, 1941.
The authorities can now see what the public
actually thinks.
They were indefinite on the position of college
students after July 1, 1941, in the original bill
because they felt the general public would
object to seeming favoritism toward students.
They felt the layman would claim a favored
class was receiving exemptions because one
must have money to be in college.
This point is now completely disproved by
this recent Gallup poll.
The necessary step, now that the mind of the
public has so conclusively been shown, is a
concerted effort on the part of both colleges and
the general populace to impress the high offi
cials of the draft system with their point: both
college men and the army will benefit from
deferment until education has been completed.
