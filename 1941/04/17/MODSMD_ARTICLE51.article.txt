# BULL SESSION
## IF WISHES WERE KISSES . . . 
### JERRY MAYER 
gULL SESSION took in a movie the other night. It
was a fine picture, called "The Son of Monte
Cristo." It might just have well been called "Kiss Me
Again," or "Slip Me a Kiss, Honey, Before I Die."
Only of course he didn't die. At one time, the son of
Monte Cristo was fighting about a million guys with
his saber, and what do you know? He came out of it
alive! Which was regrettable. If he could have died
early in the picture, they could have made it into a
short-subject. Then everyone could have gotten home
early.
But the progress of the picture did recall some of
my childhood experiences. For instance, when the sol
diers of that nasty old General Gurko (not to be con
fused with Jerko) were beating down all the doors
leading into the son's room. What did the kid do?
No, you're wrong. He didn't jump out the window.
He didn't fight his way out. He kissed his girl, ten
derly, passionately—and often. Now we don't be
grudge a good man a few kisses. But it seems to me
that the least he could do is control his emotions. If
I'd written the scenario he would never have kissed
that girl. I would have kissed her.

B U T. that guy was never satisfied. It was disgusting
after a while. Alexandre Dumas would have
turned in his grave if he had seen this picture. He
would have been a veritable whirlwind in his grave.
Not that old Dumas was a hypocrite or anything. No,
not at all. But, after all, it's just too much to see the
son of your favorite character spend all his life kissing
a girl—even if that girl is Joan Bennett.
All of which reminds me of my great escapade.
When I was in junior high school my girl friend and
I went down to the amusement pier because I wanted
to spend some money on her, because she was such a
wonderful thing, because I like to take my friends to
the places they enjoy the most, and because she had
a pass to all the concessions.
We were wending our way through the Tunnel of
Curves, when an idea suddenly possessed me. I would
kiss her. There was no reason why we should have
been going steady for four months without my once
kissing her. I reached out and encircled her in my
arms. Complications began right there.

JJECAUSE her cheek that was so soft and lily-like
suddenly had developed a growth of beard. Her
voice, so low and melodious, had a harsh note.

"What the hell is coming off here," said this raucous
voice, which I determined in the due time of seven
tenths of a second did not belong to the girl of my
dreams. My departure, to say the least, was rapid. I
ran right through the walls of the Tunnel of Curves
and didn't stop until I was located safely in the Pen
dulum. I'm the only person in history who ever rode
the Pendulum for three straight hours.

THAT experience was running through my mind
k as I viewed the son of Monte Cristo kissing Joan
Bennett every other minute for an hour. But then
the son was, according to the picture, the richest man
in the world, and maybe those kind of guys can get
away with that sort of stuff. Maybe if John Steinbeck
had written the scenario, though, things would have
been different. It would have been much more satis
factory to see an Okie kissing Joan Bennett . But when
you come right down to it, me kissing Joan Bennett
would have been the best picture in the world. It
would have shown theater-goers that anything is
possible.
Of course, I can't use a saber, but then neither does
the son know ihe girl who has a pass to all the con
cessions on the pier. As a matter of fact, neither do
I now. She married the guy who operated the Pen
dulum.

the places they enjoy the most, and because she had
a pass to all the concessions.
We were wending our way through the Tunnel of
Curves, when an idea suddenly possessed me. I would
kiss her. There was no reason why we should have
been going steady for four months without my once
kissing her. I reached out and encircled her in my
arms. Complications began right there.

JJECAUSE her cheek that was so soft and lily-like
suddenly had developed a growth of beard. Her
voice, so low and melodious, had a harsh note.

"What the hell is coming off here," said this raucous
voice, which I determined in the due time of seven
tenths of a second did not belong to the girl of my
dreams. My departure, to say the least, was rapid. I
ran right through the walls of the Tunnel of Curves
and didn't stop until I was located safely in the Pen
dulum. I'm the only person in history who ever rode
the Pendulum for three straight hours.

THAT experience was running through my mind
k as I viewed the son of Monte Cristo kissing Joan
Bennett every other minute for an hour. But then
the son was, according to the picture, the richest man
in the world, and maybe those kind of guys can get
away with that sort of stuff. Maybe if John Steinbeck
had written the scenario, though, things would have
been different. It would have been much more satis
factory to see an Okie kissing Joan Bennett . But when
you come right down to it, me kissing Joan Bennett
would have been the best picture in the world. It
would have shown theater-goers that anything is
possible.
Of course, I can't use a saber, but then neither does
the son know ihe girl who has a pass to all the con
cessions on the pier. As a matter of fact, neither do
I now. She married the guy who operated the Pen
dulum.
gULL SESSION took in a movie the other night. It
was a fine picture, called "The Son of Monte
Cristo." It might just have well been called "Kiss Me
Again," or "Slip Me a Kiss, Honey, Before I Die."
Only of course he didn't die. At one time, the son of
Monte Cristo was fighting about a million guys with
his saber, and what do you know? He came out of it
alive! Which was regrettable. If he could have died
early in the picture, they could have made it into a
short-subject. Then everyone could have gotten home
early.
But the progress of the picture did recall some of
my childhood experiences. For instance, when the sol
diers of that nasty old General Gurko (not to be con
fused with Jerko) were beating down all the doors
leading into the son's room. What did the kid do?
No, you're wrong. He didn't jump out the window.
He didn't fight his way out. He kissed his girl, ten
derly, passionately—and often. Now we don't be
grudge a good man a few kisses. But it seems to me
that the least he could do is control his emotions. If
I'd written the scenario he would never have kissed
that girl. I would have kissed her.

B U T. that guy was never satisfied. It was disgusting
after a while. Alexandre Dumas would have
turned in his grave if he had seen this picture. He
would have been a veritable whirlwind in his grave.
Not that old Dumas was a hypocrite or anything. No,
not at all. But, after all, it's just too much to see the
son of your favorite character spend all his life kissing
a girl—even if that girl is Joan Bennett.
All of which reminds me of my great escapade.

Cristo." It might just have well been called "Kiss Me
Again," or "Slip Me a Kiss, Honey, Before I Die."
Only of course he didn't die. At one time, the son of
Monte Cristo was fighting about a million guys with
his saber, and what do you know? He came out of it
alive! Which was regrettable. If he could have died
early in the picture, they could have made it into a
short-subject. Then everyone could have gotten home
early.
But the progress of the picture did recall some of
my childhood experiences. For instance, when the sol
diers of that nasty old General Gurko (not to be con
fused with Jerko) were beating down all the doors
leading into the son's room. What did the kid do?
No, you're wrong. He didn't jump out the window.
He didn't fight his way out. He kissed his girl, ten
derly, passionately—and often. Now we don't be
grudge a good man a few kisses. But it seems to me
that the least he could do is control his emotions. If
I'd written the scenario he would never have kissed
that girl. I would have kissed her.

B U T. that guy was never satisfied. It was disgusting
after a while. Alexandre Dumas would have
turned in his grave if he had seen this picture. He
would have been a veritable whirlwind in his grave.
Not that old Dumas was a hypocrite or anything. No,
not at all. But, after all, it's just too much to see the
son of your favorite character spend all his life kissing
a girl—even if that girl is Joan Bennett.
All of which reminds me of my great escapade.
When I was in junior high school my girl friend and
I went down to the amusement pier because I wanted
to spend some money on her, because she was such a
wonderful thing, because I like to take my friends to
the places they enjoy the most, and because she had
a pass to all the concessions.
We were wending our way through the Tunnel of
Curves, when an idea suddenly possessed me. I would
kiss her. There was no reason why we should have
been going steady for four months without my once
kissing her. I reached out and encircled her in my
arms. Complications began right there.

JJECAUSE her cheek that was so soft and lily-like
suddenly had developed a growth of beard. Her
voice, so low and melodious, had a harsh note.

"What the hell is coming off here," said this raucous
voice, which I determined in the due time of seven
tenths of a second did not belong to the girl of my
dreams. My departure, to say the least, was rapid. I
ran right through the walls of the Tunnel of Curves
and didn't stop until I was located safely in the Pen
dulum. I'm the only person in history who ever rode
the Pendulum for three straight hours.

THAT experience was running through my mind
k as I viewed the son of Monte Cristo kissing Joan
Bennett every other minute for an hour. But then
the son was, according to the picture, the richest man
in the world, and maybe those kind of guys can get
away with that sort of stuff. Maybe if John Steinbeck
had written the scenario, though, things would have
been different. It would have been much more satis
factory to see an Okie kissing Joan Bennett . But when
you come right down to it, me kissing Joan Bennett
would have been the best picture in the world. It
would have shown theater-goers that anything is
possible.
Of course, I can't use a saber, but then neither does
the son know ihe girl who has a pass to all the con
cessions on the pier. As a matter of fact, neither do
I now. She married the guy who operated the Pen
dulum.
