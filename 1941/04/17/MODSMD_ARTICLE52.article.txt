r | I HE EDITOR, SIR:
It's high time Stanfordites investigated the sub
ject of morality on the Farm, as we feel the Stanford
Theater is to be questioned on its prudence in selecting
current attractions.
Over the week-end the Stanford exhibited "The
Lady Eve." Now, conceive of this: Tuesday morning
this same theater announces in its Daily ad that
"Adam Had Four Sons."
Is this a coincidence, or are we naive?
