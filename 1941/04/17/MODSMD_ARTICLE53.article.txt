HPHE EDITOR. SIR:
After observing the manner in which the ballot
ing and the vote counting was conducted by the Elec
tion Board in this last election, we have several sug
gestions to make. A more careful check should be
made as to who votes, since under the present system
one person with a number of student-body cards can
vote a number of times. In order to avoid this and to
allow the Election Board to more carefully supervise
the number of ballots taken by each individual, we
suggest that the polling booths should be more ade
quately staffed, especially between classes.
Regarding counting the ballots, we do not think
it is fair to any of the candidates to begin counting
ballots before all of the polls have closed. In case
counting is begun before the polls have closed, re
sults should not be allowed to leak out from the
tabulating room; for. interested parties, finding them
selves behind by a few votes, can easily succeed in a
last-minute drive to put their candidate into office.
Lastly, we feel that the election board should have
more equal representation from Hall and Row, so as
to avoid the unconscious "mistakes" and misunder
standings in counting ballots.
