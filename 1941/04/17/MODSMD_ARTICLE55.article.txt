# Mary Boland's Flighty Role Pleases S.F.
## 
### 
"MEET TIIE WIFE," starring
Mary Boland, now at the Curran.
On display in the city for two
weeks, this amiable little piece is
designed to convince audiences that
Mary Boland is their best form of
entertainment. For Miss Boland's
return to the stage is one of the
pleasanter events in San Francisco's
so-called theatrical season.
Her present vehicle is the usual
happy fax - ce concocted to provide
the star with one of her typical
flighty matron roles. The fact that
the play is dccidedly flyweight, and
quite devoid of novelty does not in
any way detract from the fun—with
Mary Boland in the leading role
amusement is guaranteed.
BOLANI) AT HOME
"Meet the Wife" is a natural for
the Boland talent. It's all about a
gushingly charming New England
dowager with a whim of iron, who
suddenly finds herself with two
husbands on her hands.
In this case, there's an added
twist to the bigamy—both of the
husbands find their mutual wife's
charming domination a bit weari
some. But the little woman, under a
coy manner, hides a tigerish deter
mination to hang onto at least one
husband.
Although the play is Miss Boland's
all the way through, the supporting
cast is admirable in a handful of
stock roles. Outstanding is King
Kennedy as a dainty young artist
with asthma and flat feet. He gives
his part a butterfly touch that is
genuinely funny without being
nauseating.
JAMES' SISTER
Vernon Steele, as the husband who
got away, gives an easy and ingra
tiating performance; while John
Roche, as the husband still in the
clutches, is suitable, exasperated in
an apoplectic sort of way. Jean
Cagney gives a strained perform
ance, in trying to emotionalize a
rather flat ingenue role.
The play isn't new—it's obvious
and improbable, but it has a gaiety
and brightness that make it most be
guiling in this day of sociological
drama.
Just to see Mary Boland regally
allowing a young man zip her into
an exceedingly fitting gown makes
the whole evening worth while.—

husbands on her hands.
In this case, there's an added
twist to the bigamy—both of the
husbands find their mutual wife's
charming domination a bit weari
some. But the little woman, under a
coy manner, hides a tigerish deter
mination to hang onto at least one
husband.
Although the play is Miss Boland's
all the way through, the supporting
cast is admirable in a handful of
stock roles. Outstanding is King
Kennedy as a dainty young artist
with asthma and flat feet. He gives
his part a butterfly touch that is
genuinely funny without being
nauseating.
JAMES' SISTER
Vernon Steele, as the husband who
got away, gives an easy and ingra
tiating performance; while John
Roche, as the husband still in the
clutches, is suitable, exasperated in
an apoplectic sort of way. Jean
Cagney gives a strained perform
ance, in trying to emotionalize a
rather flat ingenue role.
The play isn't new—it's obvious
and improbable, but it has a gaiety
and brightness that make it most be
guiling in this day of sociological
drama.
Just to see Mary Boland regally
allowing a young man zip her into
an exceedingly fitting gown makes
the whole evening worth while.—

"MEET TIIE WIFE," starring
Mary Boland, now at the Curran.
On display in the city for two
weeks, this amiable little piece is
designed to convince audiences that
Mary Boland is their best form of
entertainment. For Miss Boland's
return to the stage is one of the
pleasanter events in San Francisco's
so-called theatrical season.
Her present vehicle is the usual
happy fax - ce concocted to provide
the star with one of her typical
flighty matron roles. The fact that
the play is dccidedly flyweight, and
quite devoid of novelty does not in
any way detract from the fun—with
Mary Boland in the leading role
amusement is guaranteed.
BOLANI) AT HOME
"Meet the Wife" is a natural for
the Boland talent. It's all about a
gushingly charming New England
dowager with a whim of iron, who
suddenly finds herself with two
husbands on her hands.
