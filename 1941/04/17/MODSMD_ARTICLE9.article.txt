# Thomas Bailey Predicts Need For Convoys
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Unless the British can find some
way of combating German surface
raiders, submarines and aircraft, t'f;
United States will be forced to use
convoys as a last resort, Dr. Thomas
Bailey of the history department
predicted yesterday.
"With the coming of longer days
and increased use of German sub
marines against British shipping,
sinkings of American war materials
bound for England will become a
vital issue to the United States," Dr.
Bailey said.
On the score of naval bases, Eng
land's chances in successful subma
rine warfare are much less in this
war than in the last war, according
to Dr. Bailey.
LACKS BASES
"Germany has bases in Norway
and France from which she can send
out surface raiders. But England
must fight back without the Irish
bases that she had in the last war,"
Dr. Bailey said. "The best destroy
ers have small fuel capacities, so a
scarcity of bases is a real disad
vantage."
Although he thinks convoys will
be an inevitable part of effective
American aid to Britain, Dr. Bailey
says that convoys definitely mean
war.
"When we start convoying, the
Germans start shooting and that is
war," Dr. Bailey said. "But it is bet
ter for us to convoy than to give our
own ships to the British navy.
NAVAL WAR
Dr. Bailey also thinks that a war
started over convoy sinkings could
be limited to a naval sphere of
combat.

"Hitler can't invade us, nor can
he do much damage to our navy
with all his surface raiders, bomb
ers, and submarines. The United
States Navy can stop sinkings."

The present Administration has
held out against tying its hands on
the convoy issue, because it can't
foresee the future, according to Dr.
Bailey.

Germans start shooting and that is
war," Dr. Bailey said. "But it is bet
ter for us to convoy than to give our
own ships to the British navy.
NAVAL WAR
Dr. Bailey also thinks that a war
started over convoy sinkings could
be limited to a naval sphere of
combat.

"Hitler can't invade us, nor can
he do much damage to our navy
with all his surface raiders, bomb
ers, and submarines. The United
States Navy can stop sinkings."

The present Administration has
held out against tying its hands on
the convoy issue, because it can't
foresee the future, according to Dr.
Bailey.
