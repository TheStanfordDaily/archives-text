IT IS evident that the British Ex
peditionary force in Greece is
fighting a losing battle—that Hitler's
orders have been to get them out
fast, no matter what the cost. And
according to the eye-witness ac
counts the slaughter is something
terrific.
The Battle of Greece is no route.
British lines are giving before
wave on wave of the German attack
ers, but the retreat is going on in
good order and there have been no
vital break-throughs.
From the manner in which Hit
ler is fighting this war, it appears
that he has the time element in
his mind. Even though he has
over one million men stationed in
the Balkans, he surely would not
sacrifice men and equipment un
necessarily on a fight he knows
he can eventually win unless there
were some reason for it.
The Englishmen in Greece are
comparatively few in number and
are being used principally to brace
up the Greek lines. No one denied
that the Greeks are fierce fighters,
but heart is no good when you are
outnumbered ten to one, and your
equipment is poor. So probably the
Nazis could conquer Greece at half
the price if they chose to take their
time.

IT IS possible that the British
High Command did not expect
Greece to be taken so soon, but they
must have regarded a victory there
as an unexpected blessing. At any
rate, they know now that Greece is
going to fall. And all their tactics
are designed to delay the day they
must get out of Greece just as long
as possible.
Suppose, for the safe of argu
ment, that Greece is cleaned up l>y
the middle of May. At best there
will be only four and a half more
months of good fighting weather
left this year. Getting the British
off the continent is a German ne
cessity, but there's a lot left to be
done. Hitler, with all Europe on
his hands boiling with oppressed
people and certainly feeling the
exigencies of a blockade, is not
going to have an easy time.
The African campaign must be
sucecssful and he should take
Gibraltar in order to get the Medi
terranean clear. And then there is
that small, but very annoying
island which will never give him a
free moment as long as it is free.

HPHE convoy attack yesterday dem
onstrated to him that he's go
ing to have an awful time taking
Suez with Cunningham's fleet on
the loose, and his only means of
getting at that fleet is with air
planes, now that the Italian fleet is
so nearly out of commission.
The reason for all the rush is the
United States. Watch the hysterical
outbursts against "war-monger"
Rosevelt in the German and Italian
press, if you don't think the Fuehrer
is alive to the danger we constitute.
Here again the time enters in.
If ever a nation was barreling
down the road to war, it's us.
Every event of the last weeks
(Greenland, the ship seizures,
opening the Ited Sea) each in it
self has given Hitler pretext
enough to declare war on us. And
we are not casing up.
However, we're not ready for a
war just yet. If he can win quickly
and decisively we won't have time to
act. But if he gives us another win
ter, the tremendous industrial and
man power we can muster will
create quite a problem.
Maybe the United States cannot
muster this tremendous effort, but
the Axis press lashings we're get
ting would lead to the assumption
that Hitler, at least, thinks we can.

terrific.
The Battle of Greece is no route.
British lines are giving before
wave on wave of the German attack
ers, but the retreat is going on in
good order and there have been no
vital break-throughs.
From the manner in which Hit
ler is fighting this war, it appears
that he has the time element in
his mind. Even though he has
over one million men stationed in
the Balkans, he surely would not
sacrifice men and equipment un
necessarily on a fight he knows
he can eventually win unless there
were some reason for it.
The Englishmen in Greece are
comparatively few in number and
are being used principally to brace
up the Greek lines. No one denied
that the Greeks are fierce fighters,
but heart is no good when you are
outnumbered ten to one, and your
equipment is poor. So probably the
Nazis could conquer Greece at half
the price if they chose to take their
time.

IT IS possible that the British
High Command did not expect
Greece to be taken so soon, but they
must have regarded a victory there
as an unexpected blessing. At any
rate, they know now that Greece is
going to fall. And all their tactics
are designed to delay the day they
must get out of Greece just as long
as possible.
Suppose, for the safe of argu
ment, that Greece is cleaned up l>y
the middle of May. At best there
will be only four and a half more
months of good fighting weather
left this year. Getting the British
off the continent is a German ne
cessity, but there's a lot left to be
done. Hitler, with all Europe on
his hands boiling with oppressed
people and certainly feeling the
exigencies of a blockade, is not
going to have an easy time.
The African campaign must be
sucecssful and he should take
Gibraltar in order to get the Medi
terranean clear. And then there is
that small, but very annoying
island which will never give him a
free moment as long as it is free.
