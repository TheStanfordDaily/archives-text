# Pro Arte Will Give Concert
## Program to Feature Goossens' Quartet 
### 
The third of a series of five con
certs will be presented by the Pro
Arte Quartet in the Memorial Hall
Auditorium Sunday afternoon at
3:30.
The program will consist of the
Quartet in C Major, Opus 59, No. 3,
by Beethoven; the Quartet No. 2,
Opus 59, by Eugene Goossens; and
the Quartet in A Minor, Opus 29, by
Franz Schubert.
Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidgc,
who is coming up from Southern
California for the concert, commis
sioned Mr. Goossens' quartet last
year. It was written while Mr.'Goos
sens was worried about members of
his family who were in Europe dur
ing the German blitzkrieg on France.
The quartet is written, to quote
the composer, in a "virtually sonata
form." The third movement is writ
ten in 5/4 time, which is very un
usual, and it is quite bitter. The
quartet in general is unusual in that
it is very English in atmosphere, to
the extent that the second movement
is an English folk song, "Searching
for Lambs," even though Mr. Goos
sens is of Belgian birth and has lived
in this country for many years.
The Beethoven quartet is one of
the Rossamosky quartets and is typi
cal of his middle period.
The members of the Pro Arte
quartet are Antonio Brosa, first vio
lin; Laurent Halleux, second violin;
Germain Prevost, viola; and War
wick Evans, violonchellist.
