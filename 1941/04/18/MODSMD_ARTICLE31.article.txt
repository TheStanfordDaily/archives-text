# Peace Group To Call Strike
## 
### 
On April 23, at 11 a.m. "a million
students at 400 colleges" have been
summoned by the Youth Committee
Against War of the Kepp America
Out of War Congress to leave their
classes on strike. This organization,
with which are affiliated such or
ganizations as the Young Peoples
Socialist League and the National
Council of Methodist Youth, claims
to be working with Senators Nye
and Wheeler and Norman Thomas
to "demonstrate their opposition to
involvement in war." To quote,
"Youth must strike now or never!...
It can't be heard from No Man's
Land."
This strike has also been called
by the American Student Union and
the American Youth Congress, both
recently attacked as Communist
groups. To the anti-war plea, they
add one for "all out defense of
democracy in education," including
"more NY A for more students." In
any case, a strike, "with mass meet
ings, parades, and demonstrations,"
has been called by all these or
ganizations.
In previous years, Stanford has
celebrated this day as Peace Day,
a University assembly and
other public exercises. Following
the outbreak of the present war, a
World Affairs Committee replaced
the Peace Day Committee, but this
committee has ceased to function and
there are no pians for observance
this year. A.S.S.U. President Bruce
Jessup, explained that the Thomas
Mann assembly of last month was
the only event of this kind sched
uled. No official support of the
strike movement is expected at
Stanford.
