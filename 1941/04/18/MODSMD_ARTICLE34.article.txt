With a curious collection of road
scrapers, huge tractors that look
like dinosaurs, Lomita Drive is rap
idly beginning to appear like a
page out of "Fantasia."
With continued good weather, I
Contractors Piazzo and Huntley, of
San Jose, are hoping to get the
paving through as soon as possible.
The grading on the side will be fin
ished soon, and then the present
pavement will be taken up. Provi
sions for diagonal parking along
the tree-lined barrier after the pav
ing has been completed have been
made. Since Lomita Drive is being
moved CO feet over there will be
ample parking space.
The paving is to be done from the
Chemistry Building as far up as the
corner of Santa Teresa, which means !
that there will actually be parking !
space enough for the fleet of Daily j
cars in front of the Daily shack. |
