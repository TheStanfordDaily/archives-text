## CHUCK SMITH, Sports Editor Koll Hurls for California In Tomorrow's CIBA Tilt 
### 
With only Hie barest chance of copping the CIIIA race —they must win
every game from here in—Stanford tackles California tomorrow at
o'clock on Sunken Diamond in the firsl of the season's Big Game tilts.
Mound foes will he Mike Koll for the Bears, who set the Indians down
three straight last season, and Cootie Thompson for the Cards, pitching
against his favorite enemies. *

California, St. Mary's, and the
Trojans are deadlocked for the
league lead, and Stanford has live
games yet to play, three with Cal,
including tomorrow's and two with
Santa Clara.
Last Saturday at Berkeley, Koll
stymied S.C., letting down the Tro
jans with five scattered blows as the
Bears won, 2-1. The big southpaw
flinger has been a jinx to the Indians
for two years, and of late left
handers have pretty much had their
way against the locals. Cal mustered
elyht hits oil' Troy's ace flinger, Ed
Vitalieh.
BEARS ARE STRONG
Pitching isn't all the Bears have
either, for Carl Hoberg, stocky Cali
fornia catcher, has hit his mid-sea
son stride, hitting safely in the last
three games. Ken Norris, first-base
man, hit U.C.L.A.'s Art Keene for
three safeties two weeks ago, includ
ing a double with the bases bulging.
Koll got to the Bruin pitcher for
two hits himself, the Bears collecting
12 in all.
INDIANS HOT
Needless to say, the Indians will be
at. their best against a California
team. Loading the Cards in batting
at this stage are Ray Hammett, Boch
Caruso, Alec Cereghino, and Hal
Costello. If the four hold their stride
and the rest of the batting order
comes out of its apparent slump,
fans may look for an upset on the
morrow.
Next Wednesday the Cards travel
to Santa Clara for a double-header,
their last two games of the Bronco
series.
