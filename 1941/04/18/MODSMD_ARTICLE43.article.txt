# Twiggsmen Battle Bears Tomorrow
## 
### 
Dr. Edward Twiggs and his six
apprentice turf surgeons go on call
again Saturday. The last time the
eminent eurer of all Stanford golf
ing ills directed an operation a cer
tain Berkeley Bear was literally torn
to bits. It was gruesome. But the
mere fact that the patient did not
succumb irked the good doctor, and
he has been working all week for
the combination of men that can
produce a complete and final anni
hilation.
However, finding the perfect com
bination is Dr. Twiggs' ioughest j
problem. Brownell, Berl, and Finger
are his three top men respectively, i
Brownell is practically a pro, but
Berl gives him two up a side and
still beats him • nowadays. Warren
hasn t shot as high as par for over
a week. And both of these boys
have to contend with Bud Finger.
.Last week Frank Tatum marched
around the course in G9 beautiful
golf shots, and Finger began to gray
around the temples. Then two days
ago George Bradley turned in a mi
raculous (57 and Tatum turned
whiteheaded overnight. But Bradley
trembles every titrje he hears the
names Guy Showley and Doe Re- i
plogle, and they in turn are scared !
still of the two regulars, Hough and i
Haslett.
Apparently the only way for Dr.
1 wiggs to clear up this mess is to I
call up the draft board and .see if
that noble organization can interest j
a few of the boys in the U.S. Army. *
1 here are too many good golfers at 1
this University.
By the way, the Stanford golfers
meet California here this Saturday.
