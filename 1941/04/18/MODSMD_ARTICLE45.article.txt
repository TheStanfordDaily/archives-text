# Tracksters Go South for Meet Against Bruins
## 
### 
Twenty-seven members of the
Stanford track and field squad leave
tonight for the Southland, where
they tangle with the U.C.L.A. Bruins
in a dual meet.
The Indians are going to have no
bed of roses in Los Angeles tomor
row, for the Bruins boast the con
ference's best sprinter in Hal Sin
clair, and the best shotputter in
Roger Hoeger. Harry Trotter has
come up with a surprise in Hu
bert Duke, a line sprinter and low
hurdler.
POLE VAULT BATTLE
There should be a grand battle in
the pole vault when Ray Maggard
of the Bruins meets Ed Tomaso.
Both boys have cleared .13 feet, 6
inches, and have their hearts set on
a place in the exclusive 14-foot
society.
Then the Bruins have their two
dependable jumpers, Jack Schilling,
who will be entered in both the
broad jump and high jump, and Paul
Schoaff, who will be favored to win
the high jump. Schoaff has a mark
of 6-5 to his credit this year, one
inch better than the efforts of either
Jim Lincoln or Vern Hart.
TRAVELLING SQUAD
Pitch Johnson's boys worked out
yesterday on a wind-swept track at
Angell Field and the travelling
squad was announced:
Roy Bursch, Vic Chambers, Ernie
Clark, John Eikelman, Jack Fyfe,
Johnny Grant, Vern Hart, Ed Hertel,
