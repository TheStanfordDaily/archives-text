# Splashers Face Cal Tomorrow
## 
### 
At 2:30 Saturday afternoon the
varsity and frosh teams of the Uni
versity of California and Stanford
will meet in their annual Big Swim.
The freshman and varsity meets
will be separate, but the events will
alternate. The meet is to be held at
Berkeley.
Stanford's varsity started off the
season looking like a surt winner.
They won their first eight meets,
including the Conference battles
against U.C.L.A. and Southern Cali
fornia. The only team that man
aged to inflict a defeat on the In
dians was the Olympic Club, the
greatest assemblage of world, P.C.C.
and A.A.U. champions that has ever
been gathered together on the West
Coast.
Until yesterday, Stanford was the
heavy favorite to win the Cal meet
and the P.C.C. championship to be
held in Los Angeles next week.
Then Co-captain Pioy Vilousek con
tracted a case of measles which defi
nitely put him out of the Cal and
P.C.C. meets. For these measles are
not the usual kind that have been
going around the campus but a much
more serious type. Vitousek had
been counted on for 17 points; first
in the 50-yard freestyle (5; and first
in the breaststroke (5). Besides this
he was anchor man on the relay
team which would have won (7).
Doc Colyear, who returned to
practice today after being in the
Rest Home with a cold, showed the
effects of his lay-off. However, he
may possibly be able to whip him
self into shape by Saturday.
Prospects for the frosh look much
better. The frosh have gone
through a "good" season, although
they have lost a couple of meets.
When they swam against Palo Alto
High last week, they took every first
place. In the Cal camp: the Blue
and Gold frosh have won exactly
one meet this season. That was
against a tank-town high school, and
it was won by forfeit..

Rest Home with a cold, showed the
effects of his lay-off. However, he
may possibly be able to whip him
self into shape by Saturday.
Prospects for the frosh look much
better. The frosh have gone
through a "good" season, although
they have lost a couple of meets.
When they swam against Palo Alto
High last week, they took every first
place. In the Cal camp: the Blue
and Gold frosh have won exactly
one meet this season. That was
against a tank-town high school, and
it was won by forfeit..
At 2:30 Saturday afternoon the
varsity and frosh teams of the Uni
versity of California and Stanford
will meet in their annual Big Swim.
The freshman and varsity meets
will be separate, but the events will
alternate. The meet is to be held at
Berkeley.
Stanford's varsity started off the
season looking like a surt winner.
They won their first eight meets,
including the Conference battles
against U.C.L.A. and Southern Cali
fornia. The only team that man
aged to inflict a defeat on the In
dians was the Olympic Club, the
greatest assemblage of world, P.C.C.
and A.A.U. champions that has ever
been gathered together on the West
Coast.
Until yesterday, Stanford was the
heavy favorite to win the Cal meet
and the P.C.C. championship to be
held in Los Angeles next week.
Then Co-captain Pioy Vilousek con
tracted a case of measles which defi
nitely put him out of the Cal and
P.C.C. meets. For these measles are
not the usual kind that have been
going around the campus but a much
more serious type. Vitousek had
been counted on for 17 points; first
in the 50-yard freestyle (5; and first
in the breaststroke (5). Besides this
he was anchor man on the relay
team which would have won (7).
Doc Colyear, who returned to
practice today after being in the
Rest Home with a cold, showed the
effects of his lay-off. However, he
may possibly be able to whip him
self into shape by Saturday.
