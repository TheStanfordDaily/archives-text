netmen went into Berkeley as fa
vorites yesterday, hat were handed
a surprising 7-2 lacing by the me
diocre University of California
squad. The Bear victory placed Ihem
in second spot in the conference
standings, and shoved the Cards
down to third.
The Bears gave evidence of their
power last Saturday when they
scared the mighty Trojans by sweep
ing the first three singles matches,
but today their show was complete.
California swept five of the six sin
gles matches, and lost but one of
the doubles, that one to the Inter
collegiate Doubles Champs Larry
Dee and Jimmy Wade.
WADE TAKES HIS
It was Wade also who gave the
Cards their only singles win. Wade
started fast and swept through
sophomore ace Bob McCaughin of
the Bears, 6-4, 6-2.
The rest of the singles matches
were a series of disasters. Emery
Neale, making his first start as
number one man, fell before the
sharp volleying, smashing game of
Bob Hippensteil. Neale won the
first set, lost the next two to bow,
6-4, 7-9. 11-9.
Larry Dee, Stanford's potential
great, went down to his third
straight conference defeat, losing to
Bill Canning, 7-5, 6-4. Captain Bob
Low had another three-set duel,
which ended up wtih a 6-4, 2-6, 6-4
win for George Spencer.
KRUCiER LOSES TO BROWN
Tom Kruger, playing five, won
his first set 6-2, then eased up to
lose to Sophomore Tom Brown of
the Bears. Jack Gurley continued
in his slump by allowing Jimmy
Livingstone a sound 6-1, 6-1 win.
Dee and Wade powered their way
through Canning and Ammonette,
6-4, 6-2, while the teams of Low
and Stan Owen, and Chuck Hutchi
son and A1 Rose both went down.
The Stanford freshmen lost to the
Bear Cubs, 6-3. Harry Buttimer of
