Quads will be on sale today from
8 to 3 o'clock at the post office, ac
cording to Jim McKellar, business
manager.
"We advise those students who
have not yet purchased their an
nuals to do so today, because they
are going fast," he pointed out. "At |
the rate they went last Friday, they j
won't last more than two or three
weeks." Students may still have |
their names on the Quads.
