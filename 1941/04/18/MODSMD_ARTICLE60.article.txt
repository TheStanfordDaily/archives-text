ONCE upon a time not so long ago, a spritely
freshman came to Stanford. One after
noon early in winter quarter this laddie mean
dered out of Encina en route to the Cellar.
Being new to the Farm, he lost his way, and
after wandering about blithely for an hour or so
inoticed a little green building with a constant
stream of Roughs and Farmerettes pouring in
and out.
"Ah, hah," said this young frosh to himself,
"this must be the Union Cellar!" And so he
walked in.
♦ Someone shoved a sheaf of paper into his
hand. "We need hundreds of fillers in a hurry,"
murmured a sweet young thing. An arm
grabbed his coat collar and set him in a sway
backed chair. For several hours he cut and
pasted fillers. "Have you signed up for nights
on desk?" asked another lassie, so he signed
up for nights on desk. "Remember you've got
the Firehouse beat," reminded several voices
as he finally found the door.
That evening a friendly sponsor tipped him
off. The little green building turned out to be
the Daily shack.
Being an open-minded sort of frosh—besides
one of the lassies had been superbly attractive —
our friend came back to the shack the next af
ternoon.
And he's been coming back ever since.
Sunday afternoon and evening, our frosh and
several odd dozen of his mates will have that
Daily shack all to themselves.
Monday will see the freshman issue of The
Daily emerge upon a hitherto unsuspecting cam
pus. That gang of '44 will make the issue their
own baby. And the gang that in a few short
years will be running things around here will
turn out a darned good paper Monday. Watch
and see.
