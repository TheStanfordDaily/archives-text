# Two Snakes Met
## 
### 
DID you ever stop to consider what would
happen if two snakes met, and each took
the other's tail in his mouth and began eating?
Two such snakes met yesterday in an inter
view The Daily had with Professor Thomas Bai
ley regarding the pro and con problems of con
voying as a part of America's Aid-to-Britain pro
gram. In the course of the interview, Professor
Bailey stated:
1. That he thinks convoys will be an inevi
table part of effective American aid to Britain.
2. That convoys definitely mean war with
Germany.
"When we start convoying, the Germans
start shooting and that is war," he said.
Now, from the start, it must be admitted that
Professor Bailey is not infallible. No man is. But
in matters pertaining to such things as convoy
ing and diplomatic moves between this nation
and that nation, Dr. Bailey is highly regarded as
an authority. His latest book, "A Diplomatic
History of the American People," is already be
ing used as the text in hundreds of U.S. schools.
As such he is well qualified to make such a
statement.
He has presented these two snakes. Both have
begun eating. And the outcome is inevitable—
somebody is going to get eaten. There is no
escaping that fact.
If one plus one equals two, then by the same
process we may say that if we give aid to
Britain—which we are doing and have indi
cated we intend to do—and if convoying is a
part of effective aid to Britain, and if convoying
means war, well, then, that means . . .
Add it up. One plus one equals two. You
supply the answer.
And apparently over 70 per cent of Stanford
students are good at mathematics. They have
done this quick addition, and they have by a
logical, step by step course arrived at the cor
ect answer.
All this is in keeping with the words that Bill
Turner wrote back from Washington a few days
ago after talking to diplomats from several
countries.

"I can now sadly say that I have every
reason to believe that we'll be in war within
three months. By participation in war, I mean
we will at least be convoying goods."
Again we say, Stanford's right hand in Wash
ington would be interested in what Stanford's
left hand in Palo Alto is doing, and saying.
No, no, you say. This editorial is a lot of rot.
It's emotional pap. We are just rationalizing.
Or is it you who are rationalizing?
Remember that one plus one equals two. If
you don't like the inevitable answer—and you
don't—you can refuse to begin the addition.—
B. A.
