### JERRY MAYER 
SO IT AIN'T FUNNY
\VHAT Bull Session is going to write about today is
mostly hearsay. It is about funny things profes
sors have said and done during lectures. TTiis writer
has seen few professors who he thought were funny.
He has seen few professors who he thought were amus
ing. The only exceptions, incidentally, are the pro
fessors he is taking this quarter. By some queer quirk
of fate they are all amusing, and highly instructive.
My professors this quarter are all one could ask for.
And all I want to do is graduate, gentlemen. Grades
of "C" will be fine.
One of the military professors has a tremendous
sense of humor. He started out his class this quarter
by telling a riotous story. Everyone in the class was
laughing till the tears ran from their eyes. (I reserve
that occasion for the time my parents beat me to my
transcript when it's mailed home at the end of every
quarter.)
But one little fellow sitting in the front row didn't
laugh at all. He just ast there staring at the pro
fessor without the trace of a smile on his face. The
professor swung around and bitterly assailed him:
"Listen, brother," he said, "can you do any better?"

at U.C.L.A., one of the professors was quite
put out by the lack of attention he was receiving
from his class. The members of the class were either
talking quietly among themselves or snoozing. Finally
the professor called on one of the students to give
him a number.
"Forty-three," said the student, disinterestedly. The
professor wrote the number "34" on the blackboard
and looked slyly around at the class. There was abso
lutely no response. He called on another student for a
number.
"Fifty-eight," said the student, yawning. The pro
fessor wrote "85" on the blackboard and looked around
slyly. There was not a sign of surprise, interest, or
even curiosity from the class. Finally, he called on a
third member of the class for a number.
"Seventy-seven," said the student. Then he thought
for a moment. "And switch that one around, dammit."

'"JpHIS happened several years ago at Stanford during
an examination in an art course. It was a rainy,
stormy day, and suddenly the lights went out. The
students started roaring, hollering, not to mention
screaming. If you want to get right down to cases,
they were also bellowing. The room was pitch dark.
Everyone was having difficulty writing their exams.
Suddenly a cool voice called out. It was the pro
fessor. "Don't worry," he said, "I'll save you."
And he walked down the aisle holding a match
over his head.

is the story concerning Robert Benchley
when he was a student taking a course in inter
national law at Harvard. Came the day for the final,
and Mr. Benchley arrived at the class a half-hour
late, his hair mussed, his clothes in a general state of
disarray, his eyes blood-shot. He took one look at
the only question on the ex: "Discuss in detail the
aspect of international law involved in the New
foundland Fisheries Case."
Mr. Benchley sat down, wrote rapidly, almost fa
natically, for 15 minutes, and then handed in his ex
amination. The professor, curious to see what the re
sult of Benchley's antics would be, immediately read
the paper.
"It seems to me," read the exam, "that too little
attention is paid in these days of stress to the emo
tional and physical readjustment of the fish them
selves." The paper then went on to discuss the re
actions of the fish to the canning process. It was an
interesting paper, albeit the international law angle
was largely disregarded.
The professor gave Benchley a C-minus in the
course, but when the writer-to-be showed up for the
I sister-course the following semester, he threw him out
of the class bodily.
