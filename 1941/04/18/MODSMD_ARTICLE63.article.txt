## CELLAR TALK AGAIN 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
We herewith respectfully submit the sequel to
the saga of the general who died at dawn While wait
ing for his breakfast at the Union Cellar.
The authorities having removed the body, the waiter
stepped back to the glass stand, leaned comfortably
against it, and thought to himself:
"Poor man, he certainly deserved a better fate.
But after all, this is only the Cellar and all who enter
here take their chances equally."
Yes, after all it is only the Cellar, and while the
price the patron pays for his food puts him in a posi
tion to demand the most precise service (and all the
trimming to match), someone ought to see that the
waiter who bears the brunt of these demands is suffi
ciently rewarded. The opportunity of goggling at a
Roblc-Roustabout is poor recompense for it. Even if
said roustabout should goggle back with equal intent.
There is a nasty rumor making the rounds to the
effect that the Cellar and Annex showed a profit in
five figures (not counting decimal places) for the busi
ness of last year. Nor was the first of these five fig
ures the lowest figure possible in that digit. Further,
certain of the uppy-ups connected with the Cellar and
Annex between them have vacations in the "Islands,"
drive big cars, sport fine plumes, and all in all have
a high old time both on duty and off.
Perhaps these are the ones who should be wearing
the white. They, at least, have returns large enough
to make them interested in their work. And it is only
when one is interested in what, he is doing that he can
do it well. It would not be surprising then, to find
the Cellar service somewhat spontaneous rather than
something Ihat practically has to be begged for, and
then is received only when such supplications are fol
lowed immediately with threats of overt acts of war.
This letter does not ask for a reform. It is written
solely in answer to the question, "What happened
then?" The foregoing article to which this is the se
quel does not make that answer quite clear.
We might add, too, that while the waiter was fired,
this in no way restored the general's life, and further,
in spite of it, the general's compatriots continued to
drop off one by one, morning after morning.
"People," in the words of the poet, "are a bunch of
materialists, and just won't work for nothing."
