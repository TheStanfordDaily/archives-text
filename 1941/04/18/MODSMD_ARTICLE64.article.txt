# Vivid People Typify Life In Wild City

"City of Illusion," by Vardis
Fisher. Available at the Stanford
Bookstore.
One of the wildest, most glittering,
most fantastic episodes in the build
ing of the West took place in the
Comstoek Lode, specifically in Vir
ginia City, Nev. And if there was
ever an author to write about Vir
ginia City in all its gaudy, weallhy
squalor, Vardis Fisher, whose "Chil
dren of God" won the Harper's prize
last year, was the man to do it
FABULOUS CITY
In his epitaph chapter, Fisher
writes, "The most fabulous city in
American history had spanned its
brief glory and come to its end."
And he describes the panic and ruin
of Nevada after the stock market
collapse of the '80's; the slow decay
and disintegration of a city built
over GOO miles of tunnels. But main
ly Fisher is concerned with the
people and events that brought Vir
ginia City into being.
The story of "City of Illusion" is
told through the life of Eilly Orrum,
or Mrs. Allison Orrum Hunter Cow
an Bowers, Queen of the Comstoek.
In 1840 Eilly Orrum ran a boarding
house and wayside inn for stray
prospectors in Gold Canyon. A des
olate region, few outside of Eilly, a
few marauding Irishmen and Chinese
place-miners, and lecherous old
"Pancake" Comstoek, hesitated on
their way to California.
LUCK IN SILVER
But Eilly and the others wanted
gold; through a streak of great good
fortune, not of their own making,
they were to have silver. And Eilly,
the myth-maker, was to realize her
prophecy that some day she would
be rich.
Eilly Orrum wasn't one of the
shrewd big four, Mackay, Fair,
Flood, and O'Brien, who exploited
Virginia City, and on the collapse of
silver, fled the devastated town with
fortune intact, nor was she, like
Adolph Sutro, one of those who had

the welfare of the miners at heart.
But it was her conviction the Vir
ginia City belonged to her and she
to it, that she was its guiding spirit
and uncrowned Queen.
FAMOUS VISITORS
Naturally enough then, through
her cabins earlier, and later through
the Bowers mansion (still one of
the landmarks in Virginia City)
moved the fabulous figures of Mark
Twain, Sutro, John Mackay. Bill
Fair, and other representatives of
the era and place.
Fisher makes these people and
Virginia City and Gold Hill come
alive in this book. Like "Children
of God," its harsh realism is a little
hard to take at times, but it can't
be beaten for a little extra-curricular
reading, this city that in its hey-day
was the "itching palm and hunger
ing heart of a nation."â€”Farrell
