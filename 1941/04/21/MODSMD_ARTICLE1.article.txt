A LTHOUGH Hitler ciid not want
to fight a war on two fronts,
and although Yugoslavia was the
13th country with which he tangled,
the war seems to be going his way
in the Balkans.
The Germans claim that the
"Birthday Drive," a special show for
Hitler, has resulted in the capture
of Trikkala, a vital railroad center,
in the open Thessaly plain; and that
the British and Greek troops are in
utter rout and are attempting to
throw up a new front only 75 miles
long between the gulfs of Euboea
and Arta and running through La
mia and Thermopylae Pass at the
narrowest point of Greece. The
Nazis have likening thsi stand to that
of the Spartan King Leonidas when
the Persian hordes carried out a
similar flanking movement and
slaughtered the defenders. The
Persians were barbarians too.
The Greeks claim that the main
allied line "remains intact every
where" and although they have
been making "adjustments" this
action has been orderly and car
ried out "according to plan." It
seems that the Germans have
been carrying on a blitzkrieg for
six days with no regard for life
or equipment, and heavy losses
have been inflicted; but, because
of the sheer weight of their num
bers, "the situation is still se
rious."
The British press has undertaken
a program of preparing the British
people for more reverses and has
hinted that the British troops may
be withdrawn from Greece. This
seems to mean that, although the
British and Greek lines have been
resisting bravely and that their
lines have been holding, Greece will
eventually fall before Hitler's great
machine. Maybe the Germans' boast
ing screams of another Dunkirk will
soon become a reality. They have
concentrated their dive bombers on
the ports of Volos and Chalcis and
"British evacuation units" have
been blasted.
Although these reports seem to
contradict each other flatly it is
possible that both are largely true
â€”that the Greeks are retreating in
an orderly manner and that the
(Hermans are advancing but that
they have scored no major break
through.

'"pilE defense of Tobruk has now
been going on for six days and
the sands outside are piled high
with dead and dying attackers. The
Germans are apparently trying to
duplicate the feat of the Australian
infantry when they captured Tobruk
in January, because they have been
concentrating on the same sector
where the "Aussies" broke through
four months ago.
A dispatch from Tobruk reported
that German tanks had machine
gunned fleeing Italians but it did not
state whether it was intentional or
whether the Fascists, scattering in
disorder, had been caught in the line
of fire. Many of the attacks have
taken place in sandstorms so it is not
hard to imagine that a mix-up might
easily have occurred.

WILLIAM S. MORRISON. Brit
ish Minister of Home Secur
ity, warned England to he careful
of gas attacks if (he present aerial
blitzkrieg does not succeed in
breaking British morale. Whether
or not gas will succeed in its ob
jective, causing panic and stam
pedes, is not known, but the Brit
ish are urgently advised to carry
their masks with them at all times.
The civilian gas masks are ade
quate preparation against any
"known" gas but whether the gas
Germany is reported to be pre
paring is "known" is a question of
utmost importance to England's
future.
In Hyde Park President Roosevelt
and Prime Minister MacKenzie
King of Canada tied tighter the knot
of co-operation for hemisphere de
fense and "the defense of the Brit
ish Empire." Under this plan the
nations will share those materials
each is best able to produce. Can
ada is expected to contribute mate
irals amounting to 300 million dol
lars, including aluminum and ships,
both vitally necessary.
