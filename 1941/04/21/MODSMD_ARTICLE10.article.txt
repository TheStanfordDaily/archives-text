# Turner Relates Trip Itinerary
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Completing a two weeks' jaunt of
over 7000 miles across the United
States as Stanford's representative to
Washington. Bill Turner, Farm sen
ior, returned last night with enough
impressions to last anyone a life
time.
Along with students from Wiscon
sin, Columbia, Harvard, and Texas,
Turner expressed the views of Pa
cific Coast Colleges upon the war sit
uation to President Franklin D.
Roosevelt as part of the Young
America Wants to Help mission.
WHITE HOUSE TRIP
Highlighting his visit in Wash
ington was a trip through the White
House escorted by Mrs. Roosevelt,
referred to as "Eleanor" by Turner.
The tour followed an interview with
the President. During the journey
he met Harry L. Hopkins in the
same room where Lincoln signed the
Emancipation Proclamation.
In this same day, Turner met Sec
retary of War Stimson and the Polish
Prime Minister, Sikorski. Turner,
with the background of one quarter
of French at Stanford, attempted to
meet Sikorski conversationally on
this common ground. Asking him
how long he had been in the United
States, he said, "Depuis quand
etes-vous arrive?" So much laugh
ter resulted that Turner never re
ceived an answer to his question.
POOR MILKSHAKE
Only complete failure of the jour
ney resulted from an attempt to get
a creamy milkshake on the top of
Rockefeller Center. A concoction of
malt and chocolate sauce was the
ghastly result.
On the way home, Turner was
treated like a "king" at Northwest
ern University, where he met some
of his friends from his trip to Japan
last summer. These two trips made
a combined mileage of 23,000 miles
within a year for the travelling
Stanfordite. He found Chicago fun
damentally isolationist as contrasted
with the East, which he character
ized as ready to enter the war.
