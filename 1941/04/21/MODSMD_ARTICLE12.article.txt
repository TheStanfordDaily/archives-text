# QUAD EDITOR DISCOVERS MOSAIC
## 
### AL HAMPSON 
Thirty-live years ago last Friday,
on April IS. 1!)06, the Stanford Me
morial Chapel was destroyed by the
earthquake. Last Friday pieccs of
the golden mosaic from the facade
were found on the grading of Lo
mita Drive by Chuck Runacres, edi
tor of the Quad.
As Chuck was picking his way
across the ungraded dirt toward the
Quad offices he noticed sonic of the
bright squares of the mosaic. He
picked up a few and "soon there
were large scale excavations."
For the first time the editors of
the Quad, Chappie, and Daily work
ed with complete accord as they
tried to uncover the relics. With the
aid of a shovel, a geology hammer,
and a couple of pieces of lath they
scraped away the dirt and gravel
covering the pieces of the original
chapel. ,
The more perfect pieccs were put
in private piles but these soon had
to be moved to the top of the nearby
manhole covers because the "cat"
and tumble-bug that were levelling
the road threatened to scoop them
up and use them as ballast.
Twice the big tractor stopped.
Once to ask if gold had been discov
ered and once while eager pros
pectors rescued their private caches
I from beneath its cleats. After the
tumble-bug had passed and scraped
off a new layer of dirt the waiting
group of students would rush in and
J glean the little squares of gilt and

glazed tile.
When all these little scraps of tile
had been picked up more serious
excavations with the shovel and the
geology pick were begun, only to be
stopped when the grader came by
again.
Mr. McDonald, head of the road
construction and campus mainte
nance, saw the crowd and came to
see "whether oil had been struck or
if the tractor had run over some
one."
'"When the front of the Chapel

'collapsed in the big earthquake,"
Mr. McDonald said, "there were
pieces of colored mosaic all around
the place. Lots of the stuff was cart
ed off to this fill."
He said that for many years scraps,
of the blue, gold, pink, and green
patterns could be found along the
banks of San Francisquito Creek
but they have been taken away un
til now none arc left.
Although the staffs of the Quad,
Chappie, and Daily were content
with one or two pieces each, a "for
eigner" presented himself with his
Ford car and completely took over
the excavations. Each piece he
found, whether gold or pink, de
signed or plain, perfect or ruined
went on his own particular man
hole cover and was then transported
to his car. When he was asked
what he would do with his collection
he looked up from his search long
enough to say, "Put them on the
mantel," and then he resumed his
search.
Whether it was the desire to have
souvenirs of the Chapel on the 35th
anniversary of its destruction to put
on their mantels or whether it was
the desire to undersell the postcard
booth at the Memorial Arch, the
mosaic hunting was carried on with
keen interest until all the surround'
ing man-hole covers were piled
high with salvaged scraps and the
tumble-bug scattered the rest of the
scraps the entire length of Lomita
Drive.
