# Friend of University Since '05 Observes Changes in Campus
## 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
All old colonial home way down on University Avenue . . . immense
pillars with a porch light shining through them so that the hoyse, set
back among the trees, has an air of distinction that is due a home, not
only almost as old as the University, but preserving the same dignity—a
house that has become a landmark to generations of Stanford students as

these same students have
part of the life of Mrs. J. A. Squire,
who lives there and has watched
Stanford prow.
Sitting in a room of fading grand
eur . . . her white hair soft in the
light of an old lamp—she graciously
answered the questions that were
awakening so many memories.
"Oh, my yes, the University lias
changed a great deal. Why, it isn't,
at all as it used to be ... at first
Stanford seemed to be part of Palo
Alto ... it was smaller then and
most of the University faculty lived
in town . . . that way everyone knew
everyone else and we all could take
more advantage of the programs
and lectures on the campus.
CON HOME FOUNDING
"Yes, I knew Mrs. Stanford ... at
least to say 'hello' . . . and I have
known Mrs. Hoover for a good
many years.
"The Convalescent Home? 1 re
member when it. was first started in
the Stanford Home . . . we all helped
contribute. . . . Or. Gardner, the
first pastor of the Chapel, an Eng
lishman with quite a brogue, began
the drive for contributions ... it
became kind of a community proj
ect and we all subscribed to it
yearly . . . later contributions be
gan to be larger as the wealthier
people heard about it . . . and en
dowments were made.
MORE GIRLS
"Admitting so many girls into the
University has changed things a
great deal ... of course I think it's
a good thing . . . it's real nice the
girls can come . . . my own girls
went there and they love it just as
I do . . . but I do think that the
campus will be overrun with girls
in time . . .
"Oh, it has all changed , so much
. . . since we came here in '05. . . .
The earthquake was the next year,
you know . . . our house was fortu
nate, but the quake wreaked havoc
on the campus. . . . After they rebuilt
things they seemed to keep right on
building, and the University has
grown so large . . . so many of the
old professors have retired, too. . . .
it seems to me there are a lot of
real young professors teaching now
. . . the University and the town
have become more and more sepa
rate communities, and that way we
have lost that same personal con
tact . . ."
There was a pause as she sat re
membering, and then across the
years she came back to me and
smiled . . . "But you all love Stan
ford the way it is. don't you?"
