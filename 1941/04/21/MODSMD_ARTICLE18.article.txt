# Farm's New Mag Must Have Name
## 
### 
"There's a new baby on the Farm
and it's GOT to have a name!" With
those words, the campus is invited
to have a try at naming the new
magazine, which received official ap
proval at last week's Ex Committee
meeting. The name "Stanford In
dian" is purely tentative. What the
magazine needs is something short
and snappy, a name that is strictly
Stanford.
An organization meeting for the
publication was held Thursday night
at which some twenty prospective
editors, business managers, and
contributors were present. It was
carefully explained there by Editor
Clarence Burley that it is not pro
posed to produce a "literary" maga
zine; the real aim is a popular, gen
eral-interest monthly, including ar
ticles and stories, mostly of student
authorship.
Tentative publication date for the
first issue is May 28. During the
next week there will be a box in
the Cellar lobby for proposed names,
and the person submitting tlic name
finally used will receive credit in the
first issue.
