# Proposed $3,444,000,000 Defense Taxes Program Hits All Income Brackets
## Changes Being Considered Include Lowering of Marriage Exemptions, One-cent Increase in Gasoline Levy 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 20 (UP). —Congress begins work tomorrow on a
record $11,444,000,000 (B) national defense tax program. It will hit the
rich, the middle class and the poor, and expand the income tax base to
embrace multiple thousands now exempt.
Later in the week public hearings will be opened. Committee Chairman

Robert L. Doughton, D, N.C., hopes
to conclude them in a fortnight and
then put his group to work writing
the most far-reaching tax bill in the
nation's history. It is expected to be
brought to the House floor by the
middle of May.
A preview of the schedule of new
imposts indicates that the heavier
income tax burden will fall on per
sons earning between $5,000 and
$50,000 a year, although there will
be increases in taxes on incomes
above this category. The middle
class income was selected as the chief
target because top incomes are so
heavily taxed as to preclude them
as a source of lucrative added rev
enue.

Elimination of the 10 per cent ex
emption on earned income.
A drastic bopst in the 10 per cent
defense tax.
WASHINGTON, April 20 (UP). —Congress begins work tomorrow on a
record $11,444,000,000 (B) national defense tax program. It will hit the
rich, the middle class and the poor, and expand the income tax base to
embrace multiple thousands now exempt.
Later in the week public hearings will be opened. Committee Chairman

Robert L. Doughton, D, N.C., hopes
to conclude them in a fortnight and
then put his group to work writing
the most far-reaching tax bill in the
nation's history. It is expected to be
brought to the House floor by the
middle of May.
A preview of the schedule of new
imposts indicates that the heavier
income tax burden will fall on per
sons earning between $5,000 and
$50,000 a year, although there will
be increases in taxes on incomes
above this category. The middle
class income was selected as the chief
target because top incomes are so
heavily taxed as to preclude them
as a source of lucrative added rev
enue.
