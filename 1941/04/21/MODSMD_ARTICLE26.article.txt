# 'Comedy' Twins Made Identical
## 
### 
The twin population of Stanford
will be increased by two sets on the
nights of April 24, 25, and 26. when
the make-up class finishes work on
the leads for Shakespeare's "The
Comedy of Errors" to be presented
next week in Memorial Hall under
the direction of Charles Vance.
According to Miss Hazel Brain, as
sistant technical director, the prob
lem of making identical twins of
Asher Wilson and Dana Winters,
who play the slave duo, Dromio of
Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus,
respectively, is more difficult than
for the Antipholus brothers, who
will be portrayed by Paul Hostetler
and John Lawry.
Winters and Wilson are to have
identical costumes, but padding will
be necessary to equalize their sizes.
Duplicate red wigs and noses of
plastic make-up will complete the
doubles illusion for these two comic
characters, who will also wear old
Latin comedy make-up.
No padding will be needed to
make Lawry and Hostetler like
twins, since their measurements are
exactly the same except for a one
half-inch difference in one place.
They will also wear identical wigs
and coltumes.
Another striking feature of the
make-up to be used in this farce
will be the hair styles. Since the
women of ancient Greece and
Rome bleached and dyed their hair
in vivid colors, women in the cast
will appear with stylized versions
of this Greco-Roman coiffure. Plans
call for heads to be lacquered in
copper, silver, and gold hues.
All sets of twins living on the
campus or in Palo Alto are re
minded that they are eligible for
free passes to the opening night per
formance. Mr. Barker at P.A. 22041
will supply any further ticket in
formation.
