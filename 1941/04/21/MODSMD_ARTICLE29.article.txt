# Pacific Coast Geologists Meet On Farm
## 
### 
Eminent geologists from all over
America attended the meeting of
the G.S.A. (Geological Society of
America) held at Stanford over the
week-end. Although the meeting
was officially for the Cordilleran
Section, which includes the Pacific
Coast, many Eastern geologists at
tended the Conference.
Included among the Eastern visi
tors to the Conference were Pro
fessor Chester Longweel of Yale and
Professor Karl Ver Steeg from the
College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio.
Representatives from Oregon State,
Washington, Arizona, Montana, Ne
vada, and many California colleges
also attended.
Professor H. G. Schenck of the
Stanford Geology Department was
vice-president of the Conference and
various Stanford professors including
Eliot Blackwelder, A. M. Keen, A.
F. Roberts, E. T. Schenck, and A. C.
Waters read papers. R. R. Thorup
and F. B. Roberts, Stanford gradu
ate students, also read papers.
One of the most interesting papers
for earthquake-minded Californians
was the discussion of the Imperial
Valley earthquake of May 1940 by
John P. Buwalda and Charles F.
Richter. This shock was of unusual
geological interest because it was
accompanied by a surface fault rup
ture about 40 miles long, showing a
previously unsuspected fault.
The Conference came to a success
ful close Sunday with a field ex
cursion led by M. B. Kildale of Stan
ford and Charles M. Gilbert of the
University of California.
