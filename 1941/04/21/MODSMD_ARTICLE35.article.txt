# Pro Arte Plays Goossens' Quartet
## 
### 
While Eugene Goossens is not an
amateur, still his Quartet No. 2,
Opus 59, cannot compare with the
quartets by Beethoven and Schu
bert, which were on the same pro
gram given by the Pro Arte Siring
Quartet yesterday.
Beethoven's Quartet in C Major,
Opus 59, No. 3 and Schubert's Quar
tet in A Minor, Opus 29, were as
good as they always have been.
The first movement of Goossens'
quartet was much better than the
other three. Goossens attempted too
many experiments in his quartet,
and some of them were noticeably
unsuccessful. While he has the heart
of fire needed by a composer, Goos
sens lacks ihe mind of ice.—Thomp
son
BUTTE, Mont., April 20 (UP).—
Senator Burton K. Wheeler, address
ing an audience of nearly 2,000 in
his "home town," today asked the
nation to have the '"intestinal stami
na" to demand that President Roo
sevelt keep it out of war.
