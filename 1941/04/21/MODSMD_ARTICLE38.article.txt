## Card Cindermen Conquer Bruins as Meet Records Fall to Hart and Peck 
### 
Despite (tie loss of Blair Hyde, the inability of Francis Olson to run
his best, and a contested decision in favor of C.C.L.A., Stanford s track
team managed to eke out an 85 I / i» to 45'' 2 victory over the Bruins in the
Ix»s Angeles Coliseum last Saturday afternoon.
Ilyde (Hilled a muscle while warming up before the meet, while Olson

had just recovered from a series of<
boils that had retarded his training.
The decision in question came in
the 100-yard dash when Bruin Hal
Sinclair was given a victory over
John Grant, contrary to the wishes
of the press box and crowd of 500
that watched the meet.
Only two meet records broken
were in the high jump and pole
vault. Stanford men Vein Hart and
Russ Peck, respectively, were the
men to set the new standards. Hart
cleared 6 feet 5% inches, higher than
he had ever done previously, while
Peck made 13 feet 6%, also a new
personal record.
Sinclair in taking the 220, as well
as the 100, was the only winner for
the Southerners. Ed Hertel of Stan
ford was the only other double win
ner of the meet, taking both hurdle
races.
Probably the biggest surprise of
the day oame in the shot put. when
Indian A1 Grey, who had an
nounced his retirement from track
this week, won with a put of 50
feet even, defeating the highly fa
vored Briun captain, Roger Hoeger,
who took fourth when he could only
do 45 feet.
Kai Larsen defeated Bruin sopho
more Ken Boyd in the 880 with the
ailing Olson taking third. The time,
1 min. 58.8 sec., was only mediocre.
Larsen combined with Skrable,
Clark, and Don McFarland, who
took second in the 220, to breeze
through the relay in 3 min. 27.9 sec.
Emerson Hiler continued to throw
the discus 150 feet, 7V2 inches past it
this time. Bob Stone although
throwing 36 feet behind his best,
won the javelin, and Vic Chambers
broad-jumped 23 feet 3% inches,
more than enough to win.
