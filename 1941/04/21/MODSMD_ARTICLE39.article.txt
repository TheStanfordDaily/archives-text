# "T" Machine Begins Heavy Scrimmage
## 
### 
With Coach Clark Shaughnessy in
the driver's teat, Stanford's Big Red
Machine goes to work in earnest this
week in an attempt to repeat last
season's national championship rec
ord. All men, both old and novice,
will report to practice four days per
week from now on through the
season.
Wilh five of the thirty field drills
allowed by Pacific Coast rules al
ready gone, the Model "T" will
trundle out in full force for the rest
of the spring practice sessions. Al
though no scrimmage is planned for
the first few days, heavy contact will
start in earnest soon, probably at
the first of next week.
Friday's field drill saw an all
freshman backfield take the prize
for the speed and precision with
which they ran plays off the "T"
formation. Especially good was the
work of "Buck" Fawcett at the right
half position and Bob Koch at full.
