# Frosh Baseballers Win in Tenth, 1-0
## 
### 
Coming through with one of the
finest hurling efforts seen at Stan
ford in many a day, Don Pender
grass stopped the Cal Cub nine on
two hits. In addition to allowing
only two hits Pendergrass struck
out 18 Cal frosh, furnishing a new
high in freshman pitching for the
year. Stanford won, 1-0.
The victory came the hard way.
Jae Katz, hurling for the Cub base
ballers, pitched very pretty ball and
the frosh got to him for a total of
only five hits. Going into /the last
half of the tenth inning neither
team had scored and it was not un
til the Indian youngsters got the
bases filled and Colin MacKay had
lifted a deep fly to the Cal out
field that the win was assured.
The game was beautifully pitched
and well played. The next games of
the Papoose-Cub series should fur
nish baseball of just as excellent a
quality.
