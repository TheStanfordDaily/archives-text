# Cal Sinks Varsity Swimmers; Papooses Defeat Cubs, 56-16
## 
### 
The University of California varsity swimming team won a victory
from Stanford in the annual Big Swim held Saturday in the California
[Memoriarl Pool. The 51 to 24 score is in no way significant, for with
Vitousck out with the measles and Howie Adams ineligible for diving,
the Indian varsity was definitely behind the 8 ball.

After winning eight straight
and losing only to the invincible
Olympic Club team, the Card swim
mers finished their season like the
proverbial hard-luck boys. Bill Mc-
Campbell, middle distance ace, was
the only Bear swimmer to take two
victories. The Cal team was primed
for the meet; and with the Indians
in such poor shape, a Bear victory
was inevitable.

FROSH MEET
The Stanford frosh compensated
the varsity defeat by trimming the
Bear Cubs 56 to 16.
The Papoose swimmers were in
top form. The medley relay team of
Pete Lee, Tod Gardner, and Rey
Rule came within four-tenths of
the 3:16.4 record. The frosh copped

440, 100, and 50-yard freestyle and
220-yard breaststroke races.
