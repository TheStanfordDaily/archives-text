# Yearling Netmen Outplay Modesto
## 
### 
After losing to a crack Cal squad
last Thursday, Stanford's freshman
tennis team came back Saturday to
swamp Modesto Junior College, 8-1.
Even without Bruce Wylie in the
No. 1 spot and Emery Rogers in the
No. 2 position, the frosh racquetmen
easily overwhelmed the weak Pirate
squad.
Sutton, Salisbury, Kimball, and
Hughes won the singles competition,
as Tibbetts suffered the only de
feat of the day.
