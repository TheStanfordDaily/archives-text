### H. D. THOREAU 
For those who plan to stay on the
Farm during the summer and those
who might be around for a few
weeks after finals, there will be a
very worthwhile track meet in the
stadium, June 20 and 21. It will be
the Twentieth Annual National
Collegiate Athletic Association Track
and Field Championships, which are
to be held at Stanford for the first
time since their inauguration in
1921.
Although Stanford won't be rep
resented with as strong a team as
they have had in previous years, the
way Pitch Johnson's boys are com
ing along there will be several of
them in the fight for individual
honors. The team championship
will, as usual, go to Southern Cali
fornia, with Cal, Texas, Indiana, and
Nebraska as the chief challengers.
Incidentally, the Trojans have an
nexed the title for six consecutive
years after finishing second to Stan
ford in the 1934 meet.
In eight out of the 14 events the
men who -won last year at Minne
apolis will be back to defend their
crowns. These men, plus 40-point
winners and a batch of promising
sophomores, will provide plenty of
excellent competition.

Stanford's varsity baseballers gave
up 21 free passes to some under
privileged tots Saturday, so that the
children might enjoy America's fa
vorite pastime free for nothin'.

Stanford's tennis team, which is
considered by many to be the No. 8
collegiate team in the country, has
sworn to avenge the ignominious
defeat they suffered at the hands of
Cal last week at Berkeley when the
two teams have a rematch here this
week.

PORTLAND, Ore., April 20 (UP).
