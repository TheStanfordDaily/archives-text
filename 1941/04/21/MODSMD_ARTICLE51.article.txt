A very much mangled Lai JBear
I crawled whimpering back to his den
| last Saturday after a squad of de
! termined Stanford men gave him an
| unmerciful beating with their golf
clubs. What the Berkeley Bear saw
on the scoreboard as he glanced
! back over his bloody shoulder and
I hurried away from the country club
was Stanford 23'2, Cal 3 1 •»
And that fuzzy animal knew that
he was mighty lucky to carry away
1 with him those 3Vi> digits. The Card
I squad went to town in tin.' singles
j competition and at the end of the
morning the Cal greensmen found
themselves shut out in that division.
Bud Brownell again failed to break
par as he shot a one-under 71 to
lead the Farm team with the day's
best performance.
In doubles, Coach Edward Twiggs
decided to show a little mercy in
dealing with his foes from across

the bay. He called ofl his experts of
the morning slaughter. And then the
two-faced Twiggs turned right
around and sicced another crew of
raanglers on the bewildered Bear.
However, the Cal critter regained its
composure long enough to bite a
nick out of the combination of Har
bour and Hayes for 1 point.
