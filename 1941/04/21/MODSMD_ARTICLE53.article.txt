# Maybe Some Day
## 
### 
A SPECIAL faculty committee has for the past
four months been investigating living con
ditions among various Campus groups, giving
special consideration to Encina Hall. That some
what antiquated structure, having housed the
first Stanford freshman class, now holds within
its aging walls some 450 men of the class of '44.
In view of the investigation and the fact that
we live in that hallowed brown building along
with the other 449, we offer the following bits of
suggestion, that:
1. Instead of crowding three men into a single
room, only two be allowed to share the same
room.
2. Instead of combining study and sleeping
quarters, the two should be made into separate
units with a connecting door, as are used with
success in Branner and Toyon.
3. Instead of connecting all electrical cords to
a single outlet, double wall plugs be put into
use which will minimize the danger of fire
caused by subjecting wires to over-wattage.
If the feeling is still unanimous that a year
spent in Encina is an experience that every man
will remember for the rest of his days, let some
of those days look back on real honest-to-good
ness comfort, with a bare minimum of ills thrown
in to make it interesting.
Greatest obstacle in the way of such a plan
would be the necessary funds for such an un
dertaking. Too early in the game to predict
anything, there is a solid hope that maybe some
day the changes will be made.
