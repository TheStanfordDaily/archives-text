# Code Complications

BEFORE coming to Stanford we received a
little red book known as the "frosh bible."
Section Two explained the Honor Code and what
it meant to Farm students. The third line of the
section stated, ". . . the students . . . will not
give) or receive aid in examinations . . ." Being
somewhat naive we took this at its face value;
the fact that violation of this part of the Code
was a not uncommon practice never entered our
mind. ,
On April 9 a letter was published in The Daily
signed by a "practical grad." Although the
"practical grad" seemed to be rather embittered,
he delivered his point in a manner which
showed over four years of Stanford experience;
four years of witnessing what goes on in Room
214 and other places of examination.
Previous to last quarter's final examinations,
a Daily editorial was written dealing with the
cheating problem, the practice of pencil-tapping
as a means of stopping cheating, and the tra
dition of the Honor Code at Stanford. We agree
with the principles of the Honor Code; it is a
fine tradition and one that should be kept. But
when cheating becomes so prevalent that pencil
tapping does absolutely no good, when "talking
turkey" to an individual has to be modified to
include fifteen or twenty individuals, and when
this same cheating means the difference be
tween a C minus and a D plus, then something
should be done.
The Honor Code can work. We have seen it
work in other schools but it has worked only
when the students were willing to keep their
faith with fellow student and faculty.
Stanford freshmen are being forced to swal
low a bitter pill. We have to face reality and
realize that all is not as it should be. The situ
ation must be changed by a rebirth of student
feeling or else the Honor Code as we know it,
the Honor Code which has made the position
of the Stanford student one of the most enviable
in the world, will cease to exist.—B. H.

Stanford freshmen are being forced to swal
low a bitter pill. We have to face reality and
realize that all is not as it should be. The situ
ation must be changed by a rebirth of student
feeling or else the Honor Code as we know it,
the Honor Code which has made the position
of the Stanford student one of the most enviable
in the world, will cease to exist.—B. H.
BEFORE coming to Stanford we received a
little red book known as the "frosh bible."
Section Two explained the Honor Code and what
it meant to Farm students. The third line of the
section stated, ". . . the students . . . will not
give) or receive aid in examinations . . ." Being
somewhat naive we took this at its face value;
the fact that violation of this part of the Code
was a not uncommon practice never entered our
mind. ,
On April 9 a letter was published in The Daily
signed by a "practical grad." Although the
"practical grad" seemed to be rather embittered,
he delivered his point in a manner which
showed over four years of Stanford experience;
four years of witnessing what goes on in Room
214 and other places of examination.
Previous to last quarter's final examinations,
a Daily editorial was written dealing with the
cheating problem, the practice of pencil-tapping
as a means of stopping cheating, and the tra
dition of the Honor Code at Stanford. We agree
with the principles of the Honor Code; it is a
fine tradition and one that should be kept. But
when cheating becomes so prevalent that pencil
tapping does absolutely no good, when "talking
turkey" to an individual has to be modified to
include fifteen or twenty individuals, and when
this same cheating means the difference be
tween a C minus and a D plus, then something
should be done.
The Honor Code can work. We have seen it
work in other schools but it has worked only
when the students were willing to keep their
faith with fellow student and faculty.
