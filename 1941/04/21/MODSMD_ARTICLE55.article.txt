WOMEN'S CONFERENCE, as well as Paris,
New York, and Hollywood, attempts to in
fluence Stanford women in matters of dress, for
this legislative group has formulated some defi
nite suggestions as to clothes and the Farm fe
male. But the style centers see that their dic
tates are made known to everyone.
The only women's clothes policy to appear in
print anywhere is the traditional "long stockings
are always worn on the Quad" injunction given
in the "frosh bible," while the "shorts and
slacks" question is ignored. It is true that most
of the Conference decisions could be better
described as suggestions rather than regulations,

but that is no justification for their being buried
in Conference minutes.
Enlightening the women on these Conference
wishes requires more than a brief announcement
in house meetings, when Hattie Hall or Sally
Sorority is concentrating only on hearing the
boy friend's buzzer. Until the Women's Con
ference clothes hints appear in print for refer
ence, Stanford women will have to be trusted to
rely on their own good taste.â€”P. B.
