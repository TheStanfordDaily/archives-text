# BULL SESSION

jpjRST impression: whatinell am I doing in this
column?
It is very early in the morning. It can be no later
than 9:20. That would not be so early any other day,
but this is Sunday. And 9:30 is a gruesome hour.
The reason that I am awake at this gory time is to
write Bull Session. You laugh and say that that is
no reason at all. Perhaps not, but here I am (getting
duller by the moment). Even earlier this morning I
awoke and read our neighbors' newspaper. They get
up so late on Sunday mornings that I usually have
time to read their paper and to return it without their
notice. I crept out of our room very gently, pausing
only to trip over three or four shoes, a trunk, and two
chairs. My roommates were still sleeping. I do not
think they were sleeping peacefully because curled
up and distorted amongst the sheets and covers and
pillows and things they looked horribly ugly. One of
my roomies, particularly, looked uncomfortable; I
could plainly see that coming home with the "rosy
fingered dawn" (apologies to Virgil) and all its im
plications had done him no good. Down to the En
cina lobby went I, typewriter in hand. It was so early
that the janitors had not yet carried the bodies of a
couple of fifth-floor Encinamen (the legend has it
that they stay up and study straight through Satur
day night) back to their holes (Saroyan, I'll admit
that this is a slight lie). I am now sitting here trying
to writer in "Eulogy to Spring."
Spring is a marvelous time of the year. It jiggles
genes and makes everyone feel light and gay and
happy and romantic. Right now the sky is a radiant
blue. I cannot see a cloud anywhere. The sun is a
bright, warm golden penny up there. The fields around
the campus are filled with good, healthy weeds and
great splotches of a light purple flower and pert, or
ange poppies. The lake will probably be superb today.
Ditto a picnic.
Last night was just as wonderful. The air was
sharp, inspiring. I think almost every star was out.
The setting for almost anything from a drive into the
country to a drive into the country was perfect.
"So what?" may ask the sophisticated senior.
"0.K.? Go on," may jeer the gerrymandering junior.
"Yes?" may even come from the lips of the scin
tillating sophomore.
Well.. .just pity the plight of the poor, earless fresh
man. Roble women are not repulsive. That is, they
could be a lot worse. Encinamen, of course, are the
salt of the earth. But do Robleites and Encinamites
get together? Not much, or not enough, anyway. Why?
No transportation, of course. What happens? Car-fat
upperclassmen walk off with Roble's best. It is the
tragedy of the freshman who only wants to be nor
mally sociable, who only desires a "date" maybe every
week or so.
I'm not a typical example but take me as one, any
way. My winter quarter's experience was four "dates."
(A none-too-miserable average for Encina.) Two were
off-campus, two on-campus. On one off-campus I
"doubled" with another guy. On the second off-cam
pus I sank to ignominy's most ignominious depths and
borrowed, yes, borrowed—a girl's car (BMH I am still
eternally grateful). On the first on-campus I man
aged, after an hour and a half of Herculean labor, to
borrow a Branner automobile. But that fourth "date"
—hallelujah, may its soul rest in peace. After having
everything all "fixed up" I discovered that my car
had flown the coop. From 6:45 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. I ran
the floors of Encina—to no avail. At 9:45, weary and
bx-oken in spirit, I staggered through the winter rain
to Roble to discover—that it was the wrong night.
So please pity the plight of the poor frosh. He is
earnest and sociable and even social if he has half a
chance, particularly in the springtime. And inciden
tally, any stranded Robleites possessing automobiles
need only to call room 245, Encina, between 7 and 7:30
any evening. Service is prompt.
