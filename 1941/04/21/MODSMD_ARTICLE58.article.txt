## INTELLECTUAL HANGOVER 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
"Boy, those Germans can really fight," he ob
served grimly, invading a dividend dinner with panzef
like vigor. "Those babies really do things in a big
way."
"Yup," agreed his companion, "you can't beat the
Germans for efficiency. England hasn't any more
chance than a snowball in hell."
"Well, what can you do against a dictatorship any
way? They give everybody jobs and get what they
need and don't waste so damn much time arguing
about it."
They were two ordinary chaps giving each other
the benefit of their war analysis. And the exchange
of gifts was undoubtedly an equitable one. Each party
gave a trite misconception and was paid in like kind.
But while neither of these barber-shop experts
gained more than the other, neither was robbed less.
And it might be profitable to audit the books with
that thought in mind.
Everyone knows that the Nazi armies have been
brutally successful. But there are simpler and more
accurate ways of explaining that success than the
gullible swallowing of Hitler's lie about a "super race,'
or Goebbel's raving about a "super state."
The fact is that it does not take an army of Wotans
to beat the enemy with more tanks, more airplanes,
and more shells. Nor need we sit hypnotized, like so
many boobies at a side show, and assume that Brit
ish soldiers will not be equally successful if they get
more tanks, more airplanes, and more shells.
But most ridiculous of all is the weird presumption
that Naziism has solved the unemployment problem—
except with homicidal jobs in the army, gun-discip
lined workers' camps, and the magic of the shouted
word. If we have criticisms of our own economy, let
them be intelligently directed toward sound reform—
not toward a travesty of progress that solves its prob
lems by silencing its critics.
Fascism and the war in Greece are bad enough
Let's not add to the damage of Hitler by believing
him.
Sincerely,
Sherman Mellinkoff
