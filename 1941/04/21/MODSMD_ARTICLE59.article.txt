# 'Sea Wolf' Is Strong, Gory Pirate Saga
## 
### 
"THE SEA WOLF,'' Warner Bros.,
now playing at the Stanford The
ater.
In this sixth movie version of Jack
London's masterpiece, Michael Cur
tis directs Edward G. Robinson, John
Garfield, Gene Lockhart, and Ida
Lupino in the portrayal of one of
the goriest and strongest sea sagas
that has come out of Hollywood in
many a moon.
''The Sea Wolf" draws a full
length character sketch of Wolf Lar
sen (Robinson), brutish captain of
a scavenger ship, who has a strange
liking for Milton and takes an ex
cerpt from his poem which Larsen
makes his life's ideal—"Better reign
in Hell, than serve in Heaven."
Chuck full of blood and thunder,
with Ida Lupino thrown in to neu
tralize the acid effects of brawls and
killing, the action starts in San Fran
cisco, with a sailing ship, a soul
less skipper, and a conglomeration
of convicts and adventurers, includ
ing Miss Lupino and a big-time au
thor. The latter is portrayed (and
well) by a newcomer to the screen,
Alexander Knox.
Robinson and Lockhart turn in
their usual strong performances, and
Ida Lupino could hardly go wrong,
carrying the only feminine role of
importance, although her depiction
of an escaped convict is not par
ticularly outstanding.
Good entertainment for anyone
who can stand a man-sized helping
of gore, "The Sea Wolf" is the only
part of the double bill worth seeing.
Its companion piece, "Ellery Queen's
Penthouse," starring Ralph Bellamy,
is just another "who-done-it" mys
tery thriller, complete with corpse in
trunk, missing jewels, and guilty
looking (though innocent) China
men.—Badger
