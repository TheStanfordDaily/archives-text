LONDON, Monday, April 21 (UP).
â€”Bomb-weary Londoners, fearing
a third German aerial blitz in five
nights, flocked into subway shelters
last night in the greatest numbers
since September. But early today
there was no report of Nazi raiders
anywhere in Britain.
The capital had a brief alert in
mid-evening. The all clear sounded
a short time later and it was be
lieved the alarm might have been
false.
Rescue workers, many of whom
had worked almost continuously
since the first great raid Wednesday,
pulled many bodies from new piles
of wreckage yesterday as London
struggled to shake off the effects of
the second full-force assault by
hundreds of German planes Satur
day night.
