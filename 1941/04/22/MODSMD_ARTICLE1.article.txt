UJJUT convoys mean shooting —
and shooting means war."
The old master of the catch phrase,
President Roosevelt, made this
statement a couple of weeks ago.
But neither it nor anything he's said
since has done anything lo clear up
his stand on today's U.S. Bugaboo
No. 1.
The remark is a simple, logical
proposition, and it is certainly valid
in the light of the known facts.
Most Americans agree with the
statement. Darn few of us want to
go to war—and so, we don't want
to convoy.
Just the same, it's a matter of
weeks at the most before the United
States of America must make up its
mind on the convoy question. And
the solution isn't going to be either
simple or pretty. In the last analysis
we have two courses: (1) we go all
the way on what is not yet "all-out"
aid; (2) we might as well give up
any pretense of helping Britain,
concentrate on our own defenses,
and let Britain go down to her own
particular Hell.

British Admiralty reports
gloomily that the Nazi toll of
British supply shipping is averaging
400,000 tons a month. At that rate
the experts agree that England can
not hold out for even one year. On
the other hand, the United States is
breaking its industrial neck to
manufacture supplies vital to Eng
land's survival. What earthly good
are they, if they end up baffling
the fish?
The mind of Adolf Hitler is not an
open book, in spite of the unexpur
gated "Mein Kampf"; leaving no way
of knowing just what a British de
feat would mean to the Americas.
Your opinion is as good as the next
man's on this question—if you both
check the available data. The gamble
must be weighed—and tried—if the
balance tips that way.
And then we have the other
and more immediate gamble. All
out aid. convoys, shooting, and
war. But could we, by taking this
course, win the war for Britain?
It's safe to bet that no one knows
the answer to that one, either.
Assume we back out and Britain
goes down. By so doing we rob
every beaten nation in Europe of
one hope that remains. As long as
there is a free nation in the world—
even though all they gain from it is
moral backing—they will constitute
a potential menace to the autocratic
quasi-feudal Berlin government.
The nation that inflicts unliked gov
ernment, virtual slave labor, and
near-starvation on millions of con
quei'ed people can maintain its rule
for any length of time only if its
victims have no hope. Morale is an
intangible thing—but it's going to be
vital to a beaten Europe.

J JOWEVER. the United States has
another problem on its hands.
Japan has begun its violent anti-
U.S. press attacks again, and reports
from the Orient are placing the date
for things to start popping within
the next month. Japanese residents
are fleeing the Dutch East Indies by
the thousands, and 70,000 Japanese
troops are concentrated on Hainan.
Japan's moves are gauged to
European affairs. One or two
more fiascos like Greece and she'll
climb on the Axis hand-wagon
with alacrity and glad cries. We're
what Japan has to worry about,
since the bulk of the Singapore
fleet is in the Mediterranean.
What if the Germans take Suez
and bottle lip the Asiatic licet?
Britain has guaranteed that the
tough veteran Anzac troops from
Africa and now in Singapore will
take care of the land half of the
battle. The Dutch and United
States fleets will have to do the
sea jobs.
These are only the highlights
among the countless factors we must
consider right now. The ostrich
attitude is out.
The United States is a nation of
poker players . . .
