# 'Husky' Hunt to Show Color Films on Indians for Series
## 
### 
A pictorial study of Indian life in the West will be presented for the
Tuesday Evening Series tonight at o'clock in the auditorium of the
Memorial Hall when "Husky" Hunt shows his color motion picturc, "In
the Land of the Navajo."
Mr. Hunt, who is a member of the faculty of the School of Health, has

spent most of his vacation for the
past 13 years traveling, trading, and
living among the Indians of the
Southwest. Many yeai's have been
required to obtain the motion pic
tures presented in the numerous
studies he has made.
Many thousands of miles by car,
wagon, pack horses, and hiking were
required to obtain these beautiful
pictures. During the past few years
Mr. Hunt has produced "In the Land
of the Navajo," "Pueblo Indians of
the Southwest," "Primitive Pueblos,"
"Rhythm of the Redman," and oth
ers.
STUDIED NAVAJOS
In 1933 Mr. Hunt was a member
of the Rainbow Bridge - Monument
Valley Expedition which spent the
entire summer exploring the most
remote sections of the Navajo In
dian reservation. During March,
1935, he took a party of four down
200 miles of the San Juan-Colorado
Canyons and during the spring va
cation of this year he conducted a
party down the Green and up the
Colorado Canyons. A colored mo
tion picture, "Rainbow Canyons of
the Colorado," was finished during
this trip and soon will be added to
Mr. Hunt's film library.
The Navajo Indian Reservation,
14 million acres, is located at the
four comers of Utah, Arizona, Colo
rado, and New Mexico. On it live
the largest tribe of Indians in the
United States.
With a population of approxi
mately 55,000 they lead a colorful
and primitive existence on vast
stretches of high desert and moun
tain ranging in altitude from 5,000
to 10,000 feet. For a living they de
pend almost entirely on herds of
sheep and goats, agricultural prod
ucts, and a small income from weav
ing, silversmithing, and wages.
DIFFICULT 'SHOTS'
"In the Land of the Navajo" will
be seen colorful views from the most
remote sections of the Navajo In
dian Reservation, showing Monu
ment Valley, Rainbow Bridge, and
Chin Lee Valley. Most of the pic
tures were taken in remote parts,
150 miles from a railway. Some of
the Navajo home and ceremonial
life, weaving, breadmaking, silver
smithing, dances, and others will be
shown.
Some of "Husky's" most interest
ing shots are of the Navajo cere-
monies which are very difficult to
photograph. There are many scenes
showing sand painting, which has to
do with the ceremony of healing,
corn grinding, and others. Of par
ticular interest is a Navajo wedding.
I Hunt has not only had the pleas
ure of showing his pictures to many
! university, school, and club audi
\ ences, but several times has pre
sented his Indian pictures to audi
! ences made up largely of Indians in
some remote places where electricity
! was available. "They love to see
j their own pictures," he said, "and as
la result are helpful in getting me
J good shots."
For this particular occasion a spe
j eial arc projector will be used which
will project (he 16 mm. Kodachrome
| film to the size of 35 mm. Back-
J ground music of Indian songs and
J dancies will be used during the
I showing of the pictures.

Mr. Hunt, who is a member of the faculty of the School of Health, has

spent most of his vacation for the
past 13 years traveling, trading, and
living among the Indians of the
Southwest. Many yeai's have been
required to obtain the motion pic
tures presented in the numerous
studies he has made.
Many thousands of miles by car,
wagon, pack horses, and hiking were
required to obtain these beautiful
pictures. During the past few years
Mr. Hunt has produced "In the Land
of the Navajo," "Pueblo Indians of
the Southwest," "Primitive Pueblos,"
"Rhythm of the Redman," and oth
ers.
STUDIED NAVAJOS
In 1933 Mr. Hunt was a member
of the Rainbow Bridge - Monument
Valley Expedition which spent the
entire summer exploring the most
remote sections of the Navajo In
dian reservation. During March,
1935, he took a party of four down
200 miles of the San Juan-Colorado
Canyons and during the spring va
cation of this year he conducted a
party down the Green and up the
Colorado Canyons. A colored mo
tion picture, "Rainbow Canyons of
the Colorado," was finished during
this trip and soon will be added to
Mr. Hunt's film library.
The Navajo Indian Reservation,
14 million acres, is located at the
four comers of Utah, Arizona, Colo
rado, and New Mexico. On it live
the largest tribe of Indians in the
United States.
With a population of approxi
mately 55,000 they lead a colorful
and primitive existence on vast
stretches of high desert and moun
tain ranging in altitude from 5,000
to 10,000 feet. For a living they de
pend almost entirely on herds of
sheep and goats, agricultural prod
ucts, and a small income from weav
ing, silversmithing, and wages.
DIFFICULT 'SHOTS'
"In the Land of the Navajo" will
be seen colorful views from the most
remote sections of the Navajo In
dian Reservation, showing Monu
ment Valley, Rainbow Bridge, and
Chin Lee Valley. Most of the pic
tures were taken in remote parts,
150 miles from a railway. Some of
the Navajo home and ceremonial
life, weaving, breadmaking, silver
smithing, dances, and others will be
shown.
Some of "Husky's" most interest
ing shots are of the Navajo cere-
monies which are very difficult to
photograph. There are many scenes
showing sand painting, which has to
do with the ceremony of healing,
corn grinding, and others. Of par

DIFFICULT 'SHOTS'
"In the Land of the Navajo" will
be seen colorful views from the most
remote sections of the Navajo In
dian Reservation, showing Monu
ment Valley, Rainbow Bridge, and
Chin Lee Valley. Most of the pic
tures were taken in remote parts,
150 miles from a railway. Some of
the Navajo home and ceremonial
life, weaving, breadmaking, silver
smithing, dances, and others will be
shown.
Some of "Husky's" most interest
ing shots are of the Navajo cere-
monies which are very difficult to
photograph. There are many scenes
showing sand painting, which has to
do with the ceremony of healing,
corn grinding, and others. Of par
ticular interest is a Navajo wedding.
I Hunt has not only had the pleas
ure of showing his pictures to many
! university, school, and club audi
\ ences, but several times has pre
sented his Indian pictures to audi
! ences made up largely of Indians in
some remote places where electricity
! was available. "They love to see
j their own pictures," he said, "and as
la result are helpful in getting me
J good shots."
For this particular occasion a spe
j eial arc projector will be used which
will project (he 16 mm. Kodachrome
| film to the size of 35 mm. Back-
J ground music of Indian songs and
J dancies will be used during the
I showing of the pictures.
