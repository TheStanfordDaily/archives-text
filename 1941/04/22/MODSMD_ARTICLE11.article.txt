# Waiters Enter University Sing
## Friday Is Deadline For Song Entries 
### 
With four days remaining for
sign-ups for Stanford's first an
nual all-University sing, scheduled
for Wednesday evening, May 7, the
turnout has already passed expec
tations, according to Tom Howard,
general chairman of the event.

Greatest surprise to date is the
entry of the Stellar Cellar Singers,
who promise an original group of
typical singing waiter numbers.
Sign-ups will continue in the A. S.
S. U. office through Friday, Howard
said. All groups are requested to
submit a copy of their lyrics when
they register.

Any song, fraternal or otherwise,
is acceptable, provided it is appro
priate to the amphitheater and has
not already been reserved. The en
try fee of $1 per living group will be
used to cover expenses of the sing.

Singing groups must have a mini
mum of 15 members to keep the
competition strictly amateur. Large
perpetual trophies will be awarded
to the best men's and best women's
groups, according to plans made at
the last Rally Committee meeting.

A full moon and several hundred
lighted torches will contribute the
proper atmosphere to the amphi
theater, according to Rally Commit
tee Chairman Bill Kimball. "It's a
great idea and something Stanford
needs," he said, "so let's double the
sign-ups this week."
