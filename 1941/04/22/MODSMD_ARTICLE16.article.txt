# Hat for Millen Troubles Cast Of New Play
## 
### 
Latest problem to stump the di
rectors of the Stanford Players' next
production, "Comedy of Errors," is
that of creating a trick hat which
will take fire and smoke violently
at the appropriate moment in the
play. The Shakespearean comedy,
from which the motion picture "The
Boys from Syracuse" was filmed,
will open Thursday at Memorial
Hall.

The puzzler posed by the hat,
which Hal Millen will wear as Dr.
Pinch, master magician, was solved
by placing a false lower crown, con
taining a smoking chemical, in the
hat. The headpiece is saved from
complete destruction by dousing it
in the waters of a stage-setting
fountain, preventing a large-scale
conflagration and saving the hat for
future scenes.
WIGS FOR TWINS
Facial make-up, duplicate wigs,
and costumes will be used to make
Paul Hosteller and John Lawry,
who portray the Antipholus twins,
as nearly identical as possible. A
greater problem is that of turning
Asher Wilson Winters, the
Dromio slave twins, into doubles.

Brillaint pastel Greco-Roman cos
tumes will give to the comedy the
air of brightness typical of the old
Roman farces. Costumes are styl
ized and are not meant to be au
thentic reproductions, Miss Hazel
Brain, in charge of costume design
ing for the play, points out. Head
dresses have been styled in gold,
copper, and silver since the Roman
women of the period in which the
play is set bleached and dyed their
hair.
DUKE'S COSTUME
Most handsomely dressed charac
ter in the production will be Brown
lee Corrin as the Duke. Corrin will
wear a tunica of a deep red-purple
color befitting his high station. Tra
ditional bright red uniforms will be
worn by the Roman officers, while
the sailors will wear tunicas with
horizontal stripes. Fiery reds typ
ical of the character will attire Pa
tricia Allen as the shrew, Adriana.
Equally appropriate costumes have
been designed by Miss Brain for
Jacques Foley as the courtesan,
Betty Howe as Luciana, Julia Baker
as the mother, and Elena Madison
as Luce.
One colorful set consisting of an
inn, a temple, two private homes, a
seawall, and a fountain, will be the
scene of action for the entire play.
The set was designed by Charles
Vance, the director. James Walters
is in charge of construction.
