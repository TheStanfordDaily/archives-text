(For editorial commcnt on this
movement, see page 4 of this issue
of The Daily.)
Although "a million students at
400 colleges and universities" have
been summoned by the Youth Com
mittee Against War of the Keep
America Out of War Congress to
leave their classes tomorrow at 11
o'clock, Stanford campus leaders are
definitely not in favor of the strike,
The Daily learned yesterday.
Bruce Jessup, retiring A.S.S.U.
president, stated that "the A.S.S.U.
will definitely not sanction any such
movement on the Stanford campus,"
while his newly elected successor,
George Jackson, said, "I am opposed
to the action because of the unfavor
able publicity which would result,
and because I think that it would be
entirely ineffective."
A.S.U., A.Y.C. URGE STRIKE
This strike has also been urged by
the American Student Union, re
cently denied recognition by the
Executive Committee of the Asso
ciated Students of the University of
California, and by the American
Youth Congress, which has also been
attacked as a Communist group.
The organizations calling the strike
claim to be working with Senators
Nye and Wheeler and Norman
Thomas "to demonstrate their oppo
sition to involvement in war."
Claiming that "Youth must strike
now or never! ... It can't be heard
from the middle of No Man's Land,"
they urge mass meetings, parades
and demonstrations, and add a plea
for "all-out defense of democracy
in education,"
CAMPUS SENTIMENT
Campus sentiment last night
seemed to be definitely against Stan
ford participation in any such move
ment, in spite of the fact that the
organization is allied with such
groups as the Young People's Social
ist League and the National Council
of Methodist Youth.

Although Stanford has celebrated
this day as Peace Day in previous
years, a now-defunct World Affairs
Committee was supposed to carry
out the celebration since the present
war started. A.S.S.U. President
Bruce Jessup explained that the
Thomas Mann assembly last month
took the place of the public exercises
oiiginally planned.
