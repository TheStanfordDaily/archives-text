# Women Can't Kiss Beard Growers
## 
### 
Because, as (irey Barbey says,
"II is unbecoming for a Stanford
woman lo kiss a Stanford man,"
winners of the Convalescent Home
Week Beard Growing Contest will
have to suppress their masculine
hopes for this novel prize.
Free tickets to the Back to the
Farm Dance will be offered in
stead for the longest and fanciest
beards.
