The Thomas Welton Ait Gallery
opened its doors last Sunday upon
the famous Mortimer C. Leventritt
Collection of Oriental and Venetian

niversary celebration.
More than 450 persons visited the
gallery between 4 and 7 o'clock
while Mi-. Leventritt, donor of the
collection, received the guests.
The gallery has been completely
transformed to house not only the
rare works of art collected over a
period of 150 years, but an art refer
ence library as well. Each of the
looms has been arranged as a har
monious unit to set off the classical
exhibits
TAPESTRIES SHOWN
Georgian Russian paintings of the
late seventeenth century, showing
the Persian influence of rich color
arid grave form, are located in the
first room along with Chinese paint
ings of the Sung period. There is
ilso a silk Chinese tapestry which is
completely woven and untouched by
paint.
The Oriental Room contains a va
riety of Chinese, Japanese, Siamese,
Cambodian and Tibetan art. The
Chinese collection dates back to ex
amples of prehistoric pottery orna
mented with geometric designs. The
T'ang Dynasty is represented by
several figures, among them a richly
dressed court lady and a well, con
taining a silver luster perfectly pre
served.
BRONZES SHOWN

of small gilt bronzes of the Wei pe
riod. Several cases are devoted to

showing sacrificial vessels and pot
teries.
The Japanese collection includes
a bronze mirror with bells of pre
historic origin. Twelfth century Si
amese Buddhas, heads of stone and
bronze, and paintings are shown in
abundance.
The Venetian Room proves the
wealth and extravagance of eight
eenth century decoration. Among
the more famous paintings located in
it are "View of the Piazetta" by Ma
rieschi, and "Landscape with Ruin"
by Guardi. Priceless sets of Chi
nese porcelain plates are exhibited
in rococo vitrinea, the ducks of Chi
nese Famille rose porcelain are set
on painted Venetian consoles.
WILBUR COMMENTS
Tables and chairs of baroque de
sign which formerly adorned the
Palazzo Labia, and doors, baroque
mirrors and brackets, and cabinets

nello Hanged," and the sketch of a

polo.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur says
cf the collection: "In the universities
we have a constantly changing flow
of wide-awake young people who
are ! hiding out about themselves and
their capacities and who are devel
oping new interests of many sorts.
i ! these students can be exposed to
the very best things in life then there
is a better chance to advance our
culture."
