# Stanford Students Utilize Health Services and Hospitals
## 
### 
j Last year the Men's Health Service took care of 22,000 cases; the
Women's, 13,000. These high figures are not an indication of poor health
at Stanford. Rather, they are a testimonial to the education of Stanford
students in maintaining good health, and a proof that Stanford's medical
services foster this education instead of creating fear of medical attention.

Each student pays for this medical (
attention out of his $15 community
fees, $5 of which goes toward med
ical care. Sixty per cent of the $5
goes to the respective health serv
ices to maintain doctors and nurses
and pay for supplies, etc. The re
maining 40 per cent goes into the
Hospital Fund.
The Hospital Fund is insurance
against illness or accident. It cov
ers all students' ailments that were
non-existent before registration, and
any emergency.
1507 HOSPITALIZED
Last year 1507 people were hos
pitalized under this fund, and many
of them were hospitalized more than
once, some, five or ten times. The
average stay of patients was 4 '/Â£:
days. The institutions occupied un
der the fund are tlie Pali) Alto Hos
pital, the Stanford Lane Hospital,
the Men's and Women's Rest Homes,
and the Isolation Hospital; other
hospitals can be employed if desired
or necessary.
Last year, colds ranked first in
offense, with 72S cases, causing a lons
of 2,273 school days. Stomach aches
were second with HO cases. Next,
in order, were injuries, fatigue, skin
infection, and appendicitis. Forty
seven appendectomies were per
formed. Tv/enty-six students got
poison oak, 13 men and 13 women.
Although figures are not yet avail
able for this year, flu and German
measles will rank highest, accord
ing to Mrs. Yvonne Raffle, public
health nurse.
FEES FROM STUDENTS
The fee paid by the students at
the beginning of each quarter is
sufficient to cover all hospital ex
penses. In fact, there has been
slightly more than enough for the
past few years. This goes into a
special Surplus Fund to meet un
predictable epidemics in the future.
In the past there have been epi
demics which hav( j cost the Hospi
tal Fund $10,000.
Stanford students are fortunate in
the high standards of their medical
services and insurance. According to
Dr. O. N. Anderson, general direc
tor of the Stanford Health Service,
"The organization and benefits pro
vided through the Student Health
Service and Hospital Fund at Stan
ford compare favorably with any in
the United States."
