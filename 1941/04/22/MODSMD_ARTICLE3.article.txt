# British Hope For Minimum Troop Loss
## German Thrust At Gibraltar Rumored; Greek Fall Predicted 
### 
LONDON, April 21 (UP).—(Passed
by British Censor.) —Evacuation of
the British Expeditionary Force
from Greece—possibly with loss of
equipment and men reminiscent of
Dunkcrque—was forecast by foreign
observers tonight amid reports of a
possible German thrust through
Spain at Gibraltar.
Removal of the British troops
from Greece with a minimum loss
was believed the best that can be
expected in the face of overwhelm
ing numerical superiority of Nazi
troops and mechanized equipment.
German claims the Luftwaffe is
destroying and sinking British
troopships already fleeing from
Greece lacked confirmation in Lon
don tonight.
Fear Britain's setback in Greece
may chill American public support
and force the United States govern
ment to foresake any idea of con
voying war supplies was expressed
in authoritative quarters last night
as foreign observers forecast an
evacuation from Greece reminiscent
of Dunkerque.
The German air force hammered
at a southwest coast town with an
intense attack last night and early
today in a renewal of "blockade
bombing" aimed at the port termi
nals of Britain's vital Atlantic
supply lines.
