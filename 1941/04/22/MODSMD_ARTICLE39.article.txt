### CHUCK SMITH 
OTHER YEAR track season
wouldn't hit its peak until some
time late in May or the first part of
June with the running off of the
Pacific Coast Conference and N. C.
A. A. meets when, in Ihe past, the
Cards have been in there pitching
for a victory in sectional and na
tional competition over the con
quering hordes of U.S.C.
But litis year, with track at a
low ebb at Stanford, the high
light ol tlie season will come this
Saturday at 2 o'clock on Edwards
Field up in Berkeley when Indian
meets Bear in the annual Big
Meet.
It will bo the high point of the
season for it will be Stanford's one
chance to come through with a vic
tory against one of the top track
teams in the country. Gran-ted they
will not have a chance against the
might of the Trojans this- year and
that they have too few outstanding
performers to get far in such com
petition as the P.C.C. or the N.CA.A.
but they could beat Cal.
So this is the meet the track men
have been pointing for —the one
victory which could make a rather
shabby 15)41 season a success.

IF YOU'LL JUST bear with an
optimistic spoils editor and his
half a dozen big "IF's" concerning
this coming Big Meet, you can easily
see how Coach Pitch Johnson and
his boys could come through with a
team victory.
First, let's give Cal all those un
deniable first and second places
she deserves on past performances
and potentialities. There's Klem
iner in the 440 and I'm afraid the
220 if he chooses to run it also.
Then there is Barnes in the half
mile, Peters and Summers in the
mile, Dewey and Mclntyre in the
two mile.
In the field events there is Martin
Biles in the javelin (225 feet looks
good to me), Smith in the pole
vault, and Jurkovich in the broad
jump. Give Cal the relay and let's
start in picking the Stanford win
ners and important second-place
men.

f'M TAKING Johnny Giant in the
hundred on his fine performance
against U.C.LA.'s swii'ty Sinclair on
the windy Coliseum track last Sat
urday and giving Don McFarland a
second on the easy 10 flat hundred
he ran last week in practice.
These two Indian sprinters could
pull a repeat performance in the
220 if Klemmer does not run hut
will have to be second and third
if Cal Coach Brutus Hamilton de
cides to double up with his
"sophomore sensation."

Another couple of "IF's"—if Cap
tain Ernie Clark finally reaches the :
shape he was in last year and if j
Blair Hyde recovers from his '
muscle cramp (which he has a fine !
chance of doing in this hot weather) '
these two can fight off the chal- |
lenge of Cal's Froom and Hogan and
nullify Klemmer's first place in the
440 by taking second and third.

And again in the 880 it will he
Hyde this time with the help of the
recuperating Francis Olson or the
improving Kai Larsen who could
sneak in for the second and third
places to balance Barnes' sure win.
Aubrey Seed cught to he count
ed on for thirds in both the mile
and two-mile. In the high hurdles
the Cardinal hurdling twins. Ed
Hertcl and Vern Ilart. should
come thrcugh one-two, while in
the lows Ilertol will have a heck
cf a time heating off the improv
ing Kec.se of Cal, thcugh I think
Ed is enough of a competitor to
he a double winner next Satur
day.

GREY, who has finally come
into his own, deserves a first in
the shot over Cal's Bob Biles and
Indian Bob Millington, on the
strength of his 47-foot put against
the Bruins, can take a third.

WHAT would be the score
if the meet turned out accord
ing to this admittedly optimistic
dope sheet? Why, a Stanford vic
tory to the tune of 68-63. Even if
Klemmer does run the 220 and wins
it. is still an Indian victory by one
point.
Yeh. I admit I'm doing a little
whistling in the dark but it could
be done. Those Cards are deter
mined to make their best showing
of the season against their arch
rivals from across the way. And
wouldn't it be lovely to beat those
guys?
