# Pendergrass Stars as Frosh Nine Bowls Over Cal Team
## 
### 
The frosh baseball team is really rolling this season. This was proved
again last Saturday morning when the Indian youngsters headed by Don
Pen dor grass handed the Cal frosh nine a 1-0 defeat in ten innings.
Pendergrass, of course, is the leading star of the nine. The slight Port
land kid has carved out a name for himself that will no doubt soon become

a legend about Stanford. He has
pitched baseball as few other hurl
ers, either varsity or frosh, have
pitched, and rarely has he allowed
his opponents more than four or five
scattered hits.
VARSITY PROSPECT
The brilliance of Pendergrass,
however, cannot completely out
shine Big Larry Wolf's steady, con
sistent pitching jobs. Larry has
slowly developed over the season
into one of the finest prospects that
Coach Harry Shipkey will send up
to varsity ranks next year and the
big boy's heady plugging may go far
in blazoning his name on the annals
of Stanford baseball. Bill Brubaker,
a latecomer to the frosh, should also
develop with time and work, as
evidenced by the two-hit game the
Bakersfield boy hurled a few days
back.

In addition to the pitchers a steady
infield defense has added much to
Ihe freshman glory. Koch, Ellis,
Pendergrass, and Wolf have all
traded off at the first base position
and all have done creditably. At the
keystone sack little Harry "Horse"
Reichling has played his position
faultlessly, while at shortstop Dick
Middleton has fitted hi well. Third
sacker Ted Nell has also turned in
an excellent job.
SMOOTH INFIELD
The infield has shown itself to bo
one of the smoothest working frosh
defensive machines along the coast,
but it has not the power that many
outfits have. Any lack of infield
power, however, is compensated fot
by the outfield. There Coach Ship
key has gathered a large array of
hitters. Johnny Brooke, Bob Mitch
ell, Bill Hooper, and Colin MacKay
all have shown their worth in the
outer pastures.
Ward Walkup at catcher has also
done a consistent job all season.

Last year 72 per cent of the Farm
voted "No" on the question of
housemothers.

Ihe freshman glory. Koch, Ellis,
Pendergrass, and Wolf have all
traded off at the first base position
and all have done creditably. At the
keystone sack little Harry "Horse"
Reichling has played his position
faultlessly, while at shortstop Dick
Middleton has fitted hi well. Third
sacker Ted Nell has also turned in
an excellent job.
SMOOTH INFIELD
The infield has shown itself to bo
one of the smoothest working frosh
defensive machines along the coast,
but it has not the power that many
outfits have. Any lack of infield
power, however, is compensated fot
by the outfield. There Coach Ship
key has gathered a large array of
hitters. Johnny Brooke, Bob Mitch
ell, Bill Hooper, and Colin MacKay
all have shown their worth in the
outer pastures.
Ward Walkup at catcher has also
done a consistent job all season.

Last year 72 per cent of the Farm
voted "No" on the question of
housemothers.
The frosh baseball team is really rolling this season. This was proved
again last Saturday morning when the Indian youngsters headed by Don
Pen dor grass handed the Cal frosh nine a 1-0 defeat in ten innings.
Pendergrass, of course, is the leading star of the nine. The slight Port
land kid has carved out a name for himself that will no doubt soon become

a legend about Stanford. He has
pitched baseball as few other hurl
ers, either varsity or frosh, have
pitched, and rarely has he allowed
his opponents more than four or five
scattered hits.
VARSITY PROSPECT
The brilliance of Pendergrass,
however, cannot completely out
shine Big Larry Wolf's steady, con
sistent pitching jobs. Larry has
slowly developed over the season
into one of the finest prospects that
Coach Harry Shipkey will send up
to varsity ranks next year and the
big boy's heady plugging may go far
in blazoning his name on the annals
of Stanford baseball. Bill Brubaker,
a latecomer to the frosh, should also
develop with time and work, as
evidenced by the two-hit game the
Bakersfield boy hurled a few days
back.

In addition to the pitchers a steady
infield defense has added much to
Ihe freshman glory. Koch, Ellis,
Pendergrass, and Wolf have all
traded off at the first base position
and all have done creditably. At the
