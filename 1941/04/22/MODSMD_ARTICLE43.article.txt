With an outside chance to defeat
Cal Saturday, the Stanford track
team got down to serious business at
Angell Field yesterday afternoon
minus the services of Blair Hyde
and *Thor Peterson.
Hyde suffered a severe muscle
cramp in his right leg last week and
is limping around the infield. But
the Indians' star middle-distance
man believes he can work it out if
the hot weather continues. Peter
son has a bad foot that will keep
him out of the broad jump pit for a
| while.
Francis (Olie) Olson, just recov
ering from a case of boils, gets into
shape very fast, but Pitch Johnson
isn't counting on the tall 880 man
this week.
