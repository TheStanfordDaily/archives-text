# Varsity Nine to Meet Santa Clara
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity nine gets an- <
other chance at Santa Clara tomor
row afternoon in a double-header
on the Bronco diamond. Last week
the Indians dropped the first game
of the series to the Broncos, 4-1.
Fans are calling the Cards a hard
luck team now, after Saturday's loss
to California. But Stan Griffith's
tenth-inning double play that caught
the tying and winning runs with
none out was for the Bears a nifty
hit of heads-up baseballâ€”for Stan
lord il was hard luck.

Today Coach Harry Wolter is go
ing to stress bunting more than
usual in the batting practice if time
will allow. With such a large squad
as the Indian mentor has, it is dif
ficult for every man to get in his
licks before the afternoon is over.
Pitchers tomorrow will probably
be big Claude Purkitt, out for 1 -
venge for his defeat by Santa Clara,
and Smith, who will desert the
pinch-hit department to hurl.
For the Broncos it will be Left.
Collins, and Ed McFadden.
