ISTANBUL, April 21 (UP).â€”ln
formed Turkish quarters believed
tonight Germany will hurl her Bal
kan blitzkrieg against Turkey with
in the next 8 or 10 weeks, perhaps
as the preliminary to an attack on
Russia.
The feeling was growing among
observers in Istanbul, barely 70
miles from the spearhead of the Ger
man sweep eastward, that a show
down on the enigmatic state of rela
tions between Germany and Russia
is approaching.
Evacuation of this city was con
tinued at a rapid rate.
