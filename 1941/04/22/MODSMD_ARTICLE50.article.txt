# Question and Answer

STRONG answer to a stiff undergraduate
question came over the week-end in the
form of a questionnaire circulated among Stan
ford freshmen in Encina.

Splashed on the front page of today's Daily
is an account of how the frosh male enrollment
reacted to the question of the establishment of
a Naval R.O.T.C. unit on the campus. Circulated
among the dining halls, the petitions brought
back affirmative answers from approximately
half of the registered male freshmen.
Two hundred and five of those questioned
signified that they thought such a unit should
be established. Of this number, 156 indicated
that they would have joined, or attempted to
join, such a unit had it been in effect in autumn
quarter, 1940-41.

Response to the question came in such whole
hearted fashion that apparently there can be no
remaining difficulty in understanding the stu
dent viewpoint on a naval unit for the Farm.
Information from naval headquarters shows
that an enrollment of 85 is necessary for a Naval
R.O.T.C. And over the week-end 156 members
of this year's freshman class signified that they
wanted to join such a unit.

Darned close to twice the necessary number
of enrollees.

Of several problems which remain, only one
presents any major poser. Naval requirements
as to lecture-room, office, and storage space
could easily be met by the University, as could
approximately $500 yearly which would be
granted for miscellaneous expenses.
The question that must be answered satis
factorily is the question of possible conflict with
the army unit now established on the campus.
The now-flourishing army unit quite naturally
finds the idea of competition distasteful. Yet
present enrollment in the army unit—when con
sidered together with the number of this year's
frosh who would have entered naval training,
gives conclusive proof that a university the
size of Stanford can support two training pro
grams.
When the class of '41 entered Stanford, the
choice was one between army training and no
training at all. The present trend of international
and national affairs leads to the all too pregnant
conclusion that future classes will have no
choice whatsoever — unless action this year
gives them the choice between army and navy
training.
We've got to Be able to give them that choice.
