# Dear Ma:
## 
### 
T THOUGHT I should write you a little note
1 to explain yesterday morning's Daily—par
ticularly its color.

To tell you the whole truth about that color,
we had a roll of green left from the Big Game
edition and we thought the frosh would get a
kick out of having their paper distinctive. The
color had no reflection on their ability. (One
grad student I know who goes out a lot wanted
us to print the paper on green every Monday
because it was so much easier on his "Monday
morning eyes." And one of the frosh copyread
ers indignantly demanded, "Who rung in that
pistachio sheet on us?")

But all kidding aside, Ma, they're sure a swell
gang of workers, those freshmen. And they put
out a darned good paper by themselves, con
sidering the experience they have had. Aside
from the few little technicalities that only edit
board or some of our night editors might notice,
I'll bet you and all the kids around here who
read yesterday's issue could hardly tell the dif
ference.

Those by-lines yesterday were all pretty new
to you, Ma, but you watch—they'll be appear
ing more and more often as time goes on.
They've got a lot on the ball and it won't be
long after I get out into the army that theirs are
going to be the names high up in the masthead.
The best part of the whole thing is that they
had a lot of fun putting out the paper without
any of us around telling them what to do, and
we had a lot of fun picnicking while they did
all our work. (You should have seen the sun
burnt noses around the Shack at staff meeting
today.)
The night ed's hounding me for the UP story
so I had better quit.
Edit board has to finish early tonight so we
can go over to the Hoover Libe and carol with
the carillon.—C. B.

the carillon.—C. B.
T THOUGHT I should write you a little note
1 to explain yesterday morning's Daily—par
ticularly its color.

To tell you the whole truth about that color,
we had a roll of green left from the Big Game
edition and we thought the frosh would get a
kick out of having their paper distinctive. The
color had no reflection on their ability. (One
grad student I know who goes out a lot wanted
us to print the paper on green every Monday
because it was so much easier on his "Monday
morning eyes." And one of the frosh copyread
ers indignantly demanded, "Who rung in that
pistachio sheet on us?")

But all kidding aside, Ma, they're sure a swell
gang of workers, those freshmen. And they put
out a darned good paper by themselves, con
sidering the experience they have had. Aside
from the few little technicalities that only edit
board or some of our night editors might notice,
I'll bet you and all the kids around here who
read yesterday's issue could hardly tell the dif
ference.

Those by-lines yesterday were all pretty new
to you, Ma, but you watch—they'll be appear
ing more and more often as time goes on.
They've got a lot on the ball and it won't be
long after I get out into the army that theirs are
going to be the names high up in the masthead.
The best part of the whole thing is that they
had a lot of fun putting out the paper without
any of us around telling them what to do, and
we had a lot of fun picnicking while they did
all our work. (You should have seen the sun
burnt noses around the Shack at staff meeting
today.)
The night ed's hounding me for the UP story
so I had better quit.
Edit board has to finish early tonight so we
can go over to the Hoover Libe and carol with
the carillon.—C. B.
