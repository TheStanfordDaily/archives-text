# We Don't Want None
## 
### 
SOMETIMES when a guy wants something
desperately he's liable to grab at jackstraws
in his efforts to succeed.
A committee of American youth, operating
under the tongue-twisting nom-de-plume of
"Youth Committee Against War of the Keep
America Out of War Congress," seems to be in
that fix.
This group advocates a strike of a million stu
dents at 400 colleges during 11 o'clocks tomor
rowâ€”in a protest against American interven
tion.
The hope against American intervention is
something with which Stanford is in accord.
But Hollywood methods are not a part of the
Farm. Bruce Jessup and George Jackson both
ably expressed that sentiment yesterday.
It's a shame to see a good cause going beg
ging. But until some sane appoach can be de
vised we'll just have to say, "Sorry, brother."
