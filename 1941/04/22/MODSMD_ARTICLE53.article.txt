### JERRY MAYER 
THE GREAT WHITE CHARGER
JgULL SESSION prepared to mount its white
charger the other day.' I was going to take my
place among the great heroes along about the twelfth
century who trudged their weary way to the Holy
Land to make the world safe for something or other.
(I missed this part of my freshman Western Civ
course due to the fact that the little blonde of my
desire sat next to me that day. It would seem that
my presence had little of the same effect on her
that her presence had on me—she took copious notes.
The only interruption to her labor came when she re
quested me to get my face off her notebook.)

But as I was saying, I prepared to mount my great
fiery white steed. I'll admit I had a little trouble be
cause the horse was dancing a spirited polka. But I
borrowed Pierre Monteux for a few minutes and had
him lead the Mountain View Symphony Orchestra in
a slow waltz. When the horse stopped to dip, I
jumped on his back. And there I was, ready to grasp
the world by the horns and drive my point home. Then
I remembered my last great crusade. It was directed
at Mr. Hank Ford. I felt reasonably sure that every
one who owned a Ford and read my column would
hustle right down to Palo Alto and turn their cars in.
The least they could do would be to hustle right down
to Auten's and turn their cars over.

OUT two weeks passed and there seems to be no
glut of Fords on the local used car market. By which
I am led to believe that my column but slightly in
fluenced the local reading public. I might even add
that the word "slightly" is a concession to my pride.
If the truth were known, no one paid any attention
to my column.

So, despite my blast, Mr. Ford is still firmly en
sconced on top of the economic ladder. I thought that
the least Mr. Roosevelt could do would be to remove
Mr. Ford by making him vice-president of the United
States, or something like that. After all, I would have
voted for Mr. Roosevelt if I had not been waylaid at
a local crcamery where they tried to charge me a
penny for an all-day sucker that should never sell
for more than two for a penny. But if Mr. Roose
velt is going to act so aloof to his constituents, then
I'll just act aloof too. I wish someone would pay some
attention to me so I could be aloof.

¥>EMEMBERING my horrible tragedy of the near
past, I dismounted from my white charger and
set him out to graze on pollywogs at the lake. (Did I
neglect to mention that he was a sea horse?) My cru
sade died with a rattle in its throat. Incidentally, it
was my father's baby rattle. We're very sentimental
in my family about rattles. We never give them up
without a fight. I was seventeen years old before I
passed my baby rattle on to my daughter.

I was going to crusade about the road-building
project now going on. But the finance company repos
sessed my roommate's car so it doesn't make any dif
ference to me now how the roads are.

I was going to crusade about coffee in the Union
Cellar. But that seemed sort of silly. In fact, this
whole column seems sort of silly. As soon as I finish
one more lineetaoinshrdluetaoinshrdluetaoinshrdluetao

So, despite my blast, Mr. Ford is still firmly en
sconced on top of the economic ladder. I thought that
the least Mr. Roosevelt could do would be to remove
Mr. Ford by making him vice-president of the United
States, or something like that. After all, I would have
voted for Mr. Roosevelt if I had not been waylaid at
a local crcamery where they tried to charge me a
penny for an all-day sucker that should never sell
for more than two for a penny. But if Mr. Roose
velt is going to act so aloof to his constituents, then
I'll just act aloof too. I wish someone would pay some
attention to me so I could be aloof.

¥>EMEMBERING my horrible tragedy of the near
past, I dismounted from my white charger and
set him out to graze on pollywogs at the lake. (Did I
neglect to mention that he was a sea horse?) My cru

was my father's baby rattle. We're very sentimental
in my family about rattles. We never give them up
without a fight. I was seventeen years old before I
passed my baby rattle on to my daughter.

I was going to crusade about the road-building

century who trudged their weary way to the Holy

The only interruption to her labor came when she re
quested me to get my face off her notebook.)

But as I was saying, I prepared to mount my great
fiery white steed. I'll admit I had a little trouble be
cause the horse was dancing a spirited polka. But I
borrowed Pierre Monteux for a few minutes and had
him lead the Mountain View Symphony Orchestra in
a slow waltz. When the horse stopped to dip, I
jumped on his back. And there I was, ready to grasp
the world by the horns and drive my point home. Then
I remembered my last great crusade. It was directed
at Mr. Hank Ford. I felt reasonably sure that every
one who owned a Ford and read my column would
hustle right down to Palo Alto and turn their cars in.
The least they could do would be to hustle right down
