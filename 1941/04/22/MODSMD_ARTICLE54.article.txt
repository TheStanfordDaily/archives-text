## AN OPEN LETTER TO MISS RICKER 
### 
I live in Lagunita. As you probably know there
is a "Hole" in Lagunita that sells just about every
thing from grapefruit juice to tooth-paste. Last two
quarters and up to a few weeks ago the Hole also
was selling nice red shiny apples.

But now they aren't selling apples any more be
cause it's rumored that there are no good apples in
the market. Now I love apples and the other day I
went down to one of the Palo Alto markets and pur
chased (most inexpensively) six nice hard red shiny
apples. I pecked in several of the other markets and
they also have applesâ€”dozens of them.

Please can't we have apples in the Hole again, Miss
Ricker?
