# Kabloona Tells Story of Life In Northwest
## 
### 
"KABLOONA," by Gontran de
Poncins, on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore. »
The other night at a dinner party,
the talk veered around to the sub
ject of age—how the life span has
been lengthened since the last cen
tury. Once 40 was practically old
age; 50 was; and at 60 all usefulness
had been outlived. Our hostess,
commenting on the technological ad
vances which have so softened the
rigors of nature, said, "You know
the Eskimos in Northern Canada
still have that to contend with, but
there old people face death as the
natural thing. The arctic adds years
to their age, and when they are no
longer able to contribute to the
community, they feel it's quite right
and natural that they should be left
on the ice to face death alone."
Three people spoke, "Youve read
Kabloona?"
FASCINATING BOOK
And that's one of the fascinating
things about this book by a young
French explorer and ethnographer.
It olfers a seemingly inexhaustible
fund of facts about the "little hand
ful of men, cut off from the sur
rounding world by ice-filled seas
and trackless wastes, the Netsilik
miut (Seal Eskimos), which cannot
fail to interest us because of the
contrast they offer to our own so
called civilized lives.
Briefly "Kabloona," which means
white man in Eskimo, is the story
of 15 months in the Far North of
this continent, a land entirely un
trammeled by outside influence, a
land where a temperature of 40 de
grees below zero is the normal
thing. Actually a good part of the
book, as the author says in the fore
word, is the story of the encounter
of two mentalities.
MEN WHO ARE MEN
De Poncin's purpose in leaving
Europe to live in the Arctic was not
that of a "scientist" gathering in
formation about an interesting race,
but to live it to the point that he
could understand it. And though re
peatedly balked in his under
standing by the 20,000 years of evo
lution —or it was more—that sepa
rates the European and the Eskimo,
his book is obviously a valid inter
pretation of the mentality and per
sonality of men who are nothing
more than men.
Beautifully written, in collabora
tion with Lewis Galantiere, the book
abounds in quotable anecdotes ex
emplifying the mind of the Eskimo,
sometimes gory, occasionally re
volting, sometimes rabelasian, but al
ways interesting. Also tremendously
readable are the more philosophical
discussions of the advantages of life
in a country where for six months of
a year daylight is from 11:30 to 1:30.
And I nominate the last two or three
pages of the last chapter, when on
de Poncin's arrival "outside" he
leams of France's war with Ger
many, as the most moving pages of
non-fiction I have read for a long
time.

Sketches and water colors by the
author illustrate the book.—Farrell

longer able to contribute to the
community, they feel it's quite right
and natural that they should be left
on the ice to face death alone."
Three people spoke, "Youve read
Kabloona?"
FASCINATING BOOK
And that's one of the fascinating
things about this book by a young
French explorer and ethnographer.
It olfers a seemingly inexhaustible
fund of facts about the "little hand
ful of men, cut off from the sur
rounding world by ice-filled seas
and trackless wastes, the Netsilik
miut (Seal Eskimos), which cannot
fail to interest us because of the
contrast they offer to our own so
called civilized lives.
Briefly "Kabloona," which means
white man in Eskimo, is the story
of 15 months in the Far North of
this continent, a land entirely un
trammeled by outside influence, a
land where a temperature of 40 de
grees below zero is the normal
thing. Actually a good part of the
book, as the author says in the fore
word, is the story of the encounter
of two mentalities.
MEN WHO ARE MEN
De Poncin's purpose in leaving
Europe to live in the Arctic was not
that of a "scientist" gathering in
formation about an interesting race,
but to live it to the point that he
could understand it. And though re
peatedly balked in his under
standing by the 20,000 years of evo
lution —or it was more—that sepa
rates the European and the Eskimo,
his book is obviously a valid inter
pretation of the mentality and per
sonality of men who are nothing
more than men.
Beautifully written, in collabora
tion with Lewis Galantiere, the book
abounds in quotable anecdotes ex
emplifying the mind of the Eskimo,
sometimes gory, occasionally re
volting, sometimes rabelasian, but al
ways interesting. Also tremendously
readable are the more philosophical
discussions of the advantages of life
in a country where for six months of
a year daylight is from 11:30 to 1:30.
And I nominate the last two or three
pages of the last chapter, when on
de Poncin's arrival "outside" he
leams of France's war with Ger
many, as the most moving pages of
non-fiction I have read for a long
time.

Sketches and water colors by the
author illustrate the book.—Farrell
"KABLOONA," by Gontran de
Poncins, on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore. »
The other night at a dinner party,
the talk veered around to the sub
ject of age—how the life span has
been lengthened since the last cen
tury. Once 40 was practically old
age; 50 was; and at 60 all usefulness
had been outlived. Our hostess,
commenting on the technological ad
vances which have so softened the
rigors of nature, said, "You know
the Eskimos in Northern Canada
still have that to contend with, but
there old people face death as the
natural thing. The arctic adds years
to their age, and when they are no
longer able to contribute to the
community, they feel it's quite right
and natural that they should be left
on the ice to face death alone."
