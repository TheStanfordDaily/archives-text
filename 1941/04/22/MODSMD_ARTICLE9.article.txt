# FROSH FAVOR NAVAL UNIT
## 
### 
Encinamen, to the tune of 205 strong, over the
week-end went on record as emphatically fa
voring the establishment of a Naval R.O.T.C.
unit on the Stanford campus.

Quizzed via a questionnaire sponsored by
The Daily, the freshmen solidly backed a pro
gram over which student leaders have been
pondering for over a month.

Of the 205 frosh who signed the question
naire, signifying that they desired the installa
tion of such a unit, 156 said that they would
have joined the unit had it been in effect this
year.

Seventeen who favored (he unit said they
would not have joined, and 32 did not answer
the question.
QUESTIONS SUBMITTED
The Daily questionnaire was placed before
freshmen last Thursday and Friday at the meal
hours, through the co-operation of Head Spon
sor Bob Dodge and Encina dining room sponsors.

Six questionnaires, each with spaces for 42
signatures, asked the following question:

"With the purpose of discerning the extent of
sentiment behind the establishment of a Naval
R.O.T.C. unit at Stanford, The Daily is distrib
uting these questionnaires. If you favor the
establishment of such a unit, please sign your
name below, together v/ith an indication of your
academic standing. If you would have joined
such a unit should it have been established while
you were a freshman, please write 'yes' behind
your name."
DEGREES OF VEHEMENCE
Many of the frosh were more vehement v/ith
their affirmative answers than their brothers.
"Definitely," "absolutely*. and "unquestionably
yes!" interspersed underlinings and other meth
ods of emphasis.
Prominent among the list of signatures were
those of this and next year's class officers, and
also leading members of the frosh athletic world.
Also in the series of affirmatives tyere the

names of Howard Wright and Howard Vose,
who, together with interested Encina 'sponsors,
started the movement lor a Naval R.O.TG. unit
on campus in autumn quarter of this school
year.

Starting with the circulation of a petition
through Encina, these interested frosh collected
almost a hundred signatures in short order. The
question was then brought before Ex Committee
where it was viewed with tacit approval, sub
ject to further proof that a genuine desire for
such a unit existed on campus.
FACTS UNCOVERED
Since that time, and previous to last week
end's indication of interest from Encina, student
leaders uncovered such facts as:
Only eight more units are to be established
by naval authorities this year; any successful
application must be presented within a few
weeks; 85 enrollees arc the basic requirement.
Excom may again discuss the question at this
evening's meeting.
