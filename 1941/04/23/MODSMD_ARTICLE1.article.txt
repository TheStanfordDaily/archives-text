# History ...1941

/■"REECE is going out in a blaze
of glory and shellfire. Little is
left of the country now and what
does remain is being systematically
bombed to pieces. But they're hold
ing on, prolonging the losing battle,
making it as tough as possible for
the Germans —for just one reason.
In order that the British Expedi
tionary Force will have some
chance of getting out, at least par
tially intact.
Over 2000 years ago a Spartan
named Leonidas and .'joo soldiers
fought to the last man at Ther
mopylae Pass, defending it against
10,000 Persans. Leondas went down
in history, which is cold comfort
when you're dead. But look at the
1941 version of the same battle. For
sheer gallantry it stands out like a
sore thumb in a world which has
forgotten that there can be altruism
in war.
Right at present, according to
the Athens bulletins, there arc still
Anzac troops fighting in the Ther
mopylae sector. liut the linal
rear-guard action will have to he
Greek, and it probably is almost
all Greek now with just enough
British forces to stiffen the lines.
Greece struggled along as a glo
rious memory for a thousand years.
But the memory they'll gain from
this fight will slick too. And God
help the man that tries to kill their
amazing spirit. It is being hinted
that the Greek government will be
moved to Crete, now held by the
British. That's close enough to the
mainland to make loyalist fifth-col
umn activity pretty troublesome.

JN LINE with this attitude of small
nations who have trouble re
membering they've been licked, an
interesting dispatch came from
Stockholm yesterday. It seems that
Germany has been rushing large
"Panzer" forces into northern Nor
way, "either in fear of a British
invasion, or because of an acute
state of German relations with Rus
sia." Those Norwegians are no
toriously unco-operative with the
Quisling government.
One definitely bright spot and
another one that vaguely glim
mered turned up in the picture
yesterday, as the shape of things
to come in the Eastern Mediter
ranean became clearer. The good
thing was the British fleet's vic
ious bombardment of Tripoli, key
base for the Axis' Libyan cam
paign. The "Panzer" drive through
the desert is still at stalemate on
the Egyptian border, and Cairo
sources expect Waveil's counter
attack momentarily.
The glimmer was a report from
Vichy that Francisco Franco, the
Spanish dictator, has refused Hitler's
request to let German troops go
through Spain. Over in London Win
ston Churchill defended Britain's
recent $10,000,000 loan to Spain, on
the grounds that Spain must be kept
out of Axis co-operation (meaning
an attack on Gibraltar) at any cost.
portents point toward a drive
in the Near East just as soon as
the Greek affair is cleaned up. And
Russia must tip her hand in a little
while. With Istanbul reporting Nazi
occupation of the island of Samo
thrace at the mouth of the Darda
nelles, and the German attack on
the British base at Lemnos a few
miles away, it's becoming evident
that oil is what Germany is striking
for, plus control of the Suez Canal.
Turkey will fight with Russian
backing, and conversely she may
not if Russia withdraws her sup
port. Much of the speculation on
U.S.S.R. policy resulting from the
Russo-Japanese pact will be
cleared up when Von Papen re
turns to Ankara to initiate the
final squeeze on the Turks.
With the pro-Axis coup of a few
weeks ago in Iraq, it became nec
essary for Empire reinforcements to
move into the country. The Medi
terranean fleet gets its oil at Haifa,
where the pipe-line from the rich
Mosul oil fields in Iraq hits the sea.
It's one thing England cannot af
ford to lose.
When the blow-up comes in the
Near East the Turks and French
.should move into Syria, thereby an
noying the Vichy government even
more than they have already. Vichy
has been letting lots of those Ger
man "tourists" into Syria lately.

Stockholm yesterday. It seems that
Germany has been rushing large
"Panzer" forces into northern Nor

invasion, or because of an acute
state of German relations with Rus

toriously unco-operative with the
Quisling government.
One definitely bright spot and
another one that vaguely glim

yesterday, as the shape of things

thing was the British fleet's vic

base for the Axis' Libyan cam
paign. The "Panzer" drive through
the desert is still at stalemate on
the Egyptian border, and Cairo

attack momentarily.

Vichy that Francisco Franco, the
Spanish dictator, has refused Hitler's
request to let German troops go

the grounds that Spain must be kept
out of Axis co-operation (meaning
an attack on Gibraltar) at any cost.

Russia must tip her hand in a little

the British base at Lemnos a few
miles away, it's becoming evident
that oil is what Germany is striking
for, plus control of the Suez Canal.
