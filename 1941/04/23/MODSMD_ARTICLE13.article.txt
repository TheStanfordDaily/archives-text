# Cady Changes Title of Show
## Tryouts for Stage Crew Set for Today 
### 
Because Author - director Bud
Cady thinks "How's Your Circula
tion?" would look prettier on post
ers than "Have One on Me," the
title of this year's Spring Show will
be "How's Your Circulation?" from
here on in.
The title announcement was com
bined with Technical Director Pete
Wangenheim's plea for a large crew.
According to Wangenheim he does
n't care if you can't even hammer a
nail correctly, just as long as you
turn up this afternoon between 2 and
6 o'clock in the Memorial Hall
shop. "I am against small select
groups on crews," he said.
DEFENDS ABOUT-FACE
In defending his about-face on the
title Cady said plaintively that he
knew "Have One on Me" sounded
fine, but "it didn't really have a
damn thing to do with the plot. Be
sides," he added, "those posters are
important."
Cady also released the following
additions to the cast yesterday:
Lome Stanley as Freddy; Bob
O'Neill as Muldoon; Ben Miller as
McCorn; Harry Muheim as The
Man in Overalls; Doris Smith as
Cuddles; and Sidney Strieker as
Jiggers, the Cop.
NURSE CHORUS
To the Chorus of Nurses have
been added Sylvia Berry and Edna
Folsom, and to the Office Staff, Rcba
Smith, Carolyn Tyson, Mavis Moore,
Collier Carter, Elena Bruton, Bill
Quinn, Jack Shaw, Art Wells, John
Crellin, and Bob Jones.
All members of the cast are
asked to check the rehearsal schedule
on the bulletin board in the back
hall of Memorial Theater, "and then
turn up on time," Cady announced.
