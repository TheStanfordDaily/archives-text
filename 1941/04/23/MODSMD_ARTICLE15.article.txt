## Professor Hunt Film Depicts Ceremonies On Huge Reservation 
### 
"You all have heard the saying, ;
'He doesn't know the war is over.'
The Navajo Indians are native
Americans who aren't aware that
there is a war," said Professor Er
nest P. Hunt as introduction to his
color film, "In the Land of the Na
vajo," last night at Tuesday Series.
All of the scenes in this picture
were taken in the Monument Val
ley region of the Navajo Indian Res
ervation, which Ls 1500 times as
large as the Stanford campus. The
inhabitants are the most primitive
people in the United States; the
simple life and ceremonies shown
pictorially and described by "Husky"
were taken as they were actually
performed.
"My actors were never tempera
mental; we won their friendship
by giving them candy, while chil
dren were fed salt because the In
dians believe it will make them
grow strong," Hunt told.
HEALING CEREMONY
Highlighting the film was a heal
ing ceremony. The head of the sick
person's family makes all arrange
ments with the medicine man re
garding time and payment. After
an all-day ceremony conducted by
the medicine man, he makes sand
paintings of characters which en
able the gods of cure to enter the
body of the afflicted person.
These sand paintings are brilliant
in hues of red, blue, yellow, black,
and white, and they are ancient
symbols which only the witch-doc
tor can interpret. Each one has a
different specialty; no two doctors
use the same methods for curing.
All of the dyes for the paintings are
made by the women from roots and
bark.
BARTER USED
These people use a barter system
of trading. Scenes of their trading
posts and rituals of barter portrayed
their frugal life; the trips to the
posts are social events which come
only a few times a year. The jour
ney is made on horseback or on
donkeys. Sheep pelts and wool are
traded for cheap flour, baking soda,
and material for clothes; all swap
ping is done by the women.
The woman's place in the home
is that of a man She does all the
butchering and shearing of sheep,
weaving, corn-grinding, and cook
ing. The men -mit occasionally, and
several shots showed them at this
work.
