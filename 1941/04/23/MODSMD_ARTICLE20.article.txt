# Bookstore Display To Feature Ballet
## 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore has a spe
cial window display showing the
original designs which Mrs. Helen
Green, instructor in costume design
in the Stanford drama department,
is doing by request for the San
Francisco Opera Ballet.
Mrs. Green had planned to go to
Mexico this quarter, but postponed
her trip in order to design the cos
tumes for Tschaikowsky's "Swan
Lake" and Delibe's "Copellia,"
which are being given by the Ballet
this week.
