# WOMAN'S HOME COMPANION
## 
### 

THAT'S BUCK BUCHWACH, University of Oregon student who
signed up for a course in "household management" and found himself
a lonely male midst 51 coeds. He stuck it out, gets grades far above
the average and believes home arts should be included in every man's
curriculum. Here Buck waits on two of his fellow students.
