# Yale's Girvan Takes Over Drama Department Post
## 
### 
With the appointment of William M. Girvan to the position of assistant
technical director, the Speech and Drama Division has filled the unwanted
gap left in its stall' when Bill Bassett volunteered for navy duty.
Mr. Girvan, a Yale graduate in drama who has worked in the Wash
ington, D.C., Civic Theater, has stepped right into his iob, and is offering

invaluable assistance in the technical <
work involved in presenting "The
Comedy of Errors," which will be
produced in Memorial Hall for three
nights beginning tomorrow.
When asked his opinion of the
Stanford theater plant, Mr. Girvan
replied, "I'm crazy about it," and
went on to say that compared to
most university theaters, Stanford's
held a leading position. "There's so
much to work with," he said.
Mr. Girvan has found the theater
staff co-operative to work with, his
only difficulties lying in finding out
where everything is, since he stepped
into the job in rather a rush.
In addition to work in Washing
ton, D.C., where he knew F. Cowles
Strickland, Stanford dramatic direc
tor, Mr. Girvan has done work in
summer theaters throughout the
countiy, building most of his talent
around technical work which in
cludes lighting, designing and handi
work in general.
For information about tickets to
the "Comedy of Errors" students
should call Mr. Barker at P.A. 22041.
