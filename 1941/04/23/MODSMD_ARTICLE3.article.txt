# NAZIS ATTACK LEMNOS NEAR DARDANELLES
## 
### 
ISTANBUL, April 22 (UP).â€”Ger
man troops landed from speedboats
have seized the strategic Greek
island of Samothrace at the entrance
to the Dardanelles and have attacked
the British-held island of Lemnos,
25 miles southward, it was reported
reliably today.
German forces, already within 40
miles of the Dardanelles at the
Greek-Turkish frontier in Thrace,
occupied Samothrace as fears spread
here that Adolf Hitler is preparing a
blitzkrieg against Turkey, perhaps
within eight or ten weeks.
The British navy, which some
time ago landed troops on Lemnos,
was said to be preparing to drive
the Germans from Samothrace.
The landing parties presumably
crossed the upper Aegean from Sa
lonika or the Thracian coast of
Greece, perhaps from Kavalla,
which is 60 miles northwest of Sam
othrace.
