# Bill to Liberalize State Speed Limit
## 
### 
The Garrison bill to liberalize the
state's speed laws is making rapid
progress in the California state Sen
ate in Sacramento. Terms of the
bill provide that. 45 miles an hour is
still the state's maximum speed
rate but cars may travel up, to GO
miles an hour on the open highway
in the daylight.
Regarding local traffic conditions,
a red flasher signal is being erected
at the San Antonio road crossing,
one of the danger spots in this sec
tion. The Palo Alio city council
considered a proposed street paving
plan at its meeting last night.
