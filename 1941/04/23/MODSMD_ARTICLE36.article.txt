## 
### 
With (he members of the 1940
Rose Bow! sqund finally coming into
action in full force, Stanford's var
sity football team hit the spring
practice grind in earnest yesterday
afternoon, and with practice sched
uled to end on the 31st of May, will
work out four days per week from
now on in,
Kmetovie, Albert and Company
turned out in full force, missing the
services of the graduating Norm
Standiee, Stan Graff, and Hugh Gal
lameau. The only returning veteran
failing to report was Vic Lindskog,
who has been confined to the hospi
tal for the past week.
Il was discovered that Frankie Al
lien, all-American quarterback, has
been wrong from the start in the
motions that he uses to begin each
play off the "T" formation. Albert
takes the ball from the center with
his left hand over his right. While
showing the system to a new back,
Coach Shaughnessy discovered the
fact, and immediately told Frankie
that the correct way was to place
the right hand on top.
Alter explaining that he had used
the wrong system all last season,
with pretty good results, Albert was
told that it would be all right to
keep it up and not to change.
The practice was marked by the
work of old men and the running of
some of the newer players. "Per
fect Pete" Kmetovie took up his
running where lie left off in the Rose
Eowl, while Albert ran his team
through signal practice with a snap
and verve that has not been seen
since the start of the spring practice
drills. "Hoot" Armstrong ran in at
the right halfback spot and showed
up well, as did Willard Sheller and
Bob Mitchell at the fullback position.
