## CHUCK SMITH, Sports Editor Stanford Baseballers Travel To Santa Clara for Twin Bill 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseballers bit the road for Santa Clara today, ineet
rm| the Broncos in a doubleheader, lirst game starting at 1:15 o'clock.
Mound choices for the Indians are Claude Purkitt and either Iluss Smith
or Cootie Thompson.
Thompson wants to pitch today, but Coach Ilarry Wolter may save

the big right-hander for California'
next Saturday when Stanford and
the Bears clash in the second en
counter of the Big Game series at
Berkeley.
COLLINS IN NIGHTCAP
For Santa Clara Ed McFadden
will probably be the hurling choice
for one game and Lefty Collins
for the nightcap.
Monday down at Westwood the
cellar-riding Bruins outslugged St.
Mary's, 12-10. Yesterday the league
leading Gaels and U.C.L.A. finished
their series with a twin bill but re
sults were not available at press
time. California went big - time
Monday night and defeated Oakland
of the Pacific Coast League.
BUNTING LOOKS GOOD
Wolter sent the boys through their
last batting practice today and the
bunting looked good. Lots of lay
downs rolled right down the baseline
lor perfect sacrifice hits. Saturday a
bunt straight back to the pitcher
helped defeat the Indians as it was
turned into a quick double play.
Though the Cards have no chance
now of copping the CIBA flag, a
split today and two wins over the
Bears would put them up in second
place. *
