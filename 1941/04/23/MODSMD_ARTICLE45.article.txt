# Papooses Outslug Bear Cubs To Win Second Straight, 13-4
## 
### 
Sucking A1 Dotinan for lfi hits, Stanford's frosh sluggers yesterday
afternoon massacred the Cal yearling nine 13-4 in the second game of the
Little Uig Series.
Jim Ellis furnished a large part of the afternoon's fireworks by cli
maxing a six-run third inning with a homer over the left field fence that

sent two men on base home
him.
810 THIRD
The third frame, as a matter of j
fact, accounted for the major por- |
tion of the afternoon's scoring since j
the Cal youngsters put together two
Card errors, a single, and a double
to score their afternoon's quota of i
three runs. The Farm frosh then
came back in the last half of the
third and with five solid hits and
Ellis' wallop fashioned six runs be
fore Cal put anyone out.
Don Pendergrass, the little Port
land youngster who pitched a two- j
hit, 18-strikeout contest to whip
these same Cub% last Saturday, took
care of the hurling chores again
yesterday. Though not quite as ef
fective as he was Saturday morning, j
Don still had more than enough to j
keep the Cal youngsters tamed.
WOLF HURLS
In seven innings Pendergrass scat- '
tered eight hits. Coach Harry Ship
key with an eight-run lead at the i
end of the first half of the seventh
sent in Larry Wolf, who finished up
the game with everything under
control despite the fact that he was
nicked for a run in the eighth.
This afternoon the Farm young- |
sters face San Mateo J.C. on the i
frosh field at 3:30 o'clock.

810 THIRD
The third frame, as a matter of j
fact, accounted for the major por- |
tion of the afternoon's scoring since j
the Cal youngsters put together two
Card errors, a single, and a double
to score their afternoon's quota of i
three runs. The Farm frosh then
came back in the last half of the
third and with five solid hits and
Ellis' wallop fashioned six runs be
fore Cal put anyone out.

land youngster who pitched a two- j
hit, 18-strikeout contest to whip
these same Cub% last Saturday, took
care of the hurling chores again

fective as he was Saturday morning, j
Don still had more than enough to j
keep the Cal youngsters tamed.
