LOS ANGELES, April 22 (UP).â€”
The Saint Mary's baseballers as
sured themselves of at least a tie
for first place in the California In- j
tercollegiate Association contest
when they nosed out the U.C.L.A. i
squad, 1-0. and 9-8, in a double
header here today.
Catcher Mike Cardoza starred for
the Gaels, batting home the winning
runs in both games. In the first
contest he singled home Ted Vogel- j
sang with the deciding tally, and in
the 10-inning nightcap he drove j
home Pitcher Charley Mori.
