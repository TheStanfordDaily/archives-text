IN this swiftly paced world of nowadays, things
generally move much too quickly for one to
settle down and philosophize about you and me
and where we're going.
There's so much to say about the movement
of things around us and the gaiety and unbelief
of just being. But the things we do today too
often cause us to put off the tomorrows and to
forget the yesterdays entirely.
Perhaps we just haven't the time. Or perhaps
it's because we'd much rather live the todays
while we can.

But sometimes when one sees a new machine
for splitting atoms, or reads about the new air
plane that makes time seem like yesterday, one
wonders just what the fuss is all about.
Mechanically we make tremendous strides.
But as far as getting along with our neighbors
is concerned, we're just a bunch of flops.
Ages ago the brothers of the cave-man fam
ily scrapped constantly. And then they finally
learned to make friends. About that time some
one found how to make a raft —so the brothers
sailed into the next valley and massacred the
sons of the family that lived there.
And about the time that the two valleys
learned to live in peace, someone discovered a
village across the plain. And so it began all
over again.
Around and around it goes. We just learn to
live with our neighbors when along comes an
other invention that splits time and distance to
create new neighbors for us.
Something's wrong somewhere. There's too
great a lag between mechanical improvements
and our cultural development. Culture and so
ciety hang about 200 years behind.
One sadly realizes that 200 years of culture
can't be made up in a day. But maybe we could
slash away 200 years' worth of technological
improvement.
