# Stitches in Britches
## 
### 
WHY is it that the United States—that's you—
so frequently refuses to take that stitch in
time which Will save nine?
Or, rephrasing it with as many flowers, why,
instead of stopping the troublesome snowball
before it begins to roll, do we so frequently sit
watching at the foot of the hill until the snow
ball has rolled on and on and on to crushing
proportions? Much effort and expenditure
would be saved by stopping the snowball at its
source—while it is still small and stopaole.
But we don't. An excellent example can be
found in our diplomatic service, which unques
tionably is grossly underpaid in proportion to
the tasks it is performing. So many Americans
deride this service and wish to see it abolished
because, they say, "it is a waste of money which
might be better used elsewhere."
But remember too that if those "waste" diplo
mats postpone a pending war for a day—just
one day—they have initiated a saving which
will more than pay their operating expenses for
many years to come.
Another example? Dr. Morris Fishbein,
spokesman for the American Medical Associa
tion, cited one yesterday. "Where other coun
tries are spending millions for research," he
said, "this country is allotting only tens of thou
sands."

Going a step farther, he presented closer-to
home evidence of America's sluggishness to act
and willingness to bicker in the face of inter
national or domestic crisis when, without
equivocation, he stated that "unless steps are
taken to assure students that the draft will not
interfere with completion of their studies, a
sharp decline in the supply of doctors and
dentists can be expected."
His statement provides food for serious
thought and reconsideration by those Ameri
cans—perhaps some of you readers—who, with
an eye to the end of their respective noses, are
complaining bitterly against the supposed "class
distinction" which the government is consider
ing for medical and engineering students.
"Why," the cry goes up, "should medical stu
dents be handled any differently from me or
the next guy?" #
Through this spokesman, the American Medi
cal Association has called alarming attention to
two stitches which we should take "in time:
(1)a pressing need for more extensive govern
mental subsidization of medical research, and
(2) a just as pressing need for an assured supply
of doctors, which means medical students.
Either we are going to take these suggested
stitches, or some morning we are going to find
ourselves with that revealing rip in the seat
of our trousers.—B. A.
