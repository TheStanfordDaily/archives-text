# BULL SESSION

### JERRY MAYER 
LOVE THY NEIGHBOR
JJULL SESSION just got back from the bridge tour
nament for the benefit of the Convalescent kiddies.
I convoyed (word used in courtesy to Con Home com
mittee) my partner to the Nitery, coaxing him with
pats on the shoulder, cigarettes, promises of home
made cookies, and kicks on a specific portion of the
anatomy.
Just outside the door to the Nitery, my erstwhile
partner balked. With a very neat motion I learned
when I was seventh-string halfback for the lightweight
reserves when I was in high school I drop-kicked
him into the closest seat. Being a very sensible guy,
he decided that he had been predestined to play bridge
that afternoon. He had nothing better to do anyway.
Those two blondes that were at the table had abso
lutely nothing to do with his decision.
"Persons sitting east and west will change tables
after every hand," said somebody who must have been
a committeeman because he was wearing one of those
little tags that says, "Get off the dime and give it to
the kiddies." No one except a committeeman (or
someone who has found one) ever wears one of those
tags.
I caught my partner somewhere in the neighbor
hood of the post office. "I just wanted to see if I
had any mail," he said. Under no duress would he
admit that the two unlovely women at the next table
had anything to do with his sudden curiosity with the
postal situation. As a matter of fact, if the girls hadn't
been sitting behind my back where I couldn't see them,
I would have spotted him 75 yards and beaten him
through my post-box into the inner office. (Of course,
I would have had to take off my coat with the padded
shoulders. I can't quite get through one of those post
boxes when I'm wearing my shoulders.)

'JPHE progress of the tournament was unique indeed.
We got red-hot and won a couple of hands, one of
them by the simple expedient of bidding one on a
sure slam. We made two when a couple of our finesses
worked.
Another time I' sneaked a look at the table ahead
of me to see what they had bid. It had been four
diamonds. This would be a cinch. We moved over to
that table and before I even picked up my hand, I
bid four diamonds. Inasmuch as they had passed that
hand in another direction, we went down ten tricks,
which amounted to 1,476,892 1 /2 points against us. The
half-point was caused when our opponents insisted
that they should have 1,476,893 points, but no one is
going to cheat us.
We also did a little cheating of our own, if it can
be called cheating to lay down a card, wait to see
what your opponent plays, and then pick up your card.
It really couldn't be called cheating inasmuch as I
said, "Excuse me." Of course, that's what I said the
time they caught me carrying the safe out of the
Third Rational Bank in Los Angeles. "Sure," the
night-watchman said, "Can I help you?"

'T'HEN there was the time we walked into a stacked
hand. Our opponents had twelve diamonds and
were cussing because their sorority sister didn't fix
their hand with all the diamonds in it. We also had
a jack, which they didn't like very much.
Just before the last hand, the committeeman, who
by now had three tags on him, announced that the
end was in sight. We decided to go hog-wild. We bid
all the way up to seven, then after our opponents had
taken the first trick we turned over the table, tickled
the little blondes under their chins (they each had
several), and escaped out the window.
"Wait a minute," hollered the committeeman. "I'm
coming with you." We spent the next hour searching
through the bushes for tags that said. "Get ofT the
dime and give it to the kiddies." We couldn't find any
dimes to get off of, so we took a couple of the kiddies
down to Belt's for a milk-shake.

(Linotypcr's Note: Although it wasn't, Mr.
Mayer wishes me to announce that yesterday's
footnote was his idea, lie appeared quite put out
because everyone thought it was not his idea.
I don't think he ever had an idea.)
