HP HE EDITOR, SIR:
It has come to the attention of numerous drivers
about the Campus that there is a new man taking
Burns' place on the police force. With him he has
brought about a new practice, that of giving tickets
during the night time at various places about the
campus.
It is getting so a person can't drive around peace
fully talking to his queen without this demon of the
law snooping along a short distance to the rear. Not
that the practice of dishing out tickets is a major
problem here on Campus as the Men's Council will
testify but why in the heck must this new officer be
so darned conscious of his duties?
We're not a bunch of criminals and for Pete's sake
let's cut this stuff out of screaming up the Row and
around the Halls with his siren and red light making
himself too conspicuous for all concerned.
Yours for more guys like Burns,
Heckled
