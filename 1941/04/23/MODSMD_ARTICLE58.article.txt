# Farm Woman Invades R.O. Training Class
## 
### VASHTI O'DONNELL 
Another Farm woman has invaded
the Held of military training! First
in Military Sciences 5, care and
management of animals, and now in
Military Fundamentals and Military
History and Policy of the United
States. Jane Getz, a Robleite from
Corvallis, Ore., enrolled in both of
these courses this Spring Quarter.
"Because the national defense
program and war crises are contin
ually in the newspapers, I decided
to take these courses which I felt
would give me a background to what
is happening," she said when ques
tioned as to her motives for taking
them.
UNDERSTANDS NOW
"I had no knowledge of military
terms; a left-flank was just part of
a horse to me. Now after three
weeks I can understand what I'm
reading about major military move
ments," she continued.
To enroll in the courses, Jane had
to receive permission from Lieut.-
Col. Harry P. Allen. In describing
her first day in class she said that
she felt embarrassed when so many
men walked in, saw her sitting there,
and asked her if she was in the right
room. "Then when the colonel be
gan his lecture he said, 'Now men,'
and looked at me."
HAS ADVANTAGES
"Military History has its advan
tages. . . . We have been divided
into groups of about ten, there be
ing approximately GO in the class be
sides myself. Each section has to
meet outside of class and study
famous battles. We are going to re
construct the second battle of
Bunker Hill first. Probably in one
of Roble's lobbies. I don't know of
any other place the group I am in
could meet, do you?" she added. "I
really think more women should
take military lecture courses."
Concerning the enrollment of
women in military courses Colonel
Allen stated, "I believe that these
courses will give women an intelli
gent survey of source material and
teach them to read about and inter
pret current events. I don't mind
one or two girls in my class be
cause it is a large one anyway;
however, if a great number would
decide to take it, I doubt if we
could accommodate them."

take military lecture courses."
Concerning the enrollment of
women in military courses Colonel
Allen stated, "I believe that these
courses will give women an intelli
gent survey of source material and
teach them to read about and inter
pret current events. I don't mind
one or two girls in my class be
cause it is a large one anyway;
however, if a great number would
decide to take it, I doubt if we
could accommodate them."
Another Farm woman has invaded
the Held of military training! First
in Military Sciences 5, care and
management of animals, and now in
Military Fundamentals and Military
History and Policy of the United
States. Jane Getz, a Robleite from
Corvallis, Ore., enrolled in both of
these courses this Spring Quarter.
"Because the national defense
program and war crises are contin
ually in the newspapers, I decided
to take these courses which I felt
would give me a background to what
is happening," she said when ques
tioned as to her motives for taking
them.
UNDERSTANDS NOW
"I had no knowledge of military
terms; a left-flank was just part of
a horse to me. Now after three
weeks I can understand what I'm
reading about major military move
ments," she continued.
To enroll in the courses, Jane had
to receive permission from Lieut.-
Col. Harry P. Allen. In describing
her first day in class she said that
she felt embarrassed when so many
men walked in, saw her sitting there,
and asked her if she was in the right
room. "Then when the colonel be
gan his lecture he said, 'Now men,'
and looked at me."
HAS ADVANTAGES
"Military History has its advan
tages. . . . We have been divided
into groups of about ten, there be
ing approximately GO in the class be
sides myself. Each section has to
meet outside of class and study
famous battles. We are going to re
construct the second battle of
Bunker Hill first. Probably in one
of Roble's lobbies. I don't know of
any other place the group I am in
could meet, do you?" she added. "I
