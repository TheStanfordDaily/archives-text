# Stanford Dings Student Strike
## 
### 
With Stanford campus opinion ap
parently definitely against the pro
posal, it seems certain that there will
be no campus demonstration of the
nation-wide "student strike" sched
uled for this morning at 11 o'clock.
Pat Adams, recently elected A.S.S.U.
vice-president, said last night to
The Daily, "I feel that there is no
place for such an action on the
Stanford Campus."
Leaders of the movement to gain
Stanford students' signatures on the
petition to be sent to President Roo
sevelt and the members of Congress
said that they did not feel that a
strike action was necessary, but that
the petitions were circulated merely
to allow mem'oers of the student
body to express their true feelings
against war.
New angles to the strike situation
appeared to be the fact that the
groups sponsoring the action are also
demanding "more NYA for more
students," and were demanding that
faculties of colleges and universities
throughout the country clean out
their closets and remove all avowed
and suspected members of the Com
munist party and any of the other
so-called subversive groups.
One factor in the Stanford stu
dent diffidence toward the move
ment as a whole appears to be the
recent speech delivered by Senator
Gerald P. Nye in Palo Alto. As one
student expressed it, "I heard Sen
ator Nye, and think that he has
some good ideas, but 1 also think
that he is over-zealous in trying to
carry them out."
In view of the fact that A.S.S.U.
President stated yesterday that there
would be no official recognition
given to the movement, it was not
expected that there would be any
Excom action on the subject at last
night's meeting.
