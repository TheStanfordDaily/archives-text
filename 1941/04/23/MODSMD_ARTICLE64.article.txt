# Lomita Drive Will Reopen in June
## 
### 
After six days of construction, i
Lomita Drive still has over six
weeks' work to be done on it before
it will be ready for automobile traf
fic. The total cost of the project, ac
cording to I. W. Halbert, construc
tion foreman, will approximate
$25,000.
The 3,000 square yards of earth
that eventually are to be moved
will fill in the site of the present
Lomita Drive. This area will be
planted with foliage and shrubbery,
which will greatly enhance the
beauty of the west side of the
! Quad.
The drive will be GO feet wide, and
there will probably be diagonal
parking on it. The length of Lomita,
excluding the extension onto Santa
Teresa, is about 2000 feet.
