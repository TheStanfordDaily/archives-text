# Turner Reports to Excom On Conference with F.D.R.
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Although he remained impartially "on the fence," Bill Turner impressed
a suddenly solemn Ex Committee last night with the determined senti
ment which he observed during the last two weeks in the East for aid to
Britain, and reiterated his earlier conviction that the United States will
be in the world conflict, at least by convoying, within the next two months.

Turner, Student Defense CounciM
head and one of five college stu
dents in the nation chosen to confer
with President Roosevelt and Mrs.
Kermit Roosevelt for the Young
America Wants to Help mission, de
clared he feels there is an urgent
need of giving aid to "the suffering
people in Britain," but doubted
whether such a program should be
attempted immediately on the Farm.
Norm Ross was appointed next
September's Frosh Pre-Reg pro
gram chairman, and action on trans
fer orientation chairman appoint
ment was deferred until next Tues
day.
"I recommend we go ahead in re
lief work for the British and if we
can't do it this quarter that we do it
fall quarter," Turner said.
Then, grimly, Ross Anderson said,
"Yes, but by fall quarter it may be
too late."
Turner commented he sensed a
greater feeling of concern in the
East than in the West.
Asked what help Stanford might
undertake, he suggested a drive for
$1,000 to provide a mobile kitchen
and he would advocate a "Sacrifice
Day," when Stanfordites would give
up a package of cigarettes or a
malt.
