It is curious to note that in the original Minute Book
of the Board of Directors, there is no entry between
March 8, 1906 and May 4 of that year. That is because
on April 18, a little more than a month after the store
had moved info its new quarters, there occurred the Great
Earthquake Disaster. While Stanford University suffered
tremendous damage, the new bookstore building stood
the shocks exceedingly well. The outer walls cracked and
much plaster fell, but service was uninterrupted. In the
minutes of the Board of Directors the first intimation that
we have of the disaster was that damage to the Stanford
Bookstore amounted to the sum of $4500.

It is curious to note that in the original Minute Book
of the Board of Directors, there is no entry between
March 8, 1906 and May 4 of that year. That is because
on April 18, a little more than a month after the store
had moved info its new quarters, there occurred the Great
Earthquake Disaster. While Stanford University suffered
tremendous damage, the new bookstore building stood
the shocks exceedingly well. The outer walls cracked and
much plaster fell, but service was uninterrupted. In the
minutes of the Board of Directors the first intimation that
we have of the disaster was that damage to the Stanford
Bookstore amounted to the sum of $4500.
