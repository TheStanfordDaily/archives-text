lUST about all the British can hope
for in the evacuation of Greece is
a "second Dunkerque." Dunkerque
was a terrible defeat, but it was also
a miracle—a miracle in that the ma
jor part of the British Army of
Flanders, though completely cut of!
and surrounded, got out and es
caped more or less intact to the
British Isles.
Greece is another defeat, and con
sidering the facts, it'll be an even
greater miracle if the British can get
the major part of their exhausted
forces over to Crete and Alexandria.
It is probable that no one will know
how well they are succeeding for a
few days. And from where we stand
it looks like the cards are stacked
against them.
In the first place, the Greek
ports which must be used for em
barkation (Piraeus, Attica, Sala
mis, and Megara) were not even
adequate for the landing of Brit
ish supplies. Ships in the harbor
at Piraeus, port of Athens, had to
be parked by hawsers. Dunkerque
had far better facilities.
But even more important is the
fact that Germany has complete
command of the air over Greece. It
was the RA.F. which was, in the
last analysis, responsible for the
"miracle" of Dunkerque; althoiudi it
was not superior, it was at least
equal to the Nazis.

r J 1 HE first major crisis between Lon
don and the dominions boiled up
yesterday as the outcome of the
Greek affair became evident. Aus
tralia is angry because her troops
have been bearing the brunt of the
war both in Africa and in Greece.
She probably doesn't mind Africa
so much, but Australian laborites are
right when they assert that their men
were sent into Greece without ade
quate support. In London, too, the
newspapers are expressing sharp
criticism of Anthony Eden, who "ce
mented" the Greek-Turkish front.
You can lay money, however, that
the Italian reports of a new govern
ment under famed World War I
battle-axe, Lloyd George, are pure
wish-thinking.
The most interesting event of
the day, from the long-run view
point, was the German occupation
of the island of Lenuios off the
Dardanelles. This taken in con
junction with the unconfirmed,
but logical. London report that
Germany has demanded that
Turkey surrender complete mili
tary control of the Dardanelles
and Bosporus, can turn into ex
tremely had news for the English
—who have been taking bad news
past the saturation point lately.
Most likely the British garrison at
Lemnos was a skeleton force. But
take a look at a map of the eastern
Mediterranean and you will see that
skeleton force or no, the Germans
had better not be allowed to take
any more of those Aegean isalnds.
down the Turkish
coast from Samothrace and
Lemnos (already German) are Les
bos, Chios, Samos, and Nicaria. The
last two are practically within a
stone's toss of the Italian Dodeca
nese Islands. Axis forces in posses
sion of this chain would not only
flank Greece, they'd be painfully
close to British-held Crete.
Cunningham's Mediterranean fleet
has enough on Its hands keeping
further Axis supplies from getting
into Africa, without trying to hold
these islands, too. But Suez is the
key point.
Turkish aid would be cut to the
bone, in the event she were flanked,
and Britain needs all the support
she can get.
If it is true that Berlin-Moscow
relations are "strained" because
Germany has refused to a joint
Soviet-German occupation of the
Dardanelles, the recent German
troop concentrations in Norway
could be explained as the result
of Hitler's fear of an open break
with Russia.
This little straw in the wind is
something all good lovers of democ
racy had better pray for. It's clear
that Stalin is becoming more and
more displeased with Hitler's drive
into his baliwick, but the Soviets
are plenty scared of an out-and-out
war with the invincible Reich. Every
move they've made since September
1939 indicates that.
