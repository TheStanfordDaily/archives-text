# Spring Is Here-Campus Sneezes
## 
### 
If it isn't flu, the measles, or a
rainy-weather cold, it's hay fever,
judging by reports from the health
service. Yes, spring is here with
blue skies, sunshine, Lake Lagunita
full, dances every week-end, and pic
nics if the picnickers arc not allergic
to the grasses growing on and
around the Farm.
This is the very height of the hay
fever season if one is allergic to
spring pollens. Grasses which arc
in bloom this time of year and pol
lens from spring flowers are enough
to cause hay fever victims to weep.
The plants which are the worst of
fenders arc June grass, olive trees,
and acacia.
Over two dozen cases have been
treated through the women's health
service. But that isn't counting the
dozens of sufferers who weep and
blow their noses through classes day
after day.
