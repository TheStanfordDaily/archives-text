# 'CLUTCHING HAND' GRABS A.T.
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Annie Townsend has been snared
by The Clutching Hand.
Sweet, demure, little A.T., the
Farm's own little vice-president!
Slowly, grimly, it has cast its shadow
j over her girlish countenance.
But I'm from Missouri.
Even when Annie sidled up to me
in that spring print—even when she
seared my soul with those searching
eyes—l told her I couldn't believe it.
I'd have to see it first. Seein' is be
lievin', Annie.
The Clutching Hand! Absurd,
i Why, Annie, this is 1941 on our own
Farm. Those things just don't hap
! pen.
Annie pouted. Then, when Dim
ples saw she wasn't getting any
i where that way, she flashed those
chestnut eyes in a disarming smile

I and told me she could prove it.
We made a date for next Sunday
i night, yea, a tryst with The Clutch
; ing Hand. Just Annie Townsend and
I and The Clutching Hand.
The Clutching Hand and I will
show up this guy Bruce Jessup.
What's he got that The Clutching
! Hand and I haven't got?
Which brings me to my point:
What's The Clutching Hand got
that Jessup and I haven't got?
Being a right guy, and I'm sure
! A.T. won't mind, I'm going to ask
1 for 500 volunteers to accompany us
i on our eerie rendezvous to find out.
| Five hundred ought to do it.
You don't have to go far—no gaso
| line worries, no driving against
; lockouts, no sleepy hours on the
i foggy Bayshore — just meet us in
j front of the Education Audtorium.
Say about 7:15 Sunday night? And
by the way, bring a little small
1 change with you, about 15 cents; I
| may need a loan. Bribery, you
| know—we've got to handle this
J thing.
According to Anne, the gal who
I has brought this peril to Stanford,
! the first Sunday night movie will be
"The Little Finger of The Clutch-
I ing Hand."
Explaining her new passion, she
I said, "We couldn't get 'Aesop's
Bring 'Em Back Half Shot,' so we
settled for The Clutching Hand."
Besides the serial, there'll be "The
Count of Monte Cristo" and a car
toon.
Bring 'em back, Annie.

in that spring print—even when she
seared my soul with those searching
eyes—l told her I couldn't believe it.
I'd have to see it first. Seein' is be
lievin', Annie.
The Clutching Hand! Absurd,
i Why, Annie, this is 1941 on our own
Farm. Those things just don't hap
! pen.
Annie pouted. Then, when Dim
ples saw she wasn't getting any
i where that way, she flashed those
chestnut eyes in a disarming smile

I and told me she could prove it.
We made a date for next Sunday
i night, yea, a tryst with The Clutch
; ing Hand. Just Annie Townsend and
I and The Clutching Hand.
The Clutching Hand and I will
show up this guy Bruce Jessup.
What's he got that The Clutching
! Hand and I haven't got?
Which brings me to my point:
What's The Clutching Hand got
that Jessup and I haven't got?
Being a right guy, and I'm sure
! A.T. won't mind, I'm going to ask
1 for 500 volunteers to accompany us
i on our eerie rendezvous to find out.
| Five hundred ought to do it.
You don't have to go far—no gaso
| line worries, no driving against
; lockouts, no sleepy hours on the
i foggy Bayshore — just meet us in
j front of the Education Audtorium.
Say about 7:15 Sunday night? And
by the way, bring a little small
1 change with you, about 15 cents; I
| may need a loan. Bribery, you
| know—we've got to handle this
J thing.
According to Anne, the gal who
I has brought this peril to Stanford,
! the first Sunday night movie will be
"The Little Finger of The Clutch-
I ing Hand."
Explaining her new passion, she
I said, "We couldn't get 'Aesop's
Bring 'Em Back Half Shot,' so we
settled for The Clutching Hand."
Besides the serial, there'll be "The
Count of Monte Cristo" and a car
toon.
Bring 'em back, Annie.
I and told me she could prove it.

Annie Townsend has been snared
by The Clutching Hand.
Sweet, demure, little A.T., the
Farm's own little vice-president!
Slowly, grimly, it has cast its shadow
j over her girlish countenance.
But I'm from Missouri.
