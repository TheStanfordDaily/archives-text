# 'CLUTCHING HAND' GRABS A.T.
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Annie Townsend has been snared
by The Clutching Hand.
Sweet, demure, little A.T., the
Farm's own little vice-president!
Slowly, grimly, it has cast its shadow
j over her girlish countenance.
But I'm from Missouri.
Even when Annie sidled up to me
in that spring print—even when she
seared my soul with those searching
eyes—l told her I couldn't believe it.
I'd have to see it first. Seein' is be
lievin', Annie.
The Clutching Hand! Absurd,
i Why, Annie, this is 1941 on our own
Farm. Those things just don't hap
! pen.
Annie pouted. Then, when Dim
ples saw she wasn't getting any
i where that way, she flashed those
chestnut eyes in a disarming smile
