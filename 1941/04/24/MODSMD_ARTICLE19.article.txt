# Ghosts of 90's To Haunt Farm
## Costumes to Revive Early Era Tomorrow 
### HARRIET FISHER 
Like ghosts of the 500 and the
rough returned to haunt the Quad,
women and men alike will blossom
out in costumes of the pre-war era
tomorrow for Stanford's second an
nual Back to the Farm Day.
As a climax to the Convalescent
Home Drive, the day will be devoted
to regaining the atmosphere of Stan
ford 50 years ago. Since no cars
will be allowed on campus, the bi
cycles, rigs, and horse-and-buggies
of the Farm's early days will appear
again.
OLD-FASHIONED COSTUMES
Costumes for women will range
from old-fashioned bathing suits
with long black stockings and gym
suits with middy collars to the trail
ing skirts, shirtwaists, and big hair
ribbons of the days of students' par
ents and even grandparents. Long
hair will be in style for one day
as women augment their own short
bobs with tcn-cent-store switches.
For men, there will be peg-topped
trousers, checkered jackets, spats,
straw hats, handle-bar mustaches,
and center-part hair styles. Some
will come as bar-tenders, some as
dandies, some as just plain roughs.
RUKAL OUTFITS PLANNED
Those who take the Back to the
Farm idea literally are planning to
appear in jeans with ragged shirts,
coveralls, wash dresses, false braids
tied with ribbons. No doubt there
will be a general outcropping of
pencilled freckles and farm-tanned
complexions.
In keeping with the informality of
the celebration, living groups all
over the campus will be open for
luncheon to those who wish to ex
change.
