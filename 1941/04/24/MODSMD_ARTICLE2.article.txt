# War in Balkans Nearing End as Main Greek Army Trapped; Athens Perilled
## Nazis Batter Through Thermopylae, Bomb British Evacuation Ships; Greek King, Defiant, Flees to Crete 
### United Press 
The war in Greece appeared Wednesday night to he near its end, re
sulting in another resounding German victory in the blitzkrieg pattern.
And it appeared to he ending in another British disaster, possibly sur
passing that of Dunkerque.
The ironclad German tide from the north approachcd Athens; the

Greek king and government had<
fled; the main Greek army of Epirus,
250,000 to 1300,000 men, had surren
dered; the British expeditionary
force, fighting a rear guard action,
was scrambling to escape.
"The war in Greece can be con
sidered as practically at an end," a
German spokesman said. "At any
hour we may have news that our
troops have entered Athens, because
there is nothing to stand in their
way now."
LAST DESPERATE STAND
The Greek and British claims,
though less blunt, were scarcely less
pessimistic from the Allied stand
pont. Athens said the British and
Greek troops were making a last
desperate stand north of Athens.
More than 1200 German tanks, hun
dreds of dive-bombers and hordes
of infantry bore down on the
Allied line around Thermopylae
Pass and battered through.
British military headquarters said
that the line of resistance, although
hard pressed, still was unbroken and
imperial forces were consolidating
"new positions."
GREEK PORTS BLASTED
Swarms of German bombers
blasted at Greek ports and waiting
ships in Piraeus, Attica, Salamis,
and Megara, causing "considerable
damage to ships and harbor installa
tions," the Greeks said. The German
version of the same situation was
that the British were being slaugh
tered as they struggled to get out
of Greece.
King George and his government
fled by ship 60 miles south to the
Greek island of Crete, where the
monarch pledged himself and his
people to "fight on until final vic
tory." He said the suxrender of the
main Greek army was unauthorized.
70,000 NAZIS KILLED
Istanbul reports said the Germans
had suffered 270,000 casualties in
Greece, including 70,000 dead. They
said travelers from Rumania told of
Bucharest hospitals filled to capacity
and private homes requisitioned to
care for the Nazi wounded.
In London, King George and Prime
Minister Winston Churchill held a
long conference, while the people
began to get an idea that their
forces had taken a beating in Greece
and "might" try to get out. They
knew that Britain's army of the
Balkans was fighting with its back
to the sea and its left flank unpro
tected; that disaster or another
"miracle of Dunkerque" appeared to
be their lot.

Istanbul reports said the Germans
had suffered 270,000 casualties in
Greece, including 70,000 dead. They
said travelers from Rumania told of
Bucharest hospitals filled to capacity
and private homes requisitioned to
care for the Nazi wounded.
In London, King George and Prime
Minister Winston Churchill held a
long conference, while the people
began to get an idea that their
forces had taken a beating in Greece
and "might" try to get out. They
knew that Britain's army of the
Balkans was fighting with its back
to the sea and its left flank unpro
tected; that disaster or another
"miracle of Dunkerque" appeared to
be their lot.
The war in Greece appeared Wednesday night to he near its end, re
sulting in another resounding German victory in the blitzkrieg pattern.
And it appeared to he ending in another British disaster, possibly sur
passing that of Dunkerque.
The ironclad German tide from the north approachcd Athens; the

Greek king and government had<
fled; the main Greek army of Epirus,
250,000 to 1300,000 men, had surren
dered; the British expeditionary
force, fighting a rear guard action,
was scrambling to escape.
"The war in Greece can be con
sidered as practically at an end," a
German spokesman said. "At any
hour we may have news that our
troops have entered Athens, because
there is nothing to stand in their
way now."
LAST DESPERATE STAND
The Greek and British claims,
though less blunt, were scarcely less
pessimistic from the Allied stand
pont. Athens said the British and
Greek troops were making a last
desperate stand north of Athens.
More than 1200 German tanks, hun
dreds of dive-bombers and hordes
of infantry bore down on the
Allied line around Thermopylae
Pass and battered through.
British military headquarters said
that the line of resistance, although
hard pressed, still was unbroken and
imperial forces were consolidating
"new positions."
GREEK PORTS BLASTED
Swarms of German bombers
blasted at Greek ports and waiting
ships in Piraeus, Attica, Salamis,
and Megara, causing "considerable
damage to ships and harbor installa
tions," the Greeks said. The German
version of the same situation was
that the British were being slaugh
tered as they struggled to get out
of Greece.
King George and his government
fled by ship 60 miles south to the
Greek island of Crete, where the
monarch pledged himself and his
people to "fight on until final vic
tory." He said the suxrender of the
main Greek army was unauthorized.
