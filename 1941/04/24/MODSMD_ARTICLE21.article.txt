# Today: Work, Barbecue, Jollyup
## All Students To Shoulder Light Labor Farm Eating Groups Close for Supper, Dine at Con Home 
### 
Break out your work clothes and
move with the campus over to the
Convalescent Home. Today is Labor
Day, and a light round of grass-cut
ting or an equally easy task will be
gin for all students at the Home at
1:30.
"It's not really work," Chairman
Ray Durham said last night. "Ev
erybody just pitches in together, and
in one afternoon we accomplish
enough to save the Home a great
deal of overhead expense."

Work stops at 4:30, in order that
the students may clean up in time
for the barbecue supper of lamb,
beans, rolls, ice cream and coffee to
get under way at 5. Sam McDonald,
head grounds keeper, will do the
honors at the barbecue pit.
No supper will be served at any
campus eating groups.
During the supper, entertainment
will be presented under the chair
maning of Patty Bouchard. "It's go
ing to be a swell afternoon, and your
one chance to help the Home with
out paying any money," Durham
added.
Following the barbecue the cam
pus will move to the Women's Gym
for the Labor Day jolly-up which
lasts from 7 to 8.
Tabulation of last Tuesday's Con
Home golf tournament show a four

bracket, Hardin Stephens and John
Wilson tied with 64 apiece. Twenty
five played in the tournament, this
number topping last year's total by
five players.
