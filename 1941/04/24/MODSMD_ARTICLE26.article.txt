## Farm Team Defeats Cal Joffre Winners 
### 
Scoring a comeback victory for j
Stanford over the California team |
of Ralph Kramer and Mary Griffin, |
who took first and second places in j
the Joffre debate last week, Roger
Boas and Maurice Knox yesterday !
won the intercollegiate Common- I
wealth Club debate unanimously.
A silver-bronze plaque engraved j
with the names of the victors will
be presented to Stanford by the
club. This is the fifth plaque Stan
ford has won in the past six years.
The question for the debate, which
was held at the Palace Hotel as the
program for the annual Common
wealth Club luncheon, was "Re
solved, that if the British should
fall, it will, within two years, be
militarily feasible for the Axis to
conquer the United States." Stan
ford took the negative.
Yesterday's debate was the re
newal of a rivalry between the two
schools which was discontinued five !
years ago because of a California \
debate ruling against decisionj
events. Stanford has been debating j
against U.C.L.A. during the inter
vening years.
The three judges who gave Stan- 1
ford a unanimous vote were chosen j
from a list of ten Commonwealth j
Club members by committees from
both schools.
