## 
### 
Lieu tenant-Colonel Harry B. Al
len, professor of Military Science and
Tactics and head of Stanford's R. 0.-
T.C. field artillery unit, last night
voiced the opinion that the Naval
R.O.T.C. unit recently proposed for
the Stanford campus would be rath
er impractical.
"With enrollment on a voluntary
basis, and with only approximately
550 frosh to draw from in the first
place, I am afraid that the compe
tition for the new men would re
solve into a cutthroat proposition,"
Colonel Allen stated to The Daily
last night, going on to point out the
fact that some of the 50 freshmen
would not be able to enroll in either
army or navy units because of color
blindness and other minor physical
defects.
Recent campus elation over the
fact that a Daily poll showed an
overwhelming majority of frosh men
in favor of the naval .program at
Stanford is premature, according to
another source contacted last night.
Voluntary units are apportioned
after conference between the War
and Navy departments in Washing
ton, and the chances are that a new
field would be taken rather than to
change over organizations in an al
ready well-established unit.
"The War and Navy departments
decide on where the units are to go
in accordance with the desires of
each particular institution and the
needs for a certain number of offi
cers in each branch of the service,"
stated Colonel Allen, showing that
the units are apportioned according
to the national defense needs of each
of the military departments of the
government.
