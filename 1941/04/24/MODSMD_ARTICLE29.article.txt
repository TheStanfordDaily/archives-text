# Varsity Nine Splits Pair With Broncs
## 
### 
Down at Santa Clara yesterday
Stanford won one and lost one—
Cootie Thompson clouted two ho
mers and a brace of doubles, adding
to his mound mastery over the Bron
cos in the first game. The Indians
rang up 12 hits to win the opener,
fc-3.
The nightcap went to Santa Clara
after Claude Purkitt had left the
game after six innings with a like
number of runs scored off him—all
unearned. Bill Masters finished the
last three innings, and the winning
run w;is tallied off him, linal score,
7-(i.
Stanford maintained complete con
trol in the first game, and third-
Backer Elton Boone bumped him
j-elf out of a batting slump with
three singles in five tries. Thompson
let the Broncos down with nine safe
ties, while the Indians nicked Lefty
Collins for 12.
(EVEN - STEPHEN
The Cardinals stayed even all the
way along in the second game, los
ing in the ninth inning. In the first
half of the final canto, Hal Costello
singled but Ray Hammott, failing
for the first lime in four tries to get
a hit, grounded into a double play.
Ray coUected three singles in his
first three times at bat.
In the last half of the ninth Santa
Clara scored on an infield hit, a
sacrifice, and a one-bagger that put
the winning run across.
Stanford outhit Santa Clara but
fielding fell apart at inopportune
moments, and, from a Farm spec
tator's viewpoint, some close plays
looked like "home town decisions."
RANDALL CATCHES
Jack IJandall worked behind the
plate in the first game and caught
six innings of the second, Herb At
kinson finishing. Boone handled five
without a miscue around the hot
corner and made one sensational
pick-up far from the bag for a close
out at first.
Euss Lebeck tossed for the win
ners in the nightcap, and though he
forced in the tying run in the eighth
inning, the starboard heaver checked
the Indians in the ninth.
The split twin bill gives Santa
Clara a 2-1 win in the series and
.leaves Stanford with only two games
to play—the remaining pair of Big
Game encounters with California.
Saturday the Cards go across the
Bay to battle the Bears. The third
encounter will be played here one
week from Saturday.
