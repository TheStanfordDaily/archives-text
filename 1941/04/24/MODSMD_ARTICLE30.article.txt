ing run on second, losing to San
Mateo J.C., 4-3.
With the Bulldogs out in front by
one run, Ted Nell doubled for his
second hit of the day. Harry Reich
ling lined a hard drive into short
centeifield that looked like a sure
hit, but the Bulldogs' orchard hawk
made a diving catch and doubled
Nell off second for a twin killing.
Dick Middleton grounded out to end
the inning.
Ed Washburn collected two hits
along with Nell.
The Papooses tallied in the first as
Middleton singled Nell home and in
the second as Reichling's triple
scored Nell. V
The Bulldogs sent home the win
ning run in the last frame on a
single and two errors.
Bill Brubaker pitched for the
frosh, while Don Pendergrass rested
his good left "hand for Saturday's
final tilt with Cal at Berkeley. Hold
ing a 2-0 lead in the Little Big Game
series, the '44 babes are favored to
score a clean sweep.
