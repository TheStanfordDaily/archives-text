## CHUCK SMITH, Sports Editor Varsity Netmen Battle Bears Today in Last Tilt of Season 
### 
Making their last performance of the 194! season, the Stanford varsity
netmen will entertain the powerful University oi California team (in (lie
varsity courts at 1:30 o'clock today. The Bears won in their first meeting
by a 7-2 score.
The Indians showed great improvement in defeating the strong Uni
versity of Miami team last Tuesday. The loss was the lirst suffered by
Miami in three years. Coach Lamp was especially pleased with the

work of A1 Rose and Tom Kruger. *
Rose easily won the fifth singles,
while Kruger showed perfect con
trol in thumping George Pero.
The team will play in the same
order that they did against Miami.
Emery Neale, who has been the sur
prise find of the year, will play the
number one spot. Instead of staying
on the baseline like he did last year,
Neale has been moving to the net,
! and his volleying and smashes have
| been winning. Neale will probably
, meet Bob Hippensteil, to whom he
! lost in the first meeting. He has |
j vowed to win this time.
Playing second will be Larry Dee,
who has been a puzzle all year. Dee |
reputedly has one of the best games |
j in intercollegiate tennis but he can't
seem to get going. He will draw Bill
I Canning of the Bears.
Behind Dee will be Jimmy Wade,
meeting Bob MeCaughlin. Wade ran
through MeCaughlin 6-4. 6-2 last
; Thursday, and should whip him j
j again today.
Clarence Low, ringer from New
York, will battle with George Spen
cer in the fourth singles, while Rose
takes over five and Kruger the sixth
j spot.
| The classy doubles team of Dee
! and Wade should blast through the
Bear team of Canning and Gunny j
Ammonette, or any other combina
tion the Bears may throw up. The
i number one team for the Cards has
| too much power, and should pro-
I vide the fans with a good display of
I tennis.
The other Card doubles teams also
j appear to have the edge on paper,
! although they lost last week. Low
I and Stan Owen have good games if
1 they can get some fight, and the
! same goes for Neale and Jack
i Gurley.
