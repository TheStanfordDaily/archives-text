HOUSTON, Tex., April 23 (UP).
I â€”Bobby Riggs and Frank Guernsey

i-idelines today, then waded out on n
I rain-soaked court to win the annual
j River Oaks tennis doubles champion

I Kramer and Tod Sohroeder.
Kramer and Schroeder didn't like
the downpour, nor the mud.

had a 2-0 lead in the early sets
J when the rain started. Riggs and
I Guernsey peeled off as much of their
clothing as decency permitted, and
| out-waded the champions lor a
| 3-G, 4-6, 8-6, 10-8, 6-3 victory.
It takes about 45 gallons of water
