# Frolic for the Farm
## 
### 
ALONG time ago, in the dim reaches of
winter quarter 1940, a bunch of the boys
had an idea that furnished meat for many bull
sessions.
The idea burst forth into full blossom shortly
before finals of that long-ago quarter, and finally
bore fruit as the first of Stanford's Back-to-the-
Farm days.
In March of last year, what can unblushingly
be termed one of the finest and most enjoyable
of Farm traditions came into being.
Back to the Farm, 1940 version, turned un
dergraduate clocks back to the gay nineties.
With surreys and hay-wagons, pompadours and
bustles, switches and top hats, the campus went
old-style with a vengeance.
And with the faculty, from professors through
instructors, and the Administration from Dr. Wil
bur on down joining in the fun, the campus
found itself with a superbly good time on its
campus calendar.
It was so darned much fun that it turned into a
tradition overnight.
Tomorrow the Farm turns back to those good
old days of fifty years ago, when the auto was
even less than a passing fancy and when a
horse and buggy was the latest thing on the
highways.
It's the day when remodeled Roughs and
dines for peg-top britches and bowlers, and
when the lassies turn back the hands of time
with the bustles and switches of yester-year.
It's the day when re-modeled Roughs and
Farmerettes forsake the pageantry and fluff of
a modem wardrobe for the fun of lavender and
lace from the attic-stored trunks of their fathers
and mothes.
It's the spontaneity of the whole affair that
makes it what it is. It's the lack of rules on
what to wear, the absence of a director to stage
each entrance and exit, that gives it the twist
that makes it work.
It's nothing that a chairman can sit down and
map out.
All it takes is 4,000 members of the Stanford
family, all getting together and having a darned
good Back-to-the-Farm time.
