# Second Childhood?
## 
### 
SHAKESPEARE in his famous passage begin
ning "All the world's a stage, and all the
men and women merely players . . claims
that every man while playing his part on life's
stage passes through seven distinct periods.
Of these stages of life, the sixth and next to
last is second childhood.
Now it may be spring or the draft, or it may
be any number of things, but it seems that a
great many Stanfordites are just about ready
to hit that sixth stage a little ahead of their
time.
When we were getting along in high school
and went to a Saturday afternoon show, we
used to get a little bored when the twelfth
chapte of "Luke Travers and the Cystal Cane"
flashed on the screen.
We could not possibly have conceived at
that time of a bunch of college students actually
getting a bang out of something like that.
But this Sunday evening in the Education
Auditorium the first of a new series of Sunday
night movies will be shown. The full-length
leature will be "The Count of Monte Cristo," a
favorite several years back.
But along with the feature will flash on the
screen the first episode of a genuine, kid thriller,
"The Clutching Hand."
There will be a great many Stanford men
and women who will hike over to the Ed
Building, plink down their 15 cents, and plump
down into the red plush seats.
They'll hiss the villain and cheer the hero
just like Saturday afternoon kids.
Was Shakespeare wrong when he put that
second childhood stage down near the end of
life's third act? C. B.
