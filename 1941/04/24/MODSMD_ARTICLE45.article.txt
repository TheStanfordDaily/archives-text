# BULL SESSION
## THE 						SPECIALIST 
### JERRY MAYER 
WPRING is in the air. The scent of lilacs hangs
heavily over the earth, like a giant blanket lying
loosely on a grassy bank, ruffled by the wind, but
fastened carelessly at the corners so that it can never
quite blow completely loose. But this makes no im
pression on me. I am angry at the linotyper. He is
like a relentless weed pressing up from the lower re
gions, something inevitable, unpleasant. A real stink

lINOTYPER'S NOTE: This guy Mayer comes into
the backshop last night after the Daily is all set
and locked up Rnd he sees the proof of Bull Session
and says to me, "Mr. Etaoin, that note there at the
foot of my column is a lie!"
I says, "It ain't no lie, so what're you going to do
about it?" But I no sooner say this than I wish I
don't because I see his fists are out and his shoulders,
great big wide shoulders, are moving up and down.
I am glad I don't say like I am going to that Bull
Session isn't his column anyway, that I happen to
know the Shack janitor gets the stuff off the floor with
a pitchfork and Mayer only carries it out.
He feints at me. I reach out in self-defense and
grab his shoulders. But I realize now that I make a
typographical error like I am always doing. The
word was "faints" and not "feints." Because his
shoulders come off as he slips toward the floor. It
ain't Mayer's shoulders at all; it's only cotton pads!
I drop these handfuls and grab again and this time I
get skin and bone, which is Mayer, and I hold him up.
"Mr. Etaoin," he gasps, and little bubbles of froth
come to his lips and bust while he talks. "Mr. Etaoin,
I was just going to ask you to come down to Belt's
with me and have some cokes."
"What is cokes?" I asks him.
"You'll see," he tells me.
* * * *
ri/IMM! I never before taste anything like cokes!
The funny thing is, Mayer drinks his out of a
bottle shaped like Mae West and I get mine in a glass
with ice and something else the man in the white coat
pours in it. But I like this feeling cokes make inside
of me, sort of like I swallow a match and it starts to
burn. Pretty soon I discover Mayer is quintuplets
and all five of him is here.
They all start talking at once, like a bunch of choir
boys chanting. "Et," they say, "I " Now, this seems
funny to me, come to think of it; don't those five
Mayer boys know themselves from each other? "Et,
I insist you tell the truth about that note at the end
of my column. The first note. You didn't write it.
I wrote it."
"Where's the janitor come in," I says through a
mouthful of ice.
All five of them Mayers grab me and say, "Forget
the janitor stuff, see? Think I want the campus to
know a janitor is my ghost?"
"Let go me!" 1 yells. "You guys let me go!"
They laugh like they are devils, or ghosts. "Oh, no!
Oh, no!"
"I got a wife and two kids!" I beg. "I ought be home
with them now!"
* * * *
r r , HEN they say, "No, Et. You stay right here and
keep on drinking cokes until you admit to me that
the janitor that writes Bull Session doesn't write it.
And you'll have to agree to admit in the Daily that
you didn't write that note that you wrote on the end
of my column."
I feel Oh-h-h. Oh-h-h! That first coke tasted
and felt so good. But now it's like I swallow a whole
ocean flavored sweet and the waves are breaking
against my tonsils. Oh-h-h!
"Take me home!" I cry. "Home!"
. . Where the buffalo roam; where the deer and
the antelope play"—the Mayer quintet is singing that.
So sweet and pretty. I can't stand it any longer. Home
is where I got to go.
"I will admit you guys wrote that note," I says.
"I will not tell nobody your ghost is the janitor—if
you only'll take me home!"
So they take me home to Mayfield.
So, though he didn't, I am admitting that he did
write that note; and though he docs have the janitor
ghost his Bull Session, I ain't telling nobody.
(Editor's Note: This business had belter stop
P.D.Q. I'm getting tired of it.)
