# STANFORD'S UP A TOWER
## 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Yesterday saw another typical example of the
well known Stanford "apathy" toward things worth
while, when the student strike, which drew almost a
million students in other parts of the country, was a
dismal flop here.
We have not heard a single instance of a student
walking out of a class. It. is part of the Stanford
"ivory towers" tradition, that we can not assert our
selves in a way that will bring to the attention of
the authorities the attitude that the college student of
today has against war and all of its muck?
The attitude of the A.S.S.U. in refusing to either
sanction or recognize the movement cannot be too
strongly condemned. If the student government is
afraid to stick its neck out in order to co-operate with
schools all over the country, it Is no wonder that the
average Stanford student is often characterized as a
snob.
This talk of the movement being connected with
Socialistic and Communistic groups is merely Â«an at
tempt at muck-raking, and should be recognized as
such. The groups starting the campaign have no such
ideals, and cannot help it if subversive groups trail
along and try to grab some of the glory from an en
tirely worthy movement.
With the war hysteria that is sweeping the country
today, the average student cannot take his mind off
of "fifth columnists" and their activities. Is that any
reason why we should allow a group of muck-rakers
to throw mud all over what is a sincere attempt to
make a protest against all of this war-mongering?
The Daily's attempts to play down the movement
should also come in for their share of the criticism.
There is no reason why the whole thing should have
not received fairer coverage than it did. Instead of
trying to put the thing in a poor light, The Daily
should have been the prime mover in an effort to get
the ball rolling and to get some real support behind
the movement,
