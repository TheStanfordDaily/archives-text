### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Frankie Albert needs no introduc
tion at Stanford. Besides putting
the Farm on the map for his All -
American football performance last
fall, he holds claim to the title of
campus leader number two as wit
nessed by his recent nomination for
student body president.
Albert was nominated for schol
arships by both the Student Aid
Fund and the Buck of the Month
Club.
ROSE BOWL MAYBE
The nation's top quarterback
thinks the Cardinal team will have
to work hard to get back in the
Rose Bowl next year. With 18 teams
gunning for them, he advocates the
benefits of an underdog psychology.
The fact that the Indians arc the
favored team shouldn't lead them to
take anything for granted, accord
ing to Albert.
"We've got eight men returning
next year from the starting line-ujt
and Shaughnessy is much impressed
by the frosh that turned up for
spring practice. The prospects look
good now," he speculated.
Albert credits last season's foot
ball success to two factors: the fine
coaching staff and the team per
sonnel.
GOOD LINE
"We had a wonderful line forma
tion and good blockers," he said. "It
seems like the T-formation just
suited us. As to the coaching,
Shaughnessy knows more football
than anybody in the country. And
he's a first-rate leader with boys."
His own publicity bouquets, Al
bert modestly hands out to his
teammates.
"It was just luck that I was chosen
All-American quarterback," he said.
"I owe everything to the team. Often
credit is not given where it is de
served. The sports writers had to
single out someone and it just hap
pened to be me, but," he added, "I'm
not complaining."

not complaining."

Frankie Albert needs no introduc
tion at Stanford. Besides putting
the Farm on the map for his All -
American football performance last
fall, he holds claim to the title of
campus leader number two as wit
nessed by his recent nomination for
student body president.
Albert was nominated for schol
arships by both the Student Aid
Fund and the Buck of the Month
Club.
ROSE BOWL MAYBE
The nation's top quarterback
thinks the Cardinal team will have
to work hard to get back in the
Rose Bowl next year. With 18 teams
gunning for them, he advocates the
benefits of an underdog psychology.
The fact that the Indians arc the
favored team shouldn't lead them to
take anything for granted, accord
ing to Albert.
"We've got eight men returning
next year from the starting line-ujt
and Shaughnessy is much impressed
by the frosh that turned up for
spring practice. The prospects look
good now," he speculated.
Albert credits last season's foot
ball success to two factors: the fine
coaching staff and the team per
sonnel.
GOOD LINE
"We had a wonderful line forma
tion and good blockers," he said. "It
seems like the T-formation just
suited us. As to the coaching,
Shaughnessy knows more football
than anybody in the country. And
he's a first-rate leader with boys."
His own publicity bouquets, Al
bert modestly hands out to his
teammates.
"It was just luck that I was chosen
All-American quarterback," he said.
"I owe everything to the team. Often
credit is not given where it is de
served. The sports writers had to
single out someone and it just hap
pened to be me, but," he added, "I'm
not complaining."
