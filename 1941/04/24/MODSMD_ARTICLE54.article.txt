SAN FRANCISCO. April 23 (UP).
â€”A 74-passenger Boeing clipper,
second of the type to be delivered
to Pan American Airways, reached
San Francisco at 4:45 p.m. today
after a flight from Seattle and As
toria, Ore. The 41-ton plane is des
tined for service across the Atlantic.

How about that old 1929 driver's
license? Have you had it renewed?
