# THE 						DEBATERS.
## They Write Us A Letter. All About Their Wanderings 
### 
(Editor's Note: Stanford's two
travelling debaters are now in the
fari city of Albuquerque, New
Mexico. Next week, they will
journey to the City of the Angels
to engage in forensic competition
the teams of the University of
Southern California and the Uni
versity of California at the City
of the Angels. Then they will re
turn to the eagerly awaited -Farm.
This is their latest communication
to Stanford.)

Dear :
The debate team has since the last
letter engaged in debate St. Peter's
College, Loyola, Indiana, and Drake.
The second of these was a radio de
bate in which we opposed exemp
tion of college students from the
draft. The other three were all dedi
cated to (he rather difficult task of
supporting the proposition, "Re
solved, that the nations of the West
ern Hemisphere should form a .per
manent union." Such consistent
practice is hoped to perfect the
affirmative case.
As one continues on this tour of
colleges and universities he tends to
be struck by two things: Women
and Unions.
OUR WOMEN AIN'T SO BAD.
The first of these may be handled
briefly. The Stanford woman may
not be the acme of perfection, the
Mower of womanhood, or the ideal
of the Stanford man. But her su
periority begins to become evident
as one encounters the specimens on
other campi. Not until we hit Drake
did we find a really pleasing femi
ninity. Further, our frequent com
plaint, "There arc three men to ev
ery woman at Stanford, and she al
ways lets you know you're the
third," is one which applies to most
campi at least as far as the first
clause is concerned. Most campi wc
have visited have a ratio in excess
of two to one. Oh, to return to
Stanford, the home of tolerable
women.
The other item of interest which
continually presents itself is that of
the Student Union. We have seen
all kinds of them—ranging from but
little to the four-and-a-half-million
dollar structure at Minnesota. There
is, however, one safe generalization:
they are all better than our ''union"
—at least, they are on those twelve
campi where they've had them. Even
little Drake, with twelve hundred
students, batters our Cellar-A.S.S.U.
offices-concert series-and juke box
combination.
Perhaps when that 60-year bond
issue on the Memorial Auditorium
is paid back, the A.S.S.U. could start
on a Memorial Union. Let's take
up a slogan: Union by '91.
A LITTLE FACETIOUSNESS:
Streit said Union Now. We are
practical: Union by '91. Be nice at
the Centennial celebration.
Actually, as one sees more and
more schools —including a number
of cow colleges, one wonders more
and more how it is that a first-class
school such as Stanford can fall so
thoroughly short on an item which
forms so vital a focus for student
life wherever it is found.
Tomorrow night we face lowa
State and consider, symposium-style,
the question, "What should we do
about the problem of war propa
ganda in the United States." They
charge admission—and expect 2500.
This arouses our curiosity.
We have hit a number of campi
squarely in their elections. Two pe
culiar things: 1. They take their poli

tics very seriously—sort of a life
and-death matter. 2. The candidates
run on platforms — just as though
they had some purpose in running.
This latter may seem peculiar be
cause of the writer's Stanford back
ground, or it may seem peculiar be
cause of the platforms. One won
ders how such promises as these can
be effected: "To assure more ade
quate lighting facilities in all col
lege buildings," "To assure an effi
cient fire prevention program," "To
assure improved traffic regulations
on Lincoln Highway."
Maybe some of our aspiring polit
icos should run their ticket on re
form of the libe parking lot. Cer
tain victory. No less.
Hope you can decipher this mess.
Buckets of love,
Linn Moses

Since 1897 there has been noth
ing at Stanford more enjoyable in
the line of dramatic farce than
"Bangs' Chafing-Dish Party" pre
sented at Roble last Saturday eve
ning on the Occasion of their re

supporting the proposition, "Re
solved, that the nations of the West
ern Hemisphere should form a .per
manent union." Such consistent
practice is hoped to perfect the
affirmative case.
As one continues on this tour of
colleges and universities he tends to
be struck by two things: Women
and Unions.
OUR WOMEN AIN'T SO BAD.
The first of these may be handled
briefly. The Stanford woman may
not be the acme of perfection, the
Mower of womanhood, or the ideal
of the Stanford man. But her su
periority begins to become evident
as one encounters the specimens on
other campi. Not until we hit Drake
did we find a really pleasing femi
ninity. Further, our frequent com
plaint, "There arc three men to ev
ery woman at Stanford, and she al
ways lets you know you're the
third," is one which applies to most
campi at least as far as the first
clause is concerned. Most campi wc
have visited have a ratio in excess
of two to one. Oh, to return to
Stanford, the home of tolerable
women.
The other item of interest which
continually presents itself is that of
the Student Union. We have seen
all kinds of them—ranging from but
little to the four-and-a-half-million
dollar structure at Minnesota. There
is, however, one safe generalization:
they are all better than our ''union"
—at least, they are on those twelve
campi where they've had them. Even
little Drake, with twelve hundred
students, batters our Cellar-A.S.S.U.
offices-concert series-and juke box
combination.
Perhaps when that 60-year bond
issue on the Memorial Auditorium
is paid back, the A.S.S.U. could start
on a Memorial Union. Let's take
up a slogan: Union by '91.
A LITTLE FACETIOUSNESS:
Streit said Union Now. We are
practical: Union by '91. Be nice at
the Centennial celebration.
Actually, as one sees more and
more schools —including a number
of cow colleges, one wonders more
and more how it is that a first-class
school such as Stanford can fall so
thoroughly short on an item which
forms so vital a focus for student
life wherever it is found.
Tomorrow night we face lowa
State and consider, symposium-style,
the question, "What should we do
about the problem of war propa
ganda in the United States." They
charge admission—and expect 2500.
This arouses our curiosity.
We have hit a number of campi
squarely in their elections. Two pe
culiar things: 1. They take their poli

tics very seriously—sort of a life
and-death matter. 2. The candidates
run on platforms — just as though
they had some purpose in running.
This latter may seem peculiar be
cause of the writer's Stanford back
ground, or it may seem peculiar be
cause of the platforms. One won
ders how such promises as these can
be effected: "To assure more ade
quate lighting facilities in all col
lege buildings," "To assure an effi
cient fire prevention program," "To
assure improved traffic regulations
on Lincoln Highway."
Maybe some of our aspiring polit
icos should run their ticket on re
form of the libe parking lot. Cer
tain victory. No less.
Hope you can decipher this mess.

ery woman at Stanford, and she al
ways lets you know you're the
third," is one which applies to most
campi at least as far as the first
clause is concerned. Most campi wc
have visited have a ratio in excess
of two to one. Oh, to return to
Stanford, the home of tolerable
women.
The other item of interest which
continually presents itself is that of
the Student Union. We have seen
all kinds of them—ranging from but
little to the four-and-a-half-million
dollar structure at Minnesota. There
is, however, one safe generalization:
they are all better than our ''union"
—at least, they are on those twelve
campi where they've had them. Even
little Drake, with twelve hundred
students, batters our Cellar-A.S.S.U.
offices-concert series-and juke box
combination.
Perhaps when that 60-year bond
issue on the Memorial Auditorium
is paid back, the A.S.S.U. could start
on a Memorial Union. Let's take
up a slogan: Union by '91.
A LITTLE FACETIOUSNESS:
Streit said Union Now. We are
practical: Union by '91. Be nice at
the Centennial celebration.
Actually, as one sees more and
more schools —including a number
of cow colleges, one wonders more
and more how it is that a first-class
school such as Stanford can fall so
thoroughly short on an item which
forms so vital a focus for student
life wherever it is found.
Tomorrow night we face lowa
State and consider, symposium-style,
the question, "What should we do
about the problem of war propa
ganda in the United States." They
charge admission—and expect 2500.
This arouses our curiosity.
We have hit a number of campi
squarely in their elections. Two pe
culiar things: 1. They take their poli

tics very seriously—sort of a life
and-death matter. 2. The candidates
run on platforms — just as though
they had some purpose in running.
This latter may seem peculiar be
cause of the writer's Stanford back
ground, or it may seem peculiar be
cause of the platforms. One won
ders how such promises as these can
be effected: "To assure more ade
quate lighting facilities in all col
lege buildings," "To assure an effi
cient fire prevention program," "To
assure improved traffic regulations
on Lincoln Highway."
Maybe some of our aspiring polit
icos should run their ticket on re
form of the libe parking lot. Cer
tain victory. No less.
Hope you can decipher this mess.

Since 1897 there has been noth
ing at Stanford more enjoyable in
the line of dramatic farce than
"Bangs' Chafing-Dish Party" pre
sented at Roble last Saturday eve
ning on the Occasion of their re
ception to the Faculty.—lB99
(Editor's Note: Stanford's two
travelling debaters are now in the
fari city of Albuquerque, New
Mexico. Next week, they will
journey to the City of the Angels
to engage in forensic competition
the teams of the University of
Southern California and the Uni
versity of California at the City
of the Angels. Then they will re
turn to the eagerly awaited -Farm.
This is their latest communication
to Stanford.)

Dear :
The debate team has since the last
letter engaged in debate St. Peter's
College, Loyola, Indiana, and Drake.
The second of these was a radio de
bate in which we opposed exemp
tion of college students from the
draft. The other three were all dedi
cated to (he rather difficult task of
supporting the proposition, "Re
solved, that the nations of the West
ern Hemisphere should form a .per
manent union." Such consistent
practice is hoped to perfect the
affirmative case.
As one continues on this tour of
colleges and universities he tends to
be struck by two things: Women
and Unions.
OUR WOMEN AIN'T SO BAD.
The first of these may be handled
briefly. The Stanford woman may
not be the acme of perfection, the
Mower of womanhood, or the ideal
of the Stanford man. But her su
periority begins to become evident
as one encounters the specimens on
other campi. Not until we hit Drake
did we find a really pleasing femi
ninity. Further, our frequent com
plaint, "There arc three men to ev
ery woman at Stanford, and she al
ways lets you know you're the
