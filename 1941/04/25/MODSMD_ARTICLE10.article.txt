# THE DEBATERS.
## They Write Us A Letter. All About Their Wanderings 
### 
(Editor's Note: Stanford's two
travelling debaters are now in the
fari city of Albuquerque, New
Mexico. Next week, they will
journey to the City of the Angels
to engage in forensic competition
the teams of the University of
Southern California and the Uni
versity of California at the City
of the Angels. Then they will re
turn to the eagerly awaited -Farm.
This is their latest communication
to Stanford.)

Dear :
The debate team has since the last
letter engaged in debate St. Peter's
College, Loyola, Indiana, and Drake.
The second of these was a radio de
bate in which we opposed exemp
tion of college students from the
draft. The other three were all dedi
cated to (he rather difficult task of
supporting the proposition, "Re
solved, that the nations of the West
ern Hemisphere should form a .per
manent union." Such consistent
practice is hoped to perfect the
affirmative case.
As one continues on this tour of
colleges and universities he tends to
be struck by two things: Women
and Unions.
OUR WOMEN AIN'T SO BAD.
The first of these may be handled
briefly. The Stanford woman may
not be the acme of perfection, the
Mower of womanhood, or the ideal
of the Stanford man. But her su
periority begins to become evident
as one encounters the specimens on
other campi. Not until we hit Drake
did we find a really pleasing femi
ninity. Further, our frequent com
plaint, "There arc three men to ev
ery woman at Stanford, and she al
ways lets you know you're the
third," is one which applies to most
campi at least as far as the first
clause is concerned. Most campi wc
have visited have a ratio in excess
of two to one. Oh, to return to
Stanford, the home of tolerable
women.
The other item of interest which
continually presents itself is that of
the Student Union. We have seen
all kinds of themâ€”ranging from but
little to the four-and-a-half-million
dollar structure at Minnesota. There
is, however, one safe generalization:
