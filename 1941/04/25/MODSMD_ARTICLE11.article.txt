# A COMPLAINT.
## Seniors Fail To Register. Disappointment Is Evidenced. 
### Miss Rosemarie Julia Mullany, '42 
Great disappointment was evi
denced yesterday morning on the
Campus due to the fact that many
scholars, whom everyone expected
to see among the candidates for
graduation in June, were absent
from the roster of students. It was
published in the columns of the
Stanford student newspaper yester
day.
Among the assiduous scholars
whose names were missing was that
of Mr. Edmund Wright Pugh, Jr.,
chairman of the Student Group,
Cardinals. Mr. Gerald Humphrey
Mayer, noted author of the literary
column, Bull Session, and a member
of the judicial body, Men's Council,
was also omitted from the list.
It is to be hoped that these Stu
dent Body members have not ne
glected to file petitions for gradua
tion. The Registrar has said that
students should have the documents
submitted by June 6.
Young ladies and gentlemen on
The Quad stifled expressions of as
tonishment at discovering that these
names were not on the Roster: Anne
Townsend, Vice-President of the
Student Body, (Miss Townsend is
from Arcadia); Mr. Sherman Mous
sof Mellinkoff, now a student of
Medical Arts; Mr. Peter Clark
Whittlesey, who leads the fraternity
houses in their activities; Mr. Theo
dore Moreno, the indefatigable cap
tain of our water polo team; Miss
Mary June Montgomery, formerly
Head Monitor at Roble Hall; Miss
Muriel Elizabeth Boggs, a speaking
member of the Executive Commit
tee; the Misses Dorothy Mae Wiet,
and Dorothy Hanzlik of the Gamma
Phi House; Mr. Kenneth Owler
Smith, editor of the Campus Maga
zine.
The absence of thesb and other
student leaders and scholars has
proved disheartening to the general
Student Body.
