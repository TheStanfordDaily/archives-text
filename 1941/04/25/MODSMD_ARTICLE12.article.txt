# A 						GALA PARTY.
## Do Come to Ball Tonight. Young Ladies Bring Dolls. 
### 
Get oil the two bucks and give it
to the Gay Nineties Dance which
happens tonght from !) to 1 in the
Pavilion.
Everyone is going, so join the
merry throng which will weave its
way through the doors to hear the
music of Gene Englander and to
dance a few square dances. During
the dance, four picked couples will
demonstrate and lead square dances
so that all present may get into the
spirit of the party.
Costumes will be 'old-fashioned
and rustic. Bids cost $2.00 apiece,
and the woman of each couple must
bring a toy which will be turned
over to the Convalescent children.
Cokes, contributed by the Coca-
Cola people, will be distributed in
stead of punch to the dancers.
It promises to be a gay time. Lots
of square dancing, lots of music,
lots of riots, and lots of fun. Sec
you there.
