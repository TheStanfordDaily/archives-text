# WE GO RUSTIC.
## Scholars Don Odd Clothing. They Will Dance Tonight. Gas Buggies Are Forbidden. Labor Day was a Big Success 
### K. Lyman Ames, VII, '42 
Time turns back today as Stan
ford goes Back to the Farm in the
best 1890 fashion. In this, the last
day of the 1941 Convalescent Home
Drive, all students will wear rustic
and old fashion costumes during
the entire day and will top the eve
ning off at the Gay Nineties Dance
in the Pavilion.
No motor-driven vehicles will be
permitted to operate on campus to
day, and all roads will be blockod
off to assure compliance with this
rule.
"Remember what happened to stu
dents who didn't wear costumes at
last year's Back to the Farm Day,"
Graham Barbey warned last night.
"Let's everybody get into the spirit
of the day, and make this a riotous
ending to this year's drive."
STANFORD WORKS.
Yesterday saw Stanford doing
light tasks and heavy eating at the
Convalescent Home as Stanford cele
brated Labor Day. The Oaks, with
a per capita contribution of $3.19,
crowned their boy king of Con
valescent Home Week, while the Phi
Sigs crowned the queen with a per
capita contribution of $3.34.
Runners-up in the King-Queen
contest women's division were the
Pi Phis, Manzanita, Alpha Phi, and
Gamma Phi. In the men's division,
runners-up were the Chi Psis, Fi
gees, D.U., and Firehouse.
Special thanks must be given to
the Coca Cola Company, which con
tributed free 30 cases of cokes to
yesterday's Labor Day celebration
at the Con Home, and to Larry Bell
and Ed Tomaso, Farm coke men,
who contributed their services all in
the name of charity.
DANCING IN TIIE GYM.
Climax of the day was a jolly-up
in the Women's Gym.
But today, it's Back to the Farm.
Break out your costumes, horses,
mules, and buggies and go rustic.
