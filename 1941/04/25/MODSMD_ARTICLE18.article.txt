New York, April 24 (UP). —Sec-
retary of the Navy Frank Knox
s;iid tonight the United States "can
no longer occupy the immoral and
craven position of asking others to
make all the sacrifice for this vic
tory which we recognize as so es
sential to us."
' Hitler cannot allow our war sup
plies and food to reach England—
he will Ix? defeated if they do," Mr.
Knox said. "We cannot allow our
goods to be sunk in the Atlantic—
w< shall be beaten if they do. We
must make our promise good to give
ai<l to Britain. We must see the job
through. All of this is needed for
our own safety and our future se-
CU" ity. This is our fight. The Amer
ican people have recognized the
catastrophic quality of a totalitarian
victory and by overwhelming ma
joi iI \ they have endorsed every step
along the progress we have made to
our present posture."

lie described America as "grad
ually becoming encircled by military
powers" which have "repeatedly
proclaimed themselves as our ene
mies" and are joined "in a pact which
they do not hesitate to say is aimed
at us."
Speaking over a nationwide (NBC)
radio network only a few hours after
he attended a momentous meeting of
President Roosevelt's "war cabinet,"
he warned that "these are desperate
ly serious days."
"Events have shown beyond pos
sible question," he said, "that the
safety of this hemisphere and of this
country calls for resistance wher
ever resistance will be most effec
tive."
WAYS TO BE FOUND.
"This means," he added, "that ways
must be found to get aid to Great
Britain and other nations resisting
the dictators in the shortest of time
and in maximum quanity."
"Too few of us," he said, "realize
. . . the disaster to American hemi
sphere safety if Germany should
establish herself in Dakar. From
there ... a victorious Germany
could substantially cut us off from
all commerce with South America
and make the Monroe doctrine a
scrap of paper."
