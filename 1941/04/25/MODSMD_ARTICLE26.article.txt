# OUR DEBATERS.
## Those Who Stayed Home. They Partake of a Banquet. They Encounter Berkeley. 
### 
A young liidy and two young gen
tlemen of Stanford's freshman class
yesterday journeyed to Berkeley,
the home of the University of Cali
fornia, to engage the California
freshman in a forensic contest.
The young people, Miss Marie
Catherine Barovic, Mr. Hyland Ju
lian Hubert, and Mr. Allan Arthur
Aimer, first partook of a banquet
given in honor of all the Univer
sity of California debaters. Many
celebrities in the forensic world
spoke before the assembled com
pany.
After the meal, the three argued
in competition with three California
people on the vital question, "Re
solved, that the United States should
declare war on Germany." The
event was non-decision.
This was the second and last of
the freshman debate series with the
University of California. The first
was held on the Farm Tuesday.
A week from tomorrow, two gen
tlemen of the freshman class will
debate over the wireless station
KROW, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
They will take the negative side of
the question, "Resolved, that com
pulsory arbitration should be en
forced in labor strikes." The young
gentlemen are Mr. Peter Lee Paget
and Mr. Howard Lee Ledeen.
