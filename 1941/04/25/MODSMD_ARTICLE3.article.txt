Latest fashion items from Paris,
France!
For those students who simply
canndt. make up their minds what to
wear to Stanford's Back to the Farm
celebration today, The Daily's fash
ion editor has a number of valuable
suggestions.
To the Ladies! Red-checkered
material of the laundry-bag variety
makes beautiful blouses and skirts
in any style, Farm or Nineties. Then,
for those who have no laundry bags,
any slightly-worn wash dress will
create the desired effect.
BOWS ARE VERY NICE
If some ladies have had their hair
shorn because of an attack of ty
phoid, why don't they braid the short
locks and tie them with fetching
little ribbon bows. One big bow on
top of the head or at the back is al
ways chic.
Then, if one is going as a country
lass, a few teeth blacked out in front
is strictly necessary. And a few
freckles pencilled on the nose give a
most satisfactory effect.
And the gentlemen! Laundry bags
are also good for shirts or bar-tend
ers' aprons. If the gentlemen are not
very handy with the needle they can
always wear their hasher jackets.
PARTS IN THE MIDDLE.
Latest reports on men's coiffures
indicate that the hair simply must be
parted in the middle this season.
False hair is good for mustachcs if
the beard has been shaved recently.
If not even false hair can be mus
tered up, a soft pencil can do the
trick.
And then there are those gentle
men(?) on the Farm who could ap
pear as they do every day and be
perfect examples of what a farm
hand should look like.
