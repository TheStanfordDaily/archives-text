# SHAKESPEARE.
## 'The Comedy of Errors.' An Excellent Presentation. Wo Liked It Immensely. 
### Mr. V. Ivan Minahan, Jr., '43 
Last evening the University's dra
natic group, who call themselves
he Stanford Players, presented a
sterling performance of one of The
Sard's outstanding comedies—"The
Comedy of Errors."
The play is a witty thing, yet filled
.vith the beautiful bits of wisdom
■vith which The Bard fills his pieces.
Vlany of the more less understand
ng of the crowd rocked with laugh
er at the words of the players, but
vVe Who Understand The Bard
iighed and quivered at the subtle
rvisdom contained in the words.
Mr. Asher Wilson and Mr. Dana
Winters performed brilliantly in the
•oles of the twin slaves. In this play
Vlr. Wilson was introduced in a
•ole unusual to him—that vulgarly
•eferrcd to in popular journals as
'slapstick" comedy. From the
•heers and "bravos" that burst from
he gallery for him it was obvious
hat he was a tremendous success.
Vlr. Winters was also outstanding in
lis comedy role.
I'HE ANTIPHOLI.
The parts of the Antipholus twins
Note played by Messrs. John Lawry
ind Paul Hostetler, both of whom
urned in very good performances.
\nd they looked just like real twins,
rteally they did!
There was a rather vague charac
er in the play that everybody
iround us seemed to understand,
jut whom we could not figure out.
ihe wore shocking clothes, and
;eemed to have a lot of gentlemen
riends.
We're sure The Bard must have
jeen mixed up when he created
ler. Anyway, Miss Jacques Poley

played the part very well.
Miss Patricia Allen was cast in
the part of the wife of Antipholus
of Ephesus, and did excellently. Miss
Allen has been knocking around
that Drama Department, for quite a
while now and we are pleased to
see her get the roles her talent de
serves. Also outstanding among the
feminine roles was Miss Betty
Howe, a blond young thing whom
we're sure must waltz every waltz
at the College Socials.
All in all, the production was an
immense success. Oh, but we do
hope the Players will do something
of The Bard's again soon.
