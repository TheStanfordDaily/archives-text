# NO 'CHEEK TO CHEEK.'
## Conference Bans Practice. 
### 
Stanford University, Cal., Mob. 11,
1921.â€”Stanford men needn't be so
particular now about smooth shaves
and the girls won't have to use the
kind of rouge that doesn't rub off.
Because "cheek-to-cheek" danc
ing has been placed under the ban.
First the faculty frownd on that
popular sport.
And now the thing has been made
final by the women's conference.
"The attention of the women's
conference has been called to the
extent of 'cheek-to-cheek' dancing
on this campus," read a letter the
women's conference sent to each so
rority house.
"Considerable criticism has been
made by both men and women
chaperones."
