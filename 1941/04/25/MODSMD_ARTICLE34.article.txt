## Dr. Jordan Deplores Habit. Are Lonely Ladies Smoking? 
### 
"When women smoke I cut them
off my calling list," said Dr. David
Starr Jordan, President Emeritus of
Stanford University, in discussing
the modern fondness of the weaker
sex for the solace of a "fag."
"It is simply a phase of vulgarity
imported from Europe and it is de
grading not only to women but to
the race. There are no two ways
about it. I can't say much about
women who smoke, for I don't know
them. When they become familiar
with the cigarette I cease to main
tain friendship with them.
AH! LONELY.
"Why will a girl smoke when she
is alone at home? Why? I ask
you. Perhaps because she is lonely.
Well, I'd hate to be so lonely and
friendless that I could not find a
better solace than a cigarette. If she
thinks there is anything clever or
original about it she is greatly mis
taken. It is a common, degrading
habit and is much more harmful
to women than to men, because the
former possess more intricate and
more highly developed nervous sys
tems."
Such is the very definite opinion
of the world-renowned scientist.
alann is shown in the expres
sion of a local minister, Rev. Hugh
V. White of the Christian Church,
who said:
ROSY IGNORANCE.
"I am not seriously concerned
about the smoking of cigarettes by
Honolulu women. Perhaps I am too
much of an optimist, for preachers
are apt to live in a world of rosy
ignorance, thinking that people are
as good as they appear to be rather
than as they are.
"The general wave of lowered
standards and loose morals is evi
denced by the prevalence of women
smokers, but I have faith to believe
that it is only temporary and that
women will not relinquish the high
spiritual and mental status which
they have acquired by means of a
long evolutionary process."â€”l92l.
