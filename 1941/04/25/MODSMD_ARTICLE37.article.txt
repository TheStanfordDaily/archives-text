# ATHLETIC MEET.
## Our Lads Need A Victory. The 						Team Will Fight Hard. 
### Mr. F. Freemont Boothe, '44 
If our boys, (the freshman track
team) can defeat those people from
across the bay (the California fresh
men), it will be the first time in
eight years that they will have done
so. It (the meet) starts at 3:30 this
afternoon on Angell and is
going to be doggoned good.
In 1933, we won, 71?<i to 59Y.\. Not
since. Last year (1940) Grover
Klemmer and some others won, 87
to 44. It was sad. One year we lost,
114 to 17. It was worse. Today it
would be good to win.
"Ifs" loom big his afternoon for
Kenny Taix, a fast fellow in the
sprints, has a bad foot and won't
run. He could take six points eas
ily yet. Also, Jean LaMoure, that
big weightman, has a bad hand, and
is a doubtful starter. Tough.
Our dependable boys, Bob Wa
ters, Donny Reiss, and Robert
(Straight A) Compton, got to win
five things between them. If they
do, we are in. Donny might break
some records. Sammy Klopstock ran
the 120 high hurdles in 15 seconds
in 1933. Donny ran 14.8 Tuesday,
see?
Two "ifs" in field events. Pat
Taylor must get his step in the
broad jump. He is a good jumper
but has had trouble getting his
step. Also, if Willard Smith, who
is sometimes quite good, other times
not so, is hot, he will win. Yeh.
About the best California men are
three Cubdebs in the 440—Duane
Lewis, Pat Flowers, and John Pra
der, all near to 50 seconds flat, which
is good. Bill Spaulding, we think,
will show them a few things there.
Also, in the 880, we think Russ
Collier and Clark Bonner will have
a close race ljut will show that Hun
nekens, Ring, and Watson a few
things about running.
Big Bob Waters will have his
hands full this afternoon. In the
sprints, it is. Tom Couch is his big
opponent, also Ribisi.
We think Compton, six-foot four
inch, can beat Harry Morgan, Berk,
in the mile and Bob Raitt, five-foot
foui-inch yet, can beat George Stein,
though they are good all.
We got a form sheet for the meet—
the way they might place. It is
somewhere on the paper if the night
editor uses it. We think LaMoure
will win if he throws, also Taylor,
also Smith, also Joslyn. If it ain't
right, at least we tried.
