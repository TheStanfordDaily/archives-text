## It Will Appear on May 21. Mr. Runacres Is the Editor. And He Works Very Hard. 
### 
Mr. Charles Edwin Runacres has
been laboring on the 50th anniver
sary edition of the Stanford Quad
since June of the year 1940. It was
at the end of last spring quarter
that Mr. Runacres hied himself to
the Stanford Library to begin re
search on the history of our Univer
sity. From that day forward, the
ideas have been taking shape and,
during the last week of May, the
volume will burst upon its public.
With the first brain child fully es
tablished, Mr. Runacres passed it on
to his artist and work was begun on
the dummy. Then it was submitted
to the editor for his personal ap
proval. At this point, Mr. Runacres'
daguerreotype staff started its opera
tions and, according to the latest
reports, the process has continued
until this date.
Throughout the greater portion of
this year, the University scholars
composing the Quad Staff have de
voted all their waking hours to the
writing of copy, the making of lay
outs and endeavoring to drag a few
shirkers into the line of march.
Reports have it that page proofs
are coming down from the pub
lishers now. Therefore, the Editor
asks that all those interested in the
publication exercise a little patience
and prepare themselves for May 21,
the date of the brain child's debut.

The Zoology Department has late
ly received an important collection
of fishes from France. The collec
tion consists of several hundred
specimens of minnows representing
many different species of that fish.
