						MUSICAL DISASTER.
## 
### 
W. H. Lanagan, '06, may not be
able to go on the vacation trip of
the musical clubs. This morning in
the gymnasium he fell and hurt a
wrist, which will prevent his playing
in the Mandolin Club. He is also a
Glee Club man, but the injury may
be serious enough to keep him at
home.—l9o2
