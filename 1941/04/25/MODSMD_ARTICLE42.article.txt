## Prophesies Big Bear Meet. Papooses To Encounter Cubs. 
### Bv Mr. C. Axel Smith, '42 
j ET'S SUPPOSE we're up in Ber-
J keley watching tomorrow's an
nual Big Meet between the power
ful Bears of California and the un
derdog Stanford Indians. And—
What if—Bob Stone starts the
fireworks as he did last year with a
long heave of say 215 feet in the
javelin; and what if—Bob Mitling
ton and Eel Stamm start hitting that
29-foot mark with the shot which
ihey have been flirting with all
Week?
And say Ernie Clark shows us
he's back in shape by fighting off
the threat of Cal's Fay Froom to
t-ike a clean second in the 440 be
hind the undeniable Grover Klem
) ler; and Johnny Grant and Don
l/lcFarland edge Cal's 10 flat sprint
« rs, Jim Jurkovich and Murray
{L'hipnuck.
What then, if these highly prob
i ble things happen? Why then Stan
lord's supposed down and out cin
ticrmen who weren't supposed to
have enough stlength to place in an
average intramural meet would be
veil on their way to a glorious up
set against a team which has been
praised and pampered since the be
ginning of the season by San Fran
cisco sports writers.
:|l * *
rjH) GET down out of the clouds
and a little closer to earth—it's
going to be awful tough tomorrow,
trying to beat California. For in
stance, Blair Hyde is definitely out
of the meet, Thor Peterson, a sure
point-getter in the broad jump, is
st'll bothered by an injury, and
Fiancis Olson, who looked so prom
ising in the 880 earlier in the sea
son, is still plagued by boils and
can't be counted on.
I know this is all sympathy stuff
but if these three plus Jack Moore,
m ;mber of last year's intercollegiate
record holding two-mile relay team,
who was called by the army; Sid
H; yes, who decided to rest for a year
a pulled muscle, and Ken Battaglia,
the fiery little sprinted who dropped
track because of a ruckus with
Coach Pitch Johnson, things would
be different.
* * *
TRACK fans may salvage
some satisfaction this week-end,
out of seeing the Indian freshman
team in action against the Cal Frosh
today at 3:15 on Angell Field.
For the current crop of yearlings
hj.ve a chance of beating their trans
b?y rivals, a feat that has not been
accomplished by Stanford Freshman
tracksters since 1933, and also have
a chance of breaking Big Little meet
track records.

TRACK fans may salvage
some satisfaction this week-end,
out of seeing the Indian freshman
team in action against the Cal Frosh
today at 3:15 on Angell Field.
For the current crop of yearlings
hj.ve a chance of beating their trans
b?y rivals, a feat that has not been
accomplished by Stanford Freshman
tracksters since 1933, and also have
a chance of breaking Big Little meet
track records.

SAN FRANCISCO. April 24 (UP).
— William La Marr of Tahoe City
shot a total of 281 out of a possible
3C3 in rapid and timed fire events
today to take first honors and es
tablish a new record in the annual
pistol competition of the California
slate fish and game wardens.
j ET'S SUPPOSE we're up in Ber-
J keley watching tomorrow's an
nual Big Meet between the power
ful Bears of California and the un
derdog Stanford Indians. And—
What if—Bob Stone starts the
fireworks as he did last year with a
long heave of say 215 feet in the
javelin; and what if—Bob Mitling
ton and Eel Stamm start hitting that
29-foot mark with the shot which
ihey have been flirting with all
Week?
And say Ernie Clark shows us
he's back in shape by fighting off
the threat of Cal's Fay Froom to
t-ike a clean second in the 440 be
hind the undeniable Grover Klem
) ler; and Johnny Grant and Don
l/lcFarland edge Cal's 10 flat sprint
« rs, Jim Jurkovich and Murray
{L'hipnuck.
What then, if these highly prob
i ble things happen? Why then Stan
lord's supposed down and out cin
ticrmen who weren't supposed to
have enough stlength to place in an
average intramural meet would be
veil on their way to a glorious up
set against a team which has been
praised and pampered since the be
ginning of the season by San Fran
cisco sports writers.

rjH) GET down out of the clouds
and a little closer to earth—it's
going to be awful tough tomorrow,
trying to beat California. For in
stance, Blair Hyde is definitely out
of the meet, Thor Peterson, a sure
point-getter in the broad jump, is
st'll bothered by an injury, and
Fiancis Olson, who looked so prom
