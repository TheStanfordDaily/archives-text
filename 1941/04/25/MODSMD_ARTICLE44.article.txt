# OUR MERMEN.
## Most Unfortunate Illness. Championship Meet in L.A. 
### 
Our Varsity Swimming Team, un
der the direction of Norton D.
Thornton, will board one of the
better sections of the San Mateo
Electric and travel to the Southland
tonight for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence Southern Division Champion
ship Meet in the University of
Southern California Swimming Pool
tomorrow.
Their brave leader, Roy Vitousek,
recently was released from the Palo
Alto Hospital, where he has set up
in light housekeeping for the past
two weeks, and will make the trip,
although he will not swim in his
favorite events because of the fact
that Varsity Coach Thornton does
not want to take chances with his
health.
Our Deadly Rivals from across the
Bay (California) are favored to win
the Championship, although if Our
Man Vitousek were able to swim,
we would have a very good chance
Ourselves. It will be unusual for
California to win the Meet, for the
poor lads have never finished better
than third. We are supposed to be
in a tie for second place with the
University of Calfornia at Los An
geles, who have also never finished
better than third. So far, we have
never finished worse than second.
We must try hard.
