# DIAMOND DUEL.
## The 						Baseball Players Play First Year Boys Will Tangle 
### MR. W. ALAN STEIF, '44 
Trying for a sweep of the entire
Little Big Game Series, Stanford's
baseball team of nine Freshmen will
face the Freshman aggregation of
California on the Freshman field at
3:30 o'clock this afternoon.
The Stanford Freshmen should
win the game. They have won the
two contests which have been played
in the last week, defeating the sickly
Cubs 1-0 and 13-4. These scores are
excellent evidence for the belief
that our gallant neophytes will in a
gentlemanly manner conquer the
youngsters from Berkeley.
Mr. Donald Pendergrass, who has
tamed the Cubs on the two previous
occasions of meeting, will no doubt
be in the pitcher's box for Stanford.
His two efforts have been so pretty
that there is no reason to believe
that he cannot win the game that he
will pitch today.
Mr. Harry Shipkey, who directs
the destinies of our Freshman play
ers, should have no worries as he
goes out onto the field with his men.
Mr. Theodore Nell, Mr. Edward
Washburne, Mr. Harry Reichling,
and a large number of other promi
nent first-year men of baseball have
been using their bats very effectively
in the past few days and we believe
that even if California pitches little
Joe Katz, their stellar pitcher, they
will continue this excellent habit.
Good luck, freshmen!
