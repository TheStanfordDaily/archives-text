## Long Journey Across Bay. To Combat Berkeley School. Anticipate A Nice Voyage. California Is Very Strong 
### 
With the odds against them, the
Stanford Indians invade Berkeley
tomorrow for the annual Big Meet.
Cal has one of the greatest teams
in its history, a team that would be
tops in the ".ation if U.S.C. didn't
exist. The Bears are much like the
Stanford team of last spring, with
exceptional strength in the middle
distances and balance in the field
events. Those 1940 Indians saved a
lot of surprises for Cal and walked
away with the meet by 30 points;
but tomorrow the Bears are sup
posed to thoroughly avenge them
selves.
Brutus Hamilton has a squad
built around the talents of three
great runners, Grover Klemmer,
Clarence Barnes, and Dick Peter.
KLEMMER WILL RACE.
Klemmer, whose 47 flat quarter
against Gene Littler last week es
tablished him as the country's fin
est 440 man, will have little trouble
tomorrow. Captain Ernie Clark of
Stanford, plagued with injuries this
year, and Cal's Fay Froom don't
present much of a threat to the big
blond sophomore.
Barnes has only Kai Larsen to
worry about in the half-mile, for
Blair Hyde and Francis Olson are
not in good shape, and teammate
Peter will concentrate on the mile.
Stanford has a chance to pick up
points in the dashes with Johnny
Grant favored to win the hundred
and Don McFarland a possible win
ner in the furlong. Grant has run
9.9, good enough to beat Jim Jurko
vich and Mauxy Shipnuck of Cal.
McFarland could ring up five points
in the 220 if Klemmer sticks to the
quartet and relay.
HE IS FAVORED.
The Bears will present a new
threat tomorrow, in the person of
hurdler Reese, whose mark of 23.8
last week would install him as the
favorite in the lows. Ed Hertel,
along with Vein Hart, should lead
the way in the highs with little
trouble expected from Dick Griffin.
By dint of remarkable come
through performances in key events,
the Indians scored unexpected points
on the field last year. That the In
dians will surprise again this year
seems very improbable.
Bob Stone got off a tremendous
heave of 218 feet last year but his
best practice mark of 195 this sea
son would not indicate repetition of
the feat. Hal Himovitz might give
Bob Biles trouble for a place, while
Martin Biles seems almost a sure
winner on the strength of his toss
of 225 last week.
GREY WILL COMPETE.
A1 Grey, Ed Stamm, and Bob Mil 1—
ington could sweep the shot but
Messrs. Biles and Jurkovich will
have something to say about this.
Last spring Norm Christiansen
came through with a beautiful 24-
foot. jump in the broad; but to
morrow Stanford will be missing one
of its two top-flight jumpers, for
Thor Peterson is on the shelf with a
bad toe. Vic Chambers and Jim
Jurkovich will battle it out for first
and Hanlon Tharp will probably get
in for a third.
The high jump looks all Stanford
with Vern Hart and Jim Lincoln
one-two ahead of Guinn Smith and
Trokey of Cal.
SMITH WILL BE BUSY
Smith will have his hands full in
the pole vault with Stanford's Ed
Tomaso and Russ Peck and team
mate Nichols threatening the 14-
foot mark.
Stanford fans are counting on
Emerson Hiler to come through in
the'discus, although the big weight
man seems to have reached his peak
early this year. His mark of 155
feet tops those of Jurkovich and
Wolf.
It's pretty hard to see a relay
victory for the Indians with Olson
and Hyde not in condition but any
thing may happen with scrappers
like Larsen, Clark and Scrable in
there.
Fans have already agreed that it's
Cal's year in track and field, and
their judgment was certainly sub
stantiated in the second annual re
lays last month. But Pitch Johnson's
boys have made a habit of scoring
more points than the dopesters gave
them, and they could give the Bears
a lot more trouble than Klemmer &
Co. are looking for at Edwards
Field tomorrow.

seems very improbable.
Bob Stone got off a tremendous
heave of 218 feet last year but his
best practice mark of 195 this sea
son would not indicate repetition of
the feat. Hal Himovitz might give
Bob Biles trouble for a place, while
Martin Biles seems almost a sure
winner on the strength of his toss
of 225 last week.
GREY WILL COMPETE.
A1 Grey, Ed Stamm, and Bob Mil 1—
ington could sweep the shot but
Messrs. Biles and Jurkovich will
have something to say about this.
Last spring Norm Christiansen
came through with a beautiful 24-
foot. jump in the broad; but to
morrow Stanford will be missing one
of its two top-flight jumpers, for
Thor Peterson is on the shelf with a
bad toe. Vic Chambers and Jim
Jurkovich will battle it out for first
and Hanlon Tharp will probably get
in for a third.
The high jump looks all Stanford
with Vern Hart and Jim Lincoln
one-two ahead of Guinn Smith and
Trokey of Cal.
SMITH WILL BE BUSY
Smith will have his hands full in
the pole vault with Stanford's Ed
Tomaso and Russ Peck and team
mate Nichols threatening the 14-
foot mark.
Stanford fans are counting on
Emerson Hiler to come through in
the'discus, although the big weight
man seems to have reached his peak
early this year. His mark of 155
feet tops those of Jurkovich and
Wolf.
It's pretty hard to see a relay
victory for the Indians with Olson
and Hyde not in condition but any
thing may happen with scrappers
like Larsen, Clark and Scrable in
there.
Fans have already agreed that it's
Cal's year in track and field, and
their judgment was certainly sub
stantiated in the second annual re
lays last month. But Pitch Johnson's
boys have made a habit of scoring
more points than the dopesters gave
them, and they could give the Bears
a lot more trouble than Klemmer &
Co. are looking for at Edwards
Field tomorrow.
With the odds against them, the
Stanford Indians invade Berkeley
tomorrow for the annual Big Meet.
Cal has one of the greatest teams
in its history, a team that would be
tops in the ".ation if U.S.C. didn't
exist. The Bears are much like the
Stanford team of last spring, with
exceptional strength in the middle
distances and balance in the field
events. Those 1940 Indians saved a
lot of surprises for Cal and walked
away with the meet by 30 points;
but tomorrow the Bears are sup
posed to thoroughly avenge them
selves.
Brutus Hamilton has a squad
built around the talents of three
great runners, Grover Klemmer,
Clarence Barnes, and Dick Peter.
KLEMMER WILL RACE.
Klemmer, whose 47 flat quarter
against Gene Littler last week es
tablished him as the country's fin
est 440 man, will have little trouble
tomorrow. Captain Ernie Clark of
Stanford, plagued with injuries this
year, and Cal's Fay Froom don't
present much of a threat to the big
blond sophomore.
Barnes has only Kai Larsen to
worry about in the half-mile, for
Blair Hyde and Francis Olson are
not in good shape, and teammate
Peter will concentrate on the mile.
Stanford has a chance to pick up
points in the dashes with Johnny
Grant favored to win the hundred
and Don McFarland a possible win
ner in the furlong. Grant has run
9.9, good enough to beat Jim Jurko
vich and Mauxy Shipnuck of Cal.
McFarland could ring up five points
in the 220 if Klemmer sticks to the
quartet and relay.
HE IS FAVORED.
The Bears will present a new
threat tomorrow, in the person of
hurdler Reese, whose mark of 23.8
last week would install him as the
favorite in the lows. Ed Hertel,
along with Vein Hart, should lead
the way in the highs with little
trouble expected from Dick Griffin.
By dint of remarkable come

the Indians scored unexpected points

Cal has one of the greatest teams
in its history, a team that would be
tops in the ".ation if U.S.C. didn't
exist. The Bears are much like the
Stanford team of last spring, with
exceptional strength in the middle
distances and balance in the field
events. Those 1940 Indians saved a
lot of surprises for Cal and walked
away with the meet by 30 points;
but tomorrow the Bears are sup
posed to thoroughly avenge them
selves.
Brutus Hamilton has a squad
built around the talents of three
great runners, Grover Klemmer,
Clarence Barnes, and Dick Peter.
KLEMMER WILL RACE.
Klemmer, whose 47 flat quarter
against Gene Littler last week es
tablished him as the country's fin
est 440 man, will have little trouble
tomorrow. Captain Ernie Clark of
Stanford, plagued with injuries this
year, and Cal's Fay Froom don't
present much of a threat to the big
blond sophomore.
Barnes has only Kai Larsen to
worry about in the half-mile, for
Blair Hyde and Francis Olson are
not in good shape, and teammate
Peter will concentrate on the mile.
Stanford has a chance to pick up
points in the dashes with Johnny
Grant favored to win the hundred
and Don McFarland a possible win
ner in the furlong. Grant has run
9.9, good enough to beat Jim Jurko
vich and Mauxy Shipnuck of Cal.
McFarland could ring up five points
in the 220 if Klemmer sticks to the
quartet and relay.
HE IS FAVORED.
The Bears will present a new
threat tomorrow, in the person of
hurdler Reese, whose mark of 23.8
last week would install him as the
favorite in the lows. Ed Hertel,
along with Vein Hart, should lead
the way in the highs with little
trouble expected from Dick Griffin.
By dint of remarkable come
through performances in key events,
the Indians scored unexpected points
on the field last year. That the In
dians will surprise again this year
seems very improbable.
Bob Stone got off a tremendous
heave of 218 feet last year but his
best practice mark of 195 this sea
son would not indicate repetition of
the feat. Hal Himovitz might give
Bob Biles trouble for a place, while
Martin Biles seems almost a sure
winner on the strength of his toss
of 225 last week.
GREY WILL COMPETE.
A1 Grey, Ed Stamm, and Bob Mil 1—
ington could sweep the shot but
Messrs. Biles and Jurkovich will
have something to say about this.
Last spring Norm Christiansen
came through with a beautiful 24-
foot. jump in the broad; but to
morrow Stanford will be missing one
of its two top-flight jumpers, for
Thor Peterson is on the shelf with a
bad toe. Vic Chambers and Jim
Jurkovich will battle it out for first
and Hanlon Tharp will probably get
in for a third.
The high jump looks all Stanford
with Vern Hart and Jim Lincoln
one-two ahead of Guinn Smith and
Trokey of Cal.
SMITH WILL BE BUSY
Smith will have his hands full in
the pole vault with Stanford's Ed
Tomaso and Russ Peck and team
mate Nichols threatening the 14-
foot mark.
Stanford fans are counting on
Emerson Hiler to come through in
the'discus, although the big weight
man seems to have reached his peak
early this year. His mark of 155
feet tops those of Jurkovich and
Wolf.
It's pretty hard to see a relay
victory for the Indians with Olson
and Hyde not in condition but any
thing may happen with scrappers
like Larsen, Clark and Scrable in
there.
Fans have already agreed that it's
Cal's year in track and field, and
their judgment was certainly sub
stantiated in the second annual re
lays last month. But Pitch Johnson's
boys have made a habit of scoring
more points than the dopesters gave
them, and they could give the Bears
a lot more trouble than Klemmer &
Co. are looking for at Edwards
Field tomorrow.
With the odds against them, the
Stanford Indians invade Berkeley
tomorrow for the annual Big Meet.
