# BASEBALLERS.
## We Encounter California See It after Track Meeting. Qut. Thompson on Mound. 
### J. Pierpont Sontag, '44 
With the Bears holding a one
game lead, Stanford and California
clash tomorrow afternoon on Ed
wards Field, Berkeley, in the second
of the '41 Big Game baseball series,
starting immediately after the In
dian-Cal einderfest. Approximate
time is 3:30 .
Veteran righthander of Coach
Harry Wolter's mound corps, Cootie
Thompson got his last pitching work
out against Santa Clara last Wed
nesday and is set to go today. Cali
fornia's ace on the hill, portsider
Mike Koll, is fast recovering from
last Saturday's facial injury and if
ready will go against Thompson.
The lanky pitcher from across the
Bay broke up a double play against
Stanford Saturday, taking second
baseman Boch Caruso's throw
smack on the upper lip. Stitches had
to be taken, and Koll was removed
to a hospital.
TOILS ON THE KNOLL.
Ed Ruonavaara will toil on the
knoll for Koll if the lefthander isn't
ready to chuck by game time.
Last Wednesday the Cards split a
twin bill matinee with Santa Clara,
winning the opener, 8-3, pushed
along by Thompson's brace of hom
ers and a like number of two-bag
gers, and dropping the nightcap, 7-6.
The same double play jinx that sty
mied the Indians in their initial en
counter with Cal struck again in
the final frame against the Broncs.
After tying it up in the eighth as
Russ Lebeck walked in the tying
runs, Ray Hammett hit into a two
for-one killing after Costello had led
off with a single through the box.
Hammett hit safely in three other
times at bat.
THEY (JO ERRORLESS.
Improvement in infielding was
noticeable Wednesday, the Cards
going errorless throughout. Elton
Boone, besides comnig up with thi'ee
nifty plays at third base, collected
three blows in four attempts in the
first game to follow Thompson in
the hitting department.
At this stage of the game, the
Bears hold a one-game advantage,
with the final game in the series to
be played here one week from to
morrow.
Stanford has overcome its south
paw pitching hex. Hitting Koll for
six last week and Lefty Collins for
12 Wednesday, the old-time left
hand pitching jinx is fading fast for
the Cardinals. Last season Koll
licked the locals three straight.
