# NO SCRUMMAGE.
## Our Lads Will Exercise. Our Varsity Is Now Divided. 
### Mr. R. Wilbur Chandler. '42 
Mr. Clark D. Shaughnessy, our
University's Director of Intercol
legiate Football, has announced to
the Varsity that it will be necessary
for them to wear their full protec
tive equipment for a rather stiff drill
that he has planned for this after
noon. There will be no scrummage,
but the men will perspire harder
than usual, and it is hoped that this
will enable them to get into "con
dition" a wee bit faster.
The entire Varsity Squad has been
divided into two groups, made up of
the Members of the Rose Bowl
Squad in one division and the
younger fellows in the other. At a
conference with the Press last night
it was announced that the arrange
ment is merely temporary and that
it may be changed at any time.
There will be stiff sessions in store
for all of the players all next week,
with practices scheduled for Mon.
through Friday inc. The first scrum
mage of the season will probably
come either Friday-week or Mon
day-week next.
Among those of the younger gen
eration of varsity material that
showed up well in the practices held
Wednesday last could be discerned
the smiling countenances of Mr.
Robert Mitchell and his friends Mr.
Robert Koch and Mr. Randall Faw
cett in the Varsity backfield, and
Mr. Loren LaPrade in the Varsity's
tremendous line.
