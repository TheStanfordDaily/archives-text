# A 						NEW PERIL.
## It Threatens Our Annie The 						Gallant Roughs To Ride. Will They Catch a Villain. We Must Save a Fair Lady 
### 
Shades of East Lynne!
Miss Annie Townsend is threat
ened with a new peril.
And we of the 500 who were go
ing to ride through the Valley of
Death, or were we 600, are not go
ing forth to do battle with The
Clutching Hand. Agony, oh, agony!
That vicious danger which cast its
ugly shadow over the fair brow of
our own vice-president, yea, The
Clutching Hand, it has been way
laid.
ECSTASY AND STUFF.
Oh, joy, oh, happiness and jubi
lation!
For The Clutching Hand has been
dismembered and on this Lovely
Day of Grace resides in a pickled
bottle in Chicago.
No, the 500 will not ride after The
Clutching Hand.
But, the 500 will ride â€” they'll
pound the trails Sunday night with
Clancy of the Mounted.
TO THE RESCUE.
The Gallant Roughs of (he Farm
will ride their Handsome Steeds to
protect the Fair Name of Miss An
nie. Instead of The Clutching Hand
serial, the young lady is periled by
vicious outlaws fleeing from the long
arm of Clancy of the Mounted.
Miss Annie asks each one of her
Noble Men of the West to be present
Sunday night at the Education Au
ditorium with 15 cents for the first,
installment of the Clancy serial.
Also, The Count of Monte Cristo
promises to make a personal ap
pearance. Doors will open at 6:30
for the Roughs, who may bring their
Ladies, courtesy of Miss Annie.
Will Clancy and his 500 save our
Miss Annie from the Clutches of
the Villain?
Will Clancy ride again?
