# CANCELLATION.
## Disappointing Misfortune. Our Tennisters Cannot Play. 
### W. James Coughlin III, '44 
The Daily was informed in the late
hours of yesterday evening by
sources whose information is usu
ally reliable that the contest be
tween the Class of 1944 tennis team
of Leland Stanfoi'd Junior Univer
sity and the young gentleman from
the St. Ignatius High School had
been most unfortunately cancelled.
Circumstances which brought
about this disappointing cancellation
were explained to a representative
of this newspaper by the most gra
cious Mr. Elwyn Bugge, who in the
afternoons offers instructions to
these stalwart and handsome play
ers. As Mr. Bugge told it to your
reporter, the Messrs. C. Zook Sutton
and Donald Salisbury departed re
cently by autocar for a tourney of
tennis at the Thriving little town of
Ojai, which is in the state of Cali
fornia.
HOPES DASHED.
They expressed anticipation of a
most Delightful three-day journey
to that valley. When these young
gentlemen arrive there, they will en
gage in competition with other mem
bers of their Scholastic standing in
tennis doubles as representatives of
our fine University.
Due to this fact and also that Mr.
Emery Rogers, another of the tennis
players, has had a most Horrifying
accident in which he recently frac
tured his wrist while attending a
Skating party at the 18-mile dis
tant town of San Jose with a pert
young miss, Mr. Bugge has decided
it would be much to the Team's
benefit to call off the pending con
test.
SEASON CEASES.
The following Messrs. wore most
disappointed by the forced cancella
tion for they were eager to engage
the St. Ignatius gentlemen in com
bat: B. Wylie, F. Tibbett, G. Kim
ball, R. Hayes, N. Green, R. Hughes.
Everyone in the University will be
Grieved to learn that this fine squad
of players will participate in No
more matches this semester. We con
gratulate them on a delightful, in
spite of several distressing defeats,
season which all enjoyed. We trust
that the University will continue
this body-building sport. I would
also like to thank Mr. Emery Rog
ers for his gracious aid in compiling
this item.
