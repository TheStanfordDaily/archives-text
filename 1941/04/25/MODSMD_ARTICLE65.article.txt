# GOLFING MEN.
## The Stanford Team Wins. They Are Champions Now. Play More Matches Today.
### Mr. A. Sidney Hayes 
It seems thai the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Golf Championships
were to be held at the Stanford golf
course this week-end. Each team
was to cntar a six-man team, and
eight men were to qualify for the
match play championships starling
the next day.
The eight qualifiers included the
entire Stanford golf team, one
lormer Stanfordite now playing for
U.S.C., and one real, thoroughbred
Trojan. Students with the exception
of this aforementioned misfit, this
isn't the Pacific Coast Champion
ships at all, this is merely the pre
view of the Stanford school cham
pionships to bo hold late in May.
As mentioned before two Trojans
are sticking around until at least
j tomorrow. The Bears conceded vic
tory and went home on a bus and
the Bruins lost all their expense
money betting they could break 8(1
and went home on their thumbs.
Gordon Hough and Bud Finger led
the Indian parade today with a total
jof 147 shots. Bud Brownell had 14H
: and the other Indians, Tatum, Berl,
| and Replogle were deadlocked at
j 154.
