TT'S Back to the Farm Day.
1 It's back to the time when the University
acres were fields and meadows, and when the
horse and buggy had not yet given way to the
intricacies of the horseless carriage.
And Farm men and women will climax Con
Home Week with a return to the rustic through
out the day. The note of warning—keep the
horses away from Roble lawn and the Inner
Quad —can mean as much today as it would
have in the days of old.
And, for The Daily, it's back to the days of
the Daily Palo Alto, with the vertical makeup
and oldstyle language of the gay nineties mak
ing a comeback through the news columns.
And here on the edit page, just for a moment
let's give those D.P.A. editors of long ago an
other chance to ride the white horse of a back
page crusade. . . .

THE action of the Freshmen in electing a rep
resentative to the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students simply shows that they
should become acquainted with conditions here
before they take any action of great moment. A
simple reading of the constitution of the student
body should have shown them that Freshmen
have no place in the councils of the wise.
COMPLAINT has been made that the women
of the Freshman class seem to be deplor
ably deficient in any interest in debating, and
that they have not attended any of the meetings
of the new Freshman Debating Society.
Now this is all wrong. The women of the
University should take as much interest in de
bating as men. That they have made as good
debaters our records plainly show. For on sev
eral occasions when Stanford has won, a woman
has been a member of the team. In the face of
these facts, there should be no reason why
the meeting of the Freshman Society tomorrow
night should not have a fair representation of
the feminine members of 1904.
THE football season is over and from the
nature of things we are forced to look ahead
and anticipate a victory in all the other inter
collegiate contests for the year. This is not an
impossibility as every Stanford man will do
his part. Our chances for the intercollegiate de
bate are good, and if every man trains hard and
consistently Berkeley will be surprised on the
field-day. We have an excellent opportunity to
make this a Stanford year, and every one is en
couraged to do his best.
