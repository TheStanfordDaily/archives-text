HEADLINES on last night's San Francisco
newspapers perspired with hidden mean
ing in their large type which said, "F.D. War
Cabinet in Secret Parley."
At best it is difficult in the confusion of today
and the expectations of tomorrow to predict ex
actly what that cabinet meeting will, or is at
tempting to, decide. The best chance bet would
be that our ministers are considering taking
definite and concrete action with regard to a
system of convoying goods to Britain.
Yesterday morning newspapers were alive
with reports that the President was considering
convoying all transport ships as long as they
were within 1,000 miles of our coast.
It's coming closer.
It's coming closer. At the outbreak of Brit
ain's holing-in against Germany's attack, we
merely extended words of good cheer across
the Atlantic. But rapidly, too rapidly, the trans-
Atlantic cable has become a noose around our
necks. Next we sent a few helpful airplanes.
Then more airplanes. Then destroyers. Then
supplies of all sorts.
And still our hands were "clean." Blood can
not splatter across the Atlantic.
Now we are considering convoying Not all
the way, but at least 1,000 miles of the crossing.
How much more distance will be left to the
ports of England? Not much. What can we
send next? What is the next step?
This is not a war-mongery hope. This is, at
once, a statement of fact, a prediction, and a

sprung and that tho noose will not tighten so
that we will be "hanged by the neck until
dead."—B. A.
