# SESSION at THROWING the BULL.

### MATADOR YOSHIUKI ALOYSIUS MAYER 
FOOTNOTES
CAMPUS OPINION yesterday complained vehe
mently of Stanford's "ivory tower" attitude toward
Ihe recent student strike fiasco. The writer bitterly
assailed The Daily for not getting behind the strike.
In case the reader was not aware of the strike
(due to subversive elements within The Daily), an
organization called the "Youth Committee Against War,
of the Keep America Out of War Congress" went to
bat on a plan whereby every American college stu
dent would cut his eleven o'clock class last Wednes
day in protest to the Administration's present foreign
policy.
I wouldn't know, bul I'm willing to wager a quart
of Acme (advertisement) that some big-shot in the
YCAW of the KAOWC had an exam last Wednesday
and just thought this was a good way to get out of it.
I may be wrong, but the mere fact that a person cuts
a class doesn't necessarily show any inbred conviction
concerning the cause of keeping America out of war.
It has been known for students to cut classes to go
out for a quick beer. Personally, it seems commend
able that few Stanford students took advantage of the
"nation-wide" strike to duck out for refreshments.
Convictions are healthy things to have. But they
become perverted when they arc forced along ridicu
lous channels.
■H l|! * *
A GOOD example of this was Senator Gerald P.
Nye's speech in Palo Alto recently. Bull Session
certainly cannot condemn a person for being anti-
Roosevelt, anti-convoy, and anti-English (as Nye is).
It's perfectly all right with us if Nye wants to lour
the country giving his honest opinion concerning tho
national and international state of affairs (for $500 an
appearance). If the anti-convoy forces want a man
like Nye, who is not going to go down in history as a
great legislator or even an inspirational one, to barn
storm for them, fine and good.
But when Mr. Nye tells his audience that if the
Republicans had known Wendell Willkie's true colors
they would have voted for Norman Thomas, that is
carrying things too far. Perhaps Mr. Nye didn't realize
that he was speaking in the ultra-conservative com
munity of Palo Alto where 90 per cent of the voters
wouldn't vote for Norman Thomas if Willkie and
Roosevelt had dropped dead the night before election.
J»« * * #
nights ago Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh told
an "America First" rally in New York "it is now
obvious that England is losing the war." Which seems
apparent from foreign dispatches. But when the audi
ence breaks loose with a barrage of applause and
cheers at, that statement, one wonders whether the
meeting isn't misnamed when it is called "America
First."
I'm just an average American willing to be con
vinced on either side of the dilemma on which the
American public is now posed. But cutting a class I
probably would have cut anyway, listening to a man
tell me Republicans would have voted for Norman
Thomas, hearing that a New York audience, claiming
to represent "America First," applauds a probable
German victory, hardly strikes me as an irrefutable
argument against our present foreign policy.
There are a lot of persons like me. We'd all like
to have our minds made up—one way or another. But
we wish the isolationists would give us credit for hav
ing minds.

ence breaks loose with a barrage of applause and
cheers at, that statement, one wonders whether the
meeting isn't misnamed when it is called "America
First."
I'm just an average American willing to be con
vinced on either side of the dilemma on which the
American public is now posed. But cutting a class I
probably would have cut anyway, listening to a man
tell me Republicans would have voted for Norman
Thomas, hearing that a New York audience, claiming
to represent "America First," applauds a probable
German victory, hardly strikes me as an irrefutable
argument against our present foreign policy.
There are a lot of persons like me. We'd all like
to have our minds made up—one way or another. But
we wish the isolationists would give us credit for hav
ing minds.

FOOTNOTES
CAMPUS OPINION yesterday complained vehe
mently of Stanford's "ivory tower" attitude toward
Ihe recent student strike fiasco. The writer bitterly
assailed The Daily for not getting behind the strike.
In case the reader was not aware of the strike
(due to subversive elements within The Daily), an
organization called the "Youth Committee Against War,
of the Keep America Out of War Congress" went to
bat on a plan whereby every American college stu
dent would cut his eleven o'clock class last Wednes
day in protest to the Administration's present foreign
policy.
I wouldn't know, bul I'm willing to wager a quart
of Acme (advertisement) that some big-shot in the
YCAW of the KAOWC had an exam last Wednesday
and just thought this was a good way to get out of it.
I may be wrong, but the mere fact that a person cuts
a class doesn't necessarily show any inbred conviction
concerning the cause of keeping America out of war.
It has been known for students to cut classes to go
out for a quick beer. Personally, it seems commend
able that few Stanford students took advantage of the
"nation-wide" strike to duck out for refreshments.
Convictions are healthy things to have. But they
become perverted when they arc forced along ridicu
lous channels.
■H l|! * *
A GOOD example of this was Senator Gerald P.
Nye's speech in Palo Alto recently. Bull Session
certainly cannot condemn a person for being anti-
Roosevelt, anti-convoy, and anti-English (as Nye is).
It's perfectly all right with us if Nye wants to lour
the country giving his honest opinion concerning tho
national and international state of affairs (for $500 an
appearance). If the anti-convoy forces want a man
like Nye, who is not going to go down in history as a
great legislator or even an inspirational one, to barn
storm for them, fine and good.
But when Mr. Nye tells his audience that if the
Republicans had known Wendell Willkie's true colors
they would have voted for Norman Thomas, that is
carrying things too far. Perhaps Mr. Nye didn't realize
that he was speaking in the ultra-conservative com
munity of Palo Alto where 90 per cent of the voters
wouldn't vote for Norman Thomas if Willkie and
Roosevelt had dropped dead the night before election.
