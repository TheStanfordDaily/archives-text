The Stanford Band will make its
annual appearance at the Stanford
Mothers' Club Tea at the home of
Mrs. Charles G. Lathrop, which is
located immediately behind the lake
and in a large grove of trees. Mrs.
Lathrop gives this tea every year for
the Mothers' Club.
The Band, under the direction of
Mr. Charles R. Bubb, Jr., will play
several numbers in this, their first
appearance of the quarter. This will
be the first in a series of concerts
and the start of an ambitious pro
gram which will include concerts at
the Boathouse. The Band will begin
to play at 3:15 o'clock.
