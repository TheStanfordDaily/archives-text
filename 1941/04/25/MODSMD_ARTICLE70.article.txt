# The OPINION of the CAMPUS.
## WHO WEARS THE PANTS? 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Please, can you tell me why our dear administra
tion frowns on the wearing of gym bloomers in the
Union Cellar and on Quad? It seems to me that, with
the recent emancipation of womanhood, we should be
allowed to dress as we please. Women no longer
should be shrinking violets. Of course, we should al
ways preserve our innate modesty, and you know that
Stanford women will do that. Mr. Editor.
But, I think that we women should bo freed to
the extent of wearing what we please around the
campus. After all, we are old enough to be college
women. Most of us have been brought up in atmos
pheres of culture and refinement. We should, in short,
be allowed to act on our own discretion when it comes
to what is proper as wearing apparel.
Besides, the wearing of gym bloomers is a kind of
symbol of our new freedom. Really, sir, it makes it
apparent to everyone that our political rights are
equal to those of our menfoiks. Please print this let
ter in your column. I am sure the ladies and gentle
men alike will agree with me.
I am, respectfully yours,
Miss Arabella Coralu Murgatroid
