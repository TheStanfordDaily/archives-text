# STAY OUT OF THE HILLS

### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
Every Daily editor has a crusade. Thus far in
this column we have seen no signs of even the seed of
a crusade. So may we make this suggestion?
Along with the Farm's rehabilitation program, road
reconstruction, 50th Anniversary, and proposed fra
ternity mother plan, why not have a campaign
to weed out. the poison oak in the foothills?
Not only is the poison oak which flourishes back
in the hills a health menace, but it has cut down de
cidedly on Stanford's social activities.
My girl and I went for a ride Saturday night. Sun
day, we both had poison oak. What kind of a date do
you call that?
Hundreds of Stanford students; arc in exactly the
same predicament. And the Palo Alto drug stores are
running out of calamine lotion. But still the filthy
weed is allowed to grow and grow.
So why not start a crusade, Mr. Editor, to clean
up the hills for the kiddies?
