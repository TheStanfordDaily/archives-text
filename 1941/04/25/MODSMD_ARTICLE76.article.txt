# A 						MONUMENT.
## Scholars Remove Grasses. Miss Bailey Inspires Classes. 
### 
Inspired by a lecture heard in one
of M ss Margery Bailey's classes, a
group of Stanford students yester
day cleaned away the grasses which
have grown up around the tall white'
cement monument which was Le
land Stanford Jr.'s first resting place.
The monument is about 50 yards
from the Convalescent Home and
could be seen from the widows of
the old Stanford home. For several
years now it has been neglected,
but it has not been forgotten by those
who have watched Stanford grow.
Armed with rakes, clippers, and
hoes, a group of students including
Bob Mostow and Student Body
President Bruce Jessup yesterday
cleared the ground around the mon
ument as a part of the labor at the
Convalescent Home.
