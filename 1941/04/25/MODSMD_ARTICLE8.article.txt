Stanford University, Cal., Jan. IG,
1921.â€”Plans for proposed addition
to Encina Hall, one of the men's
dormitories here, for the purpose of
providing dining room accommoda
tions for 400 students, have been ap
proved, and work on the structure
will commence shortly.
The new biulding will be a one
story structure extending the length
of the present hall, and connected
with each of the present rear en
trances. There will be six dining
roms, with intervening courts, with
a capacity of about 40 each, and two
large dining rooms. The dining
rooms will be arranged with courts
between them in such a way as to
afford abundant windows for light
and ventilation.
