### Jean Nowell 
YESTERDAY Winston Churchill
made a speech. It was a good
speech, as all his speeches are, full
of facts, common sense, and with no
attempt to minimize grave situa
tions. This time he spoke to the
Isles, the Empire, and the United
States, at a time when Germany's
victorious armies were marching
into Athens. And he had plenty to
say.
The British army has evacuated
Greece; Churchill did not state how
many got out. And while he ex
plained the English attitude on the
whole Greek affair, he stated defi
nitely that, in his opinion, the out
come of the war still depends on
the Island —and Hitler's chances of
taking it. In a word, the Battle of
the Atlantic.
Much of what he had to say was
directed specifically at the United
States. For instance, when Prime
Minister Churchill says he is con
fident that the American people
will not "he frustrated and allow
the materials they manufactured
to he sent to the bottom of the
sea," he as good as handed us the
Battle of the Atlantic on a plat
ter. Not in so many words of
course, hut just the same Church
ill is a clear-sighted man fully
cognizant of the fact that Amer
ica's "seven-seas if necessary
patrol" is within a hair-line of the
final step to convoys.
Though he made no apologies for
the Greek fiasco, many of his words
were obviously designed to calm
down the excited Anzae dominions.
Contrary to the laborite's claims in
Australia, he said that the Expedi
tionary force in Greece was sent
wilh the full consent of both the
Australian and New Zealand gov
ernments. He then denied the al
legation that the entire B.E.F. in
Greece was made up of the boys
from "down under." Actually "about
half the troops in Greece were from
the mother country," he said.

Vkf/'HEN he revealed that only two
divisions were used during last
winter's advance to Benghasi in
Libya, he indicated by inference the
immense superiority of the Army of
the Nile to the Italian forces who
had them terrifically outnumbered.
When the Libyan army was strip
ped for service in Greece, it is small
wonder that a numerically superior
German force could drive them back
so quickly.

If some Americans have been
assuming from (he events of the
past month that the Mediterranean
and Near Eastern events will de
cide the war before this country is
drawn into the conflict in all-out
fact, Churchill spiked their hopes
yesterday. It is now clear that the
war will go on until the British
Isles fall, unless Churchill is
forced out of the government.

Speaking with the voice of proph
esy or perhaps hope (in the case of
Russia) he predicted "fierce and
widespread" war in the Mediterra
nean which may spread to Spain,
Morocco, and the Soviet. It takes
little foresight to predict most of
these events. Morocco and Spain
mean an attack on Gibraltar. Tur
key means an attempt to get at the
Eastern oil fields and Suez.
a»» # *
the case of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics is a
little different. Russia has enough
oil to supply both herself and Ger
many if she so chooses. And the
huge Ukrainian wheat fields are
vital to Hitler's problem of food for
conquered Europe. If Stalin balks
at further co-operation Hitler must
either give up the wheat, or fight the
Soviets.

Finland did not really test the
might of the Red Army since only
border troops were used during the
first two months of the fight. How
ever, even if the Russians aren't as
good fighters as Hitler's men, there
are so many of them that they should
constitute a problem simply through
sheer weight of numbers. Look at
what happened to Napoleon. Small
wonder that England seeks to bring
the Soviets into the conflict on her
side.

the Island —and Hitler's chances of

the Atlantic.
Much of what he had to say was
directed specifically at the United
States. For instance, when Prime
Minister Churchill says he is con
fident that the American people
will not "he frustrated and allow
the materials they manufactured
to he sent to the bottom of the
sea," he as good as handed us the
Battle of the Atlantic on a plat

course, hut just the same Church
ill is a clear-sighted man fully
cognizant of the fact that Amer
ica's "seven-seas if necessary
patrol" is within a hair-line of the
final step to convoys.
Though he made no apologies for
the Greek fiasco, many of his words
were obviously designed to calm
down the excited Anzae dominions.
Contrary to the laborite's claims in
Australia, he said that the Expedi
tionary force in Greece was sent
wilh the full consent of both the
Australian and New Zealand gov
ernments. He then denied the al
legation that the entire B.E.F. in
Greece was made up of the boys
from "down under." Actually "about
half the troops in Greece were from
the mother country," he said.

Vkf/'HEN he revealed that only two
divisions were used during last
winter's advance to Benghasi in
Libya, he indicated by inference the
immense superiority of the Army of
the Nile to the Italian forces who
had them terrifically outnumbered.
When the Libyan army was strip
ped for service in Greece, it is small
wonder that a numerically superior
German force could drive them back
so quickly.

If some Americans have been
assuming from (he events of the
past month that the Mediterranean
and Near Eastern events will de
cide the war before this country is
drawn into the conflict in all-out
fact, Churchill spiked their hopes
yesterday. It is now clear that the
war will go on until the British
Isles fall, unless Churchill is
forced out of the government.

Speaking with the voice of proph
esy or perhaps hope (in the case of
Russia) he predicted "fierce and
widespread" war in the Mediterra
nean which may spread to Spain,
Morocco, and the Soviet. It takes
little foresight to predict most of
these events. Morocco and Spain
mean an attack on Gibraltar. Tur
key means an attempt to get at the
Eastern oil fields and Suez.

the case of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics is a
little different. Russia has enough
oil to supply both herself and Ger
many if she so chooses. And the
huge Ukrainian wheat fields are
vital to Hitler's problem of food for
conquered Europe. If Stalin balks
at further co-operation Hitler must
either give up the wheat, or fight the
Soviets.

Finland did not really test the
might of the Red Army since only
border troops were used during the
first two months of the fight. How
ever, even if the Russians aren't as
good fighters as Hitler's men, there
are so many of them that they should
constitute a problem simply through
sheer weight of numbers. Look at

Though he made no apologies for
the Greek fiasco, many of his words
were obviously designed to calm
down the excited Anzae dominions.
Contrary to the laborite's claims in
Australia, he said that the Expedi
tionary force in Greece was sent
wilh the full consent of both the
Australian and New Zealand gov
ernments. He then denied the al
legation that the entire B.E.F. in
Greece was made up of the boys
from "down under." Actually "about
half the troops in Greece were from
the mother country," he said.

Vkf/'HEN he revealed that only two
divisions were used during last
winter's advance to Benghasi in
Libya, he indicated by inference the
immense superiority of the Army of
the Nile to the Italian forces who
had them terrifically outnumbered.
When the Libyan army was strip

wonder that a numerically superior
German force could drive them back
so quickly.

If some Americans have been
assuming from (he events of the
past month that the Mediterranean
and Near Eastern events will de
cide the war before this country is
drawn into the conflict in all-out
fact, Churchill spiked their hopes
yesterday. It is now clear that the
war will go on until the British
Isles fall, unless Churchill is
forced out of the government.

Speaking with the voice of proph
esy or perhaps hope (in the case of
Russia) he predicted "fierce and
widespread" war in the Mediterra
nean which may spread to Spain,
Morocco, and the Soviet. It takes
little foresight to predict most of
these events. Morocco and Spain
mean an attack on Gibraltar. Tur
key means an attempt to get at the
Eastern oil fields and Suez.

the case of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics is a
little different. Russia has enough
oil to supply both herself and Ger
many if she so chooses. And the
huge Ukrainian wheat fields are
vital to Hitler's problem of food for
conquered Europe. If Stalin balks
at further co-operation Hitler must
either give up the wheat, or fight the
Soviets.

Finland did not really test the
might of the Red Army since only
border troops were used during the
first two months of the fight. How
ever, even if the Russians aren't as
good fighters as Hitler's men, there
are so many of them that they should
constitute a problem simply through
sheer weight of numbers. Look at
what happened to Napoleon. Small
wonder that England seeks to bring
the Soviets into the conflict on her
side.
YESTERDAY Winston Churchill
made a speech. It was a good
speech, as all his speeches are, full
of facts, common sense, and with no
attempt to minimize grave situa
tions. This time he spoke to the
Isles, the Empire, and the United
States, at a time when Germany's
victorious armies were marching
into Athens. And he had plenty to
say.
The British army has evacuated
Greece; Churchill did not state how
many got out. And while he ex
plained the English attitude on the
whole Greek affair, he stated defi
nitely that, in his opinion, the out
come of the war still depends on
the Island —and Hitler's chances of
taking it. In a word, the Battle of
the Atlantic.
Much of what he had to say was
directed specifically at the United
States. For instance, when Prime
Minister Churchill says he is con
fident that the American people
will not "he frustrated and allow
the materials they manufactured
to he sent to the bottom of the
sea," he as good as handed us the
Battle of the Atlantic on a plat
ter. Not in so many words of
course, hut just the same Church
ill is a clear-sighted man fully
cognizant of the fact that Amer
ica's "seven-seas if necessary
patrol" is within a hair-line of the
final step to convoys.
