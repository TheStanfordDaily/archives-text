# A.T.'s Kiddy Movie Draws Mirthful Mob
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Clancy of the Mounted is after his
man, the villain is a heel, and the
heroine is vaulting over a tumbling
cataract of the Northwest in a frail
canoe—in short, the serial, the car
toon, and the Count of Monte Cristo
packed a full house into the first
Sunday evening movie of the quar
ter last night.

The Sunday clambake in the
Education Auditorium, which was
not quite ventilated properly, got
off with a bang when that Jack of
All Trades, That Obstetrician of The
Mounted, our own Clance, galloped
up in the nick of time to deliver a
baby to his sister-in-law. When the
audience, waiting with baited breath,
was finally rewarded a glimpse of
the Bundle from Heaven, the guy
with a draft conscience in the front
row brought down the house as he
shrieked:
"Cannon fodder!"
But back to Clance—his man is
his own brother!
Next week — see brother against
brother.
Will Clancy ride again?
