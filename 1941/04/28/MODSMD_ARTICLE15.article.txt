# Daily Proposes Central Lost, Found Agency
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Itohlc Sue lost her pen.
Without said pen, Sue is in a had
way, for how is she to write letters
or blue hooks? So, courageously, she
sets out to find her little preen pen.
And she needs courage. First, she
hikes to the Administration Build
ing—Lost and Found Depot No. 1.
No luek. Next, to the Main Libe.
Still no luck. Then, to the A.S.S.U.
office; lots of pens but not the little
green one.
Slightly fagged but still un
daunted, Sue starts making the
rounds of some 35 lost and found
agencies—every department secre
tary serves as an unofficial one.
SOLUTION OFFERED
To aid Sue, the little Injun in the
cartoon who has lost his other
feather, and every student who some
time or other faces the torture of
trying to retrieve lost articles, The
Daily presents a solution to the lost
and found dilemma.
Solution: One centralized lost and
found department to be located in
Room 15 of the Old Union, the Co
op book store, and administered by
the students working in the Co-op.
Supervised by the A.S.S.U., the
four major lost and found depart
ments now operating will be merged
into one. Students will deliver ar
ticles they find and call for lost
ones at this one agency, rather than
the many currently operating.
CO-OP CO-OPERATES
However, articles found in the
Libe, Ad Building, 8.A.C., Cellar, or
•at the various depaztments will be
left there during the day it is found,
so students may check where the
articles were lost.
Periodically, as often as necessary,
articles will be collected and brought
to the main office. Department sec
retaries or others may call the cen
tral office and a collector will pick
up the article.
Suggested by The Daily, the Board
of Directors of the Co-Op Book Ex
change has expressed its willingness
to administer the lost and found
agency and has offered the Co-op
Book Store, in the Old Union, as
the depot for tost and found articles.
In addition, the -ocop organiza
tion will furnish collectors to can
vas the campus for lost articles,
will keep a file system, and will
generally administer the agency.
Further, The Daily will publish
each week a list of found articles.
If the proposal is adopted by the
students of Stanford through Ex
Committee, Roble Sue, the little In
jun, or members of the student body
will no longer have to dash madly
about the campus in search of lost
articles.

No luek. Next, to the Main Libe.
Still no luck. Then, to the A.S.S.U.
office; lots of pens but not the little
green one.
Slightly fagged but still un
daunted, Sue starts making the
rounds of some 35 lost and found
agencies—every department secre

SOLUTION OFFERED
To aid Sue, the little Injun in the
cartoon who has lost his other
feather, and every student who some
time or other faces the torture of
trying to retrieve lost articles, The
Daily presents a solution to the lost
and found dilemma.
Solution: One centralized lost and
found department to be located in
Room 15 of the Old Union, the Co
op book store, and administered by
the students working in the Co-op.
Supervised by the A.S.S.U., the
four major lost and found depart
ments now operating will be merged
into one. Students will deliver ar
ticles they find and call for lost
ones at this one agency, rather than
the many currently operating.
CO-OP CO-OPERATES
However, articles found in the
Libe, Ad Building, 8.A.C., Cellar, or
•at the various depaztments will be
left there during the day it is found,
so students may check where the
articles were lost.
Periodically, as often as necessary,
articles will be collected and brought
to the main office. Department sec
retaries or others may call the cen
tral office and a collector will pick
up the article.
Suggested by The Daily, the Board
of Directors of the Co-Op Book Ex
change has expressed its willingness
to administer the lost and found
agency and has offered the Co-op
Book Store, in the Old Union, as
the depot for tost and found articles.
In addition, the -ocop organiza
tion will furnish collectors to can
vas the campus for lost articles,
will keep a file system, and will
generally administer the agency.
Further, The Daily will publish
each week a list of found articles.
If the proposal is adopted by the
students of Stanford through Ex
Committee, Roble Sue, the little In
jun, or members of the student body
will no longer have to dash madly
about the campus in search of lost
articles.
