# Prom Bid Sale Starts Today
## 
### 
Bids for the yearly "big name
danee of spring quarter," the Jun
ior Prom, will go on sale this after
noon at 1 o'clock in the Associated
Students office.

The dance will feature the smooth
music of Glen Gray, who with his
Casa Loma orchestra has recently
completed successful engagements at
Southern California's newest danc
ing spot, the Palladium, and San
Francisco's Palace Hotel.

This annual spring formal event
will be held in the Pavilion this
Friday evening from 9 until 1. Dress
will be formal for the women and
optional for the men.

Five hundred bids have been
printed to sell at $u.50, and dance
chairman Sandy Tatum stated last
night that as soon as those were
gone no more would be printed.
