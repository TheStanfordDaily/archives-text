# Quartet Shows Melodic Tastes
## Program Features Milhaud's Piece 
### 
The Pro Arte Quartet gave an
excellent and varied program yes
terday afternoon, featuring the Ninth
Quartet by the contemporary com
poser, Darius Milhaud. Differing
from the usual modern quartet, this
one seemed well suited to its me
dium, and not like an orchestral suite
or symphony squeezed into four in
struments.
It was quite melodic and not very
discordant in the first movement,
very pleasant and easy to listen to.
The second movement fitted its
name, "Anime," and was much more
discordant. But in the last move
ment, described as 'Decide," the
music became definite and stimu
lating.
In this movement the first violin
played a definite melody, against a
violently discordant, strident ac
companiment. It moved forward
with a sort of relentless, yet con
fused, minor quality. Mr. Milhaud,
who was present in the audience,
was called upon the stage to take a
bow with the members of the quar
tet.
The Beethoven, Quartet in E Flat
Major, Opus 74, was beautifully
played. It was almost modern in
spots, but always complete and
seemingly perfectly constructed.
Tie "Presto" movement was so
rhythmic it was almost danceable.

A spider doesn't get caught in its
own web because it keeps its legs
covered with a film of oil to pre
vent sticking.
