A lecture on Christian Science,
entitled "Christian Science: The Sci
ence of Existence," was delivered in
Women's Clubhouse Auditorium
April 24, under the auspices of
Christian Science Organization of
Stanford University. Dr. Hendrik J.
de Lange, C.5.8., of Now York City,
was the lecturer. Dr. de Lange is a
member of the Board of Lecture
ship of The Mother Church, The
First Church of Christ, Scientist, iil
[ Boston, Massachusetts.
Here follow a number of points
the lecturer made:
In conformity with the Bible, the
oneness and allness of God is ac
cepted in Christian Science as the
fundamental truth of existence, and
thereby the nature of everything
that really, scientifically exists. Mrs.
Eddy's spirituality made her per
ceive that allness necessitates infi
nite self-perpetuity and therefore
cannot contain an element contrary
to its own infinity and eternality.
Thus the Discoverer and Founder of
Christian Science discerned the en
tire goodness of God. Divine all
ness being basic and true, whatever
appears as contrary to God's na
ture — presented by material sense
testimony — must be classified as
baseless and false.
God being All and thereby con
stituting all reality, the divine status
of man is to be found, exclusively,
as the knowledge or idea of God.
The striking but unavoidable con
clusion reached at this point is that
man and real existence are virtually
identical. In this understanding are
I infinite possibilities for redemption,
health, prosperity, happiness. It en
ables one to be freed from every
thing, every belief unlike God or
supreme good.
Divine power becomes available in
the Christian Science treatment —
the affirmation of Truth and the
denial of error. It is divine activ
ity, having nothing to do with hu
man will power or suggestion. Christ
Jesus was the great Exemplar of
this divine activity, which is the
eternal, ever-present Christ. His
works, far from being miracles, were
an exemplification of divine power.
Nowadays these works of healing
and redemption abound in the lives
of Christian Scientists. Scientifi
cally regarded, they are not human
or material. They are the fuller
appearance of that which man al
ready divinely is as l'eal existence.
Human or mortal mind is the
collective name used in Christian
Sicence for beliefs — for whatever
has no divine or substantial exist
ence. Since the one and only Mind
is divine, human or mortal mind is
a nonentity, a deception, a negation.
The supposed activity of mortal
mind is defined as animal mag
netism or hypnotism ,rampant in
a material sense of existence. It
assumes nowadays the disguise of
aggressive nationalism, using mass
hypnotism as one of its main weap
ons in subduing nations. The only
system actually able to deal suc
cessfully with the "murderer* from
the beginning" is Christian Science.
Countersuggestion and mere reli
gious faith can neger accomplish it.
since they both accept the reality
of evil and the plurality of man.
As the cradle of Christian Sci
ence, the United States of America
has an important part in the work
of world regeneration. This country
stands for the furtherance and pro
tection of true freedom, exemplified
by man divinely self-governed. The
mission of Christian Science and the
mission of the United States of
America concur in this enlightened
purpose.
Existence is Science
By fundamentally living this Sci
] once of Existence .the Christian Sci
entist is experiencing his divine
selfhood—existence as it really is.
Hereby he is benefiting humanity
by spiritually expressing 111 every
day life the beauty of existence, its
liberty, nobility, joy; its bounty,
blessedness, and progressive unfold
ment. (adv.)
