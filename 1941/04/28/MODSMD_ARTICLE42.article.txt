The (rack and field forces of Stanford fell apart before the onslaught of
a great California team Saturday. *
The Indians, failing to win a single first place, absorbed the second
worst healing in Stanford's Rig Meet history ))7 :! i to 111}' i. The Bears,
sparked onward by an inspired Jim Jurkovich. rose to their highest

peak, smashing five meet records,
and running up a point total far
beyond the expectations of even the
most optimistic California prognos
tics tors.
Dick Peter started it off in the
opening event, shattering Paul
'Moore's old mile record with a
beautiful 4:11.5 race, a sweep for
Cal. Then Grover Klemmer loafed
to another meet record in the quar
ter, winning easily in 47.fi from Fay
Froom and Ernie Clark.
DOPE UPSET
The dope on the hundred was
completely upset as Jurkovich ran
the greatest race of his life in 9.8.
Johnny Grant, the favorite, took
third behind Murray Shipnuck.
Sailing out 24 feet, 9 inches, Jur
kovich chalked up another five
points in the broad jump. But Vic-
Chambers was only three inches be
hind him for the Indians' only out
standing performance of the day.
Emerson Hiler tied up in the dis
cus. Barney Wolf won with a toss
of 150 feet, which Hiler has bet
tered on many occasions this season.
HIGH JUMP SURPRISE
Guinn Smith pulled a surprise
when he cleared G-5 to whip Vern
Hart and Jim Lincoln in the high
jump,, Smith doubled up in the pole
vault, clearing 14-3 for an easy win.
Martin Biles set a new meet mark
in (he javelin with a toss of 222 feet
and Clarence Barnes, co-captain of
the Bears, ran 1:52.3 for another new
record.
Stanford's Ed Hertel, favored to 1
win the high hurdles, got himself i
all tangled up in the third flight and I
Cal went on to sweep the event.
A lot of things went wrong for <
Stanford but the power and balance j
of the Bears could have crushed '
anyone Saturday.
