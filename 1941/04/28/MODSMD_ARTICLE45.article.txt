# Cards Succumb Again to Tenth-Inning Jinx, 4-3
## 
### 
Cootie Thompson had the Indian
sign on Mike Koll Saturday—but
again that tenth-inning hex caught
up with the big Stanford right
hander as it did last week, and the
Bears took their second straight vic
tory in the Big Game series, 4-3.
The Koll-'Thompson feudin' didn't
materialize until the ninth inning,
after the Cards had sent Fred Kirt
lan to the showers with a three-run
outburst in the eighth. The Cal
portsider went to the mound in the
last half of the eighth with two out,
and the tying run was scored off
him with a nifty double steal.
The inning went like this: Elton
Boone homered into deep left field
for the first score off Kirtland. Russ
Smith, pinch-hitting for Purkitt,
took an Annie Oakley to first, Alec
Cereghino struck out, and Thomp
son, pinching for Cookie South,
drew a free pass to put runners on
first and second.
DOUBLE STEAL
Hal Costello fled out to center,
Smith and Thompson moving to
second and third. Boch Caruso
smacked a clean single into right
field, scoring Smith, and Thompson
pulled up at third. Koll came in to
stem the tide with two down, but
Coach Harry Wolter ordered a
double steal, and as Carl Hoberg
heaved the ball down to Alva Mc-
Broom at second, Thompson scored
from third with the tying run. Koll
struck out Ray Hammett to end the
inning.
Thompson got into hot water in
Cal's half of the ninth and out again
after the bases were loaded with
none out. He walked Meßroom and
Ken Norris, and Koll was safe at
first as Boone's throw and Mr. Koll
arrived at first at precisely the same
time? Hammett dropped the ball in
the scuffle to populate the pillows.
MOWS 'EM DOWN
Dick David came up to bat for
Edide Ongerth, and went down via
the strikeout route. Stan Griffith
tried to bunt twice and finally pop
ped out, and Thompson forced Jack
Albright to do likewise on a lofty
one to Jack Parsons in right field.
Koll retired the Indians one-two
three in their half of the tenth, and
then the tenth-inning jinx hit
Thompson,

Hoberg singled and stole second.
Ray Amling walloped a long fly that
Costello got his hands on but drop
ped to put the winning run on
third. Hal Cates sent a long fly up
to center field, and Hoberg tallied
after the catch with the run that
broke up the game. Tomorrow the
two teams play the final encounter
of the series.

inning.
Thompson got into hot water in
Cal's half of the ninth and out again
after the bases were loaded with
none out. He walked Meßroom and
Ken Norris, and Koll was safe at
first as Boone's throw and Mr. Koll
arrived at first at precisely the same
time? Hammett dropped the ball in
the scuffle to populate the pillows.
MOWS 'EM DOWN
Dick David came up to bat for
Edide Ongerth, and went down via
the strikeout route. Stan Griffith
tried to bunt twice and finally pop
ped out, and Thompson forced Jack
Albright to do likewise on a lofty
one to Jack Parsons in right field.
Koll retired the Indians one-two
three in their half of the tenth, and
then the tenth-inning jinx hit
Thompson,

Hoberg singled and stole second.
Ray Amling walloped a long fly that
Costello got his hands on but drop
ped to put the winning run on
third. Hal Cates sent a long fly up
to center field, and Hoberg tallied
after the catch with the run that
broke up the game. Tomorrow the
two teams play the final encounter
of the series.

Cootie Thompson had the Indian
sign on Mike Koll Saturday—but
again that tenth-inning hex caught
up with the big Stanford right
hander as it did last week, and the
Bears took their second straight vic
tory in the Big Game series, 4-3.
The Koll-'Thompson feudin' didn't
materialize until the ninth inning,
after the Cards had sent Fred Kirt
lan to the showers with a three-run
outburst in the eighth. The Cal
portsider went to the mound in the
last half of the eighth with two out,
and the tying run was scored off
him with a nifty double steal.
The inning went like this: Elton
Boone homered into deep left field
for the first score off Kirtland. Russ
Smith, pinch-hitting for Purkitt,
took an Annie Oakley to first, Alec
Cereghino struck out, and Thomp
son, pinching for Cookie South,
drew a free pass to put runners on
first and second.
DOUBLE STEAL
Hal Costello fled out to center,
Smith and Thompson moving to
second and third. Boch Caruso
smacked a clean single into right
field, scoring Smith, and Thompson
pulled up at third. Koll came in to
stem the tide with two down, but
Coach Harry Wolter ordered a
double steal, and as Carl Hoberg
heaved the ball down to Alva Mc-
Broom at second, Thompson scored
from third with the tying run. Koll
struck out Ray Hammett to end the
inning.
