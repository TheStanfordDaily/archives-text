# Cubs Nose Out Frosh Nine, 5-4
## 
### 
Failing to ocme through twice in
the later innings with men on base,
Stanford's freshman baseballers lost
to the Cal yearlings 5-4 at Berkeley
Saturday morning.
Larry Wolf, the big Seattle boy :
who has done a consistent hurling |
job all season, started and in the
first inning gave up all five of Cal's
runs. This was due mainly to his
j own nervousness. He walked three
men in the first frame and these
walks, between which were sand
wiched two Cal hits, were enough
to furnish the Cubs with their mar
gin of victory. After the first inn
ing Larry settled down and pitched
beautiful ball as is indicated by the
fact that Cal got a total of only five
hits over the whole route.
The Papooses got all of their runs
in the first two innings, chalking up
two scores in the first and two in
the second frame.
Coach Harry Shipkey's nine, de
spite Saturday's defeat, winds up its
j year with an enviable record. It has i
not lost a half dozen contests over |
the season and in addition has taken j
the Little Big Game Series by a 2-1
edge.
