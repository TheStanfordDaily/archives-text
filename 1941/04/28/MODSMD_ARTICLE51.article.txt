# Frosh Trackmen Defeat Cal, Setting All-Sport Supremacy
## 
### 
For the first time in eight years,
Stanford's freshman track team de
feated California, scoring a decisive
72 to 59 victory over the Bear Cubs
j Friday afternoon on Angell Field,
j The Papoose cinder win also marked
the first time in 14 years that the
! yearlings have topped California in
j all four major sports—football, bas
ketball, baseball, and track.
Double wins by Bob Waters, Don
Reiss, and Bob Compton highlighted
the Papoose victory. Waters came
through as expected in both sprints
with clean-cut wins over Tom
Couch, Bear dashman, in 9.8 and
21.7. But his two points for a tie
for second in the high jump were
I entirely unexpected. Waters had
J not high-jumped since his high
j school days.
But the surprise star of the meet
was lanky Bob Compton, 6-foot-2
distance man, who won both the
j mile and two-mile. Despite a mix
; up in starting times, which allowed
j him insufficient time to warm up, he
1 walked away with the mile in 4:36.5.
He came back later to run his first
' two-mile of the year and staved off
j Don Graney's challenge to win in
I 10:42.8.
Reiss came through as expected,
winning the high hurdles in 15.1 and
the low sticks in 24.6. His high
hurdle mark of 15.1 was a half sec
ond faster than the winning time in
Saturday's Big Meet.
