# Lost and Foundling
## 
### 
IT'S rather odd the way that things that seem
insignificant are allowed to slide and to slide
until suddenly they're so infernally complicated
that something big has got to be done to make
them work again.
That's the way it's been with the lost and
found question. A long while back it didn't
seem to be very important. It was shoved off to
the hands of four official bureaus. A huge num
ber of unofficial offices grew through con
venience and necessity. And then the tail be
gan to wag the dog.
It grew too cumbersome. It wouldn't work.
Last year it went to Excom for a shot in the
arm, but Excom was forced 1 to send it away for
lack of any available space.
This year it's coming up for another shot in
the arm. And this year it seems as though the
problem is about to be solved.
Last year's ailing problem child was turned
away because Excom had no place to put it.
This year the Board of Directors of the Co-op
Bookstore has assured The Daily that they will
take over if asked.
It would furnish the ideal centralized office.
Space, convenient office hours, and interested
student help add to the desirability of this lo
cation.
And, in addition, the Co-op Bookstore will
keep a file system of aticles turned in, furnish
collectors to pick up lost articles at the various
offices about campus, and administer the sys
tem in general.
Articles will be left at the nearest sub-unit for
at least one day to facilitate quick turnovers,
then will be picked up and brought to the
central office at the Co-op Bookstore.
With only one centralized lost-and-found of
fice to work from, reclamation of lost articles
will become relatively simple. Considering the
four official and countless nonofficial agencies
now in operation on campus it can't help but be.
Yes, it looks as though the ailing problem
child has finally found a home.

central office at the Co-op Bookstore.
With only one centralized lost-and-found of
fice to work from, reclamation of lost articles
will become relatively simple. Considering the
four official and countless nonofficial agencies
now in operation on campus it can't help but be.

IT'S rather odd the way that things that seem
insignificant are allowed to slide and to slide
until suddenly they're so infernally complicated
that something big has got to be done to make
them work again.
That's the way it's been with the lost and
found question. A long while back it didn't
seem to be very important. It was shoved off to
the hands of four official bureaus. A huge num
ber of unofficial offices grew through con
venience and necessity. And then the tail be
gan to wag the dog.
It grew too cumbersome. It wouldn't work.
Last year it went to Excom for a shot in the
arm, but Excom was forced 1 to send it away for
lack of any available space.
This year it's coming up for another shot in
the arm. And this year it seems as though the
problem is about to be solved.
Last year's ailing problem child was turned
away because Excom had no place to put it.
This year the Board of Directors of the Co-op
Bookstore has assured The Daily that they will
take over if asked.
It would furnish the ideal centralized office.
Space, convenient office hours, and interested
student help add to the desirability of this lo
cation.
And, in addition, the Co-op Bookstore will
keep a file system of aticles turned in, furnish
collectors to pick up lost articles at the various
offices about campus, and administer the sys
tem in general.
Articles will be left at the nearest sub-unit for
at least one day to facilitate quick turnovers,
then will be picked up and brought to the
central office at the Co-op Bookstore.
With only one centralized lost-and-found of
fice to work from, reclamation of lost articles
will become relatively simple. Considering the
