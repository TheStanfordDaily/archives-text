# Con-Home Inventory
## 
### 
NOW THAT (in the manner of Chappie edits)
Con Home Week is a thing of the past,
Farmerettes and Roughs alike in taking final
inventory unanimously agree that a good time
was had by all.
Back to the Farm Day was fun. The Gay
Nineties Dance was swell. Labor Day, the bar
becue, and the entire week of the drive turned
out to be a good old time.
That sort of thing, unlike Topsy, doesn't "just
happen." There was an entire winter quarter's
worth of planning and detail and work behind
it all.
Congratulations, Graham Barbey and staff.
Good job.
