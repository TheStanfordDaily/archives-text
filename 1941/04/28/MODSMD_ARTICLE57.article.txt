# Rock-a-Bye Baby
## 
### 
THE Farm's new baby seems to be growing a
great deal faster than anyone had thought
it would.

Thirty-one entrants met last Friday's deadline
for the Rally Committee - sponsored campus
singfest. Thirty-one groups will take their turn
on the stage of the Frost Memorial Amphithea
ter one week from this Wednesday in the first
All-University sing that Stanford has ever had.
Thirty-one entrants isn't bad picking for the
first attempt of its kind. Still, one wonders what
happened to the remainder of the 24 fraternities,
nine sororities, seven eating clubs and the nu
merous casas and corridors at Union, Lagunita,
Encina et al.
But still, 31 entrants isn't bad. And these
groups, plus their non-singing campus brothers
and sisters, will hold forth on May 7 on an
evening especially hand-picked by Rally Com
mittee for its full moon and balmy breezes.
We've been needing a group festivity of this
sort fo some time. We've been envying the
Eastern schools and the other Coast universities
for song traditions that seemed like fun.
We've finally got one. And on May 7 the
campus will see and hear the birth of what can't
help but become a swell new tradition.

The amphitheater holds 8,000 spectators
Let's see what we can do toward filling it up.
