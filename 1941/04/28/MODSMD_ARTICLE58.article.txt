# Mush On, MacDuff

NOT quite inured against the blessings of
spring quarter, and hoping in their heart-of
hearts that another staff picnic will be in the
offing, the Daily stafflets will head through the
desert of mud, dust and torn-up roads for the
oasis that is the Shack this afternoon at 1:15.
Using their secret route through the Corp
Yard, edit staff plus safari will make camp at
the Shack at 1 o'clock. The whole kit and
kaboodle will later trek for afternoon club with
"certain Stanford students" footing the bill.
