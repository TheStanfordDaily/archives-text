### JERRY MAYER 
THE BLIND MEN
BLIND MAN mingled with Palo Alto's University
Avenue pedestrian traffic last Friday afternoon.
Playing his hurdy-gurdy, he looked like an integral
part of any busy city scene. But incongruous was his.
high tenor voice and the carefree Irish songs he was
singing. It seemed as though, bearing such an afflic
tion, he should have a low, unhappy voice and that he
should be singing a sad melody.
But perhaps he was merely an unconscious ata
vistic symbol of an era that is barely passed. Or per
haps the era never really passed, but merely was over
shadowed temporarily by other events. We are speak
ing of that "lost generation ' period of the 'twenties,
when young men and women, foeti of World War I's
womb, wandered aimlessly with no direction or ideal
or hope for the future. This was a period in which
brilliant young men and women incongruously wasted
their talents because they did not know where to
direct them. It is a period whose psychology is re
flected in the writings of Ernest Hemingway, Aldous
Huxley, and the late F. Scott Fitzgerald, Percy Marks,
James T. Farrell and others of the disillusionist school.

rpHERE was talent in that period, just as much bril
liance and affluence among that younger genera
tion as there has ever been in any generation. But it
did not know how to harness its talent. It could not
discover the star it should hitch its wagon to.

The World War has been blamed for this lack of
faith in the generation of the 'twenties. The young
men who came through the war were disillusioned.
The young people who were born during the war in
herited their disillusion. "We are 'war babies'," they
said. "We are 'war babies' and disillusion is our lot
because the generation ahead of us says so." So
blindly my generation followed suit. And the whole
group was misdirected genius, like the blind man sing
ing happy songs.

In the early 'thirties, the same disappearance, or at
least the submergence, of this trend. America seemed
to be emerging from the depression. A president, the
first of his kind, attempted to rearrange the status quo
to an extent that would allow youth a greater chance
to succeed.

B ut the transition into war-time psychology fol
lowed so quickly that the "war generation" was
left breathless. All their dreams of homes and fu
tures found an inevitable stymie in the draft and a
nebulous future behind the draft. Students once again
turned away from their studies to pleasures because
they didn't know what good education would do them
in the army, and they didn't know whether there were
such things as pleasures in the khaki world. They
once again presented a ludicrous figure, like a blind
man singing a happy song.

A blind man singing a happy song is as incon
gruous as life in general today where men with prom
ising aptitudes are called to submerge their talents
under the commands of the army manual and unem
ployed men are not called and continue unemployed.
There are many ramifiactions to the whole business
that, while understandable in a democracy, seem anom
alies.
But as long as a blind man can sing at all, there
is still the promise of a future that is nearer Utopian
dreams than the universe that we live in today, or
that any generation has ever lived in.
