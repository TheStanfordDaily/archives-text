# CAMPUS OPINION
## ESCAPE INTO YESTERDAY 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
It has been called to my attention that lots of
people are harking back in your paper. You know
what I mean. That editorial about everybody being
in their second childhood because they like serials
about clutching hands. And then Mr. Jerry Mayer
is always talking about when he was in grammar
school and had trouble with little girls ,and when
he was in grade school and had trouble with little
girls, and when he was in high school and had trouble
with little girls.
These sources who called my attention to this odd
fact attributed it to Spring, and everybody getting the
old urge to gambol, like lambs and Legs Diamond, but
I think that probably the whole thing has a deeper
and far more significant basis.
After pondering on this moot and rather strange
question for some time I have concluded that the
whole thing is due to the European Situation.
Look at the papers. Even this paper. And you'll
see that what with Hitler and all, the future doesn't
look so good, and by that I mean it looks really bad.
And therein lies this deep-rooted urge to crawl back
into the carefree past. We all want to forget that we're
near the draft age. Even the women who are the hypo
thetical wives of the draftees. Being a "lost generation"
like they were in 1920 looks like fun in restrospect, but
you have to live through something pretty unpleasant
to get to it.
There's darn little we can do to straighten out the
present mess. And so I think that C.8., who writes
editorials, and Mr. Jerry Mayer who writes Bull Ses
sion are just expressing the escapist trend of times.
Nobody can do anything about things as they are; but
we can hark back to the times when they weren't that
way.
Love and Stuff to you Mr. Editor,
