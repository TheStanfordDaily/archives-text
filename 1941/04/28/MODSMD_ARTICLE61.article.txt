r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
I have been interested in your coverage of the
Fifty Years of Stanford Progress as well as the regu
lar features of your paper because I have been un
able to return to school this year. About eight months
ago I contracted rheumatic fever; at present I am just
beginning to recuperate from the illness. I have en
joyed every issue of The Daily; but I wonder yet why
Stanford students fill Campus Opinion with rot. Thank
God Ames no longer writes Bull Session; I think Mayer
is doing a good job. But somebody ought to fumigate
the movie reviews. They are as bad as ever. Nobody
seems to care about movies this day and age, anyway,
so I suppose that I don't need to say much about that.
My God! Stanford has an A.S.S.U. Proxy from the
Halls!
Regards,
William D. Stephens, '40
