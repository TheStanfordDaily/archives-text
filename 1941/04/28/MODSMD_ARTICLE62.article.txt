# Tracy, Rooney Team Up In Rehash of "Boys' Town"
## 
### 
"MEN OF BOY'S TOWN," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Spencer Tracy dons the black sack, turns bis collar around and takes
up the troubles of Boy's Town again in a follow-up of the highly suc
cessful picture of last year. Mickey Rooney also carries on his role of

Mayor of Boy's Town.
Whereas the original picture had a
pretty good story to tell, this is
nothing more than sentimental guff,
whipped up to catch the public on
the rebound. At the I'ate this one
goes, there is every indication that
Boy's Town will be as much an in
stitution as the Hardy family.
All the previous setbacks which
occurred in the other picture crop
up again in this one. There is the
cripple from the reform school who
hates everyone and everything but
who finally comes over through
Father Flanagan's care and devotion.
FINANCIAL TROUBLE

Mickey Rooney gets mixed up in
some outside trouble and is sent to
the reformatory, from which Father
Flanagan has to rescue him. Father
Flanagan builds several new build
ings and can't pay for them and so
Mickey Rooney heroically tries to
sell himself to a rich family who
wants to adopt him. But everything
works out and in the end Boy's
Town is really booming.

Spencer Tracy, as Father Flana
gan, is really beginning to get the
feel of this role. As the sympa
thetic priest and the father of the
boys of Boy's Town, he gives a very
sincere and moving portrayal. A
newcomer, by the name of Lee Cobb,
who plays Father Flanagan's friend
and financial advisor, gives an ex
cellent performance.
ROONEY DOESN'T MUG

Mickey Rooney manages to keep
his mugging down pretty well. How
ever, he does get an opportunity to
lead his orchestra in the infirmary,
fantastic as it may seem. There is a
ghastly moment when Rooney has to
say farewell to his sidekick and
stooge, little Bobs Watson. To see
both of them burst into tears is a
little too much.

Real honors go to a youngster
named Daryll Hickman. Barely
eight years old, he has a line of
slang and tough talk with which he
will go far. Here again the story
goes weak: this little kid steals a
gun, holds up a gas station, at
tempts another stick-up before he is
caught.

It takes a while to get all the finan
cial troubles, operations, paroles and
reform school troubles straightened
out, so there is no other feature on
with it. An excellent March of
Time is also on the program. â€”
