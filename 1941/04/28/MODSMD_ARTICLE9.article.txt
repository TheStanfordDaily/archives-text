# Harpsichord Causes Trouble During Alice Ehlers' Travels
## 
### 
Alice Ehlers, internationally known harpsichordist, will give a concert
for the Tuesday Evening Series tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock in the
Auditorium of the Memorial Hall.
Madame Ehlers visited this country for the first time in I!KJ7 when she
was invited to play at the Coolidge Festival in Washington. Swamped

with concert offers, she had to re-,
turn to Eui'ope to fulfill her en
gagements. In 1938 she x*eturned to
New York to appear with the Phila
delphia Orchestra as the soloist in
three concerts. She had just finished
a tour through Egypt and Palestine
after playing in London fifty Scar
latti sonatas for the British Broad
casting Corporation.
"It isn't easy to travel with a
harpsichord," she said in speaking
of her many concert tours through
out Europe and the United States.
"The instrument weighs more than
a grand piano, and I have had many
adventures while en route."
AMBULANCE SENT
In a small town in Germany, Alice
Ehlers was met at the station with
an ambulance for the harpsichord
instead of the truck which she ex
pected. When she asked why they
sent an ambulance, the answer was:
"We looked it up in the dictionary
to sec what kind of an instrument a
harpsichord is, and there we found,
'the harpsichord is a very delicate
instrument.' So we thought it best
to send an ambulance."
En route in Italy on another occa
sion, Madame Ehlers had to change
trains in Rome, where to her dis
tress the instrument was nowhere to
be found. With the help of an offi
cial she finally located it on a lonely
freight car at the other end of the
city, where it was surrounded by
hundreds of little pigs. Due to the
warm-blooded companions, the in
strument was in fine shape.
TROUBLE IN PALERMO
On her arrival in Palermo, there
were further complications. It was a
holiday, and nobody wanted to un
load the instrument. Finally a
peasant condescended to take it
through the city with his mule and
cart. Madame Ehlers walked at the
rear of the cart holding the harpsi
chord in place. When she tried to
pay the man for his services, he
declined and said that he wanted a
ticket for the concert.
Just how the harpsichord prob
lem will be handled when it arrives
for tomorrow night's concert has not
been decided.

after playing in London fifty Scar
latti sonatas for the British Broad
casting Corporation.
"It isn't easy to travel with a
harpsichord," she said in speaking
of her many concert tours through
out Europe and the United States.
"The instrument weighs more than
a grand piano, and I have had many
adventures while en route."
AMBULANCE SENT
In a small town in Germany, Alice
Ehlers was met at the station with
an ambulance for the harpsichord
instead of the truck which she ex
pected. When she asked why they
sent an ambulance, the answer was:
"We looked it up in the dictionary
to sec what kind of an instrument a
harpsichord is, and there we found,
'the harpsichord is a very delicate
instrument.' So we thought it best
to send an ambulance."
En route in Italy on another occa
sion, Madame Ehlers had to change
trains in Rome, where to her dis
tress the instrument was nowhere to
be found. With the help of an offi
cial she finally located it on a lonely
freight car at the other end of the
city, where it was surrounded by
hundreds of little pigs. Due to the
warm-blooded companions, the in
strument was in fine shape.
TROUBLE IN PALERMO
On her arrival in Palermo, there
were further complications. It was a
holiday, and nobody wanted to un
load the instrument. Finally a
peasant condescended to take it
through the city with his mule and
cart. Madame Ehlers walked at the
rear of the cart holding the harpsi
chord in place. When she tried to
pay the man for his services, he
declined and said that he wanted a
ticket for the concert.
Just how the harpsichord prob
lem will be handled when it arrives
for tomorrow night's concert has not
been decided.
Alice Ehlers, internationally known harpsichordist, will give a concert
for the Tuesday Evening Series tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock in the
Auditorium of the Memorial Hall.
Madame Ehlers visited this country for the first time in I!KJ7 when she
was invited to play at the Coolidge Festival in Washington. Swamped

with concert offers, she had to re-,
turn to Eui'ope to fulfill her en
gagements. In 1938 she x*eturned to
New York to appear with the Phila
delphia Orchestra as the soloist in
three concerts. She had just finished
a tour through Egypt and Palestine
after playing in London fifty Scar
latti sonatas for the British Broad
casting Corporation.
