'JMCK off the next few days on the
calendar and relax a little. The
housewifely touehes Hitler needs in
his Balkan spring cleaning should
take a little while, and he might
even consider giving the boys a
brief breathing spell.

But not for long. The Fuehrer
has a great many things to do yet.
It's really just a question as to
which he's going to do first, or
maybe how many things he thinks
he can tackle at once. At present,
it looks as though his next move
could go any or all of five different
ways:

He could take the million men of
his Army of the Balkans up north
to attempt the long-awaited inva
sion of the British Isles. This might
not be too bad an idea, since Amer
ican aid to England and the new
Atlantic patrol has not yet had time
to make its weight felt. This, how
ever, looks to be the least likely of
his five possible moves.

yY DRIVE toward Suez through
Libya, which would entail
strengthening his North African
army and fighting the largest Brit
ish, force he has yet encountered,
seems the most logical step because
it is already clearly indicated. At
present his men are bogged down
about five miles inside of the Egyp
tian border, and they have not yet
reached Sidi Barrani — the farthest
point taken by the Italians. With
the fall of Dessie, the last major
center of Italian resistance in
Ethiopia, many more troops will be
released to strengthen the British
forces in Egypt.

Co-existent with an all-out at
tempt at Suez should come the at
tack on Gibraltar. Since bottling
up the Mediterranean fleet is an
achievement devoutly to be de
sired by the Axis forces, this at
tack comes even more strongly
into the realm of possibility. The
British think so since they just
placed Lord Gort in command of
the huge rock's forces.

It's going to bo tough defending
the west Mediterranean stronghold.
Not because they can't hold it.
After all, Gibraltar has withstood 15
sieges, and is the best defended
fortress in the world. However, if
Spain enters the war and gives Ger
many the use of Spanish Morocco
and the tip of the Iberian Penin
sula, Gibraltar harbor could be made
useless as a naval base. British
strategists have contended for years
that the harbor and town cannot be
defended from hostile artillery based
in the hills of southern Spanish An
dalusia.

But Gibraltar would still be use
ful as a submarine base, and might
take on somewhat the same position
Tobruk is occupying now, that is, a
key point for harrying enemy com
munication lines.

last two possibilities are also
closely linked. The presaged
attack on Turkey carries with it
the threat of a parachute attack on
Syria. This country is ripe for that
sort of thing since the German
"tourist" trade has increased tre
mendously in the last few months.
The reason for such a drive would
be the Mosul oil fields and an attack
on Suez from the north.

The possibility of a war with
Turkey depends almost entirely on
the Knigma with the mustaches in
the Kremlin. If he says lie won't
support the Turks, then the Nazis
won't have to fight there. They'll
just move in. However, there are
rather a lot of British troops in
Turkey right at present, and the
Turks arc giving all indications of
being ready for the worst.

Most immediate storm center is
of course the island of Crete at the
tip of the Hellenic peninsula. Here
the British have been entrenched
since the first of the Italo-Greek
war. In Berlin the spokesmen were
saying that Germany was deter
mined to "completely destroy Brit
ish power in the Mediterranean."

Already the Nazi bombers are re
ported hammering at the big island
where the Greek government is now
situated. It's really sort of a minia
-1 ure invasion set-up. To take it, the
Nazis will have to land a force, and
the British navy will be in a posi
tion to help the defenders.

housewifely touehes Hitler needs in
his Balkan spring cleaning should
take a little while, and he might
even consider giving the boys a
brief breathing spell.

But not for long. The Fuehrer
has a great many things to do yet.
It's really just a question as to
which he's going to do first, or
maybe how many things he thinks
he can tackle at once. At present,
it looks as though his next move
could go any or all of five different
ways:

He could take the million men of
his Army of the Balkans up north
to attempt the long-awaited inva
sion of the British Isles. This might
not be too bad an idea, since Amer
ican aid to England and the new
Atlantic patrol has not yet had time
to make its weight felt. This, how
ever, looks to be the least likely of
his five possible moves.

yY DRIVE toward Suez through
Libya, which would entail
strengthening his North African
army and fighting the largest Brit
ish, force he has yet encountered,
seems the most logical step because
it is already clearly indicated. At
present his men are bogged down
about five miles inside of the Egyp
tian border, and they have not yet
reached Sidi Barrani — the farthest
point taken by the Italians. With
the fall of Dessie, the last major
center of Italian resistance in
Ethiopia, many more troops will be
released to strengthen the British
forces in Egypt.

Co-existent with an all-out at
tempt at Suez should come the at
tack on Gibraltar. Since bottling
up the Mediterranean fleet is an
achievement devoutly to be de
sired by the Axis forces, this at
tack comes even more strongly
into the realm of possibility. The
British think so since they just
placed Lord Gort in command of
the huge rock's forces.

It's going to bo tough defending
the west Mediterranean stronghold.
Not because they can't hold it.
After all, Gibraltar has withstood 15
sieges, and is the best defended
fortress in the world. However, if
Spain enters the war and gives Ger
many the use of Spanish Morocco
and the tip of the Iberian Penin
sula, Gibraltar harbor could be made
useless as a naval base. British
strategists have contended for years
that the harbor and town cannot be
defended from hostile artillery based
in the hills of southern Spanish An
dalusia.

But Gibraltar would still be use
ful as a submarine base, and might
take on somewhat the same position
Tobruk is occupying now, that is, a
key point for harrying enemy com
munication lines.

attack on Turkey carries with it
the threat of a parachute attack on
Syria. This country is ripe for that
sort of thing since the German
"tourist" trade has increased tre

The reason for such a drive would
be the Mosul oil fields and an attack

The possibility of a war with
Turkey depends almost entirely on
the Knigma with the mustaches in

The possibility of a war with
Turkey depends almost entirely on
the Knigma with the mustaches in
the Kremlin. If he says lie won't
support the Turks, then the Nazis
won't have to fight there. They'll
just move in. However, there are
rather a lot of British troops in
Turkey right at present, and the
Turks arc giving all indications of
being ready for the worst.

Most immediate storm center is
of course the island of Crete at the
tip of the Hellenic peninsula. Here
the British have been entrenched
since the first of the Italo-Greek
war. In Berlin the spokesmen were
saying that Germany was deter
mined to "completely destroy Brit
ish power in the Mediterranean."

Already the Nazi bombers are re
ported hammering at the big island
where the Greek government is now
situated. It's really sort of a minia

Nazis will have to land a force, and
the British navy will be in a posi

'JMCK off the next few days on the
calendar and relax a little. The
housewifely touehes Hitler needs in
his Balkan spring cleaning should
take a little while, and he might
even consider giving the boys a
brief breathing spell.

But not for long. The Fuehrer
has a great many things to do yet.
It's really just a question as to
which he's going to do first, or
maybe how many things he thinks
he can tackle at once. At present,
it looks as though his next move
could go any or all of five different
ways:

He could take the million men of
his Army of the Balkans up north
to attempt the long-awaited inva
sion of the British Isles. This might
not be too bad an idea, since Amer
ican aid to England and the new
Atlantic patrol has not yet had time
to make its weight felt. This, how
ever, looks to be the least likely of
his five possible moves.

yY DRIVE toward Suez through
Libya, which would entail
strengthening his North African
army and fighting the largest Brit
ish, force he has yet encountered,
seems the most logical step because
it is already clearly indicated. At
present his men are bogged down
about five miles inside of the Egyp
tian border, and they have not yet
reached Sidi Barrani — the farthest
point taken by the Italians. With
the fall of Dessie, the last major
center of Italian resistance in
Ethiopia, many more troops will be
released to strengthen the British
forces in Egypt.

Co-existent with an all-out at
tempt at Suez should come the at
tack on Gibraltar. Since bottling
up the Mediterranean fleet is an
achievement devoutly to be de
sired by the Axis forces, this at
tack comes even more strongly
into the realm of possibility. The
British think so since they just
placed Lord Gort in command of
the huge rock's forces.

It's going to bo tough defending
the west Mediterranean stronghold.
Not because they can't hold it.
After all, Gibraltar has withstood 15
sieges, and is the best defended
fortress in the world. However, if
Spain enters the war and gives Ger
many the use of Spanish Morocco
and the tip of the Iberian Penin
sula, Gibraltar harbor could be made
useless as a naval base. British
strategists have contended for years
that the harbor and town cannot be
defended from hostile artillery based
in the hills of southern Spanish An
dalusia.

But Gibraltar would still be use
ful as a submarine base, and might
take on somewhat the same position
Tobruk is occupying now, that is, a
key point for harrying enemy com
munication lines.

last two possibilities are also
closely linked. The presaged
attack on Turkey carries with it
the threat of a parachute attack on
Syria. This country is ripe for that
sort of thing since the German
"tourist" trade has increased tre
mendously in the last few months.
