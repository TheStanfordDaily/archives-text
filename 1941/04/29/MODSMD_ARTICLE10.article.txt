# Machine Plays War Libe Bells
## Allen Demonstrates Keyboard of Carillon 
### VICTOR MINAHAN 
The machine age has caught up
y>ith Quasimodo.
Yes, the fascinating hunchback
vyho rang bells by the simple expe
dient of swinging on them is gone.
But the modern counterpart of dear
old Quasi sits today in the tower of
the Hoover Libe, after a long trip
here from Belgium via the New
York World's Fair.

We went up to see Quasimodo
about a week ago. Professor War
ren D. Allen had consented to
demonstrate how the eonsarned thing
worked.

The machinery is on the 13th floor
of the Libe and, at present anyway,
it's the only thing on that floor.

Professor Allen walked up to
Quasi, touched one of the handles,
andâ€”"Bong," one of the great Mis
sounded on the floor above.

The 13th floor is no place to listen
to a carillon concert, however. First
of all, Quasi is a noisy fellow. He
grunts and squeaks so that you can
hardly hear the bells.

Another bothersome thing is that
it takes a while for pressure on one
of the handles to make a bell ring.
By the time the bells get out "All,"
Professor. Allen was pushing down
on "Hail." If you're watching the
player, it's pretty confusing.
The mechanism, in short, works
like this: the player pushes on one
of the handles, which in turn pulls
a wire, which is connected to the
clapper of one of the bells on the
floor above.
Dr. Allen explained that he plan
ned no more formal concerts on the
bells this spring.
"Whenever we get inspired, we'll
just go up and play," he remarked.
