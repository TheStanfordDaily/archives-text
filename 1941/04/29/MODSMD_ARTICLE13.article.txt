# Deferees to Be Reclassified Before July 1, Board States
## 
### 
All men classified under the Selective Service Act heading J-D or 1-E—
that is, induction deferred until the close of the school year but not be
yond July 1, 1041—"will of necessity be reclassified by their local draft
boards before this latter date," it is announced by the Committee on
Education and National Defense. *

The announcement states as fol
lows:
"Any student who finds that he
is classified in this group and who
has or has had personal plans for
continuing study beyond this year
should, at once, prepare in duplicate
a 'Student Statement of Informa
tion,' giving complete information as
to his status and plans together with
any contracts or other assurances
with respect to engaging in neces
sary employment or further training
toward a professional goal beyond
this px-esent school year.
COPY TO BOARD
"One copy of this Student State
ment of Information should be de
livered to his local board without
delay. The duplicate copy should
be delivered to the official oi the
university or college designated for
this purpose." Here at Stanford this
person is the associate registrar, Dr.
Karl M. Cowdcry.
"This Student Statement of In
formation should state clearly and
fully the name and address of the
student, the number and address of
the local board and the order num
ber which the student holds under
the local draft board listing.
NAME, NUMBER
"Any pertinent information about
the student should be given on this
form including complete information
as to probable date of graduation,
plans for further preparation, the
occupation which the student plans
to enter and any other details of
significance that would indicate that
the student is preparing for a neces
sary place in an essential occupa
tion."
The suggested instructions also
state that any student who has not
yet received a Selective Service
questionnaire needs to do nothing
yet, but upon receiving the question
naire should prepare a Student
Statement of Information as de
scribed above, one copy to be at
tached to the questionnaire.
The copy of this statement should
be provided to Mr. Cowdery with a
statement of any other details which
the University might use in pre
senting his case to best advantage
to the local draft board. For all
cases being classified from this time
on it is important that this State
l ment of Information and the ques
| tionnaire together reach the draft
board within five days of receipt of
| the questionnaire.
