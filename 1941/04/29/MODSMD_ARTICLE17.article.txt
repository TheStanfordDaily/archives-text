# British Guard Gibraltar Against German Attack; Drive on Suez Continues
## Petain Ponders Sending Troops Back to Africa 
### 
LONDON, April 28 (UP). â€”The
British Navy tonight faced the grim
threat of being driven from the
western Mediterranean, for the first
time in 150 years, as signs multi
plied Germany is preparing to strike
through Spain to attack Gibraltar.
Although defenses of "The Rock"
remain virtually impregnable, in
formed military quarters admitted it
could not be held as a naval base
against any strong German attack
by land unless the British could
seize and hold the Spanish mainland
surrounding it on three sides.
FEAII SUEZ DRIVE
A strong German drive for the
Suez Canal coupled with a thrust
upon Gibraltar was anticipated in
many high quarters in London to
day. Prime Minister Winston
Churchill predicted Sunday that the

war in the Mediterranean from
Gibraltar to the Dardanelles is
about to "become very fierce."
The intensified Italo-Cerman des
ert drive toward the Suez may de
velop into a powerful assault co
ordinated with the attack on Gib
raltar, these quarters said.
