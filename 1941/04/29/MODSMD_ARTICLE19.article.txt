# PETAIN CONSIDERS FIGHTING BRITISH
## 
### 
VICHY, April 28 (UP).â€”The Pe
tain government tonight considered
throwing France's overseas army
back into the war in Africa, against
British and "Free French" forces
attacking French Somaliland in a
drive against the important port and
railroad terminus of Djibouti.
French defense forces, ordered to
resist the Somaliland attack, were
said in an official announcement to
be remaining "loyally" at their posts
and to be refusing to enter into any
agreement with the attacking "Free
French" dissidents of Gen. Charles
De Gaule.
AXIS URGES DRIVE
Germany and Italy, it was re
vealed, are urging France to drive
the British and "Free French" from
the French African possessions
which are now used as communica
tions routes or as bases for British
military operations.
At least five French army divi
sions, from Gen. Maxime Weygand's
forces in North Africa, would be
required to recapture the lost colo
nics and regions.
