# Farm Okays Lost, Found Bureau Plan
## Approval of Chiefs, Students Backs Up Proposal by Daily 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Administration support and stu
dent opinion are crystallizing behind
The Daily's proposal for a central
ized lost and found bureau on cam
pus.
Dr. Wilbur expressed his approval
of a centralized lost and found bu
reau and recognizes the need for
one on campus.
"I am in favor of a centralized
department with proper methods of
identification and protection for lost
and found articles. If The Daily's
proposal is the best way to handle it,
I do approve," Dr. Wilbur said.
HEARTILY IN FAVOR . . .
Ernest S. Erwin, assistant busi
ness manager, said:
"We are heartily in favor of the
suggested plan. Lost and found
business has been a Stanford step
child for a long time. We're con
vinced that it hasn't received the
attention it is entitled to.
"The administration has assumed
responsibility for care of lost ar
ticles," Mr. Erwin explained. "But
the fact remains the interest in
taking care of lost articles has been
divided and, thus, the need for one
main agency."
A PUBLIC SERVICE
"The Board of Directors of the
Co-operative Book Exchange So
ciety has, with considerable enthus
iasm, expressed its desire to per
form a worth while public service
by handling a centralized lost and
found department," Fred Turner,
Co-op president, stated.
"The Co-op Bookstore has the fa
cilities, and the Co-op members have
the will and interest, as well as the
ability, to make this venture suc
ceed," Turner said.
DAILY'S SOLUTION
The Daily's solution to the current
lost and found dilemma is to merge
the four main lost and found agen
cies into one. It is to be under
A.S.S.U. supervision, administered
by the Co-op Book Exchange, and
located in Room 15 of the Old Union,
the Co-op store.

Students will deliver articles they
find and call for lost ones at this
one agency, rather than the many
currently operating. However, ar
ticles.found in the Libe, Ad Build
ing, 8.A.C., Cellar, or at the various
departments will be left there dur
ing the day they are found.

As often as necessary articles will
be collected and brought to the main
office, where they will be filed and
stored until claimed. The Daily will
publish a list of articles turned in
once a week.

As is done now, unclaimed articles
will be sold or auctioned at the end
of the year, proceeds going to the
Convalescent Home.
