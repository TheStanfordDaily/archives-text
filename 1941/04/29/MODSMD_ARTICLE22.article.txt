# Alumni Banquet Honors Wilburs
## 
### 
Oversold to a capacity of 2715 res
ervations, the banquet given last
night in the Union dining room by
the Palo Alto Stanford Club, hon
oring President and Mrs. Ray Ly
man Wilbur has been counted a
tremendous success.
A versatile program of dances, or
chestral numbers, and songs popular
with Stanford students through the
years featured everything from the
polka of 1891 to the rhythmic conga
ol 1941. Graduates from every class
of Stanford's fifty had a chance to
outdo each other in displaying a
knowledge of the activities, of their
alma mater in a mock quiz pro
gram.
The guests, who were seated ac
cording to the decade in which they
were Stanford students, had a chance
to "recall the time whenâ€”" and ob
serve the present generation con
ducting student affairs in the Uni
versity.
