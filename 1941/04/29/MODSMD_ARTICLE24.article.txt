# County Fair Set for May 21 As Models Prepare for Show
## 
### 
Now that the sun is out and promises to stay out for a while, plans are
being formulated for the County Fair, scheduled for May 21. Women's
Conference sponsors the Fair to raise money for scholarships and Union
Court is turned over to all campus women that day.
Highlight of the Fair this year will be the fashion show under the

chairmanship of Peggy Jadden.
Alto stores contribute clothes which
are modeled by Farm women. The
committee is hard at work already
and at this date, all reports are
favorable.
IN SKIT FORM
"We hope the men as well as the
women will be interested in this
year's show. It will be in the form
of a skit and we guarantee an hour
of fun for all," said Peggy Jadden.
The show will feature the high
spots in a typical freshman co-ed's
life and what she will wear to
various functions.
The committee announces that the
following girls will model: Dorothy
s Dodge, Trudy Brawner, Nedra
i Bordwell, Janice Himmelwright,
