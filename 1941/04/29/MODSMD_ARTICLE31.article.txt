# Indian Baseballers Battle Bears Today in Last Tilt Of 1941 Diamond Season
## 
### 
Third time's the charm for the Indians—maybe—as Stanford and Cali
fornia square off today in the last encounter of the Big Game series and
final intercollegiate hall game of the season. Game time is 3:15 on Sunken
Diamond.
The Cards' nitcliine assignment will go to either Cootie Thompson

or Claude Purkitt, both hurlers hav
ing seen duty at Berkeley Saturday.
In any event, Jack Randall will com
plete the battery, and California
will probably start Mike Koll, who
has already measured the Redskins
twice in two tries.
KOLL EFFECTIVE
Koll took over Saturday in the
last half of the eighth after Fred
Kirtlan had weakened and given up
a homer to Flton Boone. The In
dians executed a neat double steal
off Koll when he went to the mound
with two out, but he set the Cards
down one-two-three in the tenth.
It was another heartbreaker for
Thompson, who retired the Bears
with a masterful pitching job in
the ninth after two walks and an
error had filled the bases. The bay
rooters were getting ready to leave
when there were none out and the
bags loaded.
COOTIE STEADY
But Cootie whiffed Dick David for
the first out, foxed Stan Griffith,
who tried to bunt twice and finally
popped up, and finished by forcing
Jack Albright to send up a long fly
to Jack Parsons in right field.
Thompson has come so close so
many times in three years that the
law of averages seems to have
ceased working. Again it was a
miscue that finally put the winning
run on base, this time in the out
field.
LAST CHANCE
Today will be Thompson's final
chance against the Indians' arch
rivals from Berkeley. Twice now
Koll has bested the Card right
hander in extra-inning games, and
if he starts the resulting mound
match should produce the best ball
game of the year.

California Stanford
Hoberg c Randall
p Thompson,
Koll Purkitt
