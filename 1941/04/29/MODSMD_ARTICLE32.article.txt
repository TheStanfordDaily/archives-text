# Fiji Nine Beats Sigma Chis, 28-9
## 
### 
In a wild slugging contest the
Fijis overwhelmed Sigma Chi 28-9 in
one of the feature games of intra
mural softball yesterday afternoon.
Both teams were noticeably off
form and a large number of errors
were committed by both sides
throughout the contest, but the su
periority of the Fijis in extra base
hits bunched with walks gave the
Phi Gams their margin.
In a beautifully pitched game the
Phi Kaps annihilated Encina IE by
a 17-0 score. It was Harry Dyck's
masterful arm which silenced the
frosh bats and this hurling per
formance, combined with a five-run
first inning and a six-run second
frame allowed the Phi Kaps to glide
the rest of the way.
The third game of the afternoon
saw the Phi Delts absorbing a 19-G
licking from the A.T.O.'s. Nine runs
in the second inning put the game
on ice for the A.T.O.'s.
This afternoon's schedule:
D.U. vs. Dckes.
Alpha Sigma Phi vs. El Cuadro
Kappa Alpha vs. Chi Psi
Phi Kaps vs. Phi Delta Phi (hard
ball)
