# Frosh Trackmen Enter P.A.A. Meet
## 
### 
Although the season officially ends
with the California meet, Bob Wa
ters, Don Reiss, Joe Mardesich, and
possibly Bill Joslyn of the fresh
man track squad will enter the an
nual Pacific Athletic Association
track meet Saturday at Berkeley.

Waters and Reiss appear to have
(he best chance of placing, although
they will be running against some
of the topflight competitors on the
Coast. Only Harold Davis of Salinas
J. C. and Barney Willis of U.S.C.
have bettered Waters' times in the
sprints.
