# Farm Golfers Win Coast Title
## 
### SIDNEY HAYES 
Last week-end, Stanford's golf
team marched casually through its
last opposition on the Pacific Coast.
This competition, as during all the
rest of this year, wasn't even a
struggle.
First, the sweet-swinging Redskin
team of Brownell, Berl, Finger, Ta
tum, Hough, and Replogle won the
Pacific Coast team championship by
a margin of about 40 or 50 strokes.
Every member on the team quali
fied for the individual match play
competition.
Second, the garrulous golfer,
swift - swinging Dee Replogle
squelched the heaviest foreign threat,
Hal Paddock of S.C., in the morn
ing, and then eked out a victory
over his teammate Warren Berl in
the afternoon.
In the meantime the twisting torso,
Bud Brownell, was cleaning up
teammate Frank Tatum and former
Stanfordite Bob Breyer of U.S.C.
So third, the Pacific Coast cham
pionship became the Stanford
school championship and Bud
Brownell won the title from Dee
Replogle last Saturday. Replogle
was great, but Brownell was mag
nificent, that's the story of that
match.
