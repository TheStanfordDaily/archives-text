# Lindskog Returns to Practice After Two Weeks in Hospital
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity football team returned to full strength yesterday
with the return to spring practice of Vic Lindskog, ace center of the Rose
Bowl squad. Lindskog has been confined to the hospital for two weeks
with a sinus infection.
Frankie Albert returned to the squad again, but refrained from any

blocking or contact work, due to
severe case of poison oak, content- i
ing himself with a lot of passing and |
kicking.
Yesterday's workout consisted
mostly of work on blocking and live
tackling in an effort to get into
shape quickly enough to permit
scrimmage later on in the week. The
date has not yet been set, but the
first contact work will probably
come next Friday afternoon or the
following Monday.
Coach Shaughnessy experimented
with some new plays on his "A"
squad yesterday and seemed to be
pleased with the results. It is ex
pected that he will continue this
throughout the week.
