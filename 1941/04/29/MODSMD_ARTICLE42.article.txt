### CHUCK SMITH 
has always been gentle
men's sport. For the 19 years
Dink Templeton was "head man" at
Stanford, Card trackmen learned to
take beatings and victories in a
gracious rtianner with Dink as their
example.
The example which stands out in
my mind was in 1935 when things
went awry up in Berkeley in some
what the same way they did last
Saturday. In that year, however, the
Indians were favored to win the
meet by as high a margin as 80-51;
in fact, even the pessimistic Tem
pleton predicted a 72-59 win for his
team.
But an unknown Bear half-miler
sneaked in for a second in the 880,
Stanford's high jumper, Humbert
Smith, who had been flirting with
6-8. injured his take-off ankle and
ended up out of the money, and a
couple of California javelin throw
ers went wild to take a first and a
third in front of the Farm's favored
Johnny Mottram and Dud Sales. The
result was a 77-54 win for California.
Dink, who was suffering from an
especially bad attack of arthritis,
had been watching the goings-on
from a wheel chair with strict or
ders to stay off his feet. But when
the Indians collapsed in the final
few events and a California victory
seemed evident, Dink raised himself
out of his chair and labored across
Edwards Field to congratulate his
old friend, Brutirs Hamilton, Cal's
coach.
And last Saturday Hamilton car
ried on the strictly gentlemen's re
lationship which has always existed
between Stanford and California in
track.
For Hamilton sought out Pitch
V-

Johnson in the Card dressing room
and was sincere in his efforts to
t Her the Card coach consolation
over (he results of (lie meet.
He made it clear that it was not !
a sign of Stanford's weakness but I
one of a ''hot" day for the Bears, j
Hamilton said, "I couldn't help it, ;
there just wasn't any stopping those j
boys today. I wish they were that j
hot against U.S.C."

r ouf on the Sunken Dia
mond a guy I know is going to
bow out of athletics at Stanford.
He's a guy who has been tops at
Stanford and on the Coast in his
particular job for the last three
years.
But he has been plagued by a !
jinx whenever he has had to face !
Cal. You know who I mean, Stan
ford's leading pitcher for the last
three seasons, Quentin "Cootie"
Thompson.
In the past three years Cootie has !
pitched against the Bears eight times !
and has failed to win a game even
though he has mowed down the
other teams in the Coast Confer- '
enee.
This year he has lost two real
heartbreakers, two games which Cal
has grabbed by one run in the tenth
inning. And today he goes out there
against Cal for the third time this
year and for the ninth time in his
college career to try and beat Cali
fornia.
Pitching like his should not go j
unnoticed and unappreciated. May
be the whole campus DOES want
"Cootie" to whip Cal in his final
try, in his final college game; but it
can let him know best by showing
up and rooting for him at 3:15 this
1 afternoon.
