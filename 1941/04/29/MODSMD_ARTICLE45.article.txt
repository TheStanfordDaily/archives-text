This editorial is not a defense of the policies
expressed by Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh.
Rather it is an expression of a fervent belief
that the right of free speech and free thought
is an inviolable part of the spirit of America.
Head it, not with the attitude that here is merely
another tangent of the case of Charles Lind
bergh, but rather with the feeling that per
haps, despite the reams of copy and radio
time already dealing with the subject, the
crux of the question has been left untouched.
