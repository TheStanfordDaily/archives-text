# The 						All-Alone Eagle

ONE of the most interesting, yet at the same
time unamusing, aspects of the current
American political scene has been the case
against Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh.
Bombarded and bombasted by Administra
tion leaders and hangers-on, first for his testi
mony on the Lease-Lend witness stand, Lind
bergh met heavy official censure last Friday
when the President termed the Colonel's view
point as being against the best interests of his
country.

Charles Lindbergh has lived an amazing life.
A life that pushed him from comparative ob
scurity to one of the highest hero pedestals that
any American has occupied within the memory
of this generation.

In 1927, as the "Lone Eagle," the smiling
American boy who conguered the Atlantic in
his solo New York to Paris flight, Lindy wrung
heartfelt praise from the people of every nation
in Europe. This country, the land of his birth,
hailed him as the "shining, unguenchable spirit
of America."

Charles Lindbergh won a lasting niche in
the hall of fame for that one deed. But the
"unquenchable spirit" led him on.
Lindy advanced in another field, and together
with Dr. Alexis Carrel heaped more laurel leaves
upon his brow with his work on the "mechani
cal heart" in the field of medical science.

Again, as one of the ranking aeronautical
experts of the world, Charles Lindbergh per
sonally inspected the air fleets of Europe, an
opportunity tendered no other man.

Short years ago the "unquenchable" Lind
bergh and his wife, the former Anne Morrow,
lost their infant son in the famous Hauptmann
case that brought tears to the eyes of millions
of reader-Americans. Lindbergh was again a
national name—this time in a way that made his
fellow men sympathize with and revere him as
only Americans can. *

Yes, Charles A. Lindbergh had carved his
name among the list of immortal Americans
many times over. He could have been a na
tional hero forever.

And yet, because of burning internal convic
tions, Lindy told his country what he believed.
And he said the words he could have kept be
cause he thought them to be truths.

He could not have but known that what he
said could cost him the reverence and love of
his countrymen. But he did not hesitate—be
cause he thought he was right.

Charles Lindbergh's testimony on the stand
in the Lend-Lease hearing brought shame upon
the Lone Eagle'' who had carried his country's
name to the far corners of the world. The "shin
ing, unquenchable spirit of America" was smoth
ered beneath the cry of "un-Americanism."

And now, because again he chose to express
a firm conviction that he knew was contrary to
official thought and publication, Charles Lind
bergh has been derogated as an "appeaser" of
the most dangerous sort.

I have read the word-by-word testimony which
Lindbergh gave during the Lend-Lease hearing.
And I have with considerable curiosity watched
his recent statements and opinions.
Nowhere, in either instance, has Colonel Lind
bergh expressed, or professed to express, any
other opinion than that of an average American
citizen.
And for this, for testimony which he was
urged to give on the witness stand and for the
expression of opinion which is the right of any
American, Charles Lindbergh has been casti
gated as the undesirable type of citizen.

He has been bitterly attacked by the highest
authorities in this country. And yet, never has
issue been made on what he said, but rather on
the fact that he said it. His fundamental argu
ments have not been touched—rather it has been
the right to express free opinion which has been
denied.
In a country at peace, with no open military
commitments, an average American expressed
a belief. Perhaps Charles Lindbergh is truly to
be censured for this essential fact—and yet, if
we censure him, can you or can I be proud that
we live in a nation which adopted a great
Frenchman's words:
"I may not believe in what you say, but I will
defend to the death your right to say it."

a belief. Perhaps Charles Lindbergh is truly to

ONE of the most interesting, yet at the same
time unamusing, aspects of the current
American political scene has been the case
against Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh.
Bombarded and bombasted by Administra
tion leaders and hangers-on, first for his testi
mony on the Lease-Lend witness stand, Lind
bergh met heavy official censure last Friday
when the President termed the Colonel's view
point as being against the best interests of his
country.

Charles Lindbergh has lived an amazing life.
A life that pushed him from comparative ob
scurity to one of the highest hero pedestals that
any American has occupied within the memory
of this generation.

In 1927, as the "Lone Eagle," the smiling
American boy who conguered the Atlantic in
his solo New York to Paris flight, Lindy wrung
heartfelt praise from the people of every nation
in Europe. This country, the land of his birth,
hailed him as the "shining, unguenchable spirit
of America."

Charles Lindbergh won a lasting niche in
the hall of fame for that one deed. But the
"unquenchable spirit" led him on.
Lindy advanced in another field, and together
with Dr. Alexis Carrel heaped more laurel leaves
upon his brow with his work on the "mechani
cal heart" in the field of medical science.

Again, as one of the ranking aeronautical
experts of the world, Charles Lindbergh per
sonally inspected the air fleets of Europe, an
opportunity tendered no other man.

Short years ago the "unquenchable" Lind
bergh and his wife, the former Anne Morrow,
lost their infant son in the famous Hauptmann
case that brought tears to the eyes of millions
of reader-Americans. Lindbergh was again a
national name—this time in a way that made his
fellow men sympathize with and revere him as
only Americans can. *

Yes, Charles A. Lindbergh had carved his
name among the list of immortal Americans
many times over. He could have been a na
tional hero forever.

And yet, because of burning internal convic
tions, Lindy told his country what he believed.
And he said the words he could have kept be
cause he thought them to be truths.

He could not have but known that what he
said could cost him the reverence and love of
his countrymen. But he did not hesitate—be
cause he thought he was right.

Charles Lindbergh's testimony on the stand
in the Lend-Lease hearing brought shame upon
the Lone Eagle'' who had carried his country's
name to the far corners of the world. The "shin
ing, unquenchable spirit of America" was smoth
ered beneath the cry of "un-Americanism."

And now, because again he chose to express
a firm conviction that he knew was contrary to
official thought and publication, Charles Lind
bergh has been derogated as an "appeaser" of
the most dangerous sort.

I have read the word-by-word testimony which
Lindbergh gave during the Lend-Lease hearing.
And I have with considerable curiosity watched
his recent statements and opinions.
Nowhere, in either instance, has Colonel Lind
bergh expressed, or professed to express, any
other opinion than that of an average American
citizen.
And for this, for testimony which he was
urged to give on the witness stand and for the
expression of opinion which is the right of any
American, Charles Lindbergh has been casti
gated as the undesirable type of citizen.

He has been bitterly attacked by the highest
authorities in this country. And yet, never has
issue been made on what he said, but rather on
the fact that he said it. His fundamental argu
ments have not been touched—rather it has been
the right to express free opinion which has been
denied.

He has been bitterly attacked by the highest
authorities in this country. And yet, never has
issue been made on what he said, but rather on
the fact that he said it. His fundamental argu
ments have not been touched—rather it has been
the right to express free opinion which has been
denied.
In a country at peace, with no open military
commitments, an average American expressed
a belief. Perhaps Charles Lindbergh is truly to
be censured for this essential fact—and yet, if
we censure him, can you or can I be proud that
we live in a nation which adopted a great
Frenchman's words:
"I may not believe in what you say, but I will
defend to the death your right to say it."
ONE of the most interesting, yet at the same
time unamusing, aspects of the current
American political scene has been the case
against Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh.
Bombarded and bombasted by Administra
tion leaders and hangers-on, first for his testi
mony on the Lease-Lend witness stand, Lind
bergh met heavy official censure last Friday
when the President termed the Colonel's view
point as being against the best interests of his
country.

Charles Lindbergh has lived an amazing life.
A life that pushed him from comparative ob
scurity to one of the highest hero pedestals that
any American has occupied within the memory
of this generation.

In 1927, as the "Lone Eagle," the smiling
American boy who conguered the Atlantic in
his solo New York to Paris flight, Lindy wrung
heartfelt praise from the people of every nation
in Europe. This country, the land of his birth,
hailed him as the "shining, unguenchable spirit
of America."

Charles Lindbergh won a lasting niche in
the hall of fame for that one deed. But the
"unquenchable spirit" led him on.
Lindy advanced in another field, and together
with Dr. Alexis Carrel heaped more laurel leaves
upon his brow with his work on the "mechani
cal heart" in the field of medical science.

Again, as one of the ranking aeronautical
experts of the world, Charles Lindbergh per
sonally inspected the air fleets of Europe, an
opportunity tendered no other man.

Short years ago the "unquenchable" Lind
bergh and his wife, the former Anne Morrow,
lost their infant son in the famous Hauptmann
case that brought tears to the eyes of millions
of reader-Americans. Lindbergh was again a
national name—this time in a way that made his
fellow men sympathize with and revere him as
only Americans can. *

Yes, Charles A. Lindbergh had carved his
name among the list of immortal Americans
many times over. He could have been a na
tional hero forever.

And yet, because of burning internal convic
tions, Lindy told his country what he believed.
And he said the words he could have kept be
cause he thought them to be truths.

He could not have but known that what he
said could cost him the reverence and love of
his countrymen. But he did not hesitate—be
cause he thought he was right.

Charles Lindbergh's testimony on the stand
in the Lend-Lease hearing brought shame upon
the Lone Eagle'' who had carried his country's
name to the far corners of the world. The "shin
ing, unquenchable spirit of America" was smoth
ered beneath the cry of "un-Americanism."

And now, because again he chose to express
a firm conviction that he knew was contrary to
official thought and publication, Charles Lind
bergh has been derogated as an "appeaser" of
the most dangerous sort.

I have read the word-by-word testimony which
Lindbergh gave during the Lend-Lease hearing.
And I have with considerable curiosity watched
his recent statements and opinions.
Nowhere, in either instance, has Colonel Lind
bergh expressed, or professed to express, any
other opinion than that of an average American
citizen.
And for this, for testimony which he was
urged to give on the witness stand and for the
expression of opinion which is the right of any
American, Charles Lindbergh has been casti
gated as the undesirable type of citizen.

He has been bitterly attacked by the highest
authorities in this country. And yet, never has
