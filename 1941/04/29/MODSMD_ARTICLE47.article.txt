dents, after reading Bull Session this quarter, may
have lost sight of the fact that there have been
some extremely talented writers cavorting in this

years. The following appeared Nov. 20, 1939, and

in Prague by the German invaders for refusing to
submerge their intellects to a totalitarian philoso
phy of life.â€”Jerry Mayer)
