## "THEY ALSO SERVE..." 
### 
rpHE EDITOR, SIR:
I should like to take this opportunity to thank
the Stanford Student Body for its sincere co-operation
during the past week on the Stanford Convalescent
Home Drive. Without its support little could have
been accomplished.
Now that the clouds of smoke have cleared, we
find Jess Hazlctt still sitting up in Room 13 counting
the generous sums that the Student Body and the
residents of Palo Alto were so kind as to donate to
our very worthy cause.
I wish especially to express my thanks to my co
workers and the unsung heroes who did the support
ing roles. Numbered in the latter is The Stanford
Daily, for consistently helpful publicity.
The result of the student body's generosity, both
in working and contributing, speaks for itself. I want
to thank you all for your sharing of the responsibility
of making the Drive a success.
Sincerely,
Graham Barbey
