# BILL TURNER DESCRIBES F.D.R.

(Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of
articles in which Bill Turner, Stanford's repre
sentative to a four-University meeting with
President Roosevelt, tells of first-hand experi
ences in our nation's capital. Turner will continue
the story in tomorrow's issue.)

Probably the best way 1 can begin to tell about
my trip to Washington and points East is to an
swer the many questions which have been asked
me since my return one week ago. The most nu
merous questions, however, centered around the
President and the First Lady.

Everyone I've talked to about the trip has even
tually asked me, "What kind of a man is the
President?" and "How did you like 'Eleanor'?"
Truthfully, 90 per cent of my questioners have re
ferred to Mrs. Roosevelt by her first name without
even showing a trace of implied humor. Everyone
seems to think of her as "Eleanor."

This was especially true of "Shorty" Grannis,
who asked me questions about the Roosevelt family
just as though he were one of them. (You can't
blame him for feeling that way.) Incidentally,
Shorty asked me if F.D.R. talked "that way" in
real life. When I answered in the negative, poor
Shorty looked terrifically disappointed and disillu
sioned.
Seriously, though, the morning that we students
interviewed Mr. Roosevelt, he looked just as he
does in most of the newsreels. When we walked
through his office door we were greeted by the
same smiling, sun-bronzed face that we had seen so
many times at the movies and in Sunday supple
ments. Mrs. Kermit Roosevelt, who accompanied
our group, smilingly greeted the President with a
big kiss; then introduced each of us to the Presi
dent. Frankly, I expected the Supreme Executive

to be busy with so many other things that we
would just meet him and run, but, contrary to my
expectations, he was in a very genial, cordial mood.
He was so unnoticeably condescending in his atti
tude toward us that he impressed me as being "one
of the boys."

The meeting with the President lasted for about
15 minutes. Mr. Roosevelt was very witty in telling
us about the fishing excursion from which he had
returned the day before. It seems that everyone
except the Chief got seasick on the voyage. In
fact, said the President laughingly, Harry Hopkins
had declared that his days of fishing were over.

Unfortunately, we did not talk about the war or
about how Stanford students could avoid the draft.
We did, of course, discuss the part that the college
students can play in sending supplies to those in
Britain who have been bombed out of their homes,
which topic I shall discuss later.
Originally, it was my idea that, if it were at all
possible, I would try to summarize the "typical col
lege attitude" to the President. I had hopes of tell
ing him that many, probably most, Stanford stu
dents were willing to send material aid to the
British but. that no one wanted to become involved
in military combat. 1 also had high ambitions of
inquiring about the future draft policy and also
whether or not we "would go into war.

My high ambitions were defeated when a man
I met on the train outside of Chicago told me a
story of the newspaper reporter who hoped to get
the same information I wanted from the President.
This reporter asked the President how soon we
would be in war and also would medical students
be exempted from the draft. He received a cold
answer that only time and Congress would tell.
Well, after a little thought on the subject, I decided
not to pose any of those "unanswerables" to Presi
dent of the United States.

in military combat. 1 also had high ambitions of
inquiring about the future draft policy and also
whether or not we "would go into war.

My high ambitions were defeated when a man
I met on the train outside of Chicago told me a
story of the newspaper reporter who hoped to get
the same information I wanted from the President.
This reporter asked the President how soon we
would be in war and also would medical students
be exempted from the draft. He received a cold
answer that only time and Congress would tell.
Well, after a little thought on the subject, I decided
not to pose any of those "unanswerables" to Presi
dent of the United States.
(Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of
articles in which Bill Turner, Stanford's repre
sentative to a four-University meeting with
President Roosevelt, tells of first-hand experi
ences in our nation's capital. Turner will continue
the story in tomorrow's issue.)

Probably the best way 1 can begin to tell about
my trip to Washington and points East is to an
swer the many questions which have been asked
me since my return one week ago. The most nu
merous questions, however, centered around the
President and the First Lady.

Everyone I've talked to about the trip has even
tually asked me, "What kind of a man is the
President?" and "How did you like 'Eleanor'?"
Truthfully, 90 per cent of my questioners have re
ferred to Mrs. Roosevelt by her first name without
even showing a trace of implied humor. Everyone
seems to think of her as "Eleanor."

This was especially true of "Shorty" Grannis,
who asked me questions about the Roosevelt family
just as though he were one of them. (You can't
blame him for feeling that way.) Incidentally,
Shorty asked me if F.D.R. talked "that way" in
real life. When I answered in the negative, poor
Shorty looked terrifically disappointed and disillu
sioned.
Seriously, though, the morning that we students
interviewed Mr. Roosevelt, he looked just as he
does in most of the newsreels. When we walked
through his office door we were greeted by the
same smiling, sun-bronzed face that we had seen so
many times at the movies and in Sunday supple
ments. Mrs. Kermit Roosevelt, who accompanied
our group, smilingly greeted the President with a
big kiss; then introduced each of us to the Presi
dent. Frankly, I expected the Supreme Executive

to be busy with so many other things that we
would just meet him and run, but, contrary to my
expectations, he was in a very genial, cordial mood.
He was so unnoticeably condescending in his atti
tude toward us that he impressed me as being "one
of the boys."

The meeting with the President lasted for about
15 minutes. Mr. Roosevelt was very witty in telling
us about the fishing excursion from which he had
returned the day before. It seems that everyone
except the Chief got seasick on the voyage. In
fact, said the President laughingly, Harry Hopkins
had declared that his days of fishing were over.

Unfortunately, we did not talk about the war or
about how Stanford students could avoid the draft.
We did, of course, discuss the part that the college
students can play in sending supplies to those in
Britain who have been bombed out of their homes,
which topic I shall discuss later.
Originally, it was my idea that, if it were at all
possible, I would try to summarize the "typical col
lege attitude" to the President. I had hopes of tell
ing him that many, probably most, Stanford stu
dents were willing to send material aid to the
British but. that no one wanted to become involved
in military combat. 1 also had high ambitions of
inquiring about the future draft policy and also
whether or not we "would go into war.

Unfortunately, we did not talk about the war or
about how Stanford students could avoid the draft.
We did, of course, discuss the part that the college
students can play in sending supplies to those in
Britain who have been bombed out of their homes,
which topic I shall discuss later.
Originally, it was my idea that, if it were at all
possible, I would try to summarize the "typical col
lege attitude" to the President. I had hopes of tell
ing him that many, probably most, Stanford stu
dents were willing to send material aid to the
British but. that no one wanted to become involved
in military combat. 1 also had high ambitions of
inquiring about the future draft policy and also
whether or not we "would go into war.

My high ambitions were defeated when a man
I met on the train outside of Chicago told me a
story of the newspaper reporter who hoped to get
the same information I wanted from the President.
This reporter asked the President how soon we
would be in war and also would medical students
be exempted from the draft. He received a cold
answer that only time and Congress would tell.
Well, after a little thought on the subject, I decided
not to pose any of those "unanswerables" to Presi
dent of the United States.
