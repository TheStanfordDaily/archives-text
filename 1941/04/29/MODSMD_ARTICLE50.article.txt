r I I HE EDITOR, SIR:
I've always wanted to bust into print with a cut
ting bit of literature complaining about conditions on
the Farm, but until last week I could never find any
thing at Stanford that wasn't just about perfect. How
ever, last Tuesday, while watching twelve of the best
collegiate tennis players in the country perform in
the Miami-Stanford matches, I found something wrong.
Watching this excellent show were about 50 stu
dents. As Gardner Mulloy, the Miami coach, said, if
the matches were played in Florida there would be
5000 out to see them. Why, I asked myself, weren't
there more than 50 spectators today? It isn't because
Stanford students arc nauseated by good clean com
petition. It isn't because the price was prohibitive (an
even nothing to those with or without student body
cards.) *
It must be because the people don't know about the
matches. Why is this? (All this conversation is going
on between myself during the third set of the crucial
match.) The reason the students aren't out is be
cause the only mention of the match in The Daily was
a little three-inch piece hidden among the asinine
fillers on the second page, while the sports page was
cluttered up with quarter-page house ads, pictures
of New York Giant Mel Ott sliding into second, and
four-day old frosh baseball stories.
This appalling situation not only isn't fair to the
students, but to those Miami netmen, who came all
the way across the country to be confronted by this
mere handful.
Lovesick
