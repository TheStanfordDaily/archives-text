"WILLIAM," by E. 11. Young: The
Readers Club Press.
Lots of good books come out each
year; but what with tfie welter of
publicity designed to promote a cer
tain arbitrary number of best-sell
ers, some of the really good ones
go by the boards and slip into ob
scurity.
And that is the reason for the new
Readers Club. Several of the more
important members of the literati,
Carl Van Doren, Alexander Wool
cott, Clifton Fadiman, and Sinclair
Lewis, suddenly realized the enor
mity of this situation and decided to
give certain forgotten gems a new
chance in the world. They come
once a month and they cost a dollar
each. You don't have to take them
if you don't want them. Single cop
ies are on sale at the bookshops for
$1.50.
A FAMILY PLOT
First of the books is "William," by
E. H. Young, published in 1926. Per
haps the very contents and subject
of the volume doomed it, then. Not
that it isn't good (it's superb), but
it's so quietly keyed, and delicately
written that its very dignity pre
cluded ballyhoo.
The key character is William, an
Englishman with four grown-up
daughters and a son, all of whom
he loves very much. Suddenly the
even, easy stream of their upper
middle class existence is broken
when one of the married daughters
leaves her husband to elope with a
writer. This is certainly not an un
hackneyed situation; but since the
time is pre-war provincial, the reper
cussions are far more than they
would be now.
QUIET CHARACTERS
Each of the daughters is a defined,
decisive unit: Mabel, so good and
righteous it's painful; Lydia is self
ish, elusive and shimmering; Dora,
solid family woman with a vague
longing for a more happy marriage;
and Janet, the young unmarried
daughter who doesn't laugh, and
seldom shows her amazing re

serve of strength.
In his dealings with them and
with his emotional wife William
quietly takes them as they are, us
ing his amazing perceptions and
quiet humor to help when he can,
always wise, and tactful.
Van Doren, in his foreword, points
out that these people in their remote,
settled life symbolize the amazing
"quiet people" of England whose
spirit is now taking all that Hitler's
war can offer. This is true; but it
isn't necessary. Young was not a
prophet, and he certainly had no
such symbolism in mind. He was
doing a character study and it's a
fine piece of woi'k.â€”Nowell
