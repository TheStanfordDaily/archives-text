SHIPMENT of any war material
tlirough the Soviet Union has
been forbidden by a decree promul
gated by A. I. Mikoyan, foreign
trade commissar.
Specifically there will be no ship
ment of munitions, aircraft parts
and accessories, machines and tools
for making munitions, explosives
and poisons. All other goods will be
regulated only by special authoriza
tion or under terms of trade agree
ments.
There you have it. Moscow tossed
this laconic announcement into the
world picture with a thud last night.
And then shut up.
Well, so what?
Immediately reams of copy live
times as long as the original story
came through giving both the
Washington and London reactions
to and speculations upon the
meaning of the decree. Nothing,
however, has come through from
Berlin and Tokyo yet; and it is
probable that 110 one will know
just what it means until we get
the Nazi and Japanese reactions.
London was a little leery of the
anouncement, and pointed out that
it might only mean that the Soviets
are txying to "appease" Germany by
blocking transit through Russia of
Swedish armaments destined for
Turkey. These shipments are not
particularly large as far as we know,
but cutting them off would certainly
mean a blow to the Turkish armed
forces.
On the other hand the London
"experts" speculated, it might mean
a definite effort to stop the German-
Japanese arms traffic which, it is
assumed, would be largely one way
—in the direction of Tokyo.

IN,l N , Washington the unofiiical, but
informed circles were pleased as
punch. To their way of thinking it
meant that Russia is adopting self
protective measures dictated by Ger
many's quick conquest of the Bal
kans, and indicated that the U.S.S.R.
is getting more and more scared of
a German thrust into the Ukraine.
All of these guesses are logical,
and maybe they are all true. No
paradox is involved in the two
London speculations if you re
member that the Swedish part of
the deal could be used as a cover
lip explanation to soothe Berlin—
though it is doubtful if it would
work for long.
But there are a couple of other
angles involved in this Swedish mu
nitions business. If Sweden is ship
ping arms to Turkey she's probably
sending them, via the same routes,
to Iran (Persia) and Afghanistan,
both spheres of British interest. And
is Sweden really sending through
these arms? After all, she is com
pletely surrounded and at the mercy
of the Reich. Her iron ore is vital
to Germany, and she would certainly
not be operating in open opposition
to Nazi interests. It's hard to see
how she'd dare.

| OOKING at the matter from the
J pro-democracy point of view,
the decree could be vital to both
Germany and to Japan. Japan's war
in China has long been of Russian
concern, and her policy up to the
signing of the Russo-Japanese non
aggression pact last week had been
to prolong the war as long as pos
sible. Much of the speculation on
this pact centered around future
Russ aid to China.
It's hard to see what percentage
there would be for the Soviet in a
Japan-dominated China, but then
it's hard to see how the Russian
diplomatic mind works anyway.
Japan is getting war material and
equipment from Germany, but Ger
many is getting vital raw materials
from Japan. And what's more, much
of this raw material comes indirectly
from the United States and South
America. If this is what the Rus
sians mean, it's going to be quite a
headache to the gentlemen in Ber
lin. From the U.S. viewpoint, the
imminent war in the South Pacific
might possibly be staved oft by the
resultant prolongation of the China
Incident.
Kipling called Russia the Bear
that Walks Like a Man, and gave
him credit for being a pretty cagey
character. Obviously the Soviets
are being cagey again. But the ques
tion is—how?
