Bill Turner, Stanford's representa
tive to the Four-University meet
ing with President Roosevelt.)

My conclusion was that Mr. Roose
velt is an outstanding man and a
truly great personality. In his pri
vate discussion with us, he com
pletely dropped the majestic "MY
Friends" approach and seemed like
a real good guy. Of course, when
I told some of my fraternity broth
ers this, they accused me of being
prejudiced, a rabid young Demo
crat. They couldn't possibly see how
I could be so impressed with a man
who advocated such a foreign pol
icy. Nevertheless, be his policies
what they may, Mr. Roosevelt, the
man, stands as one whom the
American people can be rightfully
proud to have as their leader.
Just after our meeting with the
President, we ran into the First
Lady, who was returning from her
daily horseback ride. Not a beauty
to say the least, Mrs. Roosevelt com
pletely captivates her company with
her charming personality and quick
wittedness. After we had met her,
she told us some of the inside dope
about "Frank," her way of refer
ring to her husband. She told us
how angry he sometimes becomes at
the obstinate photographers who
keep telling the President to "hold
that pose." After our little chat it
was easy to see why he would lose
his patience with these men. All
the while we talked, the atmosphere
was like that of a bombardment, so
many flashlight, bulbs glared and so
many intrusive photographers were
demanding repeat poses.
Mrs, Roosevelt was very gracious
about, showing us the upper floor of
the White House, where the presi
dential family and guests reside. She
seemed to be greatly interested in
the accomplishments of Abe Lincoln,
for to her each room of the White
House had .some special significance
in connection with Lincoln's term as
president. We passed through the
room where Lincoln's original wal
nut bedroom set .rested in its cold
splendor. Harry Hopkins was liv
ing in the room in which Lincoln
had signed the Emanicpation Proc
lamation. Mr. Hopkins was seated
at his desk (looking a little peaked
from his recent seasickness) and
was working industriously. In pass
ing we said a quick "hello," but did
not stop to bother him.
It was from her own sitting room,
Mrs. Roosevelt explained, that Lin
coln witnessed the decisive retreat
of the Confederates at the second
Battle of Bull Run. Her sitting
room was chuck full of paintings
and' photographs of the family. Pic
tures of everyone from "Sistie" and
' Buz/.ie' to Daddy Frank were
hanging on the wall.
Summed up, our meeting with
the President and Mrs. Roosevelt
did not have the air of a diplomatic
mission, but was more on a friendly
basis. To me it was one of those ex
periences that one dreams about in
early youth but expects never to
come true. But it did come true,
and it. was great to hobnob with
the nation's First family.

man, stands as one whom the
American people can be rightfully
proud to have as their leader.
Just after our meeting with the
President, we ran into the First
Lady, who was returning from her
daily horseback ride. Not a beauty
to say the least, Mrs. Roosevelt com
pletely captivates her company with
her charming personality and quick
wittedness. After we had met her,
she told us some of the inside dope
about "Frank," her way of refer
ring to her husband. She told us
how angry he sometimes becomes at
the obstinate photographers who
keep telling the President to "hold
that pose." After our little chat it
was easy to see why he would lose
his patience with these men. All
the while we talked, the atmosphere
was like that of a bombardment, so
many flashlight, bulbs glared and so
many intrusive photographers were
demanding repeat poses.
Mrs, Roosevelt was very gracious
about, showing us the upper floor of
the White House, where the presi
dential family and guests reside. She
seemed to be greatly interested in
the accomplishments of Abe Lincoln,
for to her each room of the White
House had .some special significance
in connection with Lincoln's term as
president. We passed through the
room where Lincoln's original wal
nut bedroom set .rested in its cold
splendor. Harry Hopkins was liv
ing in the room in which Lincoln
had signed the Emanicpation Proc
lamation. Mr. Hopkins was seated
at his desk (looking a little peaked
from his recent seasickness) and
was working industriously. In pass
ing we said a quick "hello," but did
not stop to bother him.
It was from her own sitting room,
Mrs. Roosevelt explained, that Lin
coln witnessed the decisive retreat
of the Confederates at the second
Battle of Bull Run. Her sitting
room was chuck full of paintings
and' photographs of the family. Pic
tures of everyone from "Sistie" and
' Buz/.ie' to Daddy Frank were
hanging on the wall.
Summed up, our meeting with
the President and Mrs. Roosevelt
did not have the air of a diplomatic
mission, but was more on a friendly
basis. To me it was one of those ex
periences that one dreams about in
early youth but expects never to
come true. But it did come true,
and it. was great to hobnob with
the nation's First family.

My conclusion was that Mr. Roose
velt is an outstanding man and a
truly great personality. In his pri
vate discussion with us, he com
pletely dropped the majestic "MY
Friends" approach and seemed like
a real good guy. Of course, when
I told some of my fraternity broth
ers this, they accused me of being
prejudiced, a rabid young Demo
crat. They couldn't possibly see how
I could be so impressed with a man
who advocated such a foreign pol
icy. Nevertheless, be his policies
