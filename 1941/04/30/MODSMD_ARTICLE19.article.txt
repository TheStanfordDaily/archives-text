# Harpsichordist Displays Talent

### 
Memories of the old music box on
grandmother's dressing table came
back last night as Madame Alice
Ehlers presented a concert on her
harpsichord for the Tuesday Eve
ning Series.
The harpsichord had a certain
tinkle, then a jangle. At times it
sounded like a harp, then again like
a piano. As a matter of fact, the
harpsichord is a harp with a key
board, a little bigger than a concert
grand piano.
Madame Ehlers opened her pro
gram with the very difficult "Varia
tions of the Harmonious Black
smith" by Handel. As the story goes,
according to the soloist, Handel
wrote the composition while trying
to sleep when a blacksmith was at
work. The loud pounding, then the
faint tinkle of the blacksmith's
hammer could easily be distin
guished.
In contrast to the loudness and
sweeping movements of her first
number, Madame Ehlers played the
"very, very delicate" "Fugue from
the Magnificat," by Pachelbel. This
number had to be interpreted with
such a light touch that it could
scarcely be heard in the back rows
of the Memorial Hall Auditorium.
Madame Ehlers described her
third number as "characteristic of
the double keyboard of the harpsi
chord." It was Bach's "Toccata in
G Majorâ€”First Movement." The se
lection was interspersed with many
echo effects. It was at this point
that the reviewer had to leave to
make deadline.
Madame Ehlers was 45 minutes
late in arriving for the concert be
cause of the weather which delayed
her plane trip from Los Angeles
and forced her to land in Oakland
instead of San Francisco. Dr. War
ren D. Allen filled in with an im
promptu lecture on keyboard iri
instruments.
