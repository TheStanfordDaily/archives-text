# Germany Threatens U.S. Convoy, Supply Vessels With 'Rapid Sinking'
## 'Nazi Blockade Waiting on All Lanes Between America, England,' Warns Influential Hitler Press

BERLIN, April 2!) (UP). â€”Germany warned the United State* today
any attempt to convoy or carry war supplies to Britain can result only
in the "rapid sinking of American ships."
The blockade of German weapons is waiting on all routes between
America and England," said the influential Dcutsch Algemenine Zeitung.

Regarding the extension of the
American neutrality patrol zone the
newspaper said:
"Americans would do well to
harbor no illusions. With or with
out the use of their own warships,
traveling in convoys or alone, all
war deliveries fundamentally are
'good for sinking'."
A steadily intensifying "hate cam
paign" against the United States ap
peared to be devised to prepare the
German people for the possibility of
American entry into the war and to
let Washington and the world know
Germany was watching closely and
preparing for any eventuality.
For a week the controlled Nazi
press has displayed prominently the
news of efforts to keep the United
States out of the war, playing up
statements by Col. Charles A. Lind
bergh and Sen. Burton K. Wheeler.
