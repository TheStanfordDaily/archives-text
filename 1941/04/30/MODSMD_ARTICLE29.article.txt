The 1940-41 Yearbook of Stanford Writing will be an anthology of the
best of the Stanford student writing for the past year, according to John
Collins, president of the Stanford Writing Club. It will contain stories
by Charles Trieschmann, Marion McClanahan. John Collins, Glen Holland,
A1 Zelver, Natalie Boyle, Dick Dvvan, Belle Leonard and Jack llierony-

mcus, and short prose l»y others. i
Colgate Dorr, Wendy Downey,
Betty Bowe, Jean Schwartz, Rich
ard McCann, Robert Aibright, and
others will have selections of poetry
in it.
Stories running from the O. Henry
surprise ending type through the
modem American strip style, to pro
found psychological studies and
problem studies together with poems
written in both experimental and
conventional style will be included
in this Fiftieth Anniversary Year
book.
The various stories submitted were
judged by writers and authorities on
the short story: Professor Edith Mir
rielees of Stanford; Charles G. Nor
ris, whose novels have long been
popular with the American public;
and Louis Paul, whose stories ap
pear continually in periodicals, es
pecially "Esquire."
From the fifty manuscripts which
were submitted ten winners were
chosen. Louis Paul said that the
manuscripts showed a level of ex
cellence which amazed him. "They
show strong imaginative minds, re
markably adept at expressing them
selves in prose above the level of
that which appears in most of the
so-called slick publications."
Especially illustrated and bound
with emphasis on the Fiftieth Anni
versary of Stanford University, it
will contain 75 per cent prose and
25 per cent poetry, and will sell at
a pre-publication price of 75 cents.
Writing Club agents are going to
the various living groups and or
ders may also be placed in the club
room of the Writing Club in the
basement of the English Corner.
