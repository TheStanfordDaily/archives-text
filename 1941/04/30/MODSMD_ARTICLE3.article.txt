# Tour Delegate Positions Open
## 
### 
With several positions still open
on the list of six official Stanford
delegates to the American-Japanese
Student Conference scheduled for
this summer, deadline for the final
choice was extended until Friday.
Students interested in attending
the conference as Farm delegates
should contact Ned Pugh, Hugh O'-
Donnell or Bill Turner as soon as
possible.
The conference will be held dur
ing the first week in August on the
University of Washington campus.
From 75 to 100 American student
delegates will be present, as well as
50 Japanese students who will make
the trip over from Japan. Fourteen
American universities will be repre
sented in the conference.
Interviews were held earlier in
the week for the six delegates and
ten alternates. Several positions are
still open from the original turnout,
Pugh said, which was not as large as
at first expected.
The purpose of the conference is
to promote better relations between
the two countries. The delegates in
their round table discussions also
attempt to reach a better under
standing of the various problems fac
ing each country and thus gain in
formation as to the nation's policies.
