# Business School Changes Policy
## First-Year Courses To Be Given Summer 
### 
Announcement was made today by
Dean J .Hugh Jackson of the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business
that the school will introduce first -
year business courses into its 1941
summer quarter. This step was taken
in order to assist in the broad pro- j
gram of national defense and to meet
the continued demand of college
seniors and others for special busi
ness training.
As a result, seniors graduating in
June may enroll at once for the
two-year program in accounting,
statistics, personnel and industrial
relations, factory foremanship, fi
nance, marketing and similar fields.
Heretofore enrollment has not been
possible until October.
Dean Jackson, commenting on this
change in the school's policy, said
yesterday, "A great deal is being
said these days regarding bottle
necks in our national defense pro
gram. Poor planning, inadequate
| subcontracting, bad purchasing, and
similar things are largely the result
I of a serious shortage of trained ex-
I ecutives.
"It is the purpose of the Graduate
School of Business to assist in train
ing such business executives, for in
this .way a genuine contribution can
be made to our national defense
program."
Registration for the Summer
Quarter will occur on June 23.
