# Baseballers Drop Third To Bears, 6-1
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford pounded southpaw Mike
Koll for 12 base knocks yesterday,
but California "jinxed"' its way to
a (J--1 victory over the Indian;; and
climbed into a tie for first place
with St. Mary's in the CIBA.
For the sixth time portsider Koll
and Stanford's Cootie Thompson
tangled on the mound, and Cootie
bested his rival in the "hits scored
off" department, handcuffing the
Bears wiih seven blows while his
mates collected 12.
It wasn't a tenth-inning that bnot
the Redskins yesterday, but some
sloppy base-running in the third
frame lost at least two runs and pos
sibly more for the locals.
BASE' RUNNING
After Hal Costello grounded out
to start the inning, Boch Caruso
clouted his second double and Ray
Hammett beat out an infield roller
to Stan Griffith at third base.
Monte. Pfyl got a hold of Koll's
drop ball and smacked a Texas
leaguer into short right field. Though
some 100-odd wildly partisan fans
screamed, "It's a hit!" Hammett and
Caruso didn't feel the same about it.
And when the ball dropped for a
single they moved ahead only one
base instead of corning home with
two runs.
Catcher Jack Randall slapped a
slow roller down to Jack Albright
at shortstop, and a double play
seemed in the offing. Caruso came
down from third standing up,
knocked the ball out of Carl Ho
berg's hands but forgot to touch the
plate, and stocky Mr. Hoberg picked
the ball up and tagged him out,
leaving the bags loaded with two
out. Elton Boone forced Randall at
second to finish the inning.
KOLL HIT FREELY
Every man on the starting Indian
squad grabbed a hit off Koll save
Thompson. Jack Parsons played
the whole game in right field and
punched out two singles. Randall
also connected for a brace of singles.
Caruso's two doubles were the only
extra-base blows off Koll.
The lanky Berkeley hurler was
stingy with his walks, giving up but
one, while he whiffed five Indians
at the plate. In the last half of the
sixth Koll struck out Boone. Thomp
son. and Alec Cereghino in order.
CARDS ONLY SCORE
Stanford tallied its lone run in the
second stanza. Randall singled and
advanced on Boone's drive through
the pitcher's box. Cereghino lined a
three and two pitch into left field,
scoring Boone. Parsons fiied out to
Hal Cates in left field to end the
inning.
The Indians threatened again in
the fourth, putting men on first and
second with two out, but Koll went
to work with his too-effective drop
and forced Caruso to foul out to
Hoberg.
Thompson struck out four and
walked four in seven innings, but a
single and an error with the bases
bulging in the seventh netted Cali
fornia four clinching runs. With two
away Cootie purposely walked dan
gerous Mr. Griffith, who had already
bounced two hits off him, to fill the
bases.
STR A TEC 1Y BACK FIRES
The strategy backfired, however,
as Albright singled off Pfyl's glove,
scoring two I'uns. Boone heaved the
ball into right field, and Griffith and
Albright waltzed on in with Cal's
fina l runs.
Pfyl came up with the best field
ing play of the day, running in fast
to m;:ke an underhand throw and
nip his man at first by a step.
