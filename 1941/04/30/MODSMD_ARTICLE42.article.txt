T'D LIKE to make a prediction
right here and now concerning
the track team. It's not one of those
hopelessly optimistic guesses which
may be termed sticking one's neck
out.
To get to the point, I feel firmly
ccnvinccd that the Indian track
sters will score more points against
U.S.C. than they were able to
gather against a supposedly infe
rior Cal outfit.
You can't deny a team that, the
very morning after they had taken
the worst beating administered in a
decade of track competition on the
Farm, goes right back to work in
an effort to improve.
That's just what about 15 mem
bers of the track squad did—show
up for a tough workout Sunday
morning without the request of Mr.
Johnson.

TT'LL BE interesting to see what
four members of Coach Clyde
Jeffrey's star studded freshman
track team will be able to do
against some classy competition in
the P.A.A. (Pacific Athletic Associa
tion) meet next Saturday up at Ed
wards Field.
The four frosh tracksters who
are going to ccmpetc are Bill Jos
lyn in the discus. Don Rciss and
Joe Mardesich in the hurdles, and
Beb Waters in the sprints.
Joslyn did 141 feet against the Cal
frosh last Friday and has been im

| proving steadily. But the boys who
j have a real chance of making their
j mark in big time competition are
j Bob Waters and Don Reiss.
Reiss, pushed by a battery of
| swift Sacramento J. C. hurdlers, ran
the highs in 14.8 last week, which
would establish him the favorite
Saturday unless U.S.C.'s Art Kacke
| wicz and Don Hommell show up for
1 the meet.
Waters on the other hand will
! have almost more competition than
| he can handle in the person of per
j haps the worlds fastest human, Hal
! Davis of Salinas J.C. Two times the
conqueror of Clyde Jeffrey last
| year. Davis has already run 20.9 and
(9.5 this year in the sprints.

to be released is the annual
' report of the Pacific Coast Con
ference's so-called "czar" Edwin
Atherton. And there have been
many ominous rumblings concern
ing the part Stanford is to play in
this as yet unpublished report.
After all. Stanford escaped un
harmed from the accusations of
Atherton and Co. last year, so
don't be surprised if the axe de
scends this year en a couple of
freshmen athletes.
In 1901 the University of Nebraska
issued a challenge for an annual
debate with Stanford, and the de
bates are still continuing.

j haps the worlds fastest human, Hal

(9.5 this year in the sprints.

to be released is the annual
' report of the Pacific Coast Con
ference's so-called "czar" Edwin
Atherton. And there have been
many ominous rumblings concern
ing the part Stanford is to play in
this as yet unpublished report.
After all. Stanford escaped un
harmed from the accusations of
Atherton and Co. last year, so
don't be surprised if the axe de
scends this year en a couple of
freshmen athletes.
In 1901 the University of Nebraska
issued a challenge for an annual
debate with Stanford, and the de
bates are still continuing.
T'D LIKE to make a prediction
right here and now concerning
the track team. It's not one of those
hopelessly optimistic guesses which
may be termed sticking one's neck
out.
To get to the point, I feel firmly
ccnvinccd that the Indian track
sters will score more points against
U.S.C. than they were able to
gather against a supposedly infe
rior Cal outfit.
You can't deny a team that, the
very morning after they had taken
the worst beating administered in a
decade of track competition on the
Farm, goes right back to work in
an effort to improve.
That's just what about 15 mem
bers of the track squad did—show
up for a tough workout Sunday
morning without the request of Mr.
Johnson.

TT'LL BE interesting to see what
four members of Coach Clyde
Jeffrey's star studded freshman
track team will be able to do
against some classy competition in
the P.A.A. (Pacific Athletic Associa
tion) meet next Saturday up at Ed
wards Field.
The four frosh tracksters who
are going to ccmpetc are Bill Jos
lyn in the discus. Don Rciss and
Joe Mardesich in the hurdles, and
Beb Waters in the sprints.
Joslyn did 141 feet against the Cal
frosh last Friday and has been im

| proving steadily. But the boys who
j have a real chance of making their
j mark in big time competition are
j Bob Waters and Don Reiss.
Reiss, pushed by a battery of
| swift Sacramento J. C. hurdlers, ran
the highs in 14.8 last week, which
would establish him the favorite
Saturday unless U.S.C.'s Art Kacke
| wicz and Don Hommell show up for
1 the meet.
Waters on the other hand will
