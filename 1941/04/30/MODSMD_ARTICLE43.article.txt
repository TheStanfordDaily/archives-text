Howie Adams will return to Stan
lord. If he does, Stanford has an
assured first place in this event, no
matter with whom they compete.
The loss of Bill Niccolls, Stanford
diver, will be felt seriously. Return
ing are Bob Laverty, Bill Gard, and
Jack Wilkinson.
FROSIi PROMISING
The most promising materia] com
ing up from the frosh is Captain Ted
Munroe, Rey Rule, Tod Gardner and
Pete Lee. Munroe is a 220 and 440
swimmer; Rule swims the sprints
and Lee the backstroke. Gardner
showed a great deal of ability in the
breaststroke this year and is heavily
counted on to aggregate points next
year.
This year's medley relay' team
never lost a race. The tentative team
of next year, composed of Colyear,
Gardner and Smith, will have to
slave to reach this mark, but they
have the ability to do it.
Following prytetV'iil established
by the election of Roy Yitousek and
Bill Weeden as swimming co-cap
tains two years ago. the Stanford
varsity tic ted Don Smith of Long
Reach and Doc Colyear of i J alo Aito
as co-capiains for the next two years.
Both men are sophomores.
The election was held last night
at the annual swimming team ban
quet, tendered to the team by ihe
retiring co-captains Roy Vitousek
and Bill Weeden. The dinner was
held at the Beta house.
CHAMP CALIBER
The team for next year will prob
ably not be of champion caliber but
on the other hand it won't be a
pushover for any outfit on ih • Coast
Key to Indian success will be "Doc"
Colyear, sophomore star of this
year. Colyear is undoubtedly one
of the best distance swimmers in
the West. He is also a goad back
stroker and can be used to advan
tage in Ihe relays.
The biggest "IF" that Coach Nort
Thornton has to cope with is whe
ther or not P.C.C. diving champion
Howie Adams will return to Stan
lord. If he does, Stanford has an
