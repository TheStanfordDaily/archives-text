YOU can't teach an old dog new tricks. That's
tried and it's truthful. You can't.
The old dogs are those persons in America
who experienced, first hand, the belt-tightening,
the fear, the sorrow, and the disgust that came
as a result of the last war. Today they are
twenty years older—but not twenty years wiser.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks. The
tricks of staying out of war.
Just a few weeks ago, Professor Bailey looked
into the pseudo-intelligently lighted faces of
her class, and in acid tones said, "You think
you're so smart, don't you. Oh, I can see it hap
pening all over again. You are just like my stu
dents were before America entered the last war.
At the beginning of this year you said, 'Oh, no,
we'll never get into this war.' But I can see your
minds changing —just like they did back in
1916."
Miss Bailey is right, too. Did you ever stop
a moment and take a complete inventory of the
changes that have taken place in your own
opinion since a year ago today. Your mind has
changed. Your war thoughts, your opinions,
your emotions have changed. And so have the
minds of millions of other Americans like you.
Just a year ago, a Gallup poll revealed that
66 per cent of the United States declared that
"it was more important to keep America at peace
than it was to help Britain win at the risk of war."
In 1939 only 29 per cent of the people were
willing to enter the war "even to prevent a Brit
ish-French defeat."
But today, a Gallup poll showed 68 per cent
willing to have America enter the war rather
than see Britain go down beneath the German
heel and heil.
Rivulets of propaganda, of cracker-box ora
tions, of Allied affiliations, rivulets draining from
a thousand sources, have joined to form a
mighty river which is rushing to the sea of war.
In 1916 Americans said the United States
would never enter the war. They changed their
minds. The United States did, and Americans
regretted the move.
In 1940 Americans said the United States
would never enter the war. Their minds are
changing.—B. A.

twenty years older—but not twenty years wiser.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks. The
tricks of staying out of war.
Just a few weeks ago, Professor Bailey looked
into the pseudo-intelligently lighted faces of
her class, and in acid tones said, "You think
you're so smart, don't you. Oh, I can see it hap
pening all over again. You are just like my stu
dents were before America entered the last war.
At the beginning of this year you said, 'Oh, no,
we'll never get into this war.' But I can see your
minds changing —just like they did back in
1916."
Miss Bailey is right, too. Did you ever stop
a moment and take a complete inventory of the
changes that have taken place in your own
opinion since a year ago today. Your mind has
changed. Your war thoughts, your opinions,
your emotions have changed. And so have the
minds of millions of other Americans like you.
Just a year ago, a Gallup poll revealed that
66 per cent of the United States declared that
"it was more important to keep America at peace
than it was to help Britain win at the risk of war."
In 1939 only 29 per cent of the people were
willing to enter the war "even to prevent a Brit
ish-French defeat."
But today, a Gallup poll showed 68 per cent
willing to have America enter the war rather
than see Britain go down beneath the German
heel and heil.
Rivulets of propaganda, of cracker-box ora
tions, of Allied affiliations, rivulets draining from
a thousand sources, have joined to form a
mighty river which is rushing to the sea of war.
In 1916 Americans said the United States
would never enter the war. They changed their
minds. The United States did, and Americans
regretted the move.
In 1940 Americans said the United States
would never enter the war. Their minds are
changing.—B. A.
YOU can't teach an old dog new tricks. That's
tried and it's truthful. You can't.
The old dogs are those persons in America
who experienced, first hand, the belt-tightening,
the fear, the sorrow, and the disgust that came
as a result of the last war. Today they are
twenty years older—but not twenty years wiser.
