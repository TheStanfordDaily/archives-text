# Pacific Relations
## 
### 
WHILE the eyes of the nation have been fo
cused eastward toward the European con
flagration, too many of us have apparently for
gotten that away out west across the Pacific lies
another great nation. â€¢
The American-Japanese policy has forged
quietly along with few to mark its course.
In the past few days, strong conservative
newspapers in Japan have been urging Foreign
Minister Matsuoka to visit America to engage
in direct talks with President Roosevelt relative
to a possible accord between these two sover
eign nations.
Such an expression of views, in which a rap
prochement could possibly be reached guaran
teeing legitimate and vital economic outlets for
Japan, and guarantees of similar weight for
America, would be worthy of both nations.
There is little need or reason for a conflict
between Japan and America. Matsuoka himself
has frequently stated that his nation desires no
conflict with ours. And there is no mountainous
barrier between either of our objectives in the
Pacific.
Certain of our statesmen, commenting upon
the present status of Japanese-American rela
tions, have found them to be woefully lacking
in a realistic attempt to grasp and understand
mutual problems.
The legendary Japanese statesman, with his
stoic passiveness and need of "saving face," has
seemingly become so inbred in the minds of our
diplomats that none have made an honest effort
to establish a mutual ground of understanding.
It seems that the possible meeting, which con

servative Japanese papers have been calling lor,
could be encouraged on this side of the Pacific
with great benefit to all. It certainly is worth
a determined try.

Here on our own campus a call is now being
issued for delegates to an American-Japanese
student conference scheduled this summer in
Washington.
Last year's eight Stanford delegates who made
the long trip to Japan returned with sincere re
ports of the progress and understanding effected
by the conferences. Student leaders from picked
American colleges met similarly equipped Jap
anese students and found that after all there
was a great deal of mutual ground to walk upon.
Primed by the splendid successes of last
year s meetings, the conference this summer
will seat between 75 and 100 students from
American colleges. It s a splendid opportunity
for six Stanford undergraduates.
