# BIRTHDAY AT DOORN
## 
### Allen Drury 
H IS seventy-ninth year came to an old man in Hol
land the other day, and for the twentieth time in
as many years, it was not greeted with parades and
celebrations. No guns served notice to the world that
he was a year older; very few headlines proclaimed it;
and in his own country, if anyone remembered about
it, he thought hard and long before saying so.
The old man's birthday, however, did not go quite
unremembered. Various members of his house ar
rived in Doom to be with him, chief among them being
his grandson Louis Ferdinand, with his fiancee, Grand
Duchess Kyra of Russia, herself a holder of a non
existent title in a royal hierarchy which tumbled into
the dust 20 years ago.
Telegrams came, few in comparison with the har
vest of happier days, but enough for an old man to
point with pride. One came from the Fii-st Royal
Dragoons in London, whose honorary colonel the old
man had been before the War; one came from rela
tives who have ignored him since 1914. It was signed
"Bertie, May, and Elizabeth," and the old man was
greatly pleased with this faintly opera-bouffe recog
nition.
But telegrams from the Windsors, and congraula
tions from Royal Dragoons trying in their desperately
British way to be frightfully sporty probably could
not make up to the old man for the glories which are
gone. If he ever pauses for a moment to look back
over the road he has come, the thought that his pomp
is reduced to a family party and his sway over his
people reduced to a few hushed whispers in a Nazi
ridden land must be bitter indeed.
Not that he will ever show that he feels bitter, of
course. Still straight and handsome, his beard and
mustache turned white, but still as Prussian as ever,
his withered left arm no longer sheltered in a trench,
coat but jabbed firmly into the coat pocket of an ordi
nary suit, his whole attitude seems to express com
pletely the words of an old enemy: "lis ne passeront
pas"—They shall not pass.
And the old man seems to be saying that to the
world, to all who laugh at him now, who ignore the
shell of a power which once threw real and utter
terror into more than half the civilized world.

he has been a great legend in his time, this old
man of Holland. Probably no man in all history
has been so hated as he; probably no man has had
heaped upon him the villification and abuse it has
been his lot to receive. That must be one of the things
which amuse him now—if he has had time to develop
a sense of humor during the years he has been in
exile—the fact that he lives almost forgotten today,
tolerated, unfeared, harmless.
And he must be lonely, the old man, as he realizes
that almost all the great names and figures who fought
with or against him in the savage attempt to remake
the surface of the globe are gone. Franz Joseph of
Austria—Von Hindenburg, last representative of the
old Germany — Ramsey MacDonald—Ludendorff —
George of England and Albert of the Belgians—all the
angry brotherhood of power which took its stand across
the opening years of the twentieth century. All but
Lloyd George, the man who wanted to hang him—and
the old man himself.
And looking at what has followed the cataclysm in
which he played so great a part, he must wonder
sometimes just what lay behind it, just what were the
reasons which prompted and justified it. In a world
again on the march, there must sometimes come echo
ing on the wind the sound of other marching feet,
long stilled, and other guns, long dead—and the old
man must wonder—wonder—
But he will probably never tell us what conclusions
he comes to, what answers he finds. For he cannot
admit that he was wrong, or his whole life collapses
in an empty bubble. He can only remember, and never
forget—that he is Wilhelm. An emperor.
