r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
Stanford University is a respectable place; at
least one would think it should be were they to delve
into the transactions of the Dean of Men's office for
the past three years. We then are supposedly either
gentlemen or ladies conforming in all respects to the
general welfare clause (conduct unbecoming, etc.).
This, in short, must of necessity result in the conclu
sion that among us there is some sense of honor, fair
play, and decency. Is there not, then, some inconsist
ency when the University can, without any reason
able provocation, discharge a person who has contrib
uted eleven years of his life to the University's serv
ice without one single demerit (this last from first
hand knowledge?)
It would seem reasonable to expect political cor
ruption in the average police force, but if this is the
respectable place we wish to go on thinking that it
is, I think we students are at least entitled to a few
of (he facts involved in the dismissal of Officer George
Burns.
