# Chaplin Film Scores Hit As Comedy
## 
### 
The Great Dictator —Charlie Chap
lin's first picture in about five years,
took almost that long to make and
cost several million dollars. The
publicity occasioned by the mystery
that surrounded the entire period of
incubation and production led the
American public to expect some
thing epoch-making in film history.
The Great Dictator, however, is
not an epoch-making picture. Nor
is it a great picture or an historical
document as the blurbs predicted.
And I don't think it will make a dent
in film history.
GOOD COMEDY
But for comedy and for pure un
adulterated Chaplin, for laughter
with a tear in your throat, it's as
good as anything he has done, and
that's saying a lot right there.
Poking fun at Hitler without ap
pearing flip is a dangerous task to
say the least. But Chaplin does it
superbly without minimizing the
awful implications of the situation.
His mimicking of the illegitimate
lingo which the Fuehrer calls Ger
man out-Hitlers Hitler, and he has
every gesture, every movement
down pat.
BELOVED TRAMP
And the other half of Chaplin's
dual role is the same beloved tramp
part which has touched the hearts
of millions for twenty-five years.
Perhaps the best scene in the pic
ture is the one where the dictator,
Hynkel, plays with a balloon on
which is painted a map of the world.
He juggles it gracefully from arm
to arm, kicks it around—until it
bursts, and he is left holding a
crumpled scrap of rubber. Fade
out.
SLAPSTICK, TOO
Chaplin remains true to his first
love—slapstick. The scene in which
he, as the dictator and Jack Oakie
as Napaloni, the Bacterian II Dig-a
ditcha, throw fo'od at one another as
they fight over occupation of Osterr
lich, is a little monotonous. A good
touch: In their excitement they slap
quantities of English mustard on
their food and they choke on it. (The
English are too much for both of
them.)
The final speech, in which the little
barber makes an eloquent plea for
humanity and freedom has been a
source of much controversy. Critics
have not been agreed as to whether
it is a good ending for the film.
But I liked it the way it is. Only
time will provide the real end—
Reichert
Half the population of Peru and
Bolivia is native Indian.
