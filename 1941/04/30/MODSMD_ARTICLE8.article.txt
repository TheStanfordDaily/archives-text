# Daily Survey Shows Farm Pays Up on Rubber Checks

### BOB CHANDLER 
Palo Alto banks and stores have very little trouble with Stanford stu
dents when it coines to collecting bad checks or bills, according to a Daily
survey made yesterday afternoon.
The three banks in Paly return an average of three checks per day
to the merchants who presented them. However, the banks find that the

figure doubles in the last week oi
the quarter, an indication that mosl
students are here on a quarterly
allowance basis.
Clothing stores, creameries anc
service stations checked said thai
they had very few bad checks come
in in the course of the year, and
that they find little or no trouble in
collecting.
"Most of the trouble comes from
an inability to add and subtract and
to keep a straight track on the check
stubs," stated the credit manager of
a local store, a statement that was
borne out by the rest of the mer
chandisers 'contacted.
One store stated that they had not
had a bad check in the past ten
years, and at the same time have
very little trouble collecting bills,
while a creamery manager said that
they have had only four or five bad
checks so far this academic year aftd
that they have never yet failed to
collect on these.
The surveys were prompted by
the statement of a Stanford student
yesterday that, a Stanford student
body card is sufficient for identifi
cation almost anyplace in San Fran
cisco when you want to cash a
check, but that cards of other col
leges and universities in this region
are seldom acceptable.
