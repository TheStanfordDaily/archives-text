In spite of the confusion which followed in the wake of
the earthquake, the Stanford Bookstore continued to
grow. Mr. R. M. Stager, the present manager, became
associated with the store as paper man in 1914. At that
time the store did all its own paper manufacturing which
included the making of theme pads, notebook fillers of all
sizes both plain and ruled, and gummed interlining. To
day of course all of these materials are prepared com
mercially. No wonder that an article in the "Daily Palo
Altan" commented on the "convenience of having a store
where one can purchase all necessary supplies."
