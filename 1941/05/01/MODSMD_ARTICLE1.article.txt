/ 'RAZY fool luck is a fine thing
to possess, but just the same it's
a little nebulous for practical use
as an element of war strategy. The
British had better look out, or they'll
begin to count on it as their pecu
liar privilege. They had no business
achieving the "Miracle of Dun
kerque." And now this Greek evac
uation simply puts the matter out of
all reason.
By all the laws of war the B.E.F.
in Greece should have been prac
tically wiped out. There they were
—outnumbered five to one, fighting
a losing battle, forced to clambcr
into their boats from open unpro
tected beaches because the ports
had been bombed out of use, under
constant fire from fierce Stukas
which had complete command of
the air, protected by painfully small
rear-guard units.
And they got 0ut—45,000 out of
05,000 —and, according to Winston
Churchill, maybe even more will
bo able to escape. Mr. Churchill
announced that only 3,000 had
been killed, and the evacuees now
in Cairo cheerfully and modestly
state that man-for-man and unit
for-unit they are better than the
Germans. If you remember the
men at Tobruk have come to the
same conclusion. More important,
however, is that the English claim
to have inflicted telling losses on
the Nazi legions.
The evacuated soldiers could not
get any of their heavy equipment
out of Greece, but the Middle East
Command announces that this can
be replaced quickly enough. Cer
tainly the equipment is no good to
the Germans, who have plenty al
ready.

I [ NLESS the Russians have cracked
under the strain of maintaining
their tricky neutral position, they
said a very significant thing yester
day. "Pravda" is the official Com
munist newspaper, and when it an
nounced that 12.000 Nazi soldiers are
in Finland and hints that they are
threatening the U.S.S.R., it is not
just whistling "Dark Eyes."
If the Finnish government is
tolling the truth when it says that
such troop movements "to Nor
way" were agreed on months ago,
then Russia should have known
about it. "Pravda" is giving the
comrades to think that all is not
rosy with their German ally, or
perhaps hinting that Finland needs
to be "protected."
Coming as it does on the heels of
the decree stopping transit through
Russia of any war material, the
mysterious "Pravda" play-up may be
an added indication of the cooling
relations between the Soviets and
the Nazis.

WtHPHE President wants every
thing expedited like hell,"
Rear Admiral Emory S. Land, chair
man of the Maritime Commisison,
said yesterday in commenting upon
Roosevelt's order for immediate
pooling of 2,000,000 tons of U. S. and
requisitioned foreign shipping from
which Great Britain could draw to
replace tonnage sunk by German
and Italian raiders.
The measure awaits only con
gressional approval of legislation
empowering the President to req
uisition and pay for 150 idle for
eign ships in American ports. The
House will take the measure on
Monday, and the big fight is sup
posed to come in the Senate com
merce committee.
The two phases of the program as
outlined in a letter to Admiral Land
are: first, to arrange for the utili
zation in routes to the combat zone
of foreign ships or ships which are
transferred to foreign registry; and
second to reallocate our own flag
ships in such a way as to make
every cargo directly or indirectly
useful to the United States or the
other democracies.

IF THE United States neutrality
patrol is covering 2000 miles of
ocean right now it isn't too far from
the Madeiro and Azores Islands both
possessions of litle Portugal. If the
war spreads to Spain, thus endan
gering Portugal, watch for U. S. oc
cupation of those islands, probably
through an agreement with that
country. The Canary Islands belong
to Spain, but who knows?

WtHPHE President wants every
thing expedited like hell,"
Rear Admiral Emory S. Land, chair
man of the Maritime Commisison,
said yesterday in commenting upon
Roosevelt's order for immediate
pooling of 2,000,000 tons of U. S. and
requisitioned foreign shipping from
which Great Britain could draw to
replace tonnage sunk by German
and Italian raiders.
The measure awaits only con
gressional approval of legislation
empowering the President to req
uisition and pay for 150 idle for
eign ships in American ports. The
House will take the measure on
Monday, and the big fight is sup
posed to come in the Senate com
merce committee.
The two phases of the program as
outlined in a letter to Admiral Land
are: first, to arrange for the utili
zation in routes to the combat zone
of foreign ships or ships which are
transferred to foreign registry; and
second to reallocate our own flag
ships in such a way as to make
every cargo directly or indirectly
useful to the United States or the
other democracies.

the Madeiro and Azores Islands both
possessions of litle Portugal. If the

through an agreement with that
country. The Canary Islands belong

achieving the "Miracle of Dun

uation simply puts the matter out of
all reason.
By all the laws of war the B.E.F.
in Greece should have been prac
tically wiped out. There they were
—outnumbered five to one, fighting
a losing battle, forced to clambcr
into their boats from open unpro
tected beaches because the ports
had been bombed out of use, under
constant fire from fierce Stukas
which had complete command of
the air, protected by painfully small
rear-guard units.
And they got 0ut—45,000 out of
05,000 —and, according to Winston
Churchill, maybe even more will
bo able to escape. Mr. Churchill
announced that only 3,000 had
been killed, and the evacuees now
in Cairo cheerfully and modestly
state that man-for-man and unit
for-unit they are better than the
Germans. If you remember the
men at Tobruk have come to the
same conclusion. More important,
however, is that the English claim
to have inflicted telling losses on
the Nazi legions.
The evacuated soldiers could not
get any of their heavy equipment
out of Greece, but the Middle East

be replaced quickly enough. Cer

announced that only 3,000 had
been killed, and the evacuees now
in Cairo cheerfully and modestly
state that man-for-man and unit
for-unit they are better than the
Germans. If you remember the
men at Tobruk have come to the
same conclusion. More important,
however, is that the English claim
to have inflicted telling losses on
the Nazi legions.
The evacuated soldiers could not
get any of their heavy equipment
out of Greece, but the Middle East
Command announces that this can
be replaced quickly enough. Cer
tainly the equipment is no good to
the Germans, who have plenty al

I [ NLESS the Russians have cracked
under the strain of maintaining
their tricky neutral position, they
said a very significant thing yester
day. "Pravda" is the official Com
munist newspaper, and when it an
nounced that 12.000 Nazi soldiers are
in Finland and hints that they are
threatening the U.S.S.R., it is not
just whistling "Dark Eyes."
If the Finnish government is
tolling the truth when it says that
such troop movements "to Nor
way" were agreed on months ago,
then Russia should have known
about it. "Pravda" is giving the
comrades to think that all is not
rosy with their German ally, or
perhaps hinting that Finland needs
to be "protected."
Coming as it does on the heels of
the decree stopping transit through
Russia of any war material, the
mysterious "Pravda" play-up may be
an added indication of the cooling
relations between the Soviets and
the Nazis.

WtHPHE President wants every
thing expedited like hell,"
Rear Admiral Emory S. Land, chair
man of the Maritime Commisison,
said yesterday in commenting upon
Roosevelt's order for immediate
pooling of 2,000,000 tons of U. S. and
requisitioned foreign shipping from
which Great Britain could draw to
replace tonnage sunk by German
and Italian raiders.
The measure awaits only con
gressional approval of legislation
empowering the President to req
uisition and pay for 150 idle for
eign ships in American ports. The
House will take the measure on
Monday, and the big fight is sup
posed to come in the Senate com
merce committee.
The two phases of the program as
outlined in a letter to Admiral Land
are: first, to arrange for the utili
zation in routes to the combat zone
of foreign ships or ships which are
transferred to foreign registry; and
second to reallocate our own flag
ships in such a way as to make
every cargo directly or indirectly
useful to the United States or the
other democracies.

IF THE United States neutrality
patrol is covering 2000 miles of
ocean right now it isn't too far from
the Madeiro and Azores Islands both
possessions of litle Portugal. If the
war spreads to Spain, thus endan
gering Portugal, watch for U. S. oc
cupation of those islands, probably
through an agreement with that
country. The Canary Islands belong
to Spain, but who knows?
/ 'RAZY fool luck is a fine thing
to possess, but just the same it's
a little nebulous for practical use
as an element of war strategy. The
British had better look out, or they'll
begin to count on it as their pecu
liar privilege. They had no business
achieving the "Miracle of Dun
kerque." And now this Greek evac
uation simply puts the matter out of
all reason.
By all the laws of war the B.E.F.
in Greece should have been prac
tically wiped out. There they were
—outnumbered five to one, fighting
a losing battle, forced to clambcr
into their boats from open unpro
tected beaches because the ports
had been bombed out of use, under
constant fire from fierce Stukas
which had complete command of
the air, protected by painfully small
rear-guard units.
And they got 0ut—45,000 out of
05,000 —and, according to Winston
Churchill, maybe even more will
bo able to escape. Mr. Churchill
