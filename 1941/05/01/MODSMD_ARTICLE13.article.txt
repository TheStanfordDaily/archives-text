". . . And the insured is to take
the risk of death from hostile In
dians."
This statement is inscribed in
flowing brown letters on a crisp
parchment insurance policy dated
1864 which is part of the Business
School Libraxy's collection of his
toric documents relating to Pacific
Coast business.
The collection, the only one of its
kind on the Coast, numbers some
750 volumes at present, and is still
growing, according to Edwin T.
Coman, librarian of the school.
BUSINESS BACKERS
The collection is largely the work
of Mr. Coman, who confessed that
he had been toying with the idea
for about two years after reading a
commercial history of the Pacific
Coast. He interested several leading
San Francisco businessmen in the
plan and last summer started the
actual work of digging up old rec
ords of Pacific Coast business.
The "excavation" involved prowl
ing around in musty cellars in search
of long-forgotten account books,
chinning with old-timers who "saw
it happen," and inveigling the na
tives to part with the valuable books
which for them held nothing but
sentimental memories.
One old woman told Mr. Coman
that she wanted to hold onto her
business records because she had
been cheated and still had hopes of
finding the culprit. Years ago she
had sold several set of Currier and
Ives prints worth $125 for 75 cents
each to a passing merchant.
PAYROLL RECORDS
A major part of the collection con
sists of the complete set of payroll
records, account books, and journals
of Towne and Bacon, San Francisco
printers who started in 1854. Also
included in the collection are the
business records of Adolph Sutro
and some of his personal papers.
In addition, there are a number of
historical books on individual busi
ness and how they grew.
"The records seem to show that
prices dropped quite rapidly after
the gold rush," Mr. Coman said.
"Whiskey was cheaper, anyway," he
added.
If the old account books are a
true indication, the early business
men were no sissies. Almost every
order on the records ends with the
item, "one pint"—or sometimes "one
gallon of whiskey."
