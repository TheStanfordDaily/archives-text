". . . And the insured is to take
the risk of death from hostile In
dians."
This statement is inscribed in
flowing brown letters on a crisp
parchment insurance policy dated
1864 which is part of the Business
School Libraxy's collection of his
toric documents relating to Pacific
Coast business.
The collection, the only one of its
kind on the Coast, numbers some
750 volumes at present, and is still
growing, according to Edwin T.
Coman, librarian of the school.
BUSINESS BACKERS
The collection is largely the work
of Mr. Coman, who confessed that
he had been toying with the idea
for about two years after reading a
commercial history of the Pacific
Coast. He interested several leading
San Francisco businessmen in the
plan and last summer started the
actual work of digging up old rec
ords of Pacific Coast business.
The "excavation" involved prowl
ing around in musty cellars in search
of long-forgotten account books,
chinning with old-timers who "saw
it happen," and inveigling the na
tives to part with the valuable books
which for them held nothing but
sentimental memories.
One old woman told Mr. Coman
that she wanted to hold onto her
business records because she had
been cheated and still had hopes of
finding the culprit. Years ago she
had sold several set of Currier and
Ives prints worth $125 for 75 cents
each to a passing merchant.
PAYROLL RECORDS
A major part of the collection con
sists of the complete set of payroll
records, account books, and journals
of Towne and Bacon, San Francisco
printers who started in 1854. Also
included in the collection are the
business records of Adolph Sutro
and some of his personal papers.
In addition, there are a number of
historical books on individual busi
ness and how they grew.
"The records seem to show that
prices dropped quite rapidly after
the gold rush," Mr. Coman said.
"Whiskey was cheaper, anyway," he
added.
If the old account books are a
true indication, the early business
men were no sissies. Almost every
order on the records ends with the
item, "one pint"—or sometimes "one
gallon of whiskey."
Probably the most fascinating
angle of the trip, which lasted a
month and took Mr. Coman through
the Mother Lode country and many
of the old mining towns, was the
number of legends which clung to
each town's history.
There is the story of the man in
Sonora in 1850 who paid $100 for a
single sack of flour, and the one
about the Italian who kept his ac
counts in hieroglyphics and charged
a man for a cheese instead of a
grindstone because he "forgot to
draw the hole."
Records of San Francisco business
are hardest to get, according to Mr.
Coman, because they were almost all
destroyed in the earthquake. He has,
however, obtained a rare edition of
an eye-witness account of the 190(5
disaster published toward the close
of that year.
Mr. Coman says that the collection
will continue to expand until it fills
the library and the archives and
"then we'll start asking for a new
building." The field is a limitless
one, he declared, and heretofore un
explored.
Many of the books are at present
on the library shelves and there is
also an exhibit on display in the
glass case in the library.

for about two years after reading a
commercial history of the Pacific
Coast. He interested several leading
San Francisco businessmen in the
plan and last summer started the
actual work of digging up old rec
ords of Pacific Coast business.
The "excavation" involved prowl
ing around in musty cellars in search
of long-forgotten account books,
chinning with old-timers who "saw
it happen," and inveigling the na
tives to part with the valuable books
which for them held nothing but
sentimental memories.
One old woman told Mr. Coman
that she wanted to hold onto her
business records because she had
been cheated and still had hopes of
finding the culprit. Years ago she
had sold several set of Currier and
Ives prints worth $125 for 75 cents
each to a passing merchant.
PAYROLL RECORDS
A major part of the collection con
sists of the complete set of payroll
records, account books, and journals
of Towne and Bacon, San Francisco
printers who started in 1854. Also
included in the collection are the
business records of Adolph Sutro
and some of his personal papers.
In addition, there are a number of
historical books on individual busi
ness and how they grew.
"The records seem to show that
prices dropped quite rapidly after
the gold rush," Mr. Coman said.
"Whiskey was cheaper, anyway," he
added.
If the old account books are a
true indication, the early business
men were no sissies. Almost every
order on the records ends with the
item, "one pint"—or sometimes "one
gallon of whiskey."
Probably the most fascinating
angle of the trip, which lasted a
month and took Mr. Coman through
the Mother Lode country and many
of the old mining towns, was the
number of legends which clung to
each town's history.
There is the story of the man in
Sonora in 1850 who paid $100 for a
single sack of flour, and the one
about the Italian who kept his ac
counts in hieroglyphics and charged
a man for a cheese instead of a
grindstone because he "forgot to
draw the hole."
Records of San Francisco business
are hardest to get, according to Mr.
Coman, because they were almost all
destroyed in the earthquake. He has,
however, obtained a rare edition of
an eye-witness account of the 190(5
disaster published toward the close
of that year.
Mr. Coman says that the collection
will continue to expand until it fills
the library and the archives and
"then we'll start asking for a new
building." The field is a limitless
one, he declared, and heretofore un
explored.
Many of the books are at present
on the library shelves and there is
also an exhibit on display in the
glass case in the library.
". . . And the insured is to take
the risk of death from hostile In
dians."
This statement is inscribed in
flowing brown letters on a crisp
parchment insurance policy dated
1864 which is part of the Business
School Libraxy's collection of his
toric documents relating to Pacific
Coast business.
The collection, the only one of its
kind on the Coast, numbers some
750 volumes at present, and is still
growing, according to Edwin T.
Coman, librarian of the school.
