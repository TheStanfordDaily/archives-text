# Choirs to Sing Here Monday
## 
### 
Seven a cappella choirs will take
part in the annual choral festival
of the Northern California Junior
Colleges which will be held at
Stanford Monday.
The afternoon program, in which
all of the choirs will sing, is not a
contest but a program in which the
choirs will hear and sing for each
other.
After this program Dr. Allen and
Mr. Nanney will play the carillon
and then the visiting choir members
will tour the campus. Anyone who
is interested is invited to act as a
guide and should notify Miss Miles
at the Memorial Church.
The visitors will have dinner at
the Stanford Union. .After dinner
they will listen to a program by
Stanford musical organizations.
The following junior colleges will
participate:
Modesto Junior College, Santa
Rosa Junior College, San Francisco
Junior College, San Mateo Junior
College, Marin Junior College, Yuba
Junior College, and Salinas Junior
College.
