# Farm Finances Rank High In U.S., States Wilbur; Salary Cuts Restored
## President Anticipates Increased Enrollment at Farm Next Year; More Army Training to Be Offered 
### BOB CHANDLER 
"Stanford is not only outstanding among (he universities <»f the country
as regards its financial shape, hut we also expect to have a larger enroll
ment than ever next year," declared President Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
terday.
The statement came in response to a question asked concerning recent

rumors that the University would be<
forced to discontinue classes next I
September because of financial dif- I
ficullies, and that Stanford would !
close its doors if the draft limits
were changed to include men be
tween the ages of 18 and 21.
"The University has never oper
ated with a deficit, and has recently
restored the full 10 per cent salary
cut that was made on May 1, 1933,"
he announced. "The only trouble
that we are having is in obtaining
enough money to enlarge our pres
ent facilities."
DEFERMENT INCREASE
"Recent recommendations of Brig
adier-General Hershey, deputy di
rector of the Selective Service Ad
ministration, have released several
classifications of university students,
and it is probable that the defer
ments will be increased in the fu
ture," Dr. Wilbur said.
These facts, combined with the ef
forts of the University to offer more
training that will benefit students
that are forced to enter the army,
will probably result in an increase
in the size of the Stanford student
body next year, Dr. Wilbur believes.
MERELY RUMORS
"I wouldn't be surprised if the
enemies of the country are circu
lating these rumors in order to get
people stirred up and add to the
general confusion of the period," he
declared. "There may be more of
this sort of thing in the future and
people must learn to watch out for
it.
"This technique has been used by
subversive elements before, and only
works because it is easier for people
to talk than it is for them to check
up on these things," he said.

it.
"This technique has been used by
subversive elements before, and only
works because it is easier for people
to talk than it is for them to check
up on these things," he said.
"Stanford is not only outstanding among (he universities <»f the country
as regards its financial shape, hut we also expect to have a larger enroll
ment than ever next year," declared President Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
terday.
The statement came in response to a question asked concerning recent

rumors that the University would be<
forced to discontinue classes next I
September because of financial dif- I
ficullies, and that Stanford would !
close its doors if the draft limits
were changed to include men be
tween the ages of 18 and 21.
"The University has never oper
ated with a deficit, and has recently
restored the full 10 per cent salary
cut that was made on May 1, 1933,"
he announced. "The only trouble
that we are having is in obtaining
enough money to enlarge our pres
ent facilities."
DEFERMENT INCREASE
"Recent recommendations of Brig
adier-General Hershey, deputy di
rector of the Selective Service Ad
ministration, have released several
classifications of university students,
and it is probable that the defer
ments will be increased in the fu
ture," Dr. Wilbur said.
These facts, combined with the ef
forts of the University to offer more
training that will benefit students
that are forced to enter the army,
will probably result in an increase
in the size of the Stanford student
body next year, Dr. Wilbur believes.
MERELY RUMORS
"I wouldn't be surprised if the
enemies of the country are circu
lating these rumors in order to get
people stirred up and add to the
general confusion of the period," he
declared. "There may be more of
this sort of thing in the future and
people must learn to watch out for
it.
