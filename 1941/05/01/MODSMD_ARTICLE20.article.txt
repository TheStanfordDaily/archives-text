# Linn Moses, Bob Newell Tell Of Debate Trip Through U.S.
## 
### HATTIE FISHER 
Linn Moses and Bob Newell, Stanford's traveling debaters, returned
to the Farm Wednesday with a kaleidoscopic maze of impressions of
tHe women and unions of the 20 colleges they visited, the American
viewpoint on the war, the quality of Eastern debating, and the atmospheres
of the cities where they stayed on their four weeks' tour.

"Western debating is as good as
or better than Eastern debating,"
said Moses. "I still think U.S.C. is
the best in the country, unless we
beat 'em."
Newell claims there is much more
interest in debating in the Eastern
part of the country and attributes
this to the fact that most of the de
bates discussed the United States'
foreign policy.
RABID FEELING
"There's a rabid, almost hysteri
cal feeling about the war back there,"
he said. "Most people are inter
ventionists." He illustrated with an
incident which happened the eve
ning before Easter Sunday in New
York. He and Moses were standing
in line at the Radio City Music Hall
and they started to talk with the
people who were standing in front
of them.
"They were just average middle
cilass people," said Newell, "and
when we told them we were from
Stanford and that we were against
getting into the war, they asked us
who was sponsoring us. They
thought we were the mouthpieces for
some communistic group."
Student unions all over the coun
try arc better than Stanford's, ac
cording to both debaters. Some have
bowling alleys and dance floors, and
two of them sell beer and ale to
the students.
But Stanford women rate above
most colleges. "U.C.L.A.'s are best,
then Stanford's," said Moses.
WASHINGTON BAD
Neither of them liked Washington,
D.C. The weather is too hot. "And
aside from that, it's the hardest
place to get around in I've ever
seen," Moses said. "Why, no one—
not even policemen, taxi drivers or
hotel clerks—know where any place
is." New York is better, he said.
The police there have little books
in which are written everything
from the nearest bar to the best
place to get a strep throat treated.
Most of the debates in which
Moses and Newell participated were
non-decision. In Chicago, however,
they took part, in the congress-con
vention of Delta Sigma Rho, na
tional honorary debate society. Two
floor leaders were elected from the
congress of 500 students, one of them
Newell, the other Moses.
"Stanford is held in respect—al
most awe —all over the country,"
said Newell. "You should see the
cheating that goes on in other col
leges. None of them have an honor
system."
