# Canadian Cruiser Stops U.S. Liner, Grabs Four Homebound Nazi Flyers
## Passengers Joke With Boarders, Toss Cigarettes 
### 
HONOLULU, April 30 (UP).â€”The
Canadian auxiliary cruiser Prince
Itohcrtin seized four German avia
tors from the United States liner
President Garfield 100 miles o(T
Honolulu late yesterday, passengers
revealed when the liner docked here
today.
The Germans, returning to their
homeland from San Francisco, were
the first removed from a United
States ship in this war.
The passengers said the unexpect
ed halting of the President Garfield,
on its maiden voyage to Honolulu,
was taken as a joke until a boarding
party reached their ship.
"I had no alternative but to stop,"
said Capt. J. E. Murphy. "The Ca
nadian cruiser appeared suddenly
about 2 p.m. yesterday off our star
board bow and flashed signal lights
to halt. We halted.
"Two long-boats put out from the
grey-painted Prince Robert. A lad
der was dropped and five men,
armed with revolvers, came aboard
and stood guard while the officers
inspected the passenger list," said
Jack Davies, of Oakland, Cal.
"They found three Germans right
away, and the fourth, after a short
search, under the captain's bridge.
"The passengers crowded to the
rail and joked with the sailors in
the boats below. They tossed down
cartons of cigarettes."
