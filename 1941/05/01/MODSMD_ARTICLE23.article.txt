WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP).
President Roosevelt and two Cabi

tonight to buy a financial stake in
the struggle to preserve democracy
â€”by acquiring defense savings bonds
and stamps which go on sale tomor

As a "symbol of the determination
of all the people to save and sacri
fice in defense of democracy," the
President bought the first bond and
stamp issues.
The President, Secretary of the
Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr., and
Postmaster General Frank C. Walker
participated in a joint radio appeal
to the country.
