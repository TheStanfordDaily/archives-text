# 'Clancy' Rides Again Sunday
## 
### 
With another thriller of the moun
tain wilds—where men are men and
Women are women —looming ahead
of them next Sunday, the 500 will
ride once more to the Education
Auditorium to see the second dar
ing episode of "Clancy of the
Mounted." "The Clutching Hand"
will not be shown.
Main feature of the evening will
lie full-length showing of "The Scar
let Pimpernel," and will be accom
panied by a cartoon, "Willie the
Whopper in Hassling Round."
This latter was procured for the
intelligentsia after prolonged nego
tiations by Annie Townsend, A.S.S.U.
vice-president, whose "baby" is the
recently re-established Sunday night
movie tradition. She points out that
the fans will be turned on for ade
quate ventilation.
Admission is 1,5 cents per person,
with starting time 7:15, doors open
;;t (>:3O.
