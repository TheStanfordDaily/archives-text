# Turner Explains 'U.S. at War In Three Months' Statements
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the third in a series of articles by Bill Turner,
recently returned from Washington and a conference with President
President.)

Since I returned to the Farm a week ago Sunday, two questions have
confronted me whenever a serious discussion arises. "Why did you write
The Daily that the United States will be involved in warfare inside of

three months?" I am asked, "What
is the typical attitude in the East
toward helping the British?"
In a letter to The Daily, I did
assert that war was imminent and
that our country would be entangled
in some kind of shooting within
three months. As sad an outlook as
this is, there is a great possibility
that it will happen. Of course, ev
erything is peaceful and quiet on
the Stanford Farm and it's hard to
imagine that first shot which will
be the spark of war. In Washington,
however, things are contrastingly
tense, and are becoming more so
each day. We have but to scan the
daily newsheet to see the ever-in
creasing exictement in government
circles about our involvement.
VISITS EMBASSY
It was on a visit to the British
Embassy in the nation's capitol that
I was first impressed by the tense
position of the United States in
world affairs. There we met, among
others, Lord and Lady Halifax, Sec
retary of War Stimson, Senator
George of the Senate Military Af
fairs Committee, and many former
Polish dignitaries. After the shock
of meeting so many world figures
had died down, Ward Fouts, stu
dent body president of Texas Uni
versity, and I mustered up some
"Western" nerve and approached
Mr. Stimson with some serious
questions. The secretary of war, we
found, was a man who knows ex
actly where he stands in respect to
our helping the British cause. He
implied that he had the "Informa
tion" that it would not bo long be- I
fore the United States would aban- |
don its status as a mere relief-giver j
and would embark on an active
campagin to help Britain win the
war.
ACTIVE CAMPAIGN
In our discussion the details of
how this active campaign would be
carried were not discussed, but the
remarks made up (o that point were
enough to afford plenty of room for
speculation. This was the word of
our national leader whose job it is
to determine the status of the United
States toward war. This was enough
to form my opinion on the trend of
events to come. I have noticed in
the past week's news that President
Roosevelt has openly agreed with
several public statements made by
Secretary of Navy Knox and Mr.
Stimson concerning their outlook to
make a quick and decisive decision
in our program of help to England.
With a 1000-mile neutrality patrol
already watchfully guarding ship
ments off the Atlantic seaboard and
with a very possible move for out
and-out convoying of British ship
ments, it seems inevitable that one
of our official boats will get in the
way of a Nazi shell or torpedo. The
United States at this point would no
longer be the economic interven
tionist she has been. This would be
undeclared warfare of the type
which has fast become popular since
the "peaceful" invasion of China by
the Japanese. This is why I say
"war in three months."

our national leader whose job it is
to determine the status of the United
States toward war. This was enough
to form my opinion on the trend of
events to come. I have noticed in
the past week's news that President
Roosevelt has openly agreed with
several public statements made by
Secretary of Navy Knox and Mr.
Stimson concerning their outlook to
make a quick and decisive decision
in our program of help to England.
With a 1000-mile neutrality patrol
already watchfully guarding ship
ments off the Atlantic seaboard and
with a very possible move for out
and-out convoying of British ship
ments, it seems inevitable that one
of our official boats will get in the
way of a Nazi shell or torpedo. The
United States at this point would no
longer be the economic interven
tionist she has been. This would be
undeclared warfare of the type
which has fast become popular since
the "peaceful" invasion of China by
the Japanese. This is why I say
"war in three months."

Since I returned to the Farm a week ago Sunday, two questions have
confronted me whenever a serious discussion arises. "Why did you write
The Daily that the United States will be involved in warfare inside of

three months?" I am asked, "What
is the typical attitude in the East
toward helping the British?"
In a letter to The Daily, I did
assert that war was imminent and
that our country would be entangled
in some kind of shooting within
three months. As sad an outlook as
this is, there is a great possibility
that it will happen. Of course, ev
erything is peaceful and quiet on
the Stanford Farm and it's hard to
imagine that first shot which will
be the spark of war. In Washington,
however, things are contrastingly
tense, and are becoming more so
each day. We have but to scan the
daily newsheet to see the ever-in
creasing exictement in government
circles about our involvement.
VISITS EMBASSY
It was on a visit to the British
Embassy in the nation's capitol that
I was first impressed by the tense
position of the United States in
world affairs. There we met, among
others, Lord and Lady Halifax, Sec
retary of War Stimson, Senator
George of the Senate Military Af
fairs Committee, and many former
Polish dignitaries. After the shock
of meeting so many world figures
had died down, Ward Fouts, stu
dent body president of Texas Uni
versity, and I mustered up some
"Western" nerve and approached
Mr. Stimson with some serious
questions. The secretary of war, we
found, was a man who knows ex
actly where he stands in respect to
our helping the British cause. He
implied that he had the "Informa
tion" that it would not bo long be- I
fore the United States would aban- |
don its status as a mere relief-giver j
and would embark on an active
campagin to help Britain win the
war.
ACTIVE CAMPAIGN
In our discussion the details of
how this active campaign would be
carried were not discussed, but the
remarks made up (o that point were
enough to afford plenty of room for
speculation. This was the word of
