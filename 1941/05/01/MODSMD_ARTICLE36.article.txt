# Tracksters Practice For P.A. Tussle
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
Stanford will soiul 21 (rack and
field athletes to the Pacific Associa
tion meet Saturday.
The Indians will be at a decided
disadvantage psychologically for
they will be returning to the scene
of last week's Big Meet, and the
prospect of running at Edwards
Stadium twice in one week is not
a rosy one, especially in view of the
slaughtering they got in their last
outing at Berkeley.
CREY HITS 50
A1 Grey has been showing im
provement since the Big Meet, with
about 10 puts each over 50 feet
Monday. A! hit 50 right on the nose
against U.C.L.A. a couple of weeks
ago and showed the highly overrated
Roger Hoeger a thing or two about
the art of If his wrist
doesn't give him any trouble, A1
could give U.S.C.'s Merritt trouble.
Merritt, teammate of Moose Thomp
son at Modesto last year, has won
everything in the Southland, and
just at present he's about tops on
the Coast.
After light rains had put the
damper on Tuesday's workout, the
Indians got down to work yesterday.
Blair Hyde is working out his bum
leg and will probably be ready to
go this week-end. Francis Olson is
rounding into shape rapidly, after a
week's lay-off. Olie got up for a
second-place tie Saturday, catching
Larsen in the last stretch of the 880.
lIERTEL OUT
Ed Hertel is laid up with sinus
trouble and a sore leg. Ed's un
usually good start in the highs Sat
urday is what threw him off; he's so
used to seeing someone in front of
him on the first couple of flights that
he got flustered, tripped over the
third hurdle, and ran into the fourth.
Meanwhile Hart was going down
and Eikelman was Ihe only Stanford
man left in the field. At that, Eik
almost got up for a place, Ramsaur
winning in the slow time of 15.7.
TROY MEET LOOMS
Stanford has a lot of hard work
to do in tx-ack during the next six
weeks. Coming up is the Trojan
dual meet and the Fresno Relays
and in June, Stanford plays host to
the greatest college track and field
stars in the nation, staging the an
nual N.C.A.A. in the Stadium. The
Indians are in a position to be polite
hosts but Stanford would like to
present a couple of outstanding per
formances while the Farm is in the
national sportlight.
One of the greatest performances
of the year shapes up for Fresno
when the West Coast Relays roll
around. It is the medley relay when
Cal's Klemmer, Barnes, and Peter
take on U.S.C.'s Bourland, Smith,
and Weed. That should be a classic.

about 10 puts each over 50 feet
Monday. A! hit 50 right on the nose
against U.C.L.A. a couple of weeks
ago and showed the highly overrated
Roger Hoeger a thing or two about
the art of If his wrist
doesn't give him any trouble, A1
could give U.S.C.'s Merritt trouble.
Merritt, teammate of Moose Thomp
son at Modesto last year, has won
everything in the Southland, and
just at present he's about tops on
the Coast.
After light rains had put the
damper on Tuesday's workout, the
Indians got down to work yesterday.
Blair Hyde is working out his bum
leg and will probably be ready to
go this week-end. Francis Olson is
rounding into shape rapidly, after a
week's lay-off. Olie got up for a
second-place tie Saturday, catching
Larsen in the last stretch of the 880.
lIERTEL OUT
Ed Hertel is laid up with sinus
trouble and a sore leg. Ed's un
usually good start in the highs Sat
urday is what threw him off; he's so
used to seeing someone in front of
him on the first couple of flights that
he got flustered, tripped over the
third hurdle, and ran into the fourth.
Meanwhile Hart was going down
and Eikelman was Ihe only Stanford
man left in the field. At that, Eik
almost got up for a place, Ramsaur
winning in the slow time of 15.7.
TROY MEET LOOMS
Stanford has a lot of hard work
to do in tx-ack during the next six
weeks. Coming up is the Trojan
dual meet and the Fresno Relays
and in June, Stanford plays host to
the greatest college track and field
stars in the nation, staging the an
nual N.C.A.A. in the Stadium. The
Indians are in a position to be polite
hosts but Stanford would like to
present a couple of outstanding per
formances while the Farm is in the
national sportlight.
One of the greatest performances
of the year shapes up for Fresno
when the West Coast Relays roll
around. It is the medley relay when
Cal's Klemmer, Barnes, and Peter
take on U.S.C.'s Bourland, Smith,
and Weed. That should be a classic.
Stanford will soiul 21 (rack and
field athletes to the Pacific Associa
tion meet Saturday.
The Indians will be at a decided
disadvantage psychologically for
they will be returning to the scene
of last week's Big Meet, and the
prospect of running at Edwards
Stadium twice in one week is not
a rosy one, especially in view of the
slaughtering they got in their last
outing at Berkeley.
