# Kappa Sig Nine Takes Chi Psi
## 
### 
Forfeits and landslide scores fea
tured yesterday's intramural play as
the Beta softballers scalped El Capi
tan, 25 to 10, and the Kappa Sig
hardball team topped Chi Psi, 18 to
13.
Although the score was tied at
4-all in the first inning, the Betas,
behind the pitching of Tom Robert
son, went ahead in the second and
were never threatened. Ed Robin
son and Bob Laverty hit home runs.
With the Kappa Sigs leading 15 to
0 in the first part of the fourth, Chi
Psi attempted a comeback with 9
runs in the frame, but the Kappa
Sig battery of Frank Wells and Jim
Verdieck limited them effectively
the rest of the contest. Al Chapman
relieved Wells in the final inning.
Bill Miller and Wells both circuit
clouted earlier in the game.
Double forfeits were recorded in
the Delt-Encina 1E and Theta Chi -
Business School contests.
