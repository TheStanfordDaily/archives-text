### CHUCK SMITH 
Stanford's hapless base
ball team finished fifth in the
six-team California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association with an unim
pressive record of 4 wins and 10 de
feats, they were outhit by their op
ponents by only the small margin
of 7 hits.
The Cards in their 14 conference
games connected for 121 hits, while
their opponents got 128. This gives
them an avei'age of 9 hits per game,
which normally would be enough to
win a majority of ball games.
But in the run department, the
Indians were outclassed 84 to 60.
On the average, it took Stanford 2
hits to score a run while their op
ponents managed to cross the plate
once for each IV2 hits.
This shows clearly enough the
glaring Weaknesses of the Stan
ford nine-errdr on defense and
sloppy base running.

'JpHAT LAST Cal game was a typ
ical example of the Cards' in
ability to capitalize on the natural
hitting power they possessed and
their bad habit of blowing up on
their infielding when the pressure
was on.
Why, in the first four innings
Wolter's team had 10 hits and only
one run; nine men had died on base
in these four frames. But, as a
direct contrast, the Bears in their
big seventh inning got the fat total
of 4 runs on only two bona fide hits
mainly through the help of an erring
Card infield.
In my opinion, you can take jt or
leave it, this year's'baseball team
never realized its potentialities.
Some days they would be red hot in
their fielding; for instance, the third
U.C.L.A. game on the home diamond
when they materialized four double
plays in five innings.
Then other days they could hit
at will just as they did against
Cal's Mike Koll last Tuesday, and
any team that can connect against
the talented Koll is a hitting ball
club.
Cootie Thompson and the rest of
the pitching staff. Claude Purkitt,
Huss Smith, and Phil Wolf pitched
not spectacular but steady ball.
And yet with all the necessary
requisites of a winning ball club,
the Indians were never able to ap
proach top form in all departments,
never quite thought they were sup
posed to win their ball games. The
net results—4 wins, 10 losses.

crafty, mild-man
k nered basketball coach, Everett
Dean, received a bit of good news
the other day. It concerned the re
sults of Don Burness' physical ex
amination at the hands of a bunch
of doctors who had some idea of

making a soldier out of Don.
For the big All-Coast center was
deferred by draft hoard doctors to
Class IB because of the tricky
knee which kept him out of bas
ketball a year ago and which was
the prize worry of Dean through
out the last season.
Fordy Anderson, another return
ing member of the all-All-Coast
Stanford team who was also in dan
ger of being drafted seems to be safe
now and so Mr. Dean feels more at
ease and on more friendly terms
with Uncle Sam's Army. However,
the air corps did succeed in getting
lofty Bob Penn, who did have an
other year of eligibility.
of basketball, I see
k where the immortal Hank Lui
setti has NOT decided to quit bas
ketball but has accepted an offer to
perform for the Phillip's Oilers of
Oklahoma despite frantic offers by
home town San Francisco organi
zations to keep Hank performing in
and around the bay area.
This means that the loyalty of
thousands of San Francisco's basket
ball fans will probably shift from
Olympic Club, the team of their
erstwhile favorite son, Hankus
Pankus, to Stanford which will next
year boast the presence of local
boys Don Burness, Bill Cowden, and
Freddie Linari.

'JpHAT LAST Cal game was a typ
ical example of the Cards' in
ability to capitalize on the natural
hitting power they possessed and
their bad habit of blowing up on
their infielding when the pressure
was on.
Why, in the first four innings
Wolter's team had 10 hits and only
one run; nine men had died on base
in these four frames. But, as a
direct contrast, the Bears in their
big seventh inning got the fat total
of 4 runs on only two bona fide hits
mainly through the help of an erring
Card infield.
In my opinion, you can take jt or
leave it, this year's'baseball team
never realized its potentialities.
Some days they would be red hot in
their fielding; for instance, the third
U.C.L.A. game on the home diamond
when they materialized four double
plays in five innings.
Then other days they could hit
at will just as they did against
Cal's Mike Koll last Tuesday, and
any team that can connect against
the talented Koll is a hitting ball
club.
Cootie Thompson and the rest of
the pitching staff. Claude Purkitt,
Huss Smith, and Phil Wolf pitched
not spectacular but steady ball.
And yet with all the necessary
requisites of a winning ball club,
the Indians were never able to ap
proach top form in all departments,
never quite thought they were sup
posed to win their ball games. The
net results—4 wins, 10 losses.

k nered basketball coach, Everett

making a soldier out of Don.
For the big All-Coast center was
deferred by draft hoard doctors to
Class IB because of the tricky
knee which kept him out of bas
ketball a year ago and which was
the prize worry of Dean through
out the last season.
Fordy Anderson, another return

Stanford team who was also in dan
ger of being drafted seems to be safe

ketball but has accepted an offer to
perform for the Phillip's Oilers of
Oklahoma despite frantic offers by
home town San Francisco organi

and around the bay area.
This means that the loyalty of
thousands of San Francisco's basket
ball fans will probably shift from
Olympic Club, the team of their

Pankus, to Stanford which will next

mainly through the help of an erring
Card infield.
In my opinion, you can take jt or
leave it, this year's'baseball team
never realized its potentialities.
Some days they would be red hot in
their fielding; for instance, the third
U.C.L.A. game on the home diamond
when they materialized four double
plays in five innings.
Then other days they could hit
at will just as they did against
Cal's Mike Koll last Tuesday, and
any team that can connect against
the talented Koll is a hitting ball
club.
Cootie Thompson and the rest of
the pitching staff. Claude Purkitt,
Huss Smith, and Phil Wolf pitched
not spectacular but steady ball.
And yet with all the necessary
requisites of a winning ball club,
the Indians were never able to ap
proach top form in all departments,
never quite thought they were sup
posed to win their ball games. The
net results—4 wins, 10 losses.

crafty, mild-man
k nered basketball coach, Everett
Dean, received a bit of good news
the other day. It concerned the re
sults of Don Burness' physical ex
amination at the hands of a bunch
of doctors who had some idea of

making a soldier out of Don.
For the big All-Coast center was
deferred by draft hoard doctors to
Class IB because of the tricky
knee which kept him out of bas
ketball a year ago and which was
the prize worry of Dean through
out the last season.
Fordy Anderson, another return
ing member of the all-All-Coast
Stanford team who was also in dan
ger of being drafted seems to be safe
now and so Mr. Dean feels more at
ease and on more friendly terms
with Uncle Sam's Army. However,
the air corps did succeed in getting
lofty Bob Penn, who did have an
other year of eligibility.
of basketball, I see
k where the immortal Hank Lui
setti has NOT decided to quit bas
ketball but has accepted an offer to
perform for the Phillip's Oilers of
Oklahoma despite frantic offers by
home town San Francisco organi
zations to keep Hank performing in
and around the bay area.
This means that the loyalty of
thousands of San Francisco's basket
ball fans will probably shift from
Olympic Club, the team of their
erstwhile favorite son, Hankus
Pankus, to Stanford which will next
year boast the presence of local
boys Don Burness, Bill Cowden, and
Freddie Linari.
Stanford's hapless base
ball team finished fifth in the
six-team California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association with an unim
pressive record of 4 wins and 10 de
feats, they were outhit by their op
ponents by only the small margin
of 7 hits.
The Cards in their 14 conference
games connected for 121 hits, while
their opponents got 128. This gives
them an avei'age of 9 hits per game,
which normally would be enough to
win a majority of ball games.
But in the run department, the
Indians were outclassed 84 to 60.
On the average, it took Stanford 2
hits to score a run while their op
ponents managed to cross the plate
once for each IV2 hits.
This shows clearly enough the
glaring Weaknesses of the Stan
ford nine-errdr on defense and
sloppy base running.

'JpHAT LAST Cal game was a typ
ical example of the Cards' in
ability to capitalize on the natural
hitting power they possessed and
their bad habit of blowing up on
their infielding when the pressure
was on.
Why, in the first four innings
Wolter's team had 10 hits and only
one run; nine men had died on base
in these four frames. But, as a
direct contrast, the Bears in their
big seventh inning got the fat total
of 4 runs on only two bona fide hits
mainly through the help of an erring
Card infield.
