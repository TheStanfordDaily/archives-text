SAN FRANCISCO, April 30 (UP).
—A hundred thousand fishermen—
more or less—will start whipping
California's trout streams at dawn
tomorrow. Conditions were reported
good, particularly in smaller streams
which are high but clear. Warm
weather in the next few weeks is
expected to melt snows in the higher
mountains and spoil fishing in those
streams.
