# Gridmen Continue to Prep For Scheduled Scrimmage
## 
### DON SELBY 
It's i«n industrious group that is
wciking out behind locked gates on
the varsity practice fielil these days.
And anyone who thinks that all the
industry is being supplied by only
the players has another think com
ing, for that black-and-gray-clad
torching stalT works — and works
hard.
Yesterday was given over to more
work to toughen the squad for the
scrimmages that are scheduled for
either the latter part of this week or
the first part of next week, depend
ing upon the amount of work that
is accomplished in the meantime.
LOT TO LEARN
It was the same routine, yet it
was different, for the squad seems
to improve right before your eyes,
especially the new men who are just
grasping the intricacies of the "T"
formation as taught by Clark
Shaughnessy. There's a lot to learn
as even the regulars realize, be
cause the way Coach Shaughnessy
teaches football it's an ever-chang
ing game.
A chalk talk was first on the day's
schedule, followed by a lot of work
on blocking, tackling—both live and
dummy-passing—and pass receiving.
Then, while the linemen were still
practicing blocks, the backs started
work on plays, learning assignments,
footwork, fakes, and all that goes
with it.
DUMMY SCRIMMAGE
Winding up the day's routine,
Coach Shaughnessy sent his outfit
through a dummy scrimmage as the
squad was divided into veterans and
new men. Absent were Pete Kmeto
vic and A1 Cole, left halfbacks, and
Art Meiners, end. Injuries, how
ever, were not held accountable for

their absence.
Chuck Taylor and Bruno Ban
ducci, two of the rocks in last year's
nearly impregnable first line of de
lense, refrained from contact work
because of sore shoulders.
Working as one unit in the dummy
scrimmage were: ends, Norberg and
Myers; tackles, Banducci, and
Stamm; guards, Taylor and Francis;
center, Lindskog; quarterback, Al
bert; halfbacks, Barclay and Arm
strong; and fullback, Vucinich. The
other team was made up of Mastin
and Laverty at ends, Mannon and
Johannessen at tackles, Robesky and
Patterson at guards, Stahle at center,
Ravetto at quarterback, Ditlevsen
and Morrison at halves, and Crane at
fullback.
DITLEVSEN SHIFTED
Because of his driving style of
running, Bob Ditlevsen has been
shifted from end, where he played
on last year's outfit, to right half
back. And from the way he handles
himself in the work the team is do
ing now, he should make a much
better than average back. There
isn't any way to explain it other
than to say he just looks like a baek
field man should look.
Ditlevsen, Eric Armstrong, and
Buck Fawcett are all being worked
at the right half spot left vacant by
the graduation of the great Hugh
Gallarneau. And, according to
Backfield Coach Marchie Schwartz,
Gallarneau's shoes are a big pair to
fill.
