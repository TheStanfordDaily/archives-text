TUESDAY the Mothers' Club played host for
an afternoon which no student here finds
merely "one more tea party": for the jubilee,
with its memory book atmosphere, was as thor
ough a demonstration of the true meaning of
"benefit" as many of us will ever know.
For fifty years a group of women who have
children in Stanford have been getting money
from teas and sales and special programs and
turning it over to the students who need it. They
provide tuition, meals, medical care, respite from
worry, and rest for students who would have to
look very hard to find these things elsewhere.
They collect their funds with a minimum of
fuss and with no impositions. They operate with
a sensitive generosity that generous groups
often fail to comprehend, and their seeming lack
of strenuous enterprise adds to the grace with
which they distribute their benefits.
The students at Stanford —whether they are
direct beneficiaries or not—are grateful.—J. C. G.
