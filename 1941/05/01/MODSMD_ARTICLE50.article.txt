TIME and time again, President Roosevelt has
stated, has complained, that Americans do
not fully comprehend the seriousness of the
present international situation.
His is no "wolf, wolf" cry. If anything, his
complaining comes a little too late. For too
long now, the matter of miles—about 3,000 of
them—has controlled the emotions, the opinions,
and the war worries of Americans.
Since colonial times, ours has always been
the belief that the terms "sea" and "seclusion"
were synonymous. Americans are firmly en
trenched in the belief. Perhaps, "tradition"
would be more correct than "belief."
But, being a tradition does not make the fact
intrinsically wholesome. These are not colonial
times. What was good enough for grandpop,
in this instance, is far from being good for us.
Sea does not mean seclusion.
True, it may mean seclusion from the actual,
brutal, and physical invasion of our shores. But
after all, isn't that a rather superficial, history
book look at the situation. We still face the task
of defending our shores from cultural, economic,
religious invasions.
"Oh, well," Americans say, "let's wait and
see."
They aren't worrying much.
At first glance, this appears to be an about
face from the statement made yesterday that
"68 per cent of America (by Gallup poll) is will
ing to enter the war rather than see England
drown under a German wave sweeping in from
the English Channel."
No. Willingness to go to war does not neces
sarily entail a conviction that we WILL go to
war. Perhaps, if more Americans actually be
lieved that the United States would, that per
centage would read 58, or 38, or 8, instead of 68.
But Americans really aren't worrying. They
do not believe that the situation is as serious as
experts say it is.
No more convincing proof of this fact can be
found than the report made this week by John
A. Logan, a member of the Department of Agri
culture Advisory Committee, in which he stated
that "between March, 1940, and March, 1941,
according to Bureau of Labor statistics, food
prices have advanced only 2.9 per cent."
"Food prices," he continued, "will rise in an
emergency."
Food prices have risen only 2.9 per cent. But
before the World War, between December, 1915,
and December, 1916, the B.L.S. food index ad
vanced 19.9 per cent.
They thought there was an emergency in 1915,
and food prices rose rapidly. As yet, America
has seen no appreciable price rise. Apparently
we don't believe there is an emergency.
An army moves on its stomach. Americans
think with their stomachs.—B. A.
