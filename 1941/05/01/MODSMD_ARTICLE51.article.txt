\\ 7V MERICANISM" is a byword again and it
ii has become one of the most terrible epi
thets used by a frightened nation. Ignored as
an attitude when its real meaning is being
quietly observed, in times like these it is com
pressed and applied to ideas and emotions in
the same way a committee approves or refuses
to approve a commodity.
As an intangible, "Americanism" belongs to
everyone; as a tangible, exploitable thing it

belongs to those who most readily find it a
weapon. And as a weapon it brings distress and
confusion—and there is, for those against whom
it is used, absolutely no defense.
Classes employ it against each other; so do
individuals, even persons to whom its misuse
would normally seem terrifying. Foreign editors
are applying it to the actions of citizens inside
our own boundaries, clever enough to appre
ciate the results of our fierce self-examinations.
Anyone, now, can catch "Americanism" and
hurl it back as an indictment, or can bestow it
as an accolade, or employ it as a camouflage.
What has been the most thoroughly good
thing in our political ethic has been turned into
an instrument which we cannot control, and
which is the truest basis for fear.—J. C. G.
