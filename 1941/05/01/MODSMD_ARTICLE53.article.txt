# DID YOU FEEL THE DRAFT?

### Bud Ames 
YESTERDAY the government played a nifty lottery
game in which every one of the lucky, lucky con
testants got a prize. "Hey, hey step up gents, and take
your pick. There's a winner every time. You can't
lose."
Only the government could work out this glorified
"shell game" in such a way that every one of the
16,400,000 contestants was a winner. A sandwich in
every capsule.
Probably most of you missed the frolic at the big
drawing yesterday morning because you were in 9
o'clock classes. So for your belated information—the
whole thing started off with a mushy-voiced announcer
breathing reverently into a microphone all about how
Henry L Stimson, secretary of war, was blindfolded
and how he was going to draw the first numbered cap
sule out of the beer mug.
"Mr. Stimson is stepping to the bowl. He reaches in,
grasps a capsule, and in a moment you will hear the
first number."
There was a sound of scuffling and the next voice
turned out to be that of President Roosevelt. As nifty
a job of upstaging as you could want. Well, anyway,
Mr. Stimson got to draw the number, didn't he?
* * * *
WJLJAA FREENS . . . the furst seerall nomba is
one-fiva, eight."
Somewhere in the crowd behind Roosevelt a woman
screamed. Just like vaudeville. Immediately she was
strong-armed to the microphone for an interview. It
is still a question whether she was laughing from joy
or whether it was just plain, down-to-earth hysterical
gibbering.
Anyway, it seems that she has a son who helps a
plumbing contractor which makes him as certain of
getting tossed into the army as one Siamese twia is
of the other.
Then in an oily voice which would have made
Simon Legree sound like Roosevelt addressing the
Stanford Republican Club, Secretary of War Stimson
breathed a quote which would chill even a Good
Humor Man.
"I'm sure, Mrs that your boy will spend a
pleasant year in the army. Heh, heh, heh."
You could just see him pulling away at his long
black mustache.

T> UT here is an encouraging note which came out of
yesterday's proceedings. We have it on strictest
authority from a potentate who is the guiding fist on
one of the local draft boards that Stanford students
have very little to fear. He doesn't believe that the
board will do much about dragging you students out
of school even if your number should be called. Which
it probably will.
* * * *
By the way, Jimmy Stewart of "Holly-would-you?"
infamy held the first draft number called, number 158,
and that's no fooling. Doesn't your heart just go pitty
pat? Just think of cleaning out all those army stables
—next to Jimmy Stewart!

16,400,000 contestants was a winner. A sandwich in
every capsule.
Probably most of you missed the frolic at the big
drawing yesterday morning because you were in 9
o'clock classes. So for your belated information—the
whole thing started off with a mushy-voiced announcer
breathing reverently into a microphone all about how
Henry L Stimson, secretary of war, was blindfolded
and how he was going to draw the first numbered cap
sule out of the beer mug.
"Mr. Stimson is stepping to the bowl. He reaches in,
grasps a capsule, and in a moment you will hear the
first number."
There was a sound of scuffling and the next voice
turned out to be that of President Roosevelt. As nifty
a job of upstaging as you could want. Well, anyway,
Mr. Stimson got to draw the number, didn't he?
* * * *
WJLJAA FREENS . . . the furst seerall nomba is
one-fiva, eight."
Somewhere in the crowd behind Roosevelt a woman
screamed. Just like vaudeville. Immediately she was
strong-armed to the microphone for an interview. It
is still a question whether she was laughing from joy
or whether it was just plain, down-to-earth hysterical
gibbering.
Anyway, it seems that she has a son who helps a
plumbing contractor which makes him as certain of
getting tossed into the army as one Siamese twia is
of the other.
Then in an oily voice which would have made
Simon Legree sound like Roosevelt addressing the
Stanford Republican Club, Secretary of War Stimson
breathed a quote which would chill even a Good
Humor Man.
"I'm sure, Mrs that your boy will spend a
pleasant year in the army. Heh, heh, heh."
You could just see him pulling away at his long
black mustache.

T> UT here is an encouraging note which came out of
yesterday's proceedings. We have it on strictest
authority from a potentate who is the guiding fist on
one of the local draft boards that Stanford students
have very little to fear. He doesn't believe that the
board will do much about dragging you students out
of school even if your number should be called. Which
it probably will.

By the way, Jimmy Stewart of "Holly-would-you?"
infamy held the first draft number called, number 158,
and that's no fooling. Doesn't your heart just go pitty
pat? Just think of cleaning out all those army stables
—next to Jimmy Stewart!
YESTERDAY the government played a nifty lottery
game in which every one of the lucky, lucky con
testants got a prize. "Hey, hey step up gents, and take
your pick. There's a winner every time. You can't
lose."
Only the government could work out this glorified
"shell game" in such a way that every one of the
16,400,000 contestants was a winner. A sandwich in
every capsule.
