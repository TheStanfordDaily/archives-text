## AGAIN—AMERICANISM 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I am addressing this letter to you, and to all per
sons who take a like attitude concerning traitors to
America in this great crisis.
Like many other Americans I used—mark the past
tense—to admire Charles Lindbergh. But I think
that in the past few years he has forfeited all right to
be considered a hero, or even a decent citizen. In
spite of his leaving the country of his birth—your
phrase, I believe—to live in England after all that the
United States had done for him, I reserved, to a de
gree, my judgment.
But when he started talking about how powerful
the Nazis were, how they are sure to win, all with
scarcely disguised admiration, I labeled him for the
kind of person he is. Now, when he is trying to lead
right-thinking citizens astray with his obviously Ger
man-inspired uterances, I believe that he is indulging
in the greatest treachery since the days of Aaron Burr.
We have put up with subversive activity too long.
And there is no reason why, because a man is an ex
hero, the United States should put up with his speeches
in Congressional meetings, or over the air.
Freedom of speech is still a vital institution to
Americans, but there is one American(?), apparently,
who does not deserve this privilege, and his past ac
tions prove it.
Angry
