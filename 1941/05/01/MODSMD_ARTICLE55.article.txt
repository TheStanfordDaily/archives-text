# NO. NO. THANK YOU...

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
It was with mingled feelings of triumph and
thankfulness that I read the so nice comments of
debaters Moses and Newell about Stanford women.
We do appreciate the compliment. Many thanks.
You can realize it was somewhat of a shock to
come to Stanford all primed for a big time with a
ratio of three men to one woman only to have people
say sneeringly, "Nine out of ten girls are popular, the
tenth one goes to Stanford"; while off campus I have
been constantly met with slurs about Stanford women
such as, "Oh. do you have dates at all? I've always
heard that Stanford men ALWAYS date Mills girls,'
or "I've heard that Stanford women are perfect frights
because of the high scholastic barriers . They need a
wooden leg and gray hair to get into that place."
So, once again I thank the debaters, who ought to
know, since they've been about the country and have
come to the conclusion that Farm women aren't so
bad after all. Maybe all of the Roughs should tour
the country to get the right idea. Moses' and Newell's
compliments on top of reports from beauty experts
who say that American women are the most beau
tiful seem to give Stanford women top ranking.
Thankful Few
