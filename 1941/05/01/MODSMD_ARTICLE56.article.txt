# Rules Released For Sing Fest
## Provisional Song List Announced by Howard 
### 
Rules for contestants in the All-
University Singfest which will take
place in the Lawrence Frost Amphi
theater, May 7, at 8 o'clock, were
announced last night by Tom How
ard, chairman.
Groups may sing only one chorus
of their song, or one verse and one
chorus. No medleys will be permit
ted, and specialty acts such as patter
between stanzas is forbidden. Straight
barbershop harmony is sought.
All groups are asked to practice
the words and music of the Stanford
Hymn as the Songfest will end with
that number. Groups need not prac
tice any harmony to the anthem, just
words and music are all that is nec
essary. Groups are asked to report
at the Amphitheater at 7:30 o'clock.
CARILLON TO PLAY
As a specialty of the evening, the
carillon will play, and efforts are be
fng made to have it play the Hymn
as an accompaniment for the singers.
