"I like to relax when I go to the
movies" is the attitude that most
people take when they pick their
movies, and it's a bad one, according
to Mrs. Howard Ray, who spoke to
the Luncheon Club yesterday noon
in the Nitery. College students,
however, choose their movies better
than their elders, she said.
Hitler has used the moving pic
tures to educate his army and civil
ians, and with good results. In
America, since there is no one man
who regulates this tremendous edu
cational force it is important that
the people who take Hitler's place
be able to choose their movies in
telligently.
