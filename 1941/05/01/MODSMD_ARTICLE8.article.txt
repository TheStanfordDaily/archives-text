# Anderson Sits As President
## 
### 
"Oh, what a lot of fun—l'm the
student body president!"
None other than the A.T.O.'s in
imitable Ross Anderson sits in the
executive swivel chair, whirling
himself in little circles, dangling his
legs in space.
For the first time in the Farm's
history the A.S.S.U. president, vice
president and president-elect are
absent from duties on campus this
week. And Anderson is the man
with the gavel, being next in line—
member-at-large of Ex Committee.
Suddenly realizing the seriousness
of his responsibility, the chief pro
tem yesterday issued an edict, an
ultimatum:
"In the interest of the students,
Excom has passed a regulation out
lawing firearms on the campus, un
less properly registered with the
Dean of Men's office. Any gun not
so regulated will be confiscated."
After this sudden outburst had
blown over, he seriously explained
that after firearm owners register
their guns with the Dean of Men's
office, they must keep them in the
R.O.T.C. gun lockers when not in
use.
Bruce Jessup and George Jackson,
A.S.S.U. president and president
elect, are attending a Pacific Student
Body Presidents' Association con
vention at Catalina this week, and
Anne Townsend, vice-president, is
also in the Southland.
