### Jean Nowell 
WHEN Robert Clive gave India to
his king during the last quarter
of the 18th century, he opened the
doorway to British Imperialism in
the East. Since that time the Eng
lish have developed a system of co
lonial rule which combines a neat
combination of "white man's bur
den" and hard-headed realism, par
ticularly in their dealings with the
non-white races under their rule
either directly or by protectorate.
All the lessons learned during
their 150 years of government and
soldiering in Asia will have to
come into play during the next
few days in Iraq. During peace
time the English recognize the
government of this protectorate,
hold three airdromes an*d keep a
few light garrisons there to guard
the Mosul oil pipe line which cuts
across the desert from Iraq through
Trans-Jordan and ends up at
Haifa in Palestine. The last two
countries are British mandates.
Since the pro-Nazi coup d'etat in
Iraq, the situation there has been be
coming more and more critical. The
first British reinforcements arrived
a few weeks ago (probably under
the terms of the treaty England can
send in troops when the country is
"threatened") and a second detach
ment has arrived within the last
couple of days.
* * *
HPHE turbulent Arabs have always
been ripe for trouble-making,
and it's safe to bet that Hitler and
Mussolini have supplied the agents
to foment the trouble. Now it is re
ported from Budapest (as unreliable
a news source as there is in Europe,
because it is chiefly a rumor cen
ter) that the Bagdad government
has served some sort of ultimatum
on the British demanding that the
Empire forces be withdrawn.
More concrete evidence of the
trouble is evinced in the report Iraq
troops have taken up positions close
to the British air base at Habbani
yah in order t<3 enforce the order.
Once shooting starts there, the Brit
ish are going to have another war
on their hands, suppressing the in
surrection.
While Mosul oil is vital to the
British Mediterranean fleet, it is
not going to he much good to the
Nazis unless they can knock out
that fleet; getting the oil from
Haifa up to Germany is no minor
transportation problem with Cun
ningham in the vicinity. What
Hitler appears to want is a general
flare-up all over the Near-Eastern
Empire in order to make his ad
vance on Suez through Syria and
Palestine easier.
It's also pretty evident that Eng
land is not going to let any minor
treaty or diplomatic points keep her
out of Iraq. Strong forces there will
bolster Turkey in her stand against
Hitler, since troops can come into
Turkey that way in the event the
Nazis get control of the Aegean. And
a strong force at Syria's back door
will also constitute a definite threat.

'T'HIS shake-up in the British
Cabinet indicates, in all proba
bility, three things. First, supply and
production in England's war effort
must not have been doing too well.
Beaverbrook is extremely unpopu
lar ,and a terrific martinet, but he
had managed to do remarkably well
with aircraft production. In his new
over-all position he can keep an eye
on all production effort and perhaps
work the same miracles.
Then, the fact that the reorgani
zation came just before open de
hate on the war in the House of
Commons. During this debate
Churchill, Eden and the rest will
he grilled unmercifully by the
members. This consolidated Cabi
net will forestall a good many
criticisms. And finally, this put
ting the good men in the top spots
will make an excellent impres
sion on America.
Over in Moscow the Red Army
paraded through the Red Square in
all its tanks and glory, as United
Press released a report (probably
smuggled out by one of its corre
spondents since it had no byline)
that tremendous German forces
were being concentrated on Russia's
borders.

Over in Moscow the Red Army
paraded through the Red Square in
all its tanks and glory, as United
Press released a report (probably
smuggled out by one of its corre
spondents since it had no byline)
that tremendous German forces
were being concentrated on Russia's
borders.
WHEN Robert Clive gave India to
his king during the last quarter
of the 18th century, he opened the
doorway to British Imperialism in
the East. Since that time the Eng
lish have developed a system of co
lonial rule which combines a neat
combination of "white man's bur
den" and hard-headed realism, par
ticularly in their dealings with the
non-white races under their rule
either directly or by protectorate.
All the lessons learned during
their 150 years of government and
soldiering in Asia will have to
come into play during the next
few days in Iraq. During peace
time the English recognize the
government of this protectorate,
hold three airdromes an*d keep a
few light garrisons there to guard
the Mosul oil pipe line which cuts
across the desert from Iraq through
Trans-Jordan and ends up at
Haifa in Palestine. The last two
countries are British mandates.
Since the pro-Nazi coup d'etat in
Iraq, the situation there has been be
coming more and more critical. The
first British reinforcements arrived
a few weeks ago (probably under
the terms of the treaty England can
send in troops when the country is
"threatened") and a second detach
ment has arrived within the last
couple of days.

HPHE turbulent Arabs have always
been ripe for trouble-making,
and it's safe to bet that Hitler and
Mussolini have supplied the agents
to foment the trouble. Now it is re
ported from Budapest (as unreliable
a news source as there is in Europe,
because it is chiefly a rumor cen
ter) that the Bagdad government
has served some sort of ultimatum
on the British demanding that the
Empire forces be withdrawn.
More concrete evidence of the
trouble is evinced in the report Iraq
troops have taken up positions close
to the British air base at Habbani
yah in order t<3 enforce the order.
Once shooting starts there, the Brit
ish are going to have another war
on their hands, suppressing the in
surrection.
While Mosul oil is vital to the
British Mediterranean fleet, it is
not going to he much good to the
Nazis unless they can knock out
that fleet; getting the oil from
Haifa up to Germany is no minor
transportation problem with Cun
ningham in the vicinity. What
Hitler appears to want is a general
flare-up all over the Near-Eastern
Empire in order to make his ad
vance on Suez through Syria and
Palestine easier.
It's also pretty evident that Eng
land is not going to let any minor
treaty or diplomatic points keep her
out of Iraq. Strong forces there will
bolster Turkey in her stand against
Hitler, since troops can come into
Turkey that way in the event the
Nazis get control of the Aegean. And
a strong force at Syria's back door
will also constitute a definite threat.

'T'HIS shake-up in the British
Cabinet indicates, in all proba
bility, three things. First, supply and
production in England's war effort
must not have been doing too well.
Beaverbrook is extremely unpopu
lar ,and a terrific martinet, but he
had managed to do remarkably well
with aircraft production. In his new
over-all position he can keep an eye
on all production effort and perhaps
work the same miracles.
Then, the fact that the reorgani
zation came just before open de
hate on the war in the House of
Commons. During this debate
Churchill, Eden and the rest will
he grilled unmercifully by the
members. This consolidated Cabi
net will forestall a good many
criticisms. And finally, this put
ting the good men in the top spots
will make an excellent impres
sion on America.
