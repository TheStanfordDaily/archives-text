# Drive Tops '40 Mark by $600
## 
### 
With final results unavailable
until June, a preliminary count of
the money received in this year's
Convalescent Home Drive reveals
that the Farm topped the 1940 mark
by $600. Graham Barbey, drive
chairman, announced last night that
approximately $5000 had been turned
in to the Home's coffers.
One of the new additions to the
drive, the King-Queen contest, as
sured itself a place in next year's
campaign by more than doubling
on-campus contributions with an es
timated $1763. Winners were the
Oaks, who placed their little boy on
the throne with a $3.19 per capita
contribution, and the Phi Sigma
Kappas, who crowned the Queen
with $3.34 per person.
A $10 money order at L'Omelette
went to Betty Blystone and Ed Por
ter, winners of the off-campus con
test, who brought in $200. Second
place and two dinners at Dinah's
were awarded to Sue Bivens and
Jim McKellar. Total in this portion
of the drive slumped, with $1300
contributed, as compared with
l!)40's $1680.
Due to the fact that the Back to
the Farm Dance, another new addi
tion, was not as much of a success
as expected, making only $300, plans
are under consideration for moving
Back to the Farm Day and the
dance to winter quarter.
The money turned in will still go
to the Convalescent Home under the
new plan.
The Farm got off more dimes and
gave them to more kiddies on this
year's Tag Day than last, giving
$250, $90 over the '40 total.
