# FARM 'SALTS' TRADE SAILING YARNS
## Club Beats Berkeley In Year's First Race 
### AL HAMPSON 
Stanford's "arm-chair admirals"
are at it again.
Stanford has a sailing club, and as
always when more than one sailor
get together they "bull." Stanford
has its real sailors—and the sailors
who talk a good race.
But for all their talking and re
hashing of old races, the sailors un
der Bob Allen, commodore of the
Intercollegiate Racing Association,
are really doing things. They beat
California in an Olympic Monotype
team race, 207-167, and have now
laid plans for an intercollegc race
to take place May 17.
HAD CLUB IN '38
In the past, 1938 to be exact, Stan
ford had a sailing club under Don
Douglas which raced and beat Cal.
In 1939 Stanford had no team so Cal
had to race itself for the big per
petual trophy; last year they beat us.
Stanford took the trophy away from
them April 19 and it is now on dis
play in the showcase in the Union.
Bob Allan is trying to form a
i yacht club like the sailing club of
the past. He said this club has three
! objects. One to race California each
year for the perpetual trophy; two,
! to have fun racing among itself, es-

pecially an all-University champion
ship race; three, to have its members
listed in San Francisco so they may
crew on the larger racing boats.
Although there are plenty of good
skippers at Stanford, there are nd
boats. Plans have been laid to rem
edy this situation. A "Balboa dink"
has been shipped up from the South
for inspection. The little B'/2-foot
boat costs only $75 complete with
sails and hardware and can be built
for $10 without the sails or hard
ware. The Dyer Dingy has also been
considered as a possible boat be
cause three students have these
bodts. However, since Cal is in co
operation with this plan to get the
boats it is doubtful if the "Dyers"
will be chosen, because they are
more expensive, since they are 12
feet long.
These little boats can be sailed in
Lake Lagunita when the water is
high and because of the ease with
which they can be moved they may
be sailed on any part of the bay.
Harvard, Cale, M.1.T., and Navy
have all expressed a desire to Bob
Allan that Stanford enler some sail
ors in the National Intercollegiate
Championship races. "Although we
are greatly flattered, as yet we are
not sufficiently well organized to do
anything about it," Bob commented.
May 17 was chosen as the date for
the all-University yacht race at a
meeting which was held in the Nit
ery Tuesday night. It will be run
over the same course as was used
against Cal, but only one person to a
boat instead of two.

Stanford's "arm-chair admirals"

Stanford has a sailing club, and as
always when more than one sailor
get together they "bull." Stanford
has its real sailors—and the sailors
who talk a good race.
But for all their talking and re
hashing of old races, the sailors un
der Bob Allen, commodore of the
Intercollegiate Racing Association,
are really doing things. They beat
California in an Olympic Monotype
team race, 207-167, and have now
laid plans for an intercollegc race
to take place May 17.
HAD CLUB IN '38
In the past, 1938 to be exact, Stan
ford had a sailing club under Don
Douglas which raced and beat Cal.
In 1939 Stanford had no team so Cal
had to race itself for the big per
petual trophy; last year they beat us.
Stanford took the trophy away from
them April 19 and it is now on dis
play in the showcase in the Union.

Although there are plenty of good
skippers at Stanford, there are nd
boats. Plans have been laid to rem
edy this situation. A "Balboa dink"
has been shipped up from the South
for inspection. The little B'/2-foot
boat costs only $75 complete with
sails and hardware and can be built
for $10 without the sails or hard
ware. The Dyer Dingy has also been
considered as a possible boat be
cause three students have these
bodts. However, since Cal is in co
operation with this plan to get the
boats it is doubtful if the "Dyers"
will be chosen, because they are
more expensive, since they are 12
feet long.
These little boats can be sailed in
Lake Lagunita when the water is

which they can be moved they may
be sailed on any part of the bay.
