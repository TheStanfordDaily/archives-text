# FARM 'SALTS' TRADE SAILING YARNS
## Club Beats Berkeley In Year's First Race 
### AL HAMPSON 
Stanford's "arm-chair admirals"
are at it again.
Stanford has a sailing club, and as
always when more than one sailor
get together they "bull." Stanford
has its real sailors—and the sailors
who talk a good race.
But for all their talking and re
hashing of old races, the sailors un
der Bob Allen, commodore of the
Intercollegiate Racing Association,
are really doing things. They beat
California in an Olympic Monotype
team race, 207-167, and have now
laid plans for an intercollegc race
to take place May 17.
HAD CLUB IN '38
In the past, 1938 to be exact, Stan
ford had a sailing club under Don
Douglas which raced and beat Cal.
In 1939 Stanford had no team so Cal
had to race itself for the big per
petual trophy; last year they beat us.
Stanford took the trophy away from
them April 19 and it is now on dis
play in the showcase in the Union.
Bob Allan is trying to form a
i yacht club like the sailing club of
the past. He said this club has three
! objects. One to race California each
year for the perpetual trophy; two,
! to have fun racing among itself, es-
