# Churchill Shuffles Posts In War Cabinet; Convoy Issue Explodes in Senate
## Fifty Tankers Made Available For Allies' Use 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 1 (UP). —
One phase of President Roosevelt's
prcgram to supply 2,000,000 tons of
shipping aid for Britain was trans
lated into action today. American
shippers and maritime commission
officials tentatively agreed to make
50 oil tankers available for the
"service of Britain."
Secretary of Commerce Jesse
Jones advised Mr. Roosevelt a "sub
stantial number of commercial and
privately-owned transport planes
would be delivered to the govern
ment within three days" for defense
purposes.
These tangible developments in
the program of all-out aid to Brit
ain came as the controversial con
voy issue exploded on the Senate
floor with renewed fury.
WANTS CONVOYS
Sen. Joseph F. Guffey, D., Pa.,
whose infrequent speeches some
times have foreshadowed a new
legislative move by the Administra
tion, called for immediate U. S. con
voying of merchant ships to Britain
because of the "peril that confronts
us."
His views were challenged by Sen.
Charles W. Tobey, R., N.H., anti
convoy leader who revealed he
would force a showdown on the is
sue, probably next week.
Sen. Tobey said he would offer his
no-convoy resolution—squelched by
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee yesterday—as an amendment
to the Administration's bill for
requisitioning foreign ships when
that measure comes to the floor. He
will demand a roll-call vote on the
amendment, a maneuver designed to
force senators to place themselves on
the record against convoys
TANKERS AVAILABLE
Maritime ofliicals and American
owners of virtually all U. S. tankers
afloat worked out a tentative plan
under which at least 25 tankers will
be made available within "the next
few days" and the remainder, if pos
sible, within 30 days.
The general plan calls for a sort of
"shuttle" system under which the
tankers—flying the American flag
and manned by American crews —
will haul oil from South America to
U. S. Atlantic ports where the car
goes will be transferred to British
tankers.
In connection with Mr. Jones' re
port to Mr. Roosevelt, it was learned
commerical lines and some private
owners would turn over 20 to 30
planes to the government for trans
fer to Great Britain.

sue, probably next week.
Sen. Tobey said he would offer his
no-convoy resolution—squelched by
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee yesterday—as an amendment
to the Administration's bill for
requisitioning foreign ships when
that measure comes to the floor. He
will demand a roll-call vote on the
amendment, a maneuver designed to
force senators to place themselves on
the record against convoys
TANKERS AVAILABLE
Maritime ofliicals and American
owners of virtually all U. S. tankers
afloat worked out a tentative plan
under which at least 25 tankers will
be made available within "the next
few days" and the remainder, if pos
sible, within 30 days.
The general plan calls for a sort of
"shuttle" system under which the
tankers—flying the American flag
and manned by American crews —
will haul oil from South America to
U. S. Atlantic ports where the car
goes will be transferred to British
tankers.
In connection with Mr. Jones' re
port to Mr. Roosevelt, it was learned
commerical lines and some private
owners would turn over 20 to 30
planes to the government for trans
fer to Great Britain.
WASHINGTON, May 1 (UP). —
One phase of President Roosevelt's
prcgram to supply 2,000,000 tons of
shipping aid for Britain was trans
lated into action today. American
shippers and maritime commission
officials tentatively agreed to make
50 oil tankers available for the
"service of Britain."
Secretary of Commerce Jesse
Jones advised Mr. Roosevelt a "sub
stantial number of commercial and
privately-owned transport planes
would be delivered to the govern
ment within three days" for defense
purposes.
These tangible developments in
the program of all-out aid to Brit
ain came as the controversial con
voy issue exploded on the Senate
floor with renewed fury.
WANTS CONVOYS
Sen. Joseph F. Guffey, D., Pa.,
whose infrequent speeches some
times have foreshadowed a new
legislative move by the Administra
tion, called for immediate U. S. con
voying of merchant ships to Britain
because of the "peril that confronts
us."
His views were challenged by Sen.
