# OPM Asks Deferment Deliberation
## Students Preparing For Essential Jobs Might Be Exempted 
### 
Serious consideration on the part
of all draft hoards was urged by
the Office of Production Manage
ment for all students preparing for
activities essential to national de
fense in a letter to Lewis Hershcy,
Deputy Director of the Selective
Service Administration.
The letter was sent by Hershey to
all state directors and reprinted in
the bulletins of the American Coun
cil on Education.
The O.P.M. based its request on
a survey made by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics showing that for
purposes of national defense the
continued stream of graduates into
the following fields should not be
diverted to other less productive
channels:
CHEMISTRY, ENGINEERING
Chemistry and the five branches of
engineeringâ€”civil, electrical, chemi
cal, mining (metallurgical), and me
chanical.
"The above occupations have been
especially studied by the Bureau
and a dangerously low level of man
power is found to exist therein," the
letter read in part.
Surveys, not yet completed, will
soon be released on other profes
sional fields in which there is also
expectation of a shortage.
Agricultural and sanitary engi
neering, dentistry pharmacy, phys
ics, medicine, biology, bacteriology,
geo-physics, meteorology, hydrology,
cartography.
FILE STATEMENTS
Dr. Karl M. Cowdery, associate
registrar, said that there were no
formal blanks to be filled out by
men seeking to be deferred in the
Selective Service Act rating so they
can complete their studies. The stu
dent should make out a statement
himself covering the probable date
of graduation, plans for further
preparation, the occupation which
he plans to enter, and also his eco
nomic ability to finance the balance
of his education.
This "Student Statement of In
formation" should be made out in
duplicate form. One should be given
to the local draft board and the
other should be given to Associate
Registrar Dr. Cowdery. Dr. Cowdery
is available to give information and
help in making out these statements
for the draft board.
