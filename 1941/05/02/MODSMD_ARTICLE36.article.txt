### FRANCES JAFFER 
Children will play in the sun-porch, study in the school room, and go
tvimming in an 18-by-34-foot swimming |>ool â€”and all part of a hospital!
For the Palo Alto Hospital hopes to begin work this year on a Physical
Tierapy wing, which would he the second of its kind in the West.
The new wing will hold an under-water treatment pool, for use in

iking care of poliomyelitis
ther types of paralysis cases, such
s spastic paralysis. An automatic
oist will lift the patients into the
001, and a trained physiotherapist
/ill give them exercises in water so
ot that no worker can stay in it
jr more than two hours, even pro
moted by rubber clothing.
The new building will also have
school room for the children who
/ill be sent here from all parts of
he Bay Aea, a sun porch, and mod
rn, well-equipped units of electro
herapy, fever-producing machines,
lassage, and a gymnasium. Adults
s well as children can be treated
>y the pool and other units, and it
vill be of great value to Stanford to
iave this wing in Palo Alto.
IKLPS MEI) SCHOOL
It will also help the Medical School
department of Physiotherapy, and
he Stanford Department of Wom
n's Health and Physical Education,
vhich are going to offer a course in
ihysical therapy training, and will
>e able to receive excellent training
t the new wing. Trained physical
herapists are very much in de
nand, especially right now for na
ional defense, and there are very
ew training courses offered for them.
Che army- alone could use all there
ire now available, and more.
The money to run the new wing
vill be received from crippled-chil
lren funds, President's Birthday Ball
noney, and other sources. It is also
loped that money will be donated
)y local patients. The county hos
)ital and other clinics and hospi
als of the Bay Area have agreed to
;end patients here, and a good many
>f the children will stay in the
Convalescent Home.
WARM-WATER POOL
A warm-water pool is very valu
ible, because patients who can't bend
i joint, or can hardly put their feet
m the ground, can move much more
reely and can Cven walk in a warm
vater pool. It will have different
lepths so they can sit or stand, and
patients of all ages and sizes can
ase it.
The whole unit will have a triple
Durpose. It will provide treatment
or patients, training of the much
leeded physical therapists, and re
search on improvements in old meth
ids of treatment, and new treat
ncnts.
['LANS FINISHED
It is hoped that building can begin
jy the end of this year. The plans
iave been finished. Most of the nec
issary money has been received,
hrough donations, but additional
contributions are needed before the
ictual work can start.
There will be a national conference
if physiotherapists at Stanford this
summer concerning the role of their
orofession in national defense. Miss
Catherine Worthingham, director
jf physical therapy at Stanford, and
president of the American Physical
rherapy Association, has announced
,hat probably at least 150 trained
physical therapists will attend the
convention.
