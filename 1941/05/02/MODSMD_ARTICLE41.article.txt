# Pro Arte Concert to Feature Works of Beethoven, Bloch
## 
### 
Sunday the Pro Arte String Quartet will present its fifth and final
concert of the year in the auditorium of Memorial Hall at 3:30 o'clock.
The program will consist of two quartets, the Quartet in F Minor, Opus
95, by Beethoven: ant! the quartet written in 1!)1(> by Ernest Bloch. Be
cause of the length of these two pieces, the Brahms Quartet originally

scheduled for this concert will be,
omitted.
Most composers have some rela
tionship with Beethoven, and Ernest
Bloch is related to Beethoven's third
or last period. While his music re
sembles Beethoven's in its dynamic
dissonance, yet it is completely dif
ferent in that Bloch's compositions
are exotic and highly coloi'ed.
QUARTET IS MELODIC
The Beethoven selection is the
last quartet in his second period. It
is the pivot between the second and
third periods, but it has more sym
metry and is more melodic than his
third period or the Bloch quartet.
Bloch is also known for the "prim
itive" themes he uses. The third
movement of this quartet, for ex
ample, begins with the song of a
primitive woman which is inter
rupted by the shouts of the hunters
returning, according to annotation
by Bloch.
LIVES IN U.S.
Ernest Bloch lived in Switzer
land until 1916, when he was forced
to leave by the war. He then came
to the United States, and he has
lived here ever since. He is at pres
ent on the faculty of the University
of California.
Last Wednesday Alfred Franken
stein spoke on the Beethoven and
Bloch quartets as well as the lives
of their composers in the regular
series of lectures on the program

which the Pro Arte Quartet plays
the following Sunday.
The Pro Arte concerts are pre
sented to Stanford by the Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge Foundation in the
Library of Congress and by the Stan
ford Friends of Music. Trie public
is invited to all concerts.
