Concert Series Manager Helen
Petersen and two assistants pre
viewed a recital of Helen Traubel,
dramatic soprano of the Metropoli
tan Opera Company, at the War Me
morial Opera House Tuesday eve
ning.
Miss Traubel's performance con
vinced the Series manager that her
concert scheduled for next season
here on campus will be a success.
As a dramatic soprano, she chooses
her program to cover the field and
seems to excel also in the lighter
selections.
The concert was composed of se
lections from Beethoven, Schubert,
Wagner, and several negro spiri
tuals which, according to Bob Hamp
ton and Henry Mohr, were rendered
to the delight of the audience.
