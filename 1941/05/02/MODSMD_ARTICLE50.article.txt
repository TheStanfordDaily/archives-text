# Yearling Golfers To Face S.F.J.C.
## 
### 
After running all over Cal's frosh
Rolf squad last week-end, Stan
ford's yearling club wielders will at
tempt a repeat performance tomor
row against San Francisco Junior
College.
The Junior Collegers should put
up a better scrap than the one that
the disorganized Bear golfers turned
in last Saturday. In spite of the fact
that Coach Twiggs gave almost all
the men on his squad a chance to
play, the Berkeleyites were still
unable to cop a point.
The frosh will be headed by No. 1
man George Traphagen, Loren La-
Prade, Jack Wilson, and Jim La-
Gasa.
