# Graying Derby Skies Move Up Porter's Cap to Top Choice
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Flashing the scarlet and white silks of Charles S. Howard, and com
manded by turfdom's 61-year-old training genius, Silent Tom Smith, Por
ter's Cap goes postward tomorrow at Churchill Downs against a classy
field of ten three-year-olds in the <i7th running of the $75,(100 Kentucky
Derby. The race goes at 2:45 o'clock, Pacific Standard Time.

Murky clouds hung over Louis-<
ville last night, and if the track
comes up muddy, Porter's Cap will
almost certainly go to the post, a
favorite over Our Boots, sensational
winner of the Bluegrass Stakes at
Keeneland.
Also high up in the betting is
Whirlaway, whose fast-closing ef
fort to Blue Paii in Tuesday's Derby
trial almost beat the winner, but on
going wide at the stretch turn Whirl
away lost considerable ground but
still came on fast enough to almost
catch Blue Pair at the wire.
CALIFORNIA HOPE
Porter's Cap, carrying the hopes
of California's racing gentry, will
be ridden by the dependable "mon
ey rider," Buddy Haas. Picked up as
a $1300 bargain at the Saratoga year
ling sales, the son of The Porter
walked away from all opposition in
the Santa Anita Derby on a muddy
track and thence was vanned to the
Chesapeake stakes.
On a dry track. Porter's Cap went
wire to wire, beating another Derby
entrant, Little Beans. Sons of The
Porter are supposed to go well only
on a muddy track, but Cap upset the
dope and led from start to flagfall,
proving his ability in the fast going.
But he's double dynamite in the
mud. Everything by The Porter likes
the soft stuff, and there's a 50-50
chance that the weather will turn
up rain, for May weather in Ken
tucky is tricky and Howard's luck
is a proverb in the racing game.
EAST PICKS OUR BOOTS
The East goes head over heels on
Our Boots, its answer to the West
for the choice.
Dispose, just shipped in from New
York, stepped off the train at Louis
ville Wednesday and turned the
milc-and-o-quarter Derby distance
in 2:06 3-5, is no longer considered
as a rank outsider.
Certain starters now, along with
Our Boots, Dispose, Porter's Cap,
Little Beans, Whirlaway, Blue Pair,
are Market Wise, Wood Memorial
winner, Valdina Paul, Swain, Rob
ert Morris, and Staretor, only other
California horse entered.

a $1300 bargain at the Saratoga year
ling sales, the son of The Porter
walked away from all opposition in
the Santa Anita Derby on a muddy
track and thence was vanned to the
Chesapeake stakes.
On a dry track. Porter's Cap went
wire to wire, beating another Derby
entrant, Little Beans. Sons of The
Porter are supposed to go well only
on a muddy track, but Cap upset the
dope and led from start to flagfall,
proving his ability in the fast going.
But he's double dynamite in the
mud. Everything by The Porter likes
the soft stuff, and there's a 50-50
chance that the weather will turn
up rain, for May weather in Ken
tucky is tricky and Howard's luck
is a proverb in the racing game.
EAST PICKS OUR BOOTS
The East goes head over heels on
Our Boots, its answer to the West
for the choice.
Dispose, just shipped in from New
York, stepped off the train at Louis
ville Wednesday and turned the
milc-and-o-quarter Derby distance
in 2:06 3-5, is no longer considered
as a rank outsider.
Certain starters now, along with
Our Boots, Dispose, Porter's Cap,
Little Beans, Whirlaway, Blue Pair,
are Market Wise, Wood Memorial
winner, Valdina Paul, Swain, Rob
ert Morris, and Staretor, only other
California horse entered.
Flashing the scarlet and white silks of Charles S. Howard, and com
manded by turfdom's 61-year-old training genius, Silent Tom Smith, Por
ter's Cap goes postward tomorrow at Churchill Downs against a classy
field of ten three-year-olds in the <i7th running of the $75,(100 Kentucky
Derby. The race goes at 2:45 o'clock, Pacific Standard Time.

Murky clouds hung over Louis-<
ville last night, and if the track
comes up muddy, Porter's Cap will
almost certainly go to the post, a
favorite over Our Boots, sensational
winner of the Bluegrass Stakes at
Keeneland.
Also high up in the betting is
Whirlaway, whose fast-closing ef
fort to Blue Paii in Tuesday's Derby
trial almost beat the winner, but on
going wide at the stretch turn Whirl
away lost considerable ground but
still came on fast enough to almost
catch Blue Pair at the wire.
CALIFORNIA HOPE
Porter's Cap, carrying the hopes
of California's racing gentry, will
be ridden by the dependable "mon
ey rider," Buddy Haas. Picked up as
