SO the Stanford athletic front
enters the doldrums every year
about this time. While San Fran
cisco sports pages rave about the
opening of trout season, the ap
proaching Kentucky Derby, and the
major leagues, a Daily sports editor
sits and racks his brain for copy to
fill his page.
Of course the Farm is interested
in its track team â€” anxious to hear
any scrap of good news to keep it
from believing that its trackmen are
as weak as that score in the Cal
meet last Saturday intimated.
And of course Stanford has two
major sport coast conference cham
pionship teams cavorting in spring
practice which bear watching.
There is the 1941 version of Clark
skyrocket - to - fame
Rose Bowl football team which is
working out four days a week in an
effort to polish several freshmen
gridders to the lustre of those three
graduating first-stringers.
And a remnant, a rather imposing
remnant at that, of an all-All-Coast
basketball team will next week enter
serious spring practice with work
outs four days a week for three
weeks.

of these three activities
there is little else cooking 011
the major sport front. The varsity
baseball team, however, has refused
to put away its bats and balls at the
terminus of their meager conference
season and is scheduling some
games with neighboring army camps.
A pioneering Stanford crew takes
a 900-mile trip to Los Angeles this
week-end to row 2000 meters against
U.C.L.A. The most traveled squad
in the University, the polo team,
warms up for a future trip to Utah
by also traveling to the Southland to
meet U.S.C. twice and the Riviera
Country Club.
A freshman golf team closes its
season with a match this Saturday
with San Francisco Junior College.
And to round out the sports activi
ties for what seems to be a strictly
social week-end, two Stanford five
man bowling teams play host in
Palo Alto's Indian Bowl to six other
visiting bowling teams.
