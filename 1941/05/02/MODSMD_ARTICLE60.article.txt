# Phillies Echo Red Sox Wail

### 
NEW YORK, May 1 (UP).—Joe
Cronin and Doc Prothro, managers
of the Boston Red Sox and Philadel
phia Phillies respectively, are two
distinct baseball personalities but
both have one thing in common—a
dire need of pitchers.
There is hardly any comparison
between the two teams as a whole.
The Red Sox are backed by the
millions of Tom Yawkey, have sev
eral able-bodied sluggers and a
playing manager. The Phillies an
nually operate on a shoestring, have
no outstanding batters and get their
orders from the dugout.
"You know, I can't remember
when I saw two of my pitchers go
the full nine innings," said Cronin,
in town for a recent series with the
Yankees, "and come through with
well-pitched jobs in the bargain.
DISTANCE MEN
"Sure, I've got lots of pitchers
but I'll change the whole bunch
for a few that can give me some
long-distance sharpshooting.
"Take the first half-dozen games
we played this season for example.
We won five of them but do you
know I had to use 14 pitchers? Jack
Wilson got kayoed in his first start
and I had to follow him up with
Herb Hash and Earl Johnson. Char
lie Wagner got belted in his first
start and I needed three other guys
before we won that one.
"I cut the consignment down to
two pitchers against the A's and then
thought wonders would never cease
when Emerson Dickman came
through with a solo job against the
same club. However, Hash had to
relieve Mike Ryba the next day
against Washington and Wilson
needed help from two others when
we lost our first game of the year
to the Senators.
