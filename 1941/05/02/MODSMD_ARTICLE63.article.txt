# P.A. Meet Draws Best Coast Talent
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
A! Katscliinski points with pride
to the star-spangled entry list of
the Pacific Association meet, a show
that will assemble the cream of
Coast track and field talent at Ed
wards Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
Harold Davis, the Morgan Hill
Meteor, and now the world's fast
est human, will be odds-on favorite
in the dashes. Running the hundred
consistently in 9.5 and 9.G, the Sa
linas J.C. star has been unbeatable
this year and there will be no one
in his class tomorrow. Jim Jurko
vieh will not run the sprints for
California and if Davis has any com
petition at all it will be in the per
sons of Joe Batiste and Bob Waters.
In J. he half-mile, a sensational
battle looms, with Warren Smith of
U.S.C. running headlong into a den
of Brutus Hamilton's roughest
Bears. Clarence Barnes will be
seeking revenge for his defeat at the
hands of Smith in the Cal-S.C. dual
meet and Grover Klemmer and
Dick Peter will be in there to help
their teammate out. Just to confuse
matters, Stanford will enter a trio of
fine middle distance men, Blair
Hyde, Kia Larsen, and Francis Ol
son.
WEED BACK AGAIN
A rapidly-improving Leroy Weed,
now down under the 4:15 mark, will
take another crack at Peter in the
mile where things should be pop
ping.
One of the finest javelin fields
ever assembled will hold the infield
spotlight. Bold Brown, A.A.U.
champ, Bob Peoples, holder of the
American record, and the host, Mar
tin Biles, whose favorite trick is to
wing the spear out into the far turn
of the track, will fight it out for
Coast javelin supremacy. All of
these men are consistent at dis
tances beyond the 220-foot mark.
Phil Fox, a truly great discus man,
will be doing his best to make the
eastern efforts of Archie Harris and
A1 Blozis look weak. He won't have
much competition but Fox, who
was Phil Levy at Stanford, may hit
the 170-foot mark tomorrow; remem
ber, he did IG9 at Stanford some
weeks ago.
WATCH CONNIE
And the Flying Dutchman, Con
nie Warmerdam, will be trying to
outdo himself once again. The pit at
Cal is one of his favorites, for it was
the scene of the first 15-foot vault
in history, a memorable feat.
Johnny Wilson, despite the fact
that he is now inclining in the
shadow of Bill Stewart and Les
Steers, may be up there around 6-8,
G-9.
Then there's Bill Trout in the shot,
Cazares in the two-mile, Batiste in
the hurdles, and a fine broad jump
field that includes Jurkovich, Cham
bers, and Frank Freeman of Salinas,
all of whom have cleared 24 feet.
FARM SENDS SQUAD
Stanford sends a full squad to the
meet to salvage some Edwards
Stadium laurels. The Berkeley track,
scene of last week's slaughter, will
see an improved Indian team, a
team that is capable of some fine
marks.
The Stanford sick Ifst includes Ed
Hertel, who has been in the rest
home with sinus trouble; Burm
Skrable, who has a bad cold; and
Thor Peterson, with a wrenched
knee. Blair Hyde, still working out
;> bum leg, is not in tip-top shape.
On the other hand, Pitch Johnson
is counting on stars like Emerson
Hiler and Jim Lincoln to come
through after a bad week.
