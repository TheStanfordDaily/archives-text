# Bomber to Fight Conn June 18th
## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 1 (UP).—Joe
Louis will defend his heavyweight
championship against Billy Conn in
New York's Polo Grounds, on June
18, Promoter Mike Jacobs announced
today. Louis first must defeat Buddy
Baer, brother of the former cham
pion, in his 17th defense of the title
on May 23 in Washington.
Should Buddy beat Joe, Jacobs in
dicated, then he probably will take
Louis' place against the slender-
Pittsburgh fighter. Conn, the light
heavyweight champion, is expected
to renounce that title formally be
fore he steps into the ring for the
heavyweight crown.
Two other leading contenders —
Lou Nova and Abe Simon, who re
cently went 13 rounds with the
champion—were shelved temporar
ily by Jacobs. The belief was that if
Louis wins his next two assignments,
Simon will fight him again in July
while Nova will be used as a chal
lenger for a big September show.

President McKinley scheduled an
appearance at a Stanford assembly
May 14, 1901.
