# Frosh Hurdlers To Enter P.A. Meet at Cal
## 
### 
Climaxing one of the most suc
cessful freshman track seasons in
ten years, Don Reiss and Joe Mar
dcsich, Papoose hurdlers, will enter
the annual Pacific Association track
meet tomorrow afternoon at Berke
ley.
Bob Waters, ace sprinter, who was
originally scheduled to enter, is a
doubtful starter with a bad leg,
while Bill Joslyn, greatly improved
discus thrower, is definitely out of
the meet. Joslyn has been too busy
with football practice to get suffi
cient practice with the platter.
VIII.ERS UNDEFEATED
Winning five and losing one meet,
the Jeffreymen wound up a suc
cessful season by .^Jiellacking Califor
nia, 72 to 5!), becoming the first Stan
ford squad in eight years to turn the
trick.
Most consistent of the Papoose cin
der men have been milers Waters
and Bob Compton, both undefeated.
Both spent three quarters working
on track and were in good condition
tor the first meet against Modesto
J.C., which Stanford won, 81 to 50.
Frequent rains kept other team
members from top condition.
SMITH, JOSLYN IMPROVED
Waters won the 100 in 9.8, and
repeated this fast time twice in other
meets. Compton won the mile in
3:35.1, another fast time.
Great improvement has been
shown by nigh jumper Willard
Smith. He progressed from a 5-foot
8-inch jump for second place against
Modesto to a winning leap of u feet
against the Bears.
REISS NEARS RECORD
Don Reiss came back to turn in
consistently excellent times. His
mark of 14.8 against Sacramento
was just two-tenths of a second off
Sammy Klopstock's school record.
Not to be overlooked are the men
who barely missed their letter after
good performances all season.
Among those in this category are
Wes Baylor in the javelin, Bob Bon
ner and Alan Rosenfeld in the 880,
Howard Wright in the high jump,
and Kenny Taix in the sprints. In
juries kept the latter two from the
California meet, which alone de
termines an award.

against the Bears.
REISS NEARS RECORD
Don Reiss came back to turn in
consistently excellent times. His
mark of 14.8 against Sacramento
was just two-tenths of a second off
Sammy Klopstock's school record.
Not to be overlooked are the men
who barely missed their letter after
good performances all season.
Among those in this category are
Wes Baylor in the javelin, Bob Bon
ner and Alan Rosenfeld in the 880,
Howard Wright in the high jump,
and Kenny Taix in the sprints. In
juries kept the latter two from the
California meet, which alone de
termines an award.
Climaxing one of the most suc
cessful freshman track seasons in
ten years, Don Reiss and Joe Mar
dcsich, Papoose hurdlers, will enter
the annual Pacific Association track
meet tomorrow afternoon at Berke
ley.
Bob Waters, ace sprinter, who was
originally scheduled to enter, is a
doubtful starter with a bad leg,
while Bill Joslyn, greatly improved
discus thrower, is definitely out of
the meet. Joslyn has been too busy
with football practice to get suffi
cient practice with the platter.
VIII.ERS UNDEFEATED
Winning five and losing one meet,
the Jeffreymen wound up a suc
cessful season by .^Jiellacking Califor
nia, 72 to 5!), becoming the first Stan
ford squad in eight years to turn the
trick.
Most consistent of the Papoose cin
der men have been milers Waters
and Bob Compton, both undefeated.
Both spent three quarters working
on track and were in good condition
tor the first meet against Modesto
J.C., which Stanford won, 81 to 50.
Frequent rains kept other team
members from top condition.
SMITH, JOSLYN IMPROVED
Waters won the 100 in 9.8, and
repeated this fast time twice in other
meets. Compton won the mile in
3:35.1, another fast time.
Great improvement has been
shown by nigh jumper Willard
Smith. He progressed from a 5-foot
8-inch jump for second place against
Modesto to a winning leap of u feet
against the Bears.
