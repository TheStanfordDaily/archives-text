# Turner Describes Sentiment Of Easterners on British Aid
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the fourth in a series of articles by Bill
Turner, recently returned from a conference with President Roosevelt.)

Just a word about the attitude of the eastern people I met toward help
ing the British. Naturally, in the whole of the East and especially New
York, there is a general feeling of closeness to the English people. Several

( New Yorkers I contacted were cor
responding with close friends and
relatives who resided in England,
and who were suffering from the
war.
In fact, many New Yorkers are
in a position similar to that of Mrs.
Kermit Roosevelt, who was my host
ess for the most part in the East.
She has a little grandson just at
tending Eton. He had written her
about the bombing of his school.
She quoted from the letter to the
effect: "Dear Mummy: I have a sur
prise for you. Eton was bombed last
night. All the ceilings of the build
ings fell in, but none of the boys
were hurt, etc." Just such a close
bond of sympathy as this makes
many eastern folks actually feel the
British cause is our cause.
I can also understand why those
connected with the shipping indus
try in New York would want to
help the British. It seemed as
though work along the New York
waterfront was at a standstill. Only
a few intercoastal steamers and sev
eral tubby ferry boats speckled the
waters of the gigantic harbor of the
world's biggest city. The Normandie
and several other foreign liners
were cooped up inactive at the re
specitve docks. The whole scene
was one of idleness.
