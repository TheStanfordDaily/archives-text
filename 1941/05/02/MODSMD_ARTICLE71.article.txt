# Stanford Crew Leaves Farm For U.C.L.A. Race Saturday
## 
### TED COLE 
A Stanford crew, short on practice' and hard-hit liy illness, leaves to
' day for the South, where it will race the U.C.L.A. varsity crew in a two
thousand-meter race Saturday.
Held up l>y needed repairs cn the shell ,the crew did not begin prac
; tice until last week. Since then lonf workouts have been held, but there

are si ill a great many rough spots<
in the crew's rowing. Poor slide- !
work has been the most noticeable
trouble, and Bud Clary, rowing at
stroke, has been having difficulty
with the rate of stroke because his
crew never gives him time to come
out to a full stroke.
Hank Melczer is the only member
of the crew that raced Oregon State,
left in the present varsity, on the
starboard side. Gerlach and Schaef
fer are no longer in school, and Bob
Porter has been ill the entire quar
ter. Melczer has been moved up
from the No. 5 seat to the 7 posi
tion, but his rowing there, while
powerful, is not suited to the posi
tion as well as to his old seat.
STARBOARD SIDE
The remainder of the starboard
side is made up of Jack Reese at
bow, a good but light oar, while
Bill Cilker is at 3 and John Al
tucker at 5. Both of these men never
rowed before this quarter, and they
are turning in very creditable per
formances in their positions. Both
are very powerful, but are notice
ably weak on their blade work. Al
tucker caught right onto the dif
ficulty of mastering his slide, and
is perhaps best of all at this, the
starboard side.
By far the most serious blow the
crew received was in the illness of
Lee Peake, the best all-around oar
on the crew. Peake is to make the
trip south, but will not be able to
row.
PORT GETS VETERANS
Despite the loss of Peake, the port
side will be made up of the more
experienced oarsmen as both Roger
Boas and Burl Cobb rowed against
Oregon State, besides Bud Clary,
who has been rowing brilliantly at
stroke. Ted Cole makes up the
fourth on the port side, but has only
just returned to rowing after being
out several months with an injured
leg.
Coaches Nemo Pedersen and
Kirk Smith have been spending a
great deal of time coaching the
crew, trying to make up for the
time lost at the beginning of the
quarter. The crew is powerful, but
not smooth, and has only an out
side chance of beating the Bimins.
But the crew likes its position of be
ing the underdog, and is determined
to do its best.
Eleven men will make the trip
south in members' cars. Expenses
will be paid by Boat Club funds.
The crew will stay on the U.CJ-/.A.
campus while they are down there,
as the guests of the Bruin crew.
The crew that will row against the
Bruins follows:
Bow, Jack Reese; 2, Burl Cobb;
3, Cilker; 4, Roger Boas - ; 5, John
Altucker; 6, Ted Cole; 7, Henry
Heelczer; stroke. Bud Clary; cox
swain, Walt Drake.

The crew will stay on the U.CJ-/.A.
campus while they are down there,
as the guests of the Bruin crew.
The crew that will row against the
Bruins follows:
Bow, Jack Reese; 2, Burl Cobb;
3, Cilker; 4, Roger Boas - ; 5, John
Altucker; 6, Ted Cole; 7, Henry
Heelczer; stroke. Bud Clary; cox
swain, Walt Drake.
A Stanford crew, short on practice' and hard-hit liy illness, leaves to
' day for the South, where it will race the U.C.L.A. varsity crew in a two
thousand-meter race Saturday.
Held up l>y needed repairs cn the shell ,the crew did not begin prac
; tice until last week. Since then lonf workouts have been held, but there

are si ill a great many rough spots<
in the crew's rowing. Poor slide- !
work has been the most noticeable
trouble, and Bud Clary, rowing at
stroke, has been having difficulty
with the rate of stroke because his
crew never gives him time to come
out to a full stroke.
Hank Melczer is the only member
of the crew that raced Oregon State,
left in the present varsity, on the
starboard side. Gerlach and Schaef
fer are no longer in school, and Bob
Porter has been ill the entire quar
ter. Melczer has been moved up
from the No. 5 seat to the 7 posi
tion, but his rowing there, while
powerful, is not suited to the posi
tion as well as to his old seat.
STARBOARD SIDE
The remainder of the starboard
side is made up of Jack Reese at
bow, a good but light oar, while
Bill Cilker is at 3 and John Al
tucker at 5. Both of these men never
rowed before this quarter, and they
are turning in very creditable per
formances in their positions. Both
are very powerful, but are notice
ably weak on their blade work. Al
tucker caught right onto the dif
ficulty of mastering his slide, and
is perhaps best of all at this, the
starboard side.
By far the most serious blow the
crew received was in the illness of
Lee Peake, the best all-around oar
on the crew. Peake is to make the
trip south, but will not be able to
row.
PORT GETS VETERANS
Despite the loss of Peake, the port
side will be made up of the more
experienced oarsmen as both Roger
Boas and Burl Cobb rowed against
Oregon State, besides Bud Clary,
who has been rowing brilliantly at
stroke. Ted Cole makes up the
fourth on the port side, but has only
just returned to rowing after being
out several months with an injured
leg.
Coaches Nemo Pedersen and
Kirk Smith have been spending a
great deal of time coaching the
crew, trying to make up for the
time lost at the beginning of the
quarter. The crew is powerful, but
not smooth, and has only an out
side chance of beating the Bimins.
But the crew likes its position of be
ing the underdog, and is determined
to do its best.
Eleven men will make the trip
south in members' cars. Expenses
will be paid by Boat Club funds.
