SURVEYS and polls seem to be very much in
style these days and somebody, reputable
or no, is continually surveying the nation or a
group of people to see what they are thinking
about present-day problems.
In the jazz days of the '20's, most members of
the older generation —who, incidentally, were
sending their sons and daughters to college—
dismissed with a snort the possibility of any
serious, constructive thought on the part of col
lege students.
Possibly they were right.
But to a great degree this popular sentiment
has been definitely and continually on the down
grade during the past decade.
One of our popular magazines, Redbook, re
cently sent a reporter up to the Yale campus
at New Haven just to check up on things in
general at a representative American university.
The findings of this reporter agree to a great
extent with what we at Stanford think about
ourselves. And the survey is too complete to
receive adequate treatment in so small a space.
However, an analysis by the University's Dean
De Vane of the change in popularity of major
subjects over the past twelve years provides an
interesting commentary.
In the 1928 heyday of Wall Street idolatry
when almost every college grad expected to
make his fortune in less than fifteen years and
then retire, he majored in English Literature.
Or at least 290 Yale men out of a class of 550 did.
During the depression when college lost, to
a great extent, its country club atmosphere, and
became more and more a place for serious
study, registration in English Literature received
a tremendous set-back. There were 75 majors in
the department in 1933.
Students began taking courses which would
help them understand their environment, radi
cally changed for them by the depression.
There were no more quick Wall Street for
tunes.
What did they take instead of English Lit?
They took history, government, international
relations, sociology. Social science departments
of universities throughout the country suddenly
found themselves undermanned.
Dean De Vane feels these trends mean the
American college student "has become world
minded, government-minded, and intensely pre
occupied with social problems."
But the student of the social sciences now
finds he has studied the wrong things. The
government wants chemists, engineers, doctors
for national defense.
The social science student becomes a buck
private in the front lines. He is of no more use
today than gun fodder. He seemingly can help
win a war only by sacrificing himself.
This will undoubtedly start another trend in
the graph of college students' major courses.
But after the few remaining social scientists
have helped to patch up the world at the end
of this debacle, then where will the trend go,
back to English Lit?—C. B.
