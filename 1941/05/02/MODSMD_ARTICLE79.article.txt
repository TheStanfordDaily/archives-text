# The 						Peaceful Ones

T~)EOPLE today have become so schooled to
XT this world's many present incongruities that
they dismiss most of them with a shrug.
But yesterday Moscow celebrated May Day
with such a show of incongruity that it deserves
more than just a passing glance.
Out from the center of the most massive dis
play of military strength ever assembled in one
country at one time, comes a "strong . . . ap
peal for world peace."
Russia—appealing for world peace.
Russia, the bear, who is waiting behind her
formidable army with bayonets set, waiting for
the first gasping signs of exhaustion on one side
or the other, appealing for world peace out of
one side of her leering mouth, and warning
out of the other side any nation who dares attack
Soviet territory that that nation will be anni
hilated.
Though Russia has not technically entered
actual battle in the present war on one side or
the other, it is certain that she will never permit
a peace right now on Germany's terms.
She knows such a peace would be a stepping
stone to a future battle for the complete suprem

acy of Europe between Nazi and Red. England
is keeping the Nazis occupied for a while.
Nevertheless Russia orderd its far-flung army
to keep its "powder dry and maintain a state of
mobilized readiness so that no tricks of our for
eign enemies will catch us unawares."
And Russia wants everyone else to stop fight
ing and make peace!—C. B.
