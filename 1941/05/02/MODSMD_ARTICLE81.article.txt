jJN THESE DAYS when the dominant motif in base
ment architecture is bombs instead of beer, the
public is as jittery about propaganda as a moralist is
about bathing suits. In fact, one of our favorite Ameri
can pastimes is the pursuit of propaganda. We harry
some disagreeable opinion through the columns of a
paper, corner it at the bottom of the page, and pierce
it with the one savage epithet, "Propaganda."
Perhaps it is pure coincidence, but the opinions
which we shatter thus are always those which clash
with our previous ideas.
Just at the moment Stanford is getting a sore
shoulder patting its back for a neat bit of ferreting.
With lightning judgment we tagged Dr. Ichihashi's
pro-Japan speech and refused to receive a word of it.
Wherefore, we point to this brilliant bit of sales re
sistance and say patronizingly that Stanford is immune
to the propaganda virus.
* * * +
¥ IKE most Americans we believe that never again
will we be persuaded to do a rescue job on other
people's chestnuts. We point to our recent triumph
and say with the glowing pride of a child who has
resisted the temptation to drink Saniflush, "See—we
don't believe it."
What seems forgotten is the fact that successful
propaganda like a successful criminal is never rec
ognized.
Probably when we called three strikes on Dr. Ichi
hashi we exercised judgment that would make Solo
mon look like rather poor police court material. But
unfortunately we have not turned the same astound
ing judgment upon the numerous pro-China stories
that float about the campus, cropping out in The Daily
and leavening the coke conversation at the Union.
* * * *
There is, for instance, the charming little yarn about
Japan's dream of world domination. It gives you a
nasty feeling in the stomach to compare this morsel
with almost identical items about Germany that cir
culated before the World War.
Very possibly the story has some facts behind it.
Every nation dreams of magnificence in these days
when nationalism runs the Holy Trinity a close sec
ond in popularity. But it is interesting to note that
while the authority for the story is usually placed in
the past, the yarn itself appeared very recently. And
it appeared in the same form simultaneously in several
places.
* * # *
I DO NOT mean that the gentle little Russian men
tioned in our campus opinion was drawing a salary
from Peiping; or that he went around the country
breaking his glasses and spreading the insidious mes
sage . Nor do I doubt the validity of the dispatches
from China we printed last week.
But it seems fairly logical to believe that some
Chinese propaganda is afloat in this country. Eng
land, France, China, and many American commercial
interests would benefit if they could swing the sup
port of the United States.
♦ >»« * s«
But we calmly swallow the pro-Chinese stories and
not so calmly junk the pro-Japanese ones. Perhaps
that indicates that Justice and Righteousness are shoot
ing their roll on the Chinese. Or perhaps it indicates
that we are the world's greatest consumers of propa
ganda.
We might take a minute off from our back-patting
to consider the question. Damn clever, these Chinese.

There is, for instance, the charming little yarn about
Japan's dream of world domination. It gives you a
nasty feeling in the stomach to compare this morsel
with almost identical items about Germany that cir
culated before the World War.
Very possibly the story has some facts behind it.
Every nation dreams of magnificence in these days
when nationalism runs the Holy Trinity a close sec

while the authority for the story is usually placed in
the past, the yarn itself appeared very recently. And
it appeared in the same form simultaneously in several

sage . Nor do I doubt the validity of the dispatches
from China we printed last week.

Chinese propaganda is afloat in this country. Eng

it with the one savage epithet, "Propaganda."
