# CAMPUS OPINION
## BITTER BARRAGE 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
Wednesday morning about 3 o'clock and Wed
nesday night about 11:30 the concrete of Encina Bull
pen parking lot resounded with a barrage of bottles.
They were tossed out of the window of some resident
of Encina. Using the cover of a darkened room, the
culprits will probably never be caught.
I would like to suggest through the medium of The
Daily that all delivery of milk and orange juice to
late-rising Encina residents who can't make breakfast,
be stopped. It is a sad commentary that the procedure
used in dealing with babies has to be used in dealing
with men who are supposed to have reached at least
the earliest stages of maturity. But matches just have
to be kept out of baby's reach.
If these frosh with an unquenchable mania for
throwing bottles have their bottles taken away from
them, they will have to stop throwing them, we hope.
An added consequence is the fact that no one
with any sense will ndw park his car in this side of
the Bull-pen, knowing he will either get tires cut, a
window broken, or his top dented in. This merely
adds to the congestion out front.
So, here's for taking the bottles away from the
babies.
