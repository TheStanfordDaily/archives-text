# LINDBERGH

### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
Having just read a letter in Campus Opinion at
tacking Lindbergh I find myself with a slight attack
of nausea.
Lindbergh left the country of his birth â€”after all it
did for him, says "Angry." Yes, after it killed one of
his children and threatened the other.
He talked about how powerful the Nazis were and
how they were sure to win. Hasn't everything that has
happened this last year born that statement out?
They have at least won over 14 countries which ought
to be enough winning for any man's money. Can
"Angry" assert after reading the headlines every morn
ing for months that Germany is not powerful? And
is there anything "un-American" in calling Germany
so?
I'm for doing all we can to help Britain, short of
war, but I certainly can't understand one who be
lieves himself to be a loyal United States citizen and
a supposedly intelligent person, since he goes to Stan
ford. condemning an argument because he doesn't
wish to believe it rather than because it isn't true.
As far as intrinsic worth and true "Americanism
I think "Angry" is the one to be denied the right of
speech rather than Lindbergh.
Disgusted.
