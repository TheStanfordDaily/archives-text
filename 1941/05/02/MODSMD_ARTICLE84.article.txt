### 
THE BAD MAN,'' Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer, now playing at the Stan
ford Theater in Palo Alto.
Pancho Lopez, snarling Mexican
bandit played by Wallace Beery,
turns out to be the fairy-godmother
~o Ronald Reagan and Laraine Day
in MGM's latest shootin' saga, "The
Jad Man." And having stolen Cow
ooy Jones's (Reagan) cattle, Lopez
inally discovers that it was the kid
.vho saved his life many years be
fore.
OrufT but never forgetful of a
kindness, the famous bandit arrives
n the proverbial nick of time to
escue his pal, Jones, from the
-•lutches of the real villain-(in busi
ness man's clothing) who is on the
/ergo of foreclosing the mortgage on
Jones's ranch.
Best character part in the produc
tion is that of Jones's grouchy uncle,
Dortrayed in his usual fine manner
by Lionel Barrymore. The uncle is
confined to a wheel-chair, which he
nanipulates with a mechanic's skill,
Dut none of the zip and fire in his
soul is crippled. He almost curses
at the general state of affairs, but
inally rejoices when Lopez paves
the way for him to even things up
with the wicked landlord.
The final scene of the horse movie
oretty well sums up the logic of
(he whole story. Lopez, astride his
trusty steed, is seen galloping over
deserts, through brush, up and down
canyons, with Actor Barrymore fol
lowing close behind in his sturdy
wheel-chair attached to Lopez' horse
by a thick rope. Barrymore is calmly
downing a bottle of tequila.
The second picture is "Free and
Easy," starring Robert Cummings,
Ruth Hussey, and C. Aubrey Smith.
Love triumphs again in this tale, but
for a long time riches and a life of
?ase run it a close second. Cum
mings and Hussey are both in search
of wealthy spouses, but finally settle
for love on a dime.—Badger

lowing close behind in his sturdy
wheel-chair attached to Lopez' horse

Ruth Hussey, and C. Aubrey Smith.

for a long time riches and a life of

THE BAD MAN,'' Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer, now playing at the Stan
ford Theater in Palo Alto.
Pancho Lopez, snarling Mexican
bandit played by Wallace Beery,
turns out to be the fairy-godmother
~o Ronald Reagan and Laraine Day
in MGM's latest shootin' saga, "The
Jad Man." And having stolen Cow
ooy Jones's (Reagan) cattle, Lopez
inally discovers that it was the kid
.vho saved his life many years be
fore.
OrufT but never forgetful of a
kindness, the famous bandit arrives
n the proverbial nick of time to
escue his pal, Jones, from the
-•lutches of the real villain-(in busi
ness man's clothing) who is on the
/ergo of foreclosing the mortgage on
Jones's ranch.
Best character part in the produc
tion is that of Jones's grouchy uncle,
Dortrayed in his usual fine manner
by Lionel Barrymore. The uncle is
confined to a wheel-chair, which he
nanipulates with a mechanic's skill,
Dut none of the zip and fire in his
soul is crippled. He almost curses
at the general state of affairs, but
inally rejoices when Lopez paves
the way for him to even things up
with the wicked landlord.
The final scene of the horse movie
oretty well sums up the logic of
(he whole story. Lopez, astride his
trusty steed, is seen galloping over
deserts, through brush, up and down
canyons, with Actor Barrymore fol
lowing close behind in his sturdy
wheel-chair attached to Lopez' horse
by a thick rope. Barrymore is calmly
downing a bottle of tequila.
