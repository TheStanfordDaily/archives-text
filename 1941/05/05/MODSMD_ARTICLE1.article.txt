# History ...1941

### Jean Nowell 
r PHREE men made important
speeches yesterday. Two of
these were Americans —Franklin D.
Roosevelt and President James B.
Conant of Harvard. The third was
Adolf Hitler. The two Americans had
plenty to say, and their words, of a
certainty, were of vital importance
to the citizens of this country. But
the speeches do not require analysis,
because both of them said just ex
actly what they meant.
During the dedication of a new
national shrine at the birthplace
of Woodrow Wilson, President
Roosevelt again pledged America's
faith in the freedom of democracy
in the world and asserted that the
United States is "ever ready to
fight again" to preserve that faith.
Dr. Conant, who just recently re
turned from a six weeks' official trip
to England, said that the United
States should go to war against the
Axis Powers immediately, and
stated that the question is not "shall
America fight?" but "when shall
America fight?" He thinks that "our
best hope of avoiding later battle
against desperate odds is to become
a naval belligerent now , . . the
hour for action has struck."
Carping critics will point out,
quite correctly, that Dr. Conant was
far more specific than President
Roosevelt. Speaking as a "private
citizen" he had the right to be so.
However, the phrase "ever ready to
fight again" should give anybody
who read or heard it a pretty good
idea of where the President stands.

JIJERR HITLER'S little oration in
the Berlin Opera House was no
less significant than the other two
speeches (probably more so since he
is the immediate cause of the pres
ent state of world affairs). How
ever, while the Fuehrer probably
thinks he has his opinions and plans
straight in his own mind, he doesn't
make them very clear to his hear
ers. Even his old chum Hermann
Goering appeared a little baffled. It
was his job to make the closing
speech and all he could think of to
say was that Hitler is a very great
man and all the actions of the past
few months came out of the Fueh
rer's own tousled head.
Literally the speech was long on
generalities and dirty words, and
very short on hints of things to
come. He spent most of his time
summing up the Balkan victory,
although, perhaps inadvertently,
he admitted that he cxpects the
war lo he a long one.
The things he failed to mention
are the important clues to his prob
lems. For instance, his only refer
ence to the United States was an in
direct one when he said:
"When today democratic agita
tors of countries to which the Ger
mans have never done any harm
thi'eatcn to choke our state with
force by their capitalistic system
and materialistic production, I an
swer that we will never again wit
ness a 1918, but will rise in ever
higher achievements."

now easing gently out of
all dangerous commitments
with any nation, was ignored, as was
Japan, and the whole African and
Asiatic campaigns. He almost point
edly failed to mention his old prom
ise of victorious peace during 1941.
He stated that documents
had been found proving that
Churchill wanted to spread the
war to the Balkans, trying to de
lay the Libyan war. Here he tacit
ly admitted that the unwanted
Balkan affair had delayed tactics
in Libya by stopping his chances
for getting reinforcements across
the Mediterranean before the Brit
ish could bring their men into
position.
"I look to the future with perfect
tranquility and the greatest confi
dence," he said excitedly. "Naziism
will last 1000 years."
"I never revile an enemy," he
added.
He then called Winston Churchill
a madman and a fool, a war-mon
ger, an incendiary, history's "blood
iest dilettante," and, in effect a
drunkard. Churchill calls Hitler
"that bad man."
There it is—the salient points of
Hitler's speech —it doesn't even
make too much sense.
