# Luftwaffe Fleets Unload Destruction on Liverpool
## London Counterclaims with Story Of Superbombing in North Germany 
### 
BERLIN, May 4 (UP). â€”Hundreds of German planes bombed Liverpool
last night with "crushing" effect, setting innumerable fires in one of the
heaviest air attacks yet made on military objectives of a British city, Nazi
sources claimed tonight.
Excellent visibility was said to have enabled pilots to score effective

hits which started fires visible 50
miles.
The high command said the attack
continued for several hours, and
when it was over great blazes raged
along the banks of the Mersey River
amid grain elevators, warehouses
and other structures.
Numerous effective attacks were
reported carried out against other
objectives in the British Isles.

(In admitting the attack the Lon
don version was as follows: "The
German air force, which lost a rec
ord 16 planes to British defenses Sat
urday night, subjected the Liver
pool-Merseyside area to another big
scale bombing last night and early
today. It was the fourth such suc
cessive attack.")
