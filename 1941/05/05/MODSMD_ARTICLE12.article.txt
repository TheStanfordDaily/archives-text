LONDON, May 4 (UP).â€”British
planes dropped many tons of super
bombs in the industrial heart of
northwest Germany last night, the
Air Ministry said tonight.
Cologne got its first taste of the
new type explosive in an attack
which "must have done immense
damage."
In a day and night offensive Brit
ish air raiders also were reported to
have ranged over the continental
coast from French Atlantic ports to
southern Norway, blasting at the
battle cruisers Scharnhorst and
Gneisenau at Brest, and sinking two
or more supply ships in Dover
Straits.
