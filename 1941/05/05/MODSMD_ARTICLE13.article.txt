LONDON, May 4 (UP).—British
bombers today flew over fabled
Baghdad, blasting an army airdrome
on the outskirts and demolishing
military buildings, as reinforcements
of imperial troops moved up the
Tigris Valley toward the Iraq capi
tal.

Axis reports claimed that Iraqi
forces of pro-German Premier Ra
shid Ali Beg Gailiani have cut the
Kirkuk-to-H'iifa V>il pipeline—ar
tery of life blood for Britain's fleet
and forces in the Near East—and had
flooded the rich Mosul oil fields.
