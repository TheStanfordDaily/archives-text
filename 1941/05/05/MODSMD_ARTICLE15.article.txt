## 
### 

IN EVER WIDENING ARCS, the scope of the United States naval and air patrols is being extended into
the Atlantic as a safeguard for shipments from the arsenal of democracy to Britain. Map shows how the
2000-mile patrols mentioned by Admiral Harold R. Stark, chief of naval operations, would take the United
States vessels to the mid-Atlantic and to the shores of Ireland on the 2000-mile huh on our easternmost base
in Newfoundland.
