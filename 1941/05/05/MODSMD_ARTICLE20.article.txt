# 'Pimpernel', 'Clancy' Score Hit as Second Sunday Bill
## 
### 
It was a really good show in the Education Building's theater last night.
The second in the scries of Sunday night movies came off there and was
apparently much enjoyed by a nice-sized crowd. The feature was "The
Scarlet Pimpernell," with "Clancy" and a cartoon thrown in.
"The Scarlet Pimpernel" was good movie seven or eight years ago and

,it still can with the best of the
modern - day flickers. The whole
thing concerns the intrigue involved
in getting French nobles out of
France at the time of the French
Revoution's "terror."
LOVELY MEItLE
It seems that there is an English
group headed by Leslie Howard who
do their best to smuggle the nobles
out of France. It seems also that
Leslie has a lovely wife, Merle Obe
ron, whom the French ambassador,
Raymond Massey, has in his clutches.
Massey, the villain, of course, tries
to drag information about the Scar
let Pimpernel from Merle, since no
one knows who the Pimpernel is.
The Pimpernel, of course, is Les
lie who acts as an unloving fop to
his wife and most of the rest of the
English "upper crust." This is part
of his disguise.
MASSEY WRONG
Naturally Merle eventually dis
covers that her husband is the cour
ageous fellow and the situation nar
rows down to the point where Mas
sey with the aid of his eighteenth
century gestapo thinks he has the
Pimpernel trapped in the act of
smuggling a few aristocrats from
France. Massey is wrong and Leslie
and Merle fade out with love bloom
ing anew.
The cartoon wasn't bad and
"Clancy" was as usual uproarious.
The installation of fans, incidentally,
helped the ventilation a couple of
hundred per cent.
