Stanford University has been
placed on the list of institutions
whose v*>rk in the professional
training of chemists has been ap
proved by the American Chemical
Society, according to an announce
ment received by President Ray Ly
man Wilbur.

In a report on the significance of
this move, the society's Committee
on the Professional Training of
Chemists declared that students
who receive the bachelor's degree
from approved institutions and ful
fill certain minimum requirements
Income eligible for full membership
in the American Chemical Society
following gi'aduation and two years'
experience in the field of chemistry
or chemical engineering or in post
graduate study.

Students who graduate in chem
istry or chemical engineering from
other colleges will be eligible only
after a long period, the committee
said.

There has been no intention of
specifying the exact contents of
any course in outlining the mini
mum requirements to be met, merely
of making certain that the student
is broadly educated and adequately
trained in chemistry, it was pointed
out in the report.
