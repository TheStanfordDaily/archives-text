## Pro Arte Group Ends Season with Bloch, Beethoven Quartets 
### 
Closing their concert series at
Stanford, the Pro Arte String Quar
tet yesterday played the Quartet in
!•' Minor, Opus 95, l>y Beethoven,
and the quartet written in 1!) 10 by
Ernest Bloch.
The Beethoven quartet was the
last quartet written in Beethoven's
second period, and is therefore al
most a pivot between the second
and third periods.
The Bloch quartet, although it is
no), one of his more recent works, is
.still one of his best. The first move
ment was almost mournful in qual
ity. The second movement has two
sections of "turmoil" separated by
an interval of reflection. The third
movement was inspired by Gau
guin's paintings of Polynesia. The
fourth movement began with the
song of a primitive mother and
closed when the hunters returned.
REFLECTS MOOD
The sadness of the first movement
is probably a result of Bloch's en
forced mpve from Switzerland to
America in 1916, the year in which
the quartet was written. There are
traces of this melancholy through
out, but it is most evident in the
first movement.
The primitive subject of the theme
in the quartet is a characteristic of
Bloch's music. It is highly colored,
almost exotic, and not particularly
melodic.
