# Press to Print Science Books
## Engineering Studies To Be Released 
### 
The Stanford University Press will
soon publish two books of interest
to engineers. This month "The
Mechanism of the Electric Spark,"
wirtten jointly by Dr. Leonard B.
Loeb, professor of physics at the
University of California, and Dr.
John M. Meek, English research en
gineer, will be printed.
This analyzes in detail the new
theory of the mechanism of the
electric spark, and applies Dr.
Meek's general quantitative theory
to breakdown problems. It also
shows the failure of the Townsend
theory at pressures around atmos
pheric and gaps exceeding 3 mm. in
length.
In June "The Profession of Engi
neering" by Theodore Hoover and
John Charles Lonsbury Fish, de
scribing the qualifications and duties
of the professional engineer and the
capacities for future development,
will be published.
This book deals mainly with the
sphere and status of civil, mining,
mechanical, electrical and chemical
engineering and the growing need
for more men in the profession.
Points of technology are introduced
to illustrate when specific examples
require some understanding of
them.
