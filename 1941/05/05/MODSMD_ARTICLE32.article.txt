# Scholar Dips Into Politics, Farm Sports

### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Pull with the big shots is what
you need to get ahead in Stanford's
machine caucuses, says Darrell Rit
ter, S.A.E. Although Ritter, sopho
more politician for the S.A.E.'s, ad
mits that the Dekes have the strong
est machine on campus he claims
that there is no doubt about the
fact that S.A.E. is the best house on
the Farm.
"The S.A.E.'s don't specialize in
anything particularly," Ritter said.
"That's why we're so well rounded.
And we're congenial too, so that
makes everybody happy."
HOLDS SCHOLARSHIP
Ritter holds a four-year scholar
ship donated by Guy C. Bowman.
Mr. Bowman started the scholarship
in memory of the registrar at Ash
land High School in Ohio, which is
where Ritter went to school before
coming to Stanford. Because of this
scholarship, Stanford grads are nu
merous among Ashland's native
sons.
"I don't claim much success as a
politician," Ritter commented. "But
the way to get around at these
caucuses is by knowing the right
people. I met most of them in En
cina last year. The Row usually
votes in a blockâ€”the clan instinct,
you know. But the caucuses don't
work when the guys feel strongly
enough to vote as individuals."
SPECULATES
Water polo is Ritter's second most
important activity. If Duncan Patty
comes back, he thinks that the
Stanford team has a good chance to
win the conference next year.
During Convalescent Home Week,
Ritter worked on the Brunch Com
mittee and the Barbecue entertain
ment program.
"And Muheim is a good guy,"
Ritter concluded.
