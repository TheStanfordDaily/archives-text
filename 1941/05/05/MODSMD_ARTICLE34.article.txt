# Farm to Honor Dr. Burlingame On Retirement
## Biologist to Continue Heredity Research After National Tour 
### 
For the first time since 1935 Stan
ford University will pay honors to
only one retiring faculty member.
Dr. Leonas L. Burlingame, geneti
cist and professor of biology, will be
the only candidate for emeritus in
contrast with the four to nine of
previous years.
Looking forward to his retirement
only as the beginning of future
work, Dr. Burlingame has already
mapped out his schedule for almost
a year. Following a vacation in the
mountains, he will begin in mid
summer a 20,000-mile tour around
the nation to last until February.
During his trip, he will continue
his investigations into certain as
pects of genetics—his life work,
which last year resulted in the pub
lication of "Heredity and Social
Problems," his second book. He also
plans to attend various meetings of
learned scientific and genetic socie
ties in the course of his trip.
Professor Burlingame has taught at
Stanford since 1909, when he began
as an instructor in botany. He re
ceived his Ph.D. degree at the Uni
versity of Chicago in 1908. follow
ing his graduation there in 1906. He
also taught at the University of
Oregon and was field assistant to
the Department of Agriculture in
the World War.
In his program for the next year,
Professor Burlingame will continue
his studies of heredity of man and
plants and their relation to each
other as well as to man's relation to
a rapidly changing environment.
