# Spring Show Plot Combines Babies, Newspapers, Politics
## 
### 
Hundreds of babies, a reasonably inaccurate facsimile of the newspa
per business, fragrant politics, and a little light crime make up the funda
mental components of "How's Your Circulation?" Ram's Head's fifth
annual Spring Show, scheduled to take up residence in Memorial Hall
Hi and 17 at 8:15 o'clock.

Besides the above-mentioned fac
tors, Author-Director Bud Cady has
announced that all the basic things
"like love, and the struggle for ex
istence, and stuff" are included more
) or less incidentally and casually.
Specifically the story concerns
Amner Grum, a newspaper pub
lisher who is fighting the political
| machine of Mayor Hoag in a city
which remains nameless. A high
pressure character has an idea for a
tremendous baby contest to boost
the paper's circulation and promot
ing Grum's popularity with the city's
home-loving element so that he will
be elected mayor. A nice gangster,
Toots Grinelli, who loves babies,
[ particularly his shapely daughter,
[ Mona, is the mayor's strong-arm
] man.
BARIFS FOR ALL
Adding to the complications are a
corps of nurses who desire that
practically everyone shall have
babies, Grum's daughter, Susan,
who falls in and out of love with
Tony, and Mona, Grinelli's daugh
ter, who is married to 'a cad and a
' bounder.
According to Cady, particular
" care has been taken to weave the
" plot, songs, and dances together so
that each is an integral part of the
show.
