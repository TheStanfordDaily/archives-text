# Registrar Returns From Convention
## 
### 
Registrar J. P. Mitchell returned
Saturday from attending a meeting
of collegiate registrars in Chicago.
His eastern trip also included busi
ness appointments in Boston and
New York.
According to Mitchell, the feeling
among registrars at the convention
on the effect of the draft on future
enrollment was that the situation is
quite unpredictable now.
