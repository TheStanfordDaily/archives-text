# Farm Crewmen Lose to U.C.L.A.
## 
### 
One thousand spectators stood on
the banks of Ballona Creek in Los
Angeles last Saturday and watched
a game Stanford crew fight a losing
battle against illness, lack of prac
tice, and a smooth-stroking shell of
U.C.L.A. oarsmen.
Those onlookers saw the Bruin
crew leap into an early lead of two
lengths at the 500-meter mark, move
three lengths out in front of the Card
boat at the halfway point, and cross
the finish line with seven lengths of
water flowing between them and the
hard-trying Stanford crewmen. The
Bruins were clocked in 5 minutes
59 seconds, with the Indian oars
men finishing in 6 minutes 28 sec
onds.
Standing on the sidelines watch
ing his teammates row a losing race
was Lee Peake, best all-around oar
on the crew, who made the trip
south but was unable to take his
place in the shell due to illness.
The victory was the first that the
Bruins have taken this year.
