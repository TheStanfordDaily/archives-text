# Falling Hurdle Stops Frosh From Beating Champ Batiste
## 
### 
A falling fifth hurdle kept Don Reiss, Stanford freshman track man,
from taking a first or second in the annual Pacific Athletic Association
track meet last Saturday on Edwards Field at Berkeley.
Leading Joe Batiste, Sacramento J. C. negro, national A.A.U. high
hurdle champion last year, by two yards, Reiss barely tipped the hurdle

>but tangled up in it just as Ed Her
tel, Verne Hart, and Jim Lincoln did
on Edwards Field a week ago.
Batiste went on to win in 14.8,
which Reiss equalled a week and a
half ago against Sacramento. Pre
viously, Reiss had taken second to
Batiste in the qualifying race.
REISS SCORES
The smooth striding Batiste might
have caught Reiss but a second
would have been assured since Reiss
easily beat Frank Sullivan and Les
Angelich, Sacramento teammates of
Batiste, who took second and third,
in their last encounter.
Perhaps the answer to Stanford's
troubles with Berkeley hurdles lies
in the type of construction. Angell
Field has hurdles with bases built
in a rectangular form, which fall
fairly flat when they are hit. How
ever. California's lighter hurdles,
built with a V-type base, have a
tendecy to fly out when hit.
Joe Mardesich, second yearling
hurdler, qualified for the finals but
failed to place. A pulled muscle
kept Bob Waters, ace frosh sprinter,
out of the meet. Waters was about
the only man who could have given
Harold Davis, Salinas J. C. flyer,
much competition.
JOSLYN'S BEST
Another possible entrant, Bill
Joslyn, decided to devote his time
to spring football. However, Bill's
best effort, 140 feet 3 inches, would
have failed to place. This mark
still represented great improvement
over his first competitive toss of the
season of 129 feet against Modesto
J. C.

Reiss, Waters, Mardesich, and
Joslyn as well as Bob Compton, Russ
Collier, Jean Lamoure, Bob Bonner,
Kenny Taix, and Pat Taylor should
prove to be valuable additions to
next year's varsity squad.
Compton, who won both the mile
and two-mile against the California
freshman, will be very much wel
comed by Coach Pitch Johnson.
Coach Johnson will be virtually
without distance men next year.

Reiss, Waters, Mardesich, and
Joslyn as well as Bob Compton, Russ
Collier, Jean Lamoure, Bob Bonner,
Kenny Taix, and Pat Taylor should
prove to be valuable additions to
next year's varsity squad.
Compton, who won both the mile
and two-mile against the California
freshman, will be very much wel
comed by Coach Pitch Johnson.
Coach Johnson will be virtually
without distance men next year.
A falling fifth hurdle kept Don Reiss, Stanford freshman track man,
from taking a first or second in the annual Pacific Athletic Association
track meet last Saturday on Edwards Field at Berkeley.
Leading Joe Batiste, Sacramento J. C. negro, national A.A.U. high
hurdle champion last year, by two yards, Reiss barely tipped the hurdle

>but tangled up in it just as Ed Her
tel, Verne Hart, and Jim Lincoln did
on Edwards Field a week ago.
Batiste went on to win in 14.8,
which Reiss equalled a week and a
half ago against Sacramento. Pre
viously, Reiss had taken second to
Batiste in the qualifying race.
REISS SCORES
The smooth striding Batiste might
have caught Reiss but a second
would have been assured since Reiss
easily beat Frank Sullivan and Les
Angelich, Sacramento teammates of
Batiste, who took second and third,
in their last encounter.
Perhaps the answer to Stanford's
troubles with Berkeley hurdles lies
in the type of construction. Angell
Field has hurdles with bases built
in a rectangular form, which fall
fairly flat when they are hit. How
ever. California's lighter hurdles,
built with a V-type base, have a
tendecy to fly out when hit.
Joe Mardesich, second yearling
hurdler, qualified for the finals but
failed to place. A pulled muscle
kept Bob Waters, ace frosh sprinter,
out of the meet. Waters was about
the only man who could have given
Harold Davis, Salinas J. C. flyer,
much competition.
JOSLYN'S BEST
Another possible entrant, Bill
Joslyn, decided to devote his time
to spring football. However, Bill's
best effort, 140 feet 3 inches, would
have failed to place. This mark
still represented great improvement
over his first competitive toss of the
season of 129 feet against Modesto
