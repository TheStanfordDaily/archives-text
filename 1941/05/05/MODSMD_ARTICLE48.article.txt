Williams, Stanford's Southern Divi
sion cage champs roll into spring
practice today in (he Pavilion at
4:30 o'clock. Coach Everett Dean has
slated three four-day week ses
sions.
As usual early play will be lim
ited to fundamentals, but a little
later on Dean will go in strongly for
special individual floor work.

first-string are Pordy Anderson, Don
Burness, and Bill Cowden. Also
from last year's squad will be Ed
Voss, Fred Linari, and Jack Dana.
POLLARD HEADS FROSH
Jimmy Pollard, Coach Beeb Lee's
frosh standout, heads the yearling
contingent of Frank McCann, Bill
Hooper, Bones Halstead, and Hank
Hege. The tall Oakland center formed
the nucleus of last year's Papooses
and looks as if he may well fit into
a first-string job on the varsity.
The loss of Davidson and Williams
is the great problem of the hour for
mentor Dean. Williams' shooting
accuracy and Davidson's floor work
and defensive play will be sorely
missed.
Both were named on the All -
Coast teams as were Anderson, Cow
den, and Burness, the other three
first-string starters.
PSYCHOLOGY TESTS
After the fundamentals are well
under way, Dean is going to go into
psychology for a few reaction and
timing tests.
Scrimmaging will be held back
until next week, and the whole
practice season will be limited to
three weeks. Several men of the
frosh squad are out for spring foot
ball at this point and will not be
on hand for the practice.
