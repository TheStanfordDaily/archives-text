# Yearling Golfers Defeat S.F.J.C.
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh golfers continued
their winning ways last Saturday by
slapping down San Francisco Junior
College 24-3. Frank McCann's 71,
the best round of the the day, led the
Farm yearlings to victory.
Only Indians that encountered any
opposition from the Junior Collegers
were George Traphagen, No. 1 man,
and Jack Wilson, No. 2 man. Trap
hagen broke even, IY2-V2, while
Wilson dropped 1 point. In doubles,
the team of Traphagen and Wilson
was nicked by the S.F. squad for
another half point. Everyone else
on the Farm squad succeeded in
blanking the jaysees.
