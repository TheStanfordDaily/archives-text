# Speech Again
## 
### 
MRS. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT was making
speeches in the Pacific Northwest last
week, and she was talking about war and peace,
humanitarianism and relief for the Greeks.
And she was talking about Charles Lindbergh:
If she had a German medal, she said, "I would
have given it back a long time ago. What Colo
nel Lindbergh does with his medal is entirely
up to Colonel Lindbergh."
Now, there are several sides from which one
can attack Mrs. Roosevelt's allowing herself to
be so quoted, aside from the obvious criticism
of taste. She has permitted her writings and
talks to give off an aura of being interpretations
of the President's attitudes —off the record, you
understand, but close to the source. She has
assumed a status disturbingly official, she
speaks from it on subjects which some persons
feel, in her position, betray a lack of delicacy:
but after all that point is up to her.
The sides from which Mrs. Roosevelt's state
ments can be assailed have a greater signifi
cance in these times than a discussion of per
sonal tact.
First criticism concerns the unpolitic expres
sion of personal ill-will toward Hitler—and the
Germans who decorated the colonel—in view
of the fact that the President and the State De
partment are laboring to treat with diplomacy
even their sternest provisions.
The other is that Mr. Lindbergh or anyone
else who has endured the censure of the Presi
dent for violating desired sentiment in his testi
monies and speeches should never be subjected
to wrist-slappings or pursuit into personalities
carried on via the dignity of high office, even
second-hand.—J. C. G.
