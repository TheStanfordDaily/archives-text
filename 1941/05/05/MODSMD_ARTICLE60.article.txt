FROM under eyelids heavily weighted by four
days in Southern California, our editor will
try to glower at his week-end weary staff this
afternoon at 1:15. He will undoubtedly be a
little crushed to find out how well we did with
out him and will find it hard to reorient himself
to his native habitat. Edit Board will convene
at 1 o'clock within the inner confines of the dark
room so the drastic change will not be too much
for the editor's eyes. He will preside over After
noon Club in the Cellar and, while dazedly sip
ping his lemon coke, will still think himself back
at Earl Carroll's.—C. B.
