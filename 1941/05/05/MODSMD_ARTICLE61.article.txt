# Babies and Flags
## 
### 
TODAY begins National Baby Week.
For one whole week citizens of the United
States will consider babies. They will learn how
best to care for them, how to refrain from stick
ing them physically and bruising them spiri
tually. They will be taught to hold them in rev
erence, and they will buy a great many things
for them, assisted by merchants whose solici
tude exceeds—by only a scant margin—their
own.
May 12 is Hospital Day. All over the country
Americans will visit hospitals, learn first hand
what makes them tick, attempt to overcome
their fear of such institutions.
Citizenship Week starts May 12, too. Indefi
nite and therefore so much more stringent, the
demands upon American citizenship will be
eased by the interpretations of demagogues and
retailers and each person can have a chance
to be his brother's keeper.
Somewhere in the shuffle comes "I Am an
American Day."
Sunday is Mothers' Day, followed at a cour
teous interval by Fathers' Day.
There are probably a lot more.
It is fun to go beyond the commercialism, to
explore into our national psyche to see the
delight we feel in putting a finger on an attitude
and holding it there, so, until we know exactly
where we stand about everything that's funda
mental with us.
We astound outsiders with our self-examina
tions, with the glee with which we investigate
ourselves and the gravity and brevity with
which we consider the results of the profoundest
introspection. With innocence and the most dis
arming pleasure, we like to pose as we think

we are, and then hold it, please, until it is re
corded. Often we have begun to fidget before
the pose is over, but that is neither here nor
there.

There's nothing second-rate or indicative of
disease in America's looking so hard at herself.
Commercialized, yes; but these days and weeks
which we celebrate with such vigor are. the ex
pression of a nation pleased with itself and gaz
ing fondly at ideals which it has fostered so care
fully and which are, in formal expression today,
pretty rare.—J. C. G.
