skating, I understand, has swept over the
Stanford campus in a psychological tidal wave
that neither dignity nor timidity could withstand.
Merry bands of carefree youngsters skim the side
walks, taking pedestrians in their stride with the
nonchallance of a French aristocrat whose barouche
happened to knock off a couple of the peasantry. It is
a pleasant and peaceful scene, like something out of
a children's book. But it cannot last. It is only a
question of days now before Women's Conference de
cides to abolish roller skating on the grounds that it
has an undesirable influence on Stanford women.
The sport seems well entrenched. Laughing stu
dents haul themselves out of ditches. Bashful girls
evade the question of where it hurts. As The Daily
expressed it, "Parts of Stanford have gone hog-wild
on roller skates." But the neat, feminine handwriting
is on the wall, and at any time now it will be tran
scribed to the minute book.
* * * *
The whole thing is really none of my business. I
gave up skating at the age of eight, when I coasted
backwards down a flight of stone steps and ricocheted
off the sidewalk into a rosebush. But I feel that it is
only Christian charity to warn students who are con
templating investing in a pair of skates.
I realize also that on first examination roller skat
ing looks as innocent as a bed-time story. It involves
exercise, fresh air, sunshine, vitamins, and all the
other things that are supposed to be good for growing
bodies. It builds healthy mental attitudes; and it would
not be an overstatement to say that immorality on
roller skates would be practically impossible. Appar
ently it merges all the best principles of democracy,
psychiatry, and medicine.
* * * *
OUT considered from the Conference angle, skating
is revealed as a deadly menace. In the first place,
women skate; therefore the Conference has complete
jurisdiction over the sport. And observe the subtle
menace. A girl who skates cannot possibly expect to
maintain that standard of dignity and poise which we
wish Stanford to display to the world. The law of
averages says that she will spend at least part of the
time on her ear. Are we to permit visitors to the
campus to judge Stanford women by the on-their-ear
conduct of those few representatives they see about
the sidewalks?
More than that, the prospect of falling, or the fear
of seeing a friend take a bite out of the curb, would
undoubtedly have a nasty psychological effect on the
girls. Probably the freshmen would become hyster
ical. and that must be avoided at any price.
Clinching the argument is the symbolism of skat
ing. A girl on skates admittedly moves fast; that is a
simple matter of physics. And the first principle of the
social regulations is that a Stanford woman is never
fast.
It is obvious, then, where the duty of Conference
lies. And Conference does not shirk its duty.

OUT considered from the Conference angle, skating
is revealed as a deadly menace. In the first place,
women skate; therefore the Conference has complete
jurisdiction over the sport. And observe the subtle
menace. A girl who skates cannot possibly expect to
maintain that standard of dignity and poise which we
wish Stanford to display to the world. The law of
averages says that she will spend at least part of the
time on her ear. Are we to permit visitors to the
campus to judge Stanford women by the on-their-ear
conduct of those few representatives they see about
the sidewalks?
More than that, the prospect of falling, or the fear
of seeing a friend take a bite out of the curb, would
undoubtedly have a nasty psychological effect on the
girls. Probably the freshmen would become hyster
ical. and that must be avoided at any price.
Clinching the argument is the symbolism of skat
ing. A girl on skates admittedly moves fast; that is a
simple matter of physics. And the first principle of the
social regulations is that a Stanford woman is never
fast.
It is obvious, then, where the duty of Conference
lies. And Conference does not shirk its duty.
skating, I understand, has swept over the
Stanford campus in a psychological tidal wave
that neither dignity nor timidity could withstand.
Merry bands of carefree youngsters skim the side
walks, taking pedestrians in their stride with the
nonchallance of a French aristocrat whose barouche
happened to knock off a couple of the peasantry. It is
a pleasant and peaceful scene, like something out of
a children's book. But it cannot last. It is only a
question of days now before Women's Conference de
cides to abolish roller skating on the grounds that it
has an undesirable influence on Stanford women.
The sport seems well entrenched. Laughing stu
dents haul themselves out of ditches. Bashful girls
evade the question of where it hurts. As The Daily
expressed it, "Parts of Stanford have gone hog-wild
on roller skates." But the neat, feminine handwriting
is on the wall, and at any time now it will be tran
scribed to the minute book.
* * * *
The whole thing is really none of my business. I
gave up skating at the age of eight, when I coasted
backwards down a flight of stone steps and ricocheted
off the sidewalk into a rosebush. But I feel that it is
only Christian charity to warn students who are con
templating investing in a pair of skates.
I realize also that on first examination roller skat
ing looks as innocent as a bed-time story. It involves
exercise, fresh air, sunshine, vitamins, and all the
other things that are supposed to be good for growing
bodies. It builds healthy mental attitudes; and it would
not be an overstatement to say that immorality on
roller skates would be practically impossible. Appar
