T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
I, like millions of other wide-awake Americans,
admire and applaud Charles Lindbergh and will con
tinue doing so until he backs down (and I don't think
he will) on his brave attempt to keep America out of
war.
No one can blame the Lindberghs for going to Eng
land for peace and quiet in their sorrow after the kid
napping of their baby and the subsequent blaring
headlines and publicity in the typical American news
paper manner. Come now, you don't begrudge Roose
velt his fishing trips, do you?
On his return from Europe, he announced hon
estly (upon popular demand for information) that
Germany and Russia were well prepared for war. Be
cause, as typical Americans, we don't like to be in
formed that the Jones have a newer model car than
ours, some Americans labeled this warning (and it
has since been obviously proven as such) as un-
American. To the contrary, Mr. Angry, Lindbergh is
no Aaron Burr, but a veritable Paul Revere.
When Lindbergh, who is representing the minority
of public opinion, is silenced by the greatest democ
racy on earth, that democracy will cease to exist.
Read your Constitution, my boy.
Many of us, no doubt, would gladly see Roosevelt
hung to the nearest tree for sticking our necks across
the Atlantic Ocean, but we have to sit through his
speeches to see the latest Mickey Mouse cartoon. You
know, Lindbergh may be right and just because he
doesn't agree with our celebrated Mr. Roosevelt doesn't
make him wrong.
So pull in your horns, we'll be in the war in a
short time, you'll have your chance to show your
burning patriotism, but please, let's have none of that
pre-war hysteria of 1914—it's so out of date.
Wide Awake and Calm

r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
Instead of the old dog not learning new tricks of
staying out of war, it would seem that the new dog
has fallen for the old tricks. It's an old trick of
propaganda to make one feel alone in his thoughts—to
make him feel that he is going against the "tide of
public opinion."
The learned Dr. Gallup, L.D. (loaded dice), tells
that 68 per cent of the people want to go to war. And
Bud Ames points to Gallup's poll and says, "See,
everybody has fallen for that war propaganda again.
I guess we're lost."
Yes, this poll and that poll and most of the news
papers tell us that everybody is just straining to get
into war. Why then does the president give England
destroyers without consulting the people? Why does
he hold secret hearings on the lend-lease bill? Why
does he send "patrol" ships out into the mid-Atlantic
while avoiding a debate on the convoy issue in Con
gress? And remember when there was move to make
it possible to declare war only by a popular vote
how soon that move was quashed?
But. you say, the Gallup Poll says Never mind
the poll; I want to know whether this country is based
on rule by ballots or by Gallups.

racy on earth, that democracy will cease to exist.
Read your Constitution, my boy.
Many of us, no doubt, would gladly see Roosevelt
hung to the nearest tree for sticking our necks across
the Atlantic Ocean, but we have to sit through his
speeches to see the latest Mickey Mouse cartoon. You
know, Lindbergh may be right and just because he
doesn't agree with our celebrated Mr. Roosevelt doesn't
make him wrong.
So pull in your horns, we'll be in the war in a
short time, you'll have your chance to show your
burning patriotism, but please, let's have none of that
pre-war hysteria of 1914—it's so out of date.

r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
Instead of the old dog not learning new tricks of
staying out of war, it would seem that the new dog
has fallen for the old tricks. It's an old trick of
propaganda to make one feel alone in his thoughts—to
make him feel that he is going against the "tide of
public opinion."
The learned Dr. Gallup, L.D. (loaded dice), tells
that 68 per cent of the people want to go to war. And
Bud Ames points to Gallup's poll and says, "See,
everybody has fallen for that war propaganda again.
I guess we're lost."
Yes, this poll and that poll and most of the news
papers tell us that everybody is just straining to get
into war. Why then does the president give England
destroyers without consulting the people? Why does
he hold secret hearings on the lend-lease bill? Why
does he send "patrol" ships out into the mid-Atlantic
while avoiding a debate on the convoy issue in Con
gress? And remember when there was move to make
it possible to declare war only by a popular vote
how soon that move was quashed?
But. you say, the Gallup Poll says Never mind
the poll; I want to know whether this country is based
on rule by ballots or by Gallups.

T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
I, like millions of other wide-awake Americans,
admire and applaud Charles Lindbergh and will con
tinue doing so until he backs down (and I don't think
he will) on his brave attempt to keep America out of
war.
No one can blame the Lindberghs for going to Eng
land for peace and quiet in their sorrow after the kid
napping of their baby and the subsequent blaring
headlines and publicity in the typical American news
paper manner. Come now, you don't begrudge Roose
velt his fishing trips, do you?
On his return from Europe, he announced hon
estly (upon popular demand for information) that
Germany and Russia were well prepared for war. Be
cause, as typical Americans, we don't like to be in
formed that the Jones have a newer model car than
ours, some Americans labeled this warning (and it
has since been obviously proven as such) as un-
American. To the contrary, Mr. Angry, Lindbergh is
no Aaron Burr, but a veritable Paul Revere.
When Lindbergh, who is representing the minority
of public opinion, is silenced by the greatest democ
racy on earth, that democracy will cease to exist.
