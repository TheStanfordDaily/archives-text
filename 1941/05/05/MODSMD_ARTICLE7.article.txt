### 
From plans already drawn up, the
aquacade and water show being held
in conjunction with the University's
50th Anniversary celebrations will
be the high point of Stanford's
Spring Quarter. The aquacade is to
be held on the evening of May 14,
at Lake Lagunita.

Committee heads announced are
Anne Killefer, formation swimming;
Baldy Wilson, lighting; Bob Breck
ner, parade; and Harry Muheim,
show director. Alastair McDonald
and Shorty Grannis are general
chairmen for the event.
A complete evening's entertain
ment is scheduled, with a parade of
floats on the lake, all in keeping
with the Farm's 50th year celebra
tion, preceding the water show.
GESTRING TO DIVE
Following the parade, spectators
will be treated to a display of high

tring, champion high and low diver,
and Howie Adams, former Pacific
Coast Conference diving champion.
Formation swimming by eight
men and eight women, wearing
fluorescent suits, is also on the pro
gram .
Special races are to be held, with
prizes for the winners to be donated
by Palo Alto merchants.
MUHEIM SKIT
On a revolving stage, a corhedy
skit, written and directed by Harry
Muheim, this year's Gaieties author,
will be presented. The title has not
been decided upon, but the skit will
involve some well known faculty
members.
The master of ceremony's job will
be handled by some well known
campus figure from a special plat
form on the lake. A loud speaker
system will be installed, carrying to
every vantage point.
The program is scheduled to be

day, May 14, and no admission will
be charged.
