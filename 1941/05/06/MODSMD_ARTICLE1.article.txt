| IKE a lighted fuso sputtering its
way closer and closer to a keg
of TNT, the incidents of the "little
war" in Iraq yesterday grew in both
scope and intensity. Tip-ofl to the
danger in the situation came when
the former Grand Mufti of Jerusa
lem, who was exiled to Bagdad for
his activities during the last anti-
Jewish uprising in Palestine, pro
claimed the affair a "Holy War"
against (he infidel British.
Both Turkey and Egypt (who
have the most to lose) are grow
ing their Moslem influence into the
balance in a desperate effort to bring
the British and Rashid Ali Ben Gai
lani's pro-Axis government into
some sort of accord. Chances of a
satisfactory compromise appear slim,
however, since the British are not
going to get out of Iraq if they can
help it. Not only do (hey need (he
Mosul oil, (hey must have some way
of getting at Turkey and Syria in the
event hostilities break out there.
If the British forces find il nec
essary to sabotage the Mosul fields
and pipe line, in order to keep
them from falling into Iraqi and
eventually into German hands,
their own fuel problem is going to
be immensely complicated. But not
as quickly as the alarmists would
have you to believe; because the
oil, which travels through the great
pipe from Kirkuk in Iraq, through
Trans-Jordan, and eventually
comes to Haifa in Palestine, is
crude.
The British have large stores of
refined oil in Palestine—enough to
keep the Mediterranean fleet in op
eration for some time. But in (he
long run, the loss will be felt, and
here again it will be up to the
United States to make up the dif
ference.

agents are doing their
9 utmost to keep the Mesopota
mian revolt boiling, and there are
vague rumors that Nazi planes are
helping the Iraqi. (British commu
niques haven't mentioned this.) This
hint comes from Budapest, as did
the reports that the beleaguered
Habbaniya air base has fallen, that
Basra is completely surrounded, and
that British Imperial troops are de
serting to the Iraqi.
Budapest news reports are un
der Joseph Goebbel's propaganda
wise thumb, and it's safe to as
sume that the reports are designed
more to stir up trouble than state
what has actually happened. The
Ilabbaniya and Basra rumors are
probably untrue, since British
forces in Iraq are better trained
and far better equipped than the
Iraq army. They already have
complete control of the air, and
yesterday's communique an
nounced that an armored column
had dashed 370 miles up the Eu
phrates valley to relieve Habba
niya.
In the matter of official announce
ments, the only German ones you
can believe are those issued by (he
High Command. If they make a
positive statement, you can depend
on it according to the Washington
experts who've been studying the
problem since September '39. The
rest of (he Nazi advices follow pretty
much of a "tru(h be damned" policy.

Vichy (which has now nosed
out even Budapest as Europe's
official rumor center — this inciden
tally is a big achievement) comes
further murmurings on (he big troop
concentrations on both sides of Rus
sia's European border. All this fuss
is leading to something.
And don't be surprised if it's a
new Nazi-Soviet deal. The show
of force by both parties concerned
may be part of the diplomatic
jockeying. Stalin's every move in
idcates his mortal fear of Hitler,
and there's a rumor making the
rounds that Hitler swore he'd get
the Ukraine—as soon as he finds
time—on the day that the Soviets
grabbed off part of Bukovina and
the Dohruja.
Comrade Stalin gains time every
time he makes a deal to his benefit.
This one would probably give him
joint occupation of the Dardanelles
with Turkey and an outlet to the
Atlantic through northern Scandina
via. As long as he strings along, he's
doing himself no immediate harm.
