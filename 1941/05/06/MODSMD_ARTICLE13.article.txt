With active American participation, can Great Britain defeat
Germany?
"No," argues Lindbergh. "America, stop being afraid," shouts
Willkie. Charges and counter-charges fly, bewildering the Ameri
can public.
Stanford students are as confused as the rest of the 130,000,000
Americans. Of those students with definite opinions, 57 per cent
believe that with American aid, England can win the war; but
43 per cent disagree.
However, almost one-fourth of the cross-section interviewed
by The Daily was undecided on this question. Including these
"undecided students" only 44 per cent think England can defeat
Germany with America's entrance into the war; 32 per cent say
"no," and 24 per cent are undecided.
A second question asked was, "Should America declare war
against Germany NOW?" "No," shout 84 per cent of the cross
section. "Yes," anawer 10 per cent, and 6 per cent are undecided.
Men and women are of about the same opinion on this ques
tion, although more women are undecided.
However, men and women are of much different opinion on
whether or not Great Britain can defeat Germany with the aid of
American soldiers. Tabulations are as follows:
Yes No Undecided
Men 60% 23% 17%
Women 37% 36% 27%
Freshmen and sophomores are much more optimistic of Amer
ica's strength than are the upperclassmen. Graduate men and
women, however, are almost evenly divided on this question.
Commenting on this issue, a junior Row man said, "If we help
Britain now, we will become History's A-l sucker, because even
if we want to, we cannot whip Germany."
A junior woman explained, "I believe Great Britain can defeat
Germany without active American participation." Another said,
"To win the war, England must conquer the entire European con
tinent and this is impossible, even with American men."
