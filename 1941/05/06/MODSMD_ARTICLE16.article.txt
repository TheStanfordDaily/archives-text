# Quad to Make Debut in May
## Seniors Spotlighted In Shots, Spreads 
### 
In approximately three weeks the
50th anniversary edition of the Stan
ford Quad will be ready for distri
bution. The editorial staff, headed by
Chuck Runacres, are all tied up now
in adding the final touches to what,
from all previews, promises to be a
real celebration.

Since the book belongs primarily
to the seniors special emphasis has
been laid on the Class of '41. There
are more shots of prominent seniors
and there are several spreads fea
turing candids of seniors in groups
or alone. Also, the candids are
larger and clearer this year.
CANDIDS ENLARGED
The spreads of candids of promi
nent members of the other classes
have been enlarged and the layouts
are something "new and different."
As a part of the anniversary
theme of the book, the section de
voted to living groups carries out
the past and present idea. The
groups thought back and un
earthed traditions which have been
photographed. To illustrate, there arc
shots of the S.A.E.'s serenade, the
Breakers' water fights, etc.
FOOTBALL REVAMPED
The football "section has been en
tirely revamped. The pictures start
out with the boys turning out for
practice, the training antics they go
through, the players gathered around
the training table. All this works up
through pages of lithographs and
shots of the games to the grand cli
max of the Rose Bowl. It is a pic
torial history of the Indian machine
on its triumphant march to the
Pasadena Rose Bowl on New Year's
Day.
These constitute a few of the high
lights of the 1941 Quad and the edi
toiral staff is justly proud of it as
more and more page proofs pour
down from the city. The rest of the
campus will be proud, too, when the
finished product makes its debut
during the last week of May.
