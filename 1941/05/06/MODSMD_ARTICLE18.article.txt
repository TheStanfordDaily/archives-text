WASHINGTON, May . r » (UP)- —
President Roosevelt tonight demand
ed aerial supremacy for the democ
racies and called upon Secretary of
War Henry L. Stimson to increase
produciton of heavy bombers "with
all possible speed."
"... Command of the air by the
democracies must and can be
achieved," Mr. Roosevelt said in a
letter to Stimson. "Every month the
democracies are gaining in the rela
tive strength of their air forces. We
must see to it that the process is
hastened and that the democratic
superiority in the air be made ab
solute."
The President did not specify by
what ratio he was ordering heavy
bomber production speeded up. But
he left no doubt that the objective
he has fixed will strain this country's
production facilities to their utmost.
The President told Stimson he was
ordering the Office of Production
Management to provide "appro
priate" priority ratings to clear the
way for all-out production.
His letter left no doubt that the
Axis aerial challenge must be met
in kind and bettered.
"The effective defense of this
country and the vital defense of
other democratic nations requires
that there be a substantial increase
in heavy bomber production," he
wrote. "To this end will you take
whatever action is needed, including
the procurement of aircraft, to ob
tain substantially the production rate
which I am indicating to you in a
private memorandum."
