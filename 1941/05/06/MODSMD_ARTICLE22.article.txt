# Defense Use Of Klystron Held Secret
## Engineering Students Carry on Research In Farm Laboratory 
### MIKE KRESGE 
Klystron . . . from the Greek,
meaning the breaking of waves on
a beach.
Such is the name of Stanford's
most recent outstanding contribution
to the world of science and the na
tional defense program. It gets its,
name from the Greek in that the
flow of electrons in the tube pile up
in a bunch in the same manner.
The Klystron, in case you didn't
already know, is an invention which
i nables an airplane or ship to deter
mine the distance of any obstacle
which may be in front of it, pro
vides a blind landing beam for air
planes, and is capable of sending
100,000 simultaneous telephone con
versations through a hollow six
inch pipe. Its use in defense work is
even more astounding, but because
i hat is a government secret, no in
formation can be released.
INVENTED AT STANEOKD
It was invented and developed
here at Stanford by the Varian
brothers, Sigurd and Russell, with
the assistance of Or. David L. Web
ster and Dr. William Hansen of the
physics department. The Varians are
no longer connected with the Uni
versity and are now in the East
working with the Sperry Gyroscope
company, who have the University's
license, under the patents, to manu
facture the Klystron. The Sperry
people have also spent to date in
excess of $60,000 for research and
further development of the tube
here on the campus.
Research at present is being car
ried on in three different places. A
group of nine students under the
supervision of the electrical engi
neering department are carrying on
work in wave measurement; one
group working in the physics de
partment, another at the Ryan Lab,
and the third in the radio communi
cations laboratory. The group will
carry on their work throughout the
summer also.

This reporter being assigned to in
vestigate further Klystron develop
ments went over to consult with
nial Professor Terman of the Elec
trical Engineering Department. But
it seems that due to recent wide
spread publicity, anyone seeking in
formation on the subject or, for that
matter, anyone working with it must
be investigated by the Federal Bu
reau of Investigation. We let the
matter drop!
In the course of our investigation
(as far as it went) we did manage
to steal a glimpse at one of the fabled
Klystrons—a 40-millimeter one, so
they told us. The invention re
sembled one of those gadgets that
one sees in "Buck Rogers" or "Su
perman" in the funny papers. Only
no death ray came forth, merely a
loud steady buzz. We imagined that
the noise was the electrons breaking
on the ? (they wouldn't tell me, G-
Men, you know).

INVENTED AT STANEOKD
It was invented and developed
here at Stanford by the Varian
brothers, Sigurd and Russell, with
the assistance of Or. David L. Web
ster and Dr. William Hansen of the
physics department. The Varians are
no longer connected with the Uni
versity and are now in the East
working with the Sperry Gyroscope
company, who have the University's
license, under the patents, to manu
facture the Klystron. The Sperry
people have also spent to date in
excess of $60,000 for research and
further development of the tube
here on the campus.
Research at present is being car
ried on in three different places. A
group of nine students under the
supervision of the electrical engi
neering department are carrying on
work in wave measurement; one
group working in the physics de
partment, another at the Ryan Lab,
and the third in the radio communi
cations laboratory. The group will
carry on their work throughout the
summer also.

This reporter being assigned to in
vestigate further Klystron develop
ments went over to consult with
nial Professor Terman of the Elec
trical Engineering Department. But
it seems that due to recent wide
spread publicity, anyone seeking in
formation on the subject or, for that
matter, anyone working with it must
be investigated by the Federal Bu
reau of Investigation. We let the
matter drop!
In the course of our investigation
(as far as it went) we did manage
to steal a glimpse at one of the fabled
Klystrons—a 40-millimeter one, so
they told us. The invention re
sembled one of those gadgets that
one sees in "Buck Rogers" or "Su
perman" in the funny papers. Only
no death ray came forth, merely a
loud steady buzz. We imagined that
the noise was the electrons breaking
on the ? (they wouldn't tell me, G-
Men, you know).
Klystron . . . from the Greek,
meaning the breaking of waves on
a beach.
Such is the name of Stanford's
most recent outstanding contribution
to the world of science and the na
tional defense program. It gets its,
name from the Greek in that the
flow of electrons in the tube pile up
in a bunch in the same manner.
The Klystron, in case you didn't
already know, is an invention which
i nables an airplane or ship to deter
mine the distance of any obstacle
which may be in front of it, pro
vides a blind landing beam for air
planes, and is capable of sending
100,000 simultaneous telephone con
versations through a hollow six
inch pipe. Its use in defense work is
even more astounding, but because
i hat is a government secret, no in
formation can be released.
