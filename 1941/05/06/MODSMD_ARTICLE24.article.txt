# Bad Weather Holds Up Work On Campus Roads, Drain Pipe
## 
### 
With workmen delayed hy the inclement weather of last week, the
work along Santa Teresa Street is still behind schedule. Mud and soft
ground have also interfered with the laying of the new drainage pipe from
I.agunita down to the regular sewage and drainage lines.
The new cast iron drainage pipe replaces the old iron pipe which was
laid over 20 years ago. The

pipe is 12 inches in diameter and
when installed will take care of any
possible overflow from the lake.
Construction will begin shortly on
the safety island, which will divide
Santa Teresa into two lanes behind
the Post Office. In this way traffic
will be re-routed with cars coming
[ from the women's dormitories get
ting on to Lasuen by going around
the post office.
Cars coming up from the Quad
and turning right at the post office
will be allowed. In this way the
congestion centering around the post
office will be alleviated by making
Santa Teresa a one-way street
around the post office.
An eight-foot sidewalk along
Santa Teresa on the west side is to
be put in as soon as the pavement
is laid. Santa Teresa will be closed
to traffic during the day but will be
open for cars after 5 o'clock.
Concrete curbing has now been
laid the length of Lomita Drive. A
sidewalk the length of the Drive will
be put in as soon as the new paving
has been poured. New streetlights
will be erected, with an electric
warning signal to be put up on the
safety island zone. New direction
signs will also be put up.
