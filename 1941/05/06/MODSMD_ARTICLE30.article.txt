A large group of 1 acuity members
and their wives took advantage of
the invitation of the Hoover Library
directors to view the lobby and bel
fry of the completed structure last
Friday afternoon.
Assistant university organist Her

visitors the workings of the carillon
and the weather was fairly clear SO
that a good view of the surrounding
territory was possible.

fessor Ralph H. Lutz, stated that as
soon as possible the library will hold
an open house for students so they
may inspect the building and (he bell
