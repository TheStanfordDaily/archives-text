# Cindermen Work For Troy Meet
## 
### 
Witli (lit' track season approaching
its Fresno Relays peak, Stanford's
Indians worked out yesterday under
lilue skies.
Angell Field was crowded with
runners, varsity, irosh and intra
mural; and of course Harry Jackson,
the Olympic Club's â€¢hard-working
captain was there. Harry, whose
team won the P.A. meet Saturday,
heat Gene Kern in a flight of lows.
Ernie Clark is getting into fine
shape and may be ready for his best
effort against U.S.C. this week-end.
TROJANS HAVE POWER
Those Terrible Trojans will be up
here Saturday with power and bal
ance. Dean Cromwell did his big
job of the year when he beat Cali
fornia; but the S.C. boys are not
beyond their peak by any means.
Take Leroy Weed, for instance. He
got a slow start this season and is
only beginning to get going.
With Kerns, Bourland, Smith, and
Weed, the Trojans will get their
share of points on the track; and
Peoples, Wilson, Merritt, and Schae
fer are rarely beaten on the field.
FRESNO RELAYS COMINO
Although the S.C.-Stanford dual
meet holds the local spotlight, the
entire coast is looking forward to the
annual West Coast Relays at Fresno,
a week from Saturday. All kinds of
marks will be threatened when Cal
swings into action on the two-mile
and medley relay. The Trojans will
give trouble down there, as will
Stanford and Fresno State. The
host Bulldogs offer Madrid and the
Cazares brothers, the best collection
of distance men on the Coast.
Ed Hertel is still battling sinus
trouble. If he can shake it and start
getting in shape, he may be able to
win points in the Conference meet;
but Ed has not worked since the
Big Meet and will probably not be
out for at least another week.
No one is giving Warren Smith
the 880 Saturday. Blair Hyde, one
ol the smoothest middle distance
runners on the Coast, has gotten the
best of a game leg and should be
ready for his big race Saturday. He's
had tough luck with a combination
cramp and pulled muscle which
kept him on the shelf for a couple
of weeks. Like Ray Malott, Blair
runs smoothly with a minimum of
arm-thrashing and head wavint?.
