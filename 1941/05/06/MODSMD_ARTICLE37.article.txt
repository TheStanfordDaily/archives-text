football season for the Stanford Indians still 23 weeks away, we're
already getting a little anxious to know just how Albert, Taylor,
et al. are going to make out in their second year under Clark Shaugh
nessy.
One thing is certain: the Indians can't turn in a better seasonal record
this coming fall than they did last year. A guy just can't bat better than
1.000. Bt't certainly is a lot of room to go in the other direction
—down.
However, in view of the type of football that the Stanfords played last
year and the way Coach Shaughnessy handled his men, it doesn't seem
likely that the Indians are going go very far in that undesirable direction.
With a few prominent exceptions, the team is going to have most of
the regulars back from the Rose Bowl outfit. But those exceptions are
men whose shoes are apt to be exceedingly hard to fill.
* Jjt * $
r Hugh Gallarneau, for instance. His speed, his drive, his pass
catching—all these things and mote were essential to the success of
Stanford's great eleven. Replacing him is going to be more than a slight
task.
So far Coach Shaughnessy has Eric Armstrong, who spelled Gallar
neau most of the time last season, running with what might be called his
"A" squad for lack of a better name. Then, too, there is Bobby Ditlevson,
the made-over end. The dark-horse among the candidates for the right
half job is Randall "Buck" Fawcett, who played fullback on Harry Ship
key's - undefeated frosh eleven last season.
The other two regulars from the team that roared through the confer
ence in one of the most story-book comebacks in football are Norm "Chief"
Standlee and Stan Graff. And filling the vacancies left by that pair is going
to be far from an easy job.
* * * *
VUCINICH, Bob Crane, and Willard Sheller are all battling for
the fullback berth, with Vucinich leading the pack by a stride. Am
Meiners and Hank Norberg are the most prominent candidates for the
left end spot. Meiners was a reserve last season and played quite a bit of
ball toward the latter part of (he year, but Norberg was out for most of
the season with injuries. If he can escape the injury bugaboo that has
plagued him since his high school days there is every reason to believe
that Norberg will develop into an exceptionally good end, for he has all
the physical requisites plus the spirit that goes to make great football
players.

—down.
However, in view of the type of football that the Stanfords played last
year and the way Coach Shaughnessy handled his men, it doesn't seem
likely that the Indians are going go very far in that undesirable direction.
With a few prominent exceptions, the team is going to have most of
the regulars back from the Rose Bowl outfit. But those exceptions are
men whose shoes are apt to be exceedingly hard to fill.

r Hugh Gallarneau, for instance. His speed, his drive, his pass
catching—all these things and mote were essential to the success of
Stanford's great eleven. Replacing him is going to be more than a slight
task.
So far Coach Shaughnessy has Eric Armstrong, who spelled Gallar
neau most of the time last season, running with what might be called his
"A" squad for lack of a better name. Then, too, there is Bobby Ditlevson,
the made-over end. The dark-horse among the candidates for the right
half job is Randall "Buck" Fawcett, who played fullback on Harry Ship
key's - undefeated frosh eleven last season.
The other two regulars from the team that roared through the confer
ence in one of the most story-book comebacks in football are Norm "Chief"
Standlee and Stan Graff. And filling the vacancies left by that pair is going
to be far from an easy job.

VUCINICH, Bob Crane, and Willard Sheller are all battling for
the fullback berth, with Vucinich leading the pack by a stride. Am
Meiners and Hank Norberg are the most prominent candidates for the
left end spot. Meiners was a reserve last season and played quite a bit of
ball toward the latter part of (he year, but Norberg was out for most of
the season with injuries. If he can escape the injury bugaboo that has
plagued him since his high school days there is every reason to believe
that Norberg will develop into an exceptionally good end, for he has all
the physical requisites plus the spirit that goes to make great football
players.
football season for the Stanford Indians still 23 weeks away, we're
already getting a little anxious to know just how Albert, Taylor,
et al. are going to make out in their second year under Clark Shaugh
nessy.
One thing is certain: the Indians can't turn in a better seasonal record
this coming fall than they did last year. A guy just can't bat better than
1.000. Bt't certainly is a lot of room to go in the other direction
—down.
