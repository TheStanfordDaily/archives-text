# Albert's Kicks Highlight Fast Football Drill
## 
### 
Little Frankie Albert went in for
seme long range kicking yesterday
â€” five of last year's All-American
i quarterback's beets cleared the green
fence that surrounds the drill field
which is close to 75 yards.
Headman'Clark Shaughnessy sent
his first squad through their paces
for some movie photogs for half an
hour. Followed a short fundamentals
! warm-up of about 10 minutes.
A dummy scrimmage came next
! with two teams running through
J plays with plenty of zip. In the first
backfield were Albert, Pete Kmeto
vic, Milt Vucinich, and Eric Arm
strong. Making up the second four
were Ray Hammett, out yesterday
for the first time, Bob Ditlevson, A1
Cole, and John Barkley.
Of the new men, Willard Sheller
got off some nice kicks in the punt
ing drill, last act of the day. Bob
Crane also slapped a couple of long
ones toward the fence.
With the offensive T-workings
! getting smoother and smoother, ac
tual scrimmaging may be on deck by
tomorrow or Thursday.
