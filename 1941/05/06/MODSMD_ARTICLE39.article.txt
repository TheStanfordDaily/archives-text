# Card Manager Still Worried

NEW YORK, May 5 (UP). —It
hardly seems possible that the man
ager of a team that is riding the top
of the National League on the crest
of a 10-game winning streak would
be groaning at his ill luck but Billy
South worth was a sorely-tried man
Monday.
His St. Louis Cardinals defeated
the Boston Braves, 5-1, behind the
five-hit pitching of Rookie Ernie
White and there, in one bundle, is
South worth's trouble—pitching—too
good and too much of it.
As the Cardinals' pitching stafT
now stands it numbers 11 men—five
rookies and six veterans. All have
pitched well except the veteran Bill
McGee. If Southworth is to get
within the league player limit he
will have to trim two men from his
mound corps by May 15, the dead
line. But he can't decide which two
must go.
The finger points to McGee, only
starting pitcher without a victory,
but the 28-year-old righthander won
16 games last year and should
straighten out. The other veterans,
Lon Warneke and Mort Cooper, have
won three each and Max Lanier, two.
