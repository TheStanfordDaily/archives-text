# Crew Recovers from Bruin Loss; To Meet Sacramento
## 
### 
A tired and much-travelled crew will resume practice today for its
racu with Sacramento J. C., which is to take place at Sacramento 011
Saturday.
One of the few compensations that the crew can glimn from the bad
heating it took at the hands of the Bruin carsnun is that the U.C.L.A. crew

rowed the fastest two thousand
meters in its rowing history, going
over the course in 5 min. 59 sec.
Stanford followed 29 seconds later,
and collapsed quietly in a heap, but
its time of G min. 28 sec., was the
fastest ever rowed by the crew.
Rowing a 38 stroke for most of the
course, and at times hitting 40, the
Bruins' smoother and more powerful
stroke was too much for the ragged
3(5 stroke the Stanford crew rowed
the entire race. The farm oarsmen's
poor slidework dropped them behind
right from the beginning ol' the race,
and Ihey never settled down enough
to really row with any power.
Three time trials are to be rowed
this week in preparation for the
Sacramento race, when the crew will
try to row a higher rate with more
boat control. Lee Peake has now re
covered from his illness, and will
take his place in the boat again.
Coaches Nemo Pedersen and Kirk
Smith will probably make several
changes in the order for next week's
race.
