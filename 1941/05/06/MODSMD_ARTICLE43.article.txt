Shine up your shillalahs, grab a
handful of fairly spherical gutta
percha and pay a visit to the Stan
lord Golf Club this week. The oc
casion is the Stanford school cham
pionship.
This week ;ill entrants must play
â–  two rounds of 18 holes each for their
qualifying scores. The low 1G ag
gregate totals determine the quali
fiers lor the match play champion
ship to bo held the following two
weeks. May 10 is the qualifying
; deadline, and the 36-hole final will
be staged on Saturday, May 24.
Pacific Coast Champ Bud Brown
ell is the logical favorite for the
title. Bud's 54-hole aggregate of 220
led three-quarters of the pros in the
| California State Open held at Fresno
j last week-end. However, out of the
j 1G qualifiers there will be at least
nine golfers potentially capable of
j stealing the crown vacated by the
graduated ar.d absent Donald P.
Kennedy.
Arrange for your starting times
immediately and take a crack at a
very important title. The Stanford
champion this year will own a crown
| practically as significant as the
| championship of the Pacific Coast.
