# Newsbeat...1941

THE first fellow on the Quad wonders why
you don't turn over the front and edit pages
of The Daily to the national and international
dog-fight to the exclusion of all else. The next
rakes you over the coals for running more than
a modicum of world news and comment in a
campus newspaper.
Just casual proof that you can't please some
of the people a lot of the time.
The Daily, and I hold much to its credit, has
always been of the belief that a campus news
paper primarily belongs in the undergraduate
news field. For that reason The Daily prints
and will continue to print the news of the Farm
predominantly.
But we are faced with news conditions of a
most unusual nature, both on the national and
world news fronts. The wailing banshee of the
"-ism" is sweeping over Europe, while here in
our own country conditions are reverting back
to 1916 and '17.
For these reasons The Daily prints and will
continue to print news of the world predomi
nantly.
