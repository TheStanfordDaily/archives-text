# House Warming Today
## 
### 
THE A.S.S.U. waif, the Farm's lost-and-found
problem, will be tucked into a new pair of
three-cornered trousers today as the new cen
tralized department officially opens its doors
for business.
Created by The Daily, sanctioned by admin
istration and student leaders, and passed by a
unanimous Excom vote during last week's meet
ing, the lost-and-found department moves into
its new quarters at the Co-op Bookstore offices
with full plans for its working wrapped with it.
Collection of lost and found articles from the
former four official and 32 unofficial bureaus
will commence today, as the tremendous task
of molding the old slap-hazard structure into
workable shape begins. Complete storage space
has been provided in the Co-op offices, and a
fool-proof identification system has been de
vised.
It's been hanging fire for years. Thank gosh
the 'fuse has finally been lit.
