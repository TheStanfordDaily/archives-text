# To Meet, To Speak
## 
### 
CORNERSTONE of Democracy, for which we
fought in 1917 and for which we are fight
ing now, is the intrinsic right to meet and to
speak as we see fit.
So liberal has been our Democracy that Nazis
were even permitted to found Bund camps in
New England. So liberal has been our De
mocracy that Nazi and Fascist organizations have
printed and circulated reams of "white paper"
propaganda throughout the United States. They
have met and spoken as they saw fit.
Nazis and Fascists, yes. Americans, no.
Corrosive to Democracy's cornerstone was the
news from Florida printed in a recent issue of
the Chronicle which read, verbatim, as follows:
"An America First Committee rally sched
uled tonight was blocked by the refusal of city
and county authorities to allow the use of
public meeting places.
"The refusal was accompanied by the
charge that the America First Committee is a
subversive organization BECAUSE the views
it holds on American entry into the European
war are contrary to 'national policy'."
Has America actually come to this point?

Have we contracted so severe a case of war
fever that we no longer permit Americans, who
believe in America first and a chilly isolationist
policy, the right to meet and to speak what is
in their hearts and their minds?
This is still a Democracy, is it not?
Or are we "in so deep" that Washington and
the national policy are to dictate our hearts and
minds?
Right or wrong, good or bad, false or true,
Americans must continue to enjoy the rights of
Americans, those of meeting where one will, of
speaking what one will at all times. It is difficult
to fight for Democracy—which entails the rights
of freedom of action and speech—when that
Democracy denies you those intrinsic rights.—

AT the beginning of last fall quarter, the Stan
ford Bookstore distributed to all its pur
chasers a manila envelope with the following
phrase printed at the top:
"Stanford Bookstore Profit Sharing Envelope."
This envelope was for keeping all the little
orange cash register receipts received with
Bookstore purchases.
And since the Bookstore is a co-operative or
ganization, the time has come when all who
have saved their receipts should turn them in
to take advantage of the annual rebates.
May 15 is the deadline for turning in the en
velopes, filled out as requested, with receipts
enclosed.

You will receive your check before the end
of the quarter.—C. B.

"The refusal was accompanied by the
charge that the America First Committee is a
subversive organization BECAUSE the views
it holds on American entry into the European
war are contrary to 'national policy'."
Has America actually come to this point?

Have we contracted so severe a case of war
fever that we no longer permit Americans, who
believe in America first and a chilly isolationist
policy, the right to meet and to speak what is
in their hearts and their minds?
This is still a Democracy, is it not?
Or are we "in so deep" that Washington and
the national policy are to dictate our hearts and
minds?
Right or wrong, good or bad, false or true,
Americans must continue to enjoy the rights of
Americans, those of meeting where one will, of
speaking what one will at all times. It is difficult
to fight for Democracy—which entails the rights
of freedom of action and speech—when that
Democracy denies you those intrinsic rights.—

AT the beginning of last fall quarter, the Stan
ford Bookstore distributed to all its pur
chasers a manila envelope with the following
phrase printed at the top:
"Stanford Bookstore Profit Sharing Envelope."
This envelope was for keeping all the little
orange cash register receipts received with
Bookstore purchases.
And since the Bookstore is a co-operative or
ganization, the time has come when all who
have saved their receipts should turn them in
to take advantage of the annual rebates.
May 15 is the deadline for turning in the en
velopes, filled out as requested, with receipts
enclosed.

You will receive your check before the end
of the quarter.—C. B.
CORNERSTONE of Democracy, for which we
fought in 1917 and for which we are fight
ing now, is the intrinsic right to meet and to
speak as we see fit.
So liberal has been our Democracy that Nazis
were even permitted to found Bund camps in
New England. So liberal has been our De
mocracy that Nazi and Fascist organizations have
printed and circulated reams of "white paper"
propaganda throughout the United States. They
have met and spoken as they saw fit.
Nazis and Fascists, yes. Americans, no.
Corrosive to Democracy's cornerstone was the
news from Florida printed in a recent issue of
the Chronicle which read, verbatim, as follows:
"An America First Committee rally sched
uled tonight was blocked by the refusal of city
and county authorities to allow the use of
public meeting places.
"The refusal was accompanied by the
charge that the America First Committee is a
