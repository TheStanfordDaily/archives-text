# BULL SESSION
## THE 						PROPAGANDA MACHINE 
### JERRY MAYER 
J) ID you know that the war-mongers who are at
tempting to involve the United States even more
deeply in the European war than it now is have tapped
a hitherto unutilized source of propaganda?
I didn't realize it myself until one night recently
while having a bite to eat at the Whoopee Shop. Some
one plugged the juke-box with a phony nickel and
the strains of ''My Sister and I" floated melodiously
into the hamburger-filled room. It was Benny Good
man (B.G. to those who are familiar with the esoteric
mysteries of the swing fraternity) with Helen Forrest
on the vocal.
I tapped my toe, keeping time to the music as
closely as a tone-deaf person (as evaluated by tests
in Psych 51) can, when one of my companions de
ployed a derisive snort. "I can't stand this song," he
said. "It's propaganda."

A® OFTEN as I had heard the tune I had never
listened to the words. All I can remember now
is that there is something about Dutch friends and
sailing away. There's also a line that runs: "But we
don't talk about that." I listened closely then, and
although I'm a registered Democrat and adhere fairly
closely to the party line I can't say that the song made
me want to run down the street with a gun in my
hand looking for an enemy of democracy.
The most exercise that the tune elicited was a
gentle off-time tapping of my foot.
I was informed that "The Last Time I Saw Paris"
was also absolute propaganda. I had thought perhaps
it had an allusion to the German occupation of Paris.
But even though I liked the song so well that I bought
a record of it and played it constantly I never thought
very much about the fact that I was obviously being
a victim of subtle, subversive influences.
In fact, when I heard how I had been duped I
nearly threw the record away. No one is going to
make a fool out of me. The only trouble was that the
record cost 35 cents, so I decided against its de
struction.

DUT I'm wise now. Any juke-box that contains
cither "My Sister and I" or "The Last Time I Saw
Paris" I will refuse to patronize. Why should I waste
lead slugs on underhanded propaganda?
After all, I'm a college student and supposedly in
possession of a normal degree of intelligence. Nobody
is going to make me a tool of interventionist influ
ences. I'm going to think this problem out for my
self ,and no one is going to rush me into this war on
the end of a sweet lick from B.G.'s clarinet.
Things are really in a mess when even the juke
boxes are agents of the British cause.
Incidentally, Dick Jurgens' recording of "The Last
Time I Saw Paris" is a sweet disk.
