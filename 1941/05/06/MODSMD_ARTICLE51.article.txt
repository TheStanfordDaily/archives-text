# CAMPUS OPINION
## LINDBERGH AGAIN 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
I began with the intention of answering Mon
day's letters, but, being struck again by the unanswer
ableness of the clear, cold logic of Mr. John Wey
mouth's last two letters, I shall answer "Wide Awakes"
alone. This gentleman is at least wide awake enough
to know that we shall presently be in war, but he can
still applaud Lindbergh.
Is he awake enough to realize where we would be
if Lindbergh had his way? We would be another na
tion that waited too late—for Lindbergh is wrong
—we are not strong enough to fight 500,000.000 people,
militarily or economically, alone and we would not
submit to slavery—so we should perish in far greater
nurr\bers than if we make an all-out effort to at least
preserve Britain now. And never doubt that we would
be attacked. Mein Kampf is a good prophet, and it
says, "War is the natural state of peoples . . ."
Another thing is troubling me. There is a Profes
sor of this University who stood on a platform re
cently and told an audience he could find nothing
wrong with Germany ,and there arc two or three
others who actually are members of Communist Sym
pathizers, Orson Welles' Committee to Defend Com
munist Harry Bridges.
When war has come the country must watch closely
these men who seem to prefer a society whose greeting
is the Upraised Arm and the Clenched Fist.
