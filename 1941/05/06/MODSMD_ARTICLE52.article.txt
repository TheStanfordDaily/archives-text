I would like to correct or modify a statement
made by Linn Moses in The Daily today. He said
that none of the other colleges have Honor Systems.
If he visited Princeton University he surely found
that they had one—one of the oldest and best in the
country. There are others in eastern colleges.
Sincerely yours,
