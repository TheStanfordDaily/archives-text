# She's Blonde, Blue-Eyed,...
## Daily Seeks Dream Of Motorcycle Lover

KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 5 (UP).
—The 90-mile romance of Earl Lee
Archer, 20, faded into a distant putt
putt tonight. But he'll be back.
He spent 24 futile hours trying to
remember her name or automobile
license number after meeting her at
the Kentucky Derby Saturday in

In the hope of aiding Mr. Archer
in his search for the Stanford mys
tery woman, The Daily announces
the opening of a "Who Was She?"
contest. Any student with a clue
to the identity of the blue-eyed
blonde is urged to deliver the same
to the Shack. The Daily will wire
the Arkansas traveler should the
search prove successful.

Louisville and chasing her car half
way to Kansas City on his motor
cycle.
In accounting class at the Univer
sity of Arkansas, he'd been figuring
odds on the derby. He motored over
to Louisville with Freshman Louis
(Red) McClemmon hanging on be
hind. At Churchill Downs he saw
this girl. His six-feet-three in cow
boy boots, Arkansas U. sweater and
helmet fell into easy drawling con
versation. Just in time he remem
bered to put his $5 bet on Whirl
away. But the girl had disappeared.
He remembered to collect his $14.50
and McClemmon and start home. In
Indiana he saw a car with a Stan
ford U. sticker on it and the girl
in the back seat.
A disapproving father and mother
and the wind made conversation dif
ficult. He and the girl, stopping for
gasoline, managed to exchange
notes, "from Missouri to Arkansas"
and vice versa. She said "father
doesn't like this. Come to see me."
At St. Louis he lost her. Instead
of turning south for Fayetteville, he
came to Kansas City last night. He
sought help of police.
"She's blonde, blue-eyed, went to
Stanford last year, and she's beauti
ful," he told sympathetic but un
helpful police. He hoped she would
hear of his plight by newspaper or
radio and give him a hint. With the
glum McClemmon he sat around
headquarters until dark. Then the
two boys climbed stiffly aboard the
motor and headed south.

"All I want is her address to
write her," Archer said. "Yea, we
got lots of pretty girls in Arkansas.
But I never saw a blonde like her.
If you hear anything, let me know
at the men's dormitory, Fayetteville.
I'm coming back week-end after
next to look some more if I don't
hear from her. • She's blonde, blue
eyed and she's "

"Come on," McClemmon reminded
him. "We got an 8 o'clock class in
the morning."
