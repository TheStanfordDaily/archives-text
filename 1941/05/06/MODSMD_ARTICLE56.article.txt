# Durbin Shows Mature Skill In 'Nice Girl?'
## 
### 
"NICE GIRL?" with Deanna Dur
bin, Franchot Tone, and Robert
Bcnchley, now playing at the Fox
Stanford.

Now is the time for people to stop
saying, "Deanna Durbin is growing
up." With this, her latest picture all
such remarks become passe and
Miss Durbin may look upon
"Nice Girl?" as a diploma certifying
that she is now a fully credited adult,
with a mature acting skill.
Durbin fans who have watched
our little Deanna progress from a
precocious kiddie, through awkward
adolescence, to a discreet ingenue,
can stop holding their breath. From
here it looks like Deanna has both
feet firmly planted in Grauman ce
ment, because as an actress she has'
developed to the point where she
can hold her own without relying on
childish appeal or her undeniable
singing talent. If you'll pardon a
prediction, it looks like she'll go on
to become as much of an institution
as Norma Shearer.
All the above is an oblique way
of saying that "Nice Girl?" is an
excellent picture, if you like simple
quiet, home-town stories. Even if
you don't, the combination of a
piquant story, amusing dialogue, at
tractive cast, and William Seiter's
knowing direction make this a pic
ture far above the average.
Happily the story doesn't droop
into sentimentality, as it easily could
have. The plot is slight—it revolves
about Deanna Durbin's efforts to
shed the unenviable reputation of
being the sort of a girl whom every
one tags as "nice"—meaning dull.
She succeeds.
Robert Benchley as the professor
father is somewhat languid; Fran
chot Tone and pipe are charmingly
suave, while Robert Stack is pretty,
even when covered with car-grease.
Outstanding is a teen-age snip —
names always escape me—who plays
the brattish kid sister.
Now for the gripes—why did they
have to mess up the end, by running
in a national defense sequence at an
army camp, with Deanna Durbin
pulling a Kate Smith in a strident
thing called, "Thank You, America"?
When we pay r. 10 per cent bnter
tainment tax, we could be spared
that.
If you time it right you can miss
"Blondie Goes Latin," in which Dag
wod beats a drum and knocks people
down, and Blondie sachets through
a mongrel sort of conga, all without
the slightest provocation.—Douglass
