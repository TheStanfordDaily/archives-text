### Jean Nowell 
SECRETARY of War Stimson
k walked out of an extraordinary
session of the Roosevelt "war cabi
net" yesterday, and a few hours later
made a speech advocating the use
of the U.S. navy to safeguard ship
ment of war supplies to Britain. Spe
cifically he warned Germany that
America would not "permit these
munitions to be sunk in the Atlantic
Ocean."
In the House all amendments
which would cripple a bill empow
ering the President to acquire for
use in the Battle of the Atlantic for
eign vessels now idle in American
waters and arranged to vote on the
measure today. At the same time
Claude Pepper of Florida was argu
ing in a Senate speech that loss of a
few American lives now would be
"immaterial compared with what we
would save at some future date."
Ostensibly the "war cabinet"
discussed action on the order for
expanded heavy bomber produc
tion, but you can bet they men
tioned a few other matters of im
port during that 90-minute chat.
The balloons are going up. Stim
son would.never have spoken with
out the administration's blessing, and
government - barometer Pepper's
speech seems a good way to test un
offiical Senate opinion. The House's
action shows the trend in that
branch of government.

WAS probably an accidcnt that
the cabinet meeting took place on
the same day that Prime Minister
Menzies arrived here on his way
back to Australia; and on the day
that bitter open debate on the war
began in Britain's House of Com
mons.
The United States and convoys
figured prominently in both of
these incidents. In New York
Menzies said that the United
States could do more than produce
war materials, it could "see that
they arrive where they will do the
most good."
When a reporter asked him if this
statement meant he desired convoys
he replied:
"I do. It would be quite bogus of
me not to give you that answer. Of
course, it is for you to decide on
the facts as you see them and I hope
that you handle that as a quite hon
est opinion from me, and not as a
suggestion of what your policy
should be."

/\VER in London the Churchill
government entered "Parliament
determined to thresh out the sore
points. Whether it stands or falls
depends upon the outcome of these
debates. Under the slashing ques
tions and criticisms of outspoken
members was Anthony Eden, who
was recently given the job of ce
menting the pro-British Greek-
Turkish-Yugoslavian bloc.
Most bitter of the government's
critics was Leslie I lore - Bclisha
war minister under the Chamber
lain war regime. Perhaps the ma
jor point made by Eden was that
faster and "more certain" aid from
the United States will shorten the
war and give Britain victory in
both the Battles of the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean.
Laborite Hastings Bertrand Lees
Smith said in the final analysis the
Battle of the Atlantic holds Britain's
fate. He appealed urgently to the
United States to persuade Eire to
turn over air and naval bases to
Britain. (The Irish attitude in this
matter is doing no one any good, in
cluding the Irish if Hitler attacks
the Island.) He also asked for
"complete co-operation" of the
United States Navy to allow trans
fer of British warships to the Medi
terranean to "transform the whole
war there."
This flare-up of the whole convoy
question is undoubtedly a condi
tioning process for the American
people. And, though he has never
said so definitely, it is clear that
Roosevelt is determined on convoy
ing no matter what the cost. Dig in,
firends—we're practically there.
This sudden elevation of Josef
Stalin to the post, of Soviet premier
may mean anything or nothing. At
any rate, it was quite a shock to
most of the world, which probably
had never realized that Stalin didn't
hold every post in the Russian book
already.

session of the Roosevelt "war cabi
net" yesterday, and a few hours later
made a speech advocating the use
of the U.S. navy to safeguard ship
ment of war supplies to Britain. Spe
cifically he warned Germany that
America would not "permit these
munitions to be sunk in the Atlantic
Ocean."
In the House all amendments
which would cripple a bill empow
ering the President to acquire for
use in the Battle of the Atlantic for
eign vessels now idle in American
waters and arranged to vote on the
measure today. At the same time
Claude Pepper of Florida was argu
ing in a Senate speech that loss of a
few American lives now would be
"immaterial compared with what we
would save at some future date."
Ostensibly the "war cabinet"
discussed action on the order for
expanded heavy bomber produc
tion, but you can bet they men
tioned a few other matters of im
port during that 90-minute chat.
The balloons are going up. Stim
son would.never have spoken with
out the administration's blessing, and
government - barometer Pepper's
speech seems a good way to test un
offiical Senate opinion. The House's
action shows the trend in that
branch of government.

WAS probably an accidcnt that
the cabinet meeting took place on
the same day that Prime Minister
Menzies arrived here on his way
back to Australia; and on the day
that bitter open debate on the war
began in Britain's House of Com
mons.
The United States and convoys
figured prominently in both of
these incidents. In New York
Menzies said that the United
States could do more than produce
war materials, it could "see that
they arrive where they will do the
most good."
When a reporter asked him if this
statement meant he desired convoys
he replied:
"I do. It would be quite bogus of
me not to give you that answer. Of
course, it is for you to decide on
the facts as you see them and I hope
that you handle that as a quite hon
est opinion from me, and not as a
suggestion of what your policy
should be."

/\VER in London the Churchill
government entered "Parliament
determined to thresh out the sore
points. Whether it stands or falls
depends upon the outcome of these
debates. Under the slashing ques
tions and criticisms of outspoken
members was Anthony Eden, who
was recently given the job of ce
menting the pro-British Greek-
Turkish-Yugoslavian bloc.
Most bitter of the government's
critics was Leslie I lore - Bclisha
war minister under the Chamber
lain war regime. Perhaps the ma
jor point made by Eden was that
faster and "more certain" aid from
the United States will shorten the
war and give Britain victory in
both the Battles of the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean.
Laborite Hastings Bertrand Lees
Smith said in the final analysis the
Battle of the Atlantic holds Britain's
fate. He appealed urgently to the
United States to persuade Eire to
turn over air and naval bases to
Britain. (The Irish attitude in this
matter is doing no one any good, in
cluding the Irish if Hitler attacks
the Island.) He also asked for
"complete co-operation" of the
United States Navy to allow trans
fer of British warships to the Medi
terranean to "transform the whole
war there."
This flare-up of the whole convoy
question is undoubtedly a condi
tioning process for the American
people. And, though he has never
said so definitely, it is clear that
Roosevelt is determined on convoy
ing no matter what the cost. Dig in,
firends—we're practically there.
This sudden elevation of Josef
Stalin to the post, of Soviet premier
may mean anything or nothing. At
any rate, it was quite a shock to
most of the world, which probably
had never realized that Stalin didn't
hold every post in the Russian book

made a speech advocating the use
of the U.S. navy to safeguard ship
ment of war supplies to Britain. Spe
cifically he warned Germany that
America would not "permit these
munitions to be sunk in the Atlantic
Ocean."
In the House all amendments
which would cripple a bill empow
ering the President to acquire for
use in the Battle of the Atlantic for
eign vessels now idle in American
waters and arranged to vote on the
measure today. At the same time
Claude Pepper of Florida was argu
ing in a Senate speech that loss of a
few American lives now would be
"immaterial compared with what we
would save at some future date."
Ostensibly the "war cabinet"
discussed action on the order for
expanded heavy bomber produc
tion, but you can bet they men
tioned a few other matters of im
port during that 90-minute chat.
The balloons are going up. Stim
son would.never have spoken with
out the administration's blessing, and
government - barometer Pepper's
speech seems a good way to test un
offiical Senate opinion. The House's
action shows the trend in that
branch of government.

WAS probably an accidcnt that
the cabinet meeting took place on
the same day that Prime Minister
Menzies arrived here on his way
back to Australia; and on the day
that bitter open debate on the war
began in Britain's House of Com
mons.
The United States and convoys
figured prominently in both of
these incidents. In New York
Menzies said that the United
States could do more than produce
war materials, it could "see that
they arrive where they will do the
most good."
When a reporter asked him if this
statement meant he desired convoys
he replied:
"I do. It would be quite bogus of
me not to give you that answer. Of
course, it is for you to decide on
the facts as you see them and I hope
that you handle that as a quite hon
est opinion from me, and not as a
suggestion of what your policy
should be."

/\VER in London the Churchill
government entered "Parliament
determined to thresh out the sore
points. Whether it stands or falls
depends upon the outcome of these
debates. Under the slashing ques
tions and criticisms of outspoken
members was Anthony Eden, who
was recently given the job of ce
menting the pro-British Greek-
Turkish-Yugoslavian bloc.
Most bitter of the government's
critics was Leslie I lore - Bclisha
war minister under the Chamber
lain war regime. Perhaps the ma
jor point made by Eden was that
faster and "more certain" aid from
the United States will shorten the
war and give Britain victory in
both the Battles of the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean.
Laborite Hastings Bertrand Lees
Smith said in the final analysis the
Battle of the Atlantic holds Britain's
fate. He appealed urgently to the
United States to persuade Eire to
turn over air and naval bases to
Britain. (The Irish attitude in this
matter is doing no one any good, in
cluding the Irish if Hitler attacks
the Island.) He also asked for
"complete co-operation" of the
United States Navy to allow trans
fer of British warships to the Medi
terranean to "transform the whole
war there."
This flare-up of the whole convoy
question is undoubtedly a condi
tioning process for the American
people. And, though he has never
said so definitely, it is clear that
Roosevelt is determined on convoy
ing no matter what the cost. Dig in,
firends—we're practically there.
This sudden elevation of Josef
Stalin to the post, of Soviet premier
may mean anything or nothing. At
any rate, it was quite a shock to
most of the world, which probably
had never realized that Stalin didn't
hold every post in the Russian book
already.
