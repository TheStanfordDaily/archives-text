# FARM PROFESSORS DISCUSS WAR CRISIS
## Series Symposium Led by Robinson 
### VIC MINAHAN 
The European war, America's re
lation to it and the present national
crisis were the subjects for discus
sion ;it a "round table" symposium
presented last night by six of Stan
ford's foremost experts in the fields
of economics, history and industrial
relations. The symposium was pre
sented by the Tuesday Evening
Series.
The program took on an "Infor
mation Please" aspect, with Chair
man Professor E. G. Robinson giv
ing each speaker a specific question
to discuss and answer, and later the
audience posing more specific ques
tions.
Discussing the question '"What
economic endurance has Germany?"
Dr. Karl Brandt, professor of agri
cultural economics with the Food
Research Institute, warned against
"an oversimplified appraisal of Ger
many's ultimate strength in this
war."
"At the end of twenty months of
war, Germany's economic strength
is greater than it was iri September
1939," he stated.
Pointing out that the whole of
Europe and therefore the human re
sources of 330,000,000 people are now
included within the German eco
nomic orbit, Dr. Brandt questioned
whether the conquered countries are
a liability rather than an asset to the
Germans.
"It is not surprising that the citi
zens of the conquered nations prefer

to work and eat rather than die in
the dungeons," he remarked.
Agreement to Dr. Brandt's asser
tion that Germany's strength has
been "consistently underestimated"
was voiced by Dr. Ralph Lutz, pro
fessor of history, who discussed the
question, "What military strength
has Germany on the continent of
Europe?"
"Germany now has 3,500,000 to
4,225,000 organized men in about 250
divisions, which compares favor
ably with her strength at the end of

the last war," he declared.
Discussing the mora It of the Ger
man people, Dr. Lutz expressed the
belief that revolution is a practical
impossibility "as long as the Nazis
keep on winning."
''If revolution does come, though,
it will begin not among the con
quered peoples, but in the armed
forces of Germany itself," he added.
The scene of discussion shifted to
America with the introduction of
Elmer D. Fagan, professor of eco
nomics, to whom was posed the

query "How much is the war going
to cost America, and how Ls it going
to be paid?"
Dwelling for the most part on the
problem of the inflationary tenden
cies of defense spending, Professor
Fagan declared that a prolonged and
sizeable program of borrowing by
the government would cause unde
sirable inflation.
He also pointed out that such a
program would cause "unjust tax
ation" both at present and in the



SYMPOSIUM speakers were, left

Ralph Lilt/., and Elmer Fagan.
