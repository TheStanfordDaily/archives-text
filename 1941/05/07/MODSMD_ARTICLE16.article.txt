Slouched down in a chair with
his feet stretched on the table, A1
Hampson, sophomore Daily reporter,
snoozed peacefully in the library.
Cautiously his pals across the
table untied his shoestrings and
stuck up two matches, while stu
dents in the right wing of the read
ing room looked on in amusement
and suspense. Soon all was set and
the matches were lit.
Awakened with a start, Hampson
was greeted by a roar of laughter.
Sheepishly he crawled under the
table to rescue his burning shoes.
Twenty minutes later he was sound
asleep again.
