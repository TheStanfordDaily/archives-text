# Farm Donates $5000 to Home
## 
### 
Additional results of the 1941 Con
valescent Home Drive, in which
Stanford contributed approximately
$5000, show that the Farm turned
out in great numbers for the follow
ing events:
STRAWBERRY BRUNCH: The
Farm was just a little hungrier for
strawberries and coffee this year
than last, handing over precisely $1
more to the Home fund than the $100
received in 1940. The Brunch pro
ceeds totaled $202, but this money
was divided equally between the
"Y" and the Convalescent Home.
LABOR DAY: More Stanfordites
turned out at the Home on Labor
Day to toil lightly and eat heavily
than for several years. Because of
the large attendance, there is a pos
sibility that afternoon classes may
be dismissed for the 1942 Labor Day.
BRIDGE TOURNEY: Confidence
of the Farm in its bridge playing in
creased tremendously between 1940
and 1941 for attendance at the
bridge tournament was five times as
great as last year's. living Hellman
and Herbert Zimmerman proved
themselves the top card manipula
tors on campus to capture this
year's tourney.
JOLLY-UP: The Farm contribut
ed an unexpected $62.20 to the Home
when 622 dancers arrived at the joi
ly up following the Labor Day bar
becue.
SOPH CARNIVAL: No results arc
yet available on the proceeds from
the Soph Carnival, but Drive Chair
man Graham Barbcy estimates that
the sum will total approximately
$600.
