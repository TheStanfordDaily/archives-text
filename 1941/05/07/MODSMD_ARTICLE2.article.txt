# Daily Tracks Down Juliet For Romeo
## Motorcycle Lover's Girl Found to Be '40 Farm Graduate 
### MARTHA DEANE 
Last night The Daily wired Earl
Lee Archer, the "motorcycle lover,"
the information that may end his
search for his blue-eyed blonde.
After intensive perusals of old Bawl
outs, last year's Quad, and inquiries
at various living groups, the finger
was convincingly pointed at Mary
Helen Linger, of Kansas City, Mo.
The telegram which was dispatched
to Earl Lee Archer at the University
of Arkansas at Fayetteville read as
follows:
"Check-ups here indicate your
blue-eyed blonde from Stanford is
Mary Helen Linger, 4 West 61st St.,
Kansas City. Good luck. Wire us
collect immediately how you come
out.
Wilson Cannon, Editor
Stanford Daily"
The task was undertaken by The
Daily in an attempt to help the 20-
year-old University of Arkansas stu
dent find the girl he saw at the Ken
tucky Derby and followed for 90
miles on his motorcycle. Because his
chase was futile and because the
Kansas City police were unable to
help him, The Daily conducted an
investigation.

The "ferreting out" of Miss Linger,
who graduated with the Class of
1940, was done by a process of elim
ination. The Bawlout was searched
for all feminine residents of the St.
Louis-Kansas City area who at
tended Stanford last year. With the
list narrowed down to four, the
Quad was consulted to discover
whether or not the young ladies in
question were "blue-eyed blonde."
The results of this eliminated all
but two and the girls living in Mari
posa who knew Miss Linger last
year provided the clinching evidence.
According to them, Miss Linger is
"very blonde with blue eyes," she is
a racing fan and has missed only
one Kentucky Derby in recent
years, and she lives at 4 West 61st
St., Kansas City, Mo.
With all this information on file,
the wire was sent and The Daily
wishes Mr. Archer the best of luck.

"Check-ups here indicate your
blue-eyed blonde from Stanford is
Mary Helen Linger, 4 West 61st St.,
Kansas City. Good luck. Wire us
collect immediately how you come
out.

Stanford Daily"
The task was undertaken by The
Daily in an attempt to help the 20-
year-old University of Arkansas stu
dent find the girl he saw at the Ken
tucky Derby and followed for 90
miles on his motorcycle. Because his
chase was futile and because the
Kansas City police were unable to
help him, The Daily conducted an
investigation.

The "ferreting out" of Miss Linger,
who graduated with the Class of
1940, was done by a process of elim
ination. The Bawlout was searched
for all feminine residents of the St.
Louis-Kansas City area who at
tended Stanford last year. With the
list narrowed down to four, the
Quad was consulted to discover
whether or not the young ladies in
question were "blue-eyed blonde."
The results of this eliminated all
but two and the girls living in Mari
posa who knew Miss Linger last
year provided the clinching evidence.
According to them, Miss Linger is
"very blonde with blue eyes," she is
a racing fan and has missed only
one Kentucky Derby in recent
years, and she lives at 4 West 61st
St., Kansas City, Mo.
With all this information on file,
the wire was sent and The Daily
wishes Mr. Archer the best of luck.
Last night The Daily wired Earl
Lee Archer, the "motorcycle lover,"
the information that may end his
search for his blue-eyed blonde.
After intensive perusals of old Bawl
outs, last year's Quad, and inquiries
at various living groups, the finger
was convincingly pointed at Mary
Helen Linger, of Kansas City, Mo.
The telegram which was dispatched
to Earl Lee Archer at the University
of Arkansas at Fayetteville read as
follows:
