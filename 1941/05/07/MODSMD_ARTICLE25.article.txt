LONDON. May G (UP). â€” The
"war of oil" spread over larger areas
of Iraq today, after a breakdown of
neutral peace feelers, when British
Lumbers blasted at Iraqi military po
sitions and weakened the five-day
old siege of Habbaniya air base.
Axis reports said 3,000 British
troops within the besiezed base on
the Euphrates, including Austra
lians, were completely encircled. But
the Iraqi forces were unable to
storm Habbaniya because it is sur
rounded by electrified barricades.
