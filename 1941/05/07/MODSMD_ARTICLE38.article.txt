# U.S.C. Team Meets Farm Track Men
## 
### 
Headed by a great buiu'h Â«if top
notch hurdlers, those Terrible Tro
jans invade Stanford Saturday for a
dual meet at Angell Field.
Johnny Biewener is the best high ;
hurdler in the West, with the pos- |
sible exception of Joe Batiste. John ;
runs 14.5 and 14.(5 with no trouble j
at all. Behind him come Art Kace- |
wicz, who was a surprise winner J
against the Indians last year, and
Don Hommel, who is returning to [
lorm after being on the shell' *for I
some weeks.
NEWCOMER JOHNSON
In the lows, Cromwell has Art
Laret and a newcomer, Sammy
Johnson. This is probably the fin
est collection of timber-toppers ever
gathered together under one ban
ner.
With Cliff Bourland concentrating
on the sprints, U.S.C. is well stocked
with men for the short races. Hu
bert Kearns and Howard Callanan
are at least the equalof Stanford's
Johnny Grant.
UPTON-CLARK RACE
Although he hasn't been heard j
from so much this year, Howard Up- j
ton still runs a fine quarter-mile, I
and his race with Ernie Clark should
be a beauty. Don't overlook the In
dians' Don McFarland, who broke
loose with a 48 flat quarter Satur
day.
Leroy Weed is going to have no
trouble at all in the mile: but War- j
ren Smith had better watch Blair <
Hyde.
Sophomore Kenny Wren in the
broad jump. Bill Schaefer, a real
pole-vaulter, and Carl Merritt, a
Modesto J. C. transfer, are going
to win points for Troy in the field |
events. Merritt throws the discus j
and shot.
