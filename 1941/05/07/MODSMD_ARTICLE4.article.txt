# Big May Chappie Features Travel
## 
### 
This morning at 8 o'clock will see
the appearance of the May issue of
Chaparral. This month the magazine
not only sports a travel theme, but it
is larger in size, having four more
than the usual number of 32 pages.
In keeping with the theme, Johnny
Lawry has written a story entitled,
"Oh Come With Me." "I Don't Like
George Anymore," a collaboration
by Hurt and Elliot is the nostalgic
story of a wayward son of the
campus.
That old demon "the draft" comes
in for its usual share of attention
with a feature on "Both Sides of
Army Life" by Barney McClure, and
the cover of the magazine by Frank
Hewitt, is a brightly colored affair,
which all those facing the draft will
see through.
