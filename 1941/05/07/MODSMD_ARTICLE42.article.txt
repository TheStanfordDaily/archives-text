# Basketballers Begin Practice
## 
### 
With a turnout of approximately
25 men, Coach Everett Dean is con
ducting spring basketball practice.
The squad is to work out from 4:30
to 5:45 four times a week for the
next three weeks.
Coach Dean and Assistant Bobby
Burnett will stress fundamentals
chiefly during the three-week ses
sion, while the players will attempt
| to iron out some of their own weak
: nesses and to locate their best shots.
Lettermen returning are Don Bur
ness, big center who has definitely
escaped the draft bugaboo, having
been placed in class B1 because of
his old knee injury; Fordy Ander
son smooth ball handler and one of
the fastest forwards on the Coast,
who has not yet been called, and big
Bill Cowden, rangy guard.
What with Ed Voss, Fred Linari,
Chuck Smith, Jack Dana, Tiff Den
ton, Tom Fuller, and John Eikelman
back from last year's squad and Jim

Pollard "Bones" Halstead, Bill Hoo
per, Dick West, Dick Middleton, Bob
Wreisner and Dick MacDonough, to
mention a few up from last season's
great frosh outfit, the competition
should be quite keen for berths on
the "41-'42 squad.
