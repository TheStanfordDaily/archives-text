### CHUCK SMITH 
' ARE getting rougher and rougher for Coach Pitch Johnson
and that dwindling bunch of tracksters who are working out daily on
Angell Field to prepare their meager defenses against the invading Tro
jan Horde this Saturday.
For Pitch Johnson it has been one hard break after another. He's had
enough bad luck this season to make even a veteran coach, let alone a
newcomer, tear his hair in disgust.
This week things reached a low ebb for the track Lam when sick
ness. lack of finances, and spring football all helped to slash (he already
unimposing ranks of cindermen.
Most sorely felt to Johnson and the rest of the team was the loss of
Ed Hertel, the hard luck kid of the Big Meet. Ed is now 15 pounds un
derweight in his battle to shake sinus trouble and it seems hopeless to
predict that he will ever be in shape to run again this season.

JUST when Thor Peterson, husky Card broad jumper, seemed to
have gotten over the sore heel which has been bothering him all
season, he aeicdentally spiked himself in the P.A. meet last Saturday
and will probably also be out for the remainder of the season.
Loss number three was due to financial difficulties. Kai Larson, be
cause he was unable to make his deferred tuition payment, has had to
drop out of school, and in this way Johnson and Co. have lost a real up
j and-coming half-miler who hit 1:54 against Cal.
Funny tiling about Kai and the Cal meet. Technically speaking,
when Larson was unable to meet the payment the Thursday before
the Cal meet when it was due, he was out of school and actually in
eligible when he tied for second place in the 880 against (he Bears.
I wonder if Cal wants to contest Kai's points?
And this week, to make things complete, both Ed Stamm and Bob
Millington returned to their first love—football—and so have given up !
their track efforts in favor of spring practice.

Y'ES. IT IS a sad tale of woe. It doesn't make my prediction concerning
Stanford taking more points against the mass strength of U.S.C. than
they did against the inspired Bears look any too good.
But I think I'll stick to it despite the fact that these five boys have
| been lost to the track team since the aforementioned prediction and that
they stood for a probable total of 10 points against Troy.

Jg"AVING swept every and all competition offered it on the Coast, Stan
ford's championship golf team has only to dominate the National
Collegiate Golf Association's tournament June 23 to 29 in Columbus, Ohio, j
to make their 1941 season a complete success.
Winners in 1939 and with 5 out of 6 men returning, the Card golfers j
were favorites to repeat last summer. But the team which represented
Stanford in the nationals last year was the result of a series of playoffs
among members of the squad in order to get the trip back East and was
not necessarily the 6 best men.
The result was a rather disappointing exhibition by the (cam. And
so (bis year Coach Eddie Twiggs having learned his lesson will send
back to Ohio bis first 5 or 6 men and go after that title in dead earnest.
And with the sizzling golf Bud Brownell, Warren Berl, Bud Finger,
Sandy Tatum, Gordon Hough, and Don Haslett have been playing, there
I is no reason why these Indian golfers shouldn't continue their string of j
victories even against nationwide competition.
