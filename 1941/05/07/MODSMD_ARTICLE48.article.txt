A GOOD idea, rejuvenated and streamlined
to fit modern Farm tastes, was proffered
last evening in Excom in the form of a proposed
open meeting to take the place of the one
time Leadership Institute and Activities Forum
on the campus activities calendar.
The open meeting, now in the opening throes
of formation, includes two major points:
(1) The hope that an official each from the
8.A.C., the Union Board of Governors and the
Stanford Bookstore will be present at the meet
ing to present the duties and responsibilities of
their specific departments, and to explain their
correlation to the entire Stanford picture.
(2) Plans for a talking over of problems and
responsibilities of various sections of student
government, again with a drawing together of
each point in the jigsaw to create the complete
picture.
★ * * *
Both planks in the proposed platform offer a
tangible solution to problems which in greater
or smaller fashion have been puzzling large
portions of the student body during the past year
and the years preceding.
The first proposal, that of inviting administra
tion leaders to present their phase of the Stan
ford picture to the student body, offers a first
hand answer to one of the major grievances of
undergraduate life.
Perhaps the word "grievance" is incorrectly
used. More properly it should be termed the
extreme dissatisfaction which students feel at
not being given clarifying background on much
action directly concerning them, and at not be
ing able to understand such action because of
a woeful lack of information.
Information on the working mechanism of
certain phases of the Stanford picture should be
received with great interest by undergraduates.
And this will prove especially true should stu
dents be able to guestion the speakers on de
tails which still prove confusing.
The greatest benefits of discussion of this
sort will in all probability come from a student
understanding that, after all, action taken by
the older members of the campus family is
really for the best interests of all.
The second phase of the proposed open meet
ing—that of presenting students with a picture
of the detail and responsibility of the various
student governmental organs—will present the
same sort of clarification and understanding of
the entire student administration picture.
Part of the plan is to present the entire scope
of student government to the student body,
with explanation and background of student
responsibilities and privileges on the Farm. The
plan, unfolding, then will entail a clarification
of the work of each organ of student government
—Excom, Councils, Women's Conference, and
the like.
The plan is swell. And with the details of
how, when and where now being sifted to com
pletion, it promises an interesting evening or
two for you and me.
It's a natural.

(2) Plans for a talking over of problems and
responsibilities of various sections of student
government, again with a drawing together of
each point in the jigsaw to create the complete

Both planks in the proposed platform offer a
tangible solution to problems which in greater
or smaller fashion have been puzzling large
portions of the student body during the past year
and the years preceding.
The first proposal, that of inviting administra
tion leaders to present their phase of the Stan
ford picture to the student body, offers a first
hand answer to one of the major grievances of
undergraduate life.
Perhaps the word "grievance" is incorrectly
used. More properly it should be termed the
extreme dissatisfaction which students feel at
not being given clarifying background on much
action directly concerning them, and at not be
ing able to understand such action because of
a woeful lack of information.
Information on the working mechanism of
certain phases of the Stanford picture should be
received with great interest by undergraduates.
And this will prove especially true should stu
dents be able to guestion the speakers on de
tails which still prove confusing.
The greatest benefits of discussion of this
sort will in all probability come from a student
understanding that, after all, action taken by
the older members of the campus family is
really for the best interests of all.
The second phase of the proposed open meet
ing—that of presenting students with a picture
of the detail and responsibility of the various
student governmental organs—will present the
same sort of clarification and understanding of
the entire student administration picture.
Part of the plan is to present the entire scope
of student government to the student body,
with explanation and background of student
responsibilities and privileges on the Farm. The
plan, unfolding, then will entail a clarification
of the work of each organ of student government
—Excom, Councils, Women's Conference, and
the like.
The plan is swell. And with the details of
how, when and where now being sifted to com
pletion, it promises an interesting evening or
two for you and me.
It's a natural.
A GOOD idea, rejuvenated and streamlined
to fit modern Farm tastes, was proffered
last evening in Excom in the form of a proposed
open meeting to take the place of the one
time Leadership Institute and Activities Forum
on the campus activities calendar.
The open meeting, now in the opening throes
of formation, includes two major points:
(1) The hope that an official each from the
8.A.C., the Union Board of Governors and the
Stanford Bookstore will be present at the meet
ing to present the duties and responsibilities of
their specific departments, and to explain their
correlation to the entire Stanford picture.
(2) Plans for a talking over of problems and
responsibilities of various sections of student
government, again with a drawing together of
each point in the jigsaw to create the complete
picture.
