# Many Instants Make . . .
## 
### 
JUST two or three days ago, the point was made
in a Daily editorial that the people of the
United States are, and always have been, slow
to realize the seriousness and nearness of a
national or international crisis.
Now Dr. Burlingame, chairman of the com
mittee on public education of the American Psy
chiatric Association, has come forward with a
new approach to this problem. "The American
public," he says, "is in danger of being emo
tionally anaesthetized by the constant ups and
downs of war news. We are nearly shockproof
now, or should I say we have reached a state of
punch-drunk stupor in which the bombing of a
town or the sinking of a ship evokes little more
than a shrug of the shoulders?"
Without realizing that he was so doing, Dr.
Burlingame was proving his point as he spoke
those very words. For a ship was being sunk,

a Canadian ship, which carried to the bottom of
the ocean the lives of 11 American airplane
ferry pilots.
You probably read the news. Think back
now. Remember? You merely shrugged your
shoulders—in the manner prescribed by Dr.
Burlingame.
What would you have done about a year ago
if 11 American lives had been similarly snuffed
out? You would not have gone so far as to
cry out for war, but you would have been more
vehement in the way you expressed your in
terest. Yesterday America shouted; today
America shrugs.
The United States is a victim of blitzkrieg
neuroses. It has become punch-drunk under
the daily pounding of Bristol this, Dover that,
Dunkirk this, Budapest that.
Isn't it just as well? Just as well that America
has become punch-drunk. She has learned to
absorb, with a shrug, each blow which is dealt
from day to day. She has learned to disregard
the incident of today, and to look to the future.
She has learned to disregard the instant in order
that she may prepare for "the hour" which those
many instants may make.—B. A.

that she may prepare for "the hour" which those
many instants may make.—B. A.
JUST two or three days ago, the point was made
in a Daily editorial that the people of the
United States are, and always have been, slow
to realize the seriousness and nearness of a
national or international crisis.
Now Dr. Burlingame, chairman of the com
mittee on public education of the American Psy
chiatric Association, has come forward with a
new approach to this problem. "The American
public," he says, "is in danger of being emo
tionally anaesthetized by the constant ups and
downs of war news. We are nearly shockproof
now, or should I say we have reached a state of
punch-drunk stupor in which the bombing of a
town or the sinking of a ship evokes little more
than a shrug of the shoulders?"
Without realizing that he was so doing, Dr.
Burlingame was proving his point as he spoke
those very words. For a ship was being sunk,

a Canadian ship, which carried to the bottom of
the ocean the lives of 11 American airplane
ferry pilots.
You probably read the news. Think back
now. Remember? You merely shrugged your
shoulders—in the manner prescribed by Dr.
Burlingame.
What would you have done about a year ago
if 11 American lives had been similarly snuffed
out? You would not have gone so far as to
cry out for war, but you would have been more
vehement in the way you expressed your in
terest. Yesterday America shouted; today
America shrugs.
The United States is a victim of blitzkrieg
neuroses. It has become punch-drunk under
the daily pounding of Bristol this, Dover that,
Dunkirk this, Budapest that.
Isn't it just as well? Just as well that America
has become punch-drunk. She has learned to
absorb, with a shrug, each blow which is dealt
from day to day. She has learned to disregard
the incident of today, and to look to the future.
She has learned to disregard the instant in order
that she may prepare for "the hour" which those
many instants may make.—B. A.
