# BULL SESSION
## BATTLE OF THE CENTURY 
### JERRY MAYER 
IF ONE has never belonged to an eating club (and
there seem to be numerous persons on campus who
never have) he has missed something. It is said that
the "mill of democracy grinds slowly but extremely
fine." (Or something like that.) But one has never
seen democracy really grinding until he has attended
a regular Monday night meeting of an eating club.
Immediately after dinner, the members disperse to
attend to little odds and ends, while the hashers clean
up the meeting room. It is to be understood that in a
majority of Stanford's eating clubs (all seven of them,
in fact) the meeting room and the dining room are
the same. If the club really has imagination and ini
tiative, it also has a den, which usually is also the
dining room and meeting room. One of the clubs
went high-hat and added a rumpus room. By coinci
dence, the rumpus room bore strikingly similar resem
blance to the den, the meeting room, and the dining
room.
Last Monday night we had some trouble at my
eating club because one of the guys got mixed up and
thought he was in the den instead of the meeting room.

question under discussion at our last meeting
was the singfest. We wanted to enter but inas
much as our official song is not generally classified in
the same category as "Sweetheart of Sigma Chi" or
"Violets" we thought we ought to pick out something
outstanding.
Besides, at the moment we aren't on speaking
terms with the S.A.E.'s because one of their politicians,
who is trying to know all the big shots on campus,
didn't mention any of our names as being prominent
among the shots.
"Let's sing about the Irishman," suggested one
anonymous person.
After violent discussion the idea was vetoed.
"Let's sing a cowboy song," suggested another
anonymous person.
After violent discussion the idea was vetoed. (The
phrase "violent discussion" is, of course, a euphemism.
Our expert on culture decided that we should sing
a little ditty called "All Through the Night." So we
tried it out. We had a brilliant idea. Only one man
could carry a tune, so we were going to let him sing a
solo and the rest of us would just stand up there
and sway.
The fellow proved obstinate, obdurate, stubborn,
dogmatic. He didn't like the idea very much. He was
dead set against it.
"Why do you other guys have to be up there," he
asked.

66W7E HAVE an intramural game with a fraternity
this week," our intramural manager casually in
formed us.
That's where we got interested. We clubmen hate
the fraternities. We never go to their dances unless
we're invited. One night we got together and started
up the Row to water the Dekes, who we don't think
can hold an candle to us in the watering business.
We got as far as the Breakers (approximately 25
feet), and decided that the Dekes could wait for a
few minutes while we attended to the Breakers. But
you know how the minutes fly. We fought for days,
for weeks, for years. We never did get around to the
Dekes, who are sissies and never throw water bags at
anything but sorority girls, who are also sissies.
We were finally set to throw a concerted effort at
the Dekes, when a new Dean of Men came into office.
I think the Dekes understand our present reticence in
the matter.

Last Monday night we had some trouble at my
eating club because one of the guys got mixed up and
thought he was in the den instead of the meeting room.

question under discussion at our last meeting
was the singfest. We wanted to enter but inas
much as our official song is not generally classified in
the same category as "Sweetheart of Sigma Chi" or
"Violets" we thought we ought to pick out something
outstanding.
Besides, at the moment we aren't on speaking
terms with the S.A.E.'s because one of their politicians,
who is trying to know all the big shots on campus,
didn't mention any of our names as being prominent
among the shots.
"Let's sing about the Irishman," suggested one
anonymous person.
After violent discussion the idea was vetoed.
"Let's sing a cowboy song," suggested another
anonymous person.
After violent discussion the idea was vetoed. (The
phrase "violent discussion" is, of course, a euphemism.
Our expert on culture decided that we should sing
a little ditty called "All Through the Night." So we
tried it out. We had a brilliant idea. Only one man
could carry a tune, so we were going to let him sing a
solo and the rest of us would just stand up there
and sway.
The fellow proved obstinate, obdurate, stubborn,
dogmatic. He didn't like the idea very much. He was
dead set against it.
"Why do you other guys have to be up there," he
asked.

66W7E HAVE an intramural game with a fraternity
this week," our intramural manager casually in
formed us.
That's where we got interested. We clubmen hate
the fraternities. We never go to their dances unless
we're invited. One night we got together and started
up the Row to water the Dekes, who we don't think
can hold an candle to us in the watering business.
We got as far as the Breakers (approximately 25
feet), and decided that the Dekes could wait for a
few minutes while we attended to the Breakers. But
you know how the minutes fly. We fought for days,
for weeks, for years. We never did get around to the
Dekes, who are sissies and never throw water bags at
anything but sorority girls, who are also sissies.
We were finally set to throw a concerted effort at
the Dekes, when a new Dean of Men came into office.
I think the Dekes understand our present reticence in
the matter.
IF ONE has never belonged to an eating club (and
there seem to be numerous persons on campus who
never have) he has missed something. It is said that
the "mill of democracy grinds slowly but extremely
fine." (Or something like that.) But one has never
seen democracy really grinding until he has attended
a regular Monday night meeting of an eating club.
Immediately after dinner, the members disperse to
attend to little odds and ends, while the hashers clean
up the meeting room. It is to be understood that in a
majority of Stanford's eating clubs (all seven of them,
in fact) the meeting room and the dining room are
the same. If the club really has imagination and ini
tiative, it also has a den, which usually is also the
dining room and meeting room. One of the clubs
went high-hat and added a rumpus room. By coinci
dence, the rumpus room bore strikingly similar resem
blance to the den, the meeting room, and the dining
room.
