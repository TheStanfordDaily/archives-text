# CAMPUS OPINION
## TWO STRONG VOICE 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
For the first time in my career at Stanford I have
been angry enough to write a letter to The Daily.
My letter will be in defense of Charles Lindbergh,
one of the few individuals in this great country who
has dared to present facts as they are. The unfortu
nate part of it all is that he told us just what we do
not like to hear. So we label him a copperhead, a
Nazi, a traitor. He is no more a traitor or a Nazi than
I am.
He wants democracy to win this war, but he won
ders if democracy is strong enough to do just that.
I have wondered the same thing and so should any
intelligent person who makes any attempt to sift truth
from the volume of trash thrown at us each morning
in the newspaper.
Lindbergh has dared to say that Germany has a
chance to win this war. Germany has the greatest
machine of war ever seen on this earth. Germans are
methodical; they are good soldiers; they are tacticians.
They are tremendously powerful, and their power
grows daily. Who knows what the future will tell—
perhaps Germany will be the final victor, if anyone will
be the victor. So why do we condemn anyone who
tries to show us where the road lies?
Lindbergh exercised his right of free speech to
warn us of the eventualities that can happen. And
then people are hypocritical and stupid enough to call
him the "greatest traitor since Aaron Burr." If it is
traitorous to try to be level-headed and to tell the
truth our democratic ideals have certainly changed.
So let us be, at least, open minded to the two sides
of this war. We all want Britain to win. and we must
help her. But we must always remember that our
way of living and our standards are pitted against
another way of living and other standards that are
also very powerful. This is all that Lindbergh wants
us to realize.

He wants democracy to win this war, but he won
ders if democracy is strong enough to do just that.
I have wondered the same thing and so should any
intelligent person who makes any attempt to sift truth
from the volume of trash thrown at us each morning
in the newspaper.
Lindbergh has dared to say that Germany has a
chance to win this war. Germany has the greatest
machine of war ever seen on this earth. Germans are
methodical; they are good soldiers; they are tacticians.
They are tremendously powerful, and their power
grows daily. Who knows what the future will tell—
perhaps Germany will be the final victor, if anyone will
be the victor. So why do we condemn anyone who
tries to show us where the road lies?
Lindbergh exercised his right of free speech to
warn us of the eventualities that can happen. And
then people are hypocritical and stupid enough to call
him the "greatest traitor since Aaron Burr." If it is
traitorous to try to be level-headed and to tell the
truth our democratic ideals have certainly changed.
So let us be, at least, open minded to the two sides
of this war. We all want Britain to win. and we must
help her. But we must always remember that our
way of living and our standards are pitted against
another way of living and other standards that are
also very powerful. This is all that Lindbergh wants
us to realize.
