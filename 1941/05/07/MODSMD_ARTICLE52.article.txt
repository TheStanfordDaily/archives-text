# Tarkington Writes New Youth Novel
## 
### 
"THE HERITAGE OF HATCHER
IDE," by Booth Tarkington, on sale
at the Ramona Bookshop.
With this new novel, the old mas
ter story teller, Booth Tarkington,
again turns to his favorite subject:
young people. He has covered most
of their phases, in his "Little Orvie"
stories, in the "Penrod" series, and
in his story of Willy Baxter in "Sev
enteen."
In this novel, Tarkington consid
ers the problem of the 22-year-old
college graduate. He names him
Hatcher Ide, has him graduate from
an excellent university in the middle
of the depression and has him wake
up to the startling fact that money
doesn't grow on bushes.
GRASS WIDOW RETURNS
Further complications set in when
a wealthy grass widow living in the
next door brownstone mansion os
tensibly returns home to escape the
war taxes imposed on her while
abroad. However, the real reason
she returns is to try and recapture
Hatcher's Uncle Victor, who could
never stand the sight of her.
It seems that Hatcher's father has
found that his business partner has
been dipping into the foreigner's ac
counts and now she demands a reck
oning. The partner ups and takes a
dose of sleeping powder, Hatcher's
uncle steps in and with his last
penny makes up the deficit for the
woman he despises and Hatcher
wakes up to the fact that he has been
playing the fool and women his own
age are much nicer really.
A JOB IS NECESSARY
Tarkington's story loses much of
its interest with the unmasking of
the widow for what she really is.
The story should have ended here;
however, it is nice to read a book
once in a while that goes on to a
happy ending.—lWuenschel ,

counts and now she demands a reck

once in a while that goes on to a
happy ending.—lWuenschel ,
