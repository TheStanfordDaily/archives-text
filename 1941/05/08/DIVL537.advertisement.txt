Know Your Bookstore
A stationery department was established under the di
rection of Mrs. H. T. Bauchou who for many years created
all the social stationery for the campus. This included
steel die embossing of letter paper, notes, dance pro
grams, place cards and invitations for the campus family.
The Bookstore still has the tremendous stock of dies which
this service necessitated and today prepares and embosses
invitations and place cards for various Stanford organiza
tions. Today this department excells in its representation
of the finest lines of business and social stationery, greet
ing cards and gifts.
