### Jean Nowell 
[%/lUSSOLINTS newspaper "Popolo
d'ltalia" came out yesterday with
a violent attack on the Vichy govern
ment, and among other things, ac
cused Vichy of secretly conspiring
with Britain and preparing to at
tack the German and Italian forces
"at the right moment" in Africa and
the Mediterranean.
This is interesting, and a little
hard to explain, in the light of the
new agreement just reached by the
French and Germans whereby
France's huge payments for the
army of occupation have been re
duced from 8 to 6 million dollars a
day, and the stringent boundary
controls have been relaxed.
France didn't gel these conces
sions for nothing. It is fairly sure
that Laval, Hitler's protege, will
take over the post of Minister of
the Interior, which entails full
command of internal affairs, in
cluding control of the police. How
ever, Hitler certainly wouldn't
have gone to such lengths to just
let his man into the cabinet.
It. meant a lot to Vichy to get
(hose vital food supplies from occu
pied France across the boundary,
and they probably granted Hitler the
right to go into Syria and possibly
Morocco. Maybe they even agreed to
let troops move across into Spain.

the reason for the Italian
attack is obscure. But two
things are important to remember.
First, General Weygand was at
tacked viciously by Hitler in his
Sunday speech. Second, there is not
one key Italian government position
which is not occupied by a German
or someone the Germans consider
utterly trustworthy.
Perhaps the French arc balking
on some of Hitler's more demand
ing points. Certainly the threat of
France's being "taken over by a
guardian" as the "Popolo d'ltalia"
hinted, may make Vichy more
amenable to Hitler's brand of sug
gestion. On the other hand, may
be Sunday's attack on Weygand
and today's blast mean that the
North African forccs arc not tak
ing too kindly to German pene
tration there.
Churchill no doubt eased a lot of
British minds today when he stated
during the Commons debate that
Britain needs no more help in the
shipping line than she is getting al
ready—for at least a year. If the
summer losses skyrocket this may be
changed, but he's always been hon
est in his statements.
By next year he wants an awful
lot of help from the United States,
but at least, we can concentrate on
the ship-building effort fairly secure
in the belief that Britain isn't going
to lose the Battle of the Atlantic for
a while yet.

A NOTHER point he made should
cause the bomb-shaky British
1o breathe more calmly. Reports from
Beirut and from London indicate
(hat the Empire forces are prob
ably going to win the Iraq "oil" war
before the Germans can get there.
The dispatch claimed that Raschid
Ali Beg's pro-Nazi supporters are
beginning to think the game is up,
and so the palace revolutionists may
capitulate within the next few
weeks. If Britain can squash this
explosive situation, they will have
lightened their Near-Eastern prob
lem considerably.
The reasons for Irish hatred of
Great Britain arc deep-seated and
reasonable. Still there arc a great
many people who think that they
are leaning over backward so far
to maintain their neutrality, that
they arc very apt to sit down
hard—very soon.
If the Irish gave Britain the right
to establish and fortify bases in
Eire, British bombers could operate
much farther out at sea, and their
planes could aid the beleaguered
convoys in the Atlantic*.
Ri«ht now she is unprepared to
withstand much of an attack from
Hitler's forces if he choscs to try
the invasion from their side. Brit
ain couldn't get there fast enough to
help either.
