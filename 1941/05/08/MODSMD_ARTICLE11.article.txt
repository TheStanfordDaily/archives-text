# Stork Brings 'Bacty' Cages' New Monkey
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
A stork visited the bacteriology
department last week. Swooping
down over the animal cages in back
of the museum, it dropped a brand
new baby monkey covered with
downy hair and pink skin.
Second monkey ever born in the
bacteriology cages, the new arrival
will be used for infantile paralysis
experiments when it grows up. Its
mother and 150 other adult monkeys
were shipped to Stanford from India
for Dr. Edwin Sehultz's polio re
search.
MONKEYS INFECTED
Dr. Schultz, professor of experi
mental pathology, and Dr. Hubert
Loring, chemistry professor, are now
trying to obtain a pure sample of the
virus agent that causes infantile
paralysis. If he succeeds, scientists
will be much better equipped to
develop immunity injections.
Dr. Schultz uses the tissue of a
human infantile paralysis victim to
inoculate his monkeys, which are
the only animals susceptible to the
disease.
SPINAL CORDS REMOVED
On about the seventh day, the
monkeys show a slight tremor.
Within the next. 24 hours a com
plete paralysis spreads from the
monkey's legs to its entire body.
A few of the animals recover a'nd
they are permanently immune to
polio. The others are anaesthetized,
while their spinal cords arc removed.
This rope-like strand of nerve
fiber forms the basis for segregation
of the actual virus which causes the
disease from the other tissue ele
ments which surround the virus.
The monkey spinal cord is ground
to bits in a revolving machine. Then
this infected matter is filtered
through tissue pores to make it even
more concentrated.
