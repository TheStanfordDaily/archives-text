# ENGINEERS GET $4,661 IN GIFTS
## 
### 
Stanford's .engineering alumni are
giving tangible evidence this year of
their interest in the School of Engi
neering and in the welfare of pres
ent engineering students.
In response to the Stanford Fund's
Fiftieth Anniversary appeal, 76
alumni and friends of the school
have so far this year contributed
$4,661 in gifts and pledges desig
nated for the use of the engineering
departments.
A considerable part of this sum is
for scholarships and fellowships
which will directly aid engineering
students at Stanford, it was pointed
out by Harold F. Elliott, '16, of Palo
Alto, chairman of the School of En
gineering faculty-alumni committee
which has had charge of the fund
raising effort in collaboration with
the Stanford Fund.
"We are particularly anxious to
have additional engineering schol
arships and fellowships," Mr. Elliott
said yesterday. "The need for
them is emphasized by the fact that
this summer a four-quarter, year

around engineering course is being
offered for the benefit of students
who want to speed up their training
in order to qualify for engineering
positions in national defense indus
tries. Obliged to forego the earnings
from summer jobs, many of these
students will require scholarship aid
or loans."
Following are the friends and
alumni of Stanford who to date have
