"Because of the unusually good
weather of the past week, it has been
decided to open the lake and boat
house until 10 o'clock every night,"
announced Student Manager Dick
Stepp yesterday.
■Hie lake has heretofore been open
until 9 p.m., but the weather has
been so cold at night that it was not
thought that it would pay to keep it
open until the later hour. The
longer hours start tonight.
