# Water Show Will Feature Gala Floats
## Racing, High Diving, To Enliven Largest Lagunita Aquacade 
### 
From the number of reservations
that are coming in, there is every
indication that the aquacade and
water show being given Wednesday
evening will be the largest water
carnival ever held on Lake Lagunita.
The parade of floats beginning the
aquacade program will assemble at
the end of the lake by Dr. Wilbur's
residence and then parade before the
assembled spectators who will watch
the show from the boathouse and
the grassy slope at the left of the
boathouse.
Three prizes will be awarded: for
the best men's float, the best wom
en's float and for the most humorous,
according to Bob Breckner, parade
chaiimun. Parade judges will be
three members of the University
faculty.
Floats will be in keeping with the
Fiftieth Anniversary celebration of
Stanford, commemorating either Se
rious or humorous events of the
Farm's history. Special spotlights
will illumine each float as it passes
ifie spectators.
Prizes for the winners are being
donated by Palo Alto merchants.
Living groups may team together in
entering floats for the parade.
A complete evening's entertain
ment is being planned, with racing,
champion high diving and formation
swimming on the program. A spe
cial skit, written and directed by
Harry Muheim, and performed on a
revolving stage, will be a takeoff on
some of Stanford's better-known
educators.
