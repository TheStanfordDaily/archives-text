# Chi Omegas, Medics Win Singing Fest
## Casa Naranja, D.G., Delt, Chi Psi Take Honorable Mention 
### 
Chi Omega and Medical School
took top honors last night in a rous
ing Singfest which drew a crowd of
3400 people to listen in the wooded
bowl of the Lawrence Frost Amphi
theater.
From start to finish Stanford found
its first Spring Sing a complete suc
cess. Palo Alto visitors and students
walked to the bowl to the strains of
"America the Beautiful" and "Come
Join the Band" played on the
carillon, to sit spell-bound by the
mellow music of the choruses.
Anne Townsend presented the sil
ver cup, gift of Waters and Ross, to
a representative of Chi Omega,
which cleared the women's groups
for first prize with their finished
harmony and well organized rhythm,
in "Chi O Sweetheart."
The Medical School captured the
imagination of the audience when
they stalked on the stage dressed in
white doctors' smocks and gave out
with "Fair Stanford," an original
choice, and a good Farm song for
harmony. Pat Adams, next vice
president of the A.S.S.U., presented
a Med School representative with
the Vanderburgh award, a silver
cup.
HONORABLE MENTION
Honorable mention for the women
went to Casa Naranja (Lagunita Is
the Place for Me) and to Delta Gam
ma (Anchored). Men's groups to win
honorable mention were Delta Tau
Delta (My Delta Queen) and Chi
Psi (Caroline).
Rally Committee's lighting of the
Amphitheater with hundreds of
flickering torches and moonlight,
augmented by baby spots, enhanced
the beauty of the bowl, and made it
light enough to see the STANFORD
spelled out at the base of the stage.
COMMUNITY SINGING
Before and after the program, the
choruses started songs, and soon the
crowd was swaying to the strains of
"Working on the Railroad," "Daisy,"
and "Down by the Old Mill Stream,"
ably led by Chairman Tom Howard,
to make the affair a real community
sing.
All in all, a smoother-handled af
fair has yet to be seen on the Farm.
The night was warm, the crowd
good-humored, and the music su
perb. Plenty of laughter followed
original selections; startled applause
cracked after a silence induced by
soothing melodies.
Bouquets go to Rally Committee
and Tom Howard for the excellent
organization of Stanford's first Sing
fest, which looks on its way to be
coming a tradition. Thanks also go
to Hage's Music Shop for the piano.
Judges for the event were Dr.
Warren D. Allen, Charles A. Kul
mann, and Joel Carter. Herbert B.
Nanney played the carillon before
the program. Only 25 of the origi
nally scheduled 34 groups appeared,
cutting the program a little short,
but giving plenty of time to sing
the Hymn as a fitting finale.
