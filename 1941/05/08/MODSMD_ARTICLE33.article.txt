# Convalescent Home Tots Say Thanks' to Generous Farm
## 
### 
Thoughts about Back to the Farm Week and the Convalescent Home j
Drive are by now tucked away in the more remote recesses of Stanford
minds. Despite the whopping $5000 total, a $(100 improvement over the
1940 mark, turned into the Home's coffers, most Stanfordites have allowed
the memory of that week drift toward mental attics. There is one group, j
however, which has not been

quick to forget.
The kids.
For letters, letters on lined paper
and in sprawling, penciled handwrit- j
ing, have flowed in to Graham Bar
bey, head of the Convalescent Home !
Drive, expressing the sincere thanks
of these kids for the effort Stanford j
made.
Throughout these letters ran a !
unanimous note. The kids always j
started their letters with a "thank
you" to the students of the Farm. '
From then on, however, there was j
a wide range in the topics mentioned
by the convalescing children.
Frankie, for instance, said, "I'll be
glad when I can play over there on
the playground and ride on the
wagons (fixed and painted by stu
dents)." Lorraine Dißeneditti thank
ed Stanfordites for all the games and
toys and then went on to tell how j
she was making a luncheon set in !
school for her mother, Mable said
that she "certainly thinks it is j
pretty here with all the trees and
flowers," and then told about the !■
macaroni bracelets she is making for !
her mother as a Mother's Day sur- j
prise.
Some of the kids had whimsical j
notions, too. Frankie, in another J
portion of his letter, said (concern
ing the program given after stu- j
dents had worked around the Home
during the afternoon), "The part I
liked best was when the four boys I
acted out the little play. When the j
three boys danced, they reminded *
me of the way the Three Little Pigs |
danced!" Another one of the chil- |
dren, Myron Hong, expressed the j
hope that we "will come and see us
some time again."
In a note accompanying the chil
dren's letters, Mrs. A. P. Atwood, j
head of the Convalescent Home, ex
pressed her appreciation for Stan
ford's efforts, saying, "Your very
fine spirit of working with such en- j
thusiasm for the children will al
ways be remembered by me."
There were "thank-you's" from
those who won't forget.

three boys danced, they reminded *
me of the way the Three Little Pigs |
danced!" Another one of the chil- |
dren, Myron Hong, expressed the j
hope that we "will come and see us
some time again."
In a note accompanying the chil
dren's letters, Mrs. A. P. Atwood, j
head of the Convalescent Home, ex
pressed her appreciation for Stan
ford's efforts, saying, "Your very
fine spirit of working with such en- j
thusiasm for the children will al
ways be remembered by me."
There were "thank-you's" from
those who won't forget.

Thoughts about Back to the Farm Week and the Convalescent Home j
Drive are by now tucked away in the more remote recesses of Stanford
minds. Despite the whopping $5000 total, a $(100 improvement over the
1940 mark, turned into the Home's coffers, most Stanfordites have allowed
the memory of that week drift toward mental attics. There is one group, j
however, which has not been

quick to forget.
The kids.
For letters, letters on lined paper
and in sprawling, penciled handwrit- j
ing, have flowed in to Graham Bar
bey, head of the Convalescent Home !
Drive, expressing the sincere thanks
of these kids for the effort Stanford j
made.
Throughout these letters ran a !
unanimous note. The kids always j
started their letters with a "thank
you" to the students of the Farm. '
From then on, however, there was j
a wide range in the topics mentioned
by the convalescing children.
Frankie, for instance, said, "I'll be
glad when I can play over there on
the playground and ride on the
wagons (fixed and painted by stu
dents)." Lorraine Dißeneditti thank
ed Stanfordites for all the games and
toys and then went on to tell how j
she was making a luncheon set in !
school for her mother, Mable said
that she "certainly thinks it is j
pretty here with all the trees and
flowers," and then told about the !■
macaroni bracelets she is making for !
her mother as a Mother's Day sur- j
prise.
Some of the kids had whimsical j
notions, too. Frankie, in another J
portion of his letter, said (concern
ing the program given after stu- j
dents had worked around the Home
during the afternoon), "The part I
liked best was when the four boys I
acted out the little play. When the j
three boys danced, they reminded *
me of the way the Three Little Pigs |
danced!" Another one of the chil- |
dren, Myron Hong, expressed the j
hope that we "will come and see us
