# Miranda Sings Latin Tunes in 'Rio Night'
## 
### 
"THAT NIGHT IN RIO," now
playing at (he Stanford Theater.
When you have a good movie plot,
complete with sex, humor and any
other things that are necessary to
such a movie plot, there's no use
letting it die out. When one gen
eration grows up and a new one
comes along, just revive any old
show, add a modern touch to it, get
it by the Hays office, and you've got
a good production.
Evidently 20th Century-Fox agrees
with that philosophy, for they've
resurrected the plot of "Folies Ber
gere" (which came out about 1934,
we think), shifted the scene from
Paris to Rio, put Don Ameche in
Maurice Chevalier's place, touched
up things generally—more specific
ally, with Carmen Miranda — and
have produced an A-l musical
comedy.
The show is, of course, a sequel to
"Down Argentine Way," but is a dis
tinct improvement over that picture.
First of all, we have Alice Faye in
stead of Betty Grable; not much of
an improvement, we admit, but it's
something. Next, Don Ameche
spends most of his time in this one
playing the part of someone else,
and when Don Ameche isn't himself,
he's not a bad guy. (Yes, we got
mixed up, too.)
.And. thirdly, there's Carmen. The
little gal, whose hats look like a
Union fruit salad and whose figure
dees not look like a Union waitress,
really goes to town in this one. And,
oh yes, there's some new song hits
sung by Miles. Faye and Miranda
which round out the production (the
songs, we mean).
The companion picture is the lat
est chapter in the adventures of
Cisco Kid. Mary Beth Hughes mugs
some of the film space away from
Cesar Romero, and the result is—
just like all other Cisco movies. Eh.
Cisco?
