# Spring Show Roles Changed
## 
### 
Charlie Bulotti, director of the
1939 Gaieties and 1940 Spring Show,
stepped into Dana Winters' part in
"How's Your Circulation?" yester
day when Winters learned he would
be unable to play the role of Toots
Grinelli, the gangster.
Tickets for the show will go on
sale tomorrow morning on the Eng
lish Corner, according to Bob Rich,
dramatic manager. After tomorrow
| tickets may be purchased in the
A.S.S.U. office. Cast sale will be
held this afternoon.
One of the most important fea
i tures, in the performance a week
1 from tomorrow and Saturday nights,
according to Director Bud Cady, is
the fact that no microphones will be
used under any circumstances.
"Mikes not only cluster the action,
you can't do anything with the songs
themselves," Cady said. "And be
j sides all the danger of those ghastly
moments when the mike goes dead—
ias it always does—will be elimi-
I nated."
Four arrangers, Hal Moreno. Art
McCue, Myron Birnbaum, and Mar
ion Scott, are scoring the show. Cady
says that, as a result, they got the
songs almost before they needed
! them.
