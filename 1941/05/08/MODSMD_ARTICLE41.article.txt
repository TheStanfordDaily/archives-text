Willi a scathing criticism of the San Francisco Police Department, the
special investigating committee of the San Francisco Bar Commission re
ported its findings on the Barber-Allen heating case to that body yester
day. The criticism was part of a report forwarded by Eugene M. Prince,
head of the law group, to William P. Wobber, president of the Board of
Police Commissioners. A

Assuming from the testimony giv
en in the case, that the beating took
place in the Southern Station, the
investigators reported that the in
ability of the police department to
discover who did it "is a sad com
mentary on the ability of the San
Francisco Police Department to
ferret out and detect crime."
The committee, at the invitation
of the police commission, sat in on
all the hearings held on the charges
by two Stanford frosh that they were
beaten while under arrest at the
Southern Station on March 2.
They proceeded to draw a *ten
point conclusion from their observa
tion of the hearings.
Chief among these were that the
policemeu brought up as witnesses
Were not examined with the same
minuteness and accuracy " that the
youths were; that the identification
of Greene and Desmond by the
boys was so positive that it should
not have been ignored; and that the
alibi of one of the accused officers,
Greene (who said he was not in the
station at the time of the beating),
"proves nothing and is valueless."
