# Lunch Club Hears Talk on Lindbergh
## 
### 
"Never in the history of mankind
has anything been accomplished
without hurting somebody," is what
Secretary of War Stimson told Bill
Turner at the British Embassy in
Washington. Turner spoke at the
regular Wednesday noon meeting of
the Luncheon Club on the subject
"The Menace, Lindbergh?"
The administration in Washington
believes that Britain's war is our
'war. "Since they are in power, that
is the opinion that is acceptable,"
said Turner. Lindbergh's opinion is
that we can't defend America by
sending things we need abroad.
Therefore, according to Turner, even
though Lindbergh and the admin
istration both want to defend Amer
ica, Lindbergh can't say what he
thinks because he doesn't happen to
be in power.
Stimson, spokesman for the admin
istration, in reply to Turner's ques
tion as to how the war was progress
ing, said, "My boys, the day of giv
ing gifts has passed. And we Ameri
cans will have to make up our
minds about the war situation."

The University of California with
drew from the California Rugby
Union in 1913, a move which was
unanimously approved by the Union.
