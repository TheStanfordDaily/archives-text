## CHUCK SMITH, Sports Editor Indians Set For Trojan Track Battle 
### 
The Stanford-U.S.C. dual meet
Saturday looks like a closer battle
every time we look at the entries.
It seems Dean Cromwell is short
on weight men and will be forced
to go along with only Carl Merritt
in the shot and discus. Merritt, a
transfer from Modesto J.C., where '
he was a teammate of Moose Thomp
son, can get the shot out over 51
feel; but Emerson Hik/ on a good j
day can take the S.C. boy in the j
discus.
SEED'S LAST RUN
Leroy Weed may concentrate on
the mile, and the only other Trojan
who does much in the distances is
Mel Barry. Aub Seed runs his last
dual meet two-mile this week-end,
and could win it. Aub doesn't par- '
ticularly care to run all afternoon
and no one can blame him. He has
worked hard all year, has gotten
down around 9:50 and deserves to
win this Saturday.
Yesterday at Angell Field, Francis
Olson and Burm Skrable ran a
].'i2o in ;J:11.2, excellent time for the
three laps. Olson may be used in
mile instead of the hair.
HVDE IN CONDITION
Blair Hyde is getting into good
shape for his battle with Warren
Smith in the half-mile which should
be a honey. Captain Ernie Clark is
his old self once again and he's going
to be ready to go against his rival '
captain, Howard Upton of the Tro
jans, in the 440.
Vic Chambers didn't show up at
practice yesterday, and with Thor
Peterson out, Gene Kern may have
to carry the broad-jumping load.
Gene has done 23-6 lately, and will
need his best effort against Kenny j
Wren, Mel Bleeker, and Coach
Cromwell's son.
TROJAN FAVORITES
Stanford may ring up a bigger
point total than many fans expect;
but the Trojans are going to have |
their own way in two or three j
events—so they're heavy favorites. !
In the high jump, usually a strong j
Stanford event, the Trojans will
have Gil LaCava, who set a world's j
interscholastic record at Beverly J
Hills High, fell off last year to a mere 1
6 feet G inches, and is back again j
this year better than ever. Johnny
Wilson has been hurt and nobody j
knows just what he can do. When !
he's right, Wilson hits 6-9. Vern
Hart and Jim Lincoln have marks j
of 6-5. The two Indians will make i
it tough for S.C. all the way.

to go along with only Carl Merritt
in the shot and discus. Merritt, a
transfer from Modesto J.C., where '
he was a teammate of Moose Thomp
son, can get the shot out over 51
feel; but Emerson Hik/ on a good j
day can take the S.C. boy in the j
discus.
SEED'S LAST RUN
Leroy Weed may concentrate on
the mile, and the only other Trojan
who does much in the distances is
Mel Barry. Aub Seed runs his last
dual meet two-mile this week-end,
and could win it. Aub doesn't par- '
ticularly care to run all afternoon
and no one can blame him. He has
worked hard all year, has gotten
down around 9:50 and deserves to
win this Saturday.
Yesterday at Angell Field, Francis
Olson and Burm Skrable ran a
].'i2o in ;J:11.2, excellent time for the
three laps. Olson may be used in
mile instead of the hair.
HVDE IN CONDITION
Blair Hyde is getting into good
shape for his battle with Warren
Smith in the half-mile which should
be a honey. Captain Ernie Clark is
his old self once again and he's going
to be ready to go against his rival '
captain, Howard Upton of the Tro
jans, in the 440.
Vic Chambers didn't show up at
practice yesterday, and with Thor
Peterson out, Gene Kern may have
to carry the broad-jumping load.
Gene has done 23-6 lately, and will
need his best effort against Kenny j
Wren, Mel Bleeker, and Coach
Cromwell's son.
TROJAN FAVORITES
Stanford may ring up a bigger
point total than many fans expect;
but the Trojans are going to have |
their own way in two or three j
events—so they're heavy favorites. !
In the high jump, usually a strong j
Stanford event, the Trojans will
have Gil LaCava, who set a world's j
interscholastic record at Beverly J
Hills High, fell off last year to a mere 1
6 feet G inches, and is back again j
this year better than ever. Johnny
Wilson has been hurt and nobody j
knows just what he can do. When !
he's right, Wilson hits 6-9. Vern
Hart and Jim Lincoln have marks j
of 6-5. The two Indians will make i
it tough for S.C. all the way.
The Stanford-U.S.C. dual meet
Saturday looks like a closer battle
every time we look at the entries.
It seems Dean Cromwell is short
on weight men and will be forced
to go along with only Carl Merritt
in the shot and discus. Merritt, a
transfer from Modesto J.C., where '
he was a teammate of Moose Thomp
son, can get the shot out over 51
feel; but Emerson Hik/ on a good j
