# Soccermen Prep For Squad Meet
## 
### 
Spring soccer practice has been
going for four weeks and although
the squad is unofficially divided
into four teams Coach Harry Ma
loney is still looking for next fall's
starting combination.
Next week the annual inter-class
competition will start with the squad
divided by classes. The graduate
students who now help run the team
are seriously considering entering a
team in this competition.
