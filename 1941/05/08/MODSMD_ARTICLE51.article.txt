# Gridders Show Sparkle In Afternoon Scrimmage
## 
### DON SELBY 
A cool wind Mew across the practice gridiron yesterday. And it was a
good thing it did for Coach Clark Shaughnessy sent his perspiring squad
through a heavy-duty workout with the second scrimmage of the spring
campaign.
There were quite a few rest sessions during the afternoon, hut when a

team was working it really
down, and the Indian gridders took |
another .step along the path to at
taining the near-perfection that was
theirs last fall.
Following a 45-minute dummy
scrimmage session, Coach Shaugh- !
nessy blew his whistle at 5 o'clock
sharp to send his outfit into a real
slam-bang scrum that saw three I
teams take turns on offense against
two defensive elevens.
VOOS' REPLACES NORM
Highlighting the first part of the i
scrimmage, when the first team j
worked their stuff, y/us the pound- 1
ing running of fullback Milt Vuci
nieh. Time and again "Voos" tore '
through the line, shaking tacklers j
and driving ahead in a style that
made the handful of spectators pre
sent think that perhaps the Indians
wouldn't miss the great Norm Stand
lee as much as they feared.
The early-season blocking and
tackling wasn't as sharp and deadly
as it was during the fall campaign,
but at the present rate of progress
it should be before the 30 spring
practice sessions are completed.
SECONDS GOOD
When the blue-clad second eleven J
took over the offense, once again il j
was a trio of backfield men that I
showed their wares in impressive
fashion, as Bill Ravetto, Bob Dit
levson, and A1 Cole took their turn
at scampering through holes in the
defensive line and secondary.
Strangely enough, however, tiny
A] Cole made the biggest impression
by a pair of blocks he tossed on
Tony Medved, the defensive line
backer. One bystander explained
that the tall Medved probably
couldn't see Cole coming after him
and was therefore easy prey for thv
block.
The twisting, squirming running
of Ravetto and the drive of Ditlev
son gained yards for the Blues more
than once. One time after -Ditlev
son, working from the right half
spot, picked up 15 yards on a crack
inside the defensive tackle, Shaugh
nessy called out: "What's the matter
with that now? Boy, that's all right!"
Late in the afternoon fullback
Bob Crane grabbed the spotlight as
he broke into the clear after he had
apparently been stopped at the line
and again in the secondary. He was
off to the races when Coach Shaugh
nessy's whistle brought him back.
Working with the first team were:
Arn Meiners and Fred Meyer at
ends; Ed Stamm and Bruno Ban
ducci at tackles; Chuck Taylor and
Jack Francis at guards; Frankie
Albert at quarter; Pete Kmetovic
and Eric Armstrong at halves; and
Vucinich at full.
The second outfit was made up of
Bob Mastin and Bill Symes. ends;
Ed Johannessen, Bob Millington,
and Bill Mannon, tackles; Ken Ro
besky and Ed McCain, guards; Doug
Stable, center; Ray Hammett, quar
terback; Ravetto and Cole alternat
ing at left half; Ditlevson and Buck
Fawcett alternating at right half;
and Crane, fullback.

was a trio of backfield men that I
showed their wares in impressive
fashion, as Bill Ravetto, Bob Dit
levson, and A1 Cole took their turn
at scampering through holes in the
defensive line and secondary.
Strangely enough, however, tiny
A] Cole made the biggest impression
by a pair of blocks he tossed on
Tony Medved, the defensive line
backer. One bystander explained
that the tall Medved probably
couldn't see Cole coming after him
and was therefore easy prey for thv
block.
The twisting, squirming running
of Ravetto and the drive of Ditlev
son gained yards for the Blues more
than once. One time after -Ditlev
son, working from the right half
spot, picked up 15 yards on a crack
inside the defensive tackle, Shaugh
nessy called out: "What's the matter
with that now? Boy, that's all right!"
Late in the afternoon fullback
Bob Crane grabbed the spotlight as
he broke into the clear after he had
apparently been stopped at the line
and again in the secondary. He was
off to the races when Coach Shaugh
nessy's whistle brought him back.
Working with the first team were:
Arn Meiners and Fred Meyer at
ends; Ed Stamm and Bruno Ban
ducci at tackles; Chuck Taylor and
Jack Francis at guards; Frankie
Albert at quarter; Pete Kmetovic
and Eric Armstrong at halves; and
Vucinich at full.
The second outfit was made up of
Bob Mastin and Bill Symes. ends;
Ed Johannessen, Bob Millington,
and Bill Mannon, tackles; Ken Ro

Stable, center; Ray Hammett, quar
terback; Ravetto and Cole alternat

Fawcett alternating at right half;
and Crane, fullback.
A cool wind Mew across the practice gridiron yesterday. And it was a
good thing it did for Coach Clark Shaughnessy sent his perspiring squad
through a heavy-duty workout with the second scrimmage of the spring
campaign.
There were quite a few rest sessions during the afternoon, hut when a

team was working it really
down, and the Indian gridders took |
another .step along the path to at
taining the near-perfection that was
theirs last fall.
Following a 45-minute dummy
scrimmage session, Coach Shaugh- !
nessy blew his whistle at 5 o'clock
sharp to send his outfit into a real
slam-bang scrum that saw three I
teams take turns on offense against
two defensive elevens.

through the line, shaking tacklers j
and driving ahead in a style that
made the handful of spectators pre

wouldn't miss the great Norm Stand

The early-season blocking and
tackling wasn't as sharp and deadly

it should be before the 30 spring
