IT'S a funny feeling watching a tradition being
born.
And yet plus two thousand Stanford Roughs
and Farmerettes, jam-packing Frost Memorial
Amphitheater last night, saw just that happen.
The Farm's first singfest was a howling suc
cess.
With Rally Committee's "guaranteed moon"
and the flicker of torches lighting the impressive
inner vista of the amphitheater, the singfest was
given a setting and a tone that sent the evening
away to a flying start.
And with that success in mind, it's rather
strange to reflect upon the huge successes and
the splendid turnouts which similar get-togeth
ers have for years enjoyed on many of the
major college campuses both on the Pacific
Coast and back East—and then realize that it
took us an awfully long time to shake away
that lethargy of ours.
But that's all over now. Singfests are in at
Stanford.
It was the type of close-knit sort of fun-mak
ing that pulls a campus together. It was the
sort of time that proves that evenings in the
city can be the exception rather than the rule.
The audience had a whale of a time. The
assorted groups on the amphitheater stage did
also.
And, to complete the picture, there were some
darned good exhibitions of group singing going
on too.
It just shows to go you.
