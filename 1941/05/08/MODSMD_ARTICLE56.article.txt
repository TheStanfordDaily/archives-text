# Tell Us More . . .

WTT'S a remarkable thing," mused both the
1 incoming and outgoing A.S.S.U. presidents
at Tuesday evening's Excom meeting, "the ad
vantages and improvements that other univer
sity student bodies are striving for are the things
that Stanford is already enjoying."
The two student leaders were outlining the
high points of their recent trip to the Pacific Stu
dent Presidents' Association, held last week in
the southland.
Sort of snaps you awake with a bang.
The business end of the student presidents'
convention was wrapped around a series of
meetings, in which mutual problems were
hashed over and solutions presented for con
sideration.
Then, and again we rephrase the words of
the Farm's representatives, "they came around
and asked us about the things that we've been
taking for granted for years."
Yes, Stanford student government is strides
ahead of a great many of its contemporaries.
And in spite of vexing difficulties and tribula
tions which still arise, now and then something
like this arises to make us realize that fact..
The best comment comes last.
"Say," said several of these student body
presidents, "I regret more and more that I didn't
come to Stanford."
