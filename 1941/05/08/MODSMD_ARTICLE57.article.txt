# Enough Is Enough

### 
IT doesn't take a Mr. Fagan or a Mr. Boggs
to tell your stomach that the first dish of
strawberry ice cream tastes delicious and that
the thirty-first dish has lost its charm, despite
the fact that this illustration falls within the con
fusing economic scope of marginal productivity.
People get tired of too much ice cream. They
also get tired of too much entertainment.
That seems to be the perennial problem at
Stanford during each spring quarter. The
weather is warm, summer is just around the next
couple of weeks. And so, naturally, everybody
wants to entertain. The result is a gush of cam
pus drives, picnics, beach parties, bridge tour
naments, aquacades, dances—and so on well
into the next column if we had the space to print
them all.
By the middle of the quarter, Stanford stu
dents find that the marginal productivity of the
given product, entertainment, has already
reached its peak and is on its way back to the
zero-axis again.
This situation—perhaps it is a problem—has
become particularly pressing now that Conva
lescent Home Week has been moved into the
already-crammed days of spring quarter.

You can't mistake the handwriting on the
wall. With no reflection on the industrious com
mitteemen, it must be admitted that neither the
Back to the Farm Dance nor the Junior Prom
were the tremendous successes they might have
been had they been given, for example, in the
dance-lean weeks of winter quarter. These are
just two of the examples which pop to mind.
There are many more.
Enough is enough. Too much is too much.—
B. A.
