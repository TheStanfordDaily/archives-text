is here finally. Those "dog days" we have
k been awaiting have finally arrived. Studying is
becoming progressively more difficult; the lake is in
viting. And Stanford continues to worry about the
war situation.
The campus rises up in defense of Col. Charles A.
Lindbergh; Dirstine writes his usual campus opinion
with numerous holes in his logic; he is refuted today
by a man whose logic contains an equal number of
gaps; Weymouth, who is a strong non-interventionist
and writes about the same number of letters to the
editor as Dirstine, blasts the Gallup poll results that
show 68 per ccnt of the people wanting to go to war.
Then Weymouth ridiculously asks whether "the coun
try is based on rule by ballots or by Gallups."

Â£NASMUCH as the Gallup poll predicted the results
of the recent presidential election with an infinitesi
mal margin of error, Mr. Weymouth does not seem
to have a point worth mentioning. Lest I seem un
duly critical of these above-mentioned men, let me
say that actually I greatly admire them even though
I disagree with most of them. They at least have
enough strength of conviction to sign their names,
while the majority of the indignant student commen
tators protect their convictions under pseudonyms.
But the ridiculous is not confined to the Stanford
campus. Yesterday Secretary of War Stimson
emerged from a secret cabinet meeting and said that
America would not permit munitions to be sunk in
the Atlantic Ocean. Hell no, Germany, step aside and
let tons of death float right into English ports.

WPRING is here and every day the lake is crowded
v with swimmers and canoes. But students continue
to make plans to take their places in the Selective
Service Army. Other men, who weren't of age last
October 16 but have since become 21 years old, are
preparing for the next sign-up on June 14, wonder
ing just where they will fit into the general scheme.
And while they wonder, American concerns line
Pacific Coast piers with tons of oil and munitions for
Japanese consumption. Our taxpayers' money is loan
ed to the desperately-fighting Chinese democracy to
wage their war against Japan. But individual Ameri
cans supply the Japanese with the materials that may
some day kill Americans, that now are killing Chi
nese peasants fighting a war for the same principle as
England, or perhaps even a more commendable prin
ciple.

is it all about? I don't know. Not many
students do know, I imagine. I do have convic
tions that I entertain as strongly as Dirstine, Wey
mouth, and Weis entertain theirs, and perhaps I'm as
illogical as I think they are.
And I don't like to see barrels of oil stacked on
American wharves awaiting shipment to enemies of
the countries we are supposedly aiding with our en
tire economic strength.
