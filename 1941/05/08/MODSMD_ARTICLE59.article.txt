## THE

r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
It seems a blot on the fair(?) escutcheon of Phi
Delta Theta that its puerile members have nothing
better to do with their time than to throw water bags
at innocent passersby.
0.K., say I'm a kill-joy, fun's fun and all that; but
when a girl tries her darnedest to look clean and
neat, and spends as much money as she can possibly
afford to keep summer dresses laundered (and I
haven't much money), it's a travesty on the good man
ners of the Row men that she can't walk down the
street, minding her own business, and not be splat
tered with mud and water . . . clean dress soaked,
stockings splattered, and white shoes a mess.
I can't suggest any cure, I'm afraid, but it does
seem a pity that some people spend $130 a quarter
just to loaf on a house roof and spoil other people's
afternoons.
Disgustedly,
M.J.
