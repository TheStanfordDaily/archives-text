# LISTEN, MR. DIRSTINE
## 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
I should like to point out a few things that Phil
Dirstine overlooked in writing his letter to The Daily
yesterday. Some of Mr. Dirstine's opinions are, I
think, typical of many Americans today. These arc
the Americans who jump to conclusions without ex
amining the facts, and who fall most easily for propa
ganda.
The first statement I note as being exaggerated is:
". . . we are not strong enough to fight 500.000.000
people." Where Mr. Dirstine finds 500.000,000 people
I do not know. The population of Europe is 476,-
000,000, but certainly Mr. Dirstine does not believe
that all Europe would unite under Germany to fight
the United States. People are too resentful of their
conqueror to unite immediately under it to further
its glory. Next, the statement about "submitting to
slavery"—obviously put in for the effect. We would
have to be conquered first. And if Mr. Dirstine be
lieves that Hitler can or will conquer the United
States because "Mein Kampf" says that war is the
natural state of peoples (a rather flimsy argument, I
dare say) let him look at the facts which are nowhere
more beautifully laid out than in John T. Flynn's
article, "Can Hitler Invade America?" which can be
found in Reader's Digest, April 1941, page one. I
should like to prove the point that he could not, here,
but space and time do not permit.
Now I should like to attack two assumptions which
are in many people's minds—even my own until re
cently—and which come out in Mr. Dirstine's letter.
Everyone seems to assume that the United States has
only to send troops to England and the war is won.
No one seems to remember that when we went over in
1917 we were able to land in friendly France, but this
time, before anything could be accomplished, we would
have to land troops in hostile territory—namely, the
mainland of Europe. Please note that this same prob
lem—landing troops in hostile territory—is the same
one that has stumped the Germans for nearly a year
now. The other assumption is that, should Hitler in
vade America, the United States would automatically
be defeated. Why we should place so much confidence
in our army 3000 miles away from home on foreign
soil, and so little in it at home on familiar ground is
a mystery to me, so I shall not try to offer any expla
nation.

Now I should like to attack two assumptions which
are in many people's minds—even my own until re
cently—and which come out in Mr. Dirstine's letter.
Everyone seems to assume that the United States has
only to send troops to England and the war is won.
No one seems to remember that when we went over in
1917 we were able to land in friendly France, but this
time, before anything could be accomplished, we would
have to land troops in hostile territory—namely, the
mainland of Europe. Please note that this same prob
lem—landing troops in hostile territory—is the same
one that has stumped the Germans for nearly a year
now. The other assumption is that, should Hitler in
vade America, the United States would automatically
be defeated. Why we should place so much confidence
in our army 3000 miles away from home on foreign
soil, and so little in it at home on familiar ground is
a mystery to me, so I shall not try to offer any expla
nation.
Sincerely
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
I should like to point out a few things that Phil
Dirstine overlooked in writing his letter to The Daily
yesterday. Some of Mr. Dirstine's opinions are, I
think, typical of many Americans today. These arc
the Americans who jump to conclusions without ex
amining the facts, and who fall most easily for propa
ganda.
The first statement I note as being exaggerated is:
". . . we are not strong enough to fight 500.000.000
people." Where Mr. Dirstine finds 500.000,000 people
I do not know. The population of Europe is 476,-
000,000, but certainly Mr. Dirstine does not believe
that all Europe would unite under Germany to fight
the United States. People are too resentful of their
conqueror to unite immediately under it to further
its glory. Next, the statement about "submitting to
slavery"—obviously put in for the effect. We would
have to be conquered first. And if Mr. Dirstine be
lieves that Hitler can or will conquer the United
States because "Mein Kampf" says that war is the
natural state of peoples (a rather flimsy argument, I
dare say) let him look at the facts which are nowhere
more beautifully laid out than in John T. Flynn's
article, "Can Hitler Invade America?" which can be
found in Reader's Digest, April 1941, page one. I
should like to prove the point that he could not, here,
but space and time do not permit.
