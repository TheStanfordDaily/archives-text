HERE'S A PICTURE to introduce any amateur photographer who's
not likely to have equipment required to take it. This flying cadet,
about to take oil' into night at Randolph Field, Texas, where a train
ing program is on a day-night basis, was snapped with aid of three
million candle-power lights. Note how details show through the
whirling propeller.
