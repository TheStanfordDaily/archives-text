Into the cavernous silence of the
library reading room, a loud voicc
boomed forth.
''Come on boys and girls—we
will now dance." Strains of swing
music floated out from a portable
radio. First one, then a dozen
couples started dancing in the
little alcove ofT the periodical
room. Briskly a librarian walked
up to stop the noise. Seeing that
the situation was beyond control,
he obligingly disappeared. In the
middle of "The Blue Danube" a
bell rang.
The first Libe jolly-up was over.
