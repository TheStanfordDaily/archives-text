# Farm Honors Sam McDonald Saturday at Street Naming
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Saturday Stanford pays tribute to a man.
Sam McDonald, known officially as Superintendent of Athletic Build
ings and Grounds, but to almost every person he is known as just plain
"Sam."
They're going to name a street after Sam on Saturday, and Dr. Ray

>Lyman Wilbur will lead the cere
mony. From the northeast side of the
B.A.C. between the tennis courts and
Angell Field to the highway, that
street will hereafter be called "Sam
McDonald Street." The naming is set
for 11 o'clock in the morning.
Along about 1903 Sam pulled down
a job as a team driver here. In
1907 he was promoted to his present
position as superintendent.
MANY FRIENDS
Since that time when he took over
the care and supervision of the ath
letic grounds, Sam has possibly
made more friends here than any
other person.
During the lean years—when Stan
ford was almost picked clean of its
available man-power—Sam McDon
ald achieved his greatest accom
plishments in helping to put the
University back on its feet. If there
was a job to be done, Sam was al
ways on hand.
In 1917 he took into his own
hands the arranging and carrying
out of a gigantic singfest in which
10,000 troops from Camp Fremont,
which was situated at nearby Menlo,
paraded and drilled for an assem
bled multitude of 14,000 people —
considered a great crowd in those
days, at the old football stadium,
now site of the Stanford tennis
courts.
THE QUAKE
Sam can remember the San Fran
cisco quake as clearly as if it had
happened yesterday. Then night
watchman on Stanford's Palo Alto
Stock Farms, he retells a story of
panicky rumors that filtered back
from flimsy sources that the ferry
building in San Francisco had sunk
beneath the waters of the bay, of
the great numbers that were be
lieved dead on the campus, which
later proved to be only two, and of
the three-month period following
that banks were afraid to open their
vaults for fear of explosion by com
bustion and the resulting use of pa
per scrip for money .
So to Sam McDonald, friend of
everyone that knows him, goes the
naming of "Sam McDonald Street."

the three-month period following
that banks were afraid to open their
vaults for fear of explosion by com
bustion and the resulting use of pa
per scrip for money .
So to Sam McDonald, friend of
everyone that knows him, goes the
naming of "Sam McDonald Street."
Saturday Stanford pays tribute to a man.
Sam McDonald, known officially as Superintendent of Athletic Build
ings and Grounds, but to almost every person he is known as just plain
"Sam."
They're going to name a street after Sam on Saturday, and Dr. Ray

>Lyman Wilbur will lead the cere
mony. From the northeast side of the
B.A.C. between the tennis courts and
Angell Field to the highway, that
street will hereafter be called "Sam
McDonald Street." The naming is set
for 11 o'clock in the morning.
Along about 1903 Sam pulled down
a job as a team driver here. In
1907 he was promoted to his present
position as superintendent.
MANY FRIENDS
Since that time when he took over
the care and supervision of the ath
letic grounds, Sam has possibly
made more friends here than any
other person.
During the lean years—when Stan
ford was almost picked clean of its
available man-power—Sam McDon
ald achieved his greatest accom
plishments in helping to put the
University back on its feet. If there
was a job to be done, Sam was al
ways on hand.
In 1917 he took into his own
hands the arranging and carrying
out of a gigantic singfest in which
10,000 troops from Camp Fremont,
which was situated at nearby Menlo,
paraded and drilled for an assem
bled multitude of 14,000 people —
considered a great crowd in those
days, at the old football stadium,
now site of the Stanford tennis
courts.
THE QUAKE
Sam can remember the San Fran
cisco quake as clearly as if it had
happened yesterday. Then night
watchman on Stanford's Palo Alto
Stock Farms, he retells a story of
panicky rumors that filtered back
from flimsy sources that the ferry
building in San Francisco had sunk
beneath the waters of the bay, of
the great numbers that were be
lieved dead on the campus, which
later proved to be only two, and of
the three-month period following
that banks were afraid to open their
vaults for fear of explosion by com
bustion and the resulting use of pa
per scrip for money .
