HERE'S HOW YOU
CAN SUCCEED
MORE QUSCKIY
Shortcut to success—that's whqt
America's leaders say of secretarial
training.
Senator Barkley, Mayor LaGuardia, j
Billy Rose, Ethel Merman, Lillian Hell-
George S. Kaufman, Irwin Cobb, I
Vincent Bcndix—an army of others
opened the doors of achievement as i
secretaries.
Secretarial training placed them on
the payroll, brought them contact and
training with top executives, gave
them opportunities to demonstrate
their ability to key men who really j
counted.
No other position, they claim,
would have brought such swift recog
nition.
Success was theirs, because, first of '
all, "they were good secretaries." |
BUT, it takes more than knowledge of
shorthand and typing to make good
secretaries.
Businessmen know this—that's why
Grace Ball trained secretaries are in
such demand.
That's why every Grace Ball grad-
to date has been placcd in a
paying position.
That's why more positions were
offered us last year than we had
graduates to fill them.
That's why Cracc Ball graduates
have enjoyed an unequalled record of
succcss.
"You" will progress faster with
Grace Ball training. Ask us for proof. I
Come in today.
