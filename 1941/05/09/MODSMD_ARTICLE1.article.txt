HPHE Italian army officers who re
portedly arrived in Baghdad
yesterday are not going to do the
nearly shattered Iraqi army any
good unless they brought some air
planes and tanks with them. The
Mesopotamian forces, never too well
trained or equipped, have been
knocked completely out. of the air.
How desperate the Iraqi arc is shown
by the Cairo report that Rashid Ali
Bcg's troops have been leaving sig
nal flares burning every night at air
fields to guide any German troop
carrying planes.
Just why the Germans haven't
come is not clear. Perhaps they
think that the rout would be even
worse than that suffered hy the
British in Greece, since they would
have no time to lay out a concerted
plan of attack. A successful re
volt in the Near East in which
Nazi troops did not have to partici
pate would he a big help, without
the High Command's having
counted on it. Sort of a military
windfall.
In the light of the recent concilia
tory attitude being taken toward
Germany by the Turkish press, the
rush visit to Ankara by Naji Shaw
ket, the Iraqi Defense Minister, may
have far-reaching results. Shawket
is reported to be urgently attempt
ing to reopen negotiations for a
"federation" of Turkey and Iraq.

I IE is seeking Turkish aid under
the Saadabad Treaty — Turkey,
Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan — al
though this treaty provides no mili
tary clauses. Such a "federation,"
would probably envisage amalga
mation of foreign affairs, defense
and fiscal matters.
The Turks are in no position to
be too nasty to Germany now that
the Nazis have complete control
of the CJreek Island chain, on their
flank, clear down to the Italian
Dodecanese — unless they want to
fight under very adverse condi
tions.
On the other hand, a tie-up with
Iraq right now would mean the
Turks would clash with England.
They are in a very tricky position.
All their sympathies arc with Brit
ain and they have no bright-eyed
faith in Hitler's ability to keep his
promises.

r JPHE R.A.F. is well on its way
toward setting a record in num
bers of Nazi planes shot down. For
the first eight days of May they've
bagged 105 planes. The day raid
problem has been effectively solved
for some time, but they still haven't
been able to get any effective meth
od of solving the night bomber
problem.
Even this phenomenally high
catch is due to a brilliant May
moon, according to the London
authorities. These same quarters
add that the fighter planes arc in
creasing in effectiveness. Among
the fighters being used over there
are the American Douglas ships,
now called Havocs.
It's been reported that this plane,
when tested with a Hurricane in
mock-combat, came out best, but it
isn't being used too much in actual
combat yet because the British pilots
haven't the time to get the "feel" of
the faster plane.

Yjf/TIEN the British ambassador,
Lord Halifax, arrived in Chi
cago yesterday on the first leg of a
seven-day trip to test "public senti
ment in the American Midwest," he
was met by a group of feminine
pickets parading in front of his hotel
with anti-war placards. They were
from the America First Committee,
Citizens Keep Out of War Commit
tee, Mothers' Crusade, and We the
Mothers Mobilize.
This fact is interesting, but not
particularly significant since isola
tionist sentiments appear to be los
ing their strength. For instance,
Chicago is considered to be the sec
ond most isolationist city in America
by the America First Committee
(Milwaukee is first). Yet week be
fore last Lindbergh's America First
rally drew a crowd of 10,000 as op
posed to the Polish General Sikor
sky's 75.000. Sikorsky naturally is
for all-out aid.
It would seem that the ladies were
militant, but in the minority.
