# Frenchman Believes Combined Britain, U.S. Can Defeat Nazis

### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Europe's youth is not pleased with
its governments, it wanted and wants
change but does not know to what.
They are victims of powerful prop
aganda, according to Leon Cotnarea
nu, publisher of Le Figaro, a lead
ing Parisian newspaper, on a visit
to the campus yesterday.
"What thrills me most about
America is the youth — dynamic,
happy—and with a curiosity for
general problems—larger and more
intellectual than the peoples of Eu
rope had realized," Mr. Cotnareanu
explained. "There is a youthful
youth in America; an old youth in
Europe. Youth here is happy—it is
an American phenomenon, but call
it happiness," he added.
Distinguished and most charming,
the type we consider "typically
French," Mr. Cotnareanu arrived in
the United States eight months ago
by clipper and is visiting universi
ties throughout the nation to speak
with and study American youth.
What began yesterday as an in
terview of the visitor ended with
the reporters being interviewed by
the publisher, in the form of a
round-table discussion.
Mr. Cotnareanu wanted to know
how American youth felt about this
government, who it blamed for the
present world confusion, what it
wanted to do about it.

Disagreeing with the theory that
Great Britain cannot defeat Ger
many even with active American
participation, the French publisher
declared the combined productivity
and strength in naval and aerial
weapons of the two democracies ul
timately can tip the scale and defeat
Naziism.
"And as soon as there are some
encouraging events, all the subdued
nations in Europe will rise against
Germany," he predicted.
"Should America enter the war
now?"
"That is not for me to say," he
answeied. "It's up to America to
decide if she can stand a Nazi vic
tory without losing her independ
ence."
A British defeat means Germany
will control the seas and all world
markets, argued the Frenchman,
saying puppet governments will be
then established in South America.
"Germany will not allow Ajnerican
ships to travel the seas, not even to
South America," Mr. Cotnareanu
theorized.
"Even competing with Germany
economically means the lowering of
America's standard of living," he
continued.
And if the "Allies—America and
England" win the war?
"I advocate a commonwealth of
Anglo-Saxon nations to police the
world," he stated. "It will take sev
eral generations to educate the world
toward an international feeling, but
someone must watch. The national,
sovereign feeling must be reduced."
Mr. Cotnareanu explained that
the Allied victors would be so pow
erful at sea and in the air that they
could organize the world as "they
like." "It is their right and duty to
do this," he said.
But can England be trusted to do
this justly?" he was asked.
"England has changed its old pol
icy," he answered. "Yes, America
and England would do it together."
Mr. Cotnareanu's paper is still be
ing published in unoccupied Finance
—city of Lyons—although all news
is censored before publication. Le-
Figaro has been famous as always
advocating close French - British
collaboration.
Before traveling to Seattle, then
back East, Mr. Contareanu will visit
Stanford next week for another dis
cussion.

"That is not for me to say," he
answeied. "It's up to America to
decide if she can stand a Nazi vic
tory without losing her independ
ence."
A British defeat means Germany
will control the seas and all world
markets, argued the Frenchman,
saying puppet governments will be
then established in South America.
"Germany will not allow Ajnerican
ships to travel the seas, not even to
South America," Mr. Cotnareanu
theorized.
"Even competing with Germany
economically means the lowering of
America's standard of living," he
continued.
And if the "Allies—America and
England" win the war?
"I advocate a commonwealth of
Anglo-Saxon nations to police the
world," he stated. "It will take sev
eral generations to educate the world
toward an international feeling, but
someone must watch. The national,
sovereign feeling must be reduced."
Mr. Cotnareanu explained that
the Allied victors would be so pow
erful at sea and in the air that they
could organize the world as "they
like." "It is their right and duty to
do this," he said.
But can England be trusted to do
this justly?" he was asked.
"England has changed its old pol
icy," he answered. "Yes, America
and England would do it together."
Mr. Cotnareanu's paper is still be

Europe's youth is not pleased with
its governments, it wanted and wants
change but does not know to what.
They are victims of powerful prop
aganda, according to Leon Cotnarea
nu, publisher of Le Figaro, a lead
ing Parisian newspaper, on a visit
to the campus yesterday.
"What thrills me most about
America is the youth — dynamic,
happy—and with a curiosity for
general problems—larger and more
intellectual than the peoples of Eu
rope had realized," Mr. Cotnareanu
explained. "There is a youthful
youth in America; an old youth in
Europe. Youth here is happy—it is
an American phenomenon, but call
it happiness," he added.
Distinguished and most charming,
the type we consider "typically
French," Mr. Cotnareanu arrived in
the United States eight months ago
by clipper and is visiting universi
ties throughout the nation to speak
with and study American youth.
What began yesterday as an in
terview of the visitor ended with
the reporters being interviewed by
the publisher, in the form of a
round-table discussion.
Mr. Cotnareanu wanted to know
how American youth felt about this
government, who it blamed for the
present world confusion, what it
wanted to do about it.

Disagreeing with the theory that
Great Britain cannot defeat Ger
many even with active American
participation, the French publisher
declared the combined productivity
and strength in naval and aerial
weapons of the two democracies ul
timately can tip the scale and defeat
Naziism.
"And as soon as there are some
encouraging events, all the subdued
nations in Europe will rise against
Germany," he predicted.
"Should America enter the war
now?"
"That is not for me to say," he
answeied. "It's up to America to
decide if she can stand a Nazi vic
tory without losing her independ
ence."
A British defeat means Germany
