# Call P.A. 5171 For Alligator

### 
Do you want a baby alligator?
Robleite Eleanor Webster doesn't.
And she received an eight-inch, yel
low and black alligator by air mail
yesterday morning. It arrived in a
box punched with air holes and
marked "handle with care." The
postman told her that he had a fun
ny package for her. "It s an alli
gator, do you want it?" he asked.
Since she took it to her room she
has changed her mind about want
ing it.
"Stripey scares me to death, and
neither my roomies or the girls in
the corridor like it either," she said.
"Feeding it causes all the trouble.
It eats only when the weather is
warm; and then, if the alligator is
stubborn, I have to tickle its nose
to make it open its mouth.
I'm afraid it will bite when I put
food in," she added. A 'gator's diet
is fish and meat, but yesterday it
ate grated carrots and bread.
A draftee stationed in St. Augus
tine, Fla., sent Eleanor this novel
gift, but if it continues to crawl out
of its box and refuses to eat, she
will gladly give it to anyone who
will provide a good home for it,
preferably a fish bowl or pond. >
How about the D.U.'s? They have
a swimming pool.
