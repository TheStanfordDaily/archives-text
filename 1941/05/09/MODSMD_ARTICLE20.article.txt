## 
### 
Sons and daughters of Stanford
alumni will hold their annual picnic-
May 18 at the cabin of Sam McDon
ald, superintendent of grounds, in
whose honor a street will be named
Saturday. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Frank F. Walker, Almon
Roth and other administrative offi
cials will attend.
According to Jack Ditz, it all
started about, five years ago when
Mr. McDonald began meeting the
children of people he had known
and asking them all out to his place.
As the number of second genera
tion Stanfordites increased, these
picnics grew until the group finally
organized a few years ago as the
Sons and Daughters of Stanford
Alumni.
Any students whose parents at
tended Stanford and have not been
officially notified of the affair are
welcome to attend. The McDonald
home is located near La Honda.
