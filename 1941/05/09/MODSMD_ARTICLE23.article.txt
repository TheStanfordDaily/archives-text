WASHINGTON, May 8 (UP). â€”
British officials and American non
interventionists engaged in a sharp
dispute over British shipping losses
tonight as the United States moved
toward a showdown on the convoy
issue.
Intensifying the situation were re
ports confirmed by New York Mari
time circles that the British liner
Ixion and the Norwegian freighter
Eastern Star had been torpedoed 150
miles east of the southern tip of
Greenland.
This is well within President Roo
sevelt's newly defined neutrality
patrol zone which is said to extend
at least 2,000 miles out into the At
lantic.
