Do yon suffer from scaly scalp? Have ytin helpless hair? See Verna
Belle Maroney for Luscious Locks.
That is one of the advertisements on the liable bulletin hoards, put there
for a joke by Veum's friends. It is bringing in customers so fast that she

thus to turn them away.
Verna's parents both have birth
j days this month, and she thought
ihe would give them presents
bought with money that she had
earned herself.
While washing her hair with a
water-softener the other night, she
conceived the idea of shampooing
other chlorine-baffled Robleites to
gel the money. As soon as she fin

That first customer was a "walk
ing advertisement." Now Verna's
washing two and three heads an
evening as well as doing her home
work.
"The only thing I'm afraid of,"
she said, "is that my father will
write and tell me to give the money
back to the girls, so if you see me
running around handing out money
that's the reason."
The helpless-hair person kneels in
front of a bath tub on a half-filled
laundry bag. Vern filters a bucket
full of water in her water-softener
and pours it over the victim. Then
comes soap, more water, soap, more
water, and vinegar.
BUSINESS DEAL
After the object of attention has
been revived, Verna puts a finger
wave in (bring your own bobby
pins), and then ties a net on. Verna
is thinking about arranging a deal
with the girl on the floor above, who
owns a hair drier, but nothing has
been done as yet.
"I'm not going into competition
j with the barber at Encina. I'm not
even copying him," she declares.
"This is an entirely different sort
of business."
