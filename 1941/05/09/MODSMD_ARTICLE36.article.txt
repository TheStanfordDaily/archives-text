# Trojan Trackmen Invade Farm as Heavy Favorites
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
F»r the nth year in sucrcssion, the University of Southern California
has tlie hest track team in the nation.
The Terrible Trojans invade Stanford tomorrow for a dual meet with
our Indians; and the visitors bring with them an awesome record, high
lighted by a thoroughly convincing victory over Gal's "liest ever."

Year in and year out, Dean Crom
well turns up with a powerful ag
gregation that sweeps all competi
tion before it. Last spring, Stanford
had one of the finest teams ever
seen. They won the Long Beach Re
lays, Fresno Relays, walloped Cal,
Olympic Club, and U.C.L.A. Then
along came the Trojans. This year
it has been the same story all over
again, with Cal in the "Beat Troy or
Bust." role. U.S.C. invariably comes
up with unknown hurdlers, sensa
tional pole vaulters, and a flock of
point winners, that Publicist A1 Wes
son won't tell you about until after
they've ruined your team.
40 POINTS GOAL
Pitch Johnson isn't silly enough to
hope for victory tomorrow; but he
does venture to say that the Indians
will do better than they did against
Cal. With a few come-through per
formances and a minimum of tough
luck, Stanford could ring up 40
points on the boys from the South
land. At any rate, there will be some
beautifully close races.
Captain Ernie Clark, ready for his
best effort after many weeks, goes
against Howard Upton in the 440.
Ernie ran 48.2 last week and has
looked wonderful in practice at An
gel 1 Field these past few days. With
Bourland concentrating on the
sprints, the race will be between
Clark and Upton, with Grunbock of
U.S.C. and Don McFarland battling
it out for the other place.
Unheralded at the first of the sea
son, Warren Smith comes to the
Farm with a great record. Smith
meets a fine middle distance man in
Blair Hyde. Blair is now in top
shape after having trouble with his
leg for some time. He is a smooth
runner to say the least, and it would
not be surprising to see him whip
his rival.
LARSEN GONE
Stanford will miss Kai Larsen in
the half-mile. Larsen dropped out
of school early this week because of
lack of funds.
Skrable and Olson have looked
good in practice this week and thev

may give Leroy Weed trouble in
the mile.
Stanford can't hold out much hope
for points in the hurdles, for S.C.
has John Biewener, Art Kacewicz,
Don Hommel, Art Laret, and Sam
Johnson to throw into the field
against Stanford's Vern Hart, Gene,
Kern, and John Eikelman, who will
carry the load in the absence of Ed
Hertel, down with sinus infection.
In the sprints, the Trojans look
too good with Cliff Bourland, Hu
bert Kearns, and Howard Callanan.
WATCH WILSON
Johnny Wilson, who jumps with
one shoe on, the other off; Gil La-
Cava, holder of the interscholastic
record; Jim Lincoln and Hart will
be entered in the feature field event
of the day. If Wilson is in good
shape, he may leave the other boys
several inches behind him.
The visitors have a one-man
weight squad consisting of Carl
Merritt, who is favored over A1 Grey
in the shot, and who will give Emer
son Hiler all the competition he
wants in the discus.
Bob Peoples, currently basking in
the shadow of Martin Biles, will ex
hibit his American record-holding
arm when he tangles with Bob ;
Stone in the javelin; another champ.
Will Schaefer, appears in the pole
vault.
An Indian relay combine of Clark,
Hyde, Skrable, and McFarland will
have hands full with S.C.'s Grun- J
bock, Smith. Upton, and Bourland.

had one of the finest teams ever
seen. They won the Long Beach Re
lays, Fresno Relays, walloped Cal,
Olympic Club, and U.C.L.A. Then
along came the Trojans. This year
it has been the same story all over
again, with Cal in the "Beat Troy or
Bust." role. U.S.C. invariably comes
up with unknown hurdlers, sensa
tional pole vaulters, and a flock of
point winners, that Publicist A1 Wes
son won't tell you about until after
they've ruined your team.
40 POINTS GOAL
Pitch Johnson isn't silly enough to
hope for victory tomorrow; but he
does venture to say that the Indians
will do better than they did against
Cal. With a few come-through per
formances and a minimum of tough
luck, Stanford could ring up 40
points on the boys from the South
land. At any rate, there will be some
beautifully close races.
Captain Ernie Clark, ready for his
best effort after many weeks, goes
against Howard Upton in the 440.
Ernie ran 48.2 last week and has
looked wonderful in practice at An
gel 1 Field these past few days. With
Bourland concentrating on the
sprints, the race will be between
Clark and Upton, with Grunbock of
U.S.C. and Don McFarland battling
it out for the other place.
Unheralded at the first of the sea
son, Warren Smith comes to the
Farm with a great record. Smith
meets a fine middle distance man in
Blair Hyde. Blair is now in top
shape after having trouble with his
leg for some time. He is a smooth
runner to say the least, and it would
not be surprising to see him whip
his rival.
LARSEN GONE
Stanford will miss Kai Larsen in
the half-mile. Larsen dropped out
of school early this week because of
lack of funds.
Skrable and Olson have looked
good in practice this week and thev

may give Leroy Weed trouble in
the mile.
Stanford can't hold out much hope
for points in the hurdles, for S.C.
has John Biewener, Art Kacewicz,
Don Hommel, Art Laret, and Sam
Johnson to throw into the field
against Stanford's Vern Hart, Gene,
Kern, and John Eikelman, who will
carry the load in the absence of Ed
Hertel, down with sinus infection.
In the sprints, the Trojans look
too good with Cliff Bourland, Hu
bert Kearns, and Howard Callanan.
WATCH WILSON
Johnny Wilson, who jumps with
one shoe on, the other off; Gil La-
Cava, holder of the interscholastic
record; Jim Lincoln and Hart will
be entered in the feature field event
of the day. If Wilson is in good
shape, he may leave the other boys
several inches behind him.
The visitors have a one-man
weight squad consisting of Carl
Merritt, who is favored over A1 Grey
in the shot, and who will give Emer
son Hiler all the competition he
wants in the discus.
Bob Peoples, currently basking in
the shadow of Martin Biles, will ex
hibit his American record-holding
arm when he tangles with Bob ;
Stone in the javelin; another champ.
Will Schaefer, appears in the pole
vault.
An Indian relay combine of Clark,
Hyde, Skrable, and McFarland will
have hands full with S.C.'s Grun- J
bock, Smith. Upton, and Bourland.
F»r the nth year in sucrcssion, the University of Southern California

The Terrible Trojans invade Stanford tomorrow for a dual meet with
our Indians; and the visitors bring with them an awesome record, high

point winners, that Publicist A1 Wes
son won't tell you about until after
they've ruined your team.
40 POINTS GOAL
Pitch Johnson isn't silly enough to
hope for victory tomorrow; but he
does venture to say that the Indians
will do better than they did against
Cal. With a few come-through per
formances and a minimum of tough
luck, Stanford could ring up 40
points on the boys from the South
land. At any rate, there will be some
beautifully close races.
Captain Ernie Clark, ready for his
best effort after many weeks, goes
against Howard Upton in the 440.
Ernie ran 48.2 last week and has
looked wonderful in practice at An
gel 1 Field these past few days. With
Bourland concentrating on the
sprints, the race will be between
Clark and Upton, with Grunbock of
U.S.C. and Don McFarland battling
it out for the other place.
Unheralded at the first of the sea
son, Warren Smith comes to the
Farm with a great record. Smith
meets a fine middle distance man in
Blair Hyde. Blair is now in top
shape after having trouble with his
leg for some time. He is a smooth
runner to say the least, and it would
not be surprising to see him whip
his rival.
LARSEN GONE
Stanford will miss Kai Larsen in
the half-mile. Larsen dropped out
of school early this week because of
lack of funds.
Skrable and Olson have looked
good in practice this week and thev

may give Leroy Weed trouble in
the mile.
Stanford can't hold out much hope
for points in the hurdles, for S.C.
has John Biewener, Art Kacewicz,
Don Hommel, Art Laret, and Sam
Johnson to throw into the field
against Stanford's Vern Hart, Gene,
Kern, and John Eikelman, who will
carry the load in the absence of Ed
Hertel, down with sinus infection.
In the sprints, the Trojans look
too good with Cliff Bourland, Hu
bert Kearns, and Howard Callanan.
WATCH WILSON
Johnny Wilson, who jumps with
one shoe on, the other off; Gil La-
Cava, holder of the interscholastic
record; Jim Lincoln and Hart will
be entered in the feature field event
of the day. If Wilson is in good
shape, he may leave the other boys
several inches behind him.
The visitors have a one-man
weight squad consisting of Carl
Merritt, who is favored over A1 Grey
in the shot, and who will give Emer
son Hiler all the competition he
wants in the discus.
Bob Peoples, currently basking in
the shadow of Martin Biles, will ex
hibit his American record-holding
arm when he tangles with Bob ;
Stone in the javelin; another champ.
Will Schaefer, appears in the pole
vault.
An Indian relay combine of Clark,
Hyde, Skrable, and McFarland will
have hands full with S.C.'s Grun- J
bock, Smith. Upton, and Bourland.
F»r the nth year in sucrcssion, the University of Southern California
has tlie hest track team in the nation.
The Terrible Trojans invade Stanford tomorrow for a dual meet with
our Indians; and the visitors bring with them an awesome record, high
lighted by a thoroughly convincing victory over Gal's "liest ever."

Year in and year out, Dean Crom
well turns up with a powerful ag
gregation that sweeps all competi
tion before it. Last spring, Stanford
had one of the finest teams ever
seen. They won the Long Beach Re
lays, Fresno Relays, walloped Cal,
Olympic Club, and U.C.L.A. Then
along came the Trojans. This year
it has been the same story all over
again, with Cal in the "Beat Troy or
Bust." role. U.S.C. invariably comes
up with unknown hurdlers, sensa
tional pole vaulters, and a flock of
point winners, that Publicist A1 Wes
son won't tell you about until after
they've ruined your team.
