# Frosh Picnic Set for May 24
## Program to Feature Cowboy-Lake Theme 
### 
As a climax to their first year at
Stanford University, members of
the Class of '44 will gather at Lake
Lagunita the afternoon of May 24
in the Last Roundup of the 1940-41
school year.
Featuring a cowboy-lake combina
tion theme, the day will be the last
time the entire class can get to
gether as a unit for its own celebra
tion before the end of the quarter,
and before it splits up into its various
living groups next year.
Chairman of the affair is Ted
Eberle, assisted by Jim Ellis, presi
dent, and Marjoric Gestring, secre
tary of the freshman class.
Preparations for a full program
on the lake followed by a picnic din
ner are already virtually complete
under the direction of Pat Chub
buck and Bruce Lyon, co-chairmen
of the program committee, and
Johnny Harter and Pat Smith, co
chairmen of the food committee.
Anne Alton and Ferris Boothe head
the publicity committee.
Featuring swimming races, canoe
races, and canoe tilting for every
body as well as exhibitions of
comic diving and gunwaling, a var
ied program is being prepared. A
Roble beauty contest is also being
considered under the direction of
Virginia Reagan.
There will be dancing on the top
of the boathouse most of the after
noon as a warm-up for the night's
program of dances.
Originally scheduled last month as
a picnic with the California fresh
men, a conflict with the Convalescent
Home Drive forced its cancellation.
Since California gets out in a week,
the picnic will be exclusively for
Stanford freshmen as their final so
cial event of the year.
