### CHUCK SMITH 
_ track fans are going
2 to be pleased and satisfied to
-1 morrow if their team can take about
2 'three or four first places against the
might of U.S.C. and move in for
enough seconds and thirds to score
around 40 points.
How does this look as a logical
dope sheet showing how Coach
Pitch Johnson and his crew could do
just this?
100-yard dash—Bourland (SC),
Kearns (SC), Grant (S). '
220-yard dash — Bourland (SC),
Grant (S), Callanan (SC).
440-yard dash—Clark (S), Upton
(SC), MacFarland (S).
880-yard run—Smith (SC), Hyde
(S), Skrable (S).
Mile run—Weed (SC), Olson (S),
j Barry (SC).
2-mile run—Weed (SC), Seed (S),
j Copeland (SC).
120-yard H.II. — Biewener (SC),
: Kacewicz (SC), Hommell (SC).
220-yard L.II. — Johnson (SC),
Laret (SC), Kern (S).
Shot put—Merritt (SC), Grey (S),
Stamm (S).
! Discus—Hiler (S), Merritt (SC),
I Stamm (S).
Javelin—Peoples (SC), Stone (S),
: Himovitz (S).
High jump—Wilson (SC), LaCava
j (SC), Hart (S).
Broad jump — Chambers (S),
I Blocker (SC), Kern (S).
Pole vault—Schaefer (SC), Dud
! ley (SC). Peck (S).
lit lay—Southern California.
1 r final score of such a meet I
i would be U.S.C. 89 to Stan- '
i ford's 42.
But on this dope sheet there is
plenty of room for Cardinal im
| provement. For instance, A1 Grey
i might take the favored Carl Mer
ritt in the shot, Johnny Grant may
sneak in for a second or even a win
in the hundred, Blair Hyde could
match the challenge of Troy's sopho
more Warren Smith in the half
mile and give the Indians another
first place.
