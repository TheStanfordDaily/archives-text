# Vucinich Tears Off Big Gains
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity football team
ran through another spring practice
drill yesterday afternoon, starting
out with a 40-minute workout on
some nc-w plays given out by Coach
Clark Shaughnessy, and winding up
with a fast hour of scrimmage in
which every man in uniform saw
action.
The workout was featured by the
fine work of backs and ends, with
Milt Vucinich tearing off some nice
gains through the center of the line
from his fullback position, "Crunch"
Crane making several good runs and
doing a whale of a job on defense
and "Perfect Pete" Kmetovic play
ing up to his usual style from the
left halfback position.
Particularly impressive was the
work of Bob Ditlevsen from the
right half spot left vacant by the
graduation of the great Hugh Gal
larneau. Subbing for Eric Arm
strong after Hoot had suffered a
slight back injury, Dit's work was
particularly outstanding in view of
the fact that he has plaj'ed end until
the last two weel<s. Members of the
coaching staff were heard to com
ment that he will see more action as
a back than he did as an end during
the season just passed.
Bill Brubaker, end on the 1940
frosh aggregation, showed up well
on defense, playing a slashing type
ol game that marks him as a definite
threat for a varsity spot. Contrast
ing with his was the work of Hank
Norberg and Arnie Meiners on of
fense. Both playing left end, these
boys are big and rugged, and will
see a great deal more action during
the coming campaign than they did
last year. At right end it was again
Freddy Meyer who led the pack.
Big, fast and a good pass receiver,
Meyer will be a hard man to beat
out.
