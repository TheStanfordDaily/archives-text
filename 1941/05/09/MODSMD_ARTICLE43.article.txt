# Theta Dells, Phi Psis Win
## 
### 
Lop-sided scores featured yester
day's intramural baseball play as
the Theta Delt sol'tballers shellacked
El Cuadro, 15 to 0, and the Phi Psi
hardball nine topped Sigma 'Nu, 33
to 0.
Behind the three-hit pitching of
Jerry Jansen, the Theta Delts rapped
out 12 hits and capitalized on G
El Cuadro errors to win easily. Ken
ny Moulton hit a home run in the
seventh frame. Second sacker Dale
Snyder hit two for two and reached
base three other times on Cuadro
errors, scoring 4 runs.
Already mural basketball champs,
Phi Psi gave indication that they
may repeat in hardball by slaugh
tering Sigma Nu in a game called
in the second inning. With Tiff Den
ton doing tTie pitching and Denton,
Morgan Noble, and Dick Compton
banging out home runs, the Phi Psi's
just weren't to be stopped.
Excellent fielding support behind
the pitching of Marshall Weigel gave
El Toro a 5 to 1 victory over Alpha
Sig. The indomitable Bull Ses
sioner, Jerry Mayer, relaxed from
his journalistic duties to do the re
ceiving for Weigel, who also hit a
home run with one on in the fifth
frame.
Chi Psi edged the Kappa Alphas, 5
to 1.
