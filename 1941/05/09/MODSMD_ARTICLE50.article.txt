### 
SUNDAY afternoon in the lobbies of Roble
Stanford toasts Miss Mary Yost as a tribute
to her twenty years of service to the University.
Miss Yost came to Stanford in 1921 as Dean
of five hundred women. During the time she
has held that position the branch of the under
graduate family beneath her has more than
doubled.
Every branch of the Stanford Family, how
ever, has benefited by the sincere service which
Dean Mary has given this University during
those two decades. And through her assistance
to alumni, members of the faculty and students,
Stanford has flourished.
Both the men and women of the Farm have
gained immeasurably by the impress of her
presence during those twenty years as Dean
of Women. Her genuine friendliness, her frank
understanding, and her sincere interest in every
one have given her an assured place in the
names of those whom Stanford loves.
How well Dean Mary has succeeded will be
demonstrated in some small part Sunday when
close to one thousand of the students, faculty
and the administration whom she has served
so long meet to pay her tribute.
To the students who gather at Roble Sunday
the occasion will be more than a toast to the
leader who has so well served them. To them
it will be a testimony to the understanding sym
pathy of a real friend.
Thank you, Miss Yost. From all of us.
