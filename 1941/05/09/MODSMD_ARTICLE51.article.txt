# Youthful Youth
## 
### 
AMERICAN college youth yesterday received
a healthy pat on the back yesterday from
a man who has studied and knows the condi
tions, feelings and faults of the youth in Euro
pean countries —not only the youth of France,
his home country, but also of Germany and
Great Britain.
This man who was "thrilled" by American
youth is Leon Cotnareanu, publisher of what
was once one of the leading newspapers of
Paris, Le Figaro.
The whole story of his interview with Daily
reporters is on page one. Many of his state
ments on the war are not new to American
readers, but what he says as a result of his
eight months' study of youth in this country as
a comparison between us and the youth of
Europe has the effect of a swift punch, straight
ening us up to take note—not with alarm but
with pride.
"Dynamic—happy—intellectual—with a curi
osity for general problems"—these are words
he repeated several times in describing us.
And when describing to us the youth of his
own country and other countries of Europe, the
adjectives he had to use were just about dia
metrically opposed to those above.
"They are dissatisfied with their government
- they want a change—they do not know what
they want—they are the victims of a powerful
propaganda."
He laid great emphasis on his finding that
wherever he went the youth of America are
enthusiastically satisfied with the democratic
form of government and none want a change.
He called us a "youthful youth," terming our
European counterparts an "old youth."
"An American phenomenon," he called it.
Our college informality also was new to Mr.
Cotnareanu. He had never heard of professors
calling students by their "small names." He
contrasted this with the severity of European
colleges the professor's secretary comes to the :

classroom, sees that all the students are in their
places, then announces the arrival of the pro
fessor. "There is never an informal contact
between them."
Co-education, something never practiced in
Europe, also received his warm plaudits.
The striking feature of the whole thing is to
have such a contrast brought so forcefully to
our minds. We in college often consider our
selves in a very favorable position; we also feel
that the youth of any country play an important
part in the synthesis of the country.
The revelation of these facts to us cannot but
make us feel that these unhealthy conditions
of the youth of Europe are probably to no small
degree responsible for the unhealthy condition
of Europe as a whole.—C. B.

AMERICAN college youth yesterday received
a healthy pat on the back yesterday from
a man who has studied and knows the condi
tions, feelings and faults of the youth in Euro
pean countries —not only the youth of France,
his home country, but also of Germany and
Great Britain.
This man who was "thrilled" by American
youth is Leon Cotnareanu, publisher of what
was once one of the leading newspapers of
Paris, Le Figaro.
The whole story of his interview with Daily
reporters is on page one. Many of his state
ments on the war are not new to American
readers, but what he says as a result of his
eight months' study of youth in this country as
a comparison between us and the youth of
Europe has the effect of a swift punch, straight
ening us up to take note—not with alarm but
with pride.
"Dynamic—happy—intellectual—with a curi
osity for general problems"—these are words
he repeated several times in describing us.
And when describing to us the youth of his
own country and other countries of Europe, the
adjectives he had to use were just about dia
metrically opposed to those above.
"They are dissatisfied with their government
- they want a change—they do not know what
they want—they are the victims of a powerful
propaganda."
He laid great emphasis on his finding that
wherever he went the youth of America are
enthusiastically satisfied with the democratic
form of government and none want a change.
He called us a "youthful youth," terming our
European counterparts an "old youth."
"An American phenomenon," he called it.
Our college informality also was new to Mr.
Cotnareanu. He had never heard of professors
calling students by their "small names." He
contrasted this with the severity of European
colleges the professor's secretary comes to the :

classroom, sees that all the students are in their
places, then announces the arrival of the pro
fessor. "There is never an informal contact
between them."
Co-education, something never practiced in
Europe, also received his warm plaudits.
The striking feature of the whole thing is to
have such a contrast brought so forcefully to
our minds. We in college often consider our
selves in a very favorable position; we also feel
that the youth of any country play an important
part in the synthesis of the country.
The revelation of these facts to us cannot but
make us feel that these unhealthy conditions
of the youth of Europe are probably to no small
degree responsible for the unhealthy condition
of Europe as a whole.—C. B.
