# BULL SESSION
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
A NOTE OF WARNING
SESSION took valuable study time off, along
with several hundred other people, to attend the
AU-U sing. And we didn't begrudge the two hours
we spent sitting on the damp grass, looking at the
Pi Phis et al, looking at the moon, listening to the
nice dreamy songs, and counting the torches and the
Pi Phis, et al. All in all, Bull Session hasn't had such
a spiritual uplift in years, although we did catch a
slight cold.
However, happy as we were about the whole thing,
we can't put any faith in its becoming a tradition. We
reached this conclusion after a check-up on the rami
fications of Stanford traditions in general. Look at
them objectively. We'll bet you too will come to the
realization that every one of Stanford's time-honored
unwritten rules is morally good for the campus.
For instance, this business about the women wear
ing stockings on Quad. Think what would happen if
all the Stanford women walked around all the time
with bare legs. Admittedly there would be at a very
rough estimate about 65 per cent of them to whom
it wouldn't make any damn difference. (We reached
this conclusion through the Mayer Gallup-type poll,
which consists of walking up ot one or two of our
friends and asking them what they thought the per
centage of good legs was among Stanford women. We
think they were charitable.)
* * * *
NEVERTHELESS, just imagine the results if even
the hypothetical 45 per cent ranged the campus
seven days a week with nice bare brown legs. Com
pute the time lost in the Reserve Book Room alone
if every Stanford man there had to pause in his studies
while they walked by. And think of the wear and
tear on his eyes, already none too good because the
University lighting system is specifically designed for
those who know braille. (Literally, brother.)
Check down the list. Smoking on quad would in
crease your cigarette consumption by at least 1 per
cent. Sending flowers to your girl all the time would
eventually get her versed in the "language of flow
ers" and you might some night find out you'd inad
vertently and quite innocently either insulted or
proposed to her.
* * * *
W/E ADMIT the law steps tradition is a little ob
scure, but after a little intense research, we dis
covered that the law steps are frequented by law
students—a notoriously frustrated lot because they
study so hard. For an innocent woman to come too
close to them might prove dangerous. And the Uni
versity can't have that sort of thing going on.
We could continue for hours.
All of which brings us to the apparently innocu
ous All-U sing. Speaking for ourself, we noticed that
the spring night atmosphere and the Pi Phis et al
made us lose our desire to go back to the prosaic,
steamy libe. We thought vaguely of other things. And,
since we dropped into the libe on the way back to
pick up our binder, we can state that the place was
practically deserted except for a Phi Bete who had
never left.
Far be it from Bull Session to put ideas into the
naive heads of Stanford men and women. But some
soft spring evening, some Person in Authority is going
to drop in at the amphitheater and note the thought
waves emanating from the assembled throng And
that'll be the last of the All-U Sing

study so hard. For an innocent woman to come too
close to them might prove dangerous. And the Uni
versity can't have that sort of thing going on.
We could continue for hours.
All of which brings us to the apparently innocu
ous All-U sing. Speaking for ourself, we noticed that
the spring night atmosphere and the Pi Phis et al
made us lose our desire to go back to the prosaic,
steamy libe. We thought vaguely of other things. And,
since we dropped into the libe on the way back to
pick up our binder, we can state that the place was
practically deserted except for a Phi Bete who had
never left.
Far be it from Bull Session to put ideas into the
naive heads of Stanford men and women. But some
soft spring evening, some Person in Authority is going
to drop in at the amphitheater and note the thought
waves emanating from the assembled throng And
that'll be the last of the All-U Sing
A NOTE OF WARNING
SESSION took valuable study time off, along
with several hundred other people, to attend the
AU-U sing. And we didn't begrudge the two hours
we spent sitting on the damp grass, looking at the
Pi Phis et al, looking at the moon, listening to the
nice dreamy songs, and counting the torches and the
Pi Phis, et al. All in all, Bull Session hasn't had such
a spiritual uplift in years, although we did catch a
slight cold.
However, happy as we were about the whole thing,
we can't put any faith in its becoming a tradition. We
reached this conclusion after a check-up on the rami
fications of Stanford traditions in general. Look at
them objectively. We'll bet you too will come to the
realization that every one of Stanford's time-honored
unwritten rules is morally good for the campus.
For instance, this business about the women wear
ing stockings on Quad. Think what would happen if
all the Stanford women walked around all the time
with bare legs. Admittedly there would be at a very
rough estimate about 65 per cent of them to whom
it wouldn't make any damn difference. (We reached
this conclusion through the Mayer Gallup-type poll,
which consists of walking up ot one or two of our
friends and asking them what they thought the per
centage of good legs was among Stanford women. We
think they were charitable.)
* * * *
NEVERTHELESS, just imagine the results if even
the hypothetical 45 per cent ranged the campus
seven days a week with nice bare brown legs. Com
pute the time lost in the Reserve Book Room alone
if every Stanford man there had to pause in his studies
while they walked by. And think of the wear and
tear on his eyes, already none too good because the
University lighting system is specifically designed for
those who know braille. (Literally, brother.)
Check down the list. Smoking on quad would in
crease your cigarette consumption by at least 1 per
cent. Sending flowers to your girl all the time would
eventually get her versed in the "language of flow
ers" and you might some night find out you'd inad
vertently and quite innocently either insulted or
proposed to her.

W/E ADMIT the law steps tradition is a little ob
scure, but after a little intense research, we dis
covered that the law steps are frequented by law
students—a notoriously frustrated lot because they
study so hard. For an innocent woman to come too
