# MUCH ADO ABOUT . . .

r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
I was unable to re-enter Stanford this quarter
due to illness. One of my greatest pleasures has been
to read about the campus activities through The Daily
and other sources, but I have been consistently dis
appointed in a column appearing weekly in a Los
Angeles newspaper concerning Stanford students.
There are various columns on this weekly colle
giate page, written by students from U.C.L.A., U.S.C.,
Pomona, and Occidental colleges, and I regret, to state
that the Stanford column is the only one which gives
the impression that there are only four sororities and
four fraternities on the campus.
Fortunately, I have been a student at Stanford and
I know there are nine sororities and twenty-four fra
ternities, but to the uninitiated the small sum of
eight fraternal groups must be an appalling one. At
U.C.L.A. there are many more sororities and frater
nities than there are on the Farm, yet each week the
author of the U.C.L.A. column manages to squeeze
in some little piece of gossip about nearly every Greek
letter organization.
In the two months that I "have been reading the
Stanford column, however, I have read about noth
ing but the doings of these eight, highly regarded
and noble organizations, and to say the least, it is
proving tiring. Surely there are Los Angeles parents
and friends whose Stanford acquaintances arc not in
any of these eight groups, but who are, nevertheless,
prominent in Stanford activities.
Besides being more interested and accurate, I am
sure that a more democratic column would better rep
resent the University.
