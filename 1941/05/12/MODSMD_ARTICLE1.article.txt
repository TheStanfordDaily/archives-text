U7EST COAST labor trouble,
* long a sore spot in United
States industry, threatens to spread
its infection through the national
defense program with picketing of
eleven Buy area shipyards by strik
ing AFL and CIO machinists sched
uled to begin this morning.

Picketing, strike leaders declared,
would "effectively halt work" in
Oakland, Alameda, and San Fran
cisco on $500,000,000 worth of pro
duction on 27 destroyers and four
cruisers for the Navy as well as nu
merous cargo vessels.
While the strike, which was called
Friday at midnight, affected imme
diately only 1700 metal workers, it
was expecetd that 15,000 other con
struction workers will refuse to
work.
The strike is the result of a dis
pute within the unions and is, ac
cording to union officials, a violation
of the shipbuilders' no-strike agree
ment which was drawn up and
signed in Seattle only last month.
But AFL strike leaders, through
their business agent, E. F. Dillon,
declared that the dispute was out
side the bounds of the agreement
since their local union had never
ratified it.
With the statement, "We're not a
party to the master agreement . . .
we still reserve the right to nego
tiate our own agreement," Dillon
expressed the strikers' complete
indifference to a telegram sent
them by William Green which
asked them to "take up griev
ances with the management in a
proper and orderly way."
To World War I generation Amer
icans the dispute, which involved a
three-cent-an-hour increase in the
wage scale of journeymen, is an
ominous indication that history is
repeating itself.
In the United States' somewhat
belated armament program of 1916-
17, industry was out to get for it
sef the most that it could before
American production passed into the
hands of the government.

YY/TIILE the Bay area strike is per
haps the most important labor
dispute of the moment so far as
number of men striking is concerned,
industrial trouble is seething and
beginning to boil over throughout
the country.

Twenty-four strikes in all parts
of the nation delayed defense pro
duction Sunday night. A majority
of the 40,000 idle workmen were
involved in a CIO lumber work
ers' strike at 50 logging camps in
the Washington woods. The strike,
which began with the wage boost
demands of 22,000 men, threatened
to spread to the entire West Coast
lumber industry and more than
100,000 workers.

And the United Automobile
Workers of the CIO have announced
that unless union requests for a 10-
cent hourly wage increase and
closed shop concessions are acceded
to, nearly 200,000 employees in 61
General Motors plants would stop
work on Thursday morning.

Such a strike would culminate two
weeks of unsuccessful mediation ne
gotiations among workers, manag
ei-s, and the government.

| AST night former President
Herbert Hoover, in an address
over the air, asserted that the na
tion "lacks unity." That's a gentle
manly way of saying that it is racked
with some of the worst labor dis
putes in United States history.
We can classify them as worst
because they come at a time when
Great Britain, who, we presup
pose, represents the economic and
social order we should like to see
win out, needs as much material
aid as we can give her and more.
She needs that aid whether we
send men over or not. And may
he our sending that aid will keep
our men at home.
And here's labor doing its best to
make sending that aid just as tough
as possible. Would it be in order to
wonder what disorganized industry
would do in the face of competition
with totalitarian efficiency?

would "effectively halt work" in
Oakland, Alameda, and San Fran
cisco on $500,000,000 worth of pro
duction on 27 destroyers and four
cruisers for the Navy as well as nu
merous cargo vessels.
While the strike, which was called
Friday at midnight, affected imme
diately only 1700 metal workers, it
was expecetd that 15,000 other con
struction workers will refuse to
work.
The strike is the result of a dis
pute within the unions and is, ac
cording to union officials, a violation
of the shipbuilders' no-strike agree
ment which was drawn up and
signed in Seattle only last month.
But AFL strike leaders, through
their business agent, E. F. Dillon,
declared that the dispute was out
side the bounds of the agreement
since their local union had never
ratified it.
With the statement, "We're not a
party to the master agreement . . .
we still reserve the right to nego
tiate our own agreement," Dillon
expressed the strikers' complete
indifference to a telegram sent
them by William Green which
asked them to "take up griev
ances with the management in a
proper and orderly way."
To World War I generation Amer
icans the dispute, which involved a
three-cent-an-hour increase in the
wage scale of journeymen, is an
ominous indication that history is
repeating itself.
In the United States' somewhat
belated armament program of 1916-
17, industry was out to get for it
sef the most that it could before
American production passed into the
hands of the government.

YY/TIILE the Bay area strike is per
haps the most important labor
dispute of the moment so far as
number of men striking is concerned,
industrial trouble is seething and
beginning to boil over throughout
the country.

Twenty-four strikes in all parts
of the nation delayed defense pro
duction Sunday night. A majority
of the 40,000 idle workmen were
involved in a CIO lumber work
ers' strike at 50 logging camps in
the Washington woods. The strike,
which began with the wage boost
demands of 22,000 men, threatened
to spread to the entire West Coast
lumber industry and more than
100,000 workers.

And the United Automobile
Workers of the CIO have announced
that unless union requests for a 10-
cent hourly wage increase and
closed shop concessions are acceded
to, nearly 200,000 employees in 61
General Motors plants would stop
work on Thursday morning.

Such a strike would culminate two
weeks of unsuccessful mediation ne
gotiations among workers, manag
ei-s, and the government.

| AST night former President
Herbert Hoover, in an address
over the air, asserted that the na
tion "lacks unity." That's a gentle
manly way of saying that it is racked
with some of the worst labor dis
putes in United States history.
We can classify them as worst
because they come at a time when
Great Britain, who, we presup
pose, represents the economic and
social order we should like to see
win out, needs as much material
aid as we can give her and more.
She needs that aid whether we
send men over or not. And may
he our sending that aid will keep
our men at home.
And here's labor doing its best to
make sending that aid just as tough
as possible. Would it be in order to

diately only 1700 metal workers, it
was expecetd that 15,000 other con
struction workers will refuse to
work.
The strike is the result of a dis
pute within the unions and is, ac
cording to union officials, a violation
of the shipbuilders' no-strike agree
ment which was drawn up and
signed in Seattle only last month.
But AFL strike leaders, through
their business agent, E. F. Dillon,
declared that the dispute was out
side the bounds of the agreement
since their local union had never
ratified it.
With the statement, "We're not a
party to the master agreement . . .
we still reserve the right to nego
tiate our own agreement," Dillon
expressed the strikers' complete
indifference to a telegram sent
them by William Green which
asked them to "take up griev
ances with the management in a
proper and orderly way."
To World War I generation Amer
icans the dispute, which involved a
three-cent-an-hour increase in the
wage scale of journeymen, is an
ominous indication that history is
repeating itself.
In the United States' somewhat
belated armament program of 1916-
17, industry was out to get for it
sef the most that it could before
American production passed into the
hands of the government.

YY/TIILE the Bay area strike is per
haps the most important labor
dispute of the moment so far as
number of men striking is concerned,
industrial trouble is seething and
beginning to boil over throughout
the country.

Twenty-four strikes in all parts
of the nation delayed defense pro
duction Sunday night. A majority
of the 40,000 idle workmen were
involved in a CIO lumber work
ers' strike at 50 logging camps in
the Washington woods. The strike,
which began with the wage boost
demands of 22,000 men, threatened
to spread to the entire West Coast
lumber industry and more than
100,000 workers.

And the United Automobile
Workers of the CIO have announced
that unless union requests for a 10-
cent hourly wage increase and
closed shop concessions are acceded
to, nearly 200,000 employees in 61
General Motors plants would stop
work on Thursday morning.

Such a strike would culminate two
weeks of unsuccessful mediation ne
gotiations among workers, manag
ei-s, and the government.

Herbert Hoover, in an address
over the air, asserted that the na
tion "lacks unity." That's a gentle
manly way of saying that it is racked
with some of the worst labor dis
putes in United States history.
We can classify them as worst
because they come at a time when
Great Britain, who, we presup
pose, represents the economic and
social order we should like to see
win out, needs as much material
aid as we can give her and more.
She needs that aid whether we
send men over or not. And may

make sending that aid just as tough
as possible. Would it be in order to

U7EST COAST labor trouble,
* long a sore spot in United
States industry, threatens to spread
its infection through the national
defense program with picketing of
eleven Buy area shipyards by strik
ing AFL and CIO machinists sched
uled to begin this morning.

Picketing, strike leaders declared,
would "effectively halt work" in
Oakland, Alameda, and San Fran
cisco on $500,000,000 worth of pro
duction on 27 destroyers and four
cruisers for the Navy as well as nu
merous cargo vessels.
