# Show to Get 2 Rehearsals 'Without Corn'
## 
### 
With an unprecedented orchestra
rehearsal already under its belt, the
cost of "How's Your Circulation?"
will dig in this week for the final
grind and polish before Friday and
Saturday nights' performances in
Memorial Hall. Tickets will be sold
from the Concert Series Window
all day today, and after that they
may be purchased in the A.S.S.U.
office.

Yesterday Director Bud Cady
murmured dazedly through a fog
of aspirin and bicarbonate that the
show "was in great shape," and then
gathered his shattered nerves to
compliment orcjhestra leader Art
McCue and list the show's songs.
"Of course McCue, as an ex-Ram's
Head man, is a permanent fixture,"
he said, "but the extra Saturday
rehearsal was a special favor that's
going to make it possible for us to
have two real dress rehearsals with
out having to take time out to cut
the corn as we've had to do in the
past."
Most of the songs were* written
by Cady and Charlie Bulotti. Their
efforts include the primarily "patter"
songs: "It's a Dirty, Dirty Shame,"
to be sung by the chorus and Hal
Millcn; "Looking for a Man," feung
by Ash Wilson, Yvonne Hazlett, Six
Hits and a Dent, and the Chorus;

"I'm Really not a Bad Man," ren
dered by Bulotti as Gangster Toots
Grinelli; "We're Going Broke," the
Four Advertisers' refrain; "Have a
Baby," by Millen, Miss Hazlett, and
the Chorus of Nurses; "One Vote for
Grum," by the chorus.

Marion Scott's sweet tune "All
Life Long" will be sung by Yvonne
Hazlett, Hal Millen, and the Six
Hits and a Dent. Shirley Cady wrote
"You Send Me," the Tommy How
ard-Dorrie Redman vehicle, and is
also responsible for a "very mys
terious counterpoint arrangement of
"One Vote for Grum" and "Have a
Baby." And Bulotti stepped out of
tandem to write "I'm a Reporter."

murmured dazedly through a fog
of aspirin and bicarbonate that the
show "was in great shape," and then
gathered his shattered nerves to
compliment orcjhestra leader Art
McCue and list the show's songs.
"Of course McCue, as an ex-Ram's
Head man, is a permanent fixture,"
he said, "but the extra Saturday
rehearsal was a special favor that's
going to make it possible for us to
have two real dress rehearsals with
out having to take time out to cut
the corn as we've had to do in the
past."
Most of the songs were* written
by Cady and Charlie Bulotti. Their
efforts include the primarily "patter"
songs: "It's a Dirty, Dirty Shame,"
to be sung by the chorus and Hal
Millcn; "Looking for a Man," feung
by Ash Wilson, Yvonne Hazlett, Six
Hits and a Dent, and the Chorus;

"I'm Really not a Bad Man," ren
dered by Bulotti as Gangster Toots
Grinelli; "We're Going Broke," the
Four Advertisers' refrain; "Have a
Baby," by Millen, Miss Hazlett, and
the Chorus of Nurses; "One Vote for
Grum," by the chorus.

Marion Scott's sweet tune "All
Life Long" will be sung by Yvonne
Hazlett, Hal Millen, and the Six
Hits and a Dent. Shirley Cady wrote
"You Send Me," the Tommy How
ard-Dorrie Redman vehicle, and is
also responsible for a "very mys
terious counterpoint arrangement of
"One Vote for Grum" and "Have a
Baby." And Bulotti stepped out of
tandem to write "I'm a Reporter."
With an unprecedented orchestra
rehearsal already under its belt, the
cost of "How's Your Circulation?"
will dig in this week for the final
grind and polish before Friday and
Saturday nights' performances in
Memorial Hall. Tickets will be sold
from the Concert Series Window
all day today, and after that they
may be purchased in the A.S.S.U.
office.
