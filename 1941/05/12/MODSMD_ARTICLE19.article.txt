# Parliament Hit In Shattering London Raids
## R.A.F. Knocks Out 33 German Planes To Set Night Record 
### 
LONDON. May 11 (UP). â€” Nazi
bombs sowed death, flame and de
struction in Britain's imperial heart
last night. They wrecked the House
of Commons chamber, dumped de
bris upon Westminster Abbey's
shrine, fired the British Museum and
blackened the weathered face of Big
Ben, official reports disclosed to
night.
But Big Ben's massive hands still
wheeled the hours and the famous
chimes rang out again to London as
the thin wail of sirens tonight
sounded the signal for possibly an
other German attack.
British sources estimate that 33
Nazi raiders were destroyed, and
many others were so badly damaged
in vicious dogfights that they never
reached their bases .
The R.A.F.'s success in destroy
ing a new record high for the war
in night fighting was scored, of
course, under near - perfect condi
tions of bright moonlight.
The toll, however, represented an
estimated 10 per cent of the raiding
force of 300 to 400 planes.
