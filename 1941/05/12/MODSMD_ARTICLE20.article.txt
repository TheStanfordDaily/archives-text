### 
ISTANBUL, May 11 (UP).â€”Tur
key tonight awaited "most important
diplomatic" developments, probably
including a Nazi demand that Turkey
keep hands off German shipping
passing thi'ough the Dardanelles in
connection with intensification of
warfare in the Middle East.
There was growing Turkish belief
that a German offensive into the
Middle East would by-pass Turkey.
It was pointed out that seven Ger
man ships and at least one Italian
vessel have cleared Turkish watei's
for the Aegean, raising possibility
that sea-borne Nazi troops might
move from Greece to Syria despite
the presence of the British fleet.
