### MARGE HOVEY 
Eight freshman athletes, declared ineligible Friday f«tr further com
petition for Stanford by Pacific Coast Conference Commissioner Edwin N.
Atherton, were still undecided last night whether they would stay on at
the Farm or no to other colleges Where they could participate in athletics.
Those hit by Atherton's ruling were Boh Koch, football and baseball;

Jim Ellis, football and baseball; Mat
thew Petriich, football and baseball;
Bob Waters, track; Jean Lamoure,
football and track; Bill Joslyn, foot
ball and track; Hal Petrich, football
and baseball; Bill Nourse, football
and basketball.
Scholarships offered by individual
alumni and letters promising jobs to
the young athletes were the princi
pal violations of the Conference
code, according to Atherton.
TRANSFER RULE WAIVED
Boys affected by the ruling may
apply for a waiver of the transfer
eligibility rule, Atherton said, which
would allow them to compete for an
other school next At the same
time the former G-man, hired by
the Coast Conference to clean up
athletics, declared ineligible 13 high
school boys in Oklahoma and Texas
because a Stanford alumnus sug
gested by letter they come here.
Al Masters, BA.C. manager, said
all frosh affected by the Atherton
ruling, who held scholarships, would
continue to hold them during their
four years.
The eight frosh, contacted by The
Daily yesterday between phone
calls to parents and discussions with
friends, were undecided about the
future. Instructed by the Board of
Athletic Control not to talk about
plans until they were definite, the
boys all stated they wanted to con
tinue at Stanford but the idea of no
participation in sports didn't appeal
to them.
CONSIDER OREGON
Koch and Ellis, Zete pledges from
Portland who have already won
praise during spring football prac
tice, told friends they were consid
ering Oregon. However, both said
they didn't want to play against the
"T" formation.
Linemen Jean Lamour and Bill
Joslyn, who came from San Fran
cisco to compete in both football
and track, were also undecided but
Deke fraternity brothers believed
the two would stay at Stanford. Jos
lyn, who was conditioned to Stan
ford at Lowell High School, said he
still wanted to graduate from here.
However, it was rumored that La
mour would transfer to U.C.LA.
PETRICH WILL STAY
Hal Petrich, D.U. pledge from
Long Beach, who was promised a
scholarship but did not receive it,
said last night:
"Stanford means quite a bit to me.
I might not be happy not playing
football but I think I'll stay on."
Bill Nourse of Santa Monica and
Matthew Petrlich of Midvale, Utah,
would not say what their plans were
but it was believed that Petrlich
would not return.
Bob Waters, Phi Delt pledge who
has been running the sprints in
faster time than the varsity track
men, refused to say what his plans
were but friends thought he would
choose Stanford even though it
means no track.

they didn't want to play against the
"T" formation.
Linemen Jean Lamour and Bill
Joslyn, who came from San Fran
cisco to compete in both football
and track, were also undecided but
Deke fraternity brothers believed
the two would stay at Stanford. Jos
lyn, who was conditioned to Stan
ford at Lowell High School, said he
still wanted to graduate from here.
However, it was rumored that La
mour would transfer to U.C.LA.
PETRICH WILL STAY
Hal Petrich, D.U. pledge from
Long Beach, who was promised a
scholarship but did not receive it,
said last night:
"Stanford means quite a bit to me.
I might not be happy not playing
football but I think I'll stay on."
Bill Nourse of Santa Monica and
Matthew Petrlich of Midvale, Utah,
would not say what their plans were
but it was believed that Petrlich
would not return.
Bob Waters, Phi Delt pledge who
has been running the sprints in
faster time than the varsity track
men, refused to say what his plans
were but friends thought he would
choose Stanford even though it
means no track.
Eight freshman athletes, declared ineligible Friday f«tr further com
petition for Stanford by Pacific Coast Conference Commissioner Edwin N.
Atherton, were still undecided last night whether they would stay on at
the Farm or no to other colleges Where they could participate in athletics.
Those hit by Atherton's ruling were Boh Koch, football and baseball;

Jim Ellis, football and baseball; Mat
thew Petriich, football and baseball;
Bob Waters, track; Jean Lamoure,
football and track; Bill Joslyn, foot
ball and track; Hal Petrich, football
and baseball; Bill Nourse, football
and basketball.
Scholarships offered by individual
alumni and letters promising jobs to
the young athletes were the princi
pal violations of the Conference
code, according to Atherton.
TRANSFER RULE WAIVED
Boys affected by the ruling may
apply for a waiver of the transfer
eligibility rule, Atherton said, which
would allow them to compete for an
other school next At the same
time the former G-man, hired by
the Coast Conference to clean up
athletics, declared ineligible 13 high
school boys in Oklahoma and Texas
because a Stanford alumnus sug
gested by letter they come here.
Al Masters, BA.C. manager, said
all frosh affected by the Atherton
ruling, who held scholarships, would
continue to hold them during their
four years.
The eight frosh, contacted by The
Daily yesterday between phone
calls to parents and discussions with
friends, were undecided about the
future. Instructed by the Board of
Athletic Control not to talk about
plans until they were definite, the
boys all stated they wanted to con
tinue at Stanford but the idea of no
participation in sports didn't appeal
to them.
CONSIDER OREGON
Koch and Ellis, Zete pledges from
Portland who have already won
praise during spring football prac
tice, told friends they were consid
ering Oregon. However, both said
they didn't want to play against the
"T" formation.
