# Hasher Gives Lowdown On Breakfast Beauties
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
"No Stanford man has ever seen any Stanford woman in her true
state of beauty until he sips a cup of coffee with her at 7:20 a.m. in her
dorm."
That's the dope, men. It comes straight from the Farm's best informed
authority on "Women in the Rough"—Hughes Ogilvie, head hasher at
Lagunita. *

"Hugo" is conducting what is
probably the world's most exten
sive research on feminine character
as revealed in eating antics.
"I have every girl in Lagunita
classified as to how she looks at each
meal," Hugo proudly stated. "When
ever a girl shows signs of a new
classification, a hasher runs for the
kitchen to enter her name at the
top of the list on my chart."
ARE THEY ANEMIC!
First group of Hugo's list, is the
"no make-up at breakfast" type.
Hashers cringe at these pale, anemic
looking specimens.
"Then there is the 'unkissable
lipstick' type," Hugo explained. She
wears the kind of lipstick that cracks
on spoons and makes a perfect, print
on all the napkins. At breakfast her
make-up looks as if she had put it
on while she was half asleep."
'Get. up with the gong gals' is
Hugo's description of girls who
come into the dining room still
dressing. Two other breakfast class
ifications that hashers view with
equal distaste are the 'bandana
type' and the 'no hose group.' Girls
with good legs generally qualify for
the 'shorts type.'
AND UNCL A SSIFIA ISLE
"My next two groups are com
posed of the same personnel — the
'never miss a meal' type and the
'never bring men to meals' class.
We wish girls would miss meals ev
ery once in a while so we can yearn
for them."
But there is one type that Hugo
simply cannot classify so he writes
the names of these girls under a
title "special class."
"These women strut up and down
the dining room for no good reason

that very few Lagunita women be
long to this group."
Regardless of these physical attri
butes or defects as the case may be,
Hugo's final judgment of a girl de
pends on whether she is the friendly
type or the kind that looks down
on a hasher as if- he were a slave.
On the whole, he thinks Lagunita
women are a good, friendly crop
this year.
"But if some Stanford men could
know what we know about their
girl friends," Hugo prophesied, "I
think they might appreciate the
hasher's theme song. It goes like
this: 'Oh. say you should see by the
dawn's early light what so proudly
we hailed as the twilight's last
gleaming'."

—that is, they may think they have
a reason, but we disagree. II I could
just mention one name, you would
understand. But I'm thankful to say
