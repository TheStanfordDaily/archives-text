# Stuart Returns From South American Trip
## Professor to Discuss Good Neighbor Policy For Tuesday Series 
### 
Dr. Graham Stuart, Stanford pro
fessor of political science, returned
to the campus yesterday morning
from a two-months tour of South
America as a guest of the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace,
and will speak on "The Good Neigh
bor Policy" for the Tuesday Series
tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock in
the auditorium of Memorial Hall.
Dr. Stuart was one of 11 men
chosen from throughout the United
States by Nicholas Murray Butler,
president of the Carnegie Institute
and Columbia University, to visit
Latin America and exchange infor
mation and opinions with colleagues
there, to increase their knowledge
of Pan-American relations, and to
bring back fresh opinions to their
professional work.
The party sailed from New York
on Feb. 28 and proceeded to Santiago
and Valparaiso, Chile. From there
it continued over a large part of
South America and terminated in
Rio de Janeiro. There was a sched
uled itinerary, but the travelers
were left to follow their own in
terests.
Special leave was granted Dr.
Stuart from his academic duties so
that he could accept the invitation
to gain information regarding our
southern neighbors.
The Carnegie party consisted of
several newspaper editors, college
professors and deans, and authorities
in the field of international rela
tions. *
