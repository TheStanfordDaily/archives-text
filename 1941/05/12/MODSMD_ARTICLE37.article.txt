# Fair to Show Real Livestock
## Men's Living Groups To Provide Animals 
### 
Now is the time for all good Stan
ford men to sit up and take notice!
All you males who have sat on the
sidelines at previous County Fairs
and gazed with tolerant smiles at
the women's antics must undergo a
change of tune. The fair in the
Union Court on May 21 will be just
as much yours as it will be the
women's.
After much brain fag and feverish
thought, the committee under the
direction of Irma Jean Hannibal
has produced a plan that will make
this fair really rural. The main
feature of the afternoon will be a
livestock show and he - men will
provide the livestock.
Each men's living group on cam
pus is asked to deck an animal in
pink ribbons and lead it to the fair.
There will be a grand march and a
faculty member will act as chief
judge. Ribbons will be awarded for
the best animals in each class and a
silver trophy for the most "genuine
and appropriate" entry. There will
be a surprise award for the most
original competitor.
It is not too early to start think
ing about it and to begin digging
up possible four or two-footed can
didates. Entries will close 24 hours
before the fair. Roble women will
visit each men's living group to col
lect entry foes. Further announce
ments will appear in The Daily.
