## 
### 
To clarify the issues and allow
spokesmen of both the Aid-the-
Allies and the America First
Groups to stale their position and
meet the arguments of the other side,
a "Crisis Caucus" is being held in
the auditorium of the Palo Alto High
School at 8 o'clock tonight.

Two scientists will face a jurist
and a historian in the forum. Gor
don F. Ferris, professor of entomol
ogy at Stanford, and Dr. Russel V.
Lee of Palo Alto will Â£peak for the
Aid-the-Allies group. Judge Jack
son H. Ralston, distinguished spe
cialist in international law, and
Richard H. Jones, acting instructor
In history at Stanford will repre
sent the American First Committee.

The caucus has been arranged
through the co-operation of the two
committees, the Palo Alio Times, and
the Palo Alto Evening School in an
effort to clear up some of the confu
sion over the two courses of action
which are being urged upon the
United States in this critical hour.
Other Stanford and Palo Alto or
ganizations have given their ap
proval to the plan and will be rep
resented in the audience. The pub
lic is invited to attend.
