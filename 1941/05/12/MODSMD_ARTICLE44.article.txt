4 WER the week-end some more
freshmen follows took a beat
ing at the hands of the law. This
time it was eight frosh athletes on
(he receiving end with G-mnn Ath
erton and his committee handing it
out. In this case the action was legal
but it probably hurt those lads mora
than any physical beating, for they
now must chose between Stanford
and competitive athletics. It's a hard
choice to make, for one year on the
Farm has made any substitute seem
pretty unsatisfactory and the pros
pect of not developing their athletic
potentialities is equally unhappy.
Although they will never compete
together for Stanford again, they can
look back on an amazing record
made by the teams of the Class of
'44. The four major sports were
represented by an unbeaten football
eleven, a championship hoop squad,
a very successful baseball team, and
an exceptionally strong i.rack team.
For the first time in 14 years Pap
oose teams topped the Cubs from
California in every one of these
sports.

Track meet memos:
The stadium resembled the boat
house Saturday afternoon when
about half the 400 or so spectators
at the U.S.C.-California meet made
the best of the heat by trying to
acquire tans. The ice cream vendor
did a booming business, while the
peanut salesman was left with a lot
of nuts on his hands.
A little past the halfway mark in
the two-mile, a track attendant
handed a handkerchief to Aub Seed,
who proceeded to mop his brow as
he trotted along a few steps ahead
of Stanfill of U.S.C. It seemed ludi
crous and the crowd laughed, but
keeping the perspiration out of his
eyes must have helped because Aub
put on an amazing spurt to run
away from Stanfill in the last twenty
yards. Trojan Malone, 70 yards
back, amazed the crowd by ending
with a tremendous sprint, although
the other two had already crossed
the finish line.
The S. C. high jumpers Johnny
Wilson and Gil LaCava shed their
shoes for their leaping. Wilson went
shoeless on his right foot and kept
the other on, but LaCava wore only
white stockings on both feet. Since
they tied for first, they must have
something there.
After Russ Peck had cleared 13 ft.,
(5 in. for Stanford in the pole vault,
it was discovered that the ends of
the pegs supporting the cross-bar
were wrapped with a one'-eighth
inch thickness of tape. The officials
consulted the rule books and even
tually ordered the tape removed.
The two Trojan vaulters then de
clared that Peck should vault it
again, but removed their demand
when they both cleared that height.
