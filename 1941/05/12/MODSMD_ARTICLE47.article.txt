# Stanford Co-ed Sees 'Brutes' In Spring Practice, Chalk Talks
## 
### 
Dear Mother:
Something terribly exciting has happened! I went lo spring football
practice Friday.
I went without lunch so I could lose about ten pounds because I had
to crawl under the fence to get in. They won't let anyone watch them,
especially girls. They say it distracts the players.

When I finally squeezed in, there <
wasn't anyone on the field. All the
boys were sitting in the bleachers
watching the coach while he drew
little pictures on a blackboard.
In a few minutes, out they trotted
on the field—about 60 of the biggest,
burliest guys I've ever seen.
When I recovered from the shock
of seeing so much male strength and
pulchritude anywhere in the vicin
ity of Stanford, my attention was
caught by a group of boys with
super-large shoulders who were fe
rociously attacking a poor defense
less dummy. The mean things!
Some other brutes, 11 of them,
were passing and running against a
mere skeleton of a team. No won
der they made yardage! All of them
had on pretty green jerseys and.
the coach kept saying, "Keep your
shirt on." I guess he didn't want
them to tear the shirts.
Well, pretty soon another 11 boys,
dressed in red shirts, came over for
what they call a "scrimmage." First,
the coach calls a numbe) like "25-
42'' and the players line up facing
each other and somebody counts out
loud. Suddenly one fellow runs out
to the side and then before you
know it the ball goes sailing out to
a guy you didn't see till he catches
the pass. Then, just as he's making
real yardage, he slops running and
(hey do the whole thing again.
From what I know of football, the
team looks great—from the personal
as well as the pigskin angle.
Yours for more practice,
Hat tie
P.S.: I asked a boy where I could
get in touch with that tall dark
flash and he said, "He wouldn't be
interested. Just you try to hash,
and study on top of learning 150
plays per week."
