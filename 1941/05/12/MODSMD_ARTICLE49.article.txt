# Varsity Misses Ineligible Frosh
## 
### 
Things looked a little bare on the
practice gridiron Friday without 7
of the promising freshman squad.
Backfield Coach Marchie Schwartz
said the boys who were declared
ineligible will be missed. But as
Coach Clark Shaughnessy sent every
gridder through a heavy scrimmage,
the "Model T" looked like a smooth,
well-balanced machine.

Outstanding were Joe Mardesich,
left half, and Jim Troupe, right half,
who, out for the first time, looked
speedy and showed fine results.
Their presence will do a lot to bol
ster the depth of the backs.

Bob Ditlevson at right half is im
proving steadily, and time and time
again drove through 'the defensive
tackle picking up big {.{ains. Bruno
Banducci and Ed Stamm, working
out regularly as tackles, aren't prov
ing very easy to shake off, and
Chuck Taylor at guard is showing
again the deadliness of last fall's
campaign. Pounding Milt Vucinich
is filling the fullback's spot with
the greatest of ease.

The squad spent about 40 minutes
polishing up on new plays and get
ting each assignment down pat.
