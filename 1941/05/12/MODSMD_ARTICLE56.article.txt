\\T~>ROM all I know, not one of the eight boys
JH involved is in any way at fault. They are
all the victims of a situation over which they
had no control or knowledge."
This was what Coach Clark Shaughnessy,
hardest hit of all the Stanford coaches, had to
say last night about Commissioner Edwin N.
Atherton's ruling declaring eight Indian frosh
ineligible for further competition at Stanford.
Coach Shaughnessy wasn't condemning the
ruling; he was merely stating a fact.
Under the Conference code to outlaw prose
lyting of athletes, a high school athlete con
tacted by alumni, coaches, or any university
group will be declared ineligible for competi
tion at that university. The idea is to penalize
the school that engages in illegal activities. Un
fortunately, the boys involved suffer the great
est hardship because they can be involved by
merely, as one frosh put it, "picking a letter
out of the mailbox at home."
It is especially hard on the eight frosh who
have already spent a year at Stanford and want
to continue here and engage in sports. And it
is doubly hard on the boy who did not receive
the scholarship he was promised, but who
nevertheless decided football at Stanford was
worth it.
Last fall Cal, S.C., and U.C.L.A. were hit by
Atherton's rulings, and after much complaining,
bowed to the decree. Stanford will also abide
by the decree without, according to B.A.C. offi
cials, complaining.

Our complaint is with the alumni.
We know they mean well. We are just as
anxious as they to have good athletes come to
Stanford, give us winning teams and exciting
performances. But when the Coast Conference
adopted a code to clean up athletics and give
the boys a chance to make up their own minds
about which college they would attend, Stan
ford agreed to follow the code.
It's up to the alums to help us. First, because
we agreed to. Second, it's to our advantage to
do so. We will only lose athletes by trying to
induce them to come here. Besides, Stanford
has been under a disadvantage trying to com
pete for athletes with other California schools.
We have a high tuition that someone has to pay.
When tuition is paid, there isn't enough money
left for the cars, spending money, etc., that the
non-tuition schools could offer. Stanford has
been noted for not producing scholarships
promised, let alone the trimmings.
Stanford has a chance now to attract boys on
its own merits —Coach Shaughnessy, a good
education, spring quarter and all the rest. In
the future we hope all patriotic alumni will
show their enthusiasm and loyalty by merely
making checks payable to the Buck of the
Month Club.

\\T~>ROM all I know, not one of the eight boys
JH involved is in any way at fault. They are
all the victims of a situation over which they
had no control or knowledge."
This was what Coach Clark Shaughnessy,
hardest hit of all the Stanford coaches, had to
say last night about Commissioner Edwin N.
Atherton's ruling declaring eight Indian frosh
ineligible for further competition at Stanford.
Coach Shaughnessy wasn't condemning the
ruling; he was merely stating a fact.
Under the Conference code to outlaw prose
lyting of athletes, a high school athlete con
tacted by alumni, coaches, or any university
group will be declared ineligible for competi
tion at that university. The idea is to penalize
the school that engages in illegal activities. Un
fortunately, the boys involved suffer the great
est hardship because they can be involved by
merely, as one frosh put it, "picking a letter
out of the mailbox at home."
It is especially hard on the eight frosh who
have already spent a year at Stanford and want
to continue here and engage in sports. And it
is doubly hard on the boy who did not receive
the scholarship he was promised, but who
nevertheless decided football at Stanford was
worth it.
Last fall Cal, S.C., and U.C.L.A. were hit by
Atherton's rulings, and after much complaining,
bowed to the decree. Stanford will also abide
by the decree without, according to B.A.C. offi
cials, complaining.

Our complaint is with the alumni.
We know they mean well. We are just as
anxious as they to have good athletes come to
Stanford, give us winning teams and exciting
performances. But when the Coast Conference
adopted a code to clean up athletics and give
the boys a chance to make up their own minds
about which college they would attend, Stan
ford agreed to follow the code.
It's up to the alums to help us. First, because
we agreed to. Second, it's to our advantage to
do so. We will only lose athletes by trying to
induce them to come here. Besides, Stanford
has been under a disadvantage trying to com
pete for athletes with other California schools.
We have a high tuition that someone has to pay.
When tuition is paid, there isn't enough money
left for the cars, spending money, etc., that the
non-tuition schools could offer. Stanford has
been noted for not producing scholarships
promised, let alone the trimmings.
Stanford has a chance now to attract boys on
its own merits —Coach Shaughnessy, a good
education, spring quarter and all the rest. In
the future we hope all patriotic alumni will
show their enthusiasm and loyalty by merely
making checks payable to the Buck of the
Month Club.
