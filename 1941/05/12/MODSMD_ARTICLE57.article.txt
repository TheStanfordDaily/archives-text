ALL year Stanford students who patronize
the Bookstore have been collecting small
pasteboard squares of a lurid orange color. A
terse announcement on the profit-sharing en
velope, in which these rebate slips must be
returned by Thursday, reads, "Save Your Book
store Receipts. They Have a Cash Value."
The cash value referred to is 5 per cent of
total purchases made in the Bookstore.
To the typical Stanford student, what is the
real value of the sum he'll clear on the trans
action? Except in unusual cases, this value has
to be stated in terms of cokes, shows and ciga
rettes.
Stanford students, however, as members of a
co-operative .enterprise, have the privilege of
assigning the profit-sharing right. If this privi
lege is exercised in favor of the Student Aid
Commission, the value of the rebate slips can
be stated in other terms: in terms of several
needy students returning to Stanford next fall.
Clearly marked, "Student Aid Commission,"
and turned in on or before Thursday, the
lurid little slips now lying loose in many a
desk drawer can be the deciding factor for
someone now unable to reckon Stanford in
future plans.
Stack those terms up against cigarettes,
cokes, shows.
Is trivial the word?—r. m.
