STANFORD lost another track meet Saturday.
It's no disgrace to lose; we learned that
during those lean years of football. As long as
the fellows enjoy putting all they've got into it,
it doesn't matter whether we win or lose.
But there was something wrong with the way
we lost to U.S.C. Last season under Bill Elling

ton, Stanford had one of its best track teams,
following the training methods and traditions of
Dink Templeton. It didn't even handicap Elling
ton that he was to be coach for one year only.
That before he had a chance to show what
he could do, his place was promised to a new
comer.
All season that newcomer's squad has been
diminished. Some boys have quit track after
open conflict; others merely say they are going
to concentrate on other activities. Even most
of those left out on Angell Field have lost in
terest.
Stanford track has been a tradition. Evidently
it is joining those other traditions that are dis
cussed only at alumni reunions.
