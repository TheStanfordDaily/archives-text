A SHORT dissertation on "Women in the
Home" will be delivered before Edit Board
by the editor today in the Shack at 1 p.m. The
editress pro-tem will serve the muffins she
whipped up between edits last night, all the
while defending woman's position OUT of the
home. The staff will join this scholarly discus
sion at 1:15. When the muffins are gone and
the masculine pride is salved, the staff will
adjourn to Afternoon Club for Alka Seltzer.
