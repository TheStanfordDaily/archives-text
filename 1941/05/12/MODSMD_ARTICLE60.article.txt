# BULL SESSION

NOW AND THEN . . .
yt/TIEN The Daily's bright-eyed, eager frosh put out
their special edition a couple of weeks ago, they
were horrified to discover next day that the whole
paper had been printed on a verdant green paper.
"Who rang in that pistachio sheet on us," they in
quired in hurt tones.
Perhaps today's edition, put out by the women of
the Daily staff, will not hit the campus on green news
print; although the editor, a courtly gentleman of the
old school, is quite capable of arranging the trick. If
he does, and there is no way we have of stopping him,
Bull Session will attempt to refute in advance the
implications inherent in such a color scheme.
The men are very kind about it. They smile po
litely and say, "Oh yes, the women's edition." But
today's Bull Session does not intend to spend its space
trying to prove that women's place is not in the home,
because there's no use arguing the matter. Men in
the home would just make an ungodly mess of things.

JJOWEVER, while women's place is probably in
the home under normal conditions, she can and
does occasionally emerge, and that's why the men
keep repeating the old truism about "women in the
home." They're scared. Any female will admit that,
while she can do some men's jobs just as well as a
man can, there are a number she can't or won't do.
For instance, very few women want to go out and
get killed for the glory of the nation. Honor and brav
ery are fine as far as women are concerned, and they
can exhibit both traits to an astounding degree when
they think it's necessary—but the point is that they
are very practical about just what's necessary and just
what's foolish.
It's this odd practicality that makes men tear their
hair and claim women are illogical. What they forget
is—the logicians are men. Women really know their
thought processes pretty well, and think along fairly
straight lines in a feminine sort of way.
Perhaps a classic example of women's logic came
up two years ago during the Women's Edition. Some
of the gentlemen members of the staff were enjoying
their day of rest at one of the higher highway spots,
and as the evening waxed merrier it occurred that
they could make things difficult for their women col
leagues who were slaving in the Shack. So they tele
phoned in a fake United Press bulletin that King
George, then in Canada, had been poisoned. Of course
the thing was fantastic, but still it might have been
true.

IVTUCH the same sort of trick had been pulled dur
ing the Frosh Edition a few weeks before, and the
freshman editor, being a man, had simply called U.P.
in San Francisco and checked. The women had a dif
ferent idea. They called the editor, and told him that
if he didn't take it back they would call Montreal at
the Daily's expense. Witness the simple logic of the
thing. In the first place the Daily was saved the price
of a call to the City, and in the second place, the editor
was scared to death.

'Most likely there will be little in this issue to dif
ferentiate it from the regular editions. No one is going
to put Nuit d'Amour in the ink, or tie pink bows on
the masthead, unless the editor gets together with
the men on the press. Of course the sports page may
seem a little more literate in spots, but that's because
women haven't bothered to learn the argot—not be
cause they couldn't if they had to.

It will be a normal Stanford Daily. But here's a
bet any of us concerned in it would be safe in taking.
If war breaks out or Roosevelt is shot, the men will
literally break down the doors to get in and take
over. And when and if they came crashing in they
would also find that there was little they had to do.
We'd have met the emergency in fine style.
But they have to have something to worry about.
