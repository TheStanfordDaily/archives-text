No one mourned the death of
Stripey the alligator in Roble.
His owner, Eleanor Webster, was
happy that he died; perhaps the only
disappointed person was the Phi
Psi who wanted to provide a home
for him.
The alligator succumbed because
of "unfavorable environmental con
ditions and injuries received during
his trip to Stanford," said Eleanor.
The eight-inch baby alligator was
sent to her from St. Augustine, Fla.,
by air mail, packed in a not-too
well ventilated box. Of course his
diet of carrots and bread had noth
ing to do with his death—alligators
usually eat only fish and meat. He
was buried in a Ritz cracker box.
