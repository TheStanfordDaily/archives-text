# Frosh Woman Proves Girl's Debate Ability
## 
### HARRIET FISHER 
Marie Barovic has proved herself
a successful debater despite dis
couragements from male members
of the freshman debate squad.
"When I first turned out, the boys
wouldn't believe I was serious," said
Marie. "They told me that girls
just don't debate at Stanford."
Marie's performance in the fresh
man debate series with California
showed those doubting males that
girls would and could take part in
Farm debating.
MAKES GOOI)
Given only 45 minutes notice that
she was to appear in the first of
the series, Marie made such a good
showing that George J. Peavey, frosh
debate coach, asked her to make the
trip to Berkeley the following day
for the second debate.
Marie came to the Farm from
Puyallup, Wash., where she debated
during her last year in high school.
"There were four girls and no
boys on our team," she declared. "I
certainly got a lot of valuable expe
rience that year."
Marie's greatest ambition at the
present is to debate for Stanford
against San Quentin in the annual
forensic contest between Farm stu
dents and inmates of the prison.
PLANS LAW CAREER
After graduation, Marie will enter
law school where, she hopes, her
debate experience will prove val
uable.
"There's only one thing wrong
with Stanford debating," Marie
claims, "and that's the lack of in
terest in debating among the stu
dent body. Why, hardly anyone ever
turns out to hear debates."
Climaxing her triumph over her
male classmates, Marie, the only girl
who tried out, has been chosen to
debate a freshman team at the Col
lege of the Pacific on May 19, along
with Allen Armer, frosh debate man
ager.
