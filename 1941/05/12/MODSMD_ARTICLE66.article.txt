# Lagunita Juniors Plan 'Monte Carlo' Benefit
## 
### 
Continuing the custom of provid
ing a scholarship for a classmate
within the living group, junior
women in Lagunita are feverishly
planning "A Night in Monte Carlo"
for Wednesday evening. Replete
with miniature horse races, fortune
tellers, and all the other distinguish
ing characteristics of an evening
spent at the wheel of fortune, the
juniors anticipate raising enough
money for a full scholarship. The
affair will be held in Lagunita and
will start at 9:30 o'clock.
