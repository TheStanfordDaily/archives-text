# Wilburs Invite '41 to Informal Talk Tonight
## President, Seniors To Discuss Future Of Graduating Class 
### 
For informal discussion and for
consideration of the collective fu
ture of the Class of '41, Dr. and Mrs.
Ray Lyman Wilbur will receive
members of the senior class at 7:30
o'clock tonight at their home on La
gunita Knoll.

Art Gore, class president, ex
pressed the hope last night that
every senior man and woman would
take advantage of the Wilburs' hos
pitality tonight for this last get
together.

Tonight's meeting will be more
like those of small student groups
such as Ex Committee and Men's
and Women's Councils, which have
met at the Wilburs, than like the
more formal receptions which Dr.
and Mrs. Wilbur hold for incoming
freshmen and graduating senior
classes.

The subject or subjects of both
Dr. Wilbur's informal talk and the
student discussion have not been
announced, to limit neither the
scope nor the spontaneity of the
meeting. Refreshments will be
served following the meeting.
