YOUR FORMULA
FOR SUCCESS
Here's a formula successfully prac- !
iiced by the Chairman of the Board of
j Gcner.il Motors, john j. Raskob, by
| Mayor La Guardia, Vincent Bendix—
a host of others.
J. Pick out tlie business you'd like
to run oe the profession you'd like to
j star in.
2. Get on the payroll in a job where
you can work with, learn from and be
appreciated by, key executives.
3. How? The way these top-r3nk
| ing men and women did—as a sccre
tary.
Good secretaries arc "on the in
i side." They live with opportunity.
but good secretaries are made only
jby exceptional training. Shorthand
J and typing are not enough.
Put yourself ahead of competition
with the West's more effective, most
'.uccesiful training—at the Grace Ball
School. St takes no longer, costs no
more.
Gr~.cc Ball graduates enjoy un- j
squalled employment opportunity. The
proof—more positions offered us than
wc have graduates to fill them.
