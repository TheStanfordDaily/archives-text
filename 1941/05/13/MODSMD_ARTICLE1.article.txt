IVO MATTER how you cut it the
fantastic saga of Rudolf Hess is
one of the greatest news yams of all
time. Sane or insane, the No. 3 Nazi
exploded a bomb loaded with spec
ulation, rumor, and plain curiosity
such as the world has not seen since
King Edward's abdication and the
Graf Spee incident.
All the elements are there: sus
pense, mystery, glamor, human in
terest. And the most irritating thing
about it is that the truth about his
precipitate arrival in England a
country battling for its life against
the nation he might some day have
led—may be buried in the London
and Berlin archives for some 20 or
more years.
Basically, the reasons for llcss'
flight can be divided into four
categories, and every one of them
has loose ends and strange little
inexplicable quirks.
Just one thing is fairly certain.
Hess left Germany by design. His
plane, a Messerschmitt 110, carried
no bombs and did not have enough
gasoline to get him back. Then too
he brought with him the medicines
for treatment of his gall bladder and
heart ailments.

r PHE first reason advanced by the
analysts is the one Berlin gave—
that he was suffering from a "pro
gressive ailment." This statement
was released a few hours before
London announced that they had
caught Hess. Obviously the British
have been waiting for this all-im
portant Nazi announcement, so that
they would know what tack to take.
And it took the Nazis from Satur
day till Monday to make up their
minds.
If Hess was mentally deranged,
and Berlin claims Hess' adjutants
have had standing orders for years
to keep him out of planes, what is
he doing as a trusted Nazi official?
It was only a few weeks ago that
he was sent on a ticklish private
mission to the Spanish govern
ment.
The German people have not
been told as yet, and it would l»c
interesting to know bow they'll
feel when they find out that the
man to whom Hitler dictated and
dedicated "Mein Kampf," the man
who was supposed to take over
the leadership of the Reich if
something happened to Ilitler and
Goering, was out of his head.
Still, Hess was reputedly one of
ihe most normal, likeable men in
high Nazi circles. He was the stable
influence, the man who calmed down
the various warring cliques. Perhaps
he. like Hermann Kauschnigg, sim
ply couldn't take it any longer. Per
haps he cracked under the terrific
pressure.

r pHE second idea making the news
rounds is that he had had some
sort of quarrel with Hitler, and,
fearing the fate of the Fuehrer's
close "friend" of a few years back,
Ernest Roehm, simply got out. But
he left his family in Germany, where
they'll be subject to all the reprisals
the Nazis are so clever at thinking
up.
« * *

The third explanation is the one
(lie British would like the world
to believe. That Iless flew to Scot
land with peace terms, and that he
made the trip without Hitler's
knowledge. This would lead us to
think that there is friction—dan
gerous friction — within the Na
tional Socialist government. How
ever, of all Hitler's confidantes,
Hess was known as the most
faithful and least ambitious. He
has followed the Fuehrer loyally
since before the Beer Hall Putsch.
(But so had Roehm.)
Finally there are those who think
Hess never would have been caught
if he hadn't broken his ankle. If
this is true he came to England to
talk an anti-Churchill peace with
some British pro-Nazi.
But why did he bring specific
identifications with him? Why did
the Nazi government give such a
cold-blooded announcement of his
alleged insanity? That's not the sort
of thing a government would say
about a loyal high official who had
unfortunately gone off his rocker.
And what will it mean, sane or in
sane, if he talks?
