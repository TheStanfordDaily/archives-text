# Wilbur Chats With Seniors, Talks on Crisis
## 
### 
For an apprehensive group of
seniors, President Wilbur last night
viewed the world situation opti
mistically but realistically.
"War is the worst thing that can
happen to a democracy," he said.
Calling this a war of the assembly
line, he challenged the United States
lo fulfill its destiny by backing
Great Britain with science and sci
entific production.
WORTH 10.000 SOLDIERS'
"Our Guggenheim laboratory is
worth 10,000 soldiers," said Dr. Wil
bur by way of encouraging students
to complete their training and pro
vide trained brains to defeat the so
called enemy of our way of life.
Expressing satisfaction that the
selective service administration is
finally adopting a policy of defer
ment for students in fields such as
chemistry, engineering, and medi
cine, the president pointed out that
following the example of the U. S.
Naval Academy most schools arc
condensing these courses to three
years.
A description of Stanford in the
past served as a springboard for Dr.
Wilbur's description of the Univer
sity's future. Speaking architectur
ally he outlined three quadrangles
to include a new engineering plant,
fine arts building, journalism, and
finally a medical school and hospi
tals.
CENTER OF ACTIVITY
He explained how the center of
activity in a University changes.
"That's why we had to close the
road in front of the Library," he
said. "When you're planning build
ings you have to allow for the foot
paths of the students; we've stopped
expecting them to turn square cor
ners," he added.
The emphasis on graduate schools
Dr. Wilbur described in terms of
advanced civilization, and in relation
to the junior college movement.
