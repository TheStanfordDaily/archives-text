# Hess' Scottish Landing Deliberate, British Say; Deny Insanity Claim
## S.F. Machinists Strike; Eleven Shipyards Close Half Billion Defense Orders Halted As 15,000 Out of Job 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 12 (LIP).
—The nation's biggest shipbuilding
strike of the defense emergency
today halted production at 11 San
Francisco Bay Area shipyards
working on $500,000,000 contracts
for navy and merchant vessels and
put 15,000 skilled workers out of
jobs.
In an orderly demonstration,
A.F.L. and C.1.0. machinists picketed
police-patrolled shipyards in San
Francisco, Oakland and Alameda,
including two big Bethlehem Cor
poration plants and the Moore Dry
dock Co.—mass producer of cargo
ships.
AIM—HIGHER WAGES
Thirteen thousand allied shipyard
workers refused to pass the picket
lines. The 2,000 machinists struck
for higher wages.
Seven plants shut down com
pletely. They were Moore Drydock,
Oakland; Harbor Launch and Tug
Co., Oakland; General Engineering,
Alameda; Pacific Drydock, Oakland;
Parker Diesel Works, Oakland; Mat
son Navigation Company ship re
pair shops, San Francisco; and Beth
lehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Al
ameda.
BOILERMAKERS STICK
Bethlehem's San Francisco plant
stopped operations except for minor
work on private contracts. Boiler
makers remained on duty at the San
Francisco plants of General Engi
neering, United Engineering, and
Columbia Machine Works. The Boil
ermakers informed the machinists
they were in sympathy with their
wage demands but had contracts to
fill.
Even while the three-day strike
went into efTect and government
agencies pleaded from Washington
for settlement of the dispute, repre
sentatives of the Pacific Coast Dry
dock Association and the two strik
ing unions met separately to discuss
future moves in the walkout. But
there was no immediate hope of
peace.
