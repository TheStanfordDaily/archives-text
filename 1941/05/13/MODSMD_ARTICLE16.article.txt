# Artistic Sets To Mark Show
## 
### 
With the announcement that speed
will keynote the staging of this Fri
day and Saturday night's Spring
Show, "How's Your Circulation?"
Technical Director Pete Wangen
heim yesterday said that the sets
are the most artistic that he, per
sonally, had ever seen.
"The first scene of the first act,"
he stated, "is the exterior of the Star
office. It's a beautiful, modern, green
and white backdrop, and it just
nearly killed Tony Cefaratti and me
because it fell on us. But we like
it anyway."
NO PAUSES
Because three sots are used in the
first act, the sets had to be designed
so that there would be no pauses
between scenes. Scene 11, a $30-a
-day hospital room, "so small it would
cramp termites" according to Wan
genheim, is built on a rolling plat
form, which slides in front of Scene
111, the publisher's office.
Wangenheim's particular pride is
the Contest Headquarters set for
Acts II and 111. Done in baby pink
and baby blue, it features mother
and baby elephants, mother and
baby dogs, mother and baby fire
hydrants, mother and baby Hoover
War Libcs,. mother and baby air
planes, and a door leading to the
Bureau of Weights and Measures.
SHAPELY NURSES
"I woke up at 3 a.m. to get that
idea," Wangenheim said.
Costumes are in charge of Mavis
Moore and feature a new type of
clinging outfit for shapely nurses,
and a German band. It is claimed
that only the blockade prevented use
of authentic German band uniforms.
Lois Feldhym is in charge of light
ing, and she promises some "amaz
ing" effects.
