Itudolt' Hess, No. [{ man in the Nazi
hierarchy after Adolf Hitler and
Hermann Goering, went over the
side of a German warplanc last
Saturday night and parachuted to
earth in Scotland, British authori
ties announced at midnight Mon
day.
A few hours earlier the Germans
had anounccd that Hess was myste
riously missing after taking oh' by
plane from Augsburg in southern
Germany Saturday night, leaving a
letter which showed "unfortunate
traces of a mental derangement."
The British promptly denied the
Nazi insanity claim. They said Hess'
words in the Glasgow hospital to
which he went for treatment of the

broken ankle he suffered in the
parachute jump showed that he was
in full possession of his faculties.
Moreover, they said, the entire case
bore ample evidence that he delib
erately planned and executed the
descent on British soil.
The British had nothing to say of
what Hess had told them, if any
thing.
With him he carried photographs,
through which lie established his
identity, and medicines for treat
ment of heart and gall bladder ail
ments from which he was said to be
suffering.
Hess' plane, with empty gas tanks
and carrying neither bombs nor
ammunition, crashed in the moor
lands about 10 miles from Glasgow.
A plowman helped him to a farm
house where the plowman's mother
offered him a cup of tea. The Nazi
deputy fuehrer declined, however,
and asked for a glass of water.
