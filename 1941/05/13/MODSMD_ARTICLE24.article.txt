# NO REACTION IN GERMANY
## 
### 
BERLIN, Tues., May 13 (UP). â€”
The broadcast British report that
Rudolf Hess had landed in Scot
land brought no German reaction
early today.
The broadcast, heard by several
foreign correspondents, presumably
was heard by few persons in Ger
many because of laws forbidding
Gemians listening to foreign radio
stations.
Early this morning there had been
no official cognizance of the report
Hess had flown to Britain.
