# Freshman Golfers Down Salinas, 23-4
## 
### 
The Salinas J.C. golf squad was
defeated by Stanford's red-hot frosh
teemen last Saturday, 23-4. The
smooth-swinging Facm yearlings had
no trouble outpointing the Salinas
golfers.
Next squad slated to face the clubs
of the Card freshman team is Menlo,
which makes the journey to the
Farm's course next Saturday. And
it will be an upset if the Oak golfers
score more than 7 points against
the Stanford yearlings.
