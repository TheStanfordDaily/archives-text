# Crew Novices To Take Over Stanford Shell
## 
### TED COLE 
After completing its first season of
rowing in 22 years, the Stanford
crew has disbanded in favor of
training newcomers to the sport.
During the next two weeks the crew
novices will take out the shell and
receivc intensive coaching.
Looking back over the season,
members of the Boat Club can feel
! that some progress has been made.
Though no races have been won, the
fact that there is a crew on the
Farm is now generally known. The
crew raced well and under handi
caps for the most part, and its de
feats, in some cases quite bad, can
be attributed entirely to lack of
j practice.
Next year there will not be so
much time lost in building up equip
ment. A crew will start practicing at
the beginning of the Fall Quarter,
and will continue to row up to the
spring season.
NEW EQUIPMENT
Equipment, too, will be greatly ex-
I panded next year. It is hoped to
bring down the shell given to the
crew by the University of Wash
ington, and a new set of oars, spare
riggers, stretchers, and slides will be
bought. There is also a good chance
of having a coaching launch for the
j exclusive use of the Boat Club.
John Altucker, Bill Cilker, Jack
| Reese, and Burl Cobb will not be
back next year, but a good crop of
newcomers should greatly strength
en next year's crew. John Mac Lean,
sophomore transfer from U.C.L.A.
who rowed on the Bruin freshman
crew, will be eligible, and several
freshmen, notably Ed Mahood, will
be available. In any case, the crew
will have a much larger reserve to
draw on next year from those men
| that have been rowing all this year.
DESERVE CREDIT
Altucker and Cilker deserve a
! great deal of credit for the way they
' took their places in the crew with
j a minimum of training. Both rowed
well all season, Altucker especially
| turning into a powerful and smooth
I oar.
Jack Reese managed to hold his
i bow seat against competition from
j heavier and more powerful oarsmen
by virtue of his neat and skillful
j rowing, and Burl Cobb rowed con
j sistently throughout the season. The
j crew owes Cobb a vote of thanks
j for the way in which he worked to
keep the equipment in a constant
) state of repair.
One man that deserves a great
! deal of praise for his work through
out the season is Walt Drake, the
coxswain. Drake was forced to
steer courses he never saw before
i the race, but he did it well, and
| cleverly got the maximum work out
I of his crews. The crew was disap
j pointed that they couldn't throw
j him in the water at least once, but
| appreciated his tireless efforts none
: theless.
