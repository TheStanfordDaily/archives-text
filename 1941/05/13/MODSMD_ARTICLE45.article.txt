# 'Athertonized' Indian Football Squad Practices During Rain
## 
### 
Minus eight Athertonized frosh
stars, Stanford's '41 grid machine ac
complished some fine cavortings in
yesterday afternoon's light rain.
About halfway through the scrim- I
mage, Frankie Albert spiraled a 30-
yard toss to Bob Mastin over the
heads of the Green defense men for
a sham touchdown.
Willard Shelter moved up from
the Greens on his good defense work
at backing up the line, and big
Swede Johannessen was all over the
place behind the line on defense,
collaring the Red and Blue ball car
riers again and again.
MOVES TO LEFT
Several times the hefty right tackle
moved over to tut left side of the
line to get the ball packers.
The slippery ball didn't seem to
bother either Albert or Ray Ham
j inett, second-string quarter. Ham
mett completed a nifty heave in the
flat to Buck Fawcett that was good
for about 20 yards.
Freddy Meyer really got off his
feet going for passes. He took care
of one that looked as if it would
go over his head, slowing the ball

down with one hand to gather it in
for the catch.
PETER SKEETERS
Pete Kmetovic skeetered around
end for some nice gains, breaking
free once to go all the way through
the defensive secondary. Pete went
in for some line bucking, too, twice
skidding off right tackle to cut back
sharply and leave the Green backer
uppers completely foozled.
A couple of frosh linemen on the
Greens didn't do badly at all in
stopping the first squad at the first
of the scrimmage. Louis Sloss, right
guard, snubbed several line smashes
that came his way, and Dean Gel
wick at left end slowed down block
ers as they came through to get
backfield men.
