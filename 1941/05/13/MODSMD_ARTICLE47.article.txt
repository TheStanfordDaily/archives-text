### CHUCK SMITH 
a masterpiece of under statement. A couple of weeks I
ago, April 30 to be exact, Slants issued a warning about the Atherton
report which was due to be submitted to the members of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
To quote those prophetic but insufficient words of warning, "...there
are ominous rumblings concerning the part Stanford is to play in this
(at that time) unpublished report."
". . . don t be surprised if the axe descends this year on a couple of i
Stanford freshman athletes."
* * * *
VST/OULD THAT it were only the mentioned COUPLE and not the grand
total of EIGHT that fell before Mr. Atherton's crusading sword of !
"amateur athletics."
Every column on the Coast lias bemoaned the fact that in 99 per
cent of the cases the banished athlete was not to blame, and so I
won't go into that angle of the "Atherton story." .More important in
my mind is the future plans of ihese eight boys.
Right now most of them arc still recovering from the shock of the
news of their banishment from athletic endeavor at Stanford. And I
won't blame them in the least if they spend the next four or five days
walking around in a daze trying to get their bearings.

A BOY like Bill J oslyn or Jim Ellis or any of the other eight who |
has, for the last live years, been playing football every fall and who, '
when spring has rolled around, has been able to go out and perform on j
the baseball diamond or on the track.
You don't know what of one's life competitive athletics can be
come unless you have taken part yourself. But during the last eight I
months something else has invaded the hearts of these eight boys—Stan
lord. And now they are at the crossroads. They have to choose between
Stanford and three more years of competitive athletics.
r lhis all sounds rather dramatic but that's what it boils down to.
and I'll bet it is iust what every boy is turning over in his mind —will
it be the headlines, roaring crowds, the thrill of five yards on an olT
tackle smash or will it be cokes in the Union, Lagunita in the spring,
the friends they have made in the past eight months, and they have
made plenty?
* * * *
JWO RECENT developments have made their choice only the more !
difficult. First, in favor of their leaving Stanford and transferring to j
another college where they can continue to pass a football or throw the I
shot, was the offer by Atherton to waive the transfer rule which states
that an athlete loses a year of competition if he transfers.
And in favor of staying in Stanford was the statement by B.A.C. Chief A1
Masters that Stanford would stand firm in its promises of scholarships
despite the fact that the boys in question will not be able to compete.
* * * *
J3ROBABLY IN the best position if they stay in Stanford are the track
j men who were affected by Atherton's report, Bob Waters, Jean La- |
moure, and Bill Joslyn.
For they have close at hand the prestige and excellent coaching
offered by a San Francisco Olympic Club track team which. I am
sure, would welcome the up-and-coming 9.7 sprinter, 47-foot shot- ,
putter, and 141-foot discus thrower that Waters, Lamourc, and Jos
lyn are.
