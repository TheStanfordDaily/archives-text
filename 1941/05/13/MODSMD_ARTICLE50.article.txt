TONIGHT Excom, with a week's worth of
thought behind the matter, will examine the
case for and against the Activities Card Files.
And whether or not the card files will con
tinue to be a part of the Stanford activities pic
ture will theoretically depend upon this eve
ning's decision.
Card files have been a bone of contention
for years. They've always been plugged to the
limit, their form has been revamped, different
methods of supervision and control have been
tried—and yet, at the end of every year, back
the ycome for the "final" decision.
Seems as though Excom would be getting
tired of it all.
Tonight the following two alternatives will be
offered for discussion:
(1) Toss the files in the ash can.
(2) Revamp them; get behind them; make
them work.
The same two alternatives were offered last
year. Ditto the year before and the year before
that. The year prvious they were first created,
with only the second alternative to work on.
Speaking theoretically, the card files are the
best possible insurance of a democratic activi
ties setup for the campus. But speaking prac
tically—it hasn't worked in several years of
good, hard, sea sonable trial.
The second alternative has been chosen every
time. And in every instance the card files have
been given the utmost of assistance from every
branch of the undergraduate picture.
Take this year in particular. Card files was
given the benefit of extremely able leaders; of
a private office; of a staff of willing and com
petent assistance; and most important of Excom
action which made the signature of the card
files chairman mandatory for final committee
approval.
But it didn't work.
There's very little more that can be done, with
the exception of brushing the infant's teeth
every moryning.
And, if Excom gives it the go signal again
tonight, they'll probably be doing just that by
next year.
