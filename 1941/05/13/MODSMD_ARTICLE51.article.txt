HAD it not been for the predominance of
feminine by-lines in yesterday morning's
Daily, the greater part of the campus probably
would never have known that this particular
issue was untouched by male hands (until it
got to the printers).
Sunday afternoon and evening the country's
future Dorothy Thompsons, Cholly's, Hedda
Hoppers et al. (God forbid) reigned supreme in
the Shack.
And, of course, one of the biggest local
stories to hit the campus this year, "L'affaire
Atherton," had to come the night they were
putting out the paper. They get all the breaks.
But nevertheless the old motto "praise where
praise is due," no matter how much it hurts our
pride, is a good one to follow. They put out the
paper. They got it out ahead of time. They
ably took over all the usual male duties.
But most amazing of all, according to inside
information, they really tamed the backshop, a
feat long considered impossible by the rest of
us.
Our same spy, who was brave enough to peek
through the windows, claims that all the women
were busy working like beavers—with their
collective feet on the desks!
They've had their day, and now all that re
mains—the janitor swept up all the lipsticked
cigarette stubs—is a milk bottle of red roses on
the editor's desk and a lingering trace of per
fume.—C. B.
