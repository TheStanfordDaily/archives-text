# Sincere Ceremony
## 
### 
A MODEST sort of ceremony was staged to
pay a modest sort of man a king-sized trib
ute Saturday.
"Sam McDonald Street." the road beginning
at the northeast side of the gym and running
between the tennis courts and Angell Field
down to the highway was officially named.
At 11:30 Saturday morning, a small group
headed by Dr. Wilbur gathered for the cere

mony. Among those present were Frank Walk
er, Don Liebendorfer, J. P. Mitchell, and a num
ber more of Sam's friends. The ceremony was
short and sincere, and when it was over the first
campus street had been named for a man.
Known officially as Superintendent of Athletic
Buildings and Grounds, Sam's been just "Sam"
to every one of the countless number of Stan
ford men who have known him since he first
arrived on the Farm as a team driver in 1903.
In 1907 he was named to the position which he
now holds.
Sam's most famous to Stanford students for
the magnificent barbecues he puts on during
Labor Day. But his greatest personal accom
plishment was the personal laying down and
building of Angell Field, constructed in honor
of one of his greatest friends, Frank Angell.
Sam, who lives in the track house at the edge
of the field when he isn't at his place up in La
Honda, is a quiet, self-effacing sort of pison,
who hates to take credit for himself. But many
hundred Stanford men have known him for
what he really is.
They say that Dr. Wilbur jokingly remarked
at the Saturday ceremony, "When they told me
I was going to run for President of the Univer
sity, I would have been lucky to beat Sam Mc-
Donald for the job."
