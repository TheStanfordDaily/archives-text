ENOUGH IS TOO MUCH

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Lindbergh and "Campus Opinion" these days
seem to be an integral part of each other. Before the
question of whether or not Mr. Lindbergh has acted
disloyally toward the U. S. passes, however, I'd like
to offer my bit of opinion on this matter.
Miss Stewart maintains that the fatal kidnapping
of Lindbergh's child gave the famed flier good rea
son to leave this counrty. It occurred to me that any
body broadminded and staunch enough to contradict
public opinion and to paint—as Lindbergh has—gloomy
pictures of the inevitable success of German aggres
sion, would have enough sense not to hold American
democracy so completely responsible for the individual
criminal act that ended so tragically for him. Even
England — though they are far less publicized — has
criminals. Even England has criminals of foreign de
scent. Even England has criminals whose true home
land was the Germany to which the recently resigned
colonel points to so patronizingly.
If Miss Stewart were really all "for doing all we
can to help Britain short of war . . she would re
frain from hinting that Germany's "power" "won over
fourteen countries which ought to be enough for any
man's winning." Germany didn't "WIN over" any
body. She dug under, falsely propagandized, stabbed
in the back, and brutally bullied any nation she could
get her bloody hands on. Countless nations other than
Germany have done this before. But even then, and
certainly not now. should people go around admiring
or pointing gleefully with "I told you so" pride to the
"power' that made all that possible. "As far as in
trinsic worth and true 'Americanism' go, I don't think
'Angry,' Lindbergh, or anybody else should be denied
the right of speech. After all, American government
is still American democracy—a democracy where each
one of us has the priceless liberty to think as we
please and say what we believe with the discrimina
tion to see what is "winning" and what is "stealing,"
what is deceitful propaganda and what is plain truth,
and the strength to use our own strength, ynd, as in
dividuals. think for ourselves, we can keep this democ
racy as it was in the Ijeginning and as it is now.
And as it shall be.
