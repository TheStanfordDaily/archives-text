# Crosby, Hope Score Again In 'Zanzibar'
## 
### 
"ROAD TO ZANZIBAR," with
Bing Crosby, Boh Hope, and Doro
thy Lamour, now playing at the
Fox Stanford.
Bing Crosby and Bob Hope hit
the road together again, this time in
"Road to Zanzibar," a weak frame
work held together by comedy which
is one part radio, one part vaude
ville, and one part lunacy—and shots
of Dorothy Lamour in decollete
white dresses in the middle of the
jungle.
Crosby and Hope are a footsore
carnival combination working their
way across Africa, always one jump
ahead of the police. Hope as "Fear
less Frazier" just wants to get back
to Birch Falls, but Crosby always
interrupts with a new business ven
ture with Hope as the stooge who
gets shot out of a cannon and
wrestles with an octopus.
Before it is over, they get mixed
up with Dorothy Lamour and Una
Merkel in a safari across Africa,
where Crosby does a good job of
crooning love songs with full or
chestral accompaniment, and La
mour is as good as she always is in
jungle scenes. The route is shown
on the screen by a map with the ar
row going around in circles as the
commentator's voice says, "Week
after week our little party, undaunt
ed, plods onward with nothing to
guide them but their own remark
able sense of direction."
All in all, with Crosby holding his
own and living up to his past suc
cesses and Hope exhibiting his ad
libbing prowess, "Road to Zanzibar"
is one of the daffiest, slap-happiest
comedies to hit the U. S. screen this
season. —Glasson
