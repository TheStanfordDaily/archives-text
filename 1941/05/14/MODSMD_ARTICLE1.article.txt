r |M-IE Rudolf Hess story is still hot
ter than a fresh linotype slug,
and speculation on the why's of his
sudden arrival in a Scotch barley
field is growing in both volume and
improbability. The most far-fetched
guess so far is that the No. 3 Nazi's
departure from the Reich foreshad
ows the imminent collapse of the
whole Nazi war effort.
The reasoning on which this
theory is based is that Iless lit
erally was Hitler in everything but
name. These sources claim the "in
vincible" Keichsfuchrcr was a
creation of Iless' brain and Gocb
bels' propaganda. Hess, an ex
flier, was the first "gentleman" to
join the Nazi party, and it is as
sumed that he saw in the hyper
patriotic corporal a fine front for
his party to create a reborn Ger
many.
Hess' hatred of Communism is
supposed to have brought about his
decision <o skip the Reich. Hitler,
his creation, has allegedly turned
into a power-mad Frankenstein
monster who is determined to rule
the world. Thus, Hess feels that
peace must come now on the basis
of Germany's present, winnings, be
cause future prosecution of the
war can only end in disaster for his
beloved country.

jÂ£E THAT, and all the other stor
ies, as they may, the fact of
Hess' presence in England remains.
And, since it is fairly obvious that
the motivation for his one-way
junket are going to remain foggy
for some time, the only reasonable
things to ponder are the concrete
results of the business as it stands.
And the one basic fact is that
Britain has gotten a first class
break.
The Nazis are literally desperate
in their efforts to prove that Hess
is out of his mind. Official quar
ters in the Wilhelmstrasse have
made no attempt to disguise the
fact that the case was having a
great cffcct in official circles and
invited "all and any kind of ques
tions" in a desire to "clear up the
case." (There are any number of
similes which describe just how
"clear" this case is.)
However, convincing the German
people that Hess is the victim of
"progressive" insanity isn't too good
an idea. Imagine how the people of
this nation would feel if they sud
denly found that Cordell Hull had
been nuts all during the recent
South American diplomatic dealings.
But clearly it's the only thing Hitler
can do. Any other explanation would
make Hess a traitor to Hitler and
indicate a dangerous split in the
Nazi inner circle. Or would indicate
that some sort of secret negotiations
have blown up in Hitler's face.
Aside from the political implications
involved, the shock to German
morale cannot be disregarded.

/*ERTAINLY Hess is no raving
lunatic, and if he is slightly in
sane, it is possible that his delusions
center on only one phase of Nazi
activity. According to Dr. William
Shepard of the Stanford Medical
School, it would be possible for a
man suffering from partial delusions
to give perfectly accurate informa
tion on some subjects. Hess, as Hit
ler's closest friend, knows just about
everything that the Fuehrer himself
knows about Nazi plans.
If this is the case there must be
some slight plan-changing going on
in Berlin.
Of course, Hess need not neces
sarily be insane. He may honestly
feel that Germany's only hope lies
in a peace right now. He's just as
dangerous in this capacity, if Nazi
grand strategy calls for further
prosecution of the war.
But suppose that Hess was in
England with Hitler's blessing. This
would indicate that there was some
conniving going on between Ger
many and British high officials. But
the British now have a good chance
of finding out who the men are,
and besides they have a key Nazi
official to question and quote as
they please. And Hitler must deny
him completely.
The effect on the other powers has
been interesting, to say the least.
Rome and Moscow haven't said one
word.
