# Latin American Axis Influence Told by Stuart
## Extent of Power Depends on Outcome Of Present Conflict 
### 
A picture of a South America in
which German and other Axis influ
ence is great and in which there ex
ists a hereditary and powerful dis
like for the United States was pre
sented last night by Dr. Graham
Stuart, professor of political science,
in a talk in Memorial Hall. The pro
gram was under the auspices of the
Tuesday Evening Series.
NAZI INFLUENCE
Dr. Stuart, who returned to the
campus this week after a six-week
tour of Latin America, told his audi
ence of the great influence Nazi
Germany has exerted over the
South American countries. He traced
the growth of Nazi military organi
zations, spoke of the economic pow
er which Germany wields in respect
to South America, and warned of the
unceasing efforts of Nazi propa
gandists to convert South Americans
to the German cause.
"In the final analysis, however, the
success of Germany's attempts in
this respect depend on the result of
the European War," he pointed out.
"If England wins, the Nazi efforts
will have been futile; if the Nazis
win, our economic position will be
seriously threatened, and the Mon
roe Doctrine will be a dead letter
south of the Canal Zone."
SUMMARIZES HISTORY
The speaker summarized the
history of the United States' rela
tions with its southern neighboi's,
pointing out how the former na
tion's acts have not been in con
formity with its promises. He espe
cially scored the Hawley-Smoot
tariff in this respect.
Beginning with the Hoover admin
istration and reaching a peak at the
Lima Conference in 1938, however,
the United States has followed a
consistent and fairly effecitve friend
ly policy, according to Dr. Stuart.
In support of this contention, he
pointed out the co-operation that
has been effected since the begin
ning of the war in respect to hem
ispheric defense and American neu
trality.
Dr. Stuart was introduced by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. A
short period of questions from the
audience followed the talk.
