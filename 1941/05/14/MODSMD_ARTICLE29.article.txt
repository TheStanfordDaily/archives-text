A number without any music, any
words, and practically no dancing
will be unveiled Friday and Satur
day nights in Memorial Hall at 8:15
o'clock when Ram's Head presents
"How's Your Circulation?" — this
year's Spring Show.
Called the "Doo-Rip," the number
was originally composed—with mu
sic—by Bill Quinn as a very warm
jitterbug number. When Director
Bud Cady heard it, it. occurred to
him that parts of it "would sound
better silent." Although he states
that this is no reflection on the piece.
Finally it was'determined that the
entire thing would be noiseless, and
the idea was turned over to Shirley
Cady, who worked out a "silence
with things going on in it." The
"thing" will be rendered by Jacques
Foley, Dave Jackman, Bill Quinn,
and Margaret Elliott, with Doric
Redmon and Tommy Howard sup
plying the comedy relief.
Other dances for "How's Your
Circulation?" were arranged by
Shirley Cady and Jacques Poley.
The first of these is done to "Dirty,
Dirty Shame," during which the
dancers "sort of wander around the
stage in formation," according to
Cady.
