# Fashion Show Skit to Portray Robleites' Life
## Fair Plans to Attract Men to Union Court May 21 with Playlet 
### 
The Women's Conference County
Fair which holds sway in Union
Court on May 21 is planned this year
to get the attention of the men as
well as the women. One of the main
box office bets will be the Fashion
Show under the direction of Peggy
Jadden.
There will be two performances
of the Fashion Show during the
afternoon at 2:30 and at 4 o'clock.
Tickets are 25 cents, and the models
will visit the men's living groups to
sell (hem.
Miss Jadden advises that men and
women both will find plenty of in
terest in the show. "I guarantee
that people have never seen a show
quite like this one," said Miss Jad
den. ' We have worked particularly
hard to make it different and indi
vidual."
The show is in the form of a skit
showing the intimate life of a Stan
ford freshman, what she will wear,
where she wants to go, and where
she will go.
"This is a fine chance for Stanford
men to find out where Roble women
want to he taken and their ideas on
Ihe date subject," commented Miss
Jadden.
Particular stress is being laid on
making the models get life into the
skit instead of being the usual
glamor mannikin. The clothes which
are contributed by Palo Alto stores
have been selected with an eye to
the unusual in color. Emphasis is
laid on the gaiety and the military
theme that characterize this season.
