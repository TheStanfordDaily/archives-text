DENVER, May .13 (UP). —Amer-
ica's chances of staying out of the
war have increased from l-in-100
two or three weeks ago to "at least
a 50-50 chance," U. S. Sen. Ger
ald P. Nye, R„ N.D., told an America
First rally tonight.
"The magnificent response of the
American people to the challenge by
the interventionists to convoy
through dangerous war zones and
actually go to war gives us new
odds," Nye said.
"Tonight the chance that we can
stay out and hasten a peace that
cannot be injurious to America's
best interests is at least a 50-50
chance."
President Roosevelt, in postponing
a scheduled speech from tomorrow
night to May 27, "has heard the
people," he said.
