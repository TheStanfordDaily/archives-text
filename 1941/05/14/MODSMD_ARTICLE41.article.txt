# No Hope Seen For Trackmen In W.C. Relays
## 
### 
Saturday evening Stanford's track
team will take the field in the 15th
annual West Coast Relays with
prospects of avenging their igno
minious defeats by California and
Southern California very dim.
The five university-class relays
will be dominated Ly the Bears and
'1 rojans, with Stanford looking for
seconds and thirds. As usual, U.C.-
L.A, will not give much trouble to
the "Big Three." The two-mile re
lay will show Stanford's best team,
but unfortunately the competition
will include California, which is
seeking a world record there, and
Drake, crack Middle-West oullit in
vited by Fresno authorities after
victories in the Texas, Kansas, and
Drake relay carnivals.
RECORDS IN DANGER
Burin Skrable, Fran Olson, Blair
Hyde, and Captain Ernie Clark can
put four 880's together in near
record time, but to no avail. Substi
tuting Don McFarland for Skrable,
the same team will run the four-man
mile. However, that race also will
furnish too much competition for
the Fa rm boys with S.C. and Cal
boasting of 48-second 440 men.
With both the Bear and Trojan
sprint relay teams weakened due to
using men in other races, Stanford
has a chance to surprise and come
through with a win. In the final
relay, the distance medley, Stanford
will have its poorest team. Lack of
an outstanding miler to run against
Dick Peter and Leroy Weed puts the
Indians out of the picture no matter
how well the first three laps are run.
Also putting the best team in the
race would entail iron-man acts by
Clark, Hyde, and Skrable or Olson.
lIERTEL RUNS AGAIN?
The open 100 may or may not find
John Grant entered. Gi'ant, top
Card sprinter, will have a full eve
ning running his relay laps. Ed
Hertel should be ready to run the
open 120-yard high hurdles after
two weeks in and out of the hos
pital. His only worries will come
from Troy, but they will be more
than sufficient. Kacewicz, Hommel,
and Biewener, Trojan high-stick
men, should repeat their sweep of
last Saturday.
The broad-jumping trio of Gene
Kern, Vic Chamers, and Thor Pe
terson will give Stanford its best
chance for victory. All have become
top flight leapers, and the slightest
decline by Berkeley's Jim Jurko
vich will find one of the three in
first place. Jurkovich, a Fresno
product, may tie up in his first home
appearance since becoming famous.
Vein Hart and Jim Lincoln in the
high jump and Ed Tomasso and
Russ Peck in the pole vault should
break into the point column in their
respective events.
IIILER, EVEN BET
Emerson Hiler has an even chance
to annex discus honors. If he reaches
his early-season form he can best
Barney Wolf of Cal and Carl Mer
rfitt of S.C.. His 152-foot last Sat
urday indicates that he is headed in
that direction.
Bob Stone will continue his fight
to attain the 200-foot mark in the
javelin. He missed by seven inches
in his last outing. A1 Grey will be
looking toward his sophomore put
of 50 feet lVa inches in the shot put.
A heave of this caliber would class
him with Bruin Roger Hoerger and
Trojan Merritt.

victories in the Texas, Kansas, and
Drake relay carnivals.
RECORDS IN DANGER
Burin Skrable, Fran Olson, Blair
Hyde, and Captain Ernie Clark can
put four 880's together in near
record time, but to no avail. Substi
tuting Don McFarland for Skrable,
the same team will run the four-man
mile. However, that race also will
furnish too much competition for
the Fa rm boys with S.C. and Cal
boasting of 48-second 440 men.
With both the Bear and Trojan
sprint relay teams weakened due to
using men in other races, Stanford
has a chance to surprise and come
through with a win. In the final
relay, the distance medley, Stanford
will have its poorest team. Lack of
an outstanding miler to run against
Dick Peter and Leroy Weed puts the
Indians out of the picture no matter
how well the first three laps are run.
Also putting the best team in the
race would entail iron-man acts by
Clark, Hyde, and Skrable or Olson.
lIERTEL RUNS AGAIN?
The open 100 may or may not find
John Grant entered. Gi'ant, top
Card sprinter, will have a full eve
ning running his relay laps. Ed
Hertel should be ready to run the
open 120-yard high hurdles after
two weeks in and out of the hos
pital. His only worries will come
from Troy, but they will be more
than sufficient. Kacewicz, Hommel,
and Biewener, Trojan high-stick
men, should repeat their sweep of
last Saturday.
The broad-jumping trio of Gene
Kern, Vic Chamers, and Thor Pe
terson will give Stanford its best
chance for victory. All have become
top flight leapers, and the slightest
decline by Berkeley's Jim Jurko
vich will find one of the three in
first place. Jurkovich, a Fresno
product, may tie up in his first home
appearance since becoming famous.
Vein Hart and Jim Lincoln in the
high jump and Ed Tomasso and
Russ Peck in the pole vault should
break into the point column in their
respective events.
IIILER, EVEN BET
Emerson Hiler has an even chance
to annex discus honors. If he reaches
his early-season form he can best
Barney Wolf of Cal and Carl Mer
rfitt of S.C.. His 152-foot last Sat
urday indicates that he is headed in
that direction.
Bob Stone will continue his fight
to attain the 200-foot mark in the
javelin. He missed by seven inches
in his last outing. A1 Grey will be
looking toward his sophomore put
of 50 feet lVa inches in the shot put.
A heave of this caliber would class
him with Bruin Roger Hoerger and
Trojan Merritt.
Saturday evening Stanford's track
team will take the field in the 15th
annual West Coast Relays with
prospects of avenging their igno
minious defeats by California and
Southern California very dim.
The five university-class relays
will be dominated Ly the Bears and
'1 rojans, with Stanford looking for
seconds and thirds. As usual, U.C.-
L.A, will not give much trouble to
the "Big Three." The two-mile re
lay will show Stanford's best team,
but unfortunately the competition
will include California, which is
seeking a world record there, and
