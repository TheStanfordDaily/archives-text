### 
«T" Foreman Clark Shaughnessy reigned over a somewhat shaky prac
tice yesterday as Stanford's spring gridders rolled through another after
noon of play-calling and scrimmage.
It was tricky football the Shaughnessies played—lots of wicky-wacfcy

stuff, topped by a quadruple lateral'
that skirts the ends with the quarter
hack taking the fourth pass to com
plete the foolery.
Absent was Frankie Albert, quar
terback duties going to Ray Hani
mctt on the Reds and Frankie Forbes
on the Blues. Actual bodily contact
was at a minimum, most of the time
going to running thr.ough widely
varying offensives from the T for
mation.
Reserve linemen were a little
scanty, but both teams worked their
plays more smoothly in the dummy
scrimmage at the start than in the
actual work at the close of the
practice.
On the Blues, Bill Mannon at right
tackle and Bill Symes at right end
handled blocking assignments nicely.
On the Reds, Chuck Taylor and
Jack Francis skyrocketed back from
their guard spots on the scrimmage
line to lead interference, looking
particularly speedy on end sweeps.
Ben Morrison faked beautifully
on the dummy scrimmage, and the
two fullbacks, Willard Sheller and
"Cruncher" Crane were also im
pressive in the deception depart
ment.
