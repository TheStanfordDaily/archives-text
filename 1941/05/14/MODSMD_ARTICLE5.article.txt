# Women Discuss Vocom Report
## 
### 
Reports on women's vocational
committee and scholarships featured
a varied and full agenda treated at
a meeting Monday afternoon of
Women's Conference.
After announcing last week's ap
pointment of Jeanne Chambers as
next year's head of Women's Vocom,
Conference Chairman Martha Nord
ling read a report from Widney Wat
son, present vocational head, mak
ing suggestions to bring about closer
relations between the two groups.
Recommendation included that the
treasurer of Conference be a mem
ber of Vocom, that class meetings in
autumn be substituted for the pres
ent questionnaire, and that the edu
cational program for sophomore
committee members be enlarged.
Support for the coming County
Fair was urged since it is to raise
funds for a $300 scholarship which
the conference has presented to the
University. It was also decided at
the meeting that this award must go
to a woman who has attended Stan
ford for at least one year. A deci
sion on contributing a scholarship to
the Workers' School at Berkeley was
deferred until after the Fair.
Representatives were asked to
remind their living groups of the
tradition of no smoking on the Inner
Quad. Violations have increased this
quarter, according to Dean Yost.
A letter from the head of the
nurses at Stanford Lane Hospital
was read thanking Conference for
entertaining them at tea when they
visited the campus last Friday. Bar
bara Sheridan was chairman for the
affair.
