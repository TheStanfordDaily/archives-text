and the first visible step toward what now has
become one of the great educational institutions
of America was completed.

To Mr. and Mrs. Stanford this was an event
of profound significance. It was the nine
teenth anniversary of the birth of the son
whose monument they were building. It was
the second milestone in the great undertak
ing, the beginning and seal of the visible uni
versity to which their lives and fortunes were
consecrated.
The exercises, simple in character but rich
in emotional experience, consisted of a prayer
of dedication by one of the Trustees, the Rev.
Horatio Stebbins, an address by another of
the Trustees, Judge Lorenzo Sawyer, a hymn
sung by a chorus from the Menlo Park Presby
terian Church, the reading of the Nineteenth
Psalm, and the sealing of the cornerstone by
Mr. Stanford.
"It is fit," the orator said, "that the cornerstone
of this edifice should be laid on the anniversary
of the birth of him who, while yet a mere youth,
first suggested the founding of a university . .
