# Many Drops of Water
## 
### 
YOU know all the luscious proverbs which
run in the general vein that "many drops
of water make a drink." So let's forget about
them and get down to cases.
This concerns the Bookstore. Past years
have unfortunately seen an intangible, inde
scribable type of resentment on the part of Stan
ford students toward this organization. The
feeling was that too much over in that little
brown building was going on behind locked
doors. Prices weren't right. Rebates were too
low. You know all the complaints.
Last fall The Daily suggested that the Book
store come out of its shell and, through the use
of various and sundry publicity, let Stanford
know what kind of a dance was going on behind
those fans.
Whether or not this Daily suggestion was of
any direct influence is in itself insignificant. The
point to be emphasized is that the Bookstore
DID come out of its shell. Perhaps you have
noticed the increase in "Know Your Bookstore"
advertisements which have been running in the
columns of this newspaper during the past few
months.
This has been just one means to an end. Of
ficials of the little brown house have been mak
ing a sincere and successful effort to gain the
rightful confidence of Stanford students.
Tomorrow is the deadline for submission of
those orange rebate slips. If you submit them,
the Bookstore will, before the end of the year,
send you a check which represents your pro
portionate share of the profits. And, since
profits are being divided among hundreds of
students, each check will, from causes natural,
be small.
The result? Up will go cries complaining that
"somebody is getting gypped—and it isn't the
Bookstore."
Such cries are uncalled-for. Sitting on the
board of the Bookstore are some of the finest of
Stanford's faculty. They gyp nobody.
And did you also know that every year, the
Bookstore contributes a sizeable sum to student
aid, money which helps to pay the tuition and
general expenses of needy students?

So here is a suggestion. When you turn in
those rebate slips today or tomorrow, why not
tell the store to assign your rebate check to
student aid? You wouldn't be getting a great
deal anyway. Nor would your individual check
of 65 cents or a dollar, by itself, mean much to
student aid.
But if many of you contribute these small,
never-missed checks to this cause the sum total
will do much to assist that guy who sits next
to you in that 10 o'clock.
Many drops of water make a drink—as you

tell the store to assign your rebate check to
student aid? You wouldn't be getting a great
deal anyway. Nor would your individual check
of 65 cents or a dollar, by itself, mean much to
student aid.
But if many of you contribute these small,
never-missed checks to this cause the sum total
will do much to assist that guy who sits next
to you in that 10 o'clock.
Many drops of water make a drink—as you
already know.—B. A.
YOU know all the luscious proverbs which
run in the general vein that "many drops
of water make a drink." So let's forget about
them and get down to cases.
This concerns the Bookstore. Past years
have unfortunately seen an intangible, inde
scribable type of resentment on the part of Stan
ford students toward this organization. The
feeling was that too much over in that little
brown building was going on behind locked
doors. Prices weren't right. Rebates were too
low. You know all the complaints.
Last fall The Daily suggested that the Book
store come out of its shell and, through the use
of various and sundry publicity, let Stanford
know what kind of a dance was going on behind
those fans.
Whether or not this Daily suggestion was of
any direct influence is in itself insignificant. The
point to be emphasized is that the Bookstore
DID come out of its shell. Perhaps you have
noticed the increase in "Know Your Bookstore"
advertisements which have been running in the
columns of this newspaper during the past few
months.
This has been just one means to an end. Of
ficials of the little brown house have been mak
ing a sincere and successful effort to gain the
rightful confidence of Stanford students.
Tomorrow is the deadline for submission of
those orange rebate slips. If you submit them,
the Bookstore will, before the end of the year,
send you a check which represents your pro
portionate share of the profits. And, since
profits are being divided among hundreds of
students, each check will, from causes natural,
be small.
The result? Up will go cries complaining that
"somebody is getting gypped—and it isn't the
Bookstore."
Such cries are uncalled-for. Sitting on the
board of the Bookstore are some of the finest of
Stanford's faculty. They gyp nobody.
And did you also know that every year, the
Bookstore contributes a sizeable sum to student
aid, money which helps to pay the tuition and
general expenses of needy students?

So here is a suggestion. When you turn in
those rebate slips today or tomorrow, why not
tell the store to assign your rebate check to
student aid? You wouldn't be getting a great
deal anyway. Nor would your individual check
of 65 cents or a dollar, by itself, mean much to
student aid.
