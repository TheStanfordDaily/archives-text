# SEX MAGAZINES—A SYMPOSIUM DHR
## 
### 
LIKE to look at them, and did so when time
palled over Thanksgiving vacation, but we never
buy them. Ask Thurlow's, who stock them of social
necessity, but who sell few to Stanfordites. It's not
that they're expensive, simply that it takes an admis
sion of salacity to pick one up and do more than fur
tively peer at it —with a superior leer.
A glance at "Writer's Market" — compilation of
places to sell what you write—shows 18 publications
under the general classification, "Sex Magazines."

All of which proves that science is grand. For not
only are there 18 dirty magazines, but 18 varieties of
dirt, as careful reading of the classification indicates.
Relatively unknown is "Bedtime Stories," not car
ried by Thurlow's. Like Transamerica, it operates from
Delaware, and unlike Transamerica, "uses risque, sexy
short stories 3,000 1o 4,000 in length."
"Breezy Stories" is the type of mag found in Aunt
Hattie's lower bureau drawer "which delicately handles
sex theme." A Mrs. Fedriss selects manuscripts.
Taking all comers, however, is Gay Parisicnne, La
Paree Stories, Murder Mysteries (which coyly "en
courages sex element"), Pep Stories, Snappy, Spicy
Detective Stories, Spicy Stories, Tattle Tales and Sex
Story Book.

'J'HEY all operate from Delaware, and not one dis
claims The source of its profits.
But to prove human ingenuity unbounded, each
year sees the invention of a "new angle" in the strange
and seamy business of wholesale pruriency.
, Time was when grandpa got his thrill from the Po
lice Gazette, first publication to use legs as legs.
Today grandpa needs not read anything so direct.
He can exercise his libido under many diffei'ent guises.
For science has evolved a pill that packs both the
nobler thrills of fear and mystery, and just plain ex
citement, all within the covers of a single volume.

The approach is a new one, probably started by
the movies who cloak what's entertaining and wrong
in a pall of stuff that is entertaining and nice. Thus,
we have, in addition to such modernized primitives
as Pep Stories, such refinements as "Spicy Adventure
Stories," "Spicy Detectivc Stories," and "Spicy Mys
teries"
You will notice that sex has a co-star attraction in
each case. Alone, she is apparently not good enough
for top-billing. Which indicates that not only is science
grand, Delaware progressive, but that the eternal old
girl isn't half so good as she usta was ... or that
we're bettei*.
