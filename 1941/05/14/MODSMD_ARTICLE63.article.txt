'JUIE EDITOR, SIR:
Did you ever try to telephone a Stanford student
who is living in a private home? It is practically im
possible to get in touch with him. The "Bawlout" gives
only the street address; neither phone number nor the
name of the person under whom the telephone would
be registered is used. Would it not be possible to have
the phone number of those who do not live in frater
nities or hall units put in the "Bawlouts" after this?
I am sure all busy committee members would wel
come this change, and use it innumerable times during
the quarter.
Hopeful
