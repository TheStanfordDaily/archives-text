r EDITOR, SIR:
So, 68 per cent of this nation want war, do they?
Show me just one personâ€”not 1 per cent, but one
single person of that 68 per cent of our 130 millions
who wouldn't change his song mighty quick were he
offered a gun and asked to step over there and stop
a few bullets or what not. Judging from the last elec
tion, I thought there were only 25 million fools of
voting age in this country. Either there's been a
slight increase, or Mr. Gallup may be judged by the
company he keeps.
Not Cannon-Fodder, If You Please
