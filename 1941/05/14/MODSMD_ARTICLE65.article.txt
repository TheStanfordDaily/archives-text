EDITOR, SIR:
This is just a note to say that the Class of '41
owes its president, Art Gore, a standing vote of thanks
for his successful efforts to arrange the informal meet
ing and discussion which we seniors had with Dr.
Wilbur last Monday evening. I'm sure that all of us
who were at that meeting are going to leave Stanford
with more optimism concerning Stanford's future, our
own personal futures, and even the future of the U. S.
as a result of the two hours we spent on Lagunita
Knoll.
Thanks again. Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur and Art Gore.
