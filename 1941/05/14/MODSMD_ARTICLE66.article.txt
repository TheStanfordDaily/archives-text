# Road Foreman Spends Life 'In the Rough'
## 
### 
So you hate torn-up roads. You
have to drag out of bed five minutes
early every morning to make an 8
o'clock all because of that blasted
road work. How would you like to
spend the better part of your life
taking joy rides over ruts and rocks
and mud?
That's all part of a day's work for
I. W. Halberg, foreman of Stanford's
"Fiftieth Anniversary" road
struction job.
"I've been driving on rough roads
for 20 years now," Halberg said. "As
soon as we finish a good road, I have
to move on to fix another bad one."
This veteran construction man has
worked all over the states of Cali
fornia and Washington. He is now
employed by Piazza and Huntley at
San Jose.
LIKES NORTH
"I like this part of the country
better than any place I've lived,"
Halberg said. "Why, I wouldn't give
a nickel for three Los Angeles'sâ€”
don't like the people or the town.
You just lose your ambition down
there."
There's just one hitch to the fore
man's opinion of northern Califor
nia:
"I do wish this place would stop
having so much 'unusual' weather.
The rain holds up our job. When it's
too muddy we just have to shut
down. We would have been through
at least a week sooner if the weather
had been clear. Now we won't finish
until at least the first of June."
A.F.L. LABORERS
Although Halberg gets $12 a day
rain or shine, the common laborers
under him lose their $6 daily wage
when the roads are too muddy for
work. All 40 laborers on the job
are A.F.L. union men.
"Wages are higher in the north
than in the south of this state. That's
another one of northern California's
good points."
As to Stanford, Halberg thinks the
Farm has a pretty good bunch of
kids. .
"They do a lot of griping about
this road job of mine. But I'm used
to that."
