ADVERTISING
MAJORS
To those of you who are interested in making
advertising your future vocation, the Stanford Daily
Business Office affords you an opportunity to gain
practical experience in the field.
The activities of the Business Office cover ad
vertising layout and copy, sales and account man
agement. . . . Actual experience which you can
coordinate with the theory taught in your daily
class work.
Positions on the business staff are open to fresh
men and sophomore students. Previous experience
in selling or advertising is not absolutely necessary
to qualify for a place in this department of the
Stanford Daily.
Students interested in advertising should not
forego an opportunity of this kind. There are few
student activities which offer direct contacts to the
individual with the business world and the men
who are active in its operations.
For further information kindly apply at the Stanford
Daily Business Office, Daily Shack, between the
hours of 1 and 4 o'clock any afternoon.
