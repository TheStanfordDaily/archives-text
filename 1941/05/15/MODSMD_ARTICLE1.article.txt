### Jean Nowell 
JJUDOLF lIESS is lying in a hos
pital bed "somewhere in Eng
land" with his foot propped up on
pillows, reading an Agatha Christie
mystery, and chaffing "pretty"
nurses about his diet. From time to
time he receives visitors from the
British Foreign Office.
That's all the definite news there
is today on the Big Mystery.
Every other statement from the
British press or the 8.8.C. is pref
aced by such phrases as ". . . it is
said that . . . ," ". . . information
from high quarters . . . . .re
liable sources state . . ." and so on.
Over in Germany they have their
stoiy straight, but there's a Mr.
Goebbels to see that everything
jibes. Incidentally there are two
stories making the rounds there.
One, for home consumption, is that
Herr Hess is out of his head; and
the other, strictly for the foreign
trade, is that Hess was on a one
man peace mission, and not so crazy
at that.
British sources can't get to
gether on which rumor to plug.
The 8.8.C. is still friendly to the
German visitor and his motives.
The Loudon press is beginning to
call him all sorts of unpleasant
things.
So it would seem that at present
Herr Hess is just an instrument for
high-flying propagandaâ€”as far as
the run-of-the-mill citizen is con
cerned. And until Winston Church
ill makes his preliminary report on
the Hess affair in the House of
Commons today, he'll remain just
that. There's really no use talking
about him any more.
However, all the papers and all
the interpretive columnists will no
doubt keep the rumors flying for
some time to come.

'OMMENTING on yesterday's
various other developments is
like stepping from Cloud-Cuekoo
Land into the mundane world.
Vichy's acceptance of the Nazi "pre
liminary" peace agreement, the si
multaneous wrist-slap awarded
Japan by Great Britain and the
United States, and the von Papen
mission in Turkey, all seem like in
significant every-day events hardly
worthy of mention. But each could
rate top news play if Hess were still
at his desk in the Wilhelmstrasse.
Vichy must have paid a high
price for the concessions it got
from Germany. Aside from the
fact that it is fairly apparent
France has decided to throw in her
lot with the Nazis, the unofficial
announcement on the terms is
highly significant. France will not
be required to enter the war on
Germany's side, nor will she be
asked to put her fleet, naval bases,
or army in Africa at the Nazis'
disposal, according to prcliminary
release.
Note that absolutely nothing is
said about the status of Syria, the
point from which the other prong
of a pincer movement on Suez will
probably be initiated. Nor is any
thing said about transit of troops
through either France proper or any
of the French colonies.

JN WASHINGTON it was an
nounced that 21 "Hying fortresses"
had landed in Hawaii to strengthen
the island defenses, and in London
Anthony Eden stated in the Com
mons that there will be no softening
of British economic restrictions un
less Japan shows proper considera
tion for British interests in China.
Both of these development were
features of a dead-serious inter
national poker game, as was the
first conference of the Russian
ambassador with Cordell Hull in
more than a year. Unofficial
Washington quarters hinted Vichy
tan expect strong counteraction
from the U.S. if she enters into
active collaboration with Germany.
The Turks arc still repeating their
claims that any attempt to reach
Syria through Turkey will be met
with armed resistance. But the
Turkish foreign office said that ace
trouble-shooter von Papen had
brought "nothing unpleasant" to
Turkey from Adolf Hitler. Meaning
that Russia is not doing anything
lo stiffen the Hitler. Meaning that
Russia is not doing anything to
stiffen the Turkish backbone.
