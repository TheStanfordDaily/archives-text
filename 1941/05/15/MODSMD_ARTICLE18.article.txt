# Farm to Argue On Intervention At War Forum
## LaFollette Declines 'Red' Fay's Request To Speak at Debate 
### 
The men of Stanford who will
have lo fight this war, should the
United States enter, will let oil steam
at Monday night's War Forum when
interventionist squares off against
isolationist in verbal battle in Me
morial Hall.
Efforts of Paul "Red" Fay, whose
brain child is the newly organized
Lindbergh University movement of
America First —an isolationist plank
—were unsuccessful yesterday to se
cure Governor Philip LaFollette as
a speaker. Prominent outsiders will
represent both sides of the contro
versial subject, if it is possible to
secure them, he said.
STUDENT TO DEBATE
Student Isolationists Pete Whittle
sey and Colin McClintock yesterday
were chosen to present their views
at the War Forum, at which Inter
ventionists Johnny Ryan and Doug
Stahle will voice their opinions in
contrast.
Each will present spontaneous, un
prepared speeches for five minutes,
followed by a question period, in
which the audience will participate.
A wire to Fay from Mrs. Barbara
McDonald, chairman of the National
Speakers Bureau of the America
First Committee yesterday says:
LA FOLLETTE REGRETS
"Sorry but the Honorable Philip
LaFollette cannot accept engage
ment to speak at Stanford May 19.
He is booked in Ohio for the entire
week ,and does not have any open
dates until after the end of the
month. Letter follows."
Committee consisting of Fay, Ned
Pugh, Whittlesey, Frank Bauman,
and Dick Jones of the history depart
ment met yesterday to plan the War
Forum.
