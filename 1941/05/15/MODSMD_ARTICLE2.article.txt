# Hess Flight Made to End 'Insane War'
## British, Nazi Heads Declare Bizarre Trip Means Peace Move 
### United Press 
Great Britain and Germany agreed
Thursday that Iludolf llcss made his
bizarre flight to Britain in a "peace
mission" to see the 38-year-old Duke
of Hamilton and attempt to end the
"lunatic" war by negotiation.
But the British and Nazis differed
in their official and semi-official
statements as to the underlying rea
sons for the amazing adventure.
The British revealed that Hess had
met his friend, the Duke, on whose
estate he landed by parachute, and
had handed over valuable informa
tion "of great use to the British in
overthrowing the tyranny now exist
ing in the Reich."
HESS NO TRAITOR
The Germans said that Hess was
no traitor as the British picture him
but "was and is a good German"
who flew to Scotland to see the Duke
on a peace plan, expecting to return
to Germany in two days after con
vincing the British of "their rulers'
folly."
The British disclosed that three
months ago Hess began laying plans
for his sensational flight by writing
to the Duke of Hamilton urging him
to help end the "lunatic" war.
Hess, recovering from an injured
ankle received in his parachute
drop, was in a secretly-located hos
pital where the guards wcx-e doubled
last night to pi'event any "leak" of
the information which Hess is giv
ing, it was stated.
FRANCE AND U.S.
Consideration of America loomed
large in France. The Paris press ac
cused President Roosevelt of trying
to "blackmail" Marshal Henri Phil
ippe Petain in an effort to block the
Vichy government's "collaboration"
with Germany.
At the same time the Vichy cabi
net approved Adolf Hitler's terms
for a scheme of "collaboration." It
also agreed in effect to throw in with
the Axis in the "new order of Eu
rope," turning its back on Britain
and the United States.
German Ambassador Franz Von
Papen returned to Turkey after a
long visit in Berlin. He conferred at
once with President Ismet Inonu,
and was said to have given assur
ance that Turkey had "nothing to
fear" from Germany.

bizarre flight to Britain in a "peace
mission" to see the 38-year-old Duke
of Hamilton and attempt to end the
"lunatic" war by negotiation.
But the British and Nazis differed
in their official and semi-official
statements as to the underlying rea
sons for the amazing adventure.
The British revealed that Hess had
met his friend, the Duke, on whose
estate he landed by parachute, and
had handed over valuable informa
tion "of great use to the British in
overthrowing the tyranny now exist
ing in the Reich."
HESS NO TRAITOR
The Germans said that Hess was
no traitor as the British picture him
but "was and is a good German"
who flew to Scotland to see the Duke
on a peace plan, expecting to return
to Germany in two days after con
vincing the British of "their rulers'
folly."
The British disclosed that three
months ago Hess began laying plans
for his sensational flight by writing
to the Duke of Hamilton urging him
to help end the "lunatic" war.
Hess, recovering from an injured
ankle received in his parachute
drop, was in a secretly-located hos
pital where the guards wcx-e doubled
last night to pi'event any "leak" of
the information which Hess is giv
ing, it was stated.
FRANCE AND U.S.
Consideration of America loomed
large in France. The Paris press ac
cused President Roosevelt of trying
to "blackmail" Marshal Henri Phil
ippe Petain in an effort to block the
Vichy government's "collaboration"
with Germany.
At the same time the Vichy cabi
net approved Adolf Hitler's terms
for a scheme of "collaboration." It
also agreed in effect to throw in with
the Axis in the "new order of Eu
rope," turning its back on Britain
and the United States.
German Ambassador Franz Von
Papen returned to Turkey after a
long visit in Berlin. He conferred at
once with President Ismet Inonu,
and was said to have given assur
ance that Turkey had "nothing to
fear" from Germany.
