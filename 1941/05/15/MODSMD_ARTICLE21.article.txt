## 'Neglect Was Trouble,' Says Coast Commissioner; Admits Card Case Was 'In Some Ways Technical'

(To present the complete background of last week-end's controversy
which erased eight athletes from the Farm sports picture, The Daily today
presents the opinions of Conference Commissioner Edwin N. Atherton.

(Exclusive to The Daily)
Edwin N. Atherton lays the blame
for the recent purge of eight Stan
ford athletes primarily on Stanford's
athletic administration, and not with
the alumni.
Interviewed by The Daily in San
Francisco ysterday, Mr. Atherton
said: "Stanford failed to instruct
alumni groups who were raising
funds and working with prospective
athletes and neglected to establish
the administration of grants-in-aid
in conformity with conference rules.
Alumni groups were permitted to
usurp the power and authority of
the grant-in-aid commission, to be
established in accordance with the
rules."
PROCESS EASY
Mr. Atherton explained that the
process is as "easy as ABC." The
institution established a committee
to receive applications from inter
ested athletes, to determine their
eligibility according to need, and
then award them giants in aid.
"Stanford's commission didn't
function as it should," the Coast
Conference commissioner stated.
"The Alumni Association was al
lowed to select tho boys at first and
tentatively award them sclV>lar
ships."
PETRLICH CASE
"Take the case of Petrlich from
Utah," Mr Atherton said. "He wrote
lo Stanford, as he should, but was
told to write to a Los Angeles alum
nus, who consequently informed Pe
trlich that he would be awarded a
scholarship, as his need was veri
fied."
Petrlich came to Stanford, Mr,
Atherton continued, with the alum
nus' letter and registered, but the
commission took no action until De
cember. What if the commission de
cided the boy was not in need? ques
tioned Mr. Atherton.
"Either the alumni will pay it
quietly or the boy is out in the cold,"
he answered
PROTECTS THE BOY
The rule is designed to protect the
boy, states Mr. Atherton, pointing
out the case of Hal Petrich from
Long Beach, who was promised a
scholarship by Long Beach alumni
but was not awarded one. The Long
Beach group paid his first quarter's
tuition, but Petrich was made to
take out luition notes for winter and
spring quarter before he was al
lowed to register, explained Mr.
Atherton.
"There has been no similar trouble
at the other schools," Mr. Atherton
declared, "and Stanford is now tak
ing steps to correct it. It is very
simple and there is no reason for
failure to follow procedure."
TECHNICAL CASE
Mr. Atherton admitted that in
some ways Stanford's case is tech
nical, but said it was a definite fail -
ure to conform to the rules of the*
conference. "You can't legalize a
prohibitive situation," the commis
sioner said.
"Hie rules are made by faculty
representatives of the conference
schools," he continued. "I have no
legislative powers. I administer them
as ruled by the conference, although
the schools are not in full accord
as to interpretation of the rules,"
the commissioner added.
Stanford was not held for "re
cruiting" as were the other schools,
except in the case of Bill Nourse,
who was contacted by a Los Angelc:;
alumnus, according to Mr. Ather
ton. The alumnus, a former Farm
shot-putter, met Nourse at Beverly
Hills High and coached him on
Sunday mornings, with the motive
of "selling him Stanford," Mr. Ath
erton explained.
The commissioner, friendly, but
very business-like, expressed hys
sympathy for the "victimized" ath
letes and said he would recommend
the waiving of the transfer rules
for all athletes -except those who
obviously shop around or who are
untruthful and evasive when ques
tioned.
"It has been my practice to write
individual letters to the boys, but
with Stanford so close I wanted to
meet them and explain everything,"
Mx - . Atherton said. "I would be
glad to come down tonight or to
morrow to talk with the boys," he
concluded.

declared, "and Stanford is now tak
ing steps to correct it. It is very
simple and there is no reason for
failure to follow procedure."
TECHNICAL CASE
Mr. Atherton admitted that in
some ways Stanford's case is tech
nical, but said it was a definite fail -
ure to conform to the rules of the*
conference. "You can't legalize a
prohibitive situation," the commis
sioner said.
"Hie rules are made by faculty
representatives of the conference
schools," he continued. "I have no
legislative powers. I administer them
as ruled by the conference, although
the schools are not in full accord
as to interpretation of the rules,"
the commissioner added.
Stanford was not held for "re
cruiting" as were the other schools,
except in the case of Bill Nourse,
who was contacted by a Los Angelc:;
alumnus, according to Mr. Ather
ton. The alumnus, a former Farm
shot-putter, met Nourse at Beverly
Hills High and coached him on
Sunday mornings, with the motive
of "selling him Stanford," Mr. Ath
erton explained.
The commissioner, friendly, but
very business-like, expressed hys
sympathy for the "victimized" ath
letes and said he would recommend
the waiving of the transfer rules
for all athletes -except those who
obviously shop around or who are
untruthful and evasive when ques
tioned.
"It has been my practice to write

with Stanford so close I wanted to
meet them and explain everything,"

(Exclusive to The Daily)
Edwin N. Atherton lays the blame
for the recent purge of eight Stan
ford athletes primarily on Stanford's
athletic administration, and not with
the alumni.
Interviewed by The Daily in San
Francisco ysterday, Mr. Atherton
said: "Stanford failed to instruct
alumni groups who were raising
funds and working with prospective
athletes and neglected to establish
the administration of grants-in-aid
in conformity with conference rules.
Alumni groups were permitted to
usurp the power and authority of
the grant-in-aid commission, to be
established in accordance with the
rules."
PROCESS EASY
Mr. Atherton explained that the
process is as "easy as ABC." The
institution established a committee
to receive applications from inter
ested athletes, to determine their
eligibility according to need, and
then award them giants in aid.
"Stanford's commission didn't
function as it should," the Coast
Conference commissioner stated.
"The Alumni Association was al
lowed to select tho boys at first and
tentatively award them sclV>lar
ships."
PETRLICH CASE
"Take the case of Petrlich from
Utah," Mr Atherton said. "He wrote
lo Stanford, as he should, but was
told to write to a Los Angeles alum
nus, who consequently informed Pe
trlich that he would be awarded a
scholarship, as his need was veri
fied."
Petrlich came to Stanford, Mr,
Atherton continued, with the alum
nus' letter and registered, but the
commission took no action until De
cember. What if the commission de
cided the boy was not in need? ques
tioned Mr. Atherton.
"Either the alumni will pay it
quietly or the boy is out in the cold,"
he answered
PROTECTS THE BOY
The rule is designed to protect the
boy, states Mr. Atherton, pointing
out the case of Hal Petrich from
Long Beach, who was promised a
scholarship by Long Beach alumni
but was not awarded one. The Long
Beach group paid his first quarter's
tuition, but Petrich was made to
take out luition notes for winter and
spring quarter before he was al
lowed to register, explained Mr.
Atherton.
"There has been no similar trouble
at the other schools," Mr. Atherton
declared, "and Stanford is now tak
ing steps to correct it. It is very
simple and there is no reason for
failure to follow procedure."

institution established a committee
to receive applications from inter
ested athletes, to determine their
eligibility according to need, and
then award them giants in aid.
"Stanford's commission didn't
function as it should," the Coast
Conference commissioner stated.
"The Alumni Association was al
lowed to select tho boys at first and
tentatively award them sclV>lar
ships."
PETRLICH CASE
"Take the case of Petrlich from
Utah," Mr Atherton said. "He wrote
lo Stanford, as he should, but was
told to write to a Los Angeles alum
nus, who consequently informed Pe
trlich that he would be awarded a
scholarship, as his need was veri
fied."
Petrlich came to Stanford, Mr,
Atherton continued, with the alum
nus' letter and registered, but the
commission took no action until De
cember. What if the commission de
cided the boy was not in need? ques
tioned Mr. Atherton.
"Either the alumni will pay it
quietly or the boy is out in the cold,"
he answered
PROTECTS THE BOY
The rule is designed to protect the
boy, states Mr. Atherton, pointing
out the case of Hal Petrich from
Long Beach, who was promised a
scholarship by Long Beach alumni
but was not awarded one. The Long
Beach group paid his first quarter's
tuition, but Petrich was made to
take out luition notes for winter and
spring quarter before he was al
lowed to register, explained Mr.
Atherton.
"There has been no similar trouble
at the other schools," Mr. Atherton
declared, "and Stanford is now tak
ing steps to correct it. It is very
simple and there is no reason for
failure to follow procedure."
TECHNICAL CASE
Mr. Atherton admitted that in
some ways Stanford's case is tech
nical, but said it was a definite fail -
ure to conform to the rules of the*
conference. "You can't legalize a
prohibitive situation," the commis
sioner said.
"Hie rules are made by faculty
representatives of the conference
schools," he continued. "I have no
legislative powers. I administer them
as ruled by the conference, although
the schools are not in full accord
as to interpretation of the rules,"
the commissioner added.
Stanford was not held for "re
cruiting" as were the other schools,
except in the case of Bill Nourse,
who was contacted by a Los Angelc:;
alumnus, according to Mr. Ather
ton. The alumnus, a former Farm
shot-putter, met Nourse at Beverly
Hills High and coached him on
Sunday mornings, with the motive
of "selling him Stanford," Mr. Ath
erton explained.
The commissioner, friendly, but
very business-like, expressed hys
sympathy for the "victimized" ath
letes and said he would recommend
the waiving of the transfer rules
for all athletes -except those who
obviously shop around or who are
untruthful and evasive when ques
tioned.
"It has been my practice to write
individual letters to the boys, but
with Stanford so close I wanted to
meet them and explain everything,"
Mx - . Atherton said. "I would be
glad to come down tonight or to
morrow to talk with the boys," he
concluded.

(Exclusive to The Daily)
Edwin N. Atherton lays the blame
for the recent purge of eight Stan
ford athletes primarily on Stanford's
athletic administration, and not with
the alumni.
Interviewed by The Daily in San
Francisco ysterday, Mr. Atherton
said: "Stanford failed to instruct
alumni groups who were raising
funds and working with prospective
athletes and neglected to establish
the administration of grants-in-aid
in conformity with conference rules.
Alumni groups were permitted to
usurp the power and authority of
the grant-in-aid commission, to be
established in accordance with the
rules."
