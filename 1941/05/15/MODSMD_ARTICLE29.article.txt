# Hedley to See Labor Students
## Sophs, Juniors To Be Interviewed Sunday 
### 
Dr. George Hedley, Stanford chap
lain in '34, now director of the Pa
cific Coast Labor School, will inter
view junior and sophomore students
interested in the school Sunday at
2:15 o'clock in the Women's Club
house. The labor school, located in
Berkeley, is composed of laborers
and college students from every
California college. Between two
and four Stanford students attend
the sessions every year.
The main purpose of the school is
to promote more peaceful industrial
relations between the employers and
workers. The laborers are educated
in better methods of collective bar
gaining, while the university stu
dent, who intends to do personnel
work, is given an insight into labor
movements from the standpoint of
the employee. Women intending to
be social workers can learn the ac
tual problems of the laboring class.
Scholarships to this labor school
have been given in the past by the
Y. W. C. A., Women's Conference,
Roble, and Lagunita. The campus
committee is composed of Bob Peck
ham, Muriel Boggs, Professor Wil
liam Hopkins of economics, and Pro
fessor Phillip Buck of political sci
cnce.
