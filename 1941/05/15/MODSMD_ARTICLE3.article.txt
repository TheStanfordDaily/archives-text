# Lagunita Plans Benefit Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight Lagunita becomes Monte
Carlo when the junior women take
over for their benefit. The purpose
of the affair is to raise money for
a scholarship for a junior in Lagu
nita.
The Monte Carlo scheme will be
carried out by all types of beating
the wheel of chance. There will be
horse racing, bingo, fortune telling,
and bean guessing. A $10 money
order will be raffled off.
The committee under the direction
of Carol Rhodes promises a good
time for all, whether they are lucky
or not. Refreshments will be pro
vided to help this along. The "Night
in Monte Carlo" starts at 9:30 in the
Eucalypto social room and the last
merrymaker will be swept out at
11 o'clock.
