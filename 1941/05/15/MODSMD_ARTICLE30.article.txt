# Lunchers Hear Dr. Stuart Talk
## Traveler Says South America Is Pro-Nazi 
### 
Dr. Graham Stuart painted a
pretty grim picture of German in
filtration into South America in a
talk yesterday noon before the
Luncheon Club. Dr. Stuart first
briefly outlined his trip to South
America for the Carnegie Founda
tion, and then offered to answer
questions.
Most of the questions concerned
Germany's influence compared with
our own, and Britain's. The feeling
is very definitely anti-American and
anti-English in most South American
countries. The German embassy in
one country had two and a half
million dollars to be used for propa
ganda alone, contrasted with the
American's 60 thousand dollars.
In Brazil, Dr. Stuart said, the amiy
uses German munitions, is trained
by Germans, uses German methods,
and German equipment. At any mo
ment, Dr. Stuart believes, the Ger
mans could take over the country.
A large amount of the Nazi control
over the Germans living in South
America is achieved by threatening
the people with harm to their
families in Germany.
According to Dr. Stuart, the United
States is finally waking up to the
idea of having military missions in
South America, which the Germans
have had for a long time. We have
established an aviation mission in
Brazil, and practically control the
aviation of the country. Our factories
have put the German ones out of
business.
