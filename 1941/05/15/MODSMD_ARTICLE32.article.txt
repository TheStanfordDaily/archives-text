# Staff Prepares to Distribute New Quads Soon—They Hope
## 
### 
The fiftieth anniversary edition of the Stanford Quad is now com
pletely out of the hands of the stair. All pictures and copy are in the
hands of the publisher in San Francisco and, from here on in, it's his job.
"Regarding distribution day, we hope it will be soon," said Managing
Editor Marian Smith. "The publisher is working night shifts and will get

Quads to us as soon as possible." I
A sigh of relief has gone up from !
I the Quad office. When distribution
day comes, when the line forms in j
front«of the office and feverish hands
start a frantic search for their pic- j
tures, there will be very little';
thought as to the work that has gone j
into the finished product. But
crammed into the 385 pages is the
result of weeks, days, and hours of
headaches, problems, and worry.
However, the satisfaction that comes
on distribution day will make up for
j all of it.
WEATHER OBSTACLE
In the taking of pictures for this
edition, the weather has bucked the
staff at every turn. It was prac
tically impossible to take pictures in
the pouring rain that has blessed the
campus the greater part of the year.
When the pictures were taken and
the copy collected, the pictures were
developed and printed to size. They
were sent to the artist and a com
plete layout built with the addition
of copy. This process takes a day.
Then the whole spread is sent to
the engraver, where it remains for a
week. Then it goes back to the
printer and finally comes to the staff
for proof-reading.
GOES TO PRINTER
With ihe staff's approval stamped
on it, the layout goes back to the
printer, and 'the pages are run
through the presses. The pages are
sent to the binder and then sent
down to the Quad office. It takes
two days for all the copies to arrive.
Each seven-pound Quad is stacked
ready for distribution.
"When you carry ten seven-pound
Quads from the truck to the office,
you've gpt something," reports Mar
ian Smith.
Distribution day will soon be here
and the fiftieth anniversary Quad
will be a landmark in the previous
49 volumes that have come off the
presses.
