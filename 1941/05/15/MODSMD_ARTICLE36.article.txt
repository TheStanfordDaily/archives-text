### H. DAVID THOREAU 
Eighteen trackmen will leave the Farm Saturday morning destined for
fame and glory at the West Coast Relays in Fresno that evening.
This number of entries is exceeded in the college division only by
Southern California with :5(! men and California and (he host team, Fresno
State, with 24 entrants. For the first time in several years the Bears will

be represented by a full squad.
year, contrary to the past few, final :
exams at the Berkeley institution do
not conflict with the Fresno meet.
SPRINT TEAM
John Grant, Don McFarland, Roy
Bursch, and Bill Quackenbush will
run in the 440 and 880 relays for j
Stanford. The latter takes the place
of Bob Olden, who injured his leg
several weeks ago. Although this
quartet lack tho speed of last year's
sprint outfit, anchored by Clyde
Jeffrey, they have more than an
even chance to retain the crowns
they won in these events last year.
NO MILERS
Coach Pitch Johnson is not enter
ing a medley relay team since he
does not have a 4:15 miler to anchor
the team. With either Mushy Girard
or Paul Moore back from last year's
squad the Indians could give the
favored Cal and S.C. teams a battle.
Francis Olson, in Johnson's estima
tion, can attain this mark later in
the season, but at present he will
stick to 440 and 880 relay laps.
As well as the usual college and
junior college relays and individual
events, there will be a special 220
which will feature Hal Davis, Salinas
Jaysee flash, in an attempt to break !
Jesse Owens world record of 20.3. I
Davis ran 20.5 two weeks ago at j
Berkeley into a wind and on a slow |
track. His coach, Bud Winters, ex
pects the sophomore phenom to run |
20.1 on the fast Fresno track.
STEERS PRESENT
Les Steers and Dutch Warmerdam
have also been invited to try for
records in their events, the high
jump and pole vault. Both men now
hold unofficial world standards and
will attempt to l'aise them further.
Steers, an ex-Palo Alto High School
boy, is now competing for the Uni
versity of Oi'egon, Warmerdam, who
graduated from Fresno and took a
graduate course here, is teaching
