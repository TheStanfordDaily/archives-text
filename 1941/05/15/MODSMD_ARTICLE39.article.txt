# '44 Tracksters Go Plus Plenty
## 
### 
Not only was Stanford University's
1941 freshman track team one of its
most powerful in the last decade, but
its scholarship average is also very
high, according to the Spring Quar
ter Bawlout.
Not counting the units from inde
pendent study and biology, the 24
men on the active team have taken
629 units at Stanford and gone plus
337.
TRACKMEN LEAD
Only four men are minus—all of
them on field events. The 15 track
men with a total standing of 370 plus
269 have a wide margin over the
nine field men, who are 259 plus 68.
Three of the most outstanding men
—Bob Waters, Don Reiss, and Bob
Compton—are also high scholastic
ally. Compton has gone straight-A
for two quarters, while Reiss is 15
plus 16 and Waters is 41 plus 30.
HALF-MILER HIGH
Second to Compton is Alan Rosen
feld, half-miler, who has a 35 plus
43 record. Among those with a B
average or better are Willard Smith,
Reiss, Joe Mardesich, Ted Eberle,
and Ferris Boothe.
The highest single group are the
three hurdlers—Reiss, Mardesich,
and Eberle, who have a combined
total of 66 plus 64.
Making this record more remark
able is the fact that track is the
only sport requiring five days of
practice per week for all three quar
ters with six days per week during
spring quarter.
