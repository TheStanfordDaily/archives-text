## CHUCK SMITH, Sports Editor Albert Passes Punt Mark Set By Paul man 
### DON SELBY 
Stanford's All-American quarter
hack, Frankie Albert, took time out
from spring football practice yester
day to surpass the punting marks of
Bill Paulnian, former Indian grid
der, with both the American foot
ball and (he Australian rugby ball.
Albert booted the football 71
yards, 10 inches to best Paulman's
mark of 69 yards, 1 foot, 8 inches.
And his mark of (j7 yards, 1 foot with
the rugby ball was better than Paul
man's kick of 57 yards, 2 feet, 7
inches.
SCRIMMAGE
Meanwhile, Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy sent his griddcrs through an
other scrimmage session behind
locked gates on the varsity practice
field, following a period of blocking
practice and work by the backs and
ends on pass plays.
If last week's scrum sessions were
impressive to the bystander, yester
day's contact work was just as un
impressive, for it seemed to be just
one of those afternoons when plays
didn't click the way they are sup
posed to. There are, however, a good
number of reasons why things didn't
run so smoothly, among them being
(1) the new system of play calling,
and (2) additional plays for the grid
ders to learn.
VOOCH LIMPS
Fullback Milt Vucinich was run
ning with a slight limp due to a
heel injury suffered in scrimmage a
day or two before, but it didn't seem
to bother him a great deal, for the
slashing Slav from San Francisco
tore off a couple of nice gains on
counter plays through the middle.
On one play in particular would-be
tacklers bounced off him like the
well-known rain off the well-known
duck's back, and Vucinich didn't
stop driving until Coach Shaugh
nessy's whistle brought him to a halt
after he was in the clear.
DITLEVSON SHIFTED
Probably figuring that sophomore
Buck Fawcett could handle the
right half berth behind Eric Arm
strong, Shaughnessy has shifted
Bob Ditlevson, the made-over end,
from right half to left half, where he
backs up Skeeter Peter Kmetovic.
Due perhaps to the change in posi
tion, Ditlevson was having trouble
last night getting past the line of
scrimmage. And more than once he
failed to find the hole. Most of the
time, however, there wasn't any hole
to be found, for the defensive line
man seemed particularly adept yes
terday at piling up the interference
at the line of scrimmage on plays
inside tackle.
Outstanding on defense against the
first two elevens was Giant John
Gibson, a hefty tackle who was giv
ing the right ends plenty of trouble
on their blocking assignments. True,
Gibson played a somewhat unortho
dox game of tackle, but he was ef
fective.
Working on the first team were
Arn Meiners and Fred Meyer at
ends, Ed Stamm and Bruno Ban
ducci at tackles, Chuck Taylor and
Ed McCain at guards, Vic Lindskog
at center, Ray Hammett at quarter.
Kmetovic and Armstrong at halves,
and Vucinich at full.
