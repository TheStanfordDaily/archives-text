A1 Grey, varsity shot-putter,
should issue to all collegiate news
papers on the Pacific Coast a state -
nient saying that his name is Al
Grey, spelled Al Grey.
Last Friday the Fresno Collegian
in a feature on the Fresno Relays
called him Bob Grey. The same day
the never-wrong Daily Trojan spokt
of the Phi De!t pride as Bill Gray
spelled Bill Gray.
