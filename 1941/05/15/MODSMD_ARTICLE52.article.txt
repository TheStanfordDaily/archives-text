# The 						Whole Picture

### 
STILL raging after an interim of several days,
the question of exactly what was behind
the Atherton ruling which ended the sports ca
reers of eight Stanford athletes continues to hold
the center of interest in Farm undergraduate
circles.
The lack of information on the subject, seem
ingly including all except those intimately con
cerned with the action, has led to too much talk
with not enough savvy.
The entire question is one that affects Stanford
and her undergraduates deeply. And so the
points of the two official parties concerned—
Atherton and the Farm athletic administration—
will be presented in today's and tomorrow's
issues of The Daily.
The Coast Commissioner, in yesterday's in
terview, drew three important conclusions:
(1) That the Stanford athletic administration,
and not Farm alumni, were at fault through
oversight and neglect.
(2) That there was no hint of willful disregard
of conference rulings on the part of the B.A.C.
(3) That the interpretation of Stanford's "case"
involved the use of technicalities.
This, in brief, is the point of view of the
Coast Conference Commissioner. But until the
other point of view is presented no conclusion
can possibly be drawn.
The only deep conviction which I now have
is the feeling that eight boys who committed
no wrong whatsoever should not bear the pen
alty.
If the rules are such, they must be changed.
