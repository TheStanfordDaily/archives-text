# Businessmen's Bouquet
## 
### 
A GREAT many very kind compliments are
being given to Stanford during this, her
fiftieth anniversary year.
Her contributions in the many fields of sci
ence, culture—the individual offerings are far
too many to enumerate —to the general advance
ment of civilization as a whole have consistently
made news throughout the first history-making
fifty years of this young University of the West.
These compliments all mean a great deal to
every one of us who considers himself a mem
ber of the Stanford Family.
But when a group of businessmen start toss
ing bouquets, they really mean something.
Yesterday 400 San Francisco businessmen
met under the auspices of the Chamber of
Commerce on the anniversary of the laying of
Stanford's cornerstone. They met io pay tribute
to Stanford.
And in so doing they brought to the fore an
accomplishment often praised, but seldom in
such down-to-earth, concrete terms as would
just naturally be used by a businessman.
The second page of the anniversary celebra
tion program read as follows:
"Celebrating the Stanford University train
ing which has provided our San Francisco Bay
Area with thousands ot competent, useful
citizens . . .
5000 Businessmen
300 Chemists
500 Doctors
600 Engineers
50 Journalists
350 Lawyers
800 Teacherw
2000 Wives and Mothers"
Though these are amazing figures, they are
of the type that don't lie. And the Stanford
graduates contained in this list, almost 10,000
of them, have carried their University training
out into a useful life close to home, in the San
Francisco Bay Area.
If these were all the people ever to graduate
from Stanford, a worthy mark would have been
achieved by the University. But all the members
of "the Family" have not stayed close to home.
They have made their marks in all parts of this
country and abroad.
And down in the lower corner of this page
in the program was a gleeful little taxpayer
saying, "Didn't cost me a cent!"—C. B.
