MONDAY evening in Memorial Hall the most
pressing question which this nation today
faces—the question of isolationist versus inter
ventionist—will be posed to an undergraduate
audience at the Farm "War Forum."
Isolation.
Intervention.
Two short words, but the wrong choice could
take this democracy of ours and wrap it around
the anvil of Fascism.
It is difficult to slice through the shrouding,
inane pleas of "un-American" and "Fifth Col

umnist" with which proponents of both views
insist upon clothing their tangible points, their
real reasons. Out of the night which covers
us have come a thousand pebbles of "flag
waving" to every grain of common sense.
It is with this point in mind that the proponents
of the "War Forum" conceived their plan. The
feeling was that a down-to-earth discussion of
the basis of each view would give a tangible
ground for a correct conclusion.
Monday's question will be one concerning
which the entire nation is engaged in one de
bate after another. But rarely, if ever, have
members of the American youth—the persons
most closely connected with the question of
war versus peace—taken the question to open
forum.
Monday's speeches will be necessarily sin
cere. They will be necessarily concise. They
will be the opinions of men representing a
nation's youth.
