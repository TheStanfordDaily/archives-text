# VISIT TO GONDOLFO
## 
### 
Pope has left Rome. An old man sick of body
and spirit, not quite sure—if his actions are any
indication—of his position in a changing world, he
gathered about him his robes and his secretaries and
departed for Castel Gondolfo, his summer home in the
Alban Hills.
The chief reason for this sudden move—he goes
every summer, but never so abruptly, never so early
in the year—was the long-heralded arrival in the city
of the High Priest of Fascism, the Great God of Ge
netics, the House-painter Adolf Hitler.
The only paper in Rome which did not mention this
stirring event was the Pope's Observatorio Romano;
the only voice which was raised in criticism of the
conquering hero was his voice. In a brief address to
500 newly married couples the only dissenting com
ment in the frenzy of artificial welcome was his state
ment that the times are "sad—very sad" and that the
swastika "is certainly not the Cross."
And when it became clear that Hitler had no inten
tion of visiting the Vatican, when Mussolini realized
that his careful decoration of the street leading to the
city-state had met with the approval of neither its
head nor his proposed guest, all hopes of a Berlin-
Vatican rapprochement vanished; and the Pope de
cided to leave the city.

VFAHAT this means for Catholics in the Third Reich,
no one can say. What it means for Protestants
in Nationalist Spain, no one can say. What it means for
the position of the Papacy in international affairs, re
mains even more a mystery; and a mystery which
Pope Pius XI will probably not live long enough to
solve.
For he is in a strange position, the Captive of the
Vatican, and it may be some time before he gets out
of it. On the one hand he finds himself upholding a
Fascist government in Spain, playing patron saint and
religious overlord to Francisco Franco's rebels and
Moors; on the other he is working as hard as possible
against the Fascist government in the German Reich;
and in German Austria, 90 per cent Catholic, he is
trying to persuade rebellious cardinals to ignore Hitler
as he does rather than join in the pact of praise which
has greeted the conquest of that unfortunate country.
So he has many things to worry about; and his re
tirement to Castel Gondolfo may be only an indica
tion of his confusion, an indication that he wishes to
withdraw and consider his position. Few other expla
nations could justify his absence from the scene of
discussion so vital to him and the Church.
The steps he decides to take, the use he decides to
make of the prestige of his position, may not have
any effect on the future, or they may have a great
deal. That remains to be seen. For the present, it is
significant enough that the world's most powerful spir
itual prince has refused to stay in the same city with
the leader of the German Reich.
The Church is a force few men in history have suc
cessfully defied; and in the long run Hitler may find
himself in the position pictured in a recent cartoon
under the caption, "Little Man, What Now?': an infini
tesimal figure with a swastika armband, standing in
impotent anger in the threatening shadow of a huge
cathedral.
