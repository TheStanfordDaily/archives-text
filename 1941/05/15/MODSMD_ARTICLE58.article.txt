r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
May I, on behalf of the Stanford Convalescent
Home and its directors, express, through you, to the
students of the University how very much we all
appreciate the untiring and devoted work they did in
so successfully completing the drive for funds for the
Home?
We have learned to rely upon the untiring and gen
erous efforts of the student body to support the Home
and, thinking of it, as we do, as an activity so closely
allied to the University, I would wish, if it were pos
sible to do so, to thank individually every young man
and young woman who worked so hard in the drive,
but since I may not, I would appreciate it very much,
if you can find space in your columns, to enable me
to publicly express our thanks for their unselfish ef
forts in our behalf.
Yours sincerelv,
Ira S. Lillick.
