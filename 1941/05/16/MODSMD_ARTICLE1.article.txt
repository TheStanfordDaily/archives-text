### Jean Nowell 
|>OOSEVELT'S statement is an
eleventh hour and fifty-ninth
minute attempt to keep Vichy out
of the arms of the Reich. But cer
tain words in the statement went
much farther, and they were di
rected at the people of the United
States, not the people of France.
The President asserted in his con
clusion that Americans can hardly
believe the present government of
France would join a voluntary al
liance apparently delivering up
France and its colonial empire, "in
cluding French African colonies and
their Atlantic coasts with the men
ace which that involves to the peace
and safety of the Western Hem
isphere."
Apparently the French people are
going to enter into such an alliance,
and the words quoted above are the
first hint that Roosevelt is prob
ably not going to permit the "men
ace" of the Atlantic coast to occur.
And this may mean U.S. occupation
of Dakar, the French port in West
Africa which is within round-trip
bombing distance of Brazil and the
Panama Canal.
Admiral Darlan is apparently
trying to pull some sort of Talley
rand in his dealings with the Reich.
If you remember after France was
finally beaten and Napoleon was
safely incarcerated on St. Helena,
Talleyrand went to the Congress
of Vienna, teamed up with her
enemies, and became sort of a
servant to the Holy Alliance. Dur
ing this period France, under the
last of the Bourbons, had the most
reactionary government in Europe.

jVJEANWHILE the situation in
Asia Minor is becoming irre
trievably grave. Germany is send
ing planes and probably troops and
technicians into Iraq via Syria. The
British government announced yes
terday that it has ordered "full ac
tion" against French air bases in
Syria.
It is possible that the British will
try to get some sort of jump on the
Germans in the French Mandate.
They can certainly get large forces
into Syria from Palestine, and it is
probable that they can get them
there faster than the Germans can
get their men in from Greece. The
British fleet can make ship trans
port difficult, and plane-transport
will mean a fairly small force.
Along this line, it is interesting
to speculate on Syria's actual status.
France held her in mandate under
the League of Nations. And Vichy
formally contracted out of the League
a short time ago.

r JpURKEY, at present the nation
under Hitler's usual "squeeze,
reports that she has been given a
timely hit to abandon her alliance
with Britain and line up with the
Axis' 'new order." The major blow
a Turkish about-face would deal
Britain would be agreement on troop
transport. The Nazi divisions could
swarm into Iraq from over the Turk
ish border.
At present there are about 30 or
more German bombers in Iraq, most
of them in or near the Mosul oil
fields.
The major danger to Britain in
the Near East is a total revolt of
Islam. They've been sitting on this
lid ever since the Iraqi war began,
and the danger to them is tre
mendous. The Mohammedan world
in arms would reach from the
Mediterranean clear to British
India. Right now the Indian situa
tion is ticklish enough, with the
major trouble coming not from the
Mohammedans, but the other
Hindu faiths.
Besides this little problem they
have to worry about the danger to
Suez and their life-line. Right now
the Army of the Nile is holding
beautifully at Solium, and is still
ensconced in Tobruk. But the Ger
mans might try to move out from the
coast and attack from the inland
desert.
