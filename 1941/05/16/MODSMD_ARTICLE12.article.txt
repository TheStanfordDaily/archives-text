Stanford's student body election is one month in history and the heat
of the campaign is fast simmering out. JJut the ever-present question
still remains: is Stanford's nominating system satisfactory?
Campus nominations are executed primarily through the caucus sys
tem, iwhich is disapproved by 55 per cent of the Stanford students inter-

viewed by The Daily. Do you ap- (
prove or disapprove of Stanford's
caucus system?" was the question
asked.
GRADUATES UNDECIDED
In addition to the 55 per cent that
disapproved, 25 per cent of the
cross-section was undecided, and
only 20 per cent approved. Most of
the undecided students are grad
uates who are not familiar with
campus elections.
Students who disapproved of the
caucus system were asked, "Would
you suggest a men's nominating
committee or free nominations, with
a primary election?"
Forty-eight per cent favor free
nominations, 10 per cent advocate a
men's nominating committee, and 42
per cent are undecided.
CLASSES EVEN
Women favor a men's nominating
committee more strongly than men.
No difference in opinion is evident
between classes. Men and women
tabulations follow:
Women Men
Free nomination (50% 43%
Men's committee 20% 6%
Undecided 20% 51%
Students approving of the caucus
system explained that it has lots of
drawbacks but a satisfactory solu
tion has not been suggested. Men
in particular were adamant against
a men's nominating committee.
Typical comment from advocates
of free nominations was, "Let every
one run, regardless of affiliation, and
weed out the unqualified in a pri
mary election."
