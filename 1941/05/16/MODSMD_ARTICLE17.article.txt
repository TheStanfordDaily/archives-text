"I believe in the Honor Code,"
said Professor Georges Lemaitre,
and he proved it.
His class in modern French poetry

the blue books, and waited for the

"I have a lot to tell you about,
and not much time to tell you in.
You will please take the envelopes
with your names on them, sealed.
Choose an hour today or tomorrow
afternoon; sit down, and take the
exam. Please bring them back to
me on Friday! I trust you will not
look at your books."
