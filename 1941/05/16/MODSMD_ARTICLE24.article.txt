# Jessup Flays Conference Athletic Ruling Which "Hits Innocent Students'
## Last Week-end Decision Regarded As Inconsistent with Code Purpose; Atherton Action 'Hyper-Technical'

Athletic Control today presents the opposite point of view on the recent
"purge" of eight Stanford athletes. Yesterday Coast Commissioner Ed

The fundamental purpose of Coast
Conference athletic rulings is that of
protecting students from competition
against professionals and of keeping
illegal activities out of college ath
letics.
Stanford is strongly in favor of
this principle. We are for every
rule that prohibits athletes from ac
cepting money for participation in
college sports.
However, we are just as strongly
against penalizing any student who
has done no wrong and who has ac
cepted only help which conference
rules allow. It is difficult to accept
a set-up where even the officials of
the conference differ on their con
ception of the rules; and where eight
college athletes can be severed from
athletics because of a matter of tech
nical "procedure."
Mr. Atherton has many times stat
ed that the purpose of the confer
ence is the protection of the athletes
involved. Recent action would seem
that the present policy is in direct
variance to this.
The coast commissioner has stated
that he had no fault to find with the
action of the Stanford boys and that
they had taken no help in violation
of conference rules. He said simply
that the Stanford committee system
"didr.!t function as it should," and
that "the alumni association was al
lowed to select the boys at first and
tentatively award them scholar
ships."
The fault he found with Stanford
was purely one of procedure which
grew from a misunderstanding of an
interpretation of a set of rules, the
interpretation of which has not been
agreed upon by even the members
of the conference.
NO RULING
Nothing in the rules states that
men can be disqualified on a matter
of procedure of this type in which
there was no trace of guilt on the
part of the boys involved—never has
such action been taken with simply
procedure as the basis.
Mr. Atherton two days ago termed
some of the rules "apparently more
severe than they should be." He
expressed the belief that modifica
tion of the rules is a probability for
the June meeting, and said that the
restrictions which now are placed on
alumni may be lightened.
We feel, with Mr. Atherton, that
the rule is too strict and that the
penalty is entirely out of line with
the purpose of the code. Forcing
these boys to change to another
school in order to continue with
competitive sports is certainly tend
ing to over-emphasize athletics.
ADVICE ASKED
It, would seem that the University
at fault might have been advised of
the mistakes in its procedure in such
cases, rather than advising the stu
dents of their ineligibility.
It is to be hoped that in the near
future some sort of system can be
evolved under which innocent col
lege men are not punished, and
I which is subject to consistent inter
j pretation in the governing of Pacific
Coast collegiate athletics.
And when this is done it is also
to be hoped that the eight Stanford
students involved in this hyper-tech
nical decision will be reinstated by
the conference.
The Daily wishes to know what
Stanford thinks concerning tin
j Atherton ruling and welcomes
j Campus Opinions.

The fundamental purpose of Coast
Conference athletic rulings is that of
protecting students from competition
against professionals and of keeping
illegal activities out of college ath
letics.
Stanford is strongly in favor of
this principle. We are for every
rule that prohibits athletes from ac
cepting money for participation in
college sports.
However, we are just as strongly
against penalizing any student who
has done no wrong and who has ac
cepted only help which conference
rules allow. It is difficult to accept
a set-up where even the officials of
the conference differ on their con
ception of the rules; and where eight
college athletes can be severed from
athletics because of a matter of tech
nical "procedure."
Mr. Atherton has many times stat
ed that the purpose of the confer
ence is the protection of the athletes
involved. Recent action would seem
that the present policy is in direct
variance to this.
The coast commissioner has stated
that he had no fault to find with the
action of the Stanford boys and that
they had taken no help in violation
of conference rules. He said simply
that the Stanford committee system
"didr.!t function as it should," and
that "the alumni association was al
lowed to select the boys at first and
tentatively award them scholar
ships."
The fault he found with Stanford
was purely one of procedure which
grew from a misunderstanding of an
interpretation of a set of rules, the
interpretation of which has not been
agreed upon by even the members
of the conference.
NO RULING
Nothing in the rules states that
men can be disqualified on a matter
of procedure of this type in which
there was no trace of guilt on the
part of the boys involved—never has
such action been taken with simply
procedure as the basis.
Mr. Atherton two days ago termed
some of the rules "apparently more
severe than they should be." He
expressed the belief that modifica
tion of the rules is a probability for
the June meeting, and said that the
restrictions which now are placed on
alumni may be lightened.
We feel, with Mr. Atherton, that
the rule is too strict and that the
penalty is entirely out of line with
the purpose of the code. Forcing
these boys to change to another
school in order to continue with
competitive sports is certainly tend
ing to over-emphasize athletics.
