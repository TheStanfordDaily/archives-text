"Hayfever," sophisticated comedy
about a crazy family, written by
Noel Coward, has been shaping out
these past few weeks and is almost
ready to roll for a four-night run
in the Little Theater starting Wed
nesday.
Costumes for the play will be fur
nished by J. Magnin Co., who are
sending to their San Francisco and
Reno stores to provide the newest
in modern dress for the comedy.
Choice of costume has been clev
erly made to lit in with the complex
ion and part of the character. Janice
Schwenson, who will play the rather
catty and sophisticated guest of
Simon Bliss, will wear a smart eve
ning gown of a daring cut in yellow
chartreuse, with an orange boluo, to
complement her dark hair. For day
time cenes she will wear a mustard
green suit, with brown accessories.
BLONDE INGENUE
Peggy Mayer, who will play the
blonde Sorel, daughter of the house,
will wear the ingenue's traditional
white formal with a subdued floral
design. For the daytime she will
wear a tailored blue and white wash
dress, designed to play up the so
phisticated simplicity of the young
Britisher.
Jean Smith, who plays the oh-so
young and fluffy Jackie, guest of
David Bliss, head of the house, will
wear baby blue net to accompany
her lisps. A tan suit with saddle
stitching will be her daytime choice.
JUDITH AFFECTED
Costumes for Judith, the mother
who has just retired from the stage,
have not arrived from Reno yet, but
efforts are being made to get an elab
orate and affected garden gown, with
flowing draperies and a picture hat.
To complete this, Judith will carry
armfuls of flowers. For a formal
gown, she will have an extremely so
phisticated creation to offset false
eyelashes and hair dyed red. Ann
Meadows is playing the part.
William Girvan, newly appointed
assistant technical director, has been
in charge of the designing of the
single set It has proven of especial
interest to all the crew workers
since it is being constructed of en
tirely new mateirals, a novelty at
the theater.
COTTAGE SET
The set is the interior of an Eng
lish summer home in the cottage
style. Tan and soft blue-green
shades will be the tone for the wood
work and long horizontal windows
with potted ivy will make the picture
a completely British one.
This is the last production to be
presented this quarter by the De
partment of Speech and Drama.
Tickets are 50 cents and may be pur
chased by calling at the box office,
or by phoning Mr. Barker at P.A.
