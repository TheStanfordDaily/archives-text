# Pfyl to Run on 220 And 440 Quartets at Fresno
## Track Squad Takes Last Workout Before Leaving for Relay Carnival 
### H. DAVID THOREAU 
Baton passing practice and light
warm-ups featured the varsity track
team's last day of regular workouts
before journeying to Fresno to at
tempt the redemption of their pres
tige at the 15th Annual West Coast
Belays, Saturday night.
Stanford, defending champions,
will take 1(5 men to the Raisin City,
comprising four relay teams and
entrants in seven individual events.
PFYL FAST FELLOW
Only change in Coach Pitch John
son's plans to date is the addition of
Fireman Monte Pfyl, baseball star,
to the spring relay teams. Pfyl
opened Johnson's eyes with a 10.1
century Wednesday on a far-from
fast track. Pfyl will probably lead
oft' in both 440 and 880 relays, fol
lowed by Roy Bursch, Don McFar
land, and Johnnie Grant in that
order. McFarland will carry the
heaviest load of the evening, since
he? will run a lap on the four-man
mile relay team as well as his sprint
assignments.
Ed Hertel will definitely not run
the 320-yard high hurdles, since he
was an occupant of the men's rest
home until Wednesday. Grant is
a doubtful starter in the open 100
due to his sprint relay laps. How
ever, due to the scarcity of entries
in that event he has a good chance
of winning if fresh. The famous Hal
Davis of Salinas must run in the
junior college division.
The personnel of the mile and

two-mile relays will be Captain Er- I
I nie Clark, Blair Hyde, Francis Ol
son with McFarland in the shorter
race and Burman Skrable in the
longer.
Although both teams will run
; much better than average time, they
\ will be shadowed by Southern Cali
j fornia chasing Stanford's world rec
| ord time made last year in the mile
i event, and by California and Drake
trying for a world standard in the
two-mile race.
CHANCE FOR UPSET
Stanford has a chance for the
prize upset of the evening if they
beat the highly publicized Drake
quartet. The Missouri Valley team
set a new Drake Relay record of
7:41.1. The Indians are capable of
7:38 on their accumulative best
j times.
Stanford should run around 3:15
in the mile relay, which would put
them behind the Trojans and Bears,
J unless the Berkeley men are too
J tired from their other tasks. Dean
| Cromwell, coach of S.C., is saving
his men for this race since he is out I
j for a win and possible record.
Vic Chambers, Thor Peterson, and |
Gene Kern, all outstanding broad
jumpers, will battle with Jurko- j
vich of Cal and Wren and Bleeker j
of S.C. for top position. Chambers.'
leap of 24-6 pieces him fourth in the j
country in this event.
FOUR-WAY BATTLE
Vern Hart and Jim Lincoln will
place high in the high jump if they
can approach their best jumps of
0-5% and 6-5%.
The shot put will be a four-W£.|
battle between A1 Grey of Stanford,
Bob Biles of Cal, Roger Hoeger of
U.C.L.A. and Carl Merritt of U.S.C.
Merritt, however, holds victories
over all three of his opponents and
therefore is a slight favorite to win.
Russ Peck and Ed Tomasso with
marks of 13-6 should follow Guinn
Smith and Willard Schafer, Bean
and Trojan vaulters, in the pole
vault standings. If Peck could get
over the 14 feet he barely missed
last week he would stand a good
chance of winning.
FHESNO'S BIG DAY
Throwing against the two best
javelin tossers in the country, Bob
Stone cannot hope to get a gold
watch. However, discus thrower
Emerson Hilor boasts the best mark
| of any entrant in his event and
should win the watch which is tYje
| prize to all winners.
Southern California and Califor
nia will battle for the team honors
which Stanford won last year. High
school events in the afternoon, jun
ior college events in the afternoon
i and evening, and several special
; events feaHuring tries for worlcT
records will complete the day. which
i is Fresno's biggest of the year.

The personnel of the mile and

two-mile relays will be Captain Er- I
I nie Clark, Blair Hyde, Francis Ol
son with McFarland in the shorter
race and Burman Skrable in the
longer.
Although both teams will run
; much better than average time, they
\ will be shadowed by Southern Cali
j fornia chasing Stanford's world rec

i event, and by California and Drake
trying for a world standard in the
two-mile race.
CHANCE FOR UPSET
Stanford has a chance for the
prize upset of the evening if they
beat the highly publicized Drake
quartet. The Missouri Valley team
set a new Drake Relay record of
7:41.1. The Indians are capable of
7:38 on their accumulative best
j times.
Stanford should run around 3:15
in the mile relay, which would put
them behind the Trojans and Bears,
J unless the Berkeley men are too
J tired from their other tasks. Dean
| Cromwell, coach of S.C., is saving
his men for this race since he is out I
j for a win and possible record.
Vic Chambers, Thor Peterson, and |
Gene Kern, all outstanding broad
jumpers, will battle with Jurko- j
vich of Cal and Wren and Bleeker j
of S.C. for top position. Chambers.'
leap of 24-6 pieces him fourth in the j
country in this event.
FOUR-WAY BATTLE
Vern Hart and Jim Lincoln will
place high in the high jump if they
can approach their best jumps of
0-5% and 6-5%.
The shot put will be a four-W£.|
battle between A1 Grey of Stanford,
Bob Biles of Cal, Roger Hoeger of
U.C.L.A. and Carl Merritt of U.S.C.
Merritt, however, holds victories
over all three of his opponents and
therefore is a slight favorite to win.
Russ Peck and Ed Tomasso with
marks of 13-6 should follow Guinn
Smith and Willard Schafer, Bean
and Trojan vaulters, in the pole
vault standings. If Peck could get
over the 14 feet he barely missed
last week he would stand a good
chance of winning.
FHESNO'S BIG DAY
Throwing against the two best
javelin tossers in the country, Bob
Stone cannot hope to get a gold
watch. However, discus thrower
Emerson Hilor boasts the best mark
| of any entrant in his event and
should win the watch which is tYje
| prize to all winners.
Southern California and Califor
nia will battle for the team honors
which Stanford won last year. High
school events in the afternoon, jun
ior college events in the afternoon
i and evening, and several special
; events feaHuring tries for worlcT
records will complete the day. which
i is Fresno's biggest of the year.
Baton passing practice and light
warm-ups featured the varsity track
team's last day of regular workouts
before journeying to Fresno to at
tempt the redemption of their pres
tige at the 15th Annual West Coast
Belays, Saturday night.
Stanford, defending champions,
will take 1(5 men to the Raisin City,
comprising four relay teams and
entrants in seven individual events.
PFYL FAST FELLOW
Only change in Coach Pitch John
son's plans to date is the addition of
Fireman Monte Pfyl, baseball star,
to the spring relay teams. Pfyl
opened Johnson's eyes with a 10.1
century Wednesday on a far-from
fast track. Pfyl will probably lead
oft' in both 440 and 880 relays, fol
lowed by Roy Bursch, Don McFar
land, and Johnnie Grant in that
order. McFarland will carry the
heaviest load of the evening, since
he? will run a lap on the four-man
mile relay team as well as his sprint

was an occupant of the men's rest
home until Wednesday. Grant is
a doubtful starter in the open 100

0-5% and 6-5%.
The shot put will be a four-W£.|
battle between A1 Grey of Stanford,
Bob Biles of Cal, Roger Hoeger of
U.C.L.A. and Carl Merritt of U.S.C.
Merritt, however, holds victories
over all three of his opponents and
therefore is a slight favorite to win.
Russ Peck and Ed Tomasso with
marks of 13-6 should follow Guinn
Smith and Willard Schafer, Bean
and Trojan vaulters, in the pole
vault standings. If Peck could get
over the 14 feet he barely missed
last week he would stand a good
chance of winning.
FHESNO'S BIG DAY
Throwing against the two best
javelin tossers in the country, Bob
Stone cannot hope to get a gold
watch. However, discus thrower
Emerson Hilor boasts the best mark
| of any entrant in his event and
should win the watch which is tYje
| prize to all winners.
Southern California and Califor
nia will battle for the team honors
which Stanford won last year. High
school events in the afternoon, jun
ior college events in the afternoon
i and evening, and several special
; events feaHuring tries for worlcT
records will complete the day. which
i is Fresno's biggest of the year.
Baton passing practice and light
warm-ups featured the varsity track
team's last day of regular workouts
before journeying to Fresno to at
tempt the redemption of their pres
tige at the 15th Annual West Coast
Belays, Saturday night.
Stanford, defending champions,
will take 1(5 men to the Raisin City,
comprising four relay teams and
entrants in seven individual events.
PFYL FAST FELLOW
Only change in Coach Pitch John
son's plans to date is the addition of
Fireman Monte Pfyl, baseball star,
to the spring relay teams. Pfyl
opened Johnson's eyes with a 10.1
century Wednesday on a far-from
fast track. Pfyl will probably lead
oft' in both 440 and 880 relays, fol
lowed by Roy Bursch, Don McFar
land, and Johnnie Grant in that
order. McFarland will carry the
heaviest load of the evening, since
he? will run a lap on the four-man
mile relay team as well as his sprint
assignments.
Ed Hertel will definitely not run
the 320-yard high hurdles, since he
was an occupant of the men's rest
home until Wednesday. Grant is
a doubtful starter in the open 100
due to his sprint relay laps. How
ever, due to the scarcity of entries
in that event he has a good chance
of winning if fresh. The famous Hal
Davis of Salinas must run in the
junior college division.
The personnel of the mile and

two-mile relays will be Captain Er- I
I nie Clark, Blair Hyde, Francis Ol
son with McFarland in the shorter
race and Burman Skrable in the
longer.
Although both teams will run
; much better than average time, they
\ will be shadowed by Southern Cali
j fornia chasing Stanford's world rec
| ord time made last year in the mile
i event, and by California and Drake
trying for a world standard in the
two-mile race.
CHANCE FOR UPSET
Stanford has a chance for the
prize upset of the evening if they
beat the highly publicized Drake
quartet. The Missouri Valley team
set a new Drake Relay record of
7:41.1. The Indians are capable of
7:38 on their accumulative best
j times.
Stanford should run around 3:15
in the mile relay, which would put
them behind the Trojans and Bears,
J unless the Berkeley men are too
J tired from their other tasks. Dean
| Cromwell, coach of S.C., is saving
his men for this race since he is out I
j for a win and possible record.
Vic Chambers, Thor Peterson, and |
Gene Kern, all outstanding broad
jumpers, will battle with Jurko- j
vich of Cal and Wren and Bleeker j
of S.C. for top position. Chambers.'
leap of 24-6 pieces him fourth in the j
country in this event.
FOUR-WAY BATTLE
Vern Hart and Jim Lincoln will
place high in the high jump if they
can approach their best jumps of
0-5% and 6-5%.
