### 
WASHINGTON. May 15 (UP). —
President Roosevelt tonight issued a
statement declaring "it is inconceiv
able" that the French people will ac
cept a collaboration agreement with
Germany which will "in reality im
ply their alliance" with a power
seeking the "utter destruction of lib
erty, freedom and popular institu
tions everywhere."
Mr. Roosevelt said that such col
laboration would mean that the
French government had gone back
on its word to the United States,
given after the Franco-German ar
mistice, and hinted that relations be
tween the two governments would
be jeopardized.
Almost simultaneously with his
statement, the Treasury Department
ordered the Coast Guard to place
armed guards aboard 10 French ships
tied up in U. S ports, including the
$80,000,000 luxury liner Normandie
at New York. The order presumably
was inspired by the White House.
