### CHUCK SMITH 
and records are on the j
menu for the track fan tomor
row night. For down in Fresno a
dynamic chamber of commerce is
staging its 15th annual West Coast
Relays in conjunction with Raisin
Day.
In the past U years of Fresno
Relays a total of 15 worlds rec
ords have been set and there are
several athletes competing tomor
row who might add to this impos
ing list of world heating perform
ances much to the pleasure of the
aforementioned chamber of com
merce.
Take for instance Connie Warmer
dam, the Flying Dutchman who
competes for the Olympic Club.
Connie, back in April when the
Club met Stanford, broke his own
pole vault record by soaring 15 feet,
2'h inches and in doing so gave
every indication of possible greater
heights.
Then there is Morgan Hill's claim
to fame, Hal Davis, who will first
compete in a junior college 100-yard
dash and come back later for a race
specially designed for him to crack
Jessie Owen's mark of 20.3 in the
220. Hal, now competing for Salinas
J.C, did 20.5 against a veritable gale
on Edwards Field in the P.A. meet
some Saturdays ago and apparently
has a fine chance of breaking the
existing mark.
Thirdly, there are those two high
flying high jumpers, Les Steers,
formerly of Palo Alto High and
San Mateo J.C. but now competing
for Oregon, and U.S.C.'s one-shoe
on-one-off leaper Johnny Wilson.
Wilson has been up around (» feet
8 inches for the past two years,
while Steers has an application in
for a new world's record at (» feet
10 and some !)2nds inches.
In the relay department it seems
that those undeniable California
speedsters will lay their hands on a

| world record in the two-mile relay.
A combination of Dick Peters, John
Reese, Clarence Barnes, and Grover
Klemmer, judging from past per
j formance, can, on paper, break the
j existing mark of 7:53.8 held by an
(All-Star American team competing
in London after the '3G Olympic
Games.
The Cal team will be pressed to
win and to the possible establishing
of a record by a visiting Drake team
! which won the Kansas. Texas, Penn
! sylvania, and Drake Relays; a potent
; U.S.C. quartet; and a Stanford out
fit which gave these Californians a
heck of a battle in the Stanford-Cal
relays last March.
♦ * *
TUST where Stanford will come in
•* for many points remains to be
seen. With the surprise addition of
Monte Pfyl, who ran a 10.1 hun
dred-yard dash trial the other day,
a sprint team of Pfyl, Bursch, Mc
' Farland, and Grant should account
for a couple of seconds and thirds.
The mile and two-mile teams of,
say, Hyclefi Olson. Me Far I and, and
Clark, with Skrable replacing Mc-
Farland in the longer race, is going
; to place.
In the individual races and field
events, Johnny Grant, A1 Grey, Em
erson Hiler, A1 Grey, Vic Chambers.
