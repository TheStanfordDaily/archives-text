STANFORD, the major Coast Conference loser
under the recent Atherton action, is in a
peculiar position.
Any action which might be taken in outward
criticism of the ruling would be considered
bellyaching. Unfortunately, there is no deny
ing that fact.
And what hurts most is that Stanford's case
is strong enough, and justified enough, to pre
sent a mighty potent argument.
The recent "purge," based upon technicalities
and hypercritical interpretations, leads one to
wonder whether Coast Conference rulings are
being carried out with the purpose:
(1) Of protecting student athletes from high
pressure salesmanship and unfair practices; or
(2) Of seeing how many collegiate athletes
can be declared ineligible in as short a time
as possible.
Should the latter "interpretation" be the cor
rect one, last week-end's ruling was a tremen
dous success.

Perhaps we are being unfair to Commissioner
Atherton. In the enforcement of the written
rule he has done a supreme bit of work. But
as a man with only one year's experience with
the conference system, with collegiate athletics,
and with the code itself, Mr. Atherton was not
able to base his decisions upon close under
standing—nor did he seek or respect the opin
ions of those who have been with the system
since its inception many years ago.
That was the first of two major faults which
are apparent —the creation of an interpretation
which previously had not existed. This alone
would have created no furor, except for the
failure to follow a logical course of action.
When the technicalities had been discovered,
the apparent course of action would have been
for Atherton officially to visit the offending
university, advise it of the technicality, and
explain the correct course of action.
But instead the unoffending freshmen con
cerned were advised that they were no longer
eligible to play football at the university which
they had been attending for eight months.
Yesterday The Daily contacted seven of the
eight Stanford frosh whose Farm athletic careers
were cut short last week-end.
The seven men revealed that at high school
they had been contacted by a total of 22 uni
versities. Individually the number ranged from
one to five. And each man said that Stanford
imposed tougher entrance restrictions than any
other. One said that Stanford was his only
choice, that he had never wanted to attend an
other university.
Tough. Sorry, old man.
Is that all these freshmen deserve?

ions of those who have been with the system
since its inception many years ago.
That was the first of two major faults which
are apparent —the creation of an interpretation
which previously had not existed. This alone
would have created no furor, except for the
failure to follow a logical course of action.
When the technicalities had been discovered,
the apparent course of action would have been
for Atherton officially to visit the offending
university, advise it of the technicality, and
explain the correct course of action.
But instead the unoffending freshmen con
cerned were advised that they were no longer
eligible to play football at the university which
they had been attending for eight months.
Yesterday The Daily contacted seven of the
eight Stanford frosh whose Farm athletic careers
were cut short last week-end.
The seven men revealed that at high school
they had been contacted by a total of 22 uni
versities. Individually the number ranged from
one to five. And each man said that Stanford
imposed tougher entrance restrictions than any
other. One said that Stanford was his only
choice, that he had never wanted to attend an
other university.
Tough. Sorry, old man.
Is that all these freshmen deserve?
STANFORD, the major Coast Conference loser
under the recent Atherton action, is in a
peculiar position.
Any action which might be taken in outward
criticism of the ruling would be considered
bellyaching. Unfortunately, there is no deny
ing that fact.
And what hurts most is that Stanford's case
is strong enough, and justified enough, to pre
sent a mighty potent argument.
The recent "purge," based upon technicalities
and hypercritical interpretations, leads one to
wonder whether Coast Conference rulings are
being carried out with the purpose:
(1) Of protecting student athletes from high
pressure salesmanship and unfair practices; or
(2) Of seeing how many collegiate athletes
can be declared ineligible in as short a time
as possible.
Should the latter "interpretation" be the cor
rect one, last week-end's ruling was a tremen
dous success.

Perhaps we are being unfair to Commissioner
Atherton. In the enforcement of the written
rule he has done a supreme bit of work. But
as a man with only one year's experience with
the conference system, with collegiate athletics,
and with the code itself, Mr. Atherton was not
able to base his decisions upon close under
standing—nor did he seek or respect the opin
ions of those who have been with the system
since its inception many years ago.
