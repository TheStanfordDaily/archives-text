# Parlor Magic

"PROFESSOR GRAHAM STUART has put a
-L bug in our ear that is well worth considering
and doing something about.
Since his return from a probing trip through
South America, he has emphasized in his talks
the growing influence of the Nazi element in
those 10 republics "down under."
It is about time that someone brought this
touchy subject into the limelight again. During
these past months our eyes have been searching
eastward, toward England. As a result our
backs have been turned on South America.
Hitler is the magicion. With polish that would
put Machiavelli to shame, he has been pulling
off his fancy parlor stunts. On the European
front his right and might hand jiggles in best
magician's style. Our eyes are attracted lo mo
tion, and, as we watch, the unnoticed left hand
is stacking the deck for the next trick.
It's about time that we started looking be
hind us.
But it is better that we turn slowly. For, as
Professor Stuart expressed it, "We must face the

fact that Latin Americans have had just as real
a fear of the United States as they have had of
the Nazis."
Stop a moment and consider how true this
statement probably is. Truly human, we have
weighed and always will weigh only our own
thoughts, giving little consideration to what the
other fellow is thinking. Looking up the map,
the small South American sees in the overshad
owing North American a cannibalistic fish which
would just as soon gulp down its own spawn.
The thought, we scoff, has never entered our
minds. But we can never assure South Ameri
cans of this fact unless we first invite them here,
or go down there, for an active round of greet
ings and diplomatic pot-luck.
Beginning RIGHT NOW, America must go
out of its way to be nice to our southern neigh
bors. If we don't, too late we will realize the
veracity of that proverb which says: "Out of
sight, out of mind."
Too late, we will awake some morning to find
that, as Professor Stuari says, .. if the Nazis
win, the Monroe Doctrine will be a dead letter
south of the Canal Zone."â€”B. A.
