### JERRY MAYER 
DOING BUSINESS AGAIN
r JPHE other morning (no, not that one, the other one)
I was casually perusing The Daily's editorial col
umns, when lo and-behold (it was plenty low, let me
add) I discovered that I was the subject of one of the
editorials. Jerry Mayer is not lazy, the editorial said.
The reason Jerry Mayer has been reprinting other
people's Bull Sessions is not because he is lazy, but
because . . .
The truth is, of course, that lazy or not, it is a ridic
ulous move to reprint Bull Sessions written by other
persons. The day my first reprint appeared one of my
friends gleefully greeted me with, "Hey, that Mellin
koff is really good." Then he poked an accusing finger
deep into my midriff and snarled, "Isn't he?"
The first day I reprinted one of Allen Drury's, his
fraternity called The Daily to announce that they
were finally reading Bull Session.
And so on, and on. But that's all through now. If
the campus didn't appreciate Mellinkoff, and Drury,
and Eisenbach, and Cobbs, and Ames, I'll be darned
if they are going to achieve fame at my expense. If
these guys couldn't be appreciated then, why should
I set them up now? From now on the campus will just
have to tolerate my columns. However, we will keep
The Daily's files room open until 12 o'clock every
night so that admirers of old Bull Sessioners can drop
around to read their stuff. I will have the key, and it
may be obtained by contacting me on my raft in Half
Moon Bay.

so contacting me will receive a 500-pound
mould, which can readily be made into a key to
the files room by the simple procedure of pouring
molten metal into the mould. So you see, it will be a
comparatively simple matter to gain admittance to my
competitors' columns. However, for those who are too
lazy to go through this simple procedure, I will be at
my old stand here on page 4 for the rest of the
quarter. (The sound of fanfare rolling gently over
the hills.)
Sometimes, though, I wonder whether it is worth
it all. I told my club brothers the other day that I
was soon going to start writing my column again.
They raised their eyebrows. "Do you write a column?"
they asked. I told the linotype operator that I was
going to start writing my column again. He raised
his eyebrows. "How do you have the nerve to call
that thing a column?" he asked. "There's a much
better name for it." I told the good looking girl sitting
next to me in my history class that I was going to start
writing my column again. She raised her nose. She
didn't say anything worth repeating. 1 told my room
mates that I was going to start writing my column
again. They raised hell.
Hey, where's that file of Mellinkoff's columns.
