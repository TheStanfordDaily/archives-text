r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Again may I raise a protest against the way we
mere students are being left out of the Fiftieth Anni
versary celebration, especially in regard to the Hoover
Library.
For two years now we have listened to the rivet
ing, read innumerable features about Mr. Hoover's
marvelous collection, the carillon, and the beauty of
the building; and yet evidently no one except faculty
members will be allowed to see the inside of it until
after school closes.
May I suggest that the Libe be opened to students
on some Saturday as it was opened to the faculty a
few weeks ago.
