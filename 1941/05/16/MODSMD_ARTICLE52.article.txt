r ["<HE EDITOR, SIR:
Apparently, the recent overwhelming defeats of
the Stanford track team at the hands of California and
Southern California have brought the whole school
down on the team and Coach Pitch Johnson. In Mon
day's Daily, one of the young ladies referred to Mr.
Johnson as "that newcomer" and inferred that he will
be responsible for Stanford track becoming a "has
been" tradition.
In the first place, I don't believe that track at this
school will ever die out, no matter who is coaching.
The sport is too strongly entrenched on the Pacific
Coast; and Stanford, as the Coast's strongest school,
will always manage to keep track interest high.
Then, I think everyone in this school should re
member that Pilch Johnson came to Stanford with two
strikes already called on him. The student body ac
cepted Clark Shaughnessy with open arms, even be
fore he made his amazing record.
But the fact that Bill Ellington had been fired,
without apparent reason, set the majority of Stanford
track and field fans, and even some members of the
team, against Pitch Johnson the day he set foot on the
campus. In any sport, a new coach is working against
impossible odds when he can see that the students of
his school are not behind him
Before making any comments concerning Pitch
Johnson, I learned to know him during this process, I
learned to like him tremendously, and I wish to say
right now that I consider him one of the swellest fel
lows anyone could hope to work under as a track
aspirant. His coaching ability is yet to be tested.
His record so far does not look good; but certainly
any man, who has worked under the trying conditions
that he has this year, deserves a great deal more than
a year's trial. Just give the a fair chance before
making caustic and ridiculous comments concerning
his personality or coaching ability.
