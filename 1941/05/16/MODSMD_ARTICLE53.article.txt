# Novel Tells Of Chinatown And Its People

"WHEN THE LIVING STRIVE,"
by Richard LaPiere.
There are two things about "When
the Living Strive" that make it of
special interest to Stanfordites: (1; j
Its author is the same gentleman |
who lectures here daily at 9 and 11 j
o'clock on the subject of sociology.
(2) Its setting is San Francisco's
Chinatown, familiar ground to most
of the local population.
But such superficial points are not
the reasons why the Stanford stu
dent, or any discriminating reader,
will find this book undeniably good
reading. As a first-rate novel,
"When the Living Strive" needs no
local connections to recommend it.
It can stand on its own merits: its
colorful subject matter, excellent
style of writing, its authoritative
background.
STORY OF IMMIGRANT
"When the Living Strive" tells the
story of a man and a community—of
Lew Gan, Chinese immigrant, and of
the strange Inner City of San Fran
cisco that became his home. Through
admirable craftsmanship, the author
has artfully interwoven the two
tales in such a way that they be
come inseparable.
The history of Lew Gan is that of
an immigrant boy who arrives here
in the 'seventies. It pursues his for- |
tunes from the humble position of
chair-mender, to a houseboy in the
home of a rich Barbarian, finally to
the impressive station of a wealthy
merchant, and one of Chinatown's
leading citizens. It is the success
story of a likable man, considerably
enhanced by telling character por
trayal.
TONG WAR DAYS
The history of Chinatown covers
| the days of the tong wars, when
hoodlums and hatchet men roamed
the sinister alleys, the earthquake,
the war, and the commercialization j
of the community as a tourist mecca. |
Thankfully Mr. LaPiere has kept
his turbulent subject matter under
control and at no time lets it degen- i
erate into a lurid adventui'e yarn, j
| By a studied de-emphasis, and a
subtle technique of skipping over j
crises, he has achieved a tense sub- j
dued quality that is highly effec
tive.—Douglass
