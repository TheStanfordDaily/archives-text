# Gestring Injury 'Not Serious'
## 
### 
Injured last Wednesday night
while appearing on the Aquacade
program, Marjorie Gestring, wom
en's national high and low board
diving champion, was reported not
seriously hurt.
While climbing the ladder to the
high tower for her dive, Miss Ges
tring lost her grip and fell to the
floor of the platform, and then over
the platform side into the water.
She was taken in from the plat
form to the boathouse where Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur, watching
the performance from the boathouse
deck, administered first aid. Dr.
Russell Lee took her to the Palo
Alto Hospital, where she was treated
for cuts around the nose and knee
and body bruises. She will be re
leased from the hospital if X-rays
show that there are no internal in
juries.

world's chicle.
