### Jean Nowell 
IT IS probable that the people of
France, like most of us, desire
peace — hut quick. Unfortunately,
however, the Paris press' sudden de
mand for a Roosevelt-mediated peace
is no indication, of French public
opinion. The newspapers of Paris
have long been notorious for their
complete lack of ethics and pen
chant for reflecting the views of the
highest bidder. At present Paris is
in occupied France, and the only
bidder with any cash in Nazi Ger
many. Viola, the press is hopping
for Hitler. The fact that they either
hop, or shut up for good, is fairly
obvious.
All the events of recent weeks
would lead the observer to be
lieve that Hitler, all involved in
his war, is still making a con
certed drive for peace. The Nazi
explanation of the Hess alTair and
the Paris blasts are just the lat
est of the series. Peace right now
would mean victory for him. In
spite of what he says through his
Paris puppets, even the threat of
U.S. armed force could not make
Nazi Germany come out of the
hypothetical peace negotiations
without virtual mastery of conti
nental Europe.
Notice that the French were quiet
until after they had come under the
Reich's protective wing, and then
they made their demands. Hitler
knows that, if the United States is
really scared, she will be twice as
scared now that the Nazis and the
French have made their agreement.
* * *
AND they weren't wrong. The
United States has been teeter
ing back and forth on the brink of
war all spring, but the Vichy agree
ment has put us so close that one
whispered "Boo!" would send us
scrambling for the war-declaration
blanks we found so handy in 1917.

The whole business is so serious
that the Battle of the Atlantic has
almost moved down to second place
on the list of Things to Worry
About. The focal point of the
trouble is Dakar in French Senegal.
The importance of this big, beautiful
naval and air base on the west tip
of Africa has been cited time and
again, but its relationship to the
Caribbean has been overshadowed
by its more obvious proximity to
Brazil.

And remember the French naval
base at Martinique and their less
er bases on Guadeloupe, Devil's
Island, and French Guiana on the
mainland of South America are of
prime importance in hemisphere
defense. So is Dakar.

Hitler's prime element of strategy
is the "encircling" movement. And
it's worked to good effect every
place he's tried it. Encircling a con
tinent (North America) would, of
course, be a tough job, but on the
other hand, economic encirclement
would probably be harder for us to
fight than actual invasion.

r the Administration's pro
fessed policy literally demands
that the United States take over
those French islands. Three excel
lent French warships are stationed
at Martinique, including one first
class aircraft carrier. The U. S. navy
would not mind having them. The
French Admiral Robert has stated
that he's prepared to defend the
island, but it's a sure bet that we'll
get it in the end.

-A similar problem comes up in
connection with the Portuguese
Madciros and Azores and the
Spanish Canary groups. Already
within the limits of our Atlantic
patrol, they must not fall into the
Axis' grasp.

Dakar, however, is still the sorest
spot. And the sources are not hint
ing, they are predicting, that the
British are willing to move forces
up from South Africa to take it for
us —in exchange for an American
declaration of war.

The Monroe Doctrine must now
extend even to the coast of Africa.
All the Isolationists in the world
cannot deny the fact that any of the
new super-bombers can fly from
Africa to Brazil, to the Caribbean
Islands, even to the Panama Canal,
and back again without landing.

lieve that Hitler, all involved in
his war, is still making a con
certed drive for peace. The Nazi
explanation of the Hess alTair and
the Paris blasts are just the lat
est of the series. Peace right now
would mean victory for him. In
spite of what he says through his
Paris puppets, even the threat of
U.S. armed force could not make
Nazi Germany come out of the
hypothetical peace negotiations
without virtual mastery of conti
nental Europe.
Notice that the French were quiet
until after they had come under the
Reich's protective wing, and then
they made their demands. Hitler
knows that, if the United States is
really scared, she will be twice as
scared now that the Nazis and the
French have made their agreement.
* * *
AND they weren't wrong. The
United States has been teeter
ing back and forth on the brink of
war all spring, but the Vichy agree
ment has put us so close that one
whispered "Boo!" would send us
scrambling for the war-declaration
blanks we found so handy in 1917.

The whole business is so serious
that the Battle of the Atlantic has
almost moved down to second place
on the list of Things to Worry
About. The focal point of the
trouble is Dakar in French Senegal.
The importance of this big, beautiful
naval and air base on the west tip
of Africa has been cited time and
again, but its relationship to the
Caribbean has been overshadowed
by its more obvious proximity to
Brazil.

And remember the French naval
base at Martinique and their less
er bases on Guadeloupe, Devil's
Island, and French Guiana on the
mainland of South America are of
prime importance in hemisphere
defense. So is Dakar.

Hitler's prime element of strategy
is the "encircling" movement. And
it's worked to good effect every
place he's tried it. Encircling a con
tinent (North America) would, of
course, be a tough job, but on the
other hand, economic encirclement
would probably be harder for us to
fight than actual invasion.

r the Administration's pro
fessed policy literally demands
that the United States take over
those French islands. Three excel
lent French warships are stationed
at Martinique, including one first
class aircraft carrier. The U. S. navy
would not mind having them. The
French Admiral Robert has stated
that he's prepared to defend the
island, but it's a sure bet that we'll
get it in the end.

-A similar problem comes up in
connection with the Portuguese
Madciros and Azores and the
Spanish Canary groups. Already
within the limits of our Atlantic
patrol, they must not fall into the
Axis' grasp.

Dakar, however, is still the sorest
spot. And the sources are not hint
ing, they are predicting, that the
British are willing to move forces
up from South Africa to take it for
us —in exchange for an American
declaration of war.

The Monroe Doctrine must now
extend even to the coast of Africa.
All the Isolationists in the world
cannot deny the fact that any of the
new super-bombers can fly from
Africa to Brazil, to the Caribbean
Islands, even to the Panama Canal,
and back again without landing.
IT IS probable that the people of
France, like most of us, desire
peace — hut quick. Unfortunately,
however, the Paris press' sudden de
mand for a Roosevelt-mediated peace
is no indication, of French public
opinion. The newspapers of Paris
have long been notorious for their
complete lack of ethics and pen
chant for reflecting the views of the
highest bidder. At present Paris is
in occupied France, and the only
bidder with any cash in Nazi Ger
many. Viola, the press is hopping
for Hitler. The fact that they either
hop, or shut up for good, is fairly
obvious.

really scared, she will be twice as
scared now that the Nazis and the
French have made their agreement.

AND they weren't wrong. The
United States has been teeter
ing back and forth on the brink of
war all spring, but the Vichy agree
ment has put us so close that one
whispered "Boo!" would send us
scrambling for the war-declaration
blanks we found so handy in 1917.

The whole business is so serious
that the Battle of the Atlantic has
almost moved down to second place
on the list of Things to Worry
About. The focal point of the
trouble is Dakar in French Senegal.
The importance of this big, beautiful
naval and air base on the west tip
of Africa has been cited time and
again, but its relationship to the
Caribbean has been overshadowed
by its more obvious proximity to
Brazil.

And remember the French naval
base at Martinique and their less
er bases on Guadeloupe, Devil's
Island, and French Guiana on the
mainland of South America are of
prime importance in hemisphere
defense. So is Dakar.

Hitler's prime element of strategy
is the "encircling" movement. And
it's worked to good effect every
place he's tried it. Encircling a con
tinent (North America) would, of
course, be a tough job, but on the
other hand, economic encirclement
would probably be harder for us to
fight than actual invasion.

r the Administration's pro
fessed policy literally demands
that the United States take over
those French islands. Three excel
lent French warships are stationed
at Martinique, including one first
class aircraft carrier. The U. S. navy
would not mind having them. The
French Admiral Robert has stated
that he's prepared to defend the
island, but it's a sure bet that we'll
get it in the end.

-A similar problem comes up in
connection with the Portuguese
Madciros and Azores and the
Spanish Canary groups. Already
within the limits of our Atlantic
patrol, they must not fall into the
Axis' grasp.

Dakar, however, is still the sorest
spot. And the sources are not hint
ing, they are predicting, that the
British are willing to move forces
up from South Africa to take it for
us —in exchange for an American
declaration of war.

The Monroe Doctrine must now
extend even to the coast of Africa.
All the Isolationists in the world
cannot deny the fact that any of the
new super-bombers can fly from
Africa to Brazil, to the Caribbean
Islands, even to the Panama Canal,
and back again without landing.
IT IS probable that the people of
France, like most of us, desire
peace — hut quick. Unfortunately,
however, the Paris press' sudden de
mand for a Roosevelt-mediated peace
is no indication, of French public
opinion. The newspapers of Paris
have long been notorious for their
complete lack of ethics and pen
chant for reflecting the views of the
highest bidder. At present Paris is
in occupied France, and the only
bidder with any cash in Nazi Ger
many. Viola, the press is hopping
for Hitler. The fact that they either
hop, or shut up for good, is fairly
obvious.
All the events of recent weeks
would lead the observer to be
lieve that Hitler, all involved in
his war, is still making a con
certed drive for peace. The Nazi
explanation of the Hess alTair and
the Paris blasts are just the lat
est of the series. Peace right now
would mean victory for him. In
spite of what he says through his
Paris puppets, even the threat of
U.S. armed force could not make
Nazi Germany come out of the
hypothetical peace negotiations
without virtual mastery of conti
nental Europe.
Notice that the French were quiet
until after they had come under the
Reich's protective wing, and then
they made their demands. Hitler
knows that, if the United States is
really scared, she will be twice as
scared now that the Nazis and the
French have made their agreement.
