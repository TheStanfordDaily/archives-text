# CHIEF DISTRUSTS FIRE-WOMEN
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Stanford's Fire Chief R. E. Du
gan is worried about the draft.
He's not afraid of getting drafted
himself because the Chief is a little
beyond that age. But what, he won
ders, will he do with female fire
fighters when his roughs are in the
army?
"I can't even control my wife,"
the husky, gray-haired chief said.
"What would I do with 15 women
in this fire station?"
Dugan's objection to women fire
brigades is that they are too emo
tional. Steady nerves are a basic
qualification for a good fireman, he
claims.
FIRE EXCITES CREW
"Now this student crew of mine is
good," he said. "But I can't say
that they are either calm or col
lected when that fire bell starts
hitting. They get so excited they
nearly blow up. And if there isn't
any fire they are disappointed. But
I guess that's just human instinct."
The chief himself doesn't get much
worked up about fires these days.
He's seen too many of them.
"I can't get any kick out of a
real fire because somebody always
loses something," he said.
CIGARETTES BLAMED
Most of Stanford's fires during the
school year have been in the soror
ity and fraternity houses, according
to Chief Dugan. They are started
mainly by carelessly thrown ciga
rettes. In the summer lighted cig
arettes cause grass fires.
"One thing we never have to
worry about is lack of volunteers,"
Dugan commented. "Why, do you
know, young lady, that I have a vol
unteer force of close on to 3000 men?
