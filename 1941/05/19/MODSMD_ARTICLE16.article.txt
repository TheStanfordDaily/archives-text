# Series Offers 'Sister Eileen' In Monologue
## 
### 
"My Sister Eileen," a dramatic
reading, will be presented for the
Tuesday Evening Series tomorrow
night at 7:30 o'clock in the Audi
torium of the Memorial Hall.

"My Sister Eileen," which will be
read by Mrs. Guy Stevens Farring
ton, was dramatized from the
sketches originally published by
Ruth McKenney in the New Yorker.

The play concerns Ruth McKen
ney and her sister Eileen's experi
ences as girls arriving in New York
from Columbus, Ohio, Eileen trying
to crash the stage and Ruth doing
her best as a writer.

In spite of the hilarious situations
that center around these two young
innocents from Columbus, who rent
a studio in Greenwich Village, there
runs through it an element of truth
that makes it more than just a play
of a thousand funny lines. The
characters are all well drawn.

"My Sister Eileen" has been voted
by critics as the funniest play of the
current season. Of this play, Burns
Mantle said, "An evening of good,
clean fun and laughterâ€”people's
choice among the newer comedies."
