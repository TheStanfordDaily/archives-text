# Machinists Vote Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 18 (UP).
—The 1700 members of striking AFL
and CIO machinists unions will vote
Tuesday night at a mass meeting on
a proposal submitted by Gov. Cul
bert Olson to end their walkout
against 11 San Francisco bay area
shipyards working on $500,000,000
worth of navy and merchant ships.

Gov. Olson said he will address
the strikers and appeal to their pa
triotism to return to work. Strike
leaders will submit to the member
ship the question of a return to work
under conditions of a shipbuilding
industry stabilization agreement
reached in Seattle last month.

If the proposal is accepted, the
machinists will be sacrificing double
time for overtime —which they have
been receiving locally for about 25
years—for time and a half for ov
ertime in the Seattle "no-strike"
agreement.
