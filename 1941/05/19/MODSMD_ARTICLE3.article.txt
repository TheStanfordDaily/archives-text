# French About-Face, Ask F.R. to Mediate for Peace
## 'Effect Peace or Go to War,' Paris Paper Demands; Turks Score Vichy 
### 
VICIIY, May IS (UP). —The German-controlled French press in Paris
today suddenly turned from hitter attacks on President Roosevelt to a
concerted campaign urging United States mediation to end the war, with
support of the French government.
The Paris newspapers said that Mr. Roosevelt must face the choicc

of mediating in an effort to bring
about a compromise peace or hav
ing the United States drawn into
the war.
The press asserted that the United
States, with the strength being cre
ated by her war production, could
virtually "dictate" peace terms to
the Axis powers and Britain.
The sudden mediation campaign
was significant because it was said
to reflect French public opinion.
As a consequence of approval by
the French cabinet of Franco-Ger
man collaboration negotiations,
France was said today to be ready
to meet any choice Mr. Roosevelt
may make.
If he wants to mediate peace,
France will throw whatever weight
her influence may have behind that
peace gesture.
If the President decides not to
make a peace gesture but to back
Britain for years, if necessary,
against the Axis, then France will
fulfill her new pledge to collaborate
fully — except militarily — with the
Axis and will aid Germany in or
ganizing the Continent to insure a
maximum production of food and
industrial products.

If Mr. Roosevelt refrains from of
fering himself as a mediator, French
observers are convinced there will
be a spirited drive by the Axis pow
ers during the next six months on
both Suez and Gibraltar.
