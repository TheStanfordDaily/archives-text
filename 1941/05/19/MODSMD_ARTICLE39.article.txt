# Indian Tracksters Take Third Place Behind S.C., Cal in West Coast Relays
## 
### H. DAVID THOREAU 
Four whiriin<r cups were all that steed between Hal Davis tying one
ami breaking one world's record at Fresno Saturday in the 15th
Annual West Coast Relays. The whirling cups were a wind gauge which
showed that Hustiin' Hal the Salinas Flash was aided by a nine m.p.h.
wind when he ran his 9.4 and 20.2 races.
Stanford finished in third place in the college division with 27 points

while Southern California had
and California had 53Vz. The Trojans
took home 17 gold watches and the
Bears 10, but the Indians won nary
a timepiece, which were awarded
to first place winners. However, sev
eral seconds were garnered by the
Card team.
Don McFarland's sterling anchor
lap moved the Cards into second
place in front of Cal in the 880
relay, which S.C. won in 1:20.4,
short of Stanford's meet and world
record of 1:25 flat.
PEOPLES SETS RECORD
On his first throw Trojan Rob
Peoples threw the javelin beyond
its rightful area and into the discus
territory. An hour later when the
throw was measured it was found
to be 234 l'eet 3Va inchesâ€”a new
American record. The old mark was
.set by Peoples two years ago at 234
feet l~x inches. Martin Biles, half
of California's weight - throwing
twins, took second with a heave of
227 feet lOty inches for another of
the meet's best marks.
Emerson Hiler, Allen Grey, and
Jim Lincoln gave Stanford the ma
jority of its points in the field events
when they all took second places.
Grey made the best put of his career
at 50, feet 4 inches behind Carl Mer
ritt's 51-11 heave. This was the
Trojan's best mark too.
LINCOLN TAKES SECOND
Lincoln jumped 0 feet l :; .i inches,
a good mark considering the wind,
to tie for second in the high jump.
Johnny Wilson of U.S.C., who has a
mark better than 6 feet 9 inches, won
;it only 6-3%. Hiler threw the disc
150 feet 41/4, which put him behind a
big Bear, Barney Wolf.
The Indians barely missed what
to Coach Pitch Johnson would prob
ably have been the sweetest victory
possible when they were nosed out
of second place in the four-man two
mile relay by Drake, due to the ex
cellent final 880 by Lowell Baal,
blond Midwesterner.
BEAKS MISS RECORD
Johnson no doubt would like to
have beaten the highly publicized
Drake quartet since he was their
coach last year. They were invited
to Fresno to spur California on to
a world record in the two-mile relay,
which the Bears missed by 2.9 sec
onds, but instead found themselves
trailing Burm Skrable, Ernie Clark,
and Francis Olson for the first mile
and one-half.
Compton Jaysee and Lindsay High
School took their respective divisions
in the relay carnival that lasted from
10 a.m. to 10 p.m. The high school
trials and field events were in the
morning, the high school finals and
jaysee trials and field events were
held in the afternoon and the jay
see finals were interspersed with the
college events in the evening.
PLACES THIRD
Stanford's first appearance was in
the intercollegiate 440-yard relay
where the team of Monte Pfyl, Roy
Bursch, Bill Quackenbush, and Mc-
Farland finished in third place be
hind its two enigmas. S.C. and Cal, 1
but ahead of San Diego State's .
highly touted team.
Cal in their two-mile relay record !
attempt ran 7:38.7, or one second I
slower than Stanford's American
record. Drake and Stanford finished
J5O yards to the rear of the Bears
with U.S.C. another 50 yards back.
S.C. MONOPOLIZES
Howard Thomas of Fresno was
the only person to break into the ;
Trojans' monopoly in the 120 high
hurdles when he finished behind j
Ait Kacewicz and ahead of Don 1
Hommel in 14.4 seconds, excellent
time even with the wind.
The final event of the evening, the
mile relay, was a battle between ;
the Bears and Trojans all the way, I
with neither team taking more than
a three-yard lead at any time. GlO
- Klemmer, Cal soph, closed fast
to nose out Cliff Bourland in 3:15.5.
Stanford, only other contestant, lost
ground with every lap to finish by
themselves in approximately 3:19.
PETERSON SCORES
Thor Peterson grabbed fourth
place in ihe broad jump behind
three southern, rs, all of whom made
the best leaps of their lives. Buss !
Peck, Ed Tomaso, Vern Hart, Gene i
Kern, Bob Stone, and Vie Cham
hers failed to place in their events.
Dutch Warmeroam pooped out at
a mere 14 feet 9 inches in the spe- ,
cial pole vault after Cai's Guinn
Smith had won the regulation event J
at 14-6%.

Fifty-nine students were awarded
lower division honors for 1939-40.
