### CHUCK SMITH 
1 r | TROUGH the 27 points Stanford's
| track team scored over the
week-end, taking third in the
1 Fresno Relays, was a far cry from
the 70 points they rolled up in win
ning the annual Raisin City classic
i last year, it was good enough to earn
j them an invitation.
The invite was to the first running
j gf the so-called Los Angeles Relays,
j an attempt by civic-conscious south -
j em Californians to Â£et some of the
I attention and attendance that Fresno
gets annually with its relays.
It was mainly the strong show
ing of the 880-yard sprint relay
team of Gene Kern, Roy Bursch,
Monte Pfyl, and Don McFarand
' and tin* two-mile relay team of
I Burman Skrable, Francis Olson,
Ernie Clark, and Blair Hyde that
earned the respect of the towns
people of Los Angeles who are
sponsoring these new relays.
The four Stanford sprinters were
! light at the heels of a battery of
swift Trojans while the four half
milers that made up the two-mile
I team came within a whisker of edg
ing out for second place, behind
Cal's Klemmer & Co., a Drake team
which was undefeated until last
Saturday.

<JTANFORD'S new track coach,
k Pitch Johnson is certainly a man
of new ideas. Half way to Fresno
Saturday morning he lured the mem
bers of the track team from their
comfortable seats in the bus to look
at the scenery for 110 particular rea-

Then, with all the trackmen out
of the bus, he craftily gave the
driver orders to proceed on down
the highway a mile or so without
the tracksters. Johnson's purpose:
to give his team a mile walk for
exercise to keep them limber for
their races that evening.
