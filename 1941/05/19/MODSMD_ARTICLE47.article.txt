# Shaughnessy's Gridsters Hold 'Best Scrimmage' of Spring
## 
### 
Clark Shaughnessys' red-hot Red- 1
: skins ground out three hours on the
\ practice field Saturday afternoon for
their best scrimmage of the year's j
i spring workouts.
Drills ran from 2 to 5 o'clock, and
, some 40-odd players were on hand.
First on the slate was a dummy
| scrimmage for three squads—Reds, i
Blues, and Greens. Ihe first-string j
| Reds looked smart and fast, with a l
j backfield of Frankie Albert at quar- j
tcr, Bob Ditlevson left half, Eric j
Armstrong right half, and Miit Vu
cinich fullback. Pete Ivmetovic,
regular left half, and Freddy Meyer,
: right end, were absent.
The remainder of the Rod eleven
was intact—Amy Meiners at left
end, Ed Stamm and Bruno Banducci
it tackles, Chuck Taylor and Jack
' Francis at guards, and Vic Lindskog |
at center.
Second-string backs were Ray J
Hammett and Bob Mitchell alternat
ing at quarter, Buck Fawcett and
Ben Morrison, halves, and Willard |
i Sheller, full.
McCLINTOCK BACKS UP
Outstanding on defense for the |
third string Greens was big Colin !
j McClintock. The tall blonde line- i
| man barrelled through from his 1
backing up position behind the right 1
side of tie line for some hard tackles |
rmd piled up a couple of plays at j
the .scrimmage stripe. As a team, the j
Greens were 100 per cent better j
than usual.
E leet-footed Ditlevson adequately j
filled in Kmetovic's spot with, light- J
ning speed and good faking. Smooth
er in the dummy than in the actual I
scrimmage, Ditlevson has enough
speed to carry him through the
rough spots and seems sure for a
high spot on the '41 varsity.
Getting better with tach sue- !
reeding scrum is Fawcett, holding
down right half for the Blues. On
several occasions he drove through
guard, eluded secondary men to I
break into the clear.
VUCINICII BLOCKS
In his driving fullback position, !
Vucinich picked up some more light

feet, putting them to use in block
ing. "Vocs" shouldered beautifully
on his end assignments, giving Red
halfbacks plenty of room on off
tackle thrusts.
Albert didn't attempt enough
passes to give himself a good aver
age, only trying 10 or 12 the whole
afternoon. None of the three quar
terbacks called for many heaves. Al
bert already is hitting his mid-sea
son form on ball-handling with
Hammett and Mitchell not far be
hind.
The third-string Greens outshone
the first and second elevens on
defense, though their offensive play
was a little shaky.
Today the whole squad will prob
ably be once more at full strength
for the day's regular two-hour
workout.
