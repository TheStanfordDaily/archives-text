club sent more than 30 nun and women, skippers to Berkeley to compete
in the first annual University Championship Regatta Saturday.

racing was marked by an unusual number of capsizes and near-capsizes,
all of which Increased rather than* -
decreased the thrills of the after- |

A four-race elimination series
held in the morning for the men
was followed at noon by a two-race
series ior the women's champion
ship. This later series w;>s captured
by Dorothy Dickinson of Roble, who
won by the wide margin of two
firsts.
AFTERNOON RACES
In the afternoon a three l -race
series lor the men's championship
was sailed, in which the high-point
men of the morning competed. Fay
Penberthy of Encina proved his
consistent ability by annexing two
firsts and a third to place him well
ahead of Bob Allen and Howard
Wright, who took second and
third, respectively.

small fleet of racing dingies which
