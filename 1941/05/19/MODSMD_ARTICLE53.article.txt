# Political Hitch
## 
### 
WITH the hurly-burly of campus elections a
month-old memory, The Daily last week
conducted a campus-wide poll over the in
triguing question of whether or not Stanford's
nominating system has proven satisfactory.
The campus didn't think so.
Campus nominations operate pqrimarily
through the caucus system. And here js where
the hitch comes in.
Fifty-five per cent of those quizzed directly
disapproved of the caucus-type nomination pro
gram. Only twenty-five per cent approved while
the remainder were undecided.
Supporters of the caucus system for years
have advanced the theories that the caucus is
the democratic method of nomination, and that
Row and Hall lines make for a natural two
party system.
But caucuses are largely pressure groups and
a mixture of interlocking alliances and semi
alliances. The democracy of the system has al
most entirely disappeared. And the desirability
of drawing the Row-Hall line twice yearly—
when it is hardly distinguishable during by far
the major part of the year—is highly question
able.
What to do about it?
Two major theses have been advanced. One
is the use of a men's nominating committee
drawn along similar lines as the women's group
now in use. The other is scrapping the present
setup and creating open nominations and a
primary election.
A men's nominating committee (fantastic
sounding thing, isn't it?) would be set in opera
tion much like the women's organization. If
women's Nomcom had a perfect record behind
it the solution might be obvious. But Nomcom
has met almost as much criticism, and much of
it justified, as has the caucus system.
Open nomination and a primary election is
the remaining alternative. And while there is
no working model at hand to point to, it would
seem that tis might some day be the solution.
Caucuses haven't worked. A men's nominat
ing committee would never meet with student
body approval. But it appears that should Ex
com spend a good evening hashing over the
entire problem, they would emerge with a better
solution than we have at present, and very likely
it would be fashioned along the open nomina
tion and primary election lines.
Until then, the campus will have to keep on
saying:
"The caucus system has a lot of drawbacks,
but no one seems to be looking for a better
solution."
