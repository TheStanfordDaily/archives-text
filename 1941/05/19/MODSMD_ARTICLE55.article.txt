LONG, long ago, in the murky recesses of
a senior's reminiscences of his freshman
year, there was a battle between The Daily and
Chappie.
The battle wasn't the water-bag and paper
wad type of battle. It was just a continual beef
that harmonized with the chip Daily men carried
on their shoulders when they met a Chappie
man and vice versa. All in fun, but in dead
earnest.
Just about that year or the year after, Daily
and Chappie men and women-folk began to
find that a bull-session or two in the other's
home quarters wasn't so bad after all.

And so it is that a Daily Editor can say with
all equanimity that Ken Smith, Louie Means,
et al. have put out a doggone good humor mag
this year.
Chappie's been swell. And it's achieved the
heretofore impossibility among college humor
magazines of being funny without being smutty.
The Farm found Chappie a handy sort of
thing to have around this year. And so did a
number of other college publications which
enjoyed Chappie so much that they '"lifted"
entire sections out of it for their own use.
There isn't an all-American among college
humor magazines. But the boys would have
been up there on top this year if there was one.
Last Friday, elections moved two new men,
Barney McClure and Bill Lane, into the top spots
for the '42 Chaparral.
And when we say they'll have two tough
pairs of shoes to fill we mean it.
