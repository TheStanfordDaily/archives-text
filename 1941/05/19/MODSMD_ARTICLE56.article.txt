# BULL SESSION
## THROUGH CLOISTERED GATES 
### JERRY MAYER 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, famed as a cloistered
k shelter where discussion or knowledge of world
events fear to trespass, has awakened to the fact that
the world outside the gates of Palm Drive is in chaos.
And in Memorial Hall tonight four speakers will
argue whether America's place is to take a part in
the portentious events in Europe, or whether this
country should remain aloof and attempt to build its
destiny irrespective of the outcome of the present
world conflict.
If tonight's meeting does not fill Memorial Audi
torium to capacity it will be a severe reflection upon
Stanford. If it fails to turn out en masse for tonight's
meeting, Stanford will forfeit all right to participate in
determinations concerning America's future. Prac
tically every man in the student body should be vi
tally interested in tonight's debate, if for no other
reason than they will be involved in any plans Amer
ica may make.

Jj 'HERE are many aspects to tonight's assembly that
have excited comment on campus. When plans for
the discussion were first drafted any students—even
ardent isolationists— believed that the cards had been
stacked against the interventionists. It was pointed
out that the student responsible for the meeting is a
rabid isolationist himself and might not have been
interested in getting too outstanding speakers for the
opposition.
It has also been pointed out that the America First
Committee was extremely interested in tonight's de
bate. It has been suggested that the America First
Committee even footed the bill for telegrams sent
to various influential men, such as Lindbergh and La-
Follette, asking them to appear as speakers for the
isolationist side. The implication of the America First
aid, an extension of that organization's private feud
with the interventionists rather than an unadulter
ated, uninfluenced student forum.
But the whole thing has been satisfactorily straight
ened out now and representative speakers will talk for
each side tonight.

ITOWEVER, there is one danger concerning tonight's
meeting that perhaps should be pointed out. It
is the danger of intolerance of viewpoint. It seems to
me that each side tonight will be forced to the extreme
of its position. Therefore, any concession by either
side may be treated as a victory by the opposition.
And this is a grave danger. Because in times such
as these an extreme position may well be untenable
in a matter of just a few days. There are certain
qualifications that each side should intelligently make
to their position. But with all the furor attached to
tonight's meeting, such temperance of opinion seems
a remote possibility.
For example, one of the more prominent students
on campus recently told me that although he was an
isolationist at the present time, he admitted that his
position could be influenced by a step-up in American
production or by some significant shift in world events.
In other words, being out on the limb is all right.
But the danger comes in being so far out on the limb
that you can't clamber back to safety.
