# CAMPUS OPINION
## OPPOSITION TALK 
### 
r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Tonight there is a debate being held—lsolation
ist vs. All-Out Aid.
It is our opinion that the handling of this debate
has not been conducted as fairly as it might have
been. An isolationist conceived the idea, and has car
ried it out—.well, O.K. But, in choosing speakers to
represent the opposing side, people well known to be
upholders of that side were not contacted.
It is claimed that the Isolationists had a difficult
time finding anyone to take the opposing side. We
claim that there are people on the campus whose views
on American foreign policy are no secret —Professor
Kreps, Dr. Stuart, Sherman Mellinkoff, Dwight Hutch
inson, Bob Low, Sylvia Berry, and Mickey Levee, who
would have gladly formed an opposition.
We do not object to or criticize the representatives
chosen, and the debate will be a good one. We only
want to express the opinion that the organization of
it would have been fairer had the opposition been
contacted, invited to the meetings that were held to
plan the debate, and asked to select speakers to rep
resent them.
