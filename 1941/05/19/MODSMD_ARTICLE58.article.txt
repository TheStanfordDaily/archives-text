# JAPAN'S OIL
## 
### 
HPHE EDITOR. SIR:
I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Jerry Mayer in his
column of May Bth take Weymouth and Dirstine over
the coals. In doing this he drew some conclusions re
garding the shipment of oil to Japan that were not
based on some very important facts. The most ob
vious point that he neglected to take into account was
that Japan can buy that oil from Mexico. Further
more, Mexico would be very happy to sell that oil to
Japan now that many of their European markets have
been cut off. If one looks a little farther ahead there
are two more points that this exploitation of Mexican
oil sources at this time bring out. First the possibility
of influencing the Mexican government toward the
Axis. To be trite 'Money talks.' Secondly, building
up the necessary treaties and shipping systems at this
time means that it will not be necessary later on when
it might well be to our advantage for Japan not to get
this oil. Much of the petroleum now shipped to Japan
is now shipped in American tankers. This certainly
would not be the case if Japan were importing her
oil from Mexico rather than the United States.
Mr, Mayer seems to have forgotten all about the
embargo placed on aviation fuel just last summer. If
I remember correctly, that embargo was broad enough
to include all stocks that could be made into aviation
fuels by straight run distillation.
