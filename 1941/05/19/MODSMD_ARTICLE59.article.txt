# Farm Yawns Through Slow Spring Show
## 
### 
The 1941 Spring Show is gone, and
we hope, forgotten. However, for
those wise souls who stayed away,
here are a few observations on the
three-front opus.
"How's Your Circulation" has one
point of distinction—it was probably
the slowest paced. Ram's Head pro
duction ever seen on this campus.
To say it was sluggish would be
gross exaggeration.
Cady's work showed a consider
able amount of skill—skill expended
on confusing a rather amusing plot.
The main idea, that of running a
baby contest in conjunction with a
city election, had possibilities not
able for their failure to materialize.
SHOW LACKS STEAM
In fact, the whole production
seemed to aim at frustrating the
audience, who patiently sat for
three hours waiting for the show
to get up steam. They were still
waiting with bewilderment when
the final curtain rang down.
Mr. Cady, it appears, is attempting
to emulate the piodigious achieve
ments of Noel Coward—in combin
ing the functions of author, direc
tor, and actor. As a triple threat
theatrical man Cady is an excellent
character actor.
Another suggestion — although
ambition is admirable, it seems a bit
presumptious for a campus produc
tion to try to improve on "Of Thee
I Sing."
PLEASANT MOMENTS
But to be fair, there were some
pleasant moments in Friday night's
production. Cady himself singing,
"I'm Really Not a Bad Man," pro
vided a few bright spots. Hal Millen
in the demanding male lead, exerted
all his talent in the futile job of try
ing to keep the show moving. In
fact, Millen showed to better ad
vantage than he ever has previously,
demonstrating excellent timing, and
an ability to get the most out of
lines that gave him little to work
with. And the most attractive Mr.
Millen seems to have overcome the
self-consciousness that marred some
of the earlier performances.
Six Hits and a Dent were a wel
come feature. Their casual manner,
their appearance of enjoying them
selves, and the sly way they taper
off on perilously close harmony
make them outstanding in any com
pany. Moreover, in Elena Bruton
they have a corner on attractive
ness—for looks, singing, and per
sonality.
FUNNY!
B. Q. Morgan, Doris Smith, and
Dori Redmon all were outstanding
in minor character parts.
Spring Show, 1941, is now a thing
of the past.—Douglass
