### Jean Nowell 
-FACTOR in the new Vichy
policy of collaboration with
Germany is the French nation. Old
Marshall Petain can call for "un
questioning obedience," his aides can
clicker with Hitler, the censored
Vichy press can maintain discreet
silences, and the Paris press can yell
its head off; nevertheless the spirit
of the French people is still rela
tively unknown.
One tiling is certain: The French
cannot hut hope for a return to the
freedom they enjoyed before their
country fell. And it's a cinch
they'll never be free as long as
Hitler is calling the plays. Vichy,
of course, got a lot for the be
draggled French when she entered
her new relationship with Ger
many. But just the same it will
be interesting to see what hap
pens when the French really get
involved in some sort of fight with
their former allies.
It would be wish-thinking of the
most nebulous sort to prcdict any
.sort of French "people's revolt"
which would unseat the Nazi rulers
and throw France back into the war
on the Allied side. Under present
conditions such a revolt could not
come until Germany itself were
near collapse.

||OWEVER, Vichy has announced
that France will fight any army
(except a German army) which
takes a whack at her colonies. She
is hinting at an attempt to recap
ture the "Free French" colonies, and
already her anti-aircraft have fired
on British planes over Syria.
This speculation then is based
on just what sort of fight the
French will put up. Already it's
been proved that the Italians are
not such sharp soldiers—primarily
because their hearts are not in the
fight. It's even been reported that,
during the present siege of To
bruk, German troops have fired
into the ranks of retreating Ital
ians.
It's a case of divided allegiance.
If the French are convinced that the
coming fight against Britain and the
United States will bring them a free
dom and first-class world status
again, they may put up a good argu
ment. But if they half believe that
they're just fighting for the glory of
Greater Germany, they may be no
better allies than the Italians.

jyjEANWHILE the war seemed to
be at stalemate as far as phys
ical action was concerned. In Iraq
the British have had no reverses,
but the arrival of effective German
aid has revived Rashid Ali Beg's
reeling forces, and Empire troops
have made no appreciable gains.
Over in Libya, the German arm
ies are smack on the Egyptian
border. Both sides have occupied
Solium in the last week or two,
but neither has been able to hold
it and the town has taken on the
status of a desert No-Man's-Land.
The Duke of Aosta, Italian viceroy
in Ethiopia, will surrender today,
leaving only two minor pockets of
Italian resistance in that country.
Released for service in either Libya
or the Levant will be some 10 or 15
thousand Britishers — and probably
General Wavcll is very glad indeed.

r IMfE whole question of Syria is
probably responsible for the
halt in the proceedings. If Britain
were to attack Syria while she still
has a chance to take it, she might
bring France back into the war. On
the other hand, if she doesn't attack,
Germany may consolidate her posi
tions there and possibly gather
enough forces to attack Suez through
Palestine.
Istanbul was strangely silent to
night. Von Papen's negotiations
there are of prime significance since
Hitler has no really effective base
from which to land troops in Syria
now except the Italian island of
Rhodes. And the British are still in
dangerous control of that sector of
the Mediterranean.
HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED
NOTE: Exactly 112 Americans,
mostly missionaries and ambu
lance unit workers, went down on
the Zamzam. The ship was under
non-belligerent registry. There
were about 120 Americans on the
Lusitania, and it was flying the
British flag.
