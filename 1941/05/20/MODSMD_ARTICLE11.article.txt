# FARM'S FIRST DEBATE COACH
## 
### 
Stanford debating as it is today
owes its very existence to the ef
forts made 44 years ago by a man
who, white-haired but still intensely

literary societies in those days, and
fraternity debating teams united to

In 1906. Dr. Duniway, dissatisfied

| debate with California was carried
j on, submitted a plan to the French
committee which sponsored the de
