# FARM'S FIRST DEBATE COACH
## 
### 
Stanford debating as it is today
owes its very existence to the ef
forts made 44 years ago by a man
who, white-haired but still intensely
interested in everything around him,
lives quietly on campus now in a
little house filled with books. That
man is Dr. Clyde A. Duniway, Stan
ford's first debate coach.
Dr. Duniway, fresh from debating
at Harvard, arrived at Stanford as an
assistant professor of history in
1897, "when most boys worked their
way through."' In those days, de
bate activities were centered in the
fraternities.
"Every fraternity had a debating
team," reflects Dr. Duniway. "Houses
considered it a pari of a boy's devel
opment to become adept at express
ing himself clearly."
DUNIWAY ORGANIZES DEBATE
But debating was not organized
' then. Dr. Duniway, drawing from
his experience in forensics as an un
dergraduate, presented a plan for
| debate instruction to "that genial
genius, Dr Jordan," who put com
plete responsibility for such a course
on Dr. Duniway's shoulders.
From this course stemmed Stari
j ford's interest in intercollegiate de
bating. Forensic organizations, called
literary societies in those days, and
fraternity debating teams united to
form teams which competed with
other schools up and down the
West Coast.
NEW INTEREST
Debating, which had been more or
less of an individual affair until
then, student-generated and student -
managed as it was, became a field
of competition which rivalled ath
letic competition so far as student
interest was concerned.
In 1906. Dr. Duniway, dissatisfied
| with the way in which the Carnot
| debate with California was carried
j on, submitted a plan to the French
committee which sponsored the de
bate annually.
"The old Carnot debate was too
much like other debates with Cali

fornia," he declares.
Today, debaters in the Medaille
JofTre debate, successor to the Car
not debate, follow Dr. Duniway's
plan, which is to gather material on
a general subject for two weeks
ahead of time and prepare for the
specific question for only two hours
preceding the event.
LEAVES STANFORD
Dr. Duniway left Stanford in 1908
to become president of the Univer
sity of Montana. Four years ago,
alter serving as educator and ad
ministrator in several western and
middlewestern colleges, he returned
to the Farm to retire to the studies
in which he is most interested.
Tomorrow night, Dr. Duniway will
review the early years of Stanford
debating for 1941 forensicmen who
gather in the Union dining room for
the annual debate banquet.
HASN'T CHANGED
'"Debating at Stanford hasn't
changed much since I left," said Dr.
Duniway. "it still seems to me to
be a revelation of a person's mind
and, most certainly, it develops per
sonality and character in the indi
vidual because it gives him an abil
ity to think clearly, organize his
ideas clearly, and express himself
clearly to others."
"Any person who can exercise the
right of expressing himself outright
should be able to express himself
well, whether he speaks publicly or
not," he stated.
To debaters, Dr. Duniway offers
two words of advice, "Don't memo
rize." That takes the freshness out
of a speech for the listener, the joy
out of speaking for the debater, he
said.

Stanford debating as it is today
owes its very existence to the ef
forts made 44 years ago by a man
who, white-haired but still intensely
interested in everything around him,
lives quietly on campus now in a
little house filled with books. That
man is Dr. Clyde A. Duniway, Stan
ford's first debate coach.
Dr. Duniway, fresh from debating
at Harvard, arrived at Stanford as an
assistant professor of history in
1897, "when most boys worked their
way through."' In those days, de
bate activities were centered in the
fraternities.
"Every fraternity had a debating
team," reflects Dr. Duniway. "Houses
considered it a pari of a boy's devel
opment to become adept at express
ing himself clearly."
DUNIWAY ORGANIZES DEBATE
But debating was not organized
' then. Dr. Duniway, drawing from
his experience in forensics as an un
dergraduate, presented a plan for
| debate instruction to "that genial
genius, Dr Jordan," who put com
plete responsibility for such a course
on Dr. Duniway's shoulders.
From this course stemmed Stari
j ford's interest in intercollegiate de
bating. Forensic organizations, called
literary societies in those days, and
fraternity debating teams united to
form teams which competed with
other schools up and down the
West Coast.
NEW INTEREST
Debating, which had been more or
less of an individual affair until
then, student-generated and student -
managed as it was, became a field
of competition which rivalled ath
letic competition so far as student
interest was concerned.
In 1906. Dr. Duniway, dissatisfied
| with the way in which the Carnot
| debate with California was carried
j on, submitted a plan to the French
committee which sponsored the de
bate annually.
"The old Carnot debate was too
much like other debates with Cali

fornia," he declares.
Today, debaters in the Medaille
JofTre debate, successor to the Car
not debate, follow Dr. Duniway's
plan, which is to gather material on
a general subject for two weeks
ahead of time and prepare for the
specific question for only two hours
preceding the event.
LEAVES STANFORD
Dr. Duniway left Stanford in 1908
to become president of the Univer
sity of Montana. Four years ago,
alter serving as educator and ad
ministrator in several western and
middlewestern colleges, he returned
to the Farm to retire to the studies
in which he is most interested.
Tomorrow night, Dr. Duniway will
review the early years of Stanford
debating for 1941 forensicmen who
gather in the Union dining room for
the annual debate banquet.
HASN'T CHANGED
'"Debating at Stanford hasn't
changed much since I left," said Dr.
Duniway. "it still seems to me to
be a revelation of a person's mind
and, most certainly, it develops per
sonality and character in the indi
vidual because it gives him an abil
ity to think clearly, organize his
ideas clearly, and express himself
clearly to others."
"Any person who can exercise the
right of expressing himself outright
should be able to express himself
well, whether he speaks publicly or
not," he stated.
