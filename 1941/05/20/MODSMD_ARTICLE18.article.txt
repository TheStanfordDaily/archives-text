# Friends Hope German Surface Raider Rescued 142 U.S. Sea Victims
## Meanwhile, Nazi Airplanes Move To Assist Iraq 
### 
Friends of the 142 Americans
known to have been aboard the
Egyptian liner Zamzam, "presumed
lost by enemy action" in the South
Atlantic, clung Monday night to a
thin thread of hope that they had
been captured by a German surface?
raider.
The lust known German naval ac
tion iu the area where the Zamzam
was believed lost—somewhere be
tween Recife (Pernainbuco), Brazil,
and Capetown, South Africa—was,
however, that of a U-boat which
sank the British freighter Ena de
Larrinaga on March 10 about 325
miles northeast of Recife. The Zam
zam, with 323 passengers and crew
aboard, was traveling southeast
when it left Recife a month after the
Ena de Larrinaga sinking.
If a surface raider sank or cap
tured the Zamzam those aboard
might have been saved, as in the ease
of more than 500 persons deposited
on an island of the Bismarck Archi
pelago late in 1940 after a series of
sinkings by German raiders in the
South Pacific.
