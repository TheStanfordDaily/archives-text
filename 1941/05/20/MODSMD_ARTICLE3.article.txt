# Dialect Used In 'Hay Fever'
## 
### 
A hard struggle over broad "a's,"
fallen "r's," and dropped "aitehes" is
being fought by the members of the
cast of "Hay Fever," Noel Coward
comedy which opens tomorrow for a
four-night run in the Little Theater.
"I was first tempted to cut the
dialect ,knowing we would be criti
cized for any imperfections," Charles
Vance, director of the play, con
fessed. ''But it gives the play a bet
ter tone, and also gives the cast a
chance to practice for future ef
forts."
PAIN COACHES
Rodney Pain, English student here,
has been helping the cast 'no end'
in getting off the Mayfair accent
which is Coward's specialty. Another
source of help has been found in
playing the collection of Noel Cow
ard records to be found in the Fel
ton Library.
"The biggest trouble," Mr. Vance
admitted, "is not in getting the cast
to pronounce 'a's' as in 'father,' but
in getting them to pronounce 'a' as
in 'van.' There are no rules for an
English accent, and with the maid
Clara having to talk in Cockney, we
are having a time."
PLAY IS POLISHING
To illustrate his statements fur
ther, Mr. Vance pointed out that the
English pronounce "can" as the
Americans do, but the cast is so
bent on giving out broad "a's" that
it is confusing. However, everything
is shaping up all right.
Aside from certain upsetting
birthday celebrations which made
hash of a rehearsal, the play is pol
ishing up and will open tomorrow
night at 8:15 o'clock. It is a gay
and light comedy, so the audience
should be prepared for laughs. For
tickets, 50 cents, call at the box of
fice, or phone Mr. Barker at P.A.

A hard struggle over broad "a's,"
fallen "r's," and dropped "aitehes" is
being fought by the members of the
cast of "Hay Fever," Noel Coward
comedy which opens tomorrow for a
four-night run in the Little Theater.
"I was first tempted to cut the
dialect ,knowing we would be criti
cized for any imperfections," Charles
Vance, director of the play, con
fessed. ''But it gives the play a bet
ter tone, and also gives the cast a
chance to practice for future ef
forts."
PAIN COACHES
Rodney Pain, English student here,
has been helping the cast 'no end'
in getting off the Mayfair accent
which is Coward's specialty. Another
source of help has been found in
playing the collection of Noel Cow
ard records to be found in the Fel
ton Library.
"The biggest trouble," Mr. Vance
admitted, "is not in getting the cast
to pronounce 'a's' as in 'father,' but
in getting them to pronounce 'a' as
in 'van.' There are no rules for an
English accent, and with the maid
Clara having to talk in Cockney, we
are having a time."
PLAY IS POLISHING
To illustrate his statements fur
ther, Mr. Vance pointed out that the
English pronounce "can" as the
Americans do, but the cast is so
bent on giving out broad "a's" that
it is confusing. However, everything
is shaping up all right.
Aside from certain upsetting
birthday celebrations which made
hash of a rehearsal, the play is pol
ishing up and will open tomorrow
night at 8:15 o'clock. It is a gay
and light comedy, so the audience
should be prepared for laughs. For
tickets, 50 cents, call at the box of
