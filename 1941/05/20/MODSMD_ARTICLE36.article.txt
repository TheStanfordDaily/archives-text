Phil Fox of the Olympic Club, and
a 1(55-foot man, Jack Hughes of
Texas. There will be no shot of jave
lin events but the Farm's seven
jumpers and vaulters are quite
likely to make the trip.
As yet Coach Pitch Johnson does not know who will go to the Los
Angeles Relays next Saturday afternoon since all contestants must he
invited by the meet officials.
Relay teams from Michigan, Texas, Indiana, Drake, California, South
ern California, Pepperdine, and Stanford will be in the college division.

Junior college and high school teams,
will also be entered in the meet that
is supposed to be "the greatest re
lay carnival in the country and the
best track meet since the 1932 Olym
pic Games."
Certain to represent the Farm at
the meet will be the sprint relay
team of sterling Don McFarland, Roy
Bursch, Gene Kern, and probably
John Grant, and the two-mile team
of Burm Skrable, Ernie Clark, Fran
cis Olson, and Blair Hyde.
The latter quartet is out to win its
race with Drake, Indiana, and pos
sibly Michigan and U.S.C. Califor
nia will probably not run in this
since they will be battling with the
Trojans for the mile relay crown.
Although nosed out by Drake in the
Fresno meet, the Indian half-milers
will be even favorites to defeat their
rivals in the second encounter since
little Blair Hyde should beat big
man Lowell Baal without a hinder
ing wind.
Indiana boasting a team composed
of Jenkins, Cochrane, Kendall, and
Kane won the Penn Relays in 7 min.
41.1 sec. These four men scored
over half of the 48 points Indiana
garnered to win the Big Ten cham
pionships over the week-end.
Emerson Hiler will compete in a
discus field including two 170-foot
ers, Archie Harris of Indiana and
Phil Fox of the Olympic Club, and
a 1(55-foot man, Jack Hughes of
Texas. There will be no shot of jave
lin events but the Farm's seven
jumpers and vaulters are quite
likely to make the trip.
