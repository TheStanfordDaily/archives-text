# Delts Swamp Biz School, 23-6
## 
### 
Intramural softball had a big af
ternoon yesterday, five games being
played.
The Delts and the Fijis furnished
most of the fireworks. Both teams
defeated their opponents by large
scores and looked good in perform
ing their respective stints. The Chi
Psis, Sigma Nus, and Theta Chis
also came through with victories.
DELTS WIN
The Delts, chalking up eight runs
in the first and last innings, breezed
through a rather weak Business
School team by a 23-6 score. Byron
Carlson pitched for the winners all
the way, though he weakened
slightly near the game's end.
Bob Morris sparked the Fijis to
an easy 16-1 win over a Firehouse
team that looked unusually seamy
for a Fireboy aggregation. The only
Firehouse run came when Tom Kru
ger hammered out a homer for the
Firemen. The poor fielding of the
Firehouse club was probably the
element to which its defeat could
be attributed, while it was the tight
Fiji defense which really made them
look like champs.
SIGMA NU COMES THROUGH
Encina IE came near upsetting
Sigma Nu yesterday. It was the five
runs due to four frosh errors which
gave Sigma Nu its first inning lead
and the eventual winning margin.
Johnny Brooke starred for the
freshmen, scoring their first run and
twice homering with a man on base
for the rest of Encina's scores. John
Ganahl of Sigma Nu and Bob Son
tag of Encina both hurled pretty
baseball as Sigma Nu finally came
out on the long end of a 9-5 score.
Harry Booth came through again
for Theta Chi, this time pitching
two-run ball, to allow the Theta
Chis an 8-2 victory over the AKL's.
CISI PSIS WIN
The filth contest of the afternoon
saw the Chi Psis whipping Delta
Chi by a 9-2 count. John Jensen
and Bob Brumder hurled for the
victors.
This afternoon the preliminaries to
the intramural swimming meet will
