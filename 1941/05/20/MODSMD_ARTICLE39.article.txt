### CHUCK SMITH 
"BOTCH" CARUSO,
who led Stanford's off and on
baseball team in hitting with a per
centage of around .360, was chosen
captain for the 1942 season last
Friday.
Not particularly unusual but â€”
did you know that three seasons
ago when "Botch" was at U.S.C.
before he transferred to the Farm
he was captain of the Trojan
freshman nine?

TUST a few notes on that slam
bang football scrimmage Coach
Clark Shaughnessy sent the 1941
version of the "Wow Boy" team
through last Saturday afternoon.
With a brisk breeze blowing across
the practice field and rested by hav
ing only a short workout the day
before, the gridders were raring to
go in a scrum.
The result was a fiery scrim
mage with three teams, a blue, a
green, and a red outfit taking
turns on offense and defense. To
me it was a perfect example of
football really being learned.
Sure, there were plenty of mis
takes made, timing was off, and
some of the boys didn't know their
assignments in the various intricate
formations, but now, during spring
practice scrimmage, is the time to
learn them.
Coach Shaughnessy was in rare
form, full of his usual fire and
wisecracks. And when an end
failed to swing far enough down the
field or a halfback let the end come
through when he should have block
ed him, Shaughnessy was sure to
spot the ailment and prescribe the
cure.

scrimmage evi
k denced the shifting of positions
which is so prevalent in the Shaugh
nessy system. For instance, Bob
Ditlevsen was cavorting at halfback
instead of the end spot he held down
last year.
Loren LaPrade, strong arm man
of last year's frosh team's defense
was moved from center to guard
and looked good at stopping the
first string threats down the mid
dle.
Bob Mitchell, last year's fresh
man halfback, though he didn't take
part in Saturday's practice, is an
other example, for Shaughnessy and
his staff of assistants have him
playing quarterback.
I can recall a few more changes
that the Card coaching staff made
last year which worked out pretty
well: for instance, Ed Stamm from
end to tackle, Vic Lindskog from
fullback to center, Chuck Taylor
from quarterback to guard, and Ed
McCain from guard to tackle. How
ever, the latter is back at guard
again, the position he played on the
'39 frosh outfit.

'"pHE third string Green outfit
proved that the Shaughnessy
system is good enough to fool this
fellow even if he was an All-Amer
ican Rose Bowler who has been part
of the system for a year and a half.
For this Green team crossed up
completely two times in a row the
hard-charging Chuck Taylor.
Poor Chuck, yeh, the same
Chuck who with his lightning like
charge singlehanded stopped a
touchdown - hound Washington
team to turn the tide of the In
dian crucial conference game last
season took quite a ribbing from
his teammates on these two plays.

Several long-faced but interested
spectators standing on the sidelines
watching the going-ons last Saturday
were Jimmy Ellis, Bob Koch, and
Matt. Petrlich. Remember, they're
freshmen who used to play football
for Stanford.
