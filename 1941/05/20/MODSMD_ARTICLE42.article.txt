## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
(Ed. note. —This is (he first of a series of articles dealing with the 200
track stars who will be at Stanford June 20-21 for the N.C.A.A. meet.)

Barney Ewell, dusky Penn State sprinter, will have to run near-record
time to keep his N.C.A.A. 100 and 220 crowns in the coming collegiate track
and field championships.
Three flying Texans, two gentlemen from the Deep South and a skinny

j Canadian are the leading contenders,
for these titles. However, at least a
dozen more dashmen around the
j country stand a good chance of
placing high.
Carleton Terry, newest whirl
wind from Texas U., has marks of
; 9.2 and 9.4 in the century made with
assisting breezes and a legitimate
! time of 9.5 seconds. Teammate
| Freddie Ramsdell has run 9.6 and
| 21.2 to make him a probable point
winner in both sprints.
Best times recorded for the fur
i long were both aided by the wind,
which seems to hinder a great many
• track meets this spring. Joe Blagg,
Rice senior, took a mere 20.4 sec
! onds to run the distance in a trian
-1 gular meet among Southwest Con
ference teams. Billy Brown, leading
I broad jumper in the country from
L.S.U., ran 20.6 as well as 9.4 with
I a tail wind.
Pat Haley from Washington tSate
i in his first year of varsity compe
tition has run 9.6 and 21 flat. He
I also runs an excellent flight of low
hurdles. He ran 9.5 as a Cougar
i freshman last year. He has been
beaten this year in the longer race
by Kjcll Qvale, Norwegian tongue
twister from the University of Wash
ington.
Ewell is gradually rounding into
shape and will undoubtedly be in
good condition in time to defend his
titles. Another negro, Leo Tarant of
Alabama State, placed in both events
last year and has a mark of 9.5 in
| the 100.
Myron Piker, winner of both Big
| Ten sprints from Northwestern, is
the only outstanding dashman in the
, Middle West. George Franck, Min
nesota Ail-American halfback, will
j be a dangerous threat if he recovers
from a muscle injury acquired in the
! Drake Relays.
Other possibilities arc Boswell of
Alabama. Storer of Duke, Walker of
Boston College, Leicht of Oregon,
Sinclair of U.CL.A., Carter and
tSickel of Pitt, and Kerns fo South
| ern California if he runs.
