PULLMAN. Wash., May 19 (UP).
—Washington State College's well
balanced squad today captured its
ninth consecutive Northern Division,
Pacific Coast Conference, track and
field title, scoring 48 2-5 points in
the division championships on Rogers
Field.
University of Washington finished
second, with 33 1-5 points, followed
by University of Idaho, 30 2-5; Uni
versity of Oregon, 2G 1-10; Oregon
State College, 16 2-5; and Montana
State University, 10'/2.
Les Steers, Oregon's talented high
jumper and holder of the unofficial
world's record in his specialty, set
a new meet record of 6 feet 8 13-16
inches. He cleared the height with
ease but was prevented by a knee
injury from any attempts to beat his
best mark of 6 feet 10 25-32 inches.
Steers and Pat Haley, lanky W.S.C.
sophomore, were the meet's indi
vidual stars. In addition to the high
jump, Steers surprised the experts
with a first in the javelin with a
throw of 205 feet 2 7 8 inches. Haley
took three first places—the 100- and
220-yard dashes and the 220-yard
low hurdles.
Performances were only fair. The
meet, scheduled for Saturday, was
put over two days when rain made
the field unfit for use.
Surprise of the meet was Idaho's
showing. The Vandals took three
firsts, although Phil Leibowitz, one
of the West's ranking distance men,
contented himself with but one first,
in the mile.
