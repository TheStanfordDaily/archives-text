# Footballers Run Through Hot Workout
## 
### 
Stanford's spring gridders poured
out another scrimmage yesterday
under a blazing sun, smoothing their
offensive maneuverings for Satur
day's Buck of the Month Club pre
view in the stadium.
At 2 o'clock Saturday club mem
bers and the general public have
been invited to watch the '41 edi
tion of the Redskin varsity go
through its stuff on the big field.
Body contact was at a minimum
yesterday, only the last 20 minutes
going t.o actual scrimmage. For the
first hour Coach Clark Shaughnessy
worked his Reds, Blues, and Greens
on polishing up their plays on a
dummy scrimmage
ALBERT HITS MARK
Ail-American Quarterback Frankie
Albert lined up his sights and fired
beautiful passes straight to the mark.
Ray Hammett, Blue signal caller,
also found his throwing eye for some
nifty tosses.
First-string right end Freddy
Meyer was back in suit. He com
plained of a sore leg Saturday but
the hoof didn't bother him yester
day.
On the receiving end of Hammett's
aerials was Jack Barkley. The Blue
halfback gathered in the last of
Duke's heaves over the defensive
left half and broke clear.
NORBERG RETURNS
Big Hank Norberg was back after
a case of measles kept him out for
about ten 'days. The hefty left end
alternated with Bob Mastin at for
the Blues. Arny Meiners worked
right end for the Reds and Bill Bru
baker, up from Harry Shipkey's
frosh squad, handled the Blue right
end spot.
Pete Kmetovic resumed his ram
blings at left half for the Reds after
Saturday's absence. The fleet-footed
sensation of the Nebraska-Indian
Rose Bowl encounter cavorted his
flanker assignments with ease and
seems to get faster every practice.
Halfback Billy Ravetto is fast
overcoming his early season nerv
ousness, 1 winding up in the second
string Blues backfield. Brubaker
loped through the defensive sec
ondary to gather in a couple of
Hammett's lofty heaves, as did right
half Buck Fawcett.
DRILLS NEAR END
Practice season is rapidly drawing
to a too-quick close with some six
or seven drills remaining for the
Shaughnee warriors out of a total of
30 allowed by the rulings.
Much too early for predictions or
prognostications as to the Cards'
conference chances this year, scrim
mages show a spirited, hustling
bunch. The boys seem to revel in
the warm weather of the past few
sessions, more of which is on hand
for future drills.
Saturday's program will be out
lined by Shaughnessy in a few days.
Most of the afternoon's time will go
to running through dummy scrim
mage and a final hour's worth of
hard scrimmaging.

On the receiving end of Hammett's
aerials was Jack Barkley. The Blue
halfback gathered in the last of
Duke's heaves over the defensive
left half and broke clear.
NORBERG RETURNS
Big Hank Norberg was back after
a case of measles kept him out for
about ten 'days. The hefty left end
alternated with Bob Mastin at for
the Blues. Arny Meiners worked
right end for the Reds and Bill Bru
baker, up from Harry Shipkey's
frosh squad, handled the Blue right
end spot.
Pete Kmetovic resumed his ram
blings at left half for the Reds after
Saturday's absence. The fleet-footed
sensation of the Nebraska-Indian
Rose Bowl encounter cavorted his
flanker assignments with ease and
seems to get faster every practice.
Halfback Billy Ravetto is fast
overcoming his early season nerv
ousness, 1 winding up in the second
string Blues backfield. Brubaker
loped through the defensive sec
ondary to gather in a couple of
Hammett's lofty heaves, as did right
half Buck Fawcett.
DRILLS NEAR END
Practice season is rapidly drawing
to a too-quick close with some six
or seven drills remaining for the
Shaughnee warriors out of a total of
30 allowed by the rulings.
Much too early for predictions or
prognostications as to the Cards'
conference chances this year, scrim
mages show a spirited, hustling
bunch. The boys seem to revel in
the warm weather of the past few
sessions, more of which is on hand
for future drills.
Saturday's program will be out
lined by Shaughnessy in a few days.
Most of the afternoon's time will go
to running through dummy scrim
mage and a final hour's worth of
hard scrimmaging.
Stanford's spring gridders poured
out another scrimmage yesterday
under a blazing sun, smoothing their
offensive maneuverings for Satur
day's Buck of the Month Club pre
view in the stadium.
At 2 o'clock Saturday club mem
bers and the general public have
been invited to watch the '41 edi
tion of the Redskin varsity go
through its stuff on the big field.
Body contact was at a minimum
yesterday, only the last 20 minutes
going t.o actual scrimmage. For the
first hour Coach Clark Shaughnessy
worked his Reds, Blues, and Greens
on polishing up their plays on a
dummy scrimmage
ALBERT HITS MARK
Ail-American Quarterback Frankie
Albert lined up his sights and fired
beautiful passes straight to the mark.
Ray Hammett, Blue signal caller,
also found his throwing eye for some
nifty tosses.
First-string right end Freddy
Meyer was back in suit. He com
plained of a sore leg Saturday but
the hoof didn't bother him yester
day.
On the receiving end of Hammett's
aerials was Jack Barkley. The Blue
halfback gathered in the last of
