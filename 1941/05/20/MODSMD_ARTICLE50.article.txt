# Water Poloists To Hold Meet

### 
The 1941 water polo practice ses
sion will be brought to a close to
morrow afternoon when next year's
varsity team meets the alumni team
at 4:!J0 in Encina Pools. Admission
is free and men only may attend.
The first four weeks of this quar
ter the team practiced on funda
mentals; the first scrimmages were
held three weeks ago. According to
Coach Nort Thornton, the team
looks good and this game should be
a fair test of their ability. The team
will probably be the heaviest scor
ing team that Stanford has had in
the past few years.

graduating this year. Among (heir
numbers will be Bill Weeden, Bob
Plate, Dave Nottage, Bob Jamieson,
Bob Tietjen. and Jack Vibert, for
wards; Harvey Rothschild, Ted Ma
rino, Bruce Jessup, Jim Mac Donald,
and Jim Abrahamson, guards, and
Roy Vitousek, goal.
Starling for the new varsity is Bill
Maple, a transfer from U.C.L.A.
Maple, Freddy Manwaring and Had
ley Bacon will be the varsity for
wards, Bob Hind, sensational swim
mer from the frosh, Captain Frank
Mitchell (all-Conference), and Bob
Jones will be the backs. The goalie
will be any one of four men: Bob
Breckner, veteran of past teams;

versity of San Francisco; Ed Smith
