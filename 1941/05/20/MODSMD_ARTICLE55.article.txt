DURING the war of 1914—' 18 the British press
demonstrated one of the most remarkable
reversals of editorial form that has ever been
seen in the entire history of journalism.
The English liberal press of that era, during
ose dragging-out, tense weeks before Britain's
'ranee into the war, had been carrying on a
termined fight against English participation,
ntensely backing the course set by their party
ders in the House of Commons, these news
>ers day after day, in editorial leader after
ditorial leader, stoutly maintained that Britain's
place in the European scheme of things was one
of assistance with France and Germany in work
ing out a cool settlement of the Austro-Russian
differences.
Things happened too rapidly during those
frantic last days in 1914 for the press to keep up
with government action. And so on the very day
that the invasion of Belgium pushed England
over the brink and into war the liberal press
found themselves still blowing the clarion of
peace.
A nation at peace and that nation at war are
vastly different things. And so the liberal press
found themselves with the problem of coincid
ing a genuine desire to present a united war
front with their former editorial policies.
Their solution was the creation of a "holy
war"—the G. B. Shaw-led theory that England
was fighting a war to save Europe and democ
racy.
Today's American press is faced with the
same problem in the defection of Vichy France
from the Allied cause. And the editors and col
umnists who have been lauding La Belle France
for her courage in the face of disaster, and Mar
shal Petain for his unbelievable strength of
character, are faced with the problem of how
best to eat their words now.
When the country which has been selected
and pointed out as one of the principal examples
of why democracy must be saved turns and
repudiates the tenets of that political belief,
a change of face on the part of the democratic
press is a necessity—regardless of the reasons
for that country's defection.
The question now is exactly what course our
writers will take in coinciding their former tone
of voice with the invective which France now
has apparently earned.
It will be interesting to watch.

umnists who have been lauding La Belle France
for her courage in the face of disaster, and Mar
shal Petain for his unbelievable strength of
character, are faced with the problem of how
best to eat their words now.
When the country which has been selected
and pointed out as one of the principal examples
of why democracy must be saved turns and
repudiates the tenets of that political belief,
a change of face on the part of the democratic
press is a necessity—regardless of the reasons
for that country's defection.
The question now is exactly what course our
writers will take in coinciding their former tone
of voice with the invective which France now
has apparently earned.
It will be interesting to watch.
DURING the war of 1914—' 18 the British press
demonstrated one of the most remarkable
reversals of editorial form that has ever been
seen in the entire history of journalism.
The English liberal press of that era, during
ose dragging-out, tense weeks before Britain's
'ranee into the war, had been carrying on a
termined fight against English participation,
ntensely backing the course set by their party
ders in the House of Commons, these news
>ers day after day, in editorial leader after
ditorial leader, stoutly maintained that Britain's
place in the European scheme of things was one
of assistance with France and Germany in work
ing out a cool settlement of the Austro-Russian
differences.
Things happened too rapidly during those
frantic last days in 1914 for the press to keep up
with government action. And so on the very day
that the invasion of Belgium pushed England
over the brink and into war the liberal press
found themselves still blowing the clarion of
peace.
A nation at peace and that nation at war are
vastly different things. And so the liberal press
found themselves with the problem of coincid
ing a genuine desire to present a united war
front with their former editorial policies.
Their solution was the creation of a "holy
war"—the G. B. Shaw-led theory that England
was fighting a war to save Europe and democ
racy.
Today's American press is faced with the
same problem in the defection of Vichy France
from the Allied cause. And the editors and col
umnists who have been lauding La Belle France
for her courage in the face of disaster, and Mar
shal Petain for his unbelievable strength of
character, are faced with the problem of how
