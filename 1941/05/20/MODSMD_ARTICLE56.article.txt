TWO sours often produce a sweet. Two bads
often produce a good.
It's that way with salt, composed of two ele
ments, chlorine and sodium, which if taken
separately would probably prove fatal. But
combined, this same sodium and chlorine pro
duce a substance essential to life itself.
And, until recently, it has been that way with
the American Society of Composers, Authors,
and" Publishers—better known as ASCAP. The
sodium was ASCAP's song writers who con
trolled our musical world; the chlorine was
ASCAP itself, an organization which was em
bracing to death our American music. Com
bined, these two poisons produced the music
which has thrilled you and those before you.
Stuff like "Old Man River" and "Rio Rita," and
even "Take Me Out to the Ball Game."

ASCAP was the salt of music, but hardly the
salt of the earth. What they were doing was
appreciated, but the way in which they were
doing it was poisonous.
Realizing this poisonous effect, the broadcast
ing companies, which control the spigot of
ASCAP's barrel of music, set about, not to find
an antidote, but to compound an ersatz, a chemi
cal substitute which would prove just as suffi
cient. Gone was "Old Man River." In its place
was "The Wise Old Owl in the Oak Tree."
It was salt all right, but not as good salt.
The broadcasting companies won their fight.
The best toothpaste company in the world
would soon go out of business if it didn't put
a nozzle opening on the tube so you could get
the paste out. ASCAP was forced, happy to say,
to give in.
Last Sunday, the nation was treated to an
ASCAP program called "A Salute to Mutual."
And with that program, back to the air ways
came the tunes of yesterday. One person listen
ing to that program said: "I'd almost forgotten
what those pieces sounded like. Isn't it swell
to hear them again?"
And so it is. Thank somebody, the fight was
partially settled.
An ersatz is always an ersatz. But there is
nothing so satisfying as the real salt.—B. A.
