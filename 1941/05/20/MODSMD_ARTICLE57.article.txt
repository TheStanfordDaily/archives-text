# BULL SESSION
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
A MISTAKEN opinion has been circulating about the
campus ever since Bull Session was taken over
a day or so by former writers of the column. "Mayer
is lazy?" say many. "Mayer realizes that he can't
compare with the standards laid down by his prede
cessors so he snivels off and refuses to take his proper
beating," say others.
Nothing is further from the truth. Why, just the
other day Mellinkoff said to me:
"Jeffrey, I wouldn't write under your by-line for
any amount of money."
That pi'oves it Mellinkoff obviously knew that he
couldn't fill my shoes.
Next I contacted Ames. "Hey, Ames," I said in my
most dignified manner, "how do you feel about my
writing your old column?"
Ames stood off (about 200 yards) and studied me.
He looked me up and down. A sneer gathered at the
corners of his mouth.
"Brother," he snarled (he's a great kidder; we're
really not related at all), "the best thing that ever
happened to me was your taking over that column."
Ames is a pretty smart guy. He knew that the
columns I write are incomparable. He realizes how
fortunate he is to have as a successor a man who
wites the way I do.
"Having you write that column really made me
popular," he explained, meaning, of course, that being
classified as a Bull Sessioner has taken on a new mean
ing since I started writing (no, I didn't say clipping)
the column.

"LTUTCHINSON, who wrote this column for a short
time, was very obdurate.
"Mayer," he said. He was probably addressing me.
"Who me?" I parried.
"Mayer," he reiterated. "That column you write is
the worst thing I've ever seen. There probably have
been worse Bull Sessioners than you. But they would
be difficult to prove. You have absolutely no com
mand whatsoever of the English language. The lino
type operator wrote a much better column for you
than you ever have yourself. You just don't seem to
have the intelligence to handle the assignment of Bull
Session.
"Listen, Hutchinson," I said in a voice like cold
steel. My eyes were like hot coals glowing on a wintry
evening. The panther-like muscles in my arms rip
pled with surging power. "No matter what you say
about my column, you can't make me angry enough
to forget those five stones you owe me." Hutchinson,
who is just a little guy and of course is afraid of any
one half his size, just broke down and cried.
So, you see, Stanford is very fortunate to have a
Bull Sessioner like me. Just the other day Editor Can
non, with tears streaming down his cheeks, said:
"Mayer, I wonder what we'd do without you."
The answer is obvious. Circulation has jumped 1500
since I started writing the column. I'm selling the extra
copies to the Orient for pulp.
