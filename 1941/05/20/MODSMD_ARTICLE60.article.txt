# 'Sister Eileen' Given Tonight
## Farrington Appears On Tuesday Series 
### 
A thousand laughs and a chance
to hear the story that is taking
Broadway — that's the opportunity
the Tuesday Series followers have
tonight when they hear the dramatic
reading, "My Sister Eileen," given
by Mrs. Guy Stevens Farrington at
7:30 o'clock in the auditorium of the
Memorial Hall.
Called by critics the funniest play
of the current season, "My Sister
Eileen" was dramatized from the
sketches originally published by
Ruth McKenney in the New Yorker.
The play concerns Ruth McKen
ney and her sister Eileen's experi
ences as girls arriving in New York
from Columbus, Ohio, Eileen trying
to crash the stage and Ruth trying
her hand as a writer. The play is
filled with hilarity that has kept New
Yorkers holding their sides for
weeks.
Besides the amusing situations
centered around these two young
innocents from Columbus, who rent
a studio in Greenwich Village, an
element of truth is honey-combed
throughout, making this more than
just a play of a thousand funny lines.
According to reviews, the charac
ters are all well drawn.
Burns Mantle, foremost contempo
rary literary critic, has said of this
play, "An evening of good, clean fun
and laughter—people's choice among
the newer comedies."
