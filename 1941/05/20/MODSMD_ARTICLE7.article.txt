# Mexican Zitzats Invade Lagunita
## 
### 
Lagunita swings into the final
month of its Spring Quarter season
with the water still in swimmable
condition in spite of the grass that
is appearing. A little Mexican ZIT
ZAT has shown up and is begin
ning to turn the water green.
Promptly at 7 a.m. every day the
"Open-Air Outing and Happy-Day
Club" shows up for a morning dip,
but outside of its restricted member
ship there is little or no out-of-hours
swimming.
The past week-end was a busy
one. According to one of the boat
house custodians, "Eveiyhody that
didn't go to the beach came up
here."
