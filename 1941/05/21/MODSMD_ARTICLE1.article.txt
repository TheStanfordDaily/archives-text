r |' , HE Nazi invasion of Crete is pre
sumed to have three purposes:
First, a dress rehearsal for the in
vasion of the British Isles; second,
a desperate attempt to smash the
island fortress barring the Nazi
route to Syria; and third, a possible
"feint" preceding a full force attack
on England.
The second purpose is the most
logical and also has the most imme
diate significance. Germany must
either clear Crete or get permission
to transport troops across Turkey in
order to get a sizable force into
Syria. It is from this country that
her attack on Suez through the Le
vant must come.
However, the first suggestion is
the most frightening. In one at
tack the Germans landed some
10,000 to 12,000 men—a full divi
sion. Crete is just about 140 miles
long, and yet Churchill admits that
the British troops had trouble with
(hem, and that there arc still some
of them running around loose on
the island. Suppose 20 divisions
parachuted down or landed gliders
in England, and they, like part of
the men who landed on Crete,
were in British uniform.
W;iy back in February Bull Ses
sioner Bud Ames wrote a column
entitled "Silent Wings of Invasion,"
in which he said:
"On the warm currents riding
over England's shores, thousands of
gliders, carrying a man and a ma
chine gun, or small bombs or radio
equipment, could soar silently over
the British cities. There would be
no air warning. Nothing but silence.
And then, at the appointed minute,
down they would come, thousands
of them."
* * *
weeks afterward, people
would look at Mr. Ames and
laugh. "Thousands and thousands of
gliders," they would say skeptically,
and again laugh uproariously.
In February the war was more
or less hogged down in the win
ter stalemate, and people were be
ginning to feel less for Britain's
safety. But now the legions of \'ie
Reich have again and even more
convincingly proved both their in
genuity and apparent invincibil
ity.
And Ames' thousands and thou
sands of gliders are no laughing
matter.
Nor is the predicament of the na
tion subjected to such an invasion
particularly amusing. The picture of
a terrified people regarding every
soldier they meet with suspicion, in
quiring nervously if he speaks Eng
lish—if he says "nein" I suppose
they shoot him, unless he shoots
first —is not a pleasant one. The
chaos and vicious blow at national
morale would be well nigh impos
sible to overcome.

r | , HE Vichy-Syrian crisis is now at
the point where you can expect
a brand new war to break out any
minute. In Vichy the "high authori
ties" said the French air force might
begin "reprisal" attacks on British
naval bases and Palestine if the
R.A.F. persisted in bombing Syrian
airdromes and the British kept up
their attempts to incite revolt in
French possessions. Already the
whole of the French army in Syria
is lined up on the Palestine border.
All British consular officials in
Syria have been ordered to get
out within eight days, and Britain
has asked the French consul gen
eral to leave London. Marshall
Petain has rushed Jean Bergerct,
the French air minister, to Beirut
by plane.
The Iraq war seems to have taken
a turn for the British in spite of the
strong German aid coming in from
Syria. It is unlikely that the Eng
lish are going to quit attacking Syr
ian airdromes. They must wind up
the Iraq war fast, and the less
Germans there are in Iraq, the faster
they can do it.
Over in Ethiopia the Duke of Aosta
formally surrendered, and already
the troops which were engaged in
action around his garrison are on
their way up to Egypt and Palestine.
The Duke announced his intention
to surrender yesterday—the day that
his brother was formally crowned
king of the new Croat puppet state.

r |' , HE Nazi invasion of Crete is pre
sumed to have three purposes:
First, a dress rehearsal for the in
vasion of the British Isles; second,
a desperate attempt to smash the
island fortress barring the Nazi
route to Syria; and third, a possible
"feint" preceding a full force attack
on England.
The second purpose is the most
logical and also has the most imme
diate significance. Germany must
either clear Crete or get permission
to transport troops across Turkey in
order to get a sizable force into
Syria. It is from this country that
her attack on Suez through the Le
vant must come.
However, the first suggestion is
the most frightening. In one at
tack the Germans landed some
10,000 to 12,000 men—a full divi
sion. Crete is just about 140 miles
long, and yet Churchill admits that
the British troops had trouble with
(hem, and that there arc still some
of them running around loose on
the island. Suppose 20 divisions
parachuted down or landed gliders
in England, and they, like part of
the men who landed on Crete,
were in British uniform.
W;iy back in February Bull Ses
sioner Bud Ames wrote a column

in which he said:
"On the warm currents riding
over England's shores, thousands of
gliders, carrying a man and a ma
chine gun, or small bombs or radio
equipment, could soar silently over
the British cities. There would be
no air warning. Nothing but silence.
And then, at the appointed minute,
down they would come, thousands
of them."
* * *

would look at Mr. Ames and
laugh. "Thousands and thousands of
gliders," they would say skeptically,
and again laugh uproariously.
In February the war was more
or less hogged down in the win
ter stalemate, and people were be
ginning to feel less for Britain's
safety. But now the legions of \'ie
Reich have again and even more
convincingly proved both their in
genuity and apparent invincibil
ity.
And Ames' thousands and thou
sands of gliders are no laughing
matter.
Nor is the predicament of the na

particularly amusing. The picture of
a terrified people regarding every
soldier they meet with suspicion, in
quiring nervously if he speaks Eng

they shoot him, unless he shoots
first —is not a pleasant one. The

r | , HE Vichy-Syrian crisis is now at
the point where you can expect
a brand new war to break out any
minute. In Vichy the "high authori
ties" said the French air force might
begin "reprisal" attacks on British
naval bases and Palestine if the
R.A.F. persisted in bombing Syrian
airdromes and the British kept up
their attempts to incite revolt in
French possessions. Already the
whole of the French army in Syria
is lined up on the Palestine border.
All British consular officials in
Syria have been ordered to get
out within eight days, and Britain
has asked the French consul gen
eral to leave London. Marshall
Petain has rushed Jean Bergerct,
the French air minister, to Beirut
by plane.
The Iraq war seems to have taken
a turn for the British in spite of the
strong German aid coming in from
Syria. It is unlikely that the Eng
lish are going to quit attacking Syr
ian airdromes. They must wind up
the Iraq war fast, and the less
Germans there are in Iraq, the faster
they can do it.
Over in Ethiopia the Duke of Aosta
formally surrendered, and already
the troops which were engaged in
action around his garrison are on
their way up to Egypt and Palestine.
The Duke announced his intention
to surrender yesterday—the day that
his brother was formally crowned
king of the new Croat puppet state.

r |' , HE Nazi invasion of Crete is pre
sumed to have three purposes:
First, a dress rehearsal for the in
vasion of the British Isles; second,
a desperate attempt to smash the
island fortress barring the Nazi
route to Syria; and third, a possible
"feint" preceding a full force attack
on England.
The second purpose is the most
logical and also has the most imme
diate significance. Germany must
either clear Crete or get permission
to transport troops across Turkey in
order to get a sizable force into
Syria. It is from this country that
her attack on Suez through the Le
vant must come.
However, the first suggestion is
the most frightening. In one at
tack the Germans landed some
10,000 to 12,000 men—a full divi
sion. Crete is just about 140 miles
long, and yet Churchill admits that
the British troops had trouble with
(hem, and that there arc still some
of them running around loose on
the island. Suppose 20 divisions
parachuted down or landed gliders
in England, and they, like part of
the men who landed on Crete,
were in British uniform.
W;iy back in February Bull Ses
sioner Bud Ames wrote a column
entitled "Silent Wings of Invasion,"
in which he said:
"On the warm currents riding
over England's shores, thousands of
gliders, carrying a man and a ma
chine gun, or small bombs or radio
equipment, could soar silently over
the British cities. There would be
no air warning. Nothing but silence.
And then, at the appointed minute,
down they would come, thousands
of them."
* * *
weeks afterward, people
would look at Mr. Ames and
laugh. "Thousands and thousands of
gliders," they would say skeptically,
and again laugh uproariously.
In February the war was more
or less hogged down in the win
ter stalemate, and people were be
ginning to feel less for Britain's
safety. But now the legions of \'ie
Reich have again and even more
convincingly proved both their in
genuity and apparent invincibil
ity.
And Ames' thousands and thou
sands of gliders are no laughing
matter.
Nor is the predicament of the na
tion subjected to such an invasion
particularly amusing. The picture of
a terrified people regarding every
soldier they meet with suspicion, in
quiring nervously if he speaks Eng
lish—if he says "nein" I suppose
they shoot him, unless he shoots
first —is not a pleasant one. The
chaos and vicious blow at national
morale would be well nigh impos
sible to overcome.
