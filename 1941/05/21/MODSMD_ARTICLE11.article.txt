### 
Wei It Smith, junior student from
Utica, N.Y., has been appointed
chairman of Men's Vocational Com
mittee for the school year 1941-42, it
was announced yesterday. He will
succeed Frank Mallory.
The announcement was made at
the final Vocom meeting of the year,
at which Mallory read his report on
the year's work which was later
submitted last night to Ex Commit
tee, and work was begun on the
program for next year.
The meeting marked the end of a
full year's work by the Vocom in
which it sponsored a Vocational
Lecture Series, a Vocational Test
Drive, and a program of Vocational
interviews during Spring Quarter in
which personal contact between stu
dents and prominent San Francisco
business and professional executives
was provided.
PROGRAMS SUCCESS
According to Mai lory's report,
each of these programs met with
decided success. In Autumn Quar
ter the work of the committee re
sulted in almost 250 students being
tested through the Strong Voca
tional Interest Blank. An average
audience of more than 200 students
attended the Winter Quarter talks,
and 110 students took advantage of
the Spring Quarter Interview Series.
Most of the $75 which was pro
vided the committee by Ex Commit
tee at the beginning of the year was
spent for vocational books, pam
phlets, and other literary material,
according to the report. This mate
rial has been placed on the voca
tional shelf in the Dean of Men's
office and on the vocational shelf in
the reference rom of the main
library.
DRIVE PLANNED
Members of the committee are now
working on plans for a Strong Test
Drive during next September's Pie-
Registration period.
Members of the Vocom this year
were: Chairman Frank Mallory, Walt
Smith, Laurence Grannis, Bob Ham
melt, Bob Mitchell, George Tolman,
Doug Mac Donald, and Vic Minahan.
