# Excom Mulls Caucuses, Primaries
## Investigations On Dormant Institutions Launched by Group 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Ex Committee .swept the cobwebs
out of an admittedly unsatisfactory
election system last night when it
discussed possibilities of dumping
caucuses and replacing them with a
primary system.
The committee went a step far
ther and also launched an investi
gation into Axe Society and "other
organizations" considered dormant
during the past academic year.
Following a verbal report on the
present election system by Wilson
Cannon, Daily editor, it v/as agreed
a set-up with free nominations fol
lowed immediately by a primary
election would eliminate the un
desirable caucus method and de
emphasize the Hall-Row split felt
to be predominant only at election
times and particularly during spring
elections.
"No matter whom Iho house
spokesman says he'll support—that
won't amount to a hill of beans
when it comes to the primary elec
tion," Cannon oeciared. No action
was taken on the discussion, and
Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president,
and Ned Pugh, Cardinals chairman
and ex-officio Excom member, will
investigate further and report at next
Tuesday's meeting.
Frank Van Acker, graduate man,
was appointed to examine inactive
organizations in general and Axe So
ciety in particular. Student-Faculty
Field Day, traditionally promoted by
Axe Society, was canceled last night
for this year because no steps to
ward the program have been taken.
Other business follows.
CARD FILE SUBSTITUTE: A sub
committee of Ex Committee, com
posed of one Excom member and a
representative from each class, will
review appointments to all com
mittees next year. These commit
tees must be approved by Ex Com
mittee. This system, proposed by
Ros« Anderson, mfcmber-at-large,
replaces Activity Card Files, junked
last week.
MEN'S VOCOM: Walt Smith, Al
pha Delt junior, was appointed Men's
Vocational Committee chairman for
next year, upon the recommendation
of Frank Mai lory, retiring chairman,
who reported a spring quarter con
cert by the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra in Frost Memorial Amphi
theater will probably be held May
31, 1942, if the A.S.S.U. is willing
to underwrite it for $3,500. Com
mittee was enthusiastically in favor
of the plan, largely due to the work
of Dick Lyon, Zcte graduate student
and organizer of the current year's
University "Pop" Concert in the
city, according to Mallory. A sound
shell, similar to that in Hollywood
Bowl, may be constructed by the
Administration for the Amphithea
ter.
SUNDAY MOVIES: Anne Town
send, A.S.S.U. vice-president and
she of the Clutching Hand and
Clancy serials, reported a $92 profit
from this quarter's Sunday night
movies. She was tendered a vote of
thanks for her work.
CONSTITUTION: Muriel Boggs,
senior woman, reported on all con
stitutional changes of the year, and
received a vote of thanks for her
"work and perseverance."
WAR SYMPOSIUM: Paul "Red"
Fay was given a vote of thanks for
his work on Monday night's War
Symposium, when Committee agreed
with Jessup that he "did a tremen
dous piece of work."
FROSII TRACK: Awards were
granted Kenny Taix and Howard
Wright, who were injured during
the season and who the B.A.C. felt
would haVe won their numerals if
ihey had not suffered injury.
VARSITY BASEBALL: Bill Mas
ters and Chuck Vore were granted
their awards by a telephone vote of
hxcom last week. Theirs had been
postponed due to a technicality.

Ex Committee .swept the cobwebs
out of an admittedly unsatisfactory
election system last night when it
discussed possibilities of dumping
caucuses and replacing them with a
primary system.
The committee went a step far
ther and also launched an investi
gation into Axe Society and "other
organizations" considered dormant
during the past academic year.
Following a verbal report on the
present election system by Wilson
Cannon, Daily editor, it v/as agreed
a set-up with free nominations fol
lowed immediately by a primary
election would eliminate the un
desirable caucus method and de
emphasize the Hall-Row split felt
to be predominant only at election
times and particularly during spring
elections.
"No matter whom Iho house
spokesman says he'll support—that
won't amount to a hill of beans
when it comes to the primary elec

was taken on the discussion, and
Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president,
