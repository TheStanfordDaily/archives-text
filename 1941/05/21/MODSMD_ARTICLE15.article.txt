A vivid picture of the season's
funniest play was given to the Tues
day Series audience last night when
Mrs. Guy Stevens Farrington read
"My Sister Eileen."
The play by Ruth McKenney was
taken from a book by her which was
in turn taken from a series of clever
articles first appearing in the New
Yorker telling of Miss McKinney's
life in New York with her sister
Eileen.
The Stanford audience's approval
of Mrs. Farrington's reading of the
play was in all ways equal to the
plaudits the critics gave the Broad
way production.
Mrs. Farrington very adequately
presented the 20 or 30 characters that
drifted in and out of the Greenwich
Village studio, as it was laughingly
called. Her interpretation of the
thick Greek dialect of the landlord
was interesting, to say the least.
Miss McKenncy's lines, particu
larly those said by her counterpart,
Ruth Sherman, were very witty
throughout the play. The ticklish
situation of having numerous men
popping out of recesses of the studio
while other men were there was
handled with the utmost humor.
