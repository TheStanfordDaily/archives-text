# Freshman Falls From 4th Floor Encina Window
## Diebenkorn Tumbles 45 Feet, Suffers No Serious Injuries 
### 
Dick Diebenkorn, freshman Dekc
pledge from San Francisco, yester
day morning about 2 o'clock fell
from the window of his fourth floor
Encina room suffering a broken nose,
chipped tooth, cut lip, and abrasions.
Dr. O. N. Anderson stated last
night after X-rays and a complete
examination, that he apparently suf
fered no internal injuries, but will
have to remain in the hospital for
several days under observation.
Diebenkorn h'ad been troubled with
a severe case of hay fever and in a
semi-conscious state, went to the
window for more air. No one saw
him fall but his roommates woke
up and heard the groans from the
ground.
Though he remained unconscious
for some time after arriving at the
hospital, Dr. Anderson stated that
he seemingly had no head injuries
apparent.
RELAXED FALL
Because of his probable semi
conscious condition, he was relaxed
enough so that his fall into the
bushes was not fatal. The bottoms of
his feet were cut and small bits of
gravel were ground in indicating
that he probably landed flat on his
feet and then fell forward on his
face. The fall did not even tear his
pajamas.
Distance from the ground to the
fourth floor window sill is approxi
mately 45 feet.
