# Frosh Cleanup Group Named
## 
### 
One very important item was
found to be lacking in yesterday's
meeting of committee heads for Sat
urday's freshman Last Roundup on
Lake Lagunita.
Quantities of food have been or
dered, a full program of races have
been scheduled, and all committees
named except one â€”cleanup.
Chairman Ted Eberle briefly
scanned the suddenly deserted
Roble lobby until his eye lighted
upon his publicity committee. "This
picnic is too easy to publicize," said
Eberle. "The publicity committee
can clean up, too."
With this settled, program co
chairmen Bruce Lyon and Pat
Chubbuck announced that there will
be boys' and girls' canoe races (four
to a canoe), girls' and boys' swim
ming races, and canoe tilting con
tests. Dancing on the upper deck of
the Boathouse and general tomfool
ery in one of the 70 canoes reserved
for freshmen will fill up any possible
lulls in the program.
The new publicity and cleanup
committee members:
Anne Alton and Ferris Boothc,
co-chairmen; Bill Coughlin, Judy
O'Connor, Carol Davis, Barbara
Stevens, Alicia Walker, Joan Feld
man, Jane Ellis, Ann Simons, Daisy
Day, Rosalie Carpenter, Bill Steif,
Maxwell Myers, Charles Pearce,
Norm Wintemute, Bill Reich, and
Ross Hughes.
