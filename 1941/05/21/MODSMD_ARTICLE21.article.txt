WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP).—
President Roosevelt told his press
conference today that in 1942
Thanksgiving Day goes back to its
traditional date—the last Thursday
in November. He said he will pro
claim this year's Thanksgiving Day
as the next to the last Thursday of
the month — Nov. 20 — because of
commitments to calendar makers
and other groups.
