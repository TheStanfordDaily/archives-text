## Nazis Promise Release of 142 'Zamzamers' 
### 
LONDON, May 20 (Hi').—British
and Greek defenders of (he island of
Crete battled desperately tonight to
wipe out thousands of German para
chute troops—at least 1500 of whom
were said to he disguised in British
uniforms—before another Nazi '"air
army" can follow from the sky.
The air-borne invaders, reliably
reported to number between 10,000
and 12.000 men, suddenly were land
ed from swarms of Junkers JU-52
transports and from gliders on the
island at dawn in the biggest and
most spectacular aerial invasion over
attempted.
Prime Minister Winston Churchill,
describing a serious battle being
waged on the rugged, 140-mile-long
island of! the Greek mainland, said
British, New Zealand and Greek
troops "have the situation in hand"
after daylong fighting, much of it
hand-to-hand.
It was believed the night or early
dawn would bring another armada
of Nazi planes and gliders to drop
more masses of aerial storm troopers.
The air-borne attack was believed
by many to be a "dress rehearsal"
for a similar invasion of the British
Isles. But more important now, it ap
peared that the Germans were seek
ing to wipe out an island stumbling
block along their route to Syria.
Nazi bombers aiding the air-borne
invaders were blasting at Canea and
Candia on the Crete northern coast
line and at anti-aircraft batteries, to
wipe out resistance against further
landings.
Terrific aerial bombardments pre
ceded the dawn landings of the
parachutists of whom every man was
heavily armed and highly trained.
British airdromes bore the brunt of
the bombings.
