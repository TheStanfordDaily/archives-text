by Gene Kern who did 31.9. World
record for this unusual event is 29.8
set many years ago by Charley
Paddock. original "fastest human."
When men such as Hal Davis,
Grover Klemmer, and Cliff Bourland
run between 30 and 30.5, McFar
land's sterling run is not to be dis
counted.

half-milers run 440's to improve
their speed. Blair Hyde ran 49.5
with Captain Ernie Clark tuining in
a 49.9 lap after having run a 53 sec
ond quarter earlier in the afternoon.

Olympic Clubber Harry Jackson j
joined the team in their 440 work- :
outs. Jackson, one of the best 400

50.4. Hyde, Clark, Olson, and '
Burm Skrable will form a Iwo-mile

Drake, and U.S.C.
Drake defeated the Wolverine i
team in the Drake relays by one \
yard, the same margin by which they
defeated Stanford in the Fresno i
meet. Indiana, Penn Relay win- j
ners, should furnish the Cal four- |
some the competition they need to
break the world's record. U.S.C.
