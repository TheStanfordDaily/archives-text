YESTERDAY you saw the first
and today you see the second
in a series of articles about the 200-
odd track stars from all over the
country who will invade the Farm
for the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Track Meet on June 21
and 22.
Each article will handle an event
and will attempt to rate the per
formers on their best times or dis
tances to date. The material for
these articles has been collected and
will be presented by The Daily's
track reporter, H. D. Thoreau.
Thoreau has kept tab on track
men throughout the nation by
checking the results of such meets
as the Big Ten Meet, Drake Relays,
Texas Relays, etc.
* *
QNE startling conclusion Thoreau
arrived at as the results of this
research in track times and distances
was that Stanford ranks sixth in
the country in dual competition.
In agreement with other track ex
perts, Thoreau finds that despite the
obvious disappointment of Stanford
track fans their team could beat in
dual competition every college team
in the nation except Cal, U.S.C.. Ne
braska. Texas, and Michigan.
Of course, the unfortunate part
of the whole thing is that Coach
Pitch Johnson's eindermen are al
ways running into the two strong
est teams in the country, Califor
nia and U.S.C.—in dual competi
tion, in the P.A. meet, in the Fresno
Relays, and yet to come in the Los
Angeles Relays, and the Pacific
Coast Conference Meet.

I HOMAGE is about to be
paid to Stanford's grand old man

of minor sports, Harry Maloney. For
on May 31 in a ceremony featuring
President of the University Ray Ly
man Wilbur and O. N. Anderson
[ general director of the School of
I Health, the present soccer field will
' be named Maloney.
This to me seems a fitting way
of recognizing this lovable Irish
man who has given the last 33
years of his life in unselfish, un
tiring service toward building
Stanford manhood.

Of course, the unfortunate part
of the whole thing is that Coach
Pitch Johnson's eindermen are al

I HOMAGE is about to be
paid to Stanford's grand old man

of minor sports, Harry Maloney. For
on May 31 in a ceremony featuring
President of the University Ray Ly
man Wilbur and O. N. Anderson
[ general director of the School of
I Health, the present soccer field will
' be named Maloney.
This to me seems a fitting way
of recognizing this lovable Irish
man who has given the last 33
years of his life in unselfish, un
tiring service toward building
Stanford manhood.

for the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Track Meet on June 21

these articles has been collected and

Texas Relays, etc.

QNE startling conclusion Thoreau
arrived at as the results of this
research in track times and distances
was that Stanford ranks sixth in
the country in dual competition.
In agreement with other track ex

track fans their team could beat in
dual competition every college team
