(Editor's Note —This is the second in a series of articles dealing with
the coming N.C.A.A. track championships.)

One of the greatest fields of middle distance men ever assembled in
one meet will compete in the Stadium next month in the National Colle
giate track and field meet.
The 41!) appears to he a five-way battle between Grover Klemmer of
I California, Gene Littler of

Roy Cochrane of Indiana, and Cliff
Bourland and Hubie Kerns of U.S.C.
Littler finished a close second to
Lee Orr of Washington State in last
year's meet. Orr has graduated so
Littler would be the logical man to
win the title except for three sopho
mores from the Pacific slopes, Klem
mer, Bourland, and Kerns. Klem
mer boasts victories over Littler and
Bourland and has the best time, 46.9.
However, the Trojan pair are im
proving fast and will be the men to
beat in June.
Cochrane, a reformed low hurdler,
is Big Ten champ and indoor world
record holder. Howard Upton, an
other Trojan, who has placed in this
meet for the last two years, must be
reckoned with if he gets in top
shape.
Warren Breidenbach, Michigan
Wolverine, has switched this year to
the 880, but if he reverts to the
quarter he will be in the money
since he has run 47.2.
Ernie Clark and Don McFarland
of Stanford, Fay Froome of Califor
nia. Oris Erwin of L.S.U., A1 Diebolt
of Colgate, and three metropolitan
New Yorkers, John Campbell, Ernie
Quigley, and Hal Bogrow, are other
probable entries.
The half-mile will present no less
a field of stars with defending
champ Campbell Kane battling In
dians Blair Hyde and Francis Ol
son, Bear Clarence Barnes, Trojan
Warren Smith, Mac Umstaddt of
Texas, Lowell Baal of Drake, A1
Lang and Bill Dale of W.S.C., and
Briedenbach.
Stanford is the 36th largest col
lege in the United States.

The 41!) appears to he a five-way battle between Grover Klemmer of
I California, Gene Littler of

Roy Cochrane of Indiana, and Cliff
Bourland and Hubie Kerns of U.S.C.
Littler finished a close second to
Lee Orr of Washington State in last
year's meet. Orr has graduated so
Littler would be the logical man to
win the title except for three sopho
mores from the Pacific slopes, Klem
mer, Bourland, and Kerns. Klem
mer boasts victories over Littler and
Bourland and has the best time, 46.9.
However, the Trojan pair are im
proving fast and will be the men to
beat in June.
Cochrane, a reformed low hurdler,
is Big Ten champ and indoor world
record holder. Howard Upton, an
other Trojan, who has placed in this
meet for the last two years, must be
reckoned with if he gets in top
shape.
Warren Breidenbach, Michigan
Wolverine, has switched this year to
the 880, but if he reverts to the
quarter he will be in the money
since he has run 47.2.
Ernie Clark and Don McFarland
of Stanford, Fay Froome of Califor
nia. Oris Erwin of L.S.U., A1 Diebolt
of Colgate, and three metropolitan
New Yorkers, John Campbell, Ernie
Quigley, and Hal Bogrow, are other
probable entries.
The half-mile will present no less
a field of stars with defending
champ Campbell Kane battling In
dians Blair Hyde and Francis Ol
son, Bear Clarence Barnes, Trojan
Warren Smith, Mac Umstaddt of
Texas, Lowell Baal of Drake, A1
Lang and Bill Dale of W.S.C., and
Briedenbach.
Stanford is the 36th largest col
lege in the United States.

One of the greatest fields of middle distance men ever assembled in
one meet will compete in the Stadium next month in the National Colle
