### 
With this week being the last
week of the three-week spring bas
ketball period, Coach Everett Dean
and assistants Beeb Lee and Bobby
Burnett are putting the 2ti varsity
holdovers and aspirants through
their final paces.
Much of the time throughout the
three-week sessions has been de
voted to drills on the all-important
fundamentals with offensive and de
fensive plays being given some at
tention. With the weather permit
ting, some of the drills are being
held outside, which meets the ap
proval of the "country club" set.
Coach Dean has planned for
Thursday, which is the last session
of the spring practice period, a regu
lation length scrimmage between the
seniors of last great cham
pionship outfit and a team composed
of the boys who are out for spring
practice.
The senior team will be made up
of Don Williams, all-coast forward
last year, Kenny Davidson, all
coast guard last year, Big Dick Tay
lor, towering center Bob "Pappy"
Wensel, and Bobby Burnett at the
guard spots.
H. V. "Beeb" Lee, frosh basket
ball mentor, will officiate and might
even play for the seniors if needed.
