# Footballers Go 'Crazy Wid Heat'
## 
### 
Fancy jivin' was in stylo yester
day on the turf for Clark Shaugh
nessy's "razzle rascals" — dcy was
crazy wid de heatwaves.
While the mercury soared to rec
ord - breaking heights, the spring
gridders worked in a "dazzle it" shift
to keep the defense guessing.
Whether or not Headman Shaugh
nessy actually expects to use it is -a
question—it could be. •
When he wasn't razzling, Bob Dit
levson gathered passes in top-notch
style. The Red backs for the day
were Frankie Albert, Milt Vucinich,
Buck Fawcett, and Billy Ravetto.
Shaughnessy put in all of his backs
soon, and the Blues and Reds were
playing side by side at times. End
Bill Symes loped down the field to
snag lofty aerials from Messrs. Al
bert, Ray Hammett, and Bob
Mitchell.
Double-man-in-motion plays took
15 or 20 minutes of the afternoon's

! handiwork. And the "razzle" was
. innovated just before the practice
| ended. Line blocking turned into
finessing as flankers played wide and
charged back toward the line to
| take opposing ends out of the play.
It was so hot that body serim
j mage was left entirely off the day's
| program. Perspiration streamed off
the players' faces like rivers—more
is expected today.
MADISON, Wis., May 20 (UP).—
