# The 						Spiny Caucus
## 
### 
LAST night Ex Committee discussed the ques
tion of Stanford's caucus system pro and
con, found the cons were too heavily in the
majority, and appointed a sub-committee to look
extensively into the possibilities of a complete
revision of the Farm's elective system.
For a half-hour Excom members aired their
views on the present caucus setup, found prac
tically a unanimous feeling that the caucuses
haven't been doing the job iliey were cut out
for, and tendered suggestions for a possible
revision.
* ★ * *
The alternative, which found overwhelming
support, was the possibility of creating a system
of open nominations and primary elections in
the place of the present caucus setup.
The value of open nominations and primaries
in brief is the extension of the nominating privi
lege to the student body as a whole rather than
pseudo-representatives in a stacked-deck cau
cus.
Open nominations will mean that the best men
for each position will be able to run, instead of
facing the all-too-likely possibility of being dis
carded in a caucus in favor of a politically more
powerful candidate.
Primary elections will push the responsibility
of choosing the final candidates upon the stu
dent body itself rather than upon the closely
knit caucus system.
The caucus system, through the perspective
of the best pair of rose-colored glasses, is a
system devised to pair the top candidates for
each respective position.
But in practice, during at least the past four
or five years, the caucus has turned into a
miniature primary election—miniature in size
of personnel, but tremendous in respect to
power.
It has taken upon itself the power to speak
for the student body, with neither the right nor
the knowledge necessary to do so.
One possible weakness of the primary system
cannot be disregarded. The possibility that the
caucus can continue to hold the top cards even
under the proposed revision.
Perhaps it can, and yet it seems unlikely.
Today's type of caucus, where "representa
tives" of each group meet to select candidates
for the general election, carries a tremendous
amount of weight. Weight primarily because
the caucus votes by living group, and not by
the men in that living group.
And, when pressure is brought to bear upon
a recalcitrant candidate who wishes to "bolt the
caucus" it is through the plea that "You're let
ting down the boys. We'll be running two men
against their one and they'll slide in on a split
vote."
You can't "let down the boys" under a pri
mary election system. It will merely mean that
the two men who run in the general election will
be picked by the campus, and not by the unrep
resentative caucus. There can't be a "split vote"
in the general election under the new system
because the two top men—and only two—will
be running.
And so the caucus loses its major weapon.
* * * *
And above and beyond the technical and dem
ocratic improvement of a primary system comes
the feeling that such a system will do much
toward disembodying the false feeling of Row-
Hall differences that arise twice a year along
with student body elections.
The only remaining wedges which create
the remnants or a split are the two elections.
And the pile driver behind the wedge is the
caucus system.
Remove the pile driver, the wedge is useless,
and the split is gone.

You can't "let down the boys" under a pri
mary election system. It will merely mean that
the two men who run in the general election will
be picked by the campus, and not by the unrep
resentative caucus. There can't be a "split vote"
in the general election under the new system
because the two top men—and only two—will
be running.
And so the caucus loses its major weapon.
* * * *
And above and beyond the technical and dem
ocratic improvement of a primary system comes
the feeling that such a system will do much
toward disembodying the false feeling of Row-
Hall differences that arise twice a year along
with student body elections.
The only remaining wedges which create
the remnants or a split are the two elections.
And the pile driver behind the wedge is the
caucus system.
Remove the pile driver, the wedge is useless,
and the split is gone.
LAST night Ex Committee discussed the ques
tion of Stanford's caucus system pro and
con, found the cons were too heavily in the
majority, and appointed a sub-committee to look
extensively into the possibilities of a complete
revision of the Farm's elective system.
For a half-hour Excom members aired their
views on the present caucus setup, found prac
tically a unanimous feeling that the caucuses
haven't been doing the job iliey were cut out
for, and tendered suggestions for a possible
revision.

The alternative, which found overwhelming
support, was the possibility of creating a system
of open nominations and primary elections in
the place of the present caucus setup.
The value of open nominations and primaries
in brief is the extension of the nominating privi
lege to the student body as a whole rather than
pseudo-representatives in a stacked-deck cau
cus.
Open nominations will mean that the best men
for each position will be able to run, instead of
facing the all-too-likely possibility of being dis
carded in a caucus in favor of a politically more
powerful candidate.
Primary elections will push the responsibility
of choosing the final candidates upon the stu
dent body itself rather than upon the closely
knit caucus system.
The caucus system, through the perspective
of the best pair of rose-colored glasses, is a
system devised to pair the top candidates for
each respective position.
But in practice, during at least the past four
or five years, the caucus has turned into a
miniature primary election—miniature in size
of personnel, but tremendous in respect to
power.
It has taken upon itself the power to speak
for the student body, with neither the right nor
the knowledge necessary to do so.
One possible weakness of the primary system
cannot be disregarded. The possibility that the
caucus can continue to hold the top cards even
under the proposed revision.
Perhaps it can, and yet it seems unlikely.
Today's type of caucus, where "representa
tives" of each group meet to select candidates
for the general election, carries a tremendous
amount of weight. Weight primarily because
the caucus votes by living group, and not by
the men in that living group.
And, when pressure is brought to bear upon
a recalcitrant candidate who wishes to "bolt the
caucus" it is through the plea that "You're let
ting down the boys. We'll be running two men
against their one and they'll slide in on a split
vote."
