### JERRY MAYER 
THAT WE MAY LIVE
jVO MATTER what the outcomc of the present World
War it is becoming increasingly apparent to most
Americans that the United States' future lies in culti
vating South America as an economic sphere of influ
ence. For if Germany wins the war, this country would
not be able to retain its present form of democracy
and still compete with the Nazis in the world market.
Slave labor from defeated countries combined with
rigid government control of prices would allow Ger
many to undersell the United States at almost every
point. To meet this competition, we would be forced
to lower our living standards considerably and per
haps even fall back ourselves on more dominant gov
ernment control of output.
The opening of America's western frontiers paved
the way for this country's tremendous economic ex
pansion of the late 19th century. Our western fron
tiers now reach to the Pacific Ocean. America, at the
present time practically an industrial nation, must look
elsewhere for its markets. And South America is so
logical a choice for our continued expansion that it
seems strange that it took a war to make most of us
discover its importance.
* * * *
JF AMERICA could establish an intelligent economic
arrangement with the southern continent it is
probable that we could maintain our economic and po
litical status quo indefinitely. Colonel Charles A.
Lindbergh, whose views I do not always share, several
years ago made one of the most intelligent sugges
tions for future organization in the western hemi
sphere. It was Lindbergh's suggestion that the United
States confine itself to being an industrial nation and
depend upon Canada and the other American countries
for its raw materials. Thus, each country, while being
dependent upon the other countries, would have a
definite place in the economic scheme. Principally,
however, such an organization of the western hemi
sphere would make it a tight unit in itself, abso
lutely independent of the rest of the world.
At the present time the United States is attempting
to make up for lost time in South America. German
influence is very strong now, due to the general apathy
until recently of this country toward the welfare of
its southern neighbors.
* * * *
COURSE, the one formidable obstacle to com
plete co-operation with South America looms in
the United States' "farm bloc," which exercises an in
fluence entirely out of proportion to its importance to
the country. It was this farm bloc which recently
passed the "Argentine beef" bill, effectively throttling
any chance for a complete understanding with the
far southern countr-y.
If we are to keep South America to ourselves we
will have to make several short-run sacrifices. There
would have to be a readjustment of industry and of
labor. If South America is to be an American market
we must make sure that we can import their principal
products, even if it means shelving some of our own
industry that conflicts with theirs.
Right now agriculture seems to be the chief bone
of contention. Our future in South America, in fact
I might add. our entire economic future, may well
depend upon making our agriculture see the light.

products, even if it means shelving some of our own
industry that conflicts with theirs.
Right now agriculture seems to be the chief bone
of contention. Our future in South America, in fact
I might add. our entire economic future, may well
depend upon making our agriculture see the light.
THAT WE MAY LIVE
jVO MATTER what the outcomc of the present World
War it is becoming increasingly apparent to most
Americans that the United States' future lies in culti
vating South America as an economic sphere of influ
ence. For if Germany wins the war, this country would
not be able to retain its present form of democracy
and still compete with the Nazis in the world market.
Slave labor from defeated countries combined with
rigid government control of prices would allow Ger
many to undersell the United States at almost every
point. To meet this competition, we would be forced
to lower our living standards considerably and per
haps even fall back ourselves on more dominant gov
ernment control of output.
The opening of America's western frontiers paved
the way for this country's tremendous economic ex
pansion of the late 19th century. Our western fron
tiers now reach to the Pacific Ocean. America, at the
present time practically an industrial nation, must look
elsewhere for its markets. And South America is so
logical a choice for our continued expansion that it
seems strange that it took a war to make most of us
discover its importance.

JF AMERICA could establish an intelligent economic
arrangement with the southern continent it is
probable that we could maintain our economic and po
litical status quo indefinitely. Colonel Charles A.
Lindbergh, whose views I do not always share, several
years ago made one of the most intelligent sugges
tions for future organization in the western hemi
sphere. It was Lindbergh's suggestion that the United
States confine itself to being an industrial nation and
depend upon Canada and the other American countries
for its raw materials. Thus, each country, while being
dependent upon the other countries, would have a
definite place in the economic scheme. Principally,
however, such an organization of the western hemi
sphere would make it a tight unit in itself, abso
lutely independent of the rest of the world.
At the present time the United States is attempting
to make up for lost time in South America. German
influence is very strong now, due to the general apathy
until recently of this country toward the welfare of
its southern neighbors.
* * * *
COURSE, the one formidable obstacle to com
plete co-operation with South America looms in
the United States' "farm bloc," which exercises an in
fluence entirely out of proportion to its importance to
the country. It was this farm bloc which recently
passed the "Argentine beef" bill, effectively throttling
any chance for a complete understanding with the
far southern countr-y.
If we are to keep South America to ourselves we
will have to make several short-run sacrifices. There
would have to be a readjustment of industry and of
labor. If South America is to be an American market
we must make sure that we can import their principal
products, even if it means shelving some of our own
industry that conflicts with theirs.
