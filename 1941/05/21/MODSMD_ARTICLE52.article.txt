AH-H-H-H-II CIIOO!

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
The letter in The Daily asking what to do about
"Hay Fever" amused and interested me. I, who have
been born and bred in a family of "hayers," think I
know all of the answers. I give a little history to con
vince you of my experience with the stuff. My moth
er's father had it all his life, and finally at the age
of 65 "outgrew it." That was about the remedy then.
Our generation feels that 65 years are not short.
My mother spent the entire day before she was
married in a shaded room with all the windows closed
sneezing 12 times in succession periodically throughout
the day. She was a June bride. But oh! The tragedy
when I discovered that it was my turn. (The "tend
ency" is hereditary). So I hand on to you all the
"home" and scientific remedies that I know.
The hay fever victim is marked by the Kleenex
box, which can now be bought in any color to match
the dross or lipstick. Needless to say, this holds no
humor for me. My nose is bright red from using the
things now. It is impossible to keep supplied with
handkerchiefs.
If your eyes are burning and everyone thinks you
are crying (which you feel like) use Estivin, which
are eye drops in a brown bottle for 89 cents. They are
so good that my roommate steals them. (She has it
too.) "Afedrin, with Mytol" are little yellow capsules
which will give you a chance to sleep at night in
stead of walking around all night with your mouth
open.
Some of the secrets: (1) Never drive with the car
windows open, especially the thig-a-mi-jigger in front
of the windshield. Of course you lose all passengers,
but by that time you don't care. (2) Sleep in a room
with the windows closed. I'd rather suffocate that
way than from the hay fever. (The sleeping porch is
fatal.) Remember that pollen can travel 20 miles in
the wind. Maybe you can afford a window box device
that washes the air of dust and pollen.
If your head is unbearable cut your classes and
use alternately burning hot and freezing cold compress
es on the bridge of your nose. If nothing else, merely
the attention of giving yourself the treatment will
make you feel better.
To get at the root of the trouble go to the doctor
to be tested. It means about 40 needle shots, but it's
worth it! Find out what gives you hay fever, and avoid
it like poison. It it's foctd it's up to you. If it's a
pollen have some serum shots of the stuff and build
up immunity. It might be almost anything—feathers?
—get a kapoc pillow; furs? powder—Dorothy Gray's
doesn't have orris root in it; horse? (that's my strong
allergy and my favorite sport.) So it goes. I under
stand the men's gym has a doctor who can discover
your trouble by electrolysis.
Usually no one sympathizes with hay fever. Stan
ford is swarming with "Hayers." You all have my
deepest sympathy and my humble offering of these
few home remedies. One word more — have your
house air-conditioned, or live in a movie. Helpful, isn't
if?
