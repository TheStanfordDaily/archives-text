"THE WHITE CLIFFS," a Victor
Red Seal Allium, on sale at Hagc's
Music Stanford Music Shop.
This is the dramatic reading by
Lynn Fontanne of Alice Duer Mill
er's, "The White Cliffs." The long
narrative poem tells the story of an
American woman's life in her adopt
ed country, England.
Giving every bit as dramatic a
performance as she did in "There
Shall Be No Night," Miss Fontanne
makes this slight poem into a ten
der and sympathetic tale. She also
makes it as subtle a bit of propa
ganda as she and her husband did
with Robert Sherwood's play.
The poem describes a young Amer
ican girl's romance in England in
1914 and her war-time marriage. Her
husband loses his life serving his
country, but she is left a son whom
she raises in a country village in
England.
The second World War comes and
she is forced to see her son march
off with his regiment. The poem
comes to an end with her proud of
letting her only son go to defend
England, her adopted country.
Miss Fontanne's reading covers
the whole story: the young girl, the
wife and finally the grief-stricken
mother. At all times does she have
the story successfully in hand, keep
ing it natural and plausible.
She registers gaiety, love, pathos,
determination with a complete lack
of theatricals. Altogether it adds up
to a minor triumph. An excellent
orchestra keeps the background mu
sic, arranged by Frank Black, per
fectly in keeping with her reading.
This is on a parallel with the "Mrs.
Miniver" stories and should be as
popular.—W uenschel
