# 'Hay Fever' Opens Tonight Gesundheit!
## 
### 
"Hay Fever"—and we don't mean
maybe!—will hit the campus tonight
at 8:15 when the Noel Coward play
of that name opens a four-night run
in the Little Theater.
The wave of hay fever which hit
the campus recently, borne on
strong breezes, nearly put some of
the cast out of commission for a few
days, but conditions are steadily
improving and the play will open as
scheduled.
The English comedy tells the
story of a nutty family, who have a
house party; the hitch being that no
member of the family knows that
others have asked guests until the
last minute. The dilemmas that en
sue, the polite rudeness and awk
ward conversations all combine to
give a witty and light play.
Members of the Bliss family will
be played by Ann Meadows as Ju
dith, the mother; Quentin Warren
as David, her husband; Peggy
Mayer, Sorel, the daughter; and
Adolfo Arias, Simon, the son.
Guests of the occasion will be
Janice Schwenson as Myra Arundel,
guest of Simon; Roscoe Jones as
Sandy Tyrrell, invited by Judith;
Jackie Caryton, friend of David; and
Richard Greatham, guest of Sorel.
Joyce Peckham will play Clara, the
maid.
The situation is a typical Coward
scheme which brings together four
couples of matched ages, but each
guest is older or younger than his
host.
For tickets, at 50 cents, call at the
box office, or phone Mr. Barker at
P A. 22041.
