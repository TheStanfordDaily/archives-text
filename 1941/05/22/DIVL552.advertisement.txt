A BOOK OFTHE MONTH CLUB
MEMBERSHIP
It's now easy to subscribe;
here on the Campus,
through our bookstore
WHAT more useful, helpful gift for young men
and women leaving high school or college!—a
Book-of-the-Month Club membership to help them
begin to build their own libraries, and to keep them
from missing the important new books and authors
that are being widely talked about.
When you give a Book-of-the-Month Club sub
scription, you give extra book values. Because for
every two Club selections received, the member also
gets one of the Club's valuable book-dividends free.
For every dollar members spend for books-of-the
month, they receive back about in the form of
free books ([figured at retail value).
You can now arrange a Book-of-the-Month Club
subscription at our bookstore, at no additional charge
for our service.
FREE . , . TO NEW MEMBERS
