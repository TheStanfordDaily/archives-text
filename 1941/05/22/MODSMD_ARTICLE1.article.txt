YV/HILE the British Empire forces
continued their desperate fight
to prevent further gains by the Nazi
juggernaut toward the Near East,
William S. Knudsen, director of the
Office of Production Management,
announced yesterday that the United
States would be turning out 500
heavy bombers a month by the lat
ter part of 1942.
This news, obviously heartening
to the hard-pressed Empire forces,
nevertheless must cause them
some misgivings. A United States
producing 6,000 heavy bombers a
year would definitely establish
aerial superiority for the Allies.
But the latter part of 1942 is still a
far-distant period.
Yesterday German parachute
troops continued their invasion of
the badly undermanned island of
Crete, which is defended by a har
ried Greek-British force recently
evacuated from the mainland. Win
ston Churchill admitted to the Brit
ish House of Commons yesterday
that "we must expect that the fight
ing must continue and increase in
severity." According to seemingly
authoritative sources, the Germans
have landed approximately 10,000
troops in Crete. The Prime Minis
ter's evaluation of the acuteness of
the situation doesn't appear exag
gerated.

jyjEANWIIILE in Africa British
forces are rapidly closing in on
the remnants of two Italian divi
sions in Ethiopia's lake region south
of Addis Ababa after taking nearly
19,000 prisoners in the capitulation of
the Duke of Aosta's northern army,
it was reported yesterday.
General Sir Archibald WavelPs
Middle East command is attempt
ing to complete its conquest of
Italian East Africa as quick as
possible in order to release thou
sands of troops for duty on the
crucial Mediterranean battlcfronts.
That rapidity is essential seems ap
parent. If Britain expects to be
in a position to utilize America's
increased 1942 production output,
it must prevent the German sweep
toward the Mosul oil fields.
The Axis drive toward the Suez
Canal across Egypt was still stalled
around Solium, just inside the Egyp
tian border where British mechan
ized patrols were said to have "again
vigorously harassed the enemy." The
Iraq situation seems to be pretty
well under British control.

JTOWEVER, Churchill's hopes for
complete Empire unity were
dealt somewhat of a blow as an or
ganization of Ulster nationalists
raised a strong voice in opposition of
conscription of Ulsterites for the
British army. Representing about
one-third of Northern Ireland's
population, the nationalists are hop
ing for support from Eire. The Ul
sterites are looking to Prime Min
ister Eamon de Valera to put Eire
publicly on record against the plan.
Reliable sources, however, assert
that the Ulster cabinet has approved
the conscription plan revealed Wed
nesday by Churchill.
Captain Denis Ireland, a writer
and radio commentator, who is
leader of the movement opposing
conscription, said that "the only
weapons the people of Ireland will
fight a totalitarian war with are
love and unity." At the present
Northern Ireland follows a vol
unteer plan of military service.

San Francisco yesterday was the
scene of a dramatic labor incident
that led to the reopening of three
of the eleven shipyards closed two
weeks ago by a strike of AFL and
CIO machinists. Led by John P.
Frey, head of the AFL metal trades
department, workers disembarked
from taxis and crossed a booing
picket line.
