# Hay Fever's Fun—Surprise; Sneezing Audience Approves
## 
### ASH WILSON 
Noel Coward's "Hay Fever" started a three-night run ui the Memo
rial Hall Little Theater last night, and if it's entertainment you're after
taken an evening off between now and Sunday and go see it.
For this play Mr. Coward has taken an often used and decidedly suc
cessful subject—a family of mild lunatics. David and Judith Bliss, writer
and actress, respectively, live in Cookham, somewhere out from London,
with their two children, Simon and Sorel. Simon paints and Sorel seems
to do nothing but live the life of the leisure class. That any of thein really
work, except Simon, would be hard to imagine.
FOUR GUESTS
Into this country madhouse come four guests, each invited by one and
unexpected by the rest of the family. And with this a week-end with the
mad but delightful Blisses begins, a week-end replete with myriad love
affairs, unbearably dull gatherings after dinner, and family squabbles that
reach monstrous proportions. No normal person could live under such
conditions, and so the play ends with the guests folding up their tents,
like the Arabs, and quietly stealing away.
WELL CAST
The cast of the Stanford players did remarkably well with this me
ringue-like bit of playwriting. Anne Meadows handled the part of Judith,
by far the most difficult in the play, with ease, displaying a good deal of
technique, but her characterization was marred by a lack of authority.
She didn't quite seem like an actress who had been the flame of millions.
As her son, Simon, Adolfo Arias turned in one of the finer performances
of the evening, displaying both a feel for Coward's dialogue, and an
ability to transmit it. Also, Jeanne Smith as Jackie Coryton turned in a
charmingly bewildered performance. Frank Burt and Quentin Warren as
Richard Greatham and David Bliss turned in fine jobs, as did Peggy
Mayer and Janice Schwensen. Roscoe Jones and Joyce Peckham, both
with lesser roles, did very well.
ACT II SLOW
Charles Vance's directing was fine. He has gotten together a cast which
is made up of many new faces, and has turned out a nicely paced show.
However, 1 do believe that the end of the second act was a little slow.
The set by William Girvan was in the very best of taste. And the
costuming was excellent.
