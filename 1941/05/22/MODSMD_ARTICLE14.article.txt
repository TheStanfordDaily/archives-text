# Daily Foreman To Say 'Si, Si'
## 
### PEGGY BOOTHE 
After seeing that the last Daily of
this volume is safely put to bed,
Charles "Charley" Wegner, Daily
press shop foreman, will leave May
31 with Mrs. Wegner on a trip to
Mexico City. From the country of
bullfights and senoritas, the Wegners
will drive to Minneapolis and then to
Yellowstone, before returning home.
TO VISIT DAUGHTER
Principal purpose for the jaunt is
to visit the Wegners' daughter and
son-in-law who live in Mexico City.
Charley hopes to meet Avila Co
macho, new president of Mexico and
a friend of his son-in-law.
"Absolutely" was the reply when
he was asked if he would notice the
bullfights and beautiful senoritas.
The Wegners are more interested in
seeing the surroundings of Mexico
City than the city itself, since, in
Charley's own words, "Mexico City
is only an ordinary place with a
million or so people crammed in it."
TO SEE MINNESOTA
While they are in Minnesota they
will visit his mother. By driving to
New Orleans on the return from
P4exico, he could complete the
family reunion by seeing a relative
there, but he doubts if they will
make the long detour to do it.
Although Charley claims he isn't
particularly thrilled about the pros
pective trip, he thinks the drive
should be interesting, since the road
is entirely new from San Bernardino.
Their summer trips are usually to
the Pacific Northwest.
