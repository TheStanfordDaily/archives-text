# Turner Sponsors 'Self Denial Day'
## 
### 
Bill Turner, recent delegate to the
"Young America Wants to Help"
conference sponsored by Mrs. Ker
mit Roosevelt Jr. in Washington, is
asking Stanford's co-operation with
the "Self Denial Day" on May 29.
Stressing the purely humanitarian
aspect of the cause, Turner is asking
Farm men and women to give up a
package of cigarettes or a few gal
lons of gas on that day and give the
money to a fund which will be used
to help send a mobile kitchen unit
to the women and children of Eng
land. Letters are being sent to the
heads of all campus living groups
asking their assistance in backing
this cause.
