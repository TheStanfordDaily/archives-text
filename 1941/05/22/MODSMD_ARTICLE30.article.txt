baters from the Class of '43 won
this year's annual freshman-sopho
more debate which was held before
Luncheon Club yesterday.
Sophomores Shorty Gran 11 is, Jim
Frolik, and Larry Werner supported
the suggestion of having compulsory

two years of elective training, Stan
ford men would automatically be
come commissioned officers upon
graduation.
With such a plan operating 011 the
Farm, said Grannis, who was the
first speaker for the affirmative, boys

which the United States believes
necessary without sacrificing the in
tellectual training which they need
as citizens in later life.
Freshmen opposed military train
ing with the argument that college
students would be forced into it un
fairly before draft age. A1 Cleave

which the government would spend
in college military training should
be used instead to establish military
training camps for those who wished
to volunteer to become officers.
Freshmen Allan Armer and Howard
Ledeen also spoke for the negative.
