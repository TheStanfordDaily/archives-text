# Houses Rehash Rushing Rules
## 
### 
Interfraternity Council rehashed
rushing rules Tuesday night with the
purpose of making the rush period
easier for both fraternities and En
cina men and eliminating loopholes
which have caused infractions of the
rules in the past.
Sandy Tatum, Zete president and
chairman of a committee investigat
ing last year's rushing rules, stated
that next fall's regulations v/ill be
essentially the same as they have
been in the past, but that the rules
arid the changes made will be strictly
enforced.
Significant change made in the
rushing schedule for next, fall is to
have two open house periods at the
fraternities instead of one. No invi
tations to open houses will be sent
out, and Encinamen may visit any
house they wish during this time.
The Council made it. clear that in
dividual infractions of rushing rules
involve the entire house. In the past,
houses charged with illegal rushing
have found a loophole in the regu -
lations and declared that it was one
person who violated the rules.
A specific time for contacting
freshmen at Encina was arranged.
The only legal time for fraternity
men to visit Encina during rushing
will be between 10 and 12 at nieht.
