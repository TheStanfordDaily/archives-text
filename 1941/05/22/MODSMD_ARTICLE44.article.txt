# Businessmen Top Phi Psi Nine, 5 to 3
## 
### 
One of the best games of the 1941
intramural baseball season came
yesterday in the final regular hard
ball contest, as the Business School,
behind the smooth pitching of Bob
Hamilton, edged a favored Phi Psi
nine, 5 to 3.
A protest against the use of Ham
ilton, brother of Glenn Hamilton,
former Stanford gridder, in the game
was filed by Phi Psi on the grounds
that Hamilton has played profes
sional ball and is therefore ineligible.
GOOD PITCHING
The game itself was close all the
way. Both Hamilton and Tiff Den
ton, Phi Psi twirler, pitched con
sistent ball, each allowing only five
hits.
Two triples by Hamilton played a
major part in the graduates' .win.
Jack Murphy also tripled for the
businessmen as well as handling his
first base job without an error.
Bruce Howard, third - sacker,
turned in a good fielding job for the
losers.
OVERCOME LEAD
Starting strongly, the Phi Psi's,
who hold a 23 to 0 win over Sigma
Nu, jumped into a 2 to 0 lead and
held it until the fifth inning when
Hamilton and his teammates unlim
bered their bats to score 4 deciding
runs.
With Kai Larsen and Tom Kruger
hitting home runs, the Firehouse
soft bailers defeated A.K.L., 20 to 2.
Frank Pfyl hurled for the winners
while Dave Narver pitched for the
Row team.

Forfeits marked other contests as
the Betas forfeited to Theta Xi, En
cina 2W defaulted to the Alpha Sigs,
Kappa Alpha forfeited to the Chem
Department, and the D.U.'s forfeited

losers.
