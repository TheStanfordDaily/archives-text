# Good Distance Men in NCAA
## 
### 
The respective coaches of the na
tion's six greatest milers all claim
that their man will show his heels
to the pack in the coming N.C.A.A.
next month.
Indoor Champion Les MacMitch
ell of New York U. has the best time,
4:07.4, but outdoors his margin
would be very slight. Campbell
Kane, Indiana defending 880 champ,
has run 4:11.8 outdoors and will be
a strong contender if he concen
trates on the longer race.
IDAHO IRON MAN
Phil Leibowitz, slim Idaho dis
tance star, ran 4:12.2 and 1:52.3 with
no competition in the same meet. He
should break 4:10 if he runs all-out.
Dick Peter of Cal and Leroy Weed
of U.S.C. have run 4:11.5 and 4:12.8,
respectively. Weed finished seventh
behind Leibowitz in the 1940 meet.
NOT SLOW GINN
Surprise miler of the season is
Bob Ginn, skinny Nebraska soph.
Coming out of comparative obscurity
he defeated Peter in 4:10.1 for the
best outdoor time recorded this year.
Three Big Ten runners, Paul Ken
dall, another Hoosier, Ed Holder
man of Purdue, and Los Eisenhart
of Ohio State, will compete against
Max Lenover of Loyola at Chicago,
Noel Williams of Washington State,
and maybe Francis Olson of Stan
ford for the remaining spot.
TWO-MILE OPEN
The two-mile race will be wide
open since the top men last year
graduated. Wayne Tolliver and
Freddie Wilt, two more Indiana
men, have been running under 9:20.
Tom Quinn of Michigan Normal and
Bob Madrid of Fresno are the only
men returning who placed last year.
Sophomore Oliver Hunter of Notre
Dame will attempt to follow Greg
Rice's footsteps and win in his first
year. Gil Dodds of little-known
Ashland College and Holderman
should place on last year's form. Few
Coast two-milers rank with the
Easterners in this event.
