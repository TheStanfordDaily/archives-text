# 'Greens' Steal Football Show

### 
Third-string Greens stole the show
I yesterday as Clark Shaughnessy's
warriors sparkled and sweated
through another sun-steeped scrim
j mage â€” Jim Cox, Bob Brown, Bob
i Mastin, and Jim Troupe were the
j defensive standouts. Interested spec
] tator was Bobby Grayson, Stanford
All-American of '34 and '35.
At right tackle tall, angular Cox
| broke up play after play, three times
| dumping Red and Blue ball carriers
far to the left of his normal playing
position. Once he spilled half Bob
Ditlevson as Dit came through his
own right tackle.
Mastin smothered the first two
plays, both aimed between end and
tackle. Brown, playing defensive
full to back up the left side of the
line, charged up fast to get in a lot
' of tackles at the scrimmage stripe.
Troupe, holding down defensive
right half, figured end runs nicely
and came up in a hurry to collar the
runner.
Fiankie Albert quickly shifted to
lan aerial bombardment. First he
j fired a bullet throw short over the
line to right end Freddy Meyer, and
I Meyer cut in and broke clear. Bob
| Mitchell, quarterbacking for the
Blues, took his turn and shot one to
| Bill Ravetto for a nice gain, then
Albert flung another to Meyer that
j was good for 12 yards.
Mitchell tried one to Bill Symes
s that went for eight more, and Al
i bert got off his best try of the day,
good for 35 yards to Buck Fawcett.
Before the scrimmaging Shaugh
nessy sent three teams through
plays, polishing for Saturday after
noon's public appcarance in the
stadium.
