## 
### 
Taking a look into the crystal ball
of the future, Head Coach Pitch
Johnson and Assistant Mentor Clyde
Jeffrey will hold the first Encina
track meet today at 4 o'clock to find
out if any hidden talent is lurking
among first year men.
With the exception of the two
mile and possibly the mile, a full
program of events will be run off.
Judging from preliminary sign-ups,
a large turnout can be expected,
especially in the field events.
All members of the freshman track
squad are ineligible for competition
so that the meet will be completely
fair. "Condition means very little in
this meet," emphasizes Johnson.
"Come out and you may find that
you have hidden talent in some track
event."
Races and events will be run off
just as in a regular track meet ex
cept that the high hurdle race will
be 80 yards instead of 120 and the
low hurdles will be 160 yards in
stead of 220.
