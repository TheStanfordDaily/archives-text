# Relay Officials Slight Stanford Field Athletes
## 
### H. DAVID THOREAU 
Coach Pitch Johnson's idea of
which Stanford trackmen should go
to the L.A. Relays next Saturday
J differs slightly from that of the meet
j authorities, and since the latter are
paying the expenses, Johnson must
sway them to his line of reasoning.
Since the meet is strictly invita
tional and only picked fields are
competing, several of Stanford's out
| standing field event men may not
make the trip south. However, John
son is fighting to get all possible
men entered who have a good chance
I in the competition.
RELAY TEAMS GO
At present only the four-man 440
I and two-mile relay teams and discus
I thrower Emerson Hiler are invited.
Johnson is attempting to take pole
vaulters Russ Peck and Ed Tomaso,
high jumpers Jim Lincoln and Vern
I Hirt, arid broad jumpers Thor Pe
j terson and Vic Chambers. Gene
| Kern, broad jumper, will probably
| run on the sprint relay team so he
! is not in doubt.
All these men have far better than
average marks and stand good
chances of placing high in spite of
the picked talent in each event.
There will be no shot or javelin, so
A1 Grey and Bob Stone will be in-f.
I active this week-end.
SPRINTERS MOVE
The team of Monte Pfvl, Roy
Bursch, Johnny Grant, and Don Mc-
Farland ran the quarter-mile dis
tance yesterday afternoon in 42.4.
They will undoubtedly improve on
this time in competition. Johnson
had his half-milers, Ernie Clark,
Burm Skrable, Blair Hyde, and
Francis Olson, running 1320's today
to build up their endurance.
The open events Saturday will be
] the 440, mile, and two-mile relays,
the 100, mile, and high hurdles, and
I the four field events. There will
J also be eight junior college and
I high school events.
