### CHUCK SMITH 
IT DOESN'T seem like very long ago that five Stanford basketball play
ers were named All-Southern Division and then traveled up north
to lose two heartbreakers to Washington State in the playoffs for the
Coast Conference crown.
And yet already Coach Everett Dean has whipped into shape in
three weeks of spring practice a team which bids fair to repeat if not
better the performances of last season's All-All-Coast outfit.
Dr. Dean feels that spring practice is important in the respect that by
concentrating on eliminating weaknesses and strengthening strong points,
an individual player will improve himself for the following season.
The reason for this procedure is the fact that basketball is a game of
habits—habits that are acquired with difficulty at first but which, once
they are grasped, are carried out subconsciously in the heat of a game
or scrimmage.
And so, though a player will show no apparent improvement during
the spring practice sessions, next fall and winter the gotid habits he started
forming five and six months before will automatically appear in his play.

A LITTLE about that team that has every bit the ability, speed, height,
and accuracy that Davidson, Williams and Co. of 1941 had.
In the first place Dean has switched the positions of several of the
returning veterans. As the Farm basketball fan knows the designation of
guard and forward in Dean's whirling, fast breaking system of offense
has little meaning. And on defense it merely indicates which man is
closest to the blackboard for defensive rebounding.
And so without very much effort Dean has been able to work Don
Burness - , last season's center into a defensive guard and an offensive
forward.
Fordy Anderson, in the latest workouts has been holding down his old
position of forward on offense —on his toes for those lightning like quick
breaks—but Fordy has been doing a lot of ball handling in the back
court on offense as a guard.
These two changes have been made mainly to make room for two
towering newcomers to the first string—Ed Voss, G ft. 6 in., and Jim Pol
lard, 6 ft. 5 in., who will next season be a junior and a sophomore re
spectively.

V/"OSS, with a year's experience as second string center last season, is fit
ting into that all important pivot post for next year's varsity. "Little
Eddie" has the height, the ability to rebound, and a good eye. His only
weakness is his lack of speed.
While Pollard to me has just about everything a basketball player
needs—height, a marvelous sense of timing on rebounds, deadly bul
let passing, an uncanny long, one-handed push shot, and plenty of
speed and drive for those fast breaks.
Sounds a little like describing one, Angelo '"Hank" Luisetti, doesn't it.
But every word is true ,and Oakland's Jim next year in varsity will es
tablish himself as the until now mythical "Second Luisetti."
Mr. Dean has Pollard playing a forward spot on both offense and de
fense. If Jim can get away from the tendency he acquired on last year's
freshman ball club and probably before that in high school when he was
head and shoulders above his team mates as a basketball player, away
from the tendency of playing by himself; he will be well nigh perfect.
