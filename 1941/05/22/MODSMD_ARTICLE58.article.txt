## 
### 
The freshmen and sophomores j
ended up in a 1-1 tie alter sixty
minutes of hard-fought soccer in
the third game of Ihe annual spring i
interclass soccer tournament. The
freshmen have been previously
beaten by the juniors, and the soph
omores have been beaten by the
seniors. This game was not sched- |
uled, but Harry Maloney, soccer
coach, agreed to have a grudge match j
between the two losers.
The freshman goal was punched
through in the second quarter by j

Bob Sol, a right inside from El Sal
vador. He received a pass from
Bud Woodward, the right wing, and
drove it through. Gabriel Davalos,
the inside right from Guadalajara,
Mexico, scored the sophomore goal.
It was scored on a long pass from
Shelly Parker, right wing.
Although the sophomores kept the
ball down in the freshman territory
much of the time, they could not
score. Many of the .shots were close,
but the sophomores could not follow
up quickly enough to tally
