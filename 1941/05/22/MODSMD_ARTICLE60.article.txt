LOOKING back over a 1941 calendar of stu
dent-sponsored forums which drew only
fractional audiences makes one wonder just
what sort of shot-in-the-arm would best boost
student attendance at these functions.
Three student forums were held this year in
Memorial Hall. First was the discussion of pres
idential candidates Roosevelt and Willkie im
mediately before the November trek to the
polls. Second was the discussion of student
participation in the draft and national defense.
Third was the recent debate where isolationist
verbally battled interventionist.
All three were on topics of keen local and
national interest. All of them represented con
siderable planning and work on the part of com
petent and interested student committees. And
all three of them drew down audiences repre
senting only a minor fraction of the student
body. The last, which was the best attended
of the three, attracted only 700 of an under
graduate population of 4,000.
What is the solution? It can hardly be the
choice of topic, for all three were of vital in
terest. Nor can it be either the location or the
student backers.
Apparently the fault lay with the time that
the forums were held. Evening sessions on
campus of any sort, regardless of what they are
or what they stand for, rarely pull a full house.
Even the Tuesday evening lecture series with
its splendid list of speakers does not attract
more than a relative handful.
Morning lectures at Memorial Hall always
bring in packed audiences. Perhaps it's con
venience, perhaps it's closeness, the fact re
mains that morning lectures never fail to bring
in a full audience.
I sincerely doubt if even Thomas Mann would
have spoken to more than a student handful at
an evening lecture.
One student - sponsored meeting is held
yearly in the morning at Memorial Hall—the
introduction of candidates for the spring quarter
elections. Three more student-sponsored morn
ing forums, held in Memorial Hall, could hardly
impose a tremendous burden on the academic
calendar.
All three of this year's student forums were
well worth while. They were of enough im
portance to warrant their inclusion on this year's
calendar of events.
If they were worth that they surely were
worth every bit of aid that would bring a repre
sentative audience.

terest. Nor can it be either the location or the
student backers.
Apparently the fault lay with the time that
the forums were held. Evening sessions on
campus of any sort, regardless of what they are
or what they stand for, rarely pull a full house.
Even the Tuesday evening lecture series with
its splendid list of speakers does not attract
more than a relative handful.
Morning lectures at Memorial Hall always
bring in packed audiences. Perhaps it's con
venience, perhaps it's closeness, the fact re
mains that morning lectures never fail to bring
in a full audience.
I sincerely doubt if even Thomas Mann would
have spoken to more than a student handful at
an evening lecture.
One student - sponsored meeting is held
yearly in the morning at Memorial Hall—the
introduction of candidates for the spring quarter
elections. Three more student-sponsored morn
ing forums, held in Memorial Hall, could hardly
impose a tremendous burden on the academic
calendar.
All three of this year's student forums were
well worth while. They were of enough im
portance to warrant their inclusion on this year's
calendar of events.
If they were worth that they surely were
worth every bit of aid that would bring a repre
sentative audience.
LOOKING back over a 1941 calendar of stu
dent-sponsored forums which drew only
fractional audiences makes one wonder just
what sort of shot-in-the-arm would best boost
student attendance at these functions.
Three student forums were held this year in
Memorial Hall. First was the discussion of pres
idential candidates Roosevelt and Willkie im
mediately before the November trek to the
polls. Second was the discussion of student
participation in the draft and national defense.
Third was the recent debate where isolationist
verbally battled interventionist.
All three were on topics of keen local and
national interest. All of them represented con
siderable planning and work on the part of com
petent and interested student committees. And
all three of them drew down audiences repre
senting only a minor fraction of the student
body. The last, which was the best attended
of the three, attracted only 700 of an under
graduate population of 4,000.
What is the solution? It can hardly be the
choice of topic, for all three were of vital in
terest. Nor can it be either the location or the
student backers.
