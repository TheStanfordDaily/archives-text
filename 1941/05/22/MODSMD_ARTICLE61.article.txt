SO frequently we forget those persons who
work silently behind the scenes. Too fre
quently plaudits and praise come as a result of
publicity.
We tend to forget the man who does his work
well but who doesn't care, doesn't even have
the time, to blow his trumpet.
So it has been with Harry Maloney. Every
body knows him, and everybody that knows
him likes him. He's the active, silver-haired
man over in the B.A.C. who tends the flocks
of "little-known" athletes and men who want
very much to "go out for some sport 4 but who
aren't very good at anything in particular."
He's Stanford's combination of Santa Claus and
Knute Rockne, the man who talks little and
toils much.
Somebody has at last, at long last, taken steps
to show Harry in some material sort of way
just how much Stanford loves him and appre
ciates what he has been doing, not for the mus
cleman who makes the tackles on Saturday, but
for the man with the borrowed tennis shoes
who reports with handball, or tennis racquet,
or badminton birds on Monday for a workout.
A week from this Saturday Stanford pays
tribute to our smiling Scot when it dedicates the
rugby field to his name—Harry Maloney.
"Maloney Field." That name will live as long

as Stanford. It will live long after Harry has
gone. How else, in what more material way
could we, can we, thank you, Harry? We don't
know.
This is our thanks. It's our thanks for your
perpetual smile, for your thousands of helping
hands, and for your goodnatured pushes. It's
the best way we know to thank you for your
direction of Stanford's minor sports for over 30
years now, and for bringing rugby to the Farm.
And, oh yes, we speak for the hundreds and
hundreds of boys to whom you have brought,
at your own time and expense, sporting fun
and direction. Do you remember the first 34
boys who joined your Boys' Club back in 1916?
Now, every Saturday, you have 187 youngsters
who flock to the gym to hear what you have to
say and to see what you have to do.
Twelve or twenty years old, you get along
with them all.
So thanks again, Harry. See you May 31 at—
Maloney Field.—B. A.

rugby field to his name—Harry Maloney.
"Maloney Field." That name will live as long

as Stanford. It will live long after Harry has
gone. How else, in what more material way
could we, can we, thank you, Harry? We don't
know.
This is our thanks. It's our thanks for your
perpetual smile, for your thousands of helping
hands, and for your goodnatured pushes. It's
the best way we know to thank you for your
direction of Stanford's minor sports for over 30
years now, and for bringing rugby to the Farm.
And, oh yes, we speak for the hundreds and
hundreds of boys to whom you have brought,
at your own time and expense, sporting fun
and direction. Do you remember the first 34
boys who joined your Boys' Club back in 1916?
Now, every Saturday, you have 187 youngsters
who flock to the gym to hear what you have to
say and to see what you have to do.
Twelve or twenty years old, you get along
with them all.
So thanks again, Harry. See you May 31 at—
Maloney Field.—B. A.
SO frequently we forget those persons who
work silently behind the scenes. Too fre
quently plaudits and praise come as a result of
publicity.
We tend to forget the man who does his work
well but who doesn't care, doesn't even have
the time, to blow his trumpet.
So it has been with Harry Maloney. Every
body knows him, and everybody that knows
him likes him. He's the active, silver-haired
man over in the B.A.C. who tends the flocks
of "little-known" athletes and men who want
very much to "go out for some sport 4 but who
aren't very good at anything in particular."
He's Stanford's combination of Santa Claus and
Knute Rockne, the man who talks little and
toils much.
Somebody has at last, at long last, taken steps
to show Harry in some material sort of way
just how much Stanford loves him and appre
ciates what he has been doing, not for the mus
cleman who makes the tackles on Saturday, but
for the man with the borrowed tennis shoes
who reports with handball, or tennis racquet,
or badminton birds on Monday for a workout.
A week from this Saturday Stanford pays
tribute to our smiling Scot when it dedicates the
rugby field to his name—Harry Maloney.
