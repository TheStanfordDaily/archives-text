### JERRY MAYER 
TIIE EYES OF TEXAS
AN INCIDENT of my early life has been recalled
to me by the tremendously conscientious effort I
am presently making to graduate from Stanford. I
want to insure my companionship with Dr. Wilbur at
Laurence Frost Amphitheater next month. Only last
week Dr. Wilbur addressed me in an interview at his
home. "I hope you graduate successfully in June," he
said. I nodded to the doctor. He and I have always
gotten along well. In fact, I might add, we're quite
close friends. "That will be all," he said.
With that 200 seniors and myself left the annual
senior get-together at the President's house.
But to get back on the original track, my careful
efforts to obtain that sheepskin brings to mind what I
thought was one of the most slovenly stage perform
ances I had ever seen.
♦ * # *
jJT ALL happened when I was a mere stripling in
junior high school. My parents were going on a
trip to New York City, but I had declined to accom
pany them, being a sensitive youth who had little
use for the gangsters who, according to the moving
pictures, inhabited every street corner of the eastern
metropolis. But at the last minute my elementary
arithmetic teacher announced an examination. I went
to New York with my parents.
The first day there my father and mother had busi
ness to attend to. They locked me in the room so I
wouldn't get into any trouble. (I had always been a
precocious youngster.) But I fooled them. I made a
rope by tearing the sheets on the beds into strips and
and lowered myself fifty-seven stories down to the
street. My impromptu rope would never have
reached if I hadn't used some pillow cases, also.)
* * * *
r r*HERE I was, a handsome, bronzed young son of
California wandering the streets of New York.
People turned to stare at me. They gazed in wonder
ment. Few of them had ever seen anything quite like
me. I climbed back up the sheet ladder to my room
and put on my pants.
I approached the box office of a theater and asked
for a ticket. "Sorry, bud, you're too young," the at
tendant informed me. The next time a large party
went to the box office I got in line behind them. The
attendant didn't remember me, and thought I was a
member of the party who was just too independent to
let any grown-ups buy me ticket.
Once inside I scattered to front-row seat. There
was a stage show going on. I was disappointed, the
marquis outside the theater said that a Texas Guinan
was going to be starred and I thought it was a cowboy
picture.
* * * *
HPHERE was a young girl up on the stage whipping a
lot of ostrich-feather fans all over the stage. I could
n't understand why the men on either side of me were so
interested. I was frankly bored.
And I was actually disgusted when the young girl
became so careless that occasionally you could see be
tween the fans. I turned to the occupants next to me.
It was a really slovenly performance. "Isn't that
terrible?" I said.
"It isn't good, bud," they admitted. I smiled in tri
umph. I considered myself a real critic of the American
theater.
The moral of my story is: Don't ever go to New
York. You get callouses on your hand sliding down
rope ladders.

me. I climbed back up the sheet ladder to my room
and put on my pants.
I approached the box office of a theater and asked
for a ticket. "Sorry, bud, you're too young," the at
tendant informed me. The next time a large party
went to the box office I got in line behind them. The
attendant didn't remember me, and thought I was a
member of the party who was just too independent to
let any grown-ups buy me ticket.
Once inside I scattered to front-row seat. There
was a stage show going on. I was disappointed, the
marquis outside the theater said that a Texas Guinan
was going to be starred and I thought it was a cowboy
picture.

HPHERE was a young girl up on the stage whipping a
lot of ostrich-feather fans all over the stage. I could
n't understand why the men on either side of me were so
interested. I was frankly bored.
And I was actually disgusted when the young girl
became so careless that occasionally you could see be
tween the fans. I turned to the occupants next to me.
It was a really slovenly performance. "Isn't that
terrible?" I said.
"It isn't good, bud," they admitted. I smiled in tri
umph. I considered myself a real critic of the American
theater.
The moral of my story is: Don't ever go to New
York. You get callouses on your hand sliding down
rope ladders.
TIIE EYES OF TEXAS
AN INCIDENT of my early life has been recalled
to me by the tremendously conscientious effort I
am presently making to graduate from Stanford. I
want to insure my companionship with Dr. Wilbur at
Laurence Frost Amphitheater next month. Only last
week Dr. Wilbur addressed me in an interview at his
home. "I hope you graduate successfully in June," he
said. I nodded to the doctor. He and I have always
gotten along well. In fact, I might add, we're quite
close friends. "That will be all," he said.
With that 200 seniors and myself left the annual
senior get-together at the President's house.
But to get back on the original track, my careful
efforts to obtain that sheepskin brings to mind what I
thought was one of the most slovenly stage perform
ances I had ever seen.

jJT ALL happened when I was a mere stripling in
junior high school. My parents were going on a
trip to New York City, but I had declined to accom
pany them, being a sensitive youth who had little
use for the gangsters who, according to the moving
pictures, inhabited every street corner of the eastern
metropolis. But at the last minute my elementary
arithmetic teacher announced an examination. I went
to New York with my parents.
The first day there my father and mother had busi
ness to attend to. They locked me in the room so I
wouldn't get into any trouble. (I had always been a
precocious youngster.) But I fooled them. I made a
rope by tearing the sheets on the beds into strips and
and lowered myself fifty-seven stories down to the
street. My impromptu rope would never have
reached if I hadn't used some pillow cases, also.)
