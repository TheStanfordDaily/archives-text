# CAMPUS OPINION
## FACTS, NOT FANFARE 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
A college degree is in part a reward for the com
mendable patience with which the student attends the
words of his instructors through four years of class
room lectures, and said student has better reason than
most to be grateful for a skillful and palatable pres
entation of subject matter. This long experience has
netted him little, however, if he has not likewise
learned to judge platform utterances dispassionately
and on the basis of substance alone.
This comment is inspired by my unfavorable re
action to the approach employed by Mr. Phleger in
his address before the student forum Monday evening
on the question of American participation in the war.
In my opinion his effort was directed more toward
winning the jury than presenting the facts of the case,
and the clever technique of the barrister seemed in
appropriate for the setting and the subject under con
sideration.
His opening (and oft repeated) reference to "my
good friend, Dr. Lee" would somehow have rung more
true if he had not then proceeded to becloud some of
the basic issues previously outlined by his opponents.
The inevitable "let those who want war go them
selves, but don't send 'our boys'," is always an unfail
ing device, and it was not long in coming. But Mr.
Phleger cannot seriously believe that those who urge
aid to the Allies (and this includes young and old
alike) are motivated by the selfish interests which this
would suggest. No less irrelevant was his statement
deploring our crass desire to "light for profits," if he
implies, as he did, that we fear a Nazi victory solely
because of its possible effects of the "gravy" of com
merce.
This and other derisive references, such as to the
"comfortable" war allegedly proposed by his opponents,
scarcely help the listener to evaluate accurately the
relative merits of the two conflicting points of view.
The sincere and widespread difference of opinion
on American intervention is in itself pretty good evi
dence that there are reasonably sound arguments on
both sides of the question. But forensic manipula
tion is not designed to help us arrive at the proper
choice of courses.
