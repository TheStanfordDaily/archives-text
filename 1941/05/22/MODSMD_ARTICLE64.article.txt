# Forgotten Operators on 9411 Handle Farm's Phone Calls
## 
### BILL STEIF 
What happens when you call the Farm's official phone number, 1)411?
First there's a little buzz and then you hear the prompt, courteous
feminine voice that says, "Stanford University" and you ask for your
party and proceed with your business. Everything seems in order as .you
go on about your phoning. Nothing unusual about it, is there?

"Of course not," you say and are'
about to step on.
But that's where you're wrong,
because you've ignored the forgot
ten women, the phone operator's.
FARM REGULARS
On the Stanford University tele
phone exchange are four regular
phone operators that work from 7:30
in the morning till 8 in the evening.
These four are sometimes augmented
by a fifth girl, but it is the four to
gether with Mrs. Elsie Hall, the ex
change head operator for the past 22
years who take care of the steady
flow of telephone calls that come into
Stanford day after day.
The exchange itself is located in a
nook in the back of the Administra
tion Building. It is what is known as
the "multiple switchboard" variety,
which in simple English means that
intra-university calls are made au
tomatically but that outgoing or in
ocming calls to the Farm are super
vised by the phone operators.

In Stanford's very early days the
telephone exchange was located in
what is how the post office building,
but with the advent of Uncle Sam's
Stanford mail service, the exchange
shifted into its present quarters.
Furthermore, it at one time served
all the campus, but with the growth
of the Farm, another exchange was
installed which now takes care of all
the dormitories except Sequoia. Se
quoia and all the academic buildings
—a total of about 500 locals—are on
the University Exchange.

FARM REGULARS
On the Stanford University tele
phone exchange are four regular
phone operators that work from 7:30
in the morning till 8 in the evening.
These four are sometimes augmented
by a fifth girl, but it is the four to
gether with Mrs. Elsie Hall, the ex
change head operator for the past 22
years who take care of the steady
flow of telephone calls that come into
Stanford day after day.
The exchange itself is located in a
nook in the back of the Administra
tion Building. It is what is known as
the "multiple switchboard" variety,
which in simple English means that
intra-university calls are made au
tomatically but that outgoing or in
ocming calls to the Farm are super
vised by the phone operators.
EXCHANGE MOVED
In Stanford's very early days the
telephone exchange was located in
what is how the post office building,
but with the advent of Uncle Sam's
Stanford mail service, the exchange
shifted into its present quarters.
Furthermore, it at one time served
all the campus, but with the growth
of the Farm, another exchange was
installed which now takes care of all
the dormitories except Sequoia. Se
quoia and all the academic buildings
—a total of about 500 locals—are on
the University Exchange.
