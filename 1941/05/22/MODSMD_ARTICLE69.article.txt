# Students Urged To Finish School
## 
### 
John W. Studebaker, U.S. Com
missioner of Education, in a bulle
tin addressed to all college and uni
versity presidents, urged students
who are training for occupations es
sential to national defense to remain
in college instead of enrolling in
short defense training courses.
The bulletin said, in part: "It
would be a mistake for a student who
is competent to complete a full col
lege course which is related closely
to defense to drop out of that course
and complete some short course in
order to engage in some industrial
employment or less than a full
professional level.
"The fifth obligation of college
students is to fit themselves for the
highest type of service; they should
not give up their chance to prepare
for their unique service in order to
render a service on a level which
can be rendered by a much larger
number of men and women.
