### 

PASSED BY GERMAN CENSORS, this picture shows glider training
given German youthâ€”a pilot gets final instructions from a soldier
before taking off. For the first time in the history of warfare, glider
borne soldiers were landed on the Island of Crete as Hitler made his
latest move in the battle for riches of the Mediterranean and Suez.
