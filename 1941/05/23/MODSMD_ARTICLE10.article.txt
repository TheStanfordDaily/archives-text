# Farm's Finances 'Stable'

### 
The luckiest and richest kid in
America—a veritable crown prince
from the rich new West—that's what
they called Leland Stanford, Jr., the
16-year-old heir to Senator Leland
Stanford's fortune, reputed to be
100 millions.
When the young son died in Flor
ence Italy, his famous father founded
Stanford University in his name and
endowed the newcomer to the Stan
ford Family with some $20,000,000.
This huge sum was one of the
first immense gifts to the public by
any of the late nineteenth century
millionaires.
Originally Stanford was a tuition
free university.
Tight Purse-Strings
And yet, the new Stanford strug
gled along with purse strines drawn
for nearly 10 years, the faculty often
graciously "forgetting" to collect pay
checks, for litigation with the fed
eral government clogged immediate
hope of remuneration.
Yet again the temblor of I°o£
leveled buildings and damaged Me
morial Arch, resultine in three
ouarters of a million dollars' recon
struction expenses and, added to
this initiatory headache, new World
War price levels and the subseauent
depressions have served to crease
the brow of more than one comp
troller.
Senator Stanford died June 21.
1893, this event wreaking havoc
with University affairs, for this was
the unfortunate era of the panic of
the nineties, bank failures were
driving executives out of their
minds, and railroad strikes and farm
foreclosures added to the general
confusion immediately preceding the
turn of the century.
Operating Expenses
For actual operating expenses,
which Senator Stanford requested
be held to a minimum, the yearling
institution was dependent unon in
come from its founder's business
holdings.
The entire Stanford estate, con
sisting largely of holdings in the old
Pacific Improvement Company and
its subsidiary railroads, was imme
diately tied up in probate court, with
$8,000,000 in debts and legacies to
be paid before any funds could be
released for University purposes,
but Mrs. Stanford was determined
to keep the University open.
The school continued when Mrs.
Stanford obtained a court ruling
allowing her $10,000 a month from
the earnings of the estate for her
peisonal maintenance and "serv
ants." At one time President David
Starr Jordan could be seen distrib
uting $20 gold pieces among the
faculty, to partially meet a two
months' delayed payroll. This was
paid for by forced sales of stock
farm equipment, race horses and
other property bringing in just
enough to keep the University alive.
Many Law Suits
Adding more distress, the fed
eral government on June 3, 1894, in
stituted a-suit against the estate for
$15,000,000, one-fourth of the prin
cipal, plus interest, of the govern

i ment's participation in financing the
Central Pacific Railroad.
After a year's delay, Mrs. Stan
ford traveled to Washington in April,
I 1895, to make a personal appeal to
President Grover Cleveland for a
hastened prosecution of the case, re
ceiving a promise from the Chief
Executive. On March 2, 1896, the
United States Supreme Court unani
mously upheld Mrs. Stanford's case
and brought the litigation to a wel
come end. Mrs. Stanford journeyed
the next year to London for Queen
Victoria's Jubilee, some believing
that the gracious lady wished to sell
her jewels. They were sold 10 years
later to provide the "Jewel Fund,"
which became the basic endowment
of the University's great library.
Mrs. Stanford's Death
Mrs. Stanford died in 1905, her
grants increasing the University's
original endowment to $21,000,000.
then the greatest in the United
States. But Stanford at the present
time ranks only tenth in endow
ment total.
Economically, the last quarter
century brought drastically in
creased demands upon operations
of the University. The wide in
crease in prices at the time of the
World War was a major problem,
coupled with the necessity of hiking
academic salaries and establishing a
faculty retirement system.
The problem was met partially
with the introduction in 1920 of a
tuition system, and its gradual in
crease, although Stanford's fees to
day rank below comparable Eastern
universities. At the same time,
while enrollment increased from
1,500 to the present average of 4,200,
the scholarship expenditures were
multiplied many times, thus making
it possible for many "ooor" men
and women to attend. Tuition this
year was raised $15 a quarter, to
meet declining retuins on invest
ments.
Gifts to Stanford now average
$2,000 a day, with more than 18,000
oersons listed as donors to the Uni
versity.
The story in figures of Stanford's
First Fifty Years is as follows:

In the annual Report of the Presi
dent for the forty-ninth academic !
year ending August 31, 1940, Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur states:
"Over recent years there has been
constantly growing difficulty in
maintaining the University at a
high level and in balancing the j
budget. The essential difficulty has j
been caused by various processes for
which the Board of Trustees have
no responsibility. The actual income
from endowment sources has de
creased about $300,000 per year. By
deferring payments on the building
fund, delaying certain amortizations,
by penalizing the faculty by salary
cuts, and by reducing departmental
and other activities we have been I

able to go ahead without an actual j
operating deficit. All reasonable sav
ings have been made and some ex- |
penditures that will eventually be
necessary have been delayed."
However, late in April Dr. Wilbur
told The Daily that the University
Ls in the best financial shape it has
ever been, and that all salaries have
been restored to the former pre
depression level. A 10 per cent cut
in all salaries was leveled May 1, !
1933, and two successive 5 per cent
restorations have been made since
that time, the latter this year.


THE HOME OF SENATOR AND MRS. STANFORD as it appeared in their lifetime. It has since been converted into
a convalescent home for needy children, generously supported by students and alumnae. Every spring quarter Stan
ford students devote a whole week to their annual Convalescent Home Drive to raise money for the home's upkeep.
This year Stanford contributed approximately $5,000. Several years ago a record contribution of $6,000 was pre
sented by the students. Senator and Mrs. Stanford were residing here when they decided to found the University
in memory of their deceased son.
