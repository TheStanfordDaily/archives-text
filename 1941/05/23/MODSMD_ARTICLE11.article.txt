# Hoover, '95, Most Noted Stanfordite
## 
### 
High on a Stanford foothill,
Wwegie, a Norwegian elkhound,
guards a deserted home. Silently
but desperately, his master, Herbert
Hoover, '95, only living ex-President
of the United States, is battling in
Washington for a plan to feed the
starving peoples of Europe.
Nearly penniless, Hoover came to
Stanford in 1891, the days of free
tuition. Even so, the orphaned boy
from lowa had to earn his room and
board. A member of the pioneer
class, he organized and managed the
first Public Exercise Committee. In
Palo Alto he obtained a job keeping
accounts for a laundry. Later he was
awarded a teaching assistantship in
the department of mining engineer
ing.
Hoover Arrived Early
Because he came to Stanford early
to make up courses, Hoover was the
first freshman to sleep in Encina.
Biggest fly in the soup of Hoover's
Stanford career were his English
courses. He hated punctuation and
tried in vain to understand the logic
of formal sentence construction. Be
fore he could graduate, he had to
study fiendishly to pass English
exams.
Graduating with $40 in his pocket,
Hoover set out to find an engineer
ing job in the Bay Region. Luckless
in his search for white collar work,
he resorted to pushing a wheelbarrow
through an ore mine in the foothills
of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
He soon left the ore mine to take
a typing job for one of the best engi
neers in San Francisco. One day he
had to type a report on a mine that
he had surveyed during his under
graduate years at Stanford. Noting
certain deficiencies in the report, he
volunteered his information to the
author. The engineer was so pleased
with Hoover's intelligent observa
tions that he recommended him for
his first important job.
Crew Beard
When Hoover was called to take
an engineering job in Australia, he
looked so young that his employers
persuaded him to grow a beard to
make him appear older. After he
had accumulated a considerable sum
of money in Australia, he was offered
a job in China. This suited him per
fectly because he was engaged to
the future Mrs. Hoover and Aus
tralia was no place for women. The
terrific heat and bad water made the
South Pacific island continent tough
going even for the men.
His new work as director-general
of Chinese mines lasted only a shorl
time before the outbreak of the j
Boxer Rebellion. Mrs. Hoover might I

have lived a more peaceful life in
Australia, because she had to pitch
right in with the natives nursing the
injured and helping fortify towns.
Glad for a change, the Hoovers
soon afterward sailed for London
where Mr. Hoover became a partner
in a famous mining firm which doc
tored sick mines in Burma, South
Africa, and Russia. Both of the
Hoover boys were born in London,
where they were immediately regis
tered as American citizens. Before
the war, the Hoover home in London
orovided a continual open house for
Stanford graduates who were tour
ing Europe.
Summers on Farm
Every summer the Hoovers came
back to America and took a house
in the hills around Stanford. Both of
them dreamed of settling permanent
ly at Stanford someday. Mrs. Hoover
used to tramp the hills searching for
the site with the best view of the
campus and countryside. Her choice
is the lot of the present Hoover Home.
Soon after their return to London
in 1914 the war broke out. Hoover
was called to the consulate to help
evacuate hundreds of American tour
ists who were stranded in London
without money. He loaned them
money out of his own pocket and
got most of it back later.
Then the Belgians started trickling
in and Hoover learned of their tragic
food plight. When he proposed his
food relief plan, the British govern
ment promptly denounced it. But
Woodrow Wilson supported him and
Hoover executed the plan with the
amazing efficiency for which he has
gone down in history.
He was the only man allowed to
cross the front line trenches into
Brussels, Berlin, and Amsterdam
with diplomatic immunity. The tech

nical problems of the relief work
were innumerable. The Germans
fumed at the importation of food in
tin cans because they feared that the
tin would be used for British bullets
so Hoover had to promise to collect
all cans after use. Back and forth
he traveled, making miniature treat
ies with the German government and
securing approval from the British
government.
Built Local Home
When the United States entered
the war, Wilson asked Hoover to ad
minister American food supplies, so
he left the Belgian relief to the
Rhodes scholars who were his as
sistants. After the war, Hoover saw
to it that all Europe was fed in his
capacity as head of the supreme Eco
nomic Council.
In 1920, Hoover built the tree
hidden house at Stanford which he
calls home between trips to Wash
ington. There Mrs. Hoover enter
tains girls from Roble, Lagunita, and
Union at coffee parties after dinner
before they return to their studies.

HOOVER, Class of
1 895, is the only liv
ing ex - President of
the United States. Do
nor of the material
contained in the Hoo
ver Library of War,
Revolution, and Peace,
he is at present in
Washington attempt
ing to organize Euro
pean war relief.
High on a Stanford foothill,
Wwegie, a Norwegian elkhound,
guards a deserted home. Silently
but desperately, his master, Herbert
Hoover, '95, only living ex-President
of the United States, is battling in
Washington for a plan to feed the
starving peoples of Europe.
Nearly penniless, Hoover came to
Stanford in 1891, the days of free
tuition. Even so, the orphaned boy
from lowa had to earn his room and
board. A member of the pioneer
class, he organized and managed the
first Public Exercise Committee. In
Palo Alto he obtained a job keeping
accounts for a laundry. Later he was
awarded a teaching assistantship in
the department of mining engineer
ing.
Hoover Arrived Early
Because he came to Stanford early
to make up courses, Hoover was the
first freshman to sleep in Encina.
Biggest fly in the soup of Hoover's
Stanford career were his English
courses. He hated punctuation and
tried in vain to understand the logic
of formal sentence construction. Be
fore he could graduate, he had to
study fiendishly to pass English
exams.
Graduating with $40 in his pocket,
Hoover set out to find an engineer
ing job in the Bay Region. Luckless
in his search for white collar work,
he resorted to pushing a wheelbarrow
through an ore mine in the foothills
of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
He soon left the ore mine to take
a typing job for one of the best engi
neers in San Francisco. One day he
had to type a report on a mine that
he had surveyed during his under
graduate years at Stanford. Noting
certain deficiencies in the report, he
volunteered his information to the
author. The engineer was so pleased
with Hoover's intelligent observa
tions that he recommended him for
his first important job.
Crew Beard
When Hoover was called to take
an engineering job in Australia, he
looked so young that his employers
persuaded him to grow a beard to
make him appear older. After he
had accumulated a considerable sum
of money in Australia, he was offered
a job in China. This suited him per
fectly because he was engaged to
the future Mrs. Hoover and Aus
tralia was no place for women. The
terrific heat and bad water made the
South Pacific island continent tough
going even for the men.
His new work as director-general
of Chinese mines lasted only a shorl
time before the outbreak of the j
Boxer Rebellion. Mrs. Hoover might I

have lived a more peaceful life in
Australia, because she had to pitch
right in with the natives nursing the
injured and helping fortify towns.
Glad for a change, the Hoovers
soon afterward sailed for London
where Mr. Hoover became a partner
in a famous mining firm which doc
tored sick mines in Burma, South
Africa, and Russia. Both of the
Hoover boys were born in London,
where they were immediately regis
tered as American citizens. Before
the war, the Hoover home in London
orovided a continual open house for
Stanford graduates who were tour
ing Europe.
Summers on Farm
Every summer the Hoovers came
back to America and took a house
in the hills around Stanford. Both of
them dreamed of settling permanent
ly at Stanford someday. Mrs. Hoover
used to tramp the hills searching for
the site with the best view of the
campus and countryside. Her choice
is the lot of the present Hoover Home.
Soon after their return to London
in 1914 the war broke out. Hoover
was called to the consulate to help
evacuate hundreds of American tour
ists who were stranded in London
without money. He loaned them
money out of his own pocket and
got most of it back later.
Then the Belgians started trickling
in and Hoover learned of their tragic
food plight. When he proposed his
food relief plan, the British govern
ment promptly denounced it. But
Woodrow Wilson supported him and
Hoover executed the plan with the
amazing efficiency for which he has
gone down in history.
He was the only man allowed to
cross the front line trenches into
Brussels, Berlin, and Amsterdam
with diplomatic immunity. The tech

nical problems of the relief work
were innumerable. The Germans
fumed at the importation of food in
tin cans because they feared that the
tin would be used for British bullets
so Hoover had to promise to collect
all cans after use. Back and forth
he traveled, making miniature treat
ies with the German government and
securing approval from the British
government.
Built Local Home
When the United States entered
the war, Wilson asked Hoover to ad
minister American food supplies, so
he left the Belgian relief to the
Rhodes scholars who were his as
sistants. After the war, Hoover saw
to it that all Europe was fed in his
capacity as head of the supreme Eco
nomic Council.
In 1920, Hoover built the tree
hidden house at Stanford which he
calls home between trips to Wash
ington. There Mrs. Hoover enter
tains girls from Roble, Lagunita, and
Union at coffee parties after dinner
before they return to their studies.

HERBERT CLARK
HOOVER, Class of
1 895, is the only liv
ing ex - President of
the United States. Do
nor of the material
contained in the Hoo
ver Library of War,
Revolution, and Peace,
he is at present in
Washington attempt
ing to organize Euro
pean war relief.
High on a Stanford foothill,
Wwegie, a Norwegian elkhound,
guards a deserted home. Silently
but desperately, his master, Herbert
Hoover, '95, only living ex-President
of the United States, is battling in
Washington for a plan to feed the
starving peoples of Europe.
Nearly penniless, Hoover came to
Stanford in 1891, the days of free
tuition. Even so, the orphaned boy
from lowa had to earn his room and
board. A member of the pioneer
class, he organized and managed the
first Public Exercise Committee. In
Palo Alto he obtained a job keeping
accounts for a laundry. Later he was
awarded a teaching assistantship in
the department of mining engineer
ing.
Hoover Arrived Early
Because he came to Stanford early
to make up courses, Hoover was the
first freshman to sleep in Encina.
Biggest fly in the soup of Hoover's
Stanford career were his English
courses. He hated punctuation and
tried in vain to understand the logic
of formal sentence construction. Be
fore he could graduate, he had to
study fiendishly to pass English
exams.
Graduating with $40 in his pocket,
Hoover set out to find an engineer
ing job in the Bay Region. Luckless
in his search for white collar work,
he resorted to pushing a wheelbarrow
through an ore mine in the foothills
of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
He soon left the ore mine to take
a typing job for one of the best engi
neers in San Francisco. One day he
had to type a report on a mine that
he had surveyed during his under
graduate years at Stanford. Noting
certain deficiencies in the report, he
volunteered his information to the
author. The engineer was so pleased
with Hoover's intelligent observa
tions that he recommended him for
his first important job.
Crew Beard
When Hoover was called to take
an engineering job in Australia, he
looked so young that his employers
persuaded him to grow a beard to
make him appear older. After he
had accumulated a considerable sum
of money in Australia, he was offered
a job in China. This suited him per
fectly because he was engaged to
the future Mrs. Hoover and Aus
tralia was no place for women. The
terrific heat and bad water made the
South Pacific island continent tough
going even for the men.
His new work as director-general
of Chinese mines lasted only a shorl
time before the outbreak of the j
Boxer Rebellion. Mrs. Hoover might I

have lived a more peaceful life in
Australia, because she had to pitch
right in with the natives nursing the
injured and helping fortify towns.
Glad for a change, the Hoovers
soon afterward sailed for London
where Mr. Hoover became a partner
in a famous mining firm which doc
tored sick mines in Burma, South
Africa, and Russia. Both of the
Hoover boys were born in London,
where they were immediately regis
tered as American citizens. Before
the war, the Hoover home in London
orovided a continual open house for
Stanford graduates who were tour
ing Europe.
Summers on Farm
Every summer the Hoovers came
back to America and took a house
in the hills around Stanford. Both of
them dreamed of settling permanent
ly at Stanford someday. Mrs. Hoover
used to tramp the hills searching for
the site with the best view of the
campus and countryside. Her choice
is the lot of the present Hoover Home.
Soon after their return to London
in 1914 the war broke out. Hoover
was called to the consulate to help
evacuate hundreds of American tour
ists who were stranded in London
without money. He loaned them
money out of his own pocket and
got most of it back later.
Then the Belgians started trickling
in and Hoover learned of their tragic
food plight. When he proposed his
food relief plan, the British govern
ment promptly denounced it. But
Woodrow Wilson supported him and
Hoover executed the plan with the
amazing efficiency for which he has
gone down in history.
He was the only man allowed to
cross the front line trenches into
Brussels, Berlin, and Amsterdam
with diplomatic immunity. The tech

nical problems of the relief work
were innumerable. The Germans
fumed at the importation of food in
tin cans because they feared that the
tin would be used for British bullets
so Hoover had to promise to collect
all cans after use. Back and forth
he traveled, making miniature treat
ies with the German government and
securing approval from the British
government.
Built Local Home
When the United States entered
the war, Wilson asked Hoover to ad
minister American food supplies, so
he left the Belgian relief to the
Rhodes scholars who were his as
sistants. After the war, Hoover saw
to it that all Europe was fed in his
capacity as head of the supreme Eco
nomic Council.

When the United States entered
the war, Wilson asked Hoover to ad
minister American food supplies, so
he left the Belgian relief to the
Rhodes scholars who were his as
sistants. After the war, Hoover saw
to it that all Europe was fed in his
capacity as head of the supreme Eco
nomic Council.
In 1920, Hoover built the tree
hidden house at Stanford which he
calls home between trips to Wash
ington. There Mrs. Hoover enter
tains girls from Roble, Lagunita, and
Union at coffee parties after dinner
before they return to their studies.
