# 50 Yearsâ€”so Living Groups
## 
### 
In 1891 those first registrants at<
Stanford who came to Encina found
the place strangely eerie. It was
bright and new, but at night those
candles threw ghastly shadows.
Roble, the only other living group
on campus, was also candlelit. Added
to this minor discomfort was the fact
that the building itself was tem
porary . The last dab of cement was
slapped on only a few minutes be
fore the first occupant stepped over
the threshold.
These conditions are in sharp con
trast to the present living-group
set-up at Stanford. Squatting neatly
on Lasuen and its tributaries are
24 fraternities and nine sororities.
Farther-flung, but even more mod
ern, are the men's halls, Toyon and
Branner, and the women's halls,
Lagunita and Roble. Old Encina still
stands, a memorial to those first pio
neers, one of whom wrote home, "our
big dormitory . . . resembles a first
class hotel."
Co-op Housing Plan
The last quotation is unparalleled
in current correspondence emanating
from Encina.
The only radical tendency to crop
out in re Stanford living groups
occurred this year when 14 men on
the campus banded together and
on March 31 moved into a nine
room house on Alvarado, thus es
tablishing the first official co-opera
tive living group in the history of
the University.
The Co-op house is the result of
a year's crusading by students, pro
fessors, and members of the Palo
Alto Consumers' Co-op. Russ Cur
tis. Dick MacCann and Mac Wynne
led the local movement.
With borrowed furniture, tenta
tive administration approval, and
shoestring finances, the Co-op is es
tablished. In another fifty years the
final verdict on its success should be
ready.
Other Hall Units
In addition to the larger women's
hall units already named, are Ma
drono, Mariposa, Elm, Hawthorne,
the Union and The Oaks. The latter
house was formerly the home of the

E. Roths and was recently
adopted by the University as an
other women's living group.
Other men's halls are Sequoia and
The Arms, an informal group slightly
off campus.
At present there are 705 women
living in halls on the campus, while
253 reside in sororities. Women liv
ing off-campus or in private homes
on the campus number 160.
There are 870 hall men and 669
who are tagged "Greeks." Off-cam
pus men number about 1,021.
Lagunita Court is the newest ad
dition to the campus living group
scene. Opened on October 1, 1934,
the luxurious spaciousness of the
Court was spellbinding to students
returning to the Farm that fall quar
ter. This reaction is attested to by
the September 20 edition of The
Daily in 1934. The reporters couldn't
believe their eyes.
Fraternities Named
The fraternities which have estab
lished chapters on the Stanford cam
pus are Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Kap
pa Lambda, Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha
Tau Omega, Beta Theta Pi, Chi Psi,
Delta Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon,
Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi
Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi
Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma
Nu, Theta Chi, Theta Delta Chi,
Theta Xi, and Zeta Psi.
Although in the minority, as com
pared with the extension of the
Greek sphere of influence through
the fraternities, sororities number
nine. They are Alpha Omicron Pi,
Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta
Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi
Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
Improvements in the houses have
been many and, in the main, have
been directed at simple, almost se
vere, modernity. All but a few of
the graceful buildings lining Stan
ford's picturesque Lasuen have been
rebuilt to some extent. Replacing
the old shingled style, most of the
houses are now white, either low
slung or colonial style.
At present writing the only houses
on Lasuen to preserve the old
fashioned shingles, once so promi
nent on the Row, are Pi Phi, Gamma
Phi Beta, and Kappa Alpha Theta.
And this summer Gamma Phi ex
pects to succumb to the modern in
fluence when their new house is
built.
Off Lasuen, the new and the old
are on more equal footing. There
are as many old-vintage architec
tures in evidence as remodeled jobs.
The Board of Trustees dealt only
once with the Row during 1940.
Their action is embodied in the
following resolution: "that here
after it shall be the policy of this
Board to limit its repurchase liability
in fraternity and sorority leases to
a maximum of $15,000."
In all, the living groups on cam
pus appear to be adequate, although
the emergence of a co-operative
movement at Stanford may be in
dicative of a later, more widespread
adoption of the system.

Farther-flung, but even more mod
ern, are the men's halls, Toyon and
Branner, and the women's halls,
Lagunita and Roble. Old Encina still
stands, a memorial to those first pio
neers, one of whom wrote home, "our
big dormitory . . . resembles a first
class hotel."
Co-op Housing Plan
The last quotation is unparalleled
in current correspondence emanating
from Encina.
The only radical tendency to crop
out in re Stanford living groups
occurred this year when 14 men on
the campus banded together and
on March 31 moved into a nine
room house on Alvarado, thus es
tablishing the first official co-opera
tive living group in the history of
the University.
The Co-op house is the result of
a year's crusading by students, pro
fessors, and members of the Palo
Alto Consumers' Co-op. Russ Cur
tis. Dick MacCann and Mac Wynne
led the local movement.
With borrowed furniture, tenta
tive administration approval, and
shoestring finances, the Co-op is es
tablished. In another fifty years the
final verdict on its success should be
ready.
Other Hall Units
In addition to the larger women's
hall units already named, are Ma
drono, Mariposa, Elm, Hawthorne,
the Union and The Oaks. The latter
house was formerly the home of the

E. Roths and was recently
adopted by the University as an
other women's living group.
Other men's halls are Sequoia and
The Arms, an informal group slightly
off campus.
At present there are 705 women
living in halls on the campus, while
253 reside in sororities. Women liv
ing off-campus or in private homes
on the campus number 160.
There are 870 hall men and 669
who are tagged "Greeks." Off-cam
pus men number about 1,021.
Lagunita Court is the newest ad
dition to the campus living group
scene. Opened on October 1, 1934,
the luxurious spaciousness of the
Court was spellbinding to students
returning to the Farm that fall quar
ter. This reaction is attested to by
the September 20 edition of The
Daily in 1934. The reporters couldn't
believe their eyes.
Fraternities Named
The fraternities which have estab
lished chapters on the Stanford cam
pus are Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Kap
pa Lambda, Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha
Tau Omega, Beta Theta Pi, Chi Psi,
Delta Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon,
Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi
Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi
Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma
Nu, Theta Chi, Theta Delta Chi,
Theta Xi, and Zeta Psi.
Although in the minority, as com
pared with the extension of the
Greek sphere of influence through
the fraternities, sororities number
nine. They are Alpha Omicron Pi,
Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta
Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi
Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
Improvements in the houses have
been many and, in the main, have
been directed at simple, almost se
vere, modernity. All but a few of
the graceful buildings lining Stan
ford's picturesque Lasuen have been
rebuilt to some extent. Replacing
the old shingled style, most of the
houses are now white, either low
slung or colonial style.
At present writing the only houses
on Lasuen to preserve the old
fashioned shingles, once so promi
nent on the Row, are Pi Phi, Gamma
Phi Beta, and Kappa Alpha Theta.
And this summer Gamma Phi ex
pects to succumb to the modern in
fluence when their new house is
built.
Off Lasuen, the new and the old
are on more equal footing. There
are as many old-vintage architec
tures in evidence as remodeled jobs.
The Board of Trustees dealt only
once with the Row during 1940.
Their action is embodied in the
following resolution: "that here
after it shall be the policy of this
Board to limit its repurchase liability
in fraternity and sorority leases to
a maximum of $15,000."
In all, the living groups on cam
pus appear to be adequate, although
the emergence of a co-operative
movement at Stanford may be in
dicative of a later, more widespread
adoption of the system.
In 1891 those first registrants at<
Stanford who came to Encina found
the place strangely eerie. It was
bright and new, but at night those
candles threw ghastly shadows.
Roble, the only other living group
on campus, was also candlelit. Added
to this minor discomfort was the fact
that the building itself was tem
porary . The last dab of cement was
slapped on only a few minutes be
fore the first occupant stepped over
the threshold.
These conditions are in sharp con
trast to the present living-group
set-up at Stanford. Squatting neatly
on Lasuen and its tributaries are
24 fraternities and nine sororities.
Farther-flung, but even more mod
ern, are the men's halls, Toyon and
Branner, and the women's halls,
Lagunita and Roble. Old Encina still

tablishing the first official co-opera
tive living group in the history of
the University.
The Co-op house is the result of
a year's crusading by students, pro
fessors, and members of the Palo
Alto Consumers' Co-op. Russ Cur
tis. Dick MacCann and Mac Wynne
led the local movement.
With borrowed furniture, tenta
tive administration approval, and
shoestring finances, the Co-op is es
tablished. In another fifty years the
final verdict on its success should be
ready.
Other Hall Units
In addition to the larger women's
hall units already named, are Ma
drono, Mariposa, Elm, Hawthorne,
the Union and The Oaks. The latter
house was formerly the home of the

E. Roths and was recently
adopted by the University as an
other women's living group.
Other men's halls are Sequoia and
The Arms, an informal group slightly
off campus.
At present there are 705 women
living in halls on the campus, while
253 reside in sororities. Women liv
ing off-campus or in private homes
on the campus number 160.
There are 870 hall men and 669
who are tagged "Greeks." Off-cam
pus men number about 1,021.
Lagunita Court is the newest ad
dition to the campus living group
scene. Opened on October 1, 1934,
the luxurious spaciousness of the
Court was spellbinding to students
returning to the Farm that fall quar
ter. This reaction is attested to by
the September 20 edition of The
Daily in 1934. The reporters couldn't
believe their eyes.
Fraternities Named
The fraternities which have estab
lished chapters on the Stanford cam
pus are Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Kap
pa Lambda, Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha
Tau Omega, Beta Theta Pi, Chi Psi,
Delta Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon,
Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi
Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi
Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma
Nu, Theta Chi, Theta Delta Chi,
Theta Xi, and Zeta Psi.
Although in the minority, as com
pared with the extension of the
Greek sphere of influence through
the fraternities, sororities number
nine. They are Alpha Omicron Pi,
Alpha Phi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta
Delta, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi
Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
Improvements in the houses have
been many and, in the main, have
been directed at simple, almost se
vere, modernity. All but a few of
the graceful buildings lining Stan
ford's picturesque Lasuen have been
rebuilt to some extent. Replacing
the old shingled style, most of the
houses are now white, either low
slung or colonial style.
In 1891 those first registrants at<
Stanford who came to Encina found
the place strangely eerie. It was
bright and new, but at night those
candles threw ghastly shadows.
Roble, the only other living group
on campus, was also candlelit. Added
to this minor discomfort was the fact
that the building itself was tem
porary . The last dab of cement was
slapped on only a few minutes be
fore the first occupant stepped over
the threshold.
These conditions are in sharp con
trast to the present living-group
set-up at Stanford. Squatting neatly
on Lasuen and its tributaries are
24 fraternities and nine sororities.
Farther-flung, but even more mod
ern, are the men's halls, Toyon and
Branner, and the women's halls,
Lagunita and Roble. Old Encina still
stands, a memorial to those first pio
neers, one of whom wrote home, "our
big dormitory . . . resembles a first
class hotel."
Co-op Housing Plan
The last quotation is unparalleled
in current correspondence emanating
from Encina.
The only radical tendency to crop
out in re Stanford living groups
occurred this year when 14 men on
the campus banded together and
on March 31 moved into a nine

At present writing the only houses
on Lasuen to preserve the old

And this summer Gamma Phi ex

built.
Off Lasuen, the new and the old
are on more equal footing. There
are as many old-vintage architec
tures in evidence as remodeled jobs.
The Board of Trustees dealt only
once with the Row during 1940.
Their action is embodied in the
following resolution: "that here
after it shall be the policy of this
Board to limit its repurchase liability
in fraternity and sorority leases to
a maximum of $15,000."
In all, the living groups on cam

the emergence of a co-operative
