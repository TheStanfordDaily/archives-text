# Eating Clubs Open, '12
## 
### 
Stanford's seven eating clubs, in
surance of continued democracy on
the Farm, were not organized, as is
popularly believed, as a revolt against
the fraternity system. Rather their
motive was more primitive—the urge
to eat.
Specifically the clubs are known
as Breakers, El Campo, El Toro—the
strictly independent organizations;
and Los Arcos, El Capitan, El Cuad
ro, El Tigre—serving meals from the
kitchens of the commons.
In the beginning men and women,
students and faculty, were fed in
what is now Encina lobby. But diffi
culties were many, and when even
efforts of famous restaurateur John
Tate failed. University-operated din
ing halls were given up as a bad job.
Private Dining Halls
But students had to be fed as well
as educated, and so concessions were
granted private concerns for dining
halls in Roble, Sequoia, Madrono,
and "The Inn" (R.O.T.C. barracks).
One by one these fell into hands
of a Japanese outfit which served
food surprisingly bad. Three times a
day, thereafter, males migrated down
a mile of dusty road to boarding
houses at College Terrace.
By 1909 there had emerged out of
these pilgrimages four groups, each
with its own dining hall, its own
cook. Earliest was the Coyote Club,
which tamed into Breakers when it
moved to the campus.
Student demand for campus eating
houses (championed by A.S.S.U.
President Almon E. Roth) moved
Alumni Association in 1911 to pro
pose the Administration's financing
club-buildings for the College Tor
race.
Plea Refused
Wary of directing any more dining
halls, Board of Trustees refused.
Whereupon three of its members,
Newton Cleaveland, George Croth
ers, and Dennis Searles stepped forth
with $9,000 worth of 1 oan. Asso
ciated Students came through with
another thousand.
Provision of the loans stipulated
that after the principle had been paid
back by rents collected from the
clubs, the buildings would automati
cally become University property. |
That is why today the clubs still pay
rent to the Administration even \
though the last of the original loans
was paid in 1930.
Ready for occupancy in Septem
ber, 1912, were three buildings de
signed by Stanfordman William
Knowles and situated around the
"Little Quad" near Toyon Hall.
Independents Start
Promptly three of the College Ter
race groups moved in, legalized
themselves to the University under
the names of Breakers, El Campo.
and El Toro.
For several years eating club tra

♦dition set aside the last Sunday ir
June for the seniors and faculty
guests of the three groups to come
together, lunch, and lay memorial
plaques in their own Little Quad.
When the Commons opened in
1923 it provided dining halls for foui
more clubs. Among the new groups
which then organized came Los Ar
cos, the last of the College Terrace
clubs.
Today club members eat at the
conventional hours of 12:15 o'clock
and 6:15 o'clock, confer at Monday
night confabs, glad-hand rushees,
and dance in select off-campus spots
much in the manner of their Greek
friends up the Row.
No Regulations
For eating clubs the rushing sea
son is always open with no restric
tions. Membership is binding by
gentlemen's agreement. No con
tract prevents a man from switch
ing clubs or joining a fraternity.
Clubmen, however, seldom seek to
sever ties. No case has been recorded
of a member switching clubs.
Interclub Council was formed in
193'! to promote social intercourse
among the eating groups. Although
in its early years the Council was
only mildly successful in organizing
the clubs, it has in recent years blos
somed out as a full-fledged political
unit which every year selects the
Halls' official slate for elections. Dick
MeyerhofT. El Tigre, is the retiring
Interclub Council president. He will
be replaced next year by John Ran
dall of Sequoia Hall.


THE ENGRAVING to the
left shows, looking north
ward, S.P.'s depot, the
Circle, and, in the dis
tance, the tree.

TO THE RIGHT is defi
nite proof that there used
to be two Palo Alto trees.
However, one of these
has since died.

THE ABOVE ENGRAVINGS depict scenes that are absolutely foreign to the experience of the modern Stanford
University student. But progress cannot be stopped. The Circle today, since the construction of the Underpass,
is not the same as it was when the present Class of '41 entered the University. The rickety old railway station
has also passed, one of the last memories of the "good old days." Now Palo Alto has a modern, streamlined station
to welcome its inconrng St^nfordites.
