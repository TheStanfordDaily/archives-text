# Scholar Edits Lit Research
## 
### 
The first collection of literary and
linguistic scholarship in the Uni
versity's history was published late
in April by the School of Letters.
The book contains scholastic ar
ticles by 26 men and women who
are either connected with Stanford
now or who were at one time either
as undergraduate or graduate stu
dents.
Titled "Stanford Studies in Lan
guage and Literature," the book is
"an attempt on the part fo the School
of Letters to issue a volume of
selected studies on the occasion of
the Fiftieth Anniversary," according
to Dr. Hardin Craig, professor emer
itus of English, who edited the book.
Walter Clyde Curry, Arthur C.
Hicks, Harvey Eagleson, Charlton G.
Laird, and Merrel D. Chubb are
represented.
The most interesting of the ar
ticles is "Three Articles from the
Pen of Charles Kingsley," by Ruth
Estelle Mathews. Miss Mathews
discovered three hitherto unknown
ariteles by Kingsley.
