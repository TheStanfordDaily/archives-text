# Farm Boasts Student Fire Department

### 
Another distinction claimed by
Stanford is its student fire depart
ment —the only University in the na
tion to have one.
Since the University's founding,
the campus' 8,800 acres of homes,
dormitories, and school buildings
have been protected by Stanford's
own fire-fighting organization.
The distinction of being the only
university fire department whose
personnel is composed almost en
tirely of students, was earned in
1932 when regulars were replaced by
students.
Progress of Department
The department has progressed
with the years, for no longer are
alarms answered by horse-drawn
engines. The department now pos
sesses four trucks; a water engine,
ladder truck, and two water wagons.
A drill tower, five stories high,
stands beside the firehouse, and stu
dent firemen practice rescues, tower
diving, and pom pier ladder drills.
An alarm reporting system sounds
the warnings in the house from a
network of alarm boxes located
throughout the campus.
In charge of the department is
Chief R. E. Dugan, head man for 18
years. Gruff, but beloved by his
men, "The Chief" has ably super
vised the force, teaching fire-fight
ing methods to each new man, and
is a great influence in the lives of his
student force.
Other Non-Students
The only other members who are
not students are two regular cap
tains, who assist Chief Dugan. The
remainder of the personnel is com
posed of two lieutenants and eleven
hosemen.
The force, except the chief, lives in
the quarters above the station. Fire

boots and clothing are set beside
each bed at night ready for an
alarm. When these alarm bells ring
; out the quiet of the night is quickly
| shattered. The first four men ready
start the trucks and as they roll out
of the firehouse the rest of the crew
jumps on. The trucks roar through
j the campus to the origin of the
| alarm, where the firefighters prepare
I for action.
Depending on the location of the
I alarm, the entire process takes from

two to four minutes. In a recent j
alarm at Encina Hall, the call was
| answered in two minutes.
Further testimonial to the depart
ment's efficiency is the fact that no
serious fire has occurred on campus
i in the last six years.
To the student crew the firehouse
is more than a place to sleep and a
•'ob paying $20 a month, for it is one
j of the closest knit living groups on
| campus.
Every member of the crew earns

most of his school expenses, and all
hash for board. Some are mechanics,
barbers, car-washers, and office
workers.
For the second straight year the
firehouse has won the University in
tramural football championship. In
addition, runner-up laurels in track
and softball have been garnered.
Scholastically, the students are far
above the campus average, claiming
a plus 16 average for the entire
group.


STANFORD STADIUM, finished in 1921, is the third largest football arena on the Pacific Coast. Only California and the University of Southern California
have larger stadiums. Although Stanford Stadium held but 60,000 persons when it was first built, alterations in 1925 and again in 1927 brought its
capacity up to the present total of 87,000.
