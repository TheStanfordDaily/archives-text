# FARM PARTLY REBUILT AFTER '06 QUAKE
## 
### 
At 5:13 o'clock in the morning of
Wednesday. April 18. 1906, the great
San Andreas earthquake fault in
back of Stanford campus stretched
and yawned. Then it shuddered.
For 47 terrifying seconds the cam
pus and San Francisco rocked diz
zily, and in those 47 seconds na
ture's worst West Coast earthquake
tumbled buildings to the ground and
wrought $2,000,000 worth of almost
instantaneous disaster.
The damage was appalling.
Fortunately, classes were not in
session and only two lives were lost
—two men were killed by falling
chimneys. One was Otto Gerdes,
fireman, who was in the powerhouse,
and was caught by the great stone
chimney which had snapped off as
he came running out. Junius R.
Hanna, a student from Bradford,
Penn., was in the path of one of the
Encina chimneys which broke
through the four floors below it and
landed in the basement. Four other
students, also carried into the base
ment, were injured.
Church Wrecked
The interior of Memorial Church
was wrecked by the fall of the tower
and the heavy flying buttresses, and
the concussion blew the north wall
into the Quadrangle court.
Practically uninjured were the
organ, chimes, clock, stained-glass
windows, and carved pulpit. The
Memorial Arch the brick additions
to the Museum, the unfinished li
brary and gymnasium, and numerous
arches in the Outer Quadrangle were
leveled.
The one-story buildings of the
Outer Quadrangle, except one; the
Physiology and Zoology buildings,
the Thomas Welton Stanford Library,
the old Engineering Building, the
Machine Shop, the Foundry, and the
Mechanical Laboratory required only
minor repairs.
Many Buildings Injured
The four two-story corner build
ings of the Outer Quadrangle, the

Forge and Woodworking Shop, and
the Chemistry Building necessitated
considerable rebuilding of their
walls. Majority of the damage at
Roble was found to be the two holes
ripped in the floors by the tumbling
chimneys. In Encina the south walls
of the east and west wings required
rebuilding, in addition to repairs
necessitated by the falling chimneys.
Injuries to the frame cottages and
the fraternity and sorority houses
were confined for the most part to
falling chimneys, wrecked plaster.

broken china, and overturned furni-
An amusing incident of the tem
blor's aftermath was (he tumbling
of a statue of Louis Agassiz head
first into the concrete in front of the
Zoology Building.

Some still tell the old wheeze that
President David Starr Jordan walked
up, smiled and said, "I've often en
joyed you in the abstract, but this
is the first time I've ever admired
you in the concrete."
Dr. Jordan's first estimate of the

•financial loss caused by the earth-'
quake was $2,800,000, and in a press
wire dispatch the next day the esti
mate was raised to $4,000,000. Al
though these figures were exagger
ated, the total cost of restoring all
the buildings, not counting Memorial
Church, was about $650,000. This
work was under the supervision of
the Commission of Engineers, con
sisting of Professors C. D. Marx.
W. F. Durand, and C. B. Wing. They
accomplished the almost impossible
task of renovating essential build
ings so that the University could
reopen on August 23.
The restoration of Memorial
Church cost about another $650,000.
since it was decided at a later time
to tear down and rebuild practically
from the ground up. Replacement
of the wrecked library and gymna
sium added more than three-quarters
of a million dollars to the earth
quake - reconstruction cost. The
wrecked additions to the Museum
were never replaced.
Excerpts from Letter
Excerpts from a letter written at
the time serve to convey the emo
tions connected with the event:
"Dearest Folks: Strange to say,
I'm still alive! I can't tell the begin
ning for I don't know anything about
it. except this—l have a faint recol
lection of sitting up in bed (I guess
it was light). Somehow I got my

kimono and next found myself in
Eva's room. I don't know how I got
there, or what I thought, I never
heard such a noise in all my life,
and things were just flying all over
my room We are sitting out
on the lawn now, waiting for another
shock. Expect it about 11—got news
from Mt. Hamilton. Goodby, if the
earth swallows us up. We're hoping
for the best and are really quite
cheerful. I can't tell you how per
fectly miraculous it is that we are
all alive. Not a soul in our house
was even scratched."
Quad Roped Off
The Quadrangles were promptly
roped off, guards were placed at the
entrances, and throughout the sum
mer admission was by pass only.
Removal of debris was begun almost
Immediately, but it was not until the
29th of June that the work of recon
struction was placed in the hands of
the Commissions of Engineers.
The probem of (he 1906 graduating
class was settled by voting degrees
in May to all candidates who were
up in their studies at the time of the
earthquake. The others were re
quired to take examinations in Sep
tember, and degrees were voted at
that time. The deferred Commence
ment was held on September 15,
with the Commencement address by
President Wheeler of the University
ot California
