# Hoover Library Houses Rare Items
## 
### 
To Stanford students during the
past year and a half the Hoover Li
brary on War, Peace and Revolution
has meant little more than the irk
some noise of early-morning rivet
ing, the cramping of the Libe park
ing lot, or a subject for innumerable
Chappie gags.
But in the 280-foot tower that con
stitutes the Hoover Libe will be
housed before the year is out not
only the greatest historical collection
on one period ever collectedâ€”but the
only collection of documents, news
paper and films on the World War I
and the hectic period that followed
it in the world today that is open to
research without the interference of
a totalitarian government.
Hoover's Idea
The idea of the Hoover Library
came to Mr. Hoover soon after the
outbreak of the World War. Notic
ing a paragraph in a book by Presi
dent Andrew D. White of Cornell in
which the author complained of the
difficulty of obtaining material about
the French Revolution because the
documents of the period had been
destroyed, Mr. Hoover hit upon the
idea of starting a collection of docu
ments, papers and books on the con
flagration then going on.
First Books Arrive
The Hoover Library has been an
integral part of Stanford since 1920
when the first crate of books arrived
from Europe. A wing of the Stanford
Library was set aside to house the
collection, and a staff was set to work
sorting out and filing the huge
amounts of material that began to
pour in.
It soon became apparent that the
quarters in the main library would
soon become inadequate to house the
collection. As a result plans were
called for a special building which
today has become the Hoover Li
brary on War, Peace and Revolution.
Collection Divided
The collection that makes up the
Hoover Library, which began with
Mr. Hoover's war-time collection,
now consists of 160,000 printed l"w>oks

'and pamphlets; twenty-six archives*
with more than 2.000,000 items; 1.350
miscellaneous manuscripts, 25,500
posters and photographs; 4,500 maps;
and 300,000 feet of film. In addition
to these there are several collections
of pre-war official documents, 35.000
in all, running back into the 18th
century.

i Because of the rarity of much of
the collection and the secrecy which
must of necessity surround many
items, the Hoover Library guards its
collection jealously. For instance,
researchers using certain material
must sign a pledge book in which
they promise not to reveal the con
tents.
