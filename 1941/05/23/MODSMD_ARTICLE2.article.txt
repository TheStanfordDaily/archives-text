Is a son like Ins lather: Arc daughters like their mothers.- Ami
are the grandsons and granddaughters to he like their grandparents:
If one could give answers to these questions he could draw a picture
of the Stanford student of the last liltv vcars; lor we now have reached
the grandson and granddaughter stage in the student hodv <>1 our
aging University.
For a good part of the filtv years of Stanford's life 1 have known
a considerable number of its students. As I get acquainted with the
students of the present dav I find replicas of bovs and girls whom 1

knew as undergraduates hll \ years ago. The general type <>l Stanford
students has not materialh changed. In the ver\ early days ot the
University the average age was somewhat greater and the initiative and
enterprise of the students somewhat more evident. This was natural
enough, for an untried institution was particularly attractive to those who
had the pioneer spirit. At the same time the State ot (California itself
was not so organized as it is today. Its population was much less and its
social strcture was very much more individualistic. B\ and large, the
student ( >1 today has more information, perhaps what one might call
more sophistication, than in the University's eat'K davs; hut Ins mental
and moral fiber is almost identical. The gvmnasium records show that
our boys and girls have grown a little taller and weigh a little more:
but this has probably come from a change in diet ami a more outdoor
life, rather than from anything for which the schools and universities
are responsible.

I lie Mm lent ol toilav is more accustomed lo the use of water with
.1 little soap in it than were the students of the earh years. There were
no showers available for tlu first eight or ten years and, while the bath
tubs were large, the water in them came from the somewhat sulphurous
bottom of Searsville Lake. I here were no swimming pools. Sun tan,
except on the nose and the back of the neck, was practically unknown
and not sought after. All clothing was worn buttoned up. When the
mandolin anil glee clubs went out for public exhibitions tliev dressed
with high collars and looked like stullcd birds. The rather loose and

easv cost will's of tod.iv arc representative ol somewhat greater freedom
in social relations and in household manners. Klbows on the table were
considered do trap in the earlv Stanford hoarding houses and I rater
nit ies.
In brief, 1 should sav that the student ol today ' s taller, heavier,
healthier, a lot more casv going, and more interested in dramatics and
dances than those of hftv vcars ago; but in everv essential qualitv the
bov or girl of todav could have come to Stanford in anv one of the
List filtv vcars and found himself or herself liappv and at home.
While Stanford will change in lis curriculum and in its various
activities 1 anticipate that the Stanford student will remain about the
same for main decades ahead. I le will, though, come to the I nivcrsit\
.1 little later and stav longer to do more advanced work toward those
advanced degrees that are inevitable in a L*ni\ersit\ which considers
it part of its function t<> provide education for some useful purpose.
