# ANNIVERSARY MUSICAL FETES PLANNED
## 
### 
Always an integral part of the.
University life, musical entertain
ment has become one of the most
outstanding features of the Fiftieth
Anniversary celebration.
From the first performance of
"Pinafore," given in 1896 in the old
gym, right down to this winter's
lavish and record-breaking presen
tations of "Of Thee I Sing" and
Smetana's "Bartered Bride," the
Stanford audience has appreciated
and attended musical shows.
In the concert field, a parade of
great artists have sung on the Farm
through the years in the old As
sembly Hall and, since 1937, in Me
morial Hall. Through the Concert
Series office, a precedent was broken
this year when the students of the
University were given the chance of
choosing the artists they will hear
next season. These will include Cor
nelia Otis Skinner, the monologuLst;
Wagnerian soprano Helen Traubel;
Jose Iturbi, pianist; and Paul Robe
son, greatest living negro baritone.
Undergraduate Tradition
Glee clubs and student-written
musical comedies have been part of
the undergraduate tradition since the
beginning, but unfortunately the
Delta Upsilon musicales, famed for
their fine programs and quiet good
taste, have died out.
The most outstanding musical con
tributions to the campus in recent
years have been those sponsored by
the Friends of Music. Mrs. Eliza
beth Sprague Coolidge had for sev
eral years before 1937 provided the
Stanford community with chamber
music concerts. In that year Mrs.
Herbert Hoover instigated the foun
dation of the new group with Mrs.
Coolidge's help, and the Friends of
Music, at first informal, were headed
by Mrs. Frederick Wheeler of Wood
side. When the Friends' activities
reached a scope which necessitated
a formal organization, Mrs. Hoover
was elected president and she was

! followed by Mrs. Russell Lee.
Since Founders' Day on March 9,
the University has been in a sort
of continuous music festival being
held in honor of the Fiftieth Anni
versary. Co-operating to make this
possible are the Anniversary Com
mittee, the Friends of Music, and
Mrs. Coolidge. On the opening day
the Stanford Brass Choir began the
morning with a concert delivered
from the top of the Hoover War Li
brary. Then during the services in

j Memorial Church, the choir sang an
anthem written by Dr. Warren D. 1
Allen, church organist and pro
fessor of music. It was titled "Do- I
minus illuminato mea," which is the
motto of the church.
That night Pierre Monteux and
the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra presented a concert in Me
morial Church the feature of which
was Roy Harris' new symphonic
work dedicated to Stanford, "Ode to
Truth."

During March Dr. Kamiel Lefe
vere, carillonneur of the Riverside
Church in New York, was on campus
to install the Belgian carillon in the
Hoover War Library. Before he left,
he favored the campus with several
impromptu concerts.
During April the Pro Arte Quar
tet played a series of Sunday after
noon concerts in Memorial Hall.
These programs were made possible
by joint gifts from the Elizabeth J
Sprague Coolidge Foundation in the I

Library of Congress, the Friends of
Music at Stanford, and the Fiftieth
Anniversary Committee.
A Festival Chorus of Stanford
students, the band and orchestra will
take over on May 14, anniversary of
the laying of the cornerstone. The
band will play during the afternoon
in the amphitheater, and the church
will be the scene of an evening con
cert during which the chorus, sym
phony and the organ will be heard.
Mozart takes over for the last week
in May, because, according to Dr.
Allen, ". . . his music seems to be
the best antidote for the poisons of
1941; because such music is always
appropriate where humane, rational,
disciplined people enjoy 'the winds
of freedom' "
Entertainment Soon
The program includes: May 26,
chamber music in the Education
Building auditorium; May 27, the
Stanford Symphony under Molnar
with distinguished soloists assisting
in the concertos, in Memorial Hall;
May 28, "Cosi fan tutte" in a short
ened version, directed by Dr. Pop
per, to be presented in the Little
Theater; May 29, the Thursday af
ternoon recital devoted to Mozart;
and on May 30 a performance of the
"Requiem Mass."
Dr. Allen has asked every alum
nus who ever sang in the University
Choir to come back and sing for the
June baccalaureate service. Then
on June 20, the Hoover War Library
will be dedicated, and the San Fran
cisco Symphony under Monteux will
present its second concert that eve
ning in the Frost Amphitheater.
During the summer the Pro Arte
Ensemble will be present on campus
to give eight Brahms concerts. And
the following October a series of out
door musical programs will be given.
Tentatively scheduled for these are
the Music Lovers' Society and the
El Camino Quartet, among others.


STANFORD'S 1906 BAND, pictured above, bears slight resemblance to the flashily clad bandsmen that parade
j between the halves of today's football games. The Stanford Band was organized in 1893 by A. C. Kaufman and
I inside of ten years it had achieved wide popularity.
