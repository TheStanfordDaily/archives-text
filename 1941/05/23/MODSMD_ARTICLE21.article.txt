Stanford's winning of the Com
monwealth Club debate over the two
California students who had taken
first and second places in *he 46th
annual Medaille Joffre contest be
tween the two schools climaxed an
active forensic program for 1040-41.
Debating at Stanford is celebrating
its fiftieth year along with the Uni
versity. When Stanford first opened,
several debating societies were form
ed immediately. It was only when
Stanford started debating as a school
against other Pacific Coast universi
ties that the societies were integrated
into one. Inter-collegiate debating
on the coast was begun when the
University of Washington, the Uni
versity of Oregon and Stanford de
cided to hold inter-sectional debates.
joffre Debate Started
In those early years, the Medaille
Joffre debate was instituted. First
established in 1894 by the govern
ment of France as the Medaille Car
not debate, in honor of the martyred
French president, the title of the con
test was in 1917 changed to its pres
ent name as a tribute to the French
World War general.
Now in its 46th year, the contest is
the oldest of American intercollegiate
debates. In the last ten events, Stan
ford has won seven, but the complete
record shows a 23-23 tie between the
two schools.
Stanford's debate coaches have

been the guiding power in the suc
cess of Farm debating. Professor
Clyde Dunaway was the first, fol
lowed by Professor Lee Emerson
Bassett. Next came Miller McClin
tock who, after he left Stanford,
worked out the American traffic sys
tem for automobiles, which were just
numerous enough to be troublesome
in those days.
James Gordon Emerson followed
McClintock. Emerson was famous
for his Joffre debate teams which
won seven contests in eight years.
Dr. Leland T. Chapin of the Speech
and Drama department is the present
debate coach and has served in that
capacity for eight years.
Stanford debating in the past dec
ade has stepped far out of the Uni
versity boundaries.
Traveling Forensics
Ten years ago, the first travelling
debate squad went on a nationwide
forensic tour. This year's team, Linn
Moses and Bob Newell, met teams
from 20 colleges in northern, middle
western, eastern, and south-western
states. These two were elected floor
leaders in the congress-convention of
Delta Sigma Rho, national honorary
debate society, which was held in
Chicago.
In 1937, Jim Reynolds and Jim Hill
started a type of tour which was new
to Stanford. They travelled through
Mexico, Guatemala, and Salvador on
a debate-research tour with the idea
of observing economic, political and
social conditions in those countries.
Famous Debaters
Walt Stoessel, Bob Moulton, Bob
Putnam, and Harry Horton did much
the same thing in 1938 when they
toured the Southwest on a trip for
research on American Indians.
Among those who have taken part
in debate at Stanford are Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Jr., son of the president of
the University; Bill Rogers, son of
the late Will Rogers; Bobby Gray
son, captain of the famous "Vow
Boys"; and Dave and Sherm Mellin
koff, both of whom were leaders in
campus activities. Five student-body
presidents have participated in de
bate.
