# FARM "HOLES" POPULAR
## 
### 
Mystery Number 1 in a freshman
woman's first tour of Roble is a door
in the basement labeled "The Hole."
But when she runs out of toothpaste
a few days later, the Stanford neo
phyte discovers that "The Hole"
turns out to be a miniature store
that sells cokes, candy, cigarettes,
and toilet articles.
The store was christened back in
1926 because its location was just a
hole in the basement wall. The Uni
versity started the store to satisfy
the persistent between-meal appetite
that freshman women displayed, de
spite the fact that they had only to
walk three blocks to the Cellar for
food. The girls appointed to operate
the new enterprise stocked up on
kleenex, ivory soap, Johnson's baby
powder, toothpaste, cigarettes and all
their favorite chocolate bars. In later
years the laws of demand and sup
ply added to the Hole's inventory
such commodities as apple juice, eye
brow pencils, Halo shampoo, and
dried fruit.
Lagunifa 'Holes'
So successful was the Roble busi
ness venture, that when Lagunita
was built in 1933, two identical holes
were installed in the east and west
courts. The income earned by the
girls who run these holes is equiva
lent to that of a hashing job. How
ever, one girl can only operate a
hole for half a school year.
To serve a similar purpose for
freshmen men, the Encina store was

started by the University in 1923.
Complete with soda fountain, the
new store supplanted a small smoke
shop that was operated by a Palo
Alto businessman. Besides candy and
drugs, the Encina store serves plate
lunches for 25 or 35 cents depending
on the number of pies accompany
ing the meal.
Free-Lance Eating
This meal service was created es
pecialy for Stanford men who pre
ferred free lance eating at irregular
hours to the monthly payment plan
of the eating clubs. Another peculiar
virtue of the Encina store, according
to its patrons, is that absolutely no
women are allowed. This regulation
permits sleepy frosh to come down
to breakfast in dressing gowns.
Although the directors receive re
quests for beer at least once a week,
milk remains the most popular drink
at the Encina store. Coffee drinkers
limit their imbibing activities to the
more romantic atmosphere of the
Cellar.
Since the store began, its custom
ers have inscribed their memoires in
the soft wood table tops which now
decorate the walls in the form of
picture hangings. Among the ini
tials carved in the table tops are
those of Ernie Nevers, famous foot
ball star of the mid-'twenties.
Nevers' picture can be found in the
group photographs of freshmen
gridiron teams that also adorn the
walls.
