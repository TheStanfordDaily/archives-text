# FARM RECALLS FABULOUS HISTORY

. . and the children of California .shall be our children." ■
Thus did Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford found one of
America's great universities on the rolling, oak-covered hills
of their Palo Alto stock farm.
The date was November 11, 1885. The West was a strong,
healthy infant and the decades since "the days of '49" numbered
less than four. Palo Alto was "the farm" where the Governor's
thoroughbreds were trained to shatter world marks.
Today Stanford is stiil "the farm," and the West is a strong,
young giant, grown older but not old. And Stanford University,
pausing for a second to look back over fifty turbulent years, is
a symbol of tht West and its maturity.
The University was endowed as a memorial to 16-year-old
Leland Stanford, Jr., who had died in Florence, Italy, the pre
vious year. Like the Pacific Railroad, which skeptics had said
couldn't be built, it took more years than Stanford had expected
to open the new University. On May 14, 1887, the cornerstone
was laid in the midst of the yellow fields, with Judge Horatio
Sawyer, first president of the Board of Trustees and the orator
of the day. asking "what should prevent this University from
becoming, in the great future, the first in this, or any other
land?"
Stanford Finally Opens
The University did not open its doors until Oct. 1, 1891.
Aging Leland Stanford, then United States Senator, stood on
the unfinished quadrangle and voiced the hope that "a wise
system of education will develop a future civilization as much
in advance of that of the present as ours is in advance of the
condition of the savage," and that it would achieve "a bloodless
revolution and establish a republic of industry, merit, and
learning."
Stanford began with a handful of students—ss9—and today
has about 4,000. But its first classes were larger than the Uni
versity of California's, a school then 23 years old. And it had
the strong, confident leadership of Dr. David Starr Jordan, the
Hoosier teacher who was the University's President for almost
half its first fifty years.
Senator Stanford's gift of 20 million dollars to endow a
college created a great popular impression at the time. Coming
at the opening of the era of Rockefeller, Guggenheim and
Carnegie, his was the first iarge public donation of any of the
nation's post-Civil War industrial giants.
The world got the idea, immediately, that Stanford was
"the richest endowed university in America," and the Uni
versity has never been able to alter that conception completely.
Actually Stanford was established on a shoestring, fought finan
cial lailure for its first ten years, and then faced new costs
resulting from the earthquake and later the World War price
boom.
Many Early Financial Struggles
On its opening day, Stanford's total property consisted of
90.000 acres of largely unproductive farmland and 15 class
rooms. It was dependent on income from business properties
for its operating expenses.
And less than two years later Senator Stanford died and
the whole financial structure was plunged into confusion. The
estate was tied up in probate court, with 8 million dollars in
debts and legacies to be paid before funds could be released to
the University.
A federal suit for 15 million dollars added further trouble,
and it was during this period that professors and administrators
were paid from a $10,000 a month fund that a sympathetic court
allowed Mrs. Stanford for her servants and personal mainte
nance. Stanford professors were legally "servants" of the
Senator's widow.
The court action was finally settled in Mrs. Stanford's favor
by three decisions, one of them by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Mrs. Stanford journeyed to London for Queen Victoria's Jubi
lee—with the half-admitted motive of selling her jewels to
finance a Memorial Church. But her project failed, and it
was not until ten years later that her gems were sold to start
the famous "Jewel Fund" that became the basis for the Uni
versity's library.
'Stone Age' of New Buildings
It was the turn of the century, and the Farm sent its com
pany of soldiers away to the Spanish-American War. There
were flush hazing, "plug-ugly" battles, and the first of the
30-ycar-war with Cal over possession of the Axe, now in the
Union Cellar show-case.
People called it the "stone age" at Stanford, too. Around
the inner quad, an outer quadrangle mushroomed to life. Be
yond this came the library, science buildings, and gymnasium.
And in the center towered the great steeple of the mosaic
inlaid Memorial Church. The enrollment, too, had climbed
from its original 559 to more than 1,500.
With the building program completed, Stanford settled down
to solid educational effort. Mrs. Stanford's death brought
additional grants to the University, increasing its endowment
to about 21 million and placing it first in America. Since then,
great gifts to other colleges have juggled the list so that Stanford
now stands in tenth place.
The pioneer era of "the Farm" came to a close on that
April day in 1806 when buildings toppled and the earthquake
sealed the first chapter of Stanford history.
World War I Takes Students
Alter the quake, Stanfoid rebuilt and continued, academi
cally, to grow, quietly and steadily. The Cooper Medical School
in San Francisco became the Stanford School of Medicine.
After 23 years of administering Stanford affairs, Dr. David
Starr Jordan turned over active supervision to Dr. John Casper
Branner in 1913. Three years later Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
young Dean of the Medical School, became Stanford's third
President. This year, tho commemoration year, lie completes
25 seasons as leader of the University.
The rumble of guns rolling up to European fronts echoed
along silent quadrangles in the hazy August days of 1914. But
even in the two and one-half years of American neutrality,
Stanford was indirectly involved in war service, notably the
Commission for Relief in Belgium. Herbert Hoover, '95. had
established it and Stanford had contributed more than $56,000
by the end of the war.
Responding to student demand and the pressure of war
declaration, Stanford joined in a dozen fields of preparation.
President Wilbur became the S.A.T.C. director for California

• ind four other Western states; more than 800 men were trained in
infantry, naval, and medical units; for two-thirds of Stanford's stu
dents, normal academic life was replaced by full-time military
training.
After the war came another phase of Stanford growth. The Uni
versity began to amass the great collection of documents and papers,
films and books, that make up the gigantic Hoover Library on War,
Revolution and Peace.
Stanford entered another "stone age," too. In five years the Uni
versity has erected four new buildings, including the Hoover Library.
These consist of the Memorial Hall, financed by the Associated Stu
dents and dedicated to the Farm's World War victims; the Cubberley
Education Building, unique in the annals of education as the gift of
one professor to the school he served; the new Boathouse on Lake
Lagunita, erected by the Associated Students. In addition, the Frost
Memorial Amphitheater was constructed, an open-air Greek theater
of greal beauty and remarkable landscaping achievement.
The number of scholarships at the University, offered to hundreds
of undergraduates and graduates, has increased steadily each year.
And gifts to Stanford now average about $2,000 a day. More than
18,000 persons are listed as donors, so that it has become truly a "gift
supported" univeisity.
