# HALF OF STUDENTS EARN EXPENSES
## 
### 
Despite Stanford's reputation as a "rich man's school" and a
j "country club university," figures show that over 50 per cent of
J students on the Farm earn all or part of their college expenses.
In fact, the emphasis on employment is so great that the University
maintains an Employment Office with a permanent staff of nine work
ers. This office assists students in finding part-time regular work,
temporary work on or near campus, co-operates with the National
Youth Administration, and helps graduating seniors and alumni find
permanent employment.
Registration figures reveal that 1,400 students are now earning part
or all of their expenses while at Stanford. It is estimated that an
additional 1,000 help to provide for their education by working in the
| summer.
Two hundred and sixteen men earn 100 per cent of their expenses,
while 26 women are entirely self-supporting. Further, about one
eighth of the student body earn more than 50 per cent of their ex
! penses.
Almost $50,000 will be received by working students during the
| current school year from the National Youth Administration. N.Y.A.
i provides jobs for 300 to 450 students a year. Under this program
undergraduates receive a maximum of $20 per month and graduates
I $30 monthly. Average wage is between 50 and 60 cents an hour.

N.Y.A. provides that students shall not be assigned to any
work which comes within the regular University budget and
which would result in the displacement of workers paid from
other funds.
Most student N.Y.A. work is clerical, library, research, and
survey.
Most popular form of school work is, of course, hashing.
Campus fraternities, sororities, and eating clubs employ a total
of 183 hashers, while it is estimated that 125 students hash off
campus in Palo Alto establishments.
Several hundred men and women are in the service of the
Union dining halls, including Encina, Roble, Lagunita, Cellar,
and dining hall. Women as well as men hash two or three meals
daily in return for their meals.
Students also earn their tuition and other expenses by work
ing as service station attendants, gardeners, clothing salesmen,
bookkeepers, hospital janitors and orderlies, regular blood
donors, magazine distributors, and in dozens of other capacities.
Other Jobs for Students
In addition, numerous agencies are operated on campus by
students, such as laundry, soft drinks, stores in the halls, jew
elry, and stationery. Many students are employed by Palo
Alto establishments as campus representatives.
Still other students hold paying positions on campus publi
cationsâ€”the Quad, Daily, Chaparral, Dividex; on the student
police force and fire department; as custodians, sponsors, and
managers in the halls and fraternities. Some student jobs pay
as high as $1,000 during a school year.
A very large percentage of the student body work during
school holidays. The Employment Service places students dur
ing Christmas and for the summer. Last Christmas, of the 208
applicants all but 25 secured employment. The Employment
Service maintains contacts with various camps, national parks
and resorts, and business firms through which jobs are obtained
for hundreds.
Further, the various departments place students during the
summer. Particularly the technical departments find employ
ment for students with .oil, chemical, and engineering com
panies.
According to Adelaide Palmer, director of student employ
ment, ''Most jobs cleared through my branch of the service are
temporary, from day to day, and are filled by students indicat
ing their desire to do odd jobs.
"However, many regular part-time jobs are cleared and
students often hold them for several years," Miss Palmer added.
An entirely different service, but perhaps even more impor
tant, is provided by the Appointment Service under the direc
tion of Ruth Tracksell. The service carries on the work of find
ing permanent employment for students after graduation and
for all Stanford alumni.
Employment Service Thorough
Stanford's service is much more elaborate than those of most
other universities. The University's policy is to keep thorough
records on candidates for jobs, a system which has proved ex
tremely successful in the past.
"Companies throughout the country place much confidence
in our service," stated Miss Ti'acksell.
Corroborating this is the fact that for the past two years the
service has had more jobs to fill than it could handle. All but
a very few of last year's applicants have been placed. And again
this year the major problem is to find enough men for the
offers.
Most calls for men are of the engineer-scientist type with
national companies. Examples of the type of work required
and the firms with which graduates are placed follow:
Columbia and Bethlehem Steel, Baniff and Pan American
Airways, International Business, Aetna Insurance, Matson Navi
gation, J. C. Penney, Libby, McNeil and Libby; Lockheed,
Vultee, Standard Oil and Shell, Southern Pacific, Carnation
Milk, Albers Flour, Retail Credit, Chrysler Motors, Crane
Plumbing, Dow and General Chemical, Firestone and Goodrich
Tire, and Emsco Derrick.
In addition, calls are constantly received from Bay Area and
Pacific Coast firms for engineers, secretaries, promotion and
salesmen, and personnel and business executives.
Interviews Arranged for Students
The appointment service arranges interviews with candidates
and company representatives. Candidates are selected from
their portfolios in which references, pictures, abilities, and
grades are recorded.
Miss Tracksell reports that a "tremendous effort is being
made to keep the friends now being made during the pressure
of defense employment."
"We have had calls during the past two years from new
companies, but we have not had enough men to go around," Miss
Tracksell said. "However, we do what we can by giving them
the best service possible."
"You see," Miss Tracksell continued, "we remember the days
of depression when we were glad to place engineers as service
station attendants. We are planning for the future."
The service is not limited to graduating seniors; all alumni
are welcome to use the University's facilities.
Opportunities for graduating students to find employment
are not limited to the work of the Appointment Service. Most
departments of the University are in regular contact with com
panies in need of the particular services offered by their grad
uates.
This is particularly true of the Graduate School of Business,
which places most of its graduates with the best-known cor
porations in thp country. Engineering and Education Schools,
working in collaboration with the Appointment Service, are
also very active.
Dr. John P. Mitchell, registrar, and Dr. Karl M. Cowdery.
associate registrar, are executive heads of the employment
service.
