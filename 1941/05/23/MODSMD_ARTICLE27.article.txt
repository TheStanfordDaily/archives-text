# 'No Phones' in Early '90's
## 
### 
When the University was first opened, insuperable objections
were found to placing telephones in the President's Office or
in Encina Hall. The business management of the University
was opposed because "the telephone would be used by the
different professors and pupils, and for a switch to San Fran
cisco it would cost forty cents."
