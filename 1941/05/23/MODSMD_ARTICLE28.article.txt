# Stanford Dramatics Hit New Peak
## 
### 
The hope of the American theater*
lies in the academic field, according
to Dr. Hubert Heffner, head of Stan
ford's Division of Speech and
Drama, "if we can build a theater
sufficient to continue the American
theater in a worthy way."
Though Stanford's new theater
was opened in the summer of 1937
and almost immediately produced
two tremendously successful shows
("Twelfth Night" and "Murder in the
Cathedral"), it has been only in the
last two years that Memorial Hall
has enjoyed consistently good au
diences—particularly during the
1940-41 season.
The first big popular success, after
Dr. Heffner's appearance on the
scene, was "The Warrior's Husband,"
produced during winter quarter of
1940. The play was chosen in a cam
pus-wide poll conducted by the Stan
ford Daily and the Division of Speech
and Drama. Then during spring
quarter came "Richard II."
'37 Peak Year
Neither show, however, reached the
peak set by the plays of '37. The all
time high in attendance, counting
only paid admissions, was set by last
fall's performance of "Of Thee I
Sing." Next came this winter's "Bar
tered Bride" with "St. Joan" fourth
on the all-time list.
According to Chester Barker, sec
retary of the Division of Speech and
Drama, these figures prove two
things—first that the campus seems
to like musicals best; and second, and
more important, that Stanford shows
are consistently pulling an audience,
something they've not been able to
do since the halcyon days of Gordon
Davis during the '20's.
"The '40-41 season has shown an
increase of 400 per cent," Mr. Barker
says, "and we've gained a confident
audience which is willing to take us
sight-unseen. Last September we
sold 600 season tickets in one week,
and we were forced to turn down
over 100 requests."
Two Full Stages
Memorial Hall musters two fully
equipped stages with the large and
small auditoriums, complete work
shops, dressing rooms, fully equipped
costume and make-up laboratories.
This is a far cry from Stanford's first
dramatic performance which in the
words of Will Irwin was a pretty
makeshift affair. He says:

► "In the beginning we had no the-<
ater, no stage, no one in all the stu
dent body who had even been con
nected with the profession of acting
— in fact, not even an amateur of ex
perience. The first performance held
at Stanford was brought off in the
old chapel. There was no scenery;
for curtain there was only a muslin
slide."
Operations Shifted
After the initial dramatic flyer, the
base for dramatic operations was
shifted to the old wooden gym. Be
cause the gym classes were not dis
missed until 6 p.m. the stage crew
could not even begin setting up until
6:01 on the evening of the perform
ance. This make-shift groping for
the arts continued until 1900 when
the old assembly hall was completed.
It was in this hall, and in the old
little theater, now the business
school and room 100, that all Stan
ford's dramatic activities took place
for 37 years, except for a couple of
outdoor pageants and some Greek
dramas done on the steps of the Mu
seum.
Sword and Sandals, the men's hon
orary dramatic society, was founded
early in the 'SO's, and it was followed
in 1900 by Masquers, a similar wo
men's organization. These groups ex
isted side by side and really handled,
with the English Club, the bulk of
campus productions till 1910. when
, the first professional, Frank Mathieu
of San Francisco, took over the di
rection of campus dramatics.
Leading Actors
Outstanding actors of this period
included such now well-known
alumni as "Jupiter" Culver, Shirley
Baker, Bill Erb, Chris Bradley, Bris
tow Adams, Will Irwin, A. L. Trow
bridge, Aurania Rouverol, and Eliza
beth Lee Buckingham. Student
writing talent, got its chance in the
sophomore play, junior opera, and
senior farce.
It was in 1905 that Professor Lee
Emerson Bassett, who was to be
come one of the most influential men
in Stanford drama, directed a per
formance of Ben Jonson's "Every
Man in His Humour" which received
national acclaim. Professor Bassett
became emeritus only two years ago.
During the period under Mathieu,
Ram's Head burst out in 1913 with an
original musical titled "Rambling

►Rameses" in men played women's
parts for the first time on the Stan
ford campus. That same year Sword
and Sandals gave "The Only Way"
in which W. B. Owens made dra
matic history with his performance
of Sidney Carton.
'Golden Era'
From then until the war broke out*
the Farm enjoyed what appears in
retrospect to have been its first
j period of dramatic activity of an ex
tremely high standard. Memorable
performances included Margery
Bailey in "Seven Sisters," Gordon
Davis in "Sherwood." and W. B.
Owens and Nellita Choate in "The
1 Great Divide." At the same time
came "In Dutch," by Dick Morgan,
Tom Reynolds, and Dwight Fansler,
the best of all the student-written
junior operas.
After the war in 1919 the A.S.S.U.
granted a charter to Dramatic Coun
cil in order that this organization
could supervise and manage all cam
pus shows. At the same time a dra
matics director was appointed by the
university to be in charge of the
staging of all student shows.
Davis Leads
This man was Gordon Davis, and
J it was he who was responsible for
the famed "golden age" of Stanford
drama. Among the actors who gained
their training under Davis were
Lloyd Nolan, Delmer Daves, Les
Seib, A. D. Cohan, Peggy Richard
son, Aileene Burks, Patricia Nauman,
Betty Wilbur, Bill Thornton, Jim
DuPrau, A. Grove Day, Peggy Con
verse, and Katherine Kehoe.
Davis retired in 1928 to begin a
career in Hollywood, and at the same
time the students began the first of
a long series of benefits for the much
needed new theater.
Inaugurating a novel experiment,
at least so far as Stanford is con
cerned, a group of Stanfordites
formed the Roadrunners last sum
mer and traveled around the Far
West in a trailer giving perform
ances in a portable theater. J. P.
Cahn was the leader of the move-
I ment.
Plays given were "Yes, My Dar
ling Daughter," "Kind Lady," and
"Private Lives." Starring, besides
Cahn, were Virginia Sharpe, Harry
Muheim, Tony Ceferatti, Fred
Clarke, and Margaret Paulson.

missed until 6 p.m. the stage crew
could not even begin setting up until
6:01 on the evening of the perform
ance. This make-shift groping for
the arts continued until 1900 when
the old assembly hall was completed.
It was in this hall, and in the old
little theater, now the business
school and room 100, that all Stan
ford's dramatic activities took place
for 37 years, except for a couple of
outdoor pageants and some Greek
dramas done on the steps of the Mu
seum.
Sword and Sandals, the men's hon
orary dramatic society, was founded
early in the 'SO's, and it was followed
in 1900 by Masquers, a similar wo
men's organization. These groups ex
isted side by side and really handled,
with the English Club, the bulk of
campus productions till 1910. when
, the first professional, Frank Mathieu
of San Francisco, took over the di
rection of campus dramatics.
Leading Actors
Outstanding actors of this period
included such now well-known
alumni as "Jupiter" Culver, Shirley
Baker, Bill Erb, Chris Bradley, Bris
tow Adams, Will Irwin, A. L. Trow
bridge, Aurania Rouverol, and Eliza
beth Lee Buckingham. Student
writing talent, got its chance in the
sophomore play, junior opera, and
senior farce.
It was in 1905 that Professor Lee
Emerson Bassett, who was to be
come one of the most influential men
in Stanford drama, directed a per
formance of Ben Jonson's "Every
Man in His Humour" which received
national acclaim. Professor Bassett
became emeritus only two years ago.
During the period under Mathieu,
Ram's Head burst out in 1913 with an
original musical titled "Rambling

►Rameses" in men played women's
parts for the first time on the Stan
ford campus. That same year Sword
and Sandals gave "The Only Way"
in which W. B. Owens made dra
matic history with his performance
of Sidney Carton.
'Golden Era'
From then until the war broke out*
the Farm enjoyed what appears in
retrospect to have been its first
j period of dramatic activity of an ex
tremely high standard. Memorable
performances included Margery
Bailey in "Seven Sisters," Gordon
Davis in "Sherwood." and W. B.
Owens and Nellita Choate in "The
1 Great Divide." At the same time
came "In Dutch," by Dick Morgan,
Tom Reynolds, and Dwight Fansler,
the best of all the student-written
junior operas.
After the war in 1919 the A.S.S.U.
granted a charter to Dramatic Coun
cil in order that this organization
could supervise and manage all cam
pus shows. At the same time a dra
matics director was appointed by the
university to be in charge of the
staging of all student shows.
Davis Leads
This man was Gordon Davis, and
J it was he who was responsible for
the famed "golden age" of Stanford
drama. Among the actors who gained
their training under Davis were
Lloyd Nolan, Delmer Daves, Les
Seib, A. D. Cohan, Peggy Richard
son, Aileene Burks, Patricia Nauman,
Betty Wilbur, Bill Thornton, Jim
DuPrau, A. Grove Day, Peggy Con
verse, and Katherine Kehoe.
Davis retired in 1928 to begin a
career in Hollywood, and at the same
time the students began the first of
a long series of benefits for the much
needed new theater.
Inaugurating a novel experiment,
at least so far as Stanford is con
cerned, a group of Stanfordites
formed the Roadrunners last sum
mer and traveled around the Far
West in a trailer giving perform
ances in a portable theater. J. P.
Cahn was the leader of the move-
I ment.
Plays given were "Yes, My Dar
ling Daughter," "Kind Lady," and
"Private Lives." Starring, besides
Cahn, were Virginia Sharpe, Harry
Muheim, Tony Ceferatti, Fred
Clarke, and Margaret Paulson.

The hope of the American theater*
lies in the academic field, according
to Dr. Hubert Heffner, head of Stan
ford's Division of Speech and
Drama, "if we can build a theater
sufficient to continue the American
theater in a worthy way."
Though Stanford's new theater
was opened in the summer of 1937
and almost immediately produced
two tremendously successful shows
("Twelfth Night" and "Murder in the
Cathedral"), it has been only in the
last two years that Memorial Hall
has enjoyed consistently good au
diences—particularly during the
1940-41 season.
The first big popular success, after
Dr. Heffner's appearance on the
scene, was "The Warrior's Husband,"
produced during winter quarter of
1940. The play was chosen in a cam
pus-wide poll conducted by the Stan
ford Daily and the Division of Speech
and Drama. Then during spring
quarter came "Richard II."
'37 Peak Year
Neither show, however, reached the
peak set by the plays of '37. The all
time high in attendance, counting
only paid admissions, was set by last
fall's performance of "Of Thee I
Sing." Next came this winter's "Bar
tered Bride" with "St. Joan" fourth
on the all-time list.
According to Chester Barker, sec
retary of the Division of Speech and
Drama, these figures prove two
things—first that the campus seems
to like musicals best; and second, and
more important, that Stanford shows
are consistently pulling an audience,
something they've not been able to
do since the halcyon days of Gordon
Davis during the '20's.
"The '40-41 season has shown an
increase of 400 per cent," Mr. Barker
says, "and we've gained a confident
audience which is willing to take us
sight-unseen. Last September we
sold 600 season tickets in one week,
and we were forced to turn down
over 100 requests."
Two Full Stages
Memorial Hall musters two fully
equipped stages with the large and
small auditoriums, complete work
shops, dressing rooms, fully equipped
costume and make-up laboratories.
This is a far cry from Stanford's first
dramatic performance which in the
words of Will Irwin was a pretty
makeshift affair. He says:

► "In the beginning we had no the-<
ater, no stage, no one in all the stu
dent body who had even been con
nected with the profession of acting
— in fact, not even an amateur of ex
perience. The first performance held
at Stanford was brought off in the
old chapel. There was no scenery;
for curtain there was only a muslin
slide."
Operations Shifted
After the initial dramatic flyer, the
base for dramatic operations was
shifted to the old wooden gym. Be
cause the gym classes were not dis
missed until 6 p.m. the stage crew
could not even begin setting up until
6:01 on the evening of the perform
ance. This make-shift groping for

Davis Leads
This man was Gordon Davis, and
J it was he who was responsible for
the famed "golden age" of Stanford
drama. Among the actors who gained
their training under Davis were
Lloyd Nolan, Delmer Daves, Les
Seib, A. D. Cohan, Peggy Richard
son, Aileene Burks, Patricia Nauman,
Betty Wilbur, Bill Thornton, Jim
DuPrau, A. Grove Day, Peggy Con
verse, and Katherine Kehoe.
Davis retired in 1928 to begin a
career in Hollywood, and at the same
time the students began the first of
a long series of benefits for the much
needed new theater.
Inaugurating a novel experiment,
at least so far as Stanford is con
cerned, a group of Stanfordites
formed the Roadrunners last sum
mer and traveled around the Far
West in a trailer giving perform
ances in a portable theater. J. P.
Cahn was the leader of the move-
I ment.
Plays given were "Yes, My Dar
ling Daughter," "Kind Lady," and
"Private Lives." Starring, besides
Cahn, were Virginia Sharpe, Harry
Muheim, Tony Ceferatti, Fred
Clarke, and Margaret Paulson.


THE FAMED AXE, symbol of intercollegiate rivalry between Stanford and
California, is shown here being displayed to the' Berkeley rooting section

The hope of the American theater*
lies in the academic field, according
to Dr. Hubert Heffner, head of Stan
ford's Division of Speech and
Drama, "if we can build a theater
sufficient to continue the American
theater in a worthy way."
Though Stanford's new theater
was opened in the summer of 1937
and almost immediately produced
two tremendously successful shows
("Twelfth Night" and "Murder in the
Cathedral"), it has been only in the
last two years that Memorial Hall
has enjoyed consistently good au
diences—particularly during the
1940-41 season.
The first big popular success, after
Dr. Heffner's appearance on the
scene, was "The Warrior's Husband,"
produced during winter quarter of
1940. The play was chosen in a cam
pus-wide poll conducted by the Stan
ford Daily and the Division of Speech
and Drama. Then during spring
quarter came "Richard II."
'37 Peak Year
Neither show, however, reached the
peak set by the plays of '37. The all
time high in attendance, counting
only paid admissions, was set by last
fall's performance of "Of Thee I
Sing." Next came this winter's "Bar
tered Bride" with "St. Joan" fourth
on the all-time list.
According to Chester Barker, sec
retary of the Division of Speech and
Drama, these figures prove two
things—first that the campus seems
to like musicals best; and second, and
more important, that Stanford shows
are consistently pulling an audience,
something they've not been able to
do since the halcyon days of Gordon
Davis during the '20's.
"The '40-41 season has shown an
increase of 400 per cent," Mr. Barker
says, "and we've gained a confident
audience which is willing to take us
sight-unseen. Last September we
sold 600 season tickets in one week,
and we were forced to turn down
over 100 requests."
Two Full Stages
Memorial Hall musters two fully
equipped stages with the large and
small auditoriums, complete work
shops, dressing rooms, fully equipped
costume and make-up laboratories.
This is a far cry from Stanford's first
dramatic performance which in the
words of Will Irwin was a pretty
makeshift affair. He says:

► "In the beginning we had no the-<
ater, no stage, no one in all the stu
dent body who had even been con
nected with the profession of acting
— in fact, not even an amateur of ex
perience. The first performance held
at Stanford was brought off in the
old chapel. There was no scenery;
for curtain there was only a muslin
slide."
Operations Shifted
After the initial dramatic flyer, the
base for dramatic operations was
shifted to the old wooden gym. Be
cause the gym classes were not dis
missed until 6 p.m. the stage crew
could not even begin setting up until
6:01 on the evening of the perform
ance. This make-shift groping for
the arts continued until 1900 when
the old assembly hall was completed.
It was in this hall, and in the old
little theater, now the business
school and room 100, that all Stan
ford's dramatic activities took place
for 37 years, except for a couple of
outdoor pageants and some Greek
dramas done on the steps of the Mu
seum.
Sword and Sandals, the men's hon
orary dramatic society, was founded
early in the 'SO's, and it was followed
in 1900 by Masquers, a similar wo
men's organization. These groups ex
isted side by side and really handled,
with the English Club, the bulk of
campus productions till 1910. when
, the first professional, Frank Mathieu
of San Francisco, took over the di
rection of campus dramatics.
Leading Actors
Outstanding actors of this period
included such now well-known
alumni as "Jupiter" Culver, Shirley
Baker, Bill Erb, Chris Bradley, Bris
tow Adams, Will Irwin, A. L. Trow
bridge, Aurania Rouverol, and Eliza
beth Lee Buckingham. Student
writing talent, got its chance in the
sophomore play, junior opera, and
senior farce.
It was in 1905 that Professor Lee
Emerson Bassett, who was to be
come one of the most influential men
in Stanford drama, directed a per
formance of Ben Jonson's "Every
Man in His Humour" which received
national acclaim. Professor Bassett
became emeritus only two years ago.
During the period under Mathieu,
Ram's Head burst out in 1913 with an
original musical titled "Rambling

►Rameses" in men played women's
parts for the first time on the Stan
ford campus. That same year Sword
and Sandals gave "The Only Way"
in which W. B. Owens made dra
matic history with his performance
of Sidney Carton.
'Golden Era'
From then until the war broke out*
the Farm enjoyed what appears in
retrospect to have been its first
j period of dramatic activity of an ex
tremely high standard. Memorable
performances included Margery
Bailey in "Seven Sisters," Gordon
Davis in "Sherwood." and W. B.
Owens and Nellita Choate in "The
1 Great Divide." At the same time
came "In Dutch," by Dick Morgan,
Tom Reynolds, and Dwight Fansler,
the best of all the student-written
junior operas.
After the war in 1919 the A.S.S.U.
granted a charter to Dramatic Coun
cil in order that this organization
could supervise and manage all cam
pus shows. At the same time a dra
matics director was appointed by the

Drama, these figures prove two
things—first that the campus seems
to like musicals best; and second, and
more important, that Stanford shows
are consistently pulling an audience,
something they've not been able to
do since the halcyon days of Gordon
Davis during the '20's.
"The '40-41 season has shown an
increase of 400 per cent," Mr. Barker
says, "and we've gained a confident
audience which is willing to take us
sight-unseen. Last September we
sold 600 season tickets in one week,
and we were forced to turn down
over 100 requests."
Two Full Stages
Memorial Hall musters two fully
equipped stages with the large and
small auditoriums, complete work
shops, dressing rooms, fully equipped
costume and make-up laboratories.
This is a far cry from Stanford's first
dramatic performance which in the
words of Will Irwin was a pretty
makeshift affair. He says:

► "In the beginning we had no the-<
ater, no stage, no one in all the stu
dent body who had even been con
nected with the profession of acting
— in fact, not even an amateur of ex
perience. The first performance held
at Stanford was brought off in the
old chapel. There was no scenery;
for curtain there was only a muslin
slide."
Operations Shifted
After the initial dramatic flyer, the
base for dramatic operations was
shifted to the old wooden gym. Be
cause the gym classes were not dis
missed until 6 p.m. the stage crew
could not even begin setting up until
6:01 on the evening of the perform
ance. This make-shift groping for
the arts continued until 1900 when
the old assembly hall was completed.
It was in this hall, and in the old
little theater, now the business
school and room 100, that all Stan
ford's dramatic activities took place
for 37 years, except for a couple of
outdoor pageants and some Greek
dramas done on the steps of the Mu
seum.
Sword and Sandals, the men's hon
orary dramatic society, was founded
early in the 'SO's, and it was followed
in 1900 by Masquers, a similar wo
men's organization. These groups ex
isted side by side and really handled,
with the English Club, the bulk of
campus productions till 1910. when
, the first professional, Frank Mathieu
of San Francisco, took over the di
rection of campus dramatics.
Leading Actors
Outstanding actors of this period
included such now well-known
alumni as "Jupiter" Culver, Shirley
Baker, Bill Erb, Chris Bradley, Bris
tow Adams, Will Irwin, A. L. Trow
bridge, Aurania Rouverol, and Eliza
beth Lee Buckingham. Student
writing talent, got its chance in the
sophomore play, junior opera, and
senior farce.
It was in 1905 that Professor Lee
Emerson Bassett, who was to be
come one of the most influential men
in Stanford drama, directed a per
formance of Ben Jonson's "Every
Man in His Humour" which received
national acclaim. Professor Bassett
became emeritus only two years ago.
During the period under Mathieu,
Ram's Head burst out in 1913 with an
original musical titled "Rambling

►Rameses" in men played women's
parts for the first time on the Stan
ford campus. That same year Sword
and Sandals gave "The Only Way"
in which W. B. Owens made dra
matic history with his performance
of Sidney Carton.
'Golden Era'
From then until the war broke out*
the Farm enjoyed what appears in
retrospect to have been its first
j period of dramatic activity of an ex
tremely high standard. Memorable
performances included Margery
Bailey in "Seven Sisters," Gordon
Davis in "Sherwood." and W. B.
Owens and Nellita Choate in "The
1 Great Divide." At the same time
came "In Dutch," by Dick Morgan,
Tom Reynolds, and Dwight Fansler,
the best of all the student-written
junior operas.
After the war in 1919 the A.S.S.U.
granted a charter to Dramatic Coun
cil in order that this organization
could supervise and manage all cam
pus shows. At the same time a dra
matics director was appointed by the
university to be in charge of the
staging of all student shows.
Davis Leads
This man was Gordon Davis, and
J it was he who was responsible for
the famed "golden age" of Stanford
drama. Among the actors who gained
their training under Davis were
Lloyd Nolan, Delmer Daves, Les
Seib, A. D. Cohan, Peggy Richard
son, Aileene Burks, Patricia Nauman,
Betty Wilbur, Bill Thornton, Jim
DuPrau, A. Grove Day, Peggy Con
verse, and Katherine Kehoe.
Davis retired in 1928 to begin a
career in Hollywood, and at the same
time the students began the first of
a long series of benefits for the much
needed new theater.
Inaugurating a novel experiment,
at least so far as Stanford is con
cerned, a group of Stanfordites
formed the Roadrunners last sum
mer and traveled around the Far
West in a trailer giving perform
ances in a portable theater. J. P.
Cahn was the leader of the move-
I ment.
Plays given were "Yes, My Dar
ling Daughter," "Kind Lady," and
"Private Lives." Starring, besides
Cahn, were Virginia Sharpe, Harry
Muheim, Tony Ceferatti, Fred
Clarke, and Margaret Paulson.

The hope of the American theater*
lies in the academic field, according
to Dr. Hubert Heffner, head of Stan
ford's Division of Speech and
Drama, "if we can build a theater
sufficient to continue the American
theater in a worthy way."
Though Stanford's new theater
was opened in the summer of 1937
and almost immediately produced
two tremendously successful shows
("Twelfth Night" and "Murder in the
Cathedral"), it has been only in the
last two years that Memorial Hall
has enjoyed consistently good au
diences—particularly during the
1940-41 season.
The first big popular success, after
Dr. Heffner's appearance on the
scene, was "The Warrior's Husband,"
produced during winter quarter of
1940. The play was chosen in a cam
pus-wide poll conducted by the Stan
ford Daily and the Division of Speech
and Drama. Then during spring
quarter came "Richard II."
'37 Peak Year
Neither show, however, reached the
peak set by the plays of '37. The all
time high in attendance, counting
only paid admissions, was set by last
fall's performance of "Of Thee I
Sing." Next came this winter's "Bar
tered Bride" with "St. Joan" fourth
on the all-time list.

sophomore play, junior opera, and
senior farce.
It was in 1905 that Professor Lee
Emerson Bassett, who was to be
come one of the most influential men
in Stanford drama, directed a per
formance of Ben Jonson's "Every
Man in His Humour" which received
national acclaim. Professor Bassett
became emeritus only two years ago.
During the period under Mathieu,
Ram's Head burst out in 1913 with an
original musical titled "Rambling

►Rameses" in men played women's
parts for the first time on the Stan
ford campus. That same year Sword
and Sandals gave "The Only Way"
in which W. B. Owens made dra
matic history with his performance
of Sidney Carton.
'Golden Era'
From then until the war broke out*
the Farm enjoyed what appears in
retrospect to have been its first
j period of dramatic activity of an ex
tremely high standard. Memorable
performances included Margery
Bailey in "Seven Sisters," Gordon
Davis in "Sherwood." and W. B.
Owens and Nellita Choate in "The
1 Great Divide." At the same time
came "In Dutch," by Dick Morgan,
Tom Reynolds, and Dwight Fansler,
the best of all the student-written
junior operas.
After the war in 1919 the A.S.S.U.
granted a charter to Dramatic Coun
cil in order that this organization
could supervise and manage all cam
pus shows. At the same time a dra
matics director was appointed by the
university to be in charge of the
staging of all student shows.
Davis Leads
This man was Gordon Davis, and
J it was he who was responsible for
the famed "golden age" of Stanford
drama. Among the actors who gained
their training under Davis were
Lloyd Nolan, Delmer Daves, Les
Seib, A. D. Cohan, Peggy Richard
son, Aileene Burks, Patricia Nauman,
Betty Wilbur, Bill Thornton, Jim
DuPrau, A. Grove Day, Peggy Con
verse, and Katherine Kehoe.
Davis retired in 1928 to begin a
career in Hollywood, and at the same
time the students began the first of
a long series of benefits for the much
needed new theater.
Inaugurating a novel experiment,
at least so far as Stanford is con
cerned, a group of Stanfordites
formed the Roadrunners last sum
mer and traveled around the Far
West in a trailer giving perform
ances in a portable theater. J. P.
Cahn was the leader of the move-
I ment.
Plays given were "Yes, My Dar
ling Daughter," "Kind Lady," and
"Private Lives." Starring, besides
Cahn, were Virginia Sharpe, Harry
Muheim, Tony Ceferatti, Fred
Clarke, and Margaret Paulson.
