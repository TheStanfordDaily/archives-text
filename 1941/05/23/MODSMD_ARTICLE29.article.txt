# Farm Boasts Great Past in Sports
## 
### 
Outstanding evidence of the suc
cess of Stanford in the athletic
world in (he past, and primary guar
antee of continued good fortune in
the future, is the impressive array
of athletic facilities and equipment
on the Farm.
In the stadium, with its seating
capacity of approximately 87,000. the
Farm boasts one of the largest pri
vately owned sports theaters in the
world. It has an excellent turf, and
a track which, though much ma
ligned at times, is considered good
enough by track and field experts
to have been chosen for the N.C.A.A.
meet this June. The Stadium track
was also the site of the Olympic try
outs back in 19152, when the pick
of the country's athletes competed
under what were considered ideal
conditions.
Cood Ball Field
Although the caliber of the teams
sometimes fails to measure up to it,
in the Sunken Diamond Stanford
has as good a baseball layout as any
college or university in the country.
The playing field and bleachers are
m a class well above those of many

►minor league clubs in organized
ball, and the seating capacity is more
than adequate to handle the largest
crowd that could ever be expected
at a college game.
Turning back to the subject of
track and field, the Angel I Field
oval and accompanying jumping pits
are rated with the best in the coun
try. Since the days of Blazin' Ben
Eastman, Cardinal runners have
been breaking world records on
this track, including marks in the
440, the 880. and the mile relay
record cracked last year by Clyde
Jeffrey, Craig Williamson. Ernie
Clark and Charlie Shaw.
Seating Problem
The problem of further bleachers
to build up the seating capacity at
Angell Field so that important meets
could be held there instead of on
the slower Stadium track has been
before the B.A.C. for several years,
and after the successful football
season last fall it appeared that ac
tion might be taken, but the neees
siy for repairing several thousand
seats in the Stadium made this im
practical for another year at least.

> Stanford's polo field is the fore
most collegiate site for this sport on
the Pacific Coast.
The second factor of importance
in the Farm picture, as in any ath
letic set-up, is the high caliber of
the coaching staffs. Stanford has
had the services of the top men in
virtually all sports. In football the
line of gridiron experts who have
been instrumental in repeatedly
placing Stanford in the highest ranks
begins with Walter Camp and con
tinues on, reaching a peak of popu
larity first under Glenn Scoby "Pop"
Warner in the 'twenties.
Warner turned out several fine
teams on the Farm, teams which
were popular.
'Vowing Sophomores'
After Warner came Tiny Thorn
hill and the Vowing Sophs, P.C.C.
champs for three years hand-run
ning, and now Clark Shaughnessy
has come on the scene to continue
the tradition. Off his first season
it would appear that the miracle
man of 1940 may surpass them all.
On the heels of the Vowing Sophs
came Angelo "Hank" Luisetti and
the Laughing Boys to give the Farm
supremacy in another sport—basket
ball. John Bunn coached this five
to the southern division flag three
years in a row, then was booted
upstairs to the position of Dean
of Men, and Everett Dean came west
from Indiana to take charge of the
casaba squad, bringing the Farm
his first championship last winter.
Two years ago Dink Templeton
disappeared from the Stanford
coaching ranks, after years of turn
ing out one strong track team after
another. National championships and
world records were frequent under
his tutelage, and it is hard to con
ceive of anyone successfully step
ping into his shoes
"Pitch" Johnson is finding this
true in his first year as varsity track
mentor, but with the fine frosh

squad that has just completed its
season, the best in eight years, pros
pects for the future are good.
Fourth of the coaching "New Re
gime" that has come to the Farm
in the past three years is Johnny
Lamb, recently appointed tennis
mentor. With plenty of good ma
terial on hand, Lamb promises to
turn out players who will go as
high in the national rankings as did
Keith Gledhi 11.
Foremost name in recent Stanford
golf history is that of Lawson Little.

recognized nationally as one of the
top pro players in the nation. As in
tennis, however, there are men
working under Eddie Twiggs who
may equal or surpass Little's
achievements sometime in the fu
ture. The present strength of the
Cardinal golfeis is attested to by
the fact that in the P.C.C. tourney,
held on the Stanford course recently,
the Twiggsmen placed six out of
eight men in the quarter finals, and
that both finalists were Stanford
Tolfers.


ANCELO HENRY
"HANK" LUISETTI,
'38, all - time All -
American basketball
player. Luisetti was
the leader of the fa
mous Laughing Boys,
who won three con
secutive Pacific Coast
Conference champion
ships under Coach
John Bunn, now Dean
of Men. Luisetti holds
practically every scor
ing record in the Con
ference at present as
well as several national
standards.


AN IDEA of how playing conditions for Stanford's football teams have changed
in forty years may be gained by the view of the varsity field of 1900 I top)
and an oil painting of the modern stadium by Glenn S. "Pop" Warner, coach
from 1924 to 1933. The old stands seated 2,500, the present stadium
accommodates 87,000.
