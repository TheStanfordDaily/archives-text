# Klystron Leads Farm Discoveries
## 
### 
When Senator Stanford founded
the University 50 years ago, he began
not only an institution for the edu
cation of the country's youth, but
also a great laboratory from which
were to come some of the century';
greatest discoveries in scientific
fields.
The most famous Stanford research
product in recent years is the Kly
stron, which was developed in Farm
laboratories by Sigurd and Russell
Varian, Dr. William W. Hansen -and
Dr. David L. Webster. This amazing
invention, now under manufacture
by the Sperry Gyroscope Company,
enables a ship or plane to determine
the distance of any object which may
be in front of it, is capable of send
ing several hundred thousand si
multaneous telephone conversations
through a hollow pipe, and provides
a blind landing for planes.
Klystron's Secret
The secret of the Klystron is its
ability to produce ultra-short waves.
The length of the average radio wave
is about I.OCO feet; Klystron waves
come as short as four inches. Be
cause of this, frequencies 3,000 times
higher than normal radio frequen
cies can now be obtained.
Stanford has also had a part in the
perfection of the University of Cali
fornia's famed cyclotron, through
the work of Professor Felix Bloch
of the Farm's physics department.
Working in conjunction with Pro
fessor Luis W. Alvarez of the Ber
keley institution, he has found a
new measurement of the neutron's
infinitesimal strength, accurate to
within 1 per cent.
The Stanford department of chem
istry is one of the outstanding in
the country. Much of this depart
ment's fame can be traced to the
work of the late Professor E. C.
Franklin, whose discoveries in the
field of liquid ammonia have been
the basis of several important chem
ical processes. Also outstanding has
been the work in the field of indus
trial waste products, carried on un
der the direction of Professors R. E.
Swain and J. R. Mitchell.
Stanford biochemists have com

bined the work of Drs. E. W. Schults
and Hubert S. Loring of the physi
ology department with discoveries ]
j in ultracentrifuge of the chemistry
department to make important dis
j coveries in the isolation of the in
j fantile paralysis virus.
The Stanford School of Medicine
j got into the nation's headlines a short
j time ago with the announcement
j that its researchers had discovered
j a drug for the treatment of syphilis
which could be swallowed in cap
-1 sule form and taken into the blood
' stream through the stomach wall, j

This drug, recently accepted by the
Council on Pharmacy and Chem
istry of the American Medical Asso
ciation, is regarded by the medical
profession as one of the most prom
ising of all weapons for combating
syphilis.
Stanford Medical School profes
sors have also carried on conclusive
experiments into the treatment of
"San Joaquin Valley fever," an en
demic disease which threatens the
health of California agricultural
workers.
One of the most famous fields of

scientific research at Stanford has
been that of fisheries. David Starr
Jordan, the University's first Presi
dent, laid the foundation for this j
research with the foundation of the I

now-famous Jordan fish collection.
Much of the work of this depart
ment has been in the field of salmon
conservation. It was in Stanford


THE KLYSTRON as it appeared during experimental stages. It is shown here producing ultra-short radio waves so powerful that they can be seen in a
standing-wave pattern in the glass tube held by Professor W. W. Hansen. The Klystron is now being manufactured commercially.
