# Klystron Leads Farm Discoveries
## 
### 
When Senator Stanford founded
the University 50 years ago, he began
not only an institution for the edu
cation of the country's youth, but
also a great laboratory from which
were to come some of the century';
greatest discoveries in scientific
fields.
The most famous Stanford research
product in recent years is the Kly
stron, which was developed in Farm
laboratories by Sigurd and Russell
Varian, Dr. William W. Hansen -and
Dr. David L. Webster. This amazing
invention, now under manufacture
by the Sperry Gyroscope Company,
enables a ship or plane to determine
the distance of any object which may
be in front of it, is capable of send
ing several hundred thousand si
multaneous telephone conversations
through a hollow pipe, and provides
a blind landing for planes.
Klystron's Secret
The secret of the Klystron is its
ability to produce ultra-short waves.
The length of the average radio wave
is about I.OCO feet; Klystron waves
come as short as four inches. Be
cause of this, frequencies 3,000 times
higher than normal radio frequen
cies can now be obtained.
Stanford has also had a part in the
perfection of the University of Cali
fornia's famed cyclotron, through
the work of Professor Felix Bloch
of the Farm's physics department.
Working in conjunction with Pro
fessor Luis W. Alvarez of the Ber
keley institution, he has found a
new measurement of the neutron's
infinitesimal strength, accurate to
within 1 per cent.
The Stanford department of chem
istry is one of the outstanding in
the country. Much of this depart
ment's fame can be traced to the
work of the late Professor E. C.
Franklin, whose discoveries in the
field of liquid ammonia have been
the basis of several important chem
ical processes. Also outstanding has
been the work in the field of indus
trial waste products, carried on un
der the direction of Professors R. E.
Swain and J. R. Mitchell.
Stanford biochemists have com

bined the work of Drs. E. W. Schults
and Hubert S. Loring of the physi
ology department with discoveries ]
j in ultracentrifuge of the chemistry
department to make important dis
j coveries in the isolation of the in
j fantile paralysis virus.
The Stanford School of Medicine
j got into the nation's headlines a short
j time ago with the announcement
j that its researchers had discovered
j a drug for the treatment of syphilis
which could be swallowed in cap
-1 sule form and taken into the blood
' stream through the stomach wall, j

This drug, recently accepted by the
Council on Pharmacy and Chem
istry of the American Medical Asso
ciation, is regarded by the medical
profession as one of the most prom
ising of all weapons for combating
syphilis.
Stanford Medical School profes
sors have also carried on conclusive
experiments into the treatment of
"San Joaquin Valley fever," an en
demic disease which threatens the
health of California agricultural
workers.
One of the most famous fields of

scientific research at Stanford has
been that of fisheries. David Starr
Jordan, the University's first Presi
dent, laid the foundation for this j
research with the foundation of the I

now-famous Jordan fish collection.
Much of the work of this depart
ment has been in the field of salmon
conservation. It was in Stanford

standing-wave pattern in the glass tube held by Professor W. W. Hansen. The Klystron is now being manufactured commercially.
laboratories that the amazing life
cycle of the salmon, with its annual
trip up the stream where it was
spawned, was first studied.
A little while ago the Stanford
researchers were asked to solve an
unusual problem posed by the
construction fo the Shasta Dam. It
seemed that the dam would cut off
all salmon-spawning areas above it—
the Sacramento, Pit and McCloud
rivers and their tributaries.
As a solution, Stanford scientists
decided to change the life habits of
the salmon! The fish will be cap
tured in weirs below the dam, then
gathered and transported in special
tank trucks to two creeks below
the dam. After this process has been
repeated for a few years, it is ex
pected that the salmon will auto
matically return to their new home,
since most of them by that time will
have been bom there!
Ryan Laboratory
One of the greatest research labo
ratories at Stanford is housed in a
huge grey barn situated to the south
west of the University proper. It is
the Harris J. Ryan High-Voltage
Laboratory, in which is housed
equipment capable of producing
2,400,000 volts, and of throwing a
spark 30 feet long.
Ten years ago in this laboratory
scientists tackled the problem of
transporting electricity from Boul
der Dam to Los Angeles—27s miles.
To do this, they had to find a way
to produce 287,000 volts, a then un
heard-of amount.
With the help of a "weather tube"
and other unique apparatus, the re
searchers tested hundreds of differ
ent kinds of conductors, trying to
find the one which would carry high
voltage the best. And, finally, an
insulator was found which stood
830,000 volts—and Los Angeles' prob
lem was solved.
The phenomenon of earthquake,
needless to say, is not unknown to

Stanford. In the laboratory under
the direction of Professor Lydik S.
Jacobsen exhaustive researches have
been made into characteristics of
this type of disaster, and of the type
of building that will resist it.

held so jealously by nature, and in

Ryan Laboratory
One of the greatest research labo
ratories at Stanford is housed in a
huge grey barn situated to the south
west of the University proper. It is
the Harris J. Ryan High-Voltage
Laboratory, in which is housed
equipment capable of producing
2,400,000 volts, and of throwing a
spark 30 feet long.
Ten years ago in this laboratory
scientists tackled the problem of
transporting electricity from Boul
der Dam to Los Angeles—27s miles.
To do this, they had to find a way
to produce 287,000 volts, a then un
heard-of amount.
With the help of a "weather tube"
and other unique apparatus, the re
searchers tested hundreds of differ
ent kinds of conductors, trying to
find the one which would carry high
voltage the best. And, finally, an
insulator was found which stood
830,000 volts—and Los Angeles' prob
lem was solved.
The phenomenon of earthquake,
needless to say, is not unknown to

Stanford. In the laboratory under
the direction of Professor Lydik S.
Jacobsen exhaustive researches have
been made into characteristics of
this type of disaster, and of the type
of building that will resist it.

This has been but a short sum

The most famous Stanford research
product in recent years is the Kly
stron, which was developed in Farm
laboratories by Sigurd and Russell
Varian, Dr. William W. Hansen -and
Dr. David L. Webster. This amazing
invention, now under manufacture
by the Sperry Gyroscope Company,
enables a ship or plane to determine
the distance of any object which may
be in front of it, is capable of send
ing several hundred thousand si
multaneous telephone conversations
through a hollow pipe, and provides
a blind landing for planes.

The secret of the Klystron is its
ability to produce ultra-short waves.
The length of the average radio wave
is about I.OCO feet; Klystron waves
come as short as four inches. Be
cause of this, frequencies 3,000 times
higher than normal radio frequen
cies can now be obtained.
Stanford has also had a part in the
perfection of the University of Cali
fornia's famed cyclotron, through
the work of Professor Felix Bloch
of the Farm's physics department.
Working in conjunction with Pro
fessor Luis W. Alvarez of the Ber

infinitesimal strength, accurate to
within 1 per cent.

spawned, was first studied.
A little while ago the Stanford
researchers were asked to solve an
unusual problem posed by the
construction fo the Shasta Dam. It
seemed that the dam would cut off
all salmon-spawning areas above it—
the Sacramento, Pit and McCloud
rivers and their tributaries.
As a solution, Stanford scientists
decided to change the life habits of
the salmon! The fish will be cap
tured in weirs below the dam, then
gathered and transported in special
tank trucks to two creeks below
the dam. After this process has been
repeated for a few years, it is ex

Ryan Laboratory
One of the greatest research labo
ratories at Stanford is housed in a
huge grey barn situated to the south
west of the University proper. It is
the Harris J. Ryan High-Voltage
Laboratory, in which is housed
equipment capable of producing
2,400,000 volts, and of throwing a
spark 30 feet long.
Ten years ago in this laboratory
scientists tackled the problem of
transporting electricity from Boul
der Dam to Los Angeles—27s miles.
To do this, they had to find a way
to produce 287,000 volts, a then un
heard-of amount.
With the help of a "weather tube"
and other unique apparatus, the re
searchers tested hundreds of differ
ent kinds of conductors, trying to
find the one which would carry high
voltage the best. And, finally, an
insulator was found which stood
830,000 volts—and Los Angeles' prob
lem was solved.
The phenomenon of earthquake,
needless to say, is not unknown to

Stanford. In the laboratory under
the direction of Professor Lydik S.
Jacobsen exhaustive researches have
been made into characteristics of
this type of disaster, and of the type
of building that will resist it.
'Quake Phenomena
This has been but a short sum
mary of the most important of the
scientific discoveries made at Stan
ford; every day in the laboratories
and the fields of the University, men
are working to discover the secrets
held so jealously by nature, and in
doing so are contributing to the ad
vancement of civilization.
When Senator Stanford founded
the University 50 years ago, he began
not only an institution for the edu

also a great laboratory from which
were to come some of the century';
greatest discoveries in scientific
fields.
The most famous Stanford research
product in recent years is the Kly
stron, which was developed in Farm
laboratories by Sigurd and Russell
Varian, Dr. William W. Hansen -and
Dr. David L. Webster. This amazing
invention, now under manufacture
by the Sperry Gyroscope Company,
enables a ship or plane to determine
the distance of any object which may
be in front of it, is capable of send
ing several hundred thousand si
multaneous telephone conversations
through a hollow pipe, and provides
a blind landing for planes.
Klystron's Secret
The secret of the Klystron is its
ability to produce ultra-short waves.
The length of the average radio wave
is about I.OCO feet; Klystron waves
come as short as four inches. Be
cause of this, frequencies 3,000 times
higher than normal radio frequen
cies can now be obtained.
Stanford has also had a part in the
perfection of the University of Cali
fornia's famed cyclotron, through
the work of Professor Felix Bloch
of the Farm's physics department.
Working in conjunction with Pro
fessor Luis W. Alvarez of the Ber
keley institution, he has found a
new measurement of the neutron's
infinitesimal strength, accurate to
within 1 per cent.
The Stanford department of chem
istry is one of the outstanding in
the country. Much of this depart
ment's fame can be traced to the
work of the late Professor E. C.
Franklin, whose discoveries in the
field of liquid ammonia have been
the basis of several important chem
ical processes. Also outstanding has
been the work in the field of indus
trial waste products, carried on un
der the direction of Professors R. E.
Swain and J. R. Mitchell.

find the one which would carry high
voltage the best. And, finally, an
insulator was found which stood
830,000 volts—and Los Angeles' prob
lem was solved.
The phenomenon of earthquake,
needless to say, is not unknown to

Stanford. In the laboratory under
the direction of Professor Lydik S.
Jacobsen exhaustive researches have
been made into characteristics of
this type of disaster, and of the type
of building that will resist it.
'Quake Phenomena
This has been but a short sum
mary of the most important of the
scientific discoveries made at Stan
ford; every day in the laboratories
and the fields of the University, men
are working to discover the secrets
held so jealously by nature, and in
doing so are contributing to the ad
vancement of civilization.
When Senator Stanford founded
the University 50 years ago, he began
not only an institution for the edu
cation of the country's youth, but
also a great laboratory from which
were to come some of the century';
greatest discoveries in scientific
fields.
The most famous Stanford research
product in recent years is the Kly
stron, which was developed in Farm
laboratories by Sigurd and Russell
Varian, Dr. William W. Hansen -and
Dr. David L. Webster. This amazing
invention, now under manufacture
by the Sperry Gyroscope Company,
enables a ship or plane to determine
the distance of any object which may
be in front of it, is capable of send
ing several hundred thousand si
multaneous telephone conversations
through a hollow pipe, and provides
a blind landing for planes.
Klystron's Secret
The secret of the Klystron is its
ability to produce ultra-short waves.
The length of the average radio wave
is about I.OCO feet; Klystron waves
come as short as four inches. Be
cause of this, frequencies 3,000 times
higher than normal radio frequen
cies can now be obtained.
Stanford has also had a part in the
perfection of the University of Cali
fornia's famed cyclotron, through
the work of Professor Felix Bloch
of the Farm's physics department.
Working in conjunction with Pro
fessor Luis W. Alvarez of the Ber
keley institution, he has found a
new measurement of the neutron's
infinitesimal strength, accurate to
within 1 per cent.
The Stanford department of chem
istry is one of the outstanding in
the country. Much of this depart
ment's fame can be traced to the
work of the late Professor E. C.
Franklin, whose discoveries in the
field of liquid ammonia have been
the basis of several important chem
ical processes. Also outstanding has
been the work in the field of indus
trial waste products, carried on un
der the direction of Professors R. E.
Swain and J. R. Mitchell.
Stanford biochemists have com

bined the work of Drs. E. W. Schults
and Hubert S. Loring of the physi
ology department with discoveries ]
j in ultracentrifuge of the chemistry
department to make important dis
j coveries in the isolation of the in
j fantile paralysis virus.
The Stanford School of Medicine
j got into the nation's headlines a short
j time ago with the announcement
j that its researchers had discovered
j a drug for the treatment of syphilis
which could be swallowed in cap
-1 sule form and taken into the blood
' stream through the stomach wall, j

This drug, recently accepted by the
Council on Pharmacy and Chem
istry of the American Medical Asso
ciation, is regarded by the medical
profession as one of the most prom
ising of all weapons for combating
syphilis.
Stanford Medical School profes
sors have also carried on conclusive
experiments into the treatment of
"San Joaquin Valley fever," an en
demic disease which threatens the
health of California agricultural
workers.
One of the most famous fields of

scientific research at Stanford has
been that of fisheries. David Starr
Jordan, the University's first Presi
dent, laid the foundation for this j
research with the foundation of the I

now-famous Jordan fish collection.
Much of the work of this depart
ment has been in the field of salmon
conservation. It was in Stanford

standing-wave pattern in the glass tube held by Professor W. W. Hansen. The Klystron is now being manufactured commercially.
laboratories that the amazing life
cycle of the salmon, with its annual
trip up the stream where it was
spawned, was first studied.
A little while ago the Stanford
researchers were asked to solve an
unusual problem posed by the
construction fo the Shasta Dam. It
seemed that the dam would cut off
all salmon-spawning areas above it—
the Sacramento, Pit and McCloud
rivers and their tributaries.
As a solution, Stanford scientists
decided to change the life habits of
the salmon! The fish will be cap
tured in weirs below the dam, then
gathered and transported in special
tank trucks to two creeks below
the dam. After this process has been
repeated for a few years, it is ex
pected that the salmon will auto
matically return to their new home,
since most of them by that time will
have been bom there!
Ryan Laboratory
One of the greatest research labo
ratories at Stanford is housed in a
huge grey barn situated to the south
west of the University proper. It is
the Harris J. Ryan High-Voltage
Laboratory, in which is housed
equipment capable of producing
2,400,000 volts, and of throwing a
spark 30 feet long.
Ten years ago in this laboratory
scientists tackled the problem of
transporting electricity from Boul
der Dam to Los Angeles—27s miles.
To do this, they had to find a way
to produce 287,000 volts, a then un
heard-of amount.
With the help of a "weather tube"
and other unique apparatus, the re
searchers tested hundreds of differ
ent kinds of conductors, trying to
find the one which would carry high
voltage the best. And, finally, an
insulator was found which stood
830,000 volts—and Los Angeles' prob
lem was solved.
