# New Boathouse Abets Romance
## 
### 
Stanford's Boathouse, in
to being the center of activity for
the Farm's spring quarter week-end
activities, furnishes room and em
ployment to four Stanford men, who
act as caretakers and lifeguards.
For many years the old Boathouse
was known as a campus "eyesore"
and was in universal disfavor. The
original plans had made no at
tempt to fit the Boathouse in with
(he general architectural style of
the rest of the University buildings,
and the place was shaky and in need
of painting and repairs. The Boat- j
house solved the problem by falling
down.
Matter Dropped
The culmination of the Conva
lescent Home Drive of 1938 was
also the end of the Boathouse.
Twenty-five students were gathered
on the upper balcony when it gave i
way on the afternoon of May 6 and
fell into the lake, carrying all of
them with it. Two were severely
enough injured to require hospi
talization, while several others were
less badly hurt. The story made
headlines all over the country, a
picture of the collapsed structure
being carried in the New York
Times.

► It was decided by the Executive'
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents to let the matter drop for the
rest of the academic year, and at
the beginning of the next year it
was even proposed that no new
building be erected.
Special Funds
Campus opinion, however, was so
strongly in favor of a new Boathouse
that the Executive Committee de
cided to sound out the University
on possibilities of obtaining funds.
Although the Administration pointed
out the fact that the building was
entirely for the benefit of students
and that they could not hope for
financial help, it was decided to go
ahead with plans, raise the money
somehow, and build a new Boat
house.
It was on October 18, 1938. that
it was finally decided to erect the
building, and bids and plans were
called for immediately. Construc
tion started on December 1, 1938,
and the new Boathouse was for
mally dedicated on March 4. 1939.
Money for the structure was ad
vanced out of special funds of the
A.S.S.U., and is being paid back
gradually under the auspices of the
Cardinals, campus service organiza
tion, which has worked the original

>$10,000 deficit down to approxi
mately $7,000.
The Boathouse, and swimming in
the lake, is open for about four and
one-half months of the school year.
Starting around the first of March,
the season lasts just as long as does
the water in the overflow-fed lake.
Present upperclassmen still remem
ber, however, that the Boathouse
had a particularly bad beginning,
for the season of 1939 did not run
true to form and lasted only about
three weeks.
The present Boathouse furnishes
space for about 55 canoes, as well
as housing six sailboats, and two
rowboats that are maintained by the
A.S.S.U. Durint? the earlv narl nf

the season the lake is open only
during the afternoon hours, but the
latter part of the Spring Quarter it
is maintained on a twelve - hour
basis, from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m.
Student caretakers at the Boat
house live there throughout the
school year, paying $60 a year for
their room. During the time tha 1
the lake and Boathouse are open
they receive 50 cents an hour dur
ing the time that they are on duty.
The first $60 of earnings is paid back
into the A.S.S.U. office to pay for
their rent.
The lake itself is a man-made
affair, being filled during the winter
months by the overflow water from
Searsville Lake. This water usually
begins to fill Lagunita during the
early part of December and keeps
rising until the end of the l'ainy
season. All water stays in the lake
until the depth is about 17 feet, and
excess is taken care of by a spillway
that allows the water to flow down
into San Francisquito Creek and
from there into the bay.
The main use of the lake during
the dry parts of the year comes in
the middle of fall quarter, during
Big Game Week and its attendant
festivities, when freshmen tradi
tionally build the "biggest and best
yet" in the way of Big Game Bon
fires, to be set off at the culmination
of the Big Game Rally on the Thurs
day night preceding the game.
The first University post office was
established in a small wooden build
ing on the site of the present Memo
rial Church in May, 1893. The pres
ent post office on Lasuen was built
in 1900.

the season the lake is open only
during the afternoon hours, but the
latter part of the Spring Quarter it
is maintained on a twelve - hour
basis, from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m.
Student caretakers at the Boat
house live there throughout the
school year, paying $60 a year for
their room. During the time tha 1
the lake and Boathouse are open
they receive 50 cents an hour dur

The first $60 of earnings is paid back
into the A.S.S.U. office to pay for
their rent.
The lake itself is a man-made
affair, being filled during the winter
months by the overflow water from
Searsville Lake. This water usually
begins to fill Lagunita during the
early part of December and keeps
rising until the end of the l'ainy
season. All water stays in the lake
until the depth is about 17 feet, and
excess is taken care of by a spillway
that allows the water to flow down
into San Francisquito Creek and
from there into the bay.
The main use of the lake during
the dry parts of the year comes in
the middle of fall quarter, during
Big Game Week and its attendant
festivities, when freshmen tradi
tionally build the "biggest and best
yet" in the way of Big Game Bon
fires, to be set off at the culmination
of the Big Game Rally on the Thurs
day night preceding the game.

Stanford's Boathouse, in

activities, furnishes room and em

act as caretakers and lifeguards.
For many years the old Boathouse
was known as a campus "eyesore"
and was in universal disfavor. The
original plans had made no at
tempt to fit the Boathouse in with

the rest of the University buildings,
and the place was shaky and in need
of painting and repairs. The Boat- j
house solved the problem by falling
down.

The culmination of the Conva

also the end of the Boathouse.
Twenty-five students were gathered
on the upper balcony when it gave i

fell into the lake, carrying all of
them with it. Two were severely

less badly hurt. The story made
headlines all over the country, a

being carried in the New York

Campus opinion, however, was so
strongly in favor of a new Boathouse
that the Executive Committee de

on possibilities of obtaining funds.
Although the Administration pointed
out the fact that the building was
entirely for the benefit of students
and that they could not hope for
financial help, it was decided to go
ahead with plans, raise the money
somehow, and build a new Boat
house.
It was on October 18, 1938. that
it was finally decided to erect the
building, and bids and plans were
called for immediately. Construc

The Boathouse, and swimming in

Starting around the first of March,
the season lasts just as long as does

Student caretakers at the Boat
house live there throughout the
school year, paying $60 a year for
their room. During the time tha 1
the lake and Boathouse are open
they receive 50 cents an hour dur

The first $60 of earnings is paid back
into the A.S.S.U. office to pay for
their rent.
The lake itself is a man-made
affair, being filled during the winter
months by the overflow water from
Searsville Lake. This water usually
begins to fill Lagunita during the
early part of December and keeps
rising until the end of the l'ainy
season. All water stays in the lake
until the depth is about 17 feet, and
excess is taken care of by a spillway
that allows the water to flow down
into San Francisquito Creek and
from there into the bay.
The main use of the lake during
the dry parts of the year comes in
the middle of fall quarter, during
Big Game Week and its attendant
festivities, when freshmen tradi

yet" in the way of Big Game Bon
fires, to be set off at the culmination

Twenty-five students were gathered
on the upper balcony when it gave i

fell into the lake, carrying all of
them with it. Two were severely
