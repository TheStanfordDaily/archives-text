# Amphitheater Opens in '37
## 
### 
In May, 1884, Leland Stanford, Jr.,<
died in Italy. His bereaved parents
erected Stanford University to his
memory.
In May, 1935, John Laurence Frost,
a Stanford student, died in Italy. Mr.
and Mrs. Howard Frost endowed the
Frost Amphitheater to the memory
of their son.
Since June, 1937, commencement
at Stanford has been held in the bowl
and each black-robed processional
has been a living memorial to the
young man who died that summer,
far away from Stanford and his
friends.
Complete Isolation
Complete isolation in this "natural"
theater is enjoyed by commencement
audiences and those who attend vari
ous other University functions. The
arboreal splendor of the bowl was
achieved by transplanting over 2,000
different large trees within the am
phitheater.
Although the bowl was originally
planned to exclude from view any
commonplaces of the campus even
over the rim, the plan has been ob
viated by the construction of the

►Hoover Memorial. The tower of this
structure is plainly visible over the
front rim of the theater, but it is con
sidered an addition rather than a
detriment.
During the construction of the nat
ural green-rimmed theater, the
builders were halted in their work
time and again by poor weather and
coast shipping tie-ups. The class of
'37 typified the old "off again, on
again, Finnegan" line. For a while
| they were going to graduate in the
amphitheater; then they weren't;
then, finally, they were.
Frost Memorial
On June 13, 1937, the memorial to
, John Laurence Frost fulfilled its pur
pose. Eleven hundred and fifty stu
, dents solemn in black caps and
I gowns, marched down the circular
! paths into the bowl, the absence of
the one dramatized and recalled by
the presence of the many in the verd
! ant surroundings of the amphitheater.
And as each year's graduating
class files in dignified queus into the
bowl, the memory of Laurence Frost
is kept alive through the graduation
ceremonies he never saw.

the one dramatized and recalled by
the presence of the many in the verd
! ant surroundings of the amphitheater.
And as each year's graduating
class files in dignified queus into the
bowl, the memory of Laurence Frost
is kept alive through the graduation
ceremonies he never saw.
In May, 1884, Leland Stanford, Jr.,<
died in Italy. His bereaved parents
erected Stanford University to his
memory.
In May, 1935, John Laurence Frost,
a Stanford student, died in Italy. Mr.
and Mrs. Howard Frost endowed the
Frost Amphitheater to the memory
of their son.
Since June, 1937, commencement
at Stanford has been held in the bowl
and each black-robed processional
has been a living memorial to the
young man who died that summer,
far away from Stanford and his
friends.
Complete Isolation
Complete isolation in this "natural"
theater is enjoyed by commencement
audiences and those who attend vari
ous other University functions. The
arboreal splendor of the bowl was
achieved by transplanting over 2,000
different large trees within the am
phitheater.
Although the bowl was originally
planned to exclude from view any
commonplaces of the campus even
over the rim, the plan has been ob
viated by the construction of the

►Hoover Memorial. The tower of this
structure is plainly visible over the
front rim of the theater, but it is con
sidered an addition rather than a
detriment.
During the construction of the nat
ural green-rimmed theater, the
builders were halted in their work
time and again by poor weather and
coast shipping tie-ups. The class of
'37 typified the old "off again, on
again, Finnegan" line. For a while
| they were going to graduate in the
amphitheater; then they weren't;
then, finally, they were.
Frost Memorial
On June 13, 1937, the memorial to
, John Laurence Frost fulfilled its pur
pose. Eleven hundred and fifty stu
, dents solemn in black caps and
I gowns, marched down the circular
! paths into the bowl, the absence of
the one dramatized and recalled by
the presence of the many in the verd
! ant surroundings of the amphitheater.
