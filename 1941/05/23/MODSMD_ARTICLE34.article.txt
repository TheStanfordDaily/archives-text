Residences on the campus, with j
i the exception of the Stanford home,
the President's house, and the origi
| nal Escondite Cottage, were confined
to Alvarado, Salvatierra, and Lasuen
streets unti 1900. The first home to
be erected on the hills above the red
roofed Quad was that of Mr. Charles
G. Lathrop, treasurer and business
manager of the University.

In an interview with the New York
Herald, March 23, 1885, Senator
Stanford answered rumors that the
loss of his son had in a measure un
settled his mind.
In refuting the reports of ill-wish
ers, Senator Stanford denied obtrud
ing his grief on the public, giving as
reports, a plan to devote his estate to
"public and beneficent purposes."


WARM SUNLIGHT AND BLUE SKIES seemed to presage a great future for Stanford on the day of its opening in
1891. Four hundred and sixty-five students were present, along with Dr. David Starr Jordan and his faculty of
fifteen and Governor and Mrs. Stanford. The speakers' stand (above) was erected at the west end of the Inner
Quadrangle. Governor Stanford spoke: "... It is our hope that the young women and the young men who grad
uate from Palo Alto shall not only be scholars, but have a sound practical idea of commonplace, everyday matters,
a self-reliance that will fit them, in case of emergency . . ." The above scene took place October 1, 1891.
