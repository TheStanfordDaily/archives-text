# FAMED AXE REGAINED BY 'IMMORTAL 21'
## 
### 
Once a shining, glorious symbol of<
a savage rivalry—a symbol over
which two great student bodies
fought for 30-odd years—the Stan
ford Axe has gone the way of many
of its fellow traditions in the soften
ing up of the new generation.
In the interest of law and order,
the beloved blade has been relegated
to the status of the middle west's
Little Brown Jug. Twenty-two men
now compete where before the keen
est minds and strongest arms of two
generations of Stanford and Cal men
bitterly contested en masse the pos
session of the cardinal symbol.
It leans quietly against the back
of its case in the Union. But you
may be sure that if ever it were dis
turbed by means other than a Cal
gridiron victory, the brilliant herit
age of a fighting young university
would burst out in full array; this
despite the fact that we have junked
almost all our domestic traditions.
Respected Tradition
The Axe alone, of all our tradi
tions, still commands respect. It's
great history was made up for the
most part of a thirty-year period in
which the living Stanford was pre
occupied with the return of the Axe,
the hope and dream of all real Stan
ford men from 1899 to the glorious
day of April 6, 1930.
When Stanford first opened its
gates in the early years of the 'nine
ties, the Cardinal upstarts from down
on the Farm lost no time in estab
lishing athletic supremacy over Cali
fornia. Not only did Stanford win
the first fotball game in 1892 but
the Cardinal baseball team lost only
one series until 1899.
In that year, a tragedy struck the
Farm when George Beckett, captain
and star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. A symbol of some kind
was needed desperately to rekindle
the spirit and on April 13, 1899, the
Axe was born.
Yell Introduced
In 1896, Will Irwin and Chris
Bradley had introduced the Axe yell
which inspired the introduction of
the massive hatchet three years later
at the first Bonfire. On the eve of

the Cal series, this new symbol of
Stanford spirit was sharpened to
razor edge on a huge grindstone and
then used to chop off the head of the
Golden Bear effigy, while the wild
eyed student body went crazy with
revamped enthusiasm.
The great red axe went with Stan
ford to the game. The Cardinals
were beaten; but a far greater trag
edy was to befall the supporters of
L.S.J.U. Billy Erb and Frank Eng
lish, who had introduced the axe,
entrusted it to four guards at the
game.
Then began a fight which raged
over San Francisco for seven hours;
and the last Stanford man to be torn
from the axe was Tom McFadden,
200-opund tackle. Cal men started
relaying the axe through Chinatown
ind across town to the ferry. Once,

a Stanford hurdler named Stout, who
had been biding his time, was handed
the axe unwittingly by Bill Drumm
of Cal; but the wonder quarterback
of Berkeley, Jimmy Hopper, caught
the Stanford man from behind with
a flying tackle in the middle of San
Francisco and the race across town
again started.
Unsuccessful Efforts
"Crazy Joe" Hamilton made Stan
ford's last desperate bid when he
took on a whole streetcar load of Cal
men who had just chopped off the
handle of the axe in a Chinatown
butcher shop.
In the next few days in Berkeley,
Harry Dutton had his hands on it
twice only to succumb to the huge
weight of numbers. A raid was
staged on the Chi Psi house where
Charlie Pringle, football captain and

♦first custodian of the axe, lived and 4
the house was actually torn apart
in vain. The axe was lodged firmly
in the vaults of the Berkeley Ameri
can Trust.
Will Irwin's famous battle of the
Senior Fence was a fruitless Stan
ford victory. It was Will's idea to
capture this famous trophy of Cal's
and hold it as hostage, but for some
strange reason the men of Berkeley
allowed Stanford to keep and burn
the Fence, and the Axe continued to
reside in the vaults.
For years ingenious vchemes were
put into effect and brute force raids
were carried out, but to no avail.
Axe Regained
Then on April 6, 1930, Stanford re
gained the Axe. The "Immortal 21"
were organized by Don Kropp in
1927, a band made up of die-hard
"roughs" from Sequoia. Twice they
had been within an ace of recover
ing the famed weapon. Moroni
Jameson actually carried the Axe
into the Berkeley bank, but was so
completely surrounded that he could
not escape. A second raid was almost
successful but a body of Berkeley
reserves arrived in time to beat off
| the attackers.
Then, on the fateful Thursday
morning, the "21" slipped quietly
away from the campus in three cars.
| They rented a fourth car in Oakland,
i Occupants of one car went directly
to the Greek Theatre, the second
j group joined the Cal frosh in their
march to Ihe bank, the third parked
two blocks from the bank, and the
fourth was right at the bank.
Men Deploy
All but five of the men at the rally

►3dged their way to positions close
to the ceremonies. Ten minutes be
fore the rally closed, the remaining
five left the Theatre to take up posts
near the armored car. These were
the fake cameramen, who delayed
proceedings so that the other con
spirators could join the frosh guards
on the car's running boards. As soon
as the car pulled away, the "camera
men" raced back to the bank.
When the car arrived at the bank
they started asking for pictures again
and as the Axe Custodian stepped
out of the armored car onto the side
walk, a flash-bulb exploded right in
his face. A Stanford man jumped
down off the top of the car, wrenched
the Axe from the custodian's hands
and passed it through several hands.
The last Stanford man to get it,
calmly tucked it under his sweater,
walked to his car and drove away.
'Immortal 21'
At Stanford, the campus went
crazy. Newspapers all over the
country played up the daring raid.
After two years in the American
Trust of Palo Alto, the Axe was put
up as the official Big Game trophy.

ford worships—Sequoia's "Immortal

tions, still commands respect. It's
great history was made up for the
most part of a thirty-year period in
which the living Stanford was pre
occupied with the return of the Axe,
the hope and dream of all real Stan
ford men from 1899 to the glorious
day of April 6, 1930.
When Stanford first opened its
gates in the early years of the 'nine
ties, the Cardinal upstarts from down
on the Farm lost no time in estab
lishing athletic supremacy over Cali
fornia. Not only did Stanford win
the first fotball game in 1892 but
the Cardinal baseball team lost only
one series until 1899.
In that year, a tragedy struck the
Farm when George Beckett, captain
and star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. A symbol of some kind
was needed desperately to rekindle
the spirit and on April 13, 1899, the
Axe was born.
Yell Introduced
In 1896, Will Irwin and Chris
Bradley had introduced the Axe yell
which inspired the introduction of
the massive hatchet three years later
at the first Bonfire. On the eve of

the Cal series, this new symbol of
Stanford spirit was sharpened to
razor edge on a huge grindstone and
then used to chop off the head of the
Golden Bear effigy, while the wild
eyed student body went crazy with
revamped enthusiasm.
The great red axe went with Stan
ford to the game. The Cardinals
were beaten; but a far greater trag
edy was to befall the supporters of
L.S.J.U. Billy Erb and Frank Eng
lish, who had introduced the axe,
entrusted it to four guards at the
game.
Then began a fight which raged
over San Francisco for seven hours;
and the last Stanford man to be torn
from the axe was Tom McFadden,
200-opund tackle. Cal men started
relaying the axe through Chinatown
ind across town to the ferry. Once,

a Stanford hurdler named Stout, who
had been biding his time, was handed
the axe unwittingly by Bill Drumm
of Cal; but the wonder quarterback
of Berkeley, Jimmy Hopper, caught
the Stanford man from behind with
a flying tackle in the middle of San
Francisco and the race across town
again started.
Unsuccessful Efforts
"Crazy Joe" Hamilton made Stan
ford's last desperate bid when he
took on a whole streetcar load of Cal
men who had just chopped off the
handle of the axe in a Chinatown
butcher shop.
In the next few days in Berkeley,
Harry Dutton had his hands on it
twice only to succumb to the huge
weight of numbers. A raid was
staged on the Chi Psi house where
Charlie Pringle, football captain and

♦first custodian of the axe, lived and 4
the house was actually torn apart
in vain. The axe was lodged firmly
in the vaults of the Berkeley Ameri
can Trust.
Will Irwin's famous battle of the
Senior Fence was a fruitless Stan
ford victory. It was Will's idea to
capture this famous trophy of Cal's
and hold it as hostage, but for some
strange reason the men of Berkeley
allowed Stanford to keep and burn
the Fence, and the Axe continued to
reside in the vaults.
For years ingenious vchemes were
put into effect and brute force raids
were carried out, but to no avail.
Axe Regained
Then on April 6, 1930, Stanford re
gained the Axe. The "Immortal 21"
were organized by Don Kropp in
1927, a band made up of die-hard
"roughs" from Sequoia. Twice they
had been within an ace of recover
ing the famed weapon. Moroni
Jameson actually carried the Axe
into the Berkeley bank, but was so
completely surrounded that he could
not escape. A second raid was almost
successful but a body of Berkeley
reserves arrived in time to beat off
| the attackers.
Then, on the fateful Thursday
morning, the "21" slipped quietly
away from the campus in three cars.
| They rented a fourth car in Oakland,
i Occupants of one car went directly
to the Greek Theatre, the second
j group joined the Cal frosh in their
march to Ihe bank, the third parked
two blocks from the bank, and the
fourth was right at the bank.
Men Deploy
All but five of the men at the rally

►3dged their way to positions close
to the ceremonies. Ten minutes be
fore the rally closed, the remaining
five left the Theatre to take up posts
near the armored car. These were
the fake cameramen, who delayed
proceedings so that the other con
spirators could join the frosh guards
on the car's running boards. As soon
as the car pulled away, the "camera
men" raced back to the bank.
When the car arrived at the bank
they started asking for pictures again
and as the Axe Custodian stepped
out of the armored car onto the side
walk, a flash-bulb exploded right in
his face. A Stanford man jumped
down off the top of the car, wrenched
the Axe from the custodian's hands
and passed it through several hands.
The last Stanford man to get it,
calmly tucked it under his sweater,
walked to his car and drove away.
'Immortal 21'
At Stanford, the campus went
crazy. Newspapers all over the
country played up the daring raid.
After two years in the American
Trust of Palo Alto, the Axe was put
up as the official Big Game trophy.

ford worships—Sequoia's "Immortal

fought for 30-odd years—the Stan
ford Axe has gone the way of many
of its fellow traditions in the soften

In the interest of law and order,
the beloved blade has been relegated
to the status of the middle west's
Little Brown Jug. Twenty-two men
now compete where before the keen
est minds and strongest arms of two
generations of Stanford and Cal men
bitterly contested en masse the pos
session of the cardinal symbol.
It leans quietly against the back

Bradley had introduced the Axe yell
which inspired the introduction of
the massive hatchet three years later
at the first Bonfire. On the eve of

the Cal series, this new symbol of
Stanford spirit was sharpened to
razor edge on a huge grindstone and
then used to chop off the head of the
Golden Bear effigy, while the wild
eyed student body went crazy with
revamped enthusiasm.
The great red axe went with Stan
ford to the game. The Cardinals
were beaten; but a far greater trag
edy was to befall the supporters of
L.S.J.U. Billy Erb and Frank Eng
lish, who had introduced the axe,
entrusted it to four guards at the
game.
Then began a fight which raged
over San Francisco for seven hours;
and the last Stanford man to be torn
from the axe was Tom McFadden,
200-opund tackle. Cal men started
relaying the axe through Chinatown
ind across town to the ferry. Once,

a Stanford hurdler named Stout, who
had been biding his time, was handed
the axe unwittingly by Bill Drumm
of Cal; but the wonder quarterback
of Berkeley, Jimmy Hopper, caught
the Stanford man from behind with
a flying tackle in the middle of San
Francisco and the race across town
again started.
Unsuccessful Efforts
"Crazy Joe" Hamilton made Stan
ford's last desperate bid when he
took on a whole streetcar load of Cal
men who had just chopped off the
handle of the axe in a Chinatown
butcher shop.
In the next few days in Berkeley,
Harry Dutton had his hands on it
twice only to succumb to the huge
weight of numbers. A raid was
staged on the Chi Psi house where
Charlie Pringle, football captain and

♦first custodian of the axe, lived and 4
the house was actually torn apart
in vain. The axe was lodged firmly
in the vaults of the Berkeley Ameri
can Trust.
Will Irwin's famous battle of the
Senior Fence was a fruitless Stan
ford victory. It was Will's idea to
capture this famous trophy of Cal's
and hold it as hostage, but for some
strange reason the men of Berkeley
allowed Stanford to keep and burn
the Fence, and the Axe continued to
reside in the vaults.
For years ingenious vchemes were
put into effect and brute force raids
were carried out, but to no avail.
Axe Regained
Then on April 6, 1930, Stanford re
gained the Axe. The "Immortal 21"
were organized by Don Kropp in
1927, a band made up of die-hard
"roughs" from Sequoia. Twice they
had been within an ace of recover
ing the famed weapon. Moroni
Jameson actually carried the Axe
into the Berkeley bank, but was so
completely surrounded that he could
not escape. A second raid was almost
successful but a body of Berkeley
reserves arrived in time to beat off
| the attackers.
Then, on the fateful Thursday
morning, the "21" slipped quietly
away from the campus in three cars.
| They rented a fourth car in Oakland,
i Occupants of one car went directly
to the Greek Theatre, the second
j group joined the Cal frosh in their
march to Ihe bank, the third parked
two blocks from the bank, and the
fourth was right at the bank.
Men Deploy
All but five of the men at the rally

►3dged their way to positions close
to the ceremonies. Ten minutes be
fore the rally closed, the remaining
five left the Theatre to take up posts
near the armored car. These were
the fake cameramen, who delayed
proceedings so that the other con
spirators could join the frosh guards
on the car's running boards. As soon
as the car pulled away, the "camera
men" raced back to the bank.
When the car arrived at the bank
they started asking for pictures again
and as the Axe Custodian stepped
out of the armored car onto the side
walk, a flash-bulb exploded right in
his face. A Stanford man jumped
down off the top of the car, wrenched
the Axe from the custodian's hands
and passed it through several hands.
The last Stanford man to get it,
calmly tucked it under his sweater,
walked to his car and drove away.
'Immortal 21'
At Stanford, the campus went
crazy. Newspapers all over the
country played up the daring raid.
After two years in the American
Trust of Palo Alto, the Axe was put
up as the official Big Game trophy.

Once a shining, glorious symbol of<
a savage rivalry—a symbol over
which two great student bodies
fought for 30-odd years—the Stan
ford Axe has gone the way of many
of its fellow traditions in the soften
ing up of the new generation.
In the interest of law and order,
the beloved blade has been relegated
to the status of the middle west's
Little Brown Jug. Twenty-two men
now compete where before the keen
est minds and strongest arms of two
generations of Stanford and Cal men
bitterly contested en masse the pos
session of the cardinal symbol.
It leans quietly against the back
of its case in the Union. But you
may be sure that if ever it were dis
turbed by means other than a Cal
gridiron victory, the brilliant herit
age of a fighting young university
would burst out in full array; this
despite the fact that we have junked
almost all our domestic traditions.
Respected Tradition
The Axe alone, of all our tradi
tions, still commands respect. It's
great history was made up for the
most part of a thirty-year period in
which the living Stanford was pre
occupied with the return of the Axe,
the hope and dream of all real Stan
ford men from 1899 to the glorious
day of April 6, 1930.
When Stanford first opened its
gates in the early years of the 'nine
ties, the Cardinal upstarts from down
on the Farm lost no time in estab
lishing athletic supremacy over Cali
fornia. Not only did Stanford win
the first fotball game in 1892 but
the Cardinal baseball team lost only
one series until 1899.
In that year, a tragedy struck the
Farm when George Beckett, captain
and star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. A symbol of some kind
was needed desperately to rekindle
the spirit and on April 13, 1899, the
Axe was born.

had been biding his time, was handed
the axe unwittingly by Bill Drumm
of Cal; but the wonder quarterback
of Berkeley, Jimmy Hopper, caught
the Stanford man from behind with
a flying tackle in the middle of San
Francisco and the race across town
again started.
Unsuccessful Efforts
"Crazy Joe" Hamilton made Stan
ford's last desperate bid when he
took on a whole streetcar load of Cal
men who had just chopped off the
handle of the axe in a Chinatown
butcher shop.
In the next few days in Berkeley,
Harry Dutton had his hands on it
twice only to succumb to the huge
weight of numbers. A raid was
staged on the Chi Psi house where
Charlie Pringle, football captain and

♦first custodian of the axe, lived and 4
the house was actually torn apart
in vain. The axe was lodged firmly
in the vaults of the Berkeley Ameri
can Trust.
Will Irwin's famous battle of the
Senior Fence was a fruitless Stan
ford victory. It was Will's idea to
capture this famous trophy of Cal's
and hold it as hostage, but for some
strange reason the men of Berkeley
allowed Stanford to keep and burn
the Fence, and the Axe continued to
reside in the vaults.
For years ingenious vchemes were
put into effect and brute force raids
were carried out, but to no avail.
Axe Regained
Then on April 6, 1930, Stanford re
gained the Axe. The "Immortal 21"
were organized by Don Kropp in
1927, a band made up of die-hard
"roughs" from Sequoia. Twice they
had been within an ace of recover
ing the famed weapon. Moroni
Jameson actually carried the Axe
into the Berkeley bank, but was so
completely surrounded that he could
not escape. A second raid was almost
successful but a body of Berkeley
reserves arrived in time to beat off
| the attackers.
Then, on the fateful Thursday
morning, the "21" slipped quietly
away from the campus in three cars.
| They rented a fourth car in Oakland,
i Occupants of one car went directly
to the Greek Theatre, the second
j group joined the Cal frosh in their
march to Ihe bank, the third parked
two blocks from the bank, and the
fourth was right at the bank.
Men Deploy
All but five of the men at the rally

►3dged their way to positions close
to the ceremonies. Ten minutes be
fore the rally closed, the remaining
five left the Theatre to take up posts
near the armored car. These were
the fake cameramen, who delayed
proceedings so that the other con
spirators could join the frosh guards
on the car's running boards. As soon
as the car pulled away, the "camera
men" raced back to the bank.
When the car arrived at the bank
they started asking for pictures again
and as the Axe Custodian stepped
out of the armored car onto the side
walk, a flash-bulb exploded right in
his face. A Stanford man jumped
down off the top of the car, wrenched
the Axe from the custodian's hands
and passed it through several hands.
The last Stanford man to get it,
calmly tucked it under his sweater,
walked to his car and drove away.
'Immortal 21'
At Stanford, the campus went
crazy. Newspapers all over the
country played up the daring raid.
After two years in the American
Trust of Palo Alto, the Axe was put
up as the official Big Game trophy.

Once a shining, glorious symbol of<
a savage rivalry—a symbol over
which two great student bodies
fought for 30-odd years—the Stan
ford Axe has gone the way of many
of its fellow traditions in the soften
ing up of the new generation.
In the interest of law and order,
the beloved blade has been relegated
to the status of the middle west's
Little Brown Jug. Twenty-two men
now compete where before the keen
est minds and strongest arms of two
generations of Stanford and Cal men
bitterly contested en masse the pos
session of the cardinal symbol.
It leans quietly against the back
of its case in the Union. But you
may be sure that if ever it were dis
turbed by means other than a Cal
gridiron victory, the brilliant herit
age of a fighting young university
would burst out in full array; this
despite the fact that we have junked
almost all our domestic traditions.
Respected Tradition
The Axe alone, of all our tradi
tions, still commands respect. It's
great history was made up for the
most part of a thirty-year period in
which the living Stanford was pre
occupied with the return of the Axe,
the hope and dream of all real Stan
ford men from 1899 to the glorious
day of April 6, 1930.
When Stanford first opened its
gates in the early years of the 'nine
ties, the Cardinal upstarts from down
on the Farm lost no time in estab
lishing athletic supremacy over Cali
fornia. Not only did Stanford win
the first fotball game in 1892 but
the Cardinal baseball team lost only
one series until 1899.
In that year, a tragedy struck the
Farm when George Beckett, captain
and star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. A symbol of some kind
was needed desperately to rekindle
the spirit and on April 13, 1899, the
Axe was born.
Yell Introduced
In 1896, Will Irwin and Chris
Bradley had introduced the Axe yell
which inspired the introduction of
the massive hatchet three years later
at the first Bonfire. On the eve of

the Cal series, this new symbol of
Stanford spirit was sharpened to
razor edge on a huge grindstone and
then used to chop off the head of the
Golden Bear effigy, while the wild
eyed student body went crazy with
revamped enthusiasm.
The great red axe went with Stan
ford to the game. The Cardinals
were beaten; but a far greater trag
edy was to befall the supporters of
L.S.J.U. Billy Erb and Frank Eng
lish, who had introduced the axe,
entrusted it to four guards at the
game.
Then began a fight which raged
over San Francisco for seven hours;
and the last Stanford man to be torn
from the axe was Tom McFadden,
200-opund tackle. Cal men started
relaying the axe through Chinatown
ind across town to the ferry. Once,

capture this famous trophy of Cal's
and hold it as hostage, but for some
strange reason the men of Berkeley
allowed Stanford to keep and burn
the Fence, and the Axe continued to
reside in the vaults.
For years ingenious vchemes were
put into effect and brute force raids
were carried out, but to no avail.
Axe Regained
Then on April 6, 1930, Stanford re
gained the Axe. The "Immortal 21"
were organized by Don Kropp in
1927, a band made up of die-hard
"roughs" from Sequoia. Twice they
had been within an ace of recover
ing the famed weapon. Moroni
Jameson actually carried the Axe
into the Berkeley bank, but was so
completely surrounded that he could
not escape. A second raid was almost
successful but a body of Berkeley
reserves arrived in time to beat off
| the attackers.
Then, on the fateful Thursday
morning, the "21" slipped quietly
away from the campus in three cars.
| They rented a fourth car in Oakland,
i Occupants of one car went directly
to the Greek Theatre, the second
j group joined the Cal frosh in their
march to Ihe bank, the third parked
two blocks from the bank, and the
fourth was right at the bank.
Men Deploy
All but five of the men at the rally

►3dged their way to positions close
to the ceremonies. Ten minutes be
fore the rally closed, the remaining
five left the Theatre to take up posts
near the armored car. These were
the fake cameramen, who delayed
proceedings so that the other con
spirators could join the frosh guards
on the car's running boards. As soon
as the car pulled away, the "camera
men" raced back to the bank.
When the car arrived at the bank
they started asking for pictures again
and as the Axe Custodian stepped
out of the armored car onto the side
walk, a flash-bulb exploded right in
his face. A Stanford man jumped
down off the top of the car, wrenched
the Axe from the custodian's hands
and passed it through several hands.
The last Stanford man to get it,
calmly tucked it under his sweater,
walked to his car and drove away.
'Immortal 21'
At Stanford, the campus went
crazy. Newspapers all over the
country played up the daring raid.
After two years in the American
Trust of Palo Alto, the Axe was put
up as the official Big Game trophy.

Once a shining, glorious symbol of<
a savage rivalry—a symbol over
which two great student bodies
fought for 30-odd years—the Stan
ford Axe has gone the way of many
of its fellow traditions in the soften
ing up of the new generation.
In the interest of law and order,
the beloved blade has been relegated
to the status of the middle west's
Little Brown Jug. Twenty-two men
now compete where before the keen
est minds and strongest arms of two
generations of Stanford and Cal men
bitterly contested en masse the pos
session of the cardinal symbol.
It leans quietly against the back
of its case in the Union. But you
may be sure that if ever it were dis
turbed by means other than a Cal
gridiron victory, the brilliant herit
age of a fighting young university
would burst out in full array; this
despite the fact that we have junked
almost all our domestic traditions.
Respected Tradition
The Axe alone, of all our tradi
tions, still commands respect. It's
great history was made up for the
most part of a thirty-year period in
which the living Stanford was pre
occupied with the return of the Axe,
the hope and dream of all real Stan
ford men from 1899 to the glorious
day of April 6, 1930.
When Stanford first opened its
gates in the early years of the 'nine
ties, the Cardinal upstarts from down
on the Farm lost no time in estab
lishing athletic supremacy over Cali
fornia. Not only did Stanford win
the first fotball game in 1892 but
the Cardinal baseball team lost only
one series until 1899.
In that year, a tragedy struck the
Farm when George Beckett, captain
and star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. A symbol of some kind
was needed desperately to rekindle
the spirit and on April 13, 1899, the
Axe was born.
Yell Introduced
In 1896, Will Irwin and Chris
Bradley had introduced the Axe yell
which inspired the introduction of
the massive hatchet three years later
at the first Bonfire. On the eve of

the Cal series, this new symbol of
Stanford spirit was sharpened to
razor edge on a huge grindstone and
then used to chop off the head of the
Golden Bear effigy, while the wild
eyed student body went crazy with
revamped enthusiasm.
The great red axe went with Stan
ford to the game. The Cardinals
were beaten; but a far greater trag
edy was to befall the supporters of
L.S.J.U. Billy Erb and Frank Eng
lish, who had introduced the axe,
entrusted it to four guards at the
game.
Then began a fight which raged
over San Francisco for seven hours;
and the last Stanford man to be torn
from the axe was Tom McFadden,
200-opund tackle. Cal men started
relaying the axe through Chinatown
ind across town to the ferry. Once,

a Stanford hurdler named Stout, who
had been biding his time, was handed
the axe unwittingly by Bill Drumm
of Cal; but the wonder quarterback
of Berkeley, Jimmy Hopper, caught
the Stanford man from behind with
a flying tackle in the middle of San
Francisco and the race across town
again started.
Unsuccessful Efforts
"Crazy Joe" Hamilton made Stan
ford's last desperate bid when he
took on a whole streetcar load of Cal
men who had just chopped off the
handle of the axe in a Chinatown
butcher shop.
In the next few days in Berkeley,
Harry Dutton had his hands on it
twice only to succumb to the huge
weight of numbers. A raid was
staged on the Chi Psi house where
Charlie Pringle, football captain and

♦first custodian of the axe, lived and 4
the house was actually torn apart
in vain. The axe was lodged firmly
in the vaults of the Berkeley Ameri
can Trust.
Will Irwin's famous battle of the
Senior Fence was a fruitless Stan
ford victory. It was Will's idea to
capture this famous trophy of Cal's
and hold it as hostage, but for some
strange reason the men of Berkeley
allowed Stanford to keep and burn
the Fence, and the Axe continued to
reside in the vaults.
For years ingenious vchemes were
