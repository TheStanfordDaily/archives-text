# Stanford's Church Built For Students
## 
### 
"Erected to the Glory of God and
in loving Memory of My Husband,
Leland Stanford."
Just as this inscription, which
adorned the facade of Memorial
Church from 1903 to 190(5, reveals
that Jane Stanford's interests were
centered in her husband, so she
wished that his memorial should be
the center, geographically and spirit
ually, of the University.
Although it was one of the last
buildings in the original plan to be
erected, the Church nevertheless was,
in Mrs. Stanford's eyes, the unit
which really marked the completion
of the University. "...While my
whole heart is in the University, my
soul is in that Church," she once re
marked to Dr. John Branner, later
president of the University.
Church Important
And while religious piety has yet
to be considered a distinguishing
characteristic of the typical Stanford
student, Mrs. Stanford's wish that
the Church be important to the stu
dents has not gone completely un
filled. During undergraduate years,
most Stanford students probably en
ter the Church only twiceâ€”on ma
triculation Sunday and on bacca
laureate Sunday. Yet, they concede
to it a degree of the importance and
closeness the founders hoped it would
assume by proudly displaying it to
visitors and, in an amazingly large
number of cases, returning to be
married in it.
Through the years, from Dr. David
Charles Gardner's reign as first chap
lain down to Dr. Elton Trueblood, the
present chaplain, the Church's in
fluence on student life has been help
fully administered. All Stanford
chaplains have been distinguished by
their great interest in the general
welfare of the students and of the
University.
Non-Denominational
Although neither Governor nor
Mrs. Stanford was a member of any
church organization, they both had a
deep interest in the practical activi
ties of all denominations. They
wanted the Church to have a high
place in the interests of Stanford stu
dents, but (hey did not want its in
fluence limited by any denomina
tional bias.
The original plans provided for a
building of Moorish-Romanesque
architecture, but after construction
began in 1899 these plans were modi
fied by various influences at work
on the founders. Mrs. Stanford for
instance was deeply impressed by
the colorful mosaics she found shin
ing from the facades of almost all
public buildings in Venice. It was
finally arranged that mosaics should
adorn the front gable of the church.
The mosaics were brought over from
Venice in 1904, but it was not until
1906 that they were set into the
gable.
When the rumblings of 1906 vented

their fury on Stanford. Memorial
Church's high rear tower crumbled
and with it the heavy flying but
tresses which supported the building
on either side. The facade of the
Church was damaged considerably
with the rsult that after reconstruc
tion, Jane Stanford's fortright dedi
cation which marched across the
front of the Church in high, eye
catching gold letters no longer ap
peared.
Organ, chimes, clock, stained-glass
windows and carved pulpit were
practically uninjured.
After the earthquake, there were
many other units of the campus
which had to be reconstructed, out
of necessity, before the Church;
hence it was the last building to be
restored. This work was started in
1908, but was not completed until
1913. Services were resumed on Oc
tober 5, 1913.
Enter Trueblood
The present chaplain. Dr. D. Elton
Trueblood, came to the University
in June, 1936. Since his coming the
activities and influence of the Church
have broadened considerably. Under
its sponsorship Luncheon Club on
Wednesday afternoons has been
firmly established on the campus
and its popularity seems assured by
the variety of speakers invited. For
quite some time the Chaplain spon
sored the Stanford Question Hour
which he held at his home once a
week.
On a larger scale, the first Spiritual
Conference was held on the Stanford
campus early this year. Denomina
tional representatives from all over
the country attended the Conference.
If one can judge from enthusiasm
expressed by the delegates, this Con
ference was not only profitable, but
worth continuing.
It can truthfully be said that Jane
Stanford's high hopes for a strong
Church influence permeating the life
of each student has fallen a little
short of fulfillment. Every effort,
however, is directed toward intelli
gent helpfulness through the Church
and for those who take advantage of
it, this opportunity is of inestimable
value.
Thirty-seven students were reg
istered in graduate division during
the first year of Stanford Univer
sity.


THE ARCADE in front of Memorial Church contains the class plates of fifty
graduating classes. The class scroll, containing signatures of the seniors, and
important publications reflecting vital information of the school year are sealed
in a lead box and placed under the class plaque.
