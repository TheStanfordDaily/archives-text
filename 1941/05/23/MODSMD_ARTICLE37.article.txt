# Ban on Autos Lifted in 1914
## 
### 
The first time a "horseless car
riage," more familiarly known as
the "devil-wagon," penetrated the
campus was in September, 189!). Its
maker, a Mr. W. L. Elliot of Oak
land, called for Dr. Jordan and Pro
fessor A. W. Smith, and the three
set off for a trip to San Jose and the
Lick Observatory on Mount Ham
ilton.
The three pioneers made the 27
miles from the Hotel Vendome in
San Jose to the top of the mountain
In five hours and twenty-seven min
utes. Remarkable time, according
to the San Francisco Examiner.
Despite Dr. Jordan's adventure,
Stanford's attitude toward automo
biles was hostile. At first automo
biles were excluded from the cam
pus, but in 1905 the trustees per
mitted automobiles to enter the
â– grounds for the annual football
jame.
The stringent rules were gradu
ally relaxed, however, and in De
cember, 1914, the ban on the use of
automobiles on the main avenue
"rom Palo Alto to the campus was
lifted for all time.
During America's participation in
the war, Encina Hall was taken over
by the army as "barracks" for the
A.S.T.C.
