# Bookstore Serves 44 Years
## 
### 
During the presidential campaign
of 1928, the Stanford campus was a
beehive of activity. Herbert Clark
Hoover, '95, was running for Presi
-1 dent of the United States.
One of the principal cogs in the
j Hoover machine was the Stanford
| Bookstore. Reason? Seventy type
j writers in service at the Hoover
residence, the maintenance of which
was a major task, to say nothing of
| keeping in stock the necessary paper
and equipment.
Long Service
But the presidential campaign of
| IS2B was just one phase of 44 years
I of continuous service to the campus
for the Bookstore.
As early as 1893, the University
recognized the need for a bookstore,
j and the Leland Stanford Junior Co
| operative Society was organized and
housed in a little shack where the
nachine shop now stands. In 1897
i dissatisfaction with the co-opera
| ive service caused the reorganiza
tion of the bookstore under faculty
direction.
The first board of directors of five

professors bought out the co-op lock,
stock, and barrel for $1700, which
was considered a remarkably fine
offer since they had been unable to
get any bids on it from San Fran
cisco. By 1905 the bookstore had
expanded sufficiently to plan a new
building. The first meeting of the
board of directors of the bookstore
in the new building was held on
March 8, 1906, then—a sudden break
in bookstore records caused by the
earthquake.
Withstood Quake
The bookstore withstood the
earthquake remarkably well, how
ever; the outer walls were cracked,
plaster fell, but service continued,
uninterrupted. Damage to the build
ing amounted to $4500.
Despite World War I, the book
store grew, and in 1920 Mr. R. M.
Stager, the present manager, was
appointed. During the next ten
years, the building was several
times remodeled and enlarged to
its present size.
During the bookstore's 44 years of
existence, it has always been a co
operative enterprise.

During the presidential campaign
of 1928, the Stanford campus was a
beehive of activity. Herbert Clark
Hoover, '95, was running for Presi
-1 dent of the United States.
One of the principal cogs in the
j Hoover machine was the Stanford
| Bookstore. Reason? Seventy type
j writers in service at the Hoover
residence, the maintenance of which
was a major task, to say nothing of
| keeping in stock the necessary paper
and equipment.
Long Service
But the presidential campaign of
| IS2B was just one phase of 44 years
I of continuous service to the campus
for the Bookstore.
As early as 1893, the University
recognized the need for a bookstore,
j and the Leland Stanford Junior Co
| operative Society was organized and
housed in a little shack where the
nachine shop now stands. In 1897
i dissatisfaction with the co-opera
| ive service caused the reorganiza
tion of the bookstore under faculty
direction.
The first board of directors of five

professors bought out the co-op lock,
stock, and barrel for $1700, which
was considered a remarkably fine
offer since they had been unable to
get any bids on it from San Fran
cisco. By 1905 the bookstore had
expanded sufficiently to plan a new
building. The first meeting of the
board of directors of the bookstore
in the new building was held on
March 8, 1906, then—a sudden break
in bookstore records caused by the
earthquake.
Withstood Quake
The bookstore withstood the
earthquake remarkably well, how
ever; the outer walls were cracked,
plaster fell, but service continued,
uninterrupted. Damage to the build
ing amounted to $4500.
Despite World War I, the book
store grew, and in 1920 Mr. R. M.
Stager, the present manager, was
appointed. During the next ten
years, the building was several
times remodeled and enlarged to
its present size.
During the bookstore's 44 years of
existence, it has always been a co
operative enterprise.
