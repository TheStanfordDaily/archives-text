# Farm Boasts Of Student Government
## 
### 
That old saw, "Out of the frying
pan into the fire," can be twisted in
meaning to express exactly what
participation student government has
meant, and will mean, to each Stan
ford graduate.
For Stanford is a democracy. Every
activity on the campus is the result of
the administration of, by, and for
students, and this laboratory experi
ence in government prepares each
Farm student for eventual emergence
as a citizen with a more important
role to play in a greater democracy.
"With the opening of the Univer
sity in October 1891, the first neces
sity, from the student point of view,
was organization," recalls Dr. Orrin
L. Elliot in his book on Stanford's
first twenty-five years. And from
that first student body meeting on
October 9, 1891, when a temporary
organization was effected, the pres
ent-day, all-pervasive student gov
ernment has grown.
Student Control Slow
Actual student control did not
come to the first student bodies, more
from reluctance on their part to ac
cept responsibilities that inherently
would not always be easy and pleas
ant, than because of administration
hesitation. However, student senti
ment in favor of such control early
caused friction with the faculty Com
mittee on Student Affairs, and in
1910 the first move toward actual
student control was made with the
reorganization of the University Con
ference.
The Conference was succeeded by
the forerunners to Men's and Wo
men's Council.
The women acted first, a Women's
Judicial Board assumed responsi
bility for the government of women
on the campus on November 22, 1911,
and the men followed suit on March
20, 1912.
Framework Established
So in 1912, the skeletal framework
of student government was complete.
There was an A.S.S.U. organization,
headed by a president and vice
president, who embodied the legisla
tive and executive functions, and the
two councils, which embodied the
third branch of democratic govern
ment, the judiciary.
Today Farm student government
is a complex network of organiza
tions, all subsidiary to the A.S.S.U.
Executive Committee, and each ac
tivity is open to any student who
cares to become a part of it.
Following is a brief outline of the
student groups that figure promi
nently in student government; their
functions, and how students enter the
activity:
EX COMMITTEE: President Bruce
Jessup, Vice-President Anne Town
send, and nine other popularly
elected student representatives each
Tuesday night consider and pass the
bulk of all student legislation. Meet
ings are open to the public, and any
student interested in seeing his gov

ernment in action is invited to at
! tend these meetings.
WOMEN'S CONFERENCE: The
| co-ordinating force of women stu
dents—under the A.S.S.U., this
policy-making and legislative body,
is composed of representatives from
all women's living groups, graduate,
and off-campus women. Conference
sets up the women's social reguations
that Women's Council enforces.
COUNCILS, MEN'S AND WO
j MEN'S: These two groups, of five
members each, have been given the
school's judiciary power. They try
violations of the fundamental stand
ard, the Honor Code, of traffic and
miscellaneous rules and regulations.
Council members serve a year, are
elected by student vote every Feb
| ruary and April.
Women's Council is responsible
) for honor code education of fresh
| man women and in their judicial
work act as an advisory and educa
tional, as well as a punitive, body,
i Under Council's supervision, living
group committee's handle late leave
and social regulations.
CARDINALS, RALLY COMMIT
| TEE: Service organizations. Cardi
nals plan and handle almost all A.S.
S.U. functions from dances, rallies,
I and drives, to welcoming visitors and
; miscellaneous problems which ema
nate from Excom. Cardinals, a self
perpetuating organization, each year
appoints successors to carry on their
work in promoting the Red Cross and
Convalescent Home drives, etc.
Rally Committee's official function
is the creation and discipline of
school spirit during football season;
this year the group is undertaking a
new activity in the All-University
sing-fest. Aspirants to Rally Com
| mittee posts achieve their goal
| through a "tryoutee" system.
Activities enlisting individual
I talents:
PUBLICATIONS: The Stanford
Daily enlists staff members for both
the editorial and business side by
means of a "tryoutee" system. A staff
of nearly 50 students, Monday
through Friday, put out the only
morning daily on the Peninsula.
The Quad, Stanford's yearbook,
, recruits editorial and business talent
J through the "tryout" system also.
The Chaparral, campus humor
magazine, maintains no definite staff
outside of the editor and its pub
; Ushers, members of Hammer and
! Coffin. Contributors knock on
; "Chappie's" door, by first contacting

the editor; if he likes and publishes
your material you are in. The Chap
pie business staff welcomes try
outees, however.
Other Croups
In addition to the above-men
tioned principal campus activities are
Concert Series, the Glee Clubs, and
Dramatics (Ram's Head is the dra
matic society), in which members
are recruited after a tryout period.
Also important liason officers in the
realm of Student-Administration
connections are student representa
tives on the Board of Athletic Con
trol and the Union Board of Gov
ernors and the Student Manager.
B.A.C. members are elected in Feb
ruary and April; the representative
on the Union Board is appointed by
Ex Committee; and the student man
ager, who administrates all A.S.S.U.
funds under the eagle eye of Ex
Committee, is appointed yearly by
Alfred H. Masters, the Graduate
Manager of the A.S.S.U. and General
Manager of the oßard of Athletic
Control.
The Y.W.C.A., religious groups, in
terest groups, departmental groups,
men's and women's honoraries, indi
vidual classes, and living groups all
participate in this general student
control.


ADMINISTRATORS OF JUSTICE to Stanford men is the student-elected Men's
Council, which rules on Honor Code, social, and traffic violations. Shown,
here are I left to rightl Cordon Davis, campus police chief; Stan Owen, Chair
man Hugh O'Donnell, and |erry Mayer.

In addition to the above-men

That old saw, "Out of the frying

participation student government has
meant, and will mean, to each Stan

For Stanford is a democracy. Every
activity on the campus is the result of
the administration of, by, and for
students, and this laboratory experi
ence in government prepares each
Farm student for eventual emergence
as a citizen with a more important
role to play in a greater democracy.
"With the opening of the Univer
sity in October 1891, the first neces
sity, from the student point of view,
was organization," recalls Dr. Orrin
L. Elliot in his book on Stanford's
first twenty-five years. And from
that first student body meeting on
October 9, 1891, when a temporary
organization was effected, the pres
ent-day, all-pervasive student gov
ernment has grown.
Student Control Slow
Actual student control did not
come to the first student bodies, more
from reluctance on their part to ac
cept responsibilities that inherently
would not always be easy and pleas
ant, than because of administration
hesitation. However, student senti
ment in favor of such control early
caused friction with the faculty Com
mittee on Student Affairs, and in
1910 the first move toward actual
student control was made with the
reorganization of the University Con
ference.
The Conference was succeeded by
the forerunners to Men's and Wo
men's Council.
The women acted first, a Women's
Judicial Board assumed responsi
bility for the government of women
on the campus on November 22, 1911,
and the men followed suit on March
20, 1912.
Framework Established
So in 1912, the skeletal framework
of student government was complete.
There was an A.S.S.U. organization,
headed by a president and vice
president, who embodied the legisla
tive and executive functions, and the
two councils, which embodied the
third branch of democratic govern
ment, the judiciary.
Today Farm student government
is a complex network of organiza
tions, all subsidiary to the A.S.S.U.
Executive Committee, and each ac
tivity is open to any student who
cares to become a part of it.
Following is a brief outline of the
student groups that figure promi
nently in student government; their
functions, and how students enter the
activity:
EX COMMITTEE: President Bruce
Jessup, Vice-President Anne Town
send, and nine other popularly
elected student representatives each
Tuesday night consider and pass the
bulk of all student legislation. Meet
ings are open to the public, and any
student interested in seeing his gov

ernment in action is invited to at
! tend these meetings.
WOMEN'S CONFERENCE: The
| co-ordinating force of women stu
dents—under the A.S.S.U., this
policy-making and legislative body,
is composed of representatives from
all women's living groups, graduate,
and off-campus women. Conference
sets up the women's social reguations
that Women's Council enforces.
COUNCILS, MEN'S AND WO
j MEN'S: These two groups, of five
members each, have been given the
school's judiciary power. They try
violations of the fundamental stand
ard, the Honor Code, of traffic and
miscellaneous rules and regulations.
Council members serve a year, are
elected by student vote every Feb
| ruary and April.
Women's Council is responsible
) for honor code education of fresh
| man women and in their judicial
work act as an advisory and educa
tional, as well as a punitive, body,
i Under Council's supervision, living
group committee's handle late leave
and social regulations.
CARDINALS, RALLY COMMIT
| TEE: Service organizations. Cardi
nals plan and handle almost all A.S.
S.U. functions from dances, rallies,
I and drives, to welcoming visitors and
; miscellaneous problems which ema
nate from Excom. Cardinals, a self
perpetuating organization, each year
appoints successors to carry on their
work in promoting the Red Cross and
Convalescent Home drives, etc.
Rally Committee's official function
is the creation and discipline of
school spirit during football season;
this year the group is undertaking a
new activity in the All-University
sing-fest. Aspirants to Rally Com
| mittee posts achieve their goal
| through a "tryoutee" system.
Activities enlisting individual

the editorial and business side by

of nearly 50 students, Monday
through Friday, put out the only
morning daily on the Peninsula.
The Quad, Stanford's yearbook,
, recruits editorial and business talent
J through the "tryout" system also.

magazine, maintains no definite staff
outside of the editor and its pub
; Ushers, members of Hammer and

Other Croups
In addition to the above-men

Concert Series, the Glee Clubs, and
Dramatics (Ram's Head is the dra

are recruited after a tryout period.
Also important liason officers in the

B.A.C. members are elected in Feb
ruary and April; the representative

Alfred H. Masters, the Graduate
Manager of the A.S.S.U. and General
Manager of the oßard of Athletic
Control.
The Y.W.C.A., religious groups, in
terest groups, departmental groups,
men's and women's honoraries, indi

participate in this general student
control.


ADMINISTRATORS OF JUSTICE to Stanford men is the student-elected Men's

That old saw, "Out of the frying

For Stanford is a democracy. Every
activity on the campus is the result of
the administration of, by, and for
students, and this laboratory experi

Farm student for eventual emergence
as a citizen with a more important
role to play in a greater democracy.
"With the opening of the Univer
sity in October 1891, the first neces
sity, from the student point of view,
was organization," recalls Dr. Orrin
L. Elliot in his book on Stanford's
first twenty-five years. And from
that first student body meeting on
October 9, 1891, when a temporary
organization was effected, the pres
ent-day, all-pervasive student gov
ernment has grown.
Student Control Slow
Actual student control did not
come to the first student bodies, more
from reluctance on their part to ac
cept responsibilities that inherently
would not always be easy and pleas
ant, than because of administration
hesitation. However, student senti
ment in favor of such control early
caused friction with the faculty Com
mittee on Student Affairs, and in
1910 the first move toward actual
student control was made with the
reorganization of the University Con
ference.
The Conference was succeeded by
the forerunners to Men's and Wo
men's Council.
The women acted first, a Women's
Judicial Board assumed responsi
bility for the government of women
on the campus on November 22, 1911,
and the men followed suit on March
20, 1912.
Framework Established
So in 1912, the skeletal framework
of student government was complete.
There was an A.S.S.U. organization,
headed by a president and vice
president, who embodied the legisla
tive and executive functions, and the
two councils, which embodied the
third branch of democratic govern
ment, the judiciary.
Today Farm student government
is a complex network of organiza
tions, all subsidiary to the A.S.S.U.
Executive Committee, and each ac
tivity is open to any student who
cares to become a part of it.
Following is a brief outline of the
student groups that figure promi
nently in student government; their
functions, and how students enter the
activity:
EX COMMITTEE: President Bruce
Jessup, Vice-President Anne Town
send, and nine other popularly
elected student representatives each
Tuesday night consider and pass the
bulk of all student legislation. Meet
ings are open to the public, and any
student interested in seeing his gov

ernment in action is invited to at

WOMEN'S CONFERENCE: The
| co-ordinating force of women stu
dents—under the A.S.S.U., this
policy-making and legislative body,
is composed of representatives from
all women's living groups, graduate,
and off-campus women. Conference
sets up the women's social reguations
that Women's Council enforces.
COUNCILS, MEN'S AND WO
j MEN'S: These two groups, of five
members each, have been given the
school's judiciary power. They try
violations of the fundamental stand
ard, the Honor Code, of traffic and
miscellaneous rules and regulations.
Council members serve a year, are
elected by student vote every Feb
| ruary and April.
Women's Council is responsible
) for honor code education of fresh
| man women and in their judicial
work act as an advisory and educa
tional, as well as a punitive, body,
i Under Council's supervision, living
group committee's handle late leave
and social regulations.

policy-making and legislative body,
is composed of representatives from
all women's living groups, graduate,
and off-campus women. Conference
sets up the women's social reguations
that Women's Council enforces.
COUNCILS, MEN'S AND WO
j MEN'S: These two groups, of five
members each, have been given the
school's judiciary power. They try
violations of the fundamental stand

miscellaneous rules and regulations.
Council members serve a year, are
elected by student vote every Feb

Activities enlisting individual
I talents:
PUBLICATIONS: The Stanford
Daily enlists staff members for both
the editorial and business side by
means of a "tryoutee" system. A staff
of nearly 50 students, Monday
through Friday, put out the only
morning daily on the Peninsula.
The Quad, Stanford's yearbook,
, recruits editorial and business talent
J through the "tryout" system also.
The Chaparral, campus humor
magazine, maintains no definite staff
outside of the editor and its pub
; Ushers, members of Hammer and
! Coffin. Contributors knock on
; "Chappie's" door, by first contacting

the editor; if he likes and publishes
your material you are in. The Chap
pie business staff welcomes try
outees, however.
Other Croups
In addition to the above-men
tioned principal campus activities are
Concert Series, the Glee Clubs, and
Dramatics (Ram's Head is the dra
matic society), in which members
are recruited after a tryout period.
Also important liason officers in the
realm of Student-Administration
connections are student representa
tives on the Board of Athletic Con
trol and the Union Board of Gov
ernors and the Student Manager.
B.A.C. members are elected in Feb
ruary and April; the representative
on the Union Board is appointed by
Ex Committee; and the student man
ager, who administrates all A.S.S.U.
funds under the eagle eye of Ex
Committee, is appointed yearly by
Alfred H. Masters, the Graduate
Manager of the A.S.S.U. and General
Manager of the oßard of Athletic
Control.
The Y.W.C.A., religious groups, in
terest groups, departmental groups,
men's and women's honoraries, indi
vidual classes, and living groups all
participate in this general student
control.


ADMINISTRATORS OF JUSTICE to Stanford men is the student-elected Men's
Council, which rules on Honor Code, social, and traffic violations. Shown,
here are I left to rightl Cordon Davis, campus police chief; Stan Owen, Chair
man Hugh O'Donnell, and |erry Mayer.
That old saw, "Out of the frying
pan into the fire," can be twisted in
meaning to express exactly what
participation student government has
meant, and will mean, to each Stan
ford graduate.
For Stanford is a democracy. Every
activity on the campus is the result of
the administration of, by, and for
students, and this laboratory experi
ence in government prepares each
Farm student for eventual emergence
as a citizen with a more important
role to play in a greater democracy.
"With the opening of the Univer
sity in October 1891, the first neces
sity, from the student point of view,
was organization," recalls Dr. Orrin
L. Elliot in his book on Stanford's
first twenty-five years. And from
that first student body meeting on
October 9, 1891, when a temporary
organization was effected, the pres
ent-day, all-pervasive student gov
ernment has grown.
Student Control Slow
Actual student control did not
come to the first student bodies, more
from reluctance on their part to ac
cept responsibilities that inherently
would not always be easy and pleas
ant, than because of administration
hesitation. However, student senti
ment in favor of such control early
caused friction with the faculty Com
mittee on Student Affairs, and in
1910 the first move toward actual
student control was made with the
reorganization of the University Con
ference.
The Conference was succeeded by
the forerunners to Men's and Wo
men's Council.
The women acted first, a Women's
Judicial Board assumed responsi
bility for the government of women
on the campus on November 22, 1911,
and the men followed suit on March
20, 1912.
Framework Established
So in 1912, the skeletal framework
of student government was complete.
There was an A.S.S.U. organization,
headed by a president and vice
president, who embodied the legisla
tive and executive functions, and the
two councils, which embodied the
third branch of democratic govern
ment, the judiciary.
Today Farm student government
is a complex network of organiza
tions, all subsidiary to the A.S.S.U.
Executive Committee, and each ac
tivity is open to any student who
cares to become a part of it.
Following is a brief outline of the
student groups that figure promi
nently in student government; their
functions, and how students enter the
activity:
EX COMMITTEE: President Bruce
Jessup, Vice-President Anne Town
send, and nine other popularly
elected student representatives each
Tuesday night consider and pass the
bulk of all student legislation. Meet
ings are open to the public, and any
student interested in seeing his gov

ernment in action is invited to at
