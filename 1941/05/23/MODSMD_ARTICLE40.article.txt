# Honor Code Fetes Birthday
## 
### 
"No unpermitted aid given or re-'
ceived"—that terse but sweeping
declaration, which every student
adds as a sort of epitaph to every
University blue book—has a birth
day too. The Code is 19 years old
this year.
Compared to the University's fifty
years the Honor Code's 19 are few,
but they represent the maturity of
student self-government at Stan
ford. Nineteen years have proved
the Code's utility, and have shown
that mutual trust can be an effec
tive disciplinary measure.
Today the Honor Code, initiated
by students, and administered and
enforced by students, holds the rank
of an institution which is an inte
gral part of the Stanford Way.
System Needed
It all began in 1921, when the need
was felt for an adequate system of
regulation without resort to child
ish penalties and threats. Casting
about for a method that would be
practicable and still non-coercive,
the solution was suggested in a code
previously devised and used by the
Stanford Law School.

' The University Academic Council
evolved the present honor code from
the Law School precursor, and em
bodied it in Section 2 of the Con
stitutional By-Laws of the Asso
ciated Students.
Code's Spheres
Two brief paragraphs outline the
spheres in which the code operates.
The first outlines the spheres where
the Code operates: examinations,
class work and papers, use of li
brary books. The second provides
for the enforcement of the honor
system by a student council.
However, the Honor Code has out
grown the original provision which
gave it life. Today its ramifications
are numerous—its spirit has been
extended to cover many phases of
student life outside academic con
cerns. For instance, social regula
tions, and the regulation of the use
of student body cards, are enforced
under the Honor Code rather than
by a police system.
The duty of enforcing the Code
and dealing with violations was
placed in the hands of Men's and
Women's Councils. In granting self- j
regulation to students the University
not only agreed to refrain from proc
toring and other forms of over
seeing examinations but expressed
its confidence in the honor of its I
students.
It was a concrete manifestation of
the trust in student integrity ex
pressed by Mr. David Starr Jordan,
first president of the University,
when he said, "Students are ex
pected to show, both within and
without the University, such respect
for order, morality, honor, and the
rights of others, as is demanded of
good citizens."
For nineteen years, the Honor
Code has held a firmly entrenched
position. Some discussion has been
inevitable—this year, for instance, j
Excom met at the home of Dr. Wil
bur to consider possible revision of
the Code, but no changes have been j
forthcoming.

of an institution which is an inte

System Needed
It all began in 1921, when the need
was felt for an adequate system of
regulation without resort to child
ish penalties and threats. Casting
about for a method that would be
practicable and still non-coercive,
the solution was suggested in a code
previously devised and used by the
Stanford Law School.

' The University Academic Council
evolved the present honor code from
the Law School precursor, and em
bodied it in Section 2 of the Con
stitutional By-Laws of the Asso
ciated Students.
Code's Spheres
Two brief paragraphs outline the
spheres in which the code operates.
The first outlines the spheres where
the Code operates: examinations,
class work and papers, use of li
brary books. The second provides
for the enforcement of the honor
system by a student council.
However, the Honor Code has out
grown the original provision which
gave it life. Today its ramifications
are numerous—its spirit has been
extended to cover many phases of
student life outside academic con
cerns. For instance, social regula
tions, and the regulation of the use
of student body cards, are enforced
under the Honor Code rather than
by a police system.
The duty of enforcing the Code
and dealing with violations was
placed in the hands of Men's and
Women's Councils. In granting self- j
regulation to students the University
not only agreed to refrain from proc
toring and other forms of over
seeing examinations but expressed
its confidence in the honor of its I
students.
It was a concrete manifestation of
the trust in student integrity ex
pressed by Mr. David Starr Jordan,
first president of the University,
when he said, "Students are ex
pected to show, both within and
without the University, such respect
for order, morality, honor, and the
rights of others, as is demanded of
good citizens."
For nineteen years, the Honor
Code has held a firmly entrenched
position. Some discussion has been
inevitable—this year, for instance, j
Excom met at the home of Dr. Wil
bur to consider possible revision of
the Code, but no changes have been j
forthcoming.
"No unpermitted aid given or re-'
ceived"—that terse but sweeping
declaration, which every student
adds as a sort of epitaph to every
University blue book—has a birth
day too. The Code is 19 years old
this year.
Compared to the University's fifty
years the Honor Code's 19 are few,
but they represent the maturity of
student self-government at Stan
ford. Nineteen years have proved
the Code's utility, and have shown
that mutual trust can be an effec
tive disciplinary measure.

by students, and administered and
