News from The Daily — humor
from Chappie—memories from the
Quad.
These are the three Stanford pub
lications. They have succeeded
throughout the "first fifty years" and
are now firmly entrenched as cam
pus traditions and necessities.
Written, edited, and published by
the students of Stanford, each of
these publications today ranks
among the tops in its respective field
against similar works of other uni
versities.
A few minutes after 12 o'clock
when most of the campus has al
ready hit the pillows or is still hit
ting the books, a skeleton staff of
Daily men and women who started
out at 3 o'clock in the afternoon turn
off the teletype, turn out the lights
and head for home. Five times a
week this same procedure takes
place. Five times a week the type
is locked up in the forms and left
in the dark; the printers arrive and
start the presses going at 2 o'clock
in the morning, and at 6 o'clock,
before most of the campus is stirring,
the circulation staff come in to dis
tribute more than 4,000 Dailies over
the campus and Palo Alto.
Hundred Members
Throughout the year this same
procedure takes place every day
with more than 100 members of the
staff co-operating to give Stanford
complete news of the campus, fea
tures, student editorials, world news
and pictures.
But the operation of The Daily
today is more than just writing and
printing. Each quarter 75 cents from
each student's $15 community fee
goes to The Daily for each student's
subscription price. The Daily's stu
dent business manager has charge of
this money as well as advertising
and circulation.
Chaparral, staffed by the wits of
the campus, is peddled each month
on the Quad by Roble lasses, and
though every student does not buy
a Chappie each month, the reader
ship of each copy adds tremendously
to its total audience.
Chaparral is published by under
graduate members of Hammer and
Coffin, national college humor mag
azine fraternity, founded at Stanford
in 1906.
Chappie Pokes Fun
The business of Chappie is poking
fun and chronicling in lighter vein
the happenings of Stanford by story,
poetry, and cartoon, its one con
sistently serious feature being the
reviewer's column.
Humor is reserved, however, for
the editorial offices of Chaparral;
the manager's business is a serious
one, that of securing advertisements
and selling the book to the students.
Deadline comes every day for The
Daily, once a month for Chaparral;
but over across the street in the old
Women's Gym, which is now the
Quad office, they work like beavers
through eight months of the year in
anticipation of one last and final
deadline. The business of publishing
a yearbook is a lengthy one, and
once the staff has completed its job
late in spring quarter it is done for
good. There can be no changing or
improving from issue to issue.
But when the Quad blossoms from
a massive working dummy into
black and white and colors, it is like
the unveiling of a statue.
Quad Theme
This year's Quad, Volume 48, will
be built around a theme of Stan
ford's First Fifty Years, and all its
material will be treated from a his
torical viewpoint.
The Quad too has its business
manager who is responsible for the
financial success of the publication.
These "big three" will soon be
joined by a newcomer, The Carillon,
a general serious magazine treating
present-day problems and provid
ing a periodical medium for literary
minded Stanfordites. Its backers are
hoping it won't go the way of pre
vious campus literary magazines—
into the red.
Not generally circulated around
the campus is the Illustrated Re
view, published by the Alumni As

sociation and received by all its
members. The Review, started as The
Alumnus in 1899, keeps them in
touch with the doings of youngei
campus generations and keeps the
alumni, no matter where they may
be, from drifting away from the
"Stanford Family."
The Daily Starts
What is now The Daily commenced
publication as The Palo Alto on Oct.
1, 1899, Stanford's first registration
day, and from that time on boasted
that it was "the only college paper
ever starting simultaneously with
the opening of a great university.
Throughout Stanford's first his
toric year The Palo Alto continued
as a monthly news journal until the
fall of the next year when it became
a daily, the eighth college daily in
the nation. It was at this time that
the popular nickname, "Dippy," was
coined from the three initials, D.P.A,
In 1926 the name of the paper was
changed to The Stanford Daily in
order to avoid confusion with the
Palo Alto Times, but the legendary
term "Dippy" still hangs around.
The Daily has had a colorful past,
and many names later famous in
writing have appeared on its pages,
as well as those of other Stanford
publications.
Distinctive Volumes
Each editor has had something
distinctive about his volume and
since a battle with the Administra

tion in 1906 every editor has had
the privilege of freely expressing his
opinions. Today there is no one
above the editor with regard to what
shall be printed.
The Daily through fifty years has
brought to Stanford an accurate
chronicling of student activities, sci
entific achievements, sports events,
and the development of the Uni
versity.
The freshmen who entered Stan
ford on its first registration day were
responsible for a great many of the
University's traditions. As the Class
of '95, first to go all four years here,
they called themselves "The Pio
neers" and felt some permanent rec
ord should be made to preserve their
achievements for posterity.
And so when the Pioneers were in
their junior year, in the spring of
1894, they brought out the first edi
tion of a student yearbook and
called it "The Quad."
Emphasis on Juniors
Early issues listed the seniors and
their activities but emphasis was
naturally on the juniors, publishers
of the book. The Quad also served
as a literary yearbook until 1807
and contained a humor section.
With the exception of the por
traits, almost all illustrations in early
Quads were in the form of drawings.
Today photographs have almost com
pletely replaced other art work with


IN THE EARLY YEARS of the Univer
sity, the above publications existed
side by side on the Farm. The Daily
Palo Alto, later to become The Stan
ford Daily, was the eighth oldest col
lege daily in the country. The Sequoia
suspended publication in the spring of
1919.
