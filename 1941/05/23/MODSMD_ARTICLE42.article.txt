Stanford Presentation
Thomas Welton Stanford, brother
of the University's founder, pre

which is housed in the gallery. In
1915, Mr. Stanford, who made a for
tune in Australia, gave the Univer
sity the money for the gallery. The
building formed the first unit of the
new quadrangle, as it was built be
fore either the library or the Cub
berley Building.
The remodeled gallery will con

porary exhibits will be placed and
two side rooms where the perma
