Over 2,000 separate sales each day
that classes are in session. A record
like this keeps the Stanford Union
Cellar busy from 7:30 o'clock in
the morning until 11 o'clock at night.
True, almost half of them are 5-cent
checks, most of them for "cokes" and
coffee, but the whole set-up re
quires an extremely efficient or
ganization.
In addition to the Cellar, there are
three other members of the Union
Unit, the Union residences, the
Women's Clubhouse, and the offices
in the Old Union, with the entire
Union being under the direction and
supervision of Miss Christine Ricker.
Union Unit
About 170 Stanford women live in
Union residences, GO of them within
the Union itself and approximately
110 in the other members of the
Union residence group. These in
clude Elm Cottage, Hawthorne Cot
tage. Madrono Hall, Mariposa House,
and The Oaks, with the members of
all of the groups eating in the Union
residence dining hall.
The Women's Clubhouse is run by
its own Board of Governors, headed
by Mrs. Almon E. Roth, who has
been connected with the Clubhouse
since its inception, and was guided
during the first 17 years of its life
by Mrs. Elwood P. Cubberly, wife
of Dean Emeritus Cubberly of the
School of Education and co-donor
of the new School of Education
building erected in 1938.
The Old Union building itself
has been lai'gely taken over by the
offices of different student organiza
tions. Among these are the A.S.S.U.,
Interfraternity Council, Concert Se
ries, Co-op Book Exchange, Wom
en's and Men's Councils, Rally Com
mittee, Inter-Faith Council, the De
bate Manager and the Quad pho
tographer. The few men's residence

rooms left have been largely taken
over by members of the faculty.
The Women's Clubhouse donations
were started in April of 1908, with
the wives of several faculty mem
bers and trustees making liberal do
nations, in addition to those collected
from women in attendance at the
University at the time. It was
soon decided hat a building could
be started, and the Clubhouse first
opened its doors on February 18,
1915,
Donations Started
At first started for some place
that off-campus women could go
between classes on the Quad, with
rooms for special meetings of var
ious kinds, it was soon decided to
allow mixed groups to meet in the
Clubhouse on the payment of rental
fees, and this was started in 1915.
It has now reached the point where
anything from the Y.W.C.A. to the
John Steinbeck groups hold their
meetings there.
The money for the support of the
Clubhouse comes from three differ
ent sources: the rentals charged.

the trustees of the University, and
$1 per quarter from the Community
Fee of every woman student at
Stanford. The Women's Clubhouse
is now on a paying basis, after hav
ing cleared off its final debt in 1927.
In addition to the various rooms
for the exclusive use of women
students of the University, there are
rooms that men may use during the
day, meeting rooms, and a guest
room for alumni and friends of
Stanford.
Most of the student administra
tive offices in the University are
now located in the Old Union.
Through the A.S.S.U. and Student
Manager's offices passes an annual
total of about $160,000, while
through the offices of the Men's and
Women's Councils pass almost all
student disciplinary problems.
Inter-Faith Council co-ordinates
the work of all of the church groups
on the campus, while Rally Com
mittee has charge of stunts and yells
at football games, car stickers, root
ers' caps, and the newly founded All-
University Singfest.


LASUEN AVENUE, the home of the majority of Stanford's fraternity and
sorority houses, is one of the University's show-places, especially in the!
spring when the trees form a shaded canopy over the street. Known as the
Row, this thoroughfare presents almost a solid facade of modern, white
buildings, most of them built in a Southern Colonial style. Stanford boasts
24 fraternities and nine sororities, but friendships formed during the students'
freshman days in Roble and Encina persist all through their college careers,
whether the student joins a House or decides to live in the more independent
surroundings of the Halls. Stanford is famed for its complete democracy.
Although at election time Row and Hall run separate slates, few students
vote a "straight" ticket, thus assuring election for the most popular candidate
notwithstanding his affiliation. At the present time six members of the
Executive Committee are from the Halls and five are from the Row.


ONE OF STANFORD'S MOST NOTED TRADITIONS is that daily "coke" at
the Union Cellar. Here a group of students gravitate toward the Union. One
of them is reading a Daily Trojan, student newspaper of the University of
Southern California, which was sent to him by a friend.

School of Education and co-donor
of the new School of Education
building erected in 1938.
The Old Union building itself
has been lai'gely taken over by the
offices of different student organiza
tions. Among these are the A.S.S.U.,
Interfraternity Council, Concert Se
ries, Co-op Book Exchange, Wom
en's and Men's Councils, Rally Com
mittee, Inter-Faith Council, the De
bate Manager and the Quad pho
tographer. The few men's residence

rooms left have been largely taken
over by members of the faculty.
The Women's Clubhouse donations
were started in April of 1908, with
the wives of several faculty mem
bers and trustees making liberal do
nations, in addition to those collected
from women in attendance at the
University at the time. It was
soon decided hat a building could
be started, and the Clubhouse first
opened its doors on February 18,
1915,
Donations Started
At first started for some place
that off-campus women could go
between classes on the Quad, with
rooms for special meetings of var
ious kinds, it was soon decided to
allow mixed groups to meet in the
Clubhouse on the payment of rental
fees, and this was started in 1915.
It has now reached the point where
anything from the Y.W.C.A. to the
John Steinbeck groups hold their
meetings there.
The money for the support of the
Clubhouse comes from three differ
ent sources: the rentals charged.

the trustees of the University, and
$1 per quarter from the Community
Fee of every woman student at
Stanford. The Women's Clubhouse
is now on a paying basis, after hav
ing cleared off its final debt in 1927.
In addition to the various rooms
for the exclusive use of women
students of the University, there are
rooms that men may use during the
day, meeting rooms, and a guest
room for alumni and friends of
Stanford.
Most of the student administra
tive offices in the University are
now located in the Old Union.
Through the A.S.S.U. and Student
Manager's offices passes an annual
total of about $160,000, while
through the offices of the Men's and
Women's Councils pass almost all
student disciplinary problems.
Inter-Faith Council co-ordinates
the work of all of the church groups
on the campus, while Rally Com
mittee has charge of stunts and yells
at football games, car stickers, root
ers' caps, and the newly founded All-
University Singfest.


LASUEN AVENUE, the home of the majority of Stanford's fraternity and
sorority houses, is one of the University's show-places, especially in the!
spring when the trees form a shaded canopy over the street. Known as the
Row, this thoroughfare presents almost a solid facade of modern, white
buildings, most of them built in a Southern Colonial style. Stanford boasts
24 fraternities and nine sororities, but friendships formed during the students'
freshman days in Roble and Encina persist all through their college careers,
whether the student joins a House or decides to live in the more independent
surroundings of the Halls. Stanford is famed for its complete democracy.
Although at election time Row and Hall run separate slates, few students
vote a "straight" ticket, thus assuring election for the most popular candidate
notwithstanding his affiliation. At the present time six members of the
Executive Committee are from the Halls and five are from the Row.


ONE OF STANFORD'S MOST NOTED TRADITIONS is that daily "coke" at
the Union Cellar. Here a group of students gravitate toward the Union. One
of them is reading a Daily Trojan, student newspaper of the University of
Southern California, which was sent to him by a friend.
Over 2,000 separate sales each day
that classes are in session. A record
like this keeps the Stanford Union
Cellar busy from 7:30 o'clock in
the morning until 11 o'clock at night.
True, almost half of them are 5-cent
checks, most of them for "cokes" and
coffee, but the whole set-up re
quires an extremely efficient or
ganization.
In addition to the Cellar, there are
three other members of the Union
Unit, the Union residences, the
Women's Clubhouse, and the offices
in the Old Union, with the entire
Union being under the direction and
supervision of Miss Christine Ricker.
Union Unit
About 170 Stanford women live in
Union residences, GO of them within
the Union itself and approximately
110 in the other members of the
Union residence group. These in
clude Elm Cottage, Hawthorne Cot
tage. Madrono Hall, Mariposa House,
and The Oaks, with the members of
all of the groups eating in the Union
residence dining hall.
The Women's Clubhouse is run by
its own Board of Governors, headed
by Mrs. Almon E. Roth, who has
been connected with the Clubhouse
since its inception, and was guided
during the first 17 years of its life
by Mrs. Elwood P. Cubberly, wife
of Dean Emeritus Cubberly of the

anything from the Y.W.C.A. to the
John Steinbeck groups hold their
meetings there.
The money for the support of the
Clubhouse comes from three differ
ent sources: the rentals charged.

the trustees of the University, and
$1 per quarter from the Community
Fee of every woman student at
Stanford. The Women's Clubhouse
is now on a paying basis, after hav
ing cleared off its final debt in 1927.
In addition to the various rooms
for the exclusive use of women
students of the University, there are
rooms that men may use during the
day, meeting rooms, and a guest
room for alumni and friends of
Stanford.
Most of the student administra
tive offices in the University are
now located in the Old Union.
Through the A.S.S.U. and Student
Manager's offices passes an annual
total of about $160,000, while
through the offices of the Men's and
Women's Councils pass almost all
student disciplinary problems.
Inter-Faith Council co-ordinates
the work of all of the church groups
on the campus, while Rally Com
mittee has charge of stunts and yells
at football games, car stickers, root
ers' caps, and the newly founded All-
University Singfest.


LASUEN AVENUE, the home of the majority of Stanford's fraternity and
sorority houses, is one of the University's show-places, especially in the!
spring when the trees form a shaded canopy over the street. Known as the
Row, this thoroughfare presents almost a solid facade of modern, white
buildings, most of them built in a Southern Colonial style. Stanford boasts
24 fraternities and nine sororities, but friendships formed during the students'
freshman days in Roble and Encina persist all through their college careers,
whether the student joins a House or decides to live in the more independent
surroundings of the Halls. Stanford is famed for its complete democracy.
Although at election time Row and Hall run separate slates, few students
vote a "straight" ticket, thus assuring election for the most popular candidate
notwithstanding his affiliation. At the present time six members of the
Executive Committee are from the Halls and five are from the Row.


ONE OF STANFORD'S MOST NOTED TRADITIONS is that daily "coke" at
the Union Cellar. Here a group of students gravitate toward the Union. One
of them is reading a Daily Trojan, student newspaper of the University of
Southern California, which was sent to him by a friend.
Over 2,000 separate sales each day
that classes are in session. A record
like this keeps the Stanford Union
Cellar busy from 7:30 o'clock in
the morning until 11 o'clock at night.
True, almost half of them are 5-cent
checks, most of them for "cokes" and
coffee, but the whole set-up re
quires an extremely efficient or
ganization.
In addition to the Cellar, there are
three other members of the Union
Unit, the Union residences, the
Women's Clubhouse, and the offices
in the Old Union, with the entire
Union being under the direction and
supervision of Miss Christine Ricker.
Union Unit
About 170 Stanford women live in
Union residences, GO of them within
the Union itself and approximately
110 in the other members of the
Union residence group. These in
clude Elm Cottage, Hawthorne Cot
tage. Madrono Hall, Mariposa House,
and The Oaks, with the members of
all of the groups eating in the Union
residence dining hall.
The Women's Clubhouse is run by
its own Board of Governors, headed
by Mrs. Almon E. Roth, who has
been connected with the Clubhouse
since its inception, and was guided
during the first 17 years of its life
by Mrs. Elwood P. Cubberly, wife
of Dean Emeritus Cubberly of the
School of Education and co-donor
of the new School of Education
building erected in 1938.
The Old Union building itself
has been lai'gely taken over by the
offices of different student organiza
tions. Among these are the A.S.S.U.,
Interfraternity Council, Concert Se
ries, Co-op Book Exchange, Wom
en's and Men's Councils, Rally Com
mittee, Inter-Faith Council, the De
bate Manager and the Quad pho
tographer. The few men's residence

rooms left have been largely taken
over by members of the faculty.
The Women's Clubhouse donations
were started in April of 1908, with
the wives of several faculty mem
bers and trustees making liberal do
nations, in addition to those collected
from women in attendance at the
University at the time. It was
soon decided hat a building could
be started, and the Clubhouse first
opened its doors on February 18,
1915,
Donations Started
At first started for some place
that off-campus women could go
between classes on the Quad, with
rooms for special meetings of var
ious kinds, it was soon decided to
allow mixed groups to meet in the
Clubhouse on the payment of rental
fees, and this was started in 1915.
