# Marine Station Expands
## 
### 
Stanford University, "located some
30 miles south of San Francisco in
the mild and salubrious climate of
Northern California," may be cele
brating its fiftieth anniversary this
year, but not all of Stanford Univer
sity is on the site of the former
Stanford Farm nor is all of Stanford
University celebrating its fiftieth
anniversary.
The majority of Stanford under
graduates are unaware of, or over
look, the existence of the Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford Univer
sity at Pacific Grove.
Though the marine station dates
from the first days of the University,
it was not opened until the summer
of 1892. Therefore the marine bio
logical laboratory has still to cele
brate its fiftieth anniversary. But
even during the hectic first few
months of the University's existence,
President Jordan, Trustee Timothy
Hopkins—son of Mark Hopkins, one
of the West's "Big Four" and a
mainstay of Stanford for most of its
first half century—and Professors
Oliver Pebbles Jenkins and Charles
H. Gilbert had decided upon the
need and desirability of such a sta
tion at Pacific Grove.
Other Successes
The success of biological stations
at Naples, Woods Hole in Massa
chusetts, Dr. Jordan's study under
Louis Agassiz, and Mr. Hopkins' visit
to the Stazione Zoologies at Naples
suggested the establishment of the
Pacific Grove station. Exceeded only
by the famous Woods Hole station in
Masachusetts, the Peninsula "is one
of the best locations in the United
States for marine study because it
is on a granite outcrop, estimated to
be between 250 and 500 million years
in geological age," according to Pro
fessor Harold Heath of the station.
Two rambling wood buildings on
the point where Monterey and Pa
cific Grove meet were the home of
the station for its first 25 years. As
a result of Mr. Hopkins' generous
support of the project and through
his influence the Pacific Improve
ment Company gave the land for the
marine station to the University. But
for its first quarter century the sta
tion, though nominally a part of
Stanford, was dependent largely
upon small student fees and the
generosity of Hopkins for its main
tenance.
Research Expansion
After Dr. Wilbur's succession to
the presidency, however, there was
an expansion of research into all the
complex fields of physical and social
sciences as part of the continuing
growth of the University. The ma
rine station shared in this growth.

>Its area was enlarged to 13 acres, and
in 1917 Dr. Walter K. Fisher, the
present director, was appointed.
In this same year the first new
building, the Alexander Agassiz
Laboratory, was opened, changing
the station from a "spring and sum
mer school" into a year-around cen
ter for both elementary and ad
vanced research. In 1928 the Jacques
Loeb Laboratory, with its many spe
cialized laboratories, each well
equipped for scientific study, was
added, completing the present plant.
The fields of science under inves
tigation at the station are of tech
nical appeal rather than popular in
terest because of the University's
attention to "pure science," which
means that its work usually cannot
be directed from the view of ob
taining immediate and practical re
sults. Its enrollment is composed,
mainly, of advanced science stu
dents.
Biologist's Aim
"The aim of the biologist is to
study life, in order ultimately to an
swer the question, What is life? The
methods of doing this are severely
technical and are becoming more so
every year. Speaking broadly, the
Hopkins Marine Station is working
on the fundamental problems of liv
ing matter and at the same time is
contributing to special phases of the
biology of the sea," was Dr. Fisher's
interpretation in a recent interview
of the station's investigations.

The success of biological stations
at Naples, Woods Hole in Massa
chusetts, Dr. Jordan's study under
Louis Agassiz, and Mr. Hopkins' visit
to the Stazione Zoologies at Naples
suggested the establishment of the
Pacific Grove station. Exceeded only
by the famous Woods Hole station in
Masachusetts, the Peninsula "is one
of the best locations in the United
States for marine study because it
is on a granite outcrop, estimated to
be between 250 and 500 million years
in geological age," according to Pro
fessor Harold Heath of the station.
Two rambling wood buildings on
the point where Monterey and Pa
cific Grove meet were the home of
the station for its first 25 years. As
a result of Mr. Hopkins' generous
support of the project and through
his influence the Pacific Improve
ment Company gave the land for the
marine station to the University. But
for its first quarter century the sta
tion, though nominally a part of
Stanford, was dependent largely
upon small student fees and the
generosity of Hopkins for its main
tenance.
Research Expansion
After Dr. Wilbur's succession to
the presidency, however, there was
an expansion of research into all the
complex fields of physical and social
sciences as part of the continuing
growth of the University. The ma
rine station shared in this growth.

>Its area was enlarged to 13 acres, and
in 1917 Dr. Walter K. Fisher, the
present director, was appointed.
In this same year the first new
building, the Alexander Agassiz
Laboratory, was opened, changing
the station from a "spring and sum
mer school" into a year-around cen
ter for both elementary and ad
vanced research. In 1928 the Jacques
Loeb Laboratory, with its many spe
cialized laboratories, each well
equipped for scientific study, was
added, completing the present plant.
The fields of science under inves
tigation at the station are of tech
nical appeal rather than popular in
terest because of the University's
attention to "pure science," which
means that its work usually cannot
be directed from the view of ob
taining immediate and practical re
sults. Its enrollment is composed,
mainly, of advanced science stu
dents.
Biologist's Aim
"The aim of the biologist is to
study life, in order ultimately to an
swer the question, What is life? The
methods of doing this are severely
technical and are becoming more so
every year. Speaking broadly, the
Hopkins Marine Station is working
on the fundamental problems of liv
ing matter and at the same time is
contributing to special phases of the
biology of the sea," was Dr. Fisher's
interpretation in a recent interview
of the station's investigations.

Stanford University, "located some
30 miles south of San Francisco in
the mild and salubrious climate of
Northern California," may be cele
brating its fiftieth anniversary this
year, but not all of Stanford Univer
sity is on the site of the former
Stanford Farm nor is all of Stanford
University celebrating its fiftieth
anniversary.
The majority of Stanford under
graduates are unaware of, or over
look, the existence of the Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford Univer
sity at Pacific Grove.
Though the marine station dates
from the first days of the University,
it was not opened until the summer
of 1892. Therefore the marine bio
logical laboratory has still to cele
brate its fiftieth anniversary. But
even during the hectic first few
months of the University's existence,
President Jordan, Trustee Timothy
Hopkins—son of Mark Hopkins, one
of the West's "Big Four" and a
mainstay of Stanford for most of its
first half century—and Professors
Oliver Pebbles Jenkins and Charles
H. Gilbert had decided upon the

the presidency, however, there was
an expansion of research into all the
complex fields of physical and social
sciences as part of the continuing
growth of the University. The ma
rine station shared in this growth.

>Its area was enlarged to 13 acres, and
in 1917 Dr. Walter K. Fisher, the
present director, was appointed.
In this same year the first new
building, the Alexander Agassiz
Laboratory, was opened, changing
the station from a "spring and sum
mer school" into a year-around cen
ter for both elementary and ad
vanced research. In 1928 the Jacques
Loeb Laboratory, with its many spe
cialized laboratories, each well
equipped for scientific study, was
added, completing the present plant.
The fields of science under inves
tigation at the station are of tech
nical appeal rather than popular in
terest because of the University's
attention to "pure science," which
means that its work usually cannot
be directed from the view of ob
taining immediate and practical re
sults. Its enrollment is composed,
mainly, of advanced science stu
dents.
Biologist's Aim
"The aim of the biologist is to
study life, in order ultimately to an
swer the question, What is life? The
methods of doing this are severely
technical and are becoming more so
every year. Speaking broadly, the
Hopkins Marine Station is working
on the fundamental problems of liv
ing matter and at the same time is
contributing to special phases of the
biology of the sea," was Dr. Fisher's
interpretation in a recent interview
of the station's investigations.

Stanford University, "located some
30 miles south of San Francisco in
the mild and salubrious climate of
Northern California," may be cele
brating its fiftieth anniversary this
year, but not all of Stanford Univer
sity is on the site of the former
Stanford Farm nor is all of Stanford
University celebrating its fiftieth
anniversary.
The majority of Stanford under
graduates are unaware of, or over
look, the existence of the Hopkins
Marine Station of Stanford Univer
sity at Pacific Grove.
Though the marine station dates
from the first days of the University,
it was not opened until the summer
of 1892. Therefore the marine bio
logical laboratory has still to cele
brate its fiftieth anniversary. But
even during the hectic first few
months of the University's existence,
President Jordan, Trustee Timothy
Hopkins—son of Mark Hopkins, one
of the West's "Big Four" and a
mainstay of Stanford for most of its
first half century—and Professors
Oliver Pebbles Jenkins and Charles
H. Gilbert had decided upon the
need and desirability of such a sta
tion at Pacific Grove.
Other Successes
The success of biological stations
at Naples, Woods Hole in Massa
chusetts, Dr. Jordan's study under
Louis Agassiz, and Mr. Hopkins' visit
to the Stazione Zoologies at Naples
suggested the establishment of the
Pacific Grove station. Exceeded only
by the famous Woods Hole station in
Masachusetts, the Peninsula "is one
of the best locations in the United
States for marine study because it
is on a granite outcrop, estimated to
be between 250 and 500 million years
in geological age," according to Pro
fessor Harold Heath of the station.
Two rambling wood buildings on
the point where Monterey and Pa
cific Grove meet were the home of
the station for its first 25 years. As
a result of Mr. Hopkins' generous
support of the project and through
his influence the Pacific Improve
ment Company gave the land for the
marine station to the University. But
for its first quarter century the sta
tion, though nominally a part of
Stanford, was dependent largely
upon small student fees and the
generosity of Hopkins for its main
tenance.
