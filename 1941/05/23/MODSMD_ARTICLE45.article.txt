# Cardinal Band To Celebrate 48th Birthday
## 
### 
Boasting a history almost as long
as Stanford itself, the Stanford Band
has grown with the University for
which it is an outstanding musical
representative.
Organized by Mr. Adolph G. Kauf
man, '97, in 1893 with less than a
dozen members, the group took part
in the celebration of Palo Alto's in
corporation the next year. It had
gained in popularity and number
when it posed for a picture in 1903
with a membership of 23, all clad in
uniforms fashioned after old-style
military dress.
Snappy gold trim had been added
to the uniforms when the bandsmen
of 1904-5 posed for their portraits.
The leader of the group was Merle
H. Thorpe, father of Merle H. Thorpe,
Jr., '26, editor of The Nation's Busi
ness. Playing solo cornet in this ag
jregation was the son of a r local
music teacher, Leland Cutler, now
o resident of the Board of Trustees.
Dr. Martin Leads
In 1908, Dr. Ernest Whitney Mar
in, now professor emeritus of clas
sics, took over the leadership of the
band. During the nearly two dec
ades in which he served as its head,
it expanded in fame and number,
finally reaching a membership of
over 100 students. A member of the
class of '01, Professor Martin was
the composer of "Stanford Forever."
Mr. Will H. Bickett became di
rector upon Dr. Martin's retirement
in 1934. For the first time in its
history the band appeared on a
regular Concert Series program
when it presented a successful con
cert in colaboration with the glee
club and orchestra the next year.
Since 1938 the tooters have been
under the direction of Charles R.
Bubb, Jr., who played solo tornet
with the group during his college
career. In addition to instructing
from 60 to 90 band members, he
doubles as acting instructor in math
ematics. The 1941 band that repre
sented Stanford in the Rose Parade
and Rose Bowl spectacle was com
posed of 80 musicians drawn from
every class in school.
Spectacular incident
One of the more spectacular inci
dents in the history of the Stanford
Band occurred in the fall of 1938
when a campus controversy was cre
ated when a high school girl, with
twirling baton and bare legs, led the
marching men for the first time at a
football game. After a threatened
band strike, insults and apologies,
the affair was tabled, and the Stan
ford Band has remained a strictly
male organization.
As in past years, the Stanford
Band plays a noteworthy part in
life on the Farm by providing pep
songs at rallies and athletic events,
adding to the brilliance of football
season with their musical maneu
vering in bright red and white uni
forms, and contributing culture in
regular classical concerts.


ONE CF STANFORD'S MOST FAMOUS TRADITIONS for many years centered
arond the Law Steps, shown above. Students of the Law School years ago
declared them for Law students' use exclsively, and woe be to any Stanford
woman who ventured to sit on them between classes. To prove their point
they placed a white marker stone at the foot of the steps, which is still there.
In recent years, however, the tradition has lost its force, and the Law Steps
have become a between-classes gathering place for Stanford students of
both sexes.
