r | I HE Axis, hud a great day yester
day. Of course they had a bet
ter day according to their own news
papers than they had in the British
press. But any way you look at it
they accomplished something darned
spectacular.
The Crete attack alone would be
enough for any country to crow
about. The Germans are doing their
share of crowing, while the British
have gloomily admitted that they
have lost control of the air over
Creteâ€”simply because they haven't
any place to land, and Winston
Churchill indicated a pretty unpleas
ant state of affairs when he said that
the British, Greek, and German
forces on Crete are locked in a grim
battle to the death because "neither
side has any means of retreat."
This is literally true, and brings
us to the second German claim of
the day. If the Germans succeed
ed in dive bombing all those ships
out of commission, they have won
the greatest naval battle since Jut
land. Neither the British attack
on the French at Oran nor the
British-Italian Battle of Cape
Matapan could compare with it.
On the other hand, the Germans
admit that they have not yet been
able to land a force on Crete, except
by plane and glider. And the British
communique claims English units
have sunk at least two Nazi trans
ports and a destroyer besides smaller
ships, and chased a convoy of thirty
ships back to the Greek mainland.
To date 30 transports have been sent
to try the Crete landing, and not one
of them has made it. Many of the
ships being used were Greek fishing
craft, and the loss of life must have
been rather large, since the light
boats could simply be blown to bits.

r other Axis claim for the day
comes from Rome. A special
Italian communique states that their
forces are closing in on the be
sieged British garrison which has
been holding out since April 9 at
Tobruk in Libya. The Cairo com
munique didn't even mention To
bruk. and dismissed the whole Lib
yan war with the comment that only
light skirmishes had taken place.
A far more likely story came from
Istanbul where military observers
predicted an imminent German par
achute invasion of the British island
fortress of Cypress, eastern anchor
of Britain's Mediterranean strong
holds.
No method of defense has been
worked out for a parachute inva
sion. The Hollanders and Belgians
were completely baffled. Over in
Crete, the British seem equally at
a loss. It's dear that some feas
ible defense must be formulated.
Otherwise, the British Isles are go
ing to have a very bad time when
their turn comes at playing host to
the parachutists and glider in
vaders.
If the Germans take Crete, and it
seems evident that they will, the at
tack on Suez from the East will be
come far more possible. And if
Cypress falls, the British fleet is in
no position to defend the Levant
coasts.

ALTHOUGH the looming British
undeclared war on France will
certainly bring French colonies into
active participation in the Axis war
effort, there arc some practical ad
vantages for Britain in it. Eden
claims to have "definite informa
tion" that German torpedo boats are
moving down the Rhone River
through unoccupied France to the
Mediterranean. And French heavy
industry is building planes and tanks
for the Germans.
Eden's information probably
comes from the British Intelli
gence Service operating in France.
Incidentally, it is a known fact
that every time any heavy concen
trations of men and equipment on
the "invasion" coast has made
suspicious moves, the R.A.F. has
called on them immediately.
Besides indicating the efficiency of
the British Intelligence, this last fact
puts teeth into Eden's declaration.
