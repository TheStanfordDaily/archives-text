# Harry Maloney, Dean of Farm Coaches, to Retire Next Year
## 
### 
"I guess I can't complain any
more when they call me the 'old
man of Stanford athletics,' because
this thing brings my true age right
out where everyone can see it," said
Harry Maloney, dean of the Stan
ford coaching staff.
Next year Harry will be 65 years
young, and retired from the staff of
the University that he has served so
unselfishly for the past 33 years, ever
since David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
first president, brought him to the
Farm from a Pasadena gymnasium.
SON OF IRISH CHAMPION
Born in Ireland in 1877, Harry was
the son of one of the greatest of all
Irish athletes, his father being Irish
champion in several events. Spend
ing his boyhood in and around Dub
lin, Harry moved with his family to
England for a while and then came
back to Ireland to attend a military
academy at Curraugh.
Graduating from the academy at
the start of the Boer War, Harry
volunteered and was sent to Africa
with the British forces where he
went into front line duty. A call
was sent out for volunteers for
scouting duty, and after offering his â– 
services, Harry was made a first ser- j
geant. in charge of a troop. Serving ;
for two years, Ilarry was mustered

out of the army at the end of the
war and returned to England and
Ireland in 1902.
CAME TO FARM IN 1908
After spending some time in the
old country, he came to the United
States for a visit with his family,
which has moved to Boston. Suf
fering a health breakdown, he came
to California and started a training
gymnasium in Pasadena in 1904 and
came to Stanford four years later.
When the United States declared
war on Germany, Harry was waiting
in line before the recruiting office at
9 a.m. the next day. He was placed
in the A.E.F. as an athletic officer
and served in France as coach and
trainer for the American team in
the Inter-Allied Games in Paris.
Harry is again helping his adopted
country in its present national em
ergency by traveling around to the
different army camps in this vicinity
and making recommendations as to
the improvement of the athletic
programs and facilities.
