# Band to Present Concert at Lake
## 
### 
A band concert on the boathouse
deck will be presented for sunners
and swimmers this afternoon at 4:15
by the members of the Stanford band
under the direction of Charles R.
Bubb. Another concert is planned
for the afternoon of May 30.
Mr. Bubb has had the idea of
band concerts for quite a while and
hopes to make them an annual af
fair. "Students think of us as pri
marily a football and rally band,
which we aren't, and we want to
prove it to them by giving these
concerts," he said.
The plan originally called for a
series of concerts, but conflicting
dates interfered.
