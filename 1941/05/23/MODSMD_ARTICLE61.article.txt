# SPECIAL DAILY 'RESTS' MAYER
## 'Special' Was Full-Time Job 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Eight weeks ago Jerry Mayer, j
l Stanford senior, was anticipating a j
"nice, social spring quarter."
The former Daily associate editor |
and current Bull Sessioner planned |
to enjoy fully a semi-respito from
three and a half years of Daily j
grind — the pleasurable grind that :
j makes a Daily man grin a little !
when anyone mentions leisure. i
So, when you get your special
fiftieth anniversary edition of The
Daily today, handle it with care:
j besides giving a lively, informative

picture of then-and-now at Stan
ford, it represents five weeks of a
man's last spring quarter at Stanford.
Five weeks—shot right out from
under him—didn't make a dent in
Mayer's composure. Slumping a

little over his typewriter, tongue al
ternately between his teeth and in
his cheek, he announced a deadline
and tacked a battered old Manila
envelope, marked "Special Edition
Copy," up on the Daily bulletin
board.
As Mayer looks back on it, "it was
a funny thing; the deadline came

and went and that envelope re
mained flat and empty."
In other words, the editor's spring
quarter might have a few dents in it,
but everyone else's spring quarter
was intact. But not for long.
(JOES BERSERK
The latent temperament was un
leashed. Grabbing a terrified tryoutee
by his pongee shirtfront, Mayer took
several buttons off the youngster's
shirt and said threateningly, "Where
zat copy?" After this demonstration
the rest of the staff backed against
the walls furtively. They weren't
quick enough. Mayer, striding for
ward deliberately, stumbled on a
loose board and fell at their feet,
trapping them.
Raising up on an elbow, he fixed
a steady glare on them. He had 'em
now. One by one they stepped over
him, sheepishly sat down at type
writers. This was the glorious, in
spired start of the fiftieth.
NO glory
Somehow the glory and the inspi
ration were minimized for the edi
tor. It was a full time shift, and it
was nothing but work and sweat and
profanity and, yes, a little despair
too. There was the continued check
ing for accuracy in the stories, the
striving to make mediocre writing
rise above the standard by careful

Copies of the fiftieth anniversary
edition of The Daily will be avail
able today to students from S to

at the Daily Shack.

project of attaining a lively make-up
even though working without a
dummy, the elimination of errors
scattered through galleys and gal
leys of proof.
Mayer's Day (see Bull Session to
day) after 1 in the afternoon could
be summarized! like this: 2 p.m. to
12 midnight—working on the fif
tieth.
But at 2:30 one morning last week
the last bit of type was dropped into
its spot, and Charley Wegner, make
up man and Mayer's staunch ally and
chief aide, could turn his back on
the half-size forms of the special for
another fifty years.
That night Mayer and Charley
started their spring quartei\
And today the campus cashes in
on that five-week hunk out of spring
quarter. The fiftieth is out, and
while it may not represent the typ
ical dividend of the season to Jerry
Mayer, no one who leafs through it
can escape the observation that it's
a job of awesome proportions ful
filled to the 'nth degree of excel
lence.

Mayer's Day (see Bull Session to
day) after 1 in the afternoon could
be summarized! like this: 2 p.m. to
12 midnight—working on the fif
tieth.
But at 2:30 one morning last week
the last bit of type was dropped into
its spot, and Charley Wegner, make
up man and Mayer's staunch ally and
chief aide, could turn his back on
the half-size forms of the special for
another fifty years.
That night Mayer and Charley
started their spring quartei\
And today the campus cashes in
on that five-week hunk out of spring
quarter. The fiftieth is out, and
while it may not represent the typ
ical dividend of the season to Jerry
Mayer, no one who leafs through it
can escape the observation that it's
a job of awesome proportions ful
filled to the 'nth degree of excel
lence.
Eight weeks ago Jerry Mayer, j
l Stanford senior, was anticipating a j
"nice, social spring quarter."
The former Daily associate editor |
and current Bull Sessioner planned |
to enjoy fully a semi-respito from
three and a half years of Daily j
grind — the pleasurable grind that :
j makes a Daily man grin a little !
when anyone mentions leisure. i
So, when you get your special
fiftieth anniversary edition of The
Daily today, handle it with care:
j besides giving a lively, informative

picture of then-and-now at Stan
ford, it represents five weeks of a
man's last spring quarter at Stanford.
Five weeks—shot right out from
under him—didn't make a dent in
Mayer's composure. Slumping a

little over his typewriter, tongue al
ternately between his teeth and in
his cheek, he announced a deadline
and tacked a battered old Manila
envelope, marked "Special Edition
Copy," up on the Daily bulletin
board.
As Mayer looks back on it, "it was
a funny thing; the deadline came

and went and that envelope re
mained flat and empty."
In other words, the editor's spring
quarter might have a few dents in it,
but everyone else's spring quarter
was intact. But not for long.
(JOES BERSERK
The latent temperament was un
leashed. Grabbing a terrified tryoutee
by his pongee shirtfront, Mayer took
several buttons off the youngster's
shirt and said threateningly, "Where
zat copy?" After this demonstration
the rest of the staff backed against
the walls furtively. They weren't
quick enough. Mayer, striding for
ward deliberately, stumbled on a
loose board and fell at their feet,
trapping them.
Raising up on an elbow, he fixed
a steady glare on them. He had 'em
now. One by one they stepped over
him, sheepishly sat down at type
writers. This was the glorious, in
spired start of the fiftieth.
NO glory
Somehow the glory and the inspi
ration were minimized for the edi
tor. It was a full time shift, and it
was nothing but work and sweat and

Mayer's composure. Slumping a

little over his typewriter, tongue al
ternately between his teeth and in
his cheek, he announced a deadline
and tacked a battered old Manila
envelope, marked "Special Edition
Copy," up on the Daily bulletin
board.
As Mayer looks back on it, "it was
a funny thing; the deadline came

and went and that envelope re
mained flat and empty."
In other words, the editor's spring
quarter might have a few dents in it,
but everyone else's spring quarter
was intact. But not for long.
(JOES BERSERK
The latent temperament was un
leashed. Grabbing a terrified tryoutee
by his pongee shirtfront, Mayer took
several buttons off the youngster's
shirt and said threateningly, "Where
zat copy?" After this demonstration
the rest of the staff backed against
the walls furtively. They weren't
quick enough. Mayer, striding for
ward deliberately, stumbled on a
loose board and fell at their feet,
trapping them.
Raising up on an elbow, he fixed
a steady glare on them. He had 'em
now. One by one they stepped over
him, sheepishly sat down at type
writers. This was the glorious, in
spired start of the fiftieth.
NO glory

Mayer's Day (see Bull Session to
day) after 1 in the afternoon could
be summarized! like this: 2 p.m. to
12 midnight—working on the fif

But at 2:30 one morning last week
the last bit of type was dropped into
its spot, and Charley Wegner, make
up man and Mayer's staunch ally and
chief aide, could turn his back on
the half-size forms of the special for
another fifty years.

started their spring quartei\
And today the campus cashes in
on that five-week hunk out of spring
quarter. The fiftieth is out, and
while it may not represent the typ

Mayer, no one who leafs through it
can escape the observation that it's
