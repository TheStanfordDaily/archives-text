### 
Urging American aid to Britain,
Paul C. Smith, executive editor of
the San Francisco Chronicle, last
night addressed an overflow audi
ence at Palo Alto High School.
Prominent guests at the meeting
were Dr. Rudolf Holsti, former for
eign minister of Finland and consul
representatives of Belgium, Britain,
Greece, and Free France.
Smith established first the differ
ence between reporting and editorial
opinion and then went on to clarify
his own position in the present con
troversy. In respect, to the stand that
he has taken, Smith made two inter
esting statements:
"I am a warmonger. I have been
a warmonger ever since I came in
contact with the Hitler mind."
"I am a propagandist and intend
to remain one in the interest of my
opinions."
Smith divided the rest of the ad
dress into three parts. The first was
explaining the British position. The
second was explaining the British
outlook and morale, and the third
was devoted to telling the audience
how important British victory was to
America. Smith, recently returned
from a visit to England, emphasized
his explanations with graphic first
hand word pictures.
In summing up the address Smith
underlined the point that German
attack can never beat England. He
held that Britain can only be defeat
ed if America fails to maintain its
foreign policy of aiding Britain, as
established by the Lend Lease Bill.
The address was followed by ques
tions addressed to Smith by the
audience.
