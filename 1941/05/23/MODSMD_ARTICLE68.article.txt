WASHINGTON, May 22 (UP). —
Swiftly breaking developments sug
gested tonight that the Administra
tion may seek repeal of the Neutral
ity Act and concentrate a formidable
naval force in the Atlantic to assure
delivery of American tools of war to
Britain.
Repeal of the neutrality law would
mean American merchant, ships —
now forbidden to carry armaments to
any nation at war or to enter combat,
zones — could deliver the goods to
British docks.
