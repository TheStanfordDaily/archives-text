# Dramatists Plan Tahoe Stock Group
## Frankel, Milieu, Burt, Marcuse, Feldhym To Do Summer Plays 
### 
Lake Tahoe is going to get nine
Weeks of stock this summer whether
it likes it or not. However, the five
Stanford actors involved in the ven
ture hope for the sake of their
pocket book and, incidentally, their
art, that Tahoe will like it.
According to Ted Marcuse, who,
with Hal Millen and Frank Burt,
originally thought up the idea, "We
wanted to have some place where
Stanford students could practice up
on their acting under professional
condkions, and have a little fun on
the side."
Ease for the group's Tahoe opera
tions will be the High School Theater
i ; Tahoe City. The nice thing about
tl.'is theater, according to Burt, is that
ii's fully equipped. And it's only
half a mile from the Tahoe Tavern.
Lois Feldhym and Serena Frankel
will make up the other Stanford
students definitely scheduled for the
Tahoe junket. Other actors will be
drawn from the Peninsula Little
WILL BE IN 'VARIETY'
The theater will be listed in "Va
riety" as a professional one, and the
only difference between it and the
other better known summer theaters
will be that the actors will not be
required to join Actor's Equity. The
group's co-operative status makes
this possible.
Running one play a week, Wed
nesday through Sunday nights, nine
productions in all will be presented.
Although all the plays are not
scheduled as yet, Marcuse listed the
following tentatively: "Petticoat
Fever," "Yes, My Darling Daugh
ter," "Private Lives," "Night Must
Fall," "Curtain Rises," "Aaron Slick
from Punkin' Crick," and an old
fashioned melodrama. "Aaron Slick"
is the greatest dramatic money
maker of all time.
