# Farm Professor Clears Justice
## 
### 
Joseph P. Bradley, who was one
of the two Supreme Court justices
appointed by President Grant, whose
vote helped to reverse the court's
opinion in the famous "Legal Tender
Cases," is thoroughly exonerated
from having committed himself on
the question in advance of his ap
pointment by Professor Charles
Fairman in an article which appears
in the current issue of the Harvard
Law Review.
Professor Fairman, of the political
science department, is writing a biog
raphy of Mr. Justice Bradley.
At the time of the decision and
many years later, charges were
made that President Grant "packed"
the court in order to obtain a re
versal of opinion which would have
required payments of debt in gold.
