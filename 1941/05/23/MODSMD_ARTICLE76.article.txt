# Davis, Astor Fib Through Goulding Hit
## 
### 
The underlying idea in "The
Great Lie," now playing at the Stan
ford Theater, is different and very
good, but the production itself was
different and very good.
This photoplay, directed very ably
by Edmund Gouluing, concerns a
real glamorous guy, George Brent,
who has a near-fatal attraction for
two young ladies, Bette Davis, the
heroine, and Mary Astor, the vil
lainess.
After the villainess thinks she gets
him, the heroine gets him, hut just
when she gets him Uncle Sam gets
him and he is lost in the Brazilian
jungle.
When both girls think he's six feet
under, Astor tells Davis that she's
about to have a family. Since Davis
is the legal wife, she persuades Astor
to give the child to her, a thing
which suits Astor fine since she is a
temperamental piano artist without
a motherly feeling.
Brent is found and comes back. He
and Davis are living happily ever
after with him thinking it's her boy
until Astor walks in and makes a
scene, but—but you pay your four
bits and find out. —H. D. T.
