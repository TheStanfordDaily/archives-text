# WOMEN'S REGULATIONS KEEP UP-TO-DATE
## 
### 
For fifty years the Farm has been
protecting its women. While the
winds of freedom blow for men and
women alike, feminine members of
the Student Body have been muffled
from the blast by careful Codes of
Social Regulations.
But these x-egulations have kept
pace with the times. As women have
asserted their independence and have
disproved their qualification to be
called the weaker sex rules have be
come correspondingly less stringent.
Today Stanford women enjoy a lib
eral set of rules, but handbooks and
the omnipresence of lock-out com
mittees make them fully aware that
their conduct is subject to control.
At first the University Adminis
tration had sole jurisdiction—both
men and women were answerable
for their conduct to this body.
Letter of Robleite
A Robleite of the Pioneer Class
wrote home to her mother that they
were expected to be in by 9 o'clock,
and be on time at meals, but added
that these were things that most of
them would expect to do anyway.
There were no hard and fast rules
during the first year—the same letter
goes on to say:
"You do not seem to understand
that we have no rules of action what
ever, and we may do just as we
please, restricted only by criticism
and the sure fact that if we over
stepped the bounds of propriety too
far we would have to go."
However, it seems that there was
little danger that these bounds
would even be approached. After
the first social event of the Univer
sity—a reception at Roble to the fac
ulty and men students, Encina re
sponded with an invitation for a re
ception and dance.
No Formal Rules
Roble's reply was cold. A mass
meeting was held in the old women's
dormitory, a note was sent to Encina
to the effect that the young ladies
preferred not to dance at this early
date and upon such slight acquaint
ance.
Freedom from formal rules was
the keynote of student affairs during
the first years. This attitude on the
part of the Administration was a
reflection of the philosophy of Dr.
David Starr Jordan, first president
of the University. But that it was a
freedom bridled by responsibility was
made evident in the President's
greeting to the entering class:
"The place is yours; it was made
for you. The professors are here for
you .... You are here to study
and we can ask you to go home if
you don't do it." And "Students are
expected to show both within and
without the University such respect
for order, morality, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citi
zens." And finally: "The Univer
sity cannot be too rigid in matters
that involve good morals and de
cency; but in matters that do not
concern these vital questions the
fewer crimes made crimes by regu
lations the better."

Dr. Jordan's ideas on the function
of rules have guided the policy of
student discipline at Stanford
through the fifty years—the uphold
ing of high standards, left to the in
tegrity of the students, rather than
to strict rules and a policing system.
Although Encina's boisterous in
mates offered plenty of problems, at
Roble Hall a high standard of con
duct was maintained, according to
Orrin L. Elliott, first Registrar at
Stanford. The Mistress of the Hall
was appointed by the Business Of
fice. In 1908. upon the recommenda
tion of Dr. Jordan, the Board of
Trustees created and filled the posi
tion of Dean of Women.
In 1910, the weight of responsi
bility for the enforcement of dis
cipline on student conduct was
shifted to a University Conference,
a representative student committee.
However this body acted only in an
advisory capacity to the President
and to the Student Adviser.
Full control was granted first to
the women, with the formation, in
1911, of the Judicial Board of the
Women's Conference. They were
given the power to maintain the
standards of conduct and regulations
adopted by the University, make
other rules considered expedient, and
to consider cases of discipline and
make recommendations to the Com
mittee on Student Affairs.
Early Closing Hours
The Judicial Board auspiciously
began its exercise of authority with
a historic case involving the use of
profanity by a young lady.
During these early years, women's

•living groups closed at 10 o'clock
each night. For dances, which were
infrequent, the hall was permitted
to stay open until 12 o'clock. When
the women were granted self-gov
ernment with the creation of the
Judicial Board, these same rules
wex*e adopted.
By 1921 Women's Conference was
issuing a Book of Social Regulations,
which forbade off-campus dances
sponsored by students. Permission
from the Dean of Women's Office
was necessary for attendance at any
other off-campus affair. Halls closed
at 10:30 p.m. although 12:30's might
be granted for campus dances.
Stanford women were guarded
from the pleasurable dangers of "joy
riding" with the following restric
tion, "There shall be no motoring
unchaperoned after dark except as
a means of transportation between
Palo Alto and the campus." Prob
ably the roads were bad.
Apparently poison oak was also a
menace then as now, for the rule
book admonished: "No walking un
chaperoned in the hills after dark
for parties of fewer than six."
Rulebook of 1922 declared "Stan
ford women shall not attend off
campus public dances, except in
Palo Alto, or enter places of public
resort."


THE INNER QUADRANGLE as it appeared in the early '20's during the period when women's restrictions forbade
attendance at any off-campus affair. It will be noticed that convention required that Stanford students "dress up"
for classes, the men wearing coats, ties and hats, and the women also adorned in chapeaux. It was not many years
later that such formal attire came into disrespect on the Farm and the students started dressing informally. Cords
and gabardines are men's standbyes now.
Living groups now closed at 10:30
o'clock on weak nights, and at 11:30
o'clock on week nights, and at 11:30
out women might stay out until
1:30 o'clock on Friday or Saturday
nights. But they were not allowed
to smoke—this habit was declared
to be contrary to the University
sentiment, and infractions were en
forced under the Honor Code. By
1924 women could smoke in their
living groups, but not on the streets
or on the campus.
The next major change in closing
hours was announced in 1931, when
12 o'clock became the closing hour
for week-end nights, 1:30 late-leaves
with 2:3o's on special occasions.
By 1934 the social regulations were
substantially the same as they are
now—no restrictions on smoking,
and 2:30 o'clock late leaves.
Today Women's Conference makes
the rules, lockout committees backed
by Women's Council enforce them.
But in the freedom of 1941's regula
tions, the philosophy of David Starr
Jordan is implicit: high standards,
confidence in student integrity and
honor to uphold the trust reposed
in them, and few regulations to en
force discipline.

greeting to the entering class:
"The place is yours; it was made
for you. The professors are here for
you .... You are here to study
and we can ask you to go home if
you don't do it." And "Students are
expected to show both within and
without the University such respect
for order, morality, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citi
zens." And finally: "The Univer
sity cannot be too rigid in matters
that involve good morals and de
cency; but in matters that do not
concern these vital questions the
fewer crimes made crimes by regu
lations the better."

Dr. Jordan's ideas on the function
of rules have guided the policy of
student discipline at Stanford
through the fifty years—the uphold
ing of high standards, left to the in
tegrity of the students, rather than
to strict rules and a policing system.
Although Encina's boisterous in
mates offered plenty of problems, at
Roble Hall a high standard of con
duct was maintained, according to
Orrin L. Elliott, first Registrar at
Stanford. The Mistress of the Hall
was appointed by the Business Of
fice. In 1908. upon the recommenda
tion of Dr. Jordan, the Board of
Trustees created and filled the posi
tion of Dean of Women.
In 1910, the weight of responsi
bility for the enforcement of dis
cipline on student conduct was
shifted to a University Conference,
a representative student committee.
However this body acted only in an
advisory capacity to the President
and to the Student Adviser.
Full control was granted first to
the women, with the formation, in
1911, of the Judicial Board of the
Women's Conference. They were
given the power to maintain the
standards of conduct and regulations
adopted by the University, make
other rules considered expedient, and
to consider cases of discipline and
make recommendations to the Com
mittee on Student Affairs.
Early Closing Hours
The Judicial Board auspiciously
began its exercise of authority with
a historic case involving the use of
profanity by a young lady.
During these early years, women's

•living groups closed at 10 o'clock
each night. For dances, which were
infrequent, the hall was permitted
to stay open until 12 o'clock. When
the women were granted self-gov
ernment with the creation of the
Judicial Board, these same rules
wex*e adopted.
By 1921 Women's Conference was
issuing a Book of Social Regulations,
which forbade off-campus dances
sponsored by students. Permission
from the Dean of Women's Office
was necessary for attendance at any
other off-campus affair. Halls closed
at 10:30 p.m. although 12:30's might
be granted for campus dances.
Stanford women were guarded
from the pleasurable dangers of "joy
riding" with the following restric
tion, "There shall be no motoring
unchaperoned after dark except as
a means of transportation between
Palo Alto and the campus." Prob
ably the roads were bad.
Apparently poison oak was also a
menace then as now, for the rule
book admonished: "No walking un
chaperoned in the hills after dark
for parties of fewer than six."
Rulebook of 1922 declared "Stan
ford women shall not attend off
campus public dances, except in
Palo Alto, or enter places of public
resort."


THE INNER QUADRANGLE as it appeared in the early '20's during the period when women's restrictions forbade
attendance at any off-campus affair. It will be noticed that convention required that Stanford students "dress up"
for classes, the men wearing coats, ties and hats, and the women also adorned in chapeaux. It was not many years
later that such formal attire came into disrespect on the Farm and the students started dressing informally. Cords
and gabardines are men's standbyes now.
Living groups now closed at 10:30
o'clock on weak nights, and at 11:30
o'clock on week nights, and at 11:30
out women might stay out until
1:30 o'clock on Friday or Saturday
nights. But they were not allowed
to smoke—this habit was declared
to be contrary to the University
sentiment, and infractions were en
forced under the Honor Code. By
1924 women could smoke in their
living groups, but not on the streets
or on the campus.
The next major change in closing
hours was announced in 1931, when
12 o'clock became the closing hour
for week-end nights, 1:30 late-leaves
with 2:3o's on special occasions.
By 1934 the social regulations were
substantially the same as they are
now—no restrictions on smoking,
and 2:30 o'clock late leaves.
Today Women's Conference makes
the rules, lockout committees backed
by Women's Council enforce them.
But in the freedom of 1941's regula
tions, the philosophy of David Starr
Jordan is implicit: high standards,
confidence in student integrity and
honor to uphold the trust reposed
in them, and few regulations to en
force discipline.
For fifty years the Farm has been
protecting its women. While the
winds of freedom blow for men and
women alike, feminine members of
the Student Body have been muffled
from the blast by careful Codes of
Social Regulations.
But these x-egulations have kept
pace with the times. As women have
asserted their independence and have
disproved their qualification to be
called the weaker sex rules have be
come correspondingly less stringent.
Today Stanford women enjoy a lib
eral set of rules, but handbooks and
the omnipresence of lock-out com
mittees make them fully aware that
their conduct is subject to control.
At first the University Adminis
tration had sole jurisdiction—both
men and women were answerable
for their conduct to this body.
Letter of Robleite
A Robleite of the Pioneer Class
wrote home to her mother that they
were expected to be in by 9 o'clock,
and be on time at meals, but added
that these were things that most of
them would expect to do anyway.
There were no hard and fast rules
during the first year—the same letter
goes on to say:
"You do not seem to understand
that we have no rules of action what
ever, and we may do just as we
please, restricted only by criticism
and the sure fact that if we over
stepped the bounds of propriety too
far we would have to go."
However, it seems that there was
little danger that these bounds
would even be approached. After
the first social event of the Univer
sity—a reception at Roble to the fac
ulty and men students, Encina re
sponded with an invitation for a re
ception and dance.
No Formal Rules
Roble's reply was cold. A mass
meeting was held in the old women's
dormitory, a note was sent to Encina
to the effect that the young ladies
preferred not to dance at this early
date and upon such slight acquaint
ance.
Freedom from formal rules was
the keynote of student affairs during
the first years. This attitude on the
part of the Administration was a
reflection of the philosophy of Dr.
David Starr Jordan, first president
of the University. But that it was a
freedom bridled by responsibility was
made evident in the President's

infrequent, the hall was permitted
to stay open until 12 o'clock. When
the women were granted self-gov
ernment with the creation of the
Judicial Board, these same rules
wex*e adopted.
By 1921 Women's Conference was
issuing a Book of Social Regulations,
which forbade off-campus dances
sponsored by students. Permission
from the Dean of Women's Office
was necessary for attendance at any
other off-campus affair. Halls closed
at 10:30 p.m. although 12:30's might
be granted for campus dances.
Stanford women were guarded
from the pleasurable dangers of "joy
riding" with the following restric
tion, "There shall be no motoring
unchaperoned after dark except as
a means of transportation between
Palo Alto and the campus." Prob
ably the roads were bad.
Apparently poison oak was also a
menace then as now, for the rule
book admonished: "No walking un
chaperoned in the hills after dark
for parties of fewer than six."
Rulebook of 1922 declared "Stan
ford women shall not attend off
campus public dances, except in
Palo Alto, or enter places of public
resort."


THE INNER QUADRANGLE as it appeared in the early '20's during the period when women's restrictions forbade
attendance at any off-campus affair. It will be noticed that convention required that Stanford students "dress up"
for classes, the men wearing coats, ties and hats, and the women also adorned in chapeaux. It was not many years
later that such formal attire came into disrespect on the Farm and the students started dressing informally. Cords
and gabardines are men's standbyes now.
Living groups now closed at 10:30
o'clock on weak nights, and at 11:30
o'clock on week nights, and at 11:30
out women might stay out until
1:30 o'clock on Friday or Saturday
nights. But they were not allowed
to smoke—this habit was declared
to be contrary to the University
sentiment, and infractions were en
forced under the Honor Code. By
1924 women could smoke in their
living groups, but not on the streets
or on the campus.
The next major change in closing
hours was announced in 1931, when
12 o'clock became the closing hour
for week-end nights, 1:30 late-leaves
with 2:3o's on special occasions.
By 1934 the social regulations were
substantially the same as they are
now—no restrictions on smoking,
and 2:30 o'clock late leaves.
Today Women's Conference makes
the rules, lockout committees backed
by Women's Council enforce them.
But in the freedom of 1941's regula
tions, the philosophy of David Starr
Jordan is implicit: high standards,
confidence in student integrity and
honor to uphold the trust reposed
in them, and few regulations to en
force discipline.
For fifty years the Farm has been
protecting its women. While the
winds of freedom blow for men and
women alike, feminine members of
the Student Body have been muffled
from the blast by careful Codes of
Social Regulations.
But these x-egulations have kept
pace with the times. As women have
asserted their independence and have
disproved their qualification to be
called the weaker sex rules have be
come correspondingly less stringent.
Today Stanford women enjoy a lib
eral set of rules, but handbooks and
the omnipresence of lock-out com
mittees make them fully aware that
their conduct is subject to control.
At first the University Adminis
tration had sole jurisdiction—both
men and women were answerable
for their conduct to this body.
Letter of Robleite
A Robleite of the Pioneer Class
wrote home to her mother that they
were expected to be in by 9 o'clock,
and be on time at meals, but added
that these were things that most of
them would expect to do anyway.
There were no hard and fast rules
during the first year—the same letter
goes on to say:
"You do not seem to understand
that we have no rules of action what
ever, and we may do just as we
please, restricted only by criticism
and the sure fact that if we over
stepped the bounds of propriety too
far we would have to go."
However, it seems that there was
little danger that these bounds
would even be approached. After
the first social event of the Univer
sity—a reception at Roble to the fac
ulty and men students, Encina re
sponded with an invitation for a re
ception and dance.
No Formal Rules
Roble's reply was cold. A mass
meeting was held in the old women's
dormitory, a note was sent to Encina
to the effect that the young ladies
preferred not to dance at this early
date and upon such slight acquaint
ance.
Freedom from formal rules was
the keynote of student affairs during
the first years. This attitude on the
part of the Administration was a
reflection of the philosophy of Dr.
David Starr Jordan, first president
of the University. But that it was a
freedom bridled by responsibility was
made evident in the President's
greeting to the entering class:
"The place is yours; it was made
for you. The professors are here for
you .... You are here to study
and we can ask you to go home if
you don't do it." And "Students are
expected to show both within and
without the University such respect
for order, morality, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citi
zens." And finally: "The Univer
sity cannot be too rigid in matters
that involve good morals and de
cency; but in matters that do not
concern these vital questions the
fewer crimes made crimes by regu
lations the better."

Dr. Jordan's ideas on the function
of rules have guided the policy of
student discipline at Stanford
through the fifty years—the uphold
ing of high standards, left to the in
tegrity of the students, rather than
to strict rules and a policing system.
Although Encina's boisterous in
mates offered plenty of problems, at
Roble Hall a high standard of con
duct was maintained, according to
Orrin L. Elliott, first Registrar at
Stanford. The Mistress of the Hall
was appointed by the Business Of
fice. In 1908. upon the recommenda
tion of Dr. Jordan, the Board of
Trustees created and filled the posi
tion of Dean of Women.
In 1910, the weight of responsi
bility for the enforcement of dis
cipline on student conduct was
shifted to a University Conference,
a representative student committee.
However this body acted only in an
advisory capacity to the President
and to the Student Adviser.
Full control was granted first to
the women, with the formation, in
1911, of the Judicial Board of the
Women's Conference. They were
given the power to maintain the
standards of conduct and regulations
adopted by the University, make
other rules considered expedient, and
to consider cases of discipline and
make recommendations to the Com
mittee on Student Affairs.

mittees make them fully aware that
their conduct is subject to control.
At first the University Adminis
tration had sole jurisdiction—both
men and women were answerable
for their conduct to this body.
Letter of Robleite
A Robleite of the Pioneer Class
wrote home to her mother that they
were expected to be in by 9 o'clock,
and be on time at meals, but added
that these were things that most of
them would expect to do anyway.
There were no hard and fast rules
during the first year—the same letter
goes on to say:
"You do not seem to understand
that we have no rules of action what
ever, and we may do just as we
please, restricted only by criticism
and the sure fact that if we over
stepped the bounds of propriety too
far we would have to go."
However, it seems that there was
little danger that these bounds
would even be approached. After
the first social event of the Univer
sity—a reception at Roble to the fac
ulty and men students, Encina re
sponded with an invitation for a re
ception and dance.
No Formal Rules
Roble's reply was cold. A mass
meeting was held in the old women's
dormitory, a note was sent to Encina
to the effect that the young ladies
preferred not to dance at this early
date and upon such slight acquaint
ance.
Freedom from formal rules was
the keynote of student affairs during
the first years. This attitude on the
part of the Administration was a
reflection of the philosophy of Dr.
David Starr Jordan, first president
of the University. But that it was a
freedom bridled by responsibility was
made evident in the President's
greeting to the entering class:
"The place is yours; it was made
for you. The professors are here for
you .... You are here to study
and we can ask you to go home if
you don't do it." And "Students are
expected to show both within and
without the University such respect
for order, morality, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citi
zens." And finally: "The Univer
sity cannot be too rigid in matters
that involve good morals and de
cency; but in matters that do not
concern these vital questions the
fewer crimes made crimes by regu
lations the better."

Dr. Jordan's ideas on the function
of rules have guided the policy of
student discipline at Stanford
through the fifty years—the uphold
ing of high standards, left to the in
tegrity of the students, rather than
to strict rules and a policing system.
Although Encina's boisterous in
mates offered plenty of problems, at
Roble Hall a high standard of con
duct was maintained, according to
Orrin L. Elliott, first Registrar at
Stanford. The Mistress of the Hall
was appointed by the Business Of
fice. In 1908. upon the recommenda
tion of Dr. Jordan, the Board of
Trustees created and filled the posi
tion of Dean of Women.
In 1910, the weight of responsi
bility for the enforcement of dis
cipline on student conduct was
shifted to a University Conference,
a representative student committee.
However this body acted only in an
advisory capacity to the President
and to the Student Adviser.
Full control was granted first to
the women, with the formation, in
1911, of the Judicial Board of the
Women's Conference. They were
given the power to maintain the
standards of conduct and regulations
adopted by the University, make
other rules considered expedient, and
to consider cases of discipline and
make recommendations to the Com
mittee on Student Affairs.
Early Closing Hours
The Judicial Board auspiciously
began its exercise of authority with
a historic case involving the use of
profanity by a young lady.
During these early years, women's

•living groups closed at 10 o'clock
each night. For dances, which were
infrequent, the hall was permitted
to stay open until 12 o'clock. When
the women were granted self-gov
ernment with the creation of the
Judicial Board, these same rules
wex*e adopted.
By 1921 Women's Conference was
issuing a Book of Social Regulations,
which forbade off-campus dances
sponsored by students. Permission
from the Dean of Women's Office
was necessary for attendance at any
other off-campus affair. Halls closed
at 10:30 p.m. although 12:30's might
be granted for campus dances.
Stanford women were guarded
from the pleasurable dangers of "joy
riding" with the following restric
tion, "There shall be no motoring
unchaperoned after dark except as
a means of transportation between
Palo Alto and the campus." Prob
ably the roads were bad.
Apparently poison oak was also a
menace then as now, for the rule
book admonished: "No walking un
chaperoned in the hills after dark
for parties of fewer than six."
Rulebook of 1922 declared "Stan
ford women shall not attend off
campus public dances, except in
Palo Alto, or enter places of public
resort."


THE INNER QUADRANGLE as it appeared in the early '20's during the period when women's restrictions forbade
attendance at any off-campus affair. It will be noticed that convention required that Stanford students "dress up"
for classes, the men wearing coats, ties and hats, and the women also adorned in chapeaux. It was not many years
later that such formal attire came into disrespect on the Farm and the students started dressing informally. Cords
and gabardines are men's standbyes now.
Living groups now closed at 10:30
o'clock on weak nights, and at 11:30
o'clock on week nights, and at 11:30
out women might stay out until
1:30 o'clock on Friday or Saturday
nights. But they were not allowed
to smoke—this habit was declared
to be contrary to the University
sentiment, and infractions were en
forced under the Honor Code. By
1924 women could smoke in their
living groups, but not on the streets
or on the campus.
The next major change in closing
hours was announced in 1931, when
12 o'clock became the closing hour
for week-end nights, 1:30 late-leaves
with 2:3o's on special occasions.
By 1934 the social regulations were
substantially the same as they are
now—no restrictions on smoking,
and 2:30 o'clock late leaves.
Today Women's Conference makes
the rules, lockout committees backed
by Women's Council enforce them.
But in the freedom of 1941's regula
tions, the philosophy of David Starr
Jordan is implicit: high standards,
confidence in student integrity and
honor to uphold the trust reposed
in them, and few regulations to en
force discipline.

For fifty years the Farm has been
protecting its women. While the
winds of freedom blow for men and
women alike, feminine members of
the Student Body have been muffled
from the blast by careful Codes of
Social Regulations.
But these x-egulations have kept
pace with the times. As women have
asserted their independence and have
disproved their qualification to be
called the weaker sex rules have be
come correspondingly less stringent.

would even be approached. After
the first social event of the Univer
sity—a reception at Roble to the fac
ulty and men students, Encina re
sponded with an invitation for a re
ception and dance.
No Formal Rules
Roble's reply was cold. A mass
meeting was held in the old women's
dormitory, a note was sent to Encina
to the effect that the young ladies
preferred not to dance at this early
date and upon such slight acquaint
ance.
Freedom from formal rules was
the keynote of student affairs during
the first years. This attitude on the
part of the Administration was a
reflection of the philosophy of Dr.
David Starr Jordan, first president
of the University. But that it was a
freedom bridled by responsibility was
made evident in the President's
greeting to the entering class:
"The place is yours; it was made
for you. The professors are here for
you .... You are here to study
and we can ask you to go home if
you don't do it." And "Students are
expected to show both within and
without the University such respect
for order, morality, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citi
zens." And finally: "The Univer
sity cannot be too rigid in matters
that involve good morals and de
cency; but in matters that do not
concern these vital questions the
fewer crimes made crimes by regu
lations the better."

Dr. Jordan's ideas on the function
of rules have guided the policy of
student discipline at Stanford
through the fifty years—the uphold
ing of high standards, left to the in
tegrity of the students, rather than
to strict rules and a policing system.
Although Encina's boisterous in
mates offered plenty of problems, at
Roble Hall a high standard of con
duct was maintained, according to
Orrin L. Elliott, first Registrar at
Stanford. The Mistress of the Hall
was appointed by the Business Of
fice. In 1908. upon the recommenda
tion of Dr. Jordan, the Board of
Trustees created and filled the posi
tion of Dean of Women.
In 1910, the weight of responsi
bility for the enforcement of dis
cipline on student conduct was
shifted to a University Conference,
a representative student committee.
However this body acted only in an
advisory capacity to the President
and to the Student Adviser.
Full control was granted first to
the women, with the formation, in
1911, of the Judicial Board of the
Women's Conference. They were
given the power to maintain the
standards of conduct and regulations
adopted by the University, make
other rules considered expedient, and
to consider cases of discipline and
make recommendations to the Com
mittee on Student Affairs.
Early Closing Hours
The Judicial Board auspiciously
began its exercise of authority with
a historic case involving the use of
profanity by a young lady.
During these early years, women's

•living groups closed at 10 o'clock
each night. For dances, which were
infrequent, the hall was permitted
to stay open until 12 o'clock. When
the women were granted self-gov
ernment with the creation of the
Judicial Board, these same rules
wex*e adopted.
By 1921 Women's Conference was
issuing a Book of Social Regulations,
which forbade off-campus dances
sponsored by students. Permission
from the Dean of Women's Office
was necessary for attendance at any
other off-campus affair. Halls closed
at 10:30 p.m. although 12:30's might
be granted for campus dances.
Stanford women were guarded
from the pleasurable dangers of "joy
riding" with the following restric
tion, "There shall be no motoring
unchaperoned after dark except as
a means of transportation between
Palo Alto and the campus." Prob
ably the roads were bad.
Apparently poison oak was also a
menace then as now, for the rule
book admonished: "No walking un
chaperoned in the hills after dark
for parties of fewer than six."
Rulebook of 1922 declared "Stan
ford women shall not attend off
campus public dances, except in
Palo Alto, or enter places of public
resort."


THE INNER QUADRANGLE as it appeared in the early '20's during the period when women's restrictions forbade
attendance at any off-campus affair. It will be noticed that convention required that Stanford students "dress up"
for classes, the men wearing coats, ties and hats, and the women also adorned in chapeaux. It was not many years
later that such formal attire came into disrespect on the Farm and the students started dressing informally. Cords
and gabardines are men's standbyes now.
Living groups now closed at 10:30
o'clock on weak nights, and at 11:30
o'clock on week nights, and at 11:30
out women might stay out until
1:30 o'clock on Friday or Saturday
nights. But they were not allowed
to smoke—this habit was declared
to be contrary to the University
sentiment, and infractions were en
forced under the Honor Code. By
1924 women could smoke in their
living groups, but not on the streets
or on the campus.
The next major change in closing
hours was announced in 1931, when
12 o'clock became the closing hour
for week-end nights, 1:30 late-leaves
with 2:3o's on special occasions.
By 1934 the social regulations were
substantially the same as they are
now—no restrictions on smoking,
and 2:30 o'clock late leaves.
Today Women's Conference makes
the rules, lockout committees backed
by Women's Council enforce them.
But in the freedom of 1941's regula
tions, the philosophy of David Starr
Jordan is implicit: high standards,
confidence in student integrity and
honor to uphold the trust reposed
in them, and few regulations to en
force discipline.
