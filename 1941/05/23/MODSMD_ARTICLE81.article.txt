# Shaughnessy Bills 'T' Drill In Stadium
## 
### 
Well-oiled and ready to roll, Stan
ford's '41 Redskin machine comes
out from behind locked practice gates
tomorrow to cavort Headman Clark
Sftaughncssy's new frills and trick
ery before a public audience in the
stadium. Scrimmage gets under
way at 2 o'clock.
For his last spring drill session of
ihe year, Shaughnessy has elected
two squads of Reds and Whites for
the afternoon's doings. Frankie Al
bert and Ray Hammett will do the
signal-calling. Remainder of the
Red backfield will be Pete Kmetovic
at left half, Erie Armstrong at right
half, and Milt Vucinieh at full.
Completing the White backs with
Hammett are Bob Ditlevson and
Buck Faweett at halves, and Bob
Crane, full.
OFFENSE IRONED OCT
Yesterday found first and second
string outfits greatly improved in
play-running, and the whole "T"
scheme is once again rounding into
top shape. Dummy scrimmage held
the first hour yesterday, body con
tact only getting in for the last 15
minutes of the practice.
Bob Mastin continued great de
fensive work at left end on the
Greens, stopping cold the first play
that came his way. Ditlevson slashed
nine yards off right tackle, but Louis
Sloss, right' guard, and Tyler Nor
ton, center, smeared Armstrong at
center on the next play.
Albert reversed to Armstrong and
the stocky little halfback swept left
end for 12 yards, behind the brilliant
blocking of Bruno Banducci and Vu
cinich. Hammett tried the same play
to Faweett that went for six.
TRY, TRY AGAIN
Albert called for a pass and flung
one far down the right sidelines,
barely out of Bill Symes' reach.
Crane cracked center, but had to be
content with only two yards. Al
bert tried another pass low to Kmet
ovic, and on the next one Mastin
again nipped Crane for no gain.
Albert's final effort hit its mark,
20 yards out to Armsti'ong in the
clear. Vucinich ended the abbrevi
ated scrimmage by rambling first
around right end, then cutting in
sharply as Kmetovic laid a body
block on Mastin to go all the way
through the Green offense.
