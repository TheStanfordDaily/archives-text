# Basketball Varsity Defeats Veterans
## 
### 
With Fordy Anderson, Don Bur
ness, and Jim Pollard leading the
way, the Stanford varsity basket
ball team eked out a 33-32 win over
a pick-up aggregation of former
greats and members of last year's
varsity, in a 40-minute scrimmage
yesterday, afternoon which ended
the spring basketball period.
Don Williams, all-Coast forward
on last year's championship outfit,
paced the losers with 16 points, while
Anderson led the varsity with 10
points followed by Pollard with three
buckets. The all-stars started out
fast, only to succumb in the last two
quarters when lack of condition told
on them.
