## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
(Editor's Note: This is the fourth in a series of articles dealing
with the track stars competing in the N.C.A.A. next month in the
Stadium.)

This year's N.C.A.A. high hurdle race appears to he a race between
(he defending champion, a powerful sophomore, and an unsung South
westerner, white the same three men will battle it out witli two more
first-year men and a couple of experienced speedsters in the lows.

Ed Dugger, negro honor student*
at Tufts, defeated the famed Fred
Wolcott last year at Minneapolis in
13.9, a new record. He will defend
his title this year against a flock of
newcomers including Bob Wright, i
big Ohio State stickman, and Pete
I Owens, junior at Howard Payne in
Texas, who did not run in the Na
tional meet last year. Owens has j
run 13.9 and 14 flat already this
j year. However, he was nosed out at
Drake by Wright in 14.6. Wright's
best is 14.3.
S C. IVIEN HAVE CHANCE
Three Southern Californians all
' have a chance to place high this
j year, John Biewener, Art Kacewicz,
! and Don Hommel. Biewener, only
returning point winner in this event,
other than Dugger, opened the sea
son with a 14.4 race, which Kace
wiz equalled at Fresno last week.
| Hommel has yet to get in the best
condition, but has done 14.6.
Dugger placed second in the low
hurdles last year behind Wolcott,
who has graduated. Harold Stickel
from Pitt has run 23 flat and should
be Dugger's big competition. Owens
j and Wright both run good flights of i
i lows although not as fast compara-
J tively as in the highs.
! SOPHS ARE SPEEDY
MacSpeedie, Rocky Mountain ,
champ from Utah, has done 23.2,
equal to Dugger's best. Pat Haley,
sophomore sprinter from Washing
ington State, will figure prominently
if he chooses to run the hurdle race, j
Revell, another soph, has done 23.4,
but may not compete in the N.C.A.A.
