# "Short of War"
## 
### 
THE fundamental difference between isola
tionist and interventionist is a difference of
opinion on just how we can best keep this
country out of a losing war.
If England falls, whether or not we take up
arms to help her, we must face the fact that the
United States will be alone in her stand against
Germany. Three-fourths of the world will be
under German control. Europe, Asia and Africa
will be subject-states and all their industry and
cheap labor will be massed against o.ur own
highly-paid industries.
The arms and men of all this vast empire will
be lined against ours. Nor is there any absolute
assurance that South America will uphold its
end of the Monroe Doctrine and side with us
against the totalitarian powers of the world.
And so, war or no war, America must arm.
Isolationist and interventionist agree up to
this point. It is upon the best solution to the
problem that these two schools of thought
differ.
Some feel, in varying forms of intensity, that
we now must jump lock, stock and barrel to the
side of England. Some feel that our immediate
job is the building for England of the materials
of war.
Several European nations, closer to the scene
of conflict than we, chose the former course.
They are now German slave-states.
Certainly America is bigger and more power
ful than Greece, Norway and lugoslavia. But,
like them, we are unprepared. We are not mate
rially or mentally prepared for war. Scores of
directional failures and industrial tie-ups prove
we are not.
But unlike them we can prepare ourselves if
we have the time and the will to do the job.
And meanwhile, we can bend every effort to
the task of making the stuff of war for England.
Facts, and not hysterics, must be the basis
for this country's course of action. If actual
preparation for war were a fact the argument
of isolationist versus interventionist would be
on an entirely different basis.
At its own expense this country is now send
ing millions of dollars' worth of war goods to
England. Riskyâ€”but the best policy on the
basis of Churchill's promises that England
wants material and not men, and on the assur
ances of Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Willkie that
American aid would help avert war by being
"short of war."
America is now faced by two major jobs.
First is the task of keeping out of war while we
prepare for war with the utmost of our ability.
The second job is that of manufacturing those
millions of dollars of war goods that will help
England.
If we forget facts for hysterics we face the
grave possibility of failing at both tasks.
As someone said recently, "the only way one
can successfully deal with Hitler is to place as
big a gun on the table as he does."
