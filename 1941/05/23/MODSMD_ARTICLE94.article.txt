# Stanford—Educational Bargain
## 
### 
WHEN Stanford's tuition took a flyer last
year, much was said, to justify the raise,
about the tuitions of other institutions of equal
caliber. Our tuition is still lower, at S34s—tack
on the Community Fee and make it $390—than
the 5412 average of seven representative East
ern schools.
But, then again, it's still pretty high.
This question of high tuition has led many
students and parents to wonder just "what ad

vantage is there in going to such a high-priced
school; wouldn't a larger, state university give
my son (or daughter) just as good an educa
tion?"
The answer is a very emphatic "no."
We could go into rhetoric on that, but a few
minutes with an adding machine and pages 529
to 537 of the World Almanac will furnish con
vincing proof of the correctness of this answer.
There is one faculty member at Stanford for
approximately every seven students. At those
seven Eastern schools with the high tuition the
number of students per faculty member ranges
from four to nine. Harvard has the four and
Dartmouth the nine.
But match these against three other repre
sentative Pacific Coast universities, California,
U.S.C., and Washington, where the ratios are
thirteen, fifteen, and eighteen to one respec
tively. And the figures run just about the same
at schools like Minnesota, Alabama, Nebraska
and the rest.
So with high tuition and all taken into con
sideration, Stanford is truly an educational
bargain.—C. B.
