# BULL SESSION
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
MY DAY
life of a columnist is a hazardous one. It entails
budgeting one's day to the very minute so that no
time will be lost. Inasmuch as many people have asked
me where I found time to write Bull Session, I am
releasing for publication my usual daily agenda. I
will devote a future column to answering persons who
ask me why I find time to write this column.
