# CAMPUS OPINION
## CLEAR IT UP 
### 
r JiHE EDITOR, SIR:
The Daily has been fair throughout. In the in
terest of further clarity and impartiality I would like
to suggest that Uie word "isolationist" and its deriva
tives be used more sparingly, or possibly discarded
altogether.
Journalism professors point out that it is not clean
journalism to use a word which has been so distorted,
misapplied, and worn threadbare that it no longer has
any precise meaning. Professors of English teach their
students to avoid the use of confusing and ambiguous
terms.
The Daily has, perhaps unconsciously, fallen into
the undesirable habit of using the term "isolationist."
This is understandable, as the word is continually be
ing flung about indiscriminately and maliciously, in
some of the great metropolitan newspapers, which are
largely interventionist controlled. There it is done de
liberately and is very effective in coloring the news and
misleading the reader.
"Splendid isolation" is as hollow and rhetorical as
that other hoary old phrase "manifest destiny." It 110
longer has any valid meaning (just as today the noun
"liberal" has a hopeless number of meanings). For the
vague, recriminatory, and emotionally-charged "iso
lationist" it would be more appropriate and more just
to substitute the word "non-interventionist."
The group that opposed America's entry into the
last war ("to end war") and voted against her joining
the league was, with great vindictiveness, branded as
"isolationist." The wisdom of their course is open to
endless debate. But the point is that the term was ap
plied most unfairly and slanderously even then.
No one who has a respect for cold facts will deny
that Senators Nye, LaFollette, Wheeler, and Johnson
are statesmen of exceptional ability, progressiveness,
and integrity. They are avowedly against totalitarian
ism and for democracy (in spite of what the interven
tionists' smear campaign would have us believe). In
their judgment American cannot, though she be will
ing, save the democracies by involving herself in the
war and chaos toward which the administration's
present policies are determinedly leading us. At the
risk of being called "Un-American," "defeatists," and
other absurd names, they have the courage and frank
ness to point'this out to the American people. How
much more admirable this is than to assure us at one
moment that American boys will never again be sent
to die in Europe, cajole us the next with deceptive
little platitudes such as "when your neighbor's house
is on fire . . . etc.," then to maintain a petulant silence,
just when the times are most grave, breaking it only
with shameful outbursts of "copperhead" and "traitor."
Granted that "non-interventionist" is a clumsy word
to fit into a column, in all fairness it is more proper
than "isolationist," which is quite meaninglessâ€”except
when deliberately used for propaganda purposes to
color the news, confuse, and mislead. Let no one ever
be justified in accusing the Stanford Daily of stooping
to the Winchellesque typo of journalism.
