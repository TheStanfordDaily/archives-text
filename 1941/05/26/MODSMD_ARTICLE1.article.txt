### Jean Nowell 
II M.S. HOOD was launched in
* the early 1920s when a beaten
German nation was desperately try
ing to salvage some sort of work
able state system from the wreckage
left them by four years of war and
the unmitigated stupidity of the
Versailles peace. Through the fabu
lous era of the "roaring twenties"
the Hood stood as the symbol of
British might and invincible sea
power. And Germany, under its
master statesman Stresemann, signed
Locarno, entered the League, and
worked without success to get some
sort of settlement of the impossible
reparations demands.
Finally, through American help
—first with the Dawes Plan and
then the Young Plan—the Ger
man got a workable scheme for
reparation payments worked out.
And then came The Crash. With
the fall of the Reichsbank in
Vienna, and the wild-fire spread of
world-wide economic collapse, all
the "Spirit of Locarno" vanished,
and Germany's hope of any sort of
co-operative recovery under Ver
sailles retreated into the realm of
vague possibility. The Nazi party
began to gain ground.
The "threadbare thirties" more
than ever gave the Hood her status
as a legend; because Britain was go
ing in for retrenchment. She had no
money to spend on newer ships, and
besides perhaps this man Hitler
might get Germany sound enough to
pay her debts. Might be no harm in
giving the funny little ex-corporal a
helping hand. Anything to get some
money.
* * *
GERMANY, under the man
k who had gained his position by
chicanery and a little judicious
murder and arson, dug in to follow
him who might perhaps give them
back the security and world status
they had held prior to 1914. Lying,
cheating, playing all the angles, he
and his henchman, first secretly, and
then openly as they grew stronger,
dropped the committments which
bound the Reich to co-operation in
the world order, and began to re
arm.
Starting from scratch, they
worked out a new method of war
fare based* on mechanized, amaz
ingly rapid units — and airplanes.
They had a few new fast ships,
hut nothing to compare with Brit
ain.
And when in September of '39
they struck, the world a little be
latedly realized that Herr Hitler and
the German High Command had
something. And the Something
scared them to death. The United
States and Britain started out to
copy them—but Britain and the U.S.
were still thinking in terms of big
ships. Like" the Hood. At least two
Hood-sized ships of the new King
George V class are now in service.
And three others—the Jellicoe, the
Bcatty, and the Prince of Wales —
will be in service soon. In this coun
try we are rushing work on sevei'al
monsters, most of which will not be
finished until 1944 or '45.

r | I IIE Hood went down, as did the
ship commanded by her name
sake at Jutland, because of a "lucky
hit in the powder magazine." Twen
ty million dollars in fragments on
the bottom of the Atlantic. And
nearly 1500 crack officers and men
are down there too.
But this is the ironic thing. Brit
ain doesn't need the Hood. She
still has as many capital ships as
she had when she entered the war.
But she's desperate for destroyers.
She could build 20 for the money
she spent on the King George V, in
just about one-fifth the time. She's
desperate for planes. And she
didn't even have enough in Af
rica to keep control of the air over
Crete.
It was the LuftwafTe which drove
the Mediterranean fleet away from
Crete —practically handing the stra
tegic island to the Nazis with a
bouquet of pansies.
British planes weren't even nu
merous enough to get reinforce
ments to the island. The Nazis
landed them all the time. British
losses in the Battle of the Atlantic
are so terrible that she can't last
without help after January 1, 1941.
And a "lucky hit in the powder
magazine" blew up the Hood.

Crete.
It was the LuftwafTe which drove
the Mediterranean fleet away from
Crete —practically handing the stra
tegic island to the Nazis with a
bouquet of pansies.
British planes weren't even nu
merous enough to get reinforce
ments to the island. The Nazis
landed them all the time. British
losses in the Battle of the Atlantic
are so terrible that she can't last
without help after January 1, 1941.
And a "lucky hit in the powder
magazine" blew up the Hood.
II M.S. HOOD was launched in
* the early 1920s when a beaten
German nation was desperately try
ing to salvage some sort of work
able state system from the wreckage
left them by four years of war and
the unmitigated stupidity of the
Versailles peace. Through the fabu
lous era of the "roaring twenties"
the Hood stood as the symbol of
British might and invincible sea
power. And Germany, under its
master statesman Stresemann, signed
Locarno, entered the League, and
worked without success to get some
sort of settlement of the impossible
reparations demands.
Finally, through American help
—first with the Dawes Plan and
then the Young Plan—the Ger
man got a workable scheme for
reparation payments worked out.
And then came The Crash. With
the fall of the Reichsbank in
Vienna, and the wild-fire spread of
world-wide economic collapse, all
the "Spirit of Locarno" vanished,
and Germany's hope of any sort of
co-operative recovery under Ver
sailles retreated into the realm of
vague possibility. The Nazi party
began to gain ground.
The "threadbare thirties" more
than ever gave the Hood her status
as a legend; because Britain was go
ing in for retrenchment. She had no
money to spend on newer ships, and
besides perhaps this man Hitler
might get Germany sound enough to
pay her debts. Might be no harm in
giving the funny little ex-corporal a
helping hand. Anything to get some
money.

GERMANY, under the man
k who had gained his position by
chicanery and a little judicious
murder and arson, dug in to follow
him who might perhaps give them
back the security and world status
they had held prior to 1914. Lying,
cheating, playing all the angles, he
and his henchman, first secretly, and
then openly as they grew stronger,
dropped the committments which
bound the Reich to co-operation in
the world order, and began to re
arm.
Starting from scratch, they
worked out a new method of war
fare based* on mechanized, amaz
ingly rapid units — and airplanes.
They had a few new fast ships,
hut nothing to compare with Brit
ain.
And when in September of '39
they struck, the world a little be
latedly realized that Herr Hitler and
the German High Command had
something. And the Something
scared them to death. The United
States and Britain started out to
copy them—but Britain and the U.S.
were still thinking in terms of big
ships. Like" the Hood. At least two
Hood-sized ships of the new King
George V class are now in service.
And three others—the Jellicoe, the
Bcatty, and the Prince of Wales —
will be in service soon. In this coun
try we are rushing work on sevei'al
monsters, most of which will not be
finished until 1944 or '45.
