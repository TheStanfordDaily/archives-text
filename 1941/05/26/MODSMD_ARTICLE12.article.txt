## 
### 
All students who plan to work on
NYA during the next employment
period must call at the Student Em
ployment Office immediately and
obtain their time cards if they
haven't already done so, according
to Miss Adelaide Palmer, secretary
of the Student Employment Office.
If they do not, it will be assumed
that they do not wish to work for
this next period.-
