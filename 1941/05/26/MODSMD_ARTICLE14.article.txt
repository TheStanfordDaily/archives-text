# British Navy Fled, Nazis Claim as London Asserts BEF Able to Hold Crete
## Hand-to-Hand Baltic Near Malemi May Decide Six-Day Struggle; George II of Greece Safe in Egypt After Melodramatic Flight from Parachute Troops

LONDON, Men., May 2(» (UP).—The British fleet
and torpedo-carrying planes early today scoured a
vast area of the North Atlantic in a "death hunt" for
the damaged Nazi battleship Bismarck. It's guns sank
the 42,100-ton British battle cruiser Hood, world's

biggest warship. <
Determined to avenge the "un
lucky hit" that sank the Hood off
Greenland Saturday, the British
warships and torpedo planes of the
fleet air arm were said to be spread
ing over a great part of the mist
bound Atlantic.
FLEET STRENGTHENED
It was reported that the British
fleet in the North Atlantic had been
strengthened, both by warships and
planes, in hopes of heading off the
35,000-ton Bismarck and its escort.
An Admiralty communique last
night said that on Saturday night
British fleet planes had overtaken
the Bismarck and scored "at least
one torpedo hit on the enemy."
HAD EVEN CHANCE
Naval experts said that the Hood,
with a speech of 30 knots and arma
ment of eight 15-inch guns, was the
only British warship capable of
battling the new Bismarck and Von
Tirpitz on even terms, except for
the new 35,000-ton King George V
and the Prince of Wales.
Speculation on the Bismarck's
mission in waters in or near the
United States neutrality patrol zone
varied. It included guesses that the
German squadron was scouting the
strength of United States naval
patrols in the Atlantic, that Ger
many may have planned an attack
on British-held Iceland or that the
squadron was searching for convoys
carrying valuable cargoes.

BERLIN. May 25 (Ul»).—The British fleet has fled
from the Battle of Crete ami left British-Greek defend
ers of the island without naval or air support against
"constant waves" of Nazi shoektroops landing from
transport planes, it was claimed officially tonight.

(In Rome, Editor Virginio Gayda
claimed the German reinforcements
are being landed on Crete by sea
under protection of the Italian navy.
The Italian high command also as
serted that the British naval forces
had withdrawn to their bases from
Crete.)
The DNB agency said that com
plete German control of Crete is
"only a matter of time now." It
said that the British Mediterranean
fleet had retreated "back to its
bases" under terrific dive-bombing
attacks.
Today's high command commu
nique said that the Luftwaffe was
striking "with all the means at its
disposal" and swiftly reducing the
toe-hold of the British and Greek
troops.

with a speech of 30 knots and arma
ment of eight 15-inch guns, was the
only British warship capable of
battling the new Bismarck and Von
Tirpitz on even terms, except for
the new 35,000-ton King George V
and the Prince of Wales.
Speculation on the Bismarck's
mission in waters in or near the
United States neutrality patrol zone

BERLIN. May 25 (Ul»).—The British fleet has fled
from the Battle of Crete ami left British-Greek defend
ers of the island without naval or air support against
"constant waves" of Nazi shoektroops landing from
transport planes, it was claimed officially tonight.

(In Rome, Editor Virginio Gayda
claimed the German reinforcements
are being landed on Crete by sea
under protection of the Italian navy.
The Italian high command also as
serted that the British naval forces
had withdrawn to their bases from
Crete.)
The DNB agency said that com
plete German control of Crete is
"only a matter of time now." It
said that the British Mediterranean
fleet had retreated "back to its
bases" under terrific dive-bombing
attacks.
Today's high command commu
nique said that the Luftwaffe was
striking "with all the means at its
disposal" and swiftly reducing the
toe-hold of the British and Greek
troops.
LONDON, Men., May 2(» (UP).—The British fleet
and torpedo-carrying planes early today scoured a
vast area of the North Atlantic in a "death hunt" for
the damaged Nazi battleship Bismarck. It's guns sank
the 42,100-ton British battle cruiser Hood, world's

biggest warship. <
Determined to avenge the "un
lucky hit" that sank the Hood off
Greenland Saturday, the British
warships and torpedo planes of the
fleet air arm were said to be spread
ing over a great part of the mist
bound Atlantic.
FLEET STRENGTHENED
It was reported that the British
fleet in the North Atlantic had been
strengthened, both by warships and
planes, in hopes of heading off the
35,000-ton Bismarck and its escort.
An Admiralty communique last
night said that on Saturday night
British fleet planes had overtaken
the Bismarck and scored "at least
one torpedo hit on the enemy."
