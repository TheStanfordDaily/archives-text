### 
BERLIN, May 25 (UP). â€” One of
Britain's new 35,000-ton battleships
of the King George V class, de
scribed as the fastest and most pow
erful men-o'-war in the world, was
damaged in Saturday's sea battle off
Iceland in which the British battle
cruiser Hood was sunk, it was stated
officially today.
Although the German high com
mand merely identified the damaged
warship as one of the King George
class it was said that it might well
be the King George V itself.
