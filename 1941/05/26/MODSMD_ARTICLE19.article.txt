# Ship Strikers Refuse Peace
## 'No Coal Stoppage,'' Lewis Advises Board 
### United Press 
The $500,000,000 San Francisco
shipbuilding strike threatened Sun
day night to shut down production
on an additional $24,000,000 in navy
defense orders, increasing the sphere,
of obstruction by a wildcat work
stoppage of 1,700 A.F.L. and C.1.0.
machinists.
Defying settlement appeals from
federal, state, and labor union offi
cials, the strikei's ordered picketing
to commence Monday at the West
ern Pipe and Steel Company's San
Francisco Division—the 12th ship
building plant affected. Eleven plants
have been struck for 16 days.
SENATE PROBES STRIKE
An inquiry into the strike by the
U.S. Senate's special defense com
mittee started last Friday and was
scheduled to reconvene Monday at
Washington. In the first day's testi
mony, Admiral Emory S. Land of
the Maritime Commission recom
mended "use of United States
forces" if necessary to subvert the
strike and restore production on
vital shipping orders.
Danger olfra renewed work-stop
page in the Appalachian soft coal
fields was averted pending the Na
tional Defense Mediation Board's
full study of the wage dispute be
tween a bloc of 100 Southern opera
tors and the United Mine Workers
(C.1.0.).
LEWIS PROMISES PEACE
John L. Lewis, U.M.W. president,
said the 400,000 miners would stay
on the job so long as there appeared
to be hope that Southerners would
meet the $7 daily wage demand, for
saking a 40-ceut differential.
Strike action was threatened at
the Pontiac, Mich., machine-gun
plant of the General Motors Cor
poration unless the company grants
a C.1.0.-U.A.W. demand ft.r a 10-
cents hourly wage increase.
Construction was ordered resumed
Monday at the Ravenna, 0., ammu
nition loading plant, where the gov
ernment's $35,000,000 expansion
project was delayed four days
through "wildcat" strike action of
5,000 laborers.

to be hope that Southerners would
meet the $7 daily wage demand, for
saking a 40-ceut differential.
Strike action was threatened at
the Pontiac, Mich., machine-gun
plant of the General Motors Cor
poration unless the company grants
a C.1.0.-U.A.W. demand ft.r a 10-
cents hourly wage increase.
Construction was ordered resumed
Monday at the Ravenna, 0., ammu
nition loading plant, where the gov
ernment's $35,000,000 expansion
project was delayed four days
through "wildcat" strike action of
5,000 laborers.
The $500,000,000 San Francisco
shipbuilding strike threatened Sun
day night to shut down production
on an additional $24,000,000 in navy
