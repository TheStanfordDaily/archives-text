## Carlson Announces New Low Price; Sale To Start This Week 
### 
With Phil Harris signed for the
Senior Ball, Co-chairmcn Hetty
Moses and By Carlson yesterday
announced that the price of hids for
the traditional "last fling" will he
$7.50.
A reduction of $1 from last year's
price, this year's figure is "the low
est in the history of the Senior Ball,"
Carlson said. Tickets will go on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office some time this
week, he stated.
After staging a countrywide
search, Bob Beckham and his asso
ciates finally selected Phil Harris as
the best band available on the night
of June 13.
For a time it was thought that
Glenn Miller might be persuaded to
play a Farm engagement but a pre
vious contract with the Pasadena
Community Dance prevented his
coming here, Beckham said. Freddy
Martin, favorite of Stanford dance
goers, was approached by the band
committee, but a long-term arrange
ment with the Los Angeles Ambas
sador's Cocoanut Grove made it
impossible for him to travel to the
campus.
Ray Noble, whose stay at the Pal
ace drew throngs from the Farm,
will not complete his Catalina
Island engagement in time to play
at the Senior function, Beckham
said.
Harris, who had been under con
sideration for several weeks, has
played once before at the Ball, it
was learned, and he will bring his
entire outfit of 14 musicians and
vocalist Ruth Robbins. Customarily
formal, the Ball will begin at 11
o'clock, end at 4 in the morning with
a special breakfast served in Bran
ner dining l oom.
