' WASHINGTON, May 25 (UP). —
President Roosevelt goes before the
nation Tuesday night to report on
the increasingly serious war situa
tion. He possibly will point the way
to a new, mighty effort by the
United States to bolster the fighting
forces of Great Britain and her Al
lies.
His fireside chat will be delivered
directly to a White House audience
of Latin-American diplomats before
whom he was to have spoken a
fortnight ago. It will be broadcast
throughout this country by the
major networks and translated into
foreign languages for short-wave
transmission to other lands.
Extreme care is being taken to
prevent premature disclosure of the
nature of the speech. White House
Secretary Stephen T. Early said, "It
will not be pleasing to opponents of
democracy either at abroad,"
indicating a likelihood that there will
be no retreat from this government's
firm stand alongside beleaguered
Britain in the face of new Axis tri
umphs.
The President and his close friend
and adviser, Judge Samuel I. Rosen
man of the New York State Supreme
Court, spent the week-end revis
ing the first draft of the address.
Rosenman has aided Mr. Roosevelt
in the preparation of many of his
most important state papers.
