# Albert's Passing Tops Final Spring' Grid Drill; Ditlevsen Stamps 41 Yards
## 
### 
Field general Frankie Albert was on the beam Saturday afternoonâ€”
Stanford's All-American quarterback sensation of 1940 passed Clark
Shaughncssy's Whites to a 21 -6 victory over (lie Reds in the final pigskin
Scrimmage of the spring session.
Albert pitched the Whites to two touchdowns in the opening ten min-

utes, his longest effort hitting Freddy
Meyer for 51 yards, followed by a
short toss in the left flat to Pete
Kmetovic for the initial seore. That
dinker to "Scooter" had the whole
Red backfield completely in the dark,
and the 2500 spectators as well.
So skillfully was the play handled
that everyone in the stands had his
( yes glued on Vucinich, who tore
through left guard from two yards

out with his arms tightly closed over
nothingness, not visible to the
crowd. In the meantime, Albert
turned quickly to his left and tossed
the leather out to Kmetovic, who
was standing alone on the goal line.
AERIALS BEST
The second score came on another
aerial shot, this time 42 yards to
Meyer again. Ground gaining was
lax on both Red and White squads.
After four weeks of practice, both
lines knew the offensive workings of
the running plays cold and for the
better part of the afternoon stopped
all ground attempts.
Halfback Bob Ditlevsen rambled
41 yards down the sidelines to the
15-yard stripe, where Vic Lindskog
bowled him out of bounds. The
second-stringers couldn't score, but
they were given the ball on the
seven-yard line as result of inter
ference on pass from Ray Hammett
to Ditlevsen, from which point the
shifty halfback knifed by Chuck
Taylor and Bruno Banducci for a
touchdown.
After their second score the reg
ulars recessed, and a new White
eleven, commanded by Bob Mitch
ell, battled another Red outfit with
out much success. Red fullback Bob
Crane, who was barely beaten by
Albert in the distance kicking be
fore the game started, whacked out
a 60-yard boot. Mitchell connected
with a 27-yard heave to Burt Tal
cott.
REGULARS RETURN
The game picked up momentum
again as Albert returned with
Stamm, Taylor, Lindskog, Francis,
Banducci, Meyer, Kmetovic, Arm
strong, Vucinich, and big Hank
Norberg.
Frankie heaved one out to Nor
berg on the wing for 25 yards worth
and a touchdown. Followed another
bit of Shaughnessy trickery as Al-

Bert lined up to boot the placement,
only to pass instead, again to Nor
berg. The catch was great, Norberg
reaching way up thar' to tip the ball
into his mitts on the goal line.
Ditlevsen's tally was engineered
by left tackle Swede Johannessen,
who played opposite Banducci on
the Reds. Johannessen knows Ban
ducci's style of play like a book and
figured that he and Ed McCain split
Banducci and Taylor to make way
for Dit. The play worked like a
good thing, and Ditlevsen tore
through for the Red score.
NEW BACKS CAPABLE?
There wasn't enough running to
tell whether ihe Indian coaching staff
will forget about Norm Standlee and
Hugh Gallarneau, departed heroes,
in lieu of Eric Armstrong and Vuci
nich. Nothing was amiss in the line
men's play, neither was there any
thing ultra-special in new offensives
unleashed by the backfields.
Finding no success with ground
plays wasn't difficult for Shaugh
nessy's three quarters, Albert,
Mitchell, and Ray Hammett. Line
men were just too familiar with the
"T" pattern to let anything get by.
