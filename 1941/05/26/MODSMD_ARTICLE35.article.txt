### CHUCK SMITH 
J AST SATURDAY some 2500 Stan
j ford student football fans and
alumni members of the Buck-of
| the-Club watched their favorite
j team in action.
And they found out that last
I season's parade of touchdowns
which led eventually to a victory
! in the Rose Bowl for Stanford was
net just a flash in the pan per
formance, that football prosperity
is really here to stay on the Farm.
They saw that Stanford still has
a big, vicious, hard charging line;
a crafty little quarterback that can
hit a dime at 50 yards with the old
pigskin; and that the Shaughnessy
system is still the most polished, the
most mystifying brand of football in
| the country.
All in all the show that Clark
| Shaughnessy, his coaching staff and
j 55 members of the squad put on to
officially close their spring practice
session was a success.

JJURIED beneath the harangue and
j hurrah of the San Francisco
i sports writers concerning the world
records established by California's
i two-mile relay team and by Oro
j gon's Les Steers in the Los Angeles
Relays I found some rather impres
sive but unheralded performances.
For example, Michigan's Archie
Harris, giant negro weight man,
tossed the discus 173 ft. 11 in. with
| only little acclaim. This effort was
only 3 inches short of the world
record set in 1935 by Germany's
Willi Schroeder.
It seems that only broken rec
ords count with those newspaper
men. You may come within 3 inches
as did Harris but you've got to
break the record even if only by
the slight margin of 3-33 of an inch
as did Steers to get those writers
blowing their horn for you.
Another item way down some
where in the summaries was
"Mile Relay—Won by U.S.C.
(Smith, Upton, Bourland, and
Kerns)... .Time: 3:11.7."
Reluctant as I am to give U.S.C.
any sort of a build up, it is inter
esting to note that only twice in
track history has a four-man mile
relay team bettered this time—last
year when Clark, Shaw, William
son, and Jeffrey set the existing
world's record at 3:10.5-and back in
1936 another Trojan team ran to a
world record of 3:11.8.
And then that Right of high hur
! dies won in 14 flat by Bob Wright
|of Ohio State. In that racc Joe
Batiste of Sacramento J. C. was lead
ing by two yards until the last hurdle
when he was thrown off balance by
Art Kacewicz of U.S.C. when the
latter hit a barrier.
If Batiste had gone on unhin
dered he would have run about a
13.S flight which in itself vViJld
have been worth the price of ad
mission.

as did Harris but you've got to
break the record even if only by

blowing their horn for you.
Another item way down some
where in the summaries was
"Mile Relay—Won by U.S.C.
(Smith, Upton, Bourland, and
Kerns)... .Time: 3:11.7."
Reluctant as I am to give U.S.C.
any sort of a build up, it is inter
esting to note that only twice in
track history has a four-man mile
relay team bettered this time—last
year when Clark, Shaw, William
son, and Jeffrey set the existing
world's record at 3:10.5-and back in
1936 another Trojan team ran to a
world record of 3:11.8.
And then that Right of high hur
! dies won in 14 flat by Bob Wright
|of Ohio State. In that racc Joe
Batiste of Sacramento J. C. was lead
ing by two yards until the last hurdle
when he was thrown off balance by
Art Kacewicz of U.S.C. when the
latter hit a barrier.
If Batiste had gone on unhin
dered he would have run about a
13.S flight which in itself vViJld
have been worth the price of ad
mission.
J AST SATURDAY some 2500 Stan
j ford student football fans and

j team in action.
And they found out that last
I season's parade of touchdowns
which led eventually to a victory
! in the Rose Bowl for Stanford was
net just a flash in the pan per
formance, that football prosperity
is really here to stay on the Farm.
They saw that Stanford still has
a big, vicious, hard charging line;
a crafty little quarterback that can
hit a dime at 50 yards with the old
pigskin; and that the Shaughnessy
system is still the most polished, the
most mystifying brand of football in

All in all the show that Clark
