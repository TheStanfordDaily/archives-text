### H.D. THOREAU 
(Ed. Note—This is the fifth in a series of articles covering the na
tion's outstanding collegiate track and field stars who will he at
Stanford, June 20 and 21, for the N.C.A.A. championships.)

Two men, Lcs Steers and Billy Brown, stand far above all other con
i test&nts in the high jump and bread jump competition in the coming
N.C.A.A. meet.
Steers, Oregon's consistent record breaker In the high jump, has a

| mark better than two inches higher
than his opponents can offer. Satur-
I day he cleared G feet inches
j on his first attempt and has an in
| door mark of 7 feet V 4 inch.
EX-CHAMPS DECLINE
" John Wilson of U.S.C. and Don
Canham of Michigan are both re
turning, but have had trouble this
year leaching their 1940 form. Can
ham could only tie with three others
at 6-4 for the Big Ten title, while
Wilson is two inches below his 6-
9% jump of last year.
Boydston of Oklahoma Aggies,
Walters of Baylor, Sanneman of
Kansas, DeVall of L.S.U., and La-
Cava of U.S.C. have all cleared over
6-6 and have equal chances of pull
ing in behind Steers.
YOUNG OLYMPIAN
Brown of Louisiana State is nearly
as outstanding in his event, the
broad jump, as the ex-Palo Alto lad
is in the high jump. The slim South
erner, who was the youngest mem
ber of the 1936 Olympic track team,
has already jumped 25 feet 7 inches,
which makes him the fifth best white
broad-jumper of all time as well as
being an excellent hop-step-and
jumper and sprinter and a good high
jumper.
With U. C. L. A.'s three broad
jumpers, Pat Turner, Bill Lacefield,
and Jackie Robinson graduating,
flunking out, and leaving school, re
spectively, Brown remains the only
25-foot collegiate broad-jumper in
the country.
From the Rocky Mountains comes
Brown's severest in competition in
Utah State's Anderson. He has a
mark of 24-10 and is consistent over
24 feet.
Srx GOLDEN STATERS
From the State of California come
six 24-foot jumpers, Jim Jurkovich
of Berkeley, Jack Schilling of
U.C.L.A., Vic Chambers and Thor
Peterson of Stanford, and Ken Wren
and Mel Bleeker from Southern
California. Jurkovich has done 24-9.
but is inconsistent.
Other 24 jumpers with a possi
bility of placing in the N.C.A.A.
event are Larry Stout and Bill Lewis
of Illinois, Big Ten champ and run
ner-up, Waller Arrington of Michi
gan State, Barney Ewell of Pcnn
State, Don Blount of Dartmouth,
Charley Walker of Alabama State,
younger brother of high jumper in
dor record holder, Mel Walker, Don
Clapham of Oklahoma A. and M.,
and Christopher of Rice.

17-year-old Honolulu boy, Bill
Smith, Jr., set a new world's record
here over the week-end when he
