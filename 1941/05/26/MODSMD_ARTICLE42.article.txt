# Farm Relaymen Take Two 3rds
## 
### 
Hidden beneath the record-shat
tering feats of California's two
mile relay team and Oregon's Les
Steers were the excellent perform
ances of Stanford's little hand of In
dians al the Los Angeles Relays last
Saturday.
With Don McFarland anchoring,
iho Stanford quarter-mile and mile
relay teams finished third behind
the two best teams in the country
in each event.
McFARLAND TAKES LEAD
McFarland passed Jim Jurkovich
of Cal in the last lap of the 440 race,
to enable the Indians to finish a
few yards behind Texas and South
ern California and ahead of the
S.C.A.A. and the- Bears. The time
of 41.0 seconds equals the best
turned in this year.
After finishing sixth in a six-team
race in the two-mile relay, the event
for which the team was invited,
Blair Hyde, Ernie Clark, and Fran
cis Olson, combined with McFarland,
followed only the Trojans and Mich
igan to the tape in the mile relay.
U.S.C. won in the astonishingly
fust time of 3 minutes 11..7 seconds.
McFarland and Ifyde ran 48.2 laps,
which partially explains why the
boys from the Farm defeated Cal
and Drake in this event.
HILER PLACES FIFTH
Emerson Hiler placed fifth in the
discus amidst the best collective
throwing seen in a long time. Ar
chie Harris of Indiana threw 173-11,
three inches behind the world rec
ord. Phil Fox, ex-Stanfordile, did
169-2 after barely fouling on his
first throw which was 175 feet, best
evur recorded. Jack Hughes of
Texas got one out 161 feet while
Barney Wolf of Cal got off the best
heave of his career, 159 feet 11
inches. Hiler threw 155 even for his
best toss since the Cal-Stanford
Relays, two months ago.
