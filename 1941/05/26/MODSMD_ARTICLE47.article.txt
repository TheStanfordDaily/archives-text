UNFORTUNATELY, and so it goes in a cer
tain satanic sort of cycle with our campus
honorary groups, there comes a time when the
group becomes all too honorary —honorary not
only in name, but also in fact—to the exclusion
of active membership, of a treasury, and of a
reason for being.
Last week Excom sent a sub-committee away
with instructions to lay the groundwork for a
possible pruning of the branches on the A.S.S.U.
committee tree.
And 10, the name of Axe Society—one-time
leader in the campus activities circle —led all
the rest.
This year, with a full membership, a full
set of officers, and a blank for a treasury, Axe
Society turned in a year's report outstanding
for one thing—nothing.
No business meetings were held, and the
"men's honorary service fraternity" performed
no service to anyone. Given one service chore
by Excom, the group tossed it back the follow
ing week. And the student-faculty field day,
Axe Society-sponsored campus get-together,
fell through to top off the year.
Excdm's sub-committee Tuesday will bring
back a report on the entire activities setup for
the year, bringing in the baddies as well as the
good.
A general house-cleaning would do no one
nothin' but good.
