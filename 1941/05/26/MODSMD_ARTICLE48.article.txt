# New Blood

### 
WITH campus approval mounting behind
the plan to eliminate the caucus system in
Stanford elections and to replace it with a sys
tem of direct primaries followed by a general
election, Excom tomorrow evening will bring
the suggestion down to a final "aye and nay"
vote.
Cellar bull sessions drew a favorable picture
of the proposal, terming it a great deal sounder
and more representative than the caucus-raucus
now in effect.
The -basic question to many was whether or
not the direct primary will eliminate the caucus
evil. And on this fundamental will Excom sanc
tion be given or withheld.
Direct primaries, where the student body
and not a minimum of representatives will send
the candidates to the general election, will
pull the caucus' greatest weapon, the validity
of the statement "if you bolt the caucus you'll
split the group."
You can't snlit the group in a primary. And
you can't "instruct" the student body vote as
you can the votes of 20-odd representatives in
a caucus.
The old over-worked setup needs some new
blood.
