ACTIVITIES card files, bosom baby of the
A.S.S.U. during the past year, last Tuesday
evening was bundled neatly off to the cleaners
marked "no return."
In its stead, created by a fast-moving sub
committee, was delivered a new streamlined
plan that bids fair to eliminate the red tape and
bother that typified the card files system.
As planned and approved by Excom, the
new activities committee will operate directly
as a branch of Executive Committee, with an
Excom member acting as head of the group.
His committee members will be recruited
from each undergraduate class—one member
representing each. And this body, working on
a three quarter basis, will constitute card files
committee for next year.
Through their hands, prior to Excom perusal,
will come all committee appointments. And
each committee will receive a thorough check
before being passed on for final consideration.
The fuss and feathers of this year's trial will
be eliminated. Thorough cross-section repre
sentation will be assured by the sub-commit
tee's personnel. Minor irritants in method and
aims can be eliminated as the committee learns
its way.
It sounds like a workable basis for a work
able activities committee.
