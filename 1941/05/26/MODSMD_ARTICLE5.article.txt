FORD WORKERS in the Rouge plant line up to vote in an NLRB election held to decide whether the AFL
or CIO or no union shall represent them. Here a voter is registered and another approaches the ballot box
as a Michigan State trooper, together with labor and Ford representatives, watch proceedings. The CIO
won the election.
