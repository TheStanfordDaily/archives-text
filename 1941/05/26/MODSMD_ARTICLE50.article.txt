# Swan Song
## 
### 
THIS afternoon, minus two members good
and true, Daily Staff members file in solemn
procession to the little green shack for the swan
song of the year. Starting promptly at 1:15
o'clock, business of the meeting will include

dusting off the "30" type and readying it for
use, bringing last-minute promotion desires to
light, and laying the groundwork for the final
week's push.
Only three deep, Edit Board members will
trek single file to the edit office at 1 o'clock,
there will discuss elections and other bits of
agenda. Edit Board will sneak out the back
window at 1:30 to avoid footing the bill at after
noon club in the Cellar.
