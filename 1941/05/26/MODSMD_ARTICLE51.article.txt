### JERRY MAYER 
ON GRADUATION
senior received a mild shock last Saturday
when he attended the University of California's
seventy-eighth commencement exercises. After four
years of college—four years of cramming for courses
I wasn't interested in, four years of reasonably con
centrated studying for the courses I liked, four years of
dabbling in campus politics, by-lines in The Daily,
weeks of fast because I misjudged my allowance, days
of celebrating when the allowance held out, I have
been anticipating that my commencement will be im
pressive, something that I will always remember.
Over four thousand Californians graduated last Sat
urday, and probably the vast majority of them felt
the way I do about my commencement. Four years of
struggle and worry and sweat and laughs were behind
them. If they were candidates for an advanced degree
the number of years would have been greater, with
more worry and sweat and less laughs. Now they
were prepared to face their very nebulous future. All
they might have planned stood now, in these chaotic
times, as a detached dream of the past. They were
graduating into a tumultous world that does not meas
ure by the standards and values that a civilized world
should.
This commencement would be the last memory of
their preparation for useful and profitable living.

the commencement, at least in the eyes of this
impartial bystander, was boring and uninspiring.
I thought perhaps my attitude was caused by my de
tachment from the University. But I was sitting with
the father of one of the graduating seniors and he was
definitely disappointed. This was an anti-climax to
what he was expecting. For four years he had sup
ported his son through college and he was present
last Saturday, with thirty thousand other persons, to
see a scene in which he could feel no part. He couldn't
even recognize his son among the four thousand cap
and-gowned figures on the gigantic stadium's floor.
His son was bored, too, he us later. He could
hardly feel that he was being rewarded for years of
educational endeavor when he was only one of thou
sands who felt the same as he, whose college back
grounds were similar to his.
Are Stanford's seven-hundred-odd graduates, and
their parents, to expect a similar scene on June 15?
That is a question I could not answer positively. Stan
ford will have over three thousand less students par
ticipating in its graduation. Perhaps this in itself is
enough to insure a more personal commencement.

A CTUALLY, though, I believe that the difference
between Stanford's coming graduation and Cali
fornia's graduation is one of degree. Any graduation
that involves more than a hundred students is bound
to be nothing more than a formality. When several
hundred students are receiving their degrees, and sev
eral thousand parents, relatives, and friends are try
ing vainly to single out their object of interest, the
graduation cannot help but be a more or less dignified
three-ring circus.
Commencement exercises have their heredity rooted
in the days when the church controlled education and
only a handful of clergymen graduated each year to
take their places in the parishes of humanity. The caps,
gowns, and hoods are all of ecclesiastical origin.
But now that education has become so impersonal,
and has separated itself from the administrative con
trol of the church (naturally, with the exception of
parochial and denominational institutions), commence
ment has lost much of its feeling for the participants
and spectators.
