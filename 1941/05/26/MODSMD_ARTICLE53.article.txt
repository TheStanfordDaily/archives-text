# NO ORPHANS, THEY!

EDITOR, SIR:
I would like to make a suggestion.
Although Dr. Wilbur has advanced the opinion
that an increasing emphasis will be placed in coming
years on graduate study here at Stanford, the Univer
sity seems to lack any form of social organization for
the graduate division. If any graduate club, functions,
meetings or get-togethers exist on campus I have not
become aware of them.
We are of course deeply interested in the Univer
sity or we would not be here. But 1 do think that a
need of planning is evidenced by this apparent lack
of any organization through which graduate students
might become acquainted, both with one another and
with the functions of various University departments
with which they do not happen to be immediately
afliliated. Those of us who have, unfortunately, done
our undergraduate work elsewhere .come to Stanford
as strangers. If, as is the case with A.M. candidates,
our sojourn is limited to but one school year, we are
likely to leave without making acquaintance of other
than certain graduate students in our own department.
This situation of course does not tend toward a co
hesiveness which, it seems to me, would be desirable.
The "Dames' are to be commended for their social
activities. But waves of graduate students are one
thing and graduate students themselves are another.
Now that Stanford is fifty years old it would seem
time to make some provision to bind graduate students
together into an organization which could become an
integral part of the University family.
