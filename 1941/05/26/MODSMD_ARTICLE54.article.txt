# 'Meet John Doe' Proves Over-Ballyhooed Picture
## 
### 
"Meet John Doe," an epic now playing the the Stanford Theater, would
he a good picture if you had never heard of it before entering the theater.
However, with the tremendous advance build-up it has had, it is a flop.
The combination of Frank Capra, Gary Cooper, Mrs. Robert Taylor
(Barbara Stanwyck), and the Cecil B. DcMillian figure of 2000 extras
should have produced a :

film.
If you like to see an over-grown
boy scout being made a tool in the
hands of the usual unscrupulous
Edward Arnold-type politician, dup
ed by the woman he loves but final
ly triumphing over all forces of
evil, you will like "Meet John Doe."
The casting of the picture was ex
cellent since everyone in it is a defi
nite type. If you think Walter
Brennan, the guy with the drawl
and shredded wheat on his upper lip,
deserved his previous two "Oscars"
you will think he should have an
other.
In a short scene Jimmy Gleason
gives a very good interpretation of
a hard-boiled editor baring his in
ner soul while drunk.
The news reel's good. — H. D.
