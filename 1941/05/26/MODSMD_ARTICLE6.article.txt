### JIM WUENSCHEL 
In conjunction with the 50th Aimiversary Celebration, the University
collection of Stanfordiana will be displayed throughout the summer in
showcases on the mezzanine of the main library. Part of the collection
is now on display.
Miss Alice N. Hays, assistant librarian emeritus, is the curator of this

increasingly large collection.
member of the Class of '96, she is
now devoting her time to enlarging
and cataloging all of the various ma
terial now in the collection.
Occupying two rooms of the li
brary, the collection includes all the
files of Leland Stanford, Mrs. Stan
ford, President David Starr Jordan,
and President John Branner. Clip
pings pertaining to the founding of
the University, and pasted in large
scrapbooks by the secretaries of Sen
ator Stanford, form the earliest part
of the collection. There has been
difficulty in cataloging these clip
pings as in many cases the source
was not noted at the time.
LETTERS PRESERVED
Much of Mrs. Stanford's corre
spondence on the thick, black-bor
dered paper she used following the
death of her husband is preserved.
Family pictures of the Stanfords
and of Leland Stanford Jr. which
have been donated to the Univer
sity by old-time friends of the fam
ily ai'e also included.
All the publications of the Uni
versity's presidents and faculty
members also form a part of the ex
tensive collection. University bulle
tins and announcements of courses
are included from the start of the
school. An attempt was made to
keep the syllabi of all the courses but
this is not complete.
FILES THERE TOO
Complete files of The Daily and
The Daily Palo Alto, the forerunner
of The Daily, yre in the collection.
The first impression of the first pa
per run off is carefully preserved.
Bound copies of the Chaparral and
the Quads are also there. Alumni
publications, as far as they are
known and have been available to
the University are included.
The original red handkerchief
from which Stanford's cardinal color
was derived is preserved here. It
was waved at the first football game
between Stanford and Cal and was
donated by Scott Calhoun, '05. He
also donated a complete set of reg
istration cards for the years he at
tended the Farm.
A brightly decorated plug hat was
donated by Robert Lewis, now dean
of the school of geology of the Uni
versity of Utah. It was the fashion
for all juniors to wear these and the
delight of the seniors to try to bat
them off.
MANDOLIN PROGRAM
Programs of all the Farm's early
lecture and dramatic programs are
filed. An interesting one is of the
program of the Stanford Mandolin
and Guitar Club. Memory books,
thick scrapbooks filled with ribbons,
pictures, and letters, give a com
posite picture of the life of an early
Stanford co-ed.
The collection is growing as it
becomes better known. Old gradu
ates are turning in things of inter
est of their college days. There is
still some missing material, several
Quads are not included and there
| still are a great number of pictures
which will form an integral part of
the collection.

Occupying two rooms of the li
brary, the collection includes all the
files of Leland Stanford, Mrs. Stan
ford, President David Starr Jordan,
and President John Branner. Clip
pings pertaining to the founding of
the University, and pasted in large
scrapbooks by the secretaries of Sen
ator Stanford, form the earliest part
of the collection. There has been
difficulty in cataloging these clip
pings as in many cases the source
was not noted at the time.
LETTERS PRESERVED
Much of Mrs. Stanford's corre
spondence on the thick, black-bor
dered paper she used following the
death of her husband is preserved.
Family pictures of the Stanfords
and of Leland Stanford Jr. which
have been donated to the Univer
sity by old-time friends of the fam
ily ai'e also included.
All the publications of the Uni
versity's presidents and faculty
members also form a part of the ex
tensive collection. University bulle
tins and announcements of courses
are included from the start of the
school. An attempt was made to
keep the syllabi of all the courses but
this is not complete.
FILES THERE TOO
Complete files of The Daily and
The Daily Palo Alto, the forerunner
of The Daily, yre in the collection.
The first impression of the first pa
per run off is carefully preserved.
Bound copies of the Chaparral and
the Quads are also there. Alumni
publications, as far as they are
known and have been available to
the University are included.
The original red handkerchief
from which Stanford's cardinal color
was derived is preserved here. It
was waved at the first football game
between Stanford and Cal and was
donated by Scott Calhoun, '05. He
also donated a complete set of reg
istration cards for the years he at
tended the Farm.
A brightly decorated plug hat was
donated by Robert Lewis, now dean
of the school of geology of the Uni
versity of Utah. It was the fashion
for all juniors to wear these and the
delight of the seniors to try to bat
them off.
MANDOLIN PROGRAM
Programs of all the Farm's early
lecture and dramatic programs are
filed. An interesting one is of the
program of the Stanford Mandolin
and Guitar Club. Memory books,
thick scrapbooks filled with ribbons,
pictures, and letters, give a com
posite picture of the life of an early
Stanford co-ed.
The collection is growing as it
becomes better known. Old gradu
ates are turning in things of inter
est of their college days. There is
still some missing material, several
Quads are not included and there
| still are a great number of pictures
which will form an integral part of
the collection.
In conjunction with the 50th Aimiversary Celebration, the University
collection of Stanfordiana will be displayed throughout the summer in
showcases on the mezzanine of the main library. Part of the collection
is now on display.
