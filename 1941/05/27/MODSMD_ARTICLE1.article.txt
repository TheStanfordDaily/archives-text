### Jean Nowell 
VYfHEN a diplomat refers to the
head of a foreign state with
out using his first name or title,
you may infer that the diplomat is
really exercised about something or
other. Such formality seems strange
to those of us who have been call
ing Reichsfuehrer Adolf Hitler just
plain "Hitler" during all the years
we've known of his existence. But
yesterday was the first time the Sec
retary of State of the United States
has so indicated his displeasure with
the Nazi leadei\
Hull comes of Tennessee moun
tain stock and it is probable that
he has called Ilitlcr any number
of unprintable things from time to
time during his private conver
sations and ruminations. But,
through all the pulling and haul
ing of the last years, with this
country on the verge of war with
Germany, the State Department
has kept up all the diplomatic
amenities.
Hull was furious with Hitler and
his propaganda machine because he
thinks that new German threats to
sink any United States convoy aid to
Britain is an effort to "becloud"
President Roosevelt's fireside chat
tonight and weaken the U.S. defense
program through fear propaganda.

r | I HE new threat which caused
Hull to forget his careful diplo
matic manners was an interview
granted by German Grand Admiral
Erich Raeder to a Japanese news
paperman. Raeder said in part that
the Nazis would regard U.S. naval
convoys as an "open warlike act";
and "besides," he added, "the activi
ties of the neutrality patrol are un
neutral.'
The Germans are sticklers for in
ternational law where their ene
mies are concerned, so his statement
means little on that score. However,
when he threatened U. S. convoys,
he undoubtedly meant just what he
said. And there isn't a man in the
State Department in Washington
who doesn't know it. The Germans,
in spite of their tremendous victo
ries, are acutely conscious of the
fact that the longer the war the lasts,
the worse their chances are of win
ning it.
The German High Command
also is aware of the fact that Ger
many had won World War I in
—only the Allies didn't know
it. If you want to look at World
War II objectively you could say
that the Germans have won this
one too. Unfortunately the Brit
ish, unlike the French, don't seem
to have sense enough to quit.
Of course they'll sink American
convoys, if they can. American aid
reaching Britain in great quanti
ties will serve only to prolong the
war and strengthen the British war
effort.

IJOWEVER the effort to "be
cloud" F.D.R.'s chatsy with the
home folks is a very real one. And
Hull admitted—if any one needed
convincing — that the President is
going to say a mouthful tonight. If
the Nazis had that idea in mind
when they released Raeder's timely
little statement (and Dr. Goebbels
has seldom been known to miss a
trick) they also admitted that they're
worried about what the head of the
world's greatest neutral state is go
ing to say.
Roosevelt has owed the coun
try a speech for sonic time. The
Atlantic patrols, the Red Sea,
Greenland, the imminent junking
of the whole neutrality act—all
are matters which require a formal
statement to the people of a demo
cratic nation.
What the President says tonight
will depend, to a great extent, on
what he thinks the nation will take
at this time. All the experts, from
Walter Lippman on down, have been
yelling about his evasive attitude for
weeks. But Roosevelt is not going
to go any faster than does public
opinion if he can help it. However,
if he's evasive tonight (and it's His
tory's guess that he won't be) it
will not alter the fact that he's com
mitted to aid to Britain—even if it
means war.
