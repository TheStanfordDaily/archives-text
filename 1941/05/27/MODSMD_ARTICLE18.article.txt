# 'Villain' Undoes Diggers' Work
## 'Filled Ditch Mystery' Bewilders Workmen 
### 
For the last two weeks a small
cluster of workmen have been slav
ing in the hot sun all day to dig a
ditch from the top of the steps to
Lomita Drive by the Geology Cor
ner.
Their handiwork has been the
cause of much frivolity on the part
of Farm co-eds who insist on either
taking a running jump or being he
roically carried over this cavernous
opening that could be traversed by
a medium-sized step.
One day the brave little band of
working proletarians decided that
their duty there was ended since
they had just put the finishing
touches on this neat three-foot-deep
trough. They departed on their
merry way singing "Hi Ho, Hi Ho,
etc."
Enters the villain of the piece, the
contractor. He decides that this
opening must be filled, so filled it
is. A few deft sweeps of one of
these modern ditch-filling machines
empties all the air in the ditch and
replaces it with dirt of the clean
variety. To make the job complete
the dirt is packed down tight.
The next morning two little for
eigners, members of the original
ditching party, arc back on the job
digging the trough again. They
have a terribly bewildered look on
their beaten faces as they mutter
broken-English phrases of incom
prehension and pick little bits of
sod out of the newly packed plot
of ground.
