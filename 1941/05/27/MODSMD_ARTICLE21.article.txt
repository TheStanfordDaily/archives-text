# Daily Scribes Trace Down Plane Crash'
## Phone Call Leads To Journalistic Picnic In Wilds of La Honda 
### 
It all started when the telephone
rang during the staff meeting. An
S.A.E. called in and requested in
formation on an alleged plane crash
somewhere between Woodside and
LaHonda.
Knowing nothing of the matter,
The Daily immediately started to
check up at various airports and
news centers. The flight control of
fice of the Palo Alto airport knew
nothing and politely hinted that The

Daily was a little "tetched" in the
head. Moffett Field acted a little
better. One of their planes was a
little overdue and they thought there
might be some truth in the story.

Following this hot tip several staff
members piled into a car and headed
for the Skyline and points west.
Some of the passengers first called
San Francisco papers and arranged
to cover the story for them. After a
half hour of driving and questions at
gas stations the expedition arrived
at LaHonda. There it met a ranger
who didn't know what it was all
about, but at any rate he was help
ful and introduced the press to the
town notables. In fact they met both
of the population.
The stay at LaHonda was really
marvelous. For two hours the
scribes did nothing but sit in the
sun, meditate, and call .either The
Daily or San Francisco when things
got boring. After the first half hour
an army plane appeared in the vi
cinity. After the second half hour it
spotted LaHonda and began to circle
overhead. It was still circling over
head when the reporters left.
NO MORE MONEY
Before the afternoon progressed
very far the better elements of The
Daily had arrived and the party sat
down and philosophized. Unhappily,
a couple of Chappie and Quad boys
wiggled their way into the company.
Perhaps these men had ulterior mo
tives for being present.
The afternoon began to get cool
and everyone was running out of
money so they left LaHonda with
memories of pleasant sun, tall trees,
and a lovely waitress.

Following this hot tip several staff
members piled into a car and headed
for the Skyline and points west.
Some of the passengers first called
San Francisco papers and arranged
to cover the story for them. After a
half hour of driving and questions at
gas stations the expedition arrived
at LaHonda. There it met a ranger
who didn't know what it was all
about, but at any rate he was help
ful and introduced the press to the
town notables. In fact they met both
of the population.
The stay at LaHonda was really
marvelous. For two hours the
scribes did nothing but sit in the
sun, meditate, and call .either The
Daily or San Francisco when things
got boring. After the first half hour
an army plane appeared in the vi
cinity. After the second half hour it
spotted LaHonda and began to circle
overhead. It was still circling over
head when the reporters left.
NO MORE MONEY
Before the afternoon progressed
very far the better elements of The
Daily had arrived and the party sat
down and philosophized. Unhappily,
a couple of Chappie and Quad boys
wiggled their way into the company.
Perhaps these men had ulterior mo
tives for being present.
The afternoon began to get cool
and everyone was running out of
money so they left LaHonda with
memories of pleasant sun, tall trees,
and a lovely waitress.
It all started when the telephone
rang during the staff meeting. An
S.A.E. called in and requested in
formation on an alleged plane crash
somewhere between Woodside and
LaHonda.
Knowing nothing of the matter,
The Daily immediately started to
check up at various airports and
news centers. The flight control of
fice of the Palo Alto airport knew
nothing and politely hinted that The

Daily was a little "tetched" in the
head. Moffett Field acted a little
better. One of their planes was a
little overdue and they thought there
might be some truth in the story.
