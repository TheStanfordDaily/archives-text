# Women Asked To Ignore Poll
## 
### 
Women's Conference advised the
women who received information
blanks over the week-end from the
"Poll on the Morals of a College
Woman" to disregard them, at its
meeting yesterday.
"Since they were sent from an
anonymous source and not from the
Psychology Department, as many
believed, the best thing to do is to
forget about them," said Martha
Nordling, outgoing Women's Con
ference president.
As this was the last meeting of
the year, old and new members
celebrated with cider and dough
nuts, and the presidency was turned
over to lima Jean Hannibal.
Dean Mary Yost received a gift
of phonograph records from the out
going members.
