## Corps to Be Second Formed on Campus 
### 
Wilh the organization . last week
of the first collegiate air unit know)
as "The Stanford Flying Cadet Unit
No. 1," plans are at present being
directed along lines of organizing
another similar unit as soon as 2C
more students sign up and are ac
cepted by the army examining
board.
Lt. H. I. Egenes of the Army Aii
Corps, from Hamilton Field, is con
ducting interviews all this week and
the first half of next week in Room
538. He will be present from 2 to 4
every afternoon at the B.A.C.
The interesting feature about
these units is that the 20 members
will all go through the training pe
riods together and if possible will
be assigned active duty together
with the same tactical unit.
STANFORD FIRST
Stanford was the first unit in the
field with such an organization un
der the new training program which
was announced by the War Depart
ment recently. The examiners, hav
ing had such immediate success with
Stanford, hope to organize another
unit immediately so as to further
publicize the new program.
Lee Telesco, who was elected
leader of the first unit, has called
a meeting of the group for tomor
row night at 7:1)0 in the Military
department, where training films
wiil be shown. Persons other than
those composing the group are wel
come to attend these pictures.
UNITS TO GO SOON
The units will be sent off for their
training sometime around the end
of June so some members of the
group may graduate. The training
period will consist of three ten
week periods which will be spent in
primary, basic, and advanced flying
schools.
During the 30-week instruction
term the cadets will receive $75 a
month in addition to allowances.
After graduation and commission as
second lieutenants in the army air
corps reserve the pay will be raised
to $245 a month.
Candidates for appointment must
be in good health, be unmarried,
have completed two years of col
lege work, and must be between
the ages of 20 and 27. The govern
ment hopes to have 15,000 men in
training by July 1.
