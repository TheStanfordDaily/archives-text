# Toy Naval Battles Supply New Sport for Professors
## 
### 
Tootsie toys are at a premium in Palo Alto these days.
Dr. John Masland, political science professor, and Dr. Waldo Chamber
lein, Hoover War Library assistant, have cleaned the dime store supplies
of toy ships. Local children must sacrifice their playthings while the
Farm's professors indulge in their

{ latest game—loy naval battles.
FORMER RESERVES OFFICER
"Waldo is a former naval reserve
officer," Dr. Masland said, "so he has
a head start on me in the actual tech
nical phase of our mock naval bat
tles. I've always been interested in
the role of navies in national for
eign policies."
Crouched down on hands and
knees in the middle of Dr. Cham
berlein's kitchen floor (the ocean to
them) the professors may be seen
"shooting" battleship guns most any
Sunday night.
"We have (50 ships here," Dr. Mas
land explained, "which are divided
into the United States and Japa
nese fleets. Each fleet has three bat
tleships plus submarines, destroy
ers, cruisers, and aircraft carriers."
REPRESENT ACTUAL SHIPS
The two "fleet commanders" have
charted each of their ships to corre
spond with well known vessels in
the present fleets of the United
States and Japanese navies. Refer
ring to government publications, they
obtained figures on the gun range,
protective armor, speed, and air
craft of actual ships.
"Our game is still in the budding
stage now," Dr. Masland said. "We're
going to develop it on a big scale
this summer when we get naval re
serve officers, faculty members, and
students to play with us. So far j
Waldo and I have just fired with two
ships, because we're still figuring i
out the mechanics of the game. It's |
no child's play."
SAILS AROUND FLOOR
Armed with a full chart of statis
tics for the U.S. battleship Lexing
ton, Dr. Masland sailed his toy ship
around the kitchen for a couple of
minutes, when lo and behold he came
upon Chamberlein's enemy ship, the
Nagato. Now Dr. Masland looked at
his little chart to discover that the
Lexington travels 34 knots per hour.
Translating this figure into floor
inches per minute, the professor
made a mental calculation of the
distance to set his gun range.
"The average time allowed to aim
your guns is one minute," Dr. Mas
land said, "but it takes us at least
ten minutes."
Uncertain of the exact distance
between the Lexington and the Na
gato, Dr. Masland fires some of his
guns at 30 inches, some at 35, and
the rest at 40 inches.
"He teaches the principles of stra
tegic concentration in class," Dr.
Chamberlein commented, "but he's
afraid to risk putting all his eggs in

one basket when it comes to real
physical practice."
Nevertheless, three of Dr. Mas
land's guns hit the Nagato to knock
two knots per hour off its speed.
Fifteen or twenty more hits like that
would come pretty near sinking the
ship if the Nagato didn't shoot back
and change direction so fast.
"It's a great game," Dr. Masland
said. "We may try to figure out fu
ture battles of the United States
fleet in Asia or the possible strategy
between the Germans and the Brit
ish in the Mediterranean."

the present fleets of the United
States and Japanese navies. Refer
ring to government publications, they
obtained figures on the gun range,
protective armor, speed, and air
craft of actual ships.
"Our game is still in the budding
stage now," Dr. Masland said. "We're
going to develop it on a big scale
this summer when we get naval re
serve officers, faculty members, and
students to play with us. So far j
Waldo and I have just fired with two
ships, because we're still figuring i
out the mechanics of the game. It's |
no child's play."
SAILS AROUND FLOOR
Armed with a full chart of statis
tics for the U.S. battleship Lexing
ton, Dr. Masland sailed his toy ship
around the kitchen for a couple of
minutes, when lo and behold he came
upon Chamberlein's enemy ship, the
Nagato. Now Dr. Masland looked at
his little chart to discover that the
Lexington travels 34 knots per hour.
Translating this figure into floor
inches per minute, the professor
made a mental calculation of the
distance to set his gun range.
"The average time allowed to aim
your guns is one minute," Dr. Mas
land said, "but it takes us at least
ten minutes."
Uncertain of the exact distance
between the Lexington and the Na
gato, Dr. Masland fires some of his
guns at 30 inches, some at 35, and
the rest at 40 inches.
"He teaches the principles of stra
tegic concentration in class," Dr.
Chamberlein commented, "but he's
afraid to risk putting all his eggs in

one basket when it comes to real
physical practice."
Nevertheless, three of Dr. Mas
land's guns hit the Nagato to knock
two knots per hour off its speed.
Fifteen or twenty more hits like that
would come pretty near sinking the
ship if the Nagato didn't shoot back
and change direction so fast.
"It's a great game," Dr. Masland
said. "We may try to figure out fu
ture battles of the United States
fleet in Asia or the possible strategy
between the Germans and the Brit
ish in the Mediterranean."
Tootsie toys are at a premium in Palo Alto these days.
Dr. John Masland, political science professor, and Dr. Waldo Chamber
lein, Hoover War Library assistant, have cleaned the dime store supplies

Farm's professors indulge in their

FORMER RESERVES OFFICER
"Waldo is a former naval reserve
officer," Dr. Masland said, "so he has
a head start on me in the actual tech
nical phase of our mock naval bat
tles. I've always been interested in
the role of navies in national for
eign policies."
Crouched down on hands and
knees in the middle of Dr. Cham
berlein's kitchen floor (the ocean to
them) the professors may be seen
"shooting" battleship guns most any
Sunday night.
"We have (50 ships here," Dr. Mas
land explained, "which are divided
into the United States and Japa
nese fleets. Each fleet has three bat
tleships plus submarines, destroy
ers, cruisers, and aircraft carriers."
