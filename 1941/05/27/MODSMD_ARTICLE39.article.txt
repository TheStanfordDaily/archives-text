### 
"The Carillon," the new literary
magazine, will make its debut
Thursday when it goes on sale at
the English Corner, the Post Office,
and the Engineering Corner. It will
sell for 25 cents a copy, with over
a hundred sold in a pre-publication
drive.
The magazine will contain five
stories, four articles, poems, and
book and record reviews. Dr. Pay
| son Treat, professor of history, has
! wirtten ''Why Fight in Asia." Dr.
j Treat is a noted authority on the
Far East and has written a number
of articles on it.
Bill Kimball has written an ar
ticle of current interest to all of
Stanford's men, "College Men and
Reserve Commissions." John Lucus
authored an interesting history of
swing entitled "With His Clarinet
in His Hip Pocket."
Pat Adams wrote a short story,
"Miss Foster," about two old maids
who ran a lending library and the
troubles "those new books" cause

them. James Groshong wrote "Mex
ican Idyll" and A1 Zelver "Invita
tion to a Dance."
Because of the lateness of be
ginning work on the magazine there
is no advertising in it. The maga
zine can only carry national adver
tising because of its charter, and
there wasn't time to line up any.
