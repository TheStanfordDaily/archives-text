# Cards Face Fight For PCC Third
## 
### 
Stanford's track team started work
yesterday afternoon for the Pacific
Coast Conference championship
meet to be held at Edwards Stadium
in Berkeley Friday and Saturday
afternoons.
Since U.S.C. and California are
both in the meet the Indians won't
have a chance for first or second.
Their big fight will he to grab third
place from Washington State, no
mean feat, since the Cougars,
coached by ex-Stanfordite Jack
Weiershauser, are Northern Divi
sion champs and boast lour or five
men of top flight ability.
Washington's Huskies, runners
up in the northern meet a week
ago, will probably take fifth spot
with U.C.L.A., Oregon, Idaho, Ore
gon State, and Montana trailing.
Each team is limited to 18 entrants
in order to give the smaller schools
a better break. This, however,
should not cut down on Stanford's
chances much since there are only
about 18 men with any hope of
scoring.
Northern strength is concentrated
in all the track events except
the 440 and high hurdles, with only
a few good field event men. This
will aid the Indians and Trojans
while cutting down on the Bears'
scoring. This means that the Berke
ley institution's chances of finally
defeating the southern school are
next to nil.
Heats will be run on Friday de
pending on how the entries come in.
Probable events to have trials are
the 100, 220, 440, high hurdles, and
low hurdles.
Best race of the meet will prob
ably come in the 880 where Bill
Dale of W.S.C., only returning win
ner, will defend the title he has
won for the last two years. His
competition will include teammate
Jim Lang, Warren Smith of U.S.C.,
Clarence Barnes of Cal. Gene Swan
zey of Washington, and Blair Hyde
and possibly Fran Olson of Stan
ford. Phil Liebowitz of Idaho and
Dick Peter of Cal are excellent half
mi lers also, but may not run since
they will have run a mile pre
viously.
