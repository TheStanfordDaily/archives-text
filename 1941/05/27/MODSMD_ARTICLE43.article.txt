# NCAA Brings Poor Vaulters
## 
### 
As has been the case for* the past
13 years, the country's outstanding
pole-vaulters this year come from
California. This will be proved when
the pole-vaulting results are shown
;it the N.C.A.A. meet in the Stadium
June 20 and 21.
Guinn Smith of Cal and Willard
Schaefer of Southern Cal have both
cleared 14 feet 6 inches to put them
far ahead of all other collegiate pole
vaulters. Smith has been consistent
this year at heights above 14 feet
while Schaefer had one day in
which he defeated world record
holder Cornelius Warmerdam at
more than 14 feet.
Only other vaulter to approach
this height in a year of compara
tively poor marks is Harold Hunt
of Nebraska. Hunt cleared 13-11 Vh
last Saturday in the Big Six cham
pionships.
Stanford's Russ Peck barely
missed 14 feet in the U.S.C. meet and
swears to do it before the end of the
season. Should he accomplish this
in the N.C.A.A. he will be assured
of a high place. Ed Tomaso, other
Indian vaulter, has done 13-6, as
hij>h as or higher than most of the
Easterners have done.
Byron Dudley of U.S.C., Lute
Nichols of Cal, Bill Williams of
Wisconsin, Henderson of Arizona,
and Higgens of Missouri are the
only other vaulters in the country
with 13-6 performances.
