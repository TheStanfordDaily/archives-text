# Conn Clinches June Title Go
## 
### 
FORBES FIELD. PITTSBURGH.
May 26 (UP). —Billy Conn tonight
blasted Buddy Knox to the canvas
three times and won on a technical
knockout when Knox was unable
to answer the bell for the eighth
round. It was Conn's last fight be
fore challenging for the heavy
weight title in June.
Conn, handicapped by a recently
lanced boil on his left shoulder, got
off to a slow start against his squat,
willing opponent. They mixed furi
ously in the early going — until
Billy's steaming body blows began
to slow up the Dayton, 0., heavy
weight in the sixth round.
Conn's last showing before his
title tilt with Joe Louis at the
New York Polo Grounds was an
all-round success tonight. It was
witnessed by the largest fight crowd
in Pittsburgh history—27,o42 spec
tators—and it proved to the fans and
to promoter Mike Jacobs at the
ringside that Billy has enough steam
in his blows to stun the compara
tively weak-chinned Louis, if Conn
can get off to a fast start on June 18
and weather the Brown Bomber's
dynamite.
Billy, who has been trying for
some time to become a full-fledged
heavyweight, scaled 180' A pounds,
slightly less than he weighed for
Gunnar Barlund recently at Chi
cago. Knox, who has been kayoed
only once before, by Melio Bettina,
weighed 190 pounds.
