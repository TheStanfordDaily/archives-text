### 
The freshmen beat the sopho
mores 2-0 in the playoff of last
Wednesday's tie yesterday on the
varsity soccer field. The freshmen
ended up third in the interclass an
nual spring soccer tournament and
the sophomores ended up in the
basement.
Phil Chapman, center half for
the freshmen, made the first goal
from near center field on a long
hard shot. Bob Sol, the center-for

ward, pushed in the second score
from a corner-kick play late in the
last period. Ray Chapot and George
Koffer played their usual hard game
both on the offense and defense.
On Wednesday, which is the last
practice, Harry Maloney has sched
uled a game between the best pos
sible team which he can pick from
those eligible next fall and the grad
uating seniors. Dick Harmon and
Ned Pugh will play for the seniors.
