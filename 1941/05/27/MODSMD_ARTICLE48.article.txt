# Practice Drills Show Reserves
## 
### 
Spring football wound up Satur- !
day afternoon with a big workout
in the Stanford Stadium that decided
three thingsâ€”Frankie Albert's field
generalship is still Clark Shaugh
nessy's ace in the hole for next fall; I
the Indian linemen are on their toes
and know a little something about
their own type of "T" offense; and
there are a good number of capable
reserves spread through both line
and hackfield.
Saturday's inability by any of- j
fensive squad to penetrate an op- .
posing defense for a great amount J
of yardage on Kie ground gives the j
Redskins' low-charging front line a ;
well-deserved pat on the back.
But the pass defense was noto
riously weak as shown by two
touchdowns in quick succession,
both coming from aerials. Albert's
toss in the flat to Kmetovic caught
a Red defense completely unawares.
Maybe the new Shaughnessy pass is
tricky enough to deceive other de
fending backfields. That only re
mains to be seen.
One thing is sure. All the 55 men
who were in suit Saturday are way
ahead on what they will have to
learn when Shaughnessy sends out
the call for football players around
September next. The great thing
accomplished by spring practice is
that it puts the Card gridmen in a
position where they will not be
forced to leam something that is
completely new and unfamiliar to
them.
