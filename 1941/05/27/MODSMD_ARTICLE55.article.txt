# Good Luck, Both

YESTERDAY afternoon two fellows walked to
gether out of the Daily Shack. This afternoon
one will walk back in to be welcomed as editor
of Volume 100.
For the other, and so tradition goes, it means
only the memory of three years' worth of a bit
of work, of a lot of experience that nothing else
could bring, and of a heaping load of a darned
good time.
Tradition is that way, and tradition will be
served. Daily associate editors have always
taken that evening before away from the Shack,
come back the day of elections to find that one
was in and the other was not. And under the
competitive system under which we operate,
Daily associate editors will always do the same.
For the winner, tomorrow's election means
the editorship during a volume that very prob
ably will find Stanford a vastly different school
in undergraduate spirit and undergraduate think
ing. It will mean a tough grind, but a grind that
either of the two men who walked out of the
Shack yesterday can master with distinction.
For the loser it will mean continuance with
The Daily in the role of one of the master-help
ers, one of the major ribs in the backbone of
the publication.
For both, win or lose, it will mean the culmi
nation of three years of work toward the Daily
top spot, with all the help of many hours and
much talent behind them.
And for both, for each is that sort of guy, it's
the high spot in a Stanford life that's been tops
—that couldn't have been better.
