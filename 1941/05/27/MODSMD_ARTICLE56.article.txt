THERE'S a bit of roadway, just outside the
window in the Daily Shack and running both
ways to the Chem building and to the P. 0.,
that's about to be finished after several months
of dust, grime and inconvenience.
And, when it's all finished, the roadway will
mark the completion of the first step in an
apparent administration policy to bring campus
roads up to a par with the highways in the
great world "outside."
Stanfordites, who learned their lesson in the
underpass delays, and who have been hoping
that the street would be opened in time for use
before the end of school, received a positive
answer from Gordy Davis yesterday.
"It will be ready next week," he said, "if cars
will keep off the roadway until the primary sur
facing job is through."
If cars veer off Lomita, the job will be over
next week. But it only takes a couple of care
less drivers to add a couple of hundred dollars
to the bill and a couple more weeks to comple
tion date.
Sounds like a bargain.
