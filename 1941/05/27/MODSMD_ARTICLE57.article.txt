# Double Bargain
## 
### 
WITHIN a week and a half the Farm can
start collecting.
For almost two years in one case and for one
quarter in another Stanford people have in
vested a lot of patience and discomfort in the
Hoover Library and the Santa Teresa-Lomita
constructions; by the end of next week students
will be visiting one and driving on the other.
And their annoyance will be written down as
installments on two of the best bargains in Stan
ford history.
Although the now-famous Hoover Library is
not yet ready to be opened to the public, Dr.
Lutz has promised seniors and graduate stu
dents who want to see the offices and the bells
and the exhibits that they may inspect the li
brary from 2 until 4 p.m. Thursday. They can
prowl, question, satisfy the curiosity that has
been growing since the first girders went up in
1939; and a majority of that satisfaction will be
the returns on suffering—with moderate grace
—the nuisance that the library has been to the
campus.
More complaints, however, have been lodged
with Mr. McDonald concerning shoes, shin
bones, and springs ruined since March on Lo
mita and Santa Teresa than were ever heard by
the contractors on the libe. Campus opinions
to The Daily complained of the barricades, the
ingenious maze of detours, and the pitfalls—
which were many.

Now, with the students warned against the
fascinations of driving a car up newly "tacked"
roads, the administration has upped the price of
having, soon, a smooth, paved, curbstoned, 60-
foot-wide drive from the chemistry building,
roughly ,to the post office.
They have put their new restrictions rather
in the form of a sporting proposition and ap
parently have faith in the fact that the Farm will
guard its patience investment with a little more
patience still.
They figure that the final results will be, like
the Hoover Library, worth it. The campus is
beginning to feel the same way.—J. C. G.
