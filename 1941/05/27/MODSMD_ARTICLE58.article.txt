### JERRY MAYER ON RESTRICTIONS 
seniors, looking back over their college
k careers, cannot help but realize that this is not the
same Stanford that they entered in the fall of 1937.
The change has not been wrought by physical addi
tions to the University plant, such as the Education
Building or the Hoover Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace.
But rather the change has been physical, in the na
ture of the University's official and active attitude.
It is not for me to say whether this is right or wrong,
but I would like to point out some things that the
Stanfordite who has been here for the entire four
years cannot help but notice.

instance, as a member of Men's Council I was
called upon last Autumn Quarter to penalize
some thirty freshmen who had disobeyed strict orders
of the A.S.S.U. and Administration to refrain from
any activity connected with California's Big C in the
Berkeley hills. I cannot vouch for the feelings of my
fellow-members, but as a former member of the pro
cession of my frosh class that invaded Berkeley to
paint the "C," I felt a strong reluctance toward pen
alizing the confessed offenders. I imagine my fellow
members felt the way I did.
But the freshmen had been adequately warned. Stu
dent body presidents of the two universities had signed
pacts outlawing any violence. The pact had been pub
licized in The Daily. Men's Council's hands were tied.
Reluctant though we might be, we had no alterna
tive but to mete out punishment. Perhaps future Men's
Councils, inculcated with a more docile policy than
we, might feel no compunction in penalizing such
offenders.

is the point. When the student body of the
future is educated to the new beliefs of the Uni
versity, there will be no trouble. All the students will
be evenly-trained to the policy of the University. There
can be nothing but confusion while half the students
come from the era of individual independence and the
other half are products of the University's more rigid
control over student conduct.
I have no particular argument with the University
if it chooses to believe that its students should be
stringently regulated. There certainly must be a rea
son why all alcoholic drinks are banned from dances,
no matter if they are held off-campus. If the Admin
istration chooses to label any student an alcoholic who
is caught with a trace of odor on his breath, it un
doutedly has its reasons. It probably believes that
this policy is calculated to produce a better graduate.

r pHIS may be true; time only can be the judge.
But from all I can see, the majority of the stu
dents consider this attention unwarranted. Being col
lege students, they believe that the time has arrived
for them to start making their own decisions of con
duct and morals. Making preparations for a future
when they will be their own guides, they cannot help
but bear a slight resentment at close control of their
actions. It is my opinion that the restrictions on alco
hol at dances, for instance, will not wipe out an evil
that fails to exist in any serious proportion at the mo
ment. Rather, the evil may be accentuated by the
students' resentment at what they consider a lack of
faith on the part of the Administration at their capacity
for intelligently running their own lives.
I do not mean to place undue significance on the
campus dance restrictions. It is only used as an ex
ample.
These are my opinions on the subject, for what
they arc worth. I do not condemn the University its
opinions, but I do think that more faith in the students
would create unbounded faith in the University.
