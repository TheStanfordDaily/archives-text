## KEEP IT DOWN TO A ROAR

r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
The Stanford University Information Bulletin
contains the following paragraph on Conduct of Stu
dents:
"In the government of the University the largest
liberty consistent with good work and orderly conduct
is allowed. Students are expected to show both with
in and without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the rights of others as
good citizenship demands. Failure to do so will be
sufficient cause for removal from the University."
After having been a resident of Branner Hall since
September, 1940, the writer can point to the flagrant
violation of the above rules and regulations in their
entirety.
During the past two weeks there has been such a
disregard for others at Branner Hall that rumors of
"intended beatings" for such further conduct are be
ginning to circulate. I might add that these statements
have been made by men who can carry out their
threats with force.
When fellows who ordinarily do not complain about
a little noise begin to speak about violence, then some
thing is very much wrong. As a matter of fact Bran
ner has been a "haven for imitators of fighting cats,
etc." for some time.
Quite a number of Branner Hall men must work in
order to defray their college expenses, and when they
come home tired at night from hashing they would
like to get a little rest, but that is impossible when
some of these so-called "Stanford gentlemen" come in
at 2 and 3 in the morning and proceed to wake every
one up.
Other fellows at the Hall go out on week-end nights
and do not come in until early in the morning, but
they do not "announce" their arrival. They have out
grown that high school age stuff.
This may sound like the letter of a crank; perhaps
it is, but it can be proved that many of the Branner
men are fed up with this infernal night cat howling.
When young men ask about going to Stanford Uni
versity, and where they should live, no one can rec
ommend Branner Hall, or any other place nearby,
without feeling guilty.
Extreme liberality in the conduct of men students
at the Halls is having a deleterious effect, at Branner
at least.
If the University fails to take action this writer
strongly recommends the organization of a group of
vigilantes for next year. That will bring results.

dents:
"In the government of the University the largest
liberty consistent with good work and orderly conduct
is allowed. Students are expected to show both with
in and without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the rights of others as
good citizenship demands. Failure to do so will be
sufficient cause for removal from the University."
After having been a resident of Branner Hall since
September, 1940, the writer can point to the flagrant
violation of the above rules and regulations in their
entirety.
During the past two weeks there has been such a
disregard for others at Branner Hall that rumors of
"intended beatings" for such further conduct are be
ginning to circulate. I might add that these statements
have been made by men who can carry out their
threats with force.
When fellows who ordinarily do not complain about
a little noise begin to speak about violence, then some
thing is very much wrong. As a matter of fact Bran
ner has been a "haven for imitators of fighting cats,
etc." for some time.
Quite a number of Branner Hall men must work in
order to defray their college expenses, and when they
come home tired at night from hashing they would
like to get a little rest, but that is impossible when
some of these so-called "Stanford gentlemen" come in
at 2 and 3 in the morning and proceed to wake every
one up.
Other fellows at the Hall go out on week-end nights
and do not come in until early in the morning, but
they do not "announce" their arrival. They have out
grown that high school age stuff.
This may sound like the letter of a crank; perhaps
it is, but it can be proved that many of the Branner
men are fed up with this infernal night cat howling.
When young men ask about going to Stanford Uni
versity, and where they should live, no one can rec
ommend Branner Hall, or any other place nearby,
without feeling guilty.
Extreme liberality in the conduct of men students
at the Halls is having a deleterious effect, at Branner
at least.
If the University fails to take action this writer
strongly recommends the organization of a group of
vigilantes for next year. That will bring results.
