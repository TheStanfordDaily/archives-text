# Turner Plans Self-denial Day
## 
### 
Bill Turner, recently returned
from conferences in Washington,
D.C., announced last night that the
people who have consented to help
him in the Self-Denial Day program
will meet today at 3:45 p.m. in the
basement of the Women's Club
house.
Each living group will be re
quested to donate $10. If all the
groups contribute this standard,
there will be enough money to buy
a mobile kitchen for hunger-ridden
countries, Turner stated.
Those working with Turner are:
Muriel Boggs, Jeanette Armen
trout, Bob Dodge, By Carlson.
Dwight Hutchinson, Hugh O'Don
nell, Bob Low. Mickey Levee, Red
Fay, Norman Ross and John Wilson.
