# Paly Players' 'Blossom Time' Scores a Hit
## 
### 
'"Blossom Time," playing Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday at the
Palo Alto Community Theater. Gen
eral admission 55c.
The romantic life of Franz Schu
bert is shrouded in mystery, and
there have been numerous stories
written about what may have hap
pened. Around three of Schubert's
most famous songs — Ave Maria,
Serenade, and the theme of the
Unfinished Symphony — Sigmund
Romberg and Dorothy Donnelly have
woven another story about the com
poser.
The Palo Alto Light Opera's pro
duction of the operetta is a well
integrated presentation, full of color,
and excellenlty performed. The
chorus, under the direction of El
wyn Bugge was one of the best
heard there in a long time and was
a great factor in the success of the
production.
Under the direction of Ralph
Welles, the principals included a
number of new personalities who
were particularly outstanding.
Heading the list was Gordon Owen
as Baron Schober. His easy man
ner and full baritone made him an
ideal lover of the beautiful Mitzi
Kranz. Phyllis Rathbun in the roll
of Mitzi has an unusual husky
quality to her soprano, a pleasing
quality.
Winifred Elliott as La Bellabruna,
the opera star, was a beautiful and
charming coquette. But the most
outstanding member of the cast was
Keith Allan as Schubert. His make
up was excellent and the square
rimmed glasses added the proper
touch to the characterization. Al
lan, heard on the campus as the
marriage broker in the Bartered
Bride, has a beautifully modulated
voice, and most important of all, is
an excellent actor.
The sets were colorful and well
executed by Carrol Alexander and
were beautifully set off by the rich
costumes of Chyrsella Kiler.
If you like Schubert, good per
formances, and a lot of color, this
should head your "must-see" list.
