# Injured Frosh 'Out of Danger'
## 
### 
Richard Diebenkorn, contrary to
campus rumor, is in no danger as a
result of his fall from the fourth
floor of Encina a week ago and will
be released from the Palo Alto hos
pital shortly, probably within the
next couple of days, according to Dr.
O. N. Anderson, the physician in
charge.
"A fall from that height naturally
makes it imperative to keep the boy
under observation for possible com
plications," stated Dr. Anderson yes
terday. ''There have been no com
plications, however, and we feel that
Diebenkorn is definitely out of dan
ger."
Dr. Anderson said that the full
extent of the boy's injuries had been
determined and that they consisted
of a fractured nose, a chipped tooth,
bruises and skin abrasions, and shock
as a result of the fall.
Diebenkorn is a Deke pledge, and
is registered from San Francisco.
