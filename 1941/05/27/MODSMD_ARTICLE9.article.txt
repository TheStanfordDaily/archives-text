# Roosevelt Sets Second Draft Date as July 1
## To Affect Men 21 Since First Draft 
### 
A second registration under the
Selective Service AcJ, for July 1
was orcerea yesterday by President
Roosevelt.
This affects all men who have be
come 21 since the first draft regis
tration Oct. 16, 1940. The President
said in a proclamation another
registration was "required in the in
terest of national defense."
The men will register in the Unit
ed States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and
Alaska. Every male citizen and ev
ery male alien residing in these
areas, other than those specifically
exempted by the Selective Service
Act, must comply with the registra
tion order if he has reached his 21st
birthday since the initial registra
tion.
About 1,000,000 men will be re
quired to register under the proc
lamation, as estimated by selective
service officials.
As in the first registration, the
President arranged by proclamation
for the handling of special cases.
These cover inability of an indi
vidual to register because of "cir
cumstances beyond his control" or
because he is not in the United
States, Puerto Rico, or the two ter
ritories.
According to present tentative
plans, the new registrants in each
of the local draft areas will be added
to the bottom of the present list of
men available for service. There
were 16,500,000 registered last Oc
tobei*, 1074 from Stanford.
