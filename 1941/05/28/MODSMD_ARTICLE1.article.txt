### Jean Nowell 
last night when the Hood
went down oil the coast of
Greenland, Britannia has been in
imminent danger of losing, for a
time, her rule of the waves—tradi
tional since Drake beat up on the
Spanish Armada, and an established
fact for over 100 years.
When Winston Churchill an
nounced that the "Senior Sei'vice"
has caught and sunk the Bismarck,
the House of Commons nearly went
mad with joy—and so did the whole
British Empire.
And small wonder.
In spite of what this column
said day before yesterday about
over-emphasis on expensive bat
tleships in both Britain and the
United States, the fact that the
Royal Navy Rot the Bismarck will
mean more to the people of Eng
land than decisive victory in
Crete.
Englishmen still sing "Rule Bri
tannia," and they mean it. Values
in a nation's thinking don't change
over night. The life of the Empire
is the sea. Ergo, the navy is Brit
ain's life.

uUT oddly enough History's an
ger against capital ship emphasis is
still valid. It was a plane—an Amer
ican plane—that spotted the Bis
marck limping back to a French
port. It was naval torpedo planes
from the Ark Royal which launched
the "fish" that reduced her speed
and damaged her steering geer. Then,
while she was wallowing helplessly,
the Prince of Wales raced up and
f'ired several broadsides into the
German ship. But torpedo planes
again get the credit for the hit that
sank the Bismarck.

Now the Germans have only 3
battleships —• two of these of only
2(),000 tons—against Britain's 15.
The ratio of British superiority is
now 5 to 1 against the odds of 4 to 1
which prevailed before the Bismarck
went down.

And yet, with a navy like that,
the danger to Britain's supply lines
is very real. And the answer lies in
Iwo factors. Lack of destroyers for
convoy work, and lack of planes for
convoy work. It is German planes
and German "minnows," tiny sui
cide subs, which are wreaking the
havoc on British merchantmen.

£NCIDENTALLY the fact that
planes from the Ark Royal were
responsible for the sinking of the
Bismarck calls up an interesting
note. Since the war began the giant
Ark Royal has been "sunk" in Ger
man communiques at least eight or
ten times. All of which brings us
to the problem of whose commu
niques to believe in this man's v/ar.

Night after night the reports from
the reliable correspondents in Ger
many, London, Cairo, Istanbul, Zu
rich, Beirut, Vichy, Paris, and
Moscow, Washington et al come in
over the wires. And they show a
strong tendency to contradict each
other.
But here are a few tips on how
to analyze the news that comes
from Berlin, which is the most in
teresting. Of course, all reports
are censored, but the newsmen are
still permitted to quote their
sources.
If the report cites a German High
Command communique as its au
thority, you can believe pretty much
what's said. The German General
Staff is and has been for some time,
head of the best army in Europe.
The generals are not Hitler's thugs
—they are aristocrats with a tra
dition dating back to Bismarck.
When a German drive is going on,
wait for the High Command commu
nique. If it doesn't appear, things
aren't going too well—foreign office
spokesmen and ministries of propa
ganda to the contrary. The naval
and air reports must be taken with
a grain of salt since they are di
rectly connected with Hitler's prop
aganda machine.
