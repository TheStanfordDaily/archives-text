WASHINGTON, May 27 (UP). â€”Following is the text of President
Roosevelt's proclamation of an unlimited national emergency:

Proclaiming that an unlimited national emergency con
fronts this country, which requires that its military, naval, air
and civilian defenses be put on the basis of readiness to repel
any and all acts or threats of aggression directed toward any
part of the Western Hemisphere.
By the President of the United States of America, a procla
mation :
Whereas on September 8, 1939, because of the outbreak of
war in Europe a proclamation was issued declaring a limited
national emergency and directing measures "for the purpose
of strengthening our national defenses within the limits of
peace-time authorizations";

Whereas a succession of events makes plain that the ob
jectives of the Axis belligerents in such war are not confined
to those avowed at its commencement, but include overthrow
throughout the world of existing democratic order, and a
worldwide domination of peoples and economies through the
destruction of all resistance on land and sea and in the air, and

Whereas indifference on the part of the United States to
the increasing menace would be perilous, and common pru
dence requires that for the security of this nation and of this
hemisphere we should pass from peacetime authorizations of
military strength to such a basis as will enable us to cope
instantly and decisively with any attempt at hostile encircle
ment of this hemisphere, or the establishment of any base for
aggression against it, as well as to repel the threat of preda
tory incursion by foreign agents into our territory and society.

Now, therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the
United States of America, do proclaim that an unlimited na
tional emergency confronts this country, which requires that
its military, naval, air and civilian defenses be put on the basis
of readiness to repel any and all acts or threats of aggression
directed toward any part of the Western Hemisphere.
I call upon all the loyal citizens engaged in production for
defense to give precedence to the needs of the nation to the
end that a system of government that makes private enter
prise possible may survive.

I call upon all our loyal workmen as well as employers to
merge their lesser differences in the larger effort to insure
the survival of the only kind of government which recognizes
the rights of labor or of capital.

I call upon loyal state and local leaders and officials to co
operate with the civilian defense agencies of the United States
to assure our internal security against foreign directed sub
version and to put every community in order for maximum
productive effort and minimum of waste and unnecessary
frictions.
I call upon all loyal citizens to place the nation's needs first
in mind and in action to the end that we may mobilize and
have ready for instant defensive use all of the physical
powers, all of the moral strength and all of the material
resources of this nation.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this twenty-seventh day

of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty
one, and of the independence of the United States of America
the one hundred and sixty-fifth.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
