## Speech Outlines Stricter Policy Toward Labor 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 27 (UP).—
President Roosevelt tonight pro
claimed an unlimited national em
ergency and pledged full use of
United States armed might, if nec
essary, to crush Ilitlerism.

He announced the proclamation -
placing the nation on a war footing
—during a 45-minute fireside chat
which was broadcast nationally and
throughout the world.

Diplomats of the other 20 Amer
ican republics, Vice-President and
Mrs. Roosevelt, Cabinet officers and
other dignitaries were gathered

WASHINGTON, May 27 (UP).
—Capital reaction to President
Roosevelt's fireside chat tonight
ranged from high praise by Ad
ministration supporters to a charge
by Rep. Melvin J. Maas, Rr., Minn.,
that "this means war."

about him in the historic east room
of the White House as he made his
momentous declaration.

Bluntly reasserting the "freedom
of the seas" policy which this
country abandoned temporarily
under (he Neutrality Act, the
President stated emphatically that
all-out aid will be delivered safely
to Great Britain and other na
tions fighting on the side of de
mocracy.
Deliyrry of this aid, he aaid, "can
be done, it must be done; it will be
done."

He left unanswered (he question
whether convoys would be used to
safeguard war cargoes. He pointed
out, however, that the extended op
erations of the neutrality patrol in
the Atlantic are helping to insure
safe transit of munitions.

Military and naval technicians, he
asserted, are working out new and
additional safeguards which will be
put into effect as needed.
NATION S POLICY
Clearly and unmistakably he stat
ed this country's national policy to
be:

"First, we shall actively resist
whenever necessary, and with all
our resources, every attempt by Hit -
lcr to extend his Nazi domination to
the Western Hemisphere, or to
threaten it. We shall resist his ev
ery attempt to gain control of the
seas. We insist upon the vital im
portance of keeping Hitlerism away
from any point in the world which
could be used and would be used as
a base of attack upon the Americas.
DELIVER GOODS

"Second, from the point of view
of strict naval and military neces
sity, we shall give every possible
assistance to Britain, and to all who,
with Britain, are resisting Hitlerism
or its equivalent with force of arms,
i Our patrols are helping now to in
; sure delivery of the needed supplies
to Britain. All additional measures
necessary to deliver the goods will
be taken. Any and all. further meth
ods or combination of methods,
which can or shall be utilized, are
being devised by our military and
J naval technicians, who, with me, will
[ work out and put into effect such
new and additional safeguards as
may be needed."
The President did not give even a
hint that a national emergency
would be proclaimed until near the
end of his remarks.
It was one of the most drastic
short-of-war steps which he could
take and it was disclosed imme
diately after he had warned that
work stoppages would not be per
mitted to hamper the defense ef
fort.
PERILOUS INDIFFERENCE'
The proclamation stated that in
difference on the part of the United
States to the increasing menace of
Axis conquest would be perilous.
Common prudence, it asserted, re
quires that "for the security of this
nation and of this hemisphere we
should pass from peacetime authori
zations of military strength to such
a basis as will enable us to cope
instantly and decisively with any
attempt at hostile encirclement of
this hemisphere, of the establish
ment of any bases for aggression
against us, as well as to repel the
threat of predatory incursion by for
eign agents into our territory and
society."

The President called upon work
ers and employers to subordinate
their differences for the national
good and upon all citizens to place
patriotism ahead of personal privi
lege.

The proclamation has Ihe effect of
automatically ending the "business
as usual" policy and for the dura
tion of the emergency to submerge
all personal aims and ambitions to
the requirements of defense.
Mr. Roosevelt began his fireside
chat by denouncing "wishful think
ers or' sentimentalists" who would
have the United States make peace
with Hitler. He said "we face a
cold hard,fact" in the current world

crisis and he painted a dire picture
of this hemisphere and the world if
the Axis is triumphant.
"We do not accept, and will not
permit, this Nazi 'shape of things
to come'," he said defiantly.
POINTS OF ADDRESS
The address embraced these far
reaching declarations:
The supply of tools (for the dem
ocracies) will not fail—it will in
crease.
This country will not hesitate to
use its armed forces to repel attack.
The pledge of full material aid to
other democracies will be main
tained.
This government is determined to
use all of its power to express the
will of its people, and to prevent
interference with the production of
materials essential to our nation's
safety.
This is no time for capital to make,
or be allowed to retain, excess
profits.
Articles of defense must have un
disputed right-of-way in every in
dustrial plant in the country.
MORE BARGAINING
Collective bargaining will be
maintained, but the American peo
ple expect that impartial recom
mendations of our government serv
ices will be followed by both capital
and labor.
Nation-wide machinery for con
ciliation and mediation of industrial
disputes must be used promptly and
without stoppage of work (on de
fense orders.)
The United States will not accept
a Hitler-dominated world.
The Americas will decide for our
selves whether, and when, and
where, our American interests are
attacked or our security threatened.
The people and the government
will not hesitate to meet any chal
lenge to American liberties.
It would be suicide to wait until

they (Nazis) are in our front yard.
The war is coming close to home.
Danger to the Americas has re
cently been heavily underlined by
the presence in Western Hemisphere
waters of Nazi battleships of great
striking power.
CLOSE TO HOME'
This nation must not be defeated
by the fear of the very danger which
we are preparing to resist.
A triumphant Germany, the
President said, would impose an
"economic stranglehold upon our
several nations." He said the Nazis
plan to strangle the Latin-Ameri
can nations first, then direct their
attack upon the United States and
Canada,

that "this means war."

about him in the historic east room
of the White House as he made his
momentous declaration.

Bluntly reasserting the "freedom
of the seas" policy which this
country abandoned temporarily
under (he Neutrality Act, the
President stated emphatically that
all-out aid will be delivered safely
to Great Britain and other na
tions fighting on the side of de
mocracy.
Deliyrry of this aid, he aaid, "can
be done, it must be done; it will be
done."

He left unanswered (he question

safeguard war cargoes. He pointed
out, however, that the extended op
erations of the neutrality patrol in
the Atlantic are helping to insure
safe transit of munitions.

Military and naval technicians, he
asserted, are working out new and
additional safeguards which will be
put into effect as needed.
NATION S POLICY
Clearly and unmistakably he stat
ed this country's national policy to
be:

"First, we shall actively resist
whenever necessary, and with all
our resources, every attempt by Hit -
lcr to extend his Nazi domination to
the Western Hemisphere, or to
threaten it. We shall resist his ev
ery attempt to gain control of the
seas. We insist upon the vital im
portance of keeping Hitlerism away
from any point in the world which
could be used and would be used as
a base of attack upon the Americas.
DELIVER GOODS

"Second, from the point of view
of strict naval and military neces
sity, we shall give every possible
assistance to Britain, and to all who,
with Britain, are resisting Hitlerism
or its equivalent with force of arms,
i Our patrols are helping now to in
; sure delivery of the needed supplies
to Britain. All additional measures
necessary to deliver the goods will
be taken. Any and all. further meth
ods or combination of methods,
which can or shall be utilized, are
being devised by our military and
J naval technicians, who, with me, will
[ work out and put into effect such
new and additional safeguards as
may be needed."
The President did not give even a
hint that a national emergency
would be proclaimed until near the
end of his remarks.
It was one of the most drastic
short-of-war steps which he could
take and it was disclosed imme
diately after he had warned that
work stoppages would not be per
mitted to hamper the defense ef
fort.
PERILOUS INDIFFERENCE'
The proclamation stated that in
difference on the part of the United
States to the increasing menace of
Axis conquest would be perilous.
Common prudence, it asserted, re
quires that "for the security of this
nation and of this hemisphere we
should pass from peacetime authori
zations of military strength to such
a basis as will enable us to cope
instantly and decisively with any
attempt at hostile encirclement of
this hemisphere, of the establish
ment of any bases for aggression
against us, as well as to repel the
threat of predatory incursion by for
eign agents into our territory and
society."

The President called upon work
ers and employers to subordinate
their differences for the national
good and upon all citizens to place
patriotism ahead of personal privi
lege.

The proclamation has Ihe effect of
automatically ending the "business
as usual" policy and for the dura
tion of the emergency to submerge
all personal aims and ambitions to
the requirements of defense.
Mr. Roosevelt began his fireside
chat by denouncing "wishful think
ers or' sentimentalists" who would
have the United States make peace
with Hitler. He said "we face a
cold hard,fact" in the current world

crisis and he painted a dire picture
of this hemisphere and the world if
the Axis is triumphant.
"We do not accept, and will not
permit, this Nazi 'shape of things
to come'," he said defiantly.
POINTS OF ADDRESS

will of its people, and to prevent
interference with the production of
materials essential to our nation's
safety.
This is no time for capital to make,
or be allowed to retain, excess
profits.
Articles of defense must have un

other democracies will be main
tained.
This government is determined to

will of its people, and to prevent
interference with the production of
materials essential to our nation's
safety.
This is no time for capital to make,
or be allowed to retain, excess
profits.
Articles of defense must have un
disputed right-of-way in every in
dustrial plant in the country.
MORE BARGAINING

ices will be followed by both capital
and labor.
Nation-wide machinery for con
ciliation and mediation of industrial
disputes must be used promptly and
without stoppage of work (on de
fense orders.)

a Hitler-dominated world.
The Americas will decide for our
selves whether, and when, and
where, our American interests are
attacked or our security threatened.

It would be suicide to wait until

they (Nazis) are in our front yard.
The war is coming close to home.
Danger to the Americas has re
cently been heavily underlined by
the presence in Western Hemisphere
waters of Nazi battleships of great
striking power.
CLOSE TO HOME'
This nation must not be defeated
by the fear of the very danger which
we are preparing to resist.
A triumphant Germany, the
President said, would impose an
"economic stranglehold upon our
several nations." He said the Nazis

of the White House as he made his
momentous declaration.

Bluntly reasserting the "freedom
of the seas" policy which this
country abandoned temporarily
under (he Neutrality Act, the
President stated emphatically that
all-out aid will be delivered safely
to Great Britain and other na
tions fighting on the side of de
mocracy.
Deliyrry of this aid, he aaid, "can
be done, it must be done; it will be

He left unanswered (he question

out, however, that the extended op
erations of the neutrality patrol in
the Atlantic are helping to insure
safe transit of munitions.

Military and naval technicians, he
asserted, are working out new and
additional safeguards which will be
put into effect as needed.
NATION S POLICY
Clearly and unmistakably he stat
ed this country's national policy to
be:

"First, we shall actively resist
whenever necessary, and with all
our resources, every attempt by Hit -
lcr to extend his Nazi domination to
the Western Hemisphere, or to
threaten it. We shall resist his ev
ery attempt to gain control of the
seas. We insist upon the vital im
portance of keeping Hitlerism away
from any point in the world which
could be used and would be used as
a base of attack upon the Americas.
DELIVER GOODS

"Second, from the point of view
of strict naval and military neces
sity, we shall give every possible
assistance to Britain, and to all who,
with Britain, are resisting Hitlerism
or its equivalent with force of arms,
i Our patrols are helping now to in
; sure delivery of the needed supplies
to Britain. All additional measures
necessary to deliver the goods will
be taken. Any and all. further meth
ods or combination of methods,
which can or shall be utilized, are
being devised by our military and
J naval technicians, who, with me, will
[ work out and put into effect such
new and additional safeguards as
may be needed."
The President did not give even a
hint that a national emergency
would be proclaimed until near the
end of his remarks.
It was one of the most drastic
short-of-war steps which he could
take and it was disclosed imme
diately after he had warned that
work stoppages would not be per
mitted to hamper the defense ef
fort.
PERILOUS INDIFFERENCE'
The proclamation stated that in
difference on the part of the United
States to the increasing menace of
Axis conquest would be perilous.
Common prudence, it asserted, re
quires that "for the security of this
nation and of this hemisphere we
should pass from peacetime authori
zations of military strength to such
a basis as will enable us to cope
instantly and decisively with any
attempt at hostile encirclement of
this hemisphere, of the establish
ment of any bases for aggression
against us, as well as to repel the
threat of predatory incursion by for
eign agents into our territory and
society."

The President called upon work
ers and employers to subordinate
their differences for the national
good and upon all citizens to place
patriotism ahead of personal privi
lege.

The proclamation has Ihe effect of
automatically ending the "business
as usual" policy and for the dura
tion of the emergency to submerge
all personal aims and ambitions to
the requirements of defense.

The people and the government
will not hesitate to meet any chal

It would be suicide to wait until

they (Nazis) are in our front yard.
The war is coming close to home.
Danger to the Americas has re

the presence in Western Hemisphere
waters of Nazi battleships of great
striking power.
CLOSE TO HOME'
This nation must not be defeated
by the fear of the very danger which
we are preparing to resist.
A triumphant Germany, the
President said, would impose an
"economic stranglehold upon our
several nations." He said the Nazis

of the White House as he made his
momentous declaration.

Bluntly reasserting the "freedom
of the seas" policy which this
country abandoned temporarily
under (he Neutrality Act, the
President stated emphatically that
all-out aid will be delivered safely
to Great Britain and other na
tions fighting on the side of de
mocracy.
Deliyrry of this aid, he aaid, "can
be done, it must be done; it will be
done."

He left unanswered (he question
whether convoys would be used to
safeguard war cargoes. He pointed
out, however, that the extended op
erations of the neutrality patrol in
the Atlantic are helping to insure
safe transit of munitions.

Military and naval technicians, he
asserted, are working out new and
additional safeguards which will be
put into effect as needed.
NATION S POLICY
Clearly and unmistakably he stat
ed this country's national policy to
be:

"First, we shall actively resist
whenever necessary, and with all
our resources, every attempt by Hit -
lcr to extend his Nazi domination to
the Western Hemisphere, or to
threaten it. We shall resist his ev
ery attempt to gain control of the
seas. We insist upon the vital im
portance of keeping Hitlerism away
from any point in the world which
could be used and would be used as
a base of attack upon the Americas.
DELIVER GOODS

"Second, from the point of view
of strict naval and military neces
sity, we shall give every possible
assistance to Britain, and to all who,
with Britain, are resisting Hitlerism
or its equivalent with force of arms,
i Our patrols are helping now to in
; sure delivery of the needed supplies
to Britain. All additional measures
necessary to deliver the goods will
be taken. Any and all. further meth
ods or combination of methods,
which can or shall be utilized, are
being devised by our military and
J naval technicians, who, with me, will
[ work out and put into effect such
new and additional safeguards as
may be needed."
The President did not give even a
hint that a national emergency
would be proclaimed until near the
end of his remarks.
It was one of the most drastic
short-of-war steps which he could
take and it was disclosed imme
diately after he had warned that
work stoppages would not be per
mitted to hamper the defense ef
fort.
