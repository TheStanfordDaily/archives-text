Chairman Norman Ross outlined
plans for the extensive program and
the duties of the various commit

The incoming freshmen are to be

to meet other members of his class.
Next year the freshmen will have
the opportunity of taking the voca

will then be out of the way by the
time school starts.
There will be Honor Code discus

will be introduced to how the code
works at Stanford. Dean Bunn and
Dean Yost will address meetings in
Encina and Roble.
The Pre-Reg Committee will re
turn to school on September 18, in
order that all events will be ready
to start as soon as the freshmen be
gin to arrive Friday morning for the
three-day "get - acquainted pro
gram."
