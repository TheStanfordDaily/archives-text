### CHUCK SMITH 
THE first time in many years
a Stanford track team faces the
possibility of finishing outside of the
win place, and show positions in the
Pacific Coast Conference meet which
will be held this coming Saturday
on Edwards Field in Berkeley.

In the past the Cards have al
ways been battling it out with
U.S.C. or California, usually the
former, for the coast champion
ship and if they didn't win they
were often runnerups and seldom
down as far as third place.

But this year three teams, the
perenially powerful Trojans, Cali
fornia mainly because of the abil
ity of the members of its record
breaking two-mile relay team, and
Washington State, winners of the
Northern Division meet, will prob
ably finish ahead of Coach Pitch
Johnson's squad in the point totals.

r personal contact the
Indian tracksters have become
acquainted with the Klemmers,
Barnes, and Biles' of California and
with the Smiths', Peoples', and
Bourlands of Southern California.

But they know little or nothing
about the well rounded squad that
ex-Stanford man, Coach Jack
Weiershauser. will send down from
Washington State for the confer
ence meet.

The Cougar's captain, Bill Dale,
defending champion in the half mile
has run the 880 in 1:52.3, and his
team mate, Jim Lang, is usually
only a few yards behind with a
best mark of 1:52.9.

Pat Haley, WSC iron man, will
take over in the sprints and low
hurdles where Lee Orr, member of
last season's Cougar squad and coast
champ in the 440 yard dash and low
hurdles left off.

Pat has run the hundred in
9.7, the 220 in 21.2, and the low
hurdles in 23.6. He was the win
ner in each of these events in the
running of the Northern Division
of the Coast Conference meet.

Add to these Noel Williams, a 4:IG
miler and 9:40 two-miler; Frank
Londos, a 49 foot shot putter, Bill
Schade, who won the high hurdles
in the northern division meet; and
their relay team which is capable
of 3:10. Though they won't be win
ners, these tracksters will cut in
for valuable thirds and fourths to
boost the Cougar total.

WASHINGTON STATE has the
greatest team strength in the
Northwest but it has not got all the
individual stars. Other northerners
who are going to win points in the
conference meet next Saturday are
the world's greatest high jumper,
Les Steers, formerly of Palo Alto
and now competing for Oregon, and
Idaho's distance star, Phil Liebo
witz, who ran the half in 1:52.3 and
ihe mile in 4:12.2 on the same day
earlier in the year.
Then there are Kjell Qvale
(pronounced Shell Qual) of Wash
ington, who was only a whisker
behind Haley in the Northwest
Championships; Johnny Long, also
of Washington, who runs the
quarter mile in 48.5; Gene Claw
son of Montana, who has thrown
the discus 159 feet, and Vic Dyr
gall of Idaho who has done 9:28
in the two-mile.

Bay Area track fans ought to con
sider themselves very lucky for in
cluding this approaching Coast Con
ference meet they will have the op
portunity of seeing the two greatest
track meets in the country. The
other is, of course, the National Col
legiate Athletic Association's annual
classic which will be run off here
on the Farm June 20 and 21.

for valuable thirds and fourths to
boost the Cougar total.

WASHINGTON STATE has the
greatest team strength in the
Northwest but it has not got all the
individual stars. Other northerners
who are going to win points in the
conference meet next Saturday are
the world's greatest high jumper,
Les Steers, formerly of Palo Alto
and now competing for Oregon, and
Idaho's distance star, Phil Liebo
witz, who ran the half in 1:52.3 and
ihe mile in 4:12.2 on the same day
earlier in the year.
Then there are Kjell Qvale
(pronounced Shell Qual) of Wash
ington, who was only a whisker
behind Haley in the Northwest
Championships; Johnny Long, also
of Washington, who runs the
quarter mile in 48.5; Gene Claw
son of Montana, who has thrown
the discus 159 feet, and Vic Dyr
gall of Idaho who has done 9:28
in the two-mile.

Bay Area track fans ought to con
sider themselves very lucky for in
cluding this approaching Coast Con
ference meet they will have the op
portunity of seeing the two greatest
track meets in the country. The
other is, of course, the National Col
legiate Athletic Association's annual
classic which will be run off here
on the Farm June 20 and 21.
THE first time in many years
a Stanford track team faces the
possibility of finishing outside of the
win place, and show positions in the
Pacific Coast Conference meet which
will be held this coming Saturday
on Edwards Field in Berkeley.

In the past the Cards have al
ways been battling it out with
U.S.C. or California, usually the
former, for the coast champion
ship and if they didn't win they
were often runnerups and seldom
down as far as third place.

But this year three teams, the
perenially powerful Trojans, Cali
fornia mainly because of the abil
ity of the members of its record
breaking two-mile relay team, and
Washington State, winners of the
Northern Division meet, will prob
ably finish ahead of Coach Pitch
Johnson's squad in the point totals.

r personal contact the
Indian tracksters have become
acquainted with the Klemmers,
Barnes, and Biles' of California and
with the Smiths', Peoples', and
Bourlands of Southern California.

But they know little or nothing
about the well rounded squad that
ex-Stanford man, Coach Jack
Weiershauser. will send down from
Washington State for the confer
ence meet.

The Cougar's captain, Bill Dale,
defending champion in the half mile
has run the 880 in 1:52.3, and his
team mate, Jim Lang, is usually
only a few yards behind with a
best mark of 1:52.9.

Pat Haley, WSC iron man, will
take over in the sprints and low
hurdles where Lee Orr, member of
last season's Cougar squad and coast
champ in the 440 yard dash and low
hurdles left off.

Pat has run the hundred in
9.7, the 220 in 21.2, and the low
hurdles in 23.6. He was the win
ner in each of these events in the
running of the Northern Division
of the Coast Conference meet.

Add to these Noel Williams, a 4:IG
miler and 9:40 two-miler; Frank
Londos, a 49 foot shot putter, Bill
Schade, who won the high hurdles
in the northern division meet; and
their relay team which is capable
of 3:10. Though they won't be win
ners, these tracksters will cut in
for valuable thirds and fourths to
boost the Cougar total.

about the well rounded squad that
ex-Stanford man, Coach Jack
Weiershauser. will send down from
Washington State for the confer
ence meet.

The Cougar's captain, Bill Dale,
defending champion in the half mile
has run the 880 in 1:52.3, and his
team mate, Jim Lang, is usually
only a few yards behind with a
best mark of 1:52.9.

Pat Haley, WSC iron man, will
take over in the sprints and low
hurdles where Lee Orr, member of
last season's Cougar squad and coast
champ in the 440 yard dash and low
hurdles left off.

Pat has run the hundred in
9.7, the 220 in 21.2, and the low
hurdles in 23.6. He was the win
ner in each of these events in the
running of the Northern Division
of the Coast Conference meet.

Add to these Noel Williams, a 4:IG
miler and 9:40 two-miler; Frank
Londos, a 49 foot shot putter, Bill
Schade, who won the high hurdles
in the northern division meet; and
their relay team which is capable
of 3:10. Though they won't be win
ners, these tracksters will cut in
for valuable thirds and fourths to
boost the Cougar total.

WASHINGTON STATE has the
greatest team strength in the
Northwest but it has not got all the
individual stars. Other northerners
who are going to win points in the
conference meet next Saturday are
the world's greatest high jumper,
Les Steers, formerly of Palo Alto
and now competing for Oregon, and
Idaho's distance star, Phil Liebo
witz, who ran the half in 1:52.3 and
ihe mile in 4:12.2 on the same day
earlier in the year.
Then there are Kjell Qvale
(pronounced Shell Qual) of Wash
ington, who was only a whisker
behind Haley in the Northwest
Championships; Johnny Long, also
of Washington, who runs the
quarter mile in 48.5; Gene Claw
son of Montana, who has thrown
the discus 159 feet, and Vic Dyr
gall of Idaho who has done 9:28
in the two-mile.

Bay Area track fans ought to con
sider themselves very lucky for in
cluding this approaching Coast Con
ference meet they will have the op
portunity of seeing the two greatest
track meets in the country. The
other is, of course, the National Col
legiate Athletic Association's annual
classic which will be run off here
on the Farm June 20 and 21.
