# Senior Watermen Whip Sophomores
## 
### 
In the second game of the inter
class water polo series, the seniors
upset the sophomores, 5 to 4.

I>ie feat was even more re
markable since the seniors had only
six men, one short of a team of
seven, and played the whole game
against a team with one more man.

Bill Weedon paced the winners with
3 points.

The juniors play the freshmen
today in the championship contest.
