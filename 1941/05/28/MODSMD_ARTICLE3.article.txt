The professors whose comments appear below arc T. A. Bailey, pro
fessor of history; Merrill K. Bennett, economist, professor of economic
geography and executive secretary, Food Research Institute; Philip W.

Buck, associate professor of political <
science; Chilton R. Bush, head of the

partment.
Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, head of the
political science department, said to
The Daily last night:
The Monroe Doctrine and Free
dom of the Seas clothed in the guise
of an "unlimited national emer
gency" will not satisfy the needs of
"struggling democracies." Jean
Nowell called the tune yesterday
morning in stating that "the Presi
dent will say only what the nation
will take at this time."
"You stay out of my yard or I'll
punch you in the nose" are fighting
words for which we will need acts
to back up our pledge made in sol

wait."
"Extreme limits of our national
power" should have been reached
months ago.
More national aid than ever will

opportunity to outline national aims
in sustaining the life struggle of the
democracies.
Mr. Bailey: "The only new factor
of impui lance was the announce

phasis on long-range hemispheric
defense indicates that the President
is conditioning the American mind
for the pre-emptive seizure of out
posts like Dakar and the Azores.

"Most important of all, perhaps,
the President has vigorously reas
serted his leadership and quieted
rumors of a physical collapse."

Mr. Bennett: "The President's
speech was a forceful reaffirmation
of international policies already in
effect and familiar to the public, but
not a declaration of new policy nor
a retreat before the isolationist
forces recently so vocal. It was a
powerful, persuasive, and accurate
expose of the international situation,
aimed partly at undermining the iso
lationist position. Particularly ef
fective was the emphasis given to
the real, immediate bone of conten
