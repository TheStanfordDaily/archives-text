### 
Eitfht Stanford professors last night commented to The Daily on Presi
dent Roosevelt's speech to the nation.
The professors whose comments appear below arc T. A. Bailey, pro
fessor of history; Merrill K. Bennett, economist, professor of economic
geography and executive secretary, Food Research Institute; Philip W.

Buck, associate professor of political <
science; Chilton R. Bush, head of the
journalism department; Albert Gue
rard, professor of general literature;
Theodore J. Kreps, professor of bus
iness economics; Percy A. Martin,
professor of history; Edgar Eugene
Robinson, head of the history de
partment.
Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, head of the
political science department, said to
The Daily last night:
The Monroe Doctrine and Free
dom of the Seas clothed in the guise
of an "unlimited national emer
gency" will not satisfy the needs of
"struggling democracies." Jean
Nowell called the tune yesterday
morning in stating that "the Presi
dent will say only what the nation
will take at this time."
"You stay out of my yard or I'll
punch you in the nose" are fighting
words for which we will need acts
to back up our pledge made in sol
emn faith that it is "suicide to
wait."
"Extreme limits of our national
power" should have been reached
months ago.
More national aid than ever will
be needed after this disappointing
opportunity to outline national aims
in sustaining the life struggle of the
democracies.
Mr. Bailey: "The only new factor
of impui lance was the announce
ment of an unlimited national emer
gency. Strictly speaking, even this
is not new because it merely means
an all-out intensification of the
defense program to which we are
committed. But psychologically and
physically we have moved a step j
nearer war.

"The rest of the speech is signifi
cant for what it foreshadows. The
emphasis on delivery of goods to
Britain means that the convoy, if
necessary, will be used; the empha
sis on freedom of the seas suggests
that the neutrality act may be re
pealed so as to allow our merchant
men to enter danger zones; the em
phasis on long-range hemispheric
defense indicates that the President
is conditioning the American mind
for the pre-emptive seizure of out
posts like Dakar and the Azores.

"Most important of all, perhaps,
the President has vigorously reas
serted his leadership and quieted
rumors of a physical collapse."

Mr. Bennett: "The President's
speech was a forceful reaffirmation
of international policies already in
effect and familiar to the public, but
not a declaration of new policy nor
a retreat before the isolationist
forces recently so vocal. It was a
powerful, persuasive, and accurate
expose of the international situation,
aimed partly at undermining the iso
lationist position. Particularly ef
fective was the emphasis given to
the real, immediate bone of conten
tion in the war—the control of the
seas. It did not push us appreciably
further into a shooting war than
we were already, hut merely sug
gested rather strongly that we ought
not to be surprised if shooting
starts. It informed us that an un
limited national emergency was now
in effect, but did not tell us what is
to be done with it, especially with
regard to the vexing questions of
labor - capital relations and their
bearing on increase in national out
put of armaments. Detailed and
specific charting of the national
course that so many had hoped for
was not there."

Mr. Buck: "It seems to me that
he said about as much as he could
say under the circumstances. He
expressed a policy of aid to de
mocracies, but his argument was
from the point of view of national
defense ... an entirely logical po
sition. It was, as all of his speeches
are, clearly and simply expressed."

Mr. Bush: "The words are about
the same as Mr. Roosevelt has been
saying for several months. The dec
laration of a national emergency
probably means that the govern
ment intends to carry out some of
the promises and threats already
uttered. The President probably has
also begun to supply that leader
ship which many people have been
calling for."

Mr. Guerard: "The President has
linked in a masterly fashion the
present emergency with all our tra
ditions and with all our hopes.
Everyone knew that such an emer
gency existed, but many tried to
avert their faces. Now that the plain
facts have been so definitely pro
claimed, the task will be met by a
united people. The words of the
President are not a declaration of
war, but a plain statement of the
conditions of peace. Let freedom
be fully restored, and we shall gladly
law down our arms. But to the
active defense of freedom we are
now committed, one and all."

Mr. Krcps: "I think that it's ex
cellent except that it doesn't go far
enough. I am very much in favor
of declaring an unlimited national
emergency and vvould have liked a
direct statement concerning con
voys. I am not sure but what I
would have welcomed some state
ment about handing passports to
Axis ambassadors and asking them
to go home."
Mr. Martin: "I find myself in
full agreement with what Mr. Roo
sevelt said. At first I hoped he
might be a little more explicit and
state that he would use our navy
for convoy purposes and that he
might possibly mention the use of
the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands,
and Dakar. But after I had listened
to all of the President's speech I
felt that these proposals were im
plicit in his speech. I felt that it
was the best public address that
Mr. Roosevelt has made thus far."

Mr. Robinson: "Like Lincoln and
Wilson, he takes measures to in
sure national unity in anticipation
of further attack upon our vital in
terests. That is the true meaning of
the declaration of a national emer
gency. It will make for national
strength in that it will promote all
measures for national defense. By
so doing we take measure for war
in a world of war, but speaking for
a vast majority of our people Mr.
Roosevelt does not ask for war."

Mr. Bailey: "The only new factor
of impui lance was the announce
ment of an unlimited national emer
gency. Strictly speaking, even this
is not new because it merely means
an all-out intensification of the
defense program to which we are
committed. But psychologically and
physically we have moved a step j
nearer war.

"The rest of the speech is signifi

emphasis on delivery of goods to
Britain means that the convoy, if
necessary, will be used; the empha
sis on freedom of the seas suggests
that the neutrality act may be re
pealed so as to allow our merchant
men to enter danger zones; the em
phasis on long-range hemispheric
defense indicates that the President
is conditioning the American mind
for the pre-emptive seizure of out
posts like Dakar and the Azores.

"Most important of all, perhaps,
the President has vigorously reas
serted his leadership and quieted
rumors of a physical collapse."

Mr. Bennett: "The President's
speech was a forceful reaffirmation
of international policies already in
effect and familiar to the public, but
not a declaration of new policy nor
a retreat before the isolationist
forces recently so vocal. It was a
powerful, persuasive, and accurate
expose of the international situation,
aimed partly at undermining the iso
lationist position. Particularly ef
fective was the emphasis given to
the real, immediate bone of conten
tion in the war—the control of the
seas. It did not push us appreciably
further into a shooting war than
we were already, hut merely sug
gested rather strongly that we ought
not to be surprised if shooting
starts. It informed us that an un
limited national emergency was now
in effect, but did not tell us what is
to be done with it, especially with
regard to the vexing questions of
labor - capital relations and their
bearing on increase in national out
put of armaments. Detailed and
specific charting of the national
course that so many had hoped for
was not there."

Mr. Buck: "It seems to me that
he said about as much as he could
say under the circumstances. He
expressed a policy of aid to de
mocracies, but his argument was
from the point of view of national
defense ... an entirely logical po
sition. It was, as all of his speeches
are, clearly and simply expressed."

Mr. Bush: "The words are about
the same as Mr. Roosevelt has been
saying for several months. The dec
laration of a national emergency
probably means that the govern
ment intends to carry out some of
the promises and threats already
uttered. The President probably has
also begun to supply that leader
ship which many people have been
calling for."

Mr. Guerard: "The President has
linked in a masterly fashion the
present emergency with all our tra
ditions and with all our hopes.
Everyone knew that such an emer
gency existed, but many tried to
avert their faces. Now that the plain
facts have been so definitely pro
claimed, the task will be met by a
united people. The words of the
President are not a declaration of
war, but a plain statement of the
conditions of peace. Let freedom
be fully restored, and we shall gladly
law down our arms. But to the
active defense of freedom we are
now committed, one and all."

Mr. Krcps: "I think that it's ex
cellent except that it doesn't go far
enough. I am very much in favor
of declaring an unlimited national
emergency and vvould have liked a
direct statement concerning con
voys. I am not sure but what I
would have welcomed some state
ment about handing passports to
Axis ambassadors and asking them
to go home."
Mr. Martin: "I find myself in
full agreement with what Mr. Roo
sevelt said. At first I hoped he
might be a little more explicit and
state that he would use our navy
for convoy purposes and that he
might possibly mention the use of
the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands,
and Dakar. But after I had listened
to all of the President's speech I
felt that these proposals were im
plicit in his speech. I felt that it
was the best public address that
Mr. Roosevelt has made thus far."

Mr. Robinson: "Like Lincoln and
Wilson, he takes measures to in
sure national unity in anticipation
of further attack upon our vital in
terests. That is the true meaning of
the declaration of a national emer
gency. It will make for national
strength in that it will promote all
measures for national defense. By
so doing we take measure for war
in a world of war, but speaking for

for the pre-emptive seizure of out
posts like Dakar and the Azores.

"Most important of all, perhaps,
the President has vigorously reas
serted his leadership and quieted
rumors of a physical collapse."

Mr. Bennett: "The President's
speech was a forceful reaffirmation
of international policies already in
effect and familiar to the public, but
not a declaration of new policy nor
a retreat before the isolationist
forces recently so vocal. It was a
powerful, persuasive, and accurate
expose of the international situation,
aimed partly at undermining the iso
lationist position. Particularly ef
fective was the emphasis given to
the real, immediate bone of conten
tion in the war—the control of the
seas. It did not push us appreciably
further into a shooting war than
we were already, hut merely sug
gested rather strongly that we ought
not to be surprised if shooting
starts. It informed us that an un
limited national emergency was now
in effect, but did not tell us what is
to be done with it, especially with
regard to the vexing questions of
labor - capital relations and their
bearing on increase in national out
put of armaments. Detailed and
specific charting of the national
course that so many had hoped for
was not there."

Mr. Buck: "It seems to me that
he said about as much as he could
say under the circumstances. He
expressed a policy of aid to de
mocracies, but his argument was
from the point of view of national
defense ... an entirely logical po
sition. It was, as all of his speeches
are, clearly and simply expressed."

Mr. Bush: "The words are about
the same as Mr. Roosevelt has been
saying for several months. The dec
laration of a national emergency
probably means that the govern
ment intends to carry out some of
the promises and threats already
uttered. The President probably has
also begun to supply that leader
ship which many people have been
calling for."

Mr. Guerard: "The President has
linked in a masterly fashion the
present emergency with all our tra
ditions and with all our hopes.
Everyone knew that such an emer
gency existed, but many tried to
avert their faces. Now that the plain
facts have been so definitely pro
claimed, the task will be met by a
united people. The words of the
President are not a declaration of
war, but a plain statement of the
conditions of peace. Let freedom
be fully restored, and we shall gladly
law down our arms. But to the
active defense of freedom we are
now committed, one and all."

Mr. Krcps: "I think that it's ex
cellent except that it doesn't go far
enough. I am very much in favor
of declaring an unlimited national
emergency and vvould have liked a
direct statement concerning con
voys. I am not sure but what I
would have welcomed some state
ment about handing passports to
Axis ambassadors and asking them
to go home."
Mr. Martin: "I find myself in
full agreement with what Mr. Roo
sevelt said. At first I hoped he
might be a little more explicit and
state that he would use our navy
for convoy purposes and that he
might possibly mention the use of
the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands,
and Dakar. But after I had listened
to all of the President's speech I
felt that these proposals were im
plicit in his speech. I felt that it
was the best public address that
Mr. Roosevelt has made thus far."

Mr. Robinson: "Like Lincoln and
Wilson, he takes measures to in
sure national unity in anticipation
of further attack upon our vital in
terests. That is the true meaning of
the declaration of a national emer
gency. It will make for national
strength in that it will promote all
measures for national defense. By
so doing we take measure for war
in a world of war, but speaking for
a vast majority of our people Mr.
Roosevelt does not ask for war."

we were already, hut merely sug
gested rather strongly that we ought
not to be surprised if shooting
starts. It informed us that an un
limited national emergency was now
in effect, but did not tell us what is
to be done with it, especially with
regard to the vexing questions of
labor - capital relations and their
bearing on increase in national out
put of armaments. Detailed and
specific charting of the national
course that so many had hoped for
was not there."

Mr. Buck: "It seems to me that
he said about as much as he could
say under the circumstances. He
expressed a policy of aid to de
mocracies, but his argument was
from the point of view of national
defense ... an entirely logical po
sition. It was, as all of his speeches
are, clearly and simply expressed."

Mr. Bush: "The words are about
the same as Mr. Roosevelt has been
saying for several months. The dec
laration of a national emergency
probably means that the govern
ment intends to carry out some of
the promises and threats already
uttered. The President probably has
also begun to supply that leader
ship which many people have been
calling for."

Mr. Guerard: "The President has
linked in a masterly fashion the
present emergency with all our tra
ditions and with all our hopes.
Everyone knew that such an emer
gency existed, but many tried to
avert their faces. Now that the plain
facts have been so definitely pro
claimed, the task will be met by a
united people. The words of the
President are not a declaration of
war, but a plain statement of the
conditions of peace. Let freedom
be fully restored, and we shall gladly
law down our arms. But to the
active defense of freedom we are
now committed, one and all."

Mr. Krcps: "I think that it's ex
cellent except that it doesn't go far
enough. I am very much in favor
of declaring an unlimited national
emergency and vvould have liked a
direct statement concerning con
voys. I am not sure but what I
would have welcomed some state
ment about handing passports to
Axis ambassadors and asking them
to go home."
Mr. Martin: "I find myself in
full agreement with what Mr. Roo
sevelt said. At first I hoped he
might be a little more explicit and
state that he would use our navy
for convoy purposes and that he
might possibly mention the use of
the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands,
and Dakar. But after I had listened
to all of the President's speech I
felt that these proposals were im
plicit in his speech. I felt that it
was the best public address that
Mr. Roosevelt has made thus far."

Mr. Robinson: "Like Lincoln and
Wilson, he takes measures to in
sure national unity in anticipation
of further attack upon our vital in
terests. That is the true meaning of
the declaration of a national emer
gency. It will make for national
strength in that it will promote all
measures for national defense. By
so doing we take measure for war
in a world of war, but speaking for
a vast majority of our people Mr.
Roosevelt does not ask for war."

Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, head of the
political science department, said to
The Daily last night:
The Monroe Doctrine and Free
dom of the Seas clothed in the guise
of an "unlimited national emer
gency" will not satisfy the needs of
"struggling democracies." Jean
Nowell called the tune yesterday
morning in stating that "the Presi
dent will say only what the nation
will take at this time."
"You stay out of my yard or I'll
punch you in the nose" are fighting
words for which we will need acts
to back up our pledge made in sol
emn faith that it is "suicide to
wait."
"Extreme limits of our national
power" should have been reached
months ago.
More national aid than ever will
be needed after this disappointing
opportunity to outline national aims
in sustaining the life struggle of the
democracies.
Mr. Bailey: "The only new factor
of impui lance was the announce
ment of an unlimited national emer
gency. Strictly speaking, even this
is not new because it merely means
an all-out intensification of the
defense program to which we are
committed. But psychologically and
physically we have moved a step j
nearer war.

"The rest of the speech is signifi
cant for what it foreshadows. The
emphasis on delivery of goods to
Britain means that the convoy, if
necessary, will be used; the empha
sis on freedom of the seas suggests
that the neutrality act may be re
pealed so as to allow our merchant
men to enter danger zones; the em
phasis on long-range hemispheric
defense indicates that the President
is conditioning the American mind
for the pre-emptive seizure of out
posts like Dakar and the Azores.

"Most important of all, perhaps,
the President has vigorously reas
serted his leadership and quieted
rumors of a physical collapse."

Mr. Bennett: "The President's
speech was a forceful reaffirmation
of international policies already in
effect and familiar to the public, but
not a declaration of new policy nor
a retreat before the isolationist
forces recently so vocal. It was a
powerful, persuasive, and accurate
expose of the international situation,
aimed partly at undermining the iso
lationist position. Particularly ef
fective was the emphasis given to
the real, immediate bone of conten
tion in the war—the control of the
seas. It did not push us appreciably
further into a shooting war than
we were already, hut merely sug
gested rather strongly that we ought
not to be surprised if shooting
starts. It informed us that an un
