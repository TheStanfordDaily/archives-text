# QUAKE REPORTS
## 
### 
Two reports of an earthquake on
the Stanford campus were received
late last night at the Daily shack.
One, from Salvatierra, listed the
quake at 10:21. The second, from
Encina's fifth floor, claimed the
quake was felt at 10:25. The Daily
was not able to verify either report.

The first Saturday game in Stan
ford's football history was played on
a Saturday.
