LAST night, hushed men and women through
out this nation huddled about radios of
every shape and description to hear President
Roosevelt's statement of policy. The national
ear was tuned to the words which the national
leader was ready to say.

Two things of significance made Mr. Roose
velt's speech a turning point in the war of
nerves which Americans have been undergoing
during the roughly year-long period of extreme
national anxiety.

(1) The President announced an unlimited na
tional emergency—marking the beginning of a
drive-drive-drive intensifying of the defense
policy to which the same voice has already com
mitted this country.

(2) Mr. Roosevelt answered criticisms from
the camps which have varyingly (a) accused
him of assuming powers beyond the sphere of
a democratic President and (b) blamed him for
not taking control of the reins of government in
a firm enough hand.

The President, in last night's manifestation of
policy, shaped a course which leaves little
doubt as to the direction which we are taking
or the strength of the hand at the helm.
