# Dear Bud:
## 
### 
THERE'S not just a load of things for me to say
that you don't already know and feel. The
ironic whimsy of an election that stacks the two
leading men against each other for the Daily
editorship, pushes one to the top and pulls the
props from beneath the other, is something that
every Daily man and woman has always re
spected deeply.

Of course, Bud, The Daily and you are still
one and the same. There was never a guestion
that either of you two men stood head and
shoulders above the remainder of the staff for
the managing editorship. And in that number
two position you and The Daily will pull each
other to bigger and better things.
Something that only an associate editor can
feel is the drawing power that The Daily itself
can have. No use telling you that, Bud, because
you and The Daily have rarely drawn a sepa
rate breath for three long years. And I know
that you appreciate that feeling because no one
could have put in the work o rthe talent that
you have without it.
It will be a long time, and I mean it, before
any other editor will have two finer men than
you and Charlie working as his associates.
