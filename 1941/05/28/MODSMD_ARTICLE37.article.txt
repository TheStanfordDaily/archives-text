S STANFORD is a charitable place.
Inspired by the Stanfords' "The children
of California shall be our children," and brought
up in the tradition of help and generosity which
has been guided by three great Presidents, the
Farm has always prided itself on its open-hand
edness, its kindness to the ones who haven't
had the breaks.
The specific "ones" in the Stanford students'
case are the Convalescent Home Drive, the Red
Cross, the March of Dimes, and the war reliefs.
They are not the "ones" closest to home.
Now, Stanford is "democratic." But because
democracy begins with an absence of self-con
sciousness in behalf of the other man and is
sustained by the dignity which comes from a
thorough appreciation of the honesty under
lying the acts which make men equal—because
of these things, Stanford's democracy is a poorly
administered affair.

We give and give; we work. With a concen
tration which allows no self-analysis we do good
and help the other fellow, and we see no flaw
in our attitude. That we haven't the grace or the
dignity to be truly charitable is a fact which is
offensive to us and our traditions.
Because of an uneasiness with each other
and a delicacy which is, to some, largely a
sguirming, awkward thing, we cannot help each
other as easily as we can help a sick child, or
a refugee. We can give to the English or the
Finns, but we cannot give to the man or the
woman who sits two seats down in econ lecture.
We seemingly balk at aiding the dozens of
students who are at Stanford on less than a
shoestring—"if they can't afford it completely,
they have no right to come"—who hash (and
when they don't hash, they don't eat), who have
NY A and an outside job, who have a scholar
ship and, say, a laundry agency.
The Mothers' Club, the emergency funds of
the Dean of Men and Dean of Women's offices,
and other special aid funds, take care of some
of them.
But what about the rest?—J. C. G.
