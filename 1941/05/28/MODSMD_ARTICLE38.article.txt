## ON TRADITIONS 
### JERRY MAYER 
By JERRY MAYER

J>ERHAPS a greater part of any university than its
educators would like to admit are traditions. Tra
ditions give life and personality and memories to a
university. When a student graduates he doesn't re
member particularly about going to classes, or study
ing, or talks with professors.

The old grad, looking back on his college days, re
members the personable little incidents that have their
roots in customs established by generations of stu
dents at his school.

For instance, one of Stanford's most famous tradi
tions is that no person may graduate until he or she
has been kissed on the Quad. An alumnus is more
likely to remember his attempts to live up to theft
tradition than he is his classes or his day-to-day ex
istence.

JJARVARD, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, Stanford,
and a myriad of other outstanding universities
achieve a great measure of their fame not only from
their educational standards, but also because they are
schools that possess a living spirit. The University of
Pittsburgh is a fine educational institution but be
cause the entire plant is located in a forty-story sky
scraper in downtown Pittsburgh it will never have
the living, human quality of other great universities.

Stanford has an advantage in being a small school.
Because each student knows such a great percentage
of his fellow-students traditions can be translated into
a group enterprise in which each student plays an ac
tive part. There is a feeling of cameraderie in the
performance of the Farm's traditions.

J.JOWEVER, these precedents are not the static
things that many persons mistakenly take them
to be. A tradition can last only as long as it is com
patible with the general conduct and life of the par
ticular university. Traditions cannot logically continue
when they are so dated as to hamper contemporary
behavior.

The majority of Stanford's traditions have kept pace
with the times. But one or two of them have become
so obsolete that their performance becomes a drudge
and illogical inconvenience rather than a cherished
duty.

For instance, the ban against bare legs on the Quad.
That custom originated in the days when women's
dresses touched the ground and for a Stanford woman
to display a bare leg was the height of poor taste.
It even amounted to social disgrace. But for such a
tradition to continue now is pointless, it seems to me.

No smoking on the Quadrangle is another case. This
restriction has its arguing points, perhaps, unlike the
ban against bare legs. But more and more Stanford
students are beginning to wonder just why smoking
should not be allowed on the Quad. Mrs. Stanford
was against it for one thing, but in her day there was
a moral taboo against cigarettes that in recent years
has come to exist only slightly.

Traditions should be voluntary, not compulsory.
As soon as the student feels that he is being coerced
into their performance, the custom loses all its attrac
tion.

things that many persons mistakenly take them
to be. A tradition can last only as long as it is com
patible with the general conduct and life of the par
ticular university. Traditions cannot logically continue
when they are so dated as to hamper contemporary
behavior.

The majority of Stanford's traditions have kept pace
with the times. But one or two of them have become
so obsolete that their performance becomes a drudge
and illogical inconvenience rather than a cherished
duty.

For instance, the ban against bare legs on the Quad.
That custom originated in the days when women's
dresses touched the ground and for a Stanford woman
to display a bare leg was the height of poor taste.
It even amounted to social disgrace. But for such a
tradition to continue now is pointless, it seems to me.

No smoking on the Quadrangle is another case. This
restriction has its arguing points, perhaps, unlike the
ban against bare legs. But more and more Stanford
students are beginning to wonder just why smoking
should not be allowed on the Quad. Mrs. Stanford
was against it for one thing, but in her day there was
a moral taboo against cigarettes that in recent years
has come to exist only slightly.

Traditions should be voluntary, not compulsory.
As soon as the student feels that he is being coerced
into their performance, the custom loses all its attrac
tion.

J>ERHAPS a greater part of any university than its
educators would like to admit are traditions. Tra
ditions give life and personality and memories to a
university. When a student graduates he doesn't re
member particularly about going to classes, or study
ing, or talks with professors.

The old grad, looking back on his college days, re
members the personable little incidents that have their
roots in customs established by generations of stu
dents at his school.

For instance, one of Stanford's most famous tradi
tions is that no person may graduate until he or she
has been kissed on the Quad. An alumnus is more
likely to remember his attempts to live up to theft
tradition than he is his classes or his day-to-day ex
istence.

JJARVARD, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, Stanford,
and a myriad of other outstanding universities
achieve a great measure of their fame not only from
their educational standards, but also because they are
schools that possess a living spirit. The University of
Pittsburgh is a fine educational institution but be
cause the entire plant is located in a forty-story sky
scraper in downtown Pittsburgh it will never have
the living, human quality of other great universities.

Stanford has an advantage in being a small school.
Because each student knows such a great percentage
of his fellow-students traditions can be translated into
a group enterprise in which each student plays an ac
tive part. There is a feeling of cameraderie in the
performance of the Farm's traditions.

J.JOWEVER, these precedents are not the static
things that many persons mistakenly take them
to be. A tradition can last only as long as it is com
patible with the general conduct and life of the par
