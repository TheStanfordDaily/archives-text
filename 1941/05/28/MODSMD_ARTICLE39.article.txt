# CAMPUS OPINION
## SAY IT ISN'T SO 
### 
r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
On Saturday, May 23, the Stanford football team
concluded its spring practice with a scrimmage game
between the Reds and the Whites. Everybody went to
the stadium with the intention of enjoying a pleasant
afternoon watching Clark Shaughnessy's Rose Bowl
"T" formation team in action.

On arriving at the rim of the stadium, the first
sight that greeted our eyes was not Mr. Shaughnessy's
well coached teams but a pair of white, bare legs
under an excited whistle-tooting referee. Instead of
the neat white knickers and black and white striped
shirt that usually adorn a football official, in contrast
this referee was dressed in a soiled grey shirt and a
scanty pair of dirty gym shorts. Maybe the ofTensive
ness of the dress of this person could be placed in
part on the marked contrast of Coach Shaughnessy's
black and grey clad coaches and the red- and white
suited players. Anyway, it was the opinion of almost
everyone attending, young and old, that a little com
mon sense and discretion on the part of the rcfei'ee
would enlighten him that at Stanford where so
many eyes are focused for football leadership, that the
least he could do is dress correctly and not make a
burlesque of Stanford football.
All my love,
Kary Natione
