# A 						BAD SITUATION
## 
### 
'T'HE EDITOR. SIR:
Nobody ever expects an athletic team to win all
ist contests. Even Shaughnessy will probably be down
some day. And if the men on a team are enjoying
themselves and doing their best, it doesn't matter if
they never win a game.

But out on Angell Field, a consistently losing team
is having a bad time. The public and one or two mi
nority trackmen may say that Pitch Johnson isn't to
be condemned because his men don't win their events.
They are right, of course, but that is not the reason
his opponents condemn him.
Johnson's faults are his lack of understanding,
narrowmindedness to an absurd degree, training meth
ods entirely opposite to the Stanford tradition, and a
hypocritical attitude. Our only hope is that the Al
mighty B.A.C. will heed the alumni, who for once are
right in going after a conch.
