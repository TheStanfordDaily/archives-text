# Excom Tries To Eliminate Farm Caucus
## Open Nominations, Primaries to Replace Old Election System 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Ex Committee yesterday afternoon
took a deep breath, admitted the
failure of the preferential election
ballot, and applied the elbow grease
with a vengeance in continuing its
effort to sweep out the cobwebs of
the present election system.

If yesterday's recommendations,
according to consensus of Excom,
are adopted, the present nominating
system, or caucuses, will be substi
tuted with an open nomination
meeting, followed by a blitzkrieg
week of primary and final election.

"We're admitting the failure of
preferential elections — that's why
we're instituting primaries," re
ported Ned Pugh.

"The caucus won't hold water be
cause you can't hurt the Hall or
Row a bit by running more than
one or two men for a position under
the proposed method," commented
Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president.
