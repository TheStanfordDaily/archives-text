A plea to Stanford students to
stay off the campus roads now un
dergoing refacing was voiced yes
terday by Frank Fish Walker, finan

"These roads are being refaced
under contract, and any extra lime
required to finish them will cost the
contractor a large amount of
money," he explained.
As the roads now stand, one car
going over any of them will cause
injury necessitating as much as two
weeks' extra work, he went on.
"Students have been removing
the barriers or going over the curb
stones in their impatience. I realize
that the barriers cause them incon
venience, but in view of the se
riousness of the damage one car will
do, I must ask—or rather demand —
that the students stay off these roads
until they are finished," he said.
