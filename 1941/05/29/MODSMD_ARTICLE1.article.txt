■ REACTION at home and abroad to
President Roosevelt's speech
has fallen into line just about as ex
pected. In this country it signaled a
renewed outburst of chauvinism —of
both the lofty and cheap (or Win
chell-style) variety, on one hand;
and set oil the isolationists either by
allaying their fears a shade, or by
scaring the daylights out of them.
The Axis nations and their sub
sidiaries were outraged, although
none of them have marshalled their
propaganda forces for the really big
vitriolic blasts as yet. China and
the British Empire were jubilant.
England hailed the speech as a vir
tual declaration of war.
However it seems that the Amer
ican man-in-the-street and his
British prototype was a shade baf
fled by the President's careful
phasing and lack of concrete
words.
This befuddlement was intended.
Those men and women who wished
to understand the shattering inten
tions behind "we will deliver the
goods," "full national emergency,"
and "our Bunker Hill of tomorrow
may be several thousand miles
away" did understand. Those who
did not wish to understand were
free to take comfort in the fact that
he did not declare outright for con
voys.

r PHE split in opinion among the
isolationists was worthy of note.
Forty members of the anti-war bloc
in Congress met yesterday and de
clared their conviction that Presi
dent Roosevelt has not yet "been
won over to the war party," but,
nevertheless called on the people of
the United States to redouble their
efforts to keep this country out of
war in Europe, Asia or Africa.
One member of the America
First Committee urged a national
referendum, but the conferees fi
nally decided that such a plebiscite
could be sponsored more effective
ly by the nation's newspapers.
But the fact that the voting isola
tionists were not galvanized into
immediate, concerted action is sig
nificant.
Senator Wheeler, however, moved
fast. In a speech delivered at In
dianapolis last night he charged that
Roosevelt in his address had adopted
the creed of the "warmakers" who
would "sacrifice lives that are not
theirs to give." He further asserted
that the President had surrendered
to the influence of "international
bankers . , . jingoistic journalists,
fierce and warlike statesmen . . .
who would plunge this nation into
war either because of their hate or
fear of the little paper-hanger from
Berlin."

/ |VER the city where the "paper
hanger" hangs out, the tenor
of the controlled press comment
clung to the tune that "Roosevelt is
cramming the war down the throats
of the American people," that Ger
many has no "quarrel with America,
but if they start we are ready to
meet all comers." Hitler and Rib
bentrop received copies of the
speech early yesterday morning, but
it was believed that the Fuehrer
might wait as long as 36 hours be
fore announcing the official reaction.
Britain felt fine. Official quar
ters and the press assumed that
Roosevelt's mention of Dakar,
Cape Verde Islands, and the other
key bases meant imminent Amer
ican occupation of these points.
They were not particularly wor
ried over his failure to mention
convoys since it is now evident
that convoys of the World War I
sort are not too effective anyhow,
and he said he was working out
some other method to "deliver the
goods."
According to the Japanese it's
significant that he didn't mention
convoys. Vichy didn't think he
threatened Dakar, but said she'd de
fend it if he started something. And
the Turks perked up to announce
that if Britain could hold out till
January '42, Germany would lose
the war. South America listened,
were impressed, hut hasn't yet com
mented officially. Chunking re
garded the speech as "one of the
most important documents in world
history." As usual, the Russians
just shut up.

has fallen into line just about as ex
pected. In this country it signaled a
renewed outburst of chauvinism —of
both the lofty and cheap (or Win
chell-style) variety, on one hand;
and set oil the isolationists either by
allaying their fears a shade, or by
scaring the daylights out of them.
The Axis nations and their sub
sidiaries were outraged, although
none of them have marshalled their
propaganda forces for the really big
vitriolic blasts as yet. China and
the British Empire were jubilant.
England hailed the speech as a vir
tual declaration of war.
However it seems that the Amer
ican man-in-the-street and his
British prototype was a shade baf
fled by the President's careful
phasing and lack of concrete
words.
This befuddlement was intended.
Those men and women who wished
to understand the shattering inten
tions behind "we will deliver the
goods," "full national emergency,"
and "our Bunker Hill of tomorrow
may be several thousand miles
away" did understand. Those who
did not wish to understand were
free to take comfort in the fact that
he did not declare outright for con
voys.

r PHE split in opinion among the
isolationists was worthy of note.
Forty members of the anti-war bloc
in Congress met yesterday and de
clared their conviction that Presi
dent Roosevelt has not yet "been
won over to the war party," but,
nevertheless called on the people of
the United States to redouble their
efforts to keep this country out of
war in Europe, Asia or Africa.
One member of the America
First Committee urged a national
referendum, but the conferees fi
nally decided that such a plebiscite
could be sponsored more effective
ly by the nation's newspapers.
But the fact that the voting isola
tionists were not galvanized into
immediate, concerted action is sig
nificant.
Senator Wheeler, however, moved
fast. In a speech delivered at In
dianapolis last night he charged that
Roosevelt in his address had adopted
the creed of the "warmakers" who
would "sacrifice lives that are not
theirs to give." He further asserted
that the President had surrendered
to the influence of "international
bankers . , . jingoistic journalists,
fierce and warlike statesmen . . .
who would plunge this nation into
war either because of their hate or
fear of the little paper-hanger from
Berlin."

/ |VER the city where the "paper
hanger" hangs out, the tenor
of the controlled press comment
clung to the tune that "Roosevelt is
cramming the war down the throats
of the American people," that Ger
many has no "quarrel with America,
but if they start we are ready to
meet all comers." Hitler and Rib
bentrop received copies of the
speech early yesterday morning, but
it was believed that the Fuehrer
might wait as long as 36 hours be
fore announcing the official reaction.
Britain felt fine. Official quar
ters and the press assumed that
Roosevelt's mention of Dakar,
Cape Verde Islands, and the other
key bases meant imminent Amer
ican occupation of these points.
They were not particularly wor
ried over his failure to mention
convoys since it is now evident
that convoys of the World War I
sort are not too effective anyhow,
and he said he was working out
some other method to "deliver the
goods."
According to the Japanese it's
significant that he didn't mention
convoys. Vichy didn't think he
threatened Dakar, but said she'd de
fend it if he started something. And
the Turks perked up to announce
that if Britain could hold out till
January '42, Germany would lose
the war. South America listened,
were impressed, hut hasn't yet com
mented officially. Chunking re
garded the speech as "one of the
most important documents in world
history." As usual, the Russians
just shut up.

r PHE split in opinion among the
isolationists was worthy of note.
Forty members of the anti-war bloc
in Congress met yesterday and de

won over to the war party," but,
nevertheless called on the people of
the United States to redouble their
efforts to keep this country out of
war in Europe, Asia or Africa.
One member of the America
First Committee urged a national
referendum, but the conferees fi
nally decided that such a plebiscite
could be sponsored more effective

But the fact that the voting isola

immediate, concerted action is sig
nificant.
Senator Wheeler, however, moved
fast. In a speech delivered at In
dianapolis last night he charged that
Roosevelt in his address had adopted
the creed of the "warmakers" who
would "sacrifice lives that are not
theirs to give." He further asserted
that the President had surrendered
to the influence of "international
bankers . , . jingoistic journalists,
fierce and warlike statesmen . . .
who would plunge this nation into
war either because of their hate or
fear of the little paper-hanger from
Berlin."

/ |VER the city where the "paper
hanger" hangs out, the tenor
of the controlled press comment
clung to the tune that "Roosevelt is
cramming the war down the throats
of the American people," that Ger
many has no "quarrel with America,
but if they start we are ready to
meet all comers." Hitler and Rib
bentrop received copies of the
speech early yesterday morning, but
it was believed that the Fuehrer
might wait as long as 36 hours be
fore announcing the official reaction.
Britain felt fine. Official quar
ters and the press assumed that
Roosevelt's mention of Dakar,
Cape Verde Islands, and the other
key bases meant imminent Amer
ican occupation of these points.
They were not particularly wor
ried over his failure to mention
convoys since it is now evident
that convoys of the World War I
sort are not too effective anyhow,
and he said he was working out
some other method to "deliver the
goods."
According to the Japanese it's
significant that he didn't mention
convoys. Vichy didn't think he
threatened Dakar, but said she'd de
fend it if he started something. And
the Turks perked up to announce
that if Britain could hold out till
January '42, Germany would lose
the war. South America listened,
were impressed, hut hasn't yet com
mented officially. Chunking re
garded the speech as "one of the
most important documents in world
history." As usual, the Russians
just shut up.
