Interfraternity Council, held last
night at the Zete house. It was also
recommended that Harold Bacon be
reappointed faculty member of the
board.
The Council, on suggestion of the
Stanford 50th Anniversary Commit

have a dinner for its alumni Oct. 3,
the day set aside by the committee
as student day. On Oct. 4, the time

alumni.
This student day will follow the
same line as the Back-to-theFarm
celebration this year. There will be
exchange lunches, jolly-ups, and in
formal get-togethers. The fraterni
ties will play a large part in this
occasion.

man, submitted several rushing
change suggestions which have to be
passed by the Row Board before
they can be made public.
