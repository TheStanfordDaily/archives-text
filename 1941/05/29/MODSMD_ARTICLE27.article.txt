NO CHICKEN A LA KINO
Emphasizing the fact that not
only graduating seniors but all
graduates of advanced schools, such
as law, business, and medicine, may
attend the ball, Carlson said bids
will be on sale Tuesday at the
A.S.S.U. office. They will be priced
at $7.50.
Departing from the custom of
serving chicken a la king which
Carlson characterized as "cold, taste
less paste," Marge Tight and War
ren Cleary have set the breakfast
menu as ham and eggs. "It's the
great American breakfast and wc
think it will be more welcome than
anything else in those early hours."
Breakfast will be served in Bran
ner dining hall from 1 to 3 o'clock.
Dancing will start at 10 p.m., end
at 4 a.m.
