# Listening Post Picks Up Talk By Missionary
## Hoover Libe Short Wave Set Receives Chinese Broadcast 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Stanford's shortwave Listening
Post, which is currently gathering
and recording shortwave broadcasts
in the Pacific Area for the Hoover
Library on War, Revolution, and
Peace, picked up Tuesday a broad
cast from Station XGOY, Chung
king.
Telling of the progress of China's
"new youth," Mr. Andrew G. Roy,
a Presbyterian missionary, was the
broadcaster. Mr. Roy, who is now
living in Chengtu, told of the new
co-operation between Chinese and
American students and teachers.
American funds and teachers have
produced a new optimism in Chi
nese students despite the war rag
ing about them.
CONDITIONS BAD
Chinese students are now living
in poor surroundings, the price of
rice has skyrocketed, clothes are of
much cheaper material than before,
there is much ill-health, but the
schools are overflowing with young
men and women eager to learn.
According to Mr. Roy, "On these
campuses, there have dropped in the
last thx - ee years, several tons of
American steel via Japanese air
planes. It has been our experience
that too much of it dropped at one
spot is rather disrupting to educa
tion."
BOMBS RUIN SCHOOLS
Repeated bombings permitted by
American exports of scrap iron have
been the chief disruptive force to
the education of young China. If
these exports were stopped, it
would tend to help them out a great
deal.
Mr. Roy concludes by saying that
despite these obstacles, students arc
"singing as they never sang before,
are intellectually awake, and have
learned a new co-operative life."
