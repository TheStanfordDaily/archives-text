"Newspaperman—A Book About the
Business," by Morton Sontheimer.
Published by Whittlesey House.
82.75.
It's not a textbook, ( but "News
paperman" was written for "the one
half of young America that hopes
to get into the newspaper business."
It is highly probable that more
young people interested in journal
ism will read and profit by Mr. Sou
therner's breezy book than ever cut
the leaves of a journalism textbook.
"Newspaperman" manages to get
the whole picture of metropolitan
journalism practices, authorized or
not, into 328 pages.
Good portions of the material are
standardized—how to approach a
city editor, how to cover a beat, how
to deal with office politics—but these
are enlivened by a fast-moving style
of writing and the inclusion of hi
lax'ious incidents of the city room.
Somehow Mr. Sontheimer's com
ments on and hints about the news
paper business have, for all their
color, a flavor of authenticity. This
is a quality easily and happily di
vorced from the stodginess of text
books and the breathless ■ glamour
of the films. It has firm roots in the
author's experience on the Philadel
phia North American, the Newark
Star - Eagle, the Philadelphia In
quirer, the Atlantic City Daily Press,
and the New York World-Telegram.
Mr. Sontheimer is at present news
editor of the San Francisco News.
The appeal of "Newspaperman" is
certainly not limited to those hoping
to follow journalism as a profession.
It gives too clever a picture of the
gathering and writing of news to be
overlooked by the general reader in
terested in information and amuse
ment.—Mullany

ments on and hints about the news
paper business have, for all their
color, a flavor of authenticity. This
is a quality easily and happily di
vorced from the stodginess of text
books and the breathless ■ glamour
of the films. It has firm roots in the
author's experience on the Philadel
phia North American, the Newark
Star - Eagle, the Philadelphia In
quirer, the Atlantic City Daily Press,
and the New York World-Telegram.

editor of the San Francisco News.
The appeal of "Newspaperman" is
certainly not limited to those hoping
to follow journalism as a profession.
It gives too clever a picture of the
gathering and writing of news to be
overlooked by the general reader in
terested in information and amuse
ment.—Mullany
