NEW YORK, May 28 (UP).—Pres
ident Roosevelt's speech had only
minor influence on the stock market
today. Prices swung narrowly in
quiet trade and closed with gains
and losses evenly divided.
Speaking before audiences ranging from 700 to 20 in number, Speakers'
Bureau members have given a (otal of 107 talks before service clubs,
women's clubs, church groups and schools during the past year. In addi
tion, they had 59 requests for talks which they could not fill.
With this large demand for Stanford speakers in mind, Frank Bauman,

>new Speakers Bureau manager,
suggests that all students who are
interested in speaking of any kind
should get in touch with him before
the end of this quarter.
ALL ELIGIBLE
Speakers' Bureau may be called a
"do-as-you-please" activity. Any
student may participate. Although
the Bureau is under the direction of
the Speech and Drama Department,
speech and drama majors are out
numbered by political science majors
and equalled by economics majors.
Speakers may talk on any sub
ject in which they are interested.
