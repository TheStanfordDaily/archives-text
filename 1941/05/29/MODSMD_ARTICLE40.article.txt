# Farm Track Squad Set For P.C.C.
## 
### 
Although Stanford is a rank out
sider as far as the team title goes,
several local tracksters will be in
the middle of the fight for individual
honors in the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships at Berkeley tomorow and
Saturday.
Captain Ernie Clark and Blair
Hyde will face several of the best
quarter-milers in the country when
they toe the marks for the 440. Gro
ved Klemmer of California has run
47.0, best time in the country, and
is hailed as the next world record
holder in his event.
Klemmer, however, is no cinch to
win with Southern California boast
ing three of the best quarter-milers
i.i its history. Cliff Bourland, Na
tional Junior A.A.U. champ, has been
nosed out several times by Klemmer
but is improving with every outing.
KERNS FAST .
Hufcie Kerns has run but two 440's
this year in competition, both in
relay laps. He passed his opponent
on both occasions and in Los Angeles
last week he was clocked in 4(3.8
after a poor baton pass. Trojan co-
Captain Howard Upton ran 47 flat
as a soph and is gradually rounding
into shape to do it again.
Clark is Pacific A.A.U. 440 title
holder, winning over Bear Fay
Froom in 48.2 last month. Hyde,
who has been running the 880 most
of the time this year, ran a 48.4
relay lap last Saturday to stamp him
as a top-flight one-lapper.
lIILER THIRD
Emerson Hiler has the third best
mark in the discus, but should he
really get hold of one he could pass
Barney Wolf and Jim Clawson of
Cal ond Montana, the men who are
favored over him.
Francis Olson will have no less
than seven half-milers of champion
ship quality to contend with should
they all run that event.
McFARLAND FAVOKEI)
Don McFarland would be the logi
cal winner of the 220 if Pat Haley of
W.S.C. should decide to run the low
hurdles and Kerns and Bourland
both run in the quarter.
Only Trojan Carl Medritt stands
between A1 Grey and the shot put
crown. Russ Peck and Ed Tomaso
with have to contend with Guinn
Smith of Cal before they can pocket
the championship.

nosed out several times by Klemmer
but is improving with every outing.
KERNS FAST .
Hufcie Kerns has run but two 440's
this year in competition, both in
relay laps. He passed his opponent
on both occasions and in Los Angeles
last week he was clocked in 4(3.8
after a poor baton pass. Trojan co-
Captain Howard Upton ran 47 flat
as a soph and is gradually rounding
into shape to do it again.
Clark is Pacific A.A.U. 440 title
holder, winning over Bear Fay
Froom in 48.2 last month. Hyde,
who has been running the 880 most
of the time this year, ran a 48.4
relay lap last Saturday to stamp him
as a top-flight one-lapper.
lIILER THIRD
Emerson Hiler has the third best
mark in the discus, but should he
really get hold of one he could pass
Barney Wolf and Jim Clawson of
Cal ond Montana, the men who are
favored over him.
Francis Olson will have no less
than seven half-milers of champion
ship quality to contend with should
they all run that event.

Don McFarland would be the logi
cal winner of the 220 if Pat Haley of
W.S.C. should decide to run the low
hurdles and Kerns and Bourland
both run in the quarter.
Only Trojan Carl Medritt stands
between A1 Grey and the shot put
crown. Russ Peck and Ed Tomaso
with have to contend with Guinn
Smith of Cal before they can pocket
the championship.
Although Stanford is a rank out
sider as far as the team title goes,
several local tracksters will be in
the middle of the fight for individual
honors in the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships at Berkeley tomorow and
Saturday.
Captain Ernie Clark and Blair
Hyde will face several of the best
quarter-milers in the country when
they toe the marks for the 440. Gro
ved Klemmer of California has run
47.0, best time in the country, and
is hailed as the next world record
holder in his event.
Klemmer, however, is no cinch to
win with Southern California boast
ing three of the best quarter-milers
i.i its history. Cliff Bourland, Na
