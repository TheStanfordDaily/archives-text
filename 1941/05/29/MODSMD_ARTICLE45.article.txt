[JELVING into the so cailed minor sports for a bit of encouraging news.
Out. on newly christened Maloney Field a potential next year's soccer
team beat an aggregation of seniors and alumni 3-0, closing a spring
practice session which saw no less than 67 boys in action.
Just a couple of the standouts on the next year's varsity in this
ancient sport, popular among the players but always neglected by
the spectators, were rugby captain A] Wool, Ollic Hamlin, Map John
son, and Lee Champion.
While over in Encina Pools Coach Nort Thornton sent two water polo
teams through the last interclass game of the spring practice season. And
surprisingly enough a freshman outfit beat the seniors 6-5 in the fourth
overtime. This game, according to Mr. Thornton, is the longest he has
ever heard of.
Standouts for the frosh yesterday and prospects for varsity water polo
next fall were forward Grant Culley, who scored three goals, including
the deciding one, and goalie Pete Lee.
This seems to indicate that both of these fall minor sports are on
the upswing and will be able to keep pace with the Farm's coast
championship major sports teams in football and basketball.
* * * *
r jpiIOSE Alpha Delts have done it again. Mathematically they have
cinched this year's intramural athletic crown even though compe
tition in hardball, softball, and the relays are not completed. This makes
the fourth consecutive championship for old A.D.Phi.

Stanford's hard put varsity track team ought to take a few points in
the sprints of the Coast Conference Meet this coming Saturday on the
strength of numbers alone.
For Coach Pitch Johnson is planing to enter a grand total of four
runners in the dashes up in Berkeley this week-end, Roy Bursch, basc
haller Monte Pfyl, Don McFarland, and Johnny Grant.
Johnson is going to have most of his runners in shorter races than
they are used to in an effort to get. enough points to squeeze a threaten
ing Washington State outfit out of third place.
For instance, Don McFarland, who has been running the 440 for the
past month, will go back to the 100 and 220; Blair Hyde will switch from
a fast field of 880 men to an even faster field of quarter milers; and
Francis Olson, usually a miler, will take Hyde's place as Stanford's entry
in the half mile.

JLJERE'S a rather startling prediction—Hubert Kerns of U.S.C. will beat
potential world's champion California's Grover Klemmer in the 440
up in Berkeley this coming Saturday.
It sounds as if I am taking (his flyer so that, if what secnis im
possible to Cal track fans happens, I can say, "I told you so to them.''
But such a prediction is not entirely without provocation.
Last Saturday in the Los Angeles Relays while a Trojan quartet of
quarter milers were running the third fastest mile relay on record, Kerns
did his part by running 46.8 k>r his quarter mile DESPITE a poor pass
from teammate Cliff Bourland.
It's true that the great Klemmer is undefeated to date, having turned
back Nebraska's highly touted Gene Littler, and has run some beautiful
anchor laps in the various relays.

Out. on newly christened Maloney Field a potential next year's soccer
team beat an aggregation of seniors and alumni 3-0, closing a spring
practice session which saw no less than 67 boys in action.
Just a couple of the standouts on the next year's varsity in this
ancient sport, popular among the players but always neglected by
the spectators, were rugby captain A] Wool, Ollic Hamlin, Map John
son, and Lee Champion.
While over in Encina Pools Coach Nort Thornton sent two water polo
teams through the last interclass game of the spring practice season. And
surprisingly enough a freshman outfit beat the seniors 6-5 in the fourth
overtime. This game, according to Mr. Thornton, is the longest he has
ever heard of.
Standouts for the frosh yesterday and prospects for varsity water polo
next fall were forward Grant Culley, who scored three goals, including
the deciding one, and goalie Pete Lee.
This seems to indicate that both of these fall minor sports are on
the upswing and will be able to keep pace with the Farm's coast
championship major sports teams in football and basketball.

r jpiIOSE Alpha Delts have done it again. Mathematically they have
cinched this year's intramural athletic crown even though compe

the fourth consecutive championship for old A.D.Phi.

Stanford's hard put varsity track team ought to take a few points in
the sprints of the Coast Conference Meet this coming Saturday on the
strength of numbers alone.
For Coach Pitch Johnson is planing to enter a grand total of four
runners in the dashes up in Berkeley this week-end, Roy Bursch, basc
haller Monte Pfyl, Don McFarland, and Johnny Grant.
Johnson is going to have most of his runners in shorter races than
they are used to in an effort to get. enough points to squeeze a threaten
ing Washington State outfit out of third place.
For instance, Don McFarland, who has been running the 440 for the
past month, will go back to the 100 and 220; Blair Hyde will switch from
a fast field of 880 men to an even faster field of quarter milers; and
Francis Olson, usually a miler, will take Hyde's place as Stanford's entry
in the half mile.

JLJERE'S a rather startling prediction—Hubert Kerns of U.S.C. will beat
potential world's champion California's Grover Klemmer in the 440
up in Berkeley this coming Saturday.
It sounds as if I am taking (his flyer so that, if what secnis im
possible to Cal track fans happens, I can say, "I told you so to them.''
But such a prediction is not entirely without provocation.
Last Saturday in the Los Angeles Relays while a Trojan quartet of
quarter milers were running the third fastest mile relay on record, Kerns
did his part by running 46.8 k>r his quarter mile DESPITE a poor pass
from teammate Cliff Bourland.
It's true that the great Klemmer is undefeated to date, having turned
back Nebraska's highly touted Gene Littler, and has run some beautiful
anchor laps in the various relays.
