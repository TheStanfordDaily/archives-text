# Varsity Kickers Trounce Seniors
## 
### 
Age bowed to youth yesterday on
the varsity soccer field as next year's
varsity beat the seniors and graduate
students 3-0.
The seniors held the advantage in
the first quarter but they were un
able to push in a goal. In the third
quarter the varsity got rolling, and
Fernando Eleta made two goals.
The first one was on a goalie fumble,
but. on the second goal they took the
ball through the fullbacks and shot
from about 10 feet out. A1 Wool
made the third goal on a pass from
Joe Macliarg in the last period.
Chuck Parker, Vv"iison Clark, and
Kenny Davidson all turned in ex
celent games for the seniors. Kenny
played wing for the first time, and
was the fastest man on the field.
