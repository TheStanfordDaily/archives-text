# Dates Bother Golf Tourney
## 
### 
Bud Brownell is having an awful
lot of trouble keeping his golf tour- J
naments straight. He and Hal Stone j
are slated to battle it out this week- j
end for the all-University divot title, i
but Brownell is entered in the
Northern California Amateur Cham
pionship meet at the Arinda Country
Club in Oakland.
Bud plays his first round in the â€¢
Northern Cal tourney this Saturday; 1
and if he wins, which is quite likely, j
he will go into his second round on
Sunday. Aii of which leaves him no
time for the all-U clash.
However, if Brownell loses his first .
round at Oakland, he will move his j
base of operations to the Farm
course and begin play for the Stan- j
ford title on Sunday. If Brownell
continues on in the contest at Arinda
C.C., his battle with Stone will have
to be postponed until next week-end.
The match for the Farm cham
pionship is 06 holes, an all-day ses
sion, which is impossible to play
during the week due to classes.
And this is the reason why nobody
j knows when the all-University golf
! championship will be decided.
Meanwhile, Hal Stone sits and j
wistfully polishes his clubs, and j
waits . . . and waits . . . and
waits . . .
