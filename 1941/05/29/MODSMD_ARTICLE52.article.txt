# Stanford Man

### 
THERE'S a special regret that this year's grad
uating class feels on leaving Stanford this
year.
We'd like to be around during January, 1942,
when Dr. Wilbur leaves the office of President
of the University. We'd like to be there to thank
him personally for everything.

It's a bit odd remembering when one was a
freshman, and remembering how one looked
from a distance upon President Wilbur as the
fountainhead of authority and as the personifi
cation of the University.
And again, when one was a sophomore, one
read or heard of the tremendous life he has led;
of his work as Secretary of the Interior under
ex-President Hoover; of his chairmanship of
innumerable committees of great importance;
and of the high respect in which he is held in
the highest circles of the land. He seemed so
far out of reach of a mere student.
And then, as a junior, one visited his office
to ask him about a house dance. And found
that the statesman and educator had some
darned good ideas about the down-to-earth sub
ject.
Finally, one becomes a senior, and finds
that duties and interest lead to closer contact
with the President's office. And one finds,
each time one visits the sanctum-sanctorum,
that the man within is a swell guy.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, senior class president,
graduated from Stanford with the class of '96.
And he's been a real Stanford man ever since.
