THERE'S a pair over in the little office just to
the right of the A.S.S.U. meeting room who
deserve all the praise and all the thanks that
the Farm can give them.
Bruce Jessup and Anne Townsend, outgoing
heads of the Stanford student body, have done
a truly marvelous job.
Both superbly efficient in the Excom meeting
room, in the planning of long-term student body
action, in passing judgment on emergency
measures, and in student-administration rela
tions, these two have made student government
a smoothly functioning and active part of the
Farm picture for 1940-41.
Beyond and above that, "B. J." and "A. T."
have made the A.S.S.U offices a friendly and
a lively place to be. It's been real fun to work
with both of them.
Thanks both. Thanks a lot.
