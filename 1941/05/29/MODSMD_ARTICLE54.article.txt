THERE isn't much that can be said about Presi
dent Roosevelt's speech that hasn't already
been said many times.
To a campus of men and women barely in
their twenties, Tuesday evening's indication
that this country of ours might probably be
headed toward the chaos of a European war
hit a somber and quieting note.
To all of us, as to the undergraduates of every
university in America, the pronouncement of
the course which this nation may be taking led
almost entirely to thoughts of the personal
courses which each of us would take during the
next few years.
The plans and the hopes that have been grow
ing nearer to realization may not be so close
to fulfillment as we had hoped.
But there's something about the way that

the Stanford man and woman feels about the
questionable future that is heartening to the
extreme.
There's mostly the realization, immediately
somber but close to the final stage of common
sense, that, even though the course each of us
takes may differ from the one we hoped to
travel, the future will be what each of us makes
of it.
There are two ways of looking at the picture
of the next few years. First is the way that
fumes and goes hog-wild and bangs its head
against the brick wall. Second is the way that
makes the most and the best of whatever each
day may bring us.
The Farm student will be taking that second
choice.
