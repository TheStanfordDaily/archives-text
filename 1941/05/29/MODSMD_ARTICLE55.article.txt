# BULL SESSION
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
ON STANFORD'S FUTURE
yms week has been what might vulgarly be termed
"tick-off week" for Bull Session. Monday we ticked
off commencement exercises, Tuesday we ticked off the
University's restrictive policies, yesterday we licked
off antedated campus traditions, and today we are
going to tick off a proposal which, according to reli
able information, will shortly be laid before Ex Com
mittee.
In case the reader is unfamiliar with the term
"tick-off," it may be briefly defined as a compound
word denoting the old shake-off, or in more formal
language, a condemnation.
Ex Committee is soon to be called upon to vote on
a new method of selecting candidates for campus elec
tions. The much-maligned "caucus" system is said to
be inadequate and unfair. Too many able condidates
have been sideswiped in the interests of purely polit
ical maneuvers, it is alleged.
In place of the caucus system, a university assembly
has been suggested in which any candidate, no mat
ter what his affiliation, can offer himself as a pros
pective office-holder. A primary election would then
be held and the two top men would run in the final
election.

DO NOT wish particularly to defend the caucus
system as an efficient, omnipotent method of se
lecting candidates. To do that would be to place my
self on very thin ice. But I would like to point out one
of the great benefits of the caucus system.
By this method both the Hall and Row factions are
guaranteed a candidate. Perhaps he often is not the
best nominee, although in my four years at Stanford
I have seldom been able to find fault with any man
elected to office by the Stanford student body.
But the main point is that the present system in
sures a candidate for both the Hall and the How. And
it is essential to the future welfare of the Univer
sity that the Hall keeps at least a working minority
of office-holders.
One of the greatest attractions of Stanford is its ab
solute democracy. The student's freshman year spent
either in Roble or Encina acquaints him with a big
percentage of his class, and those friendships usually
persist through a college career no matter whether he
decides to join a social organization or stay in the
Halls.

4 LTHOUGH little out-and-out rivalry exists be
tween Row and Halls, the system creates a balance
that is beneficial to the University. As long as the
Halls and independents can remain on equal footing
with the fraternities and sororities Stanford will con
tinue to draw outstanding students. But if the time
ever comes when the Row absolutely controls the
campus and the Halls feel left out of things, students
who can't afford to join houses or do not desire to
join them will not attend Stanford. I may say with
reasonable authority that if ever Stanford's Hall sys
tem declines, the University itself will suffer a de
cline, at least in the quality of its students. It may be
pointed out that Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbui*, Herbert
Hoover, and Frank Fish Walker are all Hall men.
Any other system of selecting candidates for Stan
ford elections would run the risk of restricting the Hall
man in campus politics. And to do this is to threaten
the democratic foundations of the University.
This is a point that the Univei'sity itself may well
remember. The rise in tuition and in rents for the
men's halls is going to make it more difficult for the
marginal student to attend Stanford. If the Univer
sity ever reaches the point where wealth is a pre
requisite of attendance, student democracy on the
Farm will be through, and the University itself will be
the one to suffer most.
