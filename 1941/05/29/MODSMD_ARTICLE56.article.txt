# CAMPUS OPINION
## HOW ABOUT THAT COP 
### 
r jTHE EDITOR, SIR:
j It wasn't so bad when we got traffic tickets
I from Gordy. Most of us have respect for him, and are
i willing to abide by his judgment. But this new guy
who roams around giving people his stony, officious
look is absolutely intolerable.
You'd think that everyone on campus was a gang
ster. This guy has the wrong idea. He seems to like
giving tickets. Nothing makes him happier than to
catch a guy speeding or parked in the wrong place.
The other day he stopped me and asked if I had
stopped at the last stop sign. I told him that I had,
and he said, "Well, I wasn't sure. I was pretty far
i back and couldn't tell. Just wanted to make sure."
Now what kind of a terrible guy would say a
thing like that. I don't think there is room on this
campus for a person like that, and I think he ought to
! be given a job somewhere around Morgan Hill.
