# TRACK ON SKIDS?
## 
### 
HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
The letter in Wednesday's issue of The Daily ex
pressed not only the opinion of most of the Stanford
students with whom I have talked about the present
track and field set-up at the University, but the ideas
expressed also seemed to be those of the majority
of the members of the track team itself.
These members—their names are withheld for ob
vious reasons—claim that the reason that Stanford's
track team has not made a better showing this year
has been the fact that there is no incentive to win
under the present coach.
If this is so, it is certainly time that the B.A.C. rec
ognized the fact and took steps to remove the coach.
If a man cannot command enough respect and admira
tion from the men he coaches to give them a desire
to win, whether for the school, themselves or for the
coach, he should not be allowed to continue in his
position.
Stanford track has had too fine a record to bo put
on the skids by a man who either cannot or will not
straighten matters out, or by a group that will not
take the steps to straighten the matters out if the
coach has failed, as he evidently has.
