ANTHONY EDEN outlined Brit
ain's war aims yesterday. In
cluded were President Roosevelt's
"four freedoms" plus provisions of
stern military and political nature to
prevent Germany from ever again
challenging world peace. However,
the Foreign Secretary's words
seemed more in the nature of a
thank-you note to the United States
than anything else. Certainly there
v/as very little that was concrete in
them.
On other fronts the complete Nazi
occupation of Crete in the immediate
future became an accepted fact; and
world attention turned to speculation
about a possible German invasion of
Cypress. There was intensified pa
trol activity on the Libyan-Egyptian
border. Over in the Far East Japan
started the latest in its series of
crises over the Dutch East Indies,
probably as an Axis answer to
Roosevelt's speech.
In this country the Ship Seizure
Rill was sent to the White House.
It was announced that 8,000 li.A.F.
pilots will begin training in the
United States some time early this
June. There was a lot of talk in
Washington about gasoline-less
Sundays, universal daylight sav
ing, and no more steel for golf
clubs. And when they get down
to something like this, it's get
ting pretty darn basic.
In other words, the United States
spent an average day in the life of
a nation preparing to enter a world
war. The countries already at war
plugged along—the Germans gain
ing, Britain retreating.

r |' , HE writer of History 1941 leaves
the top-left spot in The Daily
today with little sense of finality
in her last 30-mark. She walked into
the middle of the hottest war news
of all time, and she's walking out
while it's still hot.
Since February 17, History has
reported and commented on the
news as it broke. Most of the pr|-
dictions made have become facts
—not because the writer is any
crystal gazer, but because the
shape of coming events is fairly
evident if one has access to the
available information and can
look at that information without
too much emotion.
Long range predictions have been
left to those better qualified to make
them, because, frankly, the writer
had no desire to stick out her neck
that far. Personal feelings about the
controversial issues of the day have
not been unduly plugged, because
she believes that the unimportant
individual's beliefs are peculiarly
unimportant to the public.

r FO Amie Reichert, who will write
the column during Volume 100,
the writer hands the delightful task
of making sense out of scores of
conflicting United Press reports, and
scaring herself to death every night.
Volume 100's Historian can write
like nobody's business, and what
she says will be worth time in any
man's 8 o'clock.
However, it's highly probable
that Miss Reichert will be bat
tling the toughest thing a writer
can meet —military censorship. A
nation at war cannot permit un
biased reporting which may be
bad for morale. The ranks of the
witch-burners — who find pro-
Germanism and un-Americanism
in the clear thinging and the opin
ions of their fellows—are grow
ing. They'll take over very soon.
And the writers will shut up or
get themselves shut up.
This writer sincerely hopes that
her successor will not face a gagged
typewriter next fall. It is possible
that the United States will not en
ter the war until next spring. It is
possible that Britain will fall—very
remotely possible. This writer still
thinks the shooting will start be
fore next Reg Day.
Today is Memorial Day. Every
body makes speeches and puts
flowers on the graves of the World
War I dead. Instead of playing taps
at sunset over all the cemetaries
maybe the buglers should swing out
on "We Don't Know Where We're
Goin', But We're Goin'."
Rest in peace.
