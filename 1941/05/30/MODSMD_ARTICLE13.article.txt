# Air Interviews Will Continue
## 
### 
Established at Stanford a week
and a half ago was the first col
lege flying unit in the country as
set forth in the program announced
by the War Department recently.
So immediate was the establishment
of this unit that the Air Corps de
cided to attempt to found another
similar organization here on the
campus.
A representative has been at
Room 538 in the military department
for the past week and will be here
j the first half of next week. All stu
dents who feel that they can meet
the requirements are urged to con
sult with him any afternoon from 2
to 4 o'clock.
The first unit elected Lee Telesco
: leader, and James Verdieck deputy
leader. The unit is reported to be
stationed and sent to training some
time late in June. They will spend
30 weeks in training in primary,
; basic and advanced flying school
! and upon graduation and commis
| sion as second lieutenants in the air
j corps reserve they will either be de-
I tailed to active duly or sent to an
I instructor's school.
