# Summer Session to Speed Up Training in Essential Fields
## 
### 
(With the uncertainty of the future leaving many men undergraduates
at loose ends, a speed-up of training throughout Stanford has been de
signed to enable those eligible for military training to complete their
education as soon as possible. This paper heartily recommends that under
graduates give this program the deepest consideration.—Editor's Note)

, The opening of Stanford's sum
mer quarter on the 24th of June will
see a general speeding up of training
in several schools of the University
for two major purposes:
(1) To graduate skilled personnel
in industry, the sciences, and busi
ness administration; and
(2) To enable Stanford under
graduates to complete their Univer
sity training before being called
into military service.
VITAL TRAINING
Skilled men in various essential
fiels are a vital necessity under any
form of government, and especially
so during a period of national emer
gency. For men with three or more
quarters before graduation, special
co-ordinated courses of study are
being planned out to facilitate this
training.
During World War I, experience
showed that of over a thousand un
dergraduate men who left school for
military service, only a minority of
a few hundred returned for fur
ther training. Of this figure only a
fraction ever completed their origi
nally planned courses.
The speed-up as personified in
the summer school courses and in
other branches of the University is
to enable men of military age to
complete their essential higher edu
cation before being called to serv
ice.
Special opportunities in training
are being offered as an aid even to
students who arc still lower-class
men.
On page three of today's Daily is
a story outlining briefly the plans
for business school training. Fur
ther information may be obtained
at the Graduate School of Business.
The School of Engineering will
offer summer quarter courses for the
first time, and for the first time also
the Graduate School of Business will
accept first-year students, who oth
erwise would have had to wait until
the fall quarter. Summer quarter
courses in physiotherapy to meet a
shortage of technicians will be an
other "first" on the Farm.
The School of Engineering has so
arranged its curriculum that the
full four-year course leading to the
A.B. degree can be completed in
three years. An 18-year-old fresh
man can obtain his degree before
becoming eligible for military serv
ice at 21.
Dr. Mitchell announced yesterday
that authorization has just been re
ceived for continuance of the CAA
flying training program through the
summer under the direction of Pro
fessor D. L. Webster. Arrangement
has been made, he said, for students
to enroll for 8 units of the CAA
course on payment of only part of
the full University tuition fee.
Stanford will send 55 juniors and
seniors in the artillery corps of the
R.O.T.C. for six weeks' summer
training at Fort Ord and 12 from
the ordnance unit to Fort Lewis,
according to Colonel Harry B. Allen.

full four-year course leading to the
A.B. degree can be completed in
three years. An 18-year-old fresh
man can obtain his degree before
becoming eligible for military serv
ice at 21.
Dr. Mitchell announced yesterday
that authorization has just been re
ceived for continuance of the CAA
flying training program through the
summer under the direction of Pro
fessor D. L. Webster. Arrangement
has been made, he said, for students
to enroll for 8 units of the CAA
course on payment of only part of
the full University tuition fee.
Stanford will send 55 juniors and
seniors in the artillery corps of the
R.O.T.C. for six weeks' summer
training at Fort Ord and 12 from
the ordnance unit to Fort Lewis,
according to Colonel Harry B. Allen.
(With the uncertainty of the future leaving many men undergraduates
at loose ends, a speed-up of training throughout Stanford has been de
signed to enable those eligible for military training to complete their
education as soon as possible. This paper heartily recommends that under
graduates give this program the deepest consideration.—Editor's Note)

, The opening of Stanford's sum
mer quarter on the 24th of June will
see a general speeding up of training
in several schools of the University
for two major purposes:
(1) To graduate skilled personnel
in industry, the sciences, and busi
ness administration; and
(2) To enable Stanford under
graduates to complete their Univer
sity training before being called
into military service.
VITAL TRAINING
Skilled men in various essential
fiels are a vital necessity under any
form of government, and especially
so during a period of national emer
gency. For men with three or more
quarters before graduation, special
co-ordinated courses of study are
being planned out to facilitate this
training.
During World War I, experience
showed that of over a thousand un
dergraduate men who left school for
military service, only a minority of
a few hundred returned for fur
ther training. Of this figure only a
fraction ever completed their origi
nally planned courses.
The speed-up as personified in
the summer school courses and in
other branches of the University is
to enable men of military age to
complete their essential higher edu
cation before being called to serv
ice.
Special opportunities in training
are being offered as an aid even to
students who arc still lower-class
men.
On page three of today's Daily is
a story outlining briefly the plans
for business school training. Fur
ther information may be obtained

The School of Engineering will
offer summer quarter courses for the
first time, and for the first time also
the Graduate School of Business will
accept first-year students, who oth
erwise would have had to wait until
the fall quarter. Summer quarter
courses in physiotherapy to meet a
shortage of technicians will be an
other "first" on the Farm.
