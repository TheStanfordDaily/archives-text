### 
LONDON, May 2!) (UP).—Brit
ain announced her war aims today
for the first time, adopting Presi
dent Roosevelt's "four freedoms"
and adding the stipulation stern
military and political measures must
prevent Germany from ever again
challenging world peace.
These aims envisage a post-war
reconstruction of the world by the
British Empire, the United States,
and the other "free nations" un
ravaged by the war.
The government has given no
hint of the nature of the measures
which would be used to curb a Ger
man challenge, but both Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden and Prime
Minister Winston Churchill before
the war were among the strongest
supporters of the League of Na
tions. It appears logical, therefore,
to believe any peace settlement
which thc.y dominate would aim at
providing an effective system of col
lective security, backed by armed
force.
