# 'Successor Not Named' Says Wilbur
## Success of This Year Indicates Promising Future for Stanford

"There lias been no decision made
y 1' as to who will be (he new pres
ident of Stanford University, ac
cording to President Kay Lyman
VVi.'.bur, who will be succccded Jan.
I, 1942, after 20 years as head of
the University.
Dr. Wilbur stated in an interview
this week that "This has been one
of 1 "anford's good years," and at the
s<t; < time commented that the fu
tu c looks "very promising."
' W* v«. had one of our best ath
lei i: years in spite of difficulties —
we didn't win everything," he said
with a reflective smile. He did not
n:i i liiin this spring's Atherton purge
c King eight freshman athletes, in
connection with the "difficulties.''
''This has also been a good serious
year in spite of difficulties encoun-
wbich might destroy our good
set-up," he added. The President
wc t on to say that those students
receiving Lower Division Honors
and those elected to Phi Beta Kappa
ha 7( made "'just as good records as
in ; ny previous year" at Stanford.
"In fact, the year has been so
gond that we have more students
applying for admission for next year
than we can accept," Dr. Wilbur
concluded. This statement definitely
spikes ail rumors of the past few
months to the effect that the Uni
versity will be forced to close down
next year due to the draft and pres
ent national emergency.
Dr. Wilbur originally was sched
uled to retire at the end of his 25th
year as president, which was cele
brated during the present academic
year. Due to the University's Fif
tieth Anniversary program of this
year and next fall, he was prevailed
upon to stay over until next Jan
uary.
