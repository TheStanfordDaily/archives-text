# Seniors Find Hoover Libe 'Pretty Classy Palace'
## 
### VIC MINAHAN 
"Yep. it's pretty classy."
There were plenty of remarks from the 700-odd seniors and graduate
students who wandered through the Hoover Library yesterday after
noon, but that one summed them up. "Yep, it is pretty classy."
In fact, the effect you get upon entering this somewhat fabulous struc-

ture is more of a palace than a<
library. The polished green-black
marble floors and the ornate iron
work gates of the first floor give you
the impression that Louis XIV him
self is liable to come around the cor
ner any minute.
15 STUDY CUBICLES
The rest of the building is more
practical, though hardly any less
"classy." The second floor is made
up of some fifteen or more 12x6
cubicles for individual study. Each
of them has a window to the out
side, and the main impression they
give is of quiet and coolness—per
fect for studying.
From then on up to the 12th floor
you're in the stacks. Each stack
floor is divided horizontally to make
two floors. On them are the long
rows of empty gray stacks in which
will be stored the thousands of
books and documents that make up
the Hoover Collection.
UNFINISHED FLOORS
The eighth and ninth floors have
not been finished and present a
rather startling contrast to the fin
ished modernism of the rest of the
building. These floors will become
stack floors as more material arrives.
"Huh, I bet they ran out of
money!" one co-ed grunted.
The tenth, eleventh and twelfth
floors consist of offices, some of
which remind you of those in mov
ies—luxurious stained wood, mod
ern fixtures. All that was missing
was Edward Arnold sitting in a
swivel chair and hollering for his
secretary.
On the thirteenth floor you again
enter the cold atmosphere of un
painted concrete. It is completely
empty. This is Quasimodo's cham
ber. And all alone in the middle sits
Quasi —the conglomeration of levers,
wires and gadgets that plays the
Carillon. Oh, yes. Quasi's little
brother, the automatic drum player,
is there too, looking for all the world
like a grotesque enlargement of
that little music box that you got
bn ydur fourth birthday.
VIEW FROM TOWER
The fourteenth floor is the bell
tower. This was the favorite spot of
yesterday's visitors. Overshadowing
the bells as an attraction was the
view. The Bay and hills to the east,
San Francisco's hills to the north,
the foothills to the west, and the
Santa Clara Valley stretching away
to the south combine to present an
impressive panorama.
And that's the Hoover Libe. As a
mere repository for a collection of
books it outdoes itself. But as a
landmark, an impressive oracle of
learning and learneds, it brings
Stanford into its own. 1
The Campanile—phooey!
