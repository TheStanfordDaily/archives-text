# REPORT ADDRESSES
## 
### 
The local draft board reminds all
registered students that any change
of address for the summer or per
manently must be reported before
leaving school. Such a report is de
manded by the Selective Service Act
and its regulations. Reporting the
change of address absolves draftees
from any unfortunate consequences,
the board stated.
