# Lomita Work To End June 10
## 
### 
With the first coat of oil now dry
ing on Lomita Drive and Santa Te
resa. the second coat will be applied
Monday and after that has dried the
actual surfacing will be poured.
When complete, the streets will have
the same macadamized appearance
that Serra Street has before the Me
morial Theater.
As it now stands the roads will be
ready for use June 10. All the side
walks at this time will also be fin
ished. Superintendent McDonnell
has said that the students have been
co-operating very well with the
Corporation Yard in keeping off the
roads as they are now, and he added
that it will be necessary for just a
short while longer.
The landscaping around the Hoo
ver Library is being rushed to com
pletion before the formal dedication
of the library during the 50th An
niversary Celebration. The grounds
are to be landscaped similarly to
those of the Memorial Theater, with
ivy being planted instead of grass.
During the summer the library
parking lot will be attended to.
Present plans are for the parking lot
to be moved directly behind the
library and the present lot to be
landscaped like the front of the
library with several large shade
trees to be planted and walks to be
put in.
The slight incline behind the
Hoover Library and the parking lot
will be kept as it is, forming a nat
ural border between the two.
