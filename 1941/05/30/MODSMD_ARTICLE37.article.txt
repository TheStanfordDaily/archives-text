# Klystron Pops New Science Inventions
## 
### 
One of the most outstanding de
velopments in the field of science
for the past year at Stanford was
the invention and development of
the Klystron by two research work
ers, Sigurd and Russel Varian, in
collaboration with the Stanford phys
ics department.
This remarkable discovery has
many varied uses of great import
ance, one of which is in connection
with national defense, but about
which no information can be given
out. Further research 'and devel
opment is being continued here at
Stanford under a research grant es
tablished by the Sperry Gyroscope
Company.
