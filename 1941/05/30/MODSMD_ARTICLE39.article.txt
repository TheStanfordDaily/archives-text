# Heffner Lauded for Work In Theater Department
## 
### MARY JUDSON 
If there ever was a man who had the welfare and p.«£ress of Tiis stu
dents and department at heart, that man is Hubert IlefFner, head of the
Speech and Drama Department at Stanford.
In the two short years that Mr. IleiTner has been on the Farm he has
co-ordinated and molded the theater department into a unit which is

recognized among all the universi-<
ties in the United States for its
excellence in that field.
When Mr. Heffner came to Stan
ford. he found waiting for him a
magnificent theatrical plant and a
growing interest in the drama which
only needed a master hand to pull
the two together.
THREE STEPS
In doing this, Mr. Heffner out
lined a course of three steps. First
he reorganized the curriculum in
all its phases. This has meant that
Stanford's Drama Department now
offers everything in the speech and
drama field from voice clinic work
and acting to teaching and design.
Secondly, Mr. Heffner built up a
staff of teachers which can equal
any in the country for excellence
and experience in the field.
Thirdly, the activities were re
organized. This means mostly fos
tering a greater interest in drama
on the campus and presenting plays
that the students wanted. With
productions such as "The Warriors
Husband," ".Richard II," "Of Thee
I Sing" and "The Bartered Bride,"
it is easy to see that the department
is interested in following student
desires.
Mr. Heffner's main interest is
getting everyone on the campus to
feel that he can take a part in any
production; that he will be wel
comed, in fact.
SERVICE TO STUDENTS'
"There is no need to make this
an isolated department; its func
tion is mainly that of service to the
students," Mr. Heffner declared.
The newest angle to be estab
lished in the drama program is ad
ditional instruction in the radio
field. This not only includes voice
training for broadcasting, but also
will give practice in the handling
and originating of commercial radio
programs.
When asked what his dream for
future development in the depart
ment would be, Mr. Heffner
launched into an enthusiastic de
scription of his desire for a group
of students to "give America an
outstanding stock company."
SELF-SUPPORTING
This enterprise would require
funds for one year but thereafter
would become a self-supporting or
ganization. Mr. Heffner feels that
the future of American drama lies
in the universities and in their
ability to carry on a profession
which might well die out in the
present materialistic civilization.
In order to insure the best in act
ing ability, the instruction of mem
bers of a stock company would have
to come from qualified actors who
would teach as "assistants in act
ing," according to Mr. Heffner.
These actors would receive a sort
of fellowship to a university in order
to carry out the plans.

Another plan which may be real
ized in the near future is that of
presenting departmental shows in
the Lawrence Frost Amphitheater.
The Amphitheater, which is only
used for graduation and some stu
dent pageants, would prove an ex
cellent site for summer shows and
productions on the Cavalcade order.
Mr. Heffner pointed out that the
climate here is ideal for outdoor
shows of the kind with music and
dance combined with pageant and
drama.
And so, with this roundup of past
and future activity augmenting
present performances, Mr. Heffner
is guiding the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department to greater glo
ries, it seems. He seems eminently
satisfied with his position, and
when asked what the outstanding
characteristic of Stanford was to
him, he answered sincerely, "There
is more cordiality and warmth in
the reception of people here at
Stanford than I have ever met
with in any of the universities I
have attended."

feel that he can take a part in any
production; that he will be wel
comed, in fact.
SERVICE TO STUDENTS'
"There is no need to make this
an isolated department; its func
tion is mainly that of service to the
students," Mr. Heffner declared.
The newest angle to be estab
lished in the drama program is ad
ditional instruction in the radio
field. This not only includes voice
training for broadcasting, but also
will give practice in the handling
and originating of commercial radio
programs.
When asked what his dream for
future development in the depart
ment would be, Mr. Heffner
launched into an enthusiastic de
scription of his desire for a group
of students to "give America an
outstanding stock company."
SELF-SUPPORTING
This enterprise would require
funds for one year but thereafter
would become a self-supporting or
ganization. Mr. Heffner feels that
the future of American drama lies
in the universities and in their
ability to carry on a profession
which might well die out in the
present materialistic civilization.
In order to insure the best in act
ing ability, the instruction of mem
bers of a stock company would have
to come from qualified actors who
would teach as "assistants in act
ing," according to Mr. Heffner.
These actors would receive a sort
of fellowship to a university in order
to carry out the plans.

Another plan which may be real
ized in the near future is that of
presenting departmental shows in
the Lawrence Frost Amphitheater.
The Amphitheater, which is only
used for graduation and some stu
dent pageants, would prove an ex
cellent site for summer shows and
productions on the Cavalcade order.
Mr. Heffner pointed out that the
climate here is ideal for outdoor
shows of the kind with music and
dance combined with pageant and
drama.
And so, with this roundup of past
and future activity augmenting
present performances, Mr. Heffner
is guiding the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department to greater glo
ries, it seems. He seems eminently
satisfied with his position, and
when asked what the outstanding
characteristic of Stanford was to
him, he answered sincerely, "There
is more cordiality and warmth in
the reception of people here at
Stanford than I have ever met
with in any of the universities I
have attended."
If there ever was a man who had the welfare and p.«£ress of Tiis stu
dents and department at heart, that man is Hubert IlefFner, head of the
Speech and Drama Department at Stanford.
In the two short years that Mr. IleiTner has been on the Farm he has
co-ordinated and molded the theater department into a unit which is

recognized among all the universi-<
ties in the United States for its
excellence in that field.
When Mr. Heffner came to Stan
ford. he found waiting for him a
magnificent theatrical plant and a
growing interest in the drama which
only needed a master hand to pull
the two together.
THREE STEPS
In doing this, Mr. Heffner out
lined a course of three steps. First
he reorganized the curriculum in
all its phases. This has meant that
Stanford's Drama Department now
offers everything in the speech and
drama field from voice clinic work
and acting to teaching and design.
Secondly, Mr. Heffner built up a
staff of teachers which can equal
any in the country for excellence
and experience in the field.
Thirdly, the activities were re
organized. This means mostly fos
tering a greater interest in drama
on the campus and presenting plays
that the students wanted. With
productions such as "The Warriors
Husband," ".Richard II," "Of Thee
I Sing" and "The Bartered Bride,"
it is easy to see that the department
is interested in following student
desires.

The Amphitheater, which is only
used for graduation and some stu
dent pageants, would prove an ex
cellent site for summer shows and
productions on the Cavalcade order.
Mr. Heffner pointed out that the
climate here is ideal for outdoor
shows of the kind with music and
dance combined with pageant and
drama.
And so, with this roundup of past
and future activity augmenting
present performances, Mr. Heffner
is guiding the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department to greater glo
ries, it seems. He seems eminently
satisfied with his position, and
when asked what the outstanding
characteristic of Stanford was to
him, he answered sincerely, "There
is more cordiality and warmth in
the reception of people here at
Stanford than I have ever met
with in any of the universities I
have attended."
If there ever was a man who had the welfare and p.«£ress of Tiis stu
dents and department at heart, that man is Hubert IlefFner, head of the
Speech and Drama Department at Stanford.
In the two short years that Mr. IleiTner has been on the Farm he has
co-ordinated and molded the theater department into a unit which is

recognized among all the universi-<
ties in the United States for its
excellence in that field.
When Mr. Heffner came to Stan
ford. he found waiting for him a
magnificent theatrical plant and a
growing interest in the drama which
only needed a master hand to pull
the two together.
THREE STEPS
In doing this, Mr. Heffner out
lined a course of three steps. First
he reorganized the curriculum in
all its phases. This has meant that
Stanford's Drama Department now
offers everything in the speech and
drama field from voice clinic work
and acting to teaching and design.
Secondly, Mr. Heffner built up a
staff of teachers which can equal
any in the country for excellence
and experience in the field.
Thirdly, the activities were re
organized. This means mostly fos
tering a greater interest in drama
on the campus and presenting plays
that the students wanted. With
productions such as "The Warriors
Husband," ".Richard II," "Of Thee
I Sing" and "The Bartered Bride,"
it is easy to see that the department
is interested in following student
desires.
Mr. Heffner's main interest is
getting everyone on the campus to
feel that he can take a part in any
production; that he will be wel
comed, in fact.
SERVICE TO STUDENTS'
"There is no need to make this
an isolated department; its func
tion is mainly that of service to the
students," Mr. Heffner declared.
The newest angle to be estab
lished in the drama program is ad
ditional instruction in the radio
field. This not only includes voice
training for broadcasting, but also
will give practice in the handling
and originating of commercial radio
programs.
When asked what his dream for
future development in the depart
ment would be, Mr. Heffner
launched into an enthusiastic de
scription of his desire for a group
of students to "give America an
outstanding stock company."
SELF-SUPPORTING
This enterprise would require
funds for one year but thereafter
would become a self-supporting or
ganization. Mr. Heffner feels that
the future of American drama lies
in the universities and in their
ability to carry on a profession
which might well die out in the
present materialistic civilization.
In order to insure the best in act
ing ability, the instruction of mem
bers of a stock company would have
to come from qualified actors who
would teach as "assistants in act
ing," according to Mr. Heffner.
These actors would receive a sort
of fellowship to a university in order
to carry out the plans.

Another plan which may be real
ized in the near future is that of
presenting departmental shows in
the Lawrence Frost Amphitheater.
The Amphitheater, which is only
used for graduation and some stu
dent pageants, would prove an ex
cellent site for summer shows and
productions on the Cavalcade order.
