RALPH H. LUTZ, director of the Hoover Library on War,
Revolution and Peace, inspects the newly received 35-bell
carillon donated by Belgium.

STANFORD sudents this year
as in years past "made checks
payable" to Stanford Univer
sity, but they were 15 larger
this year than before. Next
year tuition stays' the same,
but a flat $10 syllabus fee
will be paid by everyone.
Pictured at right are happy
gangs filling out their reg
books.


-OACH EVERETT DEAN is shown here with the two co
japtains who distinguished themselves this year on the
hardwood. From left, Davidson, Dean, Williams.


SHOWN IN MODEL, Palo Alto's new underpass, completed
early this year, now provides swift sailing into Paly and
revival of the old rides tradition.




PETE KMETOVIC, flashy halfback who will be back v/ith the Red Machine next fall, is
shown here rolling over the Oregon goal line for the first score in one of Stanford's early
season wins. Tatkler is Len Isberg.


"BIG CHIEF" Norm Standlee,
though out with a bad leg
for a large part of the sea
son, was the real powerhouse
fullback which added no end
to the success of Coach
Shaughnessy's new T for
mation Red Machine. Stand
lee, who graduates in June,
has taken a job with the Chi
cago Bears, top-ranking pro
team, coached by George
Halas.


REWARD FOR his flashing performance in the Rose Bowl
game came to Pete Kmetovic in the form of a watch—and
a big kiss—from Hollywood's Jean Parker.

JUST BEFORE THAT BIGGEST Big Game, the team gathered around "Coach Clark" for some last minute advice. From
left, back row, Hugh Gallarneau, Milt Vucinich, Frankie Albe it, Pete Kmetovic, Vic Lindskog; front, Stan Graff, the Coach,
Fred Meyer, Bruno Banducci, Dick Palmer, Chuck Taylor, £d Stamm. .


STANFORD'S SOUTHERN DIVISION titlists are shown here with the famous radio comedy
team. From left, Kenny Davidson, Fordy Anderson, Charlie McCarthy, Edgar Bergen, Dick
Taylor, Bill Cowden, Don Burness.


SEATED AT the big round Ex Commitee table are the two
student body officers who have been responsible for one
of the best years of student government at Stanford, Bruce
Jessup and Anne Townsend.


RETURNED TO its old original site on the bed of Lake La
gunita, the bonfire built by the Class of '44 was a flaming
success, preluded a great after-game celebration of the re
turn of the Axe.


THE AXE! This traditional symbol of victorious Stanford
teams returned to the Farm this year by reason of the Big
Game score of 13-7.
