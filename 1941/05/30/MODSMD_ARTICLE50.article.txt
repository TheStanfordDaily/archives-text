# Ex Com Has Active Year With Honor Code Query, Activities Files, Elections
## 
### 
Student Executive Committee has
handled Associated Students activi
ties during the past year at Stan
ford, meeting once each week to
determine policies and legislate.
The Daily here undertakes a sum
mary of Ex Committee rulings and
activities:
Committee decidcd in favor of and
promoted the second annual Big
Game Dance, an organized celebra
tion following the Big Game. Work
ing under Bruce Jessup and Anne
Townsend, A.S.S.U. president and
vice-president, Excom continued its
open door policy at all meetings,
welcoming members of the student
body to attend.
ACTIVITY FILES
Under the hand of Ex Committee,
Activities Card Files traveled a
round-about odyssey through the
machinery of student government,
enjoying a reorganization boom
early in the year, then sinking to
a perilous low in practicability, and
finally being filed unanimously in
the A.S.S.U. wastebasket.
Cardinals' gravy boat was over
turned by an investigation of the
appointment system, and rulings
were passed requiring review of
minutes of Cardinals meetings by
Excom, and a joint meeting with
Excom, to select new Cardinals
members. The first meeting under
the new set-up was held last Tues
day night.
RETURNED TO LAKEBED
The Big Game Bonfire was re
turned this year to its traditional
location in Lagunita lakebed, com
plete with Encina guards armed to
the teeth with the spirit of Cal-
Stanford rivalry and, incidentally,
bludgeons.
Paving the road of victory that
Coach Clark Shaughnessy might
drive his Model "T" into the Rose
Bowl New Year's Day, Rally Com
mittee under a paternal Executive
Committee eye threw a mild sort
of hubbub in Los Angeles' staid
Ambassador Hotel. All Hell broke
loose.
MEETS WITH WILBUR
Later in the year the Committee
met with President Ray Lyman Wil
bur at his Lagunita Knoll home
for an investigation into Stanford's
famed Honor Code. It was decidcd
students were not accepting their
responsibilities, and Excom later
adopted an educational program to
rectify the situation.
Upon the suggestion of Norm Ross,

the legislators adopted plans for
publication of a freshman pictorial
for next fall, complete with cuts
and identification of all Stanfordites
of '45. Ross was appointed editor,
and will also handle Pre-Registra
tion activities with Hope Branum,
junior transfer head.
At the present time Ex Committee
is engaged in revising the election
system, considering substitution of
a nominations meeting and primaries
to replace caucuses. Another reform
under way is the current examina
tion into defunct organizations, par
ticularly Axe Society.
