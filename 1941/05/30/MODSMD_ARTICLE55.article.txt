# Farm Plans Swimming Pool for Polio Patients
## 
### FRANCES JAFFER 
A swimming pool for paralysis patients; a course in physical therapy
training, almost unique in the West; a new hospital unit with the very
best in physical therapy equipment—these are all parts of Stanford's new
plans, completed this year, for addition to its Medical School of an in
creasingly important part of modern medicine.

The Medical School is ready to do
its part in defense. Sixty-one of its
faculty members hold commissions
as medical reserve officers in the
United States Army. Dr. Eric Lil
jencranz, Dr. John S. Ranten, Dr.
Edmund P. Gaynor, and Dr. Gor
don F. Helsey are already in serv
ice.
BACTERIOLOGY
In the bacteriology department,
research has been going on in many
different and varied directions. Dr.
Schultz, head of the department,
has been continuing his work on in
fantile paralysis. He has been in
vestigating particularly the damage
done to the nervous cells in the
course of the dreaded disease.
Dr. Clifton has been studying the
metabolism of the tetanus and botu
linus organisms. Tetanus caused
lockjaw in men, and botulinus is a
fruit poison. He has discovered th;«t
their metabolism is very much like
that of the familiar yeast. Dr. Clif
ton, aided by Mr. Picket, has demon
strated quantitatively some of the
products that are formed.
T.B. SUGARS
Dr. Raffcl has been doing some
work on the sugars of the tuber
culosis germ, the tubercle bacillus.
He has also discovered that the
chemical nature of antibodies is
different in different animals. This
may be of importance in medical
treatment with serums in the fu
ture.
Dr. Markee, of the anatomy de
partment, has done important work
in transplanting uterine tissue into
the eye of a monkey and thus being
able to observe the day-by-day
behavior of its reproductive cycle,
which is similar to that of humans.

research has been going on in many
different and varied directions. Dr.
Schultz, head of the department,
has been continuing his work on in
fantile paralysis. He has been in
vestigating particularly the damage
done to the nervous cells in the
course of the dreaded disease.
Dr. Clifton has been studying the
metabolism of the tetanus and botu
linus organisms. Tetanus caused
lockjaw in men, and botulinus is a
fruit poison. He has discovered th;«t
their metabolism is very much like
that of the familiar yeast. Dr. Clif
ton, aided by Mr. Picket, has demon
strated quantitatively some of the
products that are formed.
T.B. SUGARS
Dr. Raffcl has been doing some
work on the sugars of the tuber
culosis germ, the tubercle bacillus.
He has also discovered that the
chemical nature of antibodies is
different in different animals. This
may be of importance in medical
treatment with serums in the fu
ture.
Dr. Markee, of the anatomy de
partment, has done important work
in transplanting uterine tissue into
the eye of a monkey and thus being
able to observe the day-by-day
behavior of its reproductive cycle,
which is similar to that of humans.
A swimming pool for paralysis patients; a course in physical therapy
training, almost unique in the West; a new hospital unit with the very
best in physical therapy equipment—these are all parts of Stanford's new
plans, completed this year, for addition to its Medical School of an in
creasingly important part of modern medicine.

The Medical School is ready to do
its part in defense. Sixty-one of its
faculty members hold commissions
as medical reserve officers in the
United States Army. Dr. Eric Lil
jencranz, Dr. John S. Ranten, Dr.
Edmund P. Gaynor, and Dr. Gor
don F. Helsey are already in serv
ice.
