# Illegal Rushing Hits Sororities
## Five Houses Given Penalties by Panhell 
### 
This year's sorority rushing sea
son was marred by charges of ille
ral contact brought against five of
Stanford's nine sororities on the
day of pledging.
Alpha Phi, Gamma Phi, Kappa,
Theta, and Pi Phi were accused of
having contacted rushees during
the period of formal rushing. As
punishment, these houses were
asked to sacrifice as pledges those
freshmen who had been involved
in the contact and were denied the
privilege of having any social func
tions for a full quarter.
SPECIAL COMMITTEE
The penalty was inflicted by a
special committee consisting of Peg
gy Stanfield, president of Panhel
lenic, two other senior members of
the Council,, and representatives
from San Francisco's Alumnae
Council.
This did not seem to influence
freshman women, however, for 97
of them trekked up the Pow on
Jan. 18 to become the Greek letter
contingent of the of '44. This
was two less than in 1940.
KAPPAS LEAD
Kappa led the list with 15 new
women pledged. Next came Delta
Gamma with 14, and Pi Phi placed
third with 13 pledges.
Since formal rushing, over 20 girls
have been taken as post pledges.
At Panhellenic elections, held two
weeks ago, Barbara Rapp, Alpha Phi,
was elected president. Vice-presi
dent and secretary for the coming
year are Dot Adams, Tri-Delta, and
Jean Allen, Kappa.
