# Last Football Season Held Farm's Best

### DON SELBY 
"It's the same old story, but it's
new to me."
Yes, the rags to riches tale of
Stanford football—the yarn of how,
in one year, Clark Daniel Shaugh
nessy turned an outfit that had won
i nly cne game in 1939 into an un
defeated team in 1940—is getting to
1 e an old and worn story. But to
l oters of the Cardinal and White
it'll always he a story that will hear
tt iling time and again.
When Coach Shaughnessy, fresh
from several disastrous seasons at
the University of Chicago, took over
Stanford's football destiny with
s ring practice a year ago, Pacific
Coast football fans—and especially
those around the Bay area — knew
that something was brewing down
on the Farm.
But little did they suspect that
Shaughnessy and his victory-starved
crew were going to turn into a win
m:id outfit that just wouldn't be de
feated. And when the first game
rolled around early last fall, prac
tically no one—not even the team
members — figured the Indians had
more than an outside chance for
victory. So what did the Shaugh
ne.:symen do but tear into a highly
toi'.ted U.S.F. eleven and come out
on the long end of a 27-0 score.
ONLY THE BEGINNING
That was just the beginning. With
linemen working like beavers in
every contest and a different back
doing the majority of ground-gain
ing in almost each game, the Big
Red Machine rolled on and on,
smothering team after team in its
palh. First conference eleven to
fall by the Indians' axe was the
University of Oregon, by a 13-0
covnt.
Then it was Santa Clara (7-6),
Washington State (26-14), U.S.C.
(21-7), U.C.L.A. (20-14), Washing
tor (20-10), and Oregon State (24-
14).
BIG GAME TOPS
Having whipped through the con
ference competition with compara
tively few threats to their suprem
acy, the Indians went into the Big
Ga:ne decided favorites.
"The Chief" Norm Standlee, al
though suffering from a leg injury,
was still the leader. Although he
couldn't play his usual spectacular
game, he led the Indians to a 13-7
victory over the Bears, Stanford's
first since the Vow Boys graduated
after the 1935 season. And for the
fir: t time in five long years, the
coveted Stanford Axe returned to
the Farm.
ROSE BOWL AHEAD
When Stanford defeated the Uni
versity of Washington gridders they
knocked out of their path the last
thi eat to a Hose Bowl bid for
Shaughnessy and his crew, for there
wnsn't another team in the confer
ence that could even come close to
matching Stanford's record.
And after the Cal victory the In
dians settled down to a little work
for the most publicized football
game of the year—the Rose Bowl
game in Pasadena on January 1,
1941. The team chosen to oppose
them was the University of Ne
braska Cornhuskers, an outfit that
had only been defeated by the great
University of Minnesota eleven.
PASADENA SPECTACLE
There have been great Rose Bowl
g.imes played before. There is no
doubt of that. But there also is no
doubt that the Stanford - Nebraska
contest before 92.000 .spectators on
the first day of this year will go
down as one of the greatest in
history.
That Nebraska had a great team
was evidenced early in the game
when the Cornhuskers powered
downfield for the game's opening
touchdown. But anyone who had
seen the Indians in action through
out the regular season felt—knew—
that one touchdown wasn't enough
to defeat this gang of gridders that
Clark Shaughnessy had brought
through an undefeated seaso)
THREE TOUCHDOWNS
With Hugh Gallarneau plowing
over for two touchdowns, one on a
short slash over tackle and another
on a long pass from Frankie Albert,
and Pete Kmetovic scoring once on
a beautiful 45-yard runback of a
Comhusker punt, the Indians showed
the Rose Bowl fans why they had
been the top-ranking team on the
Pacific Coast and one of the best in
the nation. The final score was
Stanford 21, Nebraska 13.
It was a great year. There is no
doubt about that. It was the first
undefeated season a Stanford foot
ball team had had since 1905. But
from the looks of things, it is fairly
possible that it won't be the last one
for an equal number of years to
come.
STANFORD STARS
How about stars on the Stanford
team? There were all kinds of
them. As is usually the case, the
backs gained most of the glory dur
ing the season, with Frankie Albert,
Stanford's great little quarterback,
making several All-America teams
while Hugh Gallarneau made the
N.E.A. mythical eleven.
But the other men on the team
were stars in their own right. Pete
Kmetovic, Norm Standlee, Stan
GrafT. Fred Myer, Bruno Banducci.
Chuck Taylor, Ed Stamm, Rod War
neke, Ken Robesky, Vic Lindskog,
Milt Vucinich, Jack Francis. Dick
Palmer and many others were tops.
