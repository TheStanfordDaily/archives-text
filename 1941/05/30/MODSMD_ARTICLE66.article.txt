# '42 Track Season Prospects Black with Loss of 16 Stars
## 
### 
If this year's track team is not the worst in Stanford's history, it's be
cause next year's will be, unless something unforeseen happens between
now and next spring.
This year's squad is what was left after 11 of the best men 011 last
year's team graduated. Next year's team will consist of what is left after

>16 of this year's top performers
leave plus the frosh team alter the
Atherton scourge.
If injuries and bad weather dog
Coach Pitch Johnson as they have
! this year, it will be surprising if he
| has any team at all.
WIN TWO MEETS
In retrospect, this season's outfit
won two dual meets while losing
four. They have competed in two
relay meets and the Pacific A.A.U.
championships plus the Compton In
vitational, June 6; the Big Ten-
P.C.C. meet in Los Angeles, June
j 14, and the N.C.A.A. here, June 20-
21, round out the 1941 schedule.
After the Fresno dual meet was |
rained out, the Indians took on the i
California Bear in a relay meet !
which they lost 41-19. Within a |
week's time they won from San Jose, |
i but lost to the Olympic Club. A
victory over U.C.L.A. in Los An
geles came as a prelude to succes
sive defeats by California and
Southern California.
