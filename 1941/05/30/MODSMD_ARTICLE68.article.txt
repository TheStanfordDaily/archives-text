# Baseball Team Promises Cood Season for '42
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stnn f crd can produce a winning
bH'-rloll tea-i next year.
Though the Redskin nine closed
its '41 season only one jump ahead
cf the cellar-riding Bruins, they
r *racked out :i total of 120 hits in
12 games or an average of 10 per
game—which would he a winning
margin to most teams.
The Indians had preater chance
this year to lick their bitterest rival,
~"sli!ormr> but errors in the pinches
and tough decisions gave the Bears
another clean sweep in the annual
three-game series.
COOTIE' TOPS
Stanford had "Cootie" Thompson,
good enough to sign a contract with
'he F/iUywood Stars, of the Pacific
Coast League, but not good enough
— seems unbelievable —to win a
baseball game from the doughty
Berkeleyites. With Thompson gone,
and also Claude Purkitt, first man
of the Card relief corps, the In
dians must depend on the hurling
of Russ Smith, Phil Wolf, and Don
Pendergrass, up from Coach Harry
Shiokey's frosh aggregation.
Thompson was a great hitting
Ditcher, as is Smith. Pendergrass,
by his magnificent showing on the
Papoose hurling ranks this year in
both departments, is destined to
continue the line of hurlers that do
well at the plate.
CATCHER FORECAST
Of catchers, there are Ace Hanlon,
Jack Randall, Herb Atkinson, and
Ward Walkun. Randall took over
backstop duties when Hnnlon in
jured his leg sliding early in the sea
son and did right well behind the
platter. Hanlon was hitting in the
practice games, but fell far below
his early performance when the
league started. Atkinson did not
pity enough to give any indication
of what he can do. Walkup is up
from the frosh.
Coach Harry Wolter put a hustling
ball club on the field, but the only
time they hustled, as indicated by
the final outcome of the league, was
against U.C.L.A. The Indians feHed
poor Bruin three times. Against St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, the only
other teams Stanford beat during the
year, the squad came out to slug out
wins over the Gaels and Broncos as
they pleased.
CARUSO HITS
Boch Caruso topped the hitting
for the Cards. Elected captain for
next season, Caruso is a smooth
olaying second baseman who carr
hit in the clutch. Forming the*
other half of the keystone combina
tion was Monte Pfyl, whose playing
days are over and for whom Wolter
must find a substitute.
Ray Hammett at first base will be
back for another cra,ck at the na
tional pastime when it rolls around
again next spring but lost to the
squad is Elton Boone, third base,
who came out of a batting slump to
close the season's effort with .245.
In the outfield Wolter still has
plenty of men—Alec Cereghino, fin
ishing with .255; Hal Costello, at
.291; Clark Graham, .182; Carl
Kellenherger, .188; and Jack Par
sons, who only got into three games,
finishing with a .400 clip.
A host of potential material comes
up from the frosh: John Brooke,
slugging outfielder; Ted Nell, also a
big-sticker with the Papooses; Harry
Reichling, speedy shortstop; Dick
Middleton, Colin MacKay, and Ed
Washburne.

COOTIE' TOPS
Stanford had "Cootie" Thompson,
good enough to sign a contract with
'he F/iUywood Stars, of the Pacific
Coast League, but not good enough
— seems unbelievable —to win a
baseball game from the doughty
Berkeleyites. With Thompson gone,
and also Claude Purkitt, first man
of the Card relief corps, the In
dians must depend on the hurling
of Russ Smith, Phil Wolf, and Don
Pendergrass, up from Coach Harry
Shiokey's frosh aggregation.
Thompson was a great hitting
Ditcher, as is Smith. Pendergrass,
by his magnificent showing on the
Papoose hurling ranks this year in
both departments, is destined to
continue the line of hurlers that do
well at the plate.
CATCHER FORECAST
Of catchers, there are Ace Hanlon,
Jack Randall, Herb Atkinson, and
Ward Walkun. Randall took over
backstop duties when Hnnlon in
jured his leg sliding early in the sea
son and did right well behind the
platter. Hanlon was hitting in the
practice games, but fell far below
his early performance when the
league started. Atkinson did not
pity enough to give any indication
of what he can do. Walkup is up
from the frosh.
Coach Harry Wolter put a hustling
ball club on the field, but the only
time they hustled, as indicated by
the final outcome of the league, was
against U.C.L.A. The Indians feHed
poor Bruin three times. Against St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, the only
other teams Stanford beat during the
year, the squad came out to slug out
wins over the Gaels and Broncos as
they pleased.
CARUSO HITS
Boch Caruso topped the hitting
for the Cards. Elected captain for
next season, Caruso is a smooth
olaying second baseman who carr
hit in the clutch. Forming the*
other half of the keystone combina
tion was Monte Pfyl, whose playing
days are over and for whom Wolter
must find a substitute.
Ray Hammett at first base will be
back for another cra,ck at the na
tional pastime when it rolls around
again next spring but lost to the
squad is Elton Boone, third base,
who came out of a batting slump to
close the season's effort with .245.
In the outfield Wolter still has
plenty of men—Alec Cereghino, fin
ishing with .255; Hal Costello, at
.291; Clark Graham, .182; Carl
Kellenherger, .188; and Jack Par
sons, who only got into three games,
finishing with a .400 clip.
A host of potential material comes
up from the frosh: John Brooke,
slugging outfielder; Ted Nell, also a
big-sticker with the Papooses; Harry
Reichling, speedy shortstop; Dick
Middleton, Colin MacKay, and Ed
Washburne.
