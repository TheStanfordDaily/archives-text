# Indian Cagers Win 21, Lose 3 To Cop Division Championship
## 
### 
Winning 21 games and losing but
j three, the Stanford basketball team
this year swept through a success
ful season and annexed the Southern
Division crown of the Pacific Coast
Conference. The Indians then pro
ceeded to travel to Pulhnan, where
they met Washington State and
dropped two quick games for their
only serious setback. The Cougars
went on to the National Tourna
ment only to lose to Wisconsin in
the finals for the collegiate title.
In the conference race, the Card
cagers dropped only two games, one
to Cal and the other to the Bruins
of U.C.L.A. Of the eleven non
conference games on the schedule,
the record was even more impres
sive for the casabamen lost but
one game out of eleven—to Indiana
(30-59 in an overtime set-to.
As to statistics for the season,
the Deanmen rolled up 1124 points
to the opposition's 927. Co-Captain
1 Don Williams scored 248 points to
j lead the squad with Don Burness
i and Kenny Davidson following close
I behind with 182 and 180 points re
spectively. Bill Cowden led the
('squad with 35 out of 54 attempts at
the free throw line and also held
the foul record by committing 58
misdemeaners.
; ALL-CONFERENCE TEAM
One of the season's most amazing
j happenings was in the selection of
j the All-Southern basketball team.
The selectors, Coaches "Nibs"
! Price, Everett Dean, Sam Barry and
! Wilbur Johns, chose a first team
composed entirely of Stanford play
ers. Ken Davidson at guard and
Don Burness at center were unani
mous choices for their posts while
Anderson and Williams at the for
ward spots and Bill Cowden at the
| other guard position followed close
behind. Last year not a single Stan
ford man was honored.
Prospects for next year appear to
bs excellent, for only two men will
be lost from this year's starting five,
Donnie Williams and Kenny Da
! vidson being the stalwarts. Other

letter men lost from the squad were
'"Big Dick" Taylor, Bob
Wensel, and Bob Penn who had
another year of eligibility but Tor- !
sook college for national defense.
NEXT YEAR
Back next year arc Fordy Ander- j
son, Bill Cowden, and Don Bur
ness, lettermen, and Fred Linari, Ed j
Voss, John Alltucker, Jack Dana, I
Tiff Denton, Leo McCaffrey, Chuck
Smith and John Eikelman from last
season's squad.
Several good prospects up from
last year's freshman squad will also
make their bid next fall. Jim j
Pollard, skyscraper-high scorer who i
led the frosh to a very successful j
season, including two out of three ;
in the annual series with the Bear
Cubs, has been doing yeoman work
in the spring drills and in the last j
scrimmage swished' through three
buckets in the brief time he ap- j
peared.
MOKE FROSH
Other frosh who will make them
selves heard from in Ihe next three
years to come are Bill Hooper, Bob
"Stork" Wreisner, Dick West,
"Bones" Halstead and Dick Middie
ton, to name a few of them.
Also making their bid for the var
sity are several holdovers from the
frosh squad of a year previous, in
cluding Bruce Howard and Dick
Ncfdiern. Tom Fuller, junior
transfer, practiced with the squad j
all last season but did not see ac
tion. With all the experience he
gained last year and with further (
tutelage this spring and next fall
he should develop into a very ca- I
pable guard.

be lost from this year's starting five,
Donnie Williams and Kenny Da
! vidson being the stalwarts. Other

letter men lost from the squad were
'"Big Dick" Taylor, Bob
Wensel, and Bob Penn who had
another year of eligibility but Tor- !
sook college for national defense.
NEXT YEAR
Back next year arc Fordy Ander- j
son, Bill Cowden, and Don Bur
ness, lettermen, and Fred Linari, Ed j
Voss, John Alltucker, Jack Dana, I
Tiff Denton, Leo McCaffrey, Chuck
Smith and John Eikelman from last
season's squad.
Several good prospects up from
last year's freshman squad will also
make their bid next fall. Jim j
Pollard, skyscraper-high scorer who i
led the frosh to a very successful j
season, including two out of three ;
in the annual series with the Bear
Cubs, has been doing yeoman work
in the spring drills and in the last j
scrimmage swished' through three
buckets in the brief time he ap- j
peared.
MOKE FROSH
Other frosh who will make them
selves heard from in Ihe next three
years to come are Bill Hooper, Bob
"Stork" Wreisner, Dick West,
"Bones" Halstead and Dick Middie
ton, to name a few of them.
Also making their bid for the var
sity are several holdovers from the
frosh squad of a year previous, in
cluding Bruce Howard and Dick
Ncfdiern. Tom Fuller, junior
transfer, practiced with the squad j
all last season but did not see ac
tion. With all the experience he
gained last year and with further (
tutelage this spring and next fall
he should develop into a very ca- I
pable guard.
Winning 21 games and losing but
j three, the Stanford basketball team
this year swept through a success
ful season and annexed the Southern
Division crown of the Pacific Coast
Conference. The Indians then pro
ceeded to travel to Pulhnan, where
they met Washington State and
dropped two quick games for their
only serious setback. The Cougars
went on to the National Tourna
ment only to lose to Wisconsin in
the finals for the collegiate title.
In the conference race, the Card
cagers dropped only two games, one
to Cal and the other to the Bruins
of U.C.L.A. Of the eleven non
conference games on the schedule,
the record was even more impres
sive for the casabamen lost but
one game out of eleven—to Indiana
(30-59 in an overtime set-to.
As to statistics for the season,
the Deanmen rolled up 1124 points
to the opposition's 927. Co-Captain
1 Don Williams scored 248 points to
j lead the squad with Don Burness
i and Kenny Davidson following close
I behind with 182 and 180 points re
spectively. Bill Cowden led the
('squad with 35 out of 54 attempts at
the free throw line and also held
the foul record by committing 58
misdemeaners.
; ALL-CONFERENCE TEAM
One of the season's most amazing
j happenings was in the selection of
j the All-Southern basketball team.
The selectors, Coaches "Nibs"
! Price, Everett Dean, Sam Barry and

composed entirely of Stanford play
ers. Ken Davidson at guard and
Don Burness at center were unani
mous choices for their posts while

dropped two quick games for their
only serious setback. The Cougars
went on to the National Tourna
ment only to lose to Wisconsin in
the finals for the collegiate title.
In the conference race, the Card
cagers dropped only two games, one
to Cal and the other to the Bruins
of U.C.L.A. Of the eleven non
conference games on the schedule,
the record was even more impres
sive for the casabamen lost but
one game out of eleven—to Indiana
(30-59 in an overtime set-to.
As to statistics for the season,
the Deanmen rolled up 1124 points
to the opposition's 927. Co-Captain
1 Don Williams scored 248 points to
j lead the squad with Don Burness
i and Kenny Davidson following close
I behind with 182 and 180 points re
spectively. Bill Cowden led the
('squad with 35 out of 54 attempts at
the free throw line and also held
the foul record by committing 58
misdemeaners.
; ALL-CONFERENCE TEAM
One of the season's most amazing
j happenings was in the selection of
j the All-Southern basketball team.
The selectors, Coaches "Nibs"
! Price, Everett Dean, Sam Barry and
! Wilbur Johns, chose a first team
composed entirely of Stanford play
ers. Ken Davidson at guard and
Don Burness at center were unani
mous choices for their posts while
Anderson and Williams at the for
ward spots and Bill Cowden at the
| other guard position followed close
behind. Last year not a single Stan
ford man was honored.
Prospects for next year appear to
bs excellent, for only two men will
be lost from this year's starting five,
Donnie Williams and Kenny Da
! vidson being the stalwarts. Other

letter men lost from the squad were
'"Big Dick" Taylor, Bob
Wensel, and Bob Penn who had
another year of eligibility but Tor- !
sook college for national defense.
NEXT YEAR
Back next year arc Fordy Ander- j
son, Bill Cowden, and Don Bur
ness, lettermen, and Fred Linari, Ed j
Voss, John Alltucker, Jack Dana, I
Tiff Denton, Leo McCaffrey, Chuck
Smith and John Eikelman from last
season's squad.
Several good prospects up from
last year's freshman squad will also
make their bid next fall. Jim j
Pollard, skyscraper-high scorer who i
led the frosh to a very successful j
season, including two out of three ;
in the annual series with the Bear
Cubs, has been doing yeoman work
in the spring drills and in the last j
scrimmage swished' through three
buckets in the brief time he ap- j
peared.
MOKE FROSH
Other frosh who will make them
selves heard from in Ihe next three
years to come are Bill Hooper, Bob
"Stork" Wreisner, Dick West,
"Bones" Halstead and Dick Middie
ton, to name a few of them.
Also making their bid for the var
sity are several holdovers from the
frosh squad of a year previous, in
cluding Bruce Howard and Dick
Ncfdiern. Tom Fuller, junior
transfer, practiced with the squad j
all last season but did not see ac
tion. With all the experience he
gained last year and with further (
tutelage this spring and next fall
he should develop into a very ca- I
pable guard.
