# Minor Sports Have Fair Year
## 
### 
Following is a resume of a few of
the more important minor sports of
the lest yev.r.
Stanford's mighty rugby men
were by far the best on the Coast
and possibly the best in the country.
Men like Kmetovic and Albert on
the team made it mighty hard for
anyone to stop the Indians. The
rugbymen won every game they
played.
The soccer team had a successful
reason excluding the fact that Cal
nosed them out 2-1. The reason for
this was mainly because Coach
Harry Maloney was unable to pre
sent at the game. Outside of the
Cal loss and one lie, the team turned
in a record of six wins. Co-captains
were George LaNicca and George
Dole.
The water-poloists, under the
coaching of Nort Thornton, took
third in the Conference due to a (5-3
drubbing at the hands of Cal. Roy
Vitousek, Bill Weeden and Bruce
Jessup are only a few of the players
ihat are going to be missed badly
next year.
The boxing team under Coach
Clayton Frye fared pretty badly.

Outstanding were Captain Turn \T;\p
Michal, welterweight, and Jet n
Ward, heavyweight. The pugilists
were defeated by a superior Cal
gregation.
Hard luck kids is just another wa\
of saying the Stanford varsity swim
â€¢ning team. For this outfit, composed
of some of the best swimmt's in
the country, seemed to place them
selves in the path of misfortune
every team they began to hot.
They won a total of ei;.;ht out of
ten meets, losing to only tl e Olym
pic Club and Cal.
