### CHUCK SMITH 
SO IT GOES. Here I am at the end of the trail already—my last
Slants. Looking back on it all, I feel it was a lot of fun filling this |
column almost every day with a lot of guff and that this volume has gone i
entirely too quickly.
At all times I have been ultra-conservative, maybe even too close
to the ground. There hasn't been an awful lot of flag waving in this
department though the temptation has always been there.
For instance, I could have screamed "murder" for at least 12 inches
after the Atherton affair—could have condemned him and made mar
tyrs <;ut of the eight Stanford freshmen who fell beneath his ruthless
axe.
And there certainly is evil that should be brought to the surface in the
system of Ihe Pacific Coast Conference to counteract any charees of
professionalized athletics. The theory is certainly O.K. but in practice
the punishment is being doled out to the wrong guys, the athletes.
A person has to remember that Atherton and Co. and ihe job they are
trying to do for the Pacific Coast Conference are still in the experimental
stage and are bound to have some growing pains.
And after all, f felt that most of the other members of the confer
ence and every sports writer on the Coast did enough popping off and
meaning about the affair. Stanford, on the whole, took it in a digni
fied and gentlemanly manner.
»!» * «(«
THERE were subjects close to home that could have been cam- j
paigned about. For instance, the track situation in general and Coach j
Pitch Johnson in particular.
I feel that Johnson is definitely to be blamed for trying to entirely
change methods of training and the relations between trackmen and their
coach in one short year.
And the tracksters, themselves, are somewhat in the wrong for not
giving Johnson any semblance of a chrnce to prove his methods. Nat
urally irritated by their coach's determination to have "some changes
made," they made things all the tougher.
Mr. Johnson should and probably has realized by now that he has j
stepped into the shoes formerly worn by two men of remarkable per- I
sonalities, possessed of the ability of maintaining the respect of the boys j
they were coaching as well as getting the very best performances out ol
them—Dink Templeton and Bill Ellington.
And he must remember that Stanford is on the whole a conservative
school —one that takes to a new order grudgingly and slowly. It would
take a man of terrific personal appeal and drive to bring about the changes
in track that Pitch Johnson has been so ambitiously hoping for at Stan
ford.
The only person I can think of who accomplished just such a job
at Stanford with just such abilities is football coach Clark Shaugh
nessy. But to get back to track and the so-called "changes" I have
been raving about and for which Mr. Johnson has been striving.
They have to do with the right trackmen have always had in the past j
of going south a day or two before the team to tend to business matters.
Then there were the arrangements which have always been made in the |
past for a trackster to work out at odd times if business or personal j
matters demanded their presence elsewhere.
And there is the policy of feeling that a trackman is doing the best
he possibly can for the team and himself; encouraging him when
things go wrong; and, above all, believing him when he says he has
run what has been prescribed for him in practice.

r TWO ITEMS, the "Atherton affair" and the "track situaton," j
are the only ones that have tempted me to do some beefing and now |
they are off my chest.
Otherwise things on the Farm's athletic front have been very rosy and
will be even rosier next year. I envy Don Selby, appointed sports editor 1
for next volume, who will have the opportunity of filling Slants about that I
football team Stanford will have next fall—one that will have just as
much power and razzle-dazzle as this year's eleven.
And there will be another basketball team of smooth working veterans j
which ought to again walk off with the Southern Division crown and j
might go even farther than did this season's outfit of all-All-Coast players.
Baseball, on the showing of a bunch of sophomores this season and the
impressive record of the freshman nine, will take an upswing despite the
loss of the best pitcher in the Coast Conference, Cootie Thompson.
And a wiser Mr. Johnson, aided by a brilliant bunch of frosh trackmen, j
will produce a better track team next spring. The tennis team with a '
host of veterans returning and with the added talent of U.S.C. transfer J
Ted Schroeder, should be another winner for the Farm.
As for the minor sports, soccer will continue to have a tremendous j
squad and be a lot of fun for the players even though next year's team !
might not be as strong as this year's.
A crop of frosh talent will help Nort Thornton build potential cham
pionship water polo and swimming teams. The golf team gives every indi- j
cation of continuing next year its policy of beating Cal, U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
by scores of 25-2 or thereabouts.
Rugby will continue to be the haven of football players who find they
have oothing to do winter and early spring quarters. And the boxing team
will, as usual, not be too strong but will be the delight of Stanford's
peanut eating fans in the Pavilion.

npHAT SEEMS to just about cover the immediate future of Stanford
sports—the past year is handled pretty well elsewhere in this edition. '
All that is left for me are the conventional wishes of good luck to the i
future sports editor, Don Selby—may he have as much fun writing this 1
column as I did.
And there are the sincere thanks I want to give to a sports staff that !
has made things awfully easy for me—to H. D. Thoreau who handled j
track, to Bub Sontag who wrote baseball and spring grid, to Bob Chandler
who shared on spring grid and covered rugby.
Then there are Ferris Boothe who had the tough assignment of re- i
porting on the intramural front, swimming and frosh baseball writer Bob
Hannah, crew writer Ted Cole, tennis writer Ches Saroyan, and golf re- :
porter, golfer Sid Hayes.
And thanks to these others whose odd jobs all contributed to the sports
page, Bill Coughlin, A1 Hampson, Mike Kresge, Hap Everett, Kemp Ben
nett, and Bill Steif.

»!» * «(«
THERE were subjects close to home that could have been cam- j
paigned about. For instance, the track situation in general and Coach j
Pitch Johnson in particular.
I feel that Johnson is definitely to be blamed for trying to entirely
change methods of training and the relations between trackmen and their
coach in one short year.
And the tracksters, themselves, are somewhat in the wrong for not
giving Johnson any semblance of a chrnce to prove his methods. Nat
urally irritated by their coach's determination to have "some changes
made," they made things all the tougher.
Mr. Johnson should and probably has realized by now that he has j
stepped into the shoes formerly worn by two men of remarkable per- I
sonalities, possessed of the ability of maintaining the respect of the boys j
they were coaching as well as getting the very best performances out ol
them—Dink Templeton and Bill Ellington.
And he must remember that Stanford is on the whole a conservative
school —one that takes to a new order grudgingly and slowly. It would
take a man of terrific personal appeal and drive to bring about the changes
in track that Pitch Johnson has been so ambitiously hoping for at Stan
ford.
The only person I can think of who accomplished just such a job
at Stanford with just such abilities is football coach Clark Shaugh
nessy. But to get back to track and the so-called "changes" I have
been raving about and for which Mr. Johnson has been striving.
They have to do with the right trackmen have always had in the past j
of going south a day or two before the team to tend to business matters.
Then there were the arrangements which have always been made in the |
past for a trackster to work out at odd times if business or personal j
matters demanded their presence elsewhere.
And there is the policy of feeling that a trackman is doing the best
he possibly can for the team and himself; encouraging him when
things go wrong; and, above all, believing him when he says he has
run what has been prescribed for him in practice.

r TWO ITEMS, the "Atherton affair" and the "track situaton," j
are the only ones that have tempted me to do some beefing and now |
they are off my chest.
Otherwise things on the Farm's athletic front have been very rosy and
will be even rosier next year. I envy Don Selby, appointed sports editor 1
for next volume, who will have the opportunity of filling Slants about that I
football team Stanford will have next fall—one that will have just as
much power and razzle-dazzle as this year's eleven.
And there will be another basketball team of smooth working veterans j
which ought to again walk off with the Southern Division crown and j
might go even farther than did this season's outfit of all-All-Coast players.
Baseball, on the showing of a bunch of sophomores this season and the
impressive record of the freshman nine, will take an upswing despite the
loss of the best pitcher in the Coast Conference, Cootie Thompson.
And a wiser Mr. Johnson, aided by a brilliant bunch of frosh trackmen, j
will produce a better track team next spring. The tennis team with a '
host of veterans returning and with the added talent of U.S.C. transfer J
Ted Schroeder, should be another winner for the Farm.
As for the minor sports, soccer will continue to have a tremendous j
squad and be a lot of fun for the players even though next year's team !
might not be as strong as this year's.
A crop of frosh talent will help Nort Thornton build potential cham
pionship water polo and swimming teams. The golf team gives every indi- j
cation of continuing next year its policy of beating Cal, U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
by scores of 25-2 or thereabouts.
Rugby will continue to be the haven of football players who find they
have oothing to do winter and early spring quarters. And the boxing team
will, as usual, not be too strong but will be the delight of Stanford's

sports—the past year is handled pretty well elsewhere in this edition. '

At all times I have been ultra-conservative, maybe even too close
to the ground. There hasn't been an awful lot of flag waving in this

axe.
And there certainly is evil that should be brought to the surface in the
system of Ihe Pacific Coast Conference to counteract any charees of
professionalized athletics. The theory is certainly O.K. but in practice
the punishment is being doled out to the wrong guys, the athletes.

school —one that takes to a new order grudgingly and slowly. It would
take a man of terrific personal appeal and drive to bring about the changes
in track that Pitch Johnson has been so ambitiously hoping for at Stan
ford.
The only person I can think of who accomplished just such a job
at Stanford with just such abilities is football coach Clark Shaugh
nessy. But to get back to track and the so-called "changes" I have
been raving about and for which Mr. Johnson has been striving.
They have to do with the right trackmen have always had in the past j
of going south a day or two before the team to tend to business matters.
Then there were the arrangements which have always been made in the |
past for a trackster to work out at odd times if business or personal j
matters demanded their presence elsewhere.
And there is the policy of feeling that a trackman is doing the best
he possibly can for the team and himself; encouraging him when
things go wrong; and, above all, believing him when he says he has
run what has been prescribed for him in practice.

r TWO ITEMS, the "Atherton affair" and the "track situaton," j

loss of the best pitcher in the Coast Conference, Cootie Thompson.
And a wiser Mr. Johnson, aided by a brilliant bunch of frosh trackmen, j
will produce a better track team next spring. The tennis team with a '

Ted Schroeder, should be another winner for the Farm.
As for the minor sports, soccer will continue to have a tremendous j
squad and be a lot of fun for the players even though next year's team !
might not be as strong as this year's.
A crop of frosh talent will help Nort Thornton build potential cham

npHAT SEEMS to just about cover the immediate future of Stanford
sports—the past year is handled pretty well elsewhere in this edition. '
All that is left for me are the conventional wishes of good luck to the i
future sports editor, Don Selby—may he have as much fun writing this 1
column as I did.
And there are the sincere thanks I want to give to a sports staff that !
has made things awfully easy for me—to H. D. Thoreau who handled j
track, to Bub Sontag who wrote baseball and spring grid, to Bob Chandler
who shared on spring grid and covered rugby.
Then there are Ferris Boothe who had the tough assignment of re- i
porting on the intramural front, swimming and frosh baseball writer Bob
Hannah, crew writer Ted Cole, tennis writer Ches Saroyan, and golf re- :
porter, golfer Sid Hayes.

page, Bill Coughlin, A1 Hampson, Mike Kresge, Hap Everett, Kemp Ben

SO IT GOES. Here I am at the end of the trail already—my last
Slants. Looking back on it all, I feel it was a lot of fun filling this |
column almost every day with a lot of guff and that this volume has gone i
entirely too quickly.
At all times I have been ultra-conservative, maybe even too close
to the ground. There hasn't been an awful lot of flag waving in this
department though the temptation has always been there.
For instance, I could have screamed "murder" for at least 12 inches
after the Atherton affair—could have condemned him and made mar
tyrs <;ut of the eight Stanford freshmen who fell beneath his ruthless
axe.
And there certainly is evil that should be brought to the surface in the
system of Ihe Pacific Coast Conference to counteract any charees of
professionalized athletics. The theory is certainly O.K. but in practice
the punishment is being doled out to the wrong guys, the athletes.
A person has to remember that Atherton and Co. and ihe job they are
trying to do for the Pacific Coast Conference are still in the experimental
stage and are bound to have some growing pains.
And after all, f felt that most of the other members of the confer
ence and every sports writer on the Coast did enough popping off and
meaning about the affair. Stanford, on the whole, took it in a digni
fied and gentlemanly manner.
»!» * «(«
THERE were subjects close to home that could have been cam- j
paigned about. For instance, the track situation in general and Coach j
Pitch Johnson in particular.
I feel that Johnson is definitely to be blamed for trying to entirely
change methods of training and the relations between trackmen and their
coach in one short year.
And the tracksters, themselves, are somewhat in the wrong for not
giving Johnson any semblance of a chrnce to prove his methods. Nat
urally irritated by their coach's determination to have "some changes
made," they made things all the tougher.
Mr. Johnson should and probably has realized by now that he has j
stepped into the shoes formerly worn by two men of remarkable per- I
sonalities, possessed of the ability of maintaining the respect of the boys j
they were coaching as well as getting the very best performances out ol
them—Dink Templeton and Bill Ellington.

things go wrong; and, above all, believing him when he says he has
run what has been prescribed for him in practice.

r TWO ITEMS, the "Atherton affair" and the "track situaton," j
are the only ones that have tempted me to do some beefing and now |
they are off my chest.
Otherwise things on the Farm's athletic front have been very rosy and
will be even rosier next year. I envy Don Selby, appointed sports editor 1
for next volume, who will have the opportunity of filling Slants about that I
football team Stanford will have next fall—one that will have just as
much power and razzle-dazzle as this year's eleven.
And there will be another basketball team of smooth working veterans j
which ought to again walk off with the Southern Division crown and j
might go even farther than did this season's outfit of all-All-Coast players.
Baseball, on the showing of a bunch of sophomores this season and the
impressive record of the freshman nine, will take an upswing despite the
loss of the best pitcher in the Coast Conference, Cootie Thompson.
And a wiser Mr. Johnson, aided by a brilliant bunch of frosh trackmen, j
will produce a better track team next spring. The tennis team with a '
host of veterans returning and with the added talent of U.S.C. transfer J
Ted Schroeder, should be another winner for the Farm.
As for the minor sports, soccer will continue to have a tremendous j
squad and be a lot of fun for the players even though next year's team !
might not be as strong as this year's.
A crop of frosh talent will help Nort Thornton build potential cham
pionship water polo and swimming teams. The golf team gives every indi- j
cation of continuing next year its policy of beating Cal, U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
by scores of 25-2 or thereabouts.
Rugby will continue to be the haven of football players who find they
have oothing to do winter and early spring quarters. And the boxing team
will, as usual, not be too strong but will be the delight of Stanford's
peanut eating fans in the Pavilion.

npHAT SEEMS to just about cover the immediate future of Stanford
sports—the past year is handled pretty well elsewhere in this edition. '
All that is left for me are the conventional wishes of good luck to the i
future sports editor, Don Selby—may he have as much fun writing this 1
column as I did.
And there are the sincere thanks I want to give to a sports staff that !
has made things awfully easy for me—to H. D. Thoreau who handled j
track, to Bub Sontag who wrote baseball and spring grid, to Bob Chandler
who shared on spring grid and covered rugby.
Then there are Ferris Boothe who had the tough assignment of re- i
porting on the intramural front, swimming and frosh baseball writer Bob
Hannah, crew writer Ted Cole, tennis writer Ches Saroyan, and golf re- :
porter, golfer Sid Hayes.
And thanks to these others whose odd jobs all contributed to the sports
page, Bill Coughlin, A1 Hampson, Mike Kresge, Hap Everett, Kemp Ben
nett, and Bill Steif.
SO IT GOES. Here I am at the end of the trail already—my last
Slants. Looking back on it all, I feel it was a lot of fun filling this |
column almost every day with a lot of guff and that this volume has gone i
entirely too quickly.
At all times I have been ultra-conservative, maybe even too close
to the ground. There hasn't been an awful lot of flag waving in this
department though the temptation has always been there.
For instance, I could have screamed "murder" for at least 12 inches
after the Atherton affair—could have condemned him and made mar
tyrs <;ut of the eight Stanford freshmen who fell beneath his ruthless
axe.
And there certainly is evil that should be brought to the surface in the
system of Ihe Pacific Coast Conference to counteract any charees of
professionalized athletics. The theory is certainly O.K. but in practice
the punishment is being doled out to the wrong guys, the athletes.
A person has to remember that Atherton and Co. and ihe job they are
trying to do for the Pacific Coast Conference are still in the experimental
stage and are bound to have some growing pains.
And after all, f felt that most of the other members of the confer
ence and every sports writer on the Coast did enough popping off and
meaning about the affair. Stanford, on the whole, took it in a digni
fied and gentlemanly manner.
»!» * «(«
THERE were subjects close to home that could have been cam- j
paigned about. For instance, the track situation in general and Coach j
Pitch Johnson in particular.
I feel that Johnson is definitely to be blamed for trying to entirely
change methods of training and the relations between trackmen and their
coach in one short year.
And the tracksters, themselves, are somewhat in the wrong for not
giving Johnson any semblance of a chrnce to prove his methods. Nat
urally irritated by their coach's determination to have "some changes
made," they made things all the tougher.
Mr. Johnson should and probably has realized by now that he has j
stepped into the shoes formerly worn by two men of remarkable per- I
sonalities, possessed of the ability of maintaining the respect of the boys j
they were coaching as well as getting the very best performances out ol
them—Dink Templeton and Bill Ellington.
And he must remember that Stanford is on the whole a conservative
school —one that takes to a new order grudgingly and slowly. It would
take a man of terrific personal appeal and drive to bring about the changes
in track that Pitch Johnson has been so ambitiously hoping for at Stan
ford.
The only person I can think of who accomplished just such a job
at Stanford with just such abilities is football coach Clark Shaugh
nessy. But to get back to track and the so-called "changes" I have
been raving about and for which Mr. Johnson has been striving.
They have to do with the right trackmen have always had in the past j
of going south a day or two before the team to tend to business matters.
Then there were the arrangements which have always been made in the |
past for a trackster to work out at odd times if business or personal j
matters demanded their presence elsewhere.
And there is the policy of feeling that a trackman is doing the best
he possibly can for the team and himself; encouraging him when
things go wrong; and, above all, believing him when he says he has
run what has been prescribed for him in practice.
