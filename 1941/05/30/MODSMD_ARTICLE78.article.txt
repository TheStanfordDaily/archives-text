# OUR BIG GAME BONFIRE
## 
### 

CELEBRATING STANFORD'S "rags to riches" football team at the
big game bonfire in the Lagunita lakebed last November, Farmerettes
and Roughs climaxed a day of rallies and parades, trekked to Berke
ley the next day to see the Shaughnessy-men ride rough-shod over the
Bear gridiron squad.
