# Farm May Appeal Atherton's Ruling at June P.C.C. Meeting
## 
### 
With the summer meeting of the Pacific Coast Conference coining up
at Seattle June 9 and 10, the rumor is growing stronger that Stanford does
not intend to lake the Atherton ruling of three weeks ago without a
protest or an appeal.
At the time Edwin N. Atherton brought his axe down on the eight

Indian frosh athletes, indignation
ran quite high because of the fact
that the whole thing was extremely
unfair to the boys involved. Now
it appears that Stanford may take
definite action along the lines of ap
pealing the decision.
When he was contacted last night,
Professor W. B. Owens, Stanford's
faculty representative on the Con
fidence, refused to comment on the
possibility of a protest, while Pub
licity Director Don Liebendorfer
said that any official statement
would have to be made by Owens.
FARM HAS A CASE
That Stanford has a case to pre
sent, however, is hardly doubtful,
for even Atherton has declared that
the action he is now forced to take
under the Conference legislation is
grossly unfair to the athletes; for it
is the alumni who are really to
blame for the situation.
The frosh who were hit by the
ruling were Bob Koch, Jim Ellis,
Bill Nourse, Matt Petrlich, Jean
Lamoure, Bill Joslyn, Hal Petrlich,
and Bob Waters. The first seven
were footballers, while Waters is
an outstanding sprinter.
BOYS INNOCENT
The charge against them was that
they were contacted and given
scholarships by alumni organizations
that had no official authorization
by Stanford University. The boys
themselves had nothing to do with
implicating themselves outside of
cn the receiving end of vari
ous offers.
As Bob Koch put it the day after
the Atherton ruling was announced,
"All you have to do to get involved
is to pick a letter out of your mail
box at home. And then they have
you."
All the Papooses decided to ride
out the year o.i the Farm and await
further developments, although most
of them felt that there was little or
no chance of the bars being let down
Lo allow them further competitior
on Stanford athletic teams.
Now, however, it appears that
with the possibility of an oflicia
Stanford protest, their chances oJ
playing some football for Clark
Shaughnessy next fall seem to looir
a little brighter.
