WICHITA, Ksns., May 29 (UP).— :
Night baseball may not be doomed j
j in spite of government talk about
banning flood lights and fancy elec
tric signs to conserve power for j
national defense needs.
Such an emergency wouldn't alter
plans for an opening night of the
national semi-pro baseball tourna
ment here in August.
The boys were going to play with
out lights anyway, Ray Dumont,
president of the National Semi-Pro
Baseball Congress, calmly an
nounced tonight. "We'll play in
total darkness," he said, "but bats,
balls, bases, gloves and foul lines
will be coated with phosphorus. It
j works, because we tried it." "We
planned the stunts as a novelty,"
Dumont added, "but it may be a
j necessity."
