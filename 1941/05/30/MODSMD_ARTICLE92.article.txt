# Dear Charlie:
## 
### 
T A 7-ELL. it's just about over now. It's just a
V V couple of hours more before the final 30 -
mark is dusted over Volume 99.
Volume 100 —that's all yours, Charlie—is still
in the initial ingredient stage. But there'll be a
lot going through the little Green Shack, out to
the back shop, and on the Quad before your
volume is over.
Your volume might very v/ell see America's
entrance into the war tov/ard which we've been
moving so swiftly all this year. The American
public, still stupefied and unbelieving at events
of the past few years, will undoubtedly still be
lagging many steps behind the movements of
state.
One of your biggest tasks, Charlie, will be
keeping Stanford and her students well in
formed on the events of the day. And that s a
tough job to give anyone. Stanford's "ivory
tower," while well on its way toward extinction,
will need a lot more blasting before it is gone.
There are a lot more tasks that I'm leaving
unfinished for you, Charlie. I'd love to be
around when the caucus system is finally dis
solved. And when it goes, the Row-Hall split
will be gone forever. I've seen it diminish and
dwindle during my four years at Stanford, but
I regret that there's still a twinkle of it left at all.
There are a lot more, but you know them all.
You've been sitting on top of Stanford for a
long time. You'll know it a great deal better
when Volume 100 is over—but you've got a
good head start on it now.
You'll find, for one thing, that Stanford's Ad
ministration has given into student hands more
privileges and powers than has almost any
other university. And you'll find that they're
all ready to give you all the help and assistance
that you may need.
Your student body next year will very prob
ably be more than a mite different from this
student body of 1941. The men and women
who are graduating on the 15th of June may be
the last class for many years to leave Stanford
with the same hopes and the same ideals that
they had when they entered.
I hope that Volume 100 will do its darnedest
to tell the campus that the future is only what
each man and woman makes of it—that nothing
is worse than banging one's head against the
wall and completely giving way to pure emo
tional drivel.
You'll be lucky in one extremely important
respect. You'll be working with one of the finest
student bodies that any university can offer.
And the men and women to whom you'll be
talking will be the sort who can understand
and appreciate what you say.
All of us who graduate this year won't take
too long to begin to appreciate what we're
missing. Four thousand persons of the Stanford
sort will be hard to find again after graduation.
I was reading through the Dailies of the past
few years just a short time ago. One of the
editors of three or four years back, in writing
his final editorial, expressed the depression
which comes with putting out a "bulletin board"
rather than a newspaper. The Daily's changed
a lot since then. And The Daily hasn't been
achieving national recognition as one of the few
really top-notch collegiate newspapers without
real zest and newspaper ability.
The staff you'll have working with you next
year has everything an editor could want.
You'll have Bud and Romie as your top edit
board members, and it'll be hard to find any- i
thing they can't do. Shaf and Bruck will be as -
swell a team of associates as any of us have
seen for a long time.
One tip for you, Charlie. The backbone of
the staff in the last analysis are the kids who
pound the beats and write the heads on desk.
Don't make the mistake of forgetting that
You'll find that your staff is mighty deep down
in the lower brackets. Forgetting that may
mean forgetting the most important factor we've
built up around the Shack.

Yes, you ve got a fine staff, all the way down
the line, to work with. But you'll be missing
some of the gang that are leaving with Vol
ume 99.
Most of the gang has been in and out of the j

ollice while this edit is in the final throes of
composition. And it's tough to see them go.
A special note of love for Janny, who's been
the best man on the staff since Volume 99
began. And another for Marge, who's com
bined those two invaluable attributes without
which no women's editor can be perfect—being
efficient and highly ornamental at the same
time.
There are lots more. Juddie, who's carried
the load of top night editor during lots of tough
sieges with never a murmur. And Ed, who
made an alternate night editor's job mean some
thing for the first time.
Chuck Smith, who won't be with us next
year, turned from a dark hoise into one of the
finest and keenest sports editors of the age.
Thanks, Chukker.
It's hard to figure what the Shack will be like
without Reed, who combined a genuine love of
photography with talent and an ability to keep
everyone happy. We love him dearly.
Blackie and Mitch, both doubly close through
their business staff leadership and their affilia
tion, have done the sort of job that makes for
close co-operation and real friendship. The
days of business staff-edit staff rivalries are
over.
Jerry and Hutch are a pair that I can't see
leave without real regret. They are a duet of
real newspaper men and real leaders. They
made The Daily for four years. Clarence, Mary
Etta and Mary June can't be replaced without
a lot of thinking—and do the same for Audrey
and Rose, those inseparables both on the Quad
and in The Daily.
There are more than 50 other members of
the staff who deserve personal attention and
mention, Charlie, but you'll have the chance to
work with them for the entirety of Volume 100.
And you'll appreciate the swell bunch that they
are.
I have, and will for a long time.

One of your biggest tasks, Charlie, will be
keeping Stanford and her students well in
formed on the events of the day. And that s a
tough job to give anyone. Stanford's "ivory
tower," while well on its way toward extinction,
will need a lot more blasting before it is gone.
There are a lot more tasks that I'm leaving
unfinished for you, Charlie. I'd love to be
around when the caucus system is finally dis
solved. And when it goes, the Row-Hall split
will be gone forever. I've seen it diminish and
dwindle during my four years at Stanford, but
I regret that there's still a twinkle of it left at all.
There are a lot more, but you know them all.
You've been sitting on top of Stanford for a
long time. You'll know it a great deal better
when Volume 100 is over—but you've got a
good head start on it now.
You'll find, for one thing, that Stanford's Ad
ministration has given into student hands more
privileges and powers than has almost any
other university. And you'll find that they're
all ready to give you all the help and assistance
that you may need.
Your student body next year will very prob
ably be more than a mite different from this
student body of 1941. The men and women
who are graduating on the 15th of June may be
the last class for many years to leave Stanford
with the same hopes and the same ideals that
they had when they entered.
I hope that Volume 100 will do its darnedest
to tell the campus that the future is only what
each man and woman makes of it—that nothing
is worse than banging one's head against the
wall and completely giving way to pure emo
tional drivel.
You'll be lucky in one extremely important
respect. You'll be working with one of the finest
student bodies that any university can offer.
And the men and women to whom you'll be
talking will be the sort who can understand
and appreciate what you say.
All of us who graduate this year won't take
too long to begin to appreciate what we're
missing. Four thousand persons of the Stanford
sort will be hard to find again after graduation.
I was reading through the Dailies of the past
few years just a short time ago. One of the
editors of three or four years back, in writing
his final editorial, expressed the depression
which comes with putting out a "bulletin board"
rather than a newspaper. The Daily's changed
a lot since then. And The Daily hasn't been
achieving national recognition as one of the few
really top-notch collegiate newspapers without
real zest and newspaper ability.
The staff you'll have working with you next
year has everything an editor could want.
You'll have Bud and Romie as your top edit
board members, and it'll be hard to find any- i
thing they can't do. Shaf and Bruck will be as -
swell a team of associates as any of us have
seen for a long time.
One tip for you, Charlie. The backbone of
the staff in the last analysis are the kids who
pound the beats and write the heads on desk.
Don't make the mistake of forgetting that
You'll find that your staff is mighty deep down
in the lower brackets. Forgetting that may
mean forgetting the most important factor we've
built up around the Shack.

Yes, you ve got a fine staff, all the way down
the line, to work with. But you'll be missing
some of the gang that are leaving with Vol
ume 99.
Most of the gang has been in and out of the j

ollice while this edit is in the final throes of
composition. And it's tough to see them go.
A special note of love for Janny, who's been
the best man on the staff since Volume 99
began. And another for Marge, who's com
bined those two invaluable attributes without
which no women's editor can be perfect—being
efficient and highly ornamental at the same
time.
There are lots more. Juddie, who's carried
the load of top night editor during lots of tough
sieges with never a murmur. And Ed, who
made an alternate night editor's job mean some
thing for the first time.
Chuck Smith, who won't be with us next
year, turned from a dark hoise into one of the
finest and keenest sports editors of the age.
Thanks, Chukker.
It's hard to figure what the Shack will be like
without Reed, who combined a genuine love of
photography with talent and an ability to keep
everyone happy. We love him dearly.
Blackie and Mitch, both doubly close through
their business staff leadership and their affilia
tion, have done the sort of job that makes for
close co-operation and real friendship. The
days of business staff-edit staff rivalries are
over.
Jerry and Hutch are a pair that I can't see
leave without real regret. They are a duet of
real newspaper men and real leaders. They
made The Daily for four years. Clarence, Mary
Etta and Mary June can't be replaced without
a lot of thinking—and do the same for Audrey
and Rose, those inseparables both on the Quad
and in The Daily.
There are more than 50 other members of
the staff who deserve personal attention and
mention, Charlie, but you'll have the chance to
work with them for the entirety of Volume 100.
And you'll appreciate the swell bunch that they
are.
I have, and will for a long time.
T A 7-ELL. it's just about over now. It's just a
V V couple of hours more before the final 30 -
mark is dusted over Volume 99.
Volume 100 —that's all yours, Charlie—is still
in the initial ingredient stage. But there'll be a
lot going through the little Green Shack, out to
the back shop, and on the Quad before your
volume is over.
Your volume might very v/ell see America's
entrance into the war tov/ard which we've been
moving so swiftly all this year. The American
public, still stupefied and unbelieving at events
of the past few years, will undoubtedly still be
lagging many steps behind the movements of
state.

You've been sitting on top of Stanford for a
long time. You'll know it a great deal better
when Volume 100 is over—but you've got a
good head start on it now.
You'll find, for one thing, that Stanford's Ad
ministration has given into student hands more
privileges and powers than has almost any
other university. And you'll find that they're
all ready to give you all the help and assistance
that you may need.
Your student body next year will very prob
ably be more than a mite different from this
student body of 1941. The men and women
who are graduating on the 15th of June may be
the last class for many years to leave Stanford
with the same hopes and the same ideals that
they had when they entered.
I hope that Volume 100 will do its darnedest
to tell the campus that the future is only what
each man and woman makes of it—that nothing
is worse than banging one's head against the
wall and completely giving way to pure emo
tional drivel.
You'll be lucky in one extremely important
respect. You'll be working with one of the finest
student bodies that any university can offer.
And the men and women to whom you'll be
talking will be the sort who can understand
and appreciate what you say.
All of us who graduate this year won't take
too long to begin to appreciate what we're
missing. Four thousand persons of the Stanford
sort will be hard to find again after graduation.
I was reading through the Dailies of the past
few years just a short time ago. One of the
editors of three or four years back, in writing
his final editorial, expressed the depression
which comes with putting out a "bulletin board"
rather than a newspaper. The Daily's changed
a lot since then. And The Daily hasn't been
achieving national recognition as one of the few
really top-notch collegiate newspapers without
real zest and newspaper ability.
The staff you'll have working with you next
year has everything an editor could want.
You'll have Bud and Romie as your top edit
board members, and it'll be hard to find any- i
thing they can't do. Shaf and Bruck will be as -
swell a team of associates as any of us have
seen for a long time.
One tip for you, Charlie. The backbone of
the staff in the last analysis are the kids who
pound the beats and write the heads on desk.
Don't make the mistake of forgetting that
You'll find that your staff is mighty deep down
in the lower brackets. Forgetting that may
mean forgetting the most important factor we've
built up around the Shack.

Yes, you ve got a fine staff, all the way down
the line, to work with. But you'll be missing
some of the gang that are leaving with Vol
ume 99.
Most of the gang has been in and out of the j

ollice while this edit is in the final throes of
composition. And it's tough to see them go.
A special note of love for Janny, who's been
the best man on the staff since Volume 99
began. And another for Marge, who's com
bined those two invaluable attributes without
which no women's editor can be perfect—being
efficient and highly ornamental at the same
time.
There are lots more. Juddie, who's carried
the load of top night editor during lots of tough
sieges with never a murmur. And Ed, who
made an alternate night editor's job mean some
thing for the first time.
Chuck Smith, who won't be with us next
year, turned from a dark hoise into one of the
finest and keenest sports editors of the age.
Thanks, Chukker.
It's hard to figure what the Shack will be like
without Reed, who combined a genuine love of
photography with talent and an ability to keep
everyone happy. We love him dearly.
Blackie and Mitch, both doubly close through
their business staff leadership and their affilia
tion, have done the sort of job that makes for
close co-operation and real friendship. The
days of business staff-edit staff rivalries are
over.
Jerry and Hutch are a pair that I can't see
leave without real regret. They are a duet of
real newspaper men and real leaders. They
made The Daily for four years. Clarence, Mary
Etta and Mary June can't be replaced without
a lot of thinking—and do the same for Audrey
and Rose, those inseparables both on the Quad
and in The Daily.
There are more than 50 other members of
the staff who deserve personal attention and
mention, Charlie, but you'll have the chance to
work with them for the entirety of Volume 100.
And you'll appreciate the swell bunch that they
are.
I have, and will for a long time.
T A 7-ELL. it's just about over now. It's just a
V V couple of hours more before the final 30 -
mark is dusted over Volume 99.
Volume 100 —that's all yours, Charlie—is still
in the initial ingredient stage. But there'll be a
lot going through the little Green Shack, out to
the back shop, and on the Quad before your
volume is over.
Your volume might very v/ell see America's
entrance into the war tov/ard which we've been
moving so swiftly all this year. The American
public, still stupefied and unbelieving at events
of the past few years, will undoubtedly still be
lagging many steps behind the movements of
state.
One of your biggest tasks, Charlie, will be
keeping Stanford and her students well in
formed on the events of the day. And that s a
tough job to give anyone. Stanford's "ivory
tower," while well on its way toward extinction,
will need a lot more blasting before it is gone.
There are a lot more tasks that I'm leaving
unfinished for you, Charlie. I'd love to be
around when the caucus system is finally dis
solved. And when it goes, the Row-Hall split
will be gone forever. I've seen it diminish and
dwindle during my four years at Stanford, but
I regret that there's still a twinkle of it left at all.

the last class for many years to leave Stanford
with the same hopes and the same ideals that
they had when they entered.
I hope that Volume 100 will do its darnedest
to tell the campus that the future is only what
each man and woman makes of it—that nothing
is worse than banging one's head against the
wall and completely giving way to pure emo
tional drivel.
You'll be lucky in one extremely important
respect. You'll be working with one of the finest
student bodies that any university can offer.
And the men and women to whom you'll be
talking will be the sort who can understand
and appreciate what you say.
All of us who graduate this year won't take
too long to begin to appreciate what we're
missing. Four thousand persons of the Stanford
sort will be hard to find again after graduation.
I was reading through the Dailies of the past
few years just a short time ago. One of the
editors of three or four years back, in writing
his final editorial, expressed the depression
which comes with putting out a "bulletin board"
rather than a newspaper. The Daily's changed
a lot since then. And The Daily hasn't been
achieving national recognition as one of the few
really top-notch collegiate newspapers without
real zest and newspaper ability.
The staff you'll have working with you next
year has everything an editor could want.
You'll have Bud and Romie as your top edit
board members, and it'll be hard to find any- i
thing they can't do. Shaf and Bruck will be as -
swell a team of associates as any of us have
seen for a long time.
One tip for you, Charlie. The backbone of
the staff in the last analysis are the kids who
pound the beats and write the heads on desk.
Don't make the mistake of forgetting that
You'll find that your staff is mighty deep down
in the lower brackets. Forgetting that may
mean forgetting the most important factor we've
built up around the Shack.

Yes, you ve got a fine staff, all the way down
the line, to work with. But you'll be missing
some of the gang that are leaving with Vol
ume 99.
Most of the gang has been in and out of the j

ollice while this edit is in the final throes of
composition. And it's tough to see them go.
A special note of love for Janny, who's been
the best man on the staff since Volume 99
began. And another for Marge, who's com
bined those two invaluable attributes without
which no women's editor can be perfect—being
efficient and highly ornamental at the same
time.
There are lots more. Juddie, who's carried
the load of top night editor during lots of tough
sieges with never a murmur. And Ed, who
made an alternate night editor's job mean some
thing for the first time.
Chuck Smith, who won't be with us next
year, turned from a dark hoise into one of the
finest and keenest sports editors of the age.
Thanks, Chukker.
It's hard to figure what the Shack will be like
without Reed, who combined a genuine love of
photography with talent and an ability to keep
everyone happy. We love him dearly.
Blackie and Mitch, both doubly close through
their business staff leadership and their affilia
tion, have done the sort of job that makes for
close co-operation and real friendship. The
days of business staff-edit staff rivalries are
over.
Jerry and Hutch are a pair that I can't see
leave without real regret. They are a duet of
real newspaper men and real leaders. They
made The Daily for four years. Clarence, Mary
Etta and Mary June can't be replaced without
a lot of thinking—and do the same for Audrey
and Rose, those inseparables both on the Quad
and in The Daily.
There are more than 50 other members of
the staff who deserve personal attention and
mention, Charlie, but you'll have the chance to
work with them for the entirety of Volume 100.
And you'll appreciate the swell bunch that they
are.
I have, and will for a long time.
T A 7-ELL. it's just about over now. It's just a
V V couple of hours more before the final 30 -
mark is dusted over Volume 99.
Volume 100 —that's all yours, Charlie—is still
in the initial ingredient stage. But there'll be a
lot going through the little Green Shack, out to
the back shop, and on the Quad before your
volume is over.
Your volume might very v/ell see America's
entrance into the war tov/ard which we've been
moving so swiftly all this year. The American
public, still stupefied and unbelieving at events
of the past few years, will undoubtedly still be
lagging many steps behind the movements of
state.
One of your biggest tasks, Charlie, will be
keeping Stanford and her students well in
formed on the events of the day. And that s a
tough job to give anyone. Stanford's "ivory
tower," while well on its way toward extinction,
will need a lot more blasting before it is gone.
There are a lot more tasks that I'm leaving
unfinished for you, Charlie. I'd love to be
around when the caucus system is finally dis
solved. And when it goes, the Row-Hall split
will be gone forever. I've seen it diminish and
dwindle during my four years at Stanford, but
I regret that there's still a twinkle of it left at all.
There are a lot more, but you know them all.
You've been sitting on top of Stanford for a
long time. You'll know it a great deal better
when Volume 100 is over—but you've got a
good head start on it now.
You'll find, for one thing, that Stanford's Ad
ministration has given into student hands more
privileges and powers than has almost any
other university. And you'll find that they're
all ready to give you all the help and assistance
that you may need.
Your student body next year will very prob
ably be more than a mite different from this
student body of 1941. The men and women
who are graduating on the 15th of June may be
the last class for many years to leave Stanford
with the same hopes and the same ideals that
they had when they entered.
I hope that Volume 100 will do its darnedest
