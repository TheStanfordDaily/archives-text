# BULL SESSION
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
THE KISS-OFF
r JpHIS is the last time that I conduct my daily wrest
ling match with this typewriter. This is finis, ihc
kiss-off, as it were. I remember Sherm Mellinkoff at
this time last Spring Quarter. He laughed when we
predicted that he would become sentimental in his
last column. And he did become sentimental. It's al
most impossible not to when you realize that this is
the last time the campus will be able to read your
column.
But, of course I won't be sentimental because I'm
in a hurry. Besides, I've borrowed enough stuff from
Mellinkoff already. But I can't help but admit that
this is not like writing the several thousand other
Bull Sessions I have turned out.

| FEEL something like the anchor lap on a relay
team. The baton was started off four years ago
by John Cobbs, who passed it to Allen Drury. Cobbs,
after a one-volume rest, entered the prints again for
a year before MellinkofT took over for a year. Sherm
handed the stick to Bud Ames, and Ames thereupon
turned it over to me. I think perhaps most seniors
remember all these Bull Sessioners. They've all been
good (well, now, I wasn't so bad, was I?) And the
parade will continue ad infinitum. After careful con
sideration I have come to the conclusion that fifty
years hence few persons will remember any of us.
I'm almost willing to bet.
But as I look back I have enjoyed being a Bull
Sessioner. At the start I promised that I wouldn't
mount my white charger and crusade for reforms that
would save mankind, I fell down on that promise
somewhat, but for the most part this column has been
foolish enough to suit even the most discerning taste.
And I would like also to dispell finally the vicious
rumor that the linotyper has written all my columns.
He has written only those you didn't like.

j^ : EXT autumn Cheslie Donald Saroyan will assume
the great responsibility this column entails, name
ly, the spreading of light and goodwill on the campus.
Saroyan comes from a writing family and any simi
larity between his style and any other style is purely
coincidental. The Saroyans all act alike, there is no
reason why they shouldn't write alike.
I can guarantee that Saroyan will be good for some
laughs. Ho bought a Joe Miller joke book which he
plans to study this summer.
But enough is enough. As I said, this is the kiss-off.
Jason, hand me my walking stick.

reason why they shouldn't write alike.
I can guarantee that Saroyan will be good for some
laughs. Ho bought a Joe Miller joke book which he
plans to study this summer.
But enough is enough. As I said, this is the kiss-off.
Jason, hand me my walking stick.
THE KISS-OFF
r JpHIS is the last time that I conduct my daily wrest
ling match with this typewriter. This is finis, ihc
kiss-off, as it were. I remember Sherm Mellinkoff at
this time last Spring Quarter. He laughed when we
predicted that he would become sentimental in his
last column. And he did become sentimental. It's al
most impossible not to when you realize that this is
the last time the campus will be able to read your
column.
But, of course I won't be sentimental because I'm
in a hurry. Besides, I've borrowed enough stuff from
Mellinkoff already. But I can't help but admit that
this is not like writing the several thousand other
Bull Sessions I have turned out.

| FEEL something like the anchor lap on a relay
team. The baton was started off four years ago
by John Cobbs, who passed it to Allen Drury. Cobbs,
after a one-volume rest, entered the prints again for
a year before MellinkofT took over for a year. Sherm
handed the stick to Bud Ames, and Ames thereupon
turned it over to me. I think perhaps most seniors
remember all these Bull Sessioners. They've all been
good (well, now, I wasn't so bad, was I?) And the
parade will continue ad infinitum. After careful con
sideration I have come to the conclusion that fifty
years hence few persons will remember any of us.
I'm almost willing to bet.
But as I look back I have enjoyed being a Bull
Sessioner. At the start I promised that I wouldn't
mount my white charger and crusade for reforms that
would save mankind, I fell down on that promise
somewhat, but for the most part this column has been
foolish enough to suit even the most discerning taste.
And I would like also to dispell finally the vicious
rumor that the linotyper has written all my columns.
He has written only those you didn't like.

j^ : EXT autumn Cheslie Donald Saroyan will assume
the great responsibility this column entails, name
ly, the spreading of light and goodwill on the campus.
Saroyan comes from a writing family and any simi
larity between his style and any other style is purely
coincidental. The Saroyans all act alike, there is no
reason why they shouldn't write alike.
