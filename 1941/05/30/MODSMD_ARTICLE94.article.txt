# CAMPUS OPINION
## TRACK DEFENSE 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
For the past few days letters have appeared in
Campus Opinion criticizing the coaching of Stanford's
track team by Pitch Johnson. I am disappointed in
the shortsightedness and intolerance of the letter writ
ers. I should like to defend Pitch and clarify the sit
uation for anyone interested. Having been actively
engaged in track throughout my life at Stanford and
present captain of the team, I believe I am as well
informed on the situation as anyone.
Last year Stanford had a great team and a great j
coach. Everyone aside from a few B.A.C. officials re
alized this. At the close of last season twelve members j
of that team went East. I am the only one remaining.
The few track men who remained—all seniors this
year—who had looked forward to being coached by
Bill Ellington were diseippointed. Everyone was dis
gusted by the B.A.C.'s move. The whole situation
stank.
Into this dismal picture moved Pitch Johnson—a
guest of the B.A.C. The type of letter that appeared
in The Daily yesterday does not make the track pic- J
ture any clearer. It only diffuses, Pitch Johnson can
not be justly criticized until he has been able to start
a season with a clean slate, Then it will be his season
alone and free from others' dirty hands. I had hoped
that Pitch would have that opportunity next year. {
But letters in Campus Opinion have already started to
rob him of his chance. Atherton's effect upon next
year alone has been catastrophic. The team loses
what few track men it has. Stanford should not try
to make the situation worse. Pitch Johnson should be
given the hundred per cent co-operation of every
student. Then if results do not accrue within a few
years, criticism will be welcomed.
Very truly yours,
Ernie Clark
