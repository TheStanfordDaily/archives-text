# Buchan Novel Centers Around World War II
## 
### 
"Mountain Meadow" by John Bu
clian (Lord Tweedsmuir). Now on
sale at the Stanford Bookstore.
Lord Tweedsmuer, Governor-Gen
eral of Canada, died last year.
Among his papers was found the
manuscript of "Mountain Meadow."
Buchan has written Drofusely since
his college days: history, fiction,
biography. One series of his fiction
works deals with the adventures of
a group of Englishmen, top-flight
soldiers, administrators, and ad
venturers. The books are not a
serial, but one or two of the same
characters appear in all of them.
The first was "The Thirty-nine
Fteps," a spy story of the World
War. This one, the last records the
beginning of World War 11. To
gether, the series paint a picture fo
20 years of troubled peace, the 20
years of our own time.
ONLY A YEAR TO LIVE
When men begin to think about
their souls, there is usually a radical
change in their lives. Sir Edward
Leithen, a British lawyer and poli
tician of the first rank, is told that
he has tuberculosis and has only a
year to live. Being a man of strong
will, he settles up his affairs and
decides to die on his feet. A friend
asks him to find an important Amer
ican financier who has disappeared,
and Leithen accepts. The missing
man, Gaillard, is a French-Cana
dian and Leithen follows him back
into Canada and into the high
ranges of the North. He finds him
lost in the mountains, a wreck.
GAILLARD LEAVES HOME
Gaillard left home in his youth,
deserting his Catholic faith, and the
life his ancestors had led for 400
years. He had started to worry
about his chance of salvation, and
had come back to Canada as a pil
grimage, to ease his conscience.
But he has found no peace.
The winter catches Leithen's party
in the mountains, and, since Lei
then is far too weak now to fight
his way out, they winter there. By
what might be called a miracle,
the mountain air and primitive food
save Leithen's life, and he begins to
recover.
MISSIONAR YASKS AID
Then the missionary in the Indian
village below them sends for help.
Leithen meditates. If he goes down
into the village, the living condi
tions will kill him; if he does not,
the entire tribe will be wiped out,
for his party is the only help in
reach. He sees that in the world
there is a battle between Life and
Death, in the Indian village, and in
Europe, and that he who fights on
the side of life, fights for God.
Leithen goes down and saves the
village. The winter in the woods
and the successful battle against
Death in the Indian tribe have re
stored Gaillard to health and sanity.
Leithen had done his duty, and died,
as he wished to, on his feet; sure of
salvation.â€”Norton
