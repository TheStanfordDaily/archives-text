# Lake Enjoys Long Spring Season
## 
### 
With "sanctioned" swimming be
ginning about the first week of
March, Lagunita will end one of the
longest seasons in recent years when
it finally closes on the 12th of June.
With 55 canoes and (5 sailboats
calling the boathouse their "home,"
as well as the first Stanford Aqua
cade and a concert by members of
the Stanford Baud, the boathouse
has been a veritable beehive.
