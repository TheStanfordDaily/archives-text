pacity audience in the evening.
Declaring "the submergence of
freedom of speech and press has
already come to this country with
the madness of war psychosis," the
former President said that the duty
of the universities is to .stand firm
and hold the lights of civilization
"until the furies have passed."
"In the changes with -Which the
world is faced, many of our speakers
have properly forecast the growth
of governmental domination in the
life of the people," Mr. Hoover said.
"It means more limitation on per
sonal liberty is inevitable even in
the democracies."
"It will come faster under the ne
cessities of preparedness," he con
tinued. "Government may submerge
all liberty in case of war. Then it is,
the universities must raise again the
lamp of freedom."
The true test of governmental en
croachments upon the lives of men
is. he asserted, whether the act in
creases or protects, or limits or de
stroys, intellectual or spiritual free
dom; whether it makes for the dig
nity of men.
"This," he said, "is the only con
voy of Amei'ican civilization."
"The most easily available instru
ment for the protection of freedom
is government," Mr. Hoover con
tinued. "We use it too freely.
"For 70 years we have been cease
lessly legislating, ceaselessly try
ing to find the solution to these con
flicts. Too often the Teal test of
intellectual freedom and intellectual
integi"ity has not been searchingly
applied to these doings/*
Outlining the responsibilities of
American universities of the future,
he said:
"First, the obligation of our uni
versities is to fight every impair
ment of intellectual and spiritual
liberty. The universities must be
the insistent guardians of truth and
honesty.
"The widening of the boundaries
of knowledge must come from the
universities, because this is where
knowledge can be expanded for its
own sake.
"The universities must uphold
the standards of ethics and the great
domain of ideal values, and they can
give guidance to constructive forces
in time of crisis and they can check
destructive forces."
Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, presi
dent of the University Of California,

curious."

Declaring "the submergence of

the madness of war psychosis," the
former President said that the duty
of the universities is to .stand firm
and hold the lights of civilization
"until the furies have passed."
"In the changes with -Which the
world is faced, many of our speakers
have properly forecast the growth
of governmental domination in the
life of the people," Mr. Hoover said.
"It means more limitation on per
sonal liberty is inevitable even in
the democracies."
"It will come faster under the ne
cessities of preparedness," he con
tinued. "Government may submerge
all liberty in case of war. Then it is,
the universities must raise again the
lamp of freedom."
The true test of governmental en
croachments upon the lives of men
is. he asserted, whether the act in

nity of men.

is government," Mr. Hoover con

"For 70 years we have been cease
lessly legislating, ceaselessly try
ing to find the solution to these con
flicts. Too often the Teal test of
intellectual freedom and intellectual
integi"ity has not been searchingly
applied to these doings/*
Outlining the responsibilities of
American universities of the future,
he said:
"First, the obligation of our uni
versities is to fight every impair
ment of intellectual and spiritual
liberty. The universities must be
the insistent guardians of truth and
honesty.
"The widening of the boundaries
of knowledge must come from the
universities, because this is where
knowledge can be expanded for its
own sake.
"The universities must uphold

sonal liberty is inevitable even in
the democracies."
"It will come faster under the ne
cessities of preparedness," he con

all liberty in case of war. Then it is,
the universities must raise again the
lamp of freedom."
The true test of governmental en

nity of men.
"This," he said, "is the only con

is government," Mr. Hoover con
tinued. "We use it too freely.
"For 70 years we have been cease
lessly legislating, ceaselessly try
ing to find the solution to these con
flicts. Too often the Teal test of
intellectual freedom and intellectual
integi"ity has not been searchingly
applied to these doings/*
Outlining the responsibilities of
American universities of the future,
he said:
"First, the obligation of our uni
versities is to fight every impair
ment of intellectual and spiritual
liberty. The universities must be
the insistent guardians of truth and
honesty.
"The widening of the boundaries
of knowledge must come from the
universities, because this is where
knowledge can be expanded for its
own sake.
"The universities must uphold
the standards of ethics and the great
domain of ideal values, and they can
give guidance to constructive forces
in time of crisis and they can check
destructive forces."
