# President Wilbur To Stay Until 1943
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur will
hold office until January 1, 1943, with
the additional title of chancellor, first
carried by David Starr Jordan.
The decision of the board of trus
tees last week extended for the sec
ond time President Wilbur's term of
office. At his reitrement date in June
1940, he was induced to remain until
January 1942 because of the univer
sity's 50th anniversary celebration.
The defense needs of the country
have made unavailable a number of
men who were to be considered as
his successor, so President Wilbur
was prevailed upon to rmeain during
the crisis.
