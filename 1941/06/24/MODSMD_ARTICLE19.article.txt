Welcoming the large class to the
Stanford family of alumni, Charles

ver, '98, and President Ray Lyman
Wilbur, '96, sounded notes of en
couragement through their acknowl
edgment of grave warlike times.
The Frost amphitheater was filled
to overflowing by relatives and
fi'iends of the graduates who wit
nessed the University's largest
graduating class proceed through
impressive exercises Sunday, June
15. As the strains of organ music
"piped" by electricity from the
Stanford Memorial Church swelled
through the tree-lined bowl, the
graduates appeared over the rim at
both sides and descended to front
seats.
Next came trustees and faculty
members with two representatives
each of the 49 classes previously
graduated, who proceeded from the
rear rim to seats at the rear of the
speaker's platform. Students re
ceiving advanced degrees were
seated at their right. President
Wilbur presented the diplomas.
Forty-one of those receiving bach
elor of arts degrees were graduated
with "great distinction," and 94
"with distinction."
Of the advanced degrees, 59 were
doctor of philosophy, 61 doctor of
medicine, 12 doctor of education, 27
bachelor of laws, 163 master of arts,
74 master of business administra
tion, and 34 engineer.
The commencement brought to a
close a week of activity for gradu
ates. Department heads entertained
them and their parents at teas Sat
urday afternoon. Dr. John A. Mac
kay, Scottish-born missionary of the
Free Church of Scotland to Peru,
now president of the Princeton The
ological Seminary, delivered the
baccalaureate sermon in Memorial
Church on Sunday morning and a
Phi Beta Kappa buffet luncheon for
members and guests was served at
