# Children and Grown-ups Alike Go to Stanford This Summer
## 
### 
Not all persons going to school on
the Stanford campus this summer
will be of college age.
Children from 5 to 1G years of
age will attend regular classes
stalling next Monday, but they will
be attending the summer demonstra
tion school which provides a labora
tory for teachers in education.
Staffed by specialists from both
east and west coasts, the demonstra
tion school will provide classes for
all grades from the primary, inter
mediate and upper grades to junior
and senior high school. Classes in
physical education and reading de
velopment also are being provided.
The limited group of students in
reading development will work
during a daily two-hour period of
individualized and group instruc
tion. This arrangement will give
teachers in the Reading Center op
portunity to work with the indi
vidual child, observe group tech
niques, and participate in the read
ing class under Dr. Walter Barnes,

â–ºof New York University, and George
Gates.
Although the course Education
288, "Reading in the Modern Cur
riculum," has already started, the
children's sessions will not begin un
til June 30. There is still an oppor
tunity for a few teachers interested
in reading development to assist in
this work, School of Education offi
cial announced. A flexible program
may be arranged by consulting Mrs.
Helen Rachford, Dr. Walter Barnes,
or George Gates.
During the last three summers
more than one hundred students
who have attended the Reading Cen
ter have gained an average of half
a grade in understanding and more
than a grade in rate of understand
ing.
A limited number of senior high
schools are having the opportunity
to gain experience in English and
social studies with credit accepted
in the Palo Alto and Sequoia high
schools.
