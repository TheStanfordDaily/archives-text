# Students' Wives To Organize Club
## 
### 
Wives of students will have an
opportunity to get together in the
organization of their own group, the
Summer Dames, at the club's first
meeting in the Faculty Women's
Club house at 2 p.m. Thursday.
An informal afternoon has been
planned as a particular welcome to
those wives of Stanford students
who are here for the first time.
Fomier members also are to be wel
comed. Other plans as outlined by
the committee call for visits to
points of interest about the Univer
sity. One of the first is to be an
afternoon at the museum.
Three divisions of the organiza
tion will hold regular meetings
throughout the summer quarter â€”
the bridge, reading, and sewing
groups.
Mrs. John C. Alniack, GB3 Alva
rado Row. is senior sponsor and Mrs.
I. James Quillen, 350 Embarcadei'o,
is junior sponsor of Summer Dames.
The committee in charge of summer
plans comprises Mesdames Rex Har
low, George Gates, Edward Krug,
Donald Van Petten, and Everett
Reed.
Students are invited to make the
lobby of the Union a place in which
to meet friends, listen to the radio,
or perhaps study.
