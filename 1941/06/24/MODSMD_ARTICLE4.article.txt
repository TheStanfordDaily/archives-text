### DR. ELIOT G. MEARS 
Director of Slimmer Quarter
It is my privilege again this year to
welcome the students and faculty of
the summer quarter. At no time has
the summer session started under
more auspicious circumstances.
An excellent augury is the remark
able symposium on "The University
and the Future of America" held last
week during the interval between
the regular spring and summer quar
ters. Nor should we be unmindful of
the epoch-making exercises in con
nection with the dedication of the
Hoover Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace, as well as other events
connected with the Fiftieth Anniver
sary Celebration. Notables came to
the campus from all sections of our
country and many expect to remain
until September.
The international situation has
prompted the enlargement of our
curriculum in most departments. For
the first time, the School of Engi
neering has organized a summer pro
gram designed to enable students to
complete their regular course in
three years. The Graduate School of
Business also has expanded its of
ferings so as to permit entering as
well as second-year students to com
plete their requirements as quickly
as possible.
In addition to the members of the
regular Stanford faculty, the visiting
faculty is composed of distinguished
individuals who serve to make our
summer courses and social contacts
of unique value to the appreciative
student.
Concerts, lectures, and recitals
have been planned for the summer
months. The "Calendar," issued each
Thursday, and The Stanford Daily,
which appears on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, will bring complete in
formation on these programs.
The Tuesday Evening Series, the
Wednesday afternoon lectures by vis
iting professors, the Monday evening
Dramatists' Alliance lectures, plays,
organ recitals, the Sunday Church
service, and the eight Brahms con
certs by the Pro Arte Quartet on
Monday afternoons and Thursday
evenings, which are the gift to the
summer quarter of Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge, are among the
features. All too often we overlook
the rich opportunities for culture and
relaxation on the Stanford Farm.
So it is my sincere wish that this
summer quarter of 1941 may bring
much of distinct profit and real en
joyment to the students who are en
rolling with us this week. You are
joining the Stanford family.

and Peace, as well as other events
connected with the Fiftieth Anniver
sary Celebration. Notables came to
the campus from all sections of our
country and many expect to remain
until September.
The international situation has
prompted the enlargement of our
curriculum in most departments. For
the first time, the School of Engi
neering has organized a summer pro
gram designed to enable students to
complete their regular course in
three years. The Graduate School of
Business also has expanded its of
ferings so as to permit entering as
well as second-year students to com
plete their requirements as quickly
as possible.
In addition to the members of the
regular Stanford faculty, the visiting
faculty is composed of distinguished
individuals who serve to make our
summer courses and social contacts
of unique value to the appreciative
student.
Concerts, lectures, and recitals
have been planned for the summer
months. The "Calendar," issued each
Thursday, and The Stanford Daily,
which appears on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, will bring complete in
formation on these programs.
The Tuesday Evening Series, the
Wednesday afternoon lectures by vis
iting professors, the Monday evening
Dramatists' Alliance lectures, plays,
organ recitals, the Sunday Church
service, and the eight Brahms con
certs by the Pro Arte Quartet on
Monday afternoons and Thursday
evenings, which are the gift to the
summer quarter of Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge, are among the
features. All too often we overlook
the rich opportunities for culture and
relaxation on the Stanford Farm.
So it is my sincere wish that this
summer quarter of 1941 may bring
much of distinct profit and real en
joyment to the students who are en
rolling with us this week. You are
joining the Stanford family.
Director of Slimmer Quarter
It is my privilege again this year to
welcome the students and faculty of
the summer quarter. At no time has
the summer session started under
more auspicious circumstances.
An excellent augury is the remark
able symposium on "The University
and the Future of America" held last
week during the interval between
the regular spring and summer quar
ters. Nor should we be unmindful of
the epoch-making exercises in con
nection with the dedication of the
Hoover Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace, as well as other events
connected with the Fiftieth Anniver
sary Celebration. Notables came to
