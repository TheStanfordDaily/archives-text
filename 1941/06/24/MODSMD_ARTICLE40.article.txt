# Summer Plans Of Dramatists Include 2 Plays
## Dramatists' Alliance To Begin Lectures Next Monday Evening 
### 
Honoring the Golden Anniversary
of Stanford the Dramatists' Alliance
is building a summer program of
plays spanning the 50-year period
in nature and content.
Two plays and a marionette por
duction are planned for the summer
quarter.
Quite in harmony with the period
when the Stanfords flourished, the
play "Douglas" by John Home is to
be presented. Dating back to 1756
the play was so famous that it was
still popular during the decade of
the 1850's. It was the first of the
great Scottish romantic plays and
drew large audiences through enthu
siasm of the Scots in this region
where it was given eleven times dur
ing the mid-centenry decade.
LECTURE PROGRAM
The second play, just as realistic
as "Douglas" was romantic, will be
Ibsen's '"Ghosts," which marks the
end of the 50-year period.
The lecture program of the al
liance will open at 8 o'clock Monday
evening, June 30, at the Women's
Club House. The program will con

of the faculty of the School of Let
