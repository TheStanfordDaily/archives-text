Characterizing the summer quar
ter as advantageous and important.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
terday extended greetings to the
faculty and students.
His message was as follows:
The summer has become increas
ingly important in university edu
cation. The old relationship of
school to crops no longer applies,
but habit has fixed upon the sum
mer period as one for vacations and
for freedom from intellectual work.
For years, though, we have recog
nized that no long vacations were
required and that much time could
be saved through attendance in the
summer quarters 01* summer ses
sions. This has become more evi
dent as more and more time has
been demanded for training for the
higher posts in all parts of our
democracy. Now there is the added
necessity for speeding up this proc
ess to meet the new demands in
connection with our national defense
activities.
Through attendance in the sum
mer quarters here at Stanford a
whole year can be saved by candi
dates for the bachelor of arts de
gree, and the time can be shortened
for the courses in medicine, law, en
gineering, chemistry, and for other
advanced degrees.
Since the members of our regu
lar teaching staff have only three
quarters of duty in any calendar
year, and we have the four-quarter
system, professors from other insti
tutions make up a considerable part
of our summer quarter faculty,
bringing in variety and fresh points
of view. This makes the summer
quarter at Stanford interesting and
important. With the smaller classes
there is also a better chance to be
come acquainted with the faculty.
Indeed, with the change in the kind
of extracurricular activities that are
available, there seems to be more
time for acquaintance not only be
tween students and faculty but
among the students themselves.
We are very proud of the beauty
of the Stanford campus at all times
of the year, and it is never more
beautiful than during the summer.
In such surroundings, with good
weather and an excellent faculty,
the Stanford students for the sum
mer of 1941 should be able to enjoy
their work, even though in many
cases it may be taken under the
pressure of the present necessity for
national defense.
On behalf of the University I am
glad indeed to extend a warm wel
come and a hearty greeting to the
faculty and students who are to be
on our campus this summer. For
each one of them I trust that this
quarter will prove to be one of the
happiest and most interesting of
their Stanford experiences.

system, professors from other insti
tutions make up a considerable part
of our summer quarter faculty,
bringing in variety and fresh points
of view. This makes the summer
quarter at Stanford interesting and
important. With the smaller classes
there is also a better chance to be
come acquainted with the faculty.
Indeed, with the change in the kind
of extracurricular activities that are
available, there seems to be more
time for acquaintance not only be
tween students and faculty but
among the students themselves.
We are very proud of the beauty
of the Stanford campus at all times
of the year, and it is never more
beautiful than during the summer.
In such surroundings, with good
weather and an excellent faculty,
the Stanford students for the sum
mer of 1941 should be able to enjoy
their work, even though in many
cases it may be taken under the
pressure of the present necessity for
national defense.
On behalf of the University I am
glad indeed to extend a warm wel
come and a hearty greeting to the
faculty and students who are to be
on our campus this summer. For
each one of them I trust that this
quarter will prove to be one of the
happiest and most interesting of
their Stanford experiences.
mer quarters here at Stanford a
whole year can be saved by candi
dates for the bachelor of arts de
gree, and the time can be shortened
for the courses in medicine, law, en
gineering, chemistry, and for other
advanced degrees.

lar teaching staff have only three

Characterizing the summer quar

President Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
terday extended greetings to the
faculty and students.
His message was as follows:
The summer has become increas
ingly important in university edu
cation. The old relationship of
school to crops no longer applies,
but habit has fixed upon the sum
mer period as one for vacations and
for freedom from intellectual work.
For years, though, we have recog
nized that no long vacations were
required and that much time could
be saved through attendance in the
summer quarters 01* summer ses
sions. This has become more evi
dent as more and more time has
been demanded for training for the
higher posts in all parts of our
democracy. Now there is the added
necessity for speeding up this proc
ess to meet the new demands in
connection with our national defense
activities.
