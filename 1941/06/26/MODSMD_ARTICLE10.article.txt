# Chemists Tell Of Discoveries
## Protein Delegates Reveal Experiments 
### 
Experiments which modify the
classical theory of animal metabo
lism were described Tuesday morn
ing to the members of the Protein
Research Conference by Dr. Rudolf
Schoenheimer, associate professor of
biological chemistry at Columbia
University.
The long-held theory that human
metabolism is like a combustion en
gine has been attacked before, espe
cially by Dr. Borsook of Cal Tech,
the famous biochemist declared.
However, the work done at Colum
bia further the modern theory that
the human body is in a continuous
process of breaking down and re
pairing tissues from birth until
death.
Dr. Lewis G. Longsworth, physio
logical chemist from Harvard Medi
cal School, presented a paper yes
terday afternoon which described a
chemical procedure aided by an
electric current which may in time
become a diagnosis for infections,
kidney disease, cancer and other
diseases.
The conference ends tomorrow
with discussions by Dr. M. A. Lauf
fer of the Rockefeller Institute for
Advanced Study, at Princeton, and
by Dr. C. L. Hoagland, associated of
the hospital of the Rockefeller Insti
tute for Medical Research.
Today Drs. Max Bergmann and
H. B. Vickery, of the Rockefeller
Institute and biochemist of the Con
necticut Agricultural Experiment
Station respectively, will discuss the
metabolism of proteins and plant
proteins.
The meetings are not open to the
general public.
