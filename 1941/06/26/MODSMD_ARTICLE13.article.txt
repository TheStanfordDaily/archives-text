# Western Educators Plan Commission For Co-operation in National Defense
## Delegates Okay Crisis Proposal 
### 
The Pacific Regional Conference
on Higher Education closed its
three-day session at Stanford yes
terday evening with the recom
mendation that a commission be
formed of the colleges, universities,
and junior colleges of the seven
western states to co-operate with
the armed forces and the selective
service administrations for national
defense.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president
of Stanford, presented the findings
of the conference at an informal
organization meeting yesterday.
George F. Zook, president of the
American Council on Education,
and Dr. Rufus B. von KleinSmid,
president of the University of
Southern California, contributed to
the motion that a commission be
formed.
CONSIDER CRISIS
The movement came as the result
of three days of the conferences at
which delegates from Pacific Coast
universities and colleges discussed
the problems of higher education
and the national crisis.
The commission as planned will
include delegates appointed by col
lege and university presidents in the
region approximating the Ninth
Corps Area â€” the seven western
states. The delegates will represent
all the fields that have been de
clared especially valuable to na
tional defense, as well as definite
regions in the area.
The commission proposed would
study, plan and propose far-reach
ing policies designed to unite higher
education centers in the area in
contributing to national defense and
general social wefare.
TO CO-OPERATE
It would co-operate with other
agencies in pooling experiences with
local draft boards, co-operate with
Army, Navy, and industry and agri
cutlure, determine the fields through
which each institution might con
tribute most to the defense pro
gram.
It would urge the national puthor
ities to recognize and profit by far
sighted policies such as those adopt
ed by Great Britain in trying to
protect the institutions that are over
a long period essential to national
welfare.
Tuesday evening Rear-Admiral
J. W. Greenslade and Major H. F.
Osborne told delegates how the col
leges and universities can co-operate
with national and civil defense,
