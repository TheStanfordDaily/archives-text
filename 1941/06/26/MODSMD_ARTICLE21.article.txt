## Golfers Win NCAA

Stanford's undefeated golf team
added more laurels to its already
long list Tuesday on the Ohio State
University course in Columbus when
the Indians won the National Colle
giate Athletic Association team golf
championship with only 580 strokes.
The team made up of Bud Finger,
Bud Brownell, Warren Berl, and
Dee Replogle established a new rec
ord for the tourney, touring the 36
holes in 21 strokes less than the old
mark, made by Stanford in 1938.
Finger shot a 143 to take second
place in the individual qualifying
rounds. Earl Stewart of Louisiana
State had a 142 to lead the 64 col
legians into the match play which
will be climaxed by the 36-hole
semi-finals and the 36-hole final
Saturday afternoon.
One stroke behind Finger in third
place came Brownell, while Berl
finished with 146 and Replogle had
147. These scores were well below
the qualifying score of 154. The other
two Indians on the team, Gordy
Hough and Sandy Tatum, failed to
qualify.
In the parings for first-round
matches all four Farm men were put
in the upper half of the draw, which
means that there can't possibly be
an all-Stanford final. First and sec
ond-round matches were played yes
terday with third-round and quar
ter-finals matches today.
