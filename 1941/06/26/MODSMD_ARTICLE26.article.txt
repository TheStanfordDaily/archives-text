# Cardinals Defend College Net Title
## 
### 
Larry Dee and Jimmy Wade,
Stanford juniors, are defending
their Intercollegiate tennis doubles
title at Haverford, Pennsylvania, this
week against the nation's best col
lege net talent.
Although both Dee and Wade
were defeated in their second-round
singles matches, they are still fa
vored to take the doubles for the
second consecutive year. The Stan
ford team drew a bye in the first
round of doubles play.
Joe Hunt, ex-Southern Californian
now at Annapolis, is seeded No. 1 in
the singles division with Ted Ole
wine, Trojan sophomore in the No. 2
spot. These men should battle it out

in the final to succeed Don McNeil,
1940 winner and national champion,
if neither gets upset in the quarter
and semi-finals.
The Southern California duet of
Billy Reedy and George Toley is
seeded behind Dee and Wade in the
doubles. The Trojans hold several
victories over Stanford's aces in
competition this year.

Every Sunday morning seniors
place flowers on the Stanford Mau
soleum.
