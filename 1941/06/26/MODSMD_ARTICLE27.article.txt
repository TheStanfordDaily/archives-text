# Former Track Stars Compete
## 
### 
Although Stanford will not be
represented with a team in the Na
tional A.A.U. Track and Field
Championships which are to be held
in Philadelphia this coming Satur
day and Sunday, June 28 and 29,
several Farm graduates will com
pete for other organizations in the
meet which comes as somewhat of
an anti-climax to the N.C.A.A. held
here last week-end.
Phil Fox, Indian discus thrower
of several years back, will compete
for the Olympic Club of San Fran
cisco. Fox should take either first
or second in his event to help the
club win their third straight team
title.
Bill Trout, tackle and shot putter
of last year, might also represent the
Winged "O" in the Quaker City. An
other possibility is Dick Simpson,
straight-A student and hurdler of
the Class of 1940. Simpson is now
taking graduate work at Harvard
and competing for the Boston A.A.
