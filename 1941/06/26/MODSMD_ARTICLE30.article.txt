# Innis Discusses Economic Life In Series Talk
## Declares Economists' Problem of Interest To Western Civilization 
### 
"Economic freedom, which is the
central problem of the economists
of today, is of vital interest to the
universities of western civilization,"
Professor Harold A. Innis declared
to the Wednesday afternoon series
group in the Alumni Room of the
Women's Clubhouse yesterday.
Professor Innis, who is acting
professor of political economics in
the University this quarter, chose
as his subject "Economists and the
Modern State." He discussed the
evolution of economic freedom be
ginning with economic life in Ath
ens and Rome and continuing to
modern times. Monarchy, said Pro
fessor Innis, gradually develops in
to despotism and aristocracy evolves
oligarchy.
"While the church tried to excom
municate Hume, Hutchinson, and
Adam Smith, they have become the
founders of economic freedom." He
continued his talk into modern day
problems with the statement that
"Expansion of the United States fol
lowed economic and religious lib
erty."
"Free trade reached its highest
point in the middle of the last cen
tury. Rising tariffs signified the
growth of capitalism and national
ism and the decline of free trade."
Professor Innis concluded his talk
by saying that from religious and
political freedom emerges economic
freedom.
Professor Innis has been located at
the University of Toronto since
1920, where he became head of the
department of political economics in
1937. He received his BA. and M.A.
at Mac Master and his Ph.D. at Chi
cago. He has also worked on sev
eral government commissions.
"The Problem of Full Employ
ment" will be the subject discussed
by Sumner H. Slichter, acting pro
fessor of business economics, at the
second lecture of the Wednesday
series on July 2, at 4:15 in the
Lower Lounge of the Women's Club
house.
Professor Slichter, who is Lamont
University Professor at Harvard
University, is a noted authority on
labor. He received his A.B. in 1913
and his A.M. the following year at
the University of Wisconsin. He
became an instructor in economics
at Princeton and an assistant pro
fessor of economics at Cornell
where he later was a professor for
five years. In 1939-40 he became
professor of business economics in
the Graduate School of Business
Administration at Harvard. He has
been a professor at Lamont Univer
sity since 1940 and a member of the
