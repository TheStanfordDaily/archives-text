# Farm Police Enforce Laws
## 
### 
Traffic regulations are going to be
rigidly enforced this summer be
cause of the tendency of students to
speed on the new roads on the cam
pus.
Palm Drive and other posted areas
will have a 25 m.p.h. speed limit, but
all other roads surrounding the
school buildings are 20 m.p.h.
The restricted parking zones are
still in effect and citations will be
given those students who park in
the faculty parking sections and in
the "no parking" zones.
The regular standing police force
of seven officers will patrol the
campus and those who receive tick
ets from them will have to appear
before the Men's Council.
