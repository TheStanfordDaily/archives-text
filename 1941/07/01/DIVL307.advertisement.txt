.... For the Stanford woman
whose summer wardrobe is still
a little sketchy, and for those
extras that put the finishing
touches on a simple costume,
Sue Berry offers some real buys
at her annual summer sale.
She has a few slack suits in
sharkskin, and in a rough linen
finish fabric which tailors
beautifully. Even if you can't
wear slacks in the Cellar, they'd
be really super for special pic
nics and beach parties. (Prices
range from $7.00.)
Admitted that really good
looking costume jewelry is rare,
Sue Berry has a few white shell
necklaces and strand bracelets
which look marvelous against
newly acquired sun-tans. (Be
tween $2.00 and $4.00.)
And last, but not least, there's
a new shipment of sheer Shet
land sweaters just being un
packed which will disappear
awfully fast. The colors are
georgeous—real summer shades,
and one, a sort of soft-tangerine
color with the nice name of
"Desert Clow," would look fine
in my own closet. . . .
