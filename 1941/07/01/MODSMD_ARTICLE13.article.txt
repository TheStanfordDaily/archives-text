# Tuesday Series Features Noted Pianist, Composer
## Joyce Barthelson to Give Lecture On Contemporary American Music 
### 
America has made a declaration of musical independence, according to
Joyce Bartheson, noted pianist and composer, who will lecture on modern
composers on the Tuesday Evening Series at 8 p.m. in the Memorial Hall
Auditorium. She will illustrate her lecture by playing some of the out
standing contemporary American compositions on the piano.

â–º According to Miss Barthelson,
America sings its own robust and
native songs freed from entangling
musical alliances. Our American
composers, instead of being depend
ent upon the European masters, have
now assumed musical leadership.
Miss Barthelson first came into
musical prominence as the pianist
of the Arion Trio, which was heard
in nationwide broadcasts from the
West Coast stations. Later she be
came staff ensemble coach and pian
ist for the National Broadcasting
Company, Pacific Coast Division,
and musical director of the Standard
School Broadcast of the National
Broadcasting Company's West Coast
studios in San Francisco. In 1936
Miss Barthelson went to New York
and was appointed assistant con
ductor of Dr. Antonio Brico's famed
New York Women's Symphony Or
chestra. She has spent two seasons
as a member of the McDowell Col
ony in Peterboro, New Hampshire,
and during 1940 served as conductor
of the New York Symphonetta.
Charles Wakefield Cadman, Amer
ican composer, has said of Miss
Barthelson:
"I regard the creative work as well
as pianistic talents of Joyce Barthel
son as among the finest in the
country. I can frankly say that this
American musician and composer is
most highly gifted, well trained and
resourceful. I commend her work
to the vast musical public."
