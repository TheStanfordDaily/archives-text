"The eight-year-old child is more
generous to his fellow men than the
enlightened college professor!"
This was the conclusion reached
by Tamara Dembo, assistant profes
sor of psychology, at the recent
Western Psychological Meeting held
at the University of California. "Re
cent studies in moral conflict" was
the topic which Miss Dembo pre
sented.
On the basis of several experi
ments made at the Child Welfare
Research Station at the University
of lowa, it was found that adults
were generous only in 15 per cent of
the instances as compared with 43
per cent shown by the eight-year
olds.
METHOD GIVEN
The scheme of the experiment was
as follows: A child faced with a
pair of toys, one highly desirable
and another not so attractive, had
to decide how to distribute them be
tween two children—a friend and a
stranger. In the experiment in
which the subject had to keep one
toy and give the other away, he
was presented with four pairs of
toys; thus he could be one to four
times "selfish" or "generous" in his
decisions.
GUIDED BY LIKES
"Whereas the younger children
are guided more strongly by imme
diate likes," stressed Miss Dembo,
"the older children have developed
a more abstract ideology involving
more definite conceptions about
people not in direct contact with
them."
Ninety-five per cent of the deci
sions of the five-year-olds were
"selfish," as contrasted with 43 per
cent of the older children's.
