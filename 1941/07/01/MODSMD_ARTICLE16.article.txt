# Olive Trees Add Beauty to Farm
## 
### 
Three large olive trees, as old as
Stanford itself, have been trans
planted to the campus from the Tim
othy Hopkins estate in Menlo Park
to join the many others of the same
species and of like age in front of
the College of Education and Me
morial Hall. They have been planted
between the Hoover Library and the
University Library.
The trees are a part of a collec
tion brought by Mr. Hopkins to his
estate from many parts of the world.
The identifying tags of the trees
given the University have long since
been lost, according to James W.
McDonnell, superintendent of build
ing and grounds, but they are ap
proximately 50 years old.
The trees added to the eucalyp
tus trees already growing have
changed the appearance of that part
of the grounds recently used for
parking.
