## Net Pair Loses In Semi-Finals 
### 
Stanford's ace tennis doubles
combination, Larry Dee and Jimmy
Wade, unsuccessfully defended the
intercollegiate crown which they won
last year when they were defeated
in the semi-final round of the 1941
tournament at Haverford, Penn., last
week by Charles Mattman and Ted
Olewine of U.S.C., 9-7, 2-6, 4-6, 6-4,
6-4.
Mattman and Olewine continued
their sterling play to take the final
from the California team of Bob
Hippenstiel and Bill Canning, 6-3,
6-4, 6-4. The Bear duo went into
the finals by defeating the No. 2
seeded team of George Toley and
Bill heedy, also of Southern Cali
fornia, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.
In the singles division which saw
Stanford's representatives put out in
the early rounds, Joe Hunt of An
napolis defeated Olewine, 6-3, 6-0,
6-1. Hunt, ranked among the first
five amateur netmen in the country,
polished the Trojan sophomore off in
54 minutes.
Dee and Wade will continue their
play in the eastern circuit of
matches throughout the summer,
terminating in the National cham
pionships in September. Bob Low,
captain of the 1941 Farm tennis
team, may join his ex-teammates
later in the season.
