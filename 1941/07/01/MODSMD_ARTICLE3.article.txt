# Union and Cellar Cater to Campus
## 
### 
The main lobby of Union will be
open during the summer for the
convenience of those who might wish
to study, listen to the radio, or sit
and chat with friends. Luncheon
and dinner are served there daily,
except Saturdays, from 12 to 1 and
6 to 7, respectively. Sunday hours
are from 12:45 to 1:45 and from 6
until 7.
Below, the Cellar is open from 7:30
a.m. until 10:30 p.m. Monday through
Thursday and closes at 8 p.m. Fri
day, Saturday, and Sunday. Here
students go for coffee and a snail
before 8-o'clocks, cokes between
classes, and regular meals. Candy,
tobacco, and sundries are available
at the cigar counter in the Cellar.
