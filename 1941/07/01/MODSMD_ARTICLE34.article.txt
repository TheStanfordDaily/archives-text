# 'Paly' Rides Top Farm's Tradition List
## 
### 
"Those with cars pick up those
without" is the friendly motto which
Farm tradition has written and
which all Stanford students follow
with regard to their classmates.
The best place to try the validity
of this tradition is diagonally across
from English Corner at the campus
end of Palm Drive, or at the corner
of Galvez and Serra Streets opposite
Encina Hall, if you are looking for a
ride into Paly.
Friendly Farm men and women
will be found willing to give you a
lift back to the campus if you stand
on the corner next to Roos Broth
ers in Palo Alto.
You won't have to wait long (ac
cording to tradition) if you wait in
the appointed place for a free ride
to or from the Farm, but if the first
car should pass you by, don't lose
faith, because they probably have a
full load or are new at Stanford and
have not yet picked up the friendly
spirit.
So this may never (or only rarely
come to pass) remember that all
good Stanford Roughs and co-eds
practice what they preach, that
"those with cars pick up those
without."
