# Nabokov Talks On Russ War
## Russian Novelist Discusses Conflict 
### AUDREY KRAUSE 
"Hitler may go far into Russia,"
said Vladimir Nabokov, novelist and
playwright, who recently came from
New York to lecture to summer
quarter students on "Modern Rus
sian Literature" and "The Art of
Writing."
Born in St. Petersburg, now Len
ingrad, Mr. Nabokov was educated
in Russian schools until his family
was forced to escape to Berlin,
where his father, a member of the
Russian Parliament and editor of a
liberal Russian newspaper, was mur
dered in a political fray some years
later in 1922.
"Of course, I'm not so much in
terested in politics," insisted Mr.
Nabokov, allowing the telephone to
ring as he continued to discuss the
present situation: "The conse
quences for Russia will be bad if
Stalin wins. In any case, the pres
ent conflict will help England.
RUSSIANS ARE BRAVE
"The Russians are in a very dif
ficult position, as is America. They
are brave soldiers, and they have
good machines, but once those ma
chines are broken, they cannot
mend them.
"The Russian Air Force is strong,
though unfortunately not as strong
as Germany's, but their aviators are
good. In fact, the first attempts in
aviation were made in Russia."
Mr. Nabokov has no use for either
the Lenin or Stalin regimes and
hopes that some day Russia will
have a liberal government such as
the Americans and English have.
This, he feels, would not be an
impossibility for Russia.
However, German rule seems much
more likely at the moment, said Mr.
Nabokov. Stalin has been incred
ibly foolish. If it is true that he has
been underhanded in his relations
with Germany, in seeking alliances
with other countries, he has been
foolish. On the other hand, if he
failed to be prepared on the basis of
the non-aggression pact, he was also
foolish.
Mr. Nabokov has written a dozen
Russian novels, three English, and
one American, "Laughter in the
Dark," published by Bobbs-Merrill.
In addition, he writes articles for
New Republic and Atlantic Monthly.
One appeared recently in the June
issue.
Turquoise in the language of the
American Indian means "piece of
fallen sky."

more likely at the moment, said Mr.
Nabokov. Stalin has been incred
ibly foolish. If it is true that he has
been underhanded in his relations
with Germany, in seeking alliances
with other countries, he has been
foolish. On the other hand, if he
failed to be prepared on the basis of
the non-aggression pact, he was also
foolish.
Mr. Nabokov has written a dozen
Russian novels, three English, and
one American, "Laughter in the
Dark," published by Bobbs-Merrill.
In addition, he writes articles for
New Republic and Atlantic Monthly.
One appeared recently in the June
issue.

"Hitler may go far into Russia,"
said Vladimir Nabokov, novelist and
playwright, who recently came from
New York to lecture to summer
quarter students on "Modern Rus
sian Literature" and "The Art of
Writing."
Born in St. Petersburg, now Len
ingrad, Mr. Nabokov was educated
in Russian schools until his family
was forced to escape to Berlin,
where his father, a member of the
Russian Parliament and editor of a
liberal Russian newspaper, was mur
dered in a political fray some years
later in 1922.
"Of course, I'm not so much in
terested in politics," insisted Mr.
Nabokov, allowing the telephone to
ring as he continued to discuss the
present situation: "The conse
quences for Russia will be bad if
Stalin wins. In any case, the pres
ent conflict will help England.
RUSSIANS ARE BRAVE
"The Russians are in a very dif
ficult position, as is America. They
are brave soldiers, and they have
good machines, but once those ma
chines are broken, they cannot
mend them.
"The Russian Air Force is strong,
though unfortunately not as strong
as Germany's, but their aviators are
good. In fact, the first attempts in
aviation were made in Russia."
Mr. Nabokov has no use for either
the Lenin or Stalin regimes and
hopes that some day Russia will
have a liberal government such as
the Americans and English have.
This, he feels, would not be an
impossibility for Russia.
However, German rule seems much
more likely at the moment, said Mr.
Nabokov. Stalin has been incred
ibly foolish. If it is true that he has
been underhanded in his relations
with Germany, in seeking alliances
with other countries, he has been
