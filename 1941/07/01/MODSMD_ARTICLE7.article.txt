# Farm Lauds Presentation Of 'Douglas'
## 
### 
Performed in the mid-19th cen
tury bravura manner, the Dramatists
Alliance presented John Home's
Scottish play, "Douglas," Saturday
evening in the auditorium of the
Education Building.
If the presentation of "Douglas"
attracted many Scots to the San
Francisco performance in the 1850's,
a poll of the audience Saturday
night might have shown an equal
percentage of those with Scottish
ancestry. The play was greatly en
joyed through its novel presenta
tion. Richard Laidlaw, '41, garbed in
the kilt of his ancestors, the Mc-
Euen, opened and closed the per
formance with selections on the
bagpipe.
The play itself was a romantic
tragedy, the theme of which Home
took from the Scottish ballad of "Gil
Maurice" and produced in 1756.
Members of the cast were Myna
Brutton Hughes, Robert Betten
court, Elsie Werthman, Richard
Rosenblatt, Asher Wilson, John
Doty, and Rodney Pain.
The play was staged by Miss
Hughes and directed by Dr. Mar
gery Bailey. The costuming was in
charge of Hazel Brain, programs of
Dorothy Adams, and house manage
ment of Chester W. Barker.
