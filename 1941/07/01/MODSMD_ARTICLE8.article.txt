Included within the Stanford Li
brary are several rooms containing
many rare and valuable literary ex
hibits. These exhibits have been ac
quired by the University through
donations by organizations and
people.
The Bender Room was named for
Albert M. Bender. The Kelmescott
edition of Chaucer printed in Ham
mersmith is shown in this room. The
book, which was a gift from Mr.
Bender, has 87 illustrations by Sir
Edward Burne-Jones, and the bind
ing of pigskin was made by Doves
Bindery. Another book found in this
collection is one printed by Adolf
Rusch in Strasburg in 1472 and is a
summary of all the scholastic
knowledge of the age. The exhibit
also includes a first edition of "The
Rivals" by Richard Sheridan, printed
in 1775. The book was evidently
used for years as prompt book by
some English stage director in the
18th century.
The Robinson Room includes
books and exhibits dealing with the
American Constitution and Laws. It
was named for Judge Elmer E. Rob

inson of the Superior Court of San
Francisco. The early books and
charters which probably influenced
the writers of the Constitution are
shown as well as the constitutions
of the 13 states and also articles
printed at the time of the ratifica
tion of the Constitution defending it
and urging its acceptance.
The Hopkins Transportation Li
brary was named for Timothy Hop
kins, who donated most of the ex
hibits telling of the history of the
Southern Pacific Railroad. In it are
timetables, schedules, and passes
from the early days, letters of Mark
Hopkins, and a Currier and Ives
print of the first Continental train.
The Felton Library, under the su
pervision of Mrs. Shue, contains
American and British literature
from the 19th century to present
times. All the books found there are
first editions. The Alice in Wonder
land exhibit contains 13 of the 17
foreign translations of the story, in
cluding Chinese, Dutch, Gaelic, and
Hebrew. The American translation
is a second edition printed in 1866,
the first edition printed in 1865 is
not available.
