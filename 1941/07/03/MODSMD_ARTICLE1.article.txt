### 
Professor Paul R. Hanna of the
School of Education will give an
illustrated lecture on South Amer
ica Monday, July 7, in the Educa
tion Auditorium. This lecture is one
of a series sponsored by the Social
Education Workshop of the Stanford
Social Education Investigation.
Professor Hanna, as a member of
the National Resources Planning
Board, travelled extensively in
South America in the interest of
projects designed to further cultural
relations between the Americas. His
recent trip was primarily one of ex
ploration and discovery in the field
of contemporary living. He studied
the agricultural practices, fishing,
wearing, marketing, religion, and
education of the Indians of the Alta
Plana, the high plateau running
north and south in central Peru be
tween the 16,000-foot ranges of the
Andes.
On his recent South American
trip, Professor Hanna was also a
member of the Wenner-Gren Ar
cheological Expedition which visited
the lost city of Machu Picchu and
Phuya Pata Marka, the City Above
the Clouds, located near Cuzco. The
expedition also discovered a new set
of ruins of the city of Fui Phea
Marka, also in the Andes range.
The lecture will be illustrated with
natural-color Kodachrome slides
which he has taken in the South
American countries, especially Peru,
Ecuador, and Bolivia.
No admission will be charged.
