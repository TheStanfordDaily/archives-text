# 940 Enrolled For the Summer
## Undergraduate Total Approaches Grads' 
### 
For the first summer quarter in
Stanford's history the enrollment of
undergraduates is almost equal to
that of graduate students, the Reg
istrar's office announced today. Of
the 940 persons registered in the
university this quarter 45 per cent
are undergraduates and 55 per cent
are graduate students.
This summer's undergraduate en
rollment is a 63 per cent increase
over that of summer quarter 1940.
For the first time freshman
courses are being offered in the
summer by the School of Engineer
ing and by the Graduate School of
Business.
The figures released by Miss Mir
iam Remele are:
Summer quarter, 1941—518 grad
uate students, 422 undergraduates;
total, 940 enrolled. For summer
quarter, 1940 — 495 graduates, 258
undergraduates; total, 753 enrolled.
Neither of these totals includes pro
visional students. There are 187
more students registered this sum
mer than last.
"It is hard to discover any cor
relation between the increased num
ber of undergraduates registered in
the engineering school's acceleration
courses," the department secretary
declared. "There are 62 undergrad
uates enrolled in the various engi
neering departments. Of these I
cannot say which ones are here to
take advantage of the freshman
courses in engineering offered for
the first time this summer."
