# Bawlouts to Be Put On Sale Next Week
## 
### 
"Bawlouts" will be on sale in the
Administration Building the first of
next week.
"Bawlout" is the nickname given
by students years ago to what the
administration more formally calls
"Directory of Officers and Students."
The directories cost a quarter, con
tain the names and offices of all the
University's officials, faculty, assist
ants, students, and organizations.
The nickname is believed to re
sult from the fact that during the
regular school year the grade-points
of the students are presented.
