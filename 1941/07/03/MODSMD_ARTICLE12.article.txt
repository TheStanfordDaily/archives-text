An Office of Pan-American Re
lations in the Hoover Library was

Ray Lyman Wilbur. The President
said that following the South Amer
ican trips of Hoover Library Direc
tors Eliot G. Mears and Graham
Stuart a considerable increase in
South American materials has been
made possible, and to these will be
added other groups of Pan-Ameri
can materials.
Mr|. Maria MacCormack Hoge,
who has had long experience in
Latin America, has been appointed
research associate and curator in
the Hoover Library to be in charge
of the new division.
COLLECTION SEPARATE
The collection, which will be sep
arate from the others of the library,
will be circulated to be used by
students and scholars and as far as
the facilities of the library permit
will be for the use of the general
public. The collection contains pe
riodicals, documents, and reports of
conferences held with Latin Amer
ica.
The purpose of the division, an

will be for the use of the general
public. The collection contains pe
riodicals, documents, and reports of
conferences held with Latin Amer
ica.
The purpose of the division, an
nounced the President, is to extend
an understanding of the culture, the
language, and the social and eco
nomic problems of Latin America.
Ralph Haswell Lutz, chairman of
the Hoover Library Directors, said,
"The development of this division of
the library should further the cause
of hemispheric solidarity and lead to
interchange of cultural ideas be
tween various peoples of the Amer
icas." It is the belief of Dr. Mears
that the importance of the library is
to do away not so much with ig
norance as with misconception.
