# Noted Pianist Talks on Music Independence
## Joyce Barthelson Discusses Standing Of American Music 
### 
"We are the most musical coun
try in the world," said Joyce Bar
thelson, noted pianist, conductor and
composer, who spoke in the Stanford
Memorial Hall Tuesday evening.
Speaking on "Our Declaration of
Musical Independence," Miss Bar
thelson quoted Emerson: "One day
we shall cast out the passion for
Europe and have a passion for
America." Miss Barthelson said that
to the many European artists who
are taking refuge in the United
States we must speak in the man
ner of Americans, not in the man
ner of Americans who have been
influenced abroad.
Miss Barthelson divided the idioms
of our music into three divisions:
the compositions of those musicians
who have studied in and have been
influenced by Europe, jazz music
and folk music. She illustrated the
first group by discussing and play
ing some compositions of a number
of post-war American composersâ€”
Arnold Schoenberg and his "Aton
alism" or discorded music; Aaron
Copeland, with his more tonal qual
ity; Roy Harris, the most noted of
American successes; and Gail Kubik.
In speaking of jazz, Miss Barthel
son said that we tended to senti
mentalize and show self-pity in our
expression.
She concluded her program by
playing her own composition, "Bal
lad of Hosy," which is based on a
Negro dialect poem. Her interests
in music, she said, lies between the
idioms of jazz and folk song music.
Proving Miss Barthelson's statement
made earlier in the program, that
Americans liked music which they
were able to understand, Miss Bar
thelson's number was highly ap
plauded, while the compositions of
Copeland and Harris received little
ovation.
