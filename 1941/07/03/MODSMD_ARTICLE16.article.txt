# Stanford Expert Studies Defense
## 
### 
In an effort to eliminate a bottle
neck in the supply of men with spe
cialized knowledge, Stephen P.
Timoshenko, professor of theoretical
and applied mechanics, has been se
lected as a member of a staff of six
teen experts meeting at Brown Uni
versity this summer.
These sixteen men represent "the
best men available in the fields of
mathematics, engineering and phys
ics." They will have charge of sum
mer instruction and research in ap
plied mechanics at Brown Univer
sity, where special problems in de
fense industry will be studied by
prospective defense technicians.
These men have been chosen "for
their practical knowledge and expe
rience, the high degree of their past
achievements, and their grasp of the
fundamental problems in mathemat
ics which are related to defense
preparations" and are to be brought
together because they "are now so
widely scattered that their work is
relatively ineffective for instruction
purposes."
