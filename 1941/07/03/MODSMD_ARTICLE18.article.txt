# Former Farm Converted Into Campus
## 
### 
Stanford University is very often
referred to as the Farm, yet few
people realize how this name orig
inated.
When Leland Stanford Jr. was a
lad, Mr. and Mrs. Stanford purchas
ed the land, now the Stanford cam
pus, for a farm on which to breed
horses and also as a place for rec
reation for their only son. At the
untimely death of Leland Jr. the
Stanford home, which was later to
become the Stanford Convalescent
Home for crippled children, had
already been built by the Stanfords
as a home for Leland Jr. In addi
tion, they built a mansion in San
Francisco.
The part of the campus through
which Sandhill Road now runs was
the scene of many trotting races and
exhibitions by the horses raised
right here on the Farm. The exten
sive fields were planted in hay and
alfalfa.
When the Stanfords decided, "The
children of California shall be our
children," and thus to establish
Stanford, the Palo Alto farm was
the most logical site for the univer
sity. Although Palo Alto and the
entire peninsula was at that time in
a very much undeveloped state, the
Stanfords foresaw the development
that was to take place in the next 50
years.
The term Farm therefore has a
very definite source in that the pres
ent campus actually was a farm
before it became Leland Stanford
Junior University.

Theta Sigma Phi, journalism fra
ternity for women, was established
on the Farm in 1916.
