# American Federation of Art Displays Johansen Exhibition
## 
### 
Waldemar Johansen, technical di
rector of dramatics at Stanford Uni
versity, has given his exhibit on the
development of theater design over
to the American Federation of Arts
in Washington. D.C., for exhibition
in high schools, colleges, and public
libraries throughout the country.
This exhibit contains engravings
and etchings on the history of stage
design from the old baroque designs
of the Shakespearean era through
the naturalistic designs of the 1890's
and up to the abstract, three-dimen
sional stage settings of today. It also
shows application of these types of
stage designs to the modern theater.
A baroque morality play, present
ed in a series of 50 pictures and sup
plemented by costumes, set designs,
and models, completes the exhibit.
Mr. Johansen gathered much of
the material for the exhibit in Eu
rope before this war started; and
with the aid of some of his students
produced the display and presented
it in New York City and Washing
ton, D.C., before turning it over to
the American Federation of Arts.
The purpose of this exhibit is to
aid in founding a Theater Museum
at Stanford for research students.
The museum is to be housed in the
Memorial Auditorium Building, and
since there are no other theater mu
seums on the Pacific Coast, this will
be another "first" for Stanford.
