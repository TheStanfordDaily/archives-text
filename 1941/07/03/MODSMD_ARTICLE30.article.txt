# Joe DiMaggio Breaks Major League Record
## 
### 
Joe DiMaggio, prominent San
Francisco restaurateur, yesterday hit
his 18th home run of the season in
the fifth inning of the New York
Yankees' game against the Boston
Red Sox to extend his consecutive
games hitting streak to 45, which
breaks Willie Keeler's old record of
44 made in 1897.

The "Immortal 21" returned the
famous Stanford Axe to the campus
