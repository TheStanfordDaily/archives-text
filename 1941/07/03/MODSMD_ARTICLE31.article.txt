# Business School Professor Talks on Employment Problem
## 
### 
"If investment seeking funds are
inadequate, it is because of cost
price relationships, tax and public
policies, and international uncertain
ties which make people prefer to
add to their cash balances even
though they have become quite
large," said Sumner H. Slichter,
acting professor of business eco
nomics in the Graduate School of
Business. Dr. Slichter, who is an
authority on labor, spoke yesterday
in the lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse as a guest of the Wed
nesday afternoon lecture series.
SAVINGS ADJUSTMENT
Speaking on "The Problem of Full
Employment," Dr. Slichter said that
with the development of the na
tions' natural resources and with a
population increase which has
reached a peak of 16 million** we
must make an adjustment of high
saving economy in the drop of popu
lation rate and development in the
country.
Dr. Slichter said that no real the
ory of employment has been made
and that the reason for the lack of
concern of classical economists over
the question was because of the rapid
expansion of the 19th century. The
effect of unemployment was not
seen until after the first World War,
and it took the depression of 1929,
which was particularly severe in
Germany and this country, to pro
duce general theoreties of unem
ployment.
RECOVERY GREAT
As to the question of what prog
ress we have made in view of the
severity of the depression, Dr. Slich
ter said that the recovery in pro
duction is great, but artificial in the
sense that industry is government,
financial not self-supported. An
other factor in our progress since
the depression is the result of prob
lems of industry in adjusting itself
to institutional change. Business
saving has virtually disappeared, and
if increased it will be because of
growth of investment possibilities of
business enterprise.
"If we look to the future," said
Dr. Slichter, "one will expect a
smaller proportion of incomes to be
saved."
