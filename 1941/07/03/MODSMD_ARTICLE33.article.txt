# Students in Summer Become Too Healthy
## 
### 
Summer quarter students at
Stanford are so healthy that there
are no students registered in either
the Men's Rest Home or the Palo
Alto Hospital, while the Women's
Rest Home isn't even open.
This lack of illness in the student
body has caused a temporary aban
doning of the "Under the Weather"
column.
