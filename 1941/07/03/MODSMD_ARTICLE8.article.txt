# CAA Pilots Take to Air Early Because Weather Favorable
## 
### 
Taking advantage of the favorable
summer weather the Civil Aero
nautics Administration students here
at Stanford are already in the air.
With Professor Webster's early ar
rival today from Washington the
fifth consecutive C.A.A. program
here at Stanford will be in full
swing. To date approximately 210
Stanford students have taken ad
vantage of the C.A.A. program since
its institution here at Stanford two
years ago. This surprisingly high
number is explained by the fact that
Stanford has consistently had one of
the largest college C.A.A. programs
in the country.
But size is not the only way in
which the Stanford C.A.A. program
excells; the caliber of the ground
school work given by Stanford, un
der the direction of Dr. Webster, is
witnessed by the exceptionally high
average of almost 90, which the
Stanford C.A.A. students maintain in
the C.A.A. exams.
Some of this summer's C.A.A.
class, of twenty, which was com
pletely filled by noon this past Mon
day, are flying in the early morning,
some as early as 5 o'clock.
With the enthusiasm and interest
which this class of 1941 is showing
it should be the equal of any of its
predecessors.
