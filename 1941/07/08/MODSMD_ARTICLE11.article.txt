# Roads Undergo More Repairs
## Serra to Be Wider; Panama Blocked Off 
### 
Serra Street, which runs in front
of the Administration Building, will
be widened 15 feet, it was announced
Saturday by James W. McDonnell,
superintendent of grounds. Curbing
and a 5-foot sidewalk 1080 feet long
will be put in and the street will be
repaved, making it approximately 50
feet wide.
This will be another of the im
provements in the roads which have
been in progress for so many
months. The widening and paving of
Santa Teresa Street and Lomita
Drive have been the first projects
to be completed.
DIAGONAL PARKING
Mr. McDonnell said that diagonal
parking will then be instituted to in
crease parking space. To provide the
necessary space 28 spear-leaved
dracaena palms which now line
Serra Street will be removed. The
street widening will create a boule
vard f*>m the newly improved Lo
mita Drive on the west past the
Hoover Library to Galvez Street at
Encina on the east. Repair work is
also being done on Panama Street,
and posts will prohibit any through
traffic.
The bare area west of the Quad
between the buildings and the new
route of Lomita will be landscaped,
