# New Comedy Cast Named
## 
### 
Cowles F. Strickland, dramatics
director, has announced the casting
of the remaining characters of
"Where the Dear Antelope Play," to
be presented by the Stanford Play
ers July 16 to 19 in Memorial Hall.
Agnes Hoffman will play the part
of May Shroud, Nicolas Vogulkin
will enact the role of Bellastair
Hicks, and the role of T-bone will be
played by Hubert Heffner 11.
The selection of "Where the Dear
Antelope Play," a humorous satire
on how culture comes to "Indian
City," Texas and how the natives
react to its influences, is being pro
duced by the Stanford Players in an
effort to do new plays written for
university and community theaters
rather than reproduce Broadway
hits, written to please Broadway
audiences.
Dr. Hubert Heffner of the Speech
and Drama department stated, "The
Stanford Players wish to be a pro
ducing and not merely a repro
ducing theater."
Realizing the number of plays
produced on Broadway during the
last 15 years has dropped about 80
per cent, and that modern play
wrights are having an increasingly
difficult time in having their work
staged. Dr. Heffner added, "Most
non-professional theater organiza
tions merely reproduce Broadway
hits. It is our hope not only to
present worthily the great plays of
the past, but to offer opportunities
to playwrights of the future."
"Where the Dear Antelope Play"
was written by John William Rog
ers of Dallas, Texas, and was staged
by him at the Dallas Little Theater.
Since then it has been revised and
polished by the author, and it is be
ing produced in its present form for
the first time by the Stanford
Players. For this reason both New
York and Hollywood producers, as
well as the author, are anticipating
the presentation on the Stanford
campus.
