# Five Softball Games Scheduled
## Holiday Forces Postponement 
### 
The summer softball season will
finally get under way this afternoon
with five games scheduled. Origi
nally the league was to start play
last Thursday but the three-day
holiday forced postponement of the
games.
The league has been cut down to
ten teams with the Ingineers drop
ping out and the New Dealers and
Prune Pickers consolidating into the
New Deal Prune Pickers.
Following are today's games: Spar
Ducks vs. N.D.P.P. on field 1; Toro
Dons vs. Legal Eagles on field 4;
Socialists vs. Slave Drivers on field
6; Greasy Spoons vs. Igerodians on
field 2; Biz School vs. Lab Rats on
field 5.
The last named game will offer
the added attraction of two fem
inine sluggers which decorate the
Lab Hats roster. There are no defi
nite pre-season favorites. However,
the Spar Ducks won last year and
several of their stars are returning.
