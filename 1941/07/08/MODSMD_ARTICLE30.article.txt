# Farm Sponsors Golf Tourney
## Victorious Linksmen Return to Stanford 
### 
Stanford's golf team will return to
the Farm this week after their suc
cessful tour of the Middle West to
compete in the Stanford Invitational
Tournament which opens next Sat
urday on the local course.
Bud Brownell, Warren Berl, Gor
don Hough, and Sandy Tatum will
all return to take on the cream of
the Northern California amateur
crop. Bud Finger, however, will be
unable to be here and thereby un
able to defend the title which he
won last year.
After winning the N.C.A.A. team
title Brownell, Berl, Hough Tatum,
and Dee Replogle all qualified eas
ily in the Western Open but were
put out in the course of the match
play. Brownell and Hough, both of
whom led the first day of medal
play, succumbed in the first round,
while Tatum went down in the sec
ond round and Replogle and Berl, a
semi-finalist last year, were elimi
nated in the third round of the
tournament which saw Marvin
"Bud" Ward victorious.
