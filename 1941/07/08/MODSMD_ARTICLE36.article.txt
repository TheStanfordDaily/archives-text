# Hope, Lamour In Draft Film
## 
### 
"Caught in the Draft," now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
Excellent entertainment. Dorothy
Lamour and Bob Hope score a di
rect hit. This time Dottie has drop
ped the sarong and shouldered the
gun. She's the colonel's daughter
who collects Bob Hope, the nation's
No. 1 movie heart throb as a draftee
for Uncle Sam.
Bob as Private Bolton gets the
laughs as he stumbles in and out of
the tank corps, the parachute divi
sion, the hospital, and finally winds
up a corporal (in order to prove he
is soldier enough to win Dottie.)
This is propaganda for the U. S.
Army but sugar-coated with relax
ing humor and fast-moving.
"West Point Widow" — Maudlin
bit concerning a nurse (Ann Shir
ley) who has a baby fathered by a
West Point cadet. She's deserted by
the cadet and saved by a young
doctor. Silly plot plus B feature
acting equals dull movie. — Katie
