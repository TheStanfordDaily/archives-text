# Dennes to Discuss Reason in War
## 
### 
William R. Dennes, acting pro
fessor of philosophy, will speak on
"The Role of Reason in a World
War" tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
in the lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse.
Dr. Dennes will consider certain
respects in which the major conflict
and troubles in the world today are
not due to the enemies of rationality
but to confusion on the part of the
leaders of intellectual tradition.
He will suggest some means by
which this confusion and crooked
thinking may be corrected.
