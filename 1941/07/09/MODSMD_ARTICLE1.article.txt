# School of Law To Open Meet On Taxation
## Over 100 Attorneys To Attend; Week-end Of Lectures Planned 
### 
It will be back to school tomorrow
for over a hundred attorneys as
Dean Kirkwood of Stanford Law
School opens the conference on tax
ation. No time will be wasted, the
first lecture starting less than an
hour after registration at 9:30 Fri
day morning.
Although golf, tennis, and swim
ming facilities are being provided
for the visitors, they will have little
time for play. There will be lectures
or discussions from 9 to 9 Friday
and Saturday and until 4 Sunday,
with time out for meals only.
CANVASS OF LAWYERS
The program was arranged after
a canvass of many lawyers. The
purpose is to aid the general prac
titioner in the sort of tax problems
which come up in his daily work.
All phases of contemporary taxa
tion problems will be discussed with
special emphasis on the federal tax
ation. Arthur H. Kent, acting chief
counsel, Bureau of Internal Reve
nue and assistant general counsel,
U.S. Treasury Department, will pre
sent the very latest developments in
his paper, "New and Pending Legis
lation on Corporate Business." Busi
ness in Washington will prevent his
being here in person, but the paper
will be read.
TAX DISCUSSION
The unique feature of the confer
ence will occur the second day. Jo
seph D. Peeler, Walter L. Nossaman,
Joseph D. Brady, and Elmo H. Con
ley, the four most prominent tax
experts on the Coast, will conduct a
panel discussion of tax and other
considerations in the drafting of
trusts and disposition of estates.
Each member will present his solu
tion to the problem assigned him.
After each presentation, the other
members of the panel will make
criticisms and suggestions.
Sunday morning, Joseph D. Peeler
will talk on property valuation for
death and gift taxes, a subject that
no law school gives. Usually each
lawyer has to learn for himself by
experience.
"This," said Professor Lowell Tur
rentine, chairman of the program
committee, "is the great value of this
conference. It gives the practicing
attorneys a chance to learn from the
authorities in the field." These
speakers will receive nothing for
their time but present what they
have learned the same as doctors
offer the results of experimentation
at medical conventions."
Justice Roger J. Traynor of the
California Supreme Court will pre
side at dinner Sunday noon.
A paper on recent income tax de
cisions by Joseph D. Brady at 2:45
will conclude the lecture.
