# Limon, O'Donnell to Follow Silverman on Series
## Science Editor Gives Talk On South America 
### 
Unless the present war lasts 10
years, no raw materials in important
quantities are going to reach the
United States from South America
in time to be of use, Dr. Milton Sil
verman, science editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, told his audi
ence Tuesday night in the Stanford
Memorial Hall.
South America is a continent of
vast resources and "the world's
next great scientific and economic
test tube," Dr. Silverman predicted,
but transportation is very inadequate
and scientifically the continent lags
so far that it cannot make its re
sources available.
TRANSPORTATION POOR
Dr. Silverman cited the "half mil
lion" quinine trees in Colombia, the
only important forest remaining, and
so far up in the Andes that there
is no road by which to reach them.
"In this connection he pointed to
one of the great dangers to the
United States of spread of the war
to the Pacific. The nation imports
95 per cent of its supply from the
Dutch East Indies. It now has
enough on hand to last only 5 or 10
months, and the next crop will not
be harvested until November.
Meanwhile there are "at least"
2,000,000 cases of malaria in the
United States and its possessions
each year, and 100,000 deaths result
ing, Dr. Silverman said.
What South America needs is a
general scientific development, with
workers scattered everywhere, and
there is a special need for adequate
libraries, Dr. Silverman said.
Dr. Silverman then reviewed de
velopments from Stanford's protein
research conference of two weeks
ago.
TEST TUBE PROTEINS
Proteins are the greatest scientific
challenge of all, he said, and he
pointed to two announcements of
possible vast import made at the
conference. The first was that a
little progress has been made in de
termining the chemical nature of fil
terable viruses, which are disease
producing proteins; the second, that
first steps have been taken toward
producing proteins in a test tube.
"You can hope," Dr. Silverman
told the audience, "that man can
create his own disease-producing
organisms and learn how to kill
them; that he can produce hormones
in great quantities and supply them
to patients needing them."

Unless the present war lasts 10
years, no raw materials in important
quantities are going to reach the
United States from South America
in time to be of use, Dr. Milton Sil
verman, science editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, told his audi
ence Tuesday night in the Stanford
Memorial Hall.
South America is a continent of
vast resources and "the world's
next great scientific and economic
test tube," Dr. Silverman predicted,
but transportation is very inadequate
and scientifically the continent lags
so far that it cannot make its re
sources available.
TRANSPORTATION POOR
Dr. Silverman cited the "half mil
lion" quinine trees in Colombia, the
only important forest remaining, and
so far up in the Andes that there
is no road by which to reach them.
"In this connection he pointed to
one of the great dangers to the
United States of spread of the war
to the Pacific. The nation imports
95 per cent of its supply from the
Dutch East Indies. It now has
enough on hand to last only 5 or 10
months, and the next crop will not
be harvested until November.
Meanwhile there are "at least"
2,000,000 cases of malaria in the
United States and its possessions
each year, and 100,000 deaths result
ing, Dr. Silverman said.
What South America needs is a
general scientific development, with
workers scattered everywhere, and
there is a special need for adequate
libraries, Dr. Silverman said.
Dr. Silverman then reviewed de
velopments from Stanford's protein
research conference of two weeks
ago.
TEST TUBE PROTEINS
Proteins are the greatest scientific
challenge of all, he said, and he
pointed to two announcements of
possible vast import made at the
conference. The first was that a
little progress has been made in de
termining the chemical nature of fil
terable viruses, which are disease
producing proteins; the second, that
first steps have been taken toward
producing proteins in a test tube.
"You can hope," Dr. Silverman
told the audience, "that man can
create his own disease-producing
organisms and learn how to kill
them; that he can produce hormones
in great quantities and supply them
to patients needing them."
