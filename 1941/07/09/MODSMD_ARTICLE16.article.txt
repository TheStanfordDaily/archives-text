# Drama Department Primes For 'The Dear Antelope Play'
## 
### 
With the production by the Stan-*
ford Players of "Where the Dear
Antelope Play" less than a week
away, rehearsals are being held ev
ery day and night in Memorial Hall,
while set and costume crews are
creating elaborate backgrounds for
the comical satire.
The setting is an old Victorian
house in "Indian City," Texas, the
home of a conservative banker.
When interior decorators discover
the elaborate olive green interior,
they immediately want to tear out
the ornate mahogany decorations,
the heavily flowered wallpaper, the
gilt mirrors, and just generally tear
out until nothing is left, much to the
dismay of the whole family.
ANGULAR CHARACTER
The greatest costuming problem is
that of T-bone, a slow-plodding
Negro who accentuates the comedy
with his angular characteristics.
Other than T-bone, the male char
acters run true to the form of a
"pretty" interior decorator, a con
servative, elderly banker, and his
young banking son.
Grandma, probably the most in

►teresting character both in acting
and make-up, is giving Miss Hazel
Brain, who is costuming the show,
a slight headache. She just can't
find a dinner dress suitable for a
firm-minded Victorian lady of 70
years.
STYLES VARY
Mrs. Wiggin, the club organizer,
makes the most of her nearly 200
pounds as far as her costumes go.
The gay young daughter just home
from college reflects her ultra
modern ideas in the clothes she
wears. Other female characters are
costumed in a typical small-town
style.
Waldemar Johansen is in charge of
the sets.
"Where the Dear Antelope Play"
will be presented July 16-19 in the
auditorium of Memorial Hall at 8:15
p.m. Tickets are 50 cents.
