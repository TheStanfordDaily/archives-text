# Trueblood to Lead Vesper Services
## 
### 
The only vesper service to be
given this summer will be held
Sunday, July 14, 4:30-5 p.m., in the
Frost Amphitheater. Services will
be conducted by Dr. Trueblood, the
University chaplain. The subject is
to be "Faith of the Modern Youth."
Chairs will not be provided, and
those who wish something to sit on
should bring chairs or blankets.
This is to be the first and only ves
per service that will be given this
summer and extensive plans have
been made for the occasion. There
will be a brass choir to play the
hymns and fanfare. The thought be
hind the vesper service, according to
Dr. Trueblood, is "to institute more
use of the amphitheater."
