The 1941 Summer Softball League
got under way Tuesday afternoon
with the defending champions com
ing from behind to take their game,
a show of heavy hitting, a shutout, a
forfeit, and a postponement.
A potentially strong New Deal
Prune Pickers team led through
most of their game with the Spar
Ducks but were edged out in the
final innings, 2 to 1. Bill Weeden,
manager of the Greasy Spoons,
pitched shutout ball to lead his
mates to a 3 to 0 win over the Igero
dians. In the other game played the
Socialists walloped the Slave Driv
ers, 6 to 1.
The Biz School defaulted to the
Lab Rats and the Toro Don-Legal
Eagle game was called off since
neither team showed up.
Another strong aggregation has
been entered under the name Fire
eaters. They will be drafted into
the new schedule soon.
