# Hudson Gives Sneak Preview Of New Erasmus Translation
## 
### 
A sneak preview hearing of
Erasmus' "Praise of Folly" was given
at the English Review Club meeting
Tuesday afternoon. Dr. H. H. Hud
son, visiting professor of English
from Princeton University, read
from galley proofs of his book that
will be published this fall by the
Princeton University Press.
"Praise of Folly," Dr. Hudson
pointed out, has a very interesting
background. Erasmus drew directly
or indirectly from "The Ship of
Fools" written in German. A Dutch
writer translated this book into
Dutch, enlarging it because he
thought not enough women had been
allowed on board.
He added six ships just for wom
en. A French translation provided
room for even more women. A later
English translation discovered that
there were many types of fools in
England that evidently did not exist
in Germany, Flanders, or France.
After Dr. Hudson finished his
talk, Dr. Dodds, acting head of the
English department, said that it re
minded him of a remark of Erasmus
that he used to keep in mind when
he was working for his Ph.D. "When
you have to do with asses, assume
the lion's skin."
