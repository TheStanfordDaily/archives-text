# Art Gallery Offers Far Eastern Exhibit
## 
### 
Every student interested in art
will find during the summer a very
cultural and educational exhibit at
the Stanford Art Gallery of the Far
Eastern and European Art in the
numerous collections of Mortimer C.
Leventritt. At the outbreak of the
war in Europe he was able, with
little difficulty, to return with these
contributions, which will be price
less in years to come. Leventritt
was a graduate of Stanford in 1899
and has spent most of his life in
Europe preparing his many prized
exhibits.
Books and Goya etchings are in
the Stanford library, offering a re
search of his collections.
