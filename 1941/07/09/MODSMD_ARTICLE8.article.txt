# Dr. Bailey Turns Publisher In Basement Printing Office
## 
### 
Dr. Margery Bailey, associate pro
fessor of English, is conducting a
printing establishment on the side
in her office in the basement of the
English Corner. With a mimeograph
machine she publishes three pam
phlets each summer quarter in con
nection with the School of Letters.
One pamphlet contains the pro
grams, which have extensive notes,
and reviews of all the presentations,
plays and lectures, sponsored by the
Dramatists' Alliance during the
summer quarter.
Another publication, "Asides,"
contains articles on drama. This
summer a biographical sketch and
bibliography of an American author,
John Temples, will be included.
A special booklet this summer
will include a survey of famous au
thors, playwrights, journalists, and
script writers who have graduated
from Stanford. Some of the work
they did while in college will be re
printed with bibliographies and
of their recent works.
Among the writers who will be
included in the publication are
Maxwell Anderson, Will and Wal

'lace Irwin, Archie Binns, Howard
Peas, Aurania Rouverol, Frank Hill,
Florence Clements, and John Stein
beck.
Dr. Bailey's mimeograph machine
was a gift to her from some of her
former students on her birthday,
which she recently celebrated with
the University.
