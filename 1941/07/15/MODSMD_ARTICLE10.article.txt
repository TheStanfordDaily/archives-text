# 'Dear Antelope' Opens 4 Night Run Tomorrow
## Experienced Cast Primes in Setting Of Victorian Horror 
### 
Scheduled to hit the boards in
the Little Theater of Memorial Hall
tomorrow at 8:15 for a four-night
run, the first summer production of
the Stanford Players, "Where the
Dear Antelope Play" is a hilarious
satire of how culture and interior
decorators invade Indian City,
Texas.
In a setting of accumulated Vic
torian era horror—gingerbread ma
hogany, an atrocious gilt chandelier,
terrific plushes and whatnots —an
unusually experienced cast is go
ing through its final paces, and
"looks in pretty shape at this point,"
F. Cowles Strickland, director, said
yesterday.
Most members of the cast are ex
perienced actors, advanced students,
and teachers of dramatics attending
summer session, so the play prom
ises to have an edge on most cam
pus casts.
A great deal of action takes place
on the wide staircase at the rear of
the stage. Once the interior decora
tors get into the home of the con
servative banker, a member of the
North Texas gentry, there is a ter
rific struggle by members of the
family, particularly Grandma, to
keep them and their revolutionary
ideas on the first floor.
Waldemar Johansen, technical di
rector, is especially proud of the
amazingly ornate clock he discov
ered with little whatnot shelves all
over it. When the female interior
decorator spies it she exclaims, "I
didn't suppose there was still one of
those in existence!"
