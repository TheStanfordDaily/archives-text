# $100,000 Carillon Reminder Of Belgian People's Gratitude
## 
### 
The carillon of the Hoover Li
brary, a gift from the Belgian gov
ernment to Herbert Hoover, will
serve as a perpetual reminder of
the gratitude of those people to their
benefactor in the last war.
The $100,000 carillon was brought
from the Belgian pavilion at the
New York World's Fair and includes
18,000 pounds of bells and playing
equipment.
The largest of the 35 bells is a
G-sharp bell weighing 1,350 pounds.
Three octaves above it is the small
est of the bells, also a G-sharp,
which weighs only 25 pounds. On
the Bourdon bell is an inscription in
Latin which when translated reads,
"Because I am named Leopold I
ring only for peace over the Atlantic
Ocean." The carillon was installed
by Kamiel Lefevere, one of the
world's greatest carilloneurs.
The carillon is mounted on an
open belfry occupying a space 20
feet long and 20 feet wide and 18
feet high. The bells hang in rows.
The machinery that operates the
bells is on the floor below. The
player pushes on one of the handles
which in turn pulls a wire which is
connected to the clapper of one of
the bells on the above floor. The
set can also be controlled elec
trically.
The bells, which were cast by the
famous firm of Marcel Mechels of
Tournai, Belgium, are unusually
clear in tone and on them can be
played any tone suitable for the
carillon. They are tuned to the
five-tone harmonic principle.
The original purpose of the Eu
ropean carillon was to announce the
time for town activities. Different
tunes indicated the closing of the
gates, opening of the markets, and
other special festivities.

which in turn pulls a wire which is
connected to the clapper of one of
the bells on the above floor. The
set can also be controlled elec
trically.
The bells, which were cast by the
famous firm of Marcel Mechels of
Tournai, Belgium, are unusually
clear in tone and on them can be
played any tone suitable for the
carillon. They are tuned to the
five-tone harmonic principle.
The original purpose of the Eu
ropean carillon was to announce the
time for town activities. Different
tunes indicated the closing of the
gates, opening of the markets, and
other special festivities.
