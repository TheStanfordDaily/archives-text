"We want to get as many students
as possible into the activities of the
school," declared Mary Merner,
vice-president of the student body
and head of the Women's Council
for the summer quarter.
"The Women's Council in the
summer is less restricted and is
more concerned with education
about the Honor Code for the bene
fit of the new students, who are
greater in proportion in the summer
than during the other quarters of
the year," said Miss Merner. Betty
Dyer and Una McCallers have been
recently appointed to Women's
Council. The Council takes over the
duties of the Women's Conference,
which meets during the other quar
ters, and assembles with the Men's
Council to form the Ex Committee.
The Ex-Committee meets every
Monday evening at 7:30 o'clock and
is opened to the general student
body.
Miss Merner stressed the fact that
the Council, which meets weekly,
welcomes the suggestions and opin
ions of the students. It would be
helpful if students with complaints
would take these up with the Coun
cil instead of uselessly complaining
without taking action, for the duty of
the Council is not only to maintain
but to improve rules.
