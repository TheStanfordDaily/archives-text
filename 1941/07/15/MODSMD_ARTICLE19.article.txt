# Council Penalizes Careless Students
## 
### 
Men's Council reports that there
are still many students who have
neglected to show up at the ap
pointed time to answer for their
traffic violations and that they will
be fined for each week they are
late.
During this last week ten stu
dents received parking tickets, two
received tickets for failure to ob
serve arterial stops, and one re
ceived a ticket for passing at an
intersection.
The police report that many
have failed to make the stops lately,
but only two were flagrant enough
to warrant citations, and that many
students still haven't placed their
registration slips in the driver's
compartment of their cars.
All non-student violators were
sent to the Palo Alto Police Court
to answer for their violations.
