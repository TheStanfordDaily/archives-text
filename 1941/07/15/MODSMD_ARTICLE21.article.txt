# Dilley Puppets Give 'Bean Boy'
## 175 Children Watch Performance of Play 
### 
Approximately 175 children and a
generous sprinkling of adults had a
hilarious time on the campus last
Saturday when Perry Dilley's fam
ous puppets gave two performances
of "The Bean Boy" in the Women's
Clubhouse theater.
In a beautiful setting bathed by
bright Spanish sunlight, String, the
simple bean boy, performed his
marvelous deeds and stole the gov
ernor's daughter's dream from the
Sandman. Adults and children
alike grew tense and were delighted
by the "chase" from the Sandman's
cave.
The art of puppetry, believed to be
the first form of theatrical art in
many parts of the world, will be dis
cussed by Mr. Dilley on August 14
at a Dramatists' Alliance session on
the children's theater.
"The Bean Boy," a California

fairy tale by Monica Shannon,
combined in a quaint and whimsical
manner the qualities of folklore,
music, and drama.
