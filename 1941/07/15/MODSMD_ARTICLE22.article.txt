## Farm Golfers Take Matches In Invitational Semi-finals Slated For July 19; Finals To Follow on Sunday 
### 
After two days of medal play and
one of match, two present Farm
golfing stars and two former Indian
football greats remain to uphold the
host institution in the annual Stan
ford Invitational golf tourney.
Bud Brownell, No. 1 varsity golfer
at present, and Frank McCann, No.
1 frosh golfer last year, came
through Sunday with victories over
their first round opponents in the
championship flight of the tourna
ment, after easily qualifying Satur
day with scores of 73 and 75, re
spectively.
Brownell took the measure of
Mat Palacio, one of Northern Cali
fornia's foremost amateurs, 1-up,
while McCann defeated Bill Boyd,
2 and 1.
Medalist Tal Smith, who led all
qualifying Friday and Saturday
with a par 72, and John Kohler,
who tied Brownell at 73, were other
outstanding tee men to come
through the first round of match
play unscathed.
Down in the first, second, and
third flights four ex-Stanford grid
men went to the wars Sunday, but
only half that number came out
ahead. They were Hal McCreery in
the first flight and all-time Ail-
American Ernie Nevers in the sec
ond flight, while Vow Boys "Bones"
Hamilton and Biff Hoffman, who also
starred in track, were eliminated.
Quarter - final and semi - final
matches will be played next Satur
day with the 36-hole finals on Sun
day. Bud Finger, who won the title
last year, and Warren Berl, '38 and
'39 winner, were not able to be on
hand to try for another crown.
