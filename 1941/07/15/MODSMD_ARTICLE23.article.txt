# Stanfordites Lose Western Net Title
## 
### 
Larry Dee and Jimmy Wade,
Stanford's top doubles combination,
after sweeping through the first set
succumbed in the next three to lose
to Don McNeil and Billy Talbert in
the finals of the Western Tennis
Championships at Indianapolis Sun
day, 1-6, 8-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Although the Indian duo defeated
the same team last week to win the
Southern title they were no match
for the Oklahoma City and Cincin
nati aces today.
