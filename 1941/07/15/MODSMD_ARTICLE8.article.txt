# Excom Revives Popular Films
## 
### 
Edward Arnold in "Diamond Jim
Brady" will be the first of the popu
lar old films to be revived in a Sun
day evening series sponsored by
Excom. Companion feature will be
"Nick Carter Detective." The
movies will be shown in the Educa
tion Auditorium, beginning July 20,
with admission price set at 15 cents
per person. If they support them
selves financially, they will continue
throughout the quarter, it was an
nounced. Starting at 8:30 p.m., they
will be out in time for campus
women to make the 10:30 deadline.
"I hope all the summer quarter
grads and undergrads will give this
affair as much support as they did
Thursday's jolly-up and Saturday's
beach party, both of which were
very successful," commented John
ny Ryan, chairman of Excom's social
committee, yesterday. Details will
appear in Thursday's Stanford
Daily.
