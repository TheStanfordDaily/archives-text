# Kent Addresses Lawyers At Taxation Conference
## Assistant General Counsel Speaks On Ways and Means Committee 
### 
Charging the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representa
tives with "political timidity" in their proposals for the 1941 Revenue Bill,
Arthur H. Kent, assistant general counsel of the Treasury Department,
told a taxation conference audience here Saturday afternoon that the bill
in its present state is inadequate in the light of the present national emer-

gency.
"I do not mean to imply that the
total revenue it will provide is ex
cessive," the tax expert told the
lawyers. "On the contrary, huge as
it is, it is modest in the light of the
astronomical figures defense appro
priations are reaching.
"A course of inquietude is that
the sums appropriated are not be
ing spent as rapidly as they must be
if national security in the present
world situation is to be achieved,"
he continued.
"Another cause for concern is the
lack of any apparent disposition in
high quarters to trim non-defense
expenditures to the bone, both in
the interests of national fiscal solv
ency and as a brake to inflation,"
Mr. Kent declared.
Not over 15 per cent of the
American population will be di
rectly affected by the proposed in
crease in taxes, the expert said, and
the low income groups will suffer
more from severe price inflation
than they could possibly suffer by
taxes on purchasing power heavy
enough to avert inflation.
Dissecting the proposed 1941 bill,
Mr. Kent outlined the following
major changes in stipulations of the
committee:
In the personal income tax the
normal tax remains 4 per cent, plus
10 per cent defense tax imposed by
the Revenue Act of 1940. In the
lower income brackets the 1941
taxes will be increased three-fold,
Mr. Kent predicted.
Opening Friday with a discussion
by Professor Paul W. Bruton on es
tate, inheritance, and gift taxes, the
conference included reports by au
thorities from California and the
nation on the various technical as
pects of taxation.
Speakers for the three-day ses
sion included Professors Paul W.
Bruton, Stanley Morrison, and David
Tannenbaum, Walter L. Nossaman,
Joseph D. Peeler, Joseph D. Brady,
Elmo H. Conley, Francis Price,
Lucien Shaw, Albert T. Shine, John
W. Parker, Francis N. Marshall, and
Alvin P. Jacobs, assistants inherit
ance tax attorney of California, who
discussed California tax problems.

priations are reaching.
"A course of inquietude is that
the sums appropriated are not be
ing spent as rapidly as they must be
if national security in the present
world situation is to be achieved,"
he continued.
"Another cause for concern is the
lack of any apparent disposition in
high quarters to trim non-defense
expenditures to the bone, both in
the interests of national fiscal solv
ency and as a brake to inflation,"
Mr. Kent declared.
Not over 15 per cent of the
American population will be di
rectly affected by the proposed in
crease in taxes, the expert said, and
the low income groups will suffer
more from severe price inflation
than they could possibly suffer by
taxes on purchasing power heavy
enough to avert inflation.
Dissecting the proposed 1941 bill,
Mr. Kent outlined the following
major changes in stipulations of the
committee:
In the personal income tax the
normal tax remains 4 per cent, plus
10 per cent defense tax imposed by
the Revenue Act of 1940. In the
lower income brackets the 1941
taxes will be increased three-fold,
Mr. Kent predicted.

Charging the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representa
tives with "political timidity" in their proposals for the 1941 Revenue Bill,
Arthur H. Kent, assistant general counsel of the Treasury Department,
told a taxation conference audience here Saturday afternoon that the bill
in its present state is inadequate in the light of the present national emer-

gency.
"I do not mean to imply that the
total revenue it will provide is ex
cessive," the tax expert told the
lawyers. "On the contrary, huge as
it is, it is modest in the light of the
astronomical figures defense appro
priations are reaching.
