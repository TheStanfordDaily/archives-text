ning in the education auditorium

"The national emergency
rightfully claims the attention
of educators at the present
time," Dean Kefauver said in
a foreword in the conference
bulletin.
"Many new problems face
teachers and administrators,"
he continued. "To make a
maximum contribution to the
strength of our nation, these
problems must be faced cour
ageously and expeditiously."
The task of the educator in
a world emergency is not
limited to the handling of the

immediate problems, Dean Kefau
ver said. The conference on educa
tion for the national emergency and
after will deal with both the emer
gency and the long-term task of the
schools.
"We should like to have sum
maries to be presented at the close
of the conference reflective of the
thinking of those in attendance," he
declared. "We encourage this year,
as in former years, speakers and

participants in discussions to pres
ent their own best thinking even
though it differs sharply from the
thinking of others in the groups.
"It is our desire," Dr. Kefauver
continued, "that the program of the
university encourage such inde
pendence of thought and expression.
It would please us very much if all
important viewpoints can be pre
sented in the various discussions."

sions planned for the afternoon.

ning in the education auditorium

of Western Hemispheric Solidarity"
with Paul R. Hanna as chairman.
Ernesto Galarza, who is flying from

ion in Washington to be present for

"The national emergency
rightfully claims the attention
of educators at the present
time," Dean Kefauver said in
a foreword in the conference
bulletin.
"Many new problems face
teachers and administrators,"
he continued. "To make a
maximum contribution to the
strength of our nation, these
problems must be faced cour
ageously and expeditiously."
The task of the educator in
a world emergency is not
limited to the handling of the

immediate problems, Dean Kefau
ver said. The conference on educa
tion for the national emergency and
after will deal with both the emer
gency and the long-term task of the
schools.
"We should like to have sum
maries to be presented at the close
of the conference reflective of the
thinking of those in attendance," he
declared. "We encourage this year,
as in former years, speakers and

participants in discussions to pres
ent their own best thinking even
though it differs sharply from the
thinking of others in the groups.
"It is our desire," Dr. Kefauver
continued, "that the program of the
university encourage such inde
pendence of thought and expression.
It would please us very much if all
important viewpoints can be pre
sented in the various discussions."
