# 'Dear Antelope' Proves Comical Texan Satiric
## Farm Players Plan Three More Shows Of Rogers' Comedy 
### 
The first production of "Where the
Dear Antelope Play," a comedy
written by John William Rogers, a
young Texan, outside its own state,
as given by the Stanford Players
last night in the first performance
of a four-evening run at the Memo
rial Hall Little Theater, turned out
to be a fairly amusing vehicle that
showed to an advantage the stage
setting artistry of Waldemar Johan
sen and the eagle-eyed directing of
F. Cowles Strickland.
All the action of the play takes
place in the living room of the
Mather home, show place of Indian
City, Texas, 10 years ago, but which
is termed by the younger element
in the play as an example of "Vic
torian skullduggery." It is this skull
duggery that Mr. Johansen deals
with from the ginger-breaded
mouldings down to the doilies and
stained glass window.
ACCENT PLEASING
Mary McClerkin, portrayer of
Angelique, home - from - college
daughter, wears the most pleasing
of the many Southwestern accents
that are generously sprinkled
throughout the characters. She also
does not seem to experience the
trouble with her footwork that oth
ers of the cast are plagued with.
Helen Bornschein, eccentric
grandma, tends to overact, but evi
dently Mr. Rogers' figmented grand
ma did too. Jo Morgan, as the visit
ing luminary, Mrs. Wiggan, fills her
part more than adequately and sup
plies most of the scattered laughs of
the evening.
CHARACTERS UNUSUAL
Thomas C. Flynn, the father and
town pillar, and Eleanor Bilsbor
row, the usual doesn't-know-what
to-think-of-it-all wife, supply ma
terial for the more unusual charac
ters to weave in and out of. As T-
Bone, the Mather's man, Hubert
Heffner 11, rounds out the house
hold in a shuffling, mumbling man
ner.
Barbara Georgia Haviland and
Nicolas Vogulkin give excellent por
trayals of two competing interior
decorators. Hank Claflin performs
the double job of telling pa how to
run his business while dating daugh
ter. Marie Carr and Agnes Hoffman
are well cast as small town busy
body-socialites.â€”H. D. T.
