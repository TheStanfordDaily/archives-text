# Socialists Face Moffett Field
## Greasy Spoons Beat Spar Ducks by 4-3 
### 
The idea of having our intra
mural teams play those of Moffett
Field has aroused a lot of comment,
according to Clayton Frye, league
adviser, and the Socialists are sched
uled to play there next Wednesday
evening.
Greasy Spoons defeated Spar
Ducks 4-3 in an unofficial game be
tween the two league leaders, but
as it was unofficial, it will not affect
the league standings.
Igerodians defeated Slave Driv
ers 10-5 in a closer game than the
score indicates. In the other games
New Deal Prune Pickers defeated
Biz School 8-3 and Lab Rats beat
Socialists 8-6.
