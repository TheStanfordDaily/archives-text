# 'Ghosts' Opens Run at Hillbarn
## Dr. Margery Bailey Plays Lead in Drama 
### 
"Ghosts," a realistic drama by
Henrik Ibsen, seeking to show the
effects of heredity, opens tonight at
8:30 at the Hillbarn Theater, an as
sociation of Stanford graduates, for
a four-night run.
"Ghosts" is one of Ibsen's nu
merous plays which worked toward
promoting women's freedom. Al
though the problem of Mrs. Alving
in the play is not a great problem
today, it was in the late 19th cen
tury when Ibsen wrote, and was a
revolutionary stage subject then.
Mrs. Alving, played by Dr. Mar
gery Bailey of the English depart
ment, endures untold tortures from
her alcoholic husband and watches
her only son become tainted under
his father's influences. "Ghosts" is
the story of her moral struggles and
her final decision to remain with
her husband.
On July 26 the same company
will bring "Ghosts" to the campus
for presentation in the Education
Auditorium at 8:15 p.m.
Robert Braums, director of the
Hillbarn Theater, will play the role
of Oswald, Mrs. Alving's son. Ralph
Schram is directing the play, and
sets and costumes have been de
signed and executed by Sam Ralph.
Hillbarn Theater is reached by
traveling on El Camino Real, High
way 101, to the Belmont-San Mateo
boundary line, and turning up the
hill road there. Admission price is
50 cents.
