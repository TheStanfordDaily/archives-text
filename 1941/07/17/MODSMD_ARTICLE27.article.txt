# Law Conference Termed Success
## 
### 
The first Stanford law conference
last week-end was pronounced a
success by Dean M. R. Kirkwood
and Professor Lowell Turrentine, in
charge of arrangements, and plans
are already being made for another
conference next year.
Significant were the panel discus
sions on the disposition of estates
and the paper on federal tax legisla
tion by Arthur H. Kent, read by
Professor George Osborne.
Nearly 300 lawyers from Califor
nia, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and
Washington attended.
