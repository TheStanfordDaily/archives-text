## 
### 
Those who have temporarily ex-<
hausted the possibilities of enter
tainment in Palo Alto and vicinity
may find interesting diversion in San
Francisco.
For example, her art galleries—
Courvoisier, Legion of Honor, and
DeYoung at which is now being
shown a shipment of French water
colors, recently on exhibition in
South America.
Or for fun and frolic in the City,
there are the concessions at the
beach, the picturesque restaurants,
the international settlements such as
Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, the
speedboat ride around San Fran
cisco Bay.
Those who find the weather warm
might enjoy the beaches — Half
Moon Bay, Rio del Mar, Carmel
which is furthest from the campus—
a three-hour drive. The other two
may be reached in approximately
one hour. At Carmel there is not
only an attractive beach but the
Carmel Mission, center of an early
California settlement.
In the immediate surroundings are
such points of interest as the Win-

Chester Mystery House, the Lick
Observatory, and Mount Hamilton.
In the heart of the Santa Clara val
ley are the quicksilver mines of
Guadalupe and New Almaden, sec
ond largest in the world. During a
century of operation it has yielded
100 million dollars worth of quick
silver.
These are only a few of the
things to do and see in the vicinity
of the campus. For additional in
formation it is suggested that stu
dents consult the local Chamber of
Commerce.
