# Therapy Meet Hears Doctor On Psychology
## No Illness Imaginary, Lecturer Says; Heat Conference Planned 
### 
Declaring that there is no such
thing as "imaginary illness," Dr.
Herman Chor of Northwestern Uni
versity told the American Physio
therapy Association conference here
that there is a psychological symp
tom of some maladjustment behind
cases of imagined sickness.
The victim, Dr. Chor said, is not
playing make-believe, and his sen
sations must be relieved or ex
plained. He attributed many cases
of so-called imaginary illness to fail
ure in meeting environmental and
emotional problems.
Dr. Chor has been conducting
lectures morning and afternoon since
the opening of the conference Mon
day on the psychology of the invalid
and the handicapped and skeletal
muscle and motor activity in health
and disease.
Dr. R. R. Newell, radiologist at
Stanford University hospitals, out
lined the physics of cold, heat and
electricity Monday afternoon. The
subject was continued Tuesday and
Wednesday by Dr. Frances Baker of
the University of California hospi
tal, Mrs. Margaret Cleaveland, Miss
Gertrude Beard, and Mrs. Harriet
Lee.
Dr. Baker and Mrs. Cleaveland
continue the discussions of heat
therapy today.
Tomorrow morning delegates will
discuss recent studies in the treat
ment of poliomyelitis in the acute
and convalescent stages. A confer
ence on a survey to be made by the
association on physical therapy in
poliomyelitis will be held Saturday
morning.
