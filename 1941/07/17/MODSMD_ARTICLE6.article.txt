# O'Donnell, Limon Amuse Audience
## 
### 
Attracting a full house in the Me
morial Hall Tuesday evening, May
O'Donnell and Jose Limon, noted as
two of America's finest dancers,
amazed and amused their audience
with a modern dance and music ex
position "On American Themes."
Receiving numerous curtain calls,
they and their pianist-composer Ray
Green, who wrote the music for the
program, proved to be one of the
Tuesday Evening Series' greatest
successes.
Performing before decorations
and costumes especially designed by
Claire Falkenstein, the team danced
three numbers: "Curtain Raiser," a
gay and witty opening piece, "This
Story Ends," the story of Hernando
de Soto and his discovery of the
Mississippi, and three inventories of
Casey Jones in which Miss O'Don
nell represented the engine and Mr.
Limon the engineer. The antics of
the young couple in the last number
caused much laughter from the audi
ence.
The two schools which the dance
team represent are different in char
acter in that the Martha Gi'aham
group, which presented Miss O'Don
nell, is interested in meaning and
symbolism in dance, while the
Humphrey-Weidman dance group,
from which Mr. Limon has come, has
more interest in form. In modern
dance interpretation, Mr. Limon
represents the change from the pure
beauty of the ballet to the more
modern interpretations of dance
which emphasize strength and
power.
