# Popular Old Film Classics To Be Run Sunday Night
## Diamond Jim Brady on Double-Bill With 'Nick Carter Detective' 
### 
"Diamond Jim Brady," starring Edward Arnold, Jean Arthur, and
Binnie Barnes, will be the first of a series of popular old films to be revived
in the Education Auditorium beginning Sunday.
The movies will start at 8:30 and end in time for campus women to
make the 10:30 deadline without a chance of a lockout.

The life of "Diamond Jim" Brady
from his birth in 1856 to the close of
his glamorous career as one of the
most colorful figures in one of
America's most colorful decades,
that of the Gay Nineties, will be un
folded in nine reels for the admis
sion price of 15 cents per person,
which will include, in addition, a
companion feature, "Nick Carter,
Detective."
DON'T MISS IT
"It's a picture you won't want to
miss," said Shorty Grannis, A.S.S.U.
president for summer quarter. "We
won't have to worry about those
who've already seen it; they'll be
there."
"During the regular school year
these Sunday evening movies in the
Education Auditorium proved to be
very successful," he went on to ex
plain. "This summer, however, they
are an experiment, but if they sup
port themselves financially, there's
no reason why we can't have them
every Sunday night until the end of
the quarter.
"Practically all of the old motion
picture classics are available, and
we welcome suggestions."
