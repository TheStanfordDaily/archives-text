# Skating Party, Jolly-up Next On Calendar
## Sunday Night Movies To Be Temporarily Dropped by Excom 
### 
A roller skating party is next on
the summer quarter social program
and scheduled for Friday, it was an
nounced at Excom's weekly meeting
Monday night.
The party will start at 8 p.m. in
the roller skating rink at 1066 The
Alameda (the continuation of the
101 highway), San Jose, where the
management has extended to Stan
ford students, both graduates and
undergraduates, a special rate of 30
cents which will include the use of
skates for the evening. Jane Felix
was named as chairman of the
committee.
Thursday another jolly-up will be
held in the Nitery between 6:45 and
7:45. Henceforth, these will prob
ably be a weekly feature.
The attendance at Sunday night's
showing of "Diamond Jim Brady"
reached 125 â€” 75 short of the mini
mum number necessary to the
financial success of the initial sum
mer quarter film venture. Excom
decided to temporarily suspend the
series until further investigations
can be made. The final results will
probably be released for publication
in Thursday's Stanford Daily.
