# Dr. Bailey—An 'A' for Her Performance
## Repeat Comes To Campus For One Night Only 
### AUDREY KRAUSE 
When Marge Bailey shed her
campus role of associate professor
of English for that of Mrs. Alving
in Henrik Ibsen's "Ghosts" and ap
peared upon the stage, we instantly
forgot our desire to go home and
substitute oil of citronella for Chan
el's No. 5.
Fortunately, those who missed Dr.
Bailey's superb performance during
the play's four-night run in San
Mateo will have an opportunity to
see it Saturday at 8:15 p.m. in the
Education Auditorium — minus the
mosquitoes, chill night air, and fre
quent train whistles which Hillbarn
Summer Theater has to offer in the
way of local color.
If we could have our choice of
actresses from the New York stage,
we cannot think of anyone who
would have surpassed Dr. Bailey de
spite the fact that the critics, for the
most part, approved of Nazimova's
performance in a recent revival of
the play. Dr. Bailey's acting is defi
nitely out of the amateur class,
though this is no ordinary amateur
production.
EXPERIENCED PLAYERS
Miles Anderson as Pastor Man
ders, Royal Stevens as Jacob Eng
strand, Thelma Schram as Regina,
and Robert Brauns as Oswald Al
ving are all excellent, especially
Brauns, who is director of the Penin
sula Little Theater and the Hillbarn
Summer Theater.
All experienced players, Dr. An
derson is also musician, playwright,
and physician. Stevens has had con
siderable experience in stock, and
Thelma Schram was on campus last
summer in a prize comedy. The
same season Dr. Bailey was cast as
Mrs. Hardcastle in "She Stoops to
Conquer."
"Ghosts" is Ibsen's answer to
those who criticized Nora for slam
ming the door of "The Doll's House"
and leaving her husband. Mrs. Al
ving, widow of the profligate Cap
tain Alving, remains with hers un
til the bitter end which is that of
their son, Oswald. In three acts the
tragic lifetime of Mrs. Alving is
summed up for the audience, and at
no time during the two and one
half-hour performance does the ac
tion sag.
We agree with all who've seen it
that it is the season's "must"—and
we aren't in Dr. Bailey's English 204
or Shakespeare 25b either.
