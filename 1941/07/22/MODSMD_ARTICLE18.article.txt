# Horses, Not Water In Lake Lagunita
## 
### 
Less than two months ago canoes
were leisurely drifting across it â€”
now horses are leisurely grazing on
the same Lagunita Lake! This
shows how versatile Stanford can be.
Reeds have grown up in the
greater part of the lake, and the
toads and other animals have taken
over the area formerly frequented
by Stanfordites. Lagunita is now
much too shallow for swimming or
boating, and the only students who
can now appreciate the offerings of
the lake are the scientists who can
benefit from the summer speci
mens residing there.
Before long, there will be little
evidence of water in the area in back
of Roble, and a full-fledged lake
won't appear again until late next
Winter Quarter.
