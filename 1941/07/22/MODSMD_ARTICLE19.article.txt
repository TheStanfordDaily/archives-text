# Government to Train Women Pilots Here
## 
### 
Government forms have arrived
at Stanford at the C.A.A. office for
women pilots with two hundred or
more hours in the air. This is in
line with the government's program
to have women pilots to ferry planes
from factory to the airport in case
of need for the men pilots elsewhere.
This program is similar to the one
now in effect in England.
