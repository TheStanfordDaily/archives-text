# Lindeman Airs His World Plan
## Democratic Nations Offered 'New Order' 
### 
Holding forth the possibility of a
"new order" not dictated by any
one group of nations, but consisting
of a "planetary economy" and a
richer life for all mankind, Edu
ard C. Lindeman, director of Co
lumbia University's School of Social
Sciences, offered to the Education
Conference last week a six-point
plan for democracy's part in this
"world-wide revolution."
His plan is:
1. Linking national economy to
world economy, that all peoples may
share in the abundance of the
earth's resources.
2. Releasing this wealth of re
sources by breaking the dam that
holds back maximum production.
3. Expansion of social services of
all kinds — education, health serv
ices, security in age.
4. Establishment of a permanent
public works program.
5. Establishment of a program of
cultural activity for leisure time.
6. Extension of education both to
children now termed of "pre
school" age and to adults.
"I suspect," said Dr. Linderjan,
"that there is going to be a great
deal of pressure on all schools, but
particularly secondary schools, in
the next few years to turn them
into technological institutions.
Adding his opinion that some new
kind of world organization must
replace unlimited national sover
eignty, Dr. William G. Carr, Wash
ington, D.C., delivered the closing
address of the ninth annual confer
ence on education Sunday.
"The system of unlimited na
tional sovereignty is done for," he
said. "Two great wars in less than
a quarter century bear gloomy wit
ness to its bankruptcy. We shall be
unwisely led after this war if we
waste time trying to fit the pieces of
world organization back into the old
pattern."
