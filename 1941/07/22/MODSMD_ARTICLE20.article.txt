# Farm to Present Defense Courses
## 
### 
Adding impetus to Stanford's
contribution to the national defense,
the engineering department has
added four new courses to its cur
riculum.
Three of the courses, fluid motion
and conformal transformation, dif
ferential equations in engineering,
and advanced mathematics for engi
neers, are being given at the re
quest of the National Advisory
Committee on Aeronautics at Mof
fett Field.
The fourth course, study and
work simplification, was selected by
Stanford from among a number of
courses suggested from Washington.
This course will be a special two
weeks intensive training course
with class meeting from 9 to 5 five
days a week.
All four of the courses are tuition
free and no academic courses will be
given.
