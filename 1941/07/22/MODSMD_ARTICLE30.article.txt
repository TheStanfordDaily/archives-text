# Draftees Given Unofficial List Of Placements
## Local Draft Board Expected to Release Order Numbers Soon 
### 
Although the Palo Alto draft
board has not begun to integrate
the 356 newly registered 21-year
old men because the official photo
stat of the master list has not ar
rived from Washington, The Stan
ford Daily has compiled an unofficial
listing of the order in which the
new Stanford registrants will be
integrated with the old.
This list was compiled from un
official newspaper reports of the
national lottery on July 17 and does
not represent the order in which
the new registrants will be called,
merely the order in which the
names will be distributed propor
tionately among the names of those
not yet called from the old registra
tion.
Officials of the Palo Alto board
yesterday said that photostatic cop
ies of the official master list of num
bers would probably arrive this
week and the work of integrating
them would begin immediately. The
official order numbers probably
will be posted by August 1.
Because relatively few of those
who registered July 1 have depend
ents or defense jobs and their phys
ical fitness is presumably high, the
army is expected to take a greater
percentage of the 21-year-olds than
it has been accepting from the reg
istration last fall.
Those who have low numbers on
this list will probably receive their
questionnaires within the next two
months.
The following list shows unoffi
cially the order in which the 43

21-year-olds registered
