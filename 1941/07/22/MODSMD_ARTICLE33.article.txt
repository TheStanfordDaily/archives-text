# Curtis Leader Of Successful Co-op Venture
## Students Cut Down Costs in Thompson Co-operative House 
### 
Walter Thompson Co-operative
House, the first and only co-opera
tive house on campus, is now well
into its second quarter. This ven
ture is largely the result of the ef
forts of Russ Curtis, '41.
The later Walter Thompson, pro
fessor of political science, for whom
the house was named, supplied the
faculty leadership.
There are 12 students living in
the house this summer, and they
expect to have at least 18 in the
fall. The men sleep in beds which
they made themselves and work at
desks they finished and stained.
FURNITURE DONATED
Another interesting feature of the
house is a "closet room" which is
lined with refrigerator crates; poles
have been set in them near the top,
forming serviceable individual
closets.
All but one piece of furniture was
supplied through gifts from the fac
ulty and interested members of the
Palo Alto Co-operative as well as
from the large co-operatives at the
University of California. The extent
of faculty interest in establishing a
Rochdale Co-operative here at Stan
ford is evidenced by the fact that
18 professors each pledged $10 in
case of need.
Joel Gustafson was recently
elected president and Dick McCann
house manager. Each of the men
spend approximately an hour a
week performing specific tasks nec
essary to the upkeep of the house.
This enables the students to rent the
rooms at $8 a month.
CO-OP MOVEMENT
The house is being watched
closely by many interested parties
and on its success hinges the future
of co-operative movements, at least
of this type, here at Stanford.
