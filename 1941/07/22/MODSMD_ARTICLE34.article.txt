# C.A.A. Students Work for Licenses
## 
### 
Half of this summer's C.A.A. stu
dents have already soloed, thus mak
ing progress toward their civilian
pilots licenses.
Stanford's C.A.A. co-ordinator,
Professor D. L. Webster, has decided
to give eight, instead of seven units
for the course as he plans to pres
ent a considerable amount of ground
school work. He believes that this
type of work, especially theory of
flight, is extremely important. If a
pilot understands why he should ex
ecute a maneuver then he is not so
apt to develop so-called sloppy fly
ing technique.
