# Prof. Reuter To Lecture
## Population Trends Will Be Subject 
### 
The problem of population, ac
cording to Professor Edward B.
Reuter, acting professor of sociol
ogy, has always been to find means
to limit the growth of numbers, to
prevent over-population, in order
to avoid poverty, famine, and the
whole train of miseries that follow
scarcity in the means of life. This
problem, says Prof. Reuter, is still
the major problem in most areas of
the world. He will lecture on
"Population Trends and Their So
cial Consequences," tomorrow at
4:15 p.m. in the lower lounge of
the Women's Clubhouse.
Professor Reuter will discuss the
decrease in population in Europe
and the United States today and the
possibility of increase in population
in fhese areas in the future. Age
distribution, according to Professor
Reuter, is changing rapidly and will
continue to do so at an increasing
pace. Children will become propor
tionately fewer in number while the
old people will become relatively
more numerous. As this age change
progresses, the burden of depend
ency, contrary to popular belief,
will decline.
Professor Reuter comes to Stan
ford from the University of lowa,
where he is chairman of the De
partment of Sociology. He is a
member of the American Sociology
Society of which he was president

author of a number of books,

lems," and "Race and Culture Con
