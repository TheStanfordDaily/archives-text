## 
### 
The Russo-German conflict was
predicted by Dr. Ralph H. Lutz,
dean of graduate study and profes
sor of history, a little over a year
ago at the fourth annual Stanford
business conference on July 15, 3940.
"The German-Italian axis, which
now dominates Europe, Dr. Lutz
told the business men last year,
"may eventually attack the Russian
Bear.
"With the subjection of Great
Britain, Germany will utilize her
political domination of the Conti
nent to extend her economic leader
ship throught the world," Dr. Lutz
said.
Complete destruction of the Brit
ish fleet would leave United States
and Japan to dominate the seas, he
asserted.
Three alterantives will face the
United States if England loses the
war, the historian said last year. If
the United States fails to negotiate
trade agreements with Germany,
she will engage in either a trade
war or in actual armed conflict with
the Continental power, he said.
Dr. Lutz has traveled widely in
Europe throughout his life, espe
cially during the last few years gath
ering information for the Hoover
Library of War, Peace, and Revolu
tion.
