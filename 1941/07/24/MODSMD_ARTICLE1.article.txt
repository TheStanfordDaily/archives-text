# 'Thunder Rock' In Rehearsal; Tickets on Sale
## Opening Night Less Than a Week Away; Cast Unusually Good 
### 
With production less than a week
away, the cast of "Thunder Rock" is
engaged in full rehearsal daily in
the Memorial Auditorium. The play
is under the direction of Mr. F.
Cowles Strickland of the drama de
partment, the sets are being con
structed under the supervision of
Mr. William Girvan, and the cos
tumes are being designed under the
direction of Miss Hazel Brain.
The action of the play takes place
in a lonely lighthouse on Lake
Michigan. The lightkeeper has
taken up his job in order to es
cape from a world which he has
found detestable, which has been
too much for his conscience. He has
seen unemployment, want, starva
tion, greed, and war. He has re
ported it all for newspapers and
publishers. Unable at length to bear
the sight of it, he has fled to be
alone with his dreams.
Once a month he is visited by a
prosaic but very human inspector,
who is puzzled and irritated by his
subordinate's frightening detachment
from life. The lightkeeper's dreams,
as far as the playgoer is concerned,
take very palpable and visible
shapes. The shapes are the people
who were shipwrecked on the light
house rock 90 years ago. There is a
tablet on the wall of the lighthouse
to their memory and studying it in
his loneliness, the lightkeeper vis
ualizes them in his own mind.
These half real, half-imaginary
creatures of his mind were people
who were fleeing from a disturbed
and unsatisfactory Europe after the
1848 revolution. Each in his escape
exhibits an element of despair. The
lightkeeper in his talks with them
explains how their own immediate
problems were solved soon after
their death 90 years ago.
Reservations may be made by
calling Mr. Barker at Palo Alto
2-2041 daily from 9 to 5, or tickets
may be purchased during the same
hours in Room 202 of the Memorial
Auditorium.

structed under the supervision of
Mr. William Girvan, and the cos
tumes are being designed under the
direction of Miss Hazel Brain.
The action of the play takes place
in a lonely lighthouse on Lake
Michigan. The lightkeeper has
taken up his job in order to es
cape from a world which he has
found detestable, which has been
too much for his conscience. He has
seen unemployment, want, starva
tion, greed, and war. He has re
ported it all for newspapers and
publishers. Unable at length to bear
the sight of it, he has fled to be
alone with his dreams.
Once a month he is visited by a
prosaic but very human inspector,
who is puzzled and irritated by his
subordinate's frightening detachment
from life. The lightkeeper's dreams,
as far as the playgoer is concerned,
take very palpable and visible
shapes. The shapes are the people
who were shipwrecked on the light
house rock 90 years ago. There is a
tablet on the wall of the lighthouse
to their memory and studying it in
his loneliness, the lightkeeper vis
ualizes them in his own mind.
These half real, half-imaginary
creatures of his mind were people
who were fleeing from a disturbed
and unsatisfactory Europe after the
1848 revolution. Each in his escape
exhibits an element of despair. The
lightkeeper in his talks with them
explains how their own immediate
problems were solved soon after
their death 90 years ago.
Reservations may be made by
calling Mr. Barker at Palo Alto
