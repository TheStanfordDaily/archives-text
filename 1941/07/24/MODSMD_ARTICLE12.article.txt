# Brandt Gives War Status
## Conference Hears Slichter, Canady 
### 
Hitler's invasion of Russia will
not relieve Germany's shortage of
fats and feed proteins even if the
Ukraine is successfully captured,
according to Dr. Karl Brandt, of the
Food Research Institute and for
merly with the German Institute of
Farm Research Economics.
Dr. Brandt spoke Tuesday before
a meeting of delegates to the fifth
annual Stanford Business Confer
ence.
Starvation of Germany by block
ade will not be sufficient alone to
bring about its defeat, he said, be
cause the Germans have been able
to rearrange the Continental agri
cultural economy with great effi
ciency.
Germany's defeat could be ac
complished, Dr. Brandt said, "if the
British, their allies, and the United
States would seize the continent
piecemeal from Hitler."
Professor Sumner H. Slichter, ad
dressing the conference yesterday,
challenged politicians to make the
same all-out aid effort they are ask
ing of the people. He blamed the
politicians' unsuccessful attempts at
control of increasing prices.
He advocated the widespread sell
ing of bonds to the public to keep
the tax rate down, to prevent a post
war depression, to prevent inflation,
and to give the individual an asset
instead of a debt.
John E. Canady, public relations
manager of Lockheed Aircraft at
Burbank, told conference delegates
that the aircraft industry would feel
a "sharp reaction" after the crisis.
This would be compensated by the
increased interest in flying, in
creased air transportation facilities,
and the continuance of military avia
tion purchases, Canady said.
