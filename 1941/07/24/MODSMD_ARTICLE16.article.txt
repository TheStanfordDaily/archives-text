"We should continue aiding Brit- (
ain with materials and technicians
and keep the Atlantic free for our
shipments," said Carlton J. H. Hayes,
visiting professor of history in an
interview yesterday.
Dr. Hayes believes that eventually
we will get into the war, but that
it will be an "undeclared war" on the
Atlantic in order to keep that ocean
free from German raiders.
If Hitler is successful in conquer
ing Europe, said Dr. Hayes, he will
probably establish a union of fed
eral states under German domina
tion. Such a domination will height
en nationalism among the oppressed
peoples.
As to these peoples' revolting, Dr.
Hayes said that the military strength
of Germany is too strong for any
such uprisings. The "V" campaign,
which has been so widely publicized,
is principally a publicity scheme
sponsored by the San Francisco
Chronicle.
"Of course," said Dr. Hayes, "in
20 or so years there will be upris
ings in Europe which will be the
cause of another series of wars."
Dr. Hayes said that it is only
natural that the Latin American
countries should turn to Europe for
there is a much greater demand for
their materials abroad.
Japan, thinks Dr. Hayes, will wait
until she sees where the "cat lies,"

•and if the Nazis are victorious in
Russia she will attempt to take over
parts of Outer Mongolia and the
Dutch East Indies.
Dr. Hayes, whose amusing and in
teresting lectures have kept his
classes, full is visiting from Colum
bia University and is leaving Stan
ford next week.
Dr. Hayes, who recently "shocked"
a number of teachers and education
majors in a class lecture on educa
tion, believes that the United
States should allow more freedom
in schools and teaching. Dr. Hayes
declares that because the schools are
federally controlled, education is
mainly centered toward patriotism
and good citizenship.

Dr. Hayes, who recently "shocked"
a number of teachers and education
majors in a class lecture on educa
tion, believes that the United
States should allow more freedom
in schools and teaching. Dr. Hayes
declares that because the schools are
federally controlled, education is
mainly centered toward patriotism
and good citizenship.
"We should continue aiding Brit- (
ain with materials and technicians
and keep the Atlantic free for our
shipments," said Carlton J. H. Hayes,
visiting professor of history in an
interview yesterday.
Dr. Hayes believes that eventually
we will get into the war, but that
it will be an "undeclared war" on the
Atlantic in order to keep that ocean
free from German raiders.
If Hitler is successful in conquer
ing Europe, said Dr. Hayes, he will
probably establish a union of fed
eral states under German domina
tion. Such a domination will height
en nationalism among the oppressed
peoples.
As to these peoples' revolting, Dr.
Hayes said that the military strength
of Germany is too strong for any
such uprisings. The "V" campaign,
which has been so widely publicized,
is principally a publicity scheme
sponsored by the San Francisco
Chronicle.
"Of course," said Dr. Hayes, "in
20 or so years there will be upris
ings in Europe which will be the
cause of another series of wars."
Dr. Hayes said that it is only
natural that the Latin American
countries should turn to Europe for
there is a much greater demand for
their materials abroad.
Japan, thinks Dr. Hayes, will wait
until she sees where the "cat lies,"

•and if the Nazis are victorious in
Russia she will attempt to take over
parts of Outer Mongolia and the
Dutch East Indies.
Dr. Hayes, whose amusing and in
teresting lectures have kept his
classes, full is visiting from Colum
bia University and is leaving Stan
ford next week.
