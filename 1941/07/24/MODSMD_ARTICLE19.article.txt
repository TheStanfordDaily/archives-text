# New Treatment For Polio Told
## Bush Nurse Devises Method in Australia 
### 
One of the highlights of the re
cent physiotherapy conference here
was the first public description of a
new treatment for infantile paraly
sis. This treatment was introduced
into the United States during the
past year by Miss Elizabeth Ken
ny, an Australian "bush nurse," who
developed her own methods for
treating the dread disease.
The essence of the plan, the phys
iotherapists were told, is that treat
ment consisting of muscle exercise
should be given as soon as the
disease has been diagnosed as in
fantile paralysis. Also strong psy
chological effort should be made to
keep the patient from forgetting how
he used to use the paralyzed mem
ber.
Miss Kenny believes that the
paralysis of one muscle is respon
sible for the contracting of all the
others, and that by working on it
immediately it may be kept in use.
This is in contrast to the current
practice of waiting until the fever
has subsided before corrective ex
ercises are begun.
Miss Kenny's treatment is now
being studied at the two Minne
apolis, Minn., hospitals under the
sponsorship of the National Founda
tion for Infantile Paralysis. The de
scription of the treatment was in the
form of a report on the progress of
the study and no conclusion was at
tempted on this matter by the con
ference as much additional experi
mentation is scheduled.
