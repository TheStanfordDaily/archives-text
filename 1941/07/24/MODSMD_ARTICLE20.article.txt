# Martin Urges Inter-American Co-operation
## Stanford Historian Tells of Economy, Culture of Latins 
### 
"It is becoming evident that the
nations of Latin America need us
and that we need them," said Percy
A. Martin, professor of history and
authority on South America. The
countries of South America are be
coming of age, said Dr. Martin, and
they are going to play an increas
ingly important economic and cul
tural role.
Dr. Martin, who spoke before the
Tuesday Evening Series, said that
there are seven conditions which
must be fulfilled before a nation
"becomes of age": (1) population
growth, (2) economic importance,
(3) transportation, (4) industrializa
tion, (5) cultural progress, (6) inter
national importance and, particularly
in the Western Hemisphere, (7) ad
vancement in democracy.
LABOR LEGISLATION
Out of the 20 nations with the
fastest growing populations, Dr.
Martin said that 13 were Latin
American countries. The status of
the less privileged classes is being
raised by labor legislation, housing
plans, and medical care.
Transportation improvements are
bringing greater production in the
interior of South America, while in
dustrialization is being carried out
with the help of loans and experts
from the United States.
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS
South America has made great
progress in education, especially in
medicine, law, and literature. Dr.
Martin said that until recently the
South American countries looked
abroad for their culture models, but
that today each country exhibits its
own individualism.
According to Dr. Martin, Brazil,
which is the largest of the South
American countries and is at pres
ent under a dictator, will not become
part of the totalitarian powers.
President Vargas was set up as dic
tator to hasten much needed reforms
in education, transportation, and im
provement of living conditions.
