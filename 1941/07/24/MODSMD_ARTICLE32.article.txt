# 'Berlin' Diary Contains Cold Dope on Hitler
## 
### 
"BERLIN DIARY," by William L.
Shirer, on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Since William L. Shirer's return
from Germany last December, where
he was a correspondent of the Uni
versal News Service and the Colum
bia Broadcasting System, he has
written his "Berlin Diary," another
eye-witness account of the nasty
Nazis.
But in these wartimes, when
books condemning the so-called op
position are published all too fre
quently for the public to judge crit
ically, Mr. Shirer's book seems to
be an island of truth in a sea of
skepticism.
There is every reason to believe
that Mr. Shirer gives an uncolored
picture of the things he saw and
experienced during the seven years
in which he watched Hitler rise to
power and conquer most of a con
tinent for, as a genius of journalism,
he is necessarily a close observer
and a good reporter who is on the
spot when anything important
happens.
"Berlin Diary" is written as an
uncensored, private journal of a
great foreign correspondent who, in
expressing his personal feelings, be
lieves that England and France just
dilly-dallied around too much when
they should have been acting—with
out too many pretty words.
The life of a foreign correspond
ent is not merely one of whiskey
and typing up official releases, as
Mr. Shirer's life from 1934 to 1941
shows. He was in Austria when it
fell and in Prague when it was
stolen. He saw the occupation of
the Rhineland, and watched the
sellout of Czechoslovakia. In fact,
he spent most of his time running
back and forth between the capitals
of Europe.
Mr. Shirer believes the present
government of the Reich is entirely
unscrupulous—that Hitler now rep
resents deep social and national de
sires of the whole German people.
He believes that Hitler is entirely in
command and that he has genius and
shrewdness in extraordinary combi
nation.
In "Berlin Diary" the facts tell the
story and the opinions are formed
by experience.—Glasson

bia Broadcasting System, he has
written his "Berlin Diary," another
eye-witness account of the nasty
Nazis.
But in these wartimes, when
books condemning the so-called op
position are published all too fre
quently for the public to judge crit
ically, Mr. Shirer's book seems to
be an island of truth in a sea of
skepticism.
There is every reason to believe
that Mr. Shirer gives an uncolored
picture of the things he saw and
experienced during the seven years
in which he watched Hitler rise to
power and conquer most of a con
tinent for, as a genius of journalism,
he is necessarily a close observer
and a good reporter who is on the
spot when anything important
happens.
"Berlin Diary" is written as an
uncensored, private journal of a
great foreign correspondent who, in
expressing his personal feelings, be
lieves that England and France just
dilly-dallied around too much when
they should have been acting—with
out too many pretty words.
The life of a foreign correspond
ent is not merely one of whiskey
and typing up official releases, as
Mr. Shirer's life from 1934 to 1941
shows. He was in Austria when it
fell and in Prague when it was
stolen. He saw the occupation of
the Rhineland, and watched the
sellout of Czechoslovakia. In fact,
he spent most of his time running
back and forth between the capitals
of Europe.
Mr. Shirer believes the present
government of the Reich is entirely
unscrupulous—that Hitler now rep
resents deep social and national de
sires of the whole German people.
He believes that Hitler is entirely in
command and that he has genius and
shrewdness in extraordinary combi
nation.
In "Berlin Diary" the facts tell the
story and the opinions are formed
by experience.—Glasson
