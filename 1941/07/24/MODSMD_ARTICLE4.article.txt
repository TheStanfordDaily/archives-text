# Jolly-up Tonight
## 
### 
A jolly-up will be held tonight in
the Nitery between 6:45 and 7:45.
Due to a misunderstanding no ar
rangements were made for a jolly
up last week, although a number of
people turned up only to be disap
pointed. It is probable, however,
that henceforth these will be weekly
affairs.
Friday the roller skating party is
scheduled for 8 p.m. at 1066 The
Alameda (the continuation of the
101 highway), San Jose, where the
management has extended to Stan
ford students a special rate of 30
cents which will include the use of
skates for the evening. Jane Felix
is -chairman of the committee in
charge.
August 6 was the date set for the
community sing which will be pat
terned after spring quarter's suc
cessful All-University Sing. Johnny
Ryan and Jack Edmands were sug
gested as possibilities for master of
ceremonies. It will begin at 7:30
and probably be held in the Lau
rence A. Frost Amphitheater.
No date has as yet been scheduled
for the faculty-student debate Ex
com hopes to hold in the Education
Auditorium. This will, however, fall
sometime after the community sing
and before August 15 which is the
date of the All-University day.
The latter will consist of swim
ming, tennis, badminton and other
sports, a supper and barn dance.
The location and other details will
probably be announced following
next Monday's Excom meeting.
