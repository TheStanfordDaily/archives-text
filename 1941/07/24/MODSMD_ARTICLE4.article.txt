# Jolly-up Tonight
## 
### 
A jolly-up will be held tonight in
the Nitery between 6:45 and 7:45.
Due to a misunderstanding no ar
rangements were made for a jolly
up last week, although a number of
people turned up only to be disap
pointed. It is probable, however,
that henceforth these will be weekly
affairs.
Friday the roller skating party is
scheduled for 8 p.m. at 1066 The
Alameda (the continuation of the
101 highway), San Jose, where the
management has extended to Stan
ford students a special rate of 30
cents which will include the use of
skates for the evening. Jane Felix
is -chairman of the committee in
charge.
August 6 was the date set for the
community sing which will be pat
terned after spring quarter's suc
cessful All-University Sing. Johnny
Ryan and Jack Edmands were sug
gested as possibilities for master of
ceremonies. It will begin at 7:30
