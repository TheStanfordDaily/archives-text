# Stanford Men 'Join the Army'
## Second Group to Be Called in September 
### 
Induction into military service of
the first of the 21-year-olds who
registered July 1 will probably take
place early in September, according
to Brigadier-General Joseph O.
Donovan, state director of selective
service.
Registrants were urged to acquaint
themselves with the basic physical
requirements of the Army and to
consult with their own physicians or
dentists to determine whether they
are physically qualified.
The director placed emphasis on
the "patriotic service to be derived
from such a procedure as well as
the general improvement of health"
where men who discover they have
physical defects take steps to rem
edy them.
General Donovan added, "If reg
istrants will assure themselves that
they conform with general physical
standards they will have taken a
material step toward preparing
themselves for training."
Four draftees from Palo Alto Se
lective Service Board 111 left for
San Francisco Tuesday. Two of
them, Lawrence Girolami and John
Doty, were Stanford students last
quarter.
The board yesterday received or
ders from Washington that Palo
Alto's August 4 quota would be six
men. Order numbers for July 1 reg
istrants have not been released yet
by the local board.
