# Dr. Bailey to Appear Saturday in Only Campus Showing of Ibsen's 'Ghosts
## 
### 
Henrik Ibsen's "Ghosts," with Dr,
Margery Bailey in the role of the
leading lady, is coming to the Edu
cation Auditorium Saturday at 8:15
p.m. after last week's successful
four-night run in San Mateo at the
Hillbarn Summer Theater, where the
play attracted the largest houses of
the season.
The presentation of this 19th cen
tury tragedy is being given by the
Dramatists' Alliance and the Hill
barn Summer Theater, two alumni
organizations, as a tribute to the
University's fiftieth anniversary.
"It is actually a double birthday
present," said Dr. Bailey during the
fitting of the costume designed for
her by Sam Rolph of the Peninsula
Little Theater. "I am 50 this year
as well as the University, and the
directors of Hillbarn, who knew that
I had always hoped to try the part
of Mrs. Alving some day, suggested
the production to mark the double
anniversary."
A VERSATILE ACTRESS
Dr. Bailey will be remembered for
her excellent performances on cam
pus and community theater stages,
particularly for her portrayals of
Mrs. Hardcastle in "She Stoops to
Conquer" last summer and the
Nurse in "Romeo and Juliet" some
years ago. In addition, Dr. Bailey
has acted as academic adviser to
several of the Shakespearean pro
ductions of the San Jose State Play
ers, is University proctor for the
Dramatists' Alliance, and, last but
not least, is associate professor of
English at Stanford.
Dr. Bailey is supported by Rob
ert Brauns, '34, director of the Pen
insula Little Theater and the Hill
barn Summer Theater, in the role
of the son, Oswald Alving; Dr.
Miles Anderson, musician and author
of the play, "A Man for A' That,"
as Pastor Manders; Thelma Schram,
member of the cast of last summer's
prize comedy production and wife
of Director Ralph Schram, as Re
gina; and Royal Stevens, an expe
rienced stock company player, as
Jacob Engstrand.
PROF. DODDS COMMENTS
"It was a very moving and real
performance," said Prof. J. W.
Dodds of the English department
during the course of Monday's class
in Contemporary Drama. "Dr. Bailey
was excellent and the rest of the
cast extremely good. I recommend it
very highly."
Saturday's production will contain
certain departures from the conven
tional performance of the famous
play. TTie usual gloom of characters
