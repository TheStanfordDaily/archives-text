# Farm Receives Grant For Microscope
## 
### 
The Rockefeller Foundation has
given Stanford University $65,000 to
carry on a five-year program of de
velopment of the electron micro
scope which may make individual
molecules ••.visible.
The electron microscope, which
costs $10,000, is ten times as power
ful as the best optical microscope,
but scientists predict that it can be
improved to a point where it is 100
times as powerful. Photographs,
taken through this microscope, have
revealed the hitherto invisible
structure of the tobacco mosaic vi
rus, the soap molecule, the whooping
cough bacterium, and the strepto
coccus germ.
Dr. L. Marton, 40-year-old Hun
garian physicist who designed and
constructed the first biological elec
tron microscopes in Europe and the
United States, will head the program
to improve and adapt the electron
to research in biology, bacteriology,
chemistry, physics, metallurgy, and
medicine. Dr. Marton, who gradu
ated from the University of Zurich
and was associated with the Univer
sity of Brussels, will come to Stan
ford in September as associate pro
fessor of electron microscopes.
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
Dr. Marton expects to build an
electron microscope for the imme
diate use of Stanford scientists on
research problems. He will use the
physics department machine shop as
a base and estimates that it will
take six months to complete the first
