## Galapagos Islands Expedition to Be Von Hagen's Subject 
### 
"The Galapagos Islands â€” Isles of
Enchantment" will be the subject
for an illustrated lecture by Dr.
Victor Wolfgang von Hagen, ex
plorer, naturalist, and ethnologist,
tonight at 8 in the Memorial Hall
Auditorium.
This tiny group of islands lying
on the equator 500 miles off the
coast of Ecuador have become famed
as the source from which Charles
Darwin was stimulated in 1835 to
formulate the principles enunciated
in his "Origin of Species." Dr. von
Hagen led an expedition to the
islands to commemorate the centen
nial of Darwin's visit.
GALAPAGOS CURSE
In his lecture he will tell how the
islands influenced Darwin's work
and of tales of death and destruc
tion that have followed the Galapa
gos curse for centuries.
Dr. von Hagen has conducted ex
peditions to Mexico, Africa, the
Amazon, Honduras, the Mosquito
Coast, Guatemala, and lately to
Panama in addition to his trip to
the Galapagos. After this latter ex
pedition, he was invited by Julian
Huxley to lecture in London. Here
he lectured at Cambridge, Sheffield,
and the Zoological Society. He and
Mr. Huxley formed a group called
the Galapagos Committee with the
purpose of promoting the establish
ment of research stations on the
archipelago.
