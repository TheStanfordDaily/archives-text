The old maid, Miss Kirby, played
by Dorothy Weaver, will "wear
hoop skirts and, as she is a woman's
rights advocate, we will try to make
her as old-maidish as possible," Miss
Brain revealed.

"The character of Anne Marie,
played by Roberta Blomquist, is by
far the most frivolous feminine
character in the play. All the char
acters will wear costumes suitable
to the period," she concluded.
