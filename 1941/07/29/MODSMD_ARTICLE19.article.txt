## Urges Long Reading Session before Class 
### 
CHICAGO, July 29. — "Reading
periods," during which students
may read and Study for several
weeks without attending classes, are
advocated by a University of Chi
cago dean as an antidote to the pre
vailing American assumption that
"education takes place only while
the professors are talking."
"Reading periods constitute a step
forward because they transfer a
reasonable share of the responsi
bility for education to the student
himself," declared Dean Robert
Redfield of the university's division
of social sciences.
"Also, they are, or could be, a
forward step because they call for
an improvement in the lectures given
by the professors," Redfield added.
"It has worked best in the case of
the better professors, just as it has
worked best in the case of the better
students."
