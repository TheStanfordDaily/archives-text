League will be out en masse this
afternoon when the Spar Ducks and
Greasy Spoons meet in a game that
will be a long way toward deciding
the final outcome of the league
standings.
Although the Spar Ducks, defend
ing champs, are at present leading
the league, they were defeated in a
practice game earlier this year by
the organization from the Beta
house.
Last Thursday's play was high
lighted by two of the season's big
gest upsets. The two cellar teams,
the Biz School and Slave Drivers,
rose up and smote their respective
opponents, the Greasy Spoons and
New Deal Prune Pickers, by scores
of 2-1 and 5-3.
Yesterday afternoon a late rally
by the Spar Ducks agve them a 10
to 7 win over the Lab Rats, despite
the presence of Lucille Casey, femi
nine slugger and morale builder for
the latter team, in a game post
poned from the previous week.
Friday also saw the Lab Rats de
feated in a postponed game, this
time by the Igerodians, who are fi
nally coming out of their slump. The
score was 8 to 7.
