## Stanfordites Teach Kiddies How To Swim 
### 
On all week-day afternoons ex
cept Friday, the swimming pool at
the Women's Gym is the scene of a
special swimming class for a group
of youngsters ranging in age from
4 to 10 years. The young swimmers
are mostly children of summer
quarter professors, or children from
the surrounding districts of Menlo
Park, Palo Alto, and Los Altos.
Of particular interest to Stanford
ites is the fact that these classes af
ford an opportunity to some of the
students to make use of their swim
ming ability by teaching the young
sters to keep their heads above
water.
MRS. FENNER IN CHARGE
Bill Weeden, Pat Allen, Doris
Dreusike, and Nan Tillson are the
student instructors. Mrs. Fenner,
head of the swimming department
of the gym, is in charge of the
whole series of classes.
Doris Dreusike and Nan Tillson
are freshmen, and seem to enjoy
the classes, for which they get regu
lar credit, almost as much as do the
young novices. According to Miss
Tillson the children "think it's
wonderful, and have lots of fun,
even though they sometimes almost
kick each other in the teeth."
AGE GROUPS
The children are divided into
two classes according to age. The
first group swims from 1:30 to 2:15
in the afternoon, and the children
are from 7 to 10 years old. The
second group of 4- to 6-year-olds
has a class from 2:15 to 3 o'clock.
Nan Tillson says, "We start them
out in life preservers, and teach
them the dog-paddle. When they
learn to stay up without the belt
then we start working on stroke.
They usually don't realize when
the life belts are off," she added,
"but the anxious mothers are al
ways there to leap in if they become
excited. But they're really all very
good sports."

student instructors. Mrs. Fenner,
head of the swimming department
of the gym, is in charge of the
whole series of classes.
Doris Dreusike and Nan Tillson
are freshmen, and seem to enjoy
the classes, for which they get regu
lar credit, almost as much as do the
young novices. According to Miss
Tillson the children "think it's
wonderful, and have lots of fun,
even though they sometimes almost
kick each other in the teeth."
AGE GROUPS
The children are divided into
two classes according to age. The
first group swims from 1:30 to 2:15
in the afternoon, and the children
are from 7 to 10 years old. The
second group of 4- to 6-year-olds
has a class from 2:15 to 3 o'clock.
Nan Tillson says, "We start them
out in life preservers, and teach
them the dog-paddle. When they
learn to stay up without the belt
then we start working on stroke.
They usually don't realize when
the life belts are off," she added,
"but the anxious mothers are al
ways there to leap in if they become
excited. But they're really all very
good sports."
On all week-day afternoons ex
cept Friday, the swimming pool at
the Women's Gym is the scene of a
special swimming class for a group
of youngsters ranging in age from
4 to 10 years. The young swimmers
are mostly children of summer
quarter professors, or children from
the surrounding districts of Menlo
Park, Palo Alto, and Los Altos.
Of particular interest to Stanford
ites is the fact that these classes af
ford an opportunity to some of the
students to make use of their swim
ming ability by teaching the young
sters to keep their heads above
water.
