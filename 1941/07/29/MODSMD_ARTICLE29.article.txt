# Neale Annexes Tennis Titles
## 
### 
After spending over seven hours
on the courts of the Seattle Tennis
Club Sunday, Emery Neale, Port
land's addition to the Stanford ten
his team, annexed two Washington
State titles and barely lost a third
in 125 games of play.
Nick Carter, who beat Neale last
week in the finals of the Pacific
Northwest tourney and whom Neale
beat the week before in the Oregon
championships, was the loser in the
men's singles division by a score of
6-0, 6-8, 6-3, 4-6, 9-7.
Neale combined with Jack Gur
ley, fellow Stanfordite, to win the
men's doubles crown from Henry
Prusoff and Dick Bennett, 2-6, 6-1,
3-6, 6-1, 6-4. Prusoff is ranked
eighth nationally. Gurley made his
way to the semi-finals of the singles
division where he had the misfor
tune to encounter Neale, who is not
only his doubles partner but con
stant companion and roommate at
the S.A.E. house. Gurley went
down, 3-6, 6-2, 9-7, 6-2.
Neale attempted to duplicate his
feat of a few weeks back by taking
three titles on one day when he
paired with Dorothy Head in the
mixed doubles final. However, his
two matches proved too much for
him as Hal Wagner and Nancy
Wolfenden defeated them in straight
sets, 8-6, 7-5.
