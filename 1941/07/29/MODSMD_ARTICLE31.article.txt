# Schroeder Sensational at Seabright Tourney; Defeated in Finals by Riggs
## 
### 
Only the country's foremost ama-'
teur racquet wielder, Bobby Riggs,
kept "Ted the Giant Killer" Schroe
der, Stanford senior tennis player,
from winning the 54th annual quest
for the Sea Bright Bowl, first of the
major grass court tournaments on
the summer circuit.
Schroeder was no match for the
former national champion in the
final of the New Jersey tourney Sat
urday, due partially to his grueling
five-set match with Wayne Sabin
in the semi-final round the previous
day. Riggs took an hour to win,
6-4, 6-4, 6-0.
First of Schroeder's amazing up
sets came in the quarter-finals when
he ran through present national
champ and supposedly No. 1 player,
Don McNeil, 6-3, 7-5.

â–º His match with Sabin the next
day proved to be all he could handle,
since Sabin is one of the nation's
five top men. Sabin had previously
upset Frankie Parker, third seeded
in the tournament.
