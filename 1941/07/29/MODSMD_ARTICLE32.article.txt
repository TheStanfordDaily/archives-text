# Women Violate Lockout System
## 
### 
There were innumerable technical
lockouts in the women's living
groups on campus during the first
few weeks of school. These viola
tions were treated leniently by the
Women's Council because allow
ances were made for the unfamiliar
ity of the new students with the
methods of signing in and out.
There have been fewer violations
of the late leave regulations after a
test was given to all old and new
students. Those violations that have
occurred have been technical and
due to students' carelessness in neg
lecting to sign themselves in, use of
wrong slips for signing out, and
misdating the sign-out slips. Stu
dents are to be reminded that
blue slips are to be used for week
end late leaves and pink slips for
leaves during the week.
Students living in the Union, Ma
drona, and Manzanita are asked to
be particularly careful about sign
ing in and out from now until the
end of the quarter because the
penalties for violation are to in
crease. The Council feels that the
women students have had sufficient
time to acquaint themselves with
the rules and regulations, and from
now on there is no reason for viola
tion.
