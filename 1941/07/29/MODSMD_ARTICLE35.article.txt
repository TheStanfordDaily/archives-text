# Traffic Violations Drop, Says Council
## 
### 
There were only four traffic cita
tions given to Stanford students last
week, according to the reports of the
Men's Council. Two of the tickets
were for speeding violations and the
other two for parking.
Nineteen students still have failed
to appear at the council and thus
incur an additional fine of $1 each
per week.
There have been no Honor Code
violations referred to the Men's
Council as yet.
