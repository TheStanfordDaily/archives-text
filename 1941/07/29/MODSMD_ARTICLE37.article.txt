# Conference Told Of War Supplies
## 
### 
Great Britain has very nea'
reached the peak of its capacity of
war production, and that peak pins
America's present planned—but not
accomplished — defense program, is
not yet equal to the production now
pouring out of European factories
to Hitler's armies.
So said William M. Hale, vice
president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco and special
adviser in the defense contract serv
ice of the OPM, to 200 Pacific Coast
business executives at a closing
meeting of the Stanford Business
Conference.
Other speakers at the concluding
meetings of the conference were
Sumner H. Slichter, Harvard econ
omist and summer professor here,
and Charles C. Hannah, vice-presi
dent of the Farmer's Fund Insur
ance Company.
