# Student Scripts To Go on Market
## 
### 
Many of the scripts written in
Playwriting 134b this summer will
be sold and will eventually reach
production, said Hubert Heffner,
professor of dramatic literature.
Past experience has shown that a
surprisingly high average of the fin
ished scripts are bought by pub
lishers in various parts of the
country.
Two of the plays, "Louie Takes a
Wife" and "Head Full of Movies,"
which were written in class during
the spring quarter, are to be pro
duced at Northwestern University
this summer for several Chicago
publishers.
The students in the course often
are not drama majors. The main
requirement for the course is that
each prospective student must show
Professor Heffner an original script
which he has written.
If Professor Heffner feels that the
play submitted is one which people
will pay money to see, the student
is qualified to enter the class.
