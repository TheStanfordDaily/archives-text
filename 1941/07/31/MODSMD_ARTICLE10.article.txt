# Explorer Tells Of Island Life
## Naturalist Explains Galapagos Expedition 
### 
The animal life that has developed
for millions of years on the Galapa
gos Islands is rapidly being liqui
dated by the wastefulness of man,
said Victor Wolfgang von Hagen,
explorer, naturalist, and ethnolo
gist, who spoke before the Tuesday
Evening Series.
Dr. von Hagen led an expedition
to the islands, which lie on the
equator 500 miles off the coast of
Ecuador, to commemorate the 100 th
anniversary of the voyage of
Charles Darwin to the Galapagos
Islands.
He hopes to make the islands a
natural history reservation where
naturalists can study the life and
conditions as they actually are
rather than destroy the birds and
animals in order to stuff them for
museums. But the United States is
going to lease the islands from Ecua
dor for a naval base as they are im
portant for the defense of the Pana
ma Canal.
Around 1812, the islands were a
favorite haunt of English pirates and
whaling ships, said Dr. von Hagen.
The author of "Moby Dick," Her
man Melville, visited the islands at
one time. The pirates named the
numerous islands after the kings of
England.
SAILORS EAT CACTUS
Early sailors stopped at the
islands, said Dr. von Hagen, to eat
the cactus in order to keep them
from getting scurvy. They believed
the waters to be enchanted, for the
wind went in one direction while
the current went in the other. This
is due to the cold current which
flows up the coast of South America
and branches out to hit the islands,
causing the climate there to be
much different from any other ter
ritory on the equator.
The islands, which geologists say
are over 60 million years old, were
formed by successive waves of lava,
and the volcanoes there are still
active.
In 1835, Charles Darwin, who was
on his way home to train for the
clergy, landed on the islands. The
unique animal life there, which is
so different from that on the nearby
coast of Ecuador, changed his ideas
and acted as a stimulus for his the
ory of evolution which was later to
be the greatest enemy of the church.
GALAPAGOS—TORTOISES
The islands are named after the
tortoise, for they are the home of
hundreds of these giant animals. In
1840 it was said that 235,000 tor
toises were killed by visiting sailors.
The tortoise lives off cactus, can go
for a whole year without water, and
lives to be some 250 years old.
Dr. von Hagen illustrated his lec
ture with slides of photographs
which he had taken while living on
the islands. He is the author of
several books and has contributed
scientific articles to Nature, Scien
tific Monthly, and Fortune.

from getting scurvy. They believed
the waters to be enchanted, for the
wind went in one direction while
the current went in the other. This
is due to the cold current which
flows up the coast of South America
and branches out to hit the islands,
causing the climate there to be
much different from any other ter
ritory on the equator.
The islands, which geologists say
are over 60 million years old, were
formed by successive waves of lava,
and the volcanoes there are still
active.
In 1835, Charles Darwin, who was
on his way home to train for the
clergy, landed on the islands. The
unique animal life there, which is
so different from that on the nearby
coast of Ecuador, changed his ideas
and acted as a stimulus for his the
ory of evolution which was later to
be the greatest enemy of the church.
GALAPAGOS—TORTOISES
The islands are named after the
tortoise, for they are the home of
hundreds of these giant animals. In
1840 it was said that 235,000 tor
toises were killed by visiting sailors.
The tortoise lives off cactus, can go
for a whole year without water, and
lives to be some 250 years old.
Dr. von Hagen illustrated his lec

which he had taken while living on
the islands. He is the author of
several books and has contributed
scientific articles to Nature, Scien

Around 1812, the islands were a
