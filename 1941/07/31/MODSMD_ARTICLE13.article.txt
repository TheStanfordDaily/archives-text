# Propaganda Play to Open Three-night Run Tonight
## 'Thunder Rock' Tells Of Hope for Future 
### JANE GLASSON 
"Thunder Rock," a play of hope
in the future through faith in the
past, by Robert Ardrey, opens to
night in the Memorial Hall audi
torium at 8:15 for a three-night run.
It is the first propaganda play
dealing with a controversial subject
to be produced by the Stanford
Players.
REACTIONS VARY
Audiences who have seen the en
tirely modern play have reacted
strangely, and differently, to its in
fluences. When it was first pro
duced in New York two years ago
and talked of courage and faith, it
didn't hit a responsive chord with
its audiences because the New York
of two years ago didn't have faith
and courage. It was the time after
Munich and just before Cchecho
slovakia. People saw the coming
disaster and just weren't in the
mood for a dose of hope in the fu
ture.
But in London the play is the big
gest of wartime successes. After the
bombings of the city, the London
ers had faith, hope, and courage,
where before there had been only
fear, and "Thunder Rock" still plays
to sold-out houses on nights when
there are no air raids.
INTERVENTIONIST
As F. Cowles Strickland, director
of the Stanford Players, said, "The
thing that interests me most about
'Thunder Rock' is how the audience
will react to its distinctly interven
tionalist ideas. Two years ago the
entire country was non-interven
tionalistic. It was still the time of
war-zones and embargos. How far
we've moed towards intervention —
whether 'Thunder Rock' with its
ideas that nothing past has been so
bad that we haven't lived through
it is now ahead or behind the times
in America — will show up in the
way in which the audience accepts
this play tonight.
"I'm sure the audience will see a
good performance and excellent act
ing, but whether they'll like the
play, I don't know," Mr. Strickland
added. " 'Thunder Rock' is no diet
for simpering dilletantes, for it's a
coats-off, sleeves-rolled-up play
fighting for what it's talking about,
and I don't know whether Stanford
enjoys thinking as an intellectual
pleasure."
The cast is exceptionally strong,
including three campus favorites of
the past: J. P. Cahn as Captain
Joshua, Dana Winters as Dr. Stefan
Kurtz, and Patricia Allen as Me
lanie.
Lyle Mayer as Streeter and Nor
man Philbrick as Charleston are
both experienced actors.
The rest of the cast includes:
Nonny, Richard Rosenblatt; Inspec
tor Flanning, Burdette Miller;
Briggs, Robert Bettencourt; Anne
Marie, Roberta Blomquist; Miss
Kirby, Dorothy Weaver; Chang,
Nicolas Vogulkin; and Cassidy, a
character added to the original cast
by Mr. Strickland, Charles Henry
Howe.
Reservations may be had by call
ing Palo Alto 22041 between 9 a.m.
and 5 p.m. Tickets are 50 cents.

to sold-out houses on nights when
there are no air raids.
INTERVENTIONIST
As F. Cowles Strickland, director
of the Stanford Players, said, "The
thing that interests me most about
'Thunder Rock' is how the audience
will react to its distinctly interven
tionalist ideas. Two years ago the
entire country was non-interven
tionalistic. It was still the time of
war-zones and embargos. How far
we've moed towards intervention —
whether 'Thunder Rock' with its
ideas that nothing past has been so
bad that we haven't lived through
it is now ahead or behind the times
in America — will show up in the
way in which the audience accepts
this play tonight.
"I'm sure the audience will see a
good performance and excellent act
ing, but whether they'll like the
play, I don't know," Mr. Strickland
added. " 'Thunder Rock' is no diet
for simpering dilletantes, for it's a
coats-off, sleeves-rolled-up play
fighting for what it's talking about,
and I don't know whether Stanford
enjoys thinking as an intellectual
pleasure."
The cast is exceptionally strong,
including three campus favorites of
the past: J. P. Cahn as Captain
Joshua, Dana Winters as Dr. Stefan
Kurtz, and Patricia Allen as Me
lanie.
Lyle Mayer as Streeter and Nor
man Philbrick as Charleston are
both experienced actors.
The rest of the cast includes:
Nonny, Richard Rosenblatt; Inspec
tor Flanning, Burdette Miller;
Briggs, Robert Bettencourt; Anne
Marie, Roberta Blomquist; Miss
Kirby, Dorothy Weaver; Chang,
Nicolas Vogulkin; and Cassidy, a
character added to the original cast
by Mr. Strickland, Charles Henry
Howe.
Reservations may be had by call
ing Palo Alto 22041 between 9 a.m.
and 5 p.m. Tickets are 50 cents.
"Thunder Rock," a play of hope
in the future through faith in the
past, by Robert Ardrey, opens to
night in the Memorial Hall audi
torium at 8:15 for a three-night run.
It is the first propaganda play
dealing with a controversial subject
to be produced by the Stanford
Players.
REACTIONS VARY
Audiences who have seen the en
tirely modern play have reacted
strangely, and differently, to its in
fluences. When it was first pro
duced in New York two years ago
and talked of courage and faith, it
didn't hit a responsive chord with
its audiences because the New York
of two years ago didn't have faith
and courage. It was the time after
Munich and just before Cchecho
slovakia. People saw the coming
disaster and just weren't in the
mood for a dose of hope in the fu
ture.
But in London the play is the big
gest of wartime successes. After the
bombings of the city, the London
ers had faith, hope, and courage,
where before there had been only
fear, and "Thunder Rock" still plays
to sold-out houses on nights when
there are no air raids.
