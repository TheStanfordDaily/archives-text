# Explorer Talks On Latin Trade
## Von Hagen Discusses Western Hemisphere 
### 
"We have a great opportunity to
unite with South America, eco
nomically and culturally," said Vic
tor Wolfgang von Hagen. "We have
in the Western Hemisphere only two
important languages, Spanish and
English, while Europe, which also
wishes to gain control of South
America, has numerous languages."
Dr. von Hagen was sitting in the
Green Room behind the stage of the
Stanford Memorial Hall. He had
just finished his lecture for the
Tuesday Evening Series.
"If we would trade more with
South America," he said, "we could
keep her friendship. Today we are
buying our tin from the Dutch East
Indies, while there are as yet un
developed great tin deposits in Bo
livia.
ANTI-HITLER COUNTRIES
"While we insist that it is cheaper
to buy our tin from the Dutch East
Indies," said Dr. von Hagen, "it
costs much more to defend our in
terests in the Far East."
Dr. von Hagen said that all of the
South American countries are anti-
Hitler, but not all of them are anti-
German.
Having traveled extensively about
the Latin American countries, Dr.
von Hagen has become very familiar
with the people. He lived with the
head hunters in the Amazon coun
try for some time and learned to
speak their language. He said that
the natives and the animals in that
country don't bother travelers. Only
the insects get after the men.
BRAVE RHINO
"The rhinocerous is the only ani
mal that will attack a man," said
Dr. von Hagen, "and he would chase
a locomotive."
"The Latin Americans like Don
ald Duck better than Mickey Mouse.
They don't like Robert Taylor," con
tinued Dr. von Hagen, "and they
think that American college life is
typified by Betty Grable."
