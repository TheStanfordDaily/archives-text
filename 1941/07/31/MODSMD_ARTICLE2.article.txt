chairman of draft board number 86
in San Francisco.
Father Moskovitz was planning to
draft the 23-year-old twins next

for him. They went down to Mof

for three years as members of the
fourth photographic squadron at
tached to the air base.

twins will not be playing tricks on
their father, professors, or friends.
