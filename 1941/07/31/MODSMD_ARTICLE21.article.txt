# Frozen Credits Hit Farm Press
## 
### 
The freezing of the Japanese as
sets in this country by President
Roosevelt has directly affected the
Stanford University Press by taking
its best foreign customer in scientific
books.
The Japanese have for several
years been their best buyers of phys
ical science books of all types, but
have bought comparatively few other
kinds of books.
It is hoped by managers of the
Press, however, that this situation is
only temporary. If the present situa
tion continues permits probably
will be issued by the government
permitting the export of the re
quested books to Japan.
