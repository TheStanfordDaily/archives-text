## Indian Netters Win In New York, Canada 
### 
Stanford's top tennis players for
next year, Ted Schroeder and Em
ery Neale, continued their winning
ways by advancing to third rounds
of their respective tournaments, the
Southampton Invitational and the
Vancouver Championships.
Schroeder, ranked among the first
half dozen players in the country
due to his recent triumphs, defeated
Victor Seixas, national interscholas
tic champion, and Bill Judson of
Phoenix in successive matches on
Monday at the Long Island, New
York, tennis club.
Equally successful was Neale, who
put Jim Fleming out of the British
Columbia tourney with ease, 6-1,
6-1. Jack Gurley, another Indian,
entered in the Canadian matches,
drew a bye for the day's play.
Larry Dee and Jimmy Wade, ace
Farm doubles combination, are also
touring the eastern circuit, but are
not competing in the Southampton
tournament.
