# Brown Discovers Owl in Libe Belfry
## 
### 
Finding the highest "tree" on the
campus, a barn owl has built its
nest in the northeast pinnacle at the
top of the Hoover Library on a
level wtih the belfry and nearly 250
feet from the ground.
And in that nest there are now
two young ones whose hungry
screeching may be heard, along with
the tower chimes, even from the
ground in the quiet of twilight.
