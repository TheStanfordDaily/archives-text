# Dr. Robinson Celebrates 30 Years at Farm
## 
### K. G. IVES, JR 
Thirty years ago this month Edgar
Eugene Robinson walked up Palm
Drive to become, at 23, the youngest
member of the Farm's history de
partment.
The Farm has changed a great
deal since then; not only have many
new buildings been added, but many
new educational programs have
arisen from Stanford's progressive
leadership in the educational field.
One of the more outstanding de
partures from conventional scholas
tic procedure has been the inde
pendent study program. Professor
Robinson has been a member of the
18-man committee which has guided
the development of the program
here at Stanford since its inception
in 1925, and he has been chairman
of the committee since 1928.
STUDY PLAN UNIQUE
Although some other schools have
somewhat similar programs, Profes
sor Robinson feels that the develop
ment of independent study here at
Stanford has been unique. While he
believes that independent study is
no substitute for the ordinary meth
od of education, it is of infinite
value for a limited number, espe
cially qualified students.
As a rule only one-third of the
student's scholastic program is han
dled under the independent study
program, with the other two-thirds
consisting of the normal schedule of
classes, lectures, and labs. The stu
dent who works under the inde
pendent study program must have a
definite plan for the development of
his education while at Stanford, and
he must be adapted for studying on
his own initiative.
ORAL EXAMINATIONS
Professor Robinson considers one
of the most important features of the
plan to be the oral examination cov
ering the entire field of his inde
pendent project that each student
must take before graduation. This
oral examination is of great im
portance became the ability to ex-
press one's self well and defend
one's self orally is one of the real
tests of success in any field of higher
endeavor.
In all, 120 students have been
graduated under this plan during
the 16 years it has been in opera
tion here at Stanford. The number
of students working under this plan
is of necessity restricted because
the limited number of professors,
and their limited time does not al
low for the individual instruction
necessary under this plan.
But the independent study pro
gram is only one of the varied in
terests of Professor Robinson. He is
also the chairman of the Public Ex
ercises Committee which is in charge
of bringing outside educational and
cultural groups and speakers to the
campus.
Besides holding the Margaret
Byrne Chair of American History
and having varied interests and ac
tivities, during the past ten years
he has served from time to time as
acting president of Stanford during
Dr. Wilbur's occasional absences.
This Sunday Professor Robinson
will be the speaker at the 11 o'clock
service in the Stanford Chapel. His
subject will be "Faith and the Uni
versity."

partment.
The Farm has changed a great
deal since then; not only have many
new buildings been added, but many
new educational programs have
arisen from Stanford's progressive
leadership in the educational field.
One of the more outstanding de
partures from conventional scholas
tic procedure has been the inde
pendent study program. Professor
Robinson has been a member of the
18-man committee which has guided
the development of the program
here at Stanford since its inception
in 1925, and he has been chairman
of the committee since 1928.
STUDY PLAN UNIQUE
Although some other schools have
somewhat similar programs, Profes
sor Robinson feels that the develop
ment of independent study here at
Stanford has been unique. While he
believes that independent study is
no substitute for the ordinary meth
od of education, it is of infinite
value for a limited number, espe
cially qualified students.
As a rule only one-third of the
student's scholastic program is han
dled under the independent study
program, with the other two-thirds
consisting of the normal schedule of
classes, lectures, and labs. The stu
dent who works under the inde
pendent study program must have a
definite plan for the development of
his education while at Stanford, and
he must be adapted for studying on
his own initiative.
ORAL EXAMINATIONS
Professor Robinson considers one
of the most important features of the
plan to be the oral examination cov
ering the entire field of his inde
pendent project that each student
must take before graduation. This
oral examination is of great im
portance became the ability to ex-
press one's self well and defend
one's self orally is one of the real
tests of success in any field of higher
endeavor.
In all, 120 students have been
graduated under this plan during
the 16 years it has been in opera
tion here at Stanford. The number
of students working under this plan
is of necessity restricted because
the limited number of professors,
and their limited time does not al
low for the individual instruction
necessary under this plan.
But the independent study pro
gram is only one of the varied in
terests of Professor Robinson. He is
also the chairman of the Public Ex
ercises Committee which is in charge
of bringing outside educational and
cultural groups and speakers to the
campus.
Besides holding the Margaret
Byrne Chair of American History
and having varied interests and ac
tivities, during the past ten years
he has served from time to time as
acting president of Stanford during
Dr. Wilbur's occasional absences.
This Sunday Professor Robinson
will be the speaker at the 11 o'clock
service in the Stanford Chapel. His
subject will be "Faith and the Uni
versity."
