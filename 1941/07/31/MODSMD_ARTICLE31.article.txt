# Dean Praises Summer Plan
## Miss Doyle Declares Quarter 'Valuable' 
### 
The attractions of special courses
and the addition of a fine visiting
faculty make this summer quarter of
increased value to the student, Miss
Anastasia Doyle, dean of women for
the summer session, declared re
cently.
"In general it seems to me that
undergraduate students could make
more use of summer quarter than
they do," Miss Doyle continued.
"Many advantages not offered dur
ing the year: small classes, more
emphasis on the academic side, ex
tra attractions in drama and music.
"Therefore, I would like to con
gratulate the students who are here
on their superior judgment in com
ing this summer."
Of the entire registration of wom
en students responsible to the Dean
of Women's office, there are 109 un
dergraduates in residence, Miss
Doyle revealed. There are 82 new
undergraduates: 41 freshman wom
en, 12 sophomores, and 29 upper di
vision students.
All houses of the Union unit are
open with the exception of Mariposa
House, she added.
