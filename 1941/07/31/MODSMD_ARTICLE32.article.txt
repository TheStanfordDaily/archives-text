"States in danger of federal domi
nance are likely to escape only if
they become more effective agencies
of government and administration,
and if they accept the program of
federal co-operation," Dr. Leonard
D. White said yesterday afternoon
in his lecture in the Women's Club
house. "They may become partners
of the federal government but they
can never hope to be successful
rivals," he added.
Dr. White, who is professor of po
litical science and public adminis
tration at the University of Chicago
and acting professor of political
science at Stanford, discussed in his
lecture the balance of power be
tween the national and state gov
ernments.
He described "The march of power
from the city hall and the county
court house to the state capital and
from the state capital to Washing
ton, D.C.," and continued by saying,
"The original rivalry of the states
and the nation in the Constitutional
realm was ended by the Civil War.
Shortly after the national govern
ment instituted an administrative
rivalry by entering the field of con
current jurisdiction, first in the reg
ulation of railroad rates and serv
ices."
