As part of the National Defense
Research program, Stanford's phys
iology department is preparing to
conduct a study with 100 of Stan
ford's men students in order to de
vise a standard method of deter
mining eligibility for the air service.
The men will be picked from the
same age, weight, and height range
as those who would qualify for the
air service, and will be tested in
various medical ways.
Those chosen for the experiment,
which will take an hour and a half
will be contacted by the physiology
department.
