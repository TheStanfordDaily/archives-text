# Heffner to Talk On Melodrama
## 
### 
Tracing briefly the factors of de
velopment in the field of melodrama,
Dr. Hubert Heffner of the depart
ment of drama will speak to the
Dramatists' Alliance next Monday
evening at 8 in the lounge of the
Women's Clubhouse.
The word "melodrama" is gener
ally greatly misunderstood, accord
ing to Dr. Heffner. It has a definite
meaning in the theater, but the
meaning varies from time to time.
The most interesting character in
melodrama, Dr. Heffner says, is the
villain, who is an interpretation of
the prejudices of the age which
gave him birth.
