## Defense Commission To Meet This Month 
### 
Forty-five colleges and universi
ties in the seven western states have
accepted invitations to become mem
bers of a commission to educate se
lective serice boards to utilize best
trained civilians in national defense,
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur announced
yesterday.
The institutions will send dele
gates to a conference of the com
mission which will be held late in
August, the president added.
The commission was formed fol
lowing the proposal of Dr. Wilbur at
the close of the Pacific Regional
Conference on Higher Education held
here in June. The delegates to the
commission will represent all the
fields that have been declared espe
cially valuable to national defense
in industry and the laboratory. The
educators will study, plan and pro
pose far-reaching policies designed
to unite higher education centers in
the area in contributing to national
defense and general social welfare.
Although the commission was
formed in June members have al
ready helped individually. Dr. Wil
bur declared. The situation for con
serving the resources of specialists
"looks much better," he added.
