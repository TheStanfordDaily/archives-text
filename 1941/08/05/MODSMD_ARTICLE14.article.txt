# Series Shows Bali Film In Auditorium Tonight
## Wajan, Island Hero, Heads Native Cast 
### 
A picture filmed on the island of
Bali with an entire native cast —
"Wajan"—will be shown tonight on
the Tuesday Evening Series in Me
morial Auditorium at 8 pjn. The
story itself is a product of Bali, for
the picture is based on a legend of a
heroic Balinese tribesman.
In addition to the natural set
tings, native dialogue, and music,
the film will show the ritual of the
"trance" dance of the Balinese
maidens. This dance is a fervent
offering to the Balinese gods, and
while the young dancers are in a
semiconscious state, they are be
lieved by the natives of Bali to be
able to cast an evil spell on an
enemy, who will promptly fall dead.
The dance ritual was filmed under
the light of a flickering tropical bon
fire in front of the moonlit temple
of the god Rangda.
Wajan, from whom the picture
receives its title, is the name of a
native boy who sacrificed his love
for his mother to save his people.
Wajan's mother is said to be a witch
and is supposed to have brought
pestilence and plague on the village
of Gedulu. Wajan, scorned because
he is a witch's son, determines to set
his people free by setting out on a
dangerous journey into the Balinese
jungle.
The picture, which is directed by
Walter Spies, was produced in
Gjanjar. English titles tell the com
plete story and a musical score ac
companies the picture. The film
runs 60 minutes.
