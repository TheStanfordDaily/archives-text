# 'Thunder Rock' Audience Gets Dose of Optimism for Future
## 
### JANE GLASSON 
"Thunder Rock," a play born in<
the mixed-up world of two years
ago and designed to give skeptical
humanity a good dose of hope in the
future through faith in the past,
played last Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday nights in the Memorial
Auditorium. It was a good selection
to give before a university audience
whose faith at this point could stand
buoying up, but whether it took or
not is another question.
The play itself was propaganda,
pure and simple, but its message was
a commendable one. It's true that
nothing in the past has been so bad
that we haven't lived through it,
but it is rather hard for the average
member of the younger generation
to hold a great deal for the future
when there are so many ideas of
what is good and what is bad in the
world today.
REALISTIC SETTING
The action of "Thunder Rock"
took place in the excellent setting,
thanks to William Girvan, of a
lonely lighthouse on Lake Michi
gan. The lighthouse keeper, played
admirably by Norman Philbrick, has
taken up his job in order to escape

►from a world which he has found
detestable, which is too much for
his own individual conscience. There
he lives alone with his dreams
which take the form of the people
in a ship that was wrecked on the
rock of this lighthouse 90 years ago.
These creatures of his mind are
people who were fleeing from the
disturbed Europe of 1849. Each in
his escape has an element of despair.
But the lighthouse keeper, in ex
plaining to them how their prob
lems were solved soon after their
deaths, perceives the application of
his argument to his own escapist
ideas. The torment of his own soul
is solved and he sets out into the
world again.
IDEALISTIC STORY
It's a rugged story, but a pretty
one—the kind we'd all like to be
lieve.
Perhaps it is a little early to talk
to Americans of hope. At least, right
now the people who will live and
make tomorrow aren't idealistic
enough to fully appreciate such a
play as "Thunder Rock." For those
who have lived longer in this compli
cated world and have found them
selves in positions where hope is a
last resort, this play seems to be
designed.
At least, it was good solid enter
tainment and thought stimulating
enough to make one remember its
message and hope it is true.
J. P. Cahn, Patricia Allen, and
Robert Bettencourt turned in ex
cellent performances, and the rest
of the cast were good enough to make
"Thunder Rock" outstanding as a
college production.

buoying up, but whether it took or
not is another question.
The play itself was propaganda,
pure and simple, but its message was
a commendable one. It's true that
nothing in the past has been so bad
that we haven't lived through it,
but it is rather hard for the average
member of the younger generation
to hold a great deal for the future
when there are so many ideas of
what is good and what is bad in the
world today.
REALISTIC SETTING
The action of "Thunder Rock"
took place in the excellent setting,
thanks to William Girvan, of a
lonely lighthouse on Lake Michi
gan. The lighthouse keeper, played
admirably by Norman Philbrick, has
taken up his job in order to escape

►from a world which he has found
detestable, which is too much for
his own individual conscience. There
he lives alone with his dreams
which take the form of the people
in a ship that was wrecked on the
rock of this lighthouse 90 years ago.
These creatures of his mind are
people who were fleeing from the
disturbed Europe of 1849. Each in
his escape has an element of despair.
But the lighthouse keeper, in ex
plaining to them how their prob
lems were solved soon after their
deaths, perceives the application of
his argument to his own escapist
ideas. The torment of his own soul
is solved and he sets out into the
world again.
IDEALISTIC STORY
It's a rugged story, but a pretty
one—the kind we'd all like to be
lieve.
Perhaps it is a little early to talk
to Americans of hope. At least, right
now the people who will live and
make tomorrow aren't idealistic
enough to fully appreciate such a
play as "Thunder Rock." For those
who have lived longer in this compli
cated world and have found them
selves in positions where hope is a
last resort, this play seems to be
designed.
At least, it was good solid enter
tainment and thought stimulating
enough to make one remember its
message and hope it is true.
J. P. Cahn, Patricia Allen, and
Robert Bettencourt turned in ex
cellent performances, and the rest
of the cast were good enough to make
"Thunder Rock" outstanding as a
college production.
"Thunder Rock," a play born in<
the mixed-up world of two years
ago and designed to give skeptical
humanity a good dose of hope in the
future through faith in the past,
played last Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday nights in the Memorial
Auditorium. It was a good selection
to give before a university audience
whose faith at this point could stand
buoying up, but whether it took or
not is another question.
