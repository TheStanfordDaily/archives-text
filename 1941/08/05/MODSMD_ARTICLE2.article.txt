# Campus Roads Being Repaired
## 
### 
Serra Street, which runs in front
of the Administration Building, is
now being graded and the palm
trees which were too old to be
transplanted have been destroyed.
Both Serra Street and Galvez
Street, which runs in front of the
B.A.C. and along the side of Encina,
are being widened, while Santa
Ynez, which is in back of the cam
pus, is being resurfaced.
Those streets on which pavement
was laid in the spring will have a
sealing coat put on in September;
meanwhile they are being pounded
down by traffic directed over them
by barriers. In a few days these
barriers will be shifted to make
traffic travel over other sections of
the roads.
