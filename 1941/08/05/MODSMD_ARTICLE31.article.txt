## Greasy Spoon Upset Features Playoffs 
### 
It will be the Lab Rats pitted
against the New Deal Prune Pick
ers this afternoon in the final game
to determine the challenger to the
champion Spar Duck team in the
Summer Softball League playoffs.
The Lab Hats defeated the Igero
dians 13 to 8 in a close struggle yes
terday afternon after trailing most
of the game, while the N.D.P.P. team
edged out the Greasy Spoons, 8 to 7,
in a game that may be replayed
since the later team had only six
men.
Friday afternoon the Greasy
Spoons lost to a team of Moffett
Field cadets, 3 to 2, due mainly to
the calibre of the army pitcher who
had been the star of the 1940 Na
tional Softball Tourney at Denver.
After the game the officers took
the team around the field and gave
them what the players described as
an excellent meal.
