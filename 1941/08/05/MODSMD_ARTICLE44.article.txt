# Library Receives First Band Photo
## 
### 
A photograph of the first Stanford
band, taken in 1892 and believed to
be the oldest extant, has been re
ceived by the university for its Stan
ford Collection from Alumnus E. N.
Murray, of Tacoma, Wash.
Mr. Murray played the clarinet,
the photo reveals, and with him in
the woodwind section was the late
Dr. Henry Harris, piccolo. William
H. Harrelson, general manager of
the Golden Gate Bridge district, is
shown with a cornet in hand. Four
teen players blew and drummed for
Stanford in the fall of '92, and at
least as far as the photo reveals,
they had no uniforms but played in
the tight-buttoned jackets and
bowler hats of the time.
The photograph, accompanied by
one showing of Dr. David Starr Jor
dan and a group of the early Stan
ford faculty, will be held to complete
the Stanford Library's files of early
Stanfordiana.
