## 
### 
J. Murray Luck, associate profes
sor of biochemistry at Stanford, ad
vocates establishing a price differen
tial in favor of whole wheat bread
through government subsidy sup
ported by a tax on white bread in
a report to the journal, Science.
He also proposes extension of the
existing school lunch program so
that every child will "receive in the
schools one thoroughly good meal
every day" as the second part of his
program to bring about the well
being of the low-income groups who
are now the greatest sufferers from
malnutrition.
The other merit of the program,
Dr. Luck declares in the Science
article, is that it is capable of im
mediate execution.
