# White Predicts Shift of Power To Washington
## Summer Professor Says States to Lose Power During Crisis 
### BARBARA BADGER 
Reiterating the opinions voiced in
his Wednesday's lecture in the
Women's Clubhouse, Leonard D.
White declared yesterday that dur
ing the present crisis in world affairs
and during the near future there will
be an increasing tendency for the
authority to shift from the indi
vidual states to Washington, D.C.
Dr. White, acting professor in po
litical science and public administra
tion during the summer quarter,
also remarked that in his opinion the
states will be unable to collect as
much money in taxes as they have
been in the past.
RESULT OF TAXES
This handicap to the states will
come as the result of the increased
federal taxes which are being voted
upon in Congress at the present
time, Dr. White said.
"There is a possibilty of a fed
eral sales tax," continued Dr. White,
"but the new source of revenue will
come mainly from a tax on excess
profits and from the development of
a new excise tax on tobacco and
liquor."
HARDEST HIT
When asked whom he thought
would suffer the most from en
forcement of the pending tax bills,
Dr. White said that probably the
people in the middle income group
will be the hardest hit.
Dr. White is a visiting expert from
the University of Chicago, where he
has taught political science and
public administration for over 20
years. He is a member of the Na
tional Institute of Public Adminis
tration and in 1923-31 served on the
Permanent Commission to the Con
gress Internationale des Sciences
Administratives.
