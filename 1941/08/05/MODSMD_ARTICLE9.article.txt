# Traffic Violators Fined by Council
## 
### 
Only two citations were given this
week to Stanford students, accord
ing to the Men's Councilâ€”one was
for speeding and the other for
parking.
There still are 17 students who
have failed to appear to answer for
their violations and are incurring an
additional fine of $1 each week.
The council has the names of these
students and are going to send them
cards so that these tickets can be
cleared up before final exams.
