Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur and ex-
President Herbert Hoover recently
joined 15 Republican leaders in an
appeal "that Congress put a stop to
step by step projection of the
United States into undeclared war."
Declaring that "naval action" and
"military occupation of bases out
side the Western Hemisphere," with
"promises of unauthorized aid to
Russia," have undermined "funda
mental principles of democratic gov
ernment," Frank O. Lowden, for
mer governor of Illinois, made the
statement public.
