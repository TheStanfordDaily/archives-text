# Nabokov Offers Reading at Series
## 
### 
Introduced as "the savior of Rus
sian literature," Vladimir Nabokov,
Russian novelist, presented a read
ing on some of his childhood impres
sions to the Wednesday afternoon
lecture series audience.
Following the classical tradition of
Russian literature, Mr. Nabokov has
given to his Russian readers that
which they could not find in any
other contemporary author. He has
interpreted naturalism and reality
without realism.
Mr. Nabokov is a visiting profes
sor at Stanford this summer.
