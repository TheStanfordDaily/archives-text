## Three Stanford Gridders Play For All-Stars Shaughnessy Refuses Head Coaching Post In Charity Contest 
### 
Stanford will be well represented
when the 1940 Collegiate All-Star
football team tangles with the Chi
cago Bears, pro champions of last
year, in the annual charity game
held in Soldiers Field, Chicago, late
in August, since Stan Graff, Hugh
Gallameau, and Norm Standlee,
graduated Indian stars, will all be
wearing the star-spangled uniforms
of the collegians.
Further distinction was given the
Farm when Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy was offered the head coaching
job of the all-stars. Shaughnessy,
however, refused their offer in fair
ness to George Halas, owner and
coach of the Bears, with whom he
has collaborated in forming the now
famous "T" formation which the
Chicago team will use during the
game.
Due to the fact that the balloting
was done under the auspices of a
Chicago newspaper and carried on
mostly throughout the Midwest, the
Pacific Coast players did not receive
votes according to their abilities,
and therefore none of the Card grid
ders will be on the first team.
However, their high value was
shown by the regard Halas has for
them, mentioning Gallarneau and
Standlee as two of the most dan
gerous men he has to face. The
Bear owner chose both Stanford
backfield aces in the National Pro
fessional League draft last winter
and will have their services next
fall.
