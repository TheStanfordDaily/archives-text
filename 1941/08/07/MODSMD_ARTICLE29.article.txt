# Softball Title Playoff Today
## 
### 
Two consecutive victories in the
playoffs have given the New Deal
Prune Pickers the right to meet the
Spar Ducks, champions of the regu
lar season's play, this afternoon on
the intramural field for the beautiful
aluminum perpetual trophy, sym
bol of superiority in the Summer
Softball League.
Latest triumph for the NDPP's
came Tuesday afternoon when they
overcame an improved Lab Rat
team, 12 to 10, in a semi-final game.
The Spar Ducks, last year's win
ners and undefeated in league play
this year, will prove the season's
highest barrier for the N.D.P.P. team
which was organized as a combina
tion of the Prune Pickers and New
Dealers, two of last summer's teams.
