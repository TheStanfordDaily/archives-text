# Schroeder Takes Two Encounters
## 
### 
Ted Schroeder, Farm net star,
continued his successful tour of the
eastern tennis circuit, by easily de
feating his first two opponents in the
Eastern Grass Court Championships
at Rye, N.Y.
Don Neil fell before the Card ace
in the first round, 6-1, 6-0, while Bob
Davis did little better in a second
round match, losing 6-1, 6-3.
