### 
Are you the "man" that girls are<
looking for?
Here's how to find out.
Stanford's physiology department
is offering physical fitness tests to
100 men students in accord with
defense research work in testing
aviation pilots. To take this test
and check up on your "Superman"
qualities all that is necessary to do
is get in touch with Dr. Craig Taylor
of the physiology department at
local 517 or in the evenings at Palo
Alto 21084. As a last resort, try

â–ºH. B. Lee at 24319.
Since these tests are primarily
research work and not an attempt to
prove the attraction of Stanford
men, those with physical defects and
outside the age, height, and weight
limits for aviation pilots will not be
accepted.
