# Mathematics Unprovable, Professor Tells Meeting
## Two-day Conference Hears Expert Describe Science as 'No Solid Rock' 
### 
Mathematics, popularly thought to be the one solid rock of logic in an
illogical world, is itself but based on postulates that in the ultimate cannot
be proved, Professor E. T. Bell of the California Institute of Technology
said yesterday as the opening speaker in the Stanford mathematics con
ference. The conference, last of the summer series arranged for Stanford's

►fiftieth anniversary celebration, will
continue through today.
Instead of a cut and dried science,
mathematics was pictured by Pro
fessor Bell as something still in a
process of evolution after more
than 2,000 years of earnest thinking
by seekers after truth.
Speaking on "Truth and Mathe
matics," he said that it has never
yet been possible to prove the
completeness of any system of logic.
Carried far enough, questioning
will raise inconsistencies that can
not be settled.
"My own conclusion," he said, "is
that if you want to look for truth
in mathematisc you will be looking
a long time."
SKETCHES HISTORY
Professor Bell sketched the history
of mathematical thought since the
first true mathematics was devel
oped in the time of the ancient
Greeks. Never has there been a
period when mathematics was not
expanding, earlier concepts being
contested and new ones developed,
he said. It was only in 1889 that
the complicated symbols of modern
mathematics began to be widely
used. In 1910 Whitehead and Rus
sell, seeking to answer the question
of the relation between mathematics
and the universe as a whole, pub
lished their "Principa Mathematica"
