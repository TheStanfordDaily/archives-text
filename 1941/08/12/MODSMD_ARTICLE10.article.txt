# Mathematics Unprovable, Professor Tells Meeting
## Two-day Conference Hears Expert Describe Science as 'No Solid Rock' 
### 
Mathematics, popularly thought to be the one solid rock of logic in an
illogical world, is itself but based on postulates that in the ultimate cannot
be proved, Professor E. T. Bell of the California Institute of Technology
said yesterday as the opening speaker in the Stanford mathematics con
ference. The conference, last of the summer series arranged for Stanford's

►fiftieth anniversary celebration, will
continue through today.
Instead of a cut and dried science,
mathematics was pictured by Pro
fessor Bell as something still in a
process of evolution after more
than 2,000 years of earnest thinking
by seekers after truth.
Speaking on "Truth and Mathe
matics," he said that it has never
yet been possible to prove the
completeness of any system of logic.
Carried far enough, questioning
will raise inconsistencies that can
not be settled.
"My own conclusion," he said, "is
that if you want to look for truth
in mathematisc you will be looking
a long time."
SKETCHES HISTORY
Professor Bell sketched the history
of mathematical thought since the
first true mathematics was devel
oped in the time of the ancient
Greeks. Never has there been a
period when mathematics was not
expanding, earlier concepts being
contested and new ones developed,
he said. It was only in 1889 that
the complicated symbols of modern
mathematics began to be widely
used. In 1910 Whitehead and Rus
sell, seeking to answer the question
of the relation between mathematics
and the universe as a whole, pub
lished their "Principa Mathematica"
contending that mathematics and
logic ax - e one.
But German mathematicians never
accepted that reasoning and one
went so far as to divorce mathe
matics from meaning entirely, con
sidering it as merely a method of
analysis, Professor Bell said.
STATISTICS SYMPOSIUM
Professor Bell was followed by
Professor H. F. Blichfeldt, emeritus
head of the Stanford department,
who spoke on the geometry of num
bers. Yesterday afternoon Profes
sor G. Polya of Brown University,
Professor J. Neyman of the Univer
sity of California, and Professor A.
Zygmund of Mount Holyoke College
conducted a symposium on the
higher mathematics of statistics.
Speakers today will include Pro
fessor G. T. Whybum of the Uni
versity of Virginia, Professor A. D.
Michal of the California Institute
of Technology, Professor E. Hille of
Yale University, and Professor
Polya and Zygmund.

of the relation between mathematics
and the universe as a whole, pub

But German mathematicians never
accepted that reasoning and one

analysis, Professor Bell said.
STATISTICS SYMPOSIUM
Professor Bell was followed by
Professor H. F. Blichfeldt, emeritus
head of the Stanford department,
who spoke on the geometry of num
bers. Yesterday afternoon Profes
sor G. Polya of Brown University,
Professor J. Neyman of the Univer
sity of California, and Professor A.
Zygmund of Mount Holyoke College
conducted a symposium on the
higher mathematics of statistics.
Speakers today will include Pro
fessor G. T. Whybum of the Uni

of Technology, Professor E. Hille of
Yale University, and Professor
Polya and Zygmund.

Mathematics, popularly thought to be the one solid rock of logic in an
illogical world, is itself but based on postulates that in the ultimate cannot
be proved, Professor E. T. Bell of the California Institute of Technology
said yesterday as the opening speaker in the Stanford mathematics con
ference. The conference, last of the summer series arranged for Stanford's

►fiftieth anniversary celebration, will
continue through today.
Instead of a cut and dried science,
mathematics was pictured by Pro
fessor Bell as something still in a
process of evolution after more
than 2,000 years of earnest thinking
by seekers after truth.
Speaking on "Truth and Mathe
matics," he said that it has never
yet been possible to prove the
completeness of any system of logic.
Carried far enough, questioning
will raise inconsistencies that can
not be settled.
"My own conclusion," he said, "is
that if you want to look for truth
in mathematisc you will be looking
a long time."
SKETCHES HISTORY
Professor Bell sketched the history
of mathematical thought since the
first true mathematics was devel
oped in the time of the ancient
Greeks. Never has there been a
period when mathematics was not
expanding, earlier concepts being
contested and new ones developed,
he said. It was only in 1889 that
the complicated symbols of modern
mathematics began to be widely
used. In 1910 Whitehead and Rus
sell, seeking to answer the question
of the relation between mathematics
and the universe as a whole, pub
