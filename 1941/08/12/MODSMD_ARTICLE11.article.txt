# Guerard Tells Fate of France
## Professor Writes Of France's Future 
### 
"France will probably never be
come a major power again," said
Albert L. Guerard, professor of gen
eneral literature, in an interview to
the Stanford Daily yesterday, "but
will be either a part of a Nazi-domi
nated Europe or one of a group of
countries in a federation of free
states."
Dr. Guerard, who has just writ
ten a book entitled "The France of
Tomorrow," declared against the
re-establishing of the major power
system after the present war, since
the majority of European wars are
fought between groups of powerful
nations.
Dr. Guerard feels that the fed
eration of Europe into separate
states according to language groups
is impossible since there are so many
bi-lingual countries and minorities
groups, but some system of federa
tion can be devised such as that of
the Soviet Union or the Indian Em
pire where many racial groups are
unified into single states.
The British Empire is learning its
lesson in this war, said Dr. Gue
rard, and is discovering the futility
of a combination of powers against
Germany since the Nazis have
proven themselves capable of meet
ing any group of powers created so
far in this war.
