Twelve 21-year-old Stanford men

and S-2296 received questionnaires
from the Palo Alto Selective Service
Board during the last few days,
local draft officials announced yes
terday.
Medical examinations will prob

how quickly the questionnaires are
returned, officials said. Arrange
ments will be made for Stanford
students to be examined in the Men's

Although there is no information
as to the exact dates that the recent
registrants will be called into mili

Donovan said recently that the first

be inducted sometime in September.
