# Spar Duck Win Takes Trophy
## Ned Johns' Fielding Turns Game's Tide 
### 
Despite an early lead piled up by
the improved New Deal Prune
Picker team, the Spar Ducks won
their second successive summer
softball title by taking the cham
pionship game last week, 4 to 2.
Main factors in the showing of
the defending champs were the
above-average pitching of Bob
Berry and the superlative outfield
ing of Ned Johns. Johns came
through with two impossible catches
in crucial moments of the game to
turn the tide of battle.
Dr. Grayson Kefauver presented
the winners with the beautiful tro
phy. Cliff Wells and Bob Burnett
did alert jobs of umpiring, but did
not have to eject anyone from the
game.
The league games this summer
have been featured by brilliant
pitching on nearly all the teams.
Berry, Harry Booth of the Greasy
Spoons, and Woodie of the Socialists
consistently gave excellent perform
ances.
