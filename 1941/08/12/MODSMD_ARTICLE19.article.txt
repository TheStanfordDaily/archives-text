# Schroeder Wins Eastern Crown
## 
### 
The Eastern Grass Court Tennis
Championships doubles title was
added to the already-long list of
crowns worn by Stanford's number
one netman, Ted Schroeder, when
he and his partner, Jack Kramer,
took a straight set victory over
Bobby Riggs and Gene Mako, 9-7,
9-7, 6-2, Sunday at Rye, N.Y.
Schroeder was put out of the
singles in the quarter-final round
by Frank Kovacs, 6-2, 7-5. How
ever, Kovacs went on to win from
Don McNeil and Wayne Smith with
equal ease to take the singles crown.
The Farm ace and his partner ex
perienced their greatest difficulty in
their semi-final match with Sabin
and Gardner Mulloy, with whom
Schroeder paired to take the New
York title at Southampton last
week. The match ended 6-8, 6-1,
6-4, 6-4.
In the seedings for the next big
tourney on the circuit, the Newport
Casino Invitational, which opened
yesterday, Schroeder was ranked
fourth with only McNeil, Parker,
and Sabin ahead of him.
