THE ELECTRIC EYE removes the element of error from measurement
of high jumps, in the new device shown in first trial by General
Electric engineers in interscholastic track and field meet in Schenec
tady, N.Y. Box shown on left standard projects four parallel beams
of light one inch apart which record height of jump within three
inch variation. The bar is left on the standards to guide the jumper.
