# Program Given for Parents Ends Summer Boys Training
## 
### 
Highlighted by a program given 4
for the parents last Saturday night,
the summer boys' program given by
Stanford under the direction of
Coach Harry Maloney wound up
this year's six-week period of
training.
For the far-too-meager sum of $5
all boys in the Palo Alto region
could take the course which met
for three hours five afternoons a
week and learn swimming, boxing,
softball, touch football, soccer, bas
ketball, tennis, and relay racing.
In the words of Mr. Maloney the
program was far too much of a suc
cess since the original 30 which
signed up at the beginning of the
summer had enlarged to 77 by the
time the program was well under
way. This made the group too large
for Mr. Maloney and his assistants,
Coacnes Clayton Frye, Ellwyn

•Bugge, and Nort Thornton to handle
with the best results.
Due to the great success of this,
the first year, the program will be
continued next summer at a
slightly increased fee for the expert
teaching and excellent facilities.
