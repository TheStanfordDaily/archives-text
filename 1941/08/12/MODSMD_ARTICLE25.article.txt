# Heldman Annexes Stanford Title
## 
### 
As expected, Julius Heldman,
Stanford graduate student and
former national junior champion,
easily won the men's singles title in
the First Annual Stanford Summer
Tennis Tournament, defeating Ben
Olsen of Palo Alto in the finals,
6-4, 6-4.
The former U.C.L.A. ace's only
serious threat was removed when
Larry Dee, captain of the 1942
Stanford team, entered only the
doubles division, from which he and
his partner were eliminated in the
quarter-finals.
Bill Moore and Russ Mills an
nexed the doubles final by outlast
ing Larry Hall, former Farm netter,
and Ken McCarthy, 7-9, 6-4, 7-5.
