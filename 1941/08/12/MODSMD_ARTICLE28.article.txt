# Mrs. Stanford's Statement Reveals Chapel Site Meaning

### 
A quotation of Mrs. Leland Stan
ford in a display case in front of
the Memorial Church upholds her
reasons for locating the church in
the center of the Quad and its sig
nificance in student life:
"For no amount of learning can
take the place of decency, and no
amount of science can take the place
of backbone. And as the moral and
spiritual life is more important than
the life of our bodies, so moral and
spiritual instruction is more im
portant to young people than in
struction of any other kind. That is
why I think the church should be
the heart and center of this univer
sity.
"I am aware of the fact that com
plaint has been made that the
church was put where the library
ought to be. That view can be de
fended, but on the highest possible
grounds there is nothing so im
portant to the young men and
young women who come here as
the instruction they should get from
that pulpit. And that is why I said
that while my heart is in the uni
versity, my soul is in the church.
Take away the moral and spiritual
from higher education and I want
nothing to do with this or any other
university.
"I don't mean that students re
quire instruction in doctrines; that
is just what I do not mean; and it
was for that very reason that I
wanted the church to be and remain
non-sectarian. There is more in
Christianity than doctrine. And I
want the church building to be left
open all day so that students and
others may go in and sit there in
quiet whenever they choose. It will
do them good."
