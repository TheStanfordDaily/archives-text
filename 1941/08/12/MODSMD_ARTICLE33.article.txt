# Traffic Violators Receive Tickets
## 
### 
Five Stanford students received
tickets for traffic violations last
week, according to Men's Council;
three were for speeding, one for
failure to make an arterial stop,
and one for parking.
One of the students who was
caught for speeding received an
additional fine because he had pre
viously been given a suspended fine
for another offense.
