# STUDENTS HEALTHY
## 
### 
The student health situation this
summer quarter is "about the same
as usual," say Dr. Charles Shepard
and Dr. Helen Pryor, directors of
the Men and Women Students'
Health Services, respectively. There
have been no epidemics or accidents
so far, and the usual illnesses are
bad colds.
