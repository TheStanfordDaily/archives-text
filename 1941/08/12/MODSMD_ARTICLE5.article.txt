as professor of psychology at Stan

her 90th birthday and upon that
celebration she announced that she
would devote another 10 years of her
life to the problems of the aged.
Upon giving up her post at Stan
ford Dr. Martin dropped such activi
ties as psychopathologist and chief
of mental hygiene at the San Fran
cisco Polyclinic and Mount Zion
Hospital, where she founded the
nation's first mental hygiene clinic
for pre-school-age children.
Deciding to go back to work in
1929, Dr. Martin founded the famous
"Old Age Center," where she took
aged people not as patients but as
students. She believes firmly that
in a democracy every person, in one
way or another, must make his or

good work for the remainder of her
active life.
