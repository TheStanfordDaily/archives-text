# America Need Not Fear Nisei In War Crisis, Says Student
## 
### 
Expressing the hope that the<
Nisei — American-born Japanese —
will not be the victims of a war
psychosis in the United States, Kay
Kitagawa, Stanford senior, declared
in an interview to The Daily that he
"knows for a fact that there is noth
ing to fear from those 100,000
Americans of Japanese parentage
today or in the future."
"Subjectively speaking," Kita
gawa said, "I think a break is due
to come for them from a sympa
thetic understanding of all Ameri
cans, regardless of class or society."
"It is my sincere hope—in spite of
the obvious war psychosis that is
unfortunately sweeping over the
country—that we will not be placed
in the same position as were Ger
man nationals and Americans with

names in the last World
War," he added.
1 Kitagawa is an active member of
the Stanford International Club,
was a representative to the campus
peace council in 1940, and was one
of nine American students who was
a delegate to a goodwill conference
held in Japan last summer.
RELATIONS PRECARIOUS
Describing the relations of Japan
and the United States today as in a
precarious state, Kitagawa outlined
the position of the Nisei as follows:
Japanese assets have been frozen
in this country. American assets
have been frozen in Japan.
On the Pacific Coast there are
100,000 American-born Japanese, a
number equal to the population to
the state of Nevada. How, Kita
gawa said, is the situation to affect
the Japanese in this country who
are American citizens and yet whose
parentage binds them closely to
Japan?
"Within this group of Japanese-
American citizens is the typical ar
bitrary stratification of any society,"
he added. "Yet there is a tendency
of fellow Americans to stamp them
as an unfortunate minority group,
forming a class within a class."
TIES WITH JAPAN
Continuing his outline of the
problem as it exists in the United
States Kitagawa declared that there
are sentimental ties with Japan
throughout this group, and that the
persons within it have accepted the
process of Americanization while
their racial characteristics have
made them conscious that they are,
after getting their college degrees,
not in the same categories as other
Americans.
Social restrictions have placed
these persons in a peculiar position,
Kitagawa said, and the restrictions
have been accentuated ever since
the Manchurian incident.
Amid an insecurity which is not
that of being torn between two
flags, but is one of social and eco
nomic uncertainty for an unknown
length of time, is the development
of a concerted effort to fit into to
day's picture and to be accepted as
Americans in the national emer
gency, the student declared.

precarious state, Kitagawa outlined
the position of the Nisei as follows:
Japanese assets have been frozen
in this country. American assets
have been frozen in Japan.
On the Pacific Coast there are
100,000 American-born Japanese, a
number equal to the population to
the state of Nevada. How, Kita
gawa said, is the situation to affect
the Japanese in this country who
are American citizens and yet whose
parentage binds them closely to
Japan?
"Within this group of Japanese-
American citizens is the typical ar
bitrary stratification of any society,"
he added. "Yet there is a tendency
of fellow Americans to stamp them
as an unfortunate minority group,
forming a class within a class."
TIES WITH JAPAN
Continuing his outline of the
problem as it exists in the United
States Kitagawa declared that there
are sentimental ties with Japan
throughout this group, and that the
persons within it have accepted the
process of Americanization while
their racial characteristics have
made them conscious that they are,
after getting their college degrees,
not in the same categories as other
Americans.
Social restrictions have placed
these persons in a peculiar position,
Kitagawa said, and the restrictions
have been accentuated ever since
the Manchurian incident.
Amid an insecurity which is not
that of being torn between two
flags, but is one of social and eco
nomic uncertainty for an unknown
length of time, is the development
of a concerted effort to fit into to
day's picture and to be accepted as
Americans in the national emer
gency, the student declared.

Expressing the hope that the<
Nisei — American-born Japanese —
will not be the victims of a war
psychosis in the United States, Kay
Kitagawa, Stanford senior, declared
in an interview to The Daily that he
"knows for a fact that there is noth
ing to fear from those 100,000
Americans of Japanese parentage
today or in the future."
"Subjectively speaking," Kita
gawa said, "I think a break is due
to come for them from a sympa
thetic understanding of all Ameri
cans, regardless of class or society."
"It is my sincere hope—in spite of
the obvious war psychosis that is
unfortunately sweeping over the
country—that we will not be placed
in the same position as were Ger
man nationals and Americans with

names in the last World
War," he added.
