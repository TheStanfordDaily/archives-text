WHY
DON'T
YOU 7
By
Katy Blackmore
When you think of fall,
remember Mary Roy's,
The Shop with the Water
fall. New fall clothes are
there and more coming in
every day.
Co down and see the
fall showing of dresses.
You will find the answer
there to the question of
what to wear. There are
dresses for all occasions.
The profusion of fabrics
includes velveteen, cordu
roy, the new pinroy, wool,
and silk.
You'll find especially nice
A bright blue pinroy
dress with flared skirt
and three - quarter
length sleeves.
A three-piece wool suit,
tailored beautifully in
an eye-catching red.
P.S.â€”There are still some sum
mer clothes to be found at
amazingly low prices. Look at
the prints and plain color
dresses for $1.98 and you'll be
sorry if you don't take notice
of the hat buys .... $3.95
hats going for only $1.00.
