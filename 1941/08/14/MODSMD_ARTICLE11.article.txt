Professor Percy A. Martin recently
received the first flowers he has ever
gotten from a history class; they
were sent by the students enrolled
in his 10 o'clock History of South
America.
Yesterday afternoon the Palo Alto
Hospital reported Professor Mar
tin's condition as "unimproved."
The condition of Professor Ell â€”
wood P. Cubberley, dean of the
School of Education, emeritus, was
at the same time announced as "un
changed" by the secretary of the
department in the absence of Pro
fessor Cubberley's physician.
