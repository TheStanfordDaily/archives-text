# Actress Proves Shakespeare Applicable to Modern Europe
## 
### 
Illustrating the fact that much of'
Shakespeare can today be used as
timely propaganda for the English
cause, Irene Tedrow, dramatic art
ist who entertained the Tuesday
Evening Series audience, quoted
numerous subtle human and polit
ical observations of the great Eng
lish dramatist which closely re
semble modern newspaper head
lines.
"Many think that Shakespeare is
an intellectual luxury in this day
and age," said Miss Tedrow, "but we
find in Shakespeare the comfort of
the long view of human nature.
There is no one that so well under
stood the human heart."
Miss Tedrow, who appeared three
seasons with Maurice Evan's Com
pany in New York and on country
wide tours, was dressed in Eliza
bethan costume.
LUNCH-HOUR DRAMA
The people of London have or
ganized a "lunch hour" Shakespeare,
for the fear of air raids discontinues
night performances, explained Miss
Tedrow.
"Now is the winter of our discon
tent," cited from Shakespeare, still

â–ºbrings roars of laughter from a Lon
don audience.
"This England never did nor
never shall lie at the feet of a proud
conqueror" was a line spoken by
John of Guant that is today used to
inspire the English people.
Miss Tedrow presented some
scenes from "Richard II," "Twelfth
Night," "Coriolanus," and "Much
Ado About Nothing."
ROBINSON TO SPEAK
The final program in the Tuesday
Series for the summer quarter will
feature Karl Robinson lecturing on
"Defrosted Alaska" in Memorial
Hall August 19 at 8 p.m. Mr. Rob
inson will illustrate his lecture with
natural color motion pictures.
Mr. Robinson, who has penetrated
into Alaskan territory, where no
white man has been before, lived
there for months patiently filming
the wild game of the remote areas.
His accounts of our last frontier are
regarded by film experts as one of
the finest natural color motion pic
tures ever made in Alaska.
