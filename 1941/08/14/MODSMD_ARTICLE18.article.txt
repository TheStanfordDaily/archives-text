# Firemen Have Easy Summer
## 
### 
For the 13 students who protect
the campus community from fires,
summer quarter has been uneventful
this year, according to Stanford fire
men.
Aside from minor grass fires off
the campus, Stanford's big red fire
machines have had a vacation since
the opening of the quarter, students
said.
The 13 fire fighters are on duty
nights of alternate weeks during the
summer in return for sleeping ac
commodations upstairs in the fire
house. Some of the students receive
pay from the University for equip
ment maintenance and other work
about the firehouse during the day
time.
Although a full crew is not main
tained during the day time, many of
the firemen work next door in the
corporation yard and are subject to
call in case of fire.
