# The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS
## Farm Sports Outlook Rosy For 1941-42 Basketball, Tennis, Football, Golf Teams Titles Possibilities 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Although the school year 1940-41
was considered by many to be the
best in Stanford's history, athletically
speaking, it seems destined to be
overshadowed soon, in fact, the
coming year 1941-42.
The varsity football team that went
undefeated last year and was rated
among the best in the country will
be little less potent this year. Only
the familiarity to Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's famous T formation
and the loss of several freshman
stars due to the Atherton purge
keeps the coming team from being
the best in the Farm's annals.
ALL-AMERICAN RETURNING
These factors may be dispelled
due to the ingenuity of the Indian
grid coach and if several reserves
and unsung sophomores show up
well. Heading the list of stars is
All-American Frankie Albert.
Other returning first-stringers are
Pete Kmetovic, Fred Meyer, Bruno
Banducci, Chuck Taylor, Ed Stamm,
and Vic Lindskog.
Some observers called last year's
basketball outfit the smoothest court
of all time even though they did lose
the Pacific Coast Conference and
probably the N.C.A.A. titles due to
strange conditions and an unusually
tall Washington State team. How
ever, the 1942 aggregation should
easily surpass it in all-around
ability.
Fordy Anderson, Don Burness,
and Bill Cowden, all of whom made
the southern division all-star team
last year, are expected to return.
Combined with ex-frosh ace Jim
Pollard, tall reserve Ed Voss, and
transfers Howard Dallmar and Tom
Fuller, the Cards should be unstop
pable.
MANY TENNIS STARS
The tennis team which ranked
third in the country last year lost
only their No. 4 man and gains one
of the five best players in the na
tion, Ted Schroeder. Emery Neale,
first singles player last spring, Cap
tain Larry Dee, who was the colle
giate doubles champ in 1940 along
with Jimmy Wade, who is also re
turning, and Jack Gurley give the
Farm the best collection of net men
ever assembled in one school.
Led by Coach Eddie Twiggs and
Bud Brownell, one of the best col
legiate golfers extant, the '42 golf
team should at least equal the rec
ord of the '41 squad that won every
thing in sight and set myriad records
while doing it.
