# Defense Cited As Cause For Good Quarter

Stanford's history-making sum
mer quarter enrollment for 1941, 940
students as compared with 753 for
1940, may be explained by the un
usual steps which have been taken
in an effort to aid the nation's de
fense program. This angle on the
Farm's unique summer enrollment
increase (other western universities
noting marked decreases, as testified
by Dr. Stuartâ€”see page 1) is brought
out by a comparison of the enroll
ment by majors between 1940 and
1941 summer sessions.
This year's 197 increase over 1940
can perhaps be attributed to the
opening of the Engineering School
to 36 summer students, as well as
the operation of the Graduate School
of Business to the capacity usually
attained only during the regular
school year.
The Engineering School has not
been open during the summer quar
ter since the last World War, and it
is interesting to note that the pres
ent emergency and draft laws, to
which other schools have attributed
their decreased enrollment, is prob
ably responsible for Stanford's in
crease.
