# Stuart Terms Farm Summer Increase Novel
## 
### 
"I was very surprised when I re
turned to the Farm after my stay
in Utah and the neighboring states
to find that this year's summer ses
sion boasts the largest enrollment
in Stanford's history," said Graham
Stuart, professor of political science,
in an interview today.
Dr. Stuart, who has been teaching
at the University of Utah summer
session, noted that the enrollments
at the colleges in the other Western
states have shown an unusual de
crease this summer.
"Even at Greeley College," con
tinued the political science profes
sor, "whose student body is made
up principally of teachers and grad
uate students, this summer's en
rollment was unusually low." Dr.
Stuart gave a series of public ad
dresses at Greeley, Colorado, where
he was the guest of President Fra
sier of the university.
The explanation which these col
leges give to the increase in student
enrollment (only 550 are now regis
tered at Utah) includes two causes.
First, these middle-western univer
sities reason that the draft has taken
many potential students, and second,
that because there is an increase of
jobs available to both men and
women, many have forsaken sum
mer education for paying jobs.
Dr. Stuart said he met many
former Stanford students in the
course of his trip, the teaching part
of which he concluded at Boulder,
Colorado, where he gave an assembly
before approximately a thousand
people.
