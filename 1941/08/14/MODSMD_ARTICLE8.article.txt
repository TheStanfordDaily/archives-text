# Staff Will Edit Pre-Reg Daily
## 
### 
While the rest of the Farm slum
bers between summer and fall quar
ters, members of the regular Stan
ford Daily staff will return to the
campus on September 8 to edit the
annual pre-registration issue of The
Daily.
The issue is sent to all new stu
dents entering the university so that
they receive it about a week before
leaving home. An extra large issue,
it contains news and programs of
the pre-registration and registration
activities, as well as general campus
news of interest to incoming fresh
men.
To compensate for a shortened
vacation and with no scholastic wor
ries, the staff is guaranteed a good
time as well as work by Charles
Bull, editor for Volume 100 of The
Daily.
