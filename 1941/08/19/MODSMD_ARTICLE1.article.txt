# Alaskan Movie Will Conclude Tuesday Series
## Traveler to Debunk False Icebox Theory With Colored Film 
### 
An all-color motion picture en
titled, "Defrosting Alaska" presented
by Karl Robinson will conclude the
Tuesday Evening Series for the
summer quarter tonight at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Hall.
Mr. Robinson's lecture is designed
to give a better understanding of
Alaska. For many years following
its purchase from Russia, Alaska
was referred to as "Seward's Ice
box."
INACCURATE APPRAISAL
"Defrosting Alaska" ends this in
accurate appraisal, and reveals the
region as an important part of the
nation, according to Mr. Robinson.
As a large land mass containing vast
natural resources, Alaska is the
Scandinavia of the North America
Continent, and is the object of many
international implications.
This program on strategic Alaska,
where plans for national defense are
concentrating, will feature in pic
tures the mighty glaciers, intimate
studies of wild animals, the last of
the Indian potlatches, the salmon
run, fish economy, sourdoughs,
flowers and huskies all against a
background of the unsurpassed
beauty and charm of Alaska.
TRAVELLED MUCH
Mr. Robinson has made many
trips to Alaska and has traveled over
much of the ground where the
Canadian road will probably be con
structed.
Previous to his trips to Alaska,
Mr. Robinson spent nine years in
the Far East, where he distributed
"oil for the lamps of China." He
traveled far into the interior of
China and gained an intimate knowl
edge of that country and its people.
The series for the fall quarter
will be resumed on October 7.
