# Calhoun to Speak On Cretan War
## 
### 
"The Cretan Campaign of 1184
8.C." will be the subject of the lec
ture to be given by Professor
George M. Calhoun Wednesday af
ternoon at 4:15 in the Lower Lounge
of the Women's Clubhouse.
In speaking of his lecture Pro
fessor Calhoun, who is visiting pro
fessor of classics, said, "Ancient ac
counts of a period of upheaval and
armed conflict take on a new inter
est in times like these."
According to Professor Calhoun
tanks are bigger and faster than the
Homeric chariot; they make more
noise and kill more people. The
Trojan horse has become the fifth
column, and Pegasus now develops
several thousand horsepower, flies
500 miles per hours, and mounts a
battery of cannon.
