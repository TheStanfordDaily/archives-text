# Freshman Women Fall Quota Filled
## 
### 
"The way it looks now, no fresh
man women at summer school will
be admitted to the autumn quar
ter," it was announced last night by
Miss Anastasia Doyle, director of
residence.
The 20 places now available will
be filled by junior transfers, and if
there is any remaining room, by
sophomore transfers. Although these
facts are not as yet final, Miss
Doyle stated that since 25 freshmen
are already admitted who will not
be able to live in Roble during their
first quarter, it is not deemed advis
able to allow for the enrollment of
more freshmen women in autumn.
All summer quarter freshmen
women who make a C average or
more, however, were promised en
trance for the winter quarter by
Miss Doyle.
