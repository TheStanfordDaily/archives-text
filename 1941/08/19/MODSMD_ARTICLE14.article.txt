# Farm Drinkers Go for Cokes
## Cellar Dishes It Out, Stanfordites Take It 
### 
"Fresh lime coke, please," seems
to be the most well-worn phrase of
the season at the Cellar this sum
mer, according to Claude Strauss,
night manager.
Out of the 750 which are sold daily
at the Cellar, the majority are lime
or plain cokes. Lemon and choco
late flavoring, however, run a close
second in the opinion of Stanford
summer students.
Second-ranking beverage of Stan
fordites is coffee, yes, Union coffee,
of which about 600 cups a day are
served. Approximately 75 milk
shakes, the majority of which are
chocolate flavored, are ordered daily.
These figures would make it appear
that Stanford students are great
drinkers (of soft drinks), but these
calculations only cover the summer
quarter when business at the Cellar
is proportionately lower.
HAMBURGERS POPULAR
It may be consoling to note that
the Farm is truly American in fol
lowing the U.S. custom of hamburg
er-eating. This is verified by the
fact that along with 'burgers, grilled
cheese and bacon and tomato are
the most popular sandwiches.
The Cellar does more than feed
hungry Farm students, it also pro
vides employment for about 17 stu
dents who work on an average of
two hours a day. There are alto
gether 53 employees, including Miss
Virginia Atkinson, manager, and
Claude Strauss, night manager.
The "juke-box" which provides a
part of the unique "charm" of the
Cellar is re-enforced with records
once a week. The more popular ones
are left, however, as long as the
customers pay to hear them. After
one or more trips to the Union it
would not be hard to discover htat
"Daddy" and Freddy Martin's "Con
certo" are Stanford's most-played
tunes.
MEETING PLACE
All-year-round meeting place of
and professors alike, the
Cellar is possibly even more popu
lar in the summer, in proportion to
the enrollment. But the varied stu
dent body in the summer season
does not change the demands very
much, because, according to Strauss,
"A lot of the grads and professors
attending summer school have grad
uated from Stanford and don't find
it hard to catch onto the same old
likes and dislikes of the regular
students."
