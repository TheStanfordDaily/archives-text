# 'Equinox' Gets 3 Curtain Calls
## 
### AUDREY KRAUSE 
Every seat was taken. People
were sitting in the aisles. Extra
chairs were placed everywhere but
up on the stage. Those without res
ervations had to be turned away at
the door.
"The Levite," winner of the 1941
Maxwell Anderson Award for verse
drama, and "Equinox," runner-up,
were being presented for the first
time Saturday night in the Little
Theater of Memorial Hall.
"Equinox," which should have
won the competition, is the story of
Olaf Langredsen, a workman in a
plough factory, who returns from
war to find the gates of the factory
closed, his employer in an asylum
for the insane because he could not
understand the manufacture of guns,
and three other workmen and their
wives awaiting death at the hands of
a fourth laborer who was to turn on
the gas jet in the rat-infested base
ment in which they were living.
CLOSED GATES NOT LOCKED
Langredsen asks to be permitted to
enter the plough factory, but the
guard refuses his request; so he tries
the gate and finds that simply be
cause it is closed does not mean that
it is locked. Langredsen becomes a
prisoner in the guard house, and
later the other women and their
wives enter the factory, braving the
fire of the guard's rifle.
The author said: "It seems to me
that we're living in a time when the
forces of light and darkness are des
perately fighting for superiority in a
very terrifying way."
Ignoring the author's interpreta
tion, many of the audience, specu
lating on the deeper significance of
the play, felt that it was pro-isola
tionism, pro-labor, pro-capital, pro
communism, pro-etc.
ORCHIDS TO CAST, STAFF
The actors did a splendid job, es
pecially considering the difficulties
which the production of verse drama
presents. The staff deserve special
mention because of the particular
importance of the direction, light
ing, sets, and background music in
"Equinox."
"The Levite," following such a
powerful drama as the first of the
evening's two performances, had
two strikes against it when the actors
came up to bat. A weak melodra
matic plot made the third, and de
sipte good acting, "The Levite"
struck out.
Agnes Smith's one-aot play con
sists of a series of tragedies which
get progressively worse. The loss of
both leading characters in the creek
brought down the final curtain with
the audience expecting something
more but awfully relieved that there
wasn't.

the gate and finds that simply be
cause it is closed does not mean that
it is locked. Langredsen becomes a
prisoner in the guard house, and
later the other women and their
wives enter the factory, braving the
fire of the guard's rifle.
The author said: "It seems to me
that we're living in a time when the
forces of light and darkness are des
perately fighting for superiority in a
very terrifying way."
Ignoring the author's interpreta
tion, many of the audience, specu
lating on the deeper significance of
the play, felt that it was pro-isola
tionism, pro-labor, pro-capital, pro
communism, pro-etc.
ORCHIDS TO CAST, STAFF
The actors did a splendid job, es
pecially considering the difficulties
which the production of verse drama
presents. The staff deserve special
mention because of the particular
importance of the direction, light
ing, sets, and background music in
"Equinox."
"The Levite," following such a
powerful drama as the first of the
evening's two performances, had
two strikes against it when the actors
came up to bat. A weak melodra
matic plot made the third, and de
sipte good acting, "The Levite"
struck out.
Agnes Smith's one-aot play con
sists of a series of tragedies which
get progressively worse. The loss of
both leading characters in the creek
brought down the final curtain with
the audience expecting something
more but awfully relieved that there
wasn't.
Every seat was taken. People
were sitting in the aisles. Extra
chairs were placed everywhere but
up on the stage. Those without res
ervations had to be turned away at
the door.
"The Levite," winner of the 1941
Maxwell Anderson Award for verse
drama, and "Equinox," runner-up,
were being presented for the first
time Saturday night in the Little
Theater of Memorial Hall.
"Equinox," which should have
won the competition, is the story of
Olaf Langredsen, a workman in a
plough factory, who returns from
war to find the gates of the factory
closed, his employer in an asylum
for the insane because he could not
understand the manufacture of guns,
and three other workmen and their
wives awaiting death at the hands of
a fourth laborer who was to turn on
the gas jet in the rat-infested base
ment in which they were living.
CLOSED GATES NOT LOCKED
Langredsen asks to be permitted to
enter the plough factory, but the
guard refuses his request; so he tries
the gate and finds that simply be
cause it is closed does not mean that
it is locked. Langredsen becomes a
prisoner in the guard house, and
later the other women and their
wives enter the factory, braving the
fire of the guard's rifle.
