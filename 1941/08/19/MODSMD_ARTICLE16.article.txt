# Antioch's Democratic Plan Explained by Student Group
## 
### 
A college where students and fac
ulty combine as a single group to
solve the problems of the campus.
A college where the students devote
ten weeks at study and ten weeks at
work on a job in a chosen profes
sion alternately in working for their
bachelor of arts and bachelor of sci
ence degree.
Such is Antioch College, Yellow
Springs, Ohio, which is represented
on the campus this week by five
students who are touring the West
explaining their plan of student
government and the college in gen
eral.
The five students who are guests
of Professor Emeritus Bailey Willis
are Robert Levin, Jack Lytle, Bob
Bartlett, Junius Eddy and Warren
Hamilton.
"The most important phase of the
college program is the community
government," Levin explained in an
interview Saturday. "The college is
a single community, in which stu
dents and faculty share alike.
A council of nine members, which
is in charge of the community gov
ernment, is elected by and of the
students and faculty. A manage
ment is appointed by the council.
Twenty committees which cover all
campus activities function under
the council. The plan much resem
bles the city-manager type of gov
ernment.
This is an experiment in practical
democracy, of which some of the
methods and activities may be ap
plicable to situations and groups
other than those on the college
campus."
