## Schroeder Wins, Loses Finals Of Newport Casino Tourney 
### 
Stanford's first ranking netman,
Ted Schroeder, opened his defense
of the national doubles title today
with his partner, Jack Kramer, at
Brookline, Mass., last week, after
having advanced all the way to the
finals in both singles and doubles at
the Newport Casino tourney, annex
ing the tandem match but losing the
singles final to national champion
Don McNeil, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.
Schroeder and Kramer defeated
McNeil and Frank Parker, 4-6, 6-4,
8-6, 6-1, in the doubles final, after
having won from the Hall-Bobbitt
combination in the semi-finals.
Parker, ranked fifth nationally, fell
before the Card flash in the singles
semi-finals, 6-4, 8-10, 6-4, 6-4.
Little difficulty is expected in the
young Californian's quest for their
second consecutive doubles crown
since the second seeded team of Mc-
Neil and Parker has succumbed to
them innumerous times this year.
McNeil in defeating Schroeder in
the Newport final won his first tour
nament since taking the national
title at Forest Hills almost a year
ago.
Ranked only tenth nationally last
year, Schroeder's sterling play
through the summer should bring
him into the first five for the 1942
rankings.
