# Farm Residents Write 7,000 Letters Each Day

### 
If you feel neglected by the folksi
at home and climb the post office
steps day after day hoping that
someone has remembered you, don't
despair.
Stanford post office records show
that you aren't the only one. While
some 7,000 letters are mailed by
Stanford students each day, only
about 5,000 arrive at the post office
for distribution to boxes and general
delivery.
The heaviest work for the post of
fice employees comes at the begin
ning of each quarter, especially fall
quarter, and at the end of spring
quarter when approximately 3,800
forwarding addresses must be
handled.
When school opens in the fall, as
many as six substitutes are added to
the staff of seven clerks and two car

â–ºriers to handle the tremendous
amount of parcel post as well as first
class mail.
According to J. J. Callahan, post
office superintendent, week-ends
seem to be the most popular letter
writing time, as Mondays are the
busiest days.
Mail arrives at the post office from
all points, north, east, and south
seven times a day on week days and
four times a day on Sundays and
holidays. Departures follow ap
proximately the same schedule, the
times ranging from 4:30 a.m. to 7
p.m. Distribution to boxes and gen
eral delivery is completed about one
hour after the mail arrives.
Stanford University's post office
was built in 1900. Before that time
there was no post office on the
campus.
