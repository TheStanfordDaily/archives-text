A POWERFUL INSTRUMENT
OF DIAGNOSIS AND HEALING
vThe German physicist, Wilhelm Konrad Rontgen, produced
3 the first X-rays within a special vacuum tube. The rays
emanating from this tube possessed the quality of penetrating
i wood, flesh and other opaque substances, leaving a shadow
graph upon a photographic plate. Since that time the X-Ray
apparatus has been perfected by a number of scientists to a
high degree of efficiency. As a therapeutic agent and diag
nostic Instrument it is an Indispensable part of modern medi
cal practice.
| (Where the trouble is deep-seated X-Ray treatment after sur
gery often is utilized to prevent recurrence. The X-Ray spe
cialist is meeting with success in treatment of cancer, seme
skin diseases, tumors, goiter, enlarged thymus glands, Ilodg
l kins disease (a disease of the lymphatic system), Lenkenua (a
.disease of the bone marrow), some types of tuberculosis in
fections and sinus infections.
With the fluoroscopic screen of the X-Ray the physician can
watch the stomach and other organs in action. Through
X-Ray. pictures and the fluoroscope he can locate foreign
bodies, get a true picture of fracture conditions, and in count
\ less other ways simplify medical diagnosis and surgical pro
cedure.
i A new use for the X-Ray fluoroscopic screen is the searching
of criminals and their visitors for hidden saws, files, knives
and weapons. Penitentiaries, jails and custom houses so
| equipped, stand the individual before the screen and any
metal object will show on the screen.
