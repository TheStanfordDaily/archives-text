COTTRELL ON PANEL
Yesterday Prof. Edwin A. Cot
trell, chairman of the School of
Social Sciences, Frank P. Foisie,
president of the Waterfront Employ
ers Association of the Pacific Coast
and K. C. Ingram, publicist and ad
vertising executive in San Francisco,
joined the four daily speakers in
panel discussions of labor and gov
ernment public relations.
Declaring that government in the
United States has "always given a
variety of assistances to the business
community," Dr. Dimock told Tues
day afternoon's meeting that busi
nessmen have been responsible for
the government's part in business
more than any other group or
factor.
RELY ON GOVERNMENT
"All businesses must rely today
upon government's liberal corpora
tion laws, liberal patent laws and
tariffs as outstanding public assist
ances," Dr. Dimock said.
A middle ground between govern
ment planning and indiscriminate
giving is necessary as a balance to
prevent the "devil take the hind
most" attitude on the one hand and
totalitarianism on the other, he as
serted.
"Planning isn't even theoretically
possible, if you want to retain old
standards," Dr. Dimock continued,
and advocated attention to the fol
lowing factors if a solution to the
middle ground question is to be
found:
More self-government, self-re
straint and self-abstinence should be
practiced by industry.
Greater tolerance is needed be
tween industry, labor, and business
if pressure groups are not to "run
wild."
Adjustments are needed in the
system of government so that re
sponsibility will be better placed.
Mr. Lovejoy, discussing six im
portant factors in public relations,
told the audience of businessmen
that the public has a right to know
the truth about industry.
"An industry must 'buy for'
rather than 'sell to' the public," Mr.
Lovejoy said, and listed a necessary
consideration of the public as an in
vestor; the relationship with the
government; of employee with em
ployer; with the community, and
with competitors.

COTTRELL ON PANEL
Yesterday Prof. Edwin A. Cot
trell, chairman of the School of
Social Sciences, Frank P. Foisie,
president of the Waterfront Employ
ers Association of the Pacific Coast
and K. C. Ingram, publicist and ad
vertising executive in San Francisco,
joined the four daily speakers in
panel discussions of labor and gov
ernment public relations.
Declaring that government in the
United States has "always given a
variety of assistances to the business
community," Dr. Dimock told Tues
day afternoon's meeting that busi
nessmen have been responsible for
the government's part in business
more than any other group or
factor.
RELY ON GOVERNMENT
"All businesses must rely today
upon government's liberal corpora
tion laws, liberal patent laws and
tariffs as outstanding public assist
ances," Dr. Dimock said.
A middle ground between govern
ment planning and indiscriminate
giving is necessary as a balance to
prevent the "devil take the hind
most" attitude on the one hand and
totalitarianism on the other, he as
serted.
"Planning isn't even theoretically
possible, if you want to retain old
standards," Dr. Dimock continued,
and advocated attention to the fol
lowing factors if a solution to the
middle ground question is to be
found:
More self-government, self-re
straint and self-abstinence should be
practiced by industry.
Greater tolerance is needed be
tween industry, labor, and business
if pressure groups are not to "run
wild."
