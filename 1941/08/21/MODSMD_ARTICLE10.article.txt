# Varied Summer Conferences Have Far-Reaching Results
## 
### 
The 45 colleges and universities'
which have already accepted invita
tions to attend "a conference of
western schools to acquaint Selec
tive Service officials with the spe
cialized training needed for some of
the various branches of national
defense" bears witness to the suc
cess of the Pacific Regional Confer
ence on Higher Education held here
in June.
The conference also decided to
form a committee of educators to
select undergraduates and graduate
scientists and engineers for contin
ued study in their fields as an aid to
national defense.
MANY CONFERENCES
But this conference was only one
among the many important confer
ences held at Stanford this summer.
Among these other conferences is
the physiotherapy conference which
was held here in July. One of the
highlights of this conference was the
first public description of Miss
Elizabeth Kenny's new treatment
for infantile paralysis which Miss
Kenny, an Australian bush nurse,
has been introducing into the United
States during the past year.
Late in June the Protein Re
search Conference was held, at
which experiments were presented
which modify to some considerable
extent the classical theory of ani
mal metabolism. These experiments,
with others, add support to the mod
ern theory that the human body is
in the continuous process of break
ing down and repairing tissues all
through life.
Another feature of the summer

â–ºconference series was the Taxation
Conference held early in July, when
Arthur H. Kent, assistant general
counsel of the Treasury Department,
charged the House Ways and Means
Committee with "political timidity"
in their proposals for the 1941 Reve
nue Bill, stating that in its present
state it was totally inadequate in
the light of the present national
emergency. Among many note
worthy talks and papers heard at
the conference was the one of Jo
seph D. Peeler, who spoke on prop
erty valuation for death and gift
taxes, a subject that no law school
gives.
The fifth annual Business Confer
ence which convened July 21 with
the theme of "American Business in
a World at War." Heard, among
others, Professor S. H. Slichter of
the School of Business who spoke
on "Labor Problems under Defense-
Labor Supply and Wages."
EDUCATORS CONVENE HERE
The four-day educators' Confer
ence opened on July 17 with Dean
G. N. Kefauver of the School of
Education presiding over the first
panel. Dr. Wilbur was chairman of
the session on the resources out of
which desired long-term objectives
may be achieved.
One of the other highlights of this
varied summer conference program
was the Dramatists' Alliance As
sembly, which is discusbed in Dr.
Mears' report on page 1.
