# Farm Gridders Face Trouble In Bowl Drive
## Trojans, Huskies, Bears Add Worries In Coast Conference 
### 
Usually the defending Rose Bowl
champions, with seven first stringers
returning and bolstered by an unde
feated frosh team, would be rated
in the pre-season dope as one of the
nation's outstanding aggregations.
The 1941 Stanford footballers are no
exception.
However, even in their own baili
wick, the Pacific Coast Conference,
the Indians are no cinch to annex
the crown, due not to their decline
but to the bright prospects of sev
eral of their rivals, namely South
ern California, California, Wash
ington, not to mention the non-con
ference Santa Clara Broncos.
Beyond the Rockies as possible op
ponents for the Card grid machine
in the '41 Bowl class, if all goes well
on the local front during the next
three months, Fordham, Minnesota,
Texas, and Duke loom up as the
pigskin giants in their sections of the
country.
MORE THREATS
Close behind these leaders come
Nebraska, vanquished foes of the
Indians in the 1941 Pasadena bowl
game, a southern trio of Tennessee,
Alabama, and Mississippi, and
Southern Methodist, Pennsylvania,
Cornell, Oklahoma, Notre Dame, plus
the creem of the Pacific slopes crop.
Although the Big Nine and Ivy
League teams still have a ban on
post-season bowl games, the opposi
tion is weakening and an agreement
may be reached in time for the 1942
game. In the south local interests
are trying to keep the schools in
their section from coming to the
Coast in an effort to build up such
games as the Sugar, Orange, Cotton,
and Sun Bowls.
GOOD OPPONENTS
In spite of these sectional preju
diced little trouble will be had in
finding a worthy opponent for Stan
ford's warriors, assuming that they
have the privilege of looking for an
opponent. Their way is blocked not
only by nine teams on their schedule,
but by the order in which they come.
No despite is given the Farm team
unitl November 22, before which
time they meet eight of their op
ponents in eight successive week
ends with the Huskies, Broncs, and
Trojans coming within 15 days.
Since Frankie Albert is one of the
few returning All - Americans
throughout college football it is safe
to assume that he has an edge on
the coming selections. He will not be
Stanford's only starring material
since Pete Kmetovic, scooting half
back, Vic Lindskog, center, Chuck
Taylor, guard, and Bruno Banducci,
tackle, have the ability to give the
pressmen reams of copy.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy will
soon return to the campus to start
teaching his boys plays with which
he hopes to keep his opposition as
befuddled as they were last year
when the Cards went through ten
undefeated games.

tion is weakening and an agreement
may be reached in time for the 1942
game. In the south local interests
are trying to keep the schools in
their section from coming to the
Coast in an effort to build up such
games as the Sugar, Orange, Cotton,
and Sun Bowls.
GOOD OPPONENTS
In spite of these sectional preju
diced little trouble will be had in
finding a worthy opponent for Stan
ford's warriors, assuming that they
have the privilege of looking for an
opponent. Their way is blocked not
only by nine teams on their schedule,
but by the order in which they come.
No despite is given the Farm team
unitl November 22, before which
time they meet eight of their op
ponents in eight successive week
ends with the Huskies, Broncs, and
Trojans coming within 15 days.
Since Frankie Albert is one of the
few returning All - Americans
throughout college football it is safe
to assume that he has an edge on
the coming selections. He will not be
Stanford's only starring material
since Pete Kmetovic, scooting half
back, Vic Lindskog, center, Chuck
Taylor, guard, and Bruno Banducci,
tackle, have the ability to give the
pressmen reams of copy.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy will
soon return to the campus to start
teaching his boys plays with which
he hopes to keep his opposition as
befuddled as they were last year
when the Cards went through ten
undefeated games.
Usually the defending Rose Bowl
champions, with seven first stringers
returning and bolstered by an unde
feated frosh team, would be rated
in the pre-season dope as one of the
nation's outstanding aggregations.
The 1941 Stanford footballers are no
exception.
However, even in their own baili
wick, the Pacific Coast Conference,
the Indians are no cinch to annex
the crown, due not to their decline
but to the bright prospects of sev
eral of their rivals, namely South
ern California, California, Wash
ington, not to mention the non-con
ference Santa Clara Broncos.
Beyond the Rockies as possible op
ponents for the Card grid machine
in the '41 Bowl class, if all goes well
on the local front during the next
three months, Fordham, Minnesota,
Texas, and Duke loom up as the
pigskin giants in their sections of the
country.
MORE THREATS
Close behind these leaders come
Nebraska, vanquished foes of the
Indians in the 1941 Pasadena bowl
game, a southern trio of Tennessee,
Alabama, and Mississippi, and
Southern Methodist, Pennsylvania,
Cornell, Oklahoma, Notre Dame, plus
the creem of the Pacific slopes crop.
Although the Big Nine and Ivy
League teams still have a ban on
post-season bowl games, the opposi
tion is weakening and an agreement
may be reached in time for the 1942
game. In the south local interests
