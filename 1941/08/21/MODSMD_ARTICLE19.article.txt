# Ex-Farm Teeman Leads at Chicago
## 
### 
While such outstanding amateur
golfers as Bud Ward, ex-national
champ, and Ray Billows, New York
champ, were struggling to keep
within striking distance of par, Jack
Hoerner of Chicago, former Stan
ford ace, shot a 68, four under par,
to lead the qualifying round for the
Great Lakes amateur championships
at Chicago.
Down the list of qualifyers at par
72 was Art Doering, another ex-In
dian teeman, who is one of the fa
vorites to take the match play title.
Hoerner and Doering will be
joined by Bud Brownell, who is of
a more recent vintage, in the Na
tional Amateur at Omaha next
week.
