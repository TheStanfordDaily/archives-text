# Mears Notes Seriousness Of 1941 Summer Quarter
## 
### DR. ELIOT G. MEARS Director of the Summer Quarter 
The outstanding feature this sum
mer is the greater seriousness evi
dent in every aspect of university
life. The summer quarter has al
ways been a period of greater aca
demic interests than is true of the
rest of the year, largely to be ac
counted for by the relative absence
of organized sport and extracurricu
lar activities. This year this aspect
is more evident than usual.
One reason is the noteworthy ac
tion of the Graduate School of Busi
ness and the School of Engineering
in embarking upon a scholastic
program designed to hasten the
training for national defense. The
number of entering students is grat
ifying. Then, too, the School of Nurs
es has just become a degree-granting
institution, so these 85 women bring
this total addition to approximately
135 students. Moreover, the general
registration was more than main
tained, with the result that the quar
ter's enrollment gained 17 per cent,
or over 10 per cent on a comparable
basis with last year's summer ses
sion.
The number of graduate students
is approximately 40 larger, but the
great increase has come about in
the increase of 115 in the Upper Di
vision and the 60 in the Lower Divi
sion. Statistics compiled at the end
of July recorded 597 men and 422
women.
SOCIAL PROGRAM
The social program has been ex
panded greatly this summer on ac
count of the greater number of un
dergraduate men and women. Fre
quent jolly-ups, a swimming trip, a
roller-skating party, and a faculty
student University Day with sports,
picnic supper, and a barn dance
have been features. I look forward
to an augmentation in these inde
pendent activities in the 1942 sum
mer quarter.
The students have been conspicu
ous in being present at the Brahms
concerts, lecture series, and the
Tuesday Evening Programs. The
record-breaking attendance at the
Brahms Concerts (over 6,000 and the
Tuesday Evening Series over 7,000)
can be attributed in part to the
greater student participation than
the rest of the year,
The Wednesday Afternoon Lec
ture Series by visiting professors


DR. ELIOT G. MEARS
was a noteworthy contribution to
our summer program.
The cycle of eight concerts of the
chamber music of Johannes Brahms
was the gift of the Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge Foundation in the Library
of Congress the Brahms quartet
this summer was composed of An
tonio Brosa and Laurent Halleux,
violins; Germain Prevost, viola; C.
Warwick Evans, violoncello; and
Gunnar Johansen, piano. They
were assisted by Rudloph Schmidt;
clarinet, Ferenc Molnar, viola; Wil
helm Dehe, 'cello and Alfred Brain,
horn.
No review of the quarter would be
adequate without mention of the
many excellent conferences held
during the summer. Frequently two
conferences were being held simul
taneously on this campus. These
scholarly meetings were stimulated
by this Fiftieth Anniversary year,
following the extremely notable
symposium on "The University and
the Future of America," which was
held in the week between the spring
and summer quarter. Another no
table ceremony, that of the dedica
tion of the Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace, also pro
vided an excellent setting for our
summer here. We are looking for
ward to a renewal of commemora
tive activities on October 1 to 5.
One of the highlights of the sum
mer was the program of the Drama
tists' Alliance Assembly. In the na
tionwide Etherege Award for prose
comedy competition, "Cardinal Vir
tue," by Carter Kissell, took first
honors. "The Levite," written by
Agnes Smith, won the Maxwell' An
derson Award for 1941. Both were
presented in readings by the Alli
ance. The Gray Award for Dra
matic Criticism was won by Sherna
Vinograd, who has done graduate
work at Stanford.
As the quarter draws to a close, it
is pleasant to hear from so many
members of the community that this
period has been one of pleasure and
distinct satisfaction.
The utilization of the University
physical and human resources is de
cidedly worth while. To this end we
have enjoyed the presence of an un
usually distinguished visiting fac
ulty. Newcomers to the Farm, fac
ulty, students, and friends have
been a welcome addition to our
community.

ter's enrollment gained 17 per cent,
or over 10 per cent on a comparable
basis with last year's summer ses
sion.
The number of graduate students
is approximately 40 larger, but the
great increase has come about in
the increase of 115 in the Upper Di
vision and the 60 in the Lower Divi
sion. Statistics compiled at the end
of July recorded 597 men and 422
women.
SOCIAL PROGRAM
The social program has been ex
panded greatly this summer on ac
count of the greater number of un
dergraduate men and women. Fre
quent jolly-ups, a swimming trip, a
roller-skating party, and a faculty
student University Day with sports,
picnic supper, and a barn dance
have been features. I look forward
to an augmentation in these inde
pendent activities in the 1942 sum
mer quarter.
The students have been conspicu
ous in being present at the Brahms
concerts, lecture series, and the
Tuesday Evening Programs. The
record-breaking attendance at the
Brahms Concerts (over 6,000 and the
Tuesday Evening Series over 7,000)
can be attributed in part to the
greater student participation than
the rest of the year,

was a noteworthy contribution to
our summer program.
The cycle of eight concerts of the
chamber music of Johannes Brahms
was the gift of the Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge Foundation in the Library
of Congress the Brahms quartet
this summer was composed of An
tonio Brosa and Laurent Halleux,
violins; Germain Prevost, viola; C.
Warwick Evans, violoncello; and
Gunnar Johansen, piano. They
were assisted by Rudloph Schmidt;
clarinet, Ferenc Molnar, viola; Wil
helm Dehe, 'cello and Alfred Brain,
horn.
No review of the quarter would be
adequate without mention of the
many excellent conferences held
during the summer. Frequently two
conferences were being held simul
taneously on this campus. These
scholarly meetings were stimulated
by this Fiftieth Anniversary year,
following the extremely notable
symposium on "The University and
the Future of America," which was
held in the week between the spring
and summer quarter. Another no
table ceremony, that of the dedica
tion of the Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace, also pro
vided an excellent setting for our
summer here. We are looking for
ward to a renewal of commemora
tive activities on October 1 to 5.
One of the highlights of the sum
mer was the program of the Drama
tists' Alliance Assembly. In the na
tionwide Etherege Award for prose
comedy competition, "Cardinal Vir
tue," by Carter Kissell, took first
honors. "The Levite," written by
Agnes Smith, won the Maxwell' An
derson Award for 1941. Both were
presented in readings by the Alli
ance. The Gray Award for Dra
matic Criticism was won by Sherna
Vinograd, who has done graduate
work at Stanford.
As the quarter draws to a close, it
is pleasant to hear from so many
members of the community that this
period has been one of pleasure and
distinct satisfaction.
The utilization of the University
physical and human resources is de
cidedly worth while. To this end we
have enjoyed the presence of an un
usually distinguished visiting fac
ulty. Newcomers to the Farm, fac
ulty, students, and friends have
been a welcome addition to our
community.
The outstanding feature this sum
mer is the greater seriousness evi
dent in every aspect of university
life. The summer quarter has al
ways been a period of greater aca
demic interests than is true of the
rest of the year, largely to be ac
counted for by the relative absence
of organized sport and extracurricu
lar activities. This year this aspect
is more evident than usual.
One reason is the noteworthy ac
tion of the Graduate School of Busi
ness and the School of Engineering
in embarking upon a scholastic
program designed to hasten the
training for national defense. The
number of entering students is grat
ifying. Then, too, the School of Nurs
es has just become a degree-granting
institution, so these 85 women bring
this total addition to approximately
135 students. Moreover, the general
registration was more than main

concerts, lecture series, and the

record-breaking attendance at the

was a noteworthy contribution to
our summer program.
The cycle of eight concerts of the
chamber music of Johannes Brahms
was the gift of the Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge Foundation in the Library
of Congress the Brahms quartet
this summer was composed of An
tonio Brosa and Laurent Halleux,
violins; Germain Prevost, viola; C.
Warwick Evans, violoncello; and
Gunnar Johansen, piano. They
were assisted by Rudloph Schmidt;
clarinet, Ferenc Molnar, viola; Wil
helm Dehe, 'cello and Alfred Brain,
horn.
No review of the quarter would be
adequate without mention of the
many excellent conferences held
during the summer. Frequently two
conferences were being held simul
taneously on this campus. These
scholarly meetings were stimulated
by this Fiftieth Anniversary year,
following the extremely notable
symposium on "The University and
the Future of America," which was
held in the week between the spring
and summer quarter. Another no
table ceremony, that of the dedica
tion of the Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace, also pro
vided an excellent setting for our
summer here. We are looking for
ward to a renewal of commemora
tive activities on October 1 to 5.
One of the highlights of the sum
mer was the program of the Drama
tists' Alliance Assembly. In the na
tionwide Etherege Award for prose
comedy competition, "Cardinal Vir
tue," by Carter Kissell, took first
honors. "The Levite," written by
Agnes Smith, won the Maxwell' An
derson Award for 1941. Both were
presented in readings by the Alli
ance. The Gray Award for Dra
matic Criticism was won by Sherna
Vinograd, who has done graduate
work at Stanford.
As the quarter draws to a close, it
is pleasant to hear from so many
members of the community that this
period has been one of pleasure and
distinct satisfaction.
The utilization of the University
physical and human resources is de
cidedly worth while. To this end we
have enjoyed the presence of an un
usually distinguished visiting fac
ulty. Newcomers to the Farm, fac
ulty, students, and friends have
been a welcome addition to our
community.
The outstanding feature this sum
mer is the greater seriousness evi
dent in every aspect of university
life. The summer quarter has al
ways been a period of greater aca
demic interests than is true of the
rest of the year, largely to be ac
counted for by the relative absence
of organized sport and extracurricu
lar activities. This year this aspect
is more evident than usual.
One reason is the noteworthy ac
tion of the Graduate School of Busi
ness and the School of Engineering
in embarking upon a scholastic
program designed to hasten the
training for national defense. The
number of entering students is grat
ifying. Then, too, the School of Nurs
es has just become a degree-granting
institution, so these 85 women bring
this total addition to approximately
135 students. Moreover, the general
registration was more than main
tained, with the result that the quar
ter's enrollment gained 17 per cent,
or over 10 per cent on a comparable
basis with last year's summer ses
sion.
The number of graduate students
is approximately 40 larger, but the
great increase has come about in
the increase of 115 in the Upper Di
vision and the 60 in the Lower Divi
sion. Statistics compiled at the end
of July recorded 597 men and 422
women.
SOCIAL PROGRAM
The social program has been ex
panded greatly this summer on ac
count of the greater number of un
dergraduate men and women. Fre
quent jolly-ups, a swimming trip, a
roller-skating party, and a faculty
student University Day with sports,
picnic supper, and a barn dance
have been features. I look forward
to an augmentation in these inde
pendent activities in the 1942 sum
mer quarter.
