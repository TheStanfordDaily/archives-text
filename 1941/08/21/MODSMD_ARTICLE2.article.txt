# Mears Notes Seriousness Of 1941 Summer Quarter
## 
### DR. ELIOT G. MEARS Director of the Summer Quarter 
The outstanding feature this sum
mer is the greater seriousness evi
dent in every aspect of university
life. The summer quarter has al
ways been a period of greater aca
demic interests than is true of the
rest of the year, largely to be ac
counted for by the relative absence
of organized sport and extracurricu
lar activities. This year this aspect
is more evident than usual.
One reason is the noteworthy ac
tion of the Graduate School of Busi
ness and the School of Engineering
in embarking upon a scholastic
program designed to hasten the
training for national defense. The
number of entering students is grat
ifying. Then, too, the School of Nurs
es has just become a degree-granting
institution, so these 85 women bring
this total addition to approximately
135 students. Moreover, the general
registration was more than main
tained, with the result that the quar
ter's enrollment gained 17 per cent,
or over 10 per cent on a comparable
basis with last year's summer ses
sion.
The number of graduate students
is approximately 40 larger, but the
great increase has come about in
the increase of 115 in the Upper Di
vision and the 60 in the Lower Divi
sion. Statistics compiled at the end
of July recorded 597 men and 422
women.
SOCIAL PROGRAM
The social program has been ex
panded greatly this summer on ac
count of the greater number of un
dergraduate men and women. Fre
quent jolly-ups, a swimming trip, a
roller-skating party, and a faculty
student University Day with sports,
picnic supper, and a barn dance
have been features. I look forward
to an augmentation in these inde
pendent activities in the 1942 sum
mer quarter.
The students have been conspicu
ous in being present at the Brahms
concerts, lecture series, and the
Tuesday Evening Programs. The
record-breaking attendance at the
Brahms Concerts (over 6,000 and the
Tuesday Evening Series over 7,000)
can be attributed in part to the
greater student participation than
the rest of the year,
The Wednesday Afternoon Lec
ture Series by visiting professors
