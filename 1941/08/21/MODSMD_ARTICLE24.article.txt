# Kefauver Likes Student Spirit
## Education Morale Discussed by Dean 
### 
"Never have I seen and worked
with an abler or finer spirited group
in the School of Education than those
students of this summer quarter,"
Grayson Kefauver, dean of the
School of Education, said yesterday
when asked his impressions of the
summer session.
"The faculty was particularly im
pressed with the spirit and morale of
the summer group," the Dean con
tinued. He added that this spirit
and morale was "partly related to
the total international crisis and in
appreciation of the fact that educa
tion has an important job to do in
the emergency.
"The conference on 'Education
for National Defense and After,' held
here July 17-20, was enthusiastic
ally received by those irT attendance
and brought to the campus a con
siderable number of educational
workers. In the discussions particu
lar attention was given both to the
immediate adaptations required of
education and to the education which
will serve the readjustment problems
following the national emergency,"
he continued.
He pointed out the fact that of
the 518 graduates in attendance this
quarter, 252 were enrolled in the
School of Education and that only
eight undergraduates were enrolled
in the school.
He commented further on the
relative merits of both the Work
shop on Teacher Development and
the Social Education Investigation
Workshop, the latter being headed
by him and Professor Quillen of the
department.
