# Movies Show Alaskan Beauty
## Tuesday Series Sees 'Defrosted Alaska' 
### 
Alaska is not the cold and obso
lete backland that has been pic
tured in so many people's minds.
So the Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence found out as they watched "De
frosted Alaska," a color motion pic
ture filmed by Karl Robinson.
Filled with scenes of unsurpassed
beauty, of flowers and fish, huskies
and moose, parts of this movie of
the southeastern area of Alaska
could have been taken in California.
HUMANIZE ALASKA
"We want to humanize Alaska in
terms of Americanization," said Mr.
Robinson, who spent four years in
that country making the picture.
"Few people in this country realize
the natural beauties of the terri
tory.
"The population is only 70,000,"
said Mr. Robinson. "That makes
about one-tenth of a man per square
mile."
This United States possession has
become extremely vital to national
defense and is being strengthened at
present as a naval base.
SALMON FIGHT STREAMS
Mr. Robinson filmed some excel
lent shots of salmon fighting their
way up streams and rivers to reach
spawning grounds. He spent four
weeks in capturing some pictures of
bears lazily catching the fish on the
river bank.
Previous to his trip to Alaska, Mr.
Robinson spent nine years in the Far
East, where he became interested in
photography. His skill in the use
of colored film, and his artistic abil
ity in filming his subjects gave "De
frosted Alaska" the comment as "the
best pictures ever made in that
territory."
This was the last of the series for
the summer, but they will be re
sumed on October 7.

a member of Stanford's Class of '95.
