Although Cornell lost a host of
backs and linemen from last yeax - 's
"dream team," the big red machine
will be able to put up a respectable
battle in most of its games this year.
Standout for the new Cornell ma
chine will be Lou Buffalino passing
and running star, who flashed every
time he broke into the lineup last
year. Another boy who may make
Ithicans forget the past is Joe Mar
tin, a hard-running Sophomore.
On the line Snavely will have only
Pete Wolff, Ed Van Order, and Norm
Christesen as veterans, with the rest
of the line positions held down by
newcomers.
