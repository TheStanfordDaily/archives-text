# Punters Return To UCLA Squad
## 
### 
If the U.C.L.A. gridders have noth- :
ing else, the Bruins will have some
of the finest punters in the country
this year. Veteran hooters coming
back for another year are Noah Cur
ti, fullback, and Leo Cantor, left
half.
Curti's average of 40.82 yards last
year placed him third on the Pacific
Coast behind Norman Stundlee of
Stanford and Leonard Isberg of Ore
gon. Washington's famed Dean Mc-
Adams was third. Izzy Cantor netted
35.50 yards but was deadly accurate
when angling for coffin-corner
placements.
To back these two punters will be j
a pair of sophomores, Bob Water
field and George Phillips. Waterfield I
is consistent at 50 yards, and Phil- 1
lips has an average well over (10
yards.
