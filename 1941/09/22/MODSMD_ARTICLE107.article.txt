J NLIKE the little Irish boy who, when questioned by a policeman after
having broken a large plate glass window, said, "I was on my way to
confession and lacked material," we find ourself with so much material on
hand and in mind that the question of where to begin looms as a problem.
However, on analyzing the thoughts of most of the other people, it be
comes quite apparent that FOOTBALL is the subject of the day. All that
nonsense about the great fall madness being "just around the corner"
doesn't hold water anymore. For there is no denying that football is finally
here; and it'll stay for quite a few months.
While football in general is an interesting topic, Stanford football is what
most of us are thinking about these days. Will the Indians come up with

another winner? Will Frankie Albert
repeat as an All-American? Who
will handle the duties that Dick
Palmer, Norm Standlee, Hugh Gal
larneau, and Stan CiralT took care of
in 1940? These and a hundred other
questions arc making the rounds
these days in 110 uncertain manner,
and, more often than not, definite
answers are lacking.
Here on the Farm a peculiar situa
tion exists, as far as football is con
".•erned. Clark Daniel Shaughnesssy,
he of rags-to-riches fame, has a great
crew of gridders to work with, in
cluding such well-known boys as
Chuck Taylor, Bruno Banducci, Pete
Kmetovic, Ed Stamm, Fred Meyer,
Vic Lindskog, Ken Robesky, and a
host of others. Sports enthusiasts
the nation over are picking the In
dians to do a repeat performance of
their great 1940 season, at least to
the extent of eoDDine the Pacific

Coast Conference race and thereby moving into the Rose Bowl on New
Year's Day, 1942.
It's possible.
But we should keep in mind the fact that only once in a blue moon do
undefeated teams turn up year after year. Clark Shaughnessy and his hoys
could hardly come through with a better season this year than they did
last. Now could they? And it is quite probable that they won't do as well.
If they drop a few. it shouldn't be the cause for any criticism from the oli
so-many grid "authorities." Not that we're counting on the Indians to be a
great let-down in comparison to last season's gang. On the contrary, we
look for the 1941 Model T to be a great outfit. But counting on the Indians
to be undefeated is another matter, and just a little too much to expect.
11. seems to us that it would be much more interesing if the attitude not
only on the Farm but the nation over was much the same this year as it was
12 months ago, when no one was depending on Stanford to win more than
two or three games. It certainly was great watching them surprise every
weekend. '

TPHE going will undoubtedly be plenty tough. This is just a tough loop to
play ball in. And to make it worse, every outfit in it, plus Santa Clara
and U.S.F., is pointing for its encounter with the Redskins. Just stop a
second to look over the schedule Stanford faces in its attempt to take the
crown for the second consecutive year.
Less than three weeks after the first practice, down booms Coach Tex
Oliver's University of Oregon Ducks, an outfit that has "danger" labeled
all over it. Usually Stanford has an opportunity to get the jump on its first
foe because of the fact that classes on the Farm start late, thus giving the
coaches a chance to work their team twice per day. But Oregon is working
on the same set-up; furthermore, conference rules now limit the number
of practice sessions to 21. And Oliver has a reputation for getting his teams
into shape in jig time. All of which makes it look as if the Model T has a
real test on its hands come September 27.
The following weeks Babe Horrell, the Bruins, and the "Q-T" formation
trek up from the southland, confident, but d glad Norm Standlee won't
be around to tear them apart again. And then it's a irip to Corvallis, Ore.,
Sor the Indians, the occasion being a contest in football against Lon
Steiner's crew from Oregon State College. And despite the loss of the great
Jim Kisselberg and Leonard Younce, the Beavers are still in there pitching.
U.S.F. is next on Stanford's list, followed in rapid order by Washington,
Santa Clara, U.S.C., Washington State, and California. The Huskies appear
to be the most dangerous team on the coast, as far as the Indians' record is
concerned, although the others are far from being pushovers. As a matter
of fact, it's hard to find a soft touch in the lot.
What makes the Washington fracas an even higher barrier is the fact
that Seattle will be the scene of the goings on. And Seattle weather—well,
you know. Stanford didn't have to play on a wet field once last season.
Santa Clara is always tough, and, although Buck Shaw lost Harry Sanders
and Jimmy Johnson, he still has Kenny Casanega, who is rated as one of
the best passers on the Coast. This game looks like an awful toughie.

U.S.C., new coach and all, plan to
make things hot for the Indians on
the date of November 8. And don't
think that they can't. Head Man Sam
Barry has Bobby Robertson, who
doesn't have to take a back seat to
anybody when it comes to playing
that old grid game. Washington State
has Bill Sewell but not much else.
If there's a breather at the tail end
of the season, this may be it.
Following a week layoff, the Red
skins roll slam-bang into their tradi
tional cross-bay foes, California's
Golden Bears, one of the three top
conference teams in pre-season
guesses. And it's the Big Game,
which means that anything can hap
pen.
That's the schedule. If you can
figure out a tougher one in this loop,
write the officials when they draw
up next year's plans. And if the In
dians come through unscathed, we
wouldn't be surprised to see Coach
Clark giving Franklin D. some com
petition at the next election. He'll
be that popular.
