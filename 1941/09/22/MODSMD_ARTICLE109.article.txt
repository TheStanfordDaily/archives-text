# Cleveland Diamondmen Begin Juggling Team
## 
### 
The Cleveland Indians started
juggling their team around last
week, when they sold Roy "Beau"
Bell to the Wilkesbarre, Pa., team,
one of their eastern farms. Others
who may soon be on the block are
Pitchers Mel Harder and Joe He
ving, Outfielder Larry Rosenthal
and Infielder Russ Peters.

Mitch Shadid, guard on the Okla
hom Sooners front wall, has been
said by many to have the meanest
face in football.
