# Polo Squad Loses Three Lettermen
## 
### 
From a squad that went through
a mediocre season last year and is
now handicapped by the loss of three
first string players, Lieutenant R. A.
Eanzoni, Stanford's polo coach, will
attempt to rebuild a four capable of
meeting such powerful opponents as
Arizona, the University of Utah, and
the S.C. Trojans.
Captain Joe Smith, Stan Glikbarg,
and Art LaPrada left the No. 2, 3,
and 4 positions open when they grad
uated. Only remaining member of
last year's foursome is Bill Durker.
Lieutenant Ranzoni is expecting
Bon Snure, Mike Gates, and Jack
Nieble to move into the posts va
cated by the seniors. These three
horsemen all saw action as mem
bers of last year's traveling squad.
No definite schedule has been
formed, but the Indian poloists will
probably meet the University of
Utah here, Arizona at Tucson, the
University of Southern California
and Riviera Country Club at Los
Angeles.
