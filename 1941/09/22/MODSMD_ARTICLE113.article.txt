# Athertonized Cinder Squad Heads For Tough '42 Season
## 
### 
While fho football and h&skctltall outlooks weren't so rosy a few years
hark a potent track team upheld the Stanford winning tradition. Now
with the Shaughnessy and Dean-coached boys primed for national cham
pionships the) spike team will take, for the second year in a row, the
role of the underdog. a

However, Indian track prospects
are on the upswing, principally be
cause they couldn't go any lower.
A high-class frosh team could have
brought the squad back on the win
ning trail, but ex-F.8.1.-man Edwin
Atherton spiked these hopes by in
eligibilizing Bob Waters, Bill Jos
lyn, and Jean Lamoure.
Francis Olson, lone Card hope in
the distances, may not return to his
classes due to an excellent defense
industry job. This leaves sophomore
Bob Compton as the only man on
the squad who can run a distance
longer than a half-mile with any
degree of success.
The sprints will be manned by

Ken Taix and Buck Fawcett, who
followed Waters to the tape in the
frosh dashes. Taix, who was timed
in 9.8 and 21.6 at San Jose H.S.,
was hampered by an ankle injury
last year.
Gene Kern, winner of the S.C.
meet broad jump, will captain the
1942 outfit. Kern's mark of 23 feet
9 inches will stand up against most
competition.
Don Reiss, outstanding remaining
member of the frosh team, will lead
a better than average group of
hurdlers. Ed Hertel, another good
prospect of last year who was
plagued wtih ill health, should re
gain his junior college form. Joe

Mardesich, now footballing, and
Vern Hart, number one high jumper,
may take a crack at the high hur
dles, while Kern, with a little expe
rience, should develop as a better
than-average low stickman.
Ed Tomaso and Russ Peck both
have scaled 13-6 in the pole vault,
but Peck's return to school is doubt
ful. Hart should do better than 6-6
in the high jump.
If Ed Stamm and Bob Millington
can leave spring football practice,
they will bolster the weight events
which are otherwise very weak. Both
men are big and should improve
greatly with time.
The javelin and relay are totally
void of experienced talent but John
Hemphill might develop into a
point-winning spearman.
If Coach Pitch Johnson can add a
couple of junior college transfers to
this team to fill in the gaps, he will j
have an organization that is capable ;
of trouncing San Jose and U.C.L.A. j
and of giving Fresno State a real |
battle.

Governor Stanford was an ardent
supporter of Lincoln and the Union.
