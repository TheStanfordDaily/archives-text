# Farm Men Appear With '41 All-Stars
## Standlee, Gallarneau With Team Selected By Nation-Wide Vote 
### VIC MINAHAN 
Two members of Stanford's 1040
Rose Bowl ehampions — Fullback
Norman Standlee and Halfback
Hugh Gallarneau—appeared in the
1941 Chicago All-Star game, in
which the professional champion
Chicago Bears whipped the Colle
giate All-Stars 37-13.
The All-Star team, which was
picked by a vote of fans through
out the country, was coached by
Carl Snavely of Cornell. Stanford s
Clark Shaughnessy was offered the
job, but turned it down in fairness
to the Bear coach, George Halas,
with whom he has collaborated on
the "T" formation used by the Bears
as well as Shaughnessy's Stanford
squad.
Although neither of the Stanford
backs were picked as the starting
team, Coach Snavely put in Stand
lee immediately after the kick-off,
in place of Wisconsin's George
Paskvan, the starting fullback. Norm
played most of the rest of the game,
and along with Tom Harmon of
Michigan and George Franck of
Minnesota, was outstanding in the
Collegians' backfield.
Gallarneau was used by Snavely
to replace both Harmon and Franck,
and although he did not see as much
action as his teammate Standlee, he
played excellent ball.
Both Stanford men sparkled on
the defense, which against the pow
erhouse Bears is quite a feat. In
spite of the success with which the
Bears used their powerful plunges
which have torn apart more than
one National League line, both
Standlee and Gallarneau were con
tinually in on tackles in which the
Chicago giants were hurled back.
In the second quarter especially,
the sound of the announcer's voice
saying "The tackle was by Standlee
of Stanford," "Standlee was in on
that tackle," "The play was broken
up by Standlee," became almost mo
notonous and drew comments from
coaches and writers in the press box.
Many sports writers have already
picked Norm as the outstanding
professional rookie of 1941.
After the game, which was at
tended by a record crowd of over
98,000, Standlee and Gallarneau re
ported for practice with the Bears,
who are favored to cop the National
League crown again this year. Since
both have had experience with the
"T" formation and Standlee espe
cially is the type of tough, plunging
back used by the Bears, they are
expected to see plenty action in the
play-for-pay league wars this year.
Stan Graff, the only other Stan
ford first team member to graduate,
was picked on the All-Star team,
but was not on hand for the game.

Two members of Stanford's 1040
Rose Bowl ehampions — Fullback
Norman Standlee and Halfback
Hugh Gallarneau—appeared in the
1941 Chicago All-Star game, in
which the professional champion
Chicago Bears whipped the Colle
giate All-Stars 37-13.
The All-Star team, which was
picked by a vote of fans through
out the country, was coached by
Carl Snavely of Cornell. Stanford s
Clark Shaughnessy was offered the
job, but turned it down in fairness
to the Bear coach, George Halas,
with whom he has collaborated on
the "T" formation used by the Bears
as well as Shaughnessy's Stanford
squad.
Although neither of the Stanford
backs were picked as the starting
team, Coach Snavely put in Stand
lee immediately after the kick-off,
in place of Wisconsin's George
Paskvan, the starting fullback. Norm
played most of the rest of the game,
and along with Tom Harmon of
Michigan and George Franck of
Minnesota, was outstanding in the
Collegians' backfield.
Gallarneau was used by Snavely
to replace both Harmon and Franck,
and although he did not see as much
action as his teammate Standlee, he
played excellent ball.
Both Stanford men sparkled on
the defense, which against the pow
erhouse Bears is quite a feat. In
spite of the success with which the
Bears used their powerful plunges
which have torn apart more than
one National League line, both
Standlee and Gallarneau were con
tinually in on tackles in which the
Chicago giants were hurled back.
In the second quarter especially,
the sound of the announcer's voice
saying "The tackle was by Standlee
of Stanford," "Standlee was in on
that tackle," "The play was broken
up by Standlee," became almost mo
notonous and drew comments from
coaches and writers in the press box.
Many sports writers have already
picked Norm as the outstanding
professional rookie of 1941.
After the game, which was at
tended by a record crowd of over
98,000, Standlee and Gallarneau re
ported for practice with the Bears,
who are favored to cop the National
League crown again this year. Since
both have had experience with the
"T" formation and Standlee espe
cially is the type of tough, plunging
back used by the Bears, they are
expected to see plenty action in the
play-for-pay league wars this year.
