"Who Goes There?" the ancient
query for identification, rang out
over the Stanford Stadium in 1935
just before the Big Game that year
when Stub Allison, afraid his prac
tice in the local bowl would be spied
on, called out the Card R.O.T.C. to
protect his team.
So, with the clink of sabers and
the snort of horses in the distance,
the fearsome Bears gamboled over
the Stanford green, knowing that
even the powerful Indian line would
meet its match in the army line.
They passed, blocked and ran—their
secrets guarded by the local boys in
khaki.
But—the boys from Berkeley
tossed the game 13-0.
