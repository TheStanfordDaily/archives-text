# Lafayette, Unsung, Goes Undefeated
## 
### 
Although Lafayette ran through
its schedule last year without a single
defeat, little print was wasted on the
merits of the Leopard squad. Under
the skillful direction of Coach Hook
Mylin, the Leopards tripped such
teams as Army, N.Y.U., Rutgers, and
Lehigh.
The Leopards utilized various
spread formations which sped up the
game, and made Lafayette a scoring
machine. The technical expert,
Mylin, also'devised defensive forma
tions that baffled opponents last
season.
