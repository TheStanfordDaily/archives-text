# Daily's Expert Picks Grid Winners Throughout Nation
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
With one eye on last year's results, one eye on the weight charts, one
eye on the various publicity releases, one eye on a consensus of the ex
perts' opinion, and one eye to intuition, championship football teams are
picked. As the eyes have it, Minnesota, Stanford, Fordham, Duke, and
Texas are in. »

Those are the light horses. The
dark horses list Oklahoma, Wiscon
sin, Penn State, Mississippi, and
Tuskegee—that's too dark.
RAMPAGING RAMS
Starting with the East, because
that's where the Mayflower pulled
in, Fordham with a soph, junior, and
senior in the saddle, Andrejco,
Filipowitz, and Blumenstock, re
spectively, should pull through a
stiff schedule, but not without diffi
culty. Boston College and George
town aren't up to last year, but are
still winning teams. Colgate, Tem
ple, and Harvard will be on top for
the first time in many years.
Swinging South, because that's
East too, the major teams are di
vided into the Southern and South
eastern Conferences. The first
league looks like a cinch for the
Duke Blue Devils, while the latter
seems to be a fight between Ala
bama, Tennessee, Mississippi, and
Georgia with Auburn, Mississippi
State, Georgia Tech, Tulane, L.S.U.,
Florida, and Vanderbilt rated out
side chances.
MINNESOTA ON TOP
Looking at the Midwest next, be
cause that's east of the Far West,
Minnesota with its annual power
house should keep on top of the Big
Nine, or whatever it was at the last
count. However, Northwestern and
Wisconsin will come up with teams
that should be near the top in De
cember. With a new coach and new
material any prediction on Notre
Dame's status would be just a pre
diction.
Although Nebraska, only nine
months away from a Rose Bowl
trip, is still slated to head the Big
Six standings, Oklahoma with Jack
Jacobs and Orv Mathews behind
the line and muscled Mitch Shadid
in the middle of it will hand their
new mentor many victories. Mis
souri without Paul Christmas will
be lost.
BIBLE GETS RESULTS
After a three-year plan of build
ing and waiting Dana X. Bible and
the Texas oil-rich alumni will fi
nally reap the profits. Their upset
of the Rose Bowl-bound Texas
Aggies in the final game last year
was a forerunner of what was to
come this fall.
For any mountaineers the Utah
Redskins will have rugged season
keeping Colorado and Denver from
their Big Seven (Rocky Mountain)
title.
Local pride Frankie Albert rates

the big publicity blurbs along with
Minnesota's Bruce Smith as the
outstanding backfield prospects
throughout the nation, with Harley
McCollum of Tulane and Cal's Bob
Reinhard, both tackles and returning
all-Americans, as the top linesmen.

Those are the light horses. The
dark horses list Oklahoma, Wiscon

Tuskegee—that's too dark.
RAMPAGING RAMS
Starting with the East, because
that's where the Mayflower pulled
in, Fordham with a soph, junior, and
senior in the saddle, Andrejco,
Filipowitz, and Blumenstock, re
spectively, should pull through a
stiff schedule, but not without diffi
culty. Boston College and George
town aren't up to last year, but are
still winning teams. Colgate, Tem
ple, and Harvard will be on top for
the first time in many years.
Swinging South, because that's
East too, the major teams are di
vided into the Southern and South
eastern Conferences. The first
league looks like a cinch for the
Duke Blue Devils, while the latter
seems to be a fight between Ala
bama, Tennessee, Mississippi, and
Georgia with Auburn, Mississippi
State, Georgia Tech, Tulane, L.S.U.,
Florida, and Vanderbilt rated out
side chances.
MINNESOTA ON TOP
Looking at the Midwest next, be
cause that's east of the Far West,
Minnesota with its annual power
house should keep on top of the Big
Nine, or whatever it was at the last
count. However, Northwestern and
Wisconsin will come up with teams
that should be near the top in De
cember. With a new coach and new
material any prediction on Notre
Dame's status would be just a pre
diction.
Although Nebraska, only nine
months away from a Rose Bowl
trip, is still slated to head the Big
Six standings, Oklahoma with Jack
Jacobs and Orv Mathews behind
the line and muscled Mitch Shadid
in the middle of it will hand their
new mentor many victories. Mis
souri without Paul Christmas will
be lost.
BIBLE GETS RESULTS
After a three-year plan of build
ing and waiting Dana X. Bible and
the Texas oil-rich alumni will fi
nally reap the profits. Their upset
of the Rose Bowl-bound Texas
Aggies in the final game last year
was a forerunner of what was to
come this fall.
For any mountaineers the Utah
Redskins will have rugged season
keeping Colorado and Denver from
their Big Seven (Rocky Mountain)
title.
Local pride Frankie Albert rates

the big publicity blurbs along with
Minnesota's Bruce Smith as the
outstanding backfield prospects
throughout the nation, with Harley
McCollum of Tulane and Cal's Bob
Reinhard, both tackles and returning
all-Americans, as the top linesmen.
