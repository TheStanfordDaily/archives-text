# Injury From Foul Ball Nets $1000
## 
### 
What's a foul ball good for, any
way?
John Swope, ten-year-old San
Francisco baseball fan, found last
week that it was worth a cool $1000.
John, sitting in the third base stands
last year, was hit on the nose by a
drive from the bat of A1 Wright,
former second baseman with the
Seals, now with Portland.
John's lawyer, Melvyn Cronin, at
first thought the foul was worth
$10,000. But when Superior Judge
Everett C. McKeage awarded the boy
a $1000 dollar settlement, everybody
was happy.
