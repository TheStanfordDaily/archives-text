The Golden Bears from Berkeley
evidently don't regard Lon Stiner's
Oregon State Beavers very highly.
The Cal-O.S.C. clash this year,
scheduled for Berkeley's Memorial
Stadium November 15 is the only
game the Bears will play there this
season for which all seats will not be
reserved.
The tariff for this game will be
$1.50, with all seats to be sold at gen
eral admission.
Perhaps the slight will inspire the
lightly regarded Beavers to repeat
their 19-13 victory of last fall.
