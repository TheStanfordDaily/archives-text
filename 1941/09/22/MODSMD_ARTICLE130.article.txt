# Two New Grid Coaches Take Over in P.C.C.
## 
### 
When legal football practice for
the 1941 Pacific Coast Conference
grid campaign got underway last
Monday, there were two head men
in the drivers' seats who weren't
there a year ago.
At U.S.F., where George Malley
and the authorities parted ways be
fore last spring, it was Jeff Cravath,
the former U.S.C. line mentor, ruling
the roost. Cravath signed last spring
to handle the Dons and put them
through their paces during spring
practice. Just what Cravath will
turn out on San Francisco's hilltop
in the way of an attack isn't so
much of a worry on the Farm right
now as it would be if the Dons ap
peared in the number one spot on
the Stanford schedule, as they did a
year ago. By the time the Indians
and the Dons clash on October 18,
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's excellent
scouting staff will have Cravath's of
fense pretty well tabbed.
ELEVATOR SAM TAKES OVER
At U.S.C. Justin M. (Elevator
Sam) Barry, assistant grid coach and
head mentor for basketball and
baseball for the past several years,
took over the reins as Head Man
for the first time. Because of the
sudden, shocking, and untimely
death of Howard Jones, U.S.C. was
more or less up against it for a new
coach, most of the good men in the
field having signed up with a school
already. The solution to the prob
lem was the promotion of Barry,
who knows thoroughly the style of
attack that has been used at U.S.C.
for so long.
The contract given Barry was a
one-year affair. But if he comes
through with a good season this fall,
Barry may find himself as the Tro
jan coach for several years to come.
BARRY'S JOB NOT EASY
However, it's going to be a tough
row that the genial man from Troy
is going to have to hoe, for he did
not run spring practice and is, there
fore, taking full charge for the first
time only three weeks before Troy's
first contest.
Furthermore, Barry has a prece
dent to live up to. For years assist
ant mentors at Coast colleges who
moved to the top spot have turned
out whirlwind teams in their first
seasons. Remember Tiny Thorn
hill, Buck Shaw, and Babe Horrell,
and what they did in their initial
seasons as head coaches after they
had been promoted?
Barry will be working under pres
sure. Many prognosticators think
that the Trojans have the stuff to
do some heavy upsetting this fall.
