# Cards' Basketball Hopes Dim as Draft, Graduation Deplete 1940-41 Champs
## 
### 
Light grows dim for Stanford's southern division basketball champions
of lust season—of the regular quintet, only two remain to form the mak
ings of a new team, Don Hurness and Bill Cowden.
Of the other three, Kenny Davidson and Don Williams were lost by
graduation, and Fordy Anderson is about to be picked off by the draft.

Also lost through graduation were
John Alltucker, Dick Taylor, and
Bob Wensel. Bob Penn has joined
the U.S. Navy.
SIX RETURN
Remainder of the squad who saw
action on the varsity and will re
turn are Ed Voss, Jack Dana, Fred
Linari, Tom Fuller, and Chuck
Smith.
Jim Pollard, tall sensation of
Beeb Lee's frosh aggregation, heads
the sophomore contingent of Fred
Oliver, Frank McCann, Hank liege,
John Leddy, John Brooke, Bill
Hooper, and Dick Middleton.
"Middie," however, may desert the
cage ranks to turn middie in Uncle
Sam's navy.
If he enrolls at the Farm, Dean is
expecting much of Howard Dallmar,
Lowell High star, who attended sum
mer school in an attempt to make
up the required credits for entrance
to Stanford in the fall.
k SCHOLASTIC PITFALLS
Pollard must "hit the books" Fall
Quarter to remain eligible, as must
several other members of the roster.
Between the draft, the navy, and
scholastic difficulties, Coach Everett
Dean will have a big job on his
hands building a team the likes of
last year's which swept through its
regular season like a whirlwind
only to drop the P.C.C. title to Wash
ington State.
The rest of the P.C.C. members
also have something to cry about.
TAMM, BAILEY OUT?
Up at Berkeley, the Redskins'
arch rivals may lose to the draft the
services of two of their aces, Roy
Tamm and Jim Bailey, and the
flashy forward, Thurston Davis.
With these three out the Bears'
cage stock goes down. Last season
they knocked over Stanford once,
came close to winning twice. With
out veterans Bailey and Tamm, Nibs
Price should be worried.
Down Southern California way,
Sam Barry will be busy with var
sity grid, and the Trojans may miss
their coach until early December.
'O' FIRST
Mentor Dean has slated his opener
against the Olympic Club for De
cember 3.
The next games will be a double
header in San Francisco's Civic
Auditorium with Stanford and
U.S.C. squaring off against Santa
Clara and San Francisco U.

k SCHOLASTIC PITFALLS
Pollard must "hit the books" Fall
Quarter to remain eligible, as must
several other members of the roster.
Between the draft, the navy, and
scholastic difficulties, Coach Everett
Dean will have a big job on his
hands building a team the likes of
last year's which swept through its
regular season like a whirlwind
only to drop the P.C.C. title to Wash
ington State.
The rest of the P.C.C. members
also have something to cry about.
TAMM, BAILEY OUT?
Up at Berkeley, the Redskins'
arch rivals may lose to the draft the
services of two of their aces, Roy
Tamm and Jim Bailey, and the
flashy forward, Thurston Davis.
With these three out the Bears'
cage stock goes down. Last season
they knocked over Stanford once,
came close to winning twice. With
out veterans Bailey and Tamm, Nibs
Price should be worried.
Down Southern California way,
Sam Barry will be busy with var
sity grid, and the Trojans may miss
their coach until early December.
'O' FIRST
Mentor Dean has slated his opener
against the Olympic Club for De
cember 3.
The next games will be a double
header in San Francisco's Civic
Auditorium with Stanford and
U.S.C. squaring off against Santa
Clara and San Francisco U.
Light grows dim for Stanford's southern division basketball champions
of lust season—of the regular quintet, only two remain to form the mak
ings of a new team, Don Hurness and Bill Cowden.
Of the other three, Kenny Davidson and Don Williams were lost by
graduation, and Fordy Anderson is about to be picked off by the draft.

Also lost through graduation were
John Alltucker, Dick Taylor, and
Bob Wensel. Bob Penn has joined
the U.S. Navy.
SIX RETURN
Remainder of the squad who saw
action on the varsity and will re
turn are Ed Voss, Jack Dana, Fred
Linari, Tom Fuller, and Chuck
Smith.
Jim Pollard, tall sensation of
Beeb Lee's frosh aggregation, heads
the sophomore contingent of Fred
Oliver, Frank McCann, Hank liege,
John Leddy, John Brooke, Bill
Hooper, and Dick Middleton.
"Middie," however, may desert the
cage ranks to turn middie in Uncle
Sam's navy.
If he enrolls at the Farm, Dean is
expecting much of Howard Dallmar,
Lowell High star, who attended sum
mer school in an attempt to make
up the required credits for entrance
to Stanford in the fall.
