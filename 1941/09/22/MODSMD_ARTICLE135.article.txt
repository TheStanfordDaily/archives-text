## 
### 
Services of Phil Bengtson and
Marchie Schartz, line and backfield
coach respectively of the Indian foot
ball team, have been secured to as
sist in the coaching of rugby this
winter quarter, it was announced
recently by Harry Maloney, director
of minor sports and rugby coach.
The suggestion that the two men
be approached came from Dr. An
derson, head of the physical educa
tion department, and Maloney acted
immediately. Clark Shaughnessy
was in Chicago at the time, and has
not yet been asked for his consent,
but his interest in the sport is well
known, and no difficulty is expected.
UNDEFEATED SEASON
The team last year went through
an undefeated season, winning the
championship of the Northern Cali
fornia Rugby Union and the Cali
fornia Collegiate Rugby Association.
Jim Wylie, Stanford's volunteer
rugby coach and rated as one of the
greatest foi*wards ever to play the
game, has been notified of the ac
ceptance of the assistance offer by
Bengtson and Schwartz, and has ex
pressed his pleasure at their decision.
GRIDDERS TO PLAY
To carry the football theme even
further, two of the leading men on
the team will be Gridders Frank Al
bert and Pete Kmetovic. Kmetovic
and A1 Wool were chosen last sea
son to be co-captains for the coming
season. Other footballers who will
probably play rugby include A1
Cole, Lee Bickenbach, and Roger
Laverty.
However, a number of good boys
off last year's team, George Jedenoff,
Ned Pugh, Pop Barnard, Paul Ugrin,
John Kerman, and Jake Thompson
among them, probably will not be
around when the call is issued early
this winter.
