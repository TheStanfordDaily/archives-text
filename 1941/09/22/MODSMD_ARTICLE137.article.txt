# Baseball Loses Fifteen Men By Graduation
## Regular Catcher, Two Infielders Returning; Good Soph Prospects 
### 
Though fur off the sports menu at
this moment, a quick glance at Stan
ford's baseball picture tells the sad,
sad story—ls lettermen were lost by
graduation.
Left holding one regular catcher,
two regular infielders and a bag of
freshmen, mentor Harry Wolter has
little nucleus around which to build
his team.
For a mound corps, the Redskin
coach has returning from last year's
nine Russ Smith, the ol' left-hander,
and Phil Wolf, who missed most of
last season because of an injured
hand. Up from the Papoose squad
are Larry Wolf, brother of Phil, and
Don Pendergrass, sensational port
sider of Harry Shipkey's yearlings.
INFIELD GAPS..
At the first line of defense the
Cardinal infield is shot full of holes
with Ray Hammett and Botch Ca
ruso the only returning first stringers.
Dick Middleton, frosh shortstop, is
u doubtful starter. Latest word from
the stocky little man is that he will
receive a naval appointment. Harry
Reichling, yearling second sacker,
may be shifted to third to fill the
shoes of Elton Boone, graduating
regular.
In the outfield three regulars, Hal
Costello, Aler Cereghino, and Cookie
South are lost. Ted Nell and John
Brooke, a couple of sluggers who
patrolled the daisies for the Papeese,
will be on hand to vie for first-string
berths with a host pf others.
BETTER THAN USUAL
Last season the Indians started out
like a house afire, were tide for the
league lead for a fleeting moment,
then fizzled down to finish one jump
ahead of the cellar sleeping U.C.L.A.
Bruins.
Wolter expects a little more speed
this year, and the Redskins can use
it. Averaging six hits per game last
season, poor base running accounted
for much of the team's poor showing.
After sweeping the three-game
U.C.L.A. series, the Indians held a
good spot in the CIBA until the Troy
and Bear series came along, and they
began to slip. After dropping both
they picked up a couple from Santa
Clara and St. Mary's.
WOLTER AT CONGRESS
Wolter is making his annual trip
back to the American Baseball Con
gress, being held at Battle Creek,
Mich. He will return about the 4th
of October to conduct thrice-weekly
baseball workouts.
Always a problem to baseball in
the Bay region, poor winter weather
and rain of the 27-day straight va
riety kept last year's practices down
to practically nothing.
Early astronomical calculations
have it that Scorpio will be hovering
over Taurus about the time Wolter
makes his first call for spring work
outs—rain!

league lead for a fleeting moment,
then fizzled down to finish one jump
ahead of the cellar sleeping U.C.L.A.
Bruins.
Wolter expects a little more speed
this year, and the Redskins can use
it. Averaging six hits per game last
season, poor base running accounted
for much of the team's poor showing.
After sweeping the three-game
U.C.L.A. series, the Indians held a
good spot in the CIBA until the Troy
and Bear series came along, and they
began to slip. After dropping both
they picked up a couple from Santa
Clara and St. Mary's.
WOLTER AT CONGRESS
Wolter is making his annual trip
back to the American Baseball Con
gress, being held at Battle Creek,
Mich. He will return about the 4th
of October to conduct thrice-weekly
baseball workouts.
Always a problem to baseball in
the Bay region, poor winter weather
and rain of the 27-day straight va
riety kept last year's practices down
to practically nothing.
Early astronomical calculations
have it that Scorpio will be hovering
over Taurus about the time Wolter
makes his first call for spring work
outs—rain!
Though fur off the sports menu at
this moment, a quick glance at Stan
ford's baseball picture tells the sad,
sad story—ls lettermen were lost by
graduation.
Left holding one regular catcher,
two regular infielders and a bag of
freshmen, mentor Harry Wolter has
little nucleus around which to build
his team.
For a mound corps, the Redskin
coach has returning from last year's
nine Russ Smith, the ol' left-hander,
and Phil Wolf, who missed most of
last season because of an injured
hand. Up from the Papoose squad
are Larry Wolf, brother of Phil, and
Don Pendergrass, sensational port
sider of Harry Shipkey's yearlings.
INFIELD GAPS..
At the first line of defense the
Cardinal infield is shot full of holes
with Ray Hammett and Botch Ca
ruso the only returning first stringers.
Dick Middleton, frosh shortstop, is
u doubtful starter. Latest word from
the stocky little man is that he will
receive a naval appointment. Harry
Reichling, yearling second sacker,
may be shifted to third to fill the
shoes of Elton Boone, graduating
regular.
In the outfield three regulars, Hal
Costello, Aler Cereghino, and Cookie
South are lost. Ted Nell and John
Brooke, a couple of sluggers who
patrolled the daisies for the Papeese,
will be on hand to vie for first-string
berths with a host pf others.
BETTER THAN USUAL
Last season the Indians started out
like a house afire, were tide for the
league lead for a fleeting moment,
then fizzled down to finish one jump
