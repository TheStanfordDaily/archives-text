# Fall Quarter's Charges Raised
## Investigation Reveals 60% Cost Increase 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Coupled with the changes in syl
labus and community fees announced
last spring, a $10 boost in women's
board fees and abandonment of the
refund system in Eneina Dining Hall
will affect the cost of a college edu
cation fall quarter at Stanford.
In announcing these rate changes,
Frank F. Walker, financial vice
president, emphasized that, due to
the constant increase of costs, the
present rates applied only to fall
quarter, and might be altered for
ensuing quarters.
It was last May that University
officials announced that, instead of
an expected tuition increase, sylla
bus fees would be standardized at
$10 and a library fee of $3 fixed to
bring the amount "made payable"
on Reg Day to $143.
OFFICE MAKES SURVEY
The alteration in board bills was
decided on after an extensive survey
of commodity and labor costs by
Mr. Walker's office.
This investigation disclosed that
from January 1 to September 1 of
this year average commodity costs
had increased some 60 per cent. Ac
companying this rise is a more or
less corresponding scarcity of labor I
and resultant increase in labor
costs.
In view of these circumstances, it
was found necessary to raise the j
i board bill in the women's dormi- |
j tories from $85 to $95 for the com- 1
! in# quarter. Men will be charged j
$85 for the quarter in Encina Com- |
mons, the same as last year, but I
will, according to present arrange- !
ments, receive no refund at the end
of the year.
REFUNDS TO 14
The decision to abolish refunds
does not, of course, affect men of
the, Class of '44, who will receive
their refunds soon after registration
as usual.
The $10 difference between men's
and women's board bills is taken
care of by the fact that women's
dormitories serve meals seven days
a week, whereas Encir ( mons
l serves only six days a w«vk Actu

the constant increase of costs, the
present rates applied only to fall
quarter, and might be altered for
ensuing quarters.
It was last May that University
officials announced that, instead of
an expected tuition increase, sylla
bus fees would be standardized at
$10 and a library fee of $3 fixed to
bring the amount "made payable"
on Reg Day to $143.
OFFICE MAKES SURVEY
The alteration in board bills was
decided on after an extensive survey
of commodity and labor costs by
Mr. Walker's office.
This investigation disclosed that
from January 1 to September 1 of
this year average commodity costs
had increased some 60 per cent. Ac
companying this rise is a more or
less corresponding scarcity of labor I
and resultant increase in labor
costs.
In view of these circumstances, it
was found necessary to raise the j
i board bill in the women's dormi- |
j tories from $85 to $95 for the com- 1
! in# quarter. Men will be charged j
$85 for the quarter in Encina Com- |
mons, the same as last year, but I
will, according to present arrange- !
ments, receive no refund at the end
of the year.
REFUNDS TO 14
The decision to abolish refunds
does not, of course, affect men of
the, Class of '44, who will receive
their refunds soon after registration
as usual.
The $10 difference between men's
and women's board bills is taken
care of by the fact that women's
dormitories serve meals seven days
a week, whereas Encir ( mons

Coupled with the changes in syl
labus and community fees announced
last spring, a $10 boost in women's
board fees and abandonment of the
refund system in Eneina Dining Hall
will affect the cost of a college edu
cation fall quarter at Stanford.
In announcing these rate changes,
Frank F. Walker, financial vice
president, emphasized that, due to
the constant increase of costs, the
present rates applied only to fall
quarter, and might be altered for
