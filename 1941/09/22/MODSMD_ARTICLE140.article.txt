Leland Cutler, chairman of the
Board of Trustees of Stanford
University, has a right to be mad.
Feeling that a man of his posi
tion was entitled to at least a small
glimpse into the inner workings of
the Red Machine, Mr. Cutler
drove down to the practice Held
where the Redskins were working
out and tried to gain admittance
from two B.A.C. guardsmen.
He was refused.
Frustrated, Cutler told the
guards to tell Al Masters that he
had been locked out.
How about it, Al?
