# Prospects Good For '42 Boxers
## 
### 
Boxing Coach Clayton Frye has
plenty of big good men on hand for
the 1941-42 campaign, but will be
shy of good little men when the
glove squad takes on the Bears,
Bruins, Cal Aggies, and maybe Mof
let Field.
Don Grant, winner of the Cal
heavyweight tilt last year in the ab
sence of Don Ward, will take over
the latter's duties for good since
Ward, all-U champ, has left school.
Pete Gadd will be around to back
up Grant.
Mel Ellett will return to handle
the light-heavy class this year with
Jim Thurmond and Dan Lewis
fighting at 165 pounds.
At 155 pounds Ira Fishman and
Al Smith will give the Indian team
plenty of strength in that division.
Frank Hewitt returns in the welter
weight division, which will have
more than enough talent wtih ex
freshman Johnson Chin aiding
Hewitt.
Bud Hebert, Harry Hicks, and
Dick Lyons will handle the 135-
pound class more than adequately,
but both bantam and featherweight
divisions have no candidates re
turning and will therefore present a
grave weakness.
