# Ted Schroeder to Lead Best Tennis Team in Farm History
## 
### 
Headed by the country's fourth-ranked player, Ted Schroeder, the
Farm's 1942 tennis team appears to he the hest in Stanford's annals and one
of the best collegiate aggregations ever assembled at one school.
Only Captain Bob Low from last year's team will be missing when Coach
Johnny Lamb calls roll next spring unless an unforseen factor intervene.

Since Low played only fourth singles
behind Emery Neale, 1942 Captain
Larry Dee, and Jimmy Wade last
spring, his absence will be easily
overcome by the presence on the
team of National double champion
Schroeder, who was ineligible last
season due to his transfer from U.S.C.
Playing behind Schroeder in the
No. 2 spot will be either Neale, jun
ior from Portland, who finished the
1941 season in that position, or Dee,
Card veteran and former intercol
legiate doubles champ. Wade, Dee's
doubles partner from Pasadena, will
probably hold the fourth singles
position behind his more talented
teammates.
Jack Gurley, transfer from Sacra
ment J.C. last year and holder of
several Northwest titles, will battle
with juniors Tom Kreuger and
Charles Hutchison for the remain
ing two singles positions.
Although there are no outstand
ing netters coming up from the
Class of '44 frosh team this will not
be disastrous this year due to the
plentitude of returning varsity ma
terial.
Even with the excellent team that
the Indians are expected to have
this year, they will have no easy
time winning the conference crown
over such teams as Southern Cali
fornia's Trojans and California's
Bears. The Trojans, defending
champions, headed by nationally
ranked Ted Olewine and sophomore
phtnoms. Earl Cochell and Doug
Woodbury, will not go down without
a severe fight.
