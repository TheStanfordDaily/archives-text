### H. D. THOREAU Assistant Sports Editor 
I'VE always had a suspicion that the guys who were the unsung heroes,
who did all the work but never got the glory, who had the title "most
underrated who stayed in the background, etc., etc., got so much
publicity for being this typo that they overshadowed the guys who sup
posedly already had too much publicity.
When 1941 operations began on Clark Daniel Shaughnessy s now fa
mous double-wing formation last Monday, I finally located the real, honest
to-goodness, 100 per cent hidden heroes. They weren't the unsung fifth
string guards on the scrubs who got their faces pushed in by the unsung
linesmen of the first string to make way for an unsung left half.
They were the men in black. Not hearse drivers, hut the assistant
roaches. When a linesman executes a perfect "mouse trap" or when an
end eludes a pass defender it's the assistant coaches who are to be praised
for polishing up these details.
In fact their talent has been so well hidden that I m not even sure of
their names. One of them named Schmaltz or Schwartz or something was
a member of the second four horsemen at some little midwestcm whistle-
Then there was a little man with a high forehead. Somebody called him
Lawson. The other man in black, the big good looking one-I never did
find out his name, but the files divulge that one of them is named Bangtson,
so that must be he.
Now for three asterisks.

HIDDEN away in the lists of the prospective frosh gridders is one Sandy
Atherton. He could stay at Big Jim Reynolds' house for a month; he
could cat his meals with A1 Masters; he could come from the back yard of
USC ' and yet he would still be the most eligible man on the team. Oi is
that unfair? A couple more stars.

ALTHOUGH it's almost as unpardonable to speak of anything other than
football at this time of year as it is to put in a good word for Lindbergh
in these days of pre-war hysteria, a blurb for Frederick R. Schroeder is
quite in order in my scheme of things. _ t , ,
According to the press reports and the self-appreciative verbiage of led
Busing, Mr. S., Stanford '42, gave a guy named Bobby (Husing never men
tioned the family name) his toughest fight on the way to Bobby's second
national lawn tennis championship.
However, Schroeder did not show the true Stanford spirit when inter
viewed on the wireless after the match. Instead of saying that he gave his
all for his old alma mater back on the senator's farm, or even telling his ma
down in Glendale to keep the dinner hot 'cause he'd be home soon, he gave
his blessing to top-sergeant Schmaltz (wotta helluva name) of the St. Louis
navy yards.
Need I mention what comes next? Three of em.

SINCE I would come no closer picking ail-Americans after they have
played a whole season than I would before they've even turned out,
I'll get an annual job out of the way early and pick my team now.
Although my team might not beat all other college all-star teams it
would go harder on a Bund team than the others. On the line we have,
from end to end: Kuczynski (Penn), Kaczorowski (Colum), Frankowski
(Wash), Korisky (Villanova), Garbinski (Penn State), Ossowski (OSC),
and Kulakowski (West Vir). The backs arc Wroblcwski (Notre Dame),
Szymakowski (Lehigh), Zamlynski (Vill), and Lutryzowski (Army).
The only reason most of them went to college was tn learn how to spell
their own names. To round the team out we have Joe Shecketski of Holy
Cross coaching and a second team made up of: Zabilski (Boston College),
Ratinski (Fordham), Strumski (Boston College), Sebasteanski (Fordham),
Zajkowski (Temple), Witowski (Fordham), Maliszewski (Duquesne), Zir
inski (Lafayette), Wasilewski (Holy Cross), Ososki (Fordham, and Smith
(Tulane).

publicity for being this typo that they overshadowed the guys who sup
posedly already had too much publicity.
When 1941 operations began on Clark Daniel Shaughnessy s now fa
mous double-wing formation last Monday, I finally located the real, honest
to-goodness, 100 per cent hidden heroes. They weren't the unsung fifth
string guards on the scrubs who got their faces pushed in by the unsung
linesmen of the first string to make way for an unsung left half.
They were the men in black. Not hearse drivers, hut the assistant
roaches. When a linesman executes a perfect "mouse trap" or when an
end eludes a pass defender it's the assistant coaches who are to be praised
for polishing up these details.
In fact their talent has been so well hidden that I m not even sure of
their names. One of them named Schmaltz or Schwartz or something was
a member of the second four horsemen at some little midwestcm whistle-
Then there was a little man with a high forehead. Somebody called him
Lawson. The other man in black, the big good looking one-I never did
find out his name, but the files divulge that one of them is named Bangtson,

HIDDEN away in the lists of the prospective frosh gridders is one Sandy
Atherton. He could stay at Big Jim Reynolds' house for a month; he
could cat his meals with A1 Masters; he could come from the back yard of
USC ' and yet he would still be the most eligible man on the team. Oi is
that unfair? A couple more stars.

ALTHOUGH it's almost as unpardonable to speak of anything other than
football at this time of year as it is to put in a good word for Lindbergh
in these days of pre-war hysteria, a blurb for Frederick R. Schroeder is
quite in order in my scheme of things. _ t , ,
According to the press reports and the self-appreciative verbiage of led
Busing, Mr. S., Stanford '42, gave a guy named Bobby (Husing never men
tioned the family name) his toughest fight on the way to Bobby's second
national lawn tennis championship.
However, Schroeder did not show the true Stanford spirit when inter
viewed on the wireless after the match. Instead of saying that he gave his
all for his old alma mater back on the senator's farm, or even telling his ma
down in Glendale to keep the dinner hot 'cause he'd be home soon, he gave
his blessing to top-sergeant Schmaltz (wotta helluva name) of the St. Louis
navy yards.
Need I mention what comes next? Three of em.

SINCE I would come no closer picking ail-Americans after they have
played a whole season than I would before they've even turned out,
I'll get an annual job out of the way early and pick my team now.
Although my team might not beat all other college all-star teams it
would go harder on a Bund team than the others. On the line we have,
from end to end: Kuczynski (Penn), Kaczorowski (Colum), Frankowski
(Wash), Korisky (Villanova), Garbinski (Penn State), Ossowski (OSC),
and Kulakowski (West Vir). The backs arc Wroblcwski (Notre Dame),
Szymakowski (Lehigh), Zamlynski (Vill), and Lutryzowski (Army).
The only reason most of them went to college was tn learn how to spell
their own names. To round the team out we have Joe Shecketski of Holy
Cross coaching and a second team made up of: Zabilski (Boston College),
Ratinski (Fordham), Strumski (Boston College), Sebasteanski (Fordham),
Zajkowski (Temple), Witowski (Fordham), Maliszewski (Duquesne), Zir

When 1941 operations began on Clark Daniel Shaughnessy s now fa
mous double-wing formation last Monday, I finally located the real, honest
to-goodness, 100 per cent hidden heroes. They weren't the unsung fifth
string guards on the scrubs who got their faces pushed in by the unsung
linesmen of the first string to make way for an unsung left half.
They were the men in black. Not hearse drivers, hut the assistant
roaches. When a linesman executes a perfect "mouse trap" or when an
end eludes a pass defender it's the assistant coaches who are to be praised
for polishing up these details.
In fact their talent has been so well hidden that I m not even sure of
their names. One of them named Schmaltz or Schwartz or something was
a member of the second four horsemen at some little midwestcm whistle-
Then there was a little man with a high forehead. Somebody called him
Lawson. The other man in black, the big good looking one-I never did
find out his name, but the files divulge that one of them is named Bangtson,
so that must be he.
Now for three asterisks.

HIDDEN away in the lists of the prospective frosh gridders is one Sandy
Atherton. He could stay at Big Jim Reynolds' house for a month; he
could cat his meals with A1 Masters; he could come from the back yard of
USC ' and yet he would still be the most eligible man on the team. Oi is
that unfair? A couple more stars.

ALTHOUGH it's almost as unpardonable to speak of anything other than
football at this time of year as it is to put in a good word for Lindbergh
in these days of pre-war hysteria, a blurb for Frederick R. Schroeder is
quite in order in my scheme of things. _ t , ,
According to the press reports and the self-appreciative verbiage of led
Busing, Mr. S., Stanford '42, gave a guy named Bobby (Husing never men
tioned the family name) his toughest fight on the way to Bobby's second
national lawn tennis championship.
However, Schroeder did not show the true Stanford spirit when inter
viewed on the wireless after the match. Instead of saying that he gave his
all for his old alma mater back on the senator's farm, or even telling his ma
down in Glendale to keep the dinner hot 'cause he'd be home soon, he gave
his blessing to top-sergeant Schmaltz (wotta helluva name) of the St. Louis
navy yards.
Need I mention what comes next? Three of em.

SINCE I would come no closer picking ail-Americans after they have
played a whole season than I would before they've even turned out,
I'll get an annual job out of the way early and pick my team now.
Although my team might not beat all other college all-star teams it
would go harder on a Bund team than the others. On the line we have,
from end to end: Kuczynski (Penn), Kaczorowski (Colum), Frankowski
(Wash), Korisky (Villanova), Garbinski (Penn State), Ossowski (OSC),
and Kulakowski (West Vir). The backs arc Wroblcwski (Notre Dame),
Szymakowski (Lehigh), Zamlynski (Vill), and Lutryzowski (Army).
The only reason most of them went to college was tn learn how to spell
their own names. To round the team out we have Joe Shecketski of Holy
Cross coaching and a second team made up of: Zabilski (Boston College),
Ratinski (Fordham), Strumski (Boston College), Sebasteanski (Fordham),
Zajkowski (Temple), Witowski (Fordham), Maliszewski (Duquesne), Zir
inski (Lafayette), Wasilewski (Holy Cross), Ososki (Fordham, and Smith
(Tulane).
I'VE always had a suspicion that the guys who were the unsung heroes,
who did all the work but never got the glory, who had the title "most
underrated who stayed in the background, etc., etc., got so much
publicity for being this typo that they overshadowed the guys who sup
posedly already had too much publicity.
