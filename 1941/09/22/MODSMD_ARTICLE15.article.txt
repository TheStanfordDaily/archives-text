### HAROLD SHAFER

tract male enrollment figures come Registration Days,

Overflowing Roble and Encina Halls will be in-

undated by a full-quota freshman
Class of '45, with 20 freshmen women
living in Casita, new wing of Casa
Ventura.
NO VACANCIES
"As far as we know, we won't
have a vacancy in any University
dormitory unless it occurs at the
last minute," declared Dean of
