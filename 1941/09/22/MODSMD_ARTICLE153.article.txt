# Firehouse Gang Fagged To Cop Mural Grid Crown
## 
### DON SELBY 
With the Firehouse Rang that has won the title for the past two years
still in the role of the favorite, intramural football, the sport that draws
more participants than any other on the campus, will get under way soon
after the start of school. And the promise once again is for a slam-hang
battle for the coveted crown.

Two teams, the Firehouse and.
Delta Chi, have already copped two
legs on the perpetual trophy that
goes to the team that takes (he cham
pionship for three years. If last sea
son's teams were any criteria, the
Firehouse boys will take the trophy
for keeps after this season.
However, it isn't a cinch by any
means, for there are any number of
outfits that are gunning for the
champs and have the material to
turn out teams capable of copping
the crown this year.
EL TORO THREATENS
Last year it was the El Toro seven
that threatened, the year before the
Zetes were turned back only after
two games were played. Both of
these aggregations, especially the
Zetes, threaten to be strong again
in 1941.
Lost from the championship Fire
house team are hard-blocking Jimmy
McCloud, left half, and Ken Molten,
a lineman. But the gang that returns
bids fair to do a repeat performance.
At the fullback spot speedy Monte
Pfyl, a real triple-threater, will per
form. For the past two seasons Pfyl
has been the scourge of all of the
Firehouse's opponents.
The right half spot will be in good
shape, for Monte's brother, Frank,
returns for another season of com
petition. Two of Frank's strongest
points are his pass catching and his
blocking, both of which were im
portant factors in the outfit's suc
cess last season
VETERANS
Tom Krueger, regular quarterback,
George Kaufman and Frank Farrell,
ends, all return to form the nucleus
of a Firehouse intramural grid team
that has all the possibilities. Not
only do the boys have the talent, but
they work into a smooth-function
ing aggregation with a tricky but
sound attack. However, while Fire
house teams for the past couple of
years have been intact during the
summer and were, therefore, able to
practice, this year's gang was so
broken up that no summer practice
sessions were held.
Despite the loss of pass-throwing
Cootie Thompson, the Zetes have
the material again this year to give
the champs and everybody else a
terrific battle. Sid Hayes, Sandy Ta
tum, John Eikleman, Bob Greening,
Ed Voss, and Ace Hanlon are all
boys that have the goods to deliver.
Lost, besides Thompson, is Don Wil
liams, the basketballer who worked
well on the Zete mural seven of last
season.
ANOTHER GREAT YEAR
Tatum, quarterback, was promi
nently mentioned on the All-Mural
selections at the end of last season
and should come through with an
other great year. Greening and Han
lon were frosh numeral winners in
the fall of '39 but couldn't play last
season because of the rule barring
numeral winners from competition
for one season.
Another gang that will be without
its star passer is El Toro, runner-up

in '40, for Frank Van Acker is on the
list of the "no-longer-present." To
make it worse, the fellow who was on
the receiving end of most of V;in
Acker's tosses, Marsh Wiegel, has
left the fold. Center Jerry Mayer
also gradauted. But the clubmen
still have Bob Montgomery and Bob
Morton, a pair of very good boys.
After an unexpected setback at the
hands of the Phi Delta Phi team that
kept them out of the play-offs last
year, the Delta Chis threaten once
more this fall with an outfit made
up of a pair of real huskies, Larry
and Phil Wolf, at ends, Warren
Thoits at center, and Eddie Gibbs,
Herb Atkinson, Don Selby, and Bud
Ortman in the backfield.
MANY OTHERS
Only a few of the many teams that
play intramural football have been
mentioned. There will undoubtedly
be a large number of other good
teams. As a matter of fact, it is quite
likely that some of the ones not men
tioned will come through to the play
offs with victories over the Zetes,
Delta Chis, El Toros, et al. No mat
ter which way you look at it, a great
fight for the 1941 intramural grid
crown is in store for Fall Quarter.
A new intramural manager to re- !
place Bert Pike, last year's chief, has |
not yet been named. Soon after the \
start of school, however, a new man I
will take over, schedules will be
drawn up, and competition will begin.

in '40, for Frank Van Acker is on the
list of the "no-longer-present." To
make it worse, the fellow who was on
the receiving end of most of V;in
Acker's tosses, Marsh Wiegel, has
left the fold. Center Jerry Mayer
also gradauted. But the clubmen
still have Bob Montgomery and Bob
Morton, a pair of very good boys.
After an unexpected setback at the
hands of the Phi Delta Phi team that
kept them out of the play-offs last
year, the Delta Chis threaten once
more this fall with an outfit made
up of a pair of real huskies, Larry
and Phil Wolf, at ends, Warren
Thoits at center, and Eddie Gibbs,
Herb Atkinson, Don Selby, and Bud
Ortman in the backfield.
MANY OTHERS
Only a few of the many teams that
play intramural football have been
mentioned. There will undoubtedly
be a large number of other good
teams. As a matter of fact, it is quite
likely that some of the ones not men
tioned will come through to the play
offs with victories over the Zetes,
Delta Chis, El Toros, et al. No mat
ter which way you look at it, a great
fight for the 1941 intramural grid
crown is in store for Fall Quarter.
A new intramural manager to re- !
place Bert Pike, last year's chief, has |
not yet been named. Soon after the \
start of school, however, a new man I
will take over, schedules will be
drawn up, and competition will begin.
With the Firehouse Rang that has won the title for the past two years
still in the role of the favorite, intramural football, the sport that draws
more participants than any other on the campus, will get under way soon
after the start of school. And the promise once again is for a slam-hang
battle for the coveted crown.

Two teams, the Firehouse and.
Delta Chi, have already copped two
legs on the perpetual trophy that
goes to the team that takes (he cham
pionship for three years. If last sea
son's teams were any criteria, the
Firehouse boys will take the trophy
for keeps after this season.
However, it isn't a cinch by any
means, for there are any number of
outfits that are gunning for the
champs and have the material to
turn out teams capable of copping
the crown this year.
EL TORO THREATENS
Last year it was the El Toro seven
that threatened, the year before the
Zetes were turned back only after
two games were played. Both of
these aggregations, especially the
Zetes, threaten to be strong again
in 1941.
Lost from the championship Fire
house team are hard-blocking Jimmy
McCloud, left half, and Ken Molten,
a lineman. But the gang that returns
bids fair to do a repeat performance.
At the fullback spot speedy Monte
Pfyl, a real triple-threater, will per
form. For the past two seasons Pfyl
has been the scourge of all of the
Firehouse's opponents.
The right half spot will be in good
shape, for Monte's brother, Frank,
returns for another season of com
petition. Two of Frank's strongest
points are his pass catching and his
blocking, both of which were im
portant factors in the outfit's suc
cess last season
VETERANS
Tom Krueger, regular quarterback,
George Kaufman and Frank Farrell,
ends, all return to form the nucleus
of a Firehouse intramural grid team
that has all the possibilities. Not
only do the boys have the talent, but
they work into a smooth-function
ing aggregation with a tricky but
sound attack. However, while Fire
house teams for the past couple of
years have been intact during the
summer and were, therefore, able to
practice, this year's gang was so
broken up that no summer practice
sessions were held.
Despite the loss of pass-throwing
Cootie Thompson, the Zetes have
the material again this year to give
the champs and everybody else a
terrific battle. Sid Hayes, Sandy Ta
tum, John Eikleman, Bob Greening,
Ed Voss, and Ace Hanlon are all
boys that have the goods to deliver.
Lost, besides Thompson, is Don Wil
liams, the basketballer who worked
well on the Zete mural seven of last
season.
ANOTHER GREAT YEAR
Tatum, quarterback, was promi
nently mentioned on the All-Mural
selections at the end of last season
and should come through with an
other great year. Greening and Han
lon were frosh numeral winners in
the fall of '39 but couldn't play last
season because of the rule barring
numeral winners from competition
for one season.

blocking, both of which were im
portant factors in the outfit's suc
cess last season
VETERANS
Tom Krueger, regular quarterback,
George Kaufman and Frank Farrell,
ends, all return to form the nucleus
of a Firehouse intramural grid team
that has all the possibilities. Not
only do the boys have the talent, but
they work into a smooth-function
ing aggregation with a tricky but
sound attack. However, while Fire
house teams for the past couple of
years have been intact during the
summer and were, therefore, able to
practice, this year's gang was so
broken up that no summer practice
sessions were held.
Despite the loss of pass-throwing
Cootie Thompson, the Zetes have
the material again this year to give
the champs and everybody else a
terrific battle. Sid Hayes, Sandy Ta
tum, John Eikleman, Bob Greening,
Ed Voss, and Ace Hanlon are all
boys that have the goods to deliver.
Lost, besides Thompson, is Don Wil
liams, the basketballer who worked
well on the Zete mural seven of last
season.
ANOTHER GREAT YEAR
Tatum, quarterback, was promi
nently mentioned on the All-Mural
selections at the end of last season
and should come through with an
other great year. Greening and Han
lon were frosh numeral winners in
the fall of '39 but couldn't play last
season because of the rule barring
numeral winners from competition
for one season.
Another gang that will be without
its star passer is El Toro, runner-up

in '40, for Frank Van Acker is on the
list of the "no-longer-present." To
make it worse, the fellow who was on
the receiving end of most of V;in
Acker's tosses, Marsh Wiegel, has
left the fold. Center Jerry Mayer
also gradauted. But the clubmen
still have Bob Montgomery and Bob
Morton, a pair of very good boys.
After an unexpected setback at the
hands of the Phi Delta Phi team that
kept them out of the play-offs last
year, the Delta Chis threaten once
more this fall with an outfit made
up of a pair of real huskies, Larry
and Phil Wolf, at ends, Warren
Thoits at center, and Eddie Gibbs,
Herb Atkinson, Don Selby, and Bud
Ortman in the backfield.
MANY OTHERS
Only a few of the many teams that
play intramural football have been
mentioned. There will undoubtedly
be a large number of other good
teams. As a matter of fact, it is quite
likely that some of the ones not men
tioned will come through to the play
offs with victories over the Zetes,
Delta Chis, El Toros, et al. No mat
ter which way you look at it, a great
fight for the 1941 intramural grid
crown is in store for Fall Quarter.
A new intramural manager to re- !
place Bert Pike, last year's chief, has |
not yet been named. Soon after the \
start of school, however, a new man I
will take over, schedules will be
drawn up, and competition will begin.
With the Firehouse Rang that has won the title for the past two years
still in the role of the favorite, intramural football, the sport that draws
more participants than any other on the campus, will get under way soon
after the start of school. And the promise once again is for a slam-hang
battle for the coveted crown.

Two teams, the Firehouse and.
Delta Chi, have already copped two
legs on the perpetual trophy that
goes to the team that takes (he cham
pionship for three years. If last sea
son's teams were any criteria, the
Firehouse boys will take the trophy
for keeps after this season.
However, it isn't a cinch by any
means, for there are any number of
outfits that are gunning for the
champs and have the material to
turn out teams capable of copping
the crown this year.
EL TORO THREATENS
Last year it was the El Toro seven
that threatened, the year before the
Zetes were turned back only after
two games were played. Both of
these aggregations, especially the
Zetes, threaten to be strong again
in 1941.
Lost from the championship Fire
house team are hard-blocking Jimmy
McCloud, left half, and Ken Molten,
a lineman. But the gang that returns
bids fair to do a repeat performance.
At the fullback spot speedy Monte
Pfyl, a real triple-threater, will per
form. For the past two seasons Pfyl
has been the scourge of all of the
Firehouse's opponents.
The right half spot will be in good
shape, for Monte's brother, Frank,
returns for another season of com
petition. Two of Frank's strongest
points are his pass catching and his
blocking, both of which were im
portant factors in the outfit's suc
