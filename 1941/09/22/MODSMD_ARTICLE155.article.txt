TjHv embers of Coach Shaughnessy's high-flying
w'w Model T haven't been taking it easy this sum
mer. To the right, Pete Kmetovic, flashy half, climbs
into his truck for a long haul with a load of fruit.
Chuck Taylor, aggressive red-haired lineman, really
worked out on the golf course. He had to take an
easier job 'cause he was losing too much weight.
And Milt Vucinich, who'll probably get the call to
step into Chief Norm Standlee's shoes, is helping to
install the new seats in the top rows of the Stadium,
soon to be filled with rooters. At the bottom of the
page, our Ail-American quarterback, Frankie Albert,
is taking it easier than the rest —selling an ad with
partner Colin McClintock for the Stanford Dividex.
He also worked as a handyman around one of Holly
wood's movie studios.
