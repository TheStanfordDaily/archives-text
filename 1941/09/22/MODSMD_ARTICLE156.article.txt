# As the Fiftieth Summer Passes
## 
### 
Stanford's Fiftieth Anniversary summer was an event
ful one. Following close on the heels of Commence
ment, representatives of 302 colleges, universities and
learned societies converged on Stanford for Commemo
ration Week, highlighted by a four-day symposium on
"The University and the Future of America." The list of
speakers and delegates reads like a "Who's Who" of the
great minds of the country. Then came Summer Quarter
with its record enrollment, mass defiance of such tradi
tions as "Law Steps" and "stockings on Quad." Long a
sore topic with the Farm's "wheeled aristocracy," our
roads came in for some rejuvenation. "Road Closed"
signs which wasted so many gallons of gas last spring
were finally removed. The panel above shows, at left,
Santa Teresa, from the Post Office with its new one-way
division of traffic (well enforced, you see); center, Galvez
nearing completion; and right, Serra in front of the Ad
Buildingâ€”the row of palms and several feet of lawn were
removed to widen for diagonal parking.


Brilliantly lighted during Commemoration Week, the Hoover
Library on War, Revolution, and Peace was a constant symbol
to academic delegates of the importance of the University in
the modern world. At right, ex-President Herbert Hoover is
shown addressing the nation in the formal dedication cere
monies. Behind him stand Dr. Wilbur, Library Director Ralph
Lutz, and Board President Leland W. Cutler.



A present to the University
from the Alumni Association,
this portrait now hangs in the
Ad Building. Mr. Hoover did the
unveiling; standing with him is
Leland Cutler.
