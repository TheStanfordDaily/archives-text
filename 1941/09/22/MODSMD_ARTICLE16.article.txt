### AMIE REICHERT 
| F Adolf Hitler still expects to win
his war by Christmas he had bet
ter quit sitzing and commence
blitzing.
The Battle of Russia is now twelve
weeks old and Der Fuehrer has far
from won it. But he has already lust
Ihe Battle of Time, a battle which
may prove his undoing.
On June 22 Hitler hurtled tanks,
I lanes, and soldiers over the Russian
bolder with the promise that the
Nazis would be in Moscow within
three weeks, and that the war
would be over by the end of the
year.
This is not the first time that
the German dictator has failed to
keep his "promises." But—let us
give the devil his due—this time
Hitler really tried. The Russians
.just got in the way.
The Nazis are, at this writing,
'till cooling their goose-stepping
heels some 150 miles from the Krem
lin. And the Battle of Russia is by
no stretch of even Dr. Goebbels'
i lustic imagination a great German
victory.
The German army is not invin
cible. And its Russian time-table is
no more reliable than Herr Hitler's
signature on a peace treaty.
These are facts. And they have
become History.. .194 l's biggest
news,

Germany the Russian cam
paign is now more than an in
cidental blunder. It is a major catas
trophe. It has blue-penciled Nazi
plans for a 1941 invasion of Britain.
It has given Britain the opportunity
to blast away at the Nazi-held Chan
nel ports and industrial centers, and
the U.S. precious days, weeks,
months in which to speed up pro
duction and trush supplies over
seas. It has taken an appalling toll
in men and materiel, German no less
than Russian.
The astounding resistance of the
Red Army, the scorched earth and
guerilla tactics which the Russians
have Hung in the faces of their
blustering invaders have given
litis war an incredible turn.
Hitler thought the Russian cam
! aign would be a breeze. Instead it
i a hurricane. Only this time the
wind blows toward Germany. One

many an American news an

Flmer Davis, Douglas Miller, and
■lajor George Fielding Elliott he
it ve the Russians are setting the
: tage for a British victory. Never-
I ieless it may still be a long show.
Their conclusions are based on
these facts:
(1) The Nazis haven't enough oil
for a protracted war.
(2) It is extremely doubtful if
Germany can wage a war of posi
tion.
('.]) Britain has had time to arm,
t.ike the air offensive and consoli
dat< her Middle East holdings.
Geography and statistics support
these contentions.
In the first place the unexpected
length and intensity of this new war
have drawn on Nazi oil supply—at
best a limited one—at a fearful rate.
Fiespite the fact that Nazi planes
< perate on a synthetic gasoline
manufactured from coal—of which
Ihe Reich has plenty—there is a
dangerous shortage of lubricating
oil. And according to Douglas
Miller, German scientists have
Mailed to come through with a
substitute here.
In the second place, there is the
problem of a winter campaign. Nazi
war strategy has never been tested
in a war of position. The essence of
the Germany military plan is move
ment. Hence the deadly efficacy of
1 lie blitzkreig—the lightning thrust.
All Hitler's conquests owe their
success to this strategy.
* * #
WINTER seige in Russia could
only be a war of position. The
heavy snow and ice in the North
mid rain in the South would prac
tically immobilize the Nazi columns.
The question is, are the Nazis pre
pared to wage this kind of war suc
cessfully?
Their past performances and the
many insurmountable difficulties of
transportation indicate a negative
answer.
Chief problem which a Nazi army
hundreds of miles from home and
mother would face is railway trans
portation.
Before World War I the Rus

siun Czar, recognizing the covet
ous gleam in the Kaiser's eye, or
dered ail railroad tracks and roll
ing stock in Russia built on a
wider gauge than elsewhere in
Europe.
The whole continent thought he
was a foolish old man with pecu
liar whimsies. But lil 17 vindicated
him, and so may 1941.
The fact is that the only cars that
can run on Russian railroad tracks
are Russian cars, which the Reds
are willing to destroy if necessary.
Besides they are sniping murderously
at German troops to a depth of 150
miles behind the lines.
How Germany is going to sustain
an army in Russia through the whi
ter in the face of these acute trans
portation difficulties, not to mention
the severe petroleum, textile, alloy,
and etcetera shortages at home, is
one for Adolf himself. To American
experts it just doesn't add up.

lINLESS—and if.. .Hitler can spare
enough men to take Turkey and
drive down through the Middle East
to the oil fields of Iran, Arabia, and
Iraq.
That seems to be Der Fuehrer's
one way of pulling out of a nasty
spot. The one trouble here is that
the British have already set up
housekeeping in Iran where they
moved in several weeks ago.
But Iran will never he safe so
long as Hitler menaces Turkey.
For neutral Turkey, gateway to
the Black Sea and highway to the
oil of the Middle East, holds the
keys to this part of Britain's king
dom.
Who will grub Turkey first—Hitler
or the British—remains to be seen.
On this move the fate of England
may depend.

the clutch of the Russian Bear and
Nazify Turkey, it might mean the

WINTER seige in Russia could

The question is, are the Nazis pre

cessfully?
Their past performances and the
many insurmountable difficulties of
transportation indicate a negative
answer.
Chief problem which a Nazi army
hundreds of miles from home and
mother would face is railway trans
portation.
Before World War I the Rus

siun Czar, recognizing the covet
ous gleam in the Kaiser's eye, or
dered ail railroad tracks and roll
ing stock in Russia built on a
wider gauge than elsewhere in
Europe.
The whole continent thought he
was a foolish old man with pecu
liar whimsies. But lil 17 vindicated
him, and so may 1941.
The fact is that the only cars that
can run on Russian railroad tracks
are Russian cars, which the Reds
are willing to destroy if necessary.
Besides they are sniping murderously
at German troops to a depth of 150
miles behind the lines.
How Germany is going to sustain
an army in Russia through the whi
ter in the face of these acute trans
portation difficulties, not to mention
the severe petroleum, textile, alloy,
and etcetera shortages at home, is
one for Adolf himself. To American
experts it just doesn't add up.

That seems to be Der Fuehrer's
one way of pulling out of a nasty

the British have already set up
housekeeping in Iran where they
moved in several weeks ago.
But Iran will never he safe so
