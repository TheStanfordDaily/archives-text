# Dean Bunn Issues Rules for Homes
## 
### 
University standards for ofT-cam- i
pus rooms and apartments in which
Stanford men will be allowed to live
were released last month by Dean
.John Bunn.
Approved rooms must be inspected
and passed by the University nurse
in order to be placed on the ap
proved list. The University does not
inspect apartments and houses of
fered to students since they are
often occupied by older men or mar
ried couples.
Two regulations, however, apply
when undergraduate men desire to
live in apartments or houses: first, j
the landlord or responsible person
must live on the premises; second, j
; iiecific health requirements must
be followed.
