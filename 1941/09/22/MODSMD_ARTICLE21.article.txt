Those of us who live here are sure
that Stanford is a nice place in which
to live. We have seen new students
come in each year and have watched
them develop into Stanford men and
women. With its freedom and wide
open spaces our campus can be ap
preciated and enjoyed only by those
who belong to it and who feel that
it belongs to them.
Under our system of student gov
ernment and the Honor Code you
are recognized from the first day as
a responsible member of our very
large and widespread Stanford fam
ily. That Stanford family expects
you to cherish the University, its j
good name, and everything belong- !
ing to it. For the time being you are
custodians as well as students, and
your responsibility will continue af- j
ter you become alumni.
It is expected that you will build i
up the University while you are j
taking advantage of all that it offers. |
From now on, throughout your life, J
you will be recognized as belonging |
to us. What you do, or fail to do, in
terests us all. We want you to be
happy here, to develop yourself in j
every way, and to sense that fine loy- i
alty which is called the Stanford j
Spirit.
