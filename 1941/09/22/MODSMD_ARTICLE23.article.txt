### 
To all new students we extend a
hearty welcome to Stanford. We
want to know you all personally.
And we are eager to help you to help
yourself in such a way that you will
get the most out of your Stanford
experiences.
To you goes the privilege and the
distinction of initiating the second
fifty-year cycle, which we hope may
have the impetus to keep pace with
and even excel the record of the first
fifty years.
You have twice the potentialities
of your predecessors of fifty years
ago. They numbered five hundred

fifty-nine. You are over a thousand.
One-fourth of the first group were
transfers. One-fourth of you are
transfers.
Those early pioneers began their j
careers under the many trying cir- ,
cumstances incident to the opening
of a new university. You enter at a
time when world conditions are most i
uncertain, when no one can be sure
of his plans for even a full year in
advance.
Many conditions may be different, I
but there is the same challenge and j
similar opportunities today as yes
terday. We hope you accept the
challenge and make the most of your
opportunities. May Stanford mean
as much to you as it does to the first
class.
Best wishes and good luck.
JOHN W. BUNN, Dean of Men !
