# Another Tradition Will Die— Women Will Be Sans Stockings
## 
### AMIE REICHERT 
Another Stanford tradition must bite the dust of tlie inner Quad this
year. Voluntarily or otherwise silk stockings must go, 111 view of the
government's economic offensive against Japan.
Nylons won't last forever. The present supply is the last because de
fcnse commitments are Inkins 11* per P"« luc " on

from here on in.
The only solution we can see is
back to short sox. Unless Stanford
women prefer to go bare-legged. In
which case there will probably be a
lot of rheumatic cases around the
farm when winter sets in.
Fashion per se is admittedly so
much spinach. But there are two
new styles which college women
have unanimously okayed. Long
(60-inch) pearls, and leather moc
assins for campus wear.
CORDUROY SKIRTS NEW
Corduroy for skirts, jackets, jer
kins is one of the best innovations
of America's college-conscious de
signers. Best corduroy skirts we've
seen are full and high-waisted, cut
on the dirndl pattern.
And dirndl skirts of wool are
something new too. These are worn
with lightweight wool long-sleeved
shirts of both bright and dull
colors.
Fashion magazines all over the
country are gurgling that sweaters
this year will always be worn inside
skirts. But there is not a girl in ten
who can wear this style and not look
like a lady wrestler.
STYLES DON'T CHANGE
Braemar sweaters and tweed
skirts are far too bulky to be sand
wiched like that. Probably the "ex
perts" were just starved for copy
and invented that little item.
For it is strangely true that col
lege women seldom, vary, never com
pletely revolutionize their dress. The
pr. sent styles are too comfortable,
casual, and becoming to boot.
The Class of 1945 will undoubtedly
follow the rules laid down by '44, '43,
'42 ,and —way before them—'4l. They
will be well-groomed, long-maned,
well-tailored, and studiedly sloppy.
They will look like all Stanford
women. Which is to say that they
will look like all women of all uni
versities in America.
