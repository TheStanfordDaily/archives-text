# Campus Co-Ops Supply Texts
## 
### 
With enrollment for new classes
Fall Quarter comes the quarterly
problem of acquiring necessary new
textbooks for each course, at the
Stanford Bookstore, or the Stu
dents' Co-operative Exchange.
For the benefit of students who
will enter the campus as newcomers,
these are the two locations where
Stanfordites satisfy their textbook
needs, on a co-operative basis.
With 44 years of continual service
behind it, the Bookstore has become
not only a regular first-of-the-quar
ter tradition, but it serves the stu
dents throughout the year with
books for their private libraries,
small gifts, and all stationery mate
rials. The store began as the Le
land Stanford Junior Co-operative
Society organized and housed where
the machine shop is now. In 1905 a
new building was erected only to go
through the earthquake the follow
ing year, suffering $4,500 in dam
ages. In 1920 Mr. R. M. Stager, who
is the present manager was, ap
pointed.
With every purchase made at the
Bookstore throughout the year, stu
dents are given a rebate slip show
ing the amount of their purchase. At
year's end, amount of rebate slips
are tabulated and each student re
ceives a 6 per cent rebate.
Starting its third year, the Co
operative Students' Exchange will
hold forth in Room 15 of the Old
Union.
