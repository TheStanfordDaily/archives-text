# Campus Road Work Finished
## Five Main Arteries Widened, Resurfaced 
### 
Work on five of Stanford's main
roads will be completed by the time
the Class of '45 reaches the campus.
James W. McDonnell, superintend
ent of buildings and grounds, prom
ises that widening of Lomita Drive,
Santa Teresa, Galvez, and Serra, and
the resurfacing of Santa Ynez will
be finished by September 15.
Lomita Drive, the street running
%y The Daily, has been resurfaced
and widened. Landscaping on the
west side of the Quad, necessitated
by the repairs on Lomita, has been
completed.
Santa Teresa, runing from the
Post Office past Roble Hall, has also
received a new surface and widen
ing. Preliminary construction on
this street and on Lomita was com
pleted during last spring quarter
and the two streets were thrown
open for Senior Week and Summer
Quarter. They have now been
closed again to put on the final
surface and will also open on Sept.
15.
Serra Street, in front of the Ad
Building, has been widened to per
mit diagonal parking. Construction
work will also be finished on Gal
vez from Enciria Hall north to Alva
rado. Santa Ynez will receive a
new surface from the Hoover home
south to Alvarado. Panama, the
road running from the Union to
the Press Building, will no longer be
a through street.
Just as unfamiliar to old students
as to incoming frosh will be the new
traffic setup at the Post Office. Traf
fic traveling west on Santa Teresa
must now pass to the north of the
P.O. Cars turning onto the "Row"
from Santa Teresa must do so south
of the Post Office.
Due to landscaping of the Hoover
Libe, the library parikng lot has
been eliminated. The field in back
of the Libe has been leveled and
I will serve as a temporary parking
i area.
