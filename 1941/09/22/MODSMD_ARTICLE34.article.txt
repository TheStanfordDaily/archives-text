# A.S.S.U. Heads, Jackson, Adams, Extend Welcome
## 
### 
I am very happy to be able to
welcome to Stanford all the new stu
dents, to welcome back all the old
Stanfordites, and to invite you all
to enter into the multitude of activi
ties that Stanford has to offer. This
year we will all have an important
activity in common—one that will
take precedence over all others—as
our interest turns to international af
fairs, and as a University we try to
find our place in the constantly
changing world.
Also, 1941 finds us in the middle
of celebrations for our Fiftieth An
niversary. And each of us will be
host or hostess to many visitors, and
will have the opportunity to help
execute many well-formulated plans.
Besides all this, the usual activi
ties at Stanford remain, and only
with the combined efforts of all will
they continue to be successful. I am
confident that Stanford's "new addi
tions" will have much to give the
University in order to help us make
this • year—although exceptionally
busy—a most successful one.
