# New Excom Inherits Problem Of Cleaning Up Caucus System
## 
### 
Stanford's notorious election caucus system was hung out on Execu
tive Committee's clothesline at the final meeting of the year last June,
and if their recommendations are adopted by the new Excom, elections
may ultimately be tossed into the washing machine for thorough cleansing.
Essentially, the plan would overthrow the admittedly unsatisfactory

caucuses and replace them with a.
primary system, and would further
de-emphasize the Hall-Row split
felt to be predominant only at elec
tion times and pax-ticularly during
spring elections.
A set-up with free nominations
followed immediately by a primary
election would accomplish this pur
pose, it was agreed. The retiring
Excom also recommended to their
successors a ruling that no publica
tion or distribution of written cam
paign material be allowed on the
campus, other than through the im
partial columns of The Daily.
Other business follows:
DORMANT: Reporting on inactive
organizations, graduating Associated
Students President Bruce Jessup de
clared, "Axe Society, we found, is
plenty defunct. It hasn't turned a
wheel all quarter, nor elected new
members."

$21,224 for this year was approved,
after being submitted by retiring
Student Manager Dick Stepp, who

Kellar.

$80,000 was being spent in improve
ment of the Stanford Stadium. (See

STUDENT AID: Rosemarie Mul
lany was reappointed women's rep
resentative and Ed Stamm was
named men's rep on the Student
Aid Commission.
CARILLON: A favorable report

cided the publication will continue,
with Excom's blessings.
NSFA: Professor Tom Barclay was
appointed faculty adviser of NSFA.
DIVIDEX: Frankie Albert and

Led by A.S.S.U. President and
Vice-President George Jackson and
Pat Adams, Excom members for this
year are Larry Freer and Frank Van
Acker, graduate members; Ralph
Clark, senior man; Nancy Burkett,
senior woman; Betty Binns, junior
woman; Charles Bull, junior man;
Isabelle Fawcett, sophomore wom
an; Bob Hopper, sophomore man;
Tiff Denton, member-at-large; and
Dwight Hutchinson, B.A.C. member,
plus ex-ofTicio members.
Hutchinson is reported not re
turning to school for graduate
work, leaving this post vacant. An
election will be held to fill the posi
tion.
Stanford's notorious election caucus system was hung out on Execu
tive Committee's clothesline at the final meeting of the year last June,
and if their recommendations are adopted by the new Excom, elections
may ultimately be tossed into the washing machine for thorough cleansing.
Essentially, the plan would overthrow the admittedly unsatisfactory

caucuses and replace them with a.
primary system, and would further
de-emphasize the Hall-Row split
felt to be predominant only at elec
tion times and pax-ticularly during
spring elections.
A set-up with free nominations
followed immediately by a primary
election would accomplish this pur
pose, it was agreed. The retiring
Excom also recommended to their
successors a ruling that no publica
tion or distribution of written cam
paign material be allowed on the
campus, other than through the im
partial columns of The Daily.
Other business follows:
DORMANT: Reporting on inactive
organizations, graduating Associated
Students President Bruce Jessup de
clared, "Axe Society, we found, is

$21,224 for this year was approved,
after being submitted by retiring
Student Manager Dick Stepp, who
introduced his successor, Jim Mc-
Kellar.
STADIUM: It was announced that
$80,000 was being spent in improve
ment of the Stanford Stadium. (See

announced "indefinitely tabled" by
University authorities.
