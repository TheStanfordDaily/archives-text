# Famed Stanford Honor Code Has 20th Birthday This Year
## 
### 
Just 20 years ago Ihe Academic Council of Stanford University granted
to Farm students the now historic Honor Code.
Intangible, yet as solidly a part of Stanford as the foundations of the
Inner Quad, the Honor Code touches every phase of life at Stanford.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, first president of the University, laid down the

tenets on which the code is
when the Farm was an educational
infant:
"Students arc expected to show,
both within and without the Uni
versity, such respect for order,
morality, honor, and the rights of
others, as is demanded of good
citizens."
Remembering Dr. Jordan's words,
1700 students, in 1921, petitioned the
Academic Council for the same reg
ulation privileges which had been
by the Stanford law stu
dents for a number of years. The
system, worked out 20 years ago, is
still in operation.
CODE VIOLATIONS
Specifically, the Honor Code vio
lations apply to cheating during ex
aminations, disregarding library
rules, plagiarism, use of another per
son's composition, and handing in
identical material for two courses.
Over all activities, on or off the cam
pus, is the all-important "conduct
unbecoming." Every Stanford man
or woman is expected to behave as
gentleman or lady no matter where
he or she is.
Administrators of the Code are
elected representatives of the student
body sitting on Men's and Women's
Councils.
Chairman of Women's Council is
Rosemarie Mullany, a Roble spon
sor last year, and women's editor of
the Daily for Volume 100. Working
with her are Helen Kimball, Alas
tair Mac Donald, Mary Bills, and
Jeane Chambers.
OWEN HEADS COUNCIL
Stan Owen heads Men's Council
with Bob Butler, Lee Champion,
Warren Berl, and Jess Hazlett work
ing with him.
The privilege of taking an exami
nation with no professorial super
vision whatsoever, carries with it
the responsibility for enforcing the
Honor Code. No stigma marks the
person who reports a Code violation
to council, and all investigations are
conducted in secret.
Every examination, paper, or com
position handed in to a Stanford
professor carries with it the signed
pledge:
"No unpermitted aid given or
received."
So many words which might
mean nothing. The difference be
tween them and the pretty phrases
attached to so many other similar
codes which have failed at other
universities is that Stanford's Honor
Code works.

The privilege of taking an exami
nation with no professorial super
vision whatsoever, carries with it
the responsibility for enforcing the
Honor Code. No stigma marks the
person who reports a Code violation
to council, and all investigations are
conducted in secret.
Every examination, paper, or com
position handed in to a Stanford
professor carries with it the signed
pledge:
"No unpermitted aid given or
received."
So many words which might
mean nothing. The difference be
tween them and the pretty phrases
attached to so many other similar
codes which have failed at other
universities is that Stanford's Honor
Code works.
Just 20 years ago Ihe Academic Council of Stanford University granted
to Farm students the now historic Honor Code.
Intangible, yet as solidly a part of Stanford as the foundations of the
Inner Quad, the Honor Code touches every phase of life at Stanford.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, first president of the University, laid down the

tenets on which the code is
when the Farm was an educational
infant:
"Students arc expected to show,
both within and without the Uni
versity, such respect for order,
morality, honor, and the rights of
others, as is demanded of good
citizens."
Remembering Dr. Jordan's words,
1700 students, in 1921, petitioned the
Academic Council for the same reg
ulation privileges which had been
by the Stanford law stu
dents for a number of years. The
system, worked out 20 years ago, is
still in operation.
CODE VIOLATIONS
Specifically, the Honor Code vio
lations apply to cheating during ex
aminations, disregarding library
rules, plagiarism, use of another per
son's composition, and handing in
identical material for two courses.
Over all activities, on or off the cam
pus, is the all-important "conduct
unbecoming." Every Stanford man
or woman is expected to behave as
gentleman or lady no matter where
he or she is.
Administrators of the Code are
elected representatives of the student
body sitting on Men's and Women's
Councils.
Chairman of Women's Council is
Rosemarie Mullany, a Roble spon
sor last year, and women's editor of
the Daily for Volume 100. Working
with her are Helen Kimball, Alas
tair Mac Donald, Mary Bills, and
Jeane Chambers.
