# Secondary Lines Link Soviet Cities
## 
### 
"The direct Leningrad - Moscow
railroad, which the Germans say
they have cut east of Novgorod,
provides the chief rail transportation
link between the capital and metrop
olis of Russia, and the country's
chief port and second city," says a
bulletin from the National Geo
graphic Society.
There are two other lines, how
ever, which afford secondary, if
roundabout, communication between
the two strategic cities. Swinging
wide to the east from Leningrad and
then turning south to reach Moscow,
each of these supplementary lines
follows two sides of a triangle of
which the main Leningrad-Moscow
route forms the third side.

The spots for rides to Paly are
Wilson's in town and across from
the History corner on campus.
