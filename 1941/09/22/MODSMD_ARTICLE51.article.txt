## 
### 
Gamma Phi's who come home late,
and look for those two palm trees and
the shingled front, will probably get
lost. The entire front of the house
has been done over, with half-tim
bering, brick, and stucco. The roof
has been re-shingled, and the en
trance porch has been tiled.
The windows are larger, and open
out; the president's room has been
enlarged; and there is a complete
new kitchen. The palms are gone
from the front, and will be replaced
by new landscaping. According to
E. S. Erwin, Assistant Business Man
ager, the entire job cost $12,000, and
should be finished by about the
twentieth of this month.
