# Specific Program Planned For Transfer Orientation
## 
### 
Like their little brothers and sisters in the class (if '45. the sophomore,
junior, and senior transfers of Stanford University have a program de
signed to orient them to their new surroundings.
Under the general chairmanship this year of Hope Branum, a series of
entertainments, get-to-gethers and aids have been specifically planned for
the transfers.

First of these is the special infor-â€ž
mation desk which will be in front i
of the Administration Building on
reg day, S:'pt. 22. At this desk, Helen
Drummond will receive transfer
men, and introduce them to their !
sponsors. These sponsors will steer
the new men through the intricacies 1
of registration. Women meet their
sponsors in their living groups.
At 11:30 a.m. on the same day all
transfer men will adjourn to the
A.K.L. house for a buffet luncheon
at which they will be given a chance j
to meet their fellows.
That evening at 6 o'clock the trans
fer men and women will meet for the
first time at a banquet in Union Din
ing Room. Further information on
the orientation program will be given J
out at that time. Women will wear
street-length dinner dresses without
hats, and men will wear suits.
Tuesday's Daily will carry full in- j
formation on the schedule.
