# Frosh Will Find Changed Farm
## $600,000 Hoover Libe Is Newest Addition 
### 
When the freshmen come down
, Palm Drive for the first time this i
September, the campus they meet
; won't be like that remembered by !
the classes that have gone ahead of
; them. Fifty-one years has brought
changes in the "Farm" from the days
recalled by the class of '91.
As the campus has grown, so has
the Stanford family. Fifty classes
have survived Encina and Roble and
carried on until they marched
solemnly before the President on
Commencement Day with the spirit
of the Farm forever impressed upon
them.
THE HOOVER LIRE
Biggest recent change on campus, !
with the possible exception of the
new roads, is the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace which I
was dedicated by the Honorable 1
Herbert Hoover, Stanford '96 and
former President of the United
States, .on Friday, June 19. The '
$600,000 building was two years in ]
the making with donations made to
ward its completion by 300 persons
and institutions.
Dr. Charles H. Brown, president
of the American Library Associa
tion; Dr. Sidney B. Fay, of Harvard,
and Dr. Charles Seymour, president
of Yale University, were speakers at
the dedication ceremony in the Me- i
morial Hall before the formal pre- 1
sentation of the building and its
documents by Mr. Hoover. Ac- !
knowledgment was made by Dr.
Ralph H. Lutz, representing the di
rectors of the library.
A OUIDE FOR THE FUTURE
Collections in the library to be
used as examples of the last failure
at an attempt for world-wide peace
and as guides for the ultimate suc
cess of the present conflicts, include
those of 40 governments, secret notes
on war councils, the only complete
text of Hitler's speeches, and the '
entire correspondence and documen
tation concerning America's inter
vention in the European famine after
the last war.
Many Stanford men and women
returned to the campus this spring,
making a reunion occasion of Com- j
memoration Week, which began with
the University's 50th Commence- 1
ment Exercises on June 15, when 98
representatives of the 49 preceding
classes marched with the 878 seniors
receiving degrees, and ended on
June 30 when the celebration
reached a climax with a Symphony
Concert in the Laurence Frost am- j
phitheater.
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION
Attendance at the anniversary
festivities topped 26,800 from Com- !
mencement Sunday to Friday's full
program which included the formal
Academic Convocation, the dedica
tion of the Hoover Library and the !
concert.
