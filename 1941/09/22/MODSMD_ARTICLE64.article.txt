# Frosh to See Typical Farm Social Events
## 
### 
That life at Stanfordl is not all
books and studying will be one fact
that the freshmen who attend this
year's preregistration period will
know well by the time Registration
Day rolls around.
For the program which has been
prepared by Norman Ross and his
pre-registration committee includes
plenty of typical social activity which
will give the new Stanfordite a first
hand knowledge of how Stanford
lives outside of class and study
hours.
For instance, one of the main
events on the pre-registration pro
gram is a jolly-up. No, not what
you're thinking, frosh. Jolly-up is
just Stanford's way of saying infor
mal dance, when the guys and gals
get together in the Women's gym or
some other convenient place and kick
the by now well-worn gong around.
FOR FROSH ONLY
The first Jolly-Up of this year will
take place Saturday evening, Sept.
20, and will be exclusively for fresh
men, although upperclassmen have
been known to just happen to drop
in at the Women's gym that evening.
Anyway, an orchestra will be on
hand, the lights will be low and
you'll be enjoying your first Stan
ford dance.
Also on the program Saturday
evening will be an exchange dinner.
This means that half of the Roble
gals will go over to Encina—God help
them—to eat while half of the En
cinamen go to Roble—God bless
them. And if you like the partner
you get at the exchange dinner you
can take her to the jolly-up; if you
don't, you'll probably take her any
way.
Last but not least of the social

activities will be the annual frosh
barbecue, at which the members of
the Class of 1945 will gather atop
Stanford hill to eat barbecued beef
and other delicacies, as well as to
hear President Ray Lyman Wilbur
greet them to Stanford. Dr. Wilbur's
talk, as members of past frosh
classes will tell you, is no dry, stereo
typed speech, but will be filled with
the Doctor's usual quota of subtle
wit and humorous anecdotes on
Stanford history.
And, when pre-registration is all
over the old students have regis
tered, a Registration dance for the
whole student body will be held
Tuesday night, Sept. 23. Freshmen
will be welcome at this event which
is a "date" affair.

For instance, one of the main
events on the pre-registration pro
gram is a jolly-up. No, not what
you're thinking, frosh. Jolly-up is
just Stanford's way of saying infor
mal dance, when the guys and gals
get together in the Women's gym or
some other convenient place and kick
the by now well-worn gong around.
FOR FROSH ONLY
The first Jolly-Up of this year will
take place Saturday evening, Sept.
20, and will be exclusively for fresh
men, although upperclassmen have
been known to just happen to drop
in at the Women's gym that evening.
Anyway, an orchestra will be on
hand, the lights will be low and
you'll be enjoying your first Stan
ford dance.
Also on the program Saturday
evening will be an exchange dinner.
This means that half of the Roble
gals will go over to Encina—God help
them—to eat while half of the En
cinamen go to Roble—God bless
them. And if you like the partner
you get at the exchange dinner you
can take her to the jolly-up; if you
don't, you'll probably take her any
way.
Last but not least of the social

activities will be the annual frosh
barbecue, at which the members of
the Class of 1945 will gather atop
Stanford hill to eat barbecued beef
and other delicacies, as well as to
hear President Ray Lyman Wilbur
greet them to Stanford. Dr. Wilbur's
talk, as members of past frosh
classes will tell you, is no dry, stereo
typed speech, but will be filled with
the Doctor's usual quota of subtle
wit and humorous anecdotes on
Stanford history.
And, when pre-registration is all
over the old students have regis
tered, a Registration dance for the
whole student body will be held
Tuesday night, Sept. 23. Freshmen
will be welcome at this event which
is a "date" affair.
That life at Stanfordl is not all
books and studying will be one fact
that the freshmen who attend this
year's preregistration period will
know well by the time Registration
Day rolls around.
For the program which has been
prepared by Norman Ross and his
pre-registration committee includes
plenty of typical social activity which
will give the new Stanfordite a first
hand knowledge of how Stanford
lives outside of class and study
hours.
