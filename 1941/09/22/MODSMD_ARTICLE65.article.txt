The Speakers' Bureau announces
that any students interested in
joining should see Professor Loftus
in Memorial Hall as soon as possible.
The Speakers' Bureau is a group of
students who are sent all over the
peninsula to give talks before serv
ice clubs, men's clubs, women's
clubs, and other organizations.
The Bureau offers great opportu
nities to appear before all kinds of
organizations, and is excellent
training for any number of careers.
Mrs. Loftus, faculty sponsor of the
group, discusses with the student

most well informed, and helps him
decide what speech to prepare.
According to D. P. McKelvey, in
structor in speech and drama, the
Speakers' Bureau gave 250 talks dur
ing one 30-week period, even as far
south as Pasadena. The University
has recognized the group, and one or
two credits per quarter may be
earned, along with the valuable
practical experience.
