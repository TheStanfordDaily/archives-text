IN A very few days another Stanford year will
be under way—the start of the second half
century.
To the new students who are entering Stan
ford on the golden anniversary of the first ar
rival on the "Farm" of a few hopeful pioneers,
we of today's Stanford extend a most hearty
welcome.
If a stranger to Stanford were to stand on the
balcony of the Ad Building and watch the two
days of registration on the Farm—new students
with questioning looks and the old ones with
many friendly "hellos"—he would find it hard
to believe that such a community could exist.
A community of young adults seemingly un
affected by the deep-seated problems searing
the surface of this earth with the flames of war.
A year ago in this same column Daily Editor
Dwight Hutchinson too truly predicted that the
Farm's "blithe gaiety that swings along like a
jazz serenade during most of the year may
wear a little thin during 1940-1941."
"Stanford's collegiate swing song" was
"dwarfed by a larger symphony of horror."
The "sanctity of the Inner Quad" has been
invaded.
The foundations of Stanford's famed "Ivory
Towers" of isolation from problems confronting
the Outside World have been struck a crush
ing blow by the mad race of world events.
This race is not one in which the breathless
winner breaks the finish to claim the champion
ship—the tape is a solid blanket of fog cloud
ing the slow-down stretch after the race is over.
The runners are streaking for an unpredictable
end beyond the finish line.
Even during the all-too-short summer vacation,
Stanford's collective mind will have changed
perceptibly, while wading through the morass
of propaganda to v/hich it has been subjected.
After the quarter starts, The Daily will attempt
to measure and reflect this change.
With the advent of these world problems,
Stanford and all the freedom-loving institutions
of higher learning take on a new significance.
It is our hope that they will remain the citadels,
the last strongholds, of studied opinion, of bias
free conclusion.
It cannot be denied that the country's present
mess, so-called the "national emergency," has
definitely left its mark on Stanford. And it will
continue to make the imprint deeper and
stronger as time goes on.
We have a special three-year course for en
gineers; labs are working on defense research;
servicemen get a special rate for football games;
students and instructors are being inducted into
the army and other branches of service; ex
pected lower division registration is the largest
ever as men are realizing college is the best
place to be at the present moment; and the ratio
is closing up to less than 2-to-l as the University
is expanding its facilities for women in an at
tempt to counteract the expected drop in grad
uate men.
And these are only a few of the ways the
national emergency is affecting Stanford.
We do not want to paint a grim picture for
those of you who have not yet had your first
taste of Stanford.
We'll still have our proms, Big Game, rush
ing, Convalescent Home Drive, canoeing on the
lake, and all the other activities traditional to a
complete Stanford undergraduate year. Student
government will continue on its democratic way
despite the blows to democracy, not only in Eu

rope, but also in our country. Stanford v/ill con
tinue to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary with a
festive program planned particularly for the
students.
With all this ahead of us for 1941 -42, it can
not help but be a good year.
Stanford's year?
Yes, but it will still have somber, sobering
overtones being an integral, though minute, part
of a world civilization in a state of flux.
So, again to you who will soon be active mem
bers of the changing Stanford community in a
changing world, welcome and good luck.
