# For Services Rendered
## 
### 
AROUND a campus torn with "Road Closed"
. signs twenty members of the Daily staff
have been for the past several days ceaselessly
digging out the yarns for this Pre-Registration
Issue.
They came back to the Shack from vacations
and jobs the country over at their own expense
to bring you this attempt at a review of the Sum
mer and preview of the year ahead. They have
worked hard and successfully at the job against
obstacles unknown during the regular volume—
important news sources with "Vacation" posted
on the door, disconnected phones, and such.
And so from the Editorial Board to the staff,
this insignificant but heartfelt bit of payment:
"For Services Rendered—thanks."
