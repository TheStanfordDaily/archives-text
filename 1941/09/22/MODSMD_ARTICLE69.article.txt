CIRCLE in red the dates October 1 to 5 on

This is an order of the day to all Stanford

and official delegates of over 200 more institu
tions and learned societies helped Stanford cele
brate its fiftieth anniversary with academic for
mality.
The week-long interest-packed program is de

Now it's our turn.
