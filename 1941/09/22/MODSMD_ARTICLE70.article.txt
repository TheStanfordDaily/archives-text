# BULL SESSION
## ALL ABOUT EVERYTHING 
### 
r J , HIS is the start of a long hard winter. Before we
get through, you're going to hate me. Me and
morning and coffee and The Daily and pretty soon
even Stanford. I wouldn't be surprised if enrollment
figures took a healthy drop. And I suppose that the
ratio will be tougher too. Three to one to ten pro
fessors.
Yes, it was a big mistake making me the Bull
Sessioner. But before it's over and they start pulling
the Hoover Library down, maybe we can have some
fun. Maybe.
Maybe we can quietly, soberly sit and talk for
about five minutes every day. It promises to be a
very exciting year. There should be a lot of things
to talk about. For instance, we could talk about war.
Everyone knows that half the world is in confusion.
And everyone knows that we may soon be in the
middle of it. Big things are happening and being de
cided. To tell you that I know all about the causes of
the mix-up and that in about a week, if you are
patient, I'll give you the solution, would be to tell my
first lie.
No, it isn't so easy. But if you would like to talk
about the war, we could watch and discuss and try
to see things a little more clearly. But only if you
would like to.
* * * *
COULD talk about God and heaven because I've
been dead twice and can tell you a lot about such
things. No one knows more about God and heaven
than a good man who has died and I tell you that I
have been dead twice. We could talk about those
things if you liked.
We could talk about music because it is real and
sound and warm and everyone should learn and like
music. Jazz, swing, boogie-woogie, concertos, sym
phonies, they're all good and we could talk about
them.
We could talk about movies, becausc no one has
seen more shows than I have, and we could talk about
books because no one has read less than I have. And
we could talk about capital and labor and the class
struggle and about Communism and dictators and the
Far Eastern situation and Roosevelt and about the
unemployed and about unions and about the Union
Cellar and about hunger and greed and about the
rich and about sex and about tennis and football and
savat, and about the Ex Committee and about love
and about the Tuesday Evening Series and about
rocks and cigarettes and rain and about the Quad and
breathing and the Chaparral and plays and sleeping,
and about anything you would like to talk about.
* * * *
¥'M plus 18 in the Bawlout. I can relax and look
around now. I'd like to talk to you every day
about the things that happen, about the things that I
see and feel. I don't have to tell you that I know
nothing about any of the profound subjects that I
have listed above, but maybe if we got together and
talked things over we could get a more genuine, a
more sympathetic insight and a better understanding
of the people we live with and the world we live in.
I'm plus 18 now and will have a lot of spare time to
do this with you. But only if you would like to.

about five minutes every day. It promises to be a
very exciting year. There should be a lot of things
to talk about. For instance, we could talk about war.
Everyone knows that half the world is in confusion.
And everyone knows that we may soon be in the
middle of it. Big things are happening and being de
cided. To tell you that I know all about the causes of
the mix-up and that in about a week, if you are
patient, I'll give you the solution, would be to tell my
first lie.
No, it isn't so easy. But if you would like to talk
about the war, we could watch and discuss and try
to see things a little more clearly. But only if you
would like to.
* * * *
COULD talk about God and heaven because I've
been dead twice and can tell you a lot about such
things. No one knows more about God and heaven
than a good man who has died and I tell you that I
have been dead twice. We could talk about those
things if you liked.
We could talk about music because it is real and
sound and warm and everyone should learn and like
music. Jazz, swing, boogie-woogie, concertos, sym
phonies, they're all good and we could talk about
them.
We could talk about movies, becausc no one has
seen more shows than I have, and we could talk about
books because no one has read less than I have. And
we could talk about capital and labor and the class
struggle and about Communism and dictators and the
Far Eastern situation and Roosevelt and about the
unemployed and about unions and about the Union
Cellar and about hunger and greed and about the
rich and about sex and about tennis and football and
savat, and about the Ex Committee and about love
and about the Tuesday Evening Series and about
rocks and cigarettes and rain and about the Quad and
breathing and the Chaparral and plays and sleeping,
and about anything you would like to talk about.

¥'M plus 18 in the Bawlout. I can relax and look
around now. I'd like to talk to you every day
about the things that happen, about the things that I
see and feel. I don't have to tell you that I know
nothing about any of the profound subjects that I
have listed above, but maybe if we got together and
talked things over we could get a more genuine, a
more sympathetic insight and a better understanding
of the people we live with and the world we live in.
I'm plus 18 now and will have a lot of spare time to
do this with you. But only if you would like to.
r J , HIS is the start of a long hard winter. Before we
get through, you're going to hate me. Me and
morning and coffee and The Daily and pretty soon
even Stanford. I wouldn't be surprised if enrollment
figures took a healthy drop. And I suppose that the
ratio will be tougher too. Three to one to ten pro
fessors.
Yes, it was a big mistake making me the Bull
Sessioner. But before it's over and they start pulling
the Hoover Library down, maybe we can have some
fun. Maybe.
Maybe we can quietly, soberly sit and talk for
about five minutes every day. It promises to be a
very exciting year. There should be a lot of things
