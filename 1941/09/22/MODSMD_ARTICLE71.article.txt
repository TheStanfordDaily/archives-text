1") EAR READER:
This column, tabbed "Campus Opinion," is The
Daily's letters-to-the-editor space in which the stu
dent body is invited to voice its views, compliments,
criticisms, or generally blow off steam on any sub
ject upon which a contributor wishes to comment.
Campus Opinion contributors are asked to address
their communications to the Editor, and must sign
their names to the letters or they will not be printed.
If the reader wishes to have his name withheld, so
be it.
The Daily firmly believes that this safety valve.
Campus Opinion, has served through the years to
bring to light many interesting topics of discussion
and argument, has given readers a direct avenue of
approach to the student body, and will continue to
serve the ideal of freedom of speech in the future.
Expectantly yours.
The Daily
