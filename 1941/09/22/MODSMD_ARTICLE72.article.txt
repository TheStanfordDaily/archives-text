# Gaieties Director Ash Wilson Issues Call for Frosh Talent
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Every frosh is a part of one big Gaieties family, according to Ash Wilson,
director of Stanford's variety show.
"If you can play washboards, accordians, or violins, we want you in the
Gaieties," Wilson said. "If you have buck teeth and can smile we still want
you in the Gaieties. We need more variety acts."

Already Gaieties directors are,
hounding down the Farm's beautiful
women for the November show. The
dramatists have heard rumors that a
good crop of queens is at large in the
class of '45.
"We're out to abolish the statement
that nine out of ten California women
are beauties and that the tenth one
goes to Stanford," Wilson stated.
In the way of talent the Gaieties
head men are scouting for dancers
and vocalists.
NEED SINGERS
"Tell 'em we need kids who can
sing. If they can't sing let 'em write
songs," Wilson continued. "Tell any
body who doesn't have wooden legs
to turn out for our dance numbers.
If they have wooden legs tell 'em to
come anyway and we'll create a
Dance of the Wooden Legs.'"
Even jokes are being ardently
sought for the Gaieties. Wilson guar
antees that any after dinner jokes
that fell fiat at a party will be a roar
ing success in the Farm's variety
show.
"The Gaieties is everybody's show.
There are no big men," Wilson said.
"I'm just sort of a midwife helping
along budding geniuses. All I want
to do now is see some geniuses."
SHOW OF THE PEOPLE
The show is definitely not a legiti
mate theater production, according
to Wilson. In the director's words it
is a show "By the people, for the
people, and of the people."
"If you want to find a football
hero, be in the Gaieties," is Wilson's
final piece of advice to freshman
women.
Both men's and women's dances
for the show will be directed by
Adolpho Arias, veteran Gaieties
man. Other stars of last year's show
who will entertain the Farm again
this year are: Lornie Stanley, Johnny
Laury, Norman Ross, Hal Millen,
Patty Bouchard, Tommy Howard,
Geraldine Hughes, and Barbara
Moore.
DATES TO BE ANNOUNCED
Prospective tryoutees may contact
Director Wilson in the dramatic
manager's office after Sept. 22. Dates
of tryouts will be announced in the
Daily soon after classes begin.
Participation in the Gaieties offers
an opportunity for the accumula
tion of points for admission into
Ramshead, an honorary dramatic so
ciety. Ramshead produces three one
act plays during the year.
The Gaieties originated as a com
posite show comprised of separate
acts put on by each fraternity and
sorority house. The show grew until
its talent was sought from the entire
campus. A connecting theme now
ties together the variety numbei's.
