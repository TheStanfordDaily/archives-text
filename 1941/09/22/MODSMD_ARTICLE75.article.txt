# Excom to Approve All Committees
## 
### 
Campus activities are a part of
every Stanfordite's life, whether he
is a committeeman or not. After the
pre-reg program, every freshman
will realize the necessity of smoothly
functioning committees, and he will
want to take his part in this phase
of Farm life.
This year a subcommittee of ex
com composed of one representative
from each class and one excom mem
ber will review all appointments to
committees while excom will pass
final approval.
In previous years, an activity card
file system which contained a record
of every student's activities as well
as the type of committee work he
preferred—be it decorations or clean
up—was used by each chairman to
select his committee. Last spring,
excommittee found that this system
was ineffective so they devised this
new system.
Freshmen who are interested
should consult their sponsors.
