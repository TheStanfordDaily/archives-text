# R.O.T.C. Unit Made Larger
## Becomes Regiment With Enrollment Rise 
### 
Due to an unprecedented rise in
military training enrollment, Stan
ford's Reserve Officer Training Corps
will be changed from a battalion to a
regiment this year. Organization on
a regimental basis affords better op
portunity for a greater number of
cadet officers to display leadership
and initiative, officers report.
R.O.T.C. at Stanford is divided
into two sections under the com
mand of Col. H. B. Allen. The first
section, Field Artillery, is officered
by Lieutenants J. M. Peattie, R. A.
Ranzoni, and R. J. Tripp. Captain
E. J. Soares is in charge of Ordnance.
Field Artillery is a four-year
course; two years of basic training
and two years of advanced. Admis
sion to first-year basic training is
open to any United States citizen
who has successfully passed the Uni
versity's physical examination and
expresses the desire to obtain a com
mission in the United States army.
GET UNIFORM FREE
Students enrolling in the basic
course will be issued a uniform free.
Unlike other years, basic students
will be afforded an opportunity to
obtain the rank of cadet corporal or
sergeant. R.O.T.C/may be taken in
lieu of physical training. However,
men may take athletics and R.O.T.C.
at the same time.
Cadets must report one afternoon
a week for three hours of drill. Be
side this practical work students are
required to complete four units of
classroom or theoretical work by the
time they have finished their sopho
more year. The theoretical courses
to be taken are Military Science 1
and Military Science 5 (Military
Fundamentals and the Care of Ani
mals, respectively).
After a student has completed his
two years of basic training he may
seek admission to the advanced
course. Increased enrollment will
inevitably result in greater competi
tion for admission to this course.
Therefore selection of advanced stu
dents will be made by the Professor
of Military Science and Tactics and
the President of the University on a
merit basis. Records of each indi
vidual cadet will be kept from the
day he reports for R.0.T.C., and se
lection to the advanced course will
be based on this and his academic
record.

When a student enters the ad
vanced course he signs a contract
with the United States Government
agreeing to finish the course and re
