# Students Examine Lake Marine Life
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita gets many of the
marine species from the receding
flood waters of the San Francisquito
creek, according to Dr. Myers of the
natural history department. Since
the lake has no outlet it serves as a
laboratory for the students of clas
sification and study of the habits of
fishes.
