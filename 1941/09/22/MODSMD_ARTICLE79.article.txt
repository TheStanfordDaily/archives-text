# Card Eleven Rated Tops In '41 P.C.C.
## Cal., U.S.C. Huskies, Broncs Jeopardize Stanford Supremacy 
### THE DAILY ANALYST 
Although the Stanford Indians are
once more rated to be the top team
on the Coast by the astute grid ob
servers up and down the Coast, it
must he admitted that rising stock
of California, U.S.C., Oregon, Wash
ington and Santa Clara place the
Redskins in jeopardy, especially
since Stanford has to meet all of
these teams.
California comes back into the
picture with almost the same team
that finished the 1940 season, al
though the Golden Bear will sadly
miss the services of the most under
rated back of the Coast last season,
Orv Hatcher. A new and complicat
ed offensive maneuver is expected
to bother the defense no end.
As we understand it, the team
breaks out of the huddle with the
ends and tackles spread wide and
the guards and backs bunched close
ly behind the center, from where
they can shift into either a short
punt or single wing formation with
either balanced or unbalanced line.
The California schedule gives the
Bears all the breaks, with all of the
potentially tough games coming on
alternate Saturdays.
U.S.C. SUFFERS
Southern California suffered the
greatest loss of any team on the
Coast through the death last July of
their long-time "Head Man" How
ard Harding Jones. Jones had taken
the team through the spring training
grind, and it is certain that the of
fensive style of the Trojans will not
change much this fall from the seeds
which were ingrained at that time.
U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd felt
greatly the need of a good passer
last fall, for sometimes whole games
would go by without the Trojans
completing one aerial thrust. This
fall they have three excellent pass
ers in the running for the starting
key quarterback position, among
them Bob Robertson, who may de
velop into the best all-around back
on the Coast before the season ends.
Washington will not feel the loss
of Rudy Mucha, Dean McAdams,
and Jay MacDowell as much as it
seems she woiuld. Harrison has been
changed from fullback to center,
where he has taken over with great
enthusiasm. Bob Vaughn has come
up out of the sub spot to take over
MacDfvwell's end, Dwight Smith has
taV/sn over the all-important right
half spot.
It is certain that the Huskies will
be pointing for the Stanford contest
in the middle of the season to avenge
the 20-10 defeat after the Huskies
had led 10-0 at the half. Eight re
turning regulars also make the pic
ture much brighter.
HUSKIES STRONG
All in all, Washington, in the
mind of this observer, has the best
chance of any Pacific Coast Confer
ence team to knock over the In
dians this fall, with the exception
of California, where the dope sheet
is liable to fly out of the window
each year. The schedule favors the
Huskies somewhat, sandwiching the
strong and weak opponents in to
gether pretty well.
Oregon is rated as the best dark
horse entry into the Pacific Coast
Conference picture this year, in spite
of the fact that Tex Oliver lost his
entire starting backfield and six
other Icttermen. In spite of this, the
Webfeet, will be able to field an all-
veteran eleven in the opener against
Stanford, with the exception of the
spot, where the man ex
pected to return has gone to An
napolis. If Oregon is to win many
games this season, she will have to
survive one of the toughest sched
ules on the Coast, including games
with Santa Clara and Texas.
Washington State will have the
man that some Stanford players
rated as the best back that they ran
up against all last season in Billy
Sewell, ace triple-threat man. Se
well led the United States in pass
completions a year ago, and his
punting and running were right up
there with the best on the Coast.
MIDDLE LINE WEAK
The middle of the line will be
very weak, as will the ends. If
Washington State comes out of the
season with a .500 average, it will
have to be by virtue of several up
sets. The Cougars can't hope to beat
opponents like Texas A. & M., Stan
lord, Cal, and U.S.C.
Oregon State looks to be one of
the weakest teams in the Pacific
Coast Conference this year after
suffering the loss of the graduating
Jim Kisselburgh and Leonard
Younce, as well as All-Coast Vic
Sears at left tackle.
Men of that type don't come along
every season, and all of them will
be hard to replace. According to
the dope sheet, the Beavers should
lose their first three games in a row,
against U.S.C., Washington, and
Stanford. O.S.C. fans should settle
for three wins in the schedule that
the Beavers have to go through this
year.
SANTA CLARA TOPS
Down around Westwood, the
drums are beginning to beat out that
the U.C.LA. Bruins won't even miss
Jackie Robinson this year, but when
the season gets under way, we think
that the rhythm will change rad

ically in a short time. Poor as it
was, last year's U.C.LA. eleven
would have looked infinitely worse
without the services of the Sepia
Speedster, even in spite of the sui
cidal schedule that Babe Horrell
had signed up. It looks from here
as if their record will be just as bad
this year as last.
As usual, it looks like Santa Clara
will be the top non-PCC team on
the Coast. Always a good defensive
aggregation, the Broncos seem to
have more than usual in the line of
offense this year, especially since
Jesse Freitas, one of the outstand
ing junior college passers and run
ners of the country has signified his
intention of playing for the Jesuit
fathers this fall. Ken Casanega has
a chance of being one of the out
standing backs in the nation this
year, and combined wtih a strong
line, the combination should make
the Broncs practically unbeatable.
At this writing, it looks like St.

Mary's should be able to win only
four games this fall, but with the
breaks could make a real success
out of the season. U.S.F., Portland,
Gonzaga and Loyola should be easy
meat for the Gaels, and with luck
they could beat Cal, Santa Clara,
and Duquesne. Fordham should
have little trouble with Red Stra
der's outfit.
Jeff Cravath, for years assistant
at U.S.C. under Howard Jones,
gives promise of having a stronger
eleven at the University of San
Francisco this year than was last
year's squad, which disappointed its
backers by winning only one game
after brilliant things had been prom
ised for it at the beginning of the
season. Not many experienced men,
but a great number of flashy junior
college prospects should help the
Dons a great deal. The loss of Cliff
and Dan Fisk was hard on the Dons,
but it is too hard to try to call this
one.

well led the United States in pass
completions a year ago, and his
punting and running were right up
there with the best on the Coast.
MIDDLE LINE WEAK
The middle of the line will be
very weak, as will the ends. If
Washington State comes out of the
season with a .500 average, it will
have to be by virtue of several up
sets. The Cougars can't hope to beat
opponents like Texas A. & M., Stan
lord, Cal, and U.S.C.
Oregon State looks to be one of
the weakest teams in the Pacific
Coast Conference this year after
suffering the loss of the graduating
Jim Kisselburgh and Leonard
Younce, as well as All-Coast Vic
Sears at left tackle.
Men of that type don't come along
every season, and all of them will
be hard to replace. According to
the dope sheet, the Beavers should
lose their first three games in a row,
against U.S.C., Washington, and
Stanford. O.S.C. fans should settle
for three wins in the schedule that
the Beavers have to go through this
year.
SANTA CLARA TOPS
Down around Westwood, the
drums are beginning to beat out that
the U.C.LA. Bruins won't even miss
Jackie Robinson this year, but when
the season gets under way, we think
that the rhythm will change rad

ically in a short time. Poor as it
was, last year's U.C.LA. eleven
would have looked infinitely worse
without the services of the Sepia
Speedster, even in spite of the sui
cidal schedule that Babe Horrell
had signed up. It looks from here
as if their record will be just as bad
this year as last.
As usual, it looks like Santa Clara
will be the top non-PCC team on
the Coast. Always a good defensive
aggregation, the Broncos seem to
have more than usual in the line of
offense this year, especially since
Jesse Freitas, one of the outstand
ing junior college passers and run
ners of the country has signified his
intention of playing for the Jesuit
fathers this fall. Ken Casanega has
a chance of being one of the out
standing backs in the nation this
year, and combined wtih a strong
line, the combination should make
the Broncs practically unbeatable.
At this writing, it looks like St.

Mary's should be able to win only
four games this fall, but with the
breaks could make a real success
out of the season. U.S.F., Portland,
Gonzaga and Loyola should be easy
meat for the Gaels, and with luck
they could beat Cal, Santa Clara,
and Duquesne. Fordham should
have little trouble with Red Stra
der's outfit.
Jeff Cravath, for years assistant
at U.S.C. under Howard Jones,
gives promise of having a stronger
eleven at the University of San
Francisco this year than was last
year's squad, which disappointed its
backers by winning only one game
after brilliant things had been prom
ised for it at the beginning of the
season. Not many experienced men,
but a great number of flashy junior
college prospects should help the
Dons a great deal. The loss of Cliff
and Dan Fisk was hard on the Dons,
but it is too hard to try to call this
one.
Although the Stanford Indians are
once more rated to be the top team
on the Coast by the astute grid ob
servers up and down the Coast, it
must he admitted that rising stock
of California, U.S.C., Oregon, Wash
ington and Santa Clara place the
Redskins in jeopardy, especially
since Stanford has to meet all of
these teams.
California comes back into the
picture with almost the same team
that finished the 1940 season, al
though the Golden Bear will sadly
miss the services of the most under
rated back of the Coast last season,
Orv Hatcher. A new and complicat
ed offensive maneuver is expected
to bother the defense no end.
As we understand it, the team
breaks out of the huddle with the
ends and tackles spread wide and
the guards and backs bunched close
ly behind the center, from where
they can shift into either a short
punt or single wing formation with
either balanced or unbalanced line.
The California schedule gives the
Bears all the breaks, with all of the
potentially tough games coming on
alternate Saturdays.
U.S.C. SUFFERS
Southern California suffered the
greatest loss of any team on the
Coast through the death last July of
their long-time "Head Man" How
ard Harding Jones. Jones had taken
the team through the spring training
grind, and it is certain that the of
fensive style of the Trojans will not
change much this fall from the seeds
which were ingrained at that time.
U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd felt
greatly the need of a good passer
last fall, for sometimes whole games
would go by without the Trojans
completing one aerial thrust. This
fall they have three excellent pass
ers in the running for the starting
key quarterback position, among
them Bob Robertson, who may de
velop into the best all-around back
on the Coast before the season ends.
Washington will not feel the loss
of Rudy Mucha, Dean McAdams,
and Jay MacDowell as much as it
seems she woiuld. Harrison has been
changed from fullback to center,
where he has taken over with great
enthusiasm. Bob Vaughn has come
up out of the sub spot to take over
MacDfvwell's end, Dwight Smith has
taV/sn over the all-important right
half spot.
It is certain that the Huskies will
be pointing for the Stanford contest
in the middle of the season to avenge
the 20-10 defeat after the Huskies
had led 10-0 at the half. Eight re
turning regulars also make the pic
ture much brighter.
HUSKIES STRONG
All in all, Washington, in the
mind of this observer, has the best
chance of any Pacific Coast Confer
ence team to knock over the In
dians this fall, with the exception
of California, where the dope sheet
is liable to fly out of the window
each year. The schedule favors the
Huskies somewhat, sandwiching the
strong and weak opponents in to
gether pretty well.
Oregon is rated as the best dark
horse entry into the Pacific Coast
Conference picture this year, in spite
of the fact that Tex Oliver lost his
entire starting backfield and six
other Icttermen. In spite of this, the
Webfeet, will be able to field an all-
veteran eleven in the opener against
Stanford, with the exception of the
spot, where the man ex
pected to return has gone to An
napolis. If Oregon is to win many
games this season, she will have to
survive one of the toughest sched
ules on the Coast, including games
with Santa Clara and Texas.
Washington State will have the
man that some Stanford players
rated as the best back that they ran

miss the services of the most under
rated back of the Coast last season,
Orv Hatcher. A new and complicat
ed offensive maneuver is expected
to bother the defense no end.
As we understand it, the team
breaks out of the huddle with the
ends and tackles spread wide and
the guards and backs bunched close
ly behind the center, from where
they can shift into either a short
punt or single wing formation with
either balanced or unbalanced line.
The California schedule gives the
Bears all the breaks, with all of the
potentially tough games coming on
alternate Saturdays.
U.S.C. SUFFERS
Southern California suffered the
greatest loss of any team on the
Coast through the death last July of
their long-time "Head Man" How
ard Harding Jones. Jones had taken
the team through the spring training
grind, and it is certain that the of
fensive style of the Trojans will not
change much this fall from the seeds
which were ingrained at that time.
U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd felt
greatly the need of a good passer
last fall, for sometimes whole games
would go by without the Trojans
completing one aerial thrust. This
fall they have three excellent pass
ers in the running for the starting
key quarterback position, among
them Bob Robertson, who may de
velop into the best all-around back
on the Coast before the season ends.
Washington will not feel the loss
of Rudy Mucha, Dean McAdams,
and Jay MacDowell as much as it
seems she woiuld. Harrison has been
changed from fullback to center,
where he has taken over with great
enthusiasm. Bob Vaughn has come
up out of the sub spot to take over
MacDfvwell's end, Dwight Smith has
taV/sn over the all-important right
half spot.
It is certain that the Huskies will
be pointing for the Stanford contest
in the middle of the season to avenge
the 20-10 defeat after the Huskies
had led 10-0 at the half. Eight re
turning regulars also make the pic
ture much brighter.
HUSKIES STRONG
All in all, Washington, in the
mind of this observer, has the best
chance of any Pacific Coast Confer
ence team to knock over the In
dians this fall, with the exception
of California, where the dope sheet
is liable to fly out of the window
each year. The schedule favors the
Huskies somewhat, sandwiching the
strong and weak opponents in to
gether pretty well.
Oregon is rated as the best dark
horse entry into the Pacific Coast
Conference picture this year, in spite
of the fact that Tex Oliver lost his
entire starting backfield and six
other Icttermen. In spite of this, the
Webfeet, will be able to field an all-
veteran eleven in the opener against
Stanford, with the exception of the
spot, where the man ex
pected to return has gone to An
napolis. If Oregon is to win many
games this season, she will have to
survive one of the toughest sched
ules on the Coast, including games
with Santa Clara and Texas.
Washington State will have the
man that some Stanford players
rated as the best back that they ran
up against all last season in Billy
Sewell, ace triple-threat man. Se
well led the United States in pass
completions a year ago, and his
punting and running were right up
there with the best on the Coast.
MIDDLE LINE WEAK
The middle of the line will be
very weak, as will the ends. If
Washington State comes out of the
season with a .500 average, it will
have to be by virtue of several up
sets. The Cougars can't hope to beat
opponents like Texas A. & M., Stan
lord, Cal, and U.S.C.
Oregon State looks to be one of
the weakest teams in the Pacific
Coast Conference this year after
suffering the loss of the graduating
Jim Kisselburgh and Leonard
Younce, as well as All-Coast Vic
Sears at left tackle.
Men of that type don't come along
every season, and all of them will
be hard to replace. According to
the dope sheet, the Beavers should
lose their first three games in a row,
against U.S.C., Washington, and
Stanford. O.S.C. fans should settle
for three wins in the schedule that
the Beavers have to go through this
year.
SANTA CLARA TOPS
Down around Westwood, the
drums are beginning to beat out that
the U.C.LA. Bruins won't even miss
Jackie Robinson this year, but when
the season gets under way, we think
that the rhythm will change rad

ically in a short time. Poor as it
was, last year's U.C.LA. eleven
would have looked infinitely worse
without the services of the Sepia
Speedster, even in spite of the sui
cidal schedule that Babe Horrell
had signed up. It looks from here
as if their record will be just as bad
this year as last.
As usual, it looks like Santa Clara
will be the top non-PCC team on
the Coast. Always a good defensive
aggregation, the Broncos seem to
have more than usual in the line of
offense this year, especially since
Jesse Freitas, one of the outstand
ing junior college passers and run
ners of the country has signified his
intention of playing for the Jesuit
fathers this fall. Ken Casanega has
a chance of being one of the out
standing backs in the nation this
year, and combined wtih a strong
line, the combination should make
the Broncs practically unbeatable.
At this writing, it looks like St.

Mary's should be able to win only
four games this fall, but with the
breaks could make a real success
out of the season. U.S.F., Portland,
Gonzaga and Loyola should be easy
meat for the Gaels, and with luck
they could beat Cal, Santa Clara,
and Duquesne. Fordham should
have little trouble with Red Stra
der's outfit.
Jeff Cravath, for years assistant
at U.S.C. under Howard Jones,
gives promise of having a stronger
eleven at the University of San
Francisco this year than was last
year's squad, which disappointed its
backers by winning only one game
after brilliant things had been prom
ised for it at the beginning of the
season. Not many experienced men,
but a great number of flashy junior
college prospects should help the
Dons a great deal. The loss of Cliff
and Dan Fisk was hard on the Dons,
but it is too hard to try to call this
one.
Although the Stanford Indians are
once more rated to be the top team
on the Coast by the astute grid ob
servers up and down the Coast, it
must he admitted that rising stock
of California, U.S.C., Oregon, Wash
ington and Santa Clara place the
Redskins in jeopardy, especially
since Stanford has to meet all of
these teams.

Coast Conference this year after
suffering the loss of the graduating
Jim Kisselburgh and Leonard
Younce, as well as All-Coast Vic
Sears at left tackle.
Men of that type don't come along
every season, and all of them will
be hard to replace. According to
the dope sheet, the Beavers should
lose their first three games in a row,
against U.S.C., Washington, and
Stanford. O.S.C. fans should settle
for three wins in the schedule that
the Beavers have to go through this
year.
SANTA CLARA TOPS
Down around Westwood, the
drums are beginning to beat out that
the U.C.LA. Bruins won't even miss
Jackie Robinson this year, but when
the season gets under way, we think
that the rhythm will change rad

ically in a short time. Poor as it
was, last year's U.C.LA. eleven
would have looked infinitely worse
without the services of the Sepia
Speedster, even in spite of the sui
cidal schedule that Babe Horrell
had signed up. It looks from here
as if their record will be just as bad
this year as last.
As usual, it looks like Santa Clara
will be the top non-PCC team on
the Coast. Always a good defensive
aggregation, the Broncos seem to
have more than usual in the line of
offense this year, especially since
Jesse Freitas, one of the outstand
ing junior college passers and run
ners of the country has signified his
intention of playing for the Jesuit
fathers this fall. Ken Casanega has
a chance of being one of the out
standing backs in the nation this
year, and combined wtih a strong
line, the combination should make
the Broncs practically unbeatable.
At this writing, it looks like St.

Mary's should be able to win only
four games this fall, but with the
breaks could make a real success
out of the season. U.S.F., Portland,
Gonzaga and Loyola should be easy
meat for the Gaels, and with luck
they could beat Cal, Santa Clara,
and Duquesne. Fordham should
have little trouble with Red Stra
der's outfit.
Jeff Cravath, for years assistant
at U.S.C. under Howard Jones,
gives promise of having a stronger
eleven at the University of San
Francisco this year than was last
year's squad, which disappointed its
backers by winning only one game
after brilliant things had been prom
ised for it at the beginning of the
season. Not many experienced men,
but a great number of flashy junior
college prospects should help the
Dons a great deal. The loss of Cliff
and Dan Fisk was hard on the Dons,
but it is too hard to try to call this
one.
Although the Stanford Indians are
once more rated to be the top team
on the Coast by the astute grid ob
servers up and down the Coast, it
must he admitted that rising stock
of California, U.S.C., Oregon, Wash
ington and Santa Clara place the
Redskins in jeopardy, especially
since Stanford has to meet all of
these teams.
California comes back into the
picture with almost the same team
that finished the 1940 season, al
though the Golden Bear will sadly
miss the services of the most under
rated back of the Coast last season,
Orv Hatcher. A new and complicat
ed offensive maneuver is expected
to bother the defense no end.
As we understand it, the team
breaks out of the huddle with the
ends and tackles spread wide and
the guards and backs bunched close
ly behind the center, from where
they can shift into either a short
punt or single wing formation with
either balanced or unbalanced line.
The California schedule gives the
Bears all the breaks, with all of the
potentially tough games coming on
alternate Saturdays.
U.S.C. SUFFERS
Southern California suffered the
greatest loss of any team on the
Coast through the death last July of
their long-time "Head Man" How
ard Harding Jones. Jones had taken
the team through the spring training
grind, and it is certain that the of
fensive style of the Trojans will not
change much this fall from the seeds
which were ingrained at that time.
U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd felt
greatly the need of a good passer
last fall, for sometimes whole games
would go by without the Trojans
completing one aerial thrust. This
fall they have three excellent pass
ers in the running for the starting
key quarterback position, among
them Bob Robertson, who may de
velop into the best all-around back
on the Coast before the season ends.
Washington will not feel the loss
of Rudy Mucha, Dean McAdams,
and Jay MacDowell as much as it
seems she woiuld. Harrison has been
changed from fullback to center,
where he has taken over with great
enthusiasm. Bob Vaughn has come
up out of the sub spot to take over
MacDfvwell's end, Dwight Smith has
taV/sn over the all-important right
half spot.
It is certain that the Huskies will
be pointing for the Stanford contest
in the middle of the season to avenge
the 20-10 defeat after the Huskies
had led 10-0 at the half. Eight re
turning regulars also make the pic
ture much brighter.
HUSKIES STRONG
All in all, Washington, in the
mind of this observer, has the best
chance of any Pacific Coast Confer
ence team to knock over the In
dians this fall, with the exception
of California, where the dope sheet
is liable to fly out of the window
each year. The schedule favors the
Huskies somewhat, sandwiching the
strong and weak opponents in to
gether pretty well.
Oregon is rated as the best dark
horse entry into the Pacific Coast
Conference picture this year, in spite
of the fact that Tex Oliver lost his
entire starting backfield and six
other Icttermen. In spite of this, the
Webfeet, will be able to field an all-
veteran eleven in the opener against
Stanford, with the exception of the
spot, where the man ex
pected to return has gone to An
napolis. If Oregon is to win many
games this season, she will have to
survive one of the toughest sched
ules on the Coast, including games
with Santa Clara and Texas.
Washington State will have the
man that some Stanford players
rated as the best back that they ran
up against all last season in Billy
Sewell, ace triple-threat man. Se
well led the United States in pass
completions a year ago, and his
punting and running were right up
there with the best on the Coast.
MIDDLE LINE WEAK
The middle of the line will be
very weak, as will the ends. If
Washington State comes out of the
season with a .500 average, it will
have to be by virtue of several up
sets. The Cougars can't hope to beat
opponents like Texas A. & M., Stan
lord, Cal, and U.S.C.
