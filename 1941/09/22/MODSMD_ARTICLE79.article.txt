# Card Eleven Rated Tops In '41 P.C.C.
## Cal., U.S.C. Huskies, Broncs Jeopardize Stanford Supremacy 
### THE DAILY ANALYST 
Although the Stanford Indians are
once more rated to be the top team
on the Coast by the astute grid ob
servers up and down the Coast, it
must he admitted that rising stock
of California, U.S.C., Oregon, Wash
ington and Santa Clara place the
Redskins in jeopardy, especially
since Stanford has to meet all of
these teams.
California comes back into the
picture with almost the same team
that finished the 1940 season, al
though the Golden Bear will sadly
miss the services of the most under
rated back of the Coast last season,
Orv Hatcher. A new and complicat
ed offensive maneuver is expected
to bother the defense no end.
As we understand it, the team
breaks out of the huddle with the
ends and tackles spread wide and
the guards and backs bunched close
ly behind the center, from where
they can shift into either a short
punt or single wing formation with
either balanced or unbalanced line.
The California schedule gives the
Bears all the breaks, with all of the
potentially tough games coming on
alternate Saturdays.
U.S.C. SUFFERS
Southern California suffered the
greatest loss of any team on the
Coast through the death last July of
their long-time "Head Man" How
ard Harding Jones. Jones had taken
the team through the spring training
grind, and it is certain that the of
fensive style of the Trojans will not
change much this fall from the seeds
which were ingrained at that time.
U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd felt
greatly the need of a good passer
last fall, for sometimes whole games
would go by without the Trojans
completing one aerial thrust. This
fall they have three excellent pass
ers in the running for the starting
key quarterback position, among
them Bob Robertson, who may de
velop into the best all-around back
on the Coast before the season ends.
Washington will not feel the loss
of Rudy Mucha, Dean McAdams,
and Jay MacDowell as much as it
seems she woiuld. Harrison has been
changed from fullback to center,
where he has taken over with great
enthusiasm. Bob Vaughn has come
up out of the sub spot to take over
MacDfvwell's end, Dwight Smith has
taV/sn over the all-important right
half spot.
It is certain that the Huskies will
be pointing for the Stanford contest
in the middle of the season to avenge
the 20-10 defeat after the Huskies
had led 10-0 at the half. Eight re
turning regulars also make the pic
ture much brighter.
HUSKIES STRONG
All in all, Washington, in the
mind of this observer, has the best
chance of any Pacific Coast Confer
ence team to knock over the In
dians this fall, with the exception
of California, where the dope sheet
is liable to fly out of the window
each year. The schedule favors the
Huskies somewhat, sandwiching the
strong and weak opponents in to
gether pretty well.
Oregon is rated as the best dark
horse entry into the Pacific Coast
Conference picture this year, in spite
of the fact that Tex Oliver lost his
entire starting backfield and six
other Icttermen. In spite of this, the
Webfeet, will be able to field an all-
