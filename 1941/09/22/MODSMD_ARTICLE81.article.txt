# Stanford Golf Team Wins Amateur, N.C.A.A. Titles
## 
### 
After annexing the N.C.A.A. golf team title by 19 strokes as well as
breaking the old record set by the 1939 Stanford team by 21 shots, the
Indian golf team went on through the summer to score a number of
surprising victories in the subsequent amateur tourneys.
The winning team, led by Bud Browncll and Captain Warren Bcrl,

completely outdistanced the field
the Columbus course to gain back
for Coach Eddie Twiggs the title his
team lost last year after holding it
the previous three.
Brownell, Pacific Coast Confer
ence and Northern California ama
teur winner, led the team's individ
ual play throughout the summer. He
went all the way to the finals of the
N.C.A.A. tournament, where he was
defeated by Medalist Earl Stewart
of L.S.U., 4 and 3, after he had re
fused to take a crucial hole offered
him on a penalty.
FINGER MEDALIST RUNNER-UP
Bud Finger, who finished with
second low qualifying score behind
Stewart, and Dee Replogle were the
two men to win the title with Berl
and Brownell. In the match play
Berl and Finger got to the third
round and Replogle to the quarter- j
finals.
The following week, which was !
the first of July, the team went to j
Colorado Springs, where the West
ern Amateur was played on the
Broadmoor course. At the end of
the first day's qualifying Stanford
figured very prominently in the
news since Brownell led with a 70
and Gordon Hough, No. 4 man on
the Card team, tied national amateur
champ Bud Ward for second at 71.
Berl, Finger, Replogle, and Sandy
Tatum weren't far behind. However,
all of the qualifying Stanfordites
were put out of the tourney in the
early rounds.
On the same course a month later
Replogle went all the way to the
semi-finals before being eliminated
in the Broadmoor invitational. Mean
while, Brownell returned to the
Farm to annex the Stanford invita
tional with a victory in the finals
over frosh ace Frank McCann.
STANFORD GRAD SHINES
After faring poorly in the State ;
medal play amateur championships !
at Altadena, Bud returned north to
lead qualifyers in this section for
the National Amateur at Omaha.
Brownell joined Replogle in easily
passing the qualifying rounds, but
the Indians were eliminated quickly
in the match play.
One of the sensations of the Omaha
tourney was Hal Stone Jr., unknown
from Illinois, who graduated from
Stanford in June but wasn't good
enough to make the golf team. Stone
advanced to the quarter-finals.
Brownell's early elimination gave
him time to return to Pebble Beach
for the State match play champion
ships. Brownell, Berl, and George
Traphagen, another ex-frosh star,
| all qualified easily. Brownell was
upset in the quarterfinals by Bob
Gardner, a San Diego State sopho
more, in what may be his last tour
j nament before being inducted into
; the army,
Stanford now hopes Uncle Sam
! does not dip his fingers into the line
| squad.
