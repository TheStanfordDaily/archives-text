# Experts Still Skeptical of 'T'
## 
### 
The night before Messrs. Street
and Smith slapped the cover on
their 1941 Football Pictorial Year
book they must have had a visit
from the ghost of Leland Stanford
because their front cover was
plastered with a toothy picture of
Frankie Albert throwing a foot
ball behind a red jersey (No. 13)
and a pair of shoulder pads, while
the back cover was headed by an
apology to the T-fonnation for un
derestimating its ability by pre
dicting Indian victories in only
four of its nine games.
In the innards of this and every
other pre-season magazine the
men who get paid for knowing
pick Stanford to lead the P.C.C.,
but hint that at least three teams
will probably upset the Indians
this year since Norm Standlee
and Hugh Gallarncau are gone and
since all the other coaches have
caught up with the T-formation.
Although proven wrong once,
the "experts" still doubt that the
Indians play as good football as
they, with their own eyes, have
seen them play.
