# Minnesota Gophers Boast Strong Backs
## 
### 
Minnesota's powerful Gophers,
picked by many as the top team in
the nation this year, boast of one of
the strongest back fields in the Big
Nine. With Bruce Smith running in
the graduated George Franks half
back spot, Bob Sweiger punching
the line, Bill Daley blocking from
right half and Warren Plunkett call
ing the plays, the Gophers have
speed, brawn, and brains.
