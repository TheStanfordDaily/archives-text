# Net Aces Win Summer Tilts
## Schroeder Stars On Forest Hills Courts 
### 
Climaxed by Ted Schroeder's
terrific battle with national cham
pion Bobby Itiggs in the semi-finals
of the Forrest Hills tourney early in
; September, Stanford's tennis play
ers' summer season could be called
more than successful even after
Jimmy Wade and Larry Dee lost
their intercollegiate doubles cham
pionship.
Schroeder rallied valiantly in the
fourth set of his match with Riggs,
but was finally eliminated from the
national championship play in the
fifth set. The score was 6-4, 6-4,
1-6, 9-11, 7-5 for Riggs. This match
showed admirably the improvement
made by Schroeder during the sum
mer when he advanced from his
tenth ranked position up into the
big four.
DEE, WADE LOSE
Dee and Wade, who upset the top
seeded teams of the intercollegiate
matches to take the doubles title as
sophomores, bowed before the even
tual champions, Charles Mattman
and Ted Olewine of U.S.C., in the
semi-final round at Haverford, Penn.,
in June. However, the Lndian duo
went on to win the Southern clay
courts title as well as being run
ners-up in several other major tour
naments before returning to the
Coast in August. In the Southern
matches Dee and Wade defeated
Frankie Parker and Don McNeil,
one of the country's top doubles
combinations, in a grueling five-set
match.
DEE WINS PAIR
Doe fared well in his singles
matches, winning the Minnesota
State title on his way west and the
Pebble Beach Racquet Club tourney
after he arrived.
For the second consecutive year
Schroeder teamed with Jack Kra
mer of Rollins College to take the
national doubles crown. The col
legians defeated Wayne Sabin and
Gardner Mulloy in the final in four
sets. Only one defeat was adminis
tered Schroeder and Kramer in all
of the summer's matches during
which time they won about a dozen
titles.
To prove that he didn't need Kra
mer as a partner in his doubles vic
tories, Schroeder swept the South
ampton invitational doubles field in
competition with Mulloy. They de
feated two ex-Davis Cup aces, Sid
ney Wood and Ladislav Hecht, in
the finals.
Schroeder reached the finals in
two of the lour big grass court
events of the season, being eliminat
ed in the semi-finals of the other
two. He holds victories over Mc-
Neil, Parker, Sabin, Mulloy, and
Bitsy Grant, all of whom are among
the nation's first ten players.
INDIANS TAKE TITLES
Meanwhile in the Pacific North
west Emery Neale and Jack Gur
ley were upholding the name of
Stanford admirably, Neale won
three of the five major tournaments
in that region, while he and Gurley
combined to annex three of the
doubles titles. In two tourneys Nealo
was playing in the finals of the sin
gles, doubles, and mixed doubles on
the same afternoon, a feat which
caused him to collapse in Vancouver. !
Playing against such men as Hank
Prusoff, Hal Wagner, and Ronnie
English, Neale established himself as i
the outstanding player in that cir
cuit.
Although put out in the early
rounds of the singles play in the i
Santa Monica annual tennis cham
pionships, Wade and Charley Hutch
ison, inconsistent Card junior, paired
to reach the finals of the doubles;
division only to be defeated by Wil- ;
lis Anderson, national public parks ;
champ, and Carl Earn, unorthodox
southpaw, in four sets.

of the Forrest Hills tourney early in
; September, Stanford's tennis play
ers' summer season could be called
more than successful even after
Jimmy Wade and Larry Dee lost
their intercollegiate doubles cham
pionship.
Schroeder rallied valiantly in the
fourth set of his match with Riggs,
but was finally eliminated from the
national championship play in the
fifth set. The score was 6-4, 6-4,
1-6, 9-11, 7-5 for Riggs. This match
showed admirably the improvement
made by Schroeder during the sum
mer when he advanced from his
tenth ranked position up into the
big four.
DEE, WADE LOSE
Dee and Wade, who upset the top
seeded teams of the intercollegiate
matches to take the doubles title as
sophomores, bowed before the even
tual champions, Charles Mattman
and Ted Olewine of U.S.C., in the
semi-final round at Haverford, Penn.,
in June. However, the Lndian duo
went on to win the Southern clay
courts title as well as being run
ners-up in several other major tour
naments before returning to the
Coast in August. In the Southern
matches Dee and Wade defeated
Frankie Parker and Don McNeil,
one of the country's top doubles
combinations, in a grueling five-set
match.
DEE WINS PAIR
Doe fared well in his singles
matches, winning the Minnesota
State title on his way west and the
Pebble Beach Racquet Club tourney
after he arrived.
For the second consecutive year
Schroeder teamed with Jack Kra
mer of Rollins College to take the
national doubles crown. The col
legians defeated Wayne Sabin and
Gardner Mulloy in the final in four
sets. Only one defeat was adminis
tered Schroeder and Kramer in all
of the summer's matches during
which time they won about a dozen
titles.
To prove that he didn't need Kra
mer as a partner in his doubles vic
tories, Schroeder swept the South
ampton invitational doubles field in
competition with Mulloy. They de
feated two ex-Davis Cup aces, Sid
ney Wood and Ladislav Hecht, in
the finals.
Schroeder reached the finals in
two of the lour big grass court
events of the season, being eliminat
ed in the semi-finals of the other
two. He holds victories over Mc-
Neil, Parker, Sabin, Mulloy, and
Bitsy Grant, all of whom are among
the nation's first ten players.
