# Net Aces Win Summer Tilts
## Schroeder Stars On Forest Hills Courts 
### 
Climaxed by Ted Schroeder's
terrific battle with national cham
pion Bobby Itiggs in the semi-finals
of the Forrest Hills tourney early in
; September, Stanford's tennis play
ers' summer season could be called
more than successful even after
Jimmy Wade and Larry Dee lost
their intercollegiate doubles cham
pionship.
Schroeder rallied valiantly in the
fourth set of his match with Riggs,
but was finally eliminated from the
national championship play in the
fifth set. The score was 6-4, 6-4,
1-6, 9-11, 7-5 for Riggs. This match

combinations, in a grueling five-set
match.
DEE WINS PAIR
Doe fared well in his singles
matches, winning the Minnesota
State title on his way west and the
Pebble Beach Racquet Club tourney
after he arrived.
For the second consecutive year
Schroeder teamed with Jack Kra
mer of Rollins College to take the
national doubles crown. The col
legians defeated Wayne Sabin and
Gardner Mulloy in the final in four
sets. Only one defeat was adminis
tered Schroeder and Kramer in all
of the summer's matches during
which time they won about a dozen
titles.
To prove that he didn't need Kra
mer as a partner in his doubles vic
tories, Schroeder swept the South
ampton invitational doubles field in
competition with Mulloy. They de
