# Season's First Game Worries Card Headman
## Shaughnessy Figures Oregon's Returning Lettermen Powerful 
### 
"What game am I most worried
about? I guess that would be our
opener with the University of Ore
gon on the 27th of this month. Three
weeks isn't long to get read to play
a team that good."
It was the head man of Stanford's
football fortunes bearing out the
statements made by veteran sports
writers that he was strictly a game
to-game worrier, and not given to
tearing his hair out over games be
fore they came into sight over the
gridiron horizon.
The pre-season dope seems to bear
out a great deal of the trouble that
Coach Shaughnessy has conjured out
of the Webfoot contest. Twenty re
turning lettermen, nineteen good
soph prospects, and the transfer of
three "Athertonized" players from
other PCC institutions has made the
picture at Eugene much brighter
than it was at this time last year.
FOUR FROSII OUT
On the other side of the Webfoot
fence is the fact that four highly
touted freshmen were cut out of the
picture by the PCC "purge" last
spring, the fact that the entire start
ing backfield of last year's cam
paign graduated, and the rather
gloomy prospect of 22 men with low
draft numbers.
Oregon sportswriters are building
6-foot, 5-inch 225-pound Elliot Wil
son up as an all-Coast center pros
pect, and in spite of their well-meant
enthusiasm, it is certain that Tex
Oliver will lack no strength at the
pivot position. Guards appear to be
equally strong with both regulars
returning to the gridiron wars. All-
Coast Jim Stuart is gone from the
left tackle spot, but a capable re
serve with a year of experience un
der his belt, Ed Moshofsky, is re
turning and should be able to fill
the bill.
GRAB BAG OLIVER
Dick Ashcomb, sub last year, re
turns to the right tackle spot, and is
counted on to fill the shoes of the
graduated Rog Johnson, while Hymie
Harris and Bill Regner, both regu
lars in former campaigns, will more
than amply take care of the two end
positions.
Oliver has reached into the grab
bag and pulled a former fullback
who spent some time at center last
fall out into the limelight at quarter
back, an almost altogether blocking
position in the Webfoot system, in
Duke Iverson. Boyd Frank, the best
man who never played last season,
will handle the main ballcarrying
duties at left half and Curly Mee
cham will take over at right half.
JAYSEE TRANSFER
Bill Dunlap, Menlo Junior College
transfer, will probably be given the
starting call at the fullback spot, but
will have to be on his toes to keep
a jump ahead of Jimmy Newquist,
soph sensation.
Man for man, the Webfoot look
a little stronger than Stanford at
the left end, right guard and right
half spots. A wcll-balanced team,
though, and Coach Shaughnessy"s
fears are founded a great deal on
the psychological fact that every
team on the coast will be trying to
knock over the Indians this fall.
