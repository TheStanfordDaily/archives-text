# Cards Hit Farm For First "T" Party
## Palmer's Loss Big Blow To Indian Grid Hopes; 70 Report for Practice Francis Expected to Take Veteran Guard's Place in Line; Norberg, Meiners, Laverty Vie for End Spot 
### BOB CHANDLER 
The few visitors who have hecn able to get through the guarded gale
into the secret practice field where Stanford's Indians have been working
out since Sept. (J have been mystified at the queer goings-on inside.
Practice after the first day has been limited to workouts in shorts,
with the squad split up into several groups working under the different

.coaches. Backs were split into
three groups, with the left halves,
fullbacks and right halves each
working with a quarterback on the
complicated maneuvers of the "I"'
formation.
Linemen were working out with
Phil Bengtson in one corner of the
big field, while Jim Lawson sent
the ends through their paces in an
other place. The last half hour of
the practice was devoted to working
out the different teams together in
a dummy scrimmage.
Unexpected loss of one regular
will force the head man of the In
dians' football fortunes to search for
another right guard to take the
place of big Dick Palmer, defensive
signal caller during the 1940 season
and second only to All-American
Frankie Albert in amount of time
played during the last campaign.
BIG HANK
The rest of the Redskin line will
shape up pretty much as they did at
the end of the spring practice ses
sion last year, with big Hank Nor
berg at the left end position in place
of graduated regular Stan Graff and
with Jack Francis probably in Pal
mer's right guard spot.
Norberg should have little difll
culty in filling Graff's shoes if he
can keep away from the injury jinx
which has plagued him since the
start of his Stanford career. Stand
ing 6 feet 2 inches in his stocking
feet and weighing 224 pounds, Nor
berg is the ideal size for an end
under the 'T" formation.
Norberg is by no means cinched
for the spot, for he will have to con
tend with Arnie Meiners and Roger
Laverty for the position.
STAMM AT TACKLE
Regular Ed Stamm will return to
his left tackle positioin, but the
squad will lose the services of Jack
Warnecke, last season's first sub.
Big, very powerful and fast for his
220 pounds, "Big Ed" improved all
during the 1940 season and came into
the height of his glory in making a
successful one-man goal line stand
in the Big Game last year.
First sub under Stamm will prob
ably be Bob Millington, a big junior
who only saw three minutes' action
last year. Ed "Swede" Johannessen
will return after a year's layoff.
The surprise package of the 1940
season, Chuck Taylor, will return to
the left guard spot, making it one of
the strongest on the team. Rated by
Clark Shaughnessy as the "man most
likely to succeed" in his bid for Ail-
American honors this season, Chuck
will have some stiff competition from
both Ken Robesky and Dave Patter
son, both lettermen at the position.
VETERAN CENTERS
Another man who will be making
a strong bid for All-America hon
ors is returning center Vic Lindskog,
rated only behind Rudy Mucha of
Washington on the Coast last year.
When the dust of the Indian-Husky
fracas had cleared away last year, it
was the opinion of many of the
game's observers that Lindskog had
outplayed Mucha.
Bucking up Lindskog is Doug
Stahle, a man good enough to play
first string on any team on the
Coast, with the exception of Stan
lord. Filling in for injured Lindskog
in the UCLA and Big Game con
tests last year, Doug proved himself
to be a more than adequate reserve.
Loren LaPrade, up from last year's
frosh, was rated as the outstanding
Stanford center prospect since the
days of Wes Muller on the Vow
Boys.
GUARDS STRONG
Jack Francis will probably take
over the right guard position left
vacant by the failure of the 1940
regular, Dick Palmer, to return to
school this fall. Francis will be re
membered as the man who brought
down California's Hoberg after a
59-yard chase and a great bit of
defensive playing by Ail-American
Frankie Albert in last year's Big
Game. Ed McCain, husky Okla
homan, will start the season as first
substitute.
Back for his second year of var
sity competition after making a fine
showing his first time out, Bruno
Banducci will undoubtedly get the
starting call at right tackle for the
opening contest with Oregon.
One of the finest ends on the
Coast, if not the whole country,
will return for another season in the
person of Freddy Meyer, rangy Ok
lahoman and regular right end last
year. Meyer is very powerful on
defense and is also one of the best
pass receivers on the Coast. Bill
Symes and Bill Brubaker, junior
and sophomore respectively, will not
be able to furnish much competition
to Meyer, but will both improve
with some much-needed experience.
ALBERT RETURNS
Little Frankie Albert, rated as the
finest field general in Stanford his
tory and picked on nearly every
All-American team last fall, will re
turn for his last year of competition
and will again provide the spark for
the team from his quarterback spot.
A truly great passer and kicker,
Albert has it all over the rest of the
men trying out for the position, and
should again play more minutes

than any other man on the team.
Ray Hammett, first sub last year,
will again be back, and three pros
pects are coming up from the 1940
freshman aggregation.
"Perfect Pete" Kmetovic, the
Coast's leading scorer last season,
will again return to his left halfback
position. 'Kmet' will attempt to put
himself on the list with other Stan
ford football greats who have made
All-American honors for themselves.
Kmetovic averaged 6.8 yards per
carry last season against the tough
est of competition. A1 Cole and Bob
Ditlevsen are also good breakaway
threats and will undoubtedly see
some action this season.
ARMSTRONG AT HALF
Many observers rate the right
halfback spot, left vacant by the
graduation of the great Hugh Gal
larneau, to be the greatest problem
that Shaughnessy and his capable
backfield coach, Marchie Schwartz,
will have to face during the coming
season.
At the first call it will probably be
Eric Armstrong, little junior from
Portland, who will fill the bill, but
he will have to work hard to keep
ahead of Buck Fawcett, frosh full
back in 1940, who is quite a bit big
ger and a little faster than Arm
strong.
The loss of Norm Standlee at full
back will not be as great as it seems
at first glance, although the "Ath
ertonizing" of Bob Koch has un
doubtedly been a big blow to this
season's Indian team. Milt Vucinich
did a good job of filling in for the

"Chief" during the Washington and
Oregon State contests last year and
will return for another season, as
will Bob Crane, the surprise package
of the Rose Bowl game. Milt has
the call at the first of the season, hut
Crane may take it away from him at
any time.

Clark Shaughnessy as the "man most
likely to succeed" in his bid for Ail-
American honors this season, Chuck
will have some stiff competition from
both Ken Robesky and Dave Patter
son, both lettermen at the position.
VETERAN CENTERS
Another man who will be making
a strong bid for All-America hon
ors is returning center Vic Lindskog,
rated only behind Rudy Mucha of
Washington on the Coast last year.
When the dust of the Indian-Husky
fracas had cleared away last year, it
was the opinion of many of the
game's observers that Lindskog had
outplayed Mucha.
Bucking up Lindskog is Doug
Stahle, a man good enough to play
first string on any team on the
Coast, with the exception of Stan
lord. Filling in for injured Lindskog
in the UCLA and Big Game con
tests last year, Doug proved himself
to be a more than adequate reserve.
Loren LaPrade, up from last year's
frosh, was rated as the outstanding
Stanford center prospect since the
days of Wes Muller on the Vow
Boys.
GUARDS STRONG
Jack Francis will probably take
over the right guard position left
vacant by the failure of the 1940
regular, Dick Palmer, to return to
school this fall. Francis will be re
membered as the man who brought
down California's Hoberg after a
59-yard chase and a great bit of
defensive playing by Ail-American
Frankie Albert in last year's Big
Game. Ed McCain, husky Okla
homan, will start the season as first
substitute.
Back for his second year of var
sity competition after making a fine
showing his first time out, Bruno
Banducci will undoubtedly get the
starting call at right tackle for the
opening contest with Oregon.
One of the finest ends on the
Coast, if not the whole country,
will return for another season in the
person of Freddy Meyer, rangy Ok
lahoman and regular right end last
year. Meyer is very powerful on
defense and is also one of the best
pass receivers on the Coast. Bill
Symes and Bill Brubaker, junior
and sophomore respectively, will not
be able to furnish much competition
to Meyer, but will both improve
with some much-needed experience.
ALBERT RETURNS
Little Frankie Albert, rated as the
finest field general in Stanford his
tory and picked on nearly every
All-American team last fall, will re
turn for his last year of competition
and will again provide the spark for
the team from his quarterback spot.
A truly great passer and kicker,
Albert has it all over the rest of the
men trying out for the position, and
should again play more minutes

than any other man on the team.
Ray Hammett, first sub last year,
will again be back, and three pros
pects are coming up from the 1940
freshman aggregation.
"Perfect Pete" Kmetovic, the
Coast's leading scorer last season,
will again return to his left halfback
position. 'Kmet' will attempt to put
himself on the list with other Stan
ford football greats who have made
All-American honors for themselves.
Kmetovic averaged 6.8 yards per
carry last season against the tough
est of competition. A1 Cole and Bob
Ditlevsen are also good breakaway
threats and will undoubtedly see
some action this season.
ARMSTRONG AT HALF
Many observers rate the right
halfback spot, left vacant by the
graduation of the great Hugh Gal
larneau, to be the greatest problem
that Shaughnessy and his capable
backfield coach, Marchie Schwartz,
will have to face during the coming
season.
At the first call it will probably be
Eric Armstrong, little junior from
Portland, who will fill the bill, but
he will have to work hard to keep
ahead of Buck Fawcett, frosh full
back in 1940, who is quite a bit big
ger and a little faster than Arm
strong.
The loss of Norm Standlee at full
back will not be as great as it seems
at first glance, although the "Ath
ertonizing" of Bob Koch has un
doubtedly been a big blow to this
season's Indian team. Milt Vucinich
did a good job of filling in for the

"Chief" during the Washington and
Oregon State contests last year and
will return for another season, as
will Bob Crane, the surprise package
of the Rose Bowl game. Milt has
the call at the first of the season, hut
Crane may take it away from him at
any time.
The few visitors who have hecn able to get through the guarded gale
into the secret practice field where Stanford's Indians have been working
out since Sept. (J have been mystified at the queer goings-on inside.
Practice after the first day has been limited to workouts in shorts,
with the squad split up into several groups working under the different

.coaches. Backs were split into
three groups, with the left halves,
fullbacks and right halves each
working with a quarterback on the
complicated maneuvers of the "I"'
formation.
Linemen were working out with
Phil Bengtson in one corner of the
big field, while Jim Lawson sent
the ends through their paces in an
other place. The last half hour of
the practice was devoted to working
out the different teams together in
a dummy scrimmage.
Unexpected loss of one regular
will force the head man of the In
dians' football fortunes to search for
another right guard to take the
place of big Dick Palmer, defensive
signal caller during the 1940 season
and second only to All-American
Frankie Albert in amount of time
played during the last campaign.
BIG HANK
The rest of the Redskin line will
shape up pretty much as they did at
the end of the spring practice ses
sion last year, with big Hank Nor
berg at the left end position in place
of graduated regular Stan Graff and
with Jack Francis probably in Pal
mer's right guard spot.
Norberg should have little difll
culty in filling Graff's shoes if he
can keep away from the injury jinx
which has plagued him since the
start of his Stanford career. Stand
ing 6 feet 2 inches in his stocking
feet and weighing 224 pounds, Nor
berg is the ideal size for an end
under the 'T" formation.
Norberg is by no means cinched
for the spot, for he will have to con
tend with Arnie Meiners and Roger
Laverty for the position.
STAMM AT TACKLE
Regular Ed Stamm will return to
his left tackle positioin, but the
squad will lose the services of Jack
Warnecke, last season's first sub.
Big, very powerful and fast for his
220 pounds, "Big Ed" improved all
during the 1940 season and came into
the height of his glory in making a
successful one-man goal line stand
in the Big Game last year.
First sub under Stamm will prob
ably be Bob Millington, a big junior
who only saw three minutes' action
last year. Ed "Swede" Johannessen
will return after a year's layoff.
The surprise package of the 1940
season, Chuck Taylor, will return to
the left guard spot, making it one of
the strongest on the team. Rated by
Clark Shaughnessy as the "man most
likely to succeed" in his bid for Ail-

will again return to his left halfback
position. 'Kmet' will attempt to put
himself on the list with other Stan
ford football greats who have made
All-American honors for themselves.
Kmetovic averaged 6.8 yards per
carry last season against the tough
est of competition. A1 Cole and Bob
Ditlevsen are also good breakaway
threats and will undoubtedly see
some action this season.
ARMSTRONG AT HALF
Many observers rate the right
halfback spot, left vacant by the
graduation of the great Hugh Gal
larneau, to be the greatest problem
that Shaughnessy and his capable
backfield coach, Marchie Schwartz,
will have to face during the coming
season.
At the first call it will probably be
Eric Armstrong, little junior from
Portland, who will fill the bill, but
he will have to work hard to keep
ahead of Buck Fawcett, frosh full
back in 1940, who is quite a bit big
ger and a little faster than Arm
strong.
The loss of Norm Standlee at full
back will not be as great as it seems
at first glance, although the "Ath
ertonizing" of Bob Koch has un
doubtedly been a big blow to this
season's Indian team. Milt Vucinich
did a good job of filling in for the

"Chief" during the Washington and
Oregon State contests last year and
will return for another season, as
will Bob Crane, the surprise package
of the Rose Bowl game. Milt has
the call at the first of the season, hut
Crane may take it away from him at
any time.
The few visitors who have hecn able to get through the guarded gale
into the secret practice field where Stanford's Indians have been working
out since Sept. (J have been mystified at the queer goings-on inside.
Practice after the first day has been limited to workouts in shorts,
with the squad split up into several groups working under the different

.coaches. Backs were split into
three groups, with the left halves,
fullbacks and right halves each
working with a quarterback on the
complicated maneuvers of the "I"'
formation.
Linemen were working out with
Phil Bengtson in one corner of the
big field, while Jim Lawson sent
the ends through their paces in an
other place. The last half hour of
the practice was devoted to working
out the different teams together in
a dummy scrimmage.
Unexpected loss of one regular
will force the head man of the In
dians' football fortunes to search for
another right guard to take the
place of big Dick Palmer, defensive
signal caller during the 1940 season
and second only to All-American
Frankie Albert in amount of time
played during the last campaign.
BIG HANK
The rest of the Redskin line will
shape up pretty much as they did at
the end of the spring practice ses
sion last year, with big Hank Nor
berg at the left end position in place
of graduated regular Stan Graff and
with Jack Francis probably in Pal
mer's right guard spot.
Norberg should have little difll
culty in filling Graff's shoes if he
can keep away from the injury jinx
which has plagued him since the
start of his Stanford career. Stand
ing 6 feet 2 inches in his stocking
feet and weighing 224 pounds, Nor
berg is the ideal size for an end
under the 'T" formation.
Norberg is by no means cinched
for the spot, for he will have to con
tend with Arnie Meiners and Roger
Laverty for the position.
STAMM AT TACKLE
Regular Ed Stamm will return to
his left tackle positioin, but the
squad will lose the services of Jack
Warnecke, last season's first sub.
Big, very powerful and fast for his
220 pounds, "Big Ed" improved all
during the 1940 season and came into
the height of his glory in making a
successful one-man goal line stand
in the Big Game last year.
First sub under Stamm will prob
ably be Bob Millington, a big junior
who only saw three minutes' action
last year. Ed "Swede" Johannessen
will return after a year's layoff.
The surprise package of the 1940
season, Chuck Taylor, will return to
the left guard spot, making it one of
the strongest on the team. Rated by
Clark Shaughnessy as the "man most
likely to succeed" in his bid for Ail-
American honors this season, Chuck
will have some stiff competition from
both Ken Robesky and Dave Patter
son, both lettermen at the position.
VETERAN CENTERS
Another man who will be making
a strong bid for All-America hon
ors is returning center Vic Lindskog,
rated only behind Rudy Mucha of
Washington on the Coast last year.
When the dust of the Indian-Husky
fracas had cleared away last year, it
was the opinion of many of the
game's observers that Lindskog had
outplayed Mucha.
Bucking up Lindskog is Doug
Stahle, a man good enough to play
first string on any team on the
Coast, with the exception of Stan
lord. Filling in for injured Lindskog
in the UCLA and Big Game con
tests last year, Doug proved himself
to be a more than adequate reserve.
Loren LaPrade, up from last year's
frosh, was rated as the outstanding
Stanford center prospect since the
days of Wes Muller on the Vow
Boys.
GUARDS STRONG
Jack Francis will probably take
over the right guard position left
vacant by the failure of the 1940
regular, Dick Palmer, to return to
school this fall. Francis will be re
membered as the man who brought
down California's Hoberg after a
59-yard chase and a great bit of
defensive playing by Ail-American
Frankie Albert in last year's Big
Game. Ed McCain, husky Okla
homan, will start the season as first
substitute.
Back for his second year of var
sity competition after making a fine
showing his first time out, Bruno
Banducci will undoubtedly get the
starting call at right tackle for the
opening contest with Oregon.
One of the finest ends on the
Coast, if not the whole country,
will return for another season in the
person of Freddy Meyer, rangy Ok
lahoman and regular right end last
year. Meyer is very powerful on
defense and is also one of the best
pass receivers on the Coast. Bill
Symes and Bill Brubaker, junior
and sophomore respectively, will not
be able to furnish much competition
to Meyer, but will both improve
with some much-needed experience.
ALBERT RETURNS
Little Frankie Albert, rated as the
finest field general in Stanford his
tory and picked on nearly every
All-American team last fall, will re
turn for his last year of competition
and will again provide the spark for
the team from his quarterback spot.
A truly great passer and kicker,
Albert has it all over the rest of the
men trying out for the position, and
should again play more minutes

than any other man on the team.
Ray Hammett, first sub last year,
will again be back, and three pros
pects are coming up from the 1940
freshman aggregation.
"Perfect Pete" Kmetovic, the
Coast's leading scorer last season,
will again return to his left halfback
position. 'Kmet' will attempt to put
himself on the list with other Stan

men trying out for the position, and
should again play more minutes

than any other man on the team.
Ray Hammett, first sub last year,
will again be back, and three pros
pects are coming up from the 1940
freshman aggregation.
"Perfect Pete" Kmetovic, the
Coast's leading scorer last season,
will again return to his left halfback
position. 'Kmet' will attempt to put
himself on the list with other Stan
ford football greats who have made
All-American honors for themselves.
Kmetovic averaged 6.8 yards per
carry last season against the tough
est of competition. A1 Cole and Bob
Ditlevsen are also good breakaway
threats and will undoubtedly see
some action this season.
ARMSTRONG AT HALF
Many observers rate the right
halfback spot, left vacant by the
graduation of the great Hugh Gal
larneau, to be the greatest problem
that Shaughnessy and his capable
backfield coach, Marchie Schwartz,
will have to face during the coming
season.
At the first call it will probably be
Eric Armstrong, little junior from
Portland, who will fill the bill, but
he will have to work hard to keep
ahead of Buck Fawcett, frosh full
back in 1940, who is quite a bit big
ger and a little faster than Arm
strong.
The loss of Norm Standlee at full
back will not be as great as it seems
at first glance, although the "Ath
ertonizing" of Bob Koch has un
doubtedly been a big blow to this
season's Indian team. Milt Vucinich
did a good job of filling in for the

"Chief" during the Washington and
Oregon State contests last year and
will return for another season, as
will Bob Crane, the surprise package
of the Rose Bowl game. Milt has
the call at the first of the season, hut
Crane may take it away from him at
any time.
was the opinion of many of the
game's observers that Lindskog had
outplayed Mucha.
Bucking up Lindskog is Doug
Stahle, a man good enough to play
first string on any team on the
Coast, with the exception of Stan
lord. Filling in for injured Lindskog
in the UCLA and Big Game con
tests last year, Doug proved himself
to be a more than adequate reserve.
Loren LaPrade, up from last year's
frosh, was rated as the outstanding
Stanford center prospect since the
days of Wes Muller on the Vow
Boys.
GUARDS STRONG
Jack Francis will probably take
over the right guard position left
vacant by the failure of the 1940
regular, Dick Palmer, to return to
school this fall. Francis will be re
membered as the man who brought
down California's Hoberg after a
59-yard chase and a great bit of
defensive playing by Ail-American
Frankie Albert in last year's Big
Game. Ed McCain, husky Okla
homan, will start the season as first
substitute.
Back for his second year of var
sity competition after making a fine
showing his first time out, Bruno
Banducci will undoubtedly get the
starting call at right tackle for the
opening contest with Oregon.
One of the finest ends on the
Coast, if not the whole country,
will return for another season in the
person of Freddy Meyer, rangy Ok
lahoman and regular right end last
year. Meyer is very powerful on
defense and is also one of the best
pass receivers on the Coast. Bill
Symes and Bill Brubaker, junior
and sophomore respectively, will not
be able to furnish much competition
to Meyer, but will both improve
with some much-needed experience.
ALBERT RETURNS
Little Frankie Albert, rated as the
finest field general in Stanford his
tory and picked on nearly every
All-American team last fall, will re
turn for his last year of competition
and will again provide the spark for
the team from his quarterback spot.
A truly great passer and kicker,
Albert has it all over the rest of the
men trying out for the position, and
should again play more minutes

than any other man on the team.
Ray Hammett, first sub last year,

The few visitors who have hecn able to get through the guarded gale
into the secret practice field where Stanford's Indians have been working
out since Sept. (J have been mystified at the queer goings-on inside.
Practice after the first day has been limited to workouts in shorts,
with the squad split up into several groups working under the different

.coaches. Backs were split into
three groups, with the left halves,
fullbacks and right halves each
working with a quarterback on the
complicated maneuvers of the "I"'
formation.
Linemen were working out with
Phil Bengtson in one corner of the
big field, while Jim Lawson sent
the ends through their paces in an
other place. The last half hour of
the practice was devoted to working
out the different teams together in
a dummy scrimmage.
Unexpected loss of one regular
will force the head man of the In
dians' football fortunes to search for
another right guard to take the
place of big Dick Palmer, defensive
signal caller during the 1940 season
and second only to All-American
Frankie Albert in amount of time
played during the last campaign.
BIG HANK
The rest of the Redskin line will
shape up pretty much as they did at
the end of the spring practice ses
sion last year, with big Hank Nor
berg at the left end position in place
of graduated regular Stan Graff and
with Jack Francis probably in Pal
mer's right guard spot.
Norberg should have little difll
culty in filling Graff's shoes if he
can keep away from the injury jinx
which has plagued him since the
start of his Stanford career. Stand
ing 6 feet 2 inches in his stocking
feet and weighing 224 pounds, Nor
berg is the ideal size for an end
under the 'T" formation.
Norberg is by no means cinched
for the spot, for he will have to con
tend with Arnie Meiners and Roger
Laverty for the position.
STAMM AT TACKLE
Regular Ed Stamm will return to
his left tackle positioin, but the
squad will lose the services of Jack
Warnecke, last season's first sub.
Big, very powerful and fast for his
220 pounds, "Big Ed" improved all
during the 1940 season and came into
the height of his glory in making a
successful one-man goal line stand
in the Big Game last year.
First sub under Stamm will prob
ably be Bob Millington, a big junior
who only saw three minutes' action
last year. Ed "Swede" Johannessen
will return after a year's layoff.
The surprise package of the 1940
season, Chuck Taylor, will return to
the left guard spot, making it one of
the strongest on the team. Rated by
Clark Shaughnessy as the "man most
likely to succeed" in his bid for Ail-
American honors this season, Chuck
will have some stiff competition from
both Ken Robesky and Dave Patter
son, both lettermen at the position.
VETERAN CENTERS
Another man who will be making
a strong bid for All-America hon
ors is returning center Vic Lindskog,
rated only behind Rudy Mucha of
Washington on the Coast last year.
When the dust of the Indian-Husky
fracas had cleared away last year, it
was the opinion of many of the

homan, will start the season as first
substitute.
Back for his second year of var
sity competition after making a fine
showing his first time out, Bruno
Banducci will undoubtedly get the
starting call at right tackle for the
opening contest with Oregon.
One of the finest ends on the
Coast, if not the whole country,
will return for another season in the
person of Freddy Meyer, rangy Ok
lahoman and regular right end last
year. Meyer is very powerful on
defense and is also one of the best
pass receivers on the Coast. Bill
Symes and Bill Brubaker, junior
and sophomore respectively, will not
be able to furnish much competition
to Meyer, but will both improve
with some much-needed experience.
ALBERT RETURNS
Little Frankie Albert, rated as the
finest field general in Stanford his
tory and picked on nearly every
All-American team last fall, will re
turn for his last year of competition
and will again provide the spark for
the team from his quarterback spot.
A truly great passer and kicker,
Albert has it all over the rest of the
men trying out for the position, and
should again play more minutes

than any other man on the team.
Ray Hammett, first sub last year,
will again be back, and three pros
pects are coming up from the 1940
freshman aggregation.
"Perfect Pete" Kmetovic, the
Coast's leading scorer last season,
will again return to his left halfback
position. 'Kmet' will attempt to put
himself on the list with other Stan
ford football greats who have made
All-American honors for themselves.
Kmetovic averaged 6.8 yards per
carry last season against the tough
est of competition. A1 Cole and Bob
Ditlevsen are also good breakaway
threats and will undoubtedly see
some action this season.
ARMSTRONG AT HALF
Many observers rate the right
halfback spot, left vacant by the
graduation of the great Hugh Gal
larneau, to be the greatest problem
that Shaughnessy and his capable
backfield coach, Marchie Schwartz,
will have to face during the coming
season.
At the first call it will probably be
Eric Armstrong, little junior from
Portland, who will fill the bill, but
he will have to work hard to keep
ahead of Buck Fawcett, frosh full
back in 1940, who is quite a bit big
ger and a little faster than Arm
strong.
The loss of Norm Standlee at full
back will not be as great as it seems
at first glance, although the "Ath
ertonizing" of Bob Koch has un
doubtedly been a big blow to this
season's Indian team. Milt Vucinich
did a good job of filling in for the

"Chief" during the Washington and
Oregon State contests last year and
will return for another season, as
will Bob Crane, the surprise package
of the Rose Bowl game. Milt has
the call at the first of the season, hut
Crane may take it away from him at
any time.
