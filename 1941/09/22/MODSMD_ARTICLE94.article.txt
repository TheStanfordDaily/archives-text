# Cards Hit Farm For First "T" Party
## Palmer's Loss Big Blow To Indian Grid Hopes; 70 Report for Practice Francis Expected to Take Veteran Guard's Place in Line; Norberg, Meiners, Laverty Vie for End Spot 
### BOB CHANDLER 
The few visitors who have hecn able to get through the guarded gale
into the secret practice field where Stanford's Indians have been working
out since Sept. (J have been mystified at the queer goings-on inside.
Practice after the first day has been limited to workouts in shorts,
with the squad split up into several groups working under the different

.coaches. Backs were split into
three groups, with the left halves,
fullbacks and right halves each
working with a quarterback on the
complicated maneuvers of the "I"'
formation.
Linemen were working out with
Phil Bengtson in one corner of the
big field, while Jim Lawson sent
the ends through their paces in an
other place. The last half hour of
the practice was devoted to working
out the different teams together in
a dummy scrimmage.
Unexpected loss of one regular
will force the head man of the In
dians' football fortunes to search for
another right guard to take the
place of big Dick Palmer, defensive
signal caller during the 1940 season
and second only to All-American
Frankie Albert in amount of time
played during the last campaign.
BIG HANK
The rest of the Redskin line will
shape up pretty much as they did at
the end of the spring practice ses
sion last year, with big Hank Nor
berg at the left end position in place
of graduated regular Stan Graff and
with Jack Francis probably in Pal
mer's right guard spot.
Norberg should have little difll
culty in filling Graff's shoes if he
can keep away from the injury jinx
which has plagued him since the
start of his Stanford career. Stand
ing 6 feet 2 inches in his stocking
feet and weighing 224 pounds, Nor
berg is the ideal size for an end
under the 'T" formation.
Norberg is by no means cinched
for the spot, for he will have to con
tend with Arnie Meiners and Roger
Laverty for the position.
STAMM AT TACKLE
Regular Ed Stamm will return to
his left tackle positioin, but the
squad will lose the services of Jack
Warnecke, last season's first sub.
Big, very powerful and fast for his
220 pounds, "Big Ed" improved all
during the 1940 season and came into
the height of his glory in making a
successful one-man goal line stand
in the Big Game last year.
First sub under Stamm will prob
ably be Bob Millington, a big junior
who only saw three minutes' action
last year. Ed "Swede" Johannessen
will return after a year's layoff.
The surprise package of the 1940
season, Chuck Taylor, will return to
the left guard spot, making it one of
the strongest on the team. Rated by
Clark Shaughnessy as the "man most
likely to succeed" in his bid for Ail-
American honors this season, Chuck
will have some stiff competition from
both Ken Robesky and Dave Patter
son, both lettermen at the position.
VETERAN CENTERS
Another man who will be making
a strong bid for All-America hon
ors is returning center Vic Lindskog,
rated only behind Rudy Mucha of
Washington on the Coast last year.
When the dust of the Indian-Husky
fracas had cleared away last year, it
