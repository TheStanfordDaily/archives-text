# Autumn's Hero Rides Unknown
## 
### BUD AMES 
Aboard The Daylight Streamliner
En Route to San Francisco.—The
door at the far end of the swaying
chair-car swung open, and down the
aisle moved a tall man in a neat
blue serge suit. I watched the faces
of the other passengers as he moved
up the aisle.
Several glanced up, but their
eyes returned to their magazines or
Sunday newspapers without a sec
ond glance. There were no sidelong
glances, no whispered words.
The man in the aisle? Coach
Clark Shaughnessy.
Everybody has heard of him. As a
result of his gridiron achievements
last fall, he was named last year's
Coach of the Year. He has spoken
to millions over the radio. His foot
ball strategy has thrilled thousands.
But there were no sidelong glances,
no whispered words.
The tall man in the neat blue
serge suit passed unoticed through
the car. The djor at the other end
of the car clicked shut behind him.

Again the door swung open and
out of the dining car paraded more
Ail-Americans than you could shake
a stick at. Phil Bengtson, Bones
Hamilton, Marchie Schwartz, and
behind them came the rest of the
Shaughnessy council of war, Don
Liebendorfer, A1 Masters, and
Husky Hunt.
Marchie stopped a moment to chat.
"Things don't look so good," he
mused. "Take a look at that sched
ule. All our tough games at the
start of the season. That doesn't ex
actly make me happy."
"Having a nice ride home,
Marchie?"'
"Working. You know that
Shaughnessy is working all the time.
Ever since we got on, he'd had us all
back in the drawing room discussing
plays and such. He never gets tired.
Well, see you later."
* ♦ *
He nearly didn't. At San Jose,
Marchie got lost loking for his suit
case, and almost missed the local out
of San Jose for Palo Alto.
As the train drew out of San Jose,
all began to feel Stanford's near
ness. You should have heard Husky
Hunt imitating the engine and
whistling madly for the crossings.
