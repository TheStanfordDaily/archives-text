The custom of compulsory class
attendance originated at Harvard.
Compulsory class attendance—one
of the less delightful of college cus
toms was inspired by the activities
of a group of Harvard students many
years ago.
It seems this group of Harvardites
rof involved in a little trouble in
Cuba when their parents thought
tiny were in classrooms in the
United States. Thus, professors
tailed requiring class attendance to
i liminate such extensive cutting.
