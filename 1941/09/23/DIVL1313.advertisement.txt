THIS YOUR FIRST QUARTER?
It's our 121 st!
We haven't been here as long as Encina Hal!—but con
siderably longer than the Stadium and Hoover Library.
So we are sort of a Stanford landmark. Our place is at
134 University Avenue—right across from Wilson's.
And in our 30 years of watching Stanford grow and changc,
we've been happy to serve class after class of students.
Likely some of your parents remember the University
Pharmacy.
We've kept pace with the changing Stanford, but we, too.
are fundamentally the same. Our staff of experienced
pharmacists is the largest in Palo Alto . . . our drug prod
ucts and health supplies all bear nationally-known names
. . . our free delivery service is at your call from 8 a.m.
to 9 p.m.
We wish you best of luck—and best of health.
