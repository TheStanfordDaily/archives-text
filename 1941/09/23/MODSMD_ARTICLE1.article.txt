### AMIE REICHERT 
Vk/'ITH every inch of Russian soil—
though it be scorched and bloody
that falls to the Nazis, Japan's sun
rises a little higher. One more great
German victory—like Kiev—and it
may reach its zenith.
The Japanese last week celebrated
the tenth anniversary of their in
vasion of Manchuria. They clapped
their pudgy little hands and glee
fully announced to the world, Look
ie, lookie at all this war and de
struction and bloodshed. Look at it!
Gentlemen, we can not tell a lie. Wc
did it. We started the whole thing
ten years ago. All by ourselves. And
we're glad, glad, glad!
There followed a pronuncia
mento from one of Tokyo's swag
gering, cork-helmeted big-wigs to
the effect that Japan reaffirms her
determination to establish her
New Order in Asia, and the time
is now.
Well, there is of course nothing
new in that statement. It has be
come about as hackneyed as Herr
Hitler's old standby, "Germany must
have her place in the sun." But last
week Tokyo's timing lent a deeper
significance to the now-familiar
words.

B AST week Germany was smash-
J ing triumphantly through the
southern defenses of Marshall Bu
lenny in the Ukraine, Leningrad
was reported in flames while the in
vaders hammered at her gates, and
Nazi Navy Chief Raeder was fineg
eling with Italy and Bulgaria in
order to tuck away an Axis fleet in
the Baltic.
The collapse of the bastions of
Kiev docs not mean that Russian re
sistance is shattered or Russian in
dustry paralyzed. But when the
Soviet suffers a blow that will mean
these things—that is the moment
Japan will seize to go into action.
That will be her cue to pull a Musso
lini and stab her neighbor in the
back.
As long as the Axis remains on
top, there seems to be little chance
of a Japanese about-face in for
eign policy. Japan has her little
heart set on that New Order, and
to renege now would mean loss of
face—which in the Orient Is even
worse than breaking the Honor
Code.
Despite recent conferences be
tween Japanese Ambassador No
mura and President Roosevelt, the
"experts" see little hope that the
black clouds in the Pacific will dis
solve Into a rosy after-glow.
Japan—by her words, actions,
and. in her opinion, by her best
interests —is committed to a policy
of expansion to the eternal regret
of all Asia. She can't gracefully
back clear out of China, and the
U.S. won't be satisfied until she
does.
She can not and will not bow out
of Indo-China. which was a gift
from Messrs. Petain, Darlan, Laval.
That simply would not be polite,
and the Japanese are the politest
people in the world. Besides the
Indo-China coup was enormously
oopular with the people at home,
vho are on the whole a somewhat
ar-wcary, unenthusiastic bunch of
patriots.

CO IT may soon be war in the
Pacific, since peace with honor—
for the Japnnc.se at least—is an im
possibility. And when Der Fuehrer
has the Bear down and the count is
!), then the Japs will be up and at
'em.
One thing is certain. If Japan is to
wage a war this year it has to be a
quickie. With 45 per cent of her
imported oil supplies tied up by
Great Britain, the U.S. and the Neth
erlands Indies, Tokyo hasn't too
much time to fool around. It had
better be a blitz. But quick!
