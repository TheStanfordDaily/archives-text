# Third Film of "Dr. Jekyll' Is Hollywood's Best Yet
## 
### 
"DOCTOR JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE," starring Spncer Tracy,
Turner, and Ingrkl Bergman, now showing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
The third filming of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel is probahly Holly
wood's best. With two of filmdom's more sincere stars, Spencer Tracy
and Ingrid Bergman, in the main roles the picture is much closer to the

effect produced by the thrilling"
story than its predecessors.
The story concerns a young so
ciety doctor, portrayed by Tracy,
who succeeds in separating the
good and evil in himself by the use
of a drug,
STARS TURNER, BERGMAN
Female representations of the doc
tor's good and evil ways are the two
women in his life, played by Lana
Turner and Ingrid Bergman. Good
and evil respectively.
Ingrid Bergman, at first thought to
be horribly miscast, turns in the
best performance of the picture.
Spencer Tracy, always excellent,
suffered at times from too much
meddling at the hands of tech
nicians.
NEW IDEA A SUCCESS
Big surprise of the picture is the
hitherto unattempted idea of pictur
ing of the mind of Dr. Jekyll as he
changes into Mr. Hyde. This is
beautifully done by a changing mon
tage of Bergman and Turner inter
mingled with various Freudian
symbols. Said to be drastically cut
by the Hays office, this sequence still
remians the high spot of the picture.
The second feature is a military
"Dead End Kid" drama with Bonita
Granville. Time it so you miss it.
