# Lighter, Faster Papoose Football Squad Prepares For Tough 1941 Schedule
## Frosh Team to Meet Three Strong Junior College Elevens, California, UCLA and USC, in This Year's Wars 
### 
"We won't be as heavy as we were last year, but at the present time
it looks like we'll be quite a bit faster," said Harry Shipkey as he
summed up the chances for the Class of '45 s representatives in this fall s
grid wars.
Kliinkcv has linen working out his chartres since September 8, in prepa-

ration for a schedule that includes,
three of the toughest junior college
teams in the state, as well as the
intercollegiate games with the frosh
teams of Cal, U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
FIGIIT FOR END JOB
The left end job is a wide open
fight between Dave Brown, former
member of the highly-touted Pied
mont High squad of last season, and
Pole August, 175-pound product of
Whittier. A hundred and ninety
five-pound Bill Young of Fresno has
sewed up the left tackle job pretty
well, but a good fight is being waged
for the left guard position between
Jim Cowin of Minneapolis and Bill
Sigurdson of Portland. Seattle's
Jim McCurdy has done good
enough work at the center position
to rate the opening call for the
Bakersfield J. C. tilt.
A New Jersey boy named Jack
Sogorka seems to have earned the
starting call at the key right guard
spot, while Harvey Bernhard will
take over the right tackle position.
Jack Heald of Billings, 'Mont., and
former All-State selection, will hold
down the left end position.
FIGHT IN BACKFIELD
A wide open fight has developed in
the backfield, with at least three
men in the thick of the running for
every position. Andrews, Parkinson
and CafTal are trying to cinch the
quarterback spot under the T for
mation that the frosh will use this
year, while Zappatini, Parsons and
Sanderman are all in there fighting
for the left half opener.
Pettit, Ullman and Dana are the
leading candidates for the right half
position, with Dave Pate, Clem
Woods and Rus Oplinger trying to
cinch down the fullback assignment.

Sigurdson of Portland. Seattle's
Jim McCurdy has done good
enough work at the center position
to rate the opening call for the
Bakersfield J. C. tilt.
A New Jersey boy named Jack
Sogorka seems to have earned the
starting call at the key right guard
spot, while Harvey Bernhard will
take over the right tackle position.
Jack Heald of Billings, 'Mont., and
former All-State selection, will hold
down the left end position.
FIGHT IN BACKFIELD
A wide open fight has developed in
the backfield, with at least three
men in the thick of the running for
every position. Andrews, Parkinson
and CafTal are trying to cinch the
quarterback spot under the T for
mation that the frosh will use this
year, while Zappatini, Parsons and
Sanderman are all in there fighting
for the left half opener.
Pettit, Ullman and Dana are the
leading candidates for the right half
position, with Dave Pate, Clem
Woods and Rus Oplinger trying to
cinch down the fullback assignment.
"We won't be as heavy as we were last year, but at the present time
it looks like we'll be quite a bit faster," said Harry Shipkey as he
summed up the chances for the Class of '45 s representatives in this fall s
grid wars.
Kliinkcv has linen working out his chartres since September 8, in prepa-

ration for a schedule that includes,
three of the toughest junior college
teams in the state, as well as the
intercollegiate games with the frosh
teams of Cal, U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
FIGIIT FOR END JOB
The left end job is a wide open
fight between Dave Brown, former
member of the highly-touted Pied
mont High squad of last season, and
Pole August, 175-pound product of
Whittier. A hundred and ninety
five-pound Bill Young of Fresno has
sewed up the left tackle job pretty
well, but a good fight is being waged
for the left guard position between
Jim Cowin of Minneapolis and Bill
Sigurdson of Portland. Seattle's
