# Burnett Chosen Frosh Mentor
## New Coach Replaces Lee as Hoop Chief 
### 
The BA.C, last week announced
the selection of Bob Burnett as
freshman basketball coach and chief
assistant to head mentor Everett
Dean. Coach Burnett will fill the
vacancy created by the appointment
of H. B. "Beeb" Lee to head coach
at Utah State. The new frosh head
man is no stranger to Cardinal bas
ketball followers, having been quite
a player in his student days and as
sistant to Coaches Dean and Lee
last year.
Coach Everett Dean has an
nounced that there will be a meet
ing of both varsity and frosh squads
this Friday afternoon in Room 41 of
the BA.C. The frosh cagers will
meet at 3 p.m., while the varsity
aspirants will follow at 4 p.m. Phys
ical examinations for all players
will be given Friday afternoon.
Prospects for this year's cage race
seem to be growing more dismal as
the weeks go by. Coach Dean now
has but two returning lettermen,
Don Burness and Bill Cowden, out
of nine letter winners. The latest
loss was the induction of Fordy An
derson, all-Coast forward on last
year's great team, into the army at
Chicago, 111. But with the acquisi
tion of last season's sterling frosh
outfit the outlook shouldn't be too
gloomy.
Practice sessions for the fall are
expected to begin some time next
week. Senior Manager Bob Butler
also issues the call to all sopho
mores who may be interested in
working as sophomore managers.
