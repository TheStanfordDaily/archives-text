# Six 'Purged' Frosh Return
## 
### 
Six of the eight freshman ath
letes, whose Stanford carcers were
cut short last spring by the sudden
"purge" of Pacific Coast Conference
Commissioner Edwin N. Atherton,
have returned to the Farm to register
for fall quarter, The Daily learned
yesterday.

After a summer of doubt, during
which many rumors flew up and
down the coast over where the men
would enroll to continue their
schooling, the unrest came to an end
yesterday when Hal Petrich, Mat
Petrich, Jim Ellis, Bill Joslyn, Bob
Waters and Bill Nourse signified
their intention of enrolling at Stan
ford.

General sentiments of the group
were reflected in the statement, of
Petrlich, a guard registered last year
from Midvale, Utah, that "an educa
tion is the thing to really think
about, and Stanford is the best place
that I know of to get that education."

The two men not returning, Bob
Koch and Jean Lamoure, have reg
istered at the University of Oregon
and Fresno State respectively where
both arc making strong bids for
starting positions on the football
teams of each school.
