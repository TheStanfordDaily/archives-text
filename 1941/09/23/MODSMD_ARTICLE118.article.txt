# Splashers See '41 Coast Title
## 'Water Polo Players The Best Since 1936' 
### 
Approached for comment on this
season's water polo prospects, Coach
Nort Thornton was more than oblig
ing, saying, "I think Stanford's var
sity water polo team will be the
best since 1936, the last time we won
the Pacific Coast Conference title. I
have great hopes of winning the
Conference title this season."
It is easy to agree with the coach
after looking at the squad roster
and the list of reserves, and recalling
the successful spring practice cli
maxed by an 8-4 victory over an
all-star alumni team.
EIGHT STARS RETURN
Eight of last year's varsity are i*e
turning, including Captain Frank
Mitchell, all-conference guard: Fred
Manwaring, hero of last year's vic
tory over the champion California
Bears; and John Bleecker, whom the
coach terms "the most valuable and
versatile man on the squad."
Thornton counts heavily on play
ers from last year's champion frosh
team. Outstanding of these is Cen
ter Back Bob "Rosebud" Hind,
whom Thornton calls a "sensational
sophomore sharp shooter, a real
water polo player"; and Grant Cul
ley, last year's high scorer with an
average of five goals per game.
Much is also expected of Bill
Mapel, a transfer sprinter from
U.C.L.A.; and Bert Singer, a trans
fer from S.F. State and a former
goalie for the Olympic Club.
SWIM STARS
Further re-enforcing the squad
will be Don Smith and Bob Rey
nolds, varsity swim stars out for
water polo for the first time. Ted
!Munro, frosh swim captain, will
also try his hand on the polo team.
And Johny Hauerwass, veteran for
ward, has returned following a leave
of absence.
In addition to such stars, the team
has plenty of reserve strength. "We
are well fortified in every position,"
said the coach. The first practice is
this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
