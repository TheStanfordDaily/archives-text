# Tex Oliver Rebuilds Depleted Squad into Strong Contender
## 
### 
Since practice started up at Eugene, Ore., Oregon University's fool
hall stock has been dropping little by little, and Coach Tex Oliver has
been engaged in a virtual rebuilding of the grid machine that is to face
the Stanford Indians Saturday.
What appeared to be a good outfit has been hit by more things than

you can shake a stick at, leaving a
squad of 41 men, the smallest in
years. Among the missing are Jake
Leicht, Roy Ell, Roy Dyer, Buzz
Baker, Hymie Harris, Dick Stanton,
and Paul Formoso. The first four
were backs, and ail were scheduled
to play a lot of ball for the Ducks
this fall.

Since practice started Oliver has
made 14 changes in player assign
ments to balance his material. The
job of teaching players their new
assignments has necessarily cut
down time which could have been
spent in smoothing out offensive
and defense play. However, Oliver
has a reputation for getting his teams
in shape in a hurry, indicating that
the Webfeet will give the Indians a
rough afternoon.
HARD TO TAKE
Though the losses suffered by the
Ducks were hard to take, they don't
affect the team that was lined up
as the number one eleven last
spring, and which, with two excep
tions, is scheduled to start Satur
day. The line-up appears to be: Jim
Shepard and Bill Regncr at ends, Ed
Moshofsky and Dick Ashcom at
tackles, Val Culwcll and Ray Segale
at guards, Elliot Wilson at center,
Duke Iverson at quarter, Frank
Boyd or Tommy Roblin and Curly
Mecham at halves, and Jimmy Ncw
quist at full.

There's a boy on the Oregon team
named Bob Koch, who may make
things hot for the Indians. Koch, of
course, is the Portland lad who was
declared ineligible to compete at
Stanford by Ed Atherton last spring.
He is threatening to move into the
fullback slot, but has to battle Bill
Dunlap, a former Menlo J.C. grid
der, as well as Newquist, for the
starting berth. Newquist is a vet
eran.
KNOWS "T FORMATION
It has been suggested that Koch
may be particularly useful to the
Ducks on defense, since he knows
the "I" formation intimately, hav
ing used it a little when he was a
freshman and having worked with
it during the time he was out for
spring practice on the Farm. How
ever, Standlee and Gallarneau knew
lots more than Koch does about the
"T," and they didn't have much suc
cess in stopping it in the All-Star
vs. Chicago Bears contest last month.
The Ducks are undoubtedly point
ing for the Stanford contest, as is
every other outfit on the Indians'
schedule. They get first crack and
the chances are they'll make the most
of it.

day. The line-up appears to be: Jim
Shepard and Bill Regncr at ends, Ed
Moshofsky and Dick Ashcom at
tackles, Val Culwcll and Ray Segale
at guards, Elliot Wilson at center,
Duke Iverson at quarter, Frank
Boyd or Tommy Roblin and Curly
Mecham at halves, and Jimmy Ncw
quist at full.

There's a boy on the Oregon team
named Bob Koch, who may make
things hot for the Indians. Koch, of
course, is the Portland lad who was
declared ineligible to compete at
Stanford by Ed Atherton last spring.
He is threatening to move into the
fullback slot, but has to battle Bill
Dunlap, a former Menlo J.C. grid
der, as well as Newquist, for the
starting berth. Newquist is a vet
eran.
KNOWS "T FORMATION
It has been suggested that Koch
may be particularly useful to the
Ducks on defense, since he knows
the "I" formation intimately, hav
ing used it a little when he was a
freshman and having worked with
it during the time he was out for
spring practice on the Farm. How
ever, Standlee and Gallarneau knew
lots more than Koch does about the
"T," and they didn't have much suc
cess in stopping it in the All-Star
vs. Chicago Bears contest last month.
The Ducks are undoubtedly point
ing for the Stanford contest, as is
every other outfit on the Indians'
schedule. They get first crack and
the chances are they'll make the most
of it.
Since practice started up at Eugene, Ore., Oregon University's fool
hall stock has been dropping little by little, and Coach Tex Oliver has
been engaged in a virtual rebuilding of the grid machine that is to face
the Stanford Indians Saturday.
What appeared to be a good outfit has been hit by more things than

you can shake a stick at, leaving a
squad of 41 men, the smallest in
years. Among the missing are Jake
Leicht, Roy Ell, Roy Dyer, Buzz
Baker, Hymie Harris, Dick Stanton,
and Paul Formoso. The first four
were backs, and ail were scheduled
to play a lot of ball for the Ducks
this fall.

Since practice started Oliver has
made 14 changes in player assign
ments to balance his material. The
job of teaching players their new
assignments has necessarily cut
down time which could have been
spent in smoothing out offensive
and defense play. However, Oliver
has a reputation for getting his teams
in shape in a hurry, indicating that
the Webfeet will give the Indians a
rough afternoon.
HARD TO TAKE
Though the losses suffered by the
Ducks were hard to take, they don't
affect the team that was lined up
as the number one eleven last
spring, and which, with two excep
tions, is scheduled to start Satur
day. The line-up appears to be: Jim
Shepard and Bill Regncr at ends, Ed
Moshofsky and Dick Ashcom at
tackles, Val Culwcll and Ray Segale
at guards, Elliot Wilson at center,
Duke Iverson at quarter, Frank
