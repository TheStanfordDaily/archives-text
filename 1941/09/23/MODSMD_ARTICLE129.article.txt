# Cart! Stadium Rim Repaired, Seals Replaced
## Huge Gate Receipts Finance New Steel Bowl Superstructure 
### 
At a cost of seventy-five thousand
dollars, the Stanford football sta
dium, the largest college stadium in
the nation, has undergone a mam
moth repair job. Sixteen thousand
seats around the rim have been re
placed, a new broadcasting booth
and a new public address booth with
new amplifying units have been in
stalled, the entire bowl, as well as
ticket offices and candy stands, has
received a new coat of paint, and the
superstructure, where it was wood,
has been changed to steel.
The project required such items as
eighty thousand bolts and two hun
dred thirty-five thousand board feet
of lumber, and employed a crew of
about fifty men a day since the work
began in the middle of July. Burn
ing the numbers into the seats, one
of the smaller phases of the recon
struction, was a twenty-day job in
itself.
STEEL SHORTAGE
Work was held up intermittently
all summer due to the shortage of
steel. Sixty-seven steel braces were
still lacking only two weeks ago; but
all the necessary materials arrived in
time, and the final stages of the
project were completed Septem
ber 18.
Stanford's J. B. Wells, professor of
engineering, was designer and en
gineer. He was assisted by Ed
Thoits, field engineer, a graduate
student of engineering at Stanford.
The biggest problem, according to
Thoits, was fitting the new structure
to the old. The bank had settled, and
other factors contributed to throw
ing calculations off. Wells P. Good
enough was this contractor, and his
foreman, Walter Mentz.
WOOD REMOVED
Hie upper superstructure was
formerly wooden. The seats were
nailed down, and the nails would
eventually corrode. Now the entire
superstructure, from hand rails to
stair beams, is steel, and the seats
are bolted down.
High on the Stanford side are twin
white booths, just built. From one
the games will be broadcast to the
nation. From the other Mr. Lieben
dorfer will announce ball carrier mid
tackier to the crowd.

The seventy-five thousand dollars
will come from the general athletic
fund, made up principally from last
year's gate receipts. One of the big
advantages of a winning team, ac
cording to Liebendorfer, is to at
tract crowds large enough to finance
upkeep of the stadium.

eventually corrode. Now the entire
superstructure, from hand rails to
stair beams, is steel, and the seats
are bolted down.
High on the Stanford side are twin
white booths, just built. From one
the games will be broadcast to the
nation. From the other Mr. Lieben
dorfer will announce ball carrier mid
tackier to the crowd.

The seventy-five thousand dollars
will come from the general athletic
fund, made up principally from last
year's gate receipts. One of the big
advantages of a winning team, ac
cording to Liebendorfer, is to at
tract crowds large enough to finance
upkeep of the stadium.
At a cost of seventy-five thousand
dollars, the Stanford football sta
dium, the largest college stadium in
the nation, has undergone a mam
moth repair job. Sixteen thousand
seats around the rim have been re
placed, a new broadcasting booth
and a new public address booth with
new amplifying units have been in
stalled, the entire bowl, as well as
ticket offices and candy stands, has
received a new coat of paint, and the
superstructure, where it was wood,
has been changed to steel.
The project required such items as
eighty thousand bolts and two hun
dred thirty-five thousand board feet
of lumber, and employed a crew of
about fifty men a day since the work
began in the middle of July. Burn
ing the numbers into the seats, one
of the smaller phases of the recon
struction, was a twenty-day job in
itself.
STEEL SHORTAGE
Work was held up intermittently
all summer due to the shortage of
steel. Sixty-seven steel braces were
still lacking only two weeks ago; but
all the necessary materials arrived in
time, and the final stages of the
project were completed Septem
ber 18.
Stanford's J. B. Wells, professor of
engineering, was designer and en
gineer. He was assisted by Ed
Thoits, field engineer, a graduate
student of engineering at Stanford.
The biggest problem, according to
Thoits, was fitting the new structure
to the old. The bank had settled, and
other factors contributed to throw
ing calculations off. Wells P. Good
enough was this contractor, and his
foreman, Walter Mentz.
WOOD REMOVED
Hie upper superstructure was
formerly wooden. The seats were
nailed down, and the nails would
eventually corrode. Now the entire
superstructure, from hand rails to
stair beams, is steel, and the seats
are bolted down.
