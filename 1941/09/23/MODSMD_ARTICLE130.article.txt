# Snead's 272 Wins Hurst Golf Cash
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Sept.. 22 (UP).
â€”Despite a broken middle finger,
Hillbilly Sam Snead outplayed all
his brother golfers in one of the most
sparkling links exhibitions ever seen
in these parts to cop the $7500 Hurst
golf tourney here yesterday after
noon.
Slammin' Sammy, smacking out
his long ball in best approved style
and hitting his irons with deadly
accuracy, put together a 69 and 65
in today's 36-hole final to round out
an eight-under-par 72-hole 272 to
tal. The victory was worth $1500 to
the silent Hillbilly.
Dick Metz followed Snead with
a total of 281 to take second place
and $1000.
