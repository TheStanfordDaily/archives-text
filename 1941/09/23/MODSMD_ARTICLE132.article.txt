# Gridders Sharpen 'T' for Oregon Ducks
## Coach Speeds Up Offense Practices in Preparation For Opener on Saturday Webfeet Hope To Upset Cards In P.C.C. Tilt 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Already Stanford's varsity football
team has gone through five scrim
mages in their race to get primed
before meeting the Oregon Ducks,
who arc seeking revenge for the
13 to 0 defeat handed them by the
Farm team last year in Saturday's
opener at the Stadium.
Since he was given only two and
one-half weeks to condition his
charges before sending them in
quest of their twelfth straight vic
tory, Coach Clark Shaughnessy has
speeded up offensive drills in order
to give his regulars that quality
which backfield coach Marchie
Schwartz termed "smooth."
Although Pete Kmetovic and
Frankie Albert, the two men who
scored the 13 points that beat the
Webfeet last year, arc still doing
business at the same old stand, a
guard here, a couple of ends tharc,
and two potent backs have departed,
leaving gaps that must be filled be
fore the T will function properly.
BACKFIELD REPLACEMENTS
At last count, Eric "Hoot" Arm
strong and Milt Vucinich were in
the right half and fullback posts
vacated by Hugh Gallarneau and
Norm Standlee. These two, with
Albert and Kmetovic, will compose
the backfield that will start against
Tex Oliver's dark horses.
Vic Lindskog, Chuck Taylor, Ed
Stamm, Bruno Banducci, and Fred
Meyer return at center, left guard,
left tackle, right tackle, and right
end. Each of these men needs little
assistance at his position since thry
are all all-Coast and even all-Amer
ican material. Playing right guard
in Dick Palmer's absence is Jack
Francis, who, although lacking
Palmer's size, has the speed neces
sary for his defensive duties of line
backing.
NORBERG OR iMEINERS
The man on the south end of the
line this season will be either Hank
Norberg or Arnold Meiners. The
anxiety caused by the loss of Stan
Graff arid Clem Tomerlin has been
lessened considerably by the work
of Meiners and Norberg.
Behind this aggregation all is in
definite. Position .switching and
even whole-team-switching has been
rampant during the squad's work
outs. The eleven wearing the red
shirts, who have been called the
"Reds," were designated as the sec
ond team. However, the team wear
ing tho blue shirts, the "Blues,"
showed so much more fire and ac
tual ground gaining ability against
the frosh in Saturday's scrum that
the "Reds' " status is uncertain.
Ray Hammett, Albert's No. 1 re
lief man last season, calls signals for
the "Reds." Bob Crane does thn
fullbacking and Al Cole and Bob
Ditlevscn, the halfbacking for this
team. In front of them are Doug
Stable at center, Dave Patterson
and Ken Robesky at left and right
guards, Ed Johannessen and Bill
Mannon at left and right tacklc...
and Rog Laverty and Bill Symeb at
the ends.
DRAFT GETS FORBES
The "Blue" backs were all sopho
mores until Frank Forbes was liit by
the draft over tho week-end. In his
spot at quarterback goes Ray Dur
ham, one of the surprises of the
practices so far. Durham played
