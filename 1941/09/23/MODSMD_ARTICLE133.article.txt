### 
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 22 (UP).—
The Brooklyn Dodgers bulwarked
tlu'ir lead in the National League
pennant rare today with a 5-0 vic
tory over the Philadelphia Phillies
as the veteran Curt Davis pitched a
six -hitter.
'Hie win increased the Dodgers'
margin over the idle St. Louis Car
dinals to a game and a half with only
four games left to play— two each
against the last-place Phillies and
the seventh-place Boston Braves.
The standings after today's game:
W L Pet. G-B
Brooklyn 07 53 .047
St. Louis 04 53 .643 1 1 a
In contrast to the rccord-breaking
throng of nearly 30,000 which
watched yesterday's doubleheader,
only 3,500 fans were scattered in the
seats of Shibe Park to watch the
veteran Davis score his 13th triumph
of the year.
DAVIS METHODICAL
While Davis methodically mowed
down the Phillies for the Dodgers'
39th win over the Prothro-men this
year, his mates bunched their eight
blows off Ha be Melton to count four
times in the sixth inning after Pee
Wee Reese had driven home Joe
Medwick with the initial run in the
second. Davis never gave up more
than one hit in any single inning
until the ninth when he was touched
for a pair of singles.
The "Bums" took the lead early
when Medwick opened the second
with a double to center off Melton.
Cookie Lavagetto's grounder allowed
him to reach third. He scored when
Reese beat out an infield hit.
With one away in the filth, May
lashed a double to right center but
was caught in a chase and run down
I.»»tween second and third by Reese
.i few moments later when Bragan
grounded to Davis. Bragan reached
■ econd on the play, but Melton
popped out to end the threat.
HERMAN DOUBLES
'l he Dodgers salted it away in the
: \th when Eills Herman opened
with a double. Murtagh knocked
down Reiser's liner, but it went for
ingle. Dolph Camilli followed up
v ith a two-bagger that scored Her
man and sent Reiser to third. Mel
ton purposely passed Medwick,
filling the bases, but it turned out
to be a bad guess as Harry Lava
ret to bounced a single to right
•coring Reiser and Camilli. Melton
t'.c-n uncorked a wild pitch, Med
wick going to third. He scored on
Reese's long fly.
Ihe win sent the torrid pennant
r ce into the definite "if" stage. If
Brooklyn wins only one more, St.
Louis will have to win four out of
(heir remaining six to cop the flag.
II the Brooks can win with two more,
it means the Cards need five vic
tories. Three more wins will force
the Cards to make a clean sweep of
their remaining six, and if the Bums
take all of their final four, it's Katie
liar the door.
Brooklyn rests tomorrow before
iru cling the Braves Wednesday and
Thursday. They are off again Fri
day, then come home to close out the
ei'son with the Phils on Saturday
and Sunday. The Cards will get a
chance to puil back within a half

veteran Davis score his 13th triumph
of the year.
DAVIS METHODICAL
While Davis methodically mowed
down the Phillies for the Dodgers'
39th win over the Prothro-men this
year, his mates bunched their eight
blows off Ha be Melton to count four
times in the sixth inning after Pee
Wee Reese had driven home Joe
Medwick with the initial run in the
second. Davis never gave up more
than one hit in any single inning
until the ninth when he was touched
for a pair of singles.
The "Bums" took the lead early
when Medwick opened the second
with a double to center off Melton.
Cookie Lavagetto's grounder allowed
him to reach third. He scored when
Reese beat out an infield hit.
With one away in the filth, May
lashed a double to right center but
was caught in a chase and run down
I.»»tween second and third by Reese
.i few moments later when Bragan
grounded to Davis. Bragan reached
■ econd on the play, but Melton
popped out to end the threat.
HERMAN DOUBLES
'l he Dodgers salted it away in the
: \th when Eills Herman opened
with a double. Murtagh knocked
down Reiser's liner, but it went for
ingle. Dolph Camilli followed up
v ith a two-bagger that scored Her
man and sent Reiser to third. Mel
ton purposely passed Medwick,
filling the bases, but it turned out
to be a bad guess as Harry Lava
ret to bounced a single to right
•coring Reiser and Camilli. Melton
t'.c-n uncorked a wild pitch, Med
wick going to third. He scored on
Reese's long fly.
Ihe win sent the torrid pennant
r ce into the definite "if" stage. If
Brooklyn wins only one more, St.
Louis will have to win four out of
(heir remaining six to cop the flag.
II the Brooks can win with two more,
it means the Cards need five vic
tories. Three more wins will force
the Cards to make a clean sweep of
their remaining six, and if the Bums
take all of their final four, it's Katie
