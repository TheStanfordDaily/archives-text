# Initial Boat Club Gathering Planned for Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
It has been nearly two years since the first steps were taken to organize
the new Stanford crew. This Friday the Boat Club will begin practice for
its second year of competition, with races against Oregon State, U.C.L.A.,
Sacramento J. C\, Compton J. C., and possibly Keed College of Oregon

coming up for next spring.
Despite the loss of three varsity
men through graduation, Coaches
Pedersen and Bernley expect a
great improvement in the boat, as
Veteran Bob Schaeer is returning
and a good turnout of new men is
anticipated.
This year the boys will not be
handicapped by lack of equipment,
as the club has purchased new oars
and the University of Washington is
donating another shell which will
facilitate intersquad competition as a
regular part of the training schedule.
With this new equipment a frosh
boat will be put on the water this
year, and the coaches are hoping for
a large turnout from Encina.
The first meeting of the club will
he held this Wednesday evening at
7 p.m. in Room 214. upstairs in the
English Corner. All members and
new men interested in rowing are
urged to attend, as the set-up for
the coming year will be explained
by Head Coach Pedersen, who has

â–º
! stressed that the new men need not
! have had previous rowing expe
