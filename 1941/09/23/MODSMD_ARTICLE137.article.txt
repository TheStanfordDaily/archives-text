# Farm Racquet Squad Enters Coast Tourney
## 
### 
By BILL STEIF
Stanford's touring tennis stars will i
hit the biggest tournament when i
they pull into Berkeley to play in i
the Pacific Coast Tournament Sat
urday.
Ted Schroeder, big gun of the
Farm group, will probably he seeded
in the number two or three spot. [
Ted has had a wonderful tennis sum- i
iner playing in the finals of two of
the "big four" tournaments in the
East and in the semi-finals of the
other two. This is in addition to
taking Bobby Riggs, national champ,
to five sets in the semi-finals of the j
U.S. tournament and with Monte
bellow's Jack Kramer sweeping ihr
national doubles title for the second '
year in a row. As a matter of fact,
Schroeder and Kramer were de
feated only once all summer.
TWO OTHERS ENTER
In addition to Schroeder, Stan
ford's stellar pair of veterans, Larry
Dee and Jim Wade, are scheduled to
play this big tourney. Di e and Wack
have put in a good summer of ten
nis, winning the Southern doubles
crown. Dee has also done quite well
in singles, winning the Minnesota
state championship and advancing to
the crucial rounds in several other
big tournaments.
Meanwhile, Jack Gurley, who
caused such a sensation last spring
in the California State Tourney, and
Emery Neale, the Farm team's num
ber one singles man last spring,
have cleaned up in the Pacific North
west. They have won a large num
ber of matches, both singly and as a
tandem, and should be in fine shape
to push the seeded players in the
big Pacific tournament.
WINS AND LOSSES
Down in Southern California dur
ing the last week Stanford tennists
met with varying success in the im
portant Pacific Southwest matches.
Ted Schroeder ran into Pasadena
J.C.'s red-hot George Richards in
one of the tournament's early rounds
and in an unexpected upset lost,
G-3, 6-4. Jim Wade, in the round of
sixteen, went down before Schroe
der's doubles partner, Jack Kramer,
6-1, 6-4, but Wade's other half, Larry
Dee, pulled one of the coup d'etats
of the tourney by licking Carl Earn,
John Van Ryn, and Hal Surface, and
then swamping 1949 National Champ
Don McNeill, 6-4, 4-6, 8-6. Though
Dee finally lost to Frankie Parker
in the semi-finals, 8-6, 6-2, his win
over McNeill should do much in
shoving him forward in the na
tional rankings. Chuck Hutchison,
another Farm net star, bowed out of
the tournament in the early rounds,
losing to National Champ Bobby
Riggs and the title-holder's lethal
lebs, 6-2. 6-0.

The big salmon run is now on in
the Klamath River. Salmon fishing
in Eureka Bay continues to be best
in Humboldt county.

Stanford's touring tennis stars will i
hit the biggest tournament when i
they pull into Berkeley to play in i
the Pacific Coast Tournament Sat
urday.
Ted Schroeder, big gun of the
Farm group, will probably he seeded
in the number two or three spot. [
Ted has had a wonderful tennis sum- i
iner playing in the finals of two of
the "big four" tournaments in the
East and in the semi-finals of the
other two. This is in addition to
taking Bobby Riggs, national champ,
to five sets in the semi-finals of the j
U.S. tournament and with Monte
bellow's Jack Kramer sweeping ihr
national doubles title for the second '
year in a row. As a matter of fact,
Schroeder and Kramer were de
feated only once all summer.
TWO OTHERS ENTER
In addition to Schroeder, Stan
ford's stellar pair of veterans, Larry
Dee and Jim Wade, are scheduled to
play this big tourney. Di e and Wack
have put in a good summer of ten
nis, winning the Southern doubles
crown. Dee has also done quite well
in singles, winning the Minnesota
state championship and advancing to
the crucial rounds in several other
big tournaments.
Meanwhile, Jack Gurley, who
caused such a sensation last spring
in the California State Tourney, and
Emery Neale, the Farm team's num
ber one singles man last spring,
have cleaned up in the Pacific North
west. They have won a large num
ber of matches, both singly and as a
tandem, and should be in fine shape
to push the seeded players in the
big Pacific tournament.
WINS AND LOSSES
Down in Southern California dur
ing the last week Stanford tennists
met with varying success in the im
portant Pacific Southwest matches.
Ted Schroeder ran into Pasadena
J.C.'s red-hot George Richards in
one of the tournament's early rounds
and in an unexpected upset lost,
G-3, 6-4. Jim Wade, in the round of
sixteen, went down before Schroe
der's doubles partner, Jack Kramer,
6-1, 6-4, but Wade's other half, Larry
Dee, pulled one of the coup d'etats
of the tourney by licking Carl Earn,
John Van Ryn, and Hal Surface, and
then swamping 1949 National Champ
Don McNeill, 6-4, 4-6, 8-6. Though
Dee finally lost to Frankie Parker
in the semi-finals, 8-6, 6-2, his win
over McNeill should do much in
