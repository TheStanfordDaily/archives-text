### H. D. THOREAU Assistant Sports Editor 
f 'CONSIDER a tear as hereby being shed for one who was, and still is, but
4 on October 7 won't be,
In the battle Sam vs. Dippy, Sam won.
A former occupant of this spot—everybody who is anybody was an
assistant sports editor at one time or another has just been shoved, not
jehind the eight ball, but behind the cannon ball.
To use different words, Jerry Brueker has been selectively serviced.
Wednesday next, tomorrow, the Saturday Evening Post, an illus
trated national five-cent weekly founded in 17?) 1 A.I), hy Benjamin
"Just Call Me Ben" Franklin, will clutter up the newstsands with its
2(1. 21, Bi>. 85, and 87 pages festooned by a blurb called "lie Clowns
to 'touchdowns,"
To my feeble brain it consists of one jigger of facts concerning the
life and loves of F. Cuilen Albert, footballer dc luxe, drowned under
a three-hour session with an opium pipe.
But don't'get me wrong, it's interesting, slightly informative, and flat
[ering through the medium of reflected glory to all those who have
brushed fenders with Frankie, how familiar of me, on the Farm.

A FTER reading the Daily Californian sports editor's column in which he
names five Indians on his All-Coast team for -the coming year, I felt
l.hat the only just thing to do was to reciprocate, so I'm naming my :111 -
P.C.C. team.
At ends are Freddie Meyer of L.S.J.U. and Hank Norberg of L.S.J.U.
If Norberg runs into an injury during the season I'll sneak in Milt Smith
of U.C.L.A.
One tackle goes to I*. Banducci. the other to Bob Iteinhard. Ban
ducci is from L.S.J.U. while Keinhard is from U.C.B. If the latter
isn't up to his last season form, look for Bob DeLauer of U.S.C. to
fill in the other side.
Guards are pretty scarce this season hut Chuck Taylor of L.S.J.I'.
deserves the call along with Kay Frankowski of U.W. For those who
can't spell or pronounce Phrancou/.ki's name, change it to Francis
of L.S.J.U.
With Vie Lindskog of L.S.J.U. around there need be no argument as
to the center post,
F. Albert of L.S.J.U., P. Kmetovic of same, W. Sewoll of W.S.C. and
FI. Robertson of U.S.C. make up my backfield.
In return, for the kind action of the Daily Californian we squoze in
one Bear. They may consider themselves lucky. •

/ |NE WEEK ago today should have been a great day for Stanford tennis.
Larry Dee, captain of the Farm squad, rose up and smote Don McNeil,
1040 national champ, in three sets on the not-so-historic center court ol
the L.A.T.C. in the second round of the Southwest tourney.
This feat not only raised Dee's bond (i.e., as in.stock and bond) but it
raised Ted Schroeder, Stanford's premier netter, in his battle with Mc-
Neil for third national ranking.
'lhere is. however, one small discrepancy in this happy, happy talc.
Previously in the clay on the same asphalt, Schroeder had been dealt
a powder by George Richards of Montebello and Pasadena Jaysee.
Incidentally, Richards was given a tag heretofore unheard of in the
annals of sports writing by the L.A. journalists—"giant killer."

/ 1 ETTING back to the S.E.P. and the story about the T and Mr. Albert,
9 did Pete Kmetovic ever get Ann Sheridan's autograph? Speaking of
the T, for the benefit of all '45'ers and of all old students who never did
know, I might explain why they call the T the T (which runs along the
know, I might expalin why they call the T the T (which runs along the
same line as calling a spade a spade).
When the varsity lines up before executing a play the quarterback
stands directly behind the center with the fullback standing directly to
the rear of the quarter who is, as I mentioned, directly to the rear of the
center. The halfbacks stand on either side of the fullback. If you plot
this out on a piece of paper you will readily see that there is a distinct
T formed. However, don't look for this kind of t.

If you are asked to sign one of the petitions which are floating
around the campus, according to an unfounded rumor, petitioning
to schedule the University of Vladivostok's Bears in a post-season
game for the U.S.O. this year, don't do it.
They have two Siberian tackles that were approached while still in
klaturshka, that's Russian for junior high school. They have jobs on the
Bear campus winding eight-day clocks, that's Russian for clocks, at 2000
kopecs an hour.
