### DON SELBY 
Vf/"HEN our Coach Clark Shaughnessy began to holler "we fear Ore
gon," he started something. Duck Mentor Tex Oliver didn't like it a
bit. And now he and Oregon's publicity director Bruce Hamby—who is
now in San Francisco to get the big city excited for the game this Satur
day—are screaming like the well-known eagles.
Shaughnessy said he expected the Webfoots to be great stuff this fall,
especially in their first few games. And we don't think he was just using
that as a psychological factor, either, for they really did have a squad
with lots of promise up Eugene way. Now, however, the picture has
changed somewhat, for the draft, national defense jobs, and injuries have
taken their toll on the Ducks.
And if you don't lliink the Oregon publicity men arc making the
most of the losses in order to get deeper into that underdog position,
you just haven't seen the press releases sent out hy the A.S.U.O.
news bureau. Not that we blame them, for actually the set-up isn't
too pretty. At any rate, the Card coaching staff has somewhat muffled
their "fear Oregon" screams; Oliver and Ilamby seem to have won
the fearing title for this round.
But Shaughnessy can start out this week in fine style again, for latest
developments find Frank Forbes scheduled to join Uncle Sam's outfit next
month. We just happened to be in Don Liebendorfer's office yesterday,
when the Redskin mentor stuck his head through the doorway to inform
all and sundry that "our second team quarterback has been drafted."
"He thought he had a couple of more months, anyway," Shaughnessy
said. "And he was our second-string man, too."
Forbes is the little 165-pounder from Los Angeles who played behind
Bob Mitchull on last year's undefeated frosh team. It took him a
while to get accustomed to the "T" formation attack (the Papooses
only used it a ltitle in '40), but last week ho was right in there bat
tling Kay Hammett for the honor of backing up Frank Albert. And.
from what Shaughnessy said yesterday, he must have moved in front

of the Stockton hoy.
The loss of Forbes leaves Ham
mett and Ray Durham as the num
ber two and three quarterbacks, re
spectively. Durham has been coming
fast this fall and has been put in
the category marked "new finds."
He played fullback behind Albert on
the 1938 frosh eleven but didn't
play football the next two seasons.
He has lots to learn about the intri
cate maneuvers required of the up
man in the "T," but he has a lot of
natural ability, especially in the
passing department.

A LTIIOUGH you never know
when Coach Clark is going to
change his mind, with our fingers
crossed, we'll say that it appears AL
MOST certain that Eric "Hoot"
Armstrong, the squat speedster from
Portland, will open at right halfback
against Oregon come this Saturday.
Bobby Ditlevesen, the made-over

right end, has shown a great deal of promise at the position, but "Hoot"
has the edge so far, having played the position as Hugh Gallarneau's under
study all last season.
True, it's going to be rather tough for Armstrong on defense, for knock
ing passes out of the hands of six-foot-six ends isn't any picnic for a
boy who goes only five feet seven into the air when he's got his heels off
the ground and his toes touching. But Armstrong works on the theory
that he can climb over them if necessary. And, above all, he has the spirit
that goes to make great gridders. No matter whether he is running in
scrimmage or just running plays, the little guy just goes for all he is
worth.
Only the other day out at practice, Assistant Coaches Jim Lawson
and Phil Bongtson. standing on the sidelines while the five teams that
make up the squad were"running plays, were heard to murmur some
thing like this:
"Look at that Armstrong go. Golly, he runs hard."
"Yeh, no matter if he is just decoying he moves in a hurry."
"Hoot" is going to have to keep on hustling to keep ahead of Ditlevsen,
for the Watsonville kid looks like a natural in the backfield. He's a fast
starter and a tricky runner. He runs with his knees high, with a short,
choppy stride that gives him plenty of deception and drive. That he is a
good defensive man goes without saying. You just don't play end if you
can't play defense, and "Dit" played lots of end last season.
In scrimmages that were the order of the day last week, Ditlevsen
has caught the collective eye of the coaching staff more than a little.
Evne last spring, Marchie Schwartz, the backfield coach, had an idea
that Bobby was due to play some good ball at one of the halfback
spots.
And behind this pair is Dark-Horse Buck Fawcett, a sophomore who is
probably the fastest man on the squad. Fawcett has all of the physical
requisites to handle the job, but he is as yet untried in varsity competi
tion. He will probably see some action Saturday, after which the coaches
may have a little clearer idea of what he can do under fire. It doesn't
appear that he will be threatening to move onto the first team for some
time to come. Nor would you expect him to, for he has three years of
competition to go and Armstrong and Ditlevsen aren't easy boys to beat out.

backfield that is scheduled to start the Oregon game doesn't appear
to be quite as well set in the speed department as the 1940 quartet was,
for, although Albert and Pete Kmetovic haven't slowed down any. Milt
Vucinich and Armstrong aren't quite the speed burners that Norm Stand
lee and Gallarneau were. This will probably be most noticeable at the
fullback spot, where Voos operates. The San Francisco boy just can't pick
up and move like the Chief could, but he has improved a great deal over
last year. Last spring Milt worked out on the track several times a week
to try to build up his speed, and he wasn't altogether unsuccessful.
Armstrong is no slow poke. In fact, he used to be a sprinter in
high school. But when he stepped into Gallarneau's shoes, he took on
a real load, for Hughie was one of the fastest hoys in Pacific Coast
football when he was packing the mail for the Indians. So even
though the backfield speed may not he as great as it was last year,
Stanford backs will he far from the slowest eleven in the P.C.C.
Speaking of Vucinich, as we were in a paragraph or so above, the
slashing Slav has been doing some outstanding work in the five scrim
mages the first team has participated in to date. His running is much bet
ter than ever before. He really drives now, whereas in the past he used
to spend a lot of time drifting and waiting for holes to open. The old drift
that is used so much in the Warner system just doesn't go in the "T"
attack, where a back has to get through a hole right now or not at all.
The change has made a world of difference in Vucinich.

"Hoot" is going to have to keep on hustling to keep ahead of Ditlevsen,
for the Watsonville kid looks like a natural in the backfield. He's a fast
starter and a tricky runner. He runs with his knees high, with a short,
choppy stride that gives him plenty of deception and drive. That he is a
good defensive man goes without saying. You just don't play end if you
can't play defense, and "Dit" played lots of end last season.
In scrimmages that were the order of the day last week, Ditlevsen
has caught the collective eye of the coaching staff more than a little.
Evne last spring, Marchie Schwartz, the backfield coach, had an idea
that Bobby was due to play some good ball at one of the halfback
spots.
And behind this pair is Dark-Horse Buck Fawcett, a sophomore who is
probably the fastest man on the squad. Fawcett has all of the physical
requisites to handle the job, but he is as yet untried in varsity competi
tion. He will probably see some action Saturday, after which the coaches
may have a little clearer idea of what he can do under fire. It doesn't
appear that he will be threatening to move onto the first team for some
time to come. Nor would you expect him to, for he has three years of
competition to go and Armstrong and Ditlevsen aren't easy boys to beat out.

backfield that is scheduled to start the Oregon game doesn't appear
to be quite as well set in the speed department as the 1940 quartet was,
for, although Albert and Pete Kmetovic haven't slowed down any. Milt
Vucinich and Armstrong aren't quite the speed burners that Norm Stand
lee and Gallarneau were. This will probably be most noticeable at the
fullback spot, where Voos operates. The San Francisco boy just can't pick
up and move like the Chief could, but he has improved a great deal over
last year. Last spring Milt worked out on the track several times a week
to try to build up his speed, and he wasn't altogether unsuccessful.
Armstrong is no slow poke. In fact, he used to be a sprinter in
high school. But when he stepped into Gallarneau's shoes, he took on
a real load, for Hughie was one of the fastest hoys in Pacific Coast
football when he was packing the mail for the Indians. So even
though the backfield speed may not he as great as it was last year,
Stanford backs will he far from the slowest eleven in the P.C.C.
Speaking of Vucinich, as we were in a paragraph or so above, the
slashing Slav has been doing some outstanding work in the five scrim
mages the first team has participated in to date. His running is much bet
ter than ever before. He really drives now, whereas in the past he used
to spend a lot of time drifting and waiting for holes to open. The old drift
that is used so much in the Warner system just doesn't go in the "T"
attack, where a back has to get through a hole right now or not at all.
The change has made a world of difference in Vucinich.


TEX OLIVER
Vf/"HEN our Coach Clark Shaughnessy began to holler "we fear Ore
gon," he started something. Duck Mentor Tex Oliver didn't like it a
bit. And now he and Oregon's publicity director Bruce Hamby—who is
now in San Francisco to get the big city excited for the game this Satur
day—are screaming like the well-known eagles.
Shaughnessy said he expected the Webfoots to be great stuff this fall,
especially in their first few games. And we don't think he was just using
that as a psychological factor, either, for they really did have a squad
with lots of promise up Eugene way. Now, however, the picture has
changed somewhat, for the draft, national defense jobs, and injuries have
taken their toll on the Ducks.
And if you don't lliink the Oregon publicity men arc making the
most of the losses in order to get deeper into that underdog position,
you just haven't seen the press releases sent out hy the A.S.U.O.
news bureau. Not that we blame them, for actually the set-up isn't
too pretty. At any rate, the Card coaching staff has somewhat muffled
their "fear Oregon" screams; Oliver and Ilamby seem to have won
the fearing title for this round.
But Shaughnessy can start out this week in fine style again, for latest
developments find Frank Forbes scheduled to join Uncle Sam's outfit next
month. We just happened to be in Don Liebendorfer's office yesterday,
when the Redskin mentor stuck his head through the doorway to inform
all and sundry that "our second team quarterback has been drafted."
"He thought he had a couple of more months, anyway," Shaughnessy
said. "And he was our second-string man, too."
Forbes is the little 165-pounder from Los Angeles who played behind
Bob Mitchull on last year's undefeated frosh team. It took him a
while to get accustomed to the "T" formation attack (the Papooses
only used it a ltitle in '40), but last week ho was right in there bat
tling Kay Hammett for the honor of backing up Frank Albert. And.
from what Shaughnessy said yesterday, he must have moved in front

of the Stockton hoy.
The loss of Forbes leaves Ham
mett and Ray Durham as the num
ber two and three quarterbacks, re
spectively. Durham has been coming
fast this fall and has been put in
the category marked "new finds."
He played fullback behind Albert on
the 1938 frosh eleven but didn't
play football the next two seasons.
He has lots to learn about the intri
cate maneuvers required of the up
man in the "T," but he has a lot of
natural ability, especially in the
passing department.

A LTIIOUGH you never know
when Coach Clark is going to
change his mind, with our fingers
crossed, we'll say that it appears AL
MOST certain that Eric "Hoot"
Armstrong, the squat speedster from
Portland, will open at right halfback
against Oregon come this Saturday.
Bobby Ditlevesen, the made-over

right end, has shown a great deal of promise at the position, but "Hoot"
has the edge so far, having played the position as Hugh Gallarneau's under
study all last season.
True, it's going to be rather tough for Armstrong on defense, for knock
ing passes out of the hands of six-foot-six ends isn't any picnic for a
boy who goes only five feet seven into the air when he's got his heels off
the ground and his toes touching. But Armstrong works on the theory
that he can climb over them if necessary. And, above all, he has the spirit
that goes to make great gridders. No matter whether he is running in
scrimmage or just running plays, the little guy just goes for all he is
worth.
Only the other day out at practice, Assistant Coaches Jim Lawson
and Phil Bongtson. standing on the sidelines while the five teams that
make up the squad were"running plays, were heard to murmur some
thing like this:
"Look at that Armstrong go. Golly, he runs hard."

news bureau. Not that we blame them, for actually the set-up isn't
too pretty. At any rate, the Card coaching staff has somewhat muffled
their "fear Oregon" screams; Oliver and Ilamby seem to have won
the fearing title for this round.
But Shaughnessy can start out this week in fine style again, for latest
developments find Frank Forbes scheduled to join Uncle Sam's outfit next
month. We just happened to be in Don Liebendorfer's office yesterday,
when the Redskin mentor stuck his head through the doorway to inform
all and sundry that "our second team quarterback has been drafted."
"He thought he had a couple of more months, anyway," Shaughnessy
said. "And he was our second-string man, too."
Forbes is the little 165-pounder from Los Angeles who played behind
Bob Mitchull on last year's undefeated frosh team. It took him a
while to get accustomed to the "T" formation attack (the Papooses
only used it a ltitle in '40), but last week ho was right in there bat
tling Kay Hammett for the honor of backing up Frank Albert. And.
from what Shaughnessy said yesterday, he must have moved in front

of the Stockton hoy.
The loss of Forbes leaves Ham
mett and Ray Durham as the num
ber two and three quarterbacks, re
spectively. Durham has been coming
fast this fall and has been put in
the category marked "new finds."
He played fullback behind Albert on
the 1938 frosh eleven but didn't
play football the next two seasons.
He has lots to learn about the intri
cate maneuvers required of the up
man in the "T," but he has a lot of
natural ability, especially in the
passing department.

A LTIIOUGH you never know
when Coach Clark is going to
change his mind, with our fingers
crossed, we'll say that it appears AL
MOST certain that Eric "Hoot"
Armstrong, the squat speedster from
Portland, will open at right halfback
against Oregon come this Saturday.
Bobby Ditlevesen, the made-over

right end, has shown a great deal of promise at the position, but "Hoot"
has the edge so far, having played the position as Hugh Gallarneau's under
study all last season.
True, it's going to be rather tough for Armstrong on defense, for knock
ing passes out of the hands of six-foot-six ends isn't any picnic for a
boy who goes only five feet seven into the air when he's got his heels off
the ground and his toes touching. But Armstrong works on the theory
that he can climb over them if necessary. And, above all, he has the spirit
that goes to make great gridders. No matter whether he is running in
scrimmage or just running plays, the little guy just goes for all he is
worth.
Only the other day out at practice, Assistant Coaches Jim Lawson
and Phil Bongtson. standing on the sidelines while the five teams that
make up the squad were"running plays, were heard to murmur some
thing like this:
"Look at that Armstrong go. Golly, he runs hard."
"Yeh, no matter if he is just decoying he moves in a hurry."
"Hoot" is going to have to keep on hustling to keep ahead of Ditlevsen,
for the Watsonville kid looks like a natural in the backfield. He's a fast
starter and a tricky runner. He runs with his knees high, with a short,
choppy stride that gives him plenty of deception and drive. That he is a
good defensive man goes without saying. You just don't play end if you
can't play defense, and "Dit" played lots of end last season.
In scrimmages that were the order of the day last week, Ditlevsen
has caught the collective eye of the coaching staff more than a little.
Evne last spring, Marchie Schwartz, the backfield coach, had an idea
that Bobby was due to play some good ball at one of the halfback
spots.
And behind this pair is Dark-Horse Buck Fawcett, a sophomore who is
probably the fastest man on the squad. Fawcett has all of the physical
requisites to handle the job, but he is as yet untried in varsity competi
tion. He will probably see some action Saturday, after which the coaches
may have a little clearer idea of what he can do under fire. It doesn't
appear that he will be threatening to move onto the first team for some
time to come. Nor would you expect him to, for he has three years of
competition to go and Armstrong and Ditlevsen aren't easy boys to beat out.

backfield that is scheduled to start the Oregon game doesn't appear
to be quite as well set in the speed department as the 1940 quartet was,
for, although Albert and Pete Kmetovic haven't slowed down any. Milt
Vucinich and Armstrong aren't quite the speed burners that Norm Stand
lee and Gallarneau were. This will probably be most noticeable at the
fullback spot, where Voos operates. The San Francisco boy just can't pick
up and move like the Chief could, but he has improved a great deal over
last year. Last spring Milt worked out on the track several times a week
to try to build up his speed, and he wasn't altogether unsuccessful.
Armstrong is no slow poke. In fact, he used to be a sprinter in
high school. But when he stepped into Gallarneau's shoes, he took on
a real load, for Hughie was one of the fastest hoys in Pacific Coast
football when he was packing the mail for the Indians. So even
though the backfield speed may not he as great as it was last year,
Stanford backs will he far from the slowest eleven in the P.C.C.
Speaking of Vucinich, as we were in a paragraph or so above, the
slashing Slav has been doing some outstanding work in the five scrim
mages the first team has participated in to date. His running is much bet
ter than ever before. He really drives now, whereas in the past he used
to spend a lot of time drifting and waiting for holes to open. The old drift
that is used so much in the Warner system just doesn't go in the "T"
attack, where a back has to get through a hole right now or not at all.
The change has made a world of difference in Vucinich.


TEX OLIVER
Vf/"HEN our Coach Clark Shaughnessy began to holler "we fear Ore
gon," he started something. Duck Mentor Tex Oliver didn't like it a
bit. And now he and Oregon's publicity director Bruce Hamby—who is
now in San Francisco to get the big city excited for the game this Satur
day—are screaming like the well-known eagles.
Shaughnessy said he expected the Webfoots to be great stuff this fall,
especially in their first few games. And we don't think he was just using
that as a psychological factor, either, for they really did have a squad
with lots of promise up Eugene way. Now, however, the picture has
changed somewhat, for the draft, national defense jobs, and injuries have
taken their toll on the Ducks.
And if you don't lliink the Oregon publicity men arc making the
most of the losses in order to get deeper into that underdog position,

probably the fastest man on the squad. Fawcett has all of the physical
requisites to handle the job, but he is as yet untried in varsity competi
tion. He will probably see some action Saturday, after which the coaches
may have a little clearer idea of what he can do under fire. It doesn't
appear that he will be threatening to move onto the first team for some
time to come. Nor would you expect him to, for he has three years of
competition to go and Armstrong and Ditlevsen aren't easy boys to beat out.

backfield that is scheduled to start the Oregon game doesn't appear
to be quite as well set in the speed department as the 1940 quartet was,
for, although Albert and Pete Kmetovic haven't slowed down any. Milt
Vucinich and Armstrong aren't quite the speed burners that Norm Stand
lee and Gallarneau were. This will probably be most noticeable at the
fullback spot, where Voos operates. The San Francisco boy just can't pick
up and move like the Chief could, but he has improved a great deal over
last year. Last spring Milt worked out on the track several times a week
to try to build up his speed, and he wasn't altogether unsuccessful.
Armstrong is no slow poke. In fact, he used to be a sprinter in
high school. But when he stepped into Gallarneau's shoes, he took on
a real load, for Hughie was one of the fastest hoys in Pacific Coast
football when he was packing the mail for the Indians. So even
though the backfield speed may not he as great as it was last year,
Stanford backs will he far from the slowest eleven in the P.C.C.
Speaking of Vucinich, as we were in a paragraph or so above, the
slashing Slav has been doing some outstanding work in the five scrim
mages the first team has participated in to date. His running is much bet
ter than ever before. He really drives now, whereas in the past he used
to spend a lot of time drifting and waiting for holes to open. The old drift
that is used so much in the Warner system just doesn't go in the "T"
attack, where a back has to get through a hole right now or not at all.
The change has made a world of difference in Vucinich.


TEX OLIVER
Vf/"HEN our Coach Clark Shaughnessy began to holler "we fear Ore
gon," he started something. Duck Mentor Tex Oliver didn't like it a
bit. And now he and Oregon's publicity director Bruce Hamby—who is
now in San Francisco to get the big city excited for the game this Satur
day—are screaming like the well-known eagles.
Shaughnessy said he expected the Webfoots to be great stuff this fall,
especially in their first few games. And we don't think he was just using
that as a psychological factor, either, for they really did have a squad
with lots of promise up Eugene way. Now, however, the picture has
changed somewhat, for the draft, national defense jobs, and injuries have
taken their toll on the Ducks.
And if you don't lliink the Oregon publicity men arc making the
most of the losses in order to get deeper into that underdog position,
you just haven't seen the press releases sent out hy the A.S.U.O.
news bureau. Not that we blame them, for actually the set-up isn't
too pretty. At any rate, the Card coaching staff has somewhat muffled
their "fear Oregon" screams; Oliver and Ilamby seem to have won
the fearing title for this round.
But Shaughnessy can start out this week in fine style again, for latest
developments find Frank Forbes scheduled to join Uncle Sam's outfit next
month. We just happened to be in Don Liebendorfer's office yesterday,
when the Redskin mentor stuck his head through the doorway to inform
all and sundry that "our second team quarterback has been drafted."
"He thought he had a couple of more months, anyway," Shaughnessy
said. "And he was our second-string man, too."
Forbes is the little 165-pounder from Los Angeles who played behind
Bob Mitchull on last year's undefeated frosh team. It took him a
while to get accustomed to the "T" formation attack (the Papooses
only used it a ltitle in '40), but last week ho was right in there bat
tling Kay Hammett for the honor of backing up Frank Albert. And.
from what Shaughnessy said yesterday, he must have moved in front

of the Stockton hoy.
The loss of Forbes leaves Ham
mett and Ray Durham as the num
ber two and three quarterbacks, re
spectively. Durham has been coming
fast this fall and has been put in
the category marked "new finds."
He played fullback behind Albert on
the 1938 frosh eleven but didn't
play football the next two seasons.
He has lots to learn about the intri
cate maneuvers required of the up
man in the "T," but he has a lot of
natural ability, especially in the
passing department.

A LTIIOUGH you never know
when Coach Clark is going to
change his mind, with our fingers
crossed, we'll say that it appears AL
MOST certain that Eric "Hoot"
Armstrong, the squat speedster from
Portland, will open at right halfback
against Oregon come this Saturday.
Bobby Ditlevesen, the made-over

right end, has shown a great deal of promise at the position, but "Hoot"
has the edge so far, having played the position as Hugh Gallarneau's under
study all last season.
True, it's going to be rather tough for Armstrong on defense, for knock
ing passes out of the hands of six-foot-six ends isn't any picnic for a
boy who goes only five feet seven into the air when he's got his heels off
the ground and his toes touching. But Armstrong works on the theory
that he can climb over them if necessary. And, above all, he has the spirit
that goes to make great gridders. No matter whether he is running in
scrimmage or just running plays, the little guy just goes for all he is
worth.
Only the other day out at practice, Assistant Coaches Jim Lawson
and Phil Bongtson. standing on the sidelines while the five teams that
make up the squad were"running plays, were heard to murmur some
thing like this:
"Look at that Armstrong go. Golly, he runs hard."
"Yeh, no matter if he is just decoying he moves in a hurry."
"Hoot" is going to have to keep on hustling to keep ahead of Ditlevsen,
for the Watsonville kid looks like a natural in the backfield. He's a fast
starter and a tricky runner. He runs with his knees high, with a short,
choppy stride that gives him plenty of deception and drive. That he is a
good defensive man goes without saying. You just don't play end if you
can't play defense, and "Dit" played lots of end last season.
In scrimmages that were the order of the day last week, Ditlevsen
has caught the collective eye of the coaching staff more than a little.
Evne last spring, Marchie Schwartz, the backfield coach, had an idea
that Bobby was due to play some good ball at one of the halfback
spots.
