# Heckscher's Orchestra Hays Tonight for Reg Day Dance
## 
### 
Everyone is going.
That's what the signs say. In the first get-together of the year, Stanford
will dance tonight in the Women's Gym to the music of Frnic Heckscher
and his orchestra at the Reg Dance, traditionally held at the end of every
Registration Day.
Upperclassmen will get a chance to renew acquaintances and frosh

will get their first taste of Farm
social life. The "tax" is $1 per couple
and dress is informal.
Ernie Heckscher, who will pro
vide "smooth" music from 9 to 12
o'clock, recently closed an engage
ment at the Mark Hopkins in San
Francisco.
SPONSORED BY CARDINALS
The dance, sponsored by Cardinals,
is under the chairmanship of Carl
Livingston. Last year's Reg Dance,
featuring the music of Byron Snow
and his Statesmen, drew a record
number of couples, and Livingston
and his committee are hoping to set
a new mark.
"Don't miss this one," warns Liv
ingston. "There'll be soft lights and
soft music and a marvelous chance
to get acquainted. Remember, this
is traditionally one of the liveliest
all-campus dances of the year."
FOR SPECIAL FUND
The receipts from the dance will
be turned over to a special fund cre
ated to pay off the principal on Stan
ford's $10,000 boathouse investment.
"Heckscher is playing for the
dance," says Livingston, "so what
does the "Mark" have that the Wom
en's Gym doesn't?" And remember
what the signs say:
Everyone is going.
