# Soccer Drills Start Thursday For '41 Season
## 
### 
Planning to enter two varsity
teams in competition this fall,
Harry Maloney, Farm soccer coach
of long standing, announced that the
first practice will be held Thursday
at 4:15.
Although the Pacific Coast Con
ence has changed its rules this year
making it legal for freshmen to play
on varsity teams, California and
Stanford will still continue to have
both freshman and varsity games.
The two colleges have been playing
intercollegiate soccer since 1910 and
they do not plan to change the tra
ditional games.
TO PLAY U.S.F.
The first scheduled game is set for
October 11 with the University of
San Francisco at Stanford. There is
no conference game scheduled for
October 18 so Harry Maloney is
making arrangements to play a team
from the British warships which are
in Mare Island for repairs.
There have been no scheduled
practices as yet, but graduation and
the draft have taken at least. 18 of
last year's varsity team. Among
these is Wilson Clark who was the
All-Coast halfback for the last two
years. Because of this loss Coach
Harry Maloney plans to rebuild his
team and to work out new combina
tions.
PHYSICAL EXAMS
Physical examinations for both
the freshman and the varsity teams
will be at 2:30 on Wednesday. Var
sity equipment will be issued at 3 on
Thursday. Freshman equipment will
be issued at the same time Friday
and they will hold their first prac
tice at 4:15 the same afternoon.
Charley and Luis Arismendi, stars
of last year's varsity squad, will be
the coaches of the freshman team.
The roll in freshman soccer is far
from filled and they are still looking
for freshmen interested in playing
soccer this fall.
