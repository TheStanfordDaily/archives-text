### United Press 
Although the New York Yankees
and Boston Red Sox have cinched
first and second spots in the Ameri
can League and Brooklyn and St.
Louis have grabbed the baseball
spotlight with their tight flag fight
in the National League, there's quite
a race developing in the junior cir
cuits' remaining two first division
spots.
Detroit climbed into a tie with
Cleveland for fourth place by trim
ming the third-place Chicago White
Sox, 11-8, while the St. Louis Browns
knocked off the Indians, 5-0. The
White Sox now hold only a half game
advantage over the deadlocked De
troit-Cleveland duo.
Johnny Niggeling held the Indians
to seven hits as the Browns belted
Bob Feller for five runs in the first
three innings to hand him his 13th
defeat. The Tigers hammered three
pitchers for 18 hits.
