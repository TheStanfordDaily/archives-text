# Helen Wills, Parker Star In Southland
## Kramer, Schroedel Win Five-Set Duel To Capture Doubles 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 22 (UP).—
Little Poker Face can still watch that
apple, the national men's doubles
champions are as unbeatable in the
West as in the East, and Francis L.
Kovacs II is as daffy and brilliant as
ever, in about equal parts.
These matters were proved yester
day in the windup of the Pacific
Southwest Tennis Championships
and about the only complaint of the
several thousand customers at the
Los Angeles Tennis Club was that
Mrs. Helen Wills Roark had not en
tered the singles.
Mrs. Roark, now 35, teamed with
Fred Schroeder of Glendale to win
the mixed doubles title from Mrs.
Sarah Palfrey Cooke of Boston and
Jack Kramer of Montebello, 13-11,
3-G, 6-2. Fans who watched Mrs.
Roark play when she was champion
of the world said that except for be
ing slightly slower in footwork, she
POWERFUL SERVE
PO// ERFUL SERVE
Her service, stroked from her cus
tomary high-thrown ball, was pow
erful and accurate. Back of the base
line, in mid-court or at the net, she
was virtually the same brilliant
player who ruled women's tennis
for a decade. Except for an infre
quent smile she played throughout
with the expressionless intensity
which earned her the nickname
"Little Poker Face."
Most spectacular match of the
tournament was the doubles final
which saw Schroeder and Kramer,
national champs in 1940 and 1941,
defeat Frankie Paraer of Altadena
and the eccentric Kovacs of Oakland,
6-3, 6-2, 2-6, 6-8, 9-7.
CIIAMPS WIN
The champions swept through the
first two sets in easy fashion and
came out for the kill in the third.
But Parker and Kovacs made a
sudden recovery and grabbed the
next set, 6-2, and followed with an
8-6 win. Kovacs' cat-like reflexes
gave him points on a series of seem
ingly impossible returns, then, serv
ing, he drove over three aces in a
row to make the count 7-6. On the
final game Kovacs and Parker broke
Kramer's service to take the set.
The deciding set went to 15 games
before either side broke service. The
champions finally got to Kovacs and
th customers started going home.
Schroeder won his next service and
the match was over.
PARKER CUTS KOVACS
In the men's singles Parker, na
tional clay courts champion, downed
Kovacs in straight sets, 7-5, 6-0, 6-1.
Kovacs led briefly in the first set but
lost to Parker's steady game, then
dawdled and clowned through the
remaining two sets.
Mrs. Cooke won the women's sin
gles title Irom Dorothy Bundy of
Santa Monica, 6-3, 7-5. In women's
doubles Mrs. Marjorie Van Ryn of
Austin, Tex., and Louise Brough of
Beverly Hills defeated Mars Arnold
and Gertrude Doekstader of Los An
geles, 6-2. 6-2. Mrs. Cooke and Mar
garet Osborne of San Francisco, who
reached semi-finals, defaulted to
Miss Arnold and Miss Doekstader.
Marchetta Donnelly of Venice won
the junior girls' singles from Ger
trude Moran, Santa Monica, 6-3,
6-2. Budge Patty of Los Angeles
won the junior boys' singles, de
feating Bob Falkenberg of Holly
wood. 6-8, 4-6, 6-4, G-3, 6-1. Don
ald Harris of Los Angeles won the
boys' singles title, defeating Ronald
Dunas of Los Angeles, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 22 (UP).—
Little Poker Face can still watch that
apple, the national men's doubles
champions are as unbeatable in the
West as in the East, and Francis L.
Kovacs II is as daffy and brilliant as
ever, in about equal parts.
These matters were proved yester
day in the windup of the Pacific
Southwest Tennis Championships
and about the only complaint of the
several thousand customers at the
Los Angeles Tennis Club was that
Mrs. Helen Wills Roark had not en
tered the singles.
Mrs. Roark, now 35, teamed with
Fred Schroeder of Glendale to win
the mixed doubles title from Mrs.
Sarah Palfrey Cooke of Boston and
Jack Kramer of Montebello, 13-11,
3-G, 6-2. Fans who watched Mrs.
Roark play when she was champion
of the world said that except for be
ing slightly slower in footwork, she
POWERFUL SERVE
PO// ERFUL SERVE
Her service, stroked from her cus
tomary high-thrown ball, was pow
erful and accurate. Back of the base
line, in mid-court or at the net, she
was virtually the same brilliant
player who ruled women's tennis
for a decade. Except for an infre
quent smile she played throughout
with the expressionless intensity
which earned her the nickname
"Little Poker Face."
Most spectacular match of the
tournament was the doubles final
which saw Schroeder and Kramer,
national champs in 1940 and 1941,
defeat Frankie Paraer of Altadena
and the eccentric Kovacs of Oakland,
6-3, 6-2, 2-6, 6-8, 9-7.
CIIAMPS WIN
The champions swept through the
first two sets in easy fashion and
came out for the kill in the third.
But Parker and Kovacs made a
sudden recovery and grabbed the
next set, 6-2, and followed with an
8-6 win. Kovacs' cat-like reflexes
gave him points on a series of seem
ingly impossible returns, then, serv
ing, he drove over three aces in a
row to make the count 7-6. On the
final game Kovacs and Parker broke
Kramer's service to take the set.
The deciding set went to 15 games
before either side broke service. The
champions finally got to Kovacs and
th customers started going home.
Schroeder won his next service and
the match was over.
