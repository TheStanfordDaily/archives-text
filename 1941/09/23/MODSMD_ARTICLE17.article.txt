# Stocking Problem Up to Conference
## 
### 
That Women's Conference is the
group to clear up the status of the
siik-stockings-on-the-Quad tradi
tion was the statement made recently
by Dean of Women Mary Yost.
She predicted, however, that, in
view of present world conditions,
Conference would have little choice
but to remove any objections to short
socks on the Quad. Although no
formal rule ever forbade bare legs
on the inner Quad, tradition decreed
that long stockings were always
worn.
One senior sponsor several years
ago explained it to her freshmen
charges in this way: "Of course you
can wear short socks, but it just isn't
done." And, until recently, it hasn't
been.
But with the current silk shortage,
"what wasn't done, must be done."
Miss Yost believes the choice will be
left up to the individual women stu
dents to make but hopes that they
will continue to be guided by what
is appropriate.
