# FARM GETS NEW BOOSTERS

### ANN BROKAW NORM KING 
fflTic Daily presents below the first impressions Stanford made on two typical freshmen during (he three
day Ire-Registration program, which was climaxed by a barbecue Sunday night.—The Editor)

It s.ddenly dawned on me that I was on the Farm
at last How did I get here, I asked myself. But I
didn't much of a chance to ponder the ques
tion. the instant of our arrival we've been busy
meetin -within the space of a few hours—more peo
ple we've ever met before.
Star lord's about the friendliest place I've ever
been! Honestly, you Westerners! It's hullo and a new
friend. Another thing which impressed me was the
genuini incerity with which Dean Yost and Sylvia
Berry a n our sponsors welcomed us .. . the way
they vc seen to it that we meet one another, and
that wo are entertained, that we have dates, that we
have ft ~ in short, that we become almost imme
diately p ar t of Stanford. If you've ever experienced
the agori es D f hazing, this sort of thing is tremendous.
The xchange dinner and the jolly-up were great
. . . woricrful tradition . . . especially when the uppcr
classmer persist in coming (no insult to the freshmen)
in spite >r the valiant efforts of Norm Ross to keep
"thoso, r ,},e e i s " out. But then when you do a thing
twice (hd "those heels" always turn up so I hear)
it's trad ir,n anyway, isn't it?
The w,st awesome part of the pre-rcg program was
the ass* ihly in Memorial Hall . . . and the picket
ing aftc wards. I was overwhelmed at the size of
the Cla. () f '45 and for a minute felt at a loss to
undeiHtfcirj how they all seemed already so enthusias
tic and so at home. It wasn't hard to understand
when l'< been around another twenty-four hours.
It wa hard for any of us, I guess.

Right now I'm dangling my legs over Encina's fifth
floor fire escape with a weather eye out for my spon
sor. I have an idea he won't appreciate my choice of
perch. As I watch the sunset sift behind the Coast
Range, I'm digesting the still incredible fact that I'm
at Stanford.
Most of you fellows and girls have been planning
for the "Farm" ever since you were knee high to the
Hoover War Libe. Back in N.Y., my home state, the
closest most people get to the West is a effwboy movie.
Actually the only Indian here seems to be the Stan
ford Indian, a comic little guy who sits serenely on
your windshield.
When I first got here, I wasn't awfully sure of my
self or of Stanford either. I'd some 7500 miles through
the Panama Canal on a boat that was hotter and
dirtier than a chimney pipe. It was a long way to
come—even to a college, and I wasn't sure.
Since then, I've heard Dr. Wilbur speak. I wish I
could quote his words for they made a tremendous
impression on all of us. He made every one of those
7500 miles seem important.
I could talk for hours about the amazing honor
code or the "hello'" tradition that's so surprising and
encouraging to us strangers. I admire the outside of
Stanford but it's that inner core which gave me a
funny sort of proud feeling after I'd been here a while.
They may go around shouting "to hell with '45" but
we know they don't mean it. I have an idea the whole
school is pulling for the frosh to make good. It's be
cause we're Stanford men and women all together . . .

Actually the only Indian here seems to be the Stan
ford Indian, a comic little guy who sits serenely on
your windshield.
When I first got here, I wasn't awfully sure of my
self or of Stanford either. I'd some 7500 miles through
the Panama Canal on a boat that was hotter and
dirtier than a chimney pipe. It was a long way to
come—even to a college, and I wasn't sure.
Since then, I've heard Dr. Wilbur speak. I wish I
could quote his words for they made a tremendous
impression on all of us. He made every one of those
7500 miles seem important.
I could talk for hours about the amazing honor
code or the "hello'" tradition that's so surprising and
encouraging to us strangers. I admire the outside of
Stanford but it's that inner core which gave me a
funny sort of proud feeling after I'd been here a while.
They may go around shouting "to hell with '45" but
we know they don't mean it. I have an idea the whole
school is pulling for the frosh to make good. It's be
cause we're Stanford men and women all together . . .

It s.ddenly dawned on me that I was on the Farm
at last How did I get here, I asked myself. But I
didn't much of a chance to ponder the ques
tion. the instant of our arrival we've been busy
meetin -within the space of a few hours—more peo
ple we've ever met before.
Star lord's about the friendliest place I've ever
been! Honestly, you Westerners! It's hullo and a new
friend. Another thing which impressed me was the
genuini incerity with which Dean Yost and Sylvia
Berry a n our sponsors welcomed us .. . the way
they vc seen to it that we meet one another, and
that wo are entertained, that we have dates, that we
have ft ~ in short, that we become almost imme
diately p ar t of Stanford. If you've ever experienced
the agori es D f hazing, this sort of thing is tremendous.
The xchange dinner and the jolly-up were great
. . . woricrful tradition . . . especially when the uppcr
classmer persist in coming (no insult to the freshmen)
in spite >r the valiant efforts of Norm Ross to keep
"thoso, r ,},e e i s " out. But then when you do a thing
twice (hd "those heels" always turn up so I hear)
it's trad ir,n anyway, isn't it?
The w,st awesome part of the pre-rcg program was
the ass* ihly in Memorial Hall . . . and the picket
ing aftc wards. I was overwhelmed at the size of
the Cla. () f '45 and for a minute felt at a loss to
undeiHtfcirj how they all seemed already so enthusias
tic and so at home. It wasn't hard to understand
when l'< been around another twenty-four hours.
It wa hard for any of us, I guess.

Right now I'm dangling my legs over Encina's fifth
floor fire escape with a weather eye out for my spon
sor. I have an idea he won't appreciate my choice of
perch. As I watch the sunset sift behind the Coast

at Stanford.

The xchange dinner and the jolly-up were great
. . . woricrful tradition . . . especially when the uppcr
classmer persist in coming (no insult to the freshmen)
in spite >r the valiant efforts of Norm Ross to keep
"thoso, r ,},e e i s " out. But then when you do a thing
twice (hd "those heels" always turn up so I hear)
it's trad ir,n anyway, isn't it?
The w,st awesome part of the pre-rcg program was
the ass* ihly in Memorial Hall . . . and the picket
ing aftc wards. I was overwhelmed at the size of
the Cla. () f '45 and for a minute felt at a loss to
undeiHtfcirj how they all seemed already so enthusias
tic and so at home. It wasn't hard to understand
when l'< been around another twenty-four hours.
It wa hard for any of us, I guess.

Right now I'm dangling my legs over Encina's fifth
floor fire escape with a weather eye out for my spon
sor. I have an idea he won't appreciate my choice of
perch. As I watch the sunset sift behind the Coast
Range, I'm digesting the still incredible fact that I'm
at Stanford.
Most of you fellows and girls have been planning
for the "Farm" ever since you were knee high to the
Hoover War Libe. Back in N.Y., my home state, the
closest most people get to the West is a effwboy movie.
Actually the only Indian here seems to be the Stan
ford Indian, a comic little guy who sits serenely on
your windshield.
When I first got here, I wasn't awfully sure of my
self or of Stanford either. I'd some 7500 miles through
the Panama Canal on a boat that was hotter and
dirtier than a chimney pipe. It was a long way to
come—even to a college, and I wasn't sure.
Since then, I've heard Dr. Wilbur speak. I wish I
could quote his words for they made a tremendous
impression on all of us. He made every one of those
7500 miles seem important.
I could talk for hours about the amazing honor
code or the "hello'" tradition that's so surprising and
encouraging to us strangers. I admire the outside of
Stanford but it's that inner core which gave me a
funny sort of proud feeling after I'd been here a while.
They may go around shouting "to hell with '45" but
we know they don't mean it. I have an idea the whole
school is pulling for the frosh to make good. It's be
cause we're Stanford men and women all together . . .
