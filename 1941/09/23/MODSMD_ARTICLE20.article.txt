Chicago, Sept. 22. — (U.R) — The
America first Committee yesterday
reaffirmed its sponsorship of Charles
A. Lindbergh in a series of addresses
beginning with Lindbergh's appear
ance at Fort Wayne, Ind., Oct. 3.
The announcement followed a
meeting of the organization's execu
tive committee last week to consider
Lindbergh's recent Des Moines, la.,
speech which some quarters de
nounced as anti-semitic.
