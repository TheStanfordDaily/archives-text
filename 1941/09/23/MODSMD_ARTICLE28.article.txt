# New Courses To Be Offered
## 
### 
According to announcements from
the language departments, three
courses not listed in the Time Sched
ule will be offered fall quarter. Two
German conversation courses, 851
and 852, will be continued, while
a course in elementary Icelandic will
be introduced for the first time at
Stanford.
Taught hy L. L. Bjarnason, the
Icelandic class will be non-special
ized and is open to all interested
students. The course is tentatively
scheduled for three units, and will
be given MWF at eight in Room 111.
However, if there is a demand for
different arrangements, hours and
credits can be changed.
Because of the current interest of
the United States in Iceland, this
course is particularly timely, accord
ing to the department announce
ment. It also states that young
Americans stationed in that country
will find it to their advantage to
have an understanding of the fun
damentals of the language.
Of the courses in the Department
of Germanic Languages, 851 is open
to those who have had one year of
college or two years of high school
German. 852, which may be taken
more than once, is open to those
who have had 851.
Both courses are scheduled to
meet twice a week, day and hour by
arrangement. As in the past, the
courses will be conducted in a num
ber of small sections to allow for
greater freedom in the choice of
meeting time and place.
Interested students are asked to
see Mr. McKenzie, Room 117, De
partment of Germanic Languages.
