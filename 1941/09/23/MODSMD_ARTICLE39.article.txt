# Co-op Exchange Gives Students Lowest Prices
## Co-operative Offers Percentage Rebate For Each Purchase 
### 
A can't-be-put-off necessity at the
beginning of each quarter is the
buying of new textbooks. So starting
today and on throughout the week,
students will beat a path to the Co
op Exchange and do their best to
reach the head of the line at the
Bookstore.
For the benefit of new students
and old students whose memories
of bookstores are somewhat ob
scured by summer vacation, Room
15 the Old Union is headquarters for
the Co-op non-profit Book Ex
change. "An organization," accord
ing to Manager Don Spickard, "that
is designed to aid the students in
every way possible. Where students
may buy texts directly from other
students at a minimum of cost."
Starting today and throughout
this week, the Exchange will be
open from 9 to 11:30 in the morn
ings and from 1:30 to -i*3o in the
afternoon. After this week hours
will be during the afternoons only.
NON-PROFIT BASIS
Old books are bought and sold on
a non-profit consignment basis. The
organization gives 65 per cent to
the owner—their nearest competi
tor gives only 50 per cent —and sells
for 10 per cent more. Profits go
toward the maintenance of the or
ganization, which is owned and op
erated by students. Those working
in the office receive no pay.
Econ and poly sci books are traded
the most as books are changed of
tener in other departments. "The
sooner your books are brought in
the quicker they may be sold," ad
vises Fran Brown, acting president
this year.
Student body Lost and Found of
fices are held in connection with the
Co-op Exchange and any students
wanting to help out with either
organization will be welcomed.
ALSO A CO-OPERATIVE
Across the street from Union is
the familiar Stanford Bookstore,
where paper, pencils, and new
books may be purchased. Another
co-operative, the Bookstore gives
the student a rebate slip with each
purchase, which at the end of the
year nets a corresponding percentage
of Bookstore profits.

Extra help taken on at the begin
ning of the quarter will cut down
the waiting period for books this
year. But the Bookstore warns, "If
you want quick service, know the
title and author of the book you
are after." Frosh should take this
warning to heart, for their texts are
usually the most in demand at this
time of year. Bookstore hours are
7:45 to 5:15.

wanting to help out with either
organization will be welcomed.
ALSO A CO-OPERATIVE
Across the street from Union is
the familiar Stanford Bookstore,
where paper, pencils, and new
books may be purchased. Another
co-operative, the Bookstore gives
the student a rebate slip with each
purchase, which at the end of the
year nets a corresponding percentage
of Bookstore profits.

Extra help taken on at the begin
ning of the quarter will cut down
the waiting period for books this
year. But the Bookstore warns, "If
you want quick service, know the
title and author of the book you
are after." Frosh should take this
warning to heart, for their texts are
usually the most in demand at this
time of year. Bookstore hours are
7:45 to 5:15.
A can't-be-put-off necessity at the
beginning of each quarter is the
buying of new textbooks. So starting
today and on throughout the week,
students will beat a path to the Co
op Exchange and do their best to
reach the head of the line at the
Bookstore.
For the benefit of new students
and old students whose memories
of bookstores are somewhat ob
scured by summer vacation, Room
15 the Old Union is headquarters for
the Co-op non-profit Book Ex
change. "An organization," accord
ing to Manager Don Spickard, "that
is designed to aid the students in
every way possible. Where students
may buy texts directly from other
students at a minimum of cost."
Starting today and throughout
this week, the Exchange will be
open from 9 to 11:30 in the morn
ings and from 1:30 to -i*3o in the
afternoon. After this week hours
will be during the afternoons only.
NON-PROFIT BASIS
Old books are bought and sold on
a non-profit consignment basis. The
organization gives 65 per cent to
the owner—their nearest competi
tor gives only 50 per cent —and sells
for 10 per cent more. Profits go
toward the maintenance of the or
ganization, which is owned and op
erated by students. Those working
in the office receive no pay.
Econ and poly sci books are traded
the most as books are changed of
tener in other departments. "The
sooner your books are brought in
the quicker they may be sold," ad
vises Fran Brown, acting president
this year.
Student body Lost and Found of
fices are held in connection with the
Co-op Exchange and any students
wanting to help out with either
organization will be welcomed.
