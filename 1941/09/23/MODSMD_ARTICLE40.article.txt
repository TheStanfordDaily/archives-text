# Pledges Clean Up Fraternity Lawns
## 
### 
Of the fraternity pledges who ar
rived on the campus early for house
cleaning and lawn mowing, the first
to hit the Row were Phi Kaps and
Delta Chis. They were barging in as
early as the Bth, with the noble pur
pose of getting the annual overhaul
ing done before they had anything
else to do. So they pitched inâ€”a
little at a time. Their favorite after
noon diversion was pass football, and
their games came to a climax on the
17th, when they played to a 0-0
deadlock.

Although they spent as much time
trampling the grass as they did trim
ming it, their head start produced
the desired results. Their houses and
lawns are in order.
