# Bombers Swarm Over Europe In Blistering British Offensive
## 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 22 (UP).â€”British
bombers swarmed across the south
east coast today, resuming their
bombardment of occupied Europe
after bad weather had interrupted
a 44-hour week-end offensive be
lieved the heaviest and most sus
tained yet undertaken by the Royal
Air Force.

With clearing skies, big formations
of bombers screened by fighters
roared across the English Channel
at regular intervals for nearly an
hour, while watchers in coastal
towns cheered and waved.
SPITFIRES DOWN
The vanguard of escorting Spit
fires and Hurricanes returned as the
drone of the last outward-bound
bomber faded in the distance. Some

Spitfires returned singly or in pairs,
indicating some of their number may
have been shot down.

The virtually non-stop week-end
offensive was halted last night by
inclement weather over the conti
nent. In the preceding 44 hours, GOO
to 800 bombers and fighters were
said to have participated in raids
that included Berlin, Frankfort and
Stettin, the latter Germany's third
port and chief shipping point for
supplies to the Eastern Front.
The British claimed that 39 Ger
man planes were destroyed against
the loss of 20 British fighters and
nine bombers.
British air observers reviewing the
week-end claimed:
1. Britain lost only 3 to 5 per cent

of her participating raiders com
pared to the Luftwaffe's 37 per cent
in mass daylight raids on Britain in
September 1940 and nearly 10 per
cent in the last night air "blitz" on
London May 10.

2. Royal Air Force fighter screens
were almost entirely successful in
protecting daylight bombers and
preventing Mosserschmitts from
breaking up formations, in contrast
to the manner in which Spitfires and
Hurricanes scattered and destroyed
Dorniers and Juniers in the Battle
of Britain.

3. In some daylight sweeps Sat
urday and Sunday, Blenheims found
no fighter opposition and hammered
objectives at will while fighters re
mained overhead.
