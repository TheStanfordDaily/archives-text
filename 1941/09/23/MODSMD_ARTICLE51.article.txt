# Palo Alto May Get New Radio Station
## 
### 
Indicating a willingness to meet
the request, the Palo Alto city coun
cil recently directed the execution
of a 90-day option to Palo Alto Radio
Station, Inc., for lease of a five-acre
site on Matadero flood basin land at
the bay front, in the event the Fed
eral Communications Commission
grants the petition for establishing
such a broadcasting station.

Under the conditions laid down,
no expense would devolve on the city
which would retain use of the land
for flood basin purposes and mos
quito abatement. Rental would be
$25 a month, and the city would be
entitled to radio time.
