# Senator's Talk Defends 'Lindy'
## 'No Anti-Semitism In Speech,' Says Nye 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 22 (UP).â€”Sen.
Gerald P. Nye, R., N.D., said tonight
there is not a shred of anti-Semitic
spirit in the mind and heart of
Charles- A. Lindbergh, Sen. Burton
K. Wheeler or himself and blamed
interventionists, particularly Wen
dell L. Willkie, for dragging "this
red herring" into the war contro
versy.

"Mr. Willkie has done his utmost
to smear the cause of non-inter
vention with this anti-Semitic stick,"
he said. "Racial prejudice must have
no place in our make-up in an hour
like this."
He spoke at an America First
Committee meeting at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music which was heav
ily guarded by 500 policemen and
which had attracted more than nor
mal interest because former City
Magistrate Joseph Goldstein an
nounced he would seek to have Nye
arrested if Nye reaffirmed approval
of Lindbergh's Des Moines speech.
It was reported that the unusually
large police detail was ordered as a
precautionary measure based on re
ports that Jewish residents of Brook
lyn resented calling of the meeting
on a Jewish holiday.
Nye's statement concerning anti-
Semitism was considered his answer
to charges that Lindbergh had in
jected racial prejudice into the war
controversy in his Des Moines
speech.
