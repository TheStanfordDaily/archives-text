# Drama Manager Opens Year With Appeal for Tryoutees
## 
### 
With a strident call for tryoutees,
Dramatic Manager Bill Moran has
opened shop on the business end of
Ram's Head.
Ram's Head is the organization
which puts on all student dramatics
—that is, productions run completely
by students—and it is in the potent
position of purse-holder that Moran
seeks aid. The job of tryoutees in
the dramatic manager's office is var
ied and interesting. There is much
office work to be done. This in
cludes publicity, typing, and mimeo
graphing scripts. In addition, try
outees will find many things to do
over at the theater itself.
The dramatic manager's job is
connected with the business man
agement of all student productions.
He is the man who conducts ticket
sales, hands out requisitions for all
equipment, and in general keeps his
eye on the purse strings of all Ram's

Head work.
In return the dramatic manager
collects approximately $225 a year
for his efforts.
Hiere is no experience required in
order to serve the year's apprentice
ship for this post. All students, both
men and women, are sought for this
job, though sophomores and juniors
are particularly wanted. Appoint
ment of the new dramatic manager
Ls made each June by his predeces
sor and is purely on a merit basis.
