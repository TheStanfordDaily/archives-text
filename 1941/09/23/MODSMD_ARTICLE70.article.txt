â€”Gerry Nugent, president of the
Nationl League Phillies, said yester
day he had turned down an offer to
purchase the baseball club that was
made last week by John B. "Jack"
Kelly on behalf of a syndicate he
heads.
Kelly, U.S. Director of National
Physical Training for Physical Fit
ness, mailed the offer last week say

one." Neither Nugent nor Kelly dis
closed tiie amount of the bid.

Since the war has started, fewer
people have died in England, due to
extra precautions people now take.
