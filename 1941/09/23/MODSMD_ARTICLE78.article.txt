# Defense Program Imperiled On Two Major Labor Fronts
## 
### 
The national defense program was
imperiled on two major fronts Mon
day night as strike ballots were or
dered among 20,000 sailors at 14
American ports and at a California
aircraft plant employing 23,000
workers.
The Seafarers' International Un
ion (A.F.L.) called meetings at the
14 cities to consider a general strike
as an outgrowth of their demand for
wage bonuses on excursions into
"dangerous" waters. A walk-out be
gun nine days ago already has tied
up ships at Boston, New York, New
Orleans, and Mobile.

The U.S. Maritime Commission
commandeered three freighters and
dispatched them to West Indies de
fense bases, and threatened to seize
other strike-bound ships.

The Pacific Coast Seamen's Union
has signified sympathy for the A.F.L.
Seafarers' cause, endangering inter
coastal shipping from ports in Cali
fornia and Washington. The strike
would affect 25 shipping lines.

Among 211,000 employees of the
Consolidated Aircraft Company's
huge bomber plant, ballots were 01-
deru'l th'it might affect $700,000,000
worth of military orders.

The A.F.L. Machinists' Union con
ducted the vote to reinforce its de
mand for bargaining rights and an
average 10 cents hourly wage gain
to effect a minimum of 75 cents
hourly. The union charged the man
agement with stalling and said the
National Defense Mediation Board
had failed to intervene.

Most of the 43,000 C.1.0. Mine
Workers who had closed "captive"
foft coal pits of major steel firms in
three states last week returned
their jobs Monday under a 30-day
truce pending government mediation
of their closed shop demands.

dered among 20,000 sailors at 14
American ports and at a California
aircraft plant employing 23,000
workers.
The Seafarers' International Un
ion (A.F.L.) called meetings at the
14 cities to consider a general strike
as an outgrowth of their demand for
wage bonuses on excursions into
"dangerous" waters. A walk-out be
gun nine days ago already has tied
up ships at Boston, New York, New
Orleans, and Mobile.

The U.S. Maritime Commission
commandeered three freighters and
dispatched them to West Indies de
fense bases, and threatened to seize
other strike-bound ships.

The Pacific Coast Seamen's Union
has signified sympathy for the A.F.L.
Seafarers' cause, endangering inter
coastal shipping from ports in Cali
fornia and Washington. The strike
would affect 25 shipping lines.

Among 211,000 employees of the
Consolidated Aircraft Company's
huge bomber plant, ballots were 01-
deru'l th'it might affect $700,000,000
worth of military orders.

The A.F.L. Machinists' Union con
ducted the vote to reinforce its de
mand for bargaining rights and an
average 10 cents hourly wage gain
to effect a minimum of 75 cents
hourly. The union charged the man
agement with stalling and said the
National Defense Mediation Board
had failed to intervene.

Most of the 43,000 C.1.0. Mine
Workers who had closed "captive"
foft coal pits of major steel firms in
three states last week returned
their jobs Monday under a 30-day
truce pending government mediation
of their closed shop demands.
