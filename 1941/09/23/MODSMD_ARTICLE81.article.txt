# McCune to Head W.A.A. This Year
## 
### 
The Women's Athletic Association
(W.A.A.) will be carried on under
the leadership of Mary Helen Mc-
Cune. She will be assisted by Eliza
beth Tanner, vice-president; Jean
ette Boynton, secretary; and Shirley
Wendt, treasurer.
This organization appropriated the
money for two new tennis courts
which have been built during the
summer. These two courts are pri
marily for recreation, not classes,
and can only be used by Stanford
women. An official opening will take
place soon after registration.
All classes given spring quarter,
except for canoeing, will be open
for women athletes. Added to the
list will be dry skiing. This quarter
the skis are manipulated on hay, but
because the equipment will be in
use during the next quarter, only a
conditioning class will be given in
winter.
