# No Ambulances For Paly Hospital
## 
### 
Confirming the recommendation
of its committee on safety, the Palo
Alto city council recently voted
against handling emergency ambu
lance service through the Palo Alto
Hospital, a plan that had been sug
gested by the bohrd of safety.
At the same time Councilman Ed
ward P. Cashel volunteered to see
what can be done toward increasing
the sum allowed the local hospital by
the county for handling emergency
cases of persons who do not live in
the city. He agreed to do so after
Councilman Earl C. Thomas declared
that the San Jose Hospital is receiv
ing "considerably more" than is Palo
Alto for treating injured individuals
brought in "from the highway."
Councilman Thoits reinforced his
colleague's statement by referring to
recent data showing large contribu
tions by Palo Alto to the county in
firmary fund.
