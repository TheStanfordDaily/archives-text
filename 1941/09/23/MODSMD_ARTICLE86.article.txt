### 
ROME. Sept. 22.—((U.R))—Travel
ers leaving Italy no longer will be
permitted to take personal jewelry
with them, it was announced today.
The jewelry will be deposited with
Italian customs officials at the fron
tiers and will he returned when the
owner returns to Italy.

The new measure supplements a
recent decree which forbade sale of
jewelry inside Italy or its export
abroad. Persons entering Italy here
after also will have to leave their
jewels at the frontier and collect
them when they leave.

The Chinese "incident" was five
years old this summer.
