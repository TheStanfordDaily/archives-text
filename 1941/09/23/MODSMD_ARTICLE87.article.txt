## Elsass to Conduct Group Temporarily 
### 
Promising to put out at its "loud
est and best," the Stanford band is
organizing for what should prove to
be its biggest season. The reason,
of course, is that rumor on the Farm

stadium turf next Saturday. And
this means band music that will
match the team in sparkle and pep.

rector, will not return this year, since
he has taken a teaching position at
Cul Aggies. Mr. Frank Elsass, a
teacher at San Jose State and di

porarily taken Bubb's place until a
permanent director for the Farm
musical group can fce found. Mean
while, Mr. Elsass, who was for
merly solo trumpeteer of the Gold
man band in New York City, will
take the Stanford musicians through
their paces. •

last year's solid group are returning
and when the band steps out onto
the field Saturday it will also in
clude a sizeable group of freshmen
who have proven their ability dur
ing the week. Calls have already
gone out to most promising frosh
