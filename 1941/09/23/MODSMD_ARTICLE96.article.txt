# Hello and Goodbye
## 
### 
THIS guy Brucker always was a great one for
setting records. Even in the third grade he
set an all-time mark for manufacturing spitballs
while the teacher was out of the room.
And now, as a fitting climax, he sets a mark
for future Daily Associate Editors to shoot at
in days to come. Just try and beat a one-day
tenure in the job, fellas; just try that for brevity.
Well, Uncle Sammy says that's the way it
is, so that's the way it is. The band will now
softly waft the strains of "I've Been Drafted, Now
I'm Drafting You," for come October 7 Brucker
will be a symphony in brown, or, if you prefer,
khaki

Now hark ye, chilluns, to a few words of
wisdom from one who will soon know all—all,
that is, that noncoms, shavetails, and other as
sorted ranks can cram into a head already over
flowing with sundry hunks of "higher knowl
edge."
According to form, of course, this space
should be filled with a plaintive plea to the
powers that be, and a bewildered questioning
of the wisdom of yanking a man out of his last
year at college to shove a rifle in his hands and
give him an advanced course in peeling spuds.
If that's what you expect here, forget it.
There are a good many of us who sneer, in
wardly at least, when the flag of patriotism is
waved. "Make the world safe for Democracy?"
Shucks, we've heard that one before.

But did you ever stop and take a look around
you at the country we live in? There's some
justification for referring to Stanford's "Ivory
Tower" attitude, as none knows better than y.t.,
but let's take a peek outside, just a short one.
According to the accepted figures, some
where. upwards of a hundred and thirty million
people live in this land of ours. All but a very
few, when they stop to look around, will admit
that they're pretty well off. They have food,
shelter, and, though it may not seem so at times,
the right to govern themselves.
Even the small minority who have a rough
time of it over here, the small minority of a few
millions that has to depend on the rest of the
nation for support, lives the life of Riley in
comparison with their equals and many supe
riors in Europe.

Stating it frankly, then, we're giving all aid to
Britain and Russia to maintain this situation, and
to prevent another, very different situation—a
situation which would have the free men and
women of America kowtowing to Nazi rulers.
And in spite of Colonel Lindbergh, such a
situation is possible. While admiring Lindbergh
for his guts in saying what he believes, it is
only common sense that as long as there's the
slightest chance that things may turn out Hit
ler's way, we must fight to preserve what we
have, and brother, I mean fight. (With apolo
gies to both Saroyans for use of the word
"brother.")

There's no use deluding ourselves on that
score, inspite of all commendable ideas and
ideals to the contrary, this army that's being
built up is going to see action before this is over
The chips are down.

There are other things that should be dis
cussed at just as great length as the foregoing.
One is the reprehensible attitude taken by most
civilians toward the men in the ranks. Another
is the cursed blight on defense industries of

strikes and similar labor agitation. But that's for
someone else to beef about, someone more qual
ified to speak on the subject.
So there you have the word from the guy in
the sandwich. That's it, and that's all of it, for
Bull for the chance to say it. Perhaps few will
Bull for the cliance to say it. Perhaps few will
read it, and even fewer will pay any heed. But
there should be some frosh who haven't ac
quired the habit of skipping the edits, and
they're the ones who really count now.
In parting, if there be any among you who
intend to do some booming between now and
October 7, give me a buzz. 'Cause I've got just
two weeks to live, and brother, I mean live.—

Stating it frankly, then, we're giving all aid to
Britain and Russia to maintain this situation, and
to prevent another, very different situation—a
situation which would have the free men and
women of America kowtowing to Nazi rulers.
And in spite of Colonel Lindbergh, such a
situation is possible. While admiring Lindbergh
for his guts in saying what he believes, it is
only common sense that as long as there's the
slightest chance that things may turn out Hit
ler's way, we must fight to preserve what we
have, and brother, I mean fight. (With apolo
gies to both Saroyans for use of the word
"brother.")

There's no use deluding ourselves on that

ideals to the contrary, this army that's being
built up is going to see action before this is over

There are other things that should be dis

One is the reprehensible attitude taken by most
civilians toward the men in the ranks. Another
is the cursed blight on defense industries of

strikes and similar labor agitation. But that's for
someone else to beef about, someone more qual

THIS guy Brucker always was a great one for
setting records. Even in the third grade he
set an all-time mark for manufacturing spitballs
while the teacher was out of the room.
And now, as a fitting climax, he sets a mark
for future Daily Associate Editors to shoot at
in days to come. Just try and beat a one-day
tenure in the job, fellas; just try that for brevity.
Well, Uncle Sammy says that's the way it
is, so that's the way it is. The band will now
softly waft the strains of "I've Been Drafted, Now
I'm Drafting You," for come October 7 Brucker
will be a symphony in brown, or, if you prefer,
khaki

Now hark ye, chilluns, to a few words of
wisdom from one who will soon know all—all,
that is, that noncoms, shavetails, and other as
sorted ranks can cram into a head already over
flowing with sundry hunks of "higher knowl
edge."
According to form, of course, this space
should be filled with a plaintive plea to the
powers that be, and a bewildered questioning
of the wisdom of yanking a man out of his last
year at college to shove a rifle in his hands and
give him an advanced course in peeling spuds.
If that's what you expect here, forget it.
There are a good many of us who sneer, in
wardly at least, when the flag of patriotism is
waved. "Make the world safe for Democracy?"
Shucks, we've heard that one before.

But did you ever stop and take a look around
you at the country we live in? There's some
justification for referring to Stanford's "Ivory
Tower" attitude, as none knows better than y.t.,
but let's take a peek outside, just a short one.
According to the accepted figures, some
where. upwards of a hundred and thirty million
people live in this land of ours. All but a very
few, when they stop to look around, will admit
that they're pretty well off. They have food,
shelter, and, though it may not seem so at times,
the right to govern themselves.
Even the small minority who have a rough
time of it over here, the small minority of a few
millions that has to depend on the rest of the
nation for support, lives the life of Riley in

riors in Europe.

tenure in the job, fellas; just try that for brevity.
Well, Uncle Sammy says that's the way it
is, so that's the way it is. The band will now
softly waft the strains of "I've Been Drafted, Now
I'm Drafting You," for come October 7 Brucker
will be a symphony in brown, or, if you prefer,
khaki

Now hark ye, chilluns, to a few words of
wisdom from one who will soon know all—all,
that is, that noncoms, shavetails, and other as
sorted ranks can cram into a head already over
flowing with sundry hunks of "higher knowl
edge."
According to form, of course, this space
should be filled with a plaintive plea to the
powers that be, and a bewildered questioning
of the wisdom of yanking a man out of his last
year at college to shove a rifle in his hands and
give him an advanced course in peeling spuds.
If that's what you expect here, forget it.
There are a good many of us who sneer, in
wardly at least, when the flag of patriotism is
waved. "Make the world safe for Democracy?"
Shucks, we've heard that one before.

But did you ever stop and take a look around
you at the country we live in? There's some
justification for referring to Stanford's "Ivory
Tower" attitude, as none knows better than y.t.,
but let's take a peek outside, just a short one.
According to the accepted figures, some
where. upwards of a hundred and thirty million
people live in this land of ours. All but a very
few, when they stop to look around, will admit
that they're pretty well off. They have food,
shelter, and, though it may not seem so at times,
the right to govern themselves.
Even the small minority who have a rough
time of it over here, the small minority of a few
millions that has to depend on the rest of the
nation for support, lives the life of Riley in
comparison with their equals and many supe
riors in Europe.

Stating it frankly, then, we're giving all aid to
Britain and Russia to maintain this situation, and
to prevent another, very different situation—a
situation which would have the free men and
women of America kowtowing to Nazi rulers.
And in spite of Colonel Lindbergh, such a
situation is possible. While admiring Lindbergh
for his guts in saying what he believes, it is
only common sense that as long as there's the
slightest chance that things may turn out Hit
ler's way, we must fight to preserve what we
have, and brother, I mean fight. (With apolo
gies to both Saroyans for use of the word
"brother.")

There's no use deluding ourselves on that
score, inspite of all commendable ideas and
ideals to the contrary, this army that's being
built up is going to see action before this is over
The chips are down.

There are other things that should be dis
cussed at just as great length as the foregoing.
One is the reprehensible attitude taken by most
civilians toward the men in the ranks. Another
is the cursed blight on defense industries of

strikes and similar labor agitation. But that's for
someone else to beef about, someone more qual
ified to speak on the subject.
So there you have the word from the guy in
the sandwich. That's it, and that's all of it, for
Bull for the chance to say it. Perhaps few will
Bull for the cliance to say it. Perhaps few will
read it, and even fewer will pay any heed. But
there should be some frosh who haven't ac
quired the habit of skipping the edits, and
they're the ones who really count now.
In parting, if there be any among you who
intend to do some booming between now and
October 7, give me a buzz. 'Cause I've got just
two weeks to live, and brother, I mean live.—

THIS guy Brucker always was a great one for
setting records. Even in the third grade he
set an all-time mark for manufacturing spitballs
while the teacher was out of the room.
And now, as a fitting climax, he sets a mark

in days to come. Just try and beat a one-day
tenure in the job, fellas; just try that for brevity.
