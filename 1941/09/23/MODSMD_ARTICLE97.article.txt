# At Stanford It's Different
## 
### 
GREEN as the new grass in front of the Hoo
ver Libe, 750 frosh arrived on the Farm
last Friday. Today they are settled in their new
homes, registered in the University, and enjoy
ing a day of respite before classes get under
way while returning students cram the Ad Build
ing for a general student body reunion—and
registration.
Today these members of the Class qi '45 feel
they are a part of Stanford. Though many of
the rough edges are yet to be smoothed up, the
A.S.S.U.-sponsored Pre-Registration program de
serves a heaping measure of praise for making
the new freshman feel at home around the Farm
before he digs into a year of good solid Western
Civ., etc.
Nor are the transfers coming to Stanford from
other, different academic surroundings neg
lected by the student orientation experts. Their
program started last night with a banquet, will
include a dance Friday night and other activities
throughout the quarter.
The two feature stories on today's front page
written by members of the frosh class provide
an interesting contrast to the first few days at
many other universities where the newcomers
are hazed and harried by the sophomores and
rushed off their feet by the fraternities and so
rorities.
At Stanford it's different.
To Norm Ross and his forty hard-working
committee members, to the forty Roble and
Encina sponsors, and to the A.S.S.U. for the
financial backing which makes the program
possible:
Congratulations on the sixth and most suc
cessful Pre-Reg program to date.
