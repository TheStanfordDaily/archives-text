### CHESLLE SAROYAN 
RUMMER is over and everyone is coming back to
school. No matter what is happening in the out
side world, it is September and Stanford is ready for
another year. No matter if the razor-edged Nazi
forces have almost succeeded in interrupting the
schedule of Russia's third Five Year Plan, no matter
what German subs do to United States ships, no mat
ter what President Roosevelt says about national de
fense, no matter if Brooklyn or St. Louis leads the
National League pennant race or for that matter if
Miss Rosemary LaPlanche of Los Angeles did win the
Miss America crown for 1941, or even if the once
important national budget remains, after a long, warm
summer, unbalanced and unmentioned. No matter what
has happened and is now happening, Stanford is
ready for another year and everyone is coming back.

/ 'OMING back once more to wear jeans and sweat-
A ers and skirts and to walk over this dusty, grassy,
wild farm; to carry binders loaded v/ith papers, books
and pencils into classes to listen to professors, to
gather at the Union for coffee and cigarettes at ten
in the morning, to sit and holler at the football games
on Saturday, to dress in smart clothes and spend the
evening in celebration at Dinah's or L'Omelette or even
at the fashionable San Francisco hotels and night
spots. Stanford is ready for another and everyone
is coming back to study, to worry, to work, to laugh
and have fun.

To everyone coming back, "Hello there, have a nice
summer?" Hello to the Deke who worked with rivets
in the Long Boach shipyard. Hello to the Tri-Delt
who toured the East Coast—parties, teas, luncheons
and those Princeton boys. Hello to the Toyon man
who worked for Lockheed and bought a snappy used
Buick, Hello to Miss Lagunita who swam and sunned,
smoked cigarettes and played bridge, and hello to the
three Pi Phi's who packed grapes all summer. Hello
to all.

B UT most important of all, hello to the men and
women, boys and girls who are just coming into
Stanford. This is it. Stanford. Steeeanfoordeee. But
don't look at it from there, young man. Come with
me down Palm Drive. There now, isn't Stanford
pretty. Look at that stretch of grass and the flowers
on the sides and of course the beautiful chapel with
the exquisite mosaics. Isn't this a pretty school. Of
course it is.

Well, we're glad you arc here. We hope that
you are here for at least four years and that you enjoy
yourselves. That which you like, praise in a loud,
clear voice and that which you dislike, condemn in
like manner. Welcome, good luck, God bless you, and
let me borrow your Time Schedule.

Well, we're glad you arc here. We hope that
you are here for at least four years and that you enjoy
yourselves. That which you like, praise in a loud,
clear voice and that which you dislike, condemn in
like manner. Welcome, good luck, God bless you, and
let me borrow your Time Schedule.
RUMMER is over and everyone is coming back to
school. No matter what is happening in the out
side world, it is September and Stanford is ready for
another year. No matter if the razor-edged Nazi
forces have almost succeeded in interrupting the
schedule of Russia's third Five Year Plan, no matter
what German subs do to United States ships, no mat
ter what President Roosevelt says about national de
fense, no matter if Brooklyn or St. Louis leads the
National League pennant race or for that matter if
Miss Rosemary LaPlanche of Los Angeles did win the
Miss America crown for 1941, or even if the once
important national budget remains, after a long, warm
summer, unbalanced and unmentioned. No matter what
has happened and is now happening, Stanford is
ready for another year and everyone is coming back.

/ 'OMING back once more to wear jeans and sweat-
A ers and skirts and to walk over this dusty, grassy,
wild farm; to carry binders loaded v/ith papers, books
and pencils into classes to listen to professors, to
gather at the Union for coffee and cigarettes at ten
in the morning, to sit and holler at the football games
on Saturday, to dress in smart clothes and spend the
evening in celebration at Dinah's or L'Omelette or even
at the fashionable San Francisco hotels and night
spots. Stanford is ready for another and everyone
is coming back to study, to worry, to work, to laugh
and have fun.

To everyone coming back, "Hello there, have a nice
summer?" Hello to the Deke who worked with rivets
in the Long Boach shipyard. Hello to the Tri-Delt
who toured the East Coast—parties, teas, luncheons
and those Princeton boys. Hello to the Toyon man
who worked for Lockheed and bought a snappy used
Buick, Hello to Miss Lagunita who swam and sunned,
smoked cigarettes and played bridge, and hello to the
three Pi Phi's who packed grapes all summer. Hello
to all.

B UT most important of all, hello to the men and
women, boys and girls who are just coming into
Stanford. This is it. Stanford. Steeeanfoordeee. But
don't look at it from there, young man. Come with
me down Palm Drive. There now, isn't Stanford
pretty. Look at that stretch of grass and the flowers
on the sides and of course the beautiful chapel with
the exquisite mosaics. Isn't this a pretty school. Of
course it is.
