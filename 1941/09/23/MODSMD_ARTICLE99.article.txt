# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
I should like very much to express my appreciation
to the forty committee members, and forty Cncina and
Roble sponsors who worked so hard to make this year's
pre-reg program a success. They all came back to school
a week early, and deserve a vote of thanks for every
thing they did. I can't mention them all individually,
but I'd like to give a special thank-you to Leslie Lang
necker, Barbara Sadler, Janice Bradbury, Barbara Hor
ner, Charlotte Drea, and the valiant legion of twenty
five volunteers who were waiting for the first train to
arrive at 6:52 in the morning.
I should like, too, to thank the members of the class
of 45. Without their co-operation and good spirit, we
couldn't have done anything.
Sincerely,
Norm Ross
