### AMIE REICHERT 
A DOLF HITLER, chewing the car
pet over the vicissitudes of his
Russian miscarriage, must have
often consoled himself with the
soul-soothing refrain, "If winter
comes, can spring be far behind?"
Yesterday, winter came to the
Russian-German battlefields and
much of the front was veiled with a
1 i«»ht snow that would soon mass in
drifts fearful enough to intimidate
even a German panzer division.
This winter, like all the winters
of mail, will he a long hard one.
And spring is awfully far behind,
especially for the impatient Nazis.
This fact to a great extent explains
Hitler's desperate eleventh-hour at
tempt to crash through to the Cau
casian oil fields, by land, sea, and
air.
* * ♦
several weeks now the Ger
mans have been high-pressuring
the Bulgarians and the Turks. Hit
ler has been trying to sneak the
Italian navy into the Black Sea
through the Dardanelles by "selling"
it to bankrupt Bulgaria.
lie has also been busy fortifying
the Bulgarian Black Sea ports of
Varna and Burgas. And latest re
ports from Ankara reveal that
Bulgaria's northbound roads are
already choked with troops moving
to join the Nazis. Moscow charged
that 400,000 Bulgars were mobil
ized against the Soviet and Tur
key.
Italy was reported massing troops
in Greece and the Aegean Islands.
Bulgaria, like Roumania and Hun
gary, is nothing but another Nazi
stooge. And it looks as though Tur
key, who has been trying frantically
to sit on both sides of the fence at
once, will be rudely knocked over
by Hitler's "supermen."
* * *
r pHE Germans need desperately
the oil of the Caucasus, and
should they secure that region as
well as strategic Turkey they would
be right on the highway that leads
to the riches of the East and the
Near East.
A Nazified Turkey would coun
teract all the good of the British
invasion of Iran and cut oft' Brit
ish aid to the Red armies in the
South.
United Press dispatches report
that Britain is prepared to fight
alongside the Russians in defense of
the Caucasus. It was also rumored
last night that General Archibald
Wavell had been transferred from
India to the Caucasus to organize
the forces there.

IVBC's Ankara correspondent,
speaking last Sunday, declared
his belief that the Turks will resist
to the last ditch any attempt by the
Nazis to invade their territory.
This would seem to indicate that
Turkey will fall off her fence right
into the arms of the Rritish and al
low troops from Iran to pass through
and fight along with her.
According to Pierre van Paas
scn's theory (which maintains
that this war is a struggle for con
trol of bodies of water) the im
pending blow-up is a Battle for
the Black Sea.
If the Axis can succeed in encir
cling this by Bulgaria on the East,
the Ukraine on the North, Turkey
on the South, and the Caucasus on
the West, it can then send deadly
spearheads in four directions which
will menace the whole continent of
Asia.
