# Over 1000 Pack Fall Reg Dance
## 
### 
Marked by the biggest turnout in
years, last night's Reg Dance in the
Women's Gym was attended by well
over 500 couples. Under soft red
lights Farm couples renewed old
acquaintances, reminisced on sum
mer vacation, and discussed the
coming football season to the music
of Ernie Heckscher and his orches
tra.
"It was colossal," stated Carl Liv
ingston, chairman of the dance. "De
spite the drop in University registra
tion, the attendance at the dance this
year was much larger than last."
The money from the dance will
be turned over to a fund created to
pay off the principal on Stanford's
boathouse investment. Heckscher and
his orchestra recently closed an en
gagement at the Mark Hopkins in
San Francisco.
Dress for the affair, which lasted
from !) to 12 o'clock, was informal.
Farm women received automatic
12:30 late leaves to attend the dance.
