# Gaieties Song, Skit Deadline Set
## 
### 
Continuing his search for songs
and script for the 1041 Big Game
Gaieties, Director Ash Wilson said,
"We need 'em bad, and we want 'em
quick."
Setting October 15 as the final
deadline for both ideas and finished
products, Wilson added that the
sooner songs and scripts are sub
mitted, the greater the chance of
their being worked into shape for the
show.
Ideas will also be accepted. "If
anyone has an idea for a skit, but
can't write dialogue, or has a song
he can't write down, all he has to do
is contact me through the dramatic
manager's office and we'll whip it
into shape," Wilson said.
"Some pretty good stuff has al
ready been turned in, but there is
plenty of room for more," Wilson
added.
All material will be accepted at
the dramatic manager's office and
can be turned in any time in the
afternoon.
The Big Game Gaieties, to be given
November 28, is an all-student show,
written, directed, and acted by stu
dents.
