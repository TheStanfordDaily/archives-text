Returning students yesterday completed registration for Stanford's 51st
|year, leaving not only an Administration Building floor littered with
empty rcg books, hut a faculty pondering the loss of 1104 students, of whom
all but one are men.
Registrants for this year total :{,876, a 7 per cent decline from last year's

~4,180. University of California this
year suffered a 10 per cent decrease.
Army draft, national defense in
dustries and other demands gnawed
their way into male ranks to digest
303 men. There is a decrease of one
woman student.
RATIO DROPS
Remember the days of the old
three men to one woman ratio? It's
below 2-to-l now. Last year's ratio

and 1,306 women. Last year there
were 2,873 men and 1,307 women.
Of the 303 men lost to the Farm,
there are 09 fewer new men this
year than last, and 234 fewer re
turning males.
WOMEN GAIN

approximately 2,617 are returning
Stanfordites and 1,259 are newcom
ers. There are 2,617 returning
"roughs" and 757 new men, with
804 returning women and 502 new
