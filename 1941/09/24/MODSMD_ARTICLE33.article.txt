## 
### 
Surrounded three-deep with students anxious to sign up for the
R.O.T.C. course, the officers handling the registration said that the quota
allowed Stanford had already exceeded the limit and a large number have
been placed on a waiting list.
The War Department has increased the number of men that can be

handled at Stanford to 300 in the,
basic and 125 in the advanced group.
Almost 300 new men signed up on
the first day of registration and ap
proximately 130 basic men are re
turning for their second year of basic
training. These increases are in the
field artillery.
A proportionate increase has been
made by the War Office in the Ord
nance Department. Instruction will
be given on Friday afternoon this
year in addition to the other after
noons. There has been no increase
in the staff.
In the Stanford medical school 61
doctors hold reserve commissions
and are organized to staff a navy
base hospital and an army surgical
hosiptal. Leaves of absence have
been granted to 24 men from various
departments for full time duty in
the army, navy and defense branches
of government and industry.
Research, under the control of the
army and the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics, is being
carried out in the Guggenheim
Aeronautics Laboratory at Stanford.
Encina Hall housed the entire
Original class at the opening of
Stanford.
