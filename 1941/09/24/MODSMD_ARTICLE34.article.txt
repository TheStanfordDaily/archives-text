WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 (UP).—
Great Britain will lose the war un
less it receives 5i.000,000,000 worth
of American food within the next
five months, Secretary of Agricul
ture Claude R. Wickard said today
as the new $5,985,000,000 lend-lease
bill started through Congress.
His startling report was made be
fore the House deficiency appropria
tions subcommittee after Edward R.
Stettinius Jr., lend-lease administra
tor, had testified that the adminis
tration insisted on a free hand to
supply material aid under the meas
ure to Russia, if necessary. He was
referring to plans of non-interven
tionists to propose an amendment
barring help to the Soviets.
The number of California wage
earners, during July, was 56 per cent
greater than for the same month of
1940. The weekly payroll figure was
90 per cent higher.
