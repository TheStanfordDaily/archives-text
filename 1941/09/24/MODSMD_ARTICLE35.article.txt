# Nazi War Toll Over 2 Million, Claim Russians
## German Navy Loses 156 War, Troop Ships In Baltic Fighting 
### 
MOSCOW, Wed.. Sept. 24 (UP).—
I The Soviet government today esli-
I mated German losses in three
months of war with Russia at 2,300,-
000 men—killed, wounded or cap
tured—and claimed that in the same
period 74 Nazi warships and 82
transports had been sunk in the
Baltic sea alone.
Scoffing at Berlin reports of Ger
man losses, S. A. Lozovsky, foreign
vice-commissar and official spokes
man, gave the Russian figures and
commented that if the Nazi data
were to be accepted and compared
with the normal mortality rate, "it.
must be concluded that the eastern
front is no front but; a health re-
I sort."
The Red army maintained its reti
cence with regard to hostilities, re
iterating its now stereotyped obser
vation that "our troops fought the
' enemy along the entire front."
Officials said earlier that three
1 so-called Soviet "lost" divisions had
j inflicted 50,000 casualties on the Ger
; mans in the Lake Ilmen sector, that
four battalions of Finns had been
annihilated in the Lake Sjaich area,
and that the approaches to Odessa
I were cluttered with bodies.
Lozovsky, deriding official Nazi
| reports on German casualties —
: 395,000 —said they were "not science
I but art, and in this art they surpass
all records."
He cited as the basis for the Rus
sian estimate of 2,300,000 as a mini
mum the various reports and orders
! of the German high command and
| testimony of Nazi prisoners.
