# New Roads Make Farm Rides Easier
## 
### CHARLIE MULL 
Since the completion of the new
campus highways, Farm traffic has
been largely centralized to flow into
Palm Drive. This makes good news
to thumbing Stanfordites who have
attempted to furrow out rides from
a dozen different directions.
Once again the popular spot for
procuring a lift will be the corner
of University Avenue and Emerson
Street, the same spot that was used
before the construction of the under
pass.
Rides to Paly will probably still be
run on the catch-as-catch-can prin
cipal; the favorite spots being the
corner diagonally across from the
History Corner, and the corner of
Encina facing on Embarcadero.
With the improvement of Lomita
Drive certain to divert more traffic
up the north side of the Quad, rides
may be secured along this thorough
fare, but this is still untried and
hence uncertain.
