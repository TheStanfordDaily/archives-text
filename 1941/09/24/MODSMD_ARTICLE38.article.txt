# Seek Tryoutees For New Choir
## 
### 
An A Capella Choir, consisting
of a picked group of singers, will be
an innovation in the Division of
Music this quarter. For the first
time, the Division will present a
mixed A Capella Choir in addition
to the regular University Choir.
This choir will be under the di
rection of Charles Running, assistant
organist, who came to Stanford this
year from San Jose State. Any stu
dent may tryout for a position if
they can meet Running's voice re
quirements. Members of the Uni
versity Choir are also eligible to
try out during the dates which will
be announced after October 5.
For the Anniversary week, Oct.
1-5, the University Choir of mixed
voices will present varied programs.
Rehearsals for these programs will
be Wednesday and Thursday at 7:15
p.m. in the choir room, behind Me
morial Chapel. All freshmen who
would like to sing in the choir and
take an active part in the cere
monies may try out at the first re
hearsal, while other undergraduates
who are not members of the choir
may try out at the Thursday night
rehearsal.
