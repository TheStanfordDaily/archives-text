# Injured Toe Slows Milt Temporarily
## 
### 
With th<> fullback running in a
sport shirt, a pair of white duck
trousers, and a slipper, the first
string varsity gridders went through
defensive practice against Oregon
signals for their game with the
Ducks, only four days distant.
Milt Vucinich, the fullback, has
an infected toe which kept him out
of a .suit, but which is expected to
be okay in a day or so. Bob Crane
alternated with "Vooch" as the
"blacks" ran through the Oregon
plays which are run from box and
wing formations after shifting from
a "T." The "reds," second string
outfit, were given the same plays
by the "greens."
As the line stands according to
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's latest
manipulations, from left to right
ends, Hank Norberg, Ed Stamm,
Chuck Taylor, Vic Lindskog, Loren
LaPrade, Bruno Banducci, Fred
Meyer, and Arnold Meiners.
Last year's frosh mainstay, La-
Prade, who has recently been moved
up to first string right guard from
third string center, was calling the
defensive signals for the Indian reg
ulars and has been named to start
Saturday's game.
Frankie Albert at quarter, Pete
Kmetovic at left half, Eric Arm
strong at right half, and Vucinich at
full made up the back field. Ray
Hammett and Bub ■ Ditlev.sen alter
nated with Albert and Armstrong.
The "red" line had Bob Mastin
and Bill Brubaker at the ends, Ed
McCain and Ed Johannessen at
tackles, Jack Francis and Ken Ro
besky at guards, and Doug Stahle at
center.
A1 Cole and Bob Mitchell were at
left half of the second string with
Ray Durham playing quarter, Wil
lard Sheller fullback, and Buck Faw
cett right halfback. Mitchell, who
underwent observation for appendi
citis over the week-end, was pro
nounced a well man by Dr. Fritz
Roth.
End Coach Jim Lawson was han
dling the the first string, Line Coach
Phil Bengtson the second string, and
Backfield Coach Marehie Schwartz
the "blues," or third string, who
joined the regulars later in the af
ternoon. Coach Clark toured from
one squad to another polishing up
the defensive maneuvers.
Early in the afternoon while the
squad's brains were being exercised
in a chalk talk, photographers took
a series of pictures of the foremost
members of the team for later re
lease in a football pictorial section.
Vucinich, Kmetovic, and Taylor
spent the night in the rest home.
"Vooch" was there to take it easy
on his sore toe, while Kmetovic and
Taylor were there to tend to slight
colds.
