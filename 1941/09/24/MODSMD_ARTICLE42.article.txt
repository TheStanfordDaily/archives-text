## 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 23 (UP).—
The St. Louis Cardinals slumbled
today in their wild dash for the Na
tional League pennant, split a
double-header with the Pittsburgh
Pirates and failed to gain on the
idle Brooklyn Dodgers.
Ken Heintzelman, a southpaw,
pounded a nail into the coffin of the
Cardinals' hopes by pitching the
Pirates to a 4 to 0 victory in the
first game. In the second game the
Cardinals teed off with three big
bats and earned an easy triumph,
9 to 0.
By splitting today's double-header,
the Cardinals left the pennant race
in this shape:
St. Louis and Brooklyn each have
four games remaining. The Cardi
nals play in Pittsburgh tomorrow
and Thursday, have an open date
on Friday and move to Chicago for
games Saturday and Sunday to wind
up their season. The Dodgers play
in Boston tomorrow and Thursday,
are idle on Friday and go to Ebbets
Field for games with Philadelphia
on Saturday and Sunday.
The Cardinals are a game and a
half behind the Dodgers.
If the Dodgers win tomorrow and
the Cardinals lose, it will be mathe
matically possible for Brooklyn to
win the pennant in Boston on Thurs
day.
