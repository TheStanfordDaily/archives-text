# Frosk Aerial Attack Looks Good in Drill
## 
### 
Aerial offensive sizzled for the
house of David yesterday afternoon
â€”as the passing duo of Dave Pate
and Dave Brown clieked off long
gains during frosh grid practice.
Pate, all - city man hailing from
East High, Denver, was at home
with long, looping heaves, which
Brown cleverly gathered in down
field.
Cannon Parkinson, vieing for a
starting berth at quarter, completed
plenty of bullet spot passes to
Brown, and seems destined to do
things before the season is over.
Sporting red jersey 29, worn by
Hugh Gallarneau last season, was
Jim Kresl. And Mr. Kresl did 0.k.,
ripping off one nice gain of 15 yards
off tackle with good blocking ahead
of him.
Still a bit. green on fundamentals,
the Papooses seem to be a fighting
bunch, all battling for first-string
positions for the opener Saturday
against Bakersfield J. C.
Looking especially good in the line
during the scrimmage was hefty
Jack Sogorka, while Jim McCurdy,
who is injured but will probably gain
the starting call at center, watched
practice from the sidelines.
