# Soccer Scheduled With British Team
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney has sched
uled his first varsity soccer practice
for this afternoon at 4 o'clock after
the physical examination.
The game with the British team
from the warships H.M.S. Orion and
H.M.S. Liverpool, which are at Mare
Island for repairs, has been changed
to the morning of October 4 so the
British team can see the U.C.L.A.
football game.
Although 18 members of last year's
varsity are missing, already 56 stu
dents have enrolled for the soccer
squad. The frosh team also promises
to have two teams. There are posi
tions open for both sophomore and
junior managers.
