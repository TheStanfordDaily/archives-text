### DON SELBY 
MILTON C. VUCINICH, the hard
working fullback, has a sore
toe. In fact, the darn thing is so
sore (hat Voos is treking around the
campus wearing a slipper with the
bow cut out. And here it is only
four days before the season opener
with the old U. of O.
But Voos reports that Doc Dav
ies said the injury isn't serious
enough to keep him (Voos or Doc)
out of the fracas. So it looks as if
we can stop worrying, although
that toe has been keeping the
Slashing Slav from taking an ac
tive part in the heavy work for the
last couple of days.
And it all started from a small,
insignificant, blister.
From the looks of yesterday's
scrum session, though, it appears
that this boy Willard Sheller, who
took his first whack at the T last
spring, can do a smart bit of full
backing himself. Sheller turned in
some running that brought com
ments from the few observers that
were allowed inside the practice
field walls. And Coach Clark
Shaughnessy barked out:
"Nice going, Sheller."
Then, too, there's Bob "Cruncher"
Crane, the fella who's been playing
all the backfield spots, except right
half, at one time or another this
fall. He's mostly likely to see action
at the fullback position, however,
and he has a lot on the ball. He'll
be especially valuable when and if
Frank Albert leaves the game, for
"Crunch" is the second best booter
among the backs, Albert being the
best, of course.
* * *
JT'LL certainly be great when our
Indians have played a game. No
longer will we all have to conjec
ture about what they may do when
the season starts.
Of course, we can see practice
now, hut that doesn't give much of
an idea about how the Stanfords
will do in competition. Every
thing is so uncertain. If the In
dians dispense with the Duck
threat everyone will have a bet
ter idea on their chances of mov
ing through the rest of the con
ference plus U.S.F. and Santa
Clara. Even if Oregon does win

(ugh, what a thought), (he man
ner in which Albert, Taylor et al.
play the game will he some tip -
oIT as to what can he expected of
them for the rest of the season.

how potent Stanford's
defense will be Saturday? In
only two games last year, against
U.S.F. and Oregon, did the Cards
shut out their opponents. The re
mainder of the season, they just out
scored them. And so far this sea
son Shaughnessy has sent his first
team on defense only once, that be
ing last Saturday, when the fourths
ran Oregon plays against them.
Of course, the defensive phase of
the game ordinarily doesn't require
as much practice as does the attack,
for the simple reason that defensive
play is more instinctive. But it is
getting more and more complicated
all the time.
There are 8,800 acres on the Stan
ford campus.

campus wearing a slipper with the
bow cut out. And here it is only
four days before the season opener
with the old U. of O.
But Voos reports that Doc Dav
ies said the injury isn't serious
enough to keep him (Voos or Doc)
out of the fracas. So it looks as if
we can stop worrying, although
that toe has been keeping the
Slashing Slav from taking an ac
tive part in the heavy work for the
last couple of days.
And it all started from a small,
insignificant, blister.
From the looks of yesterday's
scrum session, though, it appears
that this boy Willard Sheller, who
took his first whack at the T last
spring, can do a smart bit of full
backing himself. Sheller turned in
some running that brought com
ments from the few observers that
were allowed inside the practice
field walls. And Coach Clark
Shaughnessy barked out:
"Nice going, Sheller."
Then, too, there's Bob "Cruncher"
Crane, the fella who's been playing
all the backfield spots, except right
half, at one time or another this
fall. He's mostly likely to see action
at the fullback position, however,
and he has a lot on the ball. He'll
be especially valuable when and if
Frank Albert leaves the game, for
"Crunch" is the second best booter
among the backs, Albert being the
best, of course.

JT'LL certainly be great when our
Indians have played a game. No
longer will we all have to conjec
ture about what they may do when
the season starts.
Of course, we can see practice
now, hut that doesn't give much of
an idea about how the Stanfords
will do in competition. Every
thing is so uncertain. If the In
dians dispense with the Duck
threat everyone will have a bet

ing through the rest of the con
ference plus U.S.F. and Santa

how potent Stanford's
defense will be Saturday? In
only two games last year, against
U.S.F. and Oregon, did the Cards
shut out their opponents. The re
mainder of the season, they just out
scored them. And so far this sea
son Shaughnessy has sent his first
team on defense only once, that be
ing last Saturday, when the fourths
ran Oregon plays against them.
Of course, the defensive phase of
the game ordinarily doesn't require
as much practice as does the attack,
for the simple reason that defensive
play is more instinctive. But it is
getting more and more complicated
all the time.
