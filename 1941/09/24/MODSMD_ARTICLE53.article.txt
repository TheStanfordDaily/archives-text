# The 						Sandwichman
## 
### 
YESTERDAY you read a few words from "the
guy in the sandwich," a man who is being
drafted at the start of his senior year in college.
This year was to be the climax of 16 years of
schooling. It was to top off three years' work
in his chosen university activity, which had
placed him in a position responsible to the cam
pus and to himself, held promise of even greater
service before graduation. This year was to
have been his last at Stanford ... on the Quad
. . . with his many friends and co-workers . . .
with his fraternity brothers.
Last year was his final year at Stanford. Sure,
he might return some day; so might all the other
college draftees. But, will they?
This man asks no quarter other than two
weeks in which to fortify himself before induc
tion. He writes, . . I've got just two weeks
to live." What comes after those two weeks?
Real freedom to come and go and order his life
as he pleases, opportunity to advance in his pro
fession?
Nevertheless, he will shoulder his new re
sponsibility to America and to freedom as he
trains to defend them. While this man puts
aside thoughts of his last year in college and
goes forth to help preserve the rights of one
hundred and thirty million Americans, you and
I remain in college for one of these reasons:
1. Age
2. Sex
3. Deferment
4. Luck
No male is kidding himself that he's a privi
leged character and doesn't have to consider
the long arm of a draft board in laying plans for
the future. Uncle Sam doesn't know any privi
leged characters. Rich man, poor man, beggar
man, thief: Uncle Sam needs you.
There are three hundred and three fewer men
in Stanford this year. By contrast, there is one
less woman. And there are those of us who
remain behind to start, continue or wind up our
careers at Stanford. Meanwhile, the draft board
breathes its hot breath down the backs of our
necks.
We will work harder and maybe we will play
harder this year.
We remember the guy in the sandwich.—

harder this year.
We remember the guy in the sandwich.—
H. S.
YESTERDAY you read a few words from "the
guy in the sandwich," a man who is being
drafted at the start of his senior year in college.
This year was to be the climax of 16 years of
schooling. It was to top off three years' work
in his chosen university activity, which had
placed him in a position responsible to the cam
pus and to himself, held promise of even greater
service before graduation. This year was to
have been his last at Stanford ... on the Quad
. . . with his many friends and co-workers . . .
with his fraternity brothers.
Last year was his final year at Stanford. Sure,
he might return some day; so might all the other
college draftees. But, will they?
This man asks no quarter other than two
weeks in which to fortify himself before induc
tion. He writes, . . I've got just two weeks
to live." What comes after those two weeks?
Real freedom to come and go and order his life
as he pleases, opportunity to advance in his pro
fession?
Nevertheless, he will shoulder his new re
sponsibility to America and to freedom as he
trains to defend them. While this man puts
aside thoughts of his last year in college and
goes forth to help preserve the rights of one
hundred and thirty million Americans, you and
I remain in college for one of these reasons:
1. Age
2. Sex
3. Deferment
4. Luck
No male is kidding himself that he's a privi
leged character and doesn't have to consider
the long arm of a draft board in laying plans for
the future. Uncle Sam doesn't know any privi
leged characters. Rich man, poor man, beggar
man, thief: Uncle Sam needs you.
There are three hundred and three fewer men
in Stanford this year. By contrast, there is one
less woman. And there are those of us who
remain behind to start, continue or wind up our
careers at Stanford. Meanwhile, the draft board
breathes its hot breath down the backs of our
necks.
We will work harder and maybe we will play
harder this year.
