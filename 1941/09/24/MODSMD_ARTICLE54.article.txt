# Firetrap
## 
### 
WITH every year and every different class
of Encina residents there always arises the
burning question of fire prevention and protec
tion in the huge old dormitory.
Daily editors have ranted, the Firehouse
squad has cussed, and the Administration has
cracked down.
Every year as a result of this some slight ad
vance is made in making Encina a safe place
for 450 men to live. First it was the new fire
escapes, then the direct connection of fire alarm
signals to the Firehouse.
But no matter how much is done along this
line, Encina will always be a hazardous firetrap
unless the threat of false alarms is removed.
Encina had its first false alarm Monday night.
Whether the person responsible for the alarm
will comply with Dean Bunn's request for a
personal apology waits to be seen. Whether he
does or not, the residents of Encina will be as
sessed SlOO. Though this may seem unfair, it is
the only way this dangerous menace may be
curbed. Everyone else always has to pay for
the misdeeds of the "stinking one per cent."
And for every false alarm turned in, there will
be another $100 assessment.

Before the alarm system was connected to the
Firehouse a short time ago, angered frosh,
asleep or studying (the satanic alarm-setters al
ways worked at night), just pulled their pillows
over their heads or dropped an oath or two as
soon as the bells started clanging. This used to
happen more than just a few times during the
year.
A fire of any size at all could have taken a
terrific toll of lives or injuries. All for the thrill
of one mentally unbalanced Stanford student
who would smirk in private over the disturb
ance he had created.
But now this has changed.
Because in recent years there has not been a
fire of major proportions in Encina Hall is no
reason why such a conflagration might not start
at any time—tonight or tomorrow night.
And when that fire bell rings, it should mean
only one thing to anyone who hears its warn
ing—get out of the Hall as quickly and as
quietly as possible.
It should be absolutely mandatory that Encina
Hall have regular fire drills, at least until a set
time limit for evacuation of the Hall has been
fulfilled to the satisfaction of Eire Chief Dugan.
This is the procedure followed in Roble which
has only 255 residents. Why not in Encina with
over 450?
