# Come and Get It

### 
AS the mad scramble, always a part of the
opening of fall quarter, tapers off today
with the starting of classes and the issuance of
four- instead of fourteen-page Dailies, we have
time to catch our breath and do a little moraliz
ing aimed particularly at the more than 1,250
new students on the Farm.
It has always been held that the greatest bene
fit can be gotten from a university education
by making a suitable division of time between
academic learning—from lectures and books—
and the other, more intangible type of learning
—that of learning how to live and to deal with
other people.
Stanford offers more than ample opportuni
ties to partake of both types of learning.
More than half of Stanford students engage
in some form of extra-curricular activity. New
students, whether frosh or transfer, are more
than welcome in these activities.
There are clubs and committees, managerial
posts, and work on campus publications and
dramatic productions. The calls for members
and tryoutees will continue through fall quarter.
Pick out something and try it. You'll find it's
fun; and you might not realize it, but you'll be
adding to your academics that very valuable
and often neglected supplement which makes
life after graduation so much easier.
