f IKE everyone else I had to pay this morning, pay
for my education for the next quarter. It surprised
me to see that I was writing $143 in the right hand
corner instead of $130. That seemed like a lot of
money. So I carried on a little private investigation
to see what was responsible for the increase. In my
book I saw that tuition was $115, and that another
item called Other Fees cost $28. That added to $143 all
right, but what is this Other Fee Business, I asked my
self.
Upon referring to the asterisk at the bottom of the
page, I found that $15 was for Community Fee, $10 for
Inicdentals and $3 for Library Fee. All of these
sounded all right except the one labeled Incidentals.
On further investigation and inquiry, I found that this
Incidentals and $3 for Library Fee. All of these
fees.
Of course there is an obviousQriticism to this sys
tem. But despite it's being obvious, the criticism is
highly unjust and besides I don't like it. I don't like
the idea of donating about $20 a year to the purchas
ing of test tubes for our chemists, goggles for our air
men, rats for our psychologists. 1 think the best and
fairest way would be for everyone to pay for that
which he gets. Maybe I'm wrong.

J WALKED over to Encina the other day, sat in the
lobby and watched the freshmen. They were lined
up in front of the office to pay their room and board
bills. It amazed me to see how much they resemble
my class and last year's class in Encina. I guess that
all freshmen have always looked alike, and for that
matter, I suppose that all people look alike and do
about the same things.
Most of the boys were already wearing jeans and
T shirts, and Stanford buckles on their pants. Al
ready they had discovered the incomparable joy of
throwing water bags, and five of the boys were on the
fourth floor, happily filling and throwing and laugh
ing. I noticed that one young man had already dis
covered the advantages of balloons. I think that it
was late in the spring quarter of my freshman year
before I realized what greater speed, distance and ac
curacy was possible with balloons filled with water.

Tom Fuller, tall, handsome basketball prospect from
Los Angeles, has asked me to have something about
him in the column every Wednesday morning. I
couldn't think of anything this time, but we'll do it
starting next Wednesday.

my class and last year's class in Encina. I guess that
all freshmen have always looked alike, and for that
matter, I suppose that all people look alike and do
about the same things.
Most of the boys were already wearing jeans and
T shirts, and Stanford buckles on their pants. Al
ready they had discovered the incomparable joy of
throwing water bags, and five of the boys were on the
fourth floor, happily filling and throwing and laugh
ing. I noticed that one young man had already dis
covered the advantages of balloons. I think that it
was late in the spring quarter of my freshman year
before I realized what greater speed, distance and ac
curacy was possible with balloons filled with water.

Tom Fuller, tall, handsome basketball prospect from
Los Angeles, has asked me to have something about
him in the column every Wednesday morning. I
couldn't think of anything this time, but we'll do it
starting next Wednesday.
ECONOMICS, ENCINA, TOM
f IKE everyone else I had to pay this morning, pay
for my education for the next quarter. It surprised
me to see that I was writing $143 in the right hand
corner instead of $130. That seemed like a lot of
money. So I carried on a little private investigation
to see what was responsible for the increase. In my
book I saw that tuition was $115, and that another
item called Other Fees cost $28. That added to $143 all
right, but what is this Other Fee Business, I asked my
self.
Upon referring to the asterisk at the bottom of the
page, I found that $15 was for Community Fee, $10 for
Inicdentals and $3 for Library Fee. All of these
sounded all right except the one labeled Incidentals.
On further investigation and inquiry, I found that this
Incidentals and $3 for Library Fee. All of these
fees.
Of course there is an obviousQriticism to this sys
tem. But despite it's being obvious, the criticism is
highly unjust and besides I don't like it. I don't like
the idea of donating about $20 a year to the purchas
ing of test tubes for our chemists, goggles for our air
men, rats for our psychologists. 1 think the best and
fairest way would be for everyone to pay for that
which he gets. Maybe I'm wrong.

J WALKED over to Encina the other day, sat in the
lobby and watched the freshmen. They were lined
up in front of the office to pay their room and board
bills. It amazed me to see how much they resemble
my class and last year's class in Encina. I guess that
all freshmen have always looked alike, and for that
matter, I suppose that all people look alike and do
about the same things.
