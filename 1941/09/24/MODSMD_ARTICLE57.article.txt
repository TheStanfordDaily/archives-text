THE EDITOR, SIR:
Where are the rattles, bumps, and shell holes of
other years? What has happened to the rutty roads
of all past eras? Can it be—it is, that the highways
on our beloved campus have been made passable, not
to mention rideable.
It is. The impossible has happened. The pristine
and rocky glory of our Stanford arteries have been
smoothed and resurfaced to form something equiv
alent to modern highways and personally, as the proud
owner of a 192(5 Oldsmobile I want to raise my feeble
voice in praise of the administration's great feat.
Congratulations to all from President Wilbur down
to the guys who laid the asphalt. "In My Merry Olds
