"TIIE MALE ANIMAL," now at the Alcazar in San Francisco.
Henry DulTy has revived the old San Francisco Alcazar Theater in a
manner that will warm the hearts of Stanfordites. The past three produc
tions that have been offered seem to this reviewer to be tops in enter
tainment value.

Third and current Duffy produc
tion is the "Male Animal," starring
the able actor Otto Kruger.
CONCERNS PROFESSOR
The story, a brainchild of Cartoon
ist James Thurber, relates the history
of a college professor confronted
with stadium-building trustees.
The pressure of the larger and
more powerful trustees becomes
acute when a young editor writes a
pink editorial and an ex-All-Amer
ican comes back to lure the profes
sor's wife away.
KRUGER GETS DRUNK
These events cause a complete
change in the professor's approach
to the problem. In a wonderful
scene the professor, played by Otto
Kruger, gets drunk and explains to
the young writer that a man must
revert back to the primitive to pro
tect his home. The ex-footballer
arrives and the professor tries to
carry out his theories.
Kruger, of course, is wonderful,
and he is ably supported by a large
cast, including many local players.
Best news of all is the reasonable
price at which this entertainment is
offered. About half of that usually
asked, it is just right for the college
student, and entertainment-hungry
Stanfordites will be quick to recip
rocate if they take time out to see
"The Male Animal."—Mull
