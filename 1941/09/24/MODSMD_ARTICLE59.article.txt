# Russia Claims Attrition War
## 
### 
WITH THE RED ARMY ON THE
CENTRAL FRONT (UP)—The Red
Army believes it has throttled the
German blitzkrieg and turned it into
a war of attrition, a grinding away
of Nazi men and materials like Ver
dun in the World War, but 10 or 100
times more intensive.
Lieut. Gen. Vassily Sokolovsky
voiced for the Soviet command on
the western front that opinion dur
ing a long conference with American
and British correspondents touring
the Yelnya and Yartsevo battle
fields.
Already the Germans are digging
in on a large part of the central
front, apparently in preparation for
a winter of such rigors as those
which reduced Napoleon's grand
army of 600,000 to a straggling band
of 20.000 lifeless scarecrows, Sokol
ovsky said.
"On a front of hundreds, almost
thousands, of kilometers they now
are on the defensive," he said.
"Trench warfare, mud, Russian
roads and winter lie ahead of them."
It is like Verdun, but 10 or 100
times worse for the Germans be
cause the weapons of destruction on
the Soviet side—tanks, planes, guns
—are so much more powerful than
the weapons used then."
