BERLIN, Sept. 23 (UP).—Ger

eastern front, amid increasing indi

the Black sea which is almost cer
tain to drag Bulgaria and Turkey
into the war.
Such slaughter as the world had
never seen was reported from the
blood bath, drenching Russia from
the Arctic through the Leningrad

southern Ukraine. Both belligerents
claimed enemy casualties in figures
which are almost unbelievable —but
which if halved still would surpass
anything in history.
Dr. John P. Leonard, associate
professor of education, who takes a
leave of absence Fall Quarter, an
nounced that he will work on his
book on secondary school curriculum,
approximately one-third of which
he has already completed.
