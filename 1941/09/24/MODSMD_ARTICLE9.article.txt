# Book Co-op Gives Farms Best Values
## 
### 
Take your used texts to the Co
op Non-Profit Book Exchange
(where old texts are brought in and
sold on a consignment basis) imme
diately so that you can take advan
tage of the quick turnover at the
beginning of the quarter. Remem
ber: "The sooner your books are
brought in the quicker they may
be sold."
Starting Tuesday and continuing
for the rest of the week, the Ex
change is open from 9 to 11:30 a.m.
and from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. After this
week doors are open only in the
afternoon. Fifty dollars of business
went across the tabic in Room 15 of
the Old Union Tuesday morning—
encouraging news to students who
are running low on funds and could
use a little more ready cash from
last year's textbooks.
According to Don Spickard, man
ager of the Exchange, the following
list of books is most in demand
right now: Fenwick, International
Law; Steiner, International Rela
tions; Anderson, American Govern
ment; Modlin and Mclsaac; Maxey,
Political Philosophies; Wells, Sci
ence of Life; Animals Without Back
bones; Baitsell, Human Biology; Mc-
Cutcheon, Seltz, Warner, General
Chemistry; Cushman 7th edition;
Buell, Two in One edition.
The student organization, designed
to aid the students in every way
possible, gives 65 per cent to the
owner while their nearest competi
tor gives only 50 per cent of the
original cost. The books are sold for
the owner at an added 10 per cent—
the profit margin going to the Ex
change for expenses.
