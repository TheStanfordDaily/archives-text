64VOWHERE in the land did a
single eminent or respected
citizen arise to defend the ex-hero's
appeal to prejudice and bigotry."
Thus "Time" commented last week
on Charles A. Lindbergh's recent
Des Moines speech, "Who Are the
War Agitators?"
Last night a whole committee of
citizens arose to defend Colonel
Lindbergh's appeal to prejudice
and bigotry. The America First
Committee piously wrung its hands
in anguish over the injection of a
religious issue into the national
controversy and declared, "It is
the interventionists who have done
this."
Men of all faiths had arisen last
week to rebuke the isolationist lead
er when he charged that the Brit
ish, the Jews and the Administra
tion were the nation's leading war
agitators.

STEPHEN T. EARLY, Wendell
k Willkie, Dorothy Thompson,
Chester Rowell, Alfred E. Smith, and
Thomas E. Dewey were only a few
of the defenders of religious free
dom in America who urged the
America First Committee to repu
diate its "un-American" spokesman.
Last night the America First
Committee came forth as the sole
defender of Anti-Semitism in
America. It not only refused to
repudiate Lindbergh, but avowed
complete innocence in the whole
matter and placed the blame
squarely on the shoulders of the
"interventionists."
"The interventionists have sought
to hide the real issue by flinging
false charges at the America First
Committee and at every leader who
has spoken out against our entry
into the European war," said the
committee.
"There is but one real issue—the
issue of war. From this issue we
will not be diverted; we will carry
the fight until it has been won," it
continued.
* t *
hphe Committee has suddenly de
veloped an incredibly bad mem
ory; until Colonel Lindbergh's
speech, there was only one issue.
But if the storm of radio, press, and
individual condemnation that swept
the country and broke over Colonel
Lindbergh's head last week had any
effect at all, he must now know that
the American people intend to keep
things just that way.
They will not be sundered by
hatreds. And there will be only one
real issue.
From the moral point of view,
Lindbergh exposed himself almost
naively to nationwide condemna
tion. He attacked one of the fun
damental freedoms guaranteed by
the Bill of Rights.
But just for the record, Columnist
Dorothy Thompson went gunning for
the ex-flier on the count of inaccu
racy as well. Lindbergh had said
that "the greatest danger to this
country lies in the large Jewish own
ership and influence in our motion
pictures, our press, our i-adio, ind
our government."

MISS THOMPSON proceeded to
knock the pins from under the
Colonel with a parcel of authorita
tive statistics which proved the un
mitigated fallacy of this statement.
"If every American Jew died to
morrow," wrote Miss Thompson, it
would not make the slightest differ
ence in the policy of the movies, the
radio, the government, or the press
—unless, of course, Mr. Lindbergh
and his followers could fill whatever
positions were vacant from the lists
of the America First Committee.
"There are precedents for that too
in Fascist countries. But first he
would have to deal with some of us
who are not Jews."
Wrote the San Francisco Chronicle
last week:
"U.S. isolationists last week
awakened to a sad realization.
Their only spokesman of national
stature had lost the respect of the
country."
The America First Committee
now approves the words of its chief
spokesman. It must follow that the
Committee, too, shall lose the respect
of the country.
