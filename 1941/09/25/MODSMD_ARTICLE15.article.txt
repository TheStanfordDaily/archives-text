# NEW U.S. 'JUMP PLANE'
## 
### 

THIS NEW AUTOGIIIO, shown during tests at Washington before
government ollicials, may prove valuable for patrol and observation
duty, because it needs no run to take off. Surrounded by automobiles,
it leaped straight into the air. It can land on a dimeâ€”straight down.
