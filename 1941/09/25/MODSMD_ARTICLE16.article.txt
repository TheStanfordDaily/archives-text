the United States, under our consti

army and navy and is responsible for
the conduct of our foreign relations,
we as Americans, regardless of

"2. Opposing aggression, we heart
ily support the Hoover-Stimson doc
trine which refuses recognition to
changes in the territorial status quo

tility of a policy of economic and po
litical isolationism.
