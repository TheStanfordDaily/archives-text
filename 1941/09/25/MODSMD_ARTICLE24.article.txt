CONTINUES AS HEAD
The President was to have con
cluded his term as head of the Uni
versity on Jan. 1 of that year, after
a quarter of a century of leadership.
However, he was asked by the Board
of Trustees to continue as President
until Jan. 1, 1942, at which time he
will become Chancellor for life, with
the understanding he will continue
as Acting President until the new
President is chosen.
The President said yesterday he
believed the board will name his suc
cessor by the end of the present
academic year.
UNANIMOUS ACTION
Leland W. Cutler, president of (lie
board, stated the action was taken
by unanimous recommendation of
the Trustees' Committee, appointed
in July 1939, to study the problem of
a new president and that every
member of the board joined him in
urging Dr. Wilbur to accept this re
sponsibility.
Herbert C. Hoover, Stanford '95
and former President of the United
States, acts as chairman of the
Trustees' Committee. Other members
include C. O. G. Miller, M. C. Sloss,
W. P. Fuller Jr., Ira S. Lillick, and
Leland W. Cutler, ex-officio.
Dr. Wilbur assumed his post as
President of the University in Jan
uary 1916.
