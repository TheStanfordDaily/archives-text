# Permits Required For Campus Guns
## 
### 
The office of the Dean of Men dis
closed yesterday that although fire
arms are banned at Stanford, stu
dents may possess them if they se
cure a permit from the State Fish
and Game Commission.
Application for this permit may be
secured through the Dean of Men. If
the permit is granted, students must
keep their guns in a locker at the
Reserve Officer Training Corp.s.
Guns may only be taken from the
locker upon presentation of the
above-mentioned permit.
Dean of Men John Bunn emphasiz
ed the fact that illegality of pos
session of firearms on campus was
not a University ruling but a ruling
of the State Fish and Game Commis
sion. Possession of firearms on any
game refuge is an offense and Stan
ford is a game refuge. However, the
University will enforce this rule, and
discovery of firearms on campus
will be dealt with severely.
Students who belong to the Rifle
Club may keep guns in the locker
at the rifle range in the basement
of the Administration Building.
