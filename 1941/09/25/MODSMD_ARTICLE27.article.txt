# Mullany Talks On Honor Code
## 
### 
Women transfers at Union heard a
cordial welcome and an informative
talk from Dean M;iry Yost at an
informal after-dinner gathering in
the Women's Clubhouse last night.
This get-together represents an
other forged link in the chain vis
ioned by the orientation committee
as joining, quickly and closely, new
transfers to Stanford.
Miss Yost stressed to the new stu
dents what high precedents had been
established for them at Stanford.
"We know that you bring to us a
wealth of new ideas," she said.
Over 100 women heard Miss Yost
as she cautioned against women com
ing to think childishly in these grave
times. Bobby socks, short skirts,
and "yes, even pigtails" are per
fectly acceptable on campus as long
as they do not indicate thought pat
terns to match.
Last night's meeting was similar to
one held recently for women trans
fers at Lagunita. Miss Yost has
spoken to both groups as has Rose
marie Mullany, chairman of Coun
cil, who talked on the Honor Code.
Other events planned for the
transfer include the reception given
tonight by Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur and
the jolly-up planned by men trans
fers for the women. Hope Branum
is chairman of the transfer orienta
tion committee.
