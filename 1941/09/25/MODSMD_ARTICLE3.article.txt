# Boards to Defer Eligible Students
## 
### 
Permission has been granted local
boards by the selective service
headquarters to postpone military
service of college students for whom
immediate induction would cause
hardship.
Students will now be able to com
plete the current quarter's work be
fore being called, though if the stu
' dent knows in advance of enroll
j ment that he is due for induction, no
j postponement may be expected.
The new procedure is applicable
i regardless of the course being pur
j sued by the student.
