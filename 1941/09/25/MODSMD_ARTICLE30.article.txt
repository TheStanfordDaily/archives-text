# Committee to Aid Stanford Volunteer Ambulance Drivers
## 
### 
The Commander in Chief of the British forces in Cairo has made an
appeal which has been approved by the State Department in Washington
and relayed to Stanford University. Volunteers to drive ambulances in
Africa and the Middle East are wanted immediately.
Professor Edgar E. Robinson of the Department of History has agreed

to form a committee on the campus
to assist students who wish to vol
unteer for this overseas service.
"Joining this ambulance service,"
declared Professor Robinson, "offers
a rare opportunity, during these his-

toric hours, to render a civilian
service when such humanitarian aid
is most needed."
A similar unit of American Field
Service volunteers was organized at
Stanford early in 1917. All together
54 Stanford men left for overseas
duty as ambulance drivers before
the United States entered the war.
The flag which Stanford volunteers
took overseas has since become his
toric as the first American flag to
be officially displayed on the field of
battle in France.
During the present war, the
American Field Service has fur
nished surgical ambulance and mo
bile first aid units to the American
Ambulance, Great Britain; to the
Free French forces; to the Greek
Relief Association; and now plans to
materially aid the British and Allied
forces in the Middle East.
The present program, as an
nounced by Stephen Galatti, direc
tor-general of the American Field
Service in New York, calls for 400
ambulances, properly equipped and
manned with volunteer personnel.
Only American citizens are accept
able. Men of draft age must secure
releases from their local boards. All
expenses will be paid, but applicants
should be able to furnish their own
transportation to New York. Volun
teers must agree to serve for a mini
mum period of one year.
The American Field Service Com
mittee for Northern California, for
which Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur has
accepted the honorary presidency,
has opened an office in San Fran
cisco at 703 Market Street. Full de
tails may be had at that address
from Perry Patton, who is acting as
secretary for the Northern California
committee. Joseph Eastman and
Frank Taylor, who were members of
the original Stanford ambulance unit,
are also serving on this committee.
Members of Dr. Robinson's com
mittee for Stanford are Prof. Hardin
Craig, Prof. Albert Guerard, Dr.
J. P. Mitchell, registrar, and Dr. D.
Elton Trueblood, University chap
lain.

is most needed."

Stanford early in 1917. All together
54 Stanford men left for overseas
duty as ambulance drivers before
the United States entered the war.
