# Living Costs At Co-op Hit Low For Farm
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Room and board for only $28 a
month—that's how the 17 members
of Stanford's first co-operative are
financing college. Unique in Farm
history, the Walter Thompson Co
operative House was founded last
Spring Quarter by 14 self-support
ing students as a non-profit, self
governing home.
By purchasing food and supplies
as a group, the members eat for
less than 70 cents a day, pay only $2
a week rent. All purchases are made
through student-elected representa
tives — a president, manager, and
secretary. At the end of every quar
ter cash rebates are distributed to
the members.
With more than 50 per cent of its
members holders of Stanford schol
arships, the plan of co-operative
education is especially helpful to
new students. No "grinds," the co
op members also maintain an inex
pensive social program with several
house parties every quarter.
All necessary work around the
house is done by the members. Once
a week a co-operative cleaning
takes an hour of each member's
time.
Several vacancies in the co-op
eating club still exist, and there is
still room for one more roomer.
Students interested in applying
should contact Willard Mitchell at
the Walter Thompson Co-operative
House, 536 Alvarado Row.
