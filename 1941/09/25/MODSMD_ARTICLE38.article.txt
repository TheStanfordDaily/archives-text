## Indians Stress Defense In Workout for Ducks; Vucinich Toe Recovers 
### H. D. THOREAU 
With the whole team in suits and looking like they will he in top shape
by Saturday for the season's opener with the l)u<ks from Eugene, Caaeh
Clark put his charges through a light workout emphasizing the defensive
work of (lie line and line backers.
Milt Vucinich, after bulging his muscles for the visiting fotogs, took

an active part in the drills, appar
ently having no trouble with the
infected toe which kept him out of
suit Tuesday.
Chuck Taylor and Pete Kmetovic
were nursing slight which
they protected by donning red-rid
ingrhood-jackets as the sun sank
behind the Hoover Libe.
CENIEK INSTRUCTED
After an extended session with
the blackboard, the lirst three teams
were given defensive sharpening by
the scrubs working Oregon plays.
Coach Shaughnessy spent much
time instructing the center of the
line arid the line backers on their
duties while the Ducks are in pos
session of the ball.
"One-eye" Albert dispelled all
rumors that he isn't kicking up to
his last season form by booting sev
eral over 00 yards. Frank Forbes,
his understudy, who will remain in
school until his entrance into the
air corps December 24, made no at
tempt to retrieve Albert's boots, they
were so far beyond him.
SHELLEB MISHAP
Also kicking them into the big
numbers was Willard Sheller, trans
fer from L.B.J.C. Sheller, during
the offensive work, suffered the af
ternoon's only mishap while run
ning at the second string fullback
spot. He had a slight nasal hemor
rhage after running into an uniden
tified object.
With the Stamm, Taylor, Lind
skog, LaPrade, Banducci combina
tion holding fast in the middle of
the forward line, the end positions
were the only ones in doubt. Shaugh
nessy announced his starting lineup
for Saturday's game with Fred
Meyer at right end an i Arnold Mei
ners at left. However, today Hank
Norberg and Meyer were handling
the posts with Meiners subbing at
both sides. Judge for yourself.
Stanford has won 13, lost 2, and
tied 1 of their games with the Ducks,
which started in 1900.
