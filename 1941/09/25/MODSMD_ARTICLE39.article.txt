# Experts Favor Brown Bomber

NEW YORK, Sept. 24 (UP).â€”A
sports writer, so bewildered by the
hodgepodge of angles to the Louis-
Nova fight that he is unable as yet
to pick a winner, sounded expert
opinion today with a poll of Cauli
flower Canyon and environs.
The poll showed 35 persons who
select Louis to retain his heavy
weight championship Monday night,
and 25 who say challenger Nova
will win. Virtually all anticipate a
knockout, regardless of the victor.
The 60 persons questioned included
sports editors, columnists, boxing
writers, radio commentators, fight
managers, promoters, trainers, and
ex-champions.
This poll reveals that the current
betting odds of 14-5, favoring Louis,
do not accurately reflect the senti
ment of experts, who favor the
champion only at a 7-5 ratio.
