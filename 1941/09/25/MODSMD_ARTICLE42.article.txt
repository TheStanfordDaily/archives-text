# N.C.A.A. Golf Lost to Farm
## 
### 
The European bickering has not
only robbed Stanford of some of its
outstanding students, but it has
thwarted the Farm and the Stanford
golf course in their plan to hold the
N.C.A.A. golf championships here
next June.
Coach Eddie Twiggs, after exten
sive investigation, withdrew Stan
ford's bid for the tourney due to the
unsettled national situation at pres
ent. In his interviews with the
mentors of large Eastern and Mid
western schools he found that they
would be unable to send full teams
west and in some cases have no
representation at all.
NOTRE DAME HOST
Under present arrangements the
tournament will be held in South
Bend, Indiana, under the direction
ol Notre Dame. Coach Twiggs fully
approved of the change, saying that
the Hoosier course is one of the
country s best and will make for
excellent matches.
Louisiana State has every man re
turning to the team which finished
second to the victorious local boys
last year, while four of the Indians'
touring six are definitely gone and
a fifth is apt to be selectively serv
iced soon.
Three bright frosh prospects plus
an ineligible transfer from last year
change the picture from black to
tattle-tale gray. Frank McCann,
George Traphagan, and Jack Wil
son are the sophs, and Bob Barber
the transfer.
McCann reached the finals of the
Invitational tourney held here this
summer. Only sub-par golf by
Biownell kept him from annexing
the title. Barber, who attended the
University of Washington as a frosh,
experienced the same difficulty last
spring in the school championships
after he too had reached the final
lound. Sandy Tatum is the return
ing vet.
FROSH OUTLOOK BRIGHT
Twiggs has no worries concerning
the Papoose outfit with four sec
tional junior champs already in the
fold. Gordon Erickson and Bill Low
both hail from Southern California,
where they have made names for
themselves in golfing circles al
ready.
From Portland comes Johnny Shu
ler and from Illinois comes Bob
Rosecrance. Rosecrance, along with
being state junior champ and divi
sional interseholastic title-holder,
was one of the low medalists in the
recent Great Lakes amateur tourney.

second to the victorious local boys
last year, while four of the Indians'
touring six are definitely gone and
a fifth is apt to be selectively serv
iced soon.
Three bright frosh prospects plus
an ineligible transfer from last year
change the picture from black to
tattle-tale gray. Frank McCann,
George Traphagan, and Jack Wil
son are the sophs, and Bob Barber
the transfer.
McCann reached the finals of the
Invitational tourney held here this
summer. Only sub-par golf by
Biownell kept him from annexing
the title. Barber, who attended the
University of Washington as a frosh,
experienced the same difficulty last
spring in the school championships
after he too had reached the final
lound. Sandy Tatum is the return
ing vet.
FROSH OUTLOOK BRIGHT
Twiggs has no worries concerning
the Papoose outfit with four sec
tional junior champs already in the
fold. Gordon Erickson and Bill Low
both hail from Southern California,
where they have made names for
themselves in golfing circles al
ready.
From Portland comes Johnny Shu
ler and from Illinois comes Bob
Rosecrance. Rosecrance, along with
being state junior champ and divi
sional interseholastic title-holder,
was one of the low medalists in the
recent Great Lakes amateur tourney.
The European bickering has not
only robbed Stanford of some of its
outstanding students, but it has
thwarted the Farm and the Stanford
golf course in their plan to hold the
N.C.A.A. golf championships here
next June.
Coach Eddie Twiggs, after exten
sive investigation, withdrew Stan
ford's bid for the tourney due to the
unsettled national situation at pres
ent. In his interviews with the
mentors of large Eastern and Mid
western schools he found that they
would be unable to send full teams
west and in some cases have no
representation at all.
NOTRE DAME HOST
Under present arrangements the
tournament will be held in South
Bend, Indiana, under the direction
ol Notre Dame. Coach Twiggs fully
approved of the change, saying that
the Hoosier course is one of the
country s best and will make for
excellent matches.
Louisiana State has every man re
turning to the team which finished
second to the victorious local boys
last year, while four of the Indians'
touring six are definitely gone and
