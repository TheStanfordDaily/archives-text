# Papoose Eleven Looks Fiery In Early Season Practices
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Harry Shipkey's frosh grid charges were hotter than a fireman's axe
handle yesterday afternoonâ€”at times an eight-man defense kioked like
country humpkins looking for the pea under the walnut shells.
It was Bobby Andrews at quarter who played (he magician's part,
faking and hugging an imaginary pigskin to keep the defense tied up
tighter than a Scotchman's purser

strings.
Mark Caffall, also battling mightily
for a starting berth at quarter, is
making it tough for "Andy" to win
the call at the key position in men
tor Shipkey's modified "Key" for
mation. Cannon Parkinson, another
standout for quarter, tailed off a bit
with a sore arm.
OFFENSE OUTCHARGED
Stacked against two offensive
squads, the eight-man defense fre
quently outcharged its opponents
and threw ball carriers for substan
tial losses.
Dave Brown seems better and bet
ter at left end. He alternated from
defense to offense and handled the
position like a veteran. Pete Au
gust, pushing Brown for the left end
call, had the mercury shoes for a bit
and it's a nip and tuck decision as
to who will start.
On defense George Presley had to
be knocked flat to be kept out of the
play, same going for Frank Moulton,
Jim Cowin, and Bill Young.
BACKS WINGFOOTED
Shipkey's backs are easing into
the difficult "T" scheme more and
more every practice, and all are
speed-burners of the 9.9 variety.
Fred Parsons and Jimmy Pettit
are as nice a pair of slashing half
backs as the yearling mentor could
ask for, ably backed up by Ross
Dana, Fritz Sanderman, and Don
Zappetini. Deciding the two starters
from that five will be a problem for
only Shipkey to decide.
On the right flank Jack Heald has
just about sewed up Ihe goods, with
Don Wallace close behind.

Tackles were Young and Harvey
Bernhard, while Cowin and Andy
Sogorka plugged up the guards.
Center Jim McCurdy missed scrim
mage again, and tomorrow will tell
whether or not he will be able to
play Saturday against Bakersfield.
Dave Pate went to the showers
early with a sore ankle, Clem Woods
and Russ Oplinger filling in at the
bucking spot.
