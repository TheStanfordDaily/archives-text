### DON SELBY 
WTORIES emanating from Eugene, Ore., the home of the University of
Oregon, say that Bob Koch, former Papoose grid star purged by Ath
! erton. is very likely to start Saturday's contest which pits the Ducks against
i the Indians.
They say that Jimmy Newquist, the veteran fullback, is ailing and that
Koch has the stuff to pinch hit for him. We don't doubt that Newquist
is ailing nor that Koch has plenty on the ball, but it does seem that Tex
Oliver may be taking advantage of the old psychological angle, too. After
all, wouldn't Koch be likely to play just a little bit better ball before the
student body of which he was a member not so long ago? It's the same
idea of a boy putting on a better show before his home fans when he has
been away for a while.
Coaches often start a second-stringer if the game is to be played in that
boy's home town and, although Koch's home town is actually Portland,
; the idea will be the same. But, as we said before, it doesn't seem probable
! that what Koch knows about the T formation will be much of a factor
in whether or not the Ducks halt Stanford's vaunted attack.

IT WON'T be long now unlil intramural athletics get under way again.
! This year Bob Burnett will be running the show in the intramural
whirl, and, although he will have lots of work as the new freshman bas
ketball coach, we're counting on the little fireball to come through with
some good work in directing the sports that have the most participants
on the Farm.
To our mind, intramurals are important, and The Daily sports page is
going to feature them accordingly. There can hardly be any doubt but
what you see some very good competition and a fine brand of ball on the
intramural front.
Naturally, football will take the 'mural limelight for the next few
months, and our Hap Everett is going to do his best to give the dope on
the gridiron competition. A little overshadowed by football but important,
nevertheless, will be volleyball and horseshoes, which will be presented in
The Daily by Newt Wise.
Needless to say, as long as Monte Pfyl is playing ball for the Firehouse,
that outfit is going to be riding in the driver's seat, at least until a better
team comes to the front. But the competition is going to be tight, what with
more than two-score outfits in the running, when play once gets under
way. The El Toros, Zetes, Kappa Sigs, Fijis, Delta Chis, Sequoias and
many others have turned in a classy brand of football in past years and
should come through with good seasons again. They can't all win, but you
can bet that every team will put up a terrific fight before going down.

| 11TOPE the powers that be make moves to once again have the moving
i pictures of the Stanford games shown each week to the students. It
] makes a lot of difference in the student body spirit, which, in turn, means
I a great deal to the team. Last spring Marchie Schwartz, Card backfield
| mentor, remarked that the Stanford spirit last fall was as good if not bet
[ ter than any he had ever seen or felt (or whatever it is that you do with
j spirit). The game pictures help keep up that enthusiasm in the middle of
| the week.
