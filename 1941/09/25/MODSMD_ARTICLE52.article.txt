# College or Ambulances
## 
### 
THE waves of war propaganda are lapping
at every doorstep in this country. Their roar
is heard over every radio, they crash into view
in the bold, black type of the nation's news
papers.
And Stanford is sitting up and taking note.
The waves demand attention.
The war is directly responsible for Stanford's
drop in enrollment. Erstwhile Farm students
are enlisting and being drafted into the increas
ing number of branches of this country's armed
forces; others are subjugating their desire for
a higher education to engage in the momen
tarily more lucrative employment of the de
fense industries.
Our university administration has been sin
cerely doing everything in its power to see that
college students receive favorable treatment
with regard to the drafting of men under the
Selective Service Act.
But now our administration seems to have
taken action inconsistent with their claims for
the benefit of completed college education to
the nation's service. College-trained men are to
be the leaders; they are the ones to have the
Herculean task of rebuilding, and preventing
another such catastrophe as the world is now
undergoing; college students should make ev
ery effort to complete their education rather
than taking well-paying unskilled and semi
skilled jobs in defense industry.
On page 2 of today's Daily is printed the news
of the appeal of a British commander in the
Middle East for volunteer ambulance drivers.
They are wanted immediately, it says.
And a committee has been formed at Stanford
"to assist students who wish to volunteer for
this overseas service."
This committee consists of several top-rank
ing men in the University administration.
We are not disagreeing with the fact that
driving an ambulance is a most humanitarian
function. And that the Stanford men who bore
the first American flag in France in the past war
were performing a most honorable and patriotic
act.
Nevertheless it does seem inconsistent to urge
us to stay in college as long as we can, and then
to urge us, by setting up a committee to "assist"
us, to volunteer for civilian overseas service.

a higher education to engage in the momen

Our university administration has been sin
cerely doing everything in its power to see that
college students receive favorable treatment
with regard to the drafting of men under the
Selective Service Act.
But now our administration seems to have
taken action inconsistent with their claims for
the benefit of completed college education to
the nation's service. College-trained men are to
be the leaders; they are the ones to have the
Herculean task of rebuilding, and preventing
another such catastrophe as the world is now
undergoing; college students should make ev
ery effort to complete their education rather
than taking well-paying unskilled and semi
skilled jobs in defense industry.
On page 2 of today's Daily is printed the news
of the appeal of a British commander in the
Middle East for volunteer ambulance drivers.
They are wanted immediately, it says.
And a committee has been formed at Stanford
"to assist students who wish to volunteer for
this overseas service."
This committee consists of several top-rank
ing men in the University administration.
We are not disagreeing with the fact that
driving an ambulance is a most humanitarian
function. And that the Stanford men who bore
the first American flag in France in the past war
were performing a most honorable and patriotic
act.
Nevertheless it does seem inconsistent to urge
us to stay in college as long as we can, and then
to urge us, by setting up a committee to "assist"
us, to volunteer for civilian overseas service.
THE waves of war propaganda are lapping
at every doorstep in this country. Their roar
is heard over every radio, they crash into view
in the bold, black type of the nation's news
papers.
And Stanford is sitting up and taking note.
The waves demand attention.
The war is directly responsible for Stanford's
drop in enrollment. Erstwhile Farm students
are enlisting and being drafted into the increas
ing number of branches of this country's armed
forces; others are subjugating their desire for
a higher education to engage in the momen
tarily more lucrative employment of the de
fense industries.
