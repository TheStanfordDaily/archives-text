# A Word from the Wise . . .

### 
WHAT is before us?
The answer to this question will be pro
vided this morning to students and faculty
members by the man who for over 25 years has
guided the activities of Stanford University from
his desk in the office of the President.
Members of the Stanford Family know Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur will address them straight
from the shoulder, will talk frankly, discuss the
all-too-insecure future objectively.
Most of us have at one time or another called
time out in our own minds to stop and ponder
where we will be and what we will be doing
two, three or five years from now. There are
some who have considered the inevitable pe
riod of reconstruction which will follow the war.
What 'about army demobilization?
What about the defense industries army—air
craft and shipyard workers and the like—what
about future world peace and political reorgani
zation and establishment of national boundaries?
Representatives of 11 nations met in London
yesterday and accepted as a foregone conclu
sion British and American leadership in Europe
after the war. Of course, maybe Hitler won't
see it that way.
Priorities and prices are demanding sacrifices
of every human being, and they are blasting the
underpinnings from a certain notorious Ivory
Tower.

How much longer Congress will wait to act
on the price control legislation which has been
pending more than seven weeks is another
question. Inflation is a dark cloud on the future
horizon.
It is imperative that we take stock and act
to prevent threatened calamities. We should
do it right now. While we roll up our sleeves
in preparation for the job, Dr. Wilbur will tell us
what the nation expects from Stanford.—H. S.
