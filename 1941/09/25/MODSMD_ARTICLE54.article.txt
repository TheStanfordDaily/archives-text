# Opinion Lacking
## 
### 
OUT on the make-up bank where we keep
the standing heads such as "Sideline
Slants" and all the others, there is one which
didn't get into the paper this morning.
It was not that we forgot to put it in; we very
much regret having to keep it out.
You have probably noticed by this time that
we are speaking of "Campus Opinion." We do
not like to have to publish a Daily without this
one of its regular features, as "Campus Opin
ion gets as much or more readership than al
most any other feature of the paper.
But when there is no opinion, we can publish
none.
This column is open to any student, faculty
member or other reader. It is open for criticism
of anything printed in The Daily, for espousal
of any of the presently contesting viewpoints on
national and international problems, for letters
suggesting improvements in any part of Stan
ford; in fact, for almost anything the reader
wishes.
We will devote as much space as possible to
"Campus Opinion." Letters should be kept
within reasonable limits. Our one standing rule
is that all letters to be published must be signed.
The name will be withheld if so requested.
Drop your letters in the mail-box addressed to
the Editor or bring them around to the Shack.
