# The 						Old Question

WTjAVE your student body cards ready- so
Â£i they can be checked at the gate."
What a host of unpleasant memories this
phrase brings to the minds of many students
who have missed an opening kickoff waiting
outside the gate while a skeleton crew of offi
cious B.A.C. cops conducted their F.8.1.-like in
vestigation of anyone they didn't recognize.
Even fellows with Block "S" sweaters.
Students were admitted only through two
small sections of one of the general admission
gates on the Stanford side of the stadium.
Though the plan for identification pictures
on student body cards did not go through this
year, the B.A.C. has promised quick and easy
admittance to the rooting section for all stu
dents, starting this Saturday with the Oregon
game.
The entire crew of Gate G, on the west side
of the stadium nearest the rooting section, will
have as their sole job the punching of student
body cards.
This is a student gate and no general admis
sion tickets will be honored.
This action should eliminate the old griev
ances of all students having to pass through two
narrow wickets and gate-clogging at game time.
