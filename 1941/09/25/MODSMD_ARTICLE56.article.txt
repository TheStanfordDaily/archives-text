# BULL SESSION
## LINDY AND PROPAGANDA 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
WEEK or so ago we were sitting in our house
listening to the radio, when it was announced that
Charles A. Lindbergh was going to make an address.
My father cleared my sister out of the room, threat
ened my little brother into silence and we listened.
Lindbergh had a clear, confident voice and the
words flowed easily into our room. It was beautiful to
hear, but I didn't like what he was saying. I got up
and left the room.
When I came back, I could see that my father was
mad. He had turned the radio ofT, and was muttering
to himself.
"What's the matter?" I asked.
"Lindbergh."
"What about him?"
"He's crazy," he said. "I'm not a Jew, I'm an Arme
nian. I'm not a British subject, I'm an American, and
I'm not a member of any administrative group, I'm a
Republican. Is he trying to toll me I can't hate Hitler?"

J COULDN'T help noticing that a subcommittee of
the Interstate Commerce Committee has been car
rying on an investigation of the movie industry. The
idea is that those connected with the industry have a
stake in Europe, or in our political and economic sys
tem and would like to defeat Hitler and keep things
as they stand. Therefore, through their pictures, they
are subtlely, and sometimes not too subtlely, spreading
propaganda that will arouse public sentiment and even
tually lead the United States into the war.
Now I have no doubt that a lot of people like the
system that we have, and would like to see Hitler stop
ped. I also have no doubt that a lot of people con
nected with the movie industry would like to see our
system preserved. Now, I should suppose that if the
President can come out in favor of war, if newspaper
men can, daily, expound such views; if authors can
write books, if playwrights can write plays, if song
writers can write songs, all with the same theme of
getting us into the war, surely the movies, in between
love scenes and alleged jokes, have the right to do
the same thing.

jVfY MAIN objection to these propaganda pictures is
that on the whole they are artistically bad. Propa
ganda pictures that are otherwise good are all right.
But when they are bad and filled with propaganda
besides, they are intolerable. For instance, in one pic
ture, Clark Gable jumped out of somewhere and
spotted a batch of Japanese soldiers. He curled his
lips, and with the most contemptuous face that ham
of an actor could acquire, he spit out the one word,
"Japs."
That's the kind of propaganda picture I hate to see.
If we could have a senate committee go down to
Hollywood, get by all the beautiful girls, and get the
movie people to concentrate and produce pictures that
are halfway interesting, with plots and characters that
are consistent, then I'm sure everyone would be happy.
