# 'Hamilton Woman' Provides Comedy, 'New' Propaganda
## 
### 
''THAT HAMILTON WOMAN," starring Laurence Oliver and Vivian
Leigh, now playing at the Varsity Theater.
Besides providing an insight into the private love of England's most
revered naval hero, "That Hamilton Woman," also manages to provide
some entertaining comedy and a little of that new Hollywood propaganda,

which is so delightful to pay for.
and sit through.
Laurence Olivier, who can out
swashbuckle Nelson Eddy when he
really tries, portrays the part of
Lord Nelson. Vivian Leigh takes the
part of Lady Hamilton, the wife of
the luxury-loving English ambassa
dor in Naples.
DURING SEA BATTLE
The story takes place during the
time of the English sea battles
against the French in an effort to
stop Napoleon. Mrs. Hamilton's ef
forts in behalf of Nelson succeed
when those of her easy-going hus
band fail, and Nelson soon becomes
attracted to her.
Naturally, the next step is to re
move the romance from the drawing
room, and make it a "soul-stirring"
love affair on the balcony under the
husband's nose. Conveniently, the
husband prefers his art objects to
watching his wife philander. This
also removes the last shreds of punch
that the picture contains.
Best sequences left are the comedy
scenes when Miss Leigh holds con
ferences with her mother concern
ing the methods used to bring down

her next man. The picture restricts
these men to two and the hint of a
third, trying to make her angel-like.
This is a terrible transgression upon
true history.
Advertised thrills of the picture
were shots of Miss Leigh in poses of
Romney's painting of Mrs. Hamil
ton. These will undoubtedly leave
you cold as nothing is the same but
the hat.
Propaganda seeps its way into the
film when Olivier makes a stormy
speech in England about stopping
The Little Corporal before he really
gets going and ruins all the world.
The inference is quite clear, thank
you.
SLAP-HAPPY PIECE
Affectionately Yours, the second
feature, is a fluffy piece involving
a slap-happy foreign correspondent's
efforts to win back his aggressive
wife. The wife, Merle Oberon, does
little that is spectacular except wear
what is probably the lowest-cut
strapless formal in Hays office his
tory. Rita Hayworth is more fully
clothed, and therefore loses.â€”Mull
