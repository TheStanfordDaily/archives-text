# Farm Actors Spend Summer With Theater at Lake Tahoe
## 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Their working day extending from !) in the morning until 2 o'clock at
night, seven Stanford student actors returned from conducting the first
summer theater ever held at Lake Tahoe; worn and weary, hut unwilling
to trade the experience they gained from the venture for any other sort

of summer vacation.
Taking over a small schoolhouse
which had been lent to them, the
players did all their own decorating
and designing for the plays they
produced, using equipment borrowed
from Stanford and from Menlo Jun
ior College.
In the nine-week season, nine
plays were produced, one a week,
playing every night except Monday.
While acting in one play at night,
the players were i*ehearsing the next
week's show and constructing the
necessaiy scenery and effects dur
ing the day.
REALIZE PROFIT
Two prices were charged, 85 cents
and 55 cents. The auditorium seated
140 and it was unusual that a slight
profit was realized at the end of the
season. Most summer theaters just
getting started usually come out in
debt unless they have a financial
backer, which the Tahoe group did
not have. The profit was put back
into equipment for next year.
The play "Private Lives" was the
biggest money-maker, although the
group's two artistic plays, "Gas
light" and "Night Must Fall," did
almost as well financially. In addi
tion to these plays, "Petticoat Fever,"
"Hay Fever," "Our Master's Voice,"
"Mr. Pim Passes By," "The Curtain
Rises," and "Fireman Save My
Child" were produced.
The latter play was an old-fash
ioned melodrama, and the auditorium
seats were taken out and tables and
chairs substituted. Refreshments
were served. Entre acts were given,
old-time singing and dancing being
featured.
HAVE DORMITORIES
The company rented two houses
and converted them into dormitor
ies, one for the boys and one for the
girls. Mrs. B. Q. Morgan acted as
chaperone in addition to playing the
part of the cook in "Night Must

Fall."
The seven Stanford actors were
Frank Burt, Janice Schwenson, Lois
Feldhym, Ted Marcuse, Jeanne
Smith, Hal Millen and Donna Good
heart. In addition there were stu
dents from San Mateo and San
Jose State in the company. Marcuse
and Burt were in charge of the di
recting, Hal Millen was technical di
rector, and Lois Feldhym had charge
of the finances.
During the summer the players
tried their hand at everything—di
recting. producing, acting—and gain
ed working experience in all of these
fields. Barring the fact that the cur
tain of the stage would only work
spasmodically, causing several em
barrassing moments, it was, in their
opinion, a swell summer.

and 55 cents. The auditorium seated
140 and it was unusual that a slight
profit was realized at the end of the
season. Most summer theaters just
getting started usually come out in
debt unless they have a financial
backer, which the Tahoe group did
not have. The profit was put back
into equipment for next year.
The play "Private Lives" was the
biggest money-maker, although the
group's two artistic plays, "Gas
light" and "Night Must Fall," did
almost as well financially. In addi
tion to these plays, "Petticoat Fever,"
"Hay Fever," "Our Master's Voice,"
"Mr. Pim Passes By," "The Curtain
Rises," and "Fireman Save My
Child" were produced.
The latter play was an old-fash
ioned melodrama, and the auditorium
seats were taken out and tables and
chairs substituted. Refreshments
were served. Entre acts were given,
old-time singing and dancing being
featured.
HAVE DORMITORIES
The company rented two houses
and converted them into dormitor
ies, one for the boys and one for the
girls. Mrs. B. Q. Morgan acted as
chaperone in addition to playing the
part of the cook in "Night Must

Fall."
The seven Stanford actors were
Frank Burt, Janice Schwenson, Lois
Feldhym, Ted Marcuse, Jeanne
Smith, Hal Millen and Donna Good
heart. In addition there were stu
dents from San Mateo and San
Jose State in the company. Marcuse
and Burt were in charge of the di
recting, Hal Millen was technical di
rector, and Lois Feldhym had charge
of the finances.
During the summer the players
tried their hand at everything—di
recting. producing, acting—and gain
ed working experience in all of these
fields. Barring the fact that the cur
tain of the stage would only work
spasmodically, causing several em
barrassing moments, it was, in their
opinion, a swell summer.
Their working day extending from !) in the morning until 2 o'clock at
night, seven Stanford student actors returned from conducting the first
summer theater ever held at Lake Tahoe; worn and weary, hut unwilling
to trade the experience they gained from the venture for any other sort

of summer vacation.
Taking over a small schoolhouse
which had been lent to them, the
players did all their own decorating
and designing for the plays they
produced, using equipment borrowed
from Stanford and from Menlo Jun
ior College.
In the nine-week season, nine
plays were produced, one a week,
playing every night except Monday.
While acting in one play at night,
the players were i*ehearsing the next
week's show and constructing the
necessaiy scenery and effects dur
ing the day.

and 55 cents. The auditorium seated
