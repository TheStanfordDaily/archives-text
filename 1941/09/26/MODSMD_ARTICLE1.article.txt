### AMIE REICHERT 
Senator Tobcy put it, "A little
nonsense now and then is rel
ished by the best of men."
Senator Tobcy is not a kindly
rosy-cheeked old gentleman in a
novel about the Deep South. Sena
tor Tobey is a member of the United
State Senate and a member of Bur
ton K. Wheeler's isolationist-packed
subcommittee which is currently
"investigating" the propaganda of
the movie industry.
Senator Tobey was not chucking
a Hollywood "ping" girl or an At
lantic City bathing beauty under
the chin when he made that state
ment. No sir. Senator Tobcy was
casting this pearl into the current
Senatorial inquiry.
Senator Tobey is a poet. He is
also a wiser man than he knows.
Never was a truer word spoken.
a»t * *
several weeks now an investi
gation to determine whether
there shall be an investigation has
been going on in Washington. A
sub-committee consisting of isola
tionist die-hards hand-picked by
Senator Wheeler has been going
through an incredible series of
verbal acrobatics and pseudo-legal
istic antics in order to frame the
motion picture industry.
Their performance makes "Of
Thee I Sing" look like a Sunday
school picnic.
The United States Senate has
never been accused of being digni
fied. True to form, yesterday's
movie-inquiry session presented the
world—and Dr. Goebbels—with the
ludicrous spectacle of a United
States Senator and a defeated presi
dential nominee calling each other
respectively a liar and a hypocrite.

D. *)RTH CLARK,
k who several w <, ago carved a
very special niche himself in the
hearts of all Latin Americans when
he suggested U.S. seizure of South
America, accused Wendell Willkie of
"campaign oratory" promises.
To which Willkie shouted, "When
you say that you speak an abso
lute falsehood. You've made state
ments over this country that never
were said, that bear no semblance to
facts."
That's the way the whole investi
gation to see whether we shall have
an investigation has been going.
This is the gravest crisis in
American history. But Senator
Tobcy is busy writing poetry and
relishing nonsense. And Senator
Clark i> immortalizing himself as
one of the biggest clowns of the
year.

both Berlin and Moscow
last night came reports of des
perate and violent Soviet counter-at
tacks from Odessa, Leningrad, and
the pocket east of Kiev where
much of Marshall Simon Budenny's
army was trapped by the German
invaders.
Meanwhile from London there
came authoritative reports that
Britain was rushing tanks to
southern Russia by every avail
able boat. If the tanks get there
in lime, they will be used in an
attempt to thwart the Nazi drive
through the Crimea to the Cau
casus.
Already some 70,000 German
troops are blitzing through this re
gion and as far as is known Russian
resistance here has not been able to
slow them down appreciably. Nazi
sources claim that the Germans
have severed communications be
tween the Crimea and the Ukrain
ian mainland.
* s{« *
WHOULD the Germans push this
k new spearhead forward to the
eastern shore of the peninsula, only
the four-mile strait of Ycnikale
would separate them from the heart
—and the oil—of the Caucasus.
In an eleventh-hour attempt to
avert this catastrophe, the British
have increased the capacity of all
their supply routes to Russia. The
highways, railroads, and ports of
the Middle East as well are now im
portant arterials carrying tanks,
weapons, and munitions to the Red
Army.
The question is: will the supplies
get there in time?
