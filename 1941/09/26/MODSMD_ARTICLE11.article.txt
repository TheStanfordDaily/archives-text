"To h— with '44" echoed through

pavilion last night as a small, but
vociferous group of freshman men

"If ever a team were on a spot,
we're on it this year. Oregon is go

enough to anticipate anything they
might pull, but we'll need you root

Coach Shaughnessy introduced the
senior members of the team, and then
concluded: "I hope the fates are as
good to us as they were last year.

"To h— with '44" echoed through
the drafty reaches of the basketball
pavilion last night as a small, but
vociferous group of freshman men
cried defiance to their seniors,
launching the 1941 season.
Despite the small representation of
freshman men, the crowd totaled to
a greater attendance than has been
seen at. an opening rally since the

hey-dey of the famed "Vow Boys,"
according to Pi Thornton, co-chair
man of Rally Committee.
Hal McCrcary, '26, and captain of
a '26 Rose Bowl team, guest speaker,
set the keynote for the evening
when he said, "You've all heard of
the "V" campaign. Well, this is a
double-V campaign—Victorious Var
sity '
Then the crowd-surged to its feet
to welcome Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy. After paying a tribute to the
"Stanford spirit" he commented:
"You know, I'm a sort of sopho
more myself."
"To h— with '44," wailed a fresh

Shaughnessy laughed and went on.
"If ever a team were on a spot,
we're on it this year. Oregon is go

to death if we beat them. Maybe
they're hiding something new, but
the team seems to be intelligent
enough to anticipate anything they
might pull, but we'll need you root
ers more than we did last year."
Coach Shaughnessy introduced the
senior members of the team, and then
concluded: "I hope the fates are as
good to us as they were last year.
You know it's a lot more fun to win
than to lose."
Climax of the rally was the pres
entation of the Axe by End Coach
Jim Lawson to A.S.S.U. President
George Jackson, and then:
"Give 'em the Axe, the Axe,'the
