team, ready to jump on the band
wagon when Stanford again out

passes all over the field to all varie
ties of receivers with a changed style
that appears to have lipped his effi
ciency considerably.
STRONG OREGON LINE
Oregon, coming down from Eu
gene for their season opener also,
will appear with a strong line which
will present the Cards with a seri
ous problem for their ground game.
Man for man, the teams released
by the two coaches as their starting
lineups give the local team a definite
edge. However, the psychology fac
tor which so aided Stanford last
season will be against them this year.
Coach Tex Oliver's veteran right
end, Bill Regner, stacks up more
than adequately against Arnold
Meiners, starting Indian left end,
although Stanford takes the edge in
the matter of reserves with Big Hank
Norberg waiting for the call.
ASHCOM vs. STAMM
Lacking in experience but making
up for it in size and ability, Dick
"Cruiser" Ashcom will line up
against Ed Stamm with an equally
big but more experienced man Lo
cope with.
Chuck Taylor, Card guard, stayed
in the rest home all day yesterday
with a cold, but will be in shape to
open the game. He must face the
man he faced for most of last year's
contest, Val Culwell, right side man
in the Ducks' sterling guard duo.
Center finds Vic Lindskog spotting
Oregon's Elliott Wilson, touted as
the second best center on the coast,
30 pounds. This is overlooked, how
ever, when the man rated ahead of
Wilson is Vicious Vic himself.
LA PRADE TO START
With Dick Palmer gone unex
pectedly, the "T" was expected to
miss a few strokes at the right guard
position. This situation has been
more than adequately remedied by
the presence and rapid improvement
of Loren LaPrade, Arizona sopho
more. He must come up against
TufTy Segale, the Webfoots' out
standing lineman and candidate for
all-coast honors.
Bruno Banducci, an All-American
under a blanket, will need little as
sistance in this section of the line
at the right tackle for the "T"-men.
Ed Moshofsky, recently moved up to
the first string, will be doing his
best to vindicate his coach's judg
ment, but he will have a nearly in
surmountable task in Banduch.
Smooth Fred Meyer runs into Jim
Shephard, who has climbed from
third string right end to first string
left. Having played fullback pre
vious to last year and then only 33
minutes of actual end play in games,
the Quack cannot be expected to out
shine a two-year letterman and al -
most. unanimous all-Coast player of
last year.
Although Oliver is noted as bcin.;
an expert in the art of offensive
maneuvers, his backfield material
this year leaves him without an at
tack able to zoom up and down the
| field with eleven capable men en
i deavoiing to hinder them.
SOPH AMONG STARTERS
With the Haliski, Isberg, Berry,
Stenstrom combination 100 per cent
not present, three second-stringers
last season and a sophomore make
up the starters.
Duke Iverson occupies the quar
terback post, or the blocking spot.
He has played almost every position
on the team and is an exceptionally
good pass defender. The offense is
generated by Frank Boyd and Curly
Mecham, the left and right halfs.
Both are triple-threaters but don't
possess too much speed.
Jimmy Newquist, up from the
frosh, has been bothered by illness
this season but will show up well
if in good condition. Taking over
when he is out will be Bob Koch,
resident of Encina Hall, Stanford,
last year, but ineligibilized by Ed
win Athcrton.
KMETOVIC CAPTAIN
Lining up behind Albert to form
the bar of the "T" will be "Perfect
Peter" Kmetovic, captain for the
day; Milt Vucinich, fullback, who
has completely recovered from a toe
infection, and Hoot Armstrong, 67
inches of hustle at right half.
As the kicking team advances to
the ball for the opening boot at 2:31,
Stanford's gridders will be going
after their 12th straight victory, a
streak which started with a despera
tion win over Dartmouth in the
waning days of '39 and went through
the undefeated-untied season of '40
topped by a Ko.se Bowl conquest.

ous problem for their ground game.
Man for man, the teams released
by the two coaches as their starting
lineups give the local team a definite
edge. However, the psychology fac
tor which so aided Stanford last
season will be against them this year.
Coach Tex Oliver's veteran right
end, Bill Regner, stacks up more
than adequately against Arnold
Meiners, starting Indian left end,
although Stanford takes the edge in
the matter of reserves with Big Hank
Norberg waiting for the call.
ASHCOM vs. STAMM
Lacking in experience but making
up for it in size and ability, Dick
"Cruiser" Ashcom will line up
against Ed Stamm with an equally
big but more experienced man Lo
cope with.
Chuck Taylor, Card guard, stayed
in the rest home all day yesterday
with a cold, but will be in shape to
open the game. He must face the
man he faced for most of last year's
contest, Val Culwell, right side man
in the Ducks' sterling guard duo.
Center finds Vic Lindskog spotting
Oregon's Elliott Wilson, touted as
the second best center on the coast,
30 pounds. This is overlooked, how
ever, when the man rated ahead of
Wilson is Vicious Vic himself.
LA PRADE TO START
With Dick Palmer gone unex
pectedly, the "T" was expected to
miss a few strokes at the right guard
position. This situation has been
more than adequately remedied by
the presence and rapid improvement
of Loren LaPrade, Arizona sopho
more. He must come up against
TufTy Segale, the Webfoots' out
standing lineman and candidate for
all-coast honors.
Bruno Banducci, an All-American
under a blanket, will need little as
sistance in this section of the line
at the right tackle for the "T"-men.
Ed Moshofsky, recently moved up to
the first string, will be doing his
best to vindicate his coach's judg
ment, but he will have a nearly in
surmountable task in Banduch.
Smooth Fred Meyer runs into Jim
Shephard, who has climbed from
third string right end to first string
left. Having played fullback pre
vious to last year and then only 33
minutes of actual end play in games,
the Quack cannot be expected to out
shine a two-year letterman and al -
most. unanimous all-Coast player of
last year.
Although Oliver is noted as bcin.;
an expert in the art of offensive
maneuvers, his backfield material
this year leaves him without an at
tack able to zoom up and down the
| field with eleven capable men en
i deavoiing to hinder them.
SOPH AMONG STARTERS
With the Haliski, Isberg, Berry,
Stenstrom combination 100 per cent
not present, three second-stringers
last season and a sophomore make
up the starters.
Duke Iverson occupies the quar
terback post, or the blocking spot.
He has played almost every position
on the team and is an exceptionally
good pass defender. The offense is
generated by Frank Boyd and Curly
Mecham, the left and right halfs.
Both are triple-threaters but don't
possess too much speed.
Jimmy Newquist, up from the
frosh, has been bothered by illness
this season but will show up well
if in good condition. Taking over
when he is out will be Bob Koch,
resident of Encina Hall, Stanford,
last year, but ineligibilized by Ed

KMETOVIC CAPTAIN
Lining up behind Albert to form
the bar of the "T" will be "Perfect
Peter" Kmetovic, captain for the
day; Milt Vucinich, fullback, who
has completely recovered from a toe
infection, and Hoot Armstrong, 67
inches of hustle at right half.
As the kicking team advances to
the ball for the opening boot at 2:31,
Stanford's gridders will be going

streak which started with a despera

the presence and rapid improvement

Ed Moshofsky, recently moved up to
the first string, will be doing his
best to vindicate his coach's judg
ment, but he will have a nearly in
surmountable task in Banduch.
Smooth Fred Meyer runs into Jim
Shephard, who has climbed from
third string right end to first string
left. Having played fullback pre
vious to last year and then only 33
minutes of actual end play in games,
the Quack cannot be expected to out
shine a two-year letterman and al -

Although Oliver is noted as bcin.;
an expert in the art of offensive
maneuvers, his backfield material
this year leaves him without an at

SOPH AMONG STARTERS
With the Haliski, Isberg, Berry,
Stenstrom combination 100 per cent
not present, three second-stringers
last season and a sophomore make
up the starters.
Duke Iverson occupies the quar
terback post, or the blocking spot.
He has played almost every position
on the team and is an exceptionally
good pass defender. The offense is
generated by Frank Boyd and Curly
Mecham, the left and right halfs.
Both are triple-threaters but don't
possess too much speed.
Jimmy Newquist, up from the
frosh, has been bothered by illness
this season but will show up well
if in good condition. Taking over
when he is out will be Bob Koch,
resident of Encina Hall, Stanford,
last year, but ineligibilized by Ed
win Athcrton.
KMETOVIC CAPTAIN
Lining up behind Albert to form
the bar of the "T" will be "Perfect
Peter" Kmetovic, captain for the
day; Milt Vucinich, fullback, who
has completely recovered from a toe
infection, and Hoot Armstrong, 67
inches of hustle at right half.
As the kicking team advances to
the ball for the opening boot at 2:31,
Stanford's gridders will be going
after their 12th straight victory, a
streak which started with a despera
tion win over Dartmouth in the
waning days of '39 and went through
the undefeated-untied season of '40

Smooth Fred Meyer runs into Jim
Shephard, who has climbed from
third string right end to first string
left. Having played fullback pre
vious to last year and then only 33
minutes of actual end play in games,
the Quack cannot be expected to out
shine a two-year letterman and al -
most. unanimous all-Coast player of
last year.
Although Oliver is noted as bcin.;
an expert in the art of offensive
maneuvers, his backfield material
this year leaves him without an at
tack able to zoom up and down the
| field with eleven capable men en
i deavoiing to hinder them.
SOPH AMONG STARTERS
With the Haliski, Isberg, Berry,
Stenstrom combination 100 per cent
not present, three second-stringers
last season and a sophomore make
up the starters.
Duke Iverson occupies the quar
terback post, or the blocking spot.
He has played almost every position
on the team and is an exceptionally
good pass defender. The offense is
generated by Frank Boyd and Curly
Mecham, the left and right halfs.
Both are triple-threaters but don't
possess too much speed.
Jimmy Newquist, up from the
frosh, has been bothered by illness
this season but will show up well
if in good condition. Taking over
when he is out will be Bob Koch,
resident of Encina Hall, Stanford,
last year, but ineligibilized by Ed
win Athcrton.
KMETOVIC CAPTAIN
Lining up behind Albert to form
the bar of the "T" will be "Perfect
Peter" Kmetovic, captain for the
day; Milt Vucinich, fullback, who
has completely recovered from a toe
infection, and Hoot Armstrong, 67
inches of hustle at right half.
As the kicking team advances to
the ball for the opening boot at 2:31,
Stanford's gridders will be going
after their 12th straight victory, a
streak which started with a despera
tion win over Dartmouth in the
waning days of '39 and went through
the undefeated-untied season of '40
topped by a Ko.se Bowl conquest.
The following lineup shows the
weight of the various starting men,
giving Oregon a considerable ad

ready to throw verbal tomatoes if
Saturday's children aren't perform
ing up to the excellence of the 1940
team, ready to jump on the band
wagon when Stanford again out
offenses all offenses, Albert threw
passes all over the field to all varie
ties of receivers with a changed style
that appears to have lipped his effi
ciency considerably.
STRONG OREGON LINE
Oregon, coming down from Eu
gene for their season opener also,
will appear with a strong line which
will present the Cards with a seri
ous problem for their ground game.
Man for man, the teams released
by the two coaches as their starting
lineups give the local team a definite
edge. However, the psychology fac
tor which so aided Stanford last
season will be against them this year.
Coach Tex Oliver's veteran right
end, Bill Regner, stacks up more
than adequately against Arnold
Meiners, starting Indian left end,
although Stanford takes the edge in
the matter of reserves with Big Hank
Norberg waiting for the call.
ASHCOM vs. STAMM
Lacking in experience but making
up for it in size and ability, Dick
"Cruiser" Ashcom will line up
against Ed Stamm with an equally
big but more experienced man Lo
cope with.
Chuck Taylor, Card guard, stayed
in the rest home all day yesterday
with a cold, but will be in shape to
open the game. He must face the
man he faced for most of last year's
contest, Val Culwell, right side man
in the Ducks' sterling guard duo.
Center finds Vic Lindskog spotting
Oregon's Elliott Wilson, touted as
the second best center on the coast,
30 pounds. This is overlooked, how
ever, when the man rated ahead of
Wilson is Vicious Vic himself.
LA PRADE TO START
With Dick Palmer gone unex
pectedly, the "T" was expected to
miss a few strokes at the right guard
position. This situation has been
more than adequately remedied by
the presence and rapid improvement
of Loren LaPrade, Arizona sopho
more. He must come up against
TufTy Segale, the Webfoots' out
standing lineman and candidate for
all-coast honors.
Bruno Banducci, an All-American
under a blanket, will need little as
sistance in this section of the line
at the right tackle for the "T"-men.
Ed Moshofsky, recently moved up to
the first string, will be doing his
best to vindicate his coach's judg
ment, but he will have a nearly in
surmountable task in Banduch.
