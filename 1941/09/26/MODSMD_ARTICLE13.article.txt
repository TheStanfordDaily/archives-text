# OREGON'S WEBFOOTS INVADE FARM
## Cards Favored To Win Opener Mighty Webfoot Line Threatens To Stop Redskins' Ground Game 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Frank Culling Albert is still the hu)> around which Uic Stanford varsity
football team and the "T" formation revolves. This was repealed when
Coach Clark Shaughncssy called for a passing drill at the semi-final prepa
ration for tomorrow's xame with the Oregon Wehfoots in the stadium
at 2:30.
As the football world waits impatiently for a view of Mr. Shaughncssy's»
__ » second edition of the "Wow Boys,"

ready to throw verbal tomatoes if
Saturday's children aren't perform
ing up to the excellence of the 1940
team, ready to jump on the band
wagon when Stanford again out
offenses all offenses, Albert threw
passes all over the field to all varie
ties of receivers with a changed style
that appears to have lipped his effi
ciency considerably.
STRONG OREGON LINE
Oregon, coming down from Eu
gene for their season opener also,
will appear with a strong line which
will present the Cards with a seri
ous problem for their ground game.
Man for man, the teams released
by the two coaches as their starting
lineups give the local team a definite
edge. However, the psychology fac
tor which so aided Stanford last
season will be against them this year.
Coach Tex Oliver's veteran right
end, Bill Regner, stacks up more
than adequately against Arnold
Meiners, starting Indian left end,
although Stanford takes the edge in
the matter of reserves with Big Hank
Norberg waiting for the call.
ASHCOM vs. STAMM
Lacking in experience but making
up for it in size and ability, Dick
"Cruiser" Ashcom will line up
against Ed Stamm with an equally
big but more experienced man Lo
cope with.
Chuck Taylor, Card guard, stayed
in the rest home all day yesterday
with a cold, but will be in shape to
open the game. He must face the
man he faced for most of last year's
contest, Val Culwell, right side man
in the Ducks' sterling guard duo.
Center finds Vic Lindskog spotting
Oregon's Elliott Wilson, touted as
the second best center on the coast,
30 pounds. This is overlooked, how
ever, when the man rated ahead of
Wilson is Vicious Vic himself.
LA PRADE TO START
With Dick Palmer gone unex
pectedly, the "T" was expected to
miss a few strokes at the right guard
position. This situation has been
more than adequately remedied by
the presence and rapid improvement
of Loren LaPrade, Arizona sopho
more. He must come up against
TufTy Segale, the Webfoots' out
standing lineman and candidate for
all-coast honors.
Bruno Banducci, an All-American
under a blanket, will need little as
sistance in this section of the line
at the right tackle for the "T"-men.
Ed Moshofsky, recently moved up to
the first string, will be doing his
best to vindicate his coach's judg
ment, but he will have a nearly in
surmountable task in Banduch.
Smooth Fred Meyer runs into Jim
Shephard, who has climbed from
third string right end to first string
left. Having played fullback pre
vious to last year and then only 33
minutes of actual end play in games,
the Quack cannot be expected to out
shine a two-year letterman and al -
most. unanimous all-Coast player of
last year.
