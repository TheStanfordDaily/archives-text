# 'Thunder Rock,' Anniversary Show, to Start Wednesday
## 
### 
With a message of hope for the
future during these troubled times,
Robert Ardrey's "Thunder Rock," a
dramatic production, will be pre
sented next Wednesday and Thurs
day nights as a part of the Fiftieth
Anniversary Celebration program.
Ardrey's play deals with a Mr.
Charleston, a former newspaper
man, who has taken refuge from
reality in a lighthouse on Lake
Michigan. "Thunder Rock" cleverly
portrays the past and present simul
taneously as Charleston talks with
some characters he has in his mind
who were shipwrecked at the light
house in 1848.
The production opens as Streater,
a friend of the ex-newspaperman,
visits the lighthouse and asks
Charleston why he is there. Direct
ly opposite from his friend, Streater
wants to get into the middle of
things; so he has decided to fly for
the Chinese. Charleston claims he
isn't living alone, but has characters
in his mind which give him consola
tion.
KEEPER HEARS HEROES
In the second act the characters,
Charleston's mental heroes, come to
life and talk with the lighthouse
keeper. Charleston, surprised, finds
that they, too, were running away
from life. Representing many walks
of life, they tell him their troubles.
He shows them, by his knowledge of
what has happened after 1848. that
all of their problems have been
solved.
Finally, he comes to the conclu
sion that if the world was discour
aged in 1848, why should it be dis
couraged now? Realizing that he
has been wrong all of the time, he
grabs his typewriter and goes back
to his job on the newspaper.
"Thunder Rock" was written two
years ago when the present interna
tional crisis was just beginning to
unfold. It was first presented in
New York, but was not well received
because, as some critics held, New
York was not ready for a message of
hope at the time. It moved to blitz
krieged London, where it was an im
mediate success. "Thunder Rock" is
still playing throughout England to
capacity audiences.
CAST ANNOUNCED
The play was given during sum
mer school with practically the same
cast which will take part next week.
John Hobart, in the San Francisco
Chronicle, said, " 'Thunder Rock' is
... a fascinating show, with dia
logue that catches the pungent flavor
of human speech, and filled with
some very real characters, whether
they're dead ones or alive."
J. P. Cahn, who was a sensation

during the summer production, re
turns again to take the part of Cap
tain Joshua, skipper of the wrecked
ship. Norman Philbrick plays
Charleston; Lyle Mayer, Streater;
Richard Rosenblatt, Nonny; Frank
Burt, inspector; Sylvia Berry, Me
lanie; Donna Goodheart, Miss Kir
by; Adolpho Arias, Dr. Kurtz; Mar
tha Anderson, Anna Marie; and

The show is under the direction of

"Thunder Rock" was written two
years ago when the present interna
tional crisis was just beginning to
unfold. It was first presented in
New York, but was not well received
because, as some critics held, New
York was not ready for a message of
hope at the time. It moved to blitz
krieged London, where it was an im
mediate success. "Thunder Rock" is
still playing throughout England to
capacity audiences.
CAST ANNOUNCED
The play was given during sum
mer school with practically the same
cast which will take part next week.
John Hobart, in the San Francisco
Chronicle, said, " 'Thunder Rock' is
... a fascinating show, with dia
logue that catches the pungent flavor
of human speech, and filled with
some very real characters, whether
they're dead ones or alive."

during the summer production, re

tain Joshua, skipper of the wrecked
ship. Norman Philbrick plays

With a message of hope for the
future during these troubled times,
Robert Ardrey's "Thunder Rock," a
dramatic production, will be pre
sented next Wednesday and Thurs
day nights as a part of the Fiftieth
Anniversary Celebration program.
Ardrey's play deals with a Mr.
Charleston, a former newspaper
man, who has taken refuge from
reality in a lighthouse on Lake
Michigan. "Thunder Rock" cleverly
portrays the past and present simul
taneously as Charleston talks with
some characters he has in his mind
who were shipwrecked at the light
house in 1848.
The production opens as Streater,
a friend of the ex-newspaperman,
visits the lighthouse and asks
Charleston why he is there. Direct
ly opposite from his friend, Streater
wants to get into the middle of
things; so he has decided to fly for
the Chinese. Charleston claims he
isn't living alone, but has characters
in his mind which give him consola
tion.
KEEPER HEARS HEROES
In the second act the characters,
Charleston's mental heroes, come to
life and talk with the lighthouse
keeper. Charleston, surprised, finds
that they, too, were running away
from life. Representing many walks
of life, they tell him their troubles.
He shows them, by his knowledge of
what has happened after 1848. that
all of their problems have been
solved.
Finally, he comes to the conclu
sion that if the world was discour
aged in 1848, why should it be dis
couraged now? Realizing that he
has been wrong all of the time, he
grabs his typewriter and goes back
to his job on the newspaper.
