# Dr. Wilbur Denounces War Without Congress' Consent
## 
### 
To lock us into war without Congressional declaration would be a defi
nite affront to the Constitution, President Hay Lyman Wilbur told students
and faculty members in an all-University assembly yesterday morning.
I Jr. Wilbur spoke on "What Is Before Us?" in Memorial Hall Auditorium
before seme 1 ,(>5O students.
Warning against what be called "glandular thinking," that is, "thinking
with emotions instead of brains," Dr.*

Wilbur described the world as a vic
tim of a manic depressive disease,
passing through a maniacal period
with emotions ruling.
"Now the American people are up
against the greatest of all stupidities,
and that is war," he said emphati
cally. "We can make what took
place in the Thirty Years' War look
like an amateur performance."
He cautioned further that the
speed of today makes even more
dangerous thai great peril of herd
animals, called the stampede.
"There isn't a thing in Europe
that I'd pay a million dead boys for,"
he declaimed.
However, he informed his listen
ers that if this country declares
war, then it is our problem to do
everything we can to contribute.
"We can contribute more to un
derstanding in this world by hand
ing out bread than by looking down
a gun barrel," he continued.
To the individual student, Dr.
Wilbur advised:
"Do the things laid out in front
of you and do them well." "Edu
cation is one thing that can be taken
from you only by illness, indolence
and death," he added.
He told the new students not to
become sheep and follow "billygoal
leadership," for they will only be
led "down the path to the slaugh
terhouse."
