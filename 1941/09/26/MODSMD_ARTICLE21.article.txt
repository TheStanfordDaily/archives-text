When the radio men arrive at the [
Stanford Stadium for the football
game tomorrow, they will find a
much different set-up as far as
working conditions are concerned.
For during the summer, the radio
booths were changed from the
cramped space in the press box to
the top rim of the stadium.
And instead of two small booths,
they will work from four large ones.
To make things even better, Don
Liebendorfer will no longer have to
announce the game over the P.A.
set from the sun-baked box on the
east side of the stadium. His booth, :
too, has been moved to the roof of
the press box.
