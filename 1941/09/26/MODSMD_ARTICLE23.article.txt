BERLIN, Sept. 25 (UP).â€”Red Army and civilian defenders of Hie Len
ingrad "inferno" arc counter-attacking advancing German forces with a
savagery indicating belief in a "miracle," front line dispatches admitted
tonight, but it was said that all Russian thrusts had been repulsed with
the bloodiest losses.
The German forces were said to have stormed three "largish" towns

and a factory in drawing still
their band of flame-spitting steel |
around the ancient city of the Czars, j
where 4,500,000 persons were under i
ceaseless pounding of German dive
bombers and artillery.
Weakening Russian forces still
struggled in the pocket east of Kiev,
the Germans said, but were being
mopped up swiftly. One dispatch i
said that a German division anni
hilated a Soviet unit and captured
1,000 motor vehicles and 150 cannon.
The official DNB news agency
said "several sections" of the Lenin
grad-Murmansk railway were in
Finnish hands. Cutting of the line
would shut off a potential route for
Anglo-American supplies consigned
to Murmansk.
The high command said that the
Germans had found the body of Gen.
M. P. Kirponos, Soviet commander
of the Kiev military district on a
battlefield.
The intensity of the old capital's
defense indicates that "the popula
tion believes the German army can
be conquered by a miracle," a propa
ganda company dispatch said It
added, however, that "the miracle
will not materialize."
Authorized commentators said the
Russians were blasting away cease
lessly with batteries of artillery of
all sizes, machine guns, and anti
aircraft weapons, as well as throw
ing great numbers of infantry and
tajiks into the struggle.
"All Soviet counter-attacks with
infantry and tanks have been re
pulsed with heavy Soviet losses," the
official DNB news agency said.
Informants observed that Lenin
grad's buildings for the most part
were of wood construction, permit
ting the conclusion that the devasta
tion wrought there would exceed any
thus far in the war.
German heavy artillery was said
to be concentrating on naval targets
at the water approach to Leningrad.
DNB said the big guns set fh'e to a
10,000-ton steamer and silenced
Soviet warships attempting to inter
vene in the land fighting.
In air battles over the Finnish
front, DNB said, the Soviets lost
nine planes and a barrage balloon.
A Soviet freighter was reported sunk
in Lake Ladoga.
