# Co-op to Pay Cash For Old Textbooks
## 
### 
A special call is going out from
the Co-op Book Exchange, located
in Room 15 of the Old Union, for
all used Spanish, German, English,
French, Sociology, and Econ text
books. The demand for them will
pay good dividends to students that
are merely crowding this year's
books to find more space, and could
use the cash anyway.
Today is the last day that the
Co-op will stay open in the morning,
but this afternoon and any after
noon business will go on from 1:30
to 4:30.
