## 
### 
When Paul Robeson, famous Ne
gro baritone, appears in the Stan
ford Memorial Auditorium Dec. 1,
he will be accompanied by the Stan
ford choir in the "Ballad for Amer
icans."
This announcement was made by
the Concert Series office yesterday
afternoon simultaneously with the
revelation that a telegram had been
received from Washington the night
before advising that the new tax law
would impose an additional 10 per
cent levy on Concert Series tickets
beginning Oct. 1.
Because of this Manager Helen
Peterson urged all students and
other persons planning to buy sea
sn tickets to do so before the first
of the month. Student season ticket
prices, which arc now $2, $3, $4, and
$5, will be upped to $2.20, $3.30, $4.40
and $5.50 after next Wednesday, and

faculty and general public ducats
will be raised similarly.
The additional tax was part of a
$3,553,400,000 bill which was passed
by Congress and signed by President
Roosevelt late last week. Besides
increasing levies on theater tickets,
the bill lowered income tax ex
emptions and sharply increased cor
poration. and individual taxes.
The "Ballad for Americans" was
introduced last year by Mr. Robe
son, and was the most successful of
many patriotic airs written at that
time. His recording of it has enjoyed
wide popularity, and he has been
repeatedly called upon to sing it at
his concerts.
The Stanford Choir, which is di
rected by Dr. Warren D. Allen of
the Stanford music department, is
considered one of the outstanding
college musical organizations in the
country. It, sings regularly at Me
morial Church services, and it is
often called upon to perform at pub
lic functions in the Bay Area and
elsewhere.
Other artists who will appear on
this year's Concert Series are: Cor
nelia Otis Skinner, impersonator
and dramatic reader; Jose It.urbi,
pianist; and Helen Traubel, soprano.
