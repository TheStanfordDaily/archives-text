# Speaker's Bureau Offers Varied, Valuable Experience
## 
### 
One of the best-known and most successful of all Stanford student
organizations—the Stanford Speakers Service—will this term provide Bay
Area organizations with speakers selected from members of the Stanford
student body.
The Speakers Service accomplishes two main things—it supplies the
service clubs, women's clubs, schools. _____

assemblies, church and other organi- i
zations of this area with interesting, I
able speakers; and it gives students
the most valuable training in oratory
that they can get—actual speaking
experiences before large and varied
audiences.
All types of students participate
every year in the activities of the
Speakers Service, speaking on a
wide range of subjects. Campus po
liticos, graduate students with spe
cialized knowledge, and just ordi
nary students telling their expe
riences as students and vacationers
make up the roster from which the
organizations presenting them are
allowed to pick.
VAKIEI) SUBJECTS
The subjects of the student speak
ers range from world affairs to va
cation experiences, from scientific
dissertations to discussions of Farm
athletics.
The success of the service is at
tested by the large number of re
quests received every year for stu
dent speakers—a number which was
so large last year that almost as
many requests had to be turned
down as were filled. The service
brings to the people of the Bay Area
first-hand news of Stanford, and
gives them as well the student's
viewpoint 011 national and interna
tional affairs.
Expected to be one of the most
popular talks this year will be that
of Colin McClintock, varsity de
bater and football manager, who will
discuss Clark Shaughnessy and the
"T" formation. Although the ros
ter for this year is not yet com
pleted, the recent prominence of
Stanford due to its Fiftieth Anni
versary, its football team and other
miscellany is expected to provide
the speakers with plenty of sub
jects, as well as make them more in
demand.
Among the alumni of the Speakers
Service are Bruce Jessup and George
Jackson, A.S.S.U. presidents of
1940-41 and 1941-42 respectively.
Jackson recently said that his work
with the Service, which he managed
last year, was "one of my most val
uable experiences at Stanford."
LAST YEAR'S TALKS
Among the more popular talks
last year was a discussion of Japan
by Bill Turner and Hugh O'Don
nell, who represented Stanford at the
1940 American - Japanese Student
Conference held in Japan; a discus
sion ol' war-torn Europe by Walt
Stoessel, who had finished an ex
tended trip through that continent
just b(ifore the war broke out in
1939; and "The N;ivy through a
Porthole," by Bruce Jessup, who

spent the summer of 1940 on a Naval
Reserve cruise.
Manager of the Speakers Service
this year will be Frank Bauman,
who is already casting around for
new talent and will announce the
full roster for this year early in
October. Concurrent with this an
nouncement will be the publishing
of a booklet explaining the service
and listing this year's speakers and
their subjects.
