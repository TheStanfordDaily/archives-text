# Band to Play For Duck Game
## Trio of Baton Men Performs Tomorrow 
### 
The band, necessary adjunct of
every football game, will be on
hand Saturday.
This not-so-startling announce- j
ment came from Band Librarian Tex 1
Ferguson yesterday afternoon. And j
under the able hand of San Jose's [
Mr. Frank Elsass this group, one of
the Farm's prime musical organiza- j
tions, should really put forth.
The band this year is a combina
tion of veteran upperclassmen and
talented frosh and according to all
reports this mixture will prove to
be potent stuff. It should however
be emphasized that there are still
plenty of places open for any frosh
(or upperclassmen, for that matter)
who can hold a horn or saw a fiddle.
There will also be three drum
majors on the field. Dick Hartman is
head man in this department and
helping him will be Ted Eberle and
Henry Loo. This trio of stick-twirl
ers have all had plenty of experience
and should put on a good show.
About 50 men in all will play Sat
urday, though only two practice
sessions have thus far been held. Jay
Ford is the band's manager.
