Over 600 season tickets to the
Stanford Players productions had
been sold by Wednesday afternoon,
according to F. Cowles Strickland,
director of dramatics. Only 200 more
season tickets are available due to
the limited capacity of the Little
Theater.

The last word in Webster's New
International Dictionary is zythum.
It means "a kind of ancient malt
beverage."
