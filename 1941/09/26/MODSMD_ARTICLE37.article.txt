## Papooses Meet Tough Bakersfield J.C. Eleven Prior to Varsity Came 
### 
Tomorrow will fell—as Harry Shipkey sends his yearling gridders
against Bakcrsficld J.C. at 11 a.m. in Stanford Stadium —last season's eleven
wound up untied and undefeated.
With the completion of 21 days of practice as allowed by conference
ruling, Shipkey has lined up a team with good prospects two and three

deep at each position.
SPEEDY BACKFIELD
Four wing-footed backs, Bobby
Andrews at quarter, Dave Pate at
fullback, and Jim Petit and Fred
Parsons, halfbacks, will take up the
offensive maneuverings of the U T"
formation.
In the forward wall probable
starters are Dave Brown and Jack
Hoald, ends; Bill Young and Harvey
Bernhard, tackles; Bill Siguardson
and Andy Sogorka, guards, and Pete
Brown, center.
Slated to open at center was Jack
McCurdy, all-city man from Frank
lin High in Seattle, but the 200-
pound lineman is out with injuries.
BAKERSFIELD VETERANS
Up from the oil country come the
Jaysee lads, loaded with veterans,
stars, and an all-around offensive
attack, working off a Notre Dame
box system.
Chuck Wakefield, all-metropoli
tan sensation, holds down center, and
can open up holes in the defense
like a Mack truck going through
papier mache—he weighs a nifty
2!]o.
Flashiest back on the club is Bob
Herndon, triple-threat man, who
will be used on quick-opening plays
with Wakefield clearing the road.
1 he quick opener has been the big
gest gainer for the Oilers and will
probably be relied upon greatly to
morrow.
Nate Morrison and "Flash" Shel
hammer are also highly touted as
speedy ball packers in the Bakers
field backfield.
LAST SCRIMMAGE
Yesterday afternoon marked the
final scrimmage for the Papooses, and
the line latched on to their funda
mentals a little better than has been
the case.
The team looks good all-around.
Andrews passed beautifully yester
day, and Pettit and Parsons tore off
some nice gains. Pate will handle
kicking, along with Ross Dana, Neil
Sandcrman and Cannon Parkinson.
