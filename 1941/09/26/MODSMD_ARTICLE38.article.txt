# Coaches to Chart Game from Booth
## 
### 
If a cool wind whips through the
stadium in the second half of the
Duck-Indian contest tomorrow, the
contingent of assistant grid coaches
who man the charts in the press box
will be much better off than the
sports writers and privileged char
acters who partake of the free cokes
and sandwiches in the press box.
For the men from the coaching
staff will work in the privacy of the
booth that was formerly used by
the radio announcers, who are now
perched atop the press box roof.
