# Varsity Water Poloists Have Hot Prospects
## 
### 
With the football crying season
in full sway, most coaches would be
astounded, not to say surprised, to
hear Coach Norton Thornton talk
about his varsity water polo team.
"The best since 1936 and possibly
the best of all lime," flatly states
Mentor Thornton before his season
has even begun. And certainly a
list of his prospects gives weight to
his belief.
With a turnout of 35 men giving
him five full teams at the start,
Thornton has quality as well as
quantity with two or three experi
enced men.at every position.
Four men are waging a terrific
battle for the goalie post. Two of
last year's lettermen, Bob Breckner
and Ed Smith have been almost
pushed out of consideration by Bert
Singer, transfer from San Francisco
State, and Pete Lee, sophomore flash.
Playing for the Olympic Club be
fore entering Stanford, Singer was
known as one of the top goalies on
the Coast while Lee was a sensation
with the 1940 freshmen champions.
Guard positions are fairly well
sewed up by Captain Frank Mitch
ell, 1940 all-conference player, and
Jack Bleeker, a forward last year
rated as good as Mitchell.
At center back on the present first
string is Bob Hind, another out
standing sophomore. These three
will form one of the best backfields
in Farm history, according to Thorn
ton.
A wide open battle rages for the
important sprint job among Bob
Jones, Don Smith, and Bill Mapel.
Jones, big and fast center back from
last year, has been heavily pressed
in scrimmage by Don Smith, swim
ming team captain in his first year
of waterpolo. Smith is faster than
Jones but lacks his size. Mapel, a
transfer from U.C.LA., is also a top
cohtender.
One forward spot has been almost
cinched by Hadley Bacon although
wide open battle is in prospect for
the other. Fred Manwaring has
been scrimmaging with the first
string but Johnny Hauerwass, let
terman from last year, and Mapel,
who also can play this spot, have
been pressing him.
Sure to be a real contender is
Grant Culley, top scorer with last
year's freshmen, who has been both
ered by a case of poison oak, He
will start work Monday.
