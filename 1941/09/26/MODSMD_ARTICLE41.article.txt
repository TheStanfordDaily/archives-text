# Schroeder Leads Card's Net Drive
## 
### 
When play in the 1941 Pacific
Coast tennis championshoips at the
Berkeley Tennis Club gets under
way tomorrow, at least six Stanford
netsters will start the drive for the
crown, forming a contingent that
may send one of its members through
to the title that Bobby Riggs copped
last year.
Ted Schroeder, who was ineli
gible to compete for the Indians last
year, is probably rated the out
standing Stanford entrant, but there
are a number of other Cards who
have the stuff to come through if
Schroeder falters. They are Emery
Neal, Jack Gurley, and Larry Dee,
veterans of the Indian net team, and
Andy Roberts, Ted Meyers, and Bob
Rutledge. Meyers and Rutledge are
freshmen.
Play starts tomorrow and con
tinues through the week', with the
finals set for one week from Sunday.

HONOLULU, T.H., Sept. 25 (UP).
â€”Rents in Honolulu have been
raised as much as 100 per cent in
the defense boom, a Hawaii Senate
investigating committee was told
today.
