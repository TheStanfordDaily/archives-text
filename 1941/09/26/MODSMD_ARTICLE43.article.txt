# Nova Hopes to End Bomber's Record Reign Monday Night
## 
### 
Will Lou Nova's "cosmic" punch end fistiana's longest reign, Joe Louis
as heavyweight king?
When the Californian steps into the Polo Grounds ring Monday night
he will he the last "white hope" or any other hope, for tlial matter, to get
a chance at the champion for quite some time—for (lie Brown Bomber
will be in there punching for Uncles

Sam's army in a few weeks.
Louis is confident that he can
take care of Nova inside eight
rounds, but around punch row, the
boys have it that. Louis may weak
en, as evidenced when Billy Conn
pushed the champion 13 rounds to
lose by a photo.
LOUIS READY TO GO
Back at Greenwood Lake, N.Y.,
Louis is finishing up his training
repertoire, and seems ready to pol
ish off Nova easily.
When two sportswriters asked
Louis if he was getting ready for
an eight-round bout or the regular
15-round route, he was quoted as
replying:
"Eight rounds? Tha's an awful
long night's work, ain't it?"
BOMBER WON'T PREDICT
Louis apparently refuses, how
ever, to pick the exact round in
which he expects to knock out
Nova. For he was slightly off key
when he picked himself to KO Max
Schmeling in their first fight.
Ray Arcel, Nova's manager, goes
whole hog for his boy to take care
of Louis via a knockout. Nova has
had the experience, has the speed,
and the added "cosmic" punch,
which is supposed to make the De
troit Bomber see stars.
Doug Montell, veteran sportscaster,
will announce tomorrow's Oregon-
Stanford grid battle. In order to get
a better picture of the Indian foot
ballers, Montell took in yesterday's
practice session and found out who
was who.

an eight-round bout or the regular
15-round route, he was quoted as
replying:
"Eight rounds? Tha's an awful
long night's work, ain't it?"
BOMBER WON'T PREDICT
Louis apparently refuses, how
ever, to pick the exact round in
which he expects to knock out
Nova. For he was slightly off key
when he picked himself to KO Max
Schmeling in their first fight.
Ray Arcel, Nova's manager, goes
whole hog for his boy to take care
of Louis via a knockout. Nova has
had the experience, has the speed,
and the added "cosmic" punch,
which is supposed to make the De
troit Bomber see stars.
Doug Montell, veteran sportscaster,
will announce tomorrow's Oregon-
Stanford grid battle. In order to get
a better picture of the Indian foot
ballers, Montell took in yesterday's
practice session and found out who
was who.
