r "| I HE "we \vu7. robbed'' which the
late Joe Jacobs used to give out
with was just a gurgle compared to
the campus opinion last spring when
eight men, good and true, were dis
re-eligibilized by a one-time "Uncle
Sam's whiskers," as movie moider
ers called FBI men.
Ever since that memorable after
noon when Gene Coldiron walked
into Encina Hall wiih a broken step
and a tear in his eye to break the
news to the boys, whenever Stan
ford men have gathered there has
been a general maligning of Mr. Ed
win Atherton. He was most defi
nitely cast as the villain in the piece
grabbing the heroine (the boys)
((sorry fellas)) from the hero, Mr.
Shaughnessy, the man with the
cream colored convertible.
T<r this 1 object. My objection
has been sustained by the boss so
I continue. If some guy was to
swipe eight nice girl friends of
ycurs, only to replace them with
a Rita Hay worth and a Betty
Grable, would you look him in the
mouth like any old ordinary gift
horse? No.
Well, to Coach Clark, Loren La-
Prade and Willard Shelter look
like Hayworth and Grahle. A year
ago LaPrade was headed for the
wilds of University Avenue and
U.S.C. while Sheller had the illu
sion that a reasonable excuse for
an education could be obtained
across the bay.
They were slipped the cold her
ring by the same Atherton who has
figured further up in this treatise.
Now they cavort on the Farm. La
grade has "arrived" and is playing
right guard in a manner most charm
ing; Sheller is improving so fast that
you can see it with the naked eye.

j JJIGHT here there is needed a
bridge from football to track so

I'll mention that A. F. Thompson in
1824, while running in the low hur
dles in the Big 10-Pacific Coast Con
ference meet, conceived the idea of
running, kicking, and passing a bloat
ed pigskin to form a game. He
called it footbafl and it has caught
on quite well, especially with "homo
sapiens."
Now that I have spanned the
gap it will be perfectly permissible
to observe that Stanford's long
domination in the shot-put, even
while losing in the other events,
in their annual meet with the Tro
jans is about to collapse in "Pitch"
Johnson's lap.
Looking at the leftovers, a thing
I do so often, Carl Mcrritt, a 52-
footer, should be one of the best
in the country. Adding injury to
more injury—we haven't arrived
at the insult yet—"Moose" Thomp
son has transferred to Troy from
Modesto Jaysee and become eli
gible by the grace of god, or Ru
fus li., or somebody. He's good
too.
Here comes the injury. Earl
Audet, a mere slip of a lad at 265
pounds, has moved west from
Georgetown, where he put the shot
54 feet for the frosh. Although he
won't be eligible for a year, he pre
sents a vision for Stanfordites to
conjure with on nights when the
Ovaltine supply runs out.
