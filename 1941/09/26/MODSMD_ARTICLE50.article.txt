# Dodgers Cinch Crown With Wyatt's 5-Hitter
## 
### 
BOSTON, Sept. 25 (UP).—Sing it
from the housetops, shout it from
the storm cellars, tell everybody
from the fabulous land of Flatbush
to San Francisco's Gulden Gate and
from the rockbound coast of Maine
to the Rio Grande—"The Dodgers
are champions!"
The fantastic ball club that all
America -millionaires and paupers,
society hollos and housewives, ex

perts and thousands who never saw
a ball game—took unto its heart
captured its first National League
pennant in 21 years today by shel
lacking the Boston Braves. G-0, while
the St. Louis Cardinals were losing
to the Pirates in Pittsburgh.
Whitlow Wyatt, the tall, drawling
Georgian, pitched the pennant
clinching game, holding the Braves
virtually helpless before his baffling
sinker ball and his darting curve.
As Dixie Walker, his fellow Geor
gian, did yesterday, Wyatt tossed
his own birthday party by holding
the Braves to five hits, and hanging
up his seventh shutout and his 22nd
victory.
Wyatt was a trifle previous with
his celebration, as his birthday won't
arrive until Saturday when he'll be
33 years old. Wyatt's triumph tied
him with his teammate, Kirby Higbe,
for the lead among National League
pitchers for most victories.
Brooklyn's triumph climaxed one
of the bitterest season-long pennant
races in baseball annals. From the
first week of the season until the
mathematical clinching today, the
Dodgers and Cardinals were never
more than four games apart and
most of the time they were at each
other's throats. The Dodgers spent
75 days on top while the Cards en
joyed 70 days in first place.
