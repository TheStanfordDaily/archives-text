# Frye to Start With New Team
## 
### 
With a squad that is long on fight
but short on veterans, Coach Clay
ton Frye has already started pre
| paring for the 1942 boxing season.
Although there aren't any conference
J matches scheduled for this quarter,
i there may be some practice matches
[ with MofTett Field and the novice
boxing tournament may be held.
Many of last year's leather push
ers, including John Ward, Tom
"Mouse" Mac Michael, and Mel Ellet,
have either graduated or been caught
in the draft. However, Don Grant
and Bob McNeil look good in the
heavyweight division; Jim Thur
mond and Brownell Carr will handle
the 165-lb. class; Milt Vedder, Ira
Fishman, and A1 Smith return for
the 155-lb. group; Frank Hewitt and
Johnson Chinn are at 145 lbs.; and
Dick Lyon is a returning veteran in
the 135-lb. division.
According to Coach Frye there is
still plenty of time to sign up for the
squad this quarter. Workouts will
be held in the gym. Here's a tip. As
to the coming Louis-Nova fight,
Coach Frye says, "I'll take Louis,
cosmic punch or not."
