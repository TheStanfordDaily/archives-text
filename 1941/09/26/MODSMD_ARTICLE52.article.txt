# 45 Splash Men Start Practice
## 
### 
Featured by the appearance of
j: seven younger brothers of former
I Stanford players, freshman water
polo practice opened this week with
' the largest turnout in history, ac
cording to Coach Norton Thornton.
Eight of the first year men have
! had a certain amount of experience,
' although there are many other good
j prospects from whom Thornton can
choose his team.
One of the top freshmen is Alan
Weeden, brother of Bill Weeden,
j star of the IE4I squad. Brother Alan
j is a star in his own right, already
holding the Pacific Coast backstroke
| championship.
Dick Narver, brother of the 1940
senior manager; Pete Hatch, brother
of Bill Hatch; and Tom Murietta,
brother of Jack Murietta, former
standout polo player and freshman
coach, are other younger brothers
trying out for the team.
Three boys have brothers on the
present varsity team, including Phil
Lee, brother of the outstanding
sophomore goalie, Pete Lee; Bud
Carpenter, brother of sophomore
Jack Carpenter; and Johnny Mapel,
brother of varsity sprint man Bill
Mapel.
With practice still mainly on fun
damentals there has been little op
portunity to place men at positions,
although Henry Saltonstall and Sil
Onesti have shown up well thus far.
