### DON SELBY 
THE 194.1 model of the Big Red Machine, stressing speed and deception,
goes on show against Oregon U. tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock
in the huge Stanford Stadium. And i! you don't see another "Vv'ow Boy"
outfit that lays 'em in the aisles, we'll be way out that well-known limb
which is ready to break any minute.
There's no fooling about it: Farm people are just itching to see that
outfit roll. The old football fever lias hit Stanford, and in no uncer
tain manner.
With a line that includes five gridders that worked through to a Pacific
Coast Conference title and the Hose Bowl crown last year, and a backfield
that still has ihe passing, the kicking, the deception, and the play-calling
hat were such important factors in the Indians' success last fall, there is
every reason that Stanford should come out on top tomorrow.
1' urthcrmore, (he miracle man of football. Coach Clark Daniel
Shaughnessy, is still around to lend a hand whenever needed. Be
tween the team and the coach, things should be rosy for the rooters
of the Cardinal about 5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
A bit of a surprise and yet no surprise at -all is the naming by Shaugh
ncssy of Loren LaPrade, 200-pound sophomore, to start at right guard in
lront of two good boys, Jack Francis and Ed McCain. It's a surprise be
cause the other boys have the experience, but, on the other hand, anyone
who saw LaPrade in action as a lrosh last fall knew that it wouldn't take
; that boy long to move into the front ranks on anybody's outfit.
* * * *
j iiAIRING up with LaPrade at guard will be Charles A. "Pinky" Taylor,
; prominently mentioned.on several all-Coast elevens last year and prob
; ably the outstanding guard on the Pacific slope this year. Taylor has been
! bothered with a cold this week and spent yesterday afternoon in the rest
I home to be sure of having the bug licked by game time tomorrow. But
cold or no cold, you can count on the burly lad from San Jose to come
through with a great game. We're remembering those three great stops
! he made in the Washington debacle last fall, and if the Oregon quarter
| back remembers, he'll probably steer clear of Taylor's position as much as
possible.
Completing a center trio that has plenty to offer is Vic Lindskog, a
good blocker and a great line-backer. Because of the T, Vic hasn't a
great deal to worry about in the snapper-back department, hut he
has plenty to do on offense, nevertheless, for blocking is what makes
the wheels go 'round in any type of offense.
All hough there may be a lack of really capable reserves at the tackle
spots, Bruno Banducci and Ed Stamm are a pair of boys who will make
| the going extremely tough for any attack, including Oregon's. Banducci
: doesn't seem to be troubled any longer by the shoulder injury that kept
him out of a suit a couple of days last week and which requires him to
1 wear an arm band to keep the injured member in position. For smart,
heads-up line play, keep your eye on that Banducci. And that Stamm can
play on my ball club, too.
If we thought it would help, we'd herein include a prayer that
Hank Norberg, a "dream end" if we ever saw one. stays in one piece
throughout the season. Ilank won't be starting the game tomorrow,
according to Coach Shaughncssy, but you can bet your boots that the
big junior from Palo Alto will get in more than a little playing time.
And barring broken bones, which have plagued him ever since he
started playing prep school ball, he should turn in an outsanding per
formance. We've been waiting a long time to see that fella play long
enough to show bis stuff; perhaps tomorrow will be the pay-oIT.
He's big, he's fast, he can block, he's very good on defense, and he's
! one of the best pass catchers on the outfit. Add that up, and if it doesn't
j make a "dream end," we apologize.
* if * ♦
ends will be Arnie Meiners and Freddie Meyer, a pair of
seniors. Meiners, a rugged, hard-working but not flashy flankman, is
i scheduled to see duty at both end spots, for they need him to take over
the right wing berth when Meyer needs a rest, which is further indication
that Norberg will play a lot of ball. Need we say anything about Meyer,
who was tops on the Coast last year and should be better this year? He's
a real end, that guy is.
There's your line—seven (eight counting Norberg) men who know
what the game is all about, who play hard—men who certainly should
be able to clear the way for a backfield that gets through a hole be
fore it scarcely opens.
Frankie Albert was pitching passes in yesterday's workout that gave
ample evidence that if the Duck secondary moves up to stop Pete Kmct-
I ovic—game captain tomorrow —a well-conceived, well-executed aerial at
, tack that wasn't stopped all last fall will go into action. Gosh, that boy
can throw a football. He did it last year in marvelous style and his pitch
ing yesterday was better than ever. With receivers like Meyer, Norberg,
j and Kmetovic, Albert could easily drive the Webfoots goofy.
For tricky running, Kmetovic is as good if not better than any Stan
ford has ever had, including Tricky Dick Hyland or any of the others.
A change of pace, a here-it-is-now-it-ain't leg movement make "Perfect
Pete" the boy to watch every time he gets his hands on the ball.
Naturally, the big question mark in the backfield concerns the two

; newcomers to the starting quartet, -4
Milt Vucinich and Eric Armstrong.
Vos has the power, and if he didn't
have to be compared to the great
; Norm Standlee he'd now be hailed
as a major threat himself. He's not
I too speedy, but he's far from a slow
i poke. He came through with flying
I colors when he subbed for Tho
Chief in the Washington game in
'40. and he has a fighting spirit that
| mskes him go his best when ihe
I chips are down. He'll do oaky.
Luckic Louie just dropped in to
| say: Stanford over Oregon.
