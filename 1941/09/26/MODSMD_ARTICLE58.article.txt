# Knifed in the Back

### 
F'RANKIE Albert has been sold down the river.
He has been sold outright by a former
Stanford man for a fat check from the Saturday-
Evening Post.
In the current issue of the Post appears an
article labeled "He Clowns to Touchdowns."
Last night Frankie was asked for his reaction to
this story. He replied, "How would anybody
feel after an article like that? I didn't think the
Post would run such an article."
Frankie is quoted extensively by the writer
of this story. Here is an example, describing
an after-game occurrence:
"One of the mob to fall on our hero (Albert)
was a gal who threw soft arms around him and
screamed: 'Oh, Frankie, you were wonderful.'
Frankie grinned and gently guided her aside
from the mob. He said: 'Do that again, beauti
ful, and I'll get the gang and play the game
over again.' Frankie was interviewed a few
days later by a gushing feminine reporter. She
asked what Frankie ate. The left-handed trou
badour didn't even crack a smile as he told her:
'I love raw eggs. I eat raw meat. And I throw
out my chest like this and then I'm plain dyna
mite.' "
It is our conviction that this quotation is based
on hearsay and idle rumor. It makes Frankie
and the Stanford Man in the eyes of the nation
a cocky, egotistical puppy. Those of us who
know Frankie know that this is far from the
truth, feel certain that glory has never gone to
his head.
Frankie told us last night that the writer never
interviewed him for this article previous to
writing it, never asked him one question in
preparing the story. Frankie added that he
never gave the man a quote.
The author of the piece is a former Stanford
man who is employed as a sports writer by a
San Francisco newspaper. His name is Emer
son L. "Bud" Spencer, and he left the Farm in
'28 before receiving his A.B. When at Stanford
he ran the 440 in an effort to bring honor to the
Stanford Red. His latest effort has flopped mis
erably. More than that, it has sabotaged the
Stanford Red.
It is difficult for a college journalist to at
tempt to criticize a compatriot working on a
metropolitan daily. We honestly feel that the
story is well written, but its tone and obvious
lack of accurate; quotes portray Albert as an
Ail-American chump. Such a yarn shatters
public confidence in and respect for the press.
The campus is almost universal in its derision
of the article, and many have read it with as
tonishment and disgust.
"I guess it's too late to do anything now,"
Frankie told us last night.
We believe and hope Frank is wrong. When
a rftan is knifed in the back it is never too late
for his friends and admirers to defend his char
acter. The friends and admirers of Frank Albert
will do so by addressing Mr. Wesley Winans
Stout, Editor, The Saturday Evening Post, Inde
pendence Square, Philadelphia, Pa.
We know of one such letter which leaves by
plane for the East this morning.—H. S.

mite.' "
It is our conviction that this quotation is based
on hearsay and idle rumor. It makes Frankie
and the Stanford Man in the eyes of the nation
a cocky, egotistical puppy. Those of us who
know Frankie know that this is far from the
truth, feel certain that glory has never gone to
his head.
Frankie told us last night that the writer never
interviewed him for this article previous to
writing it, never asked him one question in
preparing the story. Frankie added that he
never gave the man a quote.
The author of the piece is a former Stanford
man who is employed as a sports writer by a
San Francisco newspaper. His name is Emer
son L. "Bud" Spencer, and he left the Farm in
'28 before receiving his A.B. When at Stanford
he ran the 440 in an effort to bring honor to the
Stanford Red. His latest effort has flopped mis
erably. More than that, it has sabotaged the
Stanford Red.
It is difficult for a college journalist to at
tempt to criticize a compatriot working on a
metropolitan daily. We honestly feel that the
story is well written, but its tone and obvious
lack of accurate; quotes portray Albert as an
Ail-American chump. Such a yarn shatters
public confidence in and respect for the press.
The campus is almost universal in its derision
of the article, and many have read it with as
tonishment and disgust.
"I guess it's too late to do anything now,"
Frankie told us last night.
We believe and hope Frank is wrong. When
a rftan is knifed in the back it is never too late
for his friends and admirers to defend his char
acter. The friends and admirers of Frank Albert
will do so by addressing Mr. Wesley Winans
Stout, Editor, The Saturday Evening Post, Inde
pendence Square, Philadelphia, Pa.
We know of one such letter which leaves by
plane for the East this morning.—H. S.
F'RANKIE Albert has been sold down the river.
He has been sold outright by a former
Stanford man for a fat check from the Saturday-
Evening Post.
In the current issue of the Post appears an
article labeled "He Clowns to Touchdowns."
Last night Frankie was asked for his reaction to
this story. He replied, "How would anybody
feel after an article like that? I didn't think the
Post would run such an article."
Frankie is quoted extensively by the writer
of this story. Here is an example, describing
an after-game occurrence:
"One of the mob to fall on our hero (Albert)
was a gal who threw soft arms around him and
screamed: 'Oh, Frankie, you were wonderful.'
Frankie grinned and gently guided her aside
from the mob. He said: 'Do that again, beauti
ful, and I'll get the gang and play the game
over again.' Frankie was interviewed a few
days later by a gushing feminine reporter. She
asked what Frankie ate. The left-handed trou
badour didn't even crack a smile as he told her:
'I love raw eggs. I eat raw meat. And I throw
out my chest like this and then I'm plain dyna
mite.' "
