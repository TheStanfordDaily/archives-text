# Hollywood Grievance
## 
### 
EVERY year Hollywood grinds oul another
batch of low-grade movies with a college
setting, usually second-rate "B" pictures to fill
out the inevitable double bill.
And every year millions of misguided people
who know little or nothing about colleges or
college life, through the evils of the double bill
system, have to sit through these cheaply pro
duced untruthful portrayals of life on some
mythical campus, supposedly typical of the
American college.
We must, however, give Hollywood credit
for thinking that the life of university students
furnishes good material for the celluloids. But
that is about as far as the credit should go. The
producers and writers completely overlook all
the plot, situation, and character posibilities
abundant on any university campus. They

overlook these in favor of sickly-sweet mush
no more typical ol college lite than is life in a
cheap night club.
And the public is expected to believe that
these anachronistic jazz-age depictions show
how we live and think today.
We in college know that if someone acci
dentally touched a match to the miles of cellu
loid strips of college movies nothing would be
lost—except possibly a few dollars from the
movie magnates' pockets.
Seemingly nothing can be done about the
situation.
We suppose the gullible public will for years
watch some aging Don Ameche trying to look
young and romantic again. With him will be
some makeup-masked young starlet who can't
act, who never saw a college classroom, but
who probably won a beauty contest somewhere.
They'll be romancing on the steps of some
studio sorority house.
No one in the cast of Orson Welles' "Citizen
Kane" had ever been in a movie before. But
they could act. And "Citizen Kane" is still
breaking box office records the country over.
We would like to offer the following sugges
tion in an attempt to remedy this unhealthy
college movie situation. It probably Would be
immediately rejected by the moguls whose
super-caution usually snuffs out any modern,
experimental ideas slightly different from their
overworn, tried-and true methods. "It wouldn't
be good box-office," they say.
We would like to see Hollywood send a
couple of college writers around to several
different universities—not all in Southern Cali
fornia —to live for a while, to absorb some of
the individual atmosphere and customs of each
campus, to learn what the students are thinking.
Bring them back to Hollywood and let them
write a show, using the advice of professional
scenarists on technical matters only. Then cast
the show with college actors who have proved
themselves in shows at their own schools, but
who are untainted by the stilted traditions of
Hollywood—for instance a group such as the
Stanford actors who presented a new play each
week at Tahoe City this summer.
We have a hunch they could turn out a first
rate movie which would accomplish its three
purposes: to partially right the wrongs done the
colleges in the public mind by past movies, to
provide top-notch entertainment, and, of course,
to gross well at the box offices.
