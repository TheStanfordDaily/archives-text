# 'Come Early To Grid Game'
## 
### 
With the plea to "please come early
so you'll get a good seat" Rally
Committee Chairmen Pi Thornton
and Micky Levee yesterday issued
a series of suggestions designed to
fill tomorrow's rooting section with
a minimum of confusion.
First, students are asked to have
their student body cards ready when
they reach Gate G so that the ticket
officials can get them through the
gates as quickly as possible. Those
wishing to sit together must come in
together, since Rally Committee
members have been instructed not
to allow tiny seat-saving. The higher
bleachers will be filled first.
Once in the section, rooters must
take the seat assigned them, and no
one will be permitted to block the
aisles while waiting for better
seats.
Co-chairman Pi Thornton again
stressed that all women must wear
white shirts and carry pompons, and
added that coat sweaters are much
more satisfactory since pullovers are
too much trouble to take off.
The usual white shirts and root
er's caps will be worn by all men.
Men will wear their rooters' caps
according to the colored line on their
seats, thus forming a Block S.
