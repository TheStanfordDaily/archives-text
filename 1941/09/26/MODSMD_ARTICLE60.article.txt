### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
ALL ABOUT NOTIIIN(;
I CAN'T help getting excited over the football game
tomorrow. For tomorrow Stanford meets the Uni
versity of Oregon, and we'll all be back in the stands
with our red and white hats, watching the girls file
down to their seats, rolling people down the section,
giving yells that aren't in the Frosh handbook and
heckling the referees. Also we are going to see, in
person, one of the finest football machines in the
game.
Many stories have been written, analyzing the
chances the Indians have of duplicating their surpris
ing season of last year, and landing in the Rose Bowl
again. Myself, 1 think that the Indians are going to
do just that.
The one outstanding weakness the Indians seem to
have right now is their pass defense. Looking at our
backs, Albert, Kmetovic, Armstrong, Ditlevsen, Vuci
nich ,Cole and Crane, you dan see that all are extremely
small.
The team that scares me the most is Santa Clara.
Ml * *1 *
I WOULD at this time like to nominate Mitch Shadid,
guard on the Oklahoma football team, as having the
meanest face in football. Anyone that would like to
dispute my selection should first take a look at his pic
ture in the current football annual.
* * af- *
'J'UIE things that I have disliked most at Stanford
football games 'nave been the yell leaders. They
always seemed to be behind the section, in giving the
yells. Last night at the rally, Joe Messina and his
assistants took over, and it looks like we're going to
have snappy, organized, timely yells. And I think that
Joe and his boys can get the names of the players
right when they come off the field. None of the old,
"All right gang, the name, Frank Kmetovic."
* # !|l *
| ADIES and Gentlemen. For the biggest upset in the
game today, keep your eyes on Seattle, Washing
ton, for there tomorrow Jimmy Phelan's Washington
Huskies are going to whip Minnesota, the nation's
popular favorite.
sit * $ *
I SUPPOSE that we have an alert Rally Committee
and that one of these days, for a card trick, we will
be asked to form a "V" and holler "It's for victory."
I can see all the fans cheering warmly, and can hear
Doug Montell saying over the mike, "Isn't that a fine
gesture, folks?"

I WOULD at this time like to nominate Mitch Shadid,
guard on the Oklahoma football team, as having the
meanest face in football. Anyone that would like to
dispute my selection should first take a look at his pic
ture in the current football annual.

'J'UIE things that I have disliked most at Stanford
football games 'nave been the yell leaders. They
always seemed to be behind the section, in giving the
yells. Last night at the rally, Joe Messina and his
assistants took over, and it looks like we're going to
have snappy, organized, timely yells. And I think that
Joe and his boys can get the names of the players
right when they come off the field. None of the old,
"All right gang, the name, Frank Kmetovic."

| ADIES and Gentlemen. For the biggest upset in the
game today, keep your eyes on Seattle, Washing
ton, for there tomorrow Jimmy Phelan's Washington
Huskies are going to whip Minnesota, the nation's
popular favorite.

I SUPPOSE that we have an alert Rally Committee
and that one of these days, for a card trick, we will
be asked to form a "V" and holler "It's for victory."
I can see all the fans cheering warmly, and can hear
Doug Montell saying over the mike, "Isn't that a fine
gesture, folks?"
ALL ABOUT NOTIIIN(;
I CAN'T help getting excited over the football game
tomorrow. For tomorrow Stanford meets the Uni
versity of Oregon, and we'll all be back in the stands
with our red and white hats, watching the girls file
down to their seats, rolling people down the section,
giving yells that aren't in the Frosh handbook and
heckling the referees. Also we are going to see, in
person, one of the finest football machines in the
game.
Many stories have been written, analyzing the
chances the Indians have of duplicating their surpris
ing season of last year, and landing in the Rose Bowl
again. Myself, 1 think that the Indians are going to
do just that.
The one outstanding weakness the Indians seem to
have right now is their pass defense. Looking at our
backs, Albert, Kmetovic, Armstrong, Ditlevsen, Vuci
nich ,Cole and Crane, you dan see that all are extremely
small.
The team that scares me the most is Santa Clara.
