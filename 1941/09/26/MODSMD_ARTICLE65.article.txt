Leaving by clipper for Hawaii
Sept. 2. Dr. Chilton R. Bush, head
of the journalism department, spent
three weeks in the Islands acting as
consultant on marketing for one of
the Hawaiian corporations. He re
turned by ship on Wednesday.
In speaking of the upset condi
tions in the Islands brought about
by the influx of service men, Dr.
Bush mentioned the traffic and rent
al problems facing Honolulu. The
city is having difficulty in recruit
ing police or in finding workers to
haul away trash, since government -
established salaries for such labor
cannot meet defense wages.
And rental prices, taking advan
tage of the unusual number of serv
ice families in the Islands, are soar
ing to such a point that the legisla
ture is considering a rent-control
bill this week.
