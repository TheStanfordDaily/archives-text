"A coach's family goes through
twice as much mental anguish as the
coach himself during football sea
l son."
The author of this opinion ought
to know for she is the daughter of
the nation's top football coach. Tall,
dramatic Marcia Shaughnessy at
tended her first classes at Stanford
Wednesday.
"Mother and I gel so scared before
the games that we just sit around
and pray. Sometimes mother goes
off into seclusion. Poor mother, she
nearly goes crazy with a coach for
a husband and an actress for a
daughter."
A transfer from Stephens College
in Columbia, Mo., Marcia studied
dramatics wilh Miss Maude Adams,
veteran Broadway actress. She
played leading roles in most of the
Stephens College productions.
"Besides that my brother plays
the piano and my sister experiments
with dancing. But all of us have
something in common because we're
trying to please the public."
Marcia's brother, Clark, is a senior
I at U.C.L.A., where he played foot
ball during his freshman year. He
quit the gridiron due to an injury,
Janice, the youngest member of the
Shaughnessy family, is a student at
Mills. She hopes to transfer to Stan
ford next year.
"We've all been raised on foot
ball," Marcia said. "I saw my first
game when I was eight months old
and I've been following dad's teams |
ever since.
"Chicago University was awful.
I The team didn't have anything and j
J they always knew they were going
I to get licked. I admire the way the
I boys took their beatings but they |
didn't have a chance."


MARCIA SIIAUGIINKSSY
In 1940 Coach Shaughnessy of
Chicago University was offered the
iVad coaching position for the Stan
lord Indians. At that time the Stan
ford team looked a far shot from
iiosebowl material.
"But dad was thrilled with the op
portunity. He knew that Stanford
men have above average brains. And
it takes plenty of brains to figure
out all the plays in the T formation."
While her father startled the na
tion with victory after victory last
fall, Marcia followed the news of his
i< cord from a little town in the mid
dle of Missouri.
"I used to comb the town of Co
lumbia looking for the scores after
every game. But some of my friends
always found out first."
At Stanford Marcia has watched
nearly all of the pre-season prac
tices.
"Dad told me to hide whenever I
came over to the football field, so I
watch from behind the fence. The
practices are really supposed to be
closed so the boys can concentrate."
Marcia has a theory that she is a
jinx at her father's football games.
She watched practically all of the
Chicago games, but was not in the

, grandstands for any of the success
ful Stanford games last year.
"When Stanford started out so
badly at the Rose Bowl I almost
walked out," Marcia said. "It seems
j I always bring bad luck to dad's
games."

In 1940 Coach Shaughnessy of
Chicago University was offered the
iVad coaching position for the Stan
lord Indians. At that time the Stan
ford team looked a far shot from
iiosebowl material.
"But dad was thrilled with the op
portunity. He knew that Stanford
men have above average brains. And
it takes plenty of brains to figure
out all the plays in the T formation."
While her father startled the na

fall, Marcia followed the news of his
i< cord from a little town in the mid

"I used to comb the town of Co

every game. But some of my friends
always found out first."
At Stanford Marcia has watched
nearly all of the pre-season prac

"Dad told me to hide whenever I
came over to the football field, so I
watch from behind the fence. The
practices are really supposed to be
closed so the boys can concentrate."
Marcia has a theory that she is a
jinx at her father's football games.
She watched practically all of the
Chicago games, but was not in the

, grandstands for any of the success
ful Stanford games last year.
"When Stanford started out so
badly at the Rose Bowl I almost
walked out," Marcia said. "It seems
j I always bring bad luck to dad's
games."
"A coach's family goes through
twice as much mental anguish as the

A transfer from Stephens College
in Columbia, Mo., Marcia studied
dramatics wilh Miss Maude Adams,
veteran Broadway actress. She
played leading roles in most of the
