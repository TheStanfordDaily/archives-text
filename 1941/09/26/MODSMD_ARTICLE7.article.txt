twice as much mental anguish as the
coach himself during football sea
l son."
The author of this opinion ought
to know for she is the daughter of
the nation's top football coach. Tall,
dramatic Marcia Shaughnessy at
tended her first classes at Stanford
Wednesday.
"Mother and I gel so scared before
the games that we just sit around
and pray. Sometimes mother goes
off into seclusion. Poor mother, she
nearly goes crazy with a coach for
a husband and an actress for a
daughter."
A transfer from Stephens College
in Columbia, Mo., Marcia studied
dramatics wilh Miss Maude Adams,
veteran Broadway actress. She
played leading roles in most of the
Stephens College productions.
"Besides that my brother plays
the piano and my sister experiments
with dancing. But all of us have
something in common because we're
trying to please the public."
Marcia's brother, Clark, is a senior

ball during his freshman year. He

"We've all been raised on foot
ball," Marcia said. "I saw my first
game when I was eight months old
and I've been following dad's teams |
ever since.
"Chicago University was awful.
I The team didn't have anything and j
J they always knew they were going
I to get licked. I admire the way the
I boys took their beatings but they |
didn't have a chance."
