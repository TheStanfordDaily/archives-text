# Pi Phis' Nocturnal Serenity Upset by Midnight Prowler
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Four engagements in three days should be enough for any sorority,
but when you throw in a midnight burglar to cap the climax, you have
a wonderful beginning for the new school year. And that is just what
happened to the Pi Beta Phi house Wednesday night.
Fortunately, their nocturnal visitor, a soldier on leave from San Luis

Obispo, was apprehended the
morning (proving once and for all j
that crime does not pay) but the ■
Pi Phi's were given a night they will
not soon forget.
THE BEGINNING
It all started with a late bull ses
sion on the third floor between
Ginny Reagan and Annie Gallery
about two o'clock in the morning.
Hearing a strange noise — strange
even for a sorority house, they threw
open their door to investigate.
There stood the modern version
of the barefoot boy, slightly built,
dark-haired, tastefully dressed in
Kreen slacks with a blue tweed
sport coat (no, it wasn't a Cal man)
and barefooted.
Slamming the door shut, they
rushed downstairs to Virginia Dean,
house president, for advice. They
returned to find their visitor gone,
but a pair of shoes and bright green
socks with a laundry mark directly
in front of their door.
Flip Price had now awakened and

rushed to the phone to call the local
gendarmes. With characteristic
aplomb, she called the police, say
ing, according to usually reliable
sources, "This is Harriet Price of
the Pi Beta Phi house, corner of
Mayfield and Santa Ynez of! Lasuen.
Park your car on the corner and
walk up because the road is closed.
Oh, yes, we have a burglar in the
house."
CONFUSION
Phyllis Swing rushed out yelling,
"Whee, another engagement," other
scantily dressed sisters tore madly
back and forth, while sophomores
Nan Whedon, Harriet Driscoll, and
Virginia Stammer, demonstrating
tremendous confidence in their big
sisters, continued to sleep soundly.
By now, the police arrived and
were getting the situation in hand.
The intruder had definitely fled,
leaving a large hand print on the
wall and footprints all over the im
maculate carpets.
POLICE TAKE OVER
To make sure the danger was over,
they searched every room, and Pi
Phi's awoke to find a strange man
with a flashlight in their rooms. Ad
mirable calm was shown by Lor
raine Rude, who, confronted by a
policeman's flashlight, asked what
had happened. Breathlessly, the po
liceman explained. "Oh!"' said Lor
raine, gently closed the door and
went back to bed.
After looking under every bed
and in every closet, the law went
outside to stand guard until 7
o'clock. Leaving at that hour, they
found as they started the motor that,
the siren had not been turned off.
The resulting noise just about ruined
the already damaged Pi Phi nerves.
The Pi Phi's now want everyone
to know that they want to be hos
pitable but there is a time and place
for everything. As Pcygy Perring
summed it up, "We don't mind do
ing our bit for the U. 5.0., but we
have to draw the line somewhere."
