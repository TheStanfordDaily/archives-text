r JpHE Battle of Russia is 14 weeks
old now aiTd it is still going
strong. If one were to accept the
Nazi figures, the Red Army is by
this time pushing up poppies —or
whatever the Russian equivalent of
poppies is.
On the other hand, the Rus
sians have been equally guilty of
exaggerations in their communi
ques, and in all probability, the
truth lies somewhere in the
middle.
This much is certain the Nazis are
not just indulging in a little extra
target practice. They are still taking
it as well as dishing it out.

A FTER adding the German and
Russian reports and dividing by
two, the present situation looks
something like this:
The Red armies in the Northern
and Central sectors continue to stab
back at their invaders in a series of
counter-attacks, the strength of
which can not yet be determined.
The Nazis are still poised at the
gates of Leningrad and resistance
there shows signs of gaining
strength. This is probably only a
minor and fleeting reversal, how
ever.
In the South the Germans con
tinue to bluster about their great
victory in Kiev and the number of
Russians they claim to have trapped
there grows larger and larger with
each report.
The Nazis talk aboyt "new deci
sive operations." This isn't very
mysterious. Best guess is that they
are getting set for a thrust at the
Caucasus with two spearheads. One
will probably be aimed at Kharkov
and the Donetz basin, the other at
the Crimean peninsula, site of the
great naval base of Sevastopol.
* # *
A LREADY the Nazis have cut off
Crimea from the mainland by
their southeastern drive last week
along the coast of the Sea of Azov.
Russian resistance in this region is
pretty feeble.
By and large, the situation is a
grave one. In a country the size of
Russia with a population as large
as hers, the amount of land lost
thus far, the number of casualties
inflicted though it be high, are not
the most serious considerations.
Kusisan munitions production is
the key factor.
Information on the size and loca
tion of the Soviet industrial centers
is at best rather fuzzy. One hears
talk about a vast network of facto
ries and munitions arsenals in the
Ural mountains.

to Walter Duranty,
these supplies do exist, and are
in fact so vast as to be able to sus
tain the Red Army through the com
ing year should it be forced to re
treat that far.
On the other hand, the fact
must not be lost sight of that the
industrial region of Kiev (accord
ing to another report, one of Rus
sia's five largest) is now lost to
the Germans. Furthermore, they
are dangerously threatening Khar
kov, another one of the big five.
The other three chief industrial
regions which constitute the arsenal
of the Red Army are Sverdlosk in
the Urals, Tomsk, Novosibirsk in
Siberia, and Moscow.

r PHERE are of course other indus
trial, mining, and oil production
scattered over the USSR, but ac
cording to one report, anyway, these
are the mainstays of Soviet produc

Some of these other centers have
already fallen. Krivoi Rog and
Nikopol are two. According to Time,
these cities were formerly respon
sible for 60 per cent of Soviet iron
and 45 per cent of her manganese.
And besieged Leningrad, Time says,
is the source of 49 per cent of Rus
sian tire production.
These figures would seem to

production remains a big fat ques

On the other hand, the Rus
sians have been equally guilty of
exaggerations in their communi
ques, and in all probability, the
truth lies somewhere in the
middle.
This much is certain the Nazis are
not just indulging in a little extra
target practice. They are still taking
it as well as dishing it out.

A FTER adding the German and
Russian reports and dividing by
two, the present situation looks
something like this:
The Red armies in the Northern
and Central sectors continue to stab
back at their invaders in a series of
counter-attacks, the strength of
which can not yet be determined.
The Nazis are still poised at the
gates of Leningrad and resistance
there shows signs of gaining
strength. This is probably only a
minor and fleeting reversal, how
ever.
In the South the Germans con
tinue to bluster about their great
victory in Kiev and the number of
Russians they claim to have trapped
there grows larger and larger with
each report.
The Nazis talk aboyt "new deci
sive operations." This isn't very
mysterious. Best guess is that they
are getting set for a thrust at the
Caucasus with two spearheads. One
will probably be aimed at Kharkov
and the Donetz basin, the other at
the Crimean peninsula, site of the
great naval base of Sevastopol.

A LREADY the Nazis have cut off
Crimea from the mainland by
their southeastern drive last week
along the coast of the Sea of Azov.
Russian resistance in this region is
pretty feeble.
By and large, the situation is a
grave one. In a country the size of
Russia with a population as large
as hers, the amount of land lost
thus far, the number of casualties
inflicted though it be high, are not
the most serious considerations.
Kusisan munitions production is
the key factor.
Information on the size and loca
tion of the Soviet industrial centers
is at best rather fuzzy. One hears
talk about a vast network of facto
ries and munitions arsenals in the
Ural mountains.

to Walter Duranty,
these supplies do exist, and are
in fact so vast as to be able to sus
tain the Red Army through the com
ing year should it be forced to re
treat that far.
On the other hand, the fact
must not be lost sight of that the
industrial region of Kiev (accord
ing to another report, one of Rus
sia's five largest) is now lost to
the Germans. Furthermore, they
are dangerously threatening Khar
kov, another one of the big five.
The other three chief industrial
regions which constitute the arsenal
of the Red Army are Sverdlosk in
the Urals, Tomsk, Novosibirsk in
Siberia, and Moscow.

r PHERE are of course other indus
trial, mining, and oil production
scattered over the USSR, but ac
cording to one report, anyway, these
are the mainstays of Soviet produc
tion.
Some of these other centers have
already fallen. Krivoi Rog and
Nikopol are two. According to Time,
these cities were formerly respon
sible for 60 per cent of Soviet iron
and 45 per cent of her manganese.
And besieged Leningrad, Time says,
is the source of 49 per cent of Rus
sian tire production.
These figures would seem to
contradict both of the reports de
scribed above. Russian munitions
production remains a big fat ques
tion mark. And we are not one
of the Quiz Kids.
One thing we do know. If Hitler
gets the Caucasus, all outside aid to
Russia through the Middle East and
the Caucasus will be cut off. This
is the quickest route for Britain and
the U.S.
r JpHE Battle of Russia is 14 weeks
old now aiTd it is still going
strong. If one were to accept the
Nazi figures, the Red Army is by
this time pushing up poppies —or
whatever the Russian equivalent of
poppies is.

sians have been equally guilty of
exaggerations in their communi
ques, and in all probability, the
