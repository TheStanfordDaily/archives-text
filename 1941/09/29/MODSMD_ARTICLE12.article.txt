# Daily to Hold Tryouts Oct. 1
## 
### 
"Come one, come all" is the word
I (or words) around the Daily office
these days.
The reason, of course, is that the
peninsula's only morning daily
newspaper will hold its first try
outee meeting in Room 8 of the Press
Building at 4:45 o'clock Wednesday
afternoon. No experience is required
to come out for The Daily, accord
ing to Editor Charles Bull, who at
this first get-together will speak to
the group of journalistic neophytes.
Students for whom the time is in
convenient should contact Rose
marie Mullany, the women's editor,
either at The Daily or at Palo Alto
1 23972 and make special arrange
i ments for tryouts.
