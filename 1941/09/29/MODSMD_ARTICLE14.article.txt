BERLIN, Sept. 28 (UP).â€”German
bombers are smashing at industries
and communications lines of Khar
kov and Moscow, preparing the way
for "new decisive operations" which
will result from the crushing defeat
of the Russians east of Kiev, Nazi
sources said today.
The high command said that
transport and railway works areas
of both Kharkov and Moscow, as
well as the Seliger Lake district,
source of the Volga River, were
blasted by German bombs and that
in the waters off the Kronstadt
naval base, a Soviet cruiser was set
afire by German artillery and a
Soviet battleship hit by aerial bombs.
Tlie "new operations" were fore
cast by newspapers commenting on
the "victory of the Kiev encircle
ment" with the capture of 665,000
Russians, and total Russian casual
ties of probably 1.300,000 men. It
was believed that the next "opera
tions" would include a main thrust
at Kharkov and the industrialized
Donetz Basin beyond, and already
the Nazi war machine was said to
be rolling across the eastern Ukraine
on the "great march to new vic
tories."
No doubt was left from front dis
patches that fierce fighting raged in
virtually all sectors from Finland to
the Black Sea.
