# R.A.F. VISITS ITALY VIA SWITZERLAND
## 
### 
GENEVA, Mon., Sept. 29 (UP).â€”
Swiss anti-aircraft batteries fired on
planes flying over Geneva last night
and early today. The roar of planes,
headed southeast, was heard at mid
night and it was still going on at
12:45 a.m., when an air alarm was
sounded.
(The passage of over
Switzerland usually has meant a
Royal Air Force raid on northern
Italy, with the raiders heading over
France and the Alps into the region
over the industrial zone where the
Italians produce most of their war
materials.)
The drone of motors again was
audible about 2:20 a.m., when the
planes were proceeding in a north
westward direction.
