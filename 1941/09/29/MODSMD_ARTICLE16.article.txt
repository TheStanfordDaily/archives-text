# Concert Ticket Price to Increase
## 
### 
All students and other persons
who are planning to buy season tick
ets to this year's Concert Series
must buy them before this Wednes
day, Oct. 1, if they wish to avoid
the new 10 per cent amusement tax
which will become effective on that
date.
The tickets arc now selling to stu
dents at $2, $3, $4, and $5. After
Oct. 1 the prices will be $2.20, $3.30.
$4.40, nnd $5.50.
The additional tax is one of many
new levies included in the gigantic
tax bill passed by Congress and
signed by President Roosevelt two
week's ago. The Concert Series of
fice was notified of the new levy on
its tickets last Thursday.
