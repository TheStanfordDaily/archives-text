# Students Reject Willkie?
## 
### 
No other presidential candidate
ever had the student following that
was enjeyed by Wendell Willkie,
hilt student leaders in a good po
sition to feel the political pulse of
the nation's campuses, believe the
general feeling to be that Willkie
has let his student followers down.
Students seem to he bewildered by
his political maneuvering.
This was the conclusion reached
after a coast-to-coast survey con
ducted by the Associate College
News Syndicate. In the East, a
Yale man was quoted as saying,
"When Willkie referred to his
campaign speeches, before the For
eign Affairs committee in Wash
ington, as 'just campaign oratory,'
we were floored." In the Middle
West, several students were of the
opinion that we were "closer to
war" as a result of Willkie's sup

port of the Administration's for
eign policy. An Ohio State co-ed
said, "If we had had any sense,
we would have cheered for Taft
at the Philadelphia convention."
On the Coast, the survey says
that there is a "definite feeling of
disappointment over Willkie's
stand," mostly because of its ef
fect 011 the regular (Â»OP. An un
identified Stanford man attacked
Willkie's expressed intention of
campaigning only for those Repub
lican candidates who support
Roosevelt's foreign policy, as a
"purge." Students at U.S.C. con
curred in this view.
The general conclusion of the
survey seems to be that Willkie
did not take his student follow
ers with him to the Administra
tion side, and that he will find
little support on the campus in the
future.
