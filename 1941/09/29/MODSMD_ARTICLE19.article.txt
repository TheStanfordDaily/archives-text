# Farm's Opening To Live Again
## Jordan Voice Record Part of Friday Fete 
### 
The scene in 1891 that evoked from
a witness a prediction of the future
election of a President of the United
States will be re-enacted in exact
detail Friday evening during Stan
ford University's five-day celebra
tion this week of the fiftieth anni
versary of the event.
Andrew Hill, a photographer, took
a picture of the opening ceremonies
of the University on Oct. 1, 1891. In
sending a print to Mrs. Leland Stan
ford a few days later he wrote: "I
cxpect to vote for a President of
these United States who carried a
sheepskin from the Stanford Junior
University, and I wish with all my
heart you and the Governor may
live to see the same."
HOOVER WAS THERE
Herbert Hoover, destined to be
President of the United States, was
not only present at the opening
ceremonies, but was the first of the
559 new students to arrive upon the
campus.
Members of that pioneer class will
be honored guests at an open-air
festival in the Inner Quad beginning
at 8 p.m. on Friday, when the open
ing ceremonies of 1891 will be re
enacted on the same spot by players
taking the roles of the founders and
other participants.
JORDAN'S VOICE
The voice of the first president,
the late Dr. David Starr Jordan will
be heard as a dramatic interlude in
the midst of the festival. Old ster
eopticon slides picturing the early
history of the University will be
flashed upon a screen, and with the
showing of a picture of Dr. Jordan
his voice will resound throughout
the quad from a phonograph rec
ord entitled "The Spirit of Stan
ford" made by him in 1916, the year
that he became chancellor of the
University.
Charles K. Field, nationally -
known radio man and a member of
the pioneer class of 1895, will re
view the University history during
the Friday evening festival in the
quad. In revival of an old student
custom, singing and dancing will
take place under the sky.
