# Stanford Shades Oregon In Wild Thriller, 19-15 For Season's First Win
## Indians Come from Behind Twice To Win Battle of Long Passes, But Muff Many Scoring Opportunities 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Although they weren't given the axe, the confident behemoths from
Eugene were given their first defeat on the gridiron in nine monllis b.v
Stanford's will-be-better football team by the Los Arcos-Theta
Chi mural basketball score of 19 to 15 before 35,000 humid Americans in

the Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Opportunity, contrary to the usual
procedure, knocked not twice but
many times on the Cards' door.
However, they could only capitalize
on these opportunities three times,
while letting many prospective points
fly out the 220 straightaway. Two
passes over the defenses of the
Stanford halfbacks plus a safety after
a muffed pass nearly neutralized the
total efforts of the local heroes.
FASSES PEACHY
Using the most deftly conceived
passing attack ever seen in this part
of the country, the Shaughnessymen
were on the offense most of the
game, which wore the team down
quickly despite the 80 substitutions
employed by Coach Clark.
Out of the game as the hero was
projected Frank Albert, a quarter
back from Glendale. The little
known senior passed like a south
paw Benny Friedman, ran like his
teammate and captain, Pete Kmeto
vic, called signals like Frankie Al
bert, and ran all over field on de
fense tackling the Webfoots' climax
backs with regularity after tho lat
ter had eluded six or eight previous
assailants.
QUARTERBACK FLASHY
Albert, who certainly should be
boomed for All-America honors if
he continues to play the sterling
game he played Saturday, kicked
only twice during the entire game
for an average of 4fi.51 yards. He
played the entire game except, for
two brief respites while Oregon had
the ball.
Although pre-game publicity and
pre-season pickings had rated Ore
gon as the dark horse and the team
to beat in the P.C.C. race, this had
been taken as the usual build-up
and had therefore been disregarded.
However, the Ducks had a 210-
pound line with experience at every
position. This, plus excellent line
backers and a floating guard, made
their defense one of the toughest
ever experienced by Stanford's T.
At different times throughout the
game Slanford showed all the essen
tials of a great, football team. In the
opening minutes of play Eric Arm
strong plowed over the left side of
the opposition's line in the best Gal
larneau fashion. Downfield blocking
by Freddie Meyer and Kmetovic set
up two long runs by taking two or
three men. out of the play simulta
neously.
Although the Farm team's pass
defense has taken a beating for its
lapses, five interceptions were cred
ited to them and they came at times
when it counted.
Curt Mecham, Tom Boblin, and
Jim NeWquist handled the offense
for Ducks in a fashion that even had
the blase Stanford rooting section
worried, although not to the point
where they felt it necessary to give
out with the axe yell.
Newquist and quarterback "Dou
ble 0" Iverson stood out on defense
as did "Abner" Wilson, who gave
a 56-minute performance at center,
while the ballyhooed Ray Segale
barely outdid his substitute.
CONTESTANTS SAD
The game left neither side in a
very cheery mood. Maybe Stanford
should be glad they won; maybe
Oregon should be proud of the ex
cellent showing they made. Actually
the team from Eugene had been con
fident ol victory as they had been
drilled on movies of the Red ma
chine in action last year for the
past week. The local boys knew
that discrepancies appeared in their
play all too often.
The game opened with a big
splurge by the Cards that ended in
a score after six minutes. After ten
plays Albert moved over from the 4.
Oregon immediately retaliated with
a 70-yard drive, climaxed by a pass
play from Roblin to Mecham that
gained 50 yards.
ALBERT SNEAKS
Halfway through the second pe
riod the Indians started another suc
cessful drive. It went 53 yards in
cluding a 15-yard roughing penalty
that put the ball on the one. Albert
snuck the required 36 inches to
make him the leading scorer on the
coast.
After watching scintillating stunts
during the half, the crowd saw the
visitors make their way 78 yards up
the field in 11 plays for a tally. Rob
lin threw it to Tony Crish for the
score.
VUCINICH PLOWS
With the score 13 to 12 against
them Stanford's team went to work
and made the Duck tailback punt
only 12 yards upfield to give them
the ball on the Green and Yellow's
19. Milt Vucinich plowed through
oenter for the winning points.
Wilson pounced on Buck Faw
cett in the end zone when a lateral
eluded the Card sophomore for the
only score in the last quarter. It
brought the Webfoots' total up to 15.
Next week: about 40 Bruins and
40.000.000 alumni.

fly out the 220 straightaway. Two
passes over the defenses of the
Stanford halfbacks plus a safety after
a muffed pass nearly neutralized the
total efforts of the local heroes.
FASSES PEACHY
Using the most deftly conceived
passing attack ever seen in this part
of the country, the Shaughnessymen
were on the offense most of the
game, which wore the team down
quickly despite the 80 substitutions
employed by Coach Clark.
Out of the game as the hero was
projected Frank Albert, a quarter
back from Glendale. The little
known senior passed like a south
paw Benny Friedman, ran like his
teammate and captain, Pete Kmeto
vic, called signals like Frankie Al
bert, and ran all over field on de
fense tackling the Webfoots' climax
backs with regularity after tho lat
ter had eluded six or eight previous
assailants.
QUARTERBACK FLASHY
Albert, who certainly should be
boomed for All-America honors if
he continues to play the sterling
game he played Saturday, kicked
only twice during the entire game
for an average of 4fi.51 yards. He
played the entire game except, for
two brief respites while Oregon had
the ball.
Although pre-game publicity and
pre-season pickings had rated Ore
gon as the dark horse and the team
to beat in the P.C.C. race, this had
been taken as the usual build-up
and had therefore been disregarded.
However, the Ducks had a 210-
pound line with experience at every
position. This, plus excellent line
backers and a floating guard, made
their defense one of the toughest
ever experienced by Stanford's T.
At different times throughout the
game Slanford showed all the essen
tials of a great, football team. In the
opening minutes of play Eric Arm
strong plowed over the left side of
the opposition's line in the best Gal
larneau fashion. Downfield blocking
by Freddie Meyer and Kmetovic set
up two long runs by taking two or
three men. out of the play simulta
neously.
Although the Farm team's pass
defense has taken a beating for its
lapses, five interceptions were cred
ited to them and they came at times
when it counted.
Curt Mecham, Tom Boblin, and
Jim NeWquist handled the offense
for Ducks in a fashion that even had
the blase Stanford rooting section
worried, although not to the point
where they felt it necessary to give
out with the axe yell.
Newquist and quarterback "Dou
ble 0" Iverson stood out on defense
as did "Abner" Wilson, who gave
a 56-minute performance at center,
while the ballyhooed Ray Segale
barely outdid his substitute.
CONTESTANTS SAD
The game left neither side in a
very cheery mood. Maybe Stanford
should be glad they won; maybe
Oregon should be proud of the ex
cellent showing they made. Actually
the team from Eugene had been con
fident ol victory as they had been
drilled on movies of the Red ma
chine in action last year for the
past week. The local boys knew
that discrepancies appeared in their
play all too often.
The game opened with a big
splurge by the Cards that ended in
a score after six minutes. After ten
plays Albert moved over from the 4.
Oregon immediately retaliated with
a 70-yard drive, climaxed by a pass
play from Roblin to Mecham that
gained 50 yards.
ALBERT SNEAKS
Halfway through the second pe
riod the Indians started another suc
cessful drive. It went 53 yards in
cluding a 15-yard roughing penalty
that put the ball on the one. Albert
snuck the required 36 inches to
make him the leading scorer on the
coast.
After watching scintillating stunts
during the half, the crowd saw the
visitors make their way 78 yards up
the field in 11 plays for a tally. Rob
lin threw it to Tony Crish for the
score.
VUCINICH PLOWS
With the score 13 to 12 against
them Stanford's team went to work
and made the Duck tailback punt
only 12 yards upfield to give them
the ball on the Green and Yellow's
19. Milt Vucinich plowed through
oenter for the winning points.
Wilson pounced on Buck Faw
cett in the end zone when a lateral
eluded the Card sophomore for the
only score in the last quarter. It
brought the Webfoots' total up to 15.
Next week: about 40 Bruins and
40.000.000 alumni.
Although they weren't given the axe, the confident behemoths from
Eugene were given their first defeat on the gridiron in nine monllis b.v
Stanford's will-be-better football team by the Los Arcos-Theta
Chi mural basketball score of 19 to 15 before 35,000 humid Americans in

the Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Opportunity, contrary to the usual
procedure, knocked not twice but
many times on the Cards' door.
However, they could only capitalize
on these opportunities three times,
while letting many prospective points
fly out the 220 straightaway. Two
passes over the defenses of the
Stanford halfbacks plus a safety after

QUARTERBACK FLASHY
Albert, who certainly should be
boomed for All-America honors if
he continues to play the sterling
game he played Saturday, kicked
only twice during the entire game
for an average of 4fi.51 yards. He
played the entire game except, for
two brief respites while Oregon had
the ball.
Although pre-game publicity and
pre-season pickings had rated Ore
gon as the dark horse and the team
to beat in the P.C.C. race, this had
been taken as the usual build-up
and had therefore been disregarded.
However, the Ducks had a 210-
pound line with experience at every
position. This, plus excellent line
backers and a floating guard, made
their defense one of the toughest
ever experienced by Stanford's T.
At different times throughout the
game Slanford showed all the essen

Stanford's will-be-better football team by the Los Arcos-Theta

the Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Opportunity, contrary to the usual
procedure, knocked not twice but
many times on the Cards' door.
However, they could only capitalize
on these opportunities three times,
while letting many prospective points
fly out the 220 straightaway. Two
passes over the defenses of the
Stanford halfbacks plus a safety after
a muffed pass nearly neutralized the
total efforts of the local heroes.
FASSES PEACHY
Using the most deftly conceived
passing attack ever seen in this part
of the country, the Shaughnessymen
were on the offense most of the
game, which wore the team down
quickly despite the 80 substitutions
employed by Coach Clark.
Out of the game as the hero was
projected Frank Albert, a quarter
back from Glendale. The little
known senior passed like a south

for Ducks in a fashion that even had
the blase Stanford rooting section
worried, although not to the point

out with the axe yell.
Newquist and quarterback "Dou

CONTESTANTS SAD
The game left neither side in a
very cheery mood. Maybe Stanford
should be glad they won; maybe
Oregon should be proud of the ex
cellent showing they made. Actually
the team from Eugene had been con
fident ol victory as they had been
drilled on movies of the Red ma
chine in action last year for the
past week. The local boys knew
that discrepancies appeared in their
play all too often.
The game opened with a big
splurge by the Cards that ended in
a score after six minutes. After ten

Oregon immediately retaliated with
a 70-yard drive, climaxed by a pass
