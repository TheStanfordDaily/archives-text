# Stanford Shades Oregon In Wild Thriller, 19-15 For Season's First Win
## Indians Come from Behind Twice To Win Battle of Long Passes, But Muff Many Scoring Opportunities 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Although they weren't given the axe, the confident behemoths from
Eugene were given their first defeat on the gridiron in nine monllis b.v
Stanford's will-be-better football team by the Los Arcos-Theta
Chi mural basketball score of 19 to 15 before 35,000 humid Americans in

the Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Opportunity, contrary to the usual
procedure, knocked not twice but
many times on the Cards' door.
However, they could only capitalize
on these opportunities three times,
while letting many prospective points
fly out the 220 straightaway. Two
passes over the defenses of the
Stanford halfbacks plus a safety after
a muffed pass nearly neutralized the
total efforts of the local heroes.
FASSES PEACHY
Using the most deftly conceived
passing attack ever seen in this part
of the country, the Shaughnessymen
were on the offense most of the
game, which wore the team down
quickly despite the 80 substitutions
employed by Coach Clark.
Out of the game as the hero was
projected Frank Albert, a quarter
back from Glendale. The little
known senior passed like a south
paw Benny Friedman, ran like his
teammate and captain, Pete Kmeto
vic, called signals like Frankie Al
bert, and ran all over field on de
fense tackling the Webfoots' climax
backs with regularity after tho lat
ter had eluded six or eight previous
assailants.
QUARTERBACK FLASHY
Albert, who certainly should be
boomed for All-America honors if
he continues to play the sterling
game he played Saturday, kicked
only twice during the entire game
for an average of 4fi.51 yards. He
played the entire game except, for
two brief respites while Oregon had
the ball.
Although pre-game publicity and
pre-season pickings had rated Ore
gon as the dark horse and the team
to beat in the P.C.C. race, this had
been taken as the usual build-up
and had therefore been disregarded.
However, the Ducks had a 210-
pound line with experience at every
position. This, plus excellent line
backers and a floating guard, made
their defense one of the toughest
ever experienced by Stanford's T.
At different times throughout the
game Slanford showed all the essen
tials of a great, football team. In the
opening minutes of play Eric Arm
strong plowed over the left side of
the opposition's line in the best Gal
larneau fashion. Downfield blocking
