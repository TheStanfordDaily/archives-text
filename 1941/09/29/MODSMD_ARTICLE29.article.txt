# Jim McKellar Says A.S.S.U. Funds Slashed
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
"Because of the decrease in regis- j
(ration, the 1941-42 school budget j
must necessarily be cut down," says j
Student Manager Jim McKellar as j
he begins his year of work guiding !
A.S.S.U. expenses.
However, there is no necessity for I
this fact to work any particular
hardship this year because of the
many fine student activity managers
who are "willing to work harder and
co-operate with this reduced bud
get."
THE COMMUNITY FEE
With these beginning statements,
Manager McKellar went on to ex
plain his job and how the $15 com
munity fee to which close to 4000
Stanford students contribute as part
of their $143 registration fee every
quarter is divided.
Before going into his breakdown
on these finances, McKellar empha
sized that he hoped lhat incoming
freshmen would take advantage of
the many opportunities to work
into managerial jobs.
McKellar, who was appointed by
A1 Masters to his present position at
the end of last quarter after being
business manager of the Quad for a
year, named the business staffs of
the Daily, the Chaparral, and the
Quad as excellent starting places.
"Not only do these jobs offer ex
cellent training for future business
careers, but many pay salaries and
help to defray college expense,"
added Stanford's student financial
guide.
WHERE $15 GOES
He continued by explaining that
the $15 is broken, up into the fol
lowing seven divisions:
$s—Guild5 —Guild fee—includes help with
student hospital expenses and ex
penses for Men's and Women's
Health Services.
$5 — Gym fee—gym expenses,
equipment, towels, etc.
$1 —8.A.C., for student body cards.
$I—Men1 —Men students pay this to the
Union. Women students pay this to
the Women's Clubhouse.
$I—Memorial1 —Memorial Theater Fund.
75 cents — Subscription to The
Daily.
$1.25 —Associated Students.
The $1.25 remaining from each
student is what McKellar has to
support the many campus organi
zations and activities without reve
nue, including the Cardinals, Rally
Committee, Executive Committee,
Men's Council, Glee Club, Women's
Vocom, Students Federation, debat
ing, frosh handbook, election board,
Big Game bonfire, rallies, and var
