# Students May Be Deferred To Complete College Term
## 
### 
A plan for postponing induction of college students into the armed
forces so that they may finish partially completed semesters and quarter
terms without undue hardship before starting military training was an
nounced last night by Brig. Gen. Joseph O. Donovan, state director of

service.
"If a local board determines that
a particular student registrant is in
training and preparation to perform
a function which the national inter
est required should be performed,
and that at the time such student
will begin to perform that function
there will be a shortage of persons
qualified to perform such function,
it should defer such student," Dono
van said.
He further stated that a student
i might be granted an extension in
order to prepare for and take an
examination, or to complete a col
lege term which he started in good
faith after ascertaining that his in
duction would not normally occur
until a reasonable portion of such a
term had expired.
To enter collcge in "good faith," a
registrant must obtain word from
, his local board that he is not sched
uled for induction in the near fu
! lure. Local boards will assist regis
trants by telling them about how
soon they may be called for train
ing.
If it appears, however, according
to the National Headquarters, that
a student registrant will not be or
dered to report for induction until
well into the college term, it is ap
parent that his induction might reas
onably be postponed until the end
of the term.
