Serving cream chicken with collage cheese Co elderly vacationers and
moonlight hikes nj) to Half dome featured the sununer for a group of Stan
ford students who worked as waitresses and bushoys at (he various resorts
in Yosemite.
Working front (i:l5 to 9:30, 11:45 to 2:20 ami from 5:15 to 8:30, the men

earned $50 a month and the
$30 a month waiting on table and
working in the kitchen. Their room
and board were included,
TIPS AND CROQUET
The group worked at Camp Cur
ry, the Wawona, the Lodge and the
Ahwahnce, and in addition to their
regular wages averaged $10 a week
in tips. After their working hours
were finished their time was their
own, and they were able to utilize
all of the park's recreational facil
ities. Croquet proved to be the sur
prise sport of the summer, with ev
erybody forsaking swimming and
riding to wield a mallet.
CO-ED DORMITORY
The old Sequoia Hotel has been
turned into a dormitory for the staff.
The boys lived on the first floor and
â€¢the girls took over the second floor.
The professional cooks acted as
chaperones and frequently were an
noyed as the girls insisted upon rid
ing an old bicycle up and down the
hall.
The summer workers were allowed
on the Ahwahnee dance pavilion if
they cared to dress formally. More
congenial was the Fish Camp Bar
outside the park, where nickelodeon
dancing prevailed. Chief difficulty
after spending an evening there was
in convincing the ranger that they
should be allowed back into the
park.
BE AC HKRIEG S' POPU LAR
Beach picnics, called "beach
kiregs," were popular and at the
*nd of the summer the staff at Camp
Curry put on a show for the sum
mer guests.
Among those who spent the sum
mer hashing were Don Burness, Jim
Hirst. Jim Disher, Tia Kent, Ticky
Eltson, Bob Snoddy, Mrs. Bob
Snoddy, John La wry, Bruce Wylie,
Cal Knickerbocker, Temple Slaget
ter, and Merrill Joy.
A few embarrassing moments
occurred, typical of which was one
j of the hashers getting into the wrong
room with his breakfast tray, but
the summer was a worthwhile one
and several have put in applications
for work for next summer already.
