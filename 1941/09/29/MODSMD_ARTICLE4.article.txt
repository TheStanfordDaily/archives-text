# Gaieties Seeks 'Six Hits, Dent'
## 
### 
Two bassos, tw# baritones, two
tenors, and an alto are being sought
by F. Scott Marion for the reorgan
ization of the "Six Hits and a Dent,"
first organized by Bill Quinn of the
Gashouse.
Scott wishes that all tryoutees
would see him in the Ram's Head
office between 3 and 5 p.m. on Mon
day or Tuesday. The Ram's Head
room is the little nook at the end of
the areaway in the rear of the Me
morial Theater with two rickety
pianos in it.
A large part in this year's Gaie
ties has been scheduled for the vocal
ensemble if they can get organized
in time.
The Gaieties, traditionally the gag
session of the fall quarter, will un
fold for students and others for two
performances, afternoon and eve
ning, Nov. 28.
