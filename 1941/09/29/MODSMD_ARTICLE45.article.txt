# Louis Favored To Out-Slug Nova Tonight
## 
### 
Lou Nova keeps a rendezvous with
a blackout tonight at the Polo
Grounds in New York as he and
Joe Louis collide in a 15-round
battle for the world's heavyweight
title.
Betting odds favor the Detroit
Brown Bomber 5-12. Most of the
sportwriters in the Gotham are of
the opinion that Nova will trade
punches with Louis on even grounds.
But they figure Louis, who hasn't
been licked since Max Schmeling
K.O.'d him in 1936, will leave for
army training soon still retaining
the championship.
KNOCKOUT TRY?
Today on the morn of the fight,
reports are that Nova is a picture
of physical fitness, looking like a
Bernarr McFadden special.
But there are reasons why Nova
may get taken to the cleaners in
short order when he and the Bomber
square off.
Nova, last of the white hopes to
get a crack at Louis for some time,
is too slow, ahead and afoot. And
he is known to be bullheaded at
the same time. It is possible that
Lou may rush from his corner at
the opening bell and try for the
knockout punch.
SCHMELING DID IT
And why not?
If everybody thinks he's going to
lose anyway, why not charge in
there and get it over with? When
Schmeling won over Louis in '36,
he caught the Bomber with a stiff
right to the whiskers when the bell
for the first rotind opened. From
there on he clubbed the champion
until the twelfth round, when Louis
went down for good.
So if Nova trades punches with
Louis from the start, chances arc he
will either put across the telling
punch or take it on the chin him
self—and that's what everyone ex
pects, so give it, or take it, Lou—
makes no difference.
