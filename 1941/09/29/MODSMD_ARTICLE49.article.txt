# Frosh Wallop Bakersfield 12-0 in Season's Opener
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Striking in the second quarter and again in the final stanza, Stanford's
yearling football squad walloped Bakersfield J. C., 12-0, Saturday in the
opening game of the frosh season.
Clement Woods, seeond-string fullback from Beverly High, spark
plugged the initial touchdown drive as the Papooses moved <>4 yards in

ten plays to the three-yard line..
Dave Pate, who had started the game
at full, came in for Woods and
bucked over beautifully for the
score.
RUN SPARKS DRIVE
Midway in the fourth quarter after
play surged back and forth with
neither team threatening, Cannon
Parkinson, reserve quarter, returned
a punt 34 yards behind nice block
ing to the Bakersfield 36-yard line,
from whence the second scoring
drive started.
Parkinson faked to his two half
backs, Jim Petitt and Fred Parsons,
and skirted right end for ten yards,
but the play was nullified by an off
side penalty. Pate dropped back and
i fired a long, slightly wobbly pass
which was knocked by a defender
j into the waiting arms of Petitt on
t the ten.
PARSONS SCORES
Pate smacked guard for two and
Parsons for four. On the next play
Parsons slammed over for the score.
I Parkinson's attempt at placement
I was wide.
Using the T formation exclusively,
the Papooses looked surprisingly
strong against a rugged Oiler eleven.
Harvey Bernhard was great on the
line, breaking through several times
to nail his man for a loss. Bob Hall,
a reserve end, also slashed through
once to bring down a ball carrier
behind the scrimmage line.
FROSII BACKS GOOD
Petitt, Parsons, Parkinson, like
j P's in a pod, couldn't be told apart
j from their equally good efforts, and
Ross Dana and Fred Sanderman also
showed glimpses of outstanding
| play. Next Saturday the frosh tackle
Long Beach J. C. in Stanford
! Stadium.
