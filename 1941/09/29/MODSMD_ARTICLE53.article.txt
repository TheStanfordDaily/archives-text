LOOK OVER this Stanford football team and the game it played
in defeating the University of, Oregon Saturday.
Contrary to the way many Stanford rooters feel about the contest, we're |
| not disappointed. The team won; that's the main thing. The fact that the j
I Big Red Machine didn't massacre the Ducks may have been a pretty good
j thing.
Now the coaches, Clark Shaughnessy, Phil Bcngtson. Marchie
Schwartz, ami Jim Lawson, and the players, too, know that things
are NOT right. They're all going to work much harder to smooth out
, Stanford's game than they would have had the contest been a walk
away. That is, they all will except Shaughnessy, who couldn't pos
sibly work any harder than he already does: Furthermore, they can
use the game pictures to see their mistakes, the ones they don't
remember.
For a change most of the emphasis in the bay region (and on the whole
Pacific Coast) will be on the Golden Bears of the University of California,
conquerors of a pitiful St. Mary's eleven. The Bears will be the ones to
i carry the praises—also, the pressure. The Indians may get a little relief.
And in the quiet of their pasture, behind a high green fence, those
Indians are going to go to work. If the result isn't a team that plays
the Ucla game next Saturday with a lot more zip and a more smoothly
functioning offense than was exhibited in the Oregon battle, we'll do
something more desperate than apologize, which is what we are doing
right now for predicting that you'd see an Indian eleven last Sat
urday that would "lay 'em in the aisles."
But you did see a passing attack that was very close to perfect, at
least from a grandstand fan's point of view. Time and again the Indian
pass receivers were so clear that Frankie Albert could have lobbed the
ball to them without fear of an interception. And the pitching of the
1 great little quarterback was beautiful to behold.

r THE GRID enthusiasts who were talking over the Stanford-Oregon
I game after it was all over, the fact that the Redshirts won their 11th
' straight game under Shaughnessy appeared to be insignificant. That the
i game was close was the main subject of comment.
Why was it close? Maybe we can find an answer or so to that question:
I. Oregon was a much better team than most football observers
thought they would be. They had a very strong line, and their 5-3-2-1
defense, with the middle line backer very close to the line, kept Stan
ford's inside-tackle stuff from functioning as it should, for the line
backers just would not move out to cover the flankers and thereby
leave a gap in the secondary lor the ball carrier to shoot through.
Saturday night Freddie Meyer said that he thought that Oregon was
every bit as tough a ball club as Nebraska was in the Rose Bowl the
first day of this year.
2. The Stanford team lacked condition. They were dead on their feet
long before the end of the game. After the game Chuck Taylor, who lost
, 12 pounds during the fracas, said that he'd never been so tired in a foot-
I ball game in his life. And he wasn't the only one. Wonder what it would
have been like without the new substitution rule? It couldn't have been
the heat alone, for the Ducks were playing in the same stadium. But it
very easily could have been the fact that Stanford was on offense for the
greater part of the first half and the fact that Oregon played a very rough,
tough brand of ball, plus a general lack of condition.
Because the linebackers held their positions when the Indians em
ployed the Hanker, the set-up was right for wide stuff. But both the backs
and the linemen, especially the former, were just too tired to do all the
running required on the wide end runs. Albert called them as often as
he could, but even a great little speed merchant like Kmetovic couldn't
keep up running from one sideline to the other on every play, although
he did extremely well when he did run on the wide plays.
3. Stanford lacked the power shots that Norm Standlee and Hugh
Gallarncau supplied last year, especially in scoring territory, as evi
denced by the Indians' failure to tally when presented the oppor
tunity. This especially noticeable at the right half spot, where the
boys just don't seem to be the slashing, powerful, driving runners
that Gallarncau was. Eric Armstrong lacks the weight, although he's
a hard runner, while Bob Ditlevsen is the speedy, lightfooted, shifty
type of ball carrier. Buck Fawcett appears to have the most poten
tialities, but he isn't quite the all-around ballplayer right now that
Armstrong is.
* * * *
Notes from the press box:
Good stuff—Kmetovic's running. . . . Good downfield blocking, as evi
denced by the blocks put on by Meyer and Kmetovic on two plays when
Albert ran the bull. . . . Hoot Armstrong's ability to keep his feet when
hit in the open field. . . . Loren LaPrade's defensive ball playing. . . . Hank
Norberg's pass catching and all-around play. . . . And Albert's passing,
daring in signal calling, running, and defensive play. . . . Several times
Albert, was the last man between the ball carrier and the goal line, but he
never missed the tackle.
Not such good stuff—Fumbles by Stanford backs, but don't expect
that to happen again in such a large quantity. . . . Armstrong's lack of

height making it tough for him on
pass defense. . . . The absence of the
old fire that was so evident in the
team last year. . . . Vucinich's slow
ness on end runs.

boys just don't seem to be the slashing, powerful, driving runners
that Gallarncau was. Eric Armstrong lacks the weight, although he's
a hard runner, while Bob Ditlevsen is the speedy, lightfooted, shifty
type of ball carrier. Buck Fawcett appears to have the most poten

Notes from the press box:
Good stuff—Kmetovic's running. . . . Good downfield blocking, as evi
denced by the blocks put on by Meyer and Kmetovic on two plays when
Albert ran the bull. . . . Hoot Armstrong's ability to keep his feet when
hit in the open field. . . . Loren LaPrade's defensive ball playing. . . . Hank
Norberg's pass catching and all-around play. . . . And Albert's passing,
daring in signal calling, running, and defensive play. . . . Several times
Albert, was the last man between the ball carrier and the goal line, but he
never missed the tackle.
Not such good stuff—Fumbles by Stanford backs, but don't expect
that to happen again in such a large quantity. . . . Armstrong's lack of

height making it tough for him on
pass defense. . . . The absence of the
old fire that was so evident in the
team last year. . . . Vucinich's slow
ness on end runs.
LOOK OVER this Stanford football team and the game it played
in defeating the University of, Oregon Saturday.
Contrary to the way many Stanford rooters feel about the contest, we're |
| not disappointed. The team won; that's the main thing. The fact that the j
I Big Red Machine didn't massacre the Ducks may have been a pretty good
j thing.
Now the coaches, Clark Shaughnessy, Phil Bcngtson. Marchie
Schwartz, ami Jim Lawson, and the players, too, know that things
are NOT right. They're all going to work much harder to smooth out
, Stanford's game than they would have had the contest been a walk
away. That is, they all will except Shaughnessy, who couldn't pos
sibly work any harder than he already does: Furthermore, they can
use the game pictures to see their mistakes, the ones they don't
remember.
For a change most of the emphasis in the bay region (and on the whole
Pacific Coast) will be on the Golden Bears of the University of California,
conquerors of a pitiful St. Mary's eleven. The Bears will be the ones to
i carry the praises—also, the pressure. The Indians may get a little relief.
And in the quiet of their pasture, behind a high green fence, those
Indians are going to go to work. If the result isn't a team that plays
the Ucla game next Saturday with a lot more zip and a more smoothly
functioning offense than was exhibited in the Oregon battle, we'll do
something more desperate than apologize, which is what we are doing
right now for predicting that you'd see an Indian eleven last Sat
urday that would "lay 'em in the aisles."
But you did see a passing attack that was very close to perfect, at
least from a grandstand fan's point of view. Time and again the Indian
pass receivers were so clear that Frankie Albert could have lobbed the
ball to them without fear of an interception. And the pitching of the
1 great little quarterback was beautiful to behold.

r THE GRID enthusiasts who were talking over the Stanford-Oregon
I game after it was all over, the fact that the Redshirts won their 11th
' straight game under Shaughnessy appeared to be insignificant. That the
i game was close was the main subject of comment.
Why was it close? Maybe we can find an answer or so to that question:
I. Oregon was a much better team than most football observers
thought they would be. They had a very strong line, and their 5-3-2-1
defense, with the middle line backer very close to the line, kept Stan
ford's inside-tackle stuff from functioning as it should, for the line
backers just would not move out to cover the flankers and thereby
leave a gap in the secondary lor the ball carrier to shoot through.
Saturday night Freddie Meyer said that he thought that Oregon was
every bit as tough a ball club as Nebraska was in the Rose Bowl the
first day of this year.
2. The Stanford team lacked condition. They were dead on their feet
long before the end of the game. After the game Chuck Taylor, who lost
, 12 pounds during the fracas, said that he'd never been so tired in a foot-
I ball game in his life. And he wasn't the only one. Wonder what it would
have been like without the new substitution rule? It couldn't have been
the heat alone, for the Ducks were playing in the same stadium. But it
very easily could have been the fact that Stanford was on offense for the
greater part of the first half and the fact that Oregon played a very rough,
tough brand of ball, plus a general lack of condition.
Because the linebackers held their positions when the Indians em
ployed the Hanker, the set-up was right for wide stuff. But both the backs
and the linemen, especially the former, were just too tired to do all the
running required on the wide end runs. Albert called them as often as
he could, but even a great little speed merchant like Kmetovic couldn't
keep up running from one sideline to the other on every play, although
he did extremely well when he did run on the wide plays.
3. Stanford lacked the power shots that Norm Standlee and Hugh
Gallarncau supplied last year, especially in scoring territory, as evi
denced by the Indians' failure to tally when presented the oppor
tunity. This especially noticeable at the right half spot, where the
boys just don't seem to be the slashing, powerful, driving runners
that Gallarncau was. Eric Armstrong lacks the weight, although he's

every bit as tough a ball club as Nebraska was in the Rose Bowl the
first day of this year.
2. The Stanford team lacked condition. They were dead on their feet
long before the end of the game. After the game Chuck Taylor, who lost
, 12 pounds during the fracas, said that he'd never been so tired in a foot-
I ball game in his life. And he wasn't the only one. Wonder what it would
have been like without the new substitution rule? It couldn't have been
the heat alone, for the Ducks were playing in the same stadium. But it
very easily could have been the fact that Stanford was on offense for the
greater part of the first half and the fact that Oregon played a very rough,
tough brand of ball, plus a general lack of condition.
Because the linebackers held their positions when the Indians em
ployed the Hanker, the set-up was right for wide stuff. But both the backs
and the linemen, especially the former, were just too tired to do all the
running required on the wide end runs. Albert called them as often as
he could, but even a great little speed merchant like Kmetovic couldn't
keep up running from one sideline to the other on every play, although
he did extremely well when he did run on the wide plays.
3. Stanford lacked the power shots that Norm Standlee and Hugh
Gallarncau supplied last year, especially in scoring territory, as evi
denced by the Indians' failure to tally when presented the oppor
tunity. This especially noticeable at the right half spot, where the
boys just don't seem to be the slashing, powerful, driving runners
that Gallarncau was. Eric Armstrong lacks the weight, although he's
a hard runner, while Bob Ditlevsen is the speedy, lightfooted, shifty
type of ball carrier. Buck Fawcett appears to have the most poten
tialities, but he isn't quite the all-around ballplayer right now that
Armstrong is.

Notes from the press box:
Good stuff—Kmetovic's running. . . . Good downfield blocking, as evi
denced by the blocks put on by Meyer and Kmetovic on two plays when
Albert ran the bull. . . . Hoot Armstrong's ability to keep his feet when
hit in the open field. . . . Loren LaPrade's defensive ball playing. . . . Hank
Norberg's pass catching and all-around play. . . . And Albert's passing,
daring in signal calling, running, and defensive play. . . . Several times
Albert, was the last man between the ball carrier and the goal line, but he
never missed the tackle.
Not such good stuff—Fumbles by Stanford backs, but don't expect
that to happen again in such a large quantity. . . . Armstrong's lack of

height making it tough for him on
pass defense. . . . The absence of the
old fire that was so evident in the
team last year. . . . Vucinich's slow
ness on end runs.
LOOK OVER this Stanford football team and the game it played
in defeating the University of, Oregon Saturday.
Contrary to the way many Stanford rooters feel about the contest, we're |
| not disappointed. The team won; that's the main thing. The fact that the j
I Big Red Machine didn't massacre the Ducks may have been a pretty good
j thing.
Now the coaches, Clark Shaughnessy, Phil Bcngtson. Marchie
Schwartz, ami Jim Lawson, and the players, too, know that things
are NOT right. They're all going to work much harder to smooth out
, Stanford's game than they would have had the contest been a walk
away. That is, they all will except Shaughnessy, who couldn't pos
sibly work any harder than he already does: Furthermore, they can
use the game pictures to see their mistakes, the ones they don't
remember.
For a change most of the emphasis in the bay region (and on the whole
Pacific Coast) will be on the Golden Bears of the University of California,
conquerors of a pitiful St. Mary's eleven. The Bears will be the ones to
i carry the praises—also, the pressure. The Indians may get a little relief.
And in the quiet of their pasture, behind a high green fence, those
Indians are going to go to work. If the result isn't a team that plays
the Ucla game next Saturday with a lot more zip and a more smoothly
functioning offense than was exhibited in the Oregon battle, we'll do
something more desperate than apologize, which is what we are doing
right now for predicting that you'd see an Indian eleven last Sat
urday that would "lay 'em in the aisles."
But you did see a passing attack that was very close to perfect, at
least from a grandstand fan's point of view. Time and again the Indian
pass receivers were so clear that Frankie Albert could have lobbed the
ball to them without fear of an interception. And the pitching of the
1 great little quarterback was beautiful to behold.

r THE GRID enthusiasts who were talking over the Stanford-Oregon
I game after it was all over, the fact that the Redshirts won their 11th
' straight game under Shaughnessy appeared to be insignificant. That the
i game was close was the main subject of comment.
Why was it close? Maybe we can find an answer or so to that question:
I. Oregon was a much better team than most football observers
thought they would be. They had a very strong line, and their 5-3-2-1
defense, with the middle line backer very close to the line, kept Stan
ford's inside-tackle stuff from functioning as it should, for the line
backers just would not move out to cover the flankers and thereby
leave a gap in the secondary lor the ball carrier to shoot through.

the Ucla game next Saturday with a lot more zip and a more smoothly
functioning offense than was exhibited in the Oregon battle, we'll do
something more desperate than apologize, which is what we are doing
right now for predicting that you'd see an Indian eleven last Sat
urday that would "lay 'em in the aisles."
But you did see a passing attack that was very close to perfect, at
least from a grandstand fan's point of view. Time and again the Indian
pass receivers were so clear that Frankie Albert could have lobbed the
ball to them without fear of an interception. And the pitching of the
1 great little quarterback was beautiful to behold.

r THE GRID enthusiasts who were talking over the Stanford-Oregon
I game after it was all over, the fact that the Redshirts won their 11th
' straight game under Shaughnessy appeared to be insignificant. That the
i game was close was the main subject of comment.
Why was it close? Maybe we can find an answer or so to that question:
I. Oregon was a much better team than most football observers
thought they would be. They had a very strong line, and their 5-3-2-1
defense, with the middle line backer very close to the line, kept Stan
ford's inside-tackle stuff from functioning as it should, for the line
backers just would not move out to cover the flankers and thereby
leave a gap in the secondary lor the ball carrier to shoot through.
Saturday night Freddie Meyer said that he thought that Oregon was
every bit as tough a ball club as Nebraska was in the Rose Bowl the
first day of this year.
2. The Stanford team lacked condition. They were dead on their feet
long before the end of the game. After the game Chuck Taylor, who lost
, 12 pounds during the fracas, said that he'd never been so tired in a foot-
I ball game in his life. And he wasn't the only one. Wonder what it would
have been like without the new substitution rule? It couldn't have been
the heat alone, for the Ducks were playing in the same stadium. But it
very easily could have been the fact that Stanford was on offense for the
greater part of the first half and the fact that Oregon played a very rough,
tough brand of ball, plus a general lack of condition.
Because the linebackers held their positions when the Indians em
ployed the Hanker, the set-up was right for wide stuff. But both the backs
and the linemen, especially the former, were just too tired to do all the
running required on the wide end runs. Albert called them as often as
he could, but even a great little speed merchant like Kmetovic couldn't
keep up running from one sideline to the other on every play, although
he did extremely well when he did run on the wide plays.
3. Stanford lacked the power shots that Norm Standlee and Hugh
Gallarncau supplied last year, especially in scoring territory, as evi
denced by the Indians' failure to tally when presented the oppor
tunity. This especially noticeable at the right half spot, where the
boys just don't seem to be the slashing, powerful, driving runners
that Gallarncau was. Eric Armstrong lacks the weight, although he's
a hard runner, while Bob Ditlevsen is the speedy, lightfooted, shifty
type of ball carrier. Buck Fawcett appears to have the most poten
tialities, but he isn't quite the all-around ballplayer right now that
Armstrong is.

Notes from the press box:
Good stuff—Kmetovic's running. . . . Good downfield blocking, as evi
denced by the blocks put on by Meyer and Kmetovic on two plays when
Albert ran the bull. . . . Hoot Armstrong's ability to keep his feet when
hit in the open field. . . . Loren LaPrade's defensive ball playing. . . . Hank
Norberg's pass catching and all-around play. . . . And Albert's passing,
daring in signal calling, running, and defensive play. . . . Several times
Albert, was the last man between the ball carrier and the goal line, but he
never missed the tackle.
Not such good stuff—Fumbles by Stanford backs, but don't expect
that to happen again in such a large quantity. . . . Armstrong's lack of

height making it tough for him on
pass defense. . . . The absence of the
old fire that was so evident in the
team last year. . . . Vucinich's slow
ness on end runs.
