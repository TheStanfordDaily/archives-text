# Editorial Fireside
## 
### 
WE'RE still pretty green at this job of being
editor.
We're plugging along and managing to get
the paper out, though we have a great many
things yet to learn.
A newspaper, it seems, is just like a country
at war. It can't last very long, it won't have
many supporters, and it won't be respected if
it just "muddles through." It must take a defi
nite stand. It must fight tor the principles which
it believes right.
The whirl of pre-registration, registration,
changing programs, receptions, etc., has slack
ened and the campus has the time—and we
hope the desire—to keep themselves informed
of what is happening out beyond the Palm
Drive gates. It is to their interest to do so.
We believe The Daily, as a newspaper, should
take a very definite stand on the problems con
fronting not only our small community here, but
also the problems facing a world society at
tempting to commit suicide.
With these latter problems must be consid
ered those of our own nation—a house divided
against itself.
Now, this is not going to be an easy job,
discussing all these problems. Our readers are
college students and professors. They are not
the type of reader to whom some of the metro
politan papers address their arguments. We
can't get by around here influencing our readers
with name-calling, half-truths, jingoism and the
like. We have an intelligent audience, though
probably not as well informed on the present
situation as is the case in many other colleges,
particularly in the East.
Now, as to the decision. If we are not to
straddle the fence, v/hich side will we take?
America has gotten herself involved in a very
complicated world situation. Since 1918 she
has never been completely outside the fringe
of the European and Asiatic marlstrom which
has been forming ever since the first World
War ended. Today, she is no longer on that
fringe. She has stepped over the rim.
This country is now, and always will be, an
integral part of a world society in which the
isolation of one nation is impossible. Right
now there is a menace to that society and that
menace must be eradicated.
We have picked our side of the fence. We
think the menace can best be eradicated by
following the policies of the present adminis
tration.
We are going to try to look at the problems
of today and tomorrow fearlessly, objectively,
and sanely.
As a start, Herman Silverman discusses our
position with regard to the 176 professors now
being questioned by former President Herbert
Hoover.
