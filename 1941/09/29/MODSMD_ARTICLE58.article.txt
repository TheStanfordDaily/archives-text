# "Dynamic Defense"

### 
nation indivisible, with liberty and
V—' justice for all"—is a pledge that should
be repeated often by the isolationist group of
this country.
Today, the United States is not united, not
indivisible in perhaps its greatest crisis. The
small but vociferous faction led by Wheeler,
Lindbergh, and Nye—with Hearst as publicity
agent—violently attacks the administration in
an attempt to substitute its policy of "passive
defense" and the unsuccessful "isolationism"
for the aggressive, "dynamic defense" estab
lished by the administration and supported by
the vast majority in this country.
The support for President Roosevelt and his
policies was completely established last No
vember on election day.
Yet, the isolationists continue their sabotag
ing efforts, conducting movie investigations,
sending out government-franked post-card cam
paigns, beclouding the issue in every way. In
doing this, their sincerity is not to be questioned.
Their right to speak is also undeniable. The
wisdom of their campaign, however, resulting
in internal confusion which plays into the hands
of the enemies of the United States, is to be
condemned.
If it is to survive, the United States must face
the crisis united, not torn by partisanship, con
fusion, or indecison.
The policy of utmost aid to all nations fighting

aggression has been formulated, approved, and
is now in effect. It is too late to hesitate —even
if Messrs. Wheeler, Lindbergh, and Nye think
it best to pull an about-face. Where this policy
may lead us is difficult to predict. It is, how
ever, the established policy, supported by a
declaration of a national emergency, and should
be adhered to and supported by a unified
United States.
This does not imply that there is no need
for an opposition .
The United States will remain a democracy
only as long as there is an opposition, but let
it be an intelligent, useful group, not attempting
to hinder the course chosen by the people of
the United States. Let the opposition criticize
defense efforts to assure a maximum of success.
But it should cease its sabotaging activities.
With these facts in mind, The Stanford Daily
joins 176 Stanford professors, assistant, and
associate professors in supporting the national
administration, and heartily endorses the state
ment issued by the professors:
"Recognizing the fallacy of the idea that a
passive defense is still possible, we support a
more dynamic policy of action as the most effec
tive means of security against the totalitarian
menace."—Herman Silverman

small but vociferous faction led by Wheeler,
Lindbergh, and Nye—with Hearst as publicity
agent—violently attacks the administration in
an attempt to substitute its policy of "passive
defense" and the unsuccessful "isolationism"
for the aggressive, "dynamic defense" estab
lished by the administration and supported by
the vast majority in this country.
The support for President Roosevelt and his
policies was completely established last No
vember on election day.
Yet, the isolationists continue their sabotag
ing efforts, conducting movie investigations,
sending out government-franked post-card cam
paigns, beclouding the issue in every way. In
doing this, their sincerity is not to be questioned.
Their right to speak is also undeniable. The
wisdom of their campaign, however, resulting
in internal confusion which plays into the hands
of the enemies of the United States, is to be
condemned.
If it is to survive, the United States must face
the crisis united, not torn by partisanship, con
fusion, or indecison.
The policy of utmost aid to all nations fighting

aggression has been formulated, approved, and
is now in effect. It is too late to hesitate —even
if Messrs. Wheeler, Lindbergh, and Nye think
it best to pull an about-face. Where this policy
may lead us is difficult to predict. It is, how
ever, the established policy, supported by a
declaration of a national emergency, and should
be adhered to and supported by a unified
United States.
This does not imply that there is no need
for an opposition .
The United States will remain a democracy
only as long as there is an opposition, but let
it be an intelligent, useful group, not attempting
to hinder the course chosen by the people of
the United States. Let the opposition criticize
defense efforts to assure a maximum of success.
But it should cease its sabotaging activities.
With these facts in mind, The Stanford Daily
joins 176 Stanford professors, assistant, and
associate professors in supporting the national
administration, and heartily endorses the state
