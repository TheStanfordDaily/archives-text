# BULL SESSION
## 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
MONDAY ....
[T IS Monday morning, a bright sunny day, and the
first Monday after our first game. When little Hoot
Armstrong exploded through the Oregon line in our
first offensive play of the game, it looked like the In
dians were going to be as good as my imagination had
imagined them to be. But a couple of fumbles, a few
misplays, and Oregon's power line changed all of that.
Stanford is a good team, a very good team which needs
a lot of work.
From the spectators' standpoint, the game was one
of the dullest and most unorganized the T men have
ever played. The reason probably lies in the rule
change which allows free substitution. It seemed that
Ditlevsen was running in for Armstrong and Norberg
in for Meiners every time I looked up. There was, no
doubt, a lot of deep football strategy connected with
the moves, but still the game dragged miserably.
The new rule also destroys the effectiveness of our
name yells. It used to be that our football giants
played almost all of the game, came out in the last few
minutes, tired, sweaty, covered with mud, and re
ceived an ovation.
Now they run in and out, their suits bright and
clean, and the section gives them yells every time they
run in and out and after the sixth time they run in
and out nobody cai'es if they are in or out, and the
effectiveness is gone.
Gone also are the good old days.

TT WAS in the third quarter of Saturday's game.
Stanford was trailing the "Toreadors" from Ore
gon, 13-12. Things didn't look good. Joe Messina
raised his hands and hollered, "We're gonna do 'er.
We're going to give the Axe yell." There followed an
amazing few minutes. There were boos and cheers
and finally Messina asked for a vote. We actually voted
on whether we should give the axe yell or not.
The axe yell was at first meant to be for the Cali
fornia game only. Then, we broke tradition, and gave
the yell at the U.C.L.A. game because they were
brothers of the Bears, and at the U.S.C. game, be
cause they were our toughest opponent. Last year we
again looked away from tradition during the Washing
ton game, and gave the yell when we were trailing
10-0 late in the third period, and once again in the
Rose Bowl game, when we were behind Nebraska.
I think that we should decide whether we want to
save the yell for the three schools, California, Southern
California and U.C.L.A. as tradition has it, or break
tradition and give the yell at any game, when we feel
that the team needs a psychological lift. Whatever we
do, we shouldn't take a last minute poll of the rooting
section during the games.

MONDAY ....
[T IS Monday morning, a bright sunny day, and the
first Monday after our first game. When little Hoot
Armstrong exploded through the Oregon line in our
first offensive play of the game, it looked like the In
dians were going to be as good as my imagination had
imagined them to be. But a couple of fumbles, a few
misplays, and Oregon's power line changed all of that.
Stanford is a good team, a very good team which needs
a lot of work.
From the spectators' standpoint, the game was one
of the dullest and most unorganized the T men have
ever played. The reason probably lies in the rule
change which allows free substitution. It seemed that
Ditlevsen was running in for Armstrong and Norberg
in for Meiners every time I looked up. There was, no
doubt, a lot of deep football strategy connected with
the moves, but still the game dragged miserably.
The new rule also destroys the effectiveness of our
name yells. It used to be that our football giants
played almost all of the game, came out in the last few
minutes, tired, sweaty, covered with mud, and re
ceived an ovation.
Now they run in and out, their suits bright and
clean, and the section gives them yells every time they
run in and out and after the sixth time they run in
and out nobody cai'es if they are in or out, and the
effectiveness is gone.
Gone also are the good old days.

TT WAS in the third quarter of Saturday's game.
Stanford was trailing the "Toreadors" from Ore
gon, 13-12. Things didn't look good. Joe Messina
raised his hands and hollered, "We're gonna do 'er.
We're going to give the Axe yell." There followed an
amazing few minutes. There were boos and cheers
and finally Messina asked for a vote. We actually voted
on whether we should give the axe yell or not.
The axe yell was at first meant to be for the Cali
fornia game only. Then, we broke tradition, and gave
the yell at the U.C.L.A. game because they were
brothers of the Bears, and at the U.S.C. game, be
cause they were our toughest opponent. Last year we
again looked away from tradition during the Washing
ton game, and gave the yell when we were trailing
10-0 late in the third period, and once again in the
Rose Bowl game, when we were behind Nebraska.
I think that we should decide whether we want to
save the yell for the three schools, California, Southern
California and U.C.L.A. as tradition has it, or break
tradition and give the yell at any game, when we feel
that the team needs a psychological lift. Whatever we
do, we shouldn't take a last minute poll of the rooting
section during the games.
