# CAMPUS OPINION
## HUNTINGTON'S PHILLIPIC 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
In the Thursday edition of the Stanford Daily
appeared a direct invitation to the students for con
tributions to the Campus Opinion. On the same page
in an editorial concerning Stanford students and the
draft was a much more stimulating, if less direct, in
vitation to contribute to this column. I am not in the
habit of addressing phillipic epistles to editors; in fact,
this is my first letter to any editor anywhere. But the
hypocrisy of the editorial referred to has disgusted me
to the point of print (if you print this); it is the atti
tude of many of the so-called men around campus but
I hardly expected to see the editor of The Daily try to
take refuge behind such a flimsy and shallow "front"
as he advances in argument against college students
entering military training.
The ill-concealed mercenary, pecuniary, and syba
ritical motives which stand behind the plea of the
Average College Man that we will need college men
for the period of reconstruction, and the charge that
the authorities are blackguards because they actually
encourage college men enlisting instead of employing
every ruse and subterfuge to help them escape military
service, is a disgrace.
Life at Stanford is interesting, easy, or luxurious,
or all three depending upon who you are. As a pleas
ant existence it certainly beats enforced discipline and
the rigors of military life and the dangers of military
combat, and it doesn't muss up our own personal
plans for the future as the latter would. Then why not
have the guts to say as much instead of pretending we
are the flower of the land and that it would be a na
tional calamity if we became soldiers. The idea that
encouraging voluntary enlistment of college students
will work a detriment on society of relatively greater
magnitude than if these enlistees were taken from non
collegians is a lot of poppy-cock.
Any college man who would voluntarily enlist isn't
intelligent enough to solve any major problems of our
post-war period, even if he stayed at Stanford and
got a string of degrees, but he might become a very
good officer or pilot and do at least one service for
his country before going to Valhalla.
I don't like wars, and I don't like military training,
but I hate hypocrisy a damn sight more than either
of these.
I shall be greatly surprised if you publish this, as no
doubt will many others.
Sincerely,
R. S. Huntington

good officer or pilot and do at least one service for
his country before going to Valhalla.
I don't like wars, and I don't like military training,
but I hate hypocrisy a damn sight more than either
of these.
I shall be greatly surprised if you publish this, as no
doubt will many others.

r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
In the Thursday edition of the Stanford Daily
appeared a direct invitation to the students for con
tributions to the Campus Opinion. On the same page
in an editorial concerning Stanford students and the
draft was a much more stimulating, if less direct, in
vitation to contribute to this column. I am not in the
habit of addressing phillipic epistles to editors; in fact,
this is my first letter to any editor anywhere. But the
hypocrisy of the editorial referred to has disgusted me
to the point of print (if you print this); it is the atti
tude of many of the so-called men around campus but
I hardly expected to see the editor of The Daily try to
take refuge behind such a flimsy and shallow "front"
as he advances in argument against college students
entering military training.
The ill-concealed mercenary, pecuniary, and syba
ritical motives which stand behind the plea of the
Average College Man that we will need college men
for the period of reconstruction, and the charge that
the authorities are blackguards because they actually
encourage college men enlisting instead of employing
every ruse and subterfuge to help them escape military
service, is a disgrace.
Life at Stanford is interesting, easy, or luxurious,
or all three depending upon who you are. As a pleas
ant existence it certainly beats enforced discipline and
the rigors of military life and the dangers of military
combat, and it doesn't muss up our own personal
plans for the future as the latter would. Then why not
have the guts to say as much instead of pretending we
are the flower of the land and that it would be a na
tional calamity if we became soldiers. The idea that
encouraging voluntary enlistment of college students
will work a detriment on society of relatively greater
magnitude than if these enlistees were taken from non
collegians is a lot of poppy-cock.
Any college man who would voluntarily enlist isn't
intelligent enough to solve any major problems of our
post-war period, even if he stayed at Stanford and
got a string of degrees, but he might become a very
good officer or pilot and do at least one service for
his country before going to Valhalla.
I don't like wars, and I don't like military training,
but I hate hypocrisy a damn sight more than either
of these.
I shall be greatly surprised if you publish this, as no
