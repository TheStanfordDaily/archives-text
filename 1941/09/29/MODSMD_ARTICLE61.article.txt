"AN OLD CAPTIVITY," by Ncvil Shute, published by William Mor
row and Co.
Ncvil Sluite, in this absorbing fiction novel weaves a tale combining the
realism of an extensive archaeological expedition with the mysticism of
a dream come true.
Although it provides the old familiar love theme, the charm with which

he links modem times with the
is definitely different. The story em
bodies the vicissitudes, of a young
Scottish pilot, Donald Ross, carrying
all the responsibility of a flying ex
pedition to Greenland for a roman
tic, unrealistic archeologist.
LOVE INTEREST
Added trouble is provided by
Alix Lockwood, "bluestocking"
daughter of his employer, who is
fanatically opposed to the expedi
tion, but who finally goes along and
becomes quite human, dissolving her
antagonism for the pilot and finally
frankly admiring him.
Transition from modern to Viking
times is expertly brought about by
reference to Eskimo superstitions
and Ross' consumption of an over
dose of sleeping tablets which cause
him to lapse into a 36-hour coma.
In this state he has a dream which
completely reconstructs the story of
Greenland's past.
LEIF ENSLAVES THEM
He sees himself and Alix as Celts
who are carried off into slavery by
Leif Ericson, and taken on an expe
dition to explore the territory around
Greenland. Descriptions of the lands
which they observed later prove sig
nificant when the party leaves the
island for the northern coast of
Canada.
At this point the trend of the tale
seems a little out of tune with its
aura of strange realism, but the de
sire to see some connection made be
tween heretofore unexplained de
scriptions and the modern charac
ters, when the expendition nears its
end, is satisfied.
Mr. Shute makes excellent use of
his knowledge of the details of the
preparation and successful carrying
out of such an expedition without
exhausting the reader with a host of
technical terms.â€”Craig
