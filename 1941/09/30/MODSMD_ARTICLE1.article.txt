### AMIE REICHERT 
Russia is fighting
the Battle of Democracy.
There were many who realized
and accepted this paradox when the
Soviet was invaded by Germany on
June 22. But thus far all the democ
racies have done is to grasfc) the
Bear firmly by the paw and mutter
huskily, "Glad to have you with us,
old boy."
Yesterday in Moscow some very
important men got together and
talked things over in order to
make sure that Russia will not
continue t«» fight the world's great
battle alone.
When W. Averell Harriman and
Lord Beaverbrook, respective heads
of the U.S. and British military mis
sions, emerged from a two and a
half hour conference with Foreign
Commissar Molotov, they had plenty
to say.
* * *
r made large impressive
statements and uttered fabu
lously reassuring pledges, and on
the surface it looked good and
sounded good, and maybe it was
good.
But the crucial test is yet to be
passed: whether Britain and the
U.S. will be able to translate those
pledges into the only language that
Adolf Hitler understands.
For several months now the Ad
ministration has been up to its
ears in irrefutable, statistically
supported criticism of the U.S. de
fense program.
The facts and figures presented
may vary. But the essential criti
cism is always the same. We are
not producing enough. We are not
sending enough overseas. Some
where along the line the vast net
work of American industries has
snagged and snarled fearfully. The
U.S. defense effort is being garrotted
by internecine jealousies, red tape,
and downright inefficiency.

•" ganization plan which went into
effect last month is supposed to un
tangle things and swell the present
trickle of supplies to Britain into a
flood.
But according to many Washing
ton experts, the creation of the new
Supply, Priorities, Allocations Board
has simply reshuffled the pack
without changing the cards much. It
is still too early to tell what the
effects of the realignment will be
in terms of tanks, planes, and guns.
But there is little doubt that
America's faltering defense pro
gram had better get its second
wind or Russia will be doomed.
British industry is—and has been
for some time—running top speed.
The amount of supplies Great Brit
ain can spare remains the unknown
quantity in the equation. Thus far,
despite Churchill's promises on the
day that Russia was invaded, Brit
ish aid has been paltry.

r | I HE Russians need tanks. But
Britain's tanks were almost all
lost in the Dunkirk evacuation, and
she needs all she can produce plus
what the U.S. can send her.
The Russians need bombers. So
do the British. And here again
American production has fallen
far short of the mark.
Besides these production difficul
ties there are problems of transpor
tation to bo reckoned with. U.S.
merchantmen are ripe game for
Nazi U-boat target practice. But
they are not armed to defend their
cargoes.

A MERICA'S shipbuilding program
was stepped up to six million
tons per year three months ago.
Britain's shipbuilding capacity is
only about a million tons a year.
Britain and Russia are therefore
dependent on flic industries and
ships of America to deliver the
goods. This is the reason the
President is expected (o ask Con
press (o arm merchant ships this
week.
If we are to fulfill our pledges to
Russia, our ships must reach port
with safe cargoes. If we are to win
this war we must deliver the goods.

June 22. But thus far all the democ
racies have done is to grasfc) the
Bear firmly by the paw and mutter
huskily, "Glad to have you with us,
old boy."
Yesterday in Moscow some very
important men got together and
talked things over in order to
make sure that Russia will not
continue t«» fight the world's great
battle alone.
When W. Averell Harriman and
Lord Beaverbrook, respective heads
of the U.S. and British military mis
sions, emerged from a two and a
half hour conference with Foreign
Commissar Molotov, they had plenty
to say.
* * *
r made large impressive
statements and uttered fabu
lously reassuring pledges, and on
the surface it looked good and
sounded good, and maybe it was
good.
But the crucial test is yet to be
passed: whether Britain and the
U.S. will be able to translate those
pledges into the only language that
Adolf Hitler understands.
For several months now the Ad
ministration has been up to its
ears in irrefutable, statistically
supported criticism of the U.S. de
fense program.
The facts and figures presented
may vary. But the essential criti
cism is always the same. We are
not producing enough. We are not
sending enough overseas. Some
where along the line the vast net
work of American industries has
snagged and snarled fearfully. The
U.S. defense effort is being garrotted
by internecine jealousies, red tape,
and downright inefficiency.

JUDGE Samuel Rosenman's reor
•" ganization plan which went into
effect last month is supposed to un
tangle things and swell the present
trickle of supplies to Britain into a
flood.
But according to many Washing
ton experts, the creation of the new
Supply, Priorities, Allocations Board
has simply reshuffled the pack
without changing the cards much. It
is still too early to tell what the
effects of the realignment will be
in terms of tanks, planes, and guns.
But there is little doubt that
America's faltering defense pro
gram had better get its second
wind or Russia will be doomed.
British industry is—and has been
for some time—running top speed.
The amount of supplies Great Brit
ain can spare remains the unknown
quantity in the equation. Thus far,
despite Churchill's promises on the
day that Russia was invaded, Brit
ish aid has been paltry.

r | I HE Russians need tanks. But
Britain's tanks were almost all
lost in the Dunkirk evacuation, and
she needs all she can produce plus
what the U.S. can send her.
The Russians need bombers. So
do the British. And here again
American production has fallen
far short of the mark.
Besides these production difficul
ties there are problems of transpor
tation to bo reckoned with. U.S.
merchantmen are ripe game for
Nazi U-boat target practice. But
they are not armed to defend their
cargoes.

A MERICA'S shipbuilding program
was stepped up to six million
tons per year three months ago.
Britain's shipbuilding capacity is
only about a million tons a year.
Britain and Russia are therefore
dependent on flic industries and
ships of America to deliver the
goods. This is the reason the
President is expected (o ask Con
press (o arm merchant ships this
week.
If we are to fulfill our pledges to
Russia, our ships must reach port
with safe cargoes. If we are to win
this war we must deliver the goods.
