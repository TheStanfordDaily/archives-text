## New Members Meet Tonight; Plan Torch Rally for Thursday 
### 
After four days and over 200 in
terviews, 20 freshman men and
women have been picked to fill the
tryoutee vacancies on Rally Com
mittee, according to an announce
ment released late last night by Pi
Thornton and Micky Levee, co
chairmen of Rally Committee.
Chosen from 213 interviewees who
crowded Room 13 of the Old Un
ion Friday and Monday afternoons,
the new tryoutees are requested to
j attend the regular Rallycom meet
i ing tonight at 7:30 downstairs in the
Women's Clubhouse.
At, the same time the co-chairmen
released the names of six sopho
mores who will occupy yearling po
sitions on the committee. The six,
okayed by Cardinals last night, are:
Polly Phlager, Chico Barman, Pat
George, Don Gallery, John Twitch
ell, and Durwood Howes.
FROSH TRYOUTEES
Freshman tryoutees are: Blossom
j Parke, Kerin Hale, Julie Cromme
lin, Jane Waldrogel, Polly Wilson,
Ewell Sale, Margaret Huston, Callie
Curtis, Bunny Rivers, Joan Pem
berthy.
Ed Conn, Jerry Frank. Jefl Howe,
Mel Schleslinger, Jerry Fine, Bob
Mills, Al Shansky, Bill Hays, Clark
i Hunter, and Clem Turner.
Co - chairman Levee expressed
himself as "very pleased with the
fine qualifications of all the inter
viewees," and pointed out that the
turnout was the largest in Rally
Committee history.
WORK GETS REWARD
He added that the 20 freshmen
have only a tryoutee status on the
committee, and their work this year
will determine which of them will
become regular members next year.
The six sophomores are classified as
members of Rally Committee proper.
Tryouts this year were held at an
unusually early date because of the
Fiftieth Anniversary celebration
this week-end. Excluding the Big
Game program in November, the
rally Thursday night and the be
tween-halves events on Saturday
will be the largest of the season.
TORCH RALLY
According to Levee, Thursday's
pep rally will be held in the Frost
Memorial Amphitheater, and will be
a torch rally, "if we can find any
torches."
The new members will be put to
work immediately on card stunts
and other work, which would ordi
narily not have been necessary until
much later in the season.
