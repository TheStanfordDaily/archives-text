WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (UP).â€”
Deportation of Harry R. Bridges,
West Coast CIO director, was rec
ommended today by Judge Charles
B .Sears, special Justice Department
examiner, on the ground that the
Australian-born labor leader has
been affiliated with the Communist
party, "which advocates the over
throw by force and violence" of the
United States government.
Sears reported that in many in
stances since 1932 Bridges' views and
conduct were not only strikingly
similar, but were actually the same
as the conduct and views espoused
by the Communist party.
