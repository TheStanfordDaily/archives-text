# Chappie Co-Chairmen To Scintillate In S.F.
## 
### AL HAMPSON 
Five hundred self-appointed co-chairmen of the Hammer and Coffin's
50th anniversary party will meet at the Press Club in San Francisco
October 11.
Only alumni from the Stanford chapter of the Hammer and Collin, na
tional honorary humor society, will be invited to this dinner.

The Chaparral was published be-,
fore its owner, the Hammer and
Collin Society, was founded. In fact,
this society was founded the night
before the San Francisco earthquake
in a Menlo entertainment hall. The
members of H. and C. strongly be
lieve that the forming of this society
was the sole reason for the earth
quake and place little or no faith in
the earth shrinkage theory.
Among the famous alumni who
it is hoped will attend the party are
Wi'l Irwin, nationally known au
thor; Bruce Bliven, editor of the
New Republic; Feg Murray, na
tionally famed newspaper artist, and
Winston Norman, another of H. &
C.ss notables and a chief pretender
to the throne Thursday night.
Trouble is expected by the Press
! Club, where the meeting is to be
held. "I can't plan anything," the
Press Club steward stated today.
"Who's going to eat, and how many?
How can we arrange a la ere tan
quet in which everyone sits at the
head of the table? Otherwise they
refuse to eat." All plans for the
function, the largest in 11. & C.'s
history, are in similarly chaotic con
dition.
