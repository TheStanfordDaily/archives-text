v/ilh blind staggers, and Louis rodt
in for the kill, following up his ad
vantage with a*flurry of lefts tc

whiskers and Louis drove him intc
a neutral corner with lightning lefts

kind of a fight.
After five rounds of slow, delib
erate stalking, feeling Nova out. the
champion blasted a right-hand
.smash to Nova's chin, and that was
the end of the Bomber's last oppo
nent for a long time.
LOUIS TO ARMY
Joe Louis can now become Joe
Palooka, starting out with a clean
slate for Uncle Sam. He expects to
be called early next month.
Nova's highly touted "cosmic"
punch lost its "s," and he looked in
deed like a wild man out of the
funny papers.
Nova took the first two rounds,
though both men were slow in get
ting started. After feinting two or
three times, Nova began jabbing
lightly with lefts and brought
around a haymaker which missed a
mile.
Louis shook Nova in a fast ex
change midway in the round, and
they traded lefts as the round
ended.
EVEN-STEVEN
In the second round Nova jabbed
Louis wilh a left to the nose and
missed a hard right. Louis countered
with a left to Nova's probascis.
Both had great respect for each
other, and Nova landed two lefts and
a right to the face as the round
closed.
Louis came out cool and safe as a
defense bond in the third, advancing
cautiously toward his opponent. He
planted a left and a right to Nova's
face but Nova came back with a
right to Louis' midsection.
Louis waded in a bit and got the
better of Nova in close. It was the
Bomber's round.
LOUIS GOES IN
Louis took the fourth by a wide
margin, clubbing Nova with sharp
lefts and rights to the head. He
landed ten blows in a row to Nova's
head, but Ihe challenger rode the
punches and kept his feet.
Nova was still strong as he came
out for the fifth. They traded lefts,
and Louis' left jab caught Nova on
(he end of the nose and the blood
trickled. Louis landed a hard one
two punch to the head. It was a
dull round with Louis much the
better.
I hoy came out for the sixth and
the champion rocked Nova with a
left hook to the head.
T.K.O. PUNCH
Suddenly I -iouis shot across a light
ning right cross to Nova's jaw and
sent him sliding under the ropes and
out of the. ring.
Nova was up at the count of nine,
still game, but Louis tore after him,
hammering him as Nova stood up
and took the punches, offering no
comeback. Nova staggered drunk
cnly, and the referee ended the fight.
Brashly, Nova attempted to out
box the champion instead of chanc
ing a slugging offensive from the
.'■tart. But Louis lay back, measured
Nova in the sixth, and exploded his
rh'ht to Nova chin.
Sixty thousand fans, largest
c wd ever to attend a fight at the
I'< '•> Grounds, paid an estimated
•SO'Ki.OOO to see Louis defend ihe title.
