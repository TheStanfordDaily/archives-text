just must be used to it. Otherwise Mesdames Shaughnessy,
Schwartz, Bengtson, and Lawson, '"fall widows," all, would surely
organize and protect that football is unfair to the wives of coaches.
Just before the season starts each of the wives must go to their hus
bands and say something like this:
"Well, football season is about to start. Goodbye for now, dear. I'll
see you next December."
We all know that Stanford's gridiron stalwarts work like the very
dickens in preparation for their games each Saturday. But what a
hit of us do not realize is how hard Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his
aides, Marchy Schwartz, Phil Bengtson, and Jim Lawson, labor to
get ready to get the Indians ready for those games.
Shaughnessy isn't just another football coach; we all know that. Win
or lose, he's different. The man who holds the reigns on Stanford's foot
ball destinies has one big kick about the set-up in this world: the days
are not long enough. When he sleeps is a mystery. Football is his life.
We've never,seen a man who was so completely wrapped up in the game.
We'd be willing to bet that if Shaughnessy were walking along the
sidewalk thinking intently about football, he could pass right by his best
friend without knowing it, if that friend did not speak first. When that
man concentrates, he really CON-

CENTRATES. That's a facility that
makes geniuses, and he is a football
genius. To sport fans he'll keep on
being a genius until his teams start
to lose; to us he'll ALWAYS be one
of the greatest grid coaches of all
time.
Because the Indian head man is
no respecter of time, his assist
ants are gradually getting to be
the same way. They never know
when they might be called to
wcrk, and once they're in the of
fice marked "Football Coaches,"
they never know when they'll
leave.
Sunday is usually a day of rest,
and after sweating through Satur
day's game, you'd think the Card
coaching staff would take advantage
of the holiday to play with their re
spective children or just lie around
their respective homes. Such was
not the case. Shaughnessy, Bengt
son, Lawson, and Schwartz were all
parked in Kezar Stadium, watching
Santa Clara tee off on the University

of San Francisco. The Redshirts play both of Ihese teams later in the
season, U.S.F. on Oct.'lB and the Broncs on Nov. 1.
Ihe Sunday belore last it was even worse (or better, depending on
which way you look at it). At 8 o'clock in the morning, while most of us
were still pounding the pillow in no uncertain manner, the coaching staff
met at the Shaughnessy residence, went into a session, and didn't call it
quits until 11:30 p.m. That was a comparatively easy day, though. They
did take time out to eat.

QNE morning when Coach Clark called his aides to one of the usual
6:30 a.m. meetings at the aforementioned Shaughnessy home, the boys
had a little laugh to start things off. Handsome Phil Bengtson had dressed
in the dark in order to keep from awakening his wife at half-past five.
When he sat down at the meeting and pulled up his trousers to keep them
from getting baggy in the knees, someone noticed something awry. He
had on one blue sock and one green one.
There was another Sunday morning during the summer, however,
when the coaches had it easy. There was no meeting. And the
Schwartz family in particular was preparing for a real day of rest.
But Johnny-Rob and Mary Jane, (he three-year-old Schwartz twins,
had other ideas.
It seems that before Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz had arisen, the twins started
out to see what was cooking. Well, we don't know if anything was ac
tually cooking or not, but it can be reported that Marchie's face was a
little red and that certain parts of the anatomy of the twins were the same,
soon after Marchie, on a hunt for his two missing children, discovered
them about a block from home. Oh, they were having a great time. It
wasn t bad when they threw a couple of decks of playing cards into the
neighbor's fish pond. But the fact that they had neglected to put on any
clothes before starting on their escapade was just a little too much.

BROWNELL, Stanford's number one golfer, is enrolled in school
and will probably be around to do his bit for Coach Eddie Twiggs'
team in the summer of 1942 when that outfit attempts to defend the na
tional intercollegiate title it won this past summer.
And, best of all, Twiggs is of the opinion that his boys have the stuff to
come through again, at least as long as Brownell is in there playing for
Stanford. He's counting on the Carmel boy and Frank Tatum to carry
the greater part of the load and on George Traphagen, Frank MeCann,
and Jack Wilson, all sophomores, to fill the vacancies left by Captain
Warren Berl, Bud Finger, Dee Replogle, and Gordon Hough.

A sports desk, we find notes to the
effect that:
Corky Donahue, who played guard
and tackle for Stanford when Tiny
Thornhill was coaching here, is now
gridding for pay for the Honolulu
Bears. . . . Ucla's Jackie Robinson is
on the same outfit. . . . Bernie Mas
terson, whom Shaughnessy brought
to the Farm in the spring of 1940
to help install the T formation, was
in the press box at the Indian-Duck

football coach at U.C.L.A.
