# Those Brooklyns Have Power Too; Whitlow Wyatt Faces Red Ruffing
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
A National League champion that can swap extra bases for extra bases
with the mighty Yanks. For the first time in years we don't have to talk
about power against pitching and defense.
We can sit hack and watch TWO great slugging aggregations battle it
out. We don't have to look into the fielding and earned-run averages to

•♦find something nice to say about the
I representative of the senior circuit.
YANKS GET THEIRS
A glance at the Brooklyn line-up
and you can see that the Yanks are
going to get plenty of their own
medicine, namely slugging. Dolf
Camilli has hit more home runs
than any man on the New York
squad. Pete Reiser led the league
in hitting with .343 and in doubles
and triples. The 4 other two men in
the outfield, Ducky Medwick and
Dixie Walker, hit well over .300 and
Walker, the most popular player on
the team, is famed for clutch hit
ting.
Cookie Lavagetto and Billy Her
man make a specialty of extra-base
hitting. Fans remember Herman as
j the man who led the league in
j doubles year after year when he
j wore a Cub uniform. Another ex-
Chicagoan, Augie Galan, succeeds
Chubbie Dean as the pinch-hitter of
j (he year. Aug kindled three vital
last-minute rallies as the Brooks
came down the stretch.
This year the scribes have even
dared to mention that the Yanks, of
all teams, are a great defensive out
fit, a bouquet that used to be re
served for the Reds.
DUROCIIFR TO ACT
Lippy Leo Durocher senses the
greatness of this year's world se
ries. He is going to sacrifice added
power against left-handers by leav
ing Lavagetto in the line-up. In the
stretch drive Lew Riggs played
third when everyone threw south
paws at the Brooks; but to start
with anyway, Durocher is going to
string along with Lavagetto on the
hot corner, for Cookie is colorful
and the idol of Dodger fans.
Ducky Medwick stays in the out
field instead of Jim Wasdell, and
Durocher is probably going to start
I Whit Wyatt against the venerable
Red Ruffing. This gives the Dodg
| ers their complete first string.
But you can't get away from that
j Yank outfield. Joe DiMaggio, Char
j ley Keller, and Tommy Henrich all
! hit over 30 home runs for New York
[ with Jolting Joe and King Kong
driving in almost 250 runs between
i them, a remarkable feat.
It will take great pitching by Ruf
: fing, Wyatt, Higme, Gomez, et al to
keep this year's series from being a
! slugfest.
