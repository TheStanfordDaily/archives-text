# Varsity Rests While Reserves Polish Offense
## 
### 
With only Hoot Armstrong out of
suit the first string varsity gridders
relaxed yesterday afternoon while [
the second and third stringers pol- |
ished up on their offenses in a scrim
mage against the frosh in prcpara- ;
tion for Saturday's game with the
"Q-T" of U.C.L.A.
Pete Kmetovic and Ken Robesky,
both of whom received minor in- !
juries in last week-end's successful
encounter with Oregon, were work- j
ing out with their fellow regulars
with apparently no ill effects.
LaPrade, Taylor, Banducci, Lind
skog, Stamm, Meiners, Meyer, Nor
berg, Vucinich, and Albert limbered j
up with a little kicking, passing, etc.,
alter their stiff afternoon's work i
Saturday.
Coach Shaughnessy was in a very
cheery mood as his shock troopers
pushed aside the frosh, scoring nu
merous touchdowns. Sheller, Faw- J
cett, and Mitchell were the offensive j
big guns. Two backfields alternated
for the varsity. The one which was j
not on offense backed up the frosh !
line on defense.
Visitors at the practice were the
Jim Reynoldses, Big and Little.
Big Jim is Stanford booster No. 1,
while Little Jim was student body
president and shot-putter a few
years back.
