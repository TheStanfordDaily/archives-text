# The 						Part We Play
## 
### 
V\T ATE urge war and in so doing we know
VY that some of us won't come back."
These are the words of the editor of The Daily
Pennsylvanian. They are courageous words and
probably express the sentiments of the majority
of Pennsylvania's more than 8,000 students.
Opinion in the East as evidenced by many
of the college papers is much more concrete,
more fully moulded than is student opinion here
on the Coast.
Endorsement of President Roosevelt's policies
is more whole-hearted.
Though out here we are theoretically as close
through the methodical clicking of teletypes,
the flash of newsreels, and the radio to the
nerve-centers of our government and most of
our defense industry. Theoretically we are as
close to the ship sinkings in the Atlantic.
But there still remains the fact that there are
three thousand miles of plains, mountains, and
deserts separating us from the east coast. De
spite the fact that we have Japan on the other
side of our Pacific as a much-ballyhooed men
ace, we are still inclined to worry a litle less, to
take international developments a little less
seriously than our Eastern relatives.
Despite blaring headlines, the real implica
tions of world shaking international happenings
hit the Pacific a little behind the East and thus
allow us to observe them a little more objec
tively.
We are all part of one sovereign nation and
must sooner or later face the question of what
part we, as the world's greatest democracy, are
to play in the eventually necessary defeat of
Hitler and the readjustment of the society of
nations.
We are now involved to the extent that we
are supplying the tools of war in increasing
amounts to England and Russia. Our men are
stationed in Iceland, a scant 700 miles—the dis
tance between Stanford and Portland, Oregon—
from Glasgow, capital of Scotland.
We are patrolling the seas between this
country and Iceland with orders to "sink on
sight" any enemy raider or submarine.
To protect the materials we are shipping to
England we will soon be arming our merchant
ships and probably convoying ships across the
Atlantic. Right now this is the way we can best
help to win this war.
They do not need our army. They are having
a hard enough time keeping up the morale of
the Canadian soldiers in England. They are
even shipping some of them back to Canada
since they can find nothing for them to do.
The Daily does not take the same viewpoint
as The Daily Pennsylvanian—that of urging
war. It is our opinion that this country's part
can best be played by speeding up our own
national defense, legally repealing the restrict
ing Neutrality Act, increasing our aid to Britain,
controlling the strikes tying up our industries,
and generally following the broad outline of
policy formulated by the administration.
We should not jump into a war for which we
are not yet prepared, and in which we are not
yet needed, but we should be ready to play
our part when the time comes.

V\T ATE urge war and in so doing we know
VY that some of us won't come back."
These are the words of the editor of The Daily
Pennsylvanian. They are courageous words and
probably express the sentiments of the majority
of Pennsylvania's more than 8,000 students.
Opinion in the East as evidenced by many
of the college papers is much more concrete,
more fully moulded than is student opinion here
on the Coast.
Endorsement of President Roosevelt's policies
is more whole-hearted.
Though out here we are theoretically as close
through the methodical clicking of teletypes,
the flash of newsreels, and the radio to the
nerve-centers of our government and most of
our defense industry. Theoretically we are as
close to the ship sinkings in the Atlantic.
But there still remains the fact that there are
three thousand miles of plains, mountains, and
deserts separating us from the east coast. De
spite the fact that we have Japan on the other
side of our Pacific as a much-ballyhooed men
ace, we are still inclined to worry a litle less, to
take international developments a little less
seriously than our Eastern relatives.
Despite blaring headlines, the real implica
tions of world shaking international happenings
hit the Pacific a little behind the East and thus
allow us to observe them a little more objec
tively.
We are all part of one sovereign nation and
must sooner or later face the question of what
part we, as the world's greatest democracy, are
to play in the eventually necessary defeat of
Hitler and the readjustment of the society of
nations.
We are now involved to the extent that we
are supplying the tools of war in increasing
amounts to England and Russia. Our men are
stationed in Iceland, a scant 700 miles—the dis
tance between Stanford and Portland, Oregon—
from Glasgow, capital of Scotland.
We are patrolling the seas between this
country and Iceland with orders to "sink on
sight" any enemy raider or submarine.
To protect the materials we are shipping to
England we will soon be arming our merchant
ships and probably convoying ships across the
Atlantic. Right now this is the way we can best
help to win this war.
They do not need our army. They are having
a hard enough time keeping up the morale of
the Canadian soldiers in England. They are
even shipping some of them back to Canada
since they can find nothing for them to do.
The Daily does not take the same viewpoint
as The Daily Pennsylvanian—that of urging
war. It is our opinion that this country's part
can best be played by speeding up our own
national defense, legally repealing the restrict
ing Neutrality Act, increasing our aid to Britain,
controlling the strikes tying up our industries,
and generally following the broad outline of
policy formulated by the administration.
We should not jump into a war for which we
are not yet prepared, and in which we are not
yet needed, but we should be ready to play
our part when the time comes.
