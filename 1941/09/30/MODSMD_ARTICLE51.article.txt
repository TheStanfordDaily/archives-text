r PHEY knew him as "Dad."
JL And it is by this affectionate name that
thousands of his students and colleagues will
forever cherish the memory of the late Ellwood
Patterson Cubberly, who died at his campus
home September 14.
During his 43 years at Stanford he was Ex
ecutive Head, Dean and Emeritus Dean of the
School of Education.
It was Dr. Cubberley, who, unlike the average
modestly paid professor, amassed a fortune by
writing and editing books and investing royal
ties. In 1933 "Dad" strolled into the office of
the President of the University and plunked
down what he called a "pin money" contribu
tion of $548,000.
The magnitude of his gift astounded the pub
lic, for it was hard to believe that a college pro
fessor could have saved such a sum of money
in an academic occupation.
We will always be grateful to him for the
beautiful School of Education Building, an in
valuable addition to the campus, which repre
sents the greater part of his life's savings.
But for "Dad," this "gesture" was not great
enough. In addition to the new building, he
donated $50,000 more to purchase books for
the library. To this he added his own private
collection. His widow, Mrs. Helen Cubberley,
shared in his donations.
His modesty dictated that the building erected
with the money representing his life's work be
called the "Education Building," instead of the
"Cubberley Building "

Du/ing his career he authored 18 books and
6 school surveys and edited over 100 volumes
of the famed Riverside Textbooks in Education.
In the Cubberley Booklet, the Cubberley Na
tional Committee states, "The Riverside Series
have exerted an enormous influence in directing
the reading, in shaping the thinking, and in
raising the general level and the professional
outlook of tens of thousands of teachers and
school administrators in all parts of the coun
try."
Perhaps his three most significant contribu
tions to the field of education are:
1. Development of the study of the history
of education.
2. Organization and development of state
school administration, which has been widely
influential throughout the United States.
3. Development of city school administration.
Countless cities in California and in other parts
of the country have superintendents trained
under Dr. Cubberley.
To Dean Emeritus Ellwood Patterson Cub
berley, teacher, administrator, author, and edi
tor, for his leadership and his magnanimity:
Thanks, "Dad."—Harold Shafer»
