## MONEY AND THE PEOPLE 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
'OULD we talk for a while about economics and
such things. A couple of years ago factories had
shut down, men were thrown out of work, people were
starving all over the place. Conditions generally were
pretty terrible. President Roosevelt asked Congress
for large sums of money, to try to straighten things
out. Immediately congressmen, Republicans, bankers,
economists and others started shouting that if any
more money was spent, if our national debt was in
creased, our whole economic structure would come
tumbling down, and the world would slowly come to
an end.
Today, we are spilling money all over the place.
Not for food, not for clothing, not for warmth, not for
shelter, but for guns, tanks, planes and bombs. We
are spending money not for humanity, but for the
destruction of humanity.
* * * *
JTF IT is possible to spend so much money during
war time, then I should believe that the same
thing could be done during peace time, if it was
really necessary. To say, No, we can't give the poor
food and clothes and shelter, because if we do we
will ruin our economic system, would be to place our
system over our people. And that would destroy the
purpose of our system, for it was created to serve
the people.
I don t see how this country can go bankrupt no
matter how many billions it owes itself, as long as
there are fertile lands, seeds to plant, water and air
and workers, factories, and far-sighted, intelligent men.
There should always be plenty of these in this country.
>!< * * *
most of the country has forgotten about
budgets and their balancing, alert city officials of
Muskogee, Oklahoma, are aware of the danger and
are taking steps to put their city budget in order. I
quote from a United Press dispatch that came over
the wire the other day:
"This city of persons was in a furor to
night over the proposal of the city council to place
a tax of 25 cents each month on all toilet seats.
"City officials estimated the tax would raise ap
proximately 540,00<) annually, enough to balance the
city budget. Opponents of the tax said it was 'dis
criminatory' and called it a 'privvy penalty.'
'Sponsors of the plan forget,' said one man, 'that
a man's home is his castle.' "
You can see how far this idea of placing the system
above the people can be carried.

will ruin our economic system, would be to place our
system over our people. And that would destroy the
purpose of our system, for it was created to serve
the people.
I don t see how this country can go bankrupt no
matter how many billions it owes itself, as long as
there are fertile lands, seeds to plant, water and air
and workers, factories, and far-sighted, intelligent men.
There should always be plenty of these in this country.

most of the country has forgotten about
budgets and their balancing, alert city officials of
Muskogee, Oklahoma, are aware of the danger and
are taking steps to put their city budget in order. I
quote from a United Press dispatch that came over
the wire the other day:
"This city of persons was in a furor to
night over the proposal of the city council to place
a tax of 25 cents each month on all toilet seats.
"City officials estimated the tax would raise ap
proximately 540,00<) annually, enough to balance the
city budget. Opponents of the tax said it was 'dis
criminatory' and called it a 'privvy penalty.'
'Sponsors of the plan forget,' said one man, 'that
a man's home is his castle.' "
You can see how far this idea of placing the system
above the people can be carried.
'OULD we talk for a while about economics and
such things. A couple of years ago factories had
shut down, men were thrown out of work, people were
starving all over the place. Conditions generally were
pretty terrible. President Roosevelt asked Congress
for large sums of money, to try to straighten things
out. Immediately congressmen, Republicans, bankers,
economists and others started shouting that if any
more money was spent, if our national debt was in
creased, our whole economic structure would come
tumbling down, and the world would slowly come to
an end.
Today, we are spilling money all over the place.
Not for food, not for clothing, not for warmth, not for
shelter, but for guns, tanks, planes and bombs. We
are spending money not for humanity, but for the
destruction of humanity.

JTF IT is possible to spend so much money during
war time, then I should believe that the same
thing could be done during peace time, if it was
really necessary. To say, No, we can't give the poor
food and clothes and shelter, because if we do we
will ruin our economic system, would be to place our
system over our people. And that would destroy the
purpose of our system, for it was created to serve
the people.
