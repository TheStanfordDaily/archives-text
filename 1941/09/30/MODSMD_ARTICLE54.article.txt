## GRIDIRON COURTESY

EDITOR, SIR:
I should like to call to your attention a very
unfortunate occurrance which took place at last Sat
urday's football game. After the Stanford rooters had
torn across the field to cheer their team and to sing
the hymn, the Oregon section expressed a wish to
sing their alma mater.
Hardly had they begun when our band broke
smartly into "Sons of the Stanford Red" and marched
off the field, drowning out our visitors, who inciden
tally kept right on singing. This breach of manners
was extremely painful to those of us who witnessed
it, and must have been doubly so to our opponents
who had consistently proved themselves to be good
sports. The remedy for such a situation is quite sim
ple; why not have the band leader take his directions
from Messina and thus avoid a repetition of this re
grettable incident?
Unhappy
(Mild criticism for such a broach of sports
manship.—The Editor.)
