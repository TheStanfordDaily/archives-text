# GALLUPING FIGURES

### 
r pHE EDITOR. SIR:
Attention, Mr. Silverman.
A recent Gallup Poll shows that 83 per rent of the
American people are against this country's entry into
the European War.
The isolationist, group led by Charles Lindbergh
and Senator Wheeler has one goal and one goal only
—to keep this country out of war.
You call for national unity. When the country is
divided 83 per cent against 17 per cent, is it not ab
surd to ask the minority to give in to the overwhelm
ing majority in order to create unity?
Thank you,
Isolationist
(Any normal man, if you went lip to him and
asked him point blank, "Do you want to go to
war?" would say no. We do not want to go to
war. Rut when the situation is such that our na
tional interest will he best served by aiding ag
gressor victims in whatever way we possibly can
that is what we should do. The question is not one
of "war" or "no war," it is one of national self
preservation. For this unity is necessary.—The
Editor
