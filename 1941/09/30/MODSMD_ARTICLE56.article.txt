# Star-Studded Comedy Bogs Down in Middle
## 
### 
"WHEN LA I) IMS MEET," now showing at the Fox-Stanford Theater
in Palo Alto.
MGM has girded up its loins and once more has launched itself into
another of those star-studded drawing room comedies which features one
Miss Joan Crawford. 4

As the glamorous authoress in
love with her publisher, played by
Herbert Marshall, Miss Crawford
outdoes herself in denoting her lit
erary proclivities by speaking with a
broad "a" and wearing large horn
rimmed spectacles.
Her ever-faithful Robert Taylor
springs about the screen in a deter
mined, spritely manner and gener
ally proves himself to be a thor
oughly annoying personality.
GARSON OUTSTANDING
Outstanding in the role of mum
bly-voiced Mr. Marshall's long-suf
fering wife is Greer Garson, who
picks up the picture and carries it
away in her charming pocket.
Taken from Rachel Crothers' play
of many seasons ago, "When Ladies
Meet" suffers from the earnest at
tempt of the producers to retain as
many of the author's smart, brittle
lines as possible with a few extra
thrown in for good measure. Con
sequently, it bogs down in the middle
and becomes a long, tedious affair
at best.
However, there are many bright
spots, mainly contributed by Spring
Byington, who plays Bridgie, the
role she created in the original
Broadway production. But the
whole thing drips with pseudo-so
phistication and Hollywood's idea of
high society.
SETTINGS GOOD
Those who remember the original
movie version of some years back,
starring Ann Harding, Myrna Loy,
Robert Montgomery, and Alice
Brady will find this new treatment
completely lacking in the adeptness
and restraint of the older film. They
will not, however, be disappointed
in Cedric Gibbons' charming set
tings which, in themselves, almost
justify making the picture.
The companion features is "Whis
tling in the Dark," which claims to
be taken from the play of the same
name that starred Ernest Truex. In
the leading role is MGM's Bob
Hope of the future, Red Skelton.
The studio seems to be quite excited
about this young man, and though
we cannot say the same, he has a
certain smoothness of delivery that
might develop into something with
a little more polishing. Also in the
cast was Conrad Veidt. We don't
know why.—Livingston

of many seasons ago, "When Ladies
Meet" suffers from the earnest at
tempt of the producers to retain as
many of the author's smart, brittle
lines as possible with a few extra
thrown in for good measure. Con
sequently, it bogs down in the middle
and becomes a long, tedious affair
at best.
However, there are many bright
spots, mainly contributed by Spring
Byington, who plays Bridgie, the
role she created in the original
Broadway production. But the
whole thing drips with pseudo-so
phistication and Hollywood's idea of
high society.
SETTINGS GOOD
Those who remember the original
movie version of some years back,
starring Ann Harding, Myrna Loy,
Robert Montgomery, and Alice
Brady will find this new treatment
completely lacking in the adeptness
and restraint of the older film. They
will not, however, be disappointed
in Cedric Gibbons' charming set
tings which, in themselves, almost
justify making the picture.
The companion features is "Whis
tling in the Dark," which claims to
be taken from the play of the same
name that starred Ernest Truex. In
the leading role is MGM's Bob
Hope of the future, Red Skelton.
The studio seems to be quite excited
about this young man, and though
we cannot say the same, he has a
certain smoothness of delivery that
might develop into something with
a little more polishing. Also in the
cast was Conrad Veidt. We don't
know why.—Livingston
"WHEN LA I) IMS MEET," now showing at the Fox-Stanford Theater
in Palo Alto.
MGM has girded up its loins and once more has launched itself into
another of those star-studded drawing room comedies which features one
Miss Joan Crawford. 4

As the glamorous authoress in
love with her publisher, played by
Herbert Marshall, Miss Crawford
outdoes herself in denoting her lit
erary proclivities by speaking with a
broad "a" and wearing large horn
rimmed spectacles.
Her ever-faithful Robert Taylor
springs about the screen in a deter
mined, spritely manner and gener
ally proves himself to be a thor
oughly annoying personality.
GARSON OUTSTANDING
Outstanding in the role of mum
bly-voiced Mr. Marshall's long-suf
fering wife is Greer Garson, who
picks up the picture and carries it
away in her charming pocket.
