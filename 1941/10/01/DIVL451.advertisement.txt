A suggestion from
MAXINE
KELLOG
In the past we have felt
badly because we could
not accommodate all the
students who have wanted
to give pictures for Christ
mas gifts. As we give each
photograph personal su
pervision there is natu
rally a limit as to the num
ber we can take. Last year
we had to stop taking pic
tures about the first of
December because it was
impossible to get them all
finished for Christmas.
As the fall program is
still young we are sug
gesting to those who wish
pictures, to come in and
make arrangements soon.
This means that we can
do our part; the photo
graphs can be called for
either now or later; and
IheChristmas surprisecan
still be kept a secret.
We have enjoyed work
ing with the students for
many years and hope that
in this way we will be able
1o assist more of them.
