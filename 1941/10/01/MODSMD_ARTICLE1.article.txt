yV/lIICH France is the United
States backing?
For some weeks now a contro
versy of no little importance has
occupied the editorial columns of the
nation's leading publications.
Liberal newspapers and maga
zines have been almost unani
mously redundant in their com
plaint that the Administration is
being neither just nor politic in
omitting the name of Free France
from the list of Lend Lease bene
ficiaries.
The arguments are many. But
they are all variations on the same
theme.
What are the facts in the case?
» * *
/GENERAL Charles De Gaulle,
9 leader of the Free French forces,
has brought back over one-third of
France's colonial empire into the
war against Germany since the fall
of the Republic.
He commands more than 50,000
French and Colonial troops in
Equatorial Africa and the Middle
East, lie has at liis disposal some
1.200 pilots, 99 merchant ships, and
21 warships and auxiliary craft—
which constitute about a quarter
of France's pre-war naval tonnage.
As the symbol of fallen France's
hopes and the commander-in-chief
of Free Frenchmen, he has set up a
ruling body known as the Council
of Defense of the Free French Em
pire which supervises the activities
of ten million people and a million
and a quarter square miles of ter
ritory.
* * *
HAS been recognized by
Churchill and the British gov
ernment as the leader of Free
France, and it has been argued by
many that he is the head of a de
facto government carrying out all
the functions peculiar to ruling in
stitutions.
He is unalterably committed to
the scourging of Adolf Hitler and
Nazi Germany, and is therefore
an ally of Britain, the U.S., and
Russia.
Why then has he not been aided
materially by supplies from the
United States?
There are important facts involved
here too.
* * *
Maxime Weygand,
commander-in-chief of the Af
rican Vichy France forces, is a man
whose loyalty to Petain is tempered
by a smouldering antipathy toward
Adolf Hitler, but whose love of
France and freedom is considerably
watered by a violent and unrelent
ing hatred of Charles De Gaulle".
Weygand's North African Army
controls West Africa (including the
strategic port of Dakar), Madagas
car, and the West Indies.
In the Battle of the Atlantic, the
control of Africa's west coast will
be increasingly important. This
territory is far more important to
British and U.S. defenses than
anything Charles De Gaulle holds
in Equatorial Africa.
The experts are saying now that
in October the African theater will
become the scene of a critical phase
of the Battle of the Atlantic.

''JMIERE are three possible Nazi of
fensives which may shape up
within the next month or so. (1) A
drive from Libya and possibly the
Middle East and Turkey down to
Egypt and the Suez. (2) A south
ward sweep from Libya to Free
French and British South Africa.
(3) An expedition from Spain and
Spanish Morocco across Weygand's
Morocco and West Africa to Dakar.
The last offensive would consti
tute the greatest threat to the U.S.
It would put the Germans much
closer to the vital South American
continent.
The theory advanced then is this:
The U.S. government is still
holding onto the cob-web-thin
hope that Weygand will resist
Nazi occupation of northwest Af
rica. As long as this hope exists,
it would be highly imprudent for
this government to antagonize the
precariously-poised loyalties of
Weygand by helping De Gaulc, the
man he hates most.
So the U.S. is biding its time on
this issue and watching and waiting.
Another theory—take it or leave it.

/GENERAL Charles De Gaulle,
9 leader of the Free French forces,
has brought back over one-third of
France's colonial empire into the
war against Germany since the fall
of the Republic.
He commands more than 50,000
French and Colonial troops in
Equatorial Africa and the Middle
East, lie has at liis disposal some
1.200 pilots, 99 merchant ships, and
21 warships and auxiliary craft—
which constitute about a quarter
of France's pre-war naval tonnage.
As the symbol of fallen France's
hopes and the commander-in-chief
of Free Frenchmen, he has set up a
ruling body known as the Council
of Defense of the Free French Em
pire which supervises the activities
of ten million people and a million
and a quarter square miles of ter
ritory.
* * *
HAS been recognized by
Churchill and the British gov
ernment as the leader of Free
France, and it has been argued by
many that he is the head of a de
facto government carrying out all
the functions peculiar to ruling in
stitutions.
He is unalterably committed to
the scourging of Adolf Hitler and
Nazi Germany, and is therefore
an ally of Britain, the U.S., and
Russia.
Why then has he not been aided
materially by supplies from the
United States?
There are important facts involved
here too.
* * *
Maxime Weygand,
commander-in-chief of the Af
rican Vichy France forces, is a man
whose loyalty to Petain is tempered
by a smouldering antipathy toward
Adolf Hitler, but whose love of
France and freedom is considerably
watered by a violent and unrelent
ing hatred of Charles De Gaulle".
Weygand's North African Army
controls West Africa (including the
strategic port of Dakar), Madagas
car, and the West Indies.
In the Battle of the Atlantic, the
control of Africa's west coast will
be increasingly important. This
territory is far more important to
British and U.S. defenses than
anything Charles De Gaulle holds
in Equatorial Africa.
The experts are saying now that
in October the African theater will
become the scene of a critical phase
of the Battle of the Atlantic.

''JMIERE are three possible Nazi of
fensives which may shape up
within the next month or so. (1) A
drive from Libya and possibly the
Middle East and Turkey down to
Egypt and the Suez. (2) A south
ward sweep from Libya to Free
French and British South Africa.
(3) An expedition from Spain and
Spanish Morocco across Weygand's
Morocco and West Africa to Dakar.
The last offensive would consti
tute the greatest threat to the U.S.
It would put the Germans much
closer to the vital South American
continent.
The theory advanced then is this:
The U.S. government is still
holding onto the cob-web-thin
hope that Weygand will resist
Nazi occupation of northwest Af

it would be highly imprudent for
this government to antagonize the
precariously-poised loyalties of
Weygand by helping De Gaulc, the

hopes and the commander-in-chief
of Free Frenchmen, he has set up a

and a quarter square miles of ter

HAS been recognized by
Churchill and the British gov
ernment as the leader of Free
France, and it has been argued by
many that he is the head of a de
facto government carrying out all
the functions peculiar to ruling in
stitutions.
He is unalterably committed to
the scourging of Adolf Hitler and
Nazi Germany, and is therefore
an ally of Britain, the U.S., and
Russia.
Why then has he not been aided
materially by supplies from the
United States?
There are important facts involved
here too.

Maxime Weygand,
commander-in-chief of the Af
rican Vichy France forces, is a man
whose loyalty to Petain is tempered
by a smouldering antipathy toward
Adolf Hitler, but whose love of
France and freedom is considerably
watered by a violent and unrelent
ing hatred of Charles De Gaulle".
Weygand's North African Army
controls West Africa (including the
strategic port of Dakar), Madagas
car, and the West Indies.
In the Battle of the Atlantic, the
control of Africa's west coast will
be increasingly important. This
territory is far more important to
British and U.S. defenses than
anything Charles De Gaulle holds
in Equatorial Africa.
The experts are saying now that
in October the African theater will
become the scene of a critical phase
of the Battle of the Atlantic.

''JMIERE are three possible Nazi of
fensives which may shape up
within the next month or so. (1) A
drive from Libya and possibly the
Middle East and Turkey down to
Egypt and the Suez. (2) A south
ward sweep from Libya to Free
French and British South Africa.
(3) An expedition from Spain and
Spanish Morocco across Weygand's
Morocco and West Africa to Dakar.
The last offensive would consti
tute the greatest threat to the U.S.
It would put the Germans much
closer to the vital South American
continent.
The theory advanced then is this:
The U.S. government is still
holding onto the cob-web-thin
hope that Weygand will resist
Nazi occupation of northwest Af
rica. As long as this hope exists,
it would be highly imprudent for
this government to antagonize the
precariously-poised loyalties of
Weygand by helping De Gaulc, the
man he hates most.
So the U.S. is biding its time on
this issue and watching and waiting.
Another theory—take it or leave it.
yV/lIICH France is the United
States backing?
For some weeks now a contro
versy of no little importance has
occupied the editorial columns of the
nation's leading publications.
Liberal newspapers and maga
zines have been almost unani
mously redundant in their com
plaint that the Administration is
being neither just nor politic in
omitting the name of Free France
from the list of Lend Lease bene
ficiaries.
The arguments are many. But
they are all variations on the same
theme.
What are the facts in the case?

/GENERAL Charles De Gaulle,
9 leader of the Free French forces,
has brought back over one-third of
France's colonial empire into the
war against Germany since the fall
of the Republic.
He commands more than 50,000
French and Colonial troops in
Equatorial Africa and the Middle
East, lie has at liis disposal some
1.200 pilots, 99 merchant ships, and
21 warships and auxiliary craft—
which constitute about a quarter
of France's pre-war naval tonnage.
