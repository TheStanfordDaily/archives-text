"A thoughtful play for a war-torn
world," "Thunder Rock," will be of
fered for students tonight at 8:15 in
Memorial Hall. Written by Robert
Ardrey and directed by F. Cowles
Strickland, the play has a certain
message of hope for today.
ESCAPING REALITY
Several prominent student, actors
and actresses, outstanding alumni,
and faculty members will take the
leading roles. The story revolves
around an ex-newspaperman who
has taken refuge in a lighthouse on
Lake Michigan to escape reality. A
friend visits him to find exactly why
he has taken his unusual stand.
The ex-joumalist claims he is
living with certain heroes of his im
agination, the ghosts of people who
were shipwrecked on the rock in
1848. In the second act he talks
with these characters and learns that
they, too, had lost hope in their
time. After considering their situa
tion and comparing it with his own,
he decides to go back to his old job
on the paper.
