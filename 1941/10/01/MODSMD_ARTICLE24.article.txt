# NYA, Paly Employment Aid Stanford Students
## 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Though the final figures have riot been tabulated, approximately 33
J per cent of the men students at Stanford have registered at the Student
; Employment Office for work during the year. Alhuil 20 per cent of the
; women students have registered.
Stanford has again been allotted NYA money this year by the Federal

Security Agency, although less has.,
been sent than last year because (if
the recent drop in enrollment. Of
the 300 students not registering this
year, a large number would have ap
plied for NYA work.
DEFENSE JOBS, TOO
Typical of the work offered by the
NYA are jobs as lab assistants, re
search assistants, stenographers and
clerks. There are a number of de
fense jobs being done on the cam
pus, particularly in the Engineering
Department, where research is being
carried on in radio and weather re
porting for the government.
A great deal of the work manag
ing the gymnasiums on the campus
is carried out by NYA workers who
have steady jobs repairing athletic
equipment, marking and taking
care of the towels and seeing that
the lockers are kept in order.
APPLICATIONS
To apply for NYA work, the stu
dent fills out an application on
which he makes out a budget, show
ing his earnings, his help from home
and his money on hand. On the
other side he fills out his expense
i account. Using this as a guide, the
office determines how much aid he
can be given.
To the student who merely wants
occasional, part-time work this
budgeting is not required. Mer
chants put in requests for work
through the office and by consulting
the time schedules of the students
who have registered, the office can
generally find someone who has free
time and has noted that he would be
interested in the type of work de
sired.
JOBS OPEN
The office urges those who have
not sent in their time schedules to
do so at once so that they can be
under consideration as the jobs are
offered.
Most popular jobs with the men
are hashing jobs on the campus and
in Palo Alio. Tiiking care of chil-
I dren evenings is popular with the

j girls. Calls come in for all types of
| work: helping in a dairy, mowing
i lawns and (he everpresent work as
agents for laundries and dry clean
ing establishments.
Right now there is an opportunity
for a printer's helper in Menlo
Park, for 16 busboys to help the
caterer at the luncheon to be held
Thursday at the Women's Gym, for
boys to help with the ushering dur
ing the assemblies this week on the
campus (for this job see Mr. Larry
Lydick at the Employment Office)
for a boy with Boy Scout training
and for agents for several large San
Francisco stores. First come, first
: served. Don't say we didn't warn
i you.
