### CHARLIE ALLEN 
This year Stanford students arc
safer and saner drivers.
That's the revelation of Chief
Gordon Davis of the campus police,
who stated yesterday ihat the cam
pus traffic situation is much im
proved over last year.
Despite the widening and im
provement of roads which mi&ht
have encouraged speeding, there
has been no serious speed problem.
Ironically, the only serious prob
lem facing the campus police is
parking.
PARKING VIOLATIONS
Chief Davis emphasized that all
parking areas around the Quad are
closed to student parking. Most fre
quent violations have occurred in
these areas:
1. In back of the Education Build
ing.
2. On Serra Street in front of the
Administration Building.
3. In back of the Main Library.
(This area is reserved for cars of
(he Main and Hoover War Library
stall only.)
4. The area between the Main Li
brary and the Hoover War Library
has been closed and fenced off to
prevent motor noises from disturb
ing the War Library office staff.
OFFICIAL PERMIT
In these areas only cars bearing
official windshield stickers are per
mitted to park. Campus police are
issuing tickets to all other cars found
in these areas. Chief Davis points
out that the widening of the roads
around the Quad to 60 feet will ac
commodate student cars.
The campus police maintain 24-
hour vigil with their five-man force.
Four officers work from radio
equipped automobiles in direct con
nection with the shoil-wave police
radio in Palo Alto. In emergency
cases a campus police car may be
reached at any time by calling the
Palo Alto nolice.
