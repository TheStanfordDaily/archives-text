# GERMAN FORESEES PROLONGED WAR

BERLIN, Sept. 30 (UP). â€”A mem
ber of Adolf Hitler's general staff
tacitly admitted today that the Ger
mans expect the war in Russia to go
into next summer, as dispatches from
the fighting front told of widespread
Russian counter-attacks and bitter
hand-to-hand fighting.
Admission that Germany expects
the Russian campaign to continue
well into 1942 was contained in an
article by Col. Scherff predicting
that German troops would stand the
Russian winter better than the Rus
sians themselves.
"The coming spring will show
further that deepness of area also
has dark aspects for the defender,"
Col Scherff wrote in the Nachtaus
gabe.
These admissions have immense
importance in view of the fact that
American war production will be
coming into full tide early in 1942
and that the United States and
Britain will have the long winter in
which to replenish Soviet weapons
and war supplies.
British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill today emphasized the vi
tal importance of all possible Brit
ish and American aid to Russia, to
keep the bulk of the Wehrmacht tied
up in the East, and said that the
question of invading Europe in or
der to relieve some of the pressure
on Russia had been considered by
the British.
