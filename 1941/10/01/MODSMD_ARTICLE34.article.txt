# Frosh Boasting Good Fullbacks
## 
### 
When Stanford's frosh gridders
tangle with Long Beach J.C. Satur
day, Harry Shipkey will unleash
two hard-driving fullbacks — Dave
Pate and Clement Woods.
Pate distinguished himself on the
field against Bakersfield last week
end on off-tackle slants. His driving
power marks him as a good pros
pect for next year's varsity.
It was Pate who crashed over for
the initial score against the Jaysees
after his fellow fullback, Woods,
had set up the tallying opportunity
with a couple of nifty end runs.
Woods is more the slashing type of
runner, while Pate is better on
straight-ahead line plunging. Be
tween the two, the Long Beach boys
will have to be on their toes every
minute.
Shipkcy's halfbacks, Jim Pettit
and Fred Parsons, should give a
good account of themselves Satur
day if their work against the Oilers
last week was an indication. Both
are good as "T" formation half
backs.
Drivers entering a highway from
