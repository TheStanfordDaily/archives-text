# Abe Simon Next To Meet Bomber?
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 30 (UP).â€”
When Joe Louis picked up his check
for $193,274 today at Mike Jacobs'
office, the promoter was considering
big Abe Simon as the champion's
next opponent in December.
This return match between Bomb
er Joe and the Long Island giant
would serve at least as a condition
ing stop-gap between now and an
other big Louis-Billy Conn bout in
June.
After Joe's 10th title defense last
night against Lou Nova, all con
cerned denied any possibility of
Joe's relinquishing the crown when
he goes into the army next month,
or co-operates with the army on an
extended exhibition tour of camps.
