# Bruin Stock Rising; Cards Work Quietly
## 
### 
The drums are starting to boom
for the U.C.L.A. Bruins who trek
up from the southland near the end
of this week. For Uela's 7-6 win
over Washington State pairs nicely
with Stanford's unexpectedly rough
afternoon with Oregon to set up
what appears on paper to be a much
tighter contest in the Stanford Sta
dium come this Saturday afternoon
than was looked for before the sea
son began.
But those drums can keep right
on booming and it won't bother the
Indians a bit—the Indians who are
working quietly but intently on the
practice field each afternoon. It's
not that the Stanford footballers
haven't a great deal of respect for
the Bruins. It's just that they're
very busy getting in shape for the
Babe Horrell gang that is being
touted as an altogether different
team than the one that ended up in
next to last place in the 1940 race.
UCLANS TOUGHER
With a gang of boys—the Cases,
Forbes, Waterfields, and Smiths—
that appear to have the stuff to
turn in some wins, plus the Q-T at
tack, U.C.L.A. should be a much
toucher foe Saturday than they
were when Norm Standlee had a
field day and ran all over the West
wooders last year.
Jackie Rohinson isn't there, but
the team as a whole is better. And
Stanford's Clark Shaughnessy is al
ready letting it be known that he
expects the Bruins to score. To
score, yes. To win, no. For the
Redshirts have a little in the way
of scoring power themselves, and
the taunt of a determined Ucla

eleven may be just the spark to
make the Stanfords point-hungry.
SHELLEK KI N'S AT HALF
Latest developments from the
practice field find: (1) that Eric
Armstrong, number one right half,
who is suffering from a pulled groin
muscle, still wasn't in a suit yester
day afternoon; and (2) that Bill
Sheller, second string fullback, was
used at the right half spot by
Shaughnessy yesterday.
Although the first team was kept
from contact work, the second and
third outfits scrimmaged on de
fense against the Q-T stuff as it was
run by Husky Hunt's warriors. The
first-stringers are scheduled to work
oh dummy defense during the latter
part of the week.
