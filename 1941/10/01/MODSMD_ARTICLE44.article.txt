# To Stanford

### 
PRESIDENT WILBUR, in inviting all the mem
bers of the Stanford Family to Stanford's
Fiftieth Birthday Party which starts today, asked
everyone, friends, students, alumni, to write
him a letter—"your message to Stanford"—on
this momentous occasion.
Dr. Wilbur has already received many of
these letters. They are all going to be bound
in the library, along with all the other details
of the Fiftieth Anniversary celebration. These
letters will remain for posterity, a tribute to
Stanford from those who have helped to make
ours a truly great tTniversity, from those whom
Stanford has helped along the road to leader
ship and good citizenship.
"Any theme of your choosing is good . . .
what Stanford has meant to you . . . the future
that you see for Stanford's next fifty years."
We of The Daily take the liberty this morning
of speaking for Stanford students as a whole, in
particular those who have not yet complied
with Dr. Wilbur's resquest for a letter.
All of us who now compose Stanford's under
graduate population have been down here "on
the Farm" for a very short time, three or four
years at the most. Some of us have been here
but a few days.
Though all of us are really newcomers to the
Stanford Family compared with most of the
alumni who will be on campus this week, we
still have very strong thoughts on what Stan
ford means to us.
We are not pioneers in the same sense as
the early classes, nor have we been instru
mental in making any drastic changes in Stan
ford's way of life as were the students in 1921
whose insistent efforts gave us the Honor Code,
one of our most cherished traditions.
And from our close-range viewpoint, we can
not now see that Stanford has changed appre
ciably because of us.
But in our short sojourn here, absorbing aca
demic knowledge and integrating it with the
lessons we are learning in how to live with
other people, Stanford has come to mean more
than merely a place of learning.
We have come to realize that because of Stan
ford's liberal leadership, our opportunities are
far broader than elsewhere. We came here and
became a part of a democratic community. We
came here from many different types of com
munities and from all classes of society. To a
great extent, these class lines have vanished.
Prejudices of our former environments have
lessened. In so many ways that we cannot see
through introspection now, our outlook has
broadened. Whether or not we realize it, living
and studying under the Honor Code has left
its indelible mark on us.
But in our youthful period of life everything
cannot be serious. Stanford has come to mean
good times for all of us, both in work and play.
It has brought valuable friendships with our
fellow students, professors and others which
will be life-long in their duration. Week-ends
that will never be forgotten.
This morning in the Inner Quad will be cele
brated the Fiftieth Anniversary of the opening
of Stanford. Men who were in that first class to
register will be present. They will remember
Dr. Jordan's opening address. And they will
think of what Stanford has meant to them over
the past fifty years.
Many of us who will witness this service this
morning will be present on October 1, 1991,
when Stanford celebrates its one-hundredth an
niversary. We won't remember this letter of
appreciation for what Stanford has meant to
us. It will be molding away in the library. Stan
ford will look a lot different to us then.
But we will still feel—even more strongly
fifty years from now that deep appreciation for
the part Stanford played in our lives.

But we will still feel—even more strongly
fifty years from now that deep appreciation for
the part Stanford played in our lives.
PRESIDENT WILBUR, in inviting all the mem
bers of the Stanford Family to Stanford's
Fiftieth Birthday Party which starts today, asked
everyone, friends, students, alumni, to write
him a letter—"your message to Stanford"—on
this momentous occasion.
Dr. Wilbur has already received many of
these letters. They are all going to be bound
in the library, along with all the other details
of the Fiftieth Anniversary celebration. These
letters will remain for posterity, a tribute to
Stanford from those who have helped to make
ours a truly great tTniversity, from those whom
Stanford has helped along the road to leader
ship and good citizenship.
"Any theme of your choosing is good . . .
what Stanford has meant to you . . . the future
that you see for Stanford's next fifty years."
We of The Daily take the liberty this morning
of speaking for Stanford students as a whole, in
particular those who have not yet complied
with Dr. Wilbur's resquest for a letter.
All of us who now compose Stanford's under
graduate population have been down here "on
the Farm" for a very short time, three or four
years at the most. Some of us have been here
but a few days.
Though all of us are really newcomers to the
Stanford Family compared with most of the
alumni who will be on campus this week, we
still have very strong thoughts on what Stan
ford means to us.
We are not pioneers in the same sense as
the early classes, nor have we been instru
mental in making any drastic changes in Stan
ford's way of life as were the students in 1921
whose insistent efforts gave us the Honor Code,
one of our most cherished traditions.
And from our close-range viewpoint, we can
not now see that Stanford has changed appre
ciably because of us.
But in our short sojourn here, absorbing aca
demic knowledge and integrating it with the
lessons we are learning in how to live with
other people, Stanford has come to mean more
than merely a place of learning.
We have come to realize that because of Stan
ford's liberal leadership, our opportunities are
far broader than elsewhere. We came here and
became a part of a democratic community. We
came here from many different types of com
munities and from all classes of society. To a
great extent, these class lines have vanished.
Prejudices of our former environments have
lessened. In so many ways that we cannot see
through introspection now, our outlook has
broadened. Whether or not we realize it, living
and studying under the Honor Code has left
its indelible mark on us.
But in our youthful period of life everything
cannot be serious. Stanford has come to mean
good times for all of us, both in work and play.
It has brought valuable friendships with our
fellow students, professors and others which
will be life-long in their duration. Week-ends
that will never be forgotten.
This morning in the Inner Quad will be cele
brated the Fiftieth Anniversary of the opening
of Stanford. Men who were in that first class to
register will be present. They will remember
Dr. Jordan's opening address. And they will
think of what Stanford has meant to them over
the past fifty years.
Many of us who will witness this service this
morning will be present on October 1, 1991,
when Stanford celebrates its one-hundredth an
niversary. We won't remember this letter of
appreciation for what Stanford has meant to
us. It will be molding away in the library. Stan
ford will look a lot different to us then.
But we will still feel—even more strongly
fifty years from now that deep appreciation for
the part Stanford played in our lives.
