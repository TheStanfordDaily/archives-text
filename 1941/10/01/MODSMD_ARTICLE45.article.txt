EX COMMITTEE, the voice of Stanford stu
dent government, met last night for the first
time this year. The meeting was dull. All first
meetings, which deal with the mechanics of
getting under way, which deal with multitudes
of names, dates, and financial reports, usually
are dull.
Perhaps it is best that you missed this meet
ing; and then again perhaps not, since the
words which passed across Excom's round
table last night, though dry, none the less pre
sented a revealing picture of how your student
government —the government of you and you—
clicks.
There is just one way for you, the student,
to understand your student government —and
you should. Drop in on any meeting of the Ex
Committee, held every Tuesday night at 7:15.
You have been invited before.
And yet no outsider showed enough interest
last night to sit in on the round table. If Stan
ford students would avail themselves of this
opportunity to watch and to understand what
goes on behind the scenes, in all its scope,
perhaps, then, their criticisms of their govern
ment would be less frequent, more informed,
and more tolerant.—Bud Ames
