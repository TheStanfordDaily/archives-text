OCCASIONAL classroom criticism of The
Daily in general and its columnists in
particular seems to have become a traditional
delight of a few Stanford professors. Undoubt
edly, much of this censure, pointing out inaccu
racies and "butches," is deserved by The Daily
and well intended by the professors. We are
sincerely grateful for their interest and sugges
tions. However, we wish they would make con
crete criticisms of specific material, avoiding
blanket allusions, so that we may profit by their
suggestions and publish a better Daily.—Harold
Shafer
Some guys are good guys and other guys
cheat the ice cream hoy at football games.
There is also another and more important
consideration—at Stanford we practice the
Honor Code.
