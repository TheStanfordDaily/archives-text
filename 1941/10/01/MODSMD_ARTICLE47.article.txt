### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
A DAY AT TIIE DAILY
r r<His afternoon some time after 4 o'clock, a gang of
freshmen and transfers will pile into old Room 8
of the Press Building, for today the first call for Daily
tryouts is being made. As you go by the Shack on
your way to Room 8, newcomers, you will probably see
faces covered with ink sticking out from the windows.
There will be the faces of the staff members, who for
a few minutes have torn themselves away from their
bridge game and the coke machine to appraise you.
To see if you have any potentialities along newspaper
or any other lines. Just ignore these faces and go along
on your way, unless one of them happens to be ex
tremely black.

/"kNCE upstairs you will hear speeches about news
work, about stories and writing, about the quali
fications necessary and the opportunities afforded. Sor
ry to say, most of you will probably miss most of the
important things that are going to be said, for you will
be busy looking over your fellow tryoutees. It's too
bad, but everyone does it.
I can remember the first meeting I went to. In my
case it was the girl who called roll. She had eyes, and
even though she pronounced my name wrong every
time and every time in a different way, she had eyes
and each week I rushed to the meeting to say "here"
until I was on the staff.
All through the meeting you will probably hear
loud noises, coming from below and in back of you.
These noises, just like the faces, will be coming from
the Shack and from the staff members. They will be
down there screaming and shouting, smoking cigarettes
and frantically rushing around. Altogether you will
get the impression that something tremendous is hap
pening in that funny little building. And that will be
exactly the impression the staff members want to give.
But don't get excited. They are just putting out The
Daily and they want you to be sure to understand how
hard it is, and how much fun it is, and how important
their work is.

Â¥ CAN only say that if you like to look at headlines,
if you like to sit by a typewriter and hack away at
it, if the tick of the U.P. machine gives you a funny
little thrill, if you like to sing and holler and make a
lot of noise and drink cokes and be rushed and al
ways a week or so behind in your work, if you like
that kind of madness, then there is a place for you
in the Shack. Just walk in and say, "Saroyan sent me."
