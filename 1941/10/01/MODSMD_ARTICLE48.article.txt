'T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
Monday morning's paper carried a letter from a
certain Mr. Huntington, who claimed that The Daily
seemed to think Stanford men are above the draft. In
some ways I agree with The Daily, but I disagree with
Mr. Huntington.
Has it ever occurred to him that many of Stan
ford's men are above the average intelligence of the
striking laborers in San Francisco and the WPA work
ers? Does he not know that many of Stanford's men
are majoring in medicine, law, biology, engineering, or
teaching? I will grant that there are a few lazy stu
dents at Stanford who just barely get through—but—
those men who have majors which will be important
in making them business or professional to keep a
wartorn world together when this battle is over
SHOULD NOT BE DRAFTED!
Can't Mr. Huntington see that there must be many
exceptions where college students are concerned and
that these exceptions must be granted when it is pos
sible to draft men who are striking for six dollars a
day and pay them $21 a month.
Men who are physically fit and working in the
WPA should also be drafted so that the taxpayer will
not be supporting two such large groups of men.
Do you see what I mean, Mr. Huntington?
Respectfully yours,
J. W. E.
