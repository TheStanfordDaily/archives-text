# Shirer Appraises Politics, Nazi Methods in 'Diary'
## 
### 
"BERLIN DIARY," by William L. Shirer, published by Knopf Com
pany.
William L. Shirer, former head of Columbia Broadcasting Company's
Continental staff and one of the outstanding men to have the distinction
of being asked to leave Germany, has compile a diary of his experiences, and

of his comments on the political,
events in Germany. The book cov
ers the last five years—probably the
most vital five-year period in the his
tory of the European continent.
Shirer seems to possess the happy
faculty of seeming always to be at
the right place at the right time. He
saw the occupation of the Rhine
land, was in Vienna at the time of
the Anschluss, in Czechoslovakia,
Gottesburg, Berlin and Munich dur
ing the Chamberlain sellout, in Dan
zig during the latter days of Aug
ust 1938, and finally he scooped the
world with his eye-witness account
of the armistice at Compiegne.
KEEN APPRAISAL
However, the value of the "Berlin
Diary" is not in Shirer's description
of these history-making events, but
is rather in his keen appraisal of the
day-to-day events which arc truly
significant in an analysis of the
events of the present war.
The reading of the book gives one
a far greater appreciation of the job
faced by the Columbia Company in
presenting "The World Today."
Technical and censorship difficulty
proved nearly insurmountable ob
stacles.
In returning from Germany, Shi
rer believes that the German army
tends toward the truth in their an
nouncements. The navy, he says,
exaggerates, and the air force simply
lies.
NAZI EUTHENASIA
Less complimentary, Shirer tells
of the wholesale destruction of Ger
man minors who are an expense to
the state. The neat expedient of in
jecting air into the children's veins
was the method employed.
Horror stories are the things that
Shirer attempts to avoid in his book.
Horror stories from Germany are a
drug on the market, since the re
turn of groups of Americans from
Germany. Rather, Shirer's is valu
able to the American reader because
it presents the significant events and
movement in Europe as analyzed
from day to day by a trained and
sensitive political analyst.—Leonard
