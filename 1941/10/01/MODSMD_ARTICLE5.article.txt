# Luncheon Group To Hear Grads
## 
### 
The Wednesday Luncheon Club
will gather today at 12 noon in the
Nitery for its first meeting of the
autumn quarter. The featured en
tertainment will be Shirley Baker
and Charles K. Field, both '95, hits
of the Farm in the 'nineties as the
"Bakers-Field Twins."
The "Twins" will offer songs and
poems of the period, including hits
from campus productions of the era.
Both are writers, and Mr. Field is
the well-known "Cheerio" of the
air-lanes.
The price of lunch will be 30
cents, instead of 25 cents as an
nounced yesterday. The gathering
is informal, and all are welcome.
