# Excom Sees Budget Cut 15 Per Cent
## Dry Meeting Gropes Silently Over Routine Dates, Appointments 
### BUD AMES 
Ex Committee, looking adequately
important but obviously just "win
dew shopping" in its first meeting of
the year, last night mumbled through
approvals of sundry "important in
cidentals" necessary to start turning
the wheels of Farm activities.
Despite opening pleas for "an in
formal atmosphere" by A.S.S.U.
President George Jackson, the
mumblings got off to a serious start
under a deadly financial report by
Student Manager Jim McKellar.
Meat of his words lay in his sum
mation, namely, that "our operat
ing budget has been cut 15 per cent
due to decreased enrollment, de
spite only a 7 per cent enrollment
drop and will continue to operate as
much due to the heavy burdens of
autumn quarter."
Things began to brighten. A box
of candy and free cigarettes made
the rounds. Isabel Fawcett, gag
leader for the evening giving prom
ise of things to come, quipped terse
ly, and the Ex Committeeites slump
ed more to the informal.
CARDS FILES REPLACED
Most important and most definite
action taken was the replacement of
the defunct Card Files by the Activ
ities Committee. Isabel Fawcett, as
chairman and Excom's representa
tive, will ascertain that all heads
and presidents of all campus groups
make all appointments through this
committee.
Her assistants, by last night's ap
pointments, are Joe Dixon, fresh
man; Jack Reynolds, sophomore;
Tiny Moser, junior; and Magee
Harper, senior.
"That Tiny, he's tremendous,"
suggested Miss Fawcett. "Well, you
know what I mean—tremendous
spiritually."
Then came more mumblings as
names, dates, and still more appoint
ments were suggested, read off, and
approved with due reverence. Chair
man Jackson, sounding like a page
from Locke, checked them off.
EXCELLENT IDEA
"An excellent idea; Activities For
um will be moved into autumn quar
ter where it will do the most good.
Oh yes, the Gaieties are too risque,
but we'll deal with that later.
"Next, in line with the recent
trouble at Cal, Ralph Fisher, their
student body president, is coming
down to our meeting next week to
act as a warning bell against future
Cal-Stanford intercampus wrecking
parties.
"Carillon, the literary magazine,
had troubles for us tonight but
they've decided to postpone them.
SERVICE MEN'S YELLS
"Oh yes, what about getting an
other yell leader to lead the section
of service men. We can't have them
yelling against us every Saturday.
We'll discuss that next time."
Climax to the evening's entertain
ment, thanks to Miss Fawcett, came
with the appointment of a three-man
Excom committee to report on the
workings of the Farm's electoral
system at the next meeting.
Nobody was certain the meeting
was over. Jackson rapped his gavel
climactically, and then everybody
milled around finding out who all
the other people around the table
were.

Her assistants, by last night's ap

Tiny Moser, junior; and Magee
Harper, senior.
"That Tiny, he's tremendous,"
suggested Miss Fawcett. "Well, you
know what I mean—tremendous
spiritually."
Then came more mumblings as
names, dates, and still more appoint

approved with due reverence. Chair
man Jackson, sounding like a page
from Locke, checked them off.
EXCELLENT IDEA
"An excellent idea; Activities For
um will be moved into autumn quar
ter where it will do the most good.
Oh yes, the Gaieties are too risque,
but we'll deal with that later.
"Next, in line with the recent
trouble at Cal, Ralph Fisher, their

down to our meeting next week to
act as a warning bell against future
Cal-Stanford intercampus wrecking

"Carillon, the literary magazine,

they've decided to postpone them.
SERVICE MEN'S YELLS
"Oh yes, what about getting an
other yell leader to lead the section
of service men. We can't have them
yelling against us every Saturday.
We'll discuss that next time."
Climax to the evening's entertain
ment, thanks to Miss Fawcett, came
with the appointment of a three-man
Excom committee to report on the
workings of the Farm's electoral
system at the next meeting.
Nobody was certain the meeting

climactically, and then everybody
milled around finding out who all
the other people around the table
were.

Ex Committee, looking adequately
important but obviously just "win
dew shopping" in its first meeting of
the year, last night mumbled through
approvals of sundry "important in
cidentals" necessary to start turning
the wheels of Farm activities.
Despite opening pleas for "an in
formal atmosphere" by A.S.S.U.
President George Jackson, the
mumblings got off to a serious start
under a deadly financial report by
Student Manager Jim McKellar.
Meat of his words lay in his sum
mation, namely, that "our operat
ing budget has been cut 15 per cent
due to decreased enrollment, de
spite only a 7 per cent enrollment
drop and will continue to operate as
much due to the heavy burdens of
autumn quarter."
Things began to brighten. A box

had troubles for us tonight but
they've decided to postpone them.
SERVICE MEN'S YELLS
"Oh yes, what about getting an
other yell leader to lead the section
of service men. We can't have them
yelling against us every Saturday.
We'll discuss that next time."
Climax to the evening's entertain
ment, thanks to Miss Fawcett, came
with the appointment of a three-man
Excom committee to report on the
workings of the Farm's electoral
system at the next meeting.
Nobody was certain the meeting
was over. Jackson rapped his gavel
climactically, and then everybody
milled around finding out who all
the other people around the table
were.

Ex Committee, looking adequately
important but obviously just "win
dew shopping" in its first meeting of
the year, last night mumbled through
approvals of sundry "important in
cidentals" necessary to start turning
the wheels of Farm activities.
Despite opening pleas for "an in
formal atmosphere" by A.S.S.U.
President George Jackson, the
mumblings got off to a serious start
under a deadly financial report by
Student Manager Jim McKellar.
Meat of his words lay in his sum
mation, namely, that "our operat
ing budget has been cut 15 per cent
due to decreased enrollment, de
spite only a 7 per cent enrollment
drop and will continue to operate as
much due to the heavy burdens of
autumn quarter."
Things began to brighten. A box
of candy and free cigarettes made
the rounds. Isabel Fawcett, gag
leader for the evening giving prom
ise of things to come, quipped terse
ly, and the Ex Committeeites slump
ed more to the informal.
CARDS FILES REPLACED
Most important and most definite
action taken was the replacement of
the defunct Card Files by the Activ
ities Committee. Isabel Fawcett, as
chairman and Excom's representa
tive, will ascertain that all heads
and presidents of all campus groups
make all appointments through this
committee.
Her assistants, by last night's ap
pointments, are Joe Dixon, fresh
man; Jack Reynolds, sophomore;
Tiny Moser, junior; and Magee
Harper, senior.
"That Tiny, he's tremendous,"
suggested Miss Fawcett. "Well, you
know what I mean—tremendous
spiritually."
Then came more mumblings as
names, dates, and still more appoint
ments were suggested, read off, and
approved with due reverence. Chair
man Jackson, sounding like a page
from Locke, checked them off.
EXCELLENT IDEA
"An excellent idea; Activities For
um will be moved into autumn quar
ter where it will do the most good.
Oh yes, the Gaieties are too risque,
but we'll deal with that later.
"Next, in line with the recent
trouble at Cal, Ralph Fisher, their
student body president, is coming
down to our meeting next week to
act as a warning bell against future
Cal-Stanford intercampus wrecking
parties.
"Carillon, the literary magazine,
had troubles for us tonight but
they've decided to postpone them.
