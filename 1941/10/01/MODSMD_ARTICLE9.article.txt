# Excom Sees Budget Cut 15 Per Cent
## Dry Meeting Gropes Silently Over Routine Dates, Appointments 
### BUD AMES 
Ex Committee, looking adequately
important but obviously just "win
dew shopping" in its first meeting of
the year, last night mumbled through
approvals of sundry "important in
cidentals" necessary to start turning
the wheels of Farm activities.
Despite opening pleas for "an in
formal atmosphere" by A.S.S.U.

Tiny Moser, junior; and Magee
Harper, senior.
"That Tiny, he's tremendous,"
suggested Miss Fawcett. "Well, you
know what I mean—tremendous
spiritually."
Then came more mumblings as

approved with due reverence. Chair
man Jackson, sounding like a page
from Locke, checked them off.
EXCELLENT IDEA
"An excellent idea; Activities For
