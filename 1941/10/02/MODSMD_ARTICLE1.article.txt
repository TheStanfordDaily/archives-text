# History ... 1941

### AMIE REICHERT 
was a big day: the
World Series opened. It fol
lows, therefore, that today nobody
in his right mind is the slightest bit
interested in what happened in
Washington, London, Berlin, Mos
cow, or even Holy City.
But yesterday was not only a
big day in the lives of Messrs,
Gordon, Hulling, and Dickey. It
was important to Adolf Hitler and
Uncle Joe Stalin and Winston
Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt
and Joe Doakes as well.
Biggest item of interest to the U.S.
was the landing of the first A.E.F.
of World War II in Reykjavik, Ice
land. Dispatches stated tersely that
soldiers of the United States Army
had joined marines already estab
lished on the island. The reports did
not state whether the contingent in
cluded any draftees.

to provisions of the
Draft Law, draftees may not be
sent out of the Western Hemisphere.
But, Iceland was proclaimed inside
this hemisphere when the U.S. oc
cupied it several months ago—de
spite the fact that centuries of geog
raphers had not ruled it as such.
There is a kind of inverted reas
oning apparent here. The U.S. oc
cupied Iceland; therefore it is in
the Western Hemisphere. U.S.
troops (possibly including draft
ees) land in Iceland; therefore it
must be in the Western Hemi
sphere.
If this is confusing, just blame it
on the fact that the Western Hemi
sphere seems to possess the prop
erty of expanding under pressure.
We may see this sort of thing hap
pening in the case of Dakar before
long.

jJIGGEST news in Europe last
night was the raging tornado of
rebellion and sabotage which con
tinued to sweep the continent in
ever-increasing fury.
For some months now, unrest
which has often flared into undis
guised acts of rebellion has seethed
principally in Norway, France,
Czechoslovakia. Last night's re
ports disclosed the contagion of the
rebellion. Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,
Rumania, and Greece were found
guilty by the Nazi conquerors of
harboring Communists and Jews
—which translated mean saboteurs,
patriots, irreconcilables.
The Germans no longer keep this
sort of thing a deep dark secret.
They acknowledge it by their mass
murders, threats and accusations.
Last night German justice sentenced
General Alois Elias, premier of
Nazi-dominated Bohemia and Mora
via, to death on charges of plotting
a military rebellion.

r |'IIE Nazis also liquidated 84
other Czechs, cleaned out the
undesirables in Varna, chief port of
Bulgaria, and in the Banat area of
Jugoslavia. The Gestapo had a busy
little time of it. Arrests skyrocketed
well over the thousand mark.
Other reports were that Ruma
nia's chief of state, General lon
Antoncscue, had returned from the
Russian front and resigned both
his governmental and army posts.
Bulgaria's Interior Minister Milan
Atschimovitsch took a leave of ab
sence for his health. Whether the
vacation was for diplomatic or me
dicinal purposes the Germans didn't
say. However, the crack-down on
Bulgarian "Communists" coincided
with this move.

| N the Battle of Russia, fiercest
fighting continued to be centered
in the Leningrad, Kharkov and
Odessa regions. As usual both sides
claimed successes, but the Germans
acknowledged fierce Russian coun
ter-attacking around Leningrad and
Odessa.
According to Berlin, the German
drive in the south was now skirting
the fringes of the Donets industrial
basin, and was "continuing success
fully."
P.S. The Yanks won.
