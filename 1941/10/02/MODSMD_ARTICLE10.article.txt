# 'Free Universities Dependent On Democracy,' Says Fosdick
## 
### 
Free universities will exist only so long as democracy exists, so educa
tion today must be dedicated to the re-interpretation and rcvitalization of
democracy, declared Dr. Raymond B. Fosdick, president of the Rockefeller
Foundation, last night at the Fiftieth Birthday Banquet at the Palace Hotel.

"Slavery arid universities
live side by side," Dr. Fosdick as
serted. "You cannot carry on the
search for truth in a world from
which freedom has been banished."
Dr. Fosdick argued that if univer
sities are to meet the crisis of the
present hour, they must not lose
faith in the ultimate triumph of j
reason.

He emphasized that the black and ;
ominous dangers which threaten the |
world at this time must not be
minimized. It is too easy a general
ization to say these dangers are not
new and that mankind had always
suffered, he added.
"vVe cannot foresee what all the
consequences will be, Dr. Fosdick j
said, "but this we can say: a free- |
dom-thirsty world cannot perma- j
nently be kept in chains. Men who
have tasted liberty never forget the j
taste."
COLLEGES AID LIBERTY

places where now it is gone, if de

it will be in no small part because
institutions like Stanford have led
the way to new light and have dared |
to dream of greater days to come. It j
will be because of you, at that time,
