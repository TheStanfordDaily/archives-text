# 'Free Universities Dependent On Democracy,' Says Fosdick
## 
### 
Free universities will exist only so long as democracy exists, so educa
tion today must be dedicated to the re-interpretation and rcvitalization of
democracy, declared Dr. Raymond B. Fosdick, president of the Rockefeller
Foundation, last night at the Fiftieth Birthday Banquet at the Palace Hotel.

"Slavery arid universities
live side by side," Dr. Fosdick as
serted. "You cannot carry on the
search for truth in a world from
which freedom has been banished."
Dr. Fosdick argued that if univer
sities are to meet the crisis of the
present hour, they must not lose
faith in the ultimate triumph of j
reason.
EMPHASIZES DANGERS
He emphasized that the black and ;
ominous dangers which threaten the |
world at this time must not be
minimized. It is too easy a general
ization to say these dangers are not
new and that mankind had always
suffered, he added.
"vVe cannot foresee what all the
consequences will be, Dr. Fosdick j
said, "but this we can say: a free- |
dom-thirsty world cannot perma- j
nently be kept in chains. Men who
have tasted liberty never forget the j
taste."

Dr. Fosdick argued that if univer
sities are to meet the crisis of the
present hour, they must not lose
faith in the ultimate triumph of j
reason.
EMPHASIZES DANGERS
He emphasized that the black and ;
ominous dangers which threaten the |
world at this time must not be
minimized. It is too easy a general
ization to say these dangers are not
new and that mankind had always
suffered, he added.
"vVe cannot foresee what all the
consequences will be, Dr. Fosdick j
said, "but this we can say: a free- |
dom-thirsty world cannot perma- j
nently be kept in chains. Men who
have tasted liberty never forget the j
taste."
COLLEGES AID LIBERTY
"In 1991," (100 years from Stan
ford's founding Oct. 1, 1891) "if lib
erty has been re-established in the
places where now it is gone, if de
mocracy is a living, growing force,
it will be in no small part because
institutions like Stanford have led
the way to new light and have dared |
to dream of greater days to come. It j
will be because of you, at that time,
like your fathers 50 years ago and
your sons after you, have dedicated
Stanford as a center of intellectual
ferment, where the winds of free
dom blow," he concluded.
i Before the address, John Charles
Thomas, noted baritone, sang and
the Stanford Players presented nn
original dramatic mask.
Free universities will exist only so long as democracy exists, so educa
tion today must be dedicated to the re-interpretation and rcvitalization of
democracy, declared Dr. Raymond B. Fosdick, president of the Rockefeller
Foundation, last night at the Fiftieth Birthday Banquet at the Palace Hotel.

"Slavery arid universities
live side by side," Dr. Fosdick as
serted. "You cannot carry on the
search for truth in a world from
which freedom has been banished."
