# Beck to Coach Varsity Debate Team for Year
## 
### 
A ruling at the University of Ha
j waii prohibits faculty members from
j appearing on the Waikiki Beach be-
I fore 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Yet,
as Dr. N. B. Beck, '26, Stanford's
new debate coach, points out, there
; are always other beaches. It takes
j Stanford, situated only 15 miles from
Half Moon Bay, to offer sufficient
j reason for a professor to leave such a
i vacation setting as Hawaii for a year
j on the mainland.
Professor Leland T. Chapin, Stan
ford's regular debate coach, is
teaching in the Islands this year. His
place is being taken by Dr. Beck,
who officially serves as head of the
English department at the University
of Hawaii. Included in his depart
-1 ment of 26 members are the divisions
j of speech and drama and of journal
ism.
For eleven years Dr. Beck was
! debate coach of the Island Univer
sity and, despite the handicap of
distance in meeting competitive
groups, had a number of winning
teams.
Dr. and Mrs. Beck arrived in June
from the Islards to attend the 50th
Anniversary Convocation at Stan
i ford before spending the summer in
Mexico.
In speaking of the varsity debate
members after their first meeting
Tuesday afternoon, Dr. Beck said
that of course he was "Interested in
| seeing the team do as well as pos
! sible," and that "from the looks
| of the material, Stanford should have
as good a team as is on the Coast
! this year."
| The new debate manager, who is
j anxious to meet all University stu
dents interested in debate, holds
"open office" from 10 to 12 every
morning in Room 200T, downstairs in
the English Corner.
