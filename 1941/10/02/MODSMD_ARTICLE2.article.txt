# Hoover's Poll of Faculty Shows 60% of Professors Oppose Dynamic Defense
## 
### 
Exclusive to The Stanford Daily
Results of a personal poll conducted by Herbert Hoover, Stanford '95,
of some 800 Stanford faculty members including the 17(5 who recently issued
a joint statement in support of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, urging
"dynamic defense," were released in a nationwide exclusive to The Daily
by the ex-President yesterday afternoon immediately before leaving his

campus home for New York. A
Mr. Hoover drew the conclusion
from the poll that GO per cent of the
faculty taken as a whole did not
agree with the statement of the 17(5
signers. The statement urged a "dy

means of security against the to
talitarian menace."
The statement was drafted by Pro

Cottrell, Gordon Ferris, Albert Guc

and Lewis M. Terman.
Mr. Hoover's statement to The
Daily follows:

thinking group on the questions in
volved, I sent out a questionnaire to
the whole faculty. On this tran
scendency complicated and emo
tional subject, questionnaires are al
ways difficult to formulate, to an
swer, and to interpret the answers.
The percentages have been calcu
lated in the approved polling fash

trends.
GENEROUS RESPONSE
The response was extraordinarily
generous—in proportions it took on
the complexion of a national elec
tion not a Gallup poll. Accompany
ing the replies were many most val
uable and illuminating discussions.
One conclusion is that there can
be no doubt of the Creator's triumph
in making all minds different. More
over, the weighting of reason and
emotion is certainly different in each
