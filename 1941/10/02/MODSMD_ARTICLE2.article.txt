# Hoover's Poll of Faculty Shows 60% of Professors Oppose Dynamic Defense
## 
### 
Exclusive to The Stanford Daily
Results of a personal poll conducted by Herbert Hoover, Stanford '95,
of some 800 Stanford faculty members including the 17(5 who recently issued
a joint statement in support of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, urging
"dynamic defense," were released in a nationwide exclusive to The Daily
by the ex-President yesterday afternoon immediately before leaving his

campus home for New York. A
Mr. Hoover drew the conclusion
from the poll that GO per cent of the
faculty taken as a whole did not
agree with the statement of the 17(5
signers. The statement urged a "dy
namic defense as the most effective
means of security against the to
talitarian menace."
The statement was drafted by Pro
fessors Eliot Blackwelder, E. A.
Cottrell, Gordon Ferris, Albert Guc
rard, Emile Holman. Graham Stu
art, C. V. Taylor, David L. Webster,
and Lewis M. Terman.
Mr. Hoover's statement to The
Daily follows:
The intense faculty interest in the
present problems of peace and war
was indicated by a statement issued
by 176 members of the Stanford fac
ulty on September 17. Wishing to
get more of the views of a great
thinking group on the questions in
volved, I sent out a questionnaire to
the whole faculty. On this tran
scendency complicated and emo
tional subject, questionnaires are al
ways difficult to formulate, to an
swer, and to interpret the answers.
The percentages have been calcu
lated in the approved polling fash
ion. The results at best indicate
trends.
GENEROUS RESPONSE
The response was extraordinarily
generous—in proportions it took on
the complexion of a national elec
tion not a Gallup poll. Accompany
ing the replies were many most val
uable and illuminating discussions.
One conclusion is that there can
be no doubt of the Creator's triumph
in making all minds different. More
over, the weighting of reason and
emotion is certainly different in each
mind. And the difference between
the facts, constitutional law, and,
public policy, upon which premise is
based, all illustrate the difficulty of
j the problem before the nation.
DISAGREEMENT
I may say at once that 60 per cent
of the faculty taken as a whole did j
not agree with the statement of the
176 signers. And the reasons varied
| greatly.
What I was particularly interested
( in were four very important points j
raised by the declaration of the 176
| which it seemed to me might be
I used to draw out the varied views
I on the subject.
first statement
The first of these statements was: I
"Recognizing the fallacy of the idea
that a passive defense is still pos- i
J sible, we support a more dynamic
; policy of action...." This expres- j
; sion of "more dynamic" in connection j
; with defense obviously presupposed
j some sort of military action. I there
fore asked four questions on those
concrete actions which are now un- j
! der debate in the country and which ;
the nation is called upon to deter- i
mine.
a) Do you think we should carry
munitions to England in American- j
| flag ships?
b) Do you think we should con
! voy them the whole distance?
c) Do you approve complete naval
action against Hitler in all waters?
e) Do you think we should send a
land force to the Continent against '
Hitler?
separate results
The results are given first for the
| whole faculty and afterwards for
] the 176 separately.
On the question of transporting
munitions to England 47 per eent> of
the whole faculty favored it, while
53 per cent did not agree.
On convoys, 44 per cent of the
| whole faculty were for it, while 56
• per cent did not agree.
On all-out naval action, 39 per cent
j of the whole faculty favored it, while
J 61 per cent did not agree.
On sending an expeditionary force
to Europe. 8 per cent of the whole
faculty favored it now, 9 per cent
| later on, and 83 per cent did not
!agree.
VIEWS OF I7G
The 176 who signed the declara
tion also varied in their views:
On the question of transporting
munitions to England on American
flag ships, 73 per cent of the signa
j tories approved, while 27 per cent
I did not agree.
On the question of convoys the
i whole distance, 73 per cent approved,
] and 27 per cent did not agree.
On the question of all-out naval
war, 67 per cent were for it, and 33
per cent did not agree.
On the question of sending land
: forces to the Continent, 16 per cent
! were for it now, 24 per cent for it
later on. and 60 per cent did not
|agree.
The same persons did not approve
'or disapprove the different proposi

tions. Unity is hard to secure!
The second question that I thought
might provoke thought arose from
the statement of the 176: "Opposing
aggression, we heartily support the !
Hoover-Stimson Doctrine (of non- i
recognition of territorial acquisition
by aggression).... As a logical cor
ollary the United States must as- !
sume its share of responsibility for a !
world order based upon international '
law and justice...." As this doc-;
trine was first applied against Japan
in 1932, it seemed. possible to test
where this responsibility reached to i
by a question:
Do you believe we should de- |
mand Japanese retirement from i
China and declare war if she refuses?
On this question 6 per cent of the ]
faculty as a whole were for it and \
94 per cent did not agree.
Of the signatory group 9 per cent !
thought this would be "dynamic de
fense," but 91 per cent did not agree, j
although some thought it should be
done later on.
TIIIIiD POINT
A third point upon which views
would -be very valuable arose from j
the statement by the 176: "Inasmuch |
as the President of the United States, j
under our Constitution, is Com
mander-in-Chief of the Army and j
Navy and is responsible for the con- ]
duct of our foreign relations, we as
Americans regardless of party aflilia- ;
i tions, should accord him our unified I
j support in this period of national
emergency."
It seemed desirable to know how
far Congress came into the picture.
Therefox-e I asked:
f) Do you think Congress should
be asked to authorize such (as the
above) steps before they are taken?
Here entered complicated ques
tions of constitutional and statutory
law and interpretations of Presiden
: tial authority.
CONGRESS' POSITION
Taking the faculty as a whole, 66
per cent were insistent that Congress
should first approve each step, 23
per cent qualified the different steps
or expressed no decided views, 8 per
cent wanted Congress ignored alto
| gether and 3 per cent wanted war
| declared now.
Of the signatories of the declara
tion, 16 per cent wanted Congress
ignored altogether. 40 per cent qual
ified on how far Congress should in
tervene, 10 per cent wanted war de
clared now, 11 per cent expressed no
decided views, and 23 per cent
| wanted Congress to first approve
each step.
One conclusion is certain. Our
University motto still stands on our
50th Anniversary — "The Winds of
Freedom still blow hereabouts." (The
I translation is mine).

Exclusive to The Stanford Daily
Results of a personal poll conducted by Herbert Hoover, Stanford '95,
of some 800 Stanford faculty members including the 17(5 who recently issued
a joint statement in support of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, urging
"dynamic defense," were released in a nationwide exclusive to The Daily
by the ex-President yesterday afternoon immediately before leaving his

campus home for New York. A
Mr. Hoover drew the conclusion
from the poll that GO per cent of the
faculty taken as a whole did not
agree with the statement of the 17(5
signers. The statement urged a "dy
namic defense as the most effective
means of security against the to
talitarian menace."
The statement was drafted by Pro
fessors Eliot Blackwelder, E. A.
Cottrell, Gordon Ferris, Albert Guc
rard, Emile Holman. Graham Stu
art, C. V. Taylor, David L. Webster,
and Lewis M. Terman.
Mr. Hoover's statement to The
Daily follows:
The intense faculty interest in the
present problems of peace and war
was indicated by a statement issued
by 176 members of the Stanford fac
ulty on September 17. Wishing to
get more of the views of a great
thinking group on the questions in
volved, I sent out a questionnaire to
the whole faculty. On this tran
scendency complicated and emo
tional subject, questionnaires are al
ways difficult to formulate, to an
swer, and to interpret the answers.
The percentages have been calcu
lated in the approved polling fash
ion. The results at best indicate
trends.
GENEROUS RESPONSE
The response was extraordinarily
generous—in proportions it took on
the complexion of a national elec
tion not a Gallup poll. Accompany
ing the replies were many most val
uable and illuminating discussions.
One conclusion is that there can
be no doubt of the Creator's triumph
in making all minds different. More
over, the weighting of reason and
emotion is certainly different in each
mind. And the difference between
the facts, constitutional law, and,
public policy, upon which premise is
based, all illustrate the difficulty of
j the problem before the nation.
DISAGREEMENT
I may say at once that 60 per cent
of the faculty taken as a whole did j
not agree with the statement of the
176 signers. And the reasons varied
| greatly.
What I was particularly interested
( in were four very important points j
raised by the declaration of the 176
| which it seemed to me might be
I used to draw out the varied views
I on the subject.
first statement
The first of these statements was: I
"Recognizing the fallacy of the idea
that a passive defense is still pos- i
J sible, we support a more dynamic
; policy of action...." This expres- j
; sion of "more dynamic" in connection j
; with defense obviously presupposed
j some sort of military action. I there
fore asked four questions on those
concrete actions which are now un- j
! der debate in the country and which ;
the nation is called upon to deter- i
mine.
a) Do you think we should carry
munitions to England in American- j
| flag ships?
b) Do you think we should con
! voy them the whole distance?
c) Do you approve complete naval
action against Hitler in all waters?
e) Do you think we should send a
land force to the Continent against '
Hitler?
separate results
The results are given first for the
| whole faculty and afterwards for
] the 176 separately.
On the question of transporting
munitions to England 47 per eent> of
the whole faculty favored it, while
53 per cent did not agree.
On convoys, 44 per cent of the
| whole faculty were for it, while 56
• per cent did not agree.
On all-out naval action, 39 per cent
j of the whole faculty favored it, while
J 61 per cent did not agree.
On sending an expeditionary force
to Europe. 8 per cent of the whole
faculty favored it now, 9 per cent
| later on, and 83 per cent did not
!agree.
VIEWS OF I7G
The 176 who signed the declara
tion also varied in their views:
On the question of transporting
munitions to England on American
flag ships, 73 per cent of the signa
j tories approved, while 27 per cent
I did not agree.
On the question of convoys the
i whole distance, 73 per cent approved,
] and 27 per cent did not agree.
On the question of all-out naval
war, 67 per cent were for it, and 33
per cent did not agree.
On the question of sending land
: forces to the Continent, 16 per cent
! were for it now, 24 per cent for it
later on. and 60 per cent did not
|agree.
The same persons did not approve
'or disapprove the different proposi

tions. Unity is hard to secure!
The second question that I thought
might provoke thought arose from
the statement of the 176: "Opposing
aggression, we heartily support the !
Hoover-Stimson Doctrine (of non- i
recognition of territorial acquisition
by aggression).... As a logical cor
ollary the United States must as- !
sume its share of responsibility for a !
world order based upon international '
law and justice...." As this doc-;
trine was first applied against Japan
in 1932, it seemed. possible to test
where this responsibility reached to i
by a question:
Do you believe we should de- |
mand Japanese retirement from i
China and declare war if she refuses?
On this question 6 per cent of the ]
faculty as a whole were for it and \
94 per cent did not agree.
Of the signatory group 9 per cent !
thought this would be "dynamic de
fense," but 91 per cent did not agree, j
although some thought it should be
done later on.
TIIIIiD POINT
A third point upon which views
would -be very valuable arose from j
the statement by the 176: "Inasmuch |

under our Constitution, is Com
mander-in-Chief of the Army and j
Navy and is responsible for the con- ]
duct of our foreign relations, we as

j support in this period of national
emergency."
It seemed desirable to know how
far Congress came into the picture.
Therefox-e I asked:
f) Do you think Congress should
be asked to authorize such (as the
above) steps before they are taken?
Here entered complicated ques
tions of constitutional and statutory
law and interpretations of Presiden
: tial authority.
CONGRESS' POSITION
Taking the faculty as a whole, 66
per cent were insistent that Congress
should first approve each step, 23
per cent qualified the different steps
or expressed no decided views, 8 per
cent wanted Congress ignored alto
| gether and 3 per cent wanted war

Of the signatories of the declara

Exclusive to The Stanford Daily
Results of a personal poll conducted by Herbert Hoover, Stanford '95,
of some 800 Stanford faculty members including the 17(5 who recently issued
a joint statement in support of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, urging
"dynamic defense," were released in a nationwide exclusive to The Daily
by the ex-President yesterday afternoon immediately before leaving his

campus home for New York. A
Mr. Hoover drew the conclusion
from the poll that GO per cent of the
faculty taken as a whole did not
agree with the statement of the 17(5
signers. The statement urged a "dy
namic defense as the most effective
means of security against the to
talitarian menace."
The statement was drafted by Pro
fessors Eliot Blackwelder, E. A.
Cottrell, Gordon Ferris, Albert Guc
rard, Emile Holman. Graham Stu
art, C. V. Taylor, David L. Webster,
and Lewis M. Terman.
Mr. Hoover's statement to The
Daily follows:
The intense faculty interest in the
present problems of peace and war
was indicated by a statement issued
by 176 members of the Stanford fac
ulty on September 17. Wishing to
get more of the views of a great
thinking group on the questions in
volved, I sent out a questionnaire to
the whole faculty. On this tran
scendency complicated and emo
tional subject, questionnaires are al
ways difficult to formulate, to an
swer, and to interpret the answers.
The percentages have been calcu
lated in the approved polling fash
ion. The results at best indicate
trends.
GENEROUS RESPONSE
The response was extraordinarily
generous—in proportions it took on
the complexion of a national elec
tion not a Gallup poll. Accompany
ing the replies were many most val
uable and illuminating discussions.
One conclusion is that there can
be no doubt of the Creator's triumph
in making all minds different. More
over, the weighting of reason and
emotion is certainly different in each
mind. And the difference between
the facts, constitutional law, and,
public policy, upon which premise is
based, all illustrate the difficulty of
j the problem before the nation.
DISAGREEMENT
I may say at once that 60 per cent
of the faculty taken as a whole did j
not agree with the statement of the
176 signers. And the reasons varied
| greatly.
What I was particularly interested
( in were four very important points j
raised by the declaration of the 176

I on the subject.
first statement
The first of these statements was: I
"Recognizing the fallacy of the idea
that a passive defense is still pos- i
J sible, we support a more dynamic
; policy of action...." This expres- j
; sion of "more dynamic" in connection j
; with defense obviously presupposed
j some sort of military action. I there
fore asked four questions on those
concrete actions which are now un- j
! der debate in the country and which ;
the nation is called upon to deter- i
mine.
a) Do you think we should carry
munitions to England in American- j
| flag ships?
b) Do you think we should con
! voy them the whole distance?
c) Do you approve complete naval
action against Hitler in all waters?
e) Do you think we should send a
land force to the Continent against '
Hitler?
separate results
The results are given first for the
| whole faculty and afterwards for
] the 176 separately.
On the question of transporting
munitions to England 47 per eent> of
the whole faculty favored it, while
53 per cent did not agree.
On convoys, 44 per cent of the
| whole faculty were for it, while 56

On all-out naval action, 39 per cent
j of the whole faculty favored it, while
J 61 per cent did not agree.
On sending an expeditionary force
to Europe. 8 per cent of the whole
faculty favored it now, 9 per cent
| later on, and 83 per cent did not
!agree.
VIEWS OF I7G
The 176 who signed the declara
tion also varied in their views:
On the question of transporting
munitions to England on American
flag ships, 73 per cent of the signa
j tories approved, while 27 per cent
I did not agree.
On the question of convoys the
i whole distance, 73 per cent approved,
] and 27 per cent did not agree.
On the question of all-out naval
war, 67 per cent were for it, and 33
per cent did not agree.
On the question of sending land
: forces to the Continent, 16 per cent
! were for it now, 24 per cent for it
later on. and 60 per cent did not
|agree.
The same persons did not approve
'or disapprove the different proposi

tions. Unity is hard to secure!
The second question that I thought
might provoke thought arose from
the statement of the 176: "Opposing
aggression, we heartily support the !
Hoover-Stimson Doctrine (of non- i
recognition of territorial acquisition
by aggression).... As a logical cor
ollary the United States must as- !
sume its share of responsibility for a !
world order based upon international '
law and justice...." As this doc-;
trine was first applied against Japan
in 1932, it seemed. possible to test
where this responsibility reached to i
by a question:
Do you believe we should de- |
mand Japanese retirement from i
China and declare war if she refuses?
On this question 6 per cent of the ]
faculty as a whole were for it and \
94 per cent did not agree.
Of the signatory group 9 per cent !
thought this would be "dynamic de
fense," but 91 per cent did not agree, j
although some thought it should be
done later on.

A third point upon which views
would -be very valuable arose from j
the statement by the 176: "Inasmuch |

Navy and is responsible for the con- ]

Exclusive to The Stanford Daily
Results of a personal poll conducted by Herbert Hoover, Stanford '95,
of some 800 Stanford faculty members including the 17(5 who recently issued
a joint statement in support of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, urging
"dynamic defense," were released in a nationwide exclusive to The Daily
by the ex-President yesterday afternoon immediately before leaving his

campus home for New York. A
Mr. Hoover drew the conclusion
from the poll that GO per cent of the
faculty taken as a whole did not
agree with the statement of the 17(5
signers. The statement urged a "dy
namic defense as the most effective
means of security against the to
talitarian menace."
The statement was drafted by Pro
fessors Eliot Blackwelder, E. A.
Cottrell, Gordon Ferris, Albert Guc
rard, Emile Holman. Graham Stu
art, C. V. Taylor, David L. Webster,
and Lewis M. Terman.
Mr. Hoover's statement to The
Daily follows:
The intense faculty interest in the
present problems of peace and war
was indicated by a statement issued
by 176 members of the Stanford fac
ulty on September 17. Wishing to
get more of the views of a great
thinking group on the questions in
volved, I sent out a questionnaire to
the whole faculty. On this tran
scendency complicated and emo
tional subject, questionnaires are al
ways difficult to formulate, to an
swer, and to interpret the answers.
The percentages have been calcu
lated in the approved polling fash
ion. The results at best indicate
trends.
GENEROUS RESPONSE
The response was extraordinarily
generous—in proportions it took on
the complexion of a national elec
tion not a Gallup poll. Accompany
ing the replies were many most val

"Recognizing the fallacy of the idea
that a passive defense is still pos- i
J sible, we support a more dynamic
; policy of action...." This expres- j
; sion of "more dynamic" in connection j
; with defense obviously presupposed
j some sort of military action. I there
fore asked four questions on those
concrete actions which are now un- j
! der debate in the country and which ;
the nation is called upon to deter- i
mine.
a) Do you think we should carry
munitions to England in American- j
| flag ships?
b) Do you think we should con
! voy them the whole distance?
c) Do you approve complete naval
action against Hitler in all waters?
e) Do you think we should send a
land force to the Continent against '
Hitler?

The results are given first for the

] the 176 separately.
On the question of transporting

The second question that I thought
might provoke thought arose from

Hoover-Stimson Doctrine (of non- i
recognition of territorial acquisition
by aggression).... As a logical cor

trine was first applied against Japan
in 1932, it seemed. possible to test
where this responsibility reached to i
by a question:
Do you believe we should de- |
mand Japanese retirement from i
China and declare war if she refuses?
On this question 6 per cent of the ]
faculty as a whole were for it and \
94 per cent did not agree.

in 1932, it seemed. possible to test
where this responsibility reached to i
by a question:
Do you believe we should de- |
mand Japanese retirement from i
China and declare war if she refuses?
On this question 6 per cent of the ]
faculty as a whole were for it and \
94 per cent did not agree.
Of the signatory group 9 per cent !
thought this would be "dynamic de
fense," but 91 per cent did not agree, j
although some thought it should be
done later on.
TIIIIiD POINT
A third point upon which views
would -be very valuable arose from j
the statement by the 176: "Inasmuch |
as the President of the United States, j
under our Constitution, is Com
mander-in-Chief of the Army and j
Navy and is responsible for the con- ]
duct of our foreign relations, we as
Americans regardless of party aflilia- ;
i tions, should accord him our unified I
j support in this period of national
emergency."
It seemed desirable to know how
far Congress came into the picture.
Therefox-e I asked:
f) Do you think Congress should
be asked to authorize such (as the
above) steps before they are taken?
Here entered complicated ques
tions of constitutional and statutory
law and interpretations of Presiden
: tial authority.
CONGRESS' POSITION
Taking the faculty as a whole, 66
per cent were insistent that Congress
should first approve each step, 23
per cent qualified the different steps
or expressed no decided views, 8 per
cent wanted Congress ignored alto
| gether and 3 per cent wanted war
| declared now.
Of the signatories of the declara
tion, 16 per cent wanted Congress
ignored altogether. 40 per cent qual
ified on how far Congress should in
tervene, 10 per cent wanted war de
clared now, 11 per cent expressed no
decided views, and 23 per cent
| wanted Congress to first approve
each step.
One conclusion is certain. Our

Exclusive to The Stanford Daily
Results of a personal poll conducted by Herbert Hoover, Stanford '95,
of some 800 Stanford faculty members including the 17(5 who recently issued
a joint statement in support of President Roosevelt's foreign policy, urging
"dynamic defense," were released in a nationwide exclusive to The Daily
by the ex-President yesterday afternoon immediately before leaving his

campus home for New York. A
Mr. Hoover drew the conclusion
from the poll that GO per cent of the
faculty taken as a whole did not
agree with the statement of the 17(5
signers. The statement urged a "dy
namic defense as the most effective
means of security against the to
talitarian menace."
The statement was drafted by Pro
fessors Eliot Blackwelder, E. A.
Cottrell, Gordon Ferris, Albert Guc
rard, Emile Holman. Graham Stu
art, C. V. Taylor, David L. Webster,
and Lewis M. Terman.
Mr. Hoover's statement to The
Daily follows:
The intense faculty interest in the
present problems of peace and war
was indicated by a statement issued
by 176 members of the Stanford fac
ulty on September 17. Wishing to
get more of the views of a great
thinking group on the questions in
volved, I sent out a questionnaire to
the whole faculty. On this tran
scendency complicated and emo
tional subject, questionnaires are al
ways difficult to formulate, to an
swer, and to interpret the answers.
The percentages have been calcu
lated in the approved polling fash
ion. The results at best indicate
trends.
GENEROUS RESPONSE
The response was extraordinarily
generous—in proportions it took on
the complexion of a national elec
tion not a Gallup poll. Accompany
ing the replies were many most val
uable and illuminating discussions.
One conclusion is that there can
be no doubt of the Creator's triumph
in making all minds different. More
over, the weighting of reason and
emotion is certainly different in each
mind. And the difference between
the facts, constitutional law, and,
public policy, upon which premise is
based, all illustrate the difficulty of
j the problem before the nation.
DISAGREEMENT
I may say at once that 60 per cent
of the faculty taken as a whole did j
not agree with the statement of the
176 signers. And the reasons varied
| greatly.
What I was particularly interested
( in were four very important points j
raised by the declaration of the 176
| which it seemed to me might be
I used to draw out the varied views
I on the subject.
first statement
The first of these statements was: I
"Recognizing the fallacy of the idea
that a passive defense is still pos- i
J sible, we support a more dynamic
; policy of action...." This expres- j
; sion of "more dynamic" in connection j
; with defense obviously presupposed
j some sort of military action. I there
fore asked four questions on those
concrete actions which are now un- j
! der debate in the country and which ;
the nation is called upon to deter- i
mine.
a) Do you think we should carry
munitions to England in American- j
| flag ships?
b) Do you think we should con
! voy them the whole distance?
c) Do you approve complete naval
action against Hitler in all waters?
e) Do you think we should send a
land force to the Continent against '
Hitler?
separate results
The results are given first for the
| whole faculty and afterwards for
] the 176 separately.
On the question of transporting
munitions to England 47 per eent> of
the whole faculty favored it, while
53 per cent did not agree.
On convoys, 44 per cent of the
| whole faculty were for it, while 56
• per cent did not agree.
On all-out naval action, 39 per cent
j of the whole faculty favored it, while
J 61 per cent did not agree.
On sending an expeditionary force
to Europe. 8 per cent of the whole
faculty favored it now, 9 per cent
| later on, and 83 per cent did not
!agree.
VIEWS OF I7G
The 176 who signed the declara
tion also varied in their views:
On the question of transporting
munitions to England on American
flag ships, 73 per cent of the signa
j tories approved, while 27 per cent
I did not agree.
On the question of convoys the
i whole distance, 73 per cent approved,
] and 27 per cent did not agree.
On the question of all-out naval
war, 67 per cent were for it, and 33
per cent did not agree.
On the question of sending land
: forces to the Continent, 16 per cent
! were for it now, 24 per cent for it
later on. and 60 per cent did not
|agree.
The same persons did not approve
'or disapprove the different proposi

tions. Unity is hard to secure!
The second question that I thought
might provoke thought arose from
the statement of the 176: "Opposing
aggression, we heartily support the !
Hoover-Stimson Doctrine (of non- i
recognition of territorial acquisition
by aggression).... As a logical cor
ollary the United States must as- !
sume its share of responsibility for a !
world order based upon international '
law and justice...." As this doc-;
trine was first applied against Japan
in 1932, it seemed. possible to test
where this responsibility reached to i
by a question:
Do you believe we should de- |
mand Japanese retirement from i
China and declare war if she refuses?
