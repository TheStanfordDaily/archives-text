# Bolstered by Q-T, Bruins Seek 'Wow Boy' Downfall
## Fawcett or Ditlevsen to Replace Injured 'Hoot' Armstrong in Line-up 
### 
With a now formation, a new backfield coach, and a bunch of spirited
sophs, the West wood Bruins are successfully overcoming the loss of their
negro hackfield stars on which they have depended for an ofl'onse for the
past few years.
The squad which the Farm varsity football team tangles with Saturday

afternoon runs its plays from the
"Q-T," a formation similar to
Messrs. Jones, Halas, and Shaugh
nessy's "T." Bernie Masterson, erst
while quarterback of the Chicago
Bears as well as tutor to Frankie
Albert in the spring of '39, is coach
ing the U.C..L.A. backs, most of
whom are sophomores.
"J" FOR VICTORY
Now that it is definitely estab
lished that "T" stands for victory,
it is just a question of which "T,"
the "Q-T" or the plain "T," will be
the winner.
Last Friday night in the Los An
geles Colisum while the plain "T"
was asleep dreaming about Ducks
and things, the "Q-T" was outpoint
ing the Pullman Cougars, 7 to 6.
Since the Uclans stopped Billy Sew
ell, Washington State's great passer
and the West's leading ground gain
er in 1940, they figure that they can
throttle Albert also.
Sewell only completed three out
of twelve tries during the -entire
Bruin game, one of them toeing for
the Cougars' only touchdown. How
ever, there are a few differences be
tween Albert's situation next Sat
urday and that of Sewell last Fri
day.
Sewell was the whole W.S.C. at
tack so the Bruins could focus their
attention on him without worry
ing about other men. Also the Pull
man line was small and inexperi
enced 1 . Albert, calling signals from
behind Vic Lindskog's shoulder, or
thereabouts, has Pete Kmetovic,
Milt Voos, and either Buck Faw
cett or Bob Ditlevsen to call on to
tote the ball.
With a big, fast, experienced line
in front of him to hold off rushers
for minutes on end, and at least one
clear receiver on almost every play
due to Coach Shaughnessy's intri
cate passing offense, the Glendale
sparkplug will have a sorry day if
he doesn't complete far more than
half his heaves, which get more
accurate every day, almost an im
possibility considering his accu
racy last season.
VARSITY SCRIMMAGES
During the first part of yester
day's scrimmages, Albert worked
with the second and third strings on
the offense .against the fourth and
filth strings. Meanwhile the first
eleven had a delensive scrimmage
against the frosh in which the whole
varsity line came charging in on
every play.
Dr. Fritz Roth, team physician,
announced that "Big Hoot" Arm
strong, first string right half, would
not be able to start Saturday's game.
Armstrong pulled a muscle in his
groin in the season opener when
twelve Oregon players jumped on
him simultaneously during the prog
ress of the game. Either Fawcett or
Ditlevsen will take Hoot's place
when the Curds prune the Bruin this
week-end.
SOPIIS WILL START
George Phillips, Bob Waterfield,
Ernie Case, Clarence Mackey, A1 So
lari, and Ken Snelling, all first year
varsity material, were the men who
made the "T-with-the-guy-on-the
wing - instead - of - in - the - mid
dle" function in its opening per
formance.
Since the Bruins averaged only 2.3
yards per try running against the
Washington Staters, it is expected
that the Westwood team will try to
go over the Indians instead of
around or through, which will prob
ably turn the contest into a scoring
duel rather than a midfield stand--
still. No team has outscored the
scoring Shaughnessy teams since
Coach Clark followed the Santa Fe
trail west in the spring of '40.
