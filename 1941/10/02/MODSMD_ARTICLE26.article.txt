# Frosh Crushed In Scrimmage With Varsity
## 
### 
Mammoth Indians clubbed little
Papooses yesterday afternoon as
Coach Harry Shipkey scrimmaged
his frosh gridders against the might
of Clark Shaughnessy's varsity.
And the yearlings did a first-rate
job against the imposing forward
wall of Hank Norberg. Ed Stamm,
Loren LaPrade, Vic Lindskog, Chuck
Taylor, Bruno Banducci, and Fred
Meyer.
In the mitey freshman eleven were
Dave Brown and Jack Heald, ends;
Bill Young and Harvey Bernhard,
tackles; Jack Sogorka and Bill Si
guardson, guards; Pete Brown, cen
ter; Jim Petitt and Fred Parsons,
halfbacks; Dave Pate, full; and Bob
by Andrews, quarter.
MANY SUBSTITUTIONS
That's the way they started, but
substitutions came and went like
the noon post office rush, and before
the afternoon was over every sec
ond-stringer on the frosh squad was
up and at 'em in his turn.
Cannon Parkinson subbed for An
drews, and both were forced to get
their passes off with ftghtning speed
as the Norbergs and Stamms and
Banduccis converged upon them in
very short order.
Clem Woods alternated with Pate
at the bucking spot, and both turned
in creditable performances against
their big brothers. Woods latched on
to one nifty toss from Parkinson for
a nice gain.
LONG BEACH SATURDAY
Saturday morning at 11:30 the
Papeese take on Long Beach J.C.
The Jaysees slaughtered Bakers
field last season, 23-0, but had a
tough time holding an alumni team
last week, 6-6. Mainstay of the vik
ing backfield this year is Frank
Takahshi, God bless him.
Though only a freshman, the di
minutive quarterback looms as a
star offense man Saturday.
The Viking eleven weighs in at
180, with the backfield at about 173.
Flashy pass plays and quick open
ing line drives will characterize the
Lakewood villagers' type of ball.
Long Beach is coached by Jess
Hill, formerly of Southern Califor
nia, and Irv Phillips, named All -
American in 1928.

The Jaysees slaughtered Bakers
field last season, 23-0, but had a
tough time holding an alumni team
last week, 6-6. Mainstay of the vik
ing backfield this year is Frank
Takahshi, God bless him.
Though only a freshman, the di
minutive quarterback looms as a
star offense man Saturday.
The Viking eleven weighs in at
180, with the backfield at about 173.
Flashy pass plays and quick open
ing line drives will characterize the
Lakewood villagers' type of ball.
Long Beach is coached by Jess
Hill, formerly of Southern Califor
nia, and Irv Phillips, named All -
American in 1928.
Mammoth Indians clubbed little
Papooses yesterday afternoon as
Coach Harry Shipkey scrimmaged
his frosh gridders against the might
of Clark Shaughnessy's varsity.
And the yearlings did a first-rate
job against the imposing forward
wall of Hank Norberg. Ed Stamm,
Loren LaPrade, Vic Lindskog, Chuck
Taylor, Bruno Banducci, and Fred
Meyer.
In the mitey freshman eleven were
Dave Brown and Jack Heald, ends;
Bill Young and Harvey Bernhard,
tackles; Jack Sogorka and Bill Si
guardson, guards; Pete Brown, cen
ter; Jim Petitt and Fred Parsons,
halfbacks; Dave Pate, full; and Bob
by Andrews, quarter.
MANY SUBSTITUTIONS
That's the way they started, but
substitutions came and went like
the noon post office rush, and before
the afternoon was over every sec
ond-stringer on the frosh squad was
up and at 'em in his turn.
Cannon Parkinson subbed for An
drews, and both were forced to get
their passes off with ftghtning speed
as the Norbergs and Stamms and
Banduccis converged upon them in
very short order.
Clem Woods alternated with Pate
at the bucking spot, and both turned
in creditable performances against
their big brothers. Woods latched on
to one nifty toss from Parkinson for
a nice gain.
