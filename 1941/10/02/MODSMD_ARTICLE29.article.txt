# Red Ruffing Pitches Yankees To 3-2 Win in Series Opener
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 1 (UP).—Out of
the long ago, with the weight of 17
years of major league pitching on
his wide shoulders, came old Rufus
the Red Ruffing today to turn back
the challenge of the Brooklyn Dodg
ers and hurl the New York Yankees
to a 3-2 victory in the opening game
of the World Series.
A crowd of 68,540—largest ever to
see a World Series game —packed the
great bowl called the Yankee Sta
dium to the last rafter. They saw
a tight, heart-stopping ball game
and they saw old Rufus the Red, one
of the great pitchers of all time,
walk to the mound in the autumn of
his career and turn in one of his
most brilliant performances.
All afternoon his right arm rose
and fell, burning his high, hard one
through, clipping the corners with
curves, pulling the string and fool
ing the Dodgers now and then with
a slow one.

At times his infield, supposed to
be one c* the bulwarks of the Yank
ees, betrayed him. But when that
happened old Rufus just hitched up
his trousers, pulled down his cap
and bore down all the harder.
It probably will be his last ap
pearance in this series, for he is 36
years old and he needs a long rest
these days. But he gave the Dodg
ers something to remember him by
and an avalanche of noise and
cheers greeted him as he pitched the
final ball and shambled down the
steps to the showers.
As for the Dodgers—well, the be
loved bums never gave up—they
still were fighting for the tying run
in the ninth—but they ran into that
Yankee power that always seems to
explode when the gold and glory of
the World Series is at stake. Today's
triumph was the 19th straight World
Series victory for the Yankees.
