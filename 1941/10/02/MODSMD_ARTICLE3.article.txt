# 'Hello Will Help,' Stresses Jackson
## 
### 
As the 50th Anniversary Celebra
tion comes to a close this week-end,
(he welcoming of the alumni back to
the Farm will get under way on a
large scale.
Since many of the activities of the
celebration were completed during
the summer, this homecoming pro
gram is the only phase in which stu
dent participation must play a vital
part. With nearly 6000 alumni on the
campus, each of them eager to make
the acquaintance of us who arc to
day taking the places they once held,
a friendly greeting by the whole
student body can insure the success
of this concluding event.
I am asking that each of us take a
personal interest in making himself
a student host and put forth an hon
est effort to make that "hello" tradi
tion a real welcome in greeting every
strange face on the Quad.
It's a small gesture, but it'll set
off a friendly atmosphere that's ab
solutely essential to welcoming back
every old grad.
George Jackson,
President of A.S.S.U.
