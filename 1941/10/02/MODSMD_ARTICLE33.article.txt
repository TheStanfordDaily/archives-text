### DON SELBY 
QNE YEAR AGO at this time, Stanford's football team, playing its fust
season under Clark Shaughnessy, was preparing for the second game
|of the season. The Indians had walloped U.S.F. the week before in a
manner that astounded even the most partisan rooters of the Cardinal.
Vet the public just wasn't ready to come right out with the opinion
that Stanford was the team of the year on the Pacific Coast. You
know the rest of the storyâ€”how the Redshirts went on to down the
rest of the outfits in the conference and Santa Clara and how they
trounced Nebraska in the liose Bowl.
But just look at the picture now, as the Cards get in shape for their
battle this Saturday with U.C.L.A. A little different, isn't it?
A year ago no one figured the Indians to do better than win two or
three games. They were surprised. This year Stanford was the prime
favorite to pull a repeat for the conference title, but John Q. Fan was dis
appointed because the Redshirts didn't roll all over their opponents in
the first contest. Now many are waiting to see the Big Red Machine fall
apart, while last year they were waiting to see that same outfit pull some
upsets, for most Stanford wins were upsets until late in the season.
'Sf'unny how change after you reach the top.

OUT SOMEHOW we don't expect to see any team that has the likes of
J Frank Albert, Bruno Banducci, Pete Kmetovic, Freddie Meyer, Vic
Lindskog, Ed Stamm, and Chuck Taylor do any falling apart. Sure, they
may be defeated. All the odds point to that, for undefeated teams are the
exception in this tough P.C.C. But a complete collapse is another matter
and one that isn't to be expected.
Stanford still has everything it had before the season got underway.
And more, too. Take Loren LaPrade, for instance. The big boy from
Phoenix didn't look like a firststringer until Shaughnessy said he was.
It appeared that the loss of Dick Palmer was going to hit the Indians
hard, but from the game that LaPrade played against Oregon, he's
going to be better than Palmer ever was. He's mean, and that's the
way a guy has to be in a game if he's going to play first rate football.
True, the other outfits that play the Indians have had a better chance
to figure out a defense for the T formation, since they can use the pictures

of the Stanford games last year. But +
at the same time it just wasn't the I
surprise that allowed the Cards to !
come out on top a year ago. It was '
man power. And in all save a few
positions, they have the man power
again. Something was wrong against
Oregon. There's no denying that. But
if re polls from the practice held are
any indication, those things that
were wrong then will be right this
Saturday.
