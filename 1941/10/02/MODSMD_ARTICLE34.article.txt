# Maloney Drills Soccer Squad
## 
### 
"The only way to learn soccer is
to play it," says Coach Harry Ma
lonely, veteran Farm director of
minor sports. With this idea in mind
the soccer squad has been divided
into four teams which are played off
against each other.
The team is practicing four times
a week trying to get in condition
for the first game with U.S.F. on
October 18. Each position is at least
four deep so there is keen compe
tition for the front line spots.
As yet there is no first team. The
four teams were chosen at random
with no other view in mind than
having a good even game.
The freshmen as yet do not have
two complete teams, and if enough
freshmen don't turn out Ihe annual
game with the California frosh can
not be played.
The game with the sailors from
the British battleship which is be
ing repaired at Mare Island has been
postponed until Oct. 18.
