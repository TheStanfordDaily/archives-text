# IN MEMORIAM John Pressley Phillips, Jr., '43
## Tragedy 
### 
EVER since men have lived together, the so
called herd instinct has played a dominant
part in the shaping of man's destiny.
Last night the men of the Class of '45 lost
their normal emotional balance and the herd
instinct conquered completely. Such exuber
ance and class spirit is a fine thing when con
trolled.
But last night's frosh-fraternity free-for-all
ended in tragedy —the death of a boy who, in
one short year at Stanford, had become one of
the most popular, one of the best-liked fellows
on the campus.
Everyone who knew Johnny Phillips, and
there were few who did not, knew him as a
friend who always had a smile to spare.
No one is to blame for this terrible accident.
No one could have foretold when the spon
taneous fire of class pride broke out in Encina
that it would end in the death of a fellow
student.
Several freshmen who could see the way the
crowd was going tried sincerely with every
ounce of energy they could muster to divert
the mob away from the Row to serenade Roble.
Needless to say their efforts were to no avail.
The fraternities cannot be blamed for what
might be called "defense of their territory
against the invaders." Nor can the spirit-filled
frosh be taken to task for thier burst of fire.
However, the tragic ending to this year's riot
ing should serve as a bitter lesson to future
classes, one that will not soon be forgotten—
it is impossible to control actions or predict the
consequences when a mass of human beings
for any reason collectively lose their normal
emotional balance.
