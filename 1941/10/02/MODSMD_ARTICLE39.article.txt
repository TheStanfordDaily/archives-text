TO all alumni returning to the University, The
Daily extends a hearty welcome.
In greeting you, Stanford students are the
current custodians of something very precious;
they will feel a deep responsibility and hope
that you find in the Stanford of today the same
spirit which you valued so highly as under
graduates.
Physically, the campus has undergone many
changes. The horizontal staccato of the Hoover
War Libe now breaks into the peaceful vertical
topography you knew. Many automobiles cover
miles of broad highways and this, too, may
cause many of you to lift an eyebrow. Your
mailboxes have probably been often brimming
since your graduation with brochures and pam
phlets proclaiming the vast physical expansion
of the University.
All of these things will be quickly apparent
to you. The Stanford spirit should be in as full
evidence. According to Student Body President
George Jackson, each student is acting now as
a reception committee of one.
We hope that the alumni will find in the Stan
ford of today the incorporation of all that they,
as individuals, brought to the University.—Rose
