BASICALLY common experiences shared at
Stanford are the strongest bonds among all
participants in the Fiftieth Anniversary Celebra
tion, and the magic lamp of memory will be
rubbed many times by alumni to summon these
experiences. Much that meant "Stanford" to
those returning will have faded, will have been

replaced. The lamp will have to be rubbed
hard sometimes.
Alumni will return, however, expecting, find
ing and appreciating change. They will know
that, in most cases, change means progress. But
all things, they are confident, are not transitory.
Among the "Stanfordiana" which they know
will not have passed is this one tradition con
cisely stated:
"A few days after the University opened,
Mrs. Stanford asked the students not to smoke
inside the Quadrangles or on the arched walks
surrounding them. Stanford men and women
have always respected her wish."
Tomorrow night, the Inner Quad will be
thronged with loyal Stanfordites gathered for
gala festivities celebrating the Fiftieth. Of all
times, of all occasions this will be the one on
which those closely identified with the Univer
sity in the past should not have to rub their
lamps. Events that were will be recreated, and
living Stanford customs will be in sharp evi
dence.
These last few years, crushed and singed bits
of white paper have appeared on the Inner
Quad, damning and dirty testimony to the
apparent hopelessness of orienting the "stink
ing one per cent."
Let tomorrow night mark an occasion on
which the force of Jane Lathrop Stanford's
simple wish will compel unanimous respect.
Let tomorrow night also mark our rededication
to the observance of Mrs. Stanford's simple
wish.—Rosemarie Mullany
