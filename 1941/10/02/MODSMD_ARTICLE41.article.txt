# Two Chums

TWO men who have been lifetime chums
since their Stanford life began when they
entered the Pioneer Class of '95 spoke to the
Luncheon Club yesterday. By-passes and repar
tee flew back and forth between two grand old
Stanford men, Charles K. Field and Shirley
Baker, as they reminisced of their days on the
Quad.
The lively, happy contributions of these men,
who represented the Pioneer Class of '95, are
inspirational to those of us now on the Farm.
During their presentations, they sang a duet,
"In the Cold, Cold World." In their audience
was Mrs. David Starr Jordan, widow of Stan
ford's first President. During the moment of
silence following the conclusion of their song,
she said:
"There never was anyone like them."

written by Mr. Fieldâ€”Harold Shafer
