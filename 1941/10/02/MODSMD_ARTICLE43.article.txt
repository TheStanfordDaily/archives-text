# BULL SESSION
## A 						LITTLE STORY 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
| j-JE was from Hutchinson, Kansas, where his father
i ran a hardware store and was one of the town's
leading citizens. His father did an exceptionally fine
business, and the boy had a car when he was only a
junior in high school. A Ford it was, with a rumble
seat and a radio, and always filled with boys and girls.
He wasn't an exceptionally smart student, but he
did have the ability to get grades, and during his high
school career he received an amazing number of A's.
He was by nature a shy, sensitive boy, but this he
covered by always pushing himself forward, by work
ing with a forced energy. He worked on all the school
committees, debated, and was president of the senior
class. Through his activities he made many friends and
in particular a girl with whom he went "steady." On
graduating he was voted "the boy most likely to suc
ceed in after-life."
* # * *
'JpHE next year he came to Stanford as a freshman.
He found himself in Enema without a single
friend, entirely unknown. He started to operate as he
had done in high school, that is to say, he tried to
break into outside activities. He went out for the rally
committee, but was refused. He tried out for the Quad
staff, but felt the work was dull and that he wasn't
getting anywhere. He ran for manager of Encina, but
knowing few of the boys, he received only a handful
of votes and was defeated. He began to lose the con
fidence that he had brought from home. He began to
feel lonely.
And then fraternity rushing started. All the boys
around him seemed to have friends in the houses, and
were being asked up for dinner. But he hadn't any
high school friends in any of the houses. He wasn't
asked up for dinner, but instead had to eat in Encina.
He hated those meals. He hated the boys that ate there
with him. He didn't talk, and didn't want to be seen.
* * * *
then when pledging was over, and he wasn't
pledged, he completely lost faith in himself and
his ability to get along. He came to think of himself
as a failure. He became nervous, irritable. It fol
lowed that he neglected his studies, until one flunk
slip followed another and he was soon minus and
under pressure. He took up smoking cigarettes. He
smoked continuously, one after another. This became
his only outlet from his confused thoughts.
And he began writing letters to his girl in Hutchin
son. For now he wanted to be near Hutchinson and
all its associations, for he liked to think of himself as
he was in that town. At first he wrote only once a
week, but the more he became convinced of his failure
at Stanford the more he needed sympathy and under
standing and the more he wrote to his girl. In his mind
she became something of an ideal, a beautiful, intelli
gent, accomplished woman.
The year ended and he went back to Hutchinson,
i He told his father he was tired of fooling around at
| school, and wanted to get a job and make some money.
| During the summer he married, and his father gave
| him a job in the hardware store

'JpHE next year he came to Stanford as a freshman.
He found himself in Enema without a single
friend, entirely unknown. He started to operate as he
had done in high school, that is to say, he tried to
break into outside activities. He went out for the rally
committee, but was refused. He tried out for the Quad
staff, but felt the work was dull and that he wasn't
getting anywhere. He ran for manager of Encina, but
knowing few of the boys, he received only a handful
of votes and was defeated. He began to lose the con
fidence that he had brought from home. He began to
feel lonely.
And then fraternity rushing started. All the boys
around him seemed to have friends in the houses, and
were being asked up for dinner. But he hadn't any
high school friends in any of the houses. He wasn't
asked up for dinner, but instead had to eat in Encina.
He hated those meals. He hated the boys that ate there
with him. He didn't talk, and didn't want to be seen.
* * * *
then when pledging was over, and he wasn't
pledged, he completely lost faith in himself and
his ability to get along. He came to think of himself
as a failure. He became nervous, irritable. It fol
lowed that he neglected his studies, until one flunk
slip followed another and he was soon minus and
under pressure. He took up smoking cigarettes. He
smoked continuously, one after another. This became
his only outlet from his confused thoughts.
And he began writing letters to his girl in Hutchin
son. For now he wanted to be near Hutchinson and
all its associations, for he liked to think of himself as
he was in that town. At first he wrote only once a
week, but the more he became convinced of his failure
at Stanford the more he needed sympathy and under
standing and the more he wrote to his girl. In his mind
she became something of an ideal, a beautiful, intelli
gent, accomplished woman.
The year ended and he went back to Hutchinson,
i He told his father he was tired of fooling around at
| school, and wanted to get a job and make some money.
| During the summer he married, and his father gave
| him a job in the hardware store
| j-JE was from Hutchinson, Kansas, where his father
i ran a hardware store and was one of the town's
leading citizens. His father did an exceptionally fine
business, and the boy had a car when he was only a
junior in high school. A Ford it was, with a rumble
seat and a radio, and always filled with boys and girls.
He wasn't an exceptionally smart student, but he
did have the ability to get grades, and during his high
school career he received an amazing number of A's.
He was by nature a shy, sensitive boy, but this he
covered by always pushing himself forward, by work
ing with a forced energy. He worked on all the school
committees, debated, and was president of the senior
class. Through his activities he made many friends and
in particular a girl with whom he went "steady." On
graduating he was voted "the boy most likely to suc
ceed in after-life."
