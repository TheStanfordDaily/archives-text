# 'Thunder Stock' Preaches Hope
## Repeat Performance To Follow Rally, 8:15 
### 
"Thunder Rock," a play born in
the mixed-up world of 1939 and
designed to give skeptical humanity
a good dose of hope for the future
through faith in the past, was pre
sented to the students of Stanford
last night in Memorial Auditorium.
The Stanford Players will give a
repeat performance tonight at 8:40
after the U.C.L.A. rally for alumni
and friends of the University.
"Thunder Rock" is a good selec
tion to play for a university au
dience whose faith at this point can
stand buoying up, but whether its
message of propaganda, pure and
simple, took or not is another ques
tion.
Although it's true that nothing in
the past has been so bad that hu
manity hasn't lived through it, it is
rather difficult for the average per
son of college age today to hold
absolute faith for the future when
theie are so many versions of which
"right" should triumph.
"Thunder Rock" is the biggest of
wartime successes in London, and
it still plays to a full house each
night there is no bombing. Perhaps
it has brought faith, hope, and cour
age to a country which before had
only fear. Americans who in their
own minds see through the chaos of
today can appreciate the full signifi- |
cance of "Thunder Rock." This play !
seems designed for people who have
lived long enough in this compli
cated world to have found them- I
selves in a position where hope is i
the last resort.
The action of "Thunder Rock" j
takes place in a lonely lighthouse j
on the shores of Lake Michigan. The i
lighthouse keeper, played admir- |
ably by Norman Philbrick, has taken j
up his job to escape from a world
which he has found detestable. There j
he lives with creatures of his mind
who, each in his own element of
despair, were shipwrecked on the
rock 90 years ago. In explaining to
them how their problems were
solved soon after their deaths, he
perceives the application of his ar
gument to his own escapist ideas.
The torment in his own soul is
solved, and he sets out into the world
again.
It's no play for simpering dilet
tantes. It's a rugged story, but a
pretty one—the kind we'd all like to
believe.
J. P. Cahn and Robert Betten
court were outstanding.—Glasson
