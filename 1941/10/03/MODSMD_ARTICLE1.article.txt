SENATOR Wheeler made another
k specch yesterday. The trouble
with the speech was that when the
Montanan Isolationist wasn't call
ing names and red-baiting and
smearing the smearers of the movie
investigation, he presented a lot of
solid justifiable criticism.
This was 110 spcech for an ex
tremist, because the Senator had
much to say that an intervention
ist would be loathe to deny.
Wheeler indignantly wept out
loud over the prospects of American
boys serving "under some Soviet
Commissar and with Russian sol
diers—under the Red flag of Com
munism at some future date."
* * *
B UT from this curious snobbish
ness toward those who are
America's allies in the struggle
against Hitlerism, the Senator passed
on to a more rational criticism of the
Administration.
"President Roosevelt," he de
clared, "conveniently forgetting
that the Red lords have killed,
murdered, assassinated over 1200
priests and bishops, proudly an
nounced that under their constitu
tion the Russian people enjoy
freedom of religion. How absurd,
how ridiculous, how untrue—in the
light of the facts."
This sort of criticism is not the
same thing as wildly inveighing
against the Administration's foreign
policy, calling the motion picture in
dustry "the modern Benedict Ar
nold," and bandying about phrases
with such unlovely connotations as
"the Red Lords."
♦ * *
WENATOR Wheeler said all these
v things. But whpn ho rritiniznd
President Roosevelt's recent state
ment, he was not propagandizing or
exaggerating.
Even the most ardent New Deal
er can not rationally accept the
statement that a nation that has
for years maintained that "relig
ion is the opiate of the people"—
and has subsequently rid itself of
the drug—is friendly to religion.
And not only isolationists have
wondered at this pronouncement..
Religionists throughout the nation
have been puzzled and shocked.
General reaction to this assertion is
that some radical changes must have
suddenly taken place in Soviet Rus
sia where the Godless Society has
for years been one of the'most active
branches in the government.
The San Francisco News put it
well in an editorial last night.
"Give them (the Russians) guns,
tanks, planes—but keep on say
ing: 'Don't call me brother."'

SENATOR Wheeler made another
k specch yesterday. The trouble
with the speech was that when the
Montanan Isolationist wasn't call
ing names and red-baiting and
smearing the smearers of the movie
investigation, he presented a lot of
solid justifiable criticism.
This was 110 spcech for an ex
tremist, because the Senator had
much to say that an intervention
ist would be loathe to deny.
Wheeler indignantly wept out
loud over the prospects of American
boys serving "under some Soviet
Commissar and with Russian sol
diers—under the Red flag of Com
munism at some future date."
* * *
B UT from this curious snobbish
ness toward those who are
America's allies in the struggle
against Hitlerism, the Senator passed
on to a more rational criticism of the
Administration.
"President Roosevelt," he de
clared, "conveniently forgetting
that the Red lords have killed,
murdered, assassinated over 1200
priests and bishops, proudly an
nounced that under their constitu
tion the Russian people enjoy
freedom of religion. How absurd,
how ridiculous, how untrue—in the
light of the facts."
This sort of criticism is not the
same thing as wildly inveighing
against the Administration's foreign
policy, calling the motion picture in
dustry "the modern Benedict Ar
nold," and bandying about phrases
with such unlovely connotations as
"the Red Lords."
♦ * *
WENATOR Wheeler said all these
v things. But whpn ho rritiniznd
President Roosevelt's recent state
ment, he was not propagandizing or
exaggerating.
Even the most ardent New Deal
er can not rationally accept the
statement that a nation that has
for years maintained that "relig
ion is the opiate of the people"—
and has subsequently rid itself of
the drug—is friendly to religion.
And not only isolationists have
wondered at this pronouncement..
Religionists throughout the nation
have been puzzled and shocked.
General reaction to this assertion is
that some radical changes must have
suddenly taken place in Soviet Rus
sia where the Godless Society has
for years been one of the'most active
branches in the government.
The San Francisco News put it
well in an editorial last night.

SENATOR Wheeler made another
k specch yesterday. The trouble
with the speech was that when the
Montanan Isolationist wasn't call
ing names and red-baiting and
smearing the smearers of the movie
investigation, he presented a lot of
solid justifiable criticism.
This was 110 spcech for an ex
tremist, because the Senator had
much to say that an intervention
ist would be loathe to deny.
Wheeler indignantly wept out
loud over the prospects of American
boys serving "under some Soviet
Commissar and with Russian sol
diers—under the Red flag of Com
munism at some future date."
* * *
B UT from this curious snobbish
ness toward those who are
America's allies in the struggle
against Hitlerism, the Senator passed
on to a more rational criticism of the
Administration.
"President Roosevelt," he de
clared, "conveniently forgetting
that the Red lords have killed,
murdered, assassinated over 1200
priests and bishops, proudly an
nounced that under their constitu
tion the Russian people enjoy
freedom of religion. How absurd,
how ridiculous, how untrue—in the
light of the facts."
This sort of criticism is not the
same thing as wildly inveighing
against the Administration's foreign
policy, calling the motion picture in
dustry "the modern Benedict Ar
nold," and bandying about phrases
with such unlovely connotations as
"the Red Lords."

WENATOR Wheeler said all these
v things. But whpn ho rritiniznd
President Roosevelt's recent state
ment, he was not propagandizing or
exaggerating.
Even the most ardent New Deal
er can not rationally accept the
statement that a nation that has
for years maintained that "relig
ion is the opiate of the people"—
and has subsequently rid itself of
the drug—is friendly to religion.
And not only isolationists have
wondered at this pronouncement..
Religionists throughout the nation
have been puzzled and shocked.
General reaction to this assertion is
that some radical changes must have
suddenly taken place in Soviet Rus
sia where the Godless Society has
for years been one of the'most active
branches in the government.
The San Francisco News put it
well in an editorial last night.
"Give them (the Russians) guns,
tanks, planes—but keep on say
ing: 'Don't call me brother."'
