## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, at his diplomatic best, conducted the
panel discussion en "The Aims of the Nations in the World Conflict," yes
terday afternoon in Memorial Hall.
The discussion, among representatives of nine foreign countries, six of
whom were from the countries they represented, touched more than once

.upon deep-seated controversial is
sues.
The greatest applause went to
Professor Shau Wing Chan, of
China, when he concluded that China
"will gladly join efforts ... to en
gender a world peace founded on j
justice, international good will and
co-operation," in refutation of Pro
fessor Yarnato Ichihashi, who had
just presented Japan's war aims. But
Professor Ichihashi later drew ap
plause when he stated that Asiatic
participation in a League of Nations
could be expected only after Asiatics
were dealt with in a spirit of equal
ity.
ICIIIIIASIII. BRANDT CLASH
Another moment of clash came |
when Professor Ichihashi indicated I
that Dr. Karl Brandt had inferred !
more German control in Japan than I
actually existed; and Dr. Brandt de- j
bated directly, reasoning in conclu
sion, "The German-Japanese alli
ance is not after all an invention of
mine."
Dr. Brandt portrayed the German
war aims as a "welding together of
Europe, Asia, and Africa into a con
tinental empire under German rule."
He ended with a note of hope:
"We and the British can still look
with long-rang telescopes from the
Isles to the European continent and
register the shape the new order is
taking."
Dr. Philip W. Buck began the dis
cussion by stating Britain's case as
a "paradox—a war to regain peace."
Dr. Albert Gucrard next humorously
presented the complex aims of the
various factions in France, and later,
in the iross-questioning, expressed
the opinion that "all empires should
be dissolved."
I SOUTH AMERICA 'SOBERED'
Dr. Graham Stuart emphasized the
disunity of the South American
| countries, but said that "they have
: been sobered" by America's stand.
Dr. Ralph H. Lutz was summoned
from the Hoover War Library to
! speak on the Italian and Balkan
situation; and his conclusion was
that the fate of Italy was linked with
| that of Germany, that she "must
j stand or fall" with German success.
Dr. Rudolf HoLsti, speaking for
| Finland, said, "The war aims of the
! Finnish government are today ex
i actly the same as they have been
! during the last 700 years—for sc-
I curity."
Ihe Russian position was ex
plained by Professor Vladimir P.
I Timoshenko, who ended with the
statement, "We can truly say that
the Soviet government now desires
to protect its territory. But, if it is
j successful, will it stop at this? In
the light of Soviet words and deeds
of the past, we cannot be sure."
Dr. Wilbur concluded the panel
with an appeal for tolerance toward
i international co-operation.
