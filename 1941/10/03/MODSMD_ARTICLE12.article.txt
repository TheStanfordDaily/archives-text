# Rallycom Has Tough Night With O.P.M.
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
The Office of Production Manage- [
ment struck deep at the roots of
Stanford tradition last night, and
then passed on to bigger things
leaving Rally Committee bloody but
not unbowed.
"You," said William S. Knudsen,
speaking through the simple voice of
a simple cardboard salesman, "will
have to stop tearing up your cards
at the games. Also those little mega
phones. Our boys in khaki need that
cardboard for something-or-other."
"Please," pleaded Rally Commit
tee, "it means so much to our morale.
Don't do this horrible thing."
William E. Knudsen, by proxy,
softened.
"Okay," he said, "you can tear up
your red and white cards—but not
one card more. And another thing.
Those victory feathers —we'll give
you some. But ya' gotta pay. Feath
ers are scarce."
Rallycom took the edict. The
feathers will be 011 sale this after
noon and tomorrow morning in the
A.S.S.U. office at 2 cents per. It will
collect all but the red and white
cards after the game.
Then, because the edict habit is
catching, Rallycom passed out one
too. Just a little edict though.
"You men without rooters' caps
land white shirts, and you women
without pompons and white shirts
will sit in the first ten rows. This is
the equivalent of being sent to
Siberia."
