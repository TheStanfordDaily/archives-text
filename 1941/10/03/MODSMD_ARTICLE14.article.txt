# Fires Ignite Indians' Spirit
## Over 7000 Crowd Bruin Game Rally 
### 
Stanford spirit wasn't as easy to
extinguish as the dozens of grass
fires at last night's torch rally in
the Lawrence Frost Amphitheater.
The small fires kept Rally Commit
teemen busy scampering over the
hillsides with extinguishers, and
more than 7000 alumni, students
and faculty members in constant
laughter for 15 minutes.
With his gags punctuated by the
noise of fire extinguishers, Paul
Speegle, master of ceremonies and
former Stanford yell leader, quip
ped, "That's not hissing, they're just
putting out the fire." Speegle, now
a San Francisco Chronicle colum
nist, remembering his years at
Stanford, remarked, "Then there
were only 500 women here, and only
about ten could look into the mirror
without screaming 'it's a lie!' "
A.S.S.U. President George Jackson
introduced Bob Alshuler, U.C.L.A.
student body president, who re
minded the rooters that Stanford had
sponsored the Bruins' entrance to
the Pacific Coast Conference. "How
ever," he asserted, "we're up here to
win Saturday."
A great roar greeted Coach Clark
Shaughnessy, who warned that
U.C.L.A. had upset Washington State,
and would be hard to beat. "Our
team will be some better this Sat
urday," he said, "I hope it will be
enough better to win."
Johnny Lawrey, Rams Head mem
ber, and three stooges from the
crowd*"gave their impression of the
T formation going for a touchdown.
Marching through the opposition
with an unfurled American flag,
Lawrey remarked, "This one will
win every time."
The rally concluded with Speegle's
reminder, "It isn't so hot to have
loved and lost, but it's hell to lose
to U.C.L.A."

and would be hard to beat. "Our
team will be some better this Sat
urday," he said, "I hope it will be
enough better to win."
Johnny Lawrey, Rams Head mem
ber, and three stooges from the
crowd*"gave their impression of the
T formation going for a touchdown.
Marching through the opposition
with an unfurled American flag,
Lawrey remarked, "This one will
win every time."
The rally concluded with Speegle's
reminder, "It isn't so hot to have
loved and lost, but it's hell to lose
to U.C.L.A."
Stanford spirit wasn't as easy to
extinguish as the dozens of grass
fires at last night's torch rally in
the Lawrence Frost Amphitheater.
The small fires kept Rally Commit
teemen busy scampering over the
hillsides with extinguishers, and
more than 7000 alumni, students
and faculty members in constant
laughter for 15 minutes.
With his gags punctuated by the
noise of fire extinguishers, Paul
Speegle, master of ceremonies and
former Stanford yell leader, quip
ped, "That's not hissing, they're just
putting out the fire." Speegle, now
a San Francisco Chronicle colum
nist, remembering his years at
Stanford, remarked, "Then there
were only 500 women here, and only
about ten could look into the mirror
without screaming 'it's a lie!' "
A.S.S.U. President George Jackson
introduced Bob Alshuler, U.C.L.A.
student body president, who re
minded the rooters that Stanford had
sponsored the Bruins' entrance to
the Pacific Coast Conference. "How
ever," he asserted, "we're up here to
win Saturday."
A great roar greeted Coach Clark
Shaughnessy, who warned that
U.C.L.A. had upset Washington State,
and would be hard to beat. "Our
team will be some better this Sat
urday," he said, "I hope it will be
enough better to win."
