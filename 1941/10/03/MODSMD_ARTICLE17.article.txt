# Freshman Hall Mourns Tragic Death on Row
## Over 400 Encinans Hear Dean Speak Of Phillips Tragedy 
### 
More than 400 freshmen last, night
congregated in the huge lobby of
Encina Hall to hear Dean of Men
John Bunn discuss with them Wed
nesday night's row invasion which
resulted in the tragic death of John
Phillips, Beta.
After expressing his regret that
such a tragedy should have to
the beginning of the year, Mr. Bunn
told the freshmen he didn't think it
would be the intent of anyone, in
eluding the Administration, to
blame any one person for this ac
cident.
"It seems too bad some of us have
to resort to physical action despite
the dire possibilities," he said.
HISTORY REVIEWED
He reviewed the history of class
fights and hazing, and showed how
gradually the students of the Uni
versity had realized the folly of such
| traditions and had abandoned them.
| Mr. Bunn concluded the short, but
I somber meeting with the following
questions in the light of the coming
Pajamarino and Big Game festivi
ties, and in a plea for constructive
leadership among the freshmen:
"Is this (referring to last night's
mass raid) the kind of prank you
want?"
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
"Is this the sort of Stanford lead
ership you want to follow or do you
want to discourage it and have cour
age enough to frown on it? Frank
ly, it is up to you to take this re
sponsibility."
It was also reported last night
that the members of the freshman
class had raised by voluntary contri
bution $40 for a floral piece for the
funeral which is to be held in
Fresno Saturday morning at 10:30
in the Stevens and Bear funeral
parlor. All members of the Beta
house will be present at the funeral.
A wreath was placed on the Beta
j front door yesterday morning by
| the Kappa Alpha Theta house.
Meeting informally last night
j Interfraternity Council discussed
I possible plans for setting up a schol
| arship in Phillips' memory. Action
will await the first regular meeting.
John Phillips is survived by his
mother and father, Mr. and Mrs.
John Prcssley Phillips of Fresno, and
a sister, Martha Phillips, '41, former
president of the Stanford Y.W.CA.
