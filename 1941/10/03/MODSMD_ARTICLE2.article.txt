# Shaughnessy Cracks Whip Over T-Men
## Cards Polish Passes For Bruins' Benefit; Fawcett Promoted 
### 
With Coach, Coach Clark, Coach
Clark Shaughnessy, cracking the
whip in an cfTort to bring his foot
ballers out of their self-satisfied at
titude, Stanford's heroes put in al
most three hours of work yesterday
in an effort to reacft perfection by
2:30 tomorrow afternoon when they
engage the U.C.L.A. Bruins in the
Stanford Stadium.
Shaughnessy made his first major
troop movements in over a week
when he put Buck Faweett at the
starting rigUt halfback post, switched
Bill Sheller to second-string right
half from fullback, demoted Bob
Ditlevsen to the third or fourth
string right half, promoted Ben
Morrison to alternating third-string
right half, installed draftless Frank
Forbes in the third-string left half
post, and had Ray Durham calling
third-string signals.
HOOTER AND SCOOTER OUT
These maneuvers resulted indi
rectly from the disability of Hooter
Armstrong and Scooter Cole. Arm
strong, after a five-day layoff due to
a muscle injury sustained in the
Duck drowning last Saturday, will
not be in shape for the game, while
Cole has been absent from practice
since Monday with one of the colds
that have been touring the campus
(sniff).
Shaughnessy spent much time
drilling his pass receivers on their
moves in his meticulous passing
system. Frankie Albert was, as he
has been since the start of practice,
throwing the ball with astounding
accuracy. v
LONE CHALK TALK
The first three strings each took a
turn running back kickoffs against
the reserves. Skull scrimmage took
almost an hour before the physical
work began. Long before the prac
tice had ended the lights of the field
were turned on.
Starting lineup for the game will
probably consist of: Arnie Meiners,
left end; Ed Stamm, left tackle;
Chuck Taylor, left guard; Vic
Lindskog, center; Loren LaPrade,
right guard; Bruno Banducci, right
tackle; Fred Meyer, right end; Al
bert, quarterback; Pete Kmetovic,
left half; Faweett, right half; Milt
Vucinich, fullback.
SMITH OUTSTANDING
According to publicity blurbs
emanating from the Southland,
Lindskog will have his hands full
with Gene Alder, who is being
boomed for little all-America hon
ors. Snuffy Smith, other Bruin
white hope, does his charging from
the end of the forward wall.
Although few of the men who
kept the Uclans within one touch
down of last year's Farmers are
present this year, a sterling group of
sophomores are expected to hold the
underdog's end up.
PASS DEFENSE?
Both of the touchdowns which
U.C.L.A. scored against Stanford
last year were via the long pass
method. Since this was also the
manner in which Oregon scored
twice on the T last week-end, the
long pass will definitely be a factor
which Stanford must pay particular
attention to.
Whether or not the Q-T as devised
by Babe Horrell, Bernie Masterson,
and Ray Richards will afford the
Cards as unsolvable a problem as
the Stanford T afforded the Uclans
last year is a question that will be
; nswered at approximately 6 p.m.
tomorrow.

emanating from the Southland,
Lindskog will have his hands full
with Gene Alder, who is being
boomed for little all-America hon
ors. Snuffy Smith, other Bruin
white hope, does his charging from
the end of the forward wall.
Although few of the men who
kept the Uclans within one touch
down of last year's Farmers are
present this year, a sterling group of
sophomores are expected to hold the
underdog's end up.
PASS DEFENSE?
Both of the touchdowns which
U.C.L.A. scored against Stanford
last year were via the long pass
method. Since this was also the
manner in which Oregon scored
twice on the T last week-end, the
long pass will definitely be a factor
which Stanford must pay particular
attention to.
Whether or not the Q-T as devised
by Babe Horrell, Bernie Masterson,
and Ray Richards will afford the
Cards as unsolvable a problem as
the Stanford T afforded the Uclans
last year is a question that will be
; nswered at approximately 6 p.m.
tomorrow.
With Coach, Coach Clark, Coach
Clark Shaughnessy, cracking the
whip in an cfTort to bring his foot
ballers out of their self-satisfied at
titude, Stanford's heroes put in al
most three hours of work yesterday
in an effort to reacft perfection by
2:30 tomorrow afternoon when they
engage the U.C.L.A. Bruins in the
Stanford Stadium.
Shaughnessy made his first major
troop movements in over a week
when he put Buck Faweett at the
starting rigUt halfback post, switched
Bill Sheller to second-string right
half from fullback, demoted Bob
Ditlevsen to the third or fourth
string right half, promoted Ben
Morrison to alternating third-string
right half, installed draftless Frank
Forbes in the third-string left half
post, and had Ray Durham calling
third-string signals.
HOOTER AND SCOOTER OUT
These maneuvers resulted indi
rectly from the disability of Hooter
Armstrong and Scooter Cole. Arm
strong, after a five-day layoff due to
a muscle injury sustained in the
Duck drowning last Saturday, will
not be in shape for the game, while
Cole has been absent from practice
since Monday with one of the colds
that have been touring the campus
(sniff).
Shaughnessy spent much time
drilling his pass receivers on their
moves in his meticulous passing
system. Frankie Albert was, as he
has been since the start of practice,
throwing the ball with astounding
accuracy. v
LONE CHALK TALK
The first three strings each took a
turn running back kickoffs against
the reserves. Skull scrimmage took
almost an hour before the physical
work began. Long before the prac
tice had ended the lights of the field
were turned on.
Starting lineup for the game will
probably consist of: Arnie Meiners,
left end; Ed Stamm, left tackle;
Chuck Taylor, left guard; Vic
Lindskog, center; Loren LaPrade,
right guard; Bruno Banducci, right
tackle; Fred Meyer, right end; Al
bert, quarterback; Pete Kmetovic,
left half; Faweett, right half; Milt
Vucinich, fullback.
