# NAZI BOMBERS BLAST ENGLAND
##

German bombers today (Friday)
made their most savage attack on
tfit* British Isles in more than three
months as Nazi authorities in occu
pied countries took bloody reprisal
for a mounting wave of sabotage
and the Soviet high command claim
ed successes on all main eastern
front battlefields.
Luftwaffe bombers swept coastal
areas from Scotland to the Straits of
Dover and it was feared casualties
and damage would be high in at
least two towns. Terrific anti-air
i raft (ire and swarms of British
i r.'ht fighters battled the raiders in
bright moonlight.
