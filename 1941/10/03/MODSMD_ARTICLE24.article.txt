# STANFORD-OVER A COUNTER
## 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Having watched Stanford from
behind a counter for the last 15
years, William Gunther, manager of
the Stanford Union Cigar Store,
knows a lot about Stanford in gen
eral.
Gunther came to Stanford to man
age the stand shortly after the Union
was opened. There was no restau
rant then, only a place called the
"Roost," where coffee and doughnuts
were served in the morning. The
Roost was exclusively for men, the
women being consigned the other
wing of the Union, now the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
"It was an atmosphere of spilled
sugar and dirty coffee cups," Gun
ther said. "But the women refused
to keep out. They just elbowed
their way in and stood milling
head into the Roost, look about un
ent Cellar was built, open to all."
FEW WOMEN FN ROOST
In 192(5, very few of the Stanford
women would come out in the open
with their smoking. Those who had
sufficient daring would poke their
head into the Rost, lok about un
concernedly and then receive their
package of cigarettes in a small
paper bag.
"But now it's all changed. Why
last year we sold eleven hundred
thousand cigarettes of one brand
alone. This year it should go higher.
Of all the business done at the stand,
65 per cent of it is cigarettes." â€¢
The magazine rack has been a
more recent addition. All of the
magazines are there by student de
mand. This stand has been endorsed
by the Parent Teacher Association.
There is no magazine there of ques
tionable character, as there is no de
mand for it.
NATIVE CALIFORNIAN
Gunther is a native Californian,
and his son is now flying in the Air
Corps. Before coming to Stanford
he worked as manager of merchan
dise and food supplies at the Hoover
Dam. In addition, he manages the
Encina Store, and the Roble and
Lagunita Stands. All the fraterni
ties and sororities order their sup
plies through his office.
He thinks the funniest thing that
happened was when a match com
pany sent him his supply of paper
matches for distribution with cig
arettes, the matches advertised the
most notorious hotspot in the San
Joaquin valley.
"But I wouldn't want to tell all
the funny things that have happened
at the stand. Most of them are at the
students' expense," Mr. Gunther
said, ringing the cash register as he
made a sale of one of the current
cigarette specials.


WILLIAM GUNTHER, manager of cigarette counter in the Cellar, has
been selling cigarettes to students for 15 years; remembers when
wemen furtively bought their favorite brand and sneaked off with
them in a paper bag so as not to be seen with "the evil weed."
Gunther says men usually base cigarettes purchases on the whims of
their ladies.
