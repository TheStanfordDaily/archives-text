## U.C.L.A. Banks on 'Q-T' As Antidote to Block Shaughnessy's 'T' Attack 
### SAM SALE 
Sports Editor, California Daily Bruin
LOS ANGELES (Special to The Stanford Daily).—Heading a gang of
sophomore stars and counting heavily on a new formation called the Q-T.
Coach Edwin C. "Babe" Hcrrell will field an eleven Saturday afternoon
in the Stanford Stadium that is used to being underdogs—and loves it.

After all, the Indians are the de
fending titlists of the P.C.C. and are
the possessors of a 19-15 win over a
dark horse Oregon team in their
current opener, so why shouldn't the
Palo Alto brigade be favored. But
down here on the Westwood campus
of the University of California theyr'e
snatching up 10-point bets faster
than tickets go at a taxi dance.
The way that the local dopesters
figure tomorrow's contest between
the T and (he Q-T, it should be an
exciting offensive duel between All-
American Frankie Albert and sopho
more Bob Waterfield and Ernie Case,
the Uclan quarterbacks.
OPTIMISM HIGH
And from what the locals showed
last week-end in the opener against
Washington State, it is little wonder
that optimism down south is the
highest since the 1939 season that
saw Kenneth Stanley Washington
lead the Bruins to the top.
The Q-T as seen from the press
box last Friday night was little more
than the man-in-motion attack used
for two years by the Bruins com
bined with the quarterback-under
the-eenter style of play now famed
nationwide thanks to Clark Shaugh
nessy.
BACK ON TRACK
What the 45.000 fans saw last Sat
urday was a passing attack by Wa
terfield and Case that bids to put the
Bruin express back on the victory
track if the Cardinal backs aren't
alert. All-Coast end Milt (Snuffy)
Smith is back, together with two
year letterman Bob Simpson at the
other end. Then there is the matter
of a couple of sophomore wingmen
named Ed Breeding and Burr Bald
win who with Herb Wiener are giv
ing both boys a run for their money.
The Bruins will field a pony back
field regardless of its personnel. The
right halves, all four of them, aver
age about 150. while both starting
quarterbacks are under 185, Case
only weighing in at 155. Fullback is
the heavy spot, particularly with
Phillips in there.
I have no doubt but that Shaugh
nessy has been having trouble get
ting his men in the right mood for
this game, so maybe the visitors can
spring an upset and end a Stanford
victory campaign that began way
back with a win over Dartmouth
after a miserable season two years
ago.

right halves, all four of them, aver
age about 150. while both starting
quarterbacks are under 185, Case
only weighing in at 155. Fullback is
the heavy spot, particularly with
Phillips in there.
I have no doubt but that Shaugh
nessy has been having trouble get
ting his men in the right mood for
this game, so maybe the visitors can
spring an upset and end a Stanford
victory campaign that began way
back with a win over Dartmouth
after a miserable season two years

LOS ANGELES (Special to The Stanford Daily).—Heading a gang of
sophomore stars and counting heavily on a new formation called the Q-T.
Coach Edwin C. "Babe" Hcrrell will field an eleven Saturday afternoon
in the Stanford Stadium that is used to being underdogs—and loves it.

After all, the Indians are the de
fending titlists of the P.C.C. and are
the possessors of a 19-15 win over a
dark horse Oregon team in their
current opener, so why shouldn't the
Palo Alto brigade be favored. But
down here on the Westwood campus
of the University of California theyr'e
snatching up 10-point bets faster
than tickets go at a taxi dance.
The way that the local dopesters
figure tomorrow's contest between
the T and (he Q-T, it should be an
exciting offensive duel between All-
American Frankie Albert and sopho
more Bob Waterfield and Ernie Case,
the Uclan quarterbacks.
OPTIMISM HIGH
And from what the locals showed
last week-end in the opener against
Washington State, it is little wonder
that optimism down south is the
highest since the 1939 season that
saw Kenneth Stanley Washington
lead the Bruins to the top.
The Q-T as seen from the press
box last Friday night was little more
than the man-in-motion attack used
for two years by the Bruins com
bined with the quarterback-under
the-eenter style of play now famed
nationwide thanks to Clark Shaugh
nessy.
BACK ON TRACK
What the 45.000 fans saw last Sat
urday was a passing attack by Wa
terfield and Case that bids to put the
Bruin express back on the victory
track if the Cardinal backs aren't
alert. All-Coast end Milt (Snuffy)
Smith is back, together with two
year letterman Bob Simpson at the
other end. Then there is the matter
of a couple of sophomore wingmen
named Ed Breeding and Burr Bald
win who with Herb Wiener are giv
ing both boys a run for their money.
The Bruins will field a pony back
field regardless of its personnel. The
right halves, all four of them, aver
age about 150. while both starting
quarterbacks are under 185, Case
only weighing in at 155. Fullback is
the heavy spot, particularly with
Phillips in there.
