### DON SELBY 
jpOR some reason or other, a great number of the persons we have talked
■ to about the Stanford-U.C.L.A. grid contest tomorrow have the idea
that Coach Clark Shaughnessy's Indians are going out to vindicate them
! selves.
Vindicate themselves for what? ask we.
The guys won last Saturday's game; they preserved their undefeated
untied status. What more can be asked?
i So let's forget this business of making up for something. Let's just
wait for 'em to go out and tear into the Bruins. And we think that they're
j going to do just that. And win, too.
j Yesterday Shaughnessy turned on the heat. And although that didn't
mean that the boys tore into each other with abandon, it did send the five
| outfits through their stuff in a much snappier manner, as the first three
j outfits took turns running their plays against an outfit which stood dummy
defense.
Because of Eric Armstrong's injury, which, although it has responded to
treatment, will still keep him out of the fray, it appears that Sophomore
Buck Fawcett will take over the right halfback duties when the whistle
sounds to open the game tomorrow. Fawcett has been running with the
first eleven during practice, and he undoubtedly has the stuff to play good
football. Whether or not he will come through is problematical, but if
Shaughnessy thinks enough of him to send onto that first outfit, he must
[ be plenty okay.

' RET YOU can't guess who dropped into the sports office yesterday. Be
fore you start guessing, we might as well tell you it was Lucky Louie.
1 the Pixley prognosticator, who had this to say about this week-end's games
on the Coast:
"Washington is going to start roaring back after the 'Minnesota set
| back to slap down Oregon State, The momentum California gained by
trouncing St. Mary's last week will carry the Bears right on through
j Washington State. Oregon shouldn't have any trouble with Idaho, Francis
! Schmidt or no Francis Schmidt. Although U.S.C.'s injury list is swelling
I with the passing of each day, I'll still take the Trojans over Ohio State.
| Stanford over U.C.L.A. goes without saying."
We went out to cop a cigarette off the nite ed's desk and borrow a
i nickel for a coke to pay off our peerless picker, but when we returned,
I Luckie Louie had flown, leaving a note to say that he'd be back next week,
j Thanks, Lucky.

J scoring touchdowns. And we'd be willing to bet that it takes more than

j outfits took turns running their plays against an outfit which stood dummy
defense.
Because of Eric Armstrong's injury, which, although it has responded to
treatment, will still keep him out of the fray, it appears that Sophomore
Buck Fawcett will take over the right halfback duties when the whistle
sounds to open the game tomorrow. Fawcett has been running with the
first eleven during practice, and he undoubtedly has the stuff to play good
football. Whether or not he will come through is problematical, but if
Shaughnessy thinks enough of him to send onto that first outfit, he must
[ be plenty okay.

1 the Pixley prognosticator, who had this to say about this week-end's games
on the Coast:
"Washington is going to start roaring back after the 'Minnesota set
| back to slap down Oregon State, The momentum California gained by
trouncing St. Mary's last week will carry the Bears right on through
j Washington State. Oregon shouldn't have any trouble with Idaho, Francis
! Schmidt or no Francis Schmidt. Although U.S.C.'s injury list is swelling
I with the passing of each day, I'll still take the Trojans over Ohio State.
| Stanford over U.C.L.A. goes without saying."
We went out to cop a cigarette off the nite ed's desk and borrow a
i nickel for a coke to pay off our peerless picker, but when we returned,
I Luckie Louie had flown, leaving a note to say that he'd be back next week,
j Thanks, Lucky.

J scoring touchdowns. And we'd be willing to bet that it takes more than

jpOR some reason or other, a great number of the persons we have talked
■ to about the Stanford-U.C.L.A. grid contest tomorrow have the idea
that Coach Clark Shaughnessy's Indians are going out to vindicate them

Vindicate themselves for what? ask we.
The guys won last Saturday's game; they preserved their undefeated
untied status. What more can be asked?
i So let's forget this business of making up for something. Let's just
wait for 'em to go out and tear into the Bruins. And we think that they're
j going to do just that. And win, too.
