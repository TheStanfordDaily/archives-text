# Brooklyn Evens Subway Series By 3-2 Victory
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Fanatical faith in "de bums" paid
off with its biggest dividend yester
day when the Brooklyn Dodgers,
miracle champs of the National
League, evened the 1941 World Se
lies with a 3-2 defeat over their sub
way neighbors, the Yanks.
Some 66,248 screaming fans saw
the spirit of Brooklyn, personified in
the triumvirate of Wyatt. Camilli, and
Reese, rise to smite the Yankee vis
ions of a "straight" series and draw
the eyes of every baseball lover in
the country to Ebbetts Field, Brook
lyn, where the Nationals will try it
again today.
For four innings the pitching of
Spud Chandler, New York starter,
kept Brooklyn tied up and the
hearts of the faithful hung heavy.
To add to Brooklyn's distress, the
American League champions hung
up a run in the second and followed
with another in the third.
MLDWICK DOUBLE
In the fifth the revival began.
Chandler walked Dolf Camilli, and
Ducky Medwick started the fire with
a double to left field, putting Ca
milli on third. Cookie Lavagetto
drew a walk, and Peewee Reese,
Dodger shortstop, answered the
prayer in Brooklyn throats with a
hit to Rizzuto at short, who was able
to nail Lavagetto on second, but
Camilli scored.
With Medwick on third and Reese
on first, Chandler peered over the
eight ball to see Mickey Owen.
Dodger catcher, whose average on
the books was not dangerous. But
Owen, no follower of statistics, pro
ceeded to score Medwick with a
single to left field. Wyatt hit into a
double play to end the inning, but.
the taste of victory was in the mouth
of every "bum" and destiny ran its
course.
GORDON ERRS
In the sixth Joe Gordon, Yankee
star of the previous day, threw high
to first, putting Dixie Walker on
first. Then Billy Herman looked
things over for two balls, and let go
with another single, putting Walker
on third with the winning run.
Chandler was through, and Johnny
Murphy, the Yanks' relief pitcher,
took over. But destiny was still in
the Dodger dugout.
Murphy put down Reese, and
Brooklyn groaned. But Camilli
again singled and Walker came
home with the bacon for the Dodg
ers. Medwick followed with a drive
to Rizzuto who caught Herman at
the plate. Lavagetto flew out to the
Yankees' thus far impotent DiMag
gio, but Brooklyn didn't care. Faith
had paid off.

Spud Chandler, New York starter,
kept Brooklyn tied up and the
hearts of the faithful hung heavy.
To add to Brooklyn's distress, the
American League champions hung
up a run in the second and followed
with another in the third.
MLDWICK DOUBLE
In the fifth the revival began.
Chandler walked Dolf Camilli, and
Ducky Medwick started the fire with
a double to left field, putting Ca
milli on third. Cookie Lavagetto
drew a walk, and Peewee Reese,
Dodger shortstop, answered the
prayer in Brooklyn throats with a
hit to Rizzuto at short, who was able
to nail Lavagetto on second, but
Camilli scored.
With Medwick on third and Reese
on first, Chandler peered over the
eight ball to see Mickey Owen.
Dodger catcher, whose average on
the books was not dangerous. But
Owen, no follower of statistics, pro
ceeded to score Medwick with a
single to left field. Wyatt hit into a
double play to end the inning, but.
the taste of victory was in the mouth
of every "bum" and destiny ran its
course.
GORDON ERRS
In the sixth Joe Gordon, Yankee
star of the previous day, threw high
to first, putting Dixie Walker on
first. Then Billy Herman looked
things over for two balls, and let go
with another single, putting Walker
on third with the winning run.
Chandler was through, and Johnny
Murphy, the Yanks' relief pitcher,
took over. But destiny was still in
the Dodger dugout.
Murphy put down Reese, and
Brooklyn groaned. But Camilli
again singled and Walker came
home with the bacon for the Dodg
ers. Medwick followed with a drive
to Rizzuto who caught Herman at
the plate. Lavagetto flew out to the
Yankees' thus far impotent DiMag
gio, but Brooklyn didn't care. Faith
had paid off.

TANFORAN TRACK. SAN BRU
NO. Oct. 2 (UP).—Last Gold, with
jockey Zufelt up, today came from
far back to win the 52500 added In
augural Handicap, featuring the
opening of Tanforan's fall meeting.
Fanatical faith in "de bums" paid
off with its biggest dividend yester
day when the Brooklyn Dodgers,
miracle champs of the National
League, evened the 1941 World Se
lies with a 3-2 defeat over their sub
way neighbors, the Yanks.
Some 66,248 screaming fans saw
the spirit of Brooklyn, personified in
the triumvirate of Wyatt. Camilli, and
Reese, rise to smite the Yankee vis
ions of a "straight" series and draw
the eyes of every baseball lover in
the country to Ebbetts Field, Brook
lyn, where the Nationals will try it
again today.
For four innings the pitching of
Spud Chandler, New York starter,
kept Brooklyn tied up and the
hearts of the faithful hung heavy.
