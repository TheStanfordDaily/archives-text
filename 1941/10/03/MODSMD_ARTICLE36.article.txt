# Strong Card Papoose Eleven Favored Over Long Beach J.C.
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
If actions speak louder than words, the Papoose team will walk all
over Long Beach J. C. tomorrow when the two clubs tangle in Stanford
Stadium at II:.'!',) a.m.—yesterday's practice was "Terrific.
Since last Saturday, when the yearlings successfull,\ opened their sea
son with a 12-0 win over Bakersfield, mentor Harry Shipkey has been

driving the boys hard, and they're
taking to it like ducks to wutex\
The team looks 100 per cent better
than it did a week ago and really
tore through scrimmage.
They've got one new play we j
won't even talk about—it's .so good—
and the rest of the Shipkey reper
toire is polished like a billiard ball.
That one week of workouts has
given worlds of smoothness to the
offensive attack, as well as blocking
and tackling fundamentals.
Bobby Andrews shone during yes- !
terday's bizzness. He hit the mark
with bullet passes and tossed a few
long ones that clicked with clock
like precision.
The Lakewood village eleven thus
far seems a fast club with a forward
wall weighing in at nearly 180, while |
the backfield scales 173.
The Jaysees had trouble tying
their alumni hist week, 6-6, but had
only one week of practice before
hand. They were beaten by Santa
Ana J.C., 13-8. on the last play of a
practice scrimmage, after having
scored in the first few minutes of
play.
In the Viking forward wall are
four defensive standouts: George
Pauly and Jim Hendrickson, guards;
Bob Dahlberg, center, and Pat Mc-
Cune, tackle. All are veterans of
last year's squad and average 200 ■
pounds among them.
In the Santa Ana fracas, the four !
consistently stymied the offensive i
through center.
Stanford is at full strength for the
game, save for Jim McCurdy, who ,
missed the opener and also will |
view tomorrow's struggle from the j
bench. Pete Brown will center for !
the frosh.
