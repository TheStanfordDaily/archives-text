## 
### 
Coach C. Aresmendi of the frosh
soccer team announced today that
1G men had been present for prac
tice. This number gives the frosh
squad barely enough men to scrim
mage against the varsity.
Aresmendi would like to have at
least two strings, 22 men. in uniform,
but so far he has been short-handed.
Several of his men are laid up in
the hospital, which cuts his squad
down to a meager 12 men.
