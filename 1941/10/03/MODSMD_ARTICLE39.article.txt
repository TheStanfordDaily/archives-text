NEWS of the tragic death of John Phillips
cast a pall over the campus yesterday
morning.
The traditional nine and ten o'clock Cellar din
was subdued; customarily cheery knots were
metamorphosized into impromptu memorial
groups. Stanford students felt keenly the death
of one of their fellows. They felt even more
keenly the circumstances of the tragedy.
Activities and attitudes seen for years as
trivial, youthful, and harmless snapped into the
focus of yesterday's news as shameful, callow,
and fatal. The campus puzzled over this disas
ter, the result of a heretofore entertaining com
monplace.
No student at Stanford now will ever see a
similar performance, however harmless, without
consciousness of its disastrous potentialities.
A single life is an exorbitant price to pay for
such a simple lesson.
The price has been snatched from us.
Let us cling to the lesson.—Rosemarie Mul-
