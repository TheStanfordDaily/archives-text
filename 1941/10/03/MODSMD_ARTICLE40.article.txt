# "Yes" and "No"
## 
### 
WHEN Herbert Hoover began tabulating the
results of the six questions he asked the
Stanford faculty, he must have run into great
difficulty. His questions on the United States'
foreign policy could not be answered with a
clear-cut "yes" or "no." To rabid isolationist
or extreme interventionist, a "yes" or "no"
would be possible, but to Stanford professors,
for years trained to carefully analyze all facts
and coinsider all circumstances, such a simpli
fied course is not possible.
Since results of the poll have been released,
many professors have stated they cannot under
stand how "yes" and "no" results could be re
leased in the face of the dozens of qualifications
attached to each question.
The Daily believes some questions should be
answered in the affirmative, others in the nega
tive, but all require qualifications depending
upon future events. No all-inclusive answers are
feasible. But The Daily, as is seen in the
following, does have definite opinions on the
future course of this country.
A. Do you think we should carry munitions
to England in American flag ships?
Yes, but only if absolutely necessary. Use
American ships if the English fleet is so depleted
that England cannot get enough munitions to
continue the war. To prepare for the future, the
Neutrality Act should be repealed.
B. Do you think we should convoy them the
whole distance?
Yes, if necessary, for the reasons cited for
question A.
C. Do you approve complete naval action
against Hitler in all waters?
Yes. We approve naval action in all waters
in which it is deemed necessary to protect
democracy's interests. Such tactical problems
cannot be decided wisely by political contro
versy, but must be left in the hands of those
who know—the President and his advisers.
D. Do you think we should send a land force
to the Continent against Hitler?
No. This is not a fair question, for it fails to
recognize today's problems and needs: (1) The
British empire can supply more than sufficient
troops for present campaigns; (2) as long as an
invasion is not feasible for the English only
22 miles from the Continent it would, at the
present, be suicidal for American armies; (3)
hence, there is no need for an American expe

ditionary force; today England's major need is
material supplies; (4) but if we are to engage
in a shooting war, our navy and air force, not
our armies, will be needed.
E. Do you think Congress should be asked
to authorize steps before they are taken?
Yes, if feasible, however, if war secrecy and
expediency demand immediate fast action, ex
ecutive order is sufficient. This, of course, is
justified in war time and is not unknown to the
United States. Further, except for a declara
tion of war and repeal of existing "hindering"
legislation, congressional action is not legally
necessary. Most powers needed by the Presi
dent today reguire no congressional sanction.
Again, such action would be out of the guestion
in other than critical times.
F. Do you believe we should demand Japa
nese retirement from China and declare war if
she refuses?
No, of course not. Political and economic
pressure should increasingly be exerted on
Japan along the lines of our traditional policy
in the Far East. Increasing military aid to
China is another reguisite. This is the policy
of the administration and so far it has proved
successful.
In summary, The Daily supports the Presi
dent's foreign policy. We may not agree on
every single action, in the manner every ac
tion is executed, or on the men selected to fill
important posts. But if we are not to play into
the hands of our self-asserted enemies, we must
stand together—or "divided we fall."

C. Do you approve complete naval action
against Hitler in all waters?
Yes. We approve naval action in all waters
in which it is deemed necessary to protect
democracy's interests. Such tactical problems
cannot be decided wisely by political contro
versy, but must be left in the hands of those
who know—the President and his advisers.
D. Do you think we should send a land force
to the Continent against Hitler?
No. This is not a fair question, for it fails to
recognize today's problems and needs: (1) The
British empire can supply more than sufficient
troops for present campaigns; (2) as long as an
invasion is not feasible for the English only
22 miles from the Continent it would, at the
present, be suicidal for American armies; (3)
hence, there is no need for an American expe

ditionary force; today England's major need is
material supplies; (4) but if we are to engage
in a shooting war, our navy and air force, not
our armies, will be needed.
E. Do you think Congress should be asked
to authorize steps before they are taken?
Yes, if feasible, however, if war secrecy and
expediency demand immediate fast action, ex
ecutive order is sufficient. This, of course, is
justified in war time and is not unknown to the
United States. Further, except for a declara
tion of war and repeal of existing "hindering"
legislation, congressional action is not legally
necessary. Most powers needed by the Presi
dent today reguire no congressional sanction.
Again, such action would be out of the guestion
in other than critical times.
F. Do you believe we should demand Japa
nese retirement from China and declare war if
she refuses?
No, of course not. Political and economic
pressure should increasingly be exerted on
Japan along the lines of our traditional policy
in the Far East. Increasing military aid to
China is another reguisite. This is the policy
of the administration and so far it has proved
successful.
In summary, The Daily supports the Presi
dent's foreign policy. We may not agree on
every single action, in the manner every ac
tion is executed, or on the men selected to fill
important posts. But if we are not to play into
the hands of our self-asserted enemies, we must
stand together—or "divided we fall."

WHEN Herbert Hoover began tabulating the
results of the six questions he asked the
Stanford faculty, he must have run into great
difficulty. His questions on the United States'
foreign policy could not be answered with a
clear-cut "yes" or "no." To rabid isolationist
or extreme interventionist, a "yes" or "no"
would be possible, but to Stanford professors,
for years trained to carefully analyze all facts
and coinsider all circumstances, such a simpli
fied course is not possible.
Since results of the poll have been released,
many professors have stated they cannot under
stand how "yes" and "no" results could be re
leased in the face of the dozens of qualifications
attached to each question.
The Daily believes some questions should be
answered in the affirmative, others in the nega
tive, but all require qualifications depending
upon future events. No all-inclusive answers are
feasible. But The Daily, as is seen in the
following, does have definite opinions on the
future course of this country.
A. Do you think we should carry munitions
to England in American flag ships?
Yes, but only if absolutely necessary. Use
American ships if the English fleet is so depleted
that England cannot get enough munitions to
continue the war. To prepare for the future, the
Neutrality Act should be repealed.
B. Do you think we should convoy them the
whole distance?
Yes, if necessary, for the reasons cited for
question A.
C. Do you approve complete naval action
against Hitler in all waters?
Yes. We approve naval action in all waters
in which it is deemed necessary to protect
democracy's interests. Such tactical problems

necessary. Most powers needed by the Presi
dent today reguire no congressional sanction.
Again, such action would be out of the guestion
in other than critical times.
F. Do you believe we should demand Japa
nese retirement from China and declare war if
she refuses?
No, of course not. Political and economic
pressure should increasingly be exerted on
Japan along the lines of our traditional policy
in the Far East. Increasing military aid to
China is another reguisite. This is the policy
of the administration and so far it has proved
successful.
In summary, The Daily supports the Presi
dent's foreign policy. We may not agree on
every single action, in the manner every ac
tion is executed, or on the men selected to fill
important posts. But if we are not to play into
the hands of our self-asserted enemies, we must
stand together—or "divided we fall."

elected President.
He has been named by the people to lead; he
must be trusted.—Herman Silverman
WHEN Herbert Hoover began tabulating the
results of the six questions he asked the
Stanford faculty, he must have run into great
difficulty. His questions on the United States'
foreign policy could not be answered with a
clear-cut "yes" or "no." To rabid isolationist
or extreme interventionist, a "yes" or "no"
would be possible, but to Stanford professors,
for years trained to carefully analyze all facts
and coinsider all circumstances, such a simpli
fied course is not possible.
Since results of the poll have been released,
many professors have stated they cannot under
stand how "yes" and "no" results could be re
leased in the face of the dozens of qualifications
attached to each question.
The Daily believes some questions should be
answered in the affirmative, others in the nega
tive, but all require qualifications depending
upon future events. No all-inclusive answers are
feasible. But The Daily, as is seen in the
following, does have definite opinions on the
future course of this country.
A. Do you think we should carry munitions
to England in American flag ships?
Yes, but only if absolutely necessary. Use
American ships if the English fleet is so depleted
that England cannot get enough munitions to
continue the war. To prepare for the future, the
Neutrality Act should be repealed.
B. Do you think we should convoy them the
whole distance?
Yes, if necessary, for the reasons cited for
question A.
C. Do you approve complete naval action
against Hitler in all waters?
Yes. We approve naval action in all waters
in which it is deemed necessary to protect
democracy's interests. Such tactical problems
cannot be decided wisely by political contro
versy, but must be left in the hands of those
who know—the President and his advisers.
D. Do you think we should send a land force
to the Continent against Hitler?
No. This is not a fair question, for it fails to
recognize today's problems and needs: (1) The
British empire can supply more than sufficient
troops for present campaigns; (2) as long as an
invasion is not feasible for the English only
22 miles from the Continent it would, at the
present, be suicidal for American armies; (3)
hence, there is no need for an American expe

ditionary force; today England's major need is
material supplies; (4) but if we are to engage
in a shooting war, our navy and air force, not
our armies, will be needed.
E. Do you think Congress should be asked
to authorize steps before they are taken?
Yes, if feasible, however, if war secrecy and
expediency demand immediate fast action, ex
ecutive order is sufficient. This, of course, is
justified in war time and is not unknown to the
United States. Further, except for a declara
tion of war and repeal of existing "hindering"
legislation, congressional action is not legally
necessary. Most powers needed by the Presi
dent today reguire no congressional sanction.
Again, such action would be out of the guestion
in other than critical times.
F. Do you believe we should demand Japa
nese retirement from China and declare war if
she refuses?
No, of course not. Political and economic
pressure should increasingly be exerted on
Japan along the lines of our traditional policy
in the Far East. Increasing military aid to
China is another reguisite. This is the policy
of the administration and so far it has proved
successful.

tion is executed, or on the men selected to fill
important posts. But if we are not to play into
