### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
JOHN
j.JE was from Fresno and his name was John. He
lived in a large, brown, friendly house, that had
grass and shrubs and tall trees all around it. When
ever I passed the house, I used to call to him because
he would always be in the yard, watering, digging, or
raking the leaves.
He had a chubby little brother that looked just like
him, and a sister, and a father that wore a sweater
and a mother that was so sweet and kind and inter
ested in her children that she reminded me of few
mothers in this modern world. Together they lived in
this brown house, in the cheeriest, friendliest, warmest
atmosphere that there could possibly be.
He was a success in almost all that he did. His
round, bright face attracted friends, and he was al
ways cheerful and happy, and his happiness radiated
out and affected all those who were near him. And
when he laughed his face would get all red, and he
would shake with his whole body and his head until
he couldn't talk because he shook so much.

John also had a girl whom he used to see and
talk with, and take to a show. He liked her and
they both looked so nice together that everyone smiled
when they saw them.
When he came to Stanford, he enjoyed the same
success that he had in his home town. He was an en
ergetic worker. He wasn't the flashy, showy type, but
whatever he set out to do was done. He was an Econ
major, a junior in school, with only a few years left
before he would be out to start the real part of his
life. The future certainly looked bright for him.
But it wasn't to be. The Lord decided that his time
had come. He decided that it would be best for the
world if John were lifted from it, and on an unim
portant Wednesday, in a foolish way, he was lifted just
when he was beginning to mature, beginning to under
stand what it meant to be a person alive in the world.

jpOR two days now I have been trying to figure the
whole thing out. 1 have been trying to under
stand the Lord and His ways, but I have only become
more confused. I don't understand it, I can't see the
reasoning, I don't believe it.
Every time I think, I think the word "why," and I
can't find the answer. Maybe the Lord got mixed up.
Maybe He thought He was taking someone else, not
John. I hope that some time the Lord will look down
at that brown house in Fresno. I hope that He can
see, like I can see, the family sitting down to dinner,
eating and talking, and laughing, but suddenly remem
bering and looking at the empty seat and then quietly
sobbing. I know that if He sees this like I see it, He
won't make a mistake like that again.
