MR. WILLKIE DEFENDED

r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
. . student leaders in a good position to feel
the political pulse of the nation's campuses believe the
general feeling to be that Willkie has let his student
followers down." This summarizes a survey, sup
ported on vague authority, reported in Monday's Daily.
But it is my opinion that explanations quoted over
looked several relevant considerations.
In the first place, Willkie was accused of political
maneuvering confusing to his followers and the GOP.
There is no doubt in my mind that the former candi
date supported an aid-to-Britain policy during the
campaign, as he does now. His only approval of bel
ligerent action —convoying—did not come until the
Gallup Poll showed a majority of the people to be in
favor of such action.
As isolationist Senator "Champ" Clark recently ad
mitted publicly, the only campaign statement to which
Willkie's "campaign oratory" remark can be referred
was his "war by April if Roosevelt is re-elected" pre
diction. While such a prediction is obviously unre
liable and dangerous, and Willkie can be criticized for
making it, there were nevertheless many people, my
self included, who were convinced at the time that an
all-out war would follow a Roosevelt victory.
Perhaps Willkie's announcement that he will sup
port only "internationalistic" Republicans in '42 does
smack of "purge." But as I am led to believe, Willkie
will say nothing against those individual Republicans
who refuse to support that view, which is certainly a
strong deviation from the Roosevelt "purge" to which
the action is being compared.
Willkie may be losing favor among students, but a
recent Gallup Poll reports Willkie would be the lead
ing candidate (not considering FR) of all parlies if an
election were held today. Taft, most popular isola
tionist. was rated seventh.
