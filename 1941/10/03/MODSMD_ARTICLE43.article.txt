# Dr. Bailey Writes Forward To New Writers' Collection
## 
### 
"Stanford Writers, 181)1-1041," published by Dramatists' Alliance, with
foreword hy Margery Bailey.
As a tribute to Stanford's Fiftieth Anniversary, the Dramatists' Alli
,ance lias compiled a collcction of the undergraduate writings of 17 of
the Farm's most significant and famous writers. Only 300 copies of the

book were printed, since the
tists' Alliance apparently has a very
real knowledge of its somewhat lim
ited public; but, for those who have I
a sincere pride in Stanford and its i
children ,the book has great value.
Then, too, the early writings of j
great men and women —good and |
bad—are of both sentimental and I
critical interest.
Among the authors represented j
are Maxwell Anderson, Archie
Binns, Bruce Bliven, Will and, Wal
lace Irwin, Robin Lampson, David
Lamson, and John Steinbeck. These,
of course, are the most famous; |
others who are in newspaper, screen, I
or academic work are no less signifi- i
cant, but less well known.
Critically speaking, the represen
tative works are, as a whole, deriva
tive, but in many cases the mature j
style of the writer shows through. I
Steinbeck's "Fingers of Cloud,"
written in 1924, is an interesting
example of this.
Each author's selection is followed \
by an exhaustive bibliography of hi.s
publications, and of criticisms of j
his work. And to Dr. Bailey, who !
chose the works and handled the ■
bulk of publication duties, a special j
thank you.—Nowell
