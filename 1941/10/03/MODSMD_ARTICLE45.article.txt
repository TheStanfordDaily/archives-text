# Leave Cars Home, Avoid Traffic Jam
## 
### 
In an effort to relieve traffic
congestion around the stadium
hotli before and after tomorrow's
game, the Board of Athletic Con
trol appealed to students and oth
ers living on campus to leave their
cars at home and walk to the
game.
The request was made in view
of the tremendous influx of visi
tors and returning alumni who
will be present for the game.
