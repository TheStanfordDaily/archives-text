brook Pegler doesn't love any
body or anything—least of all Wil
liam Green (The Workers' Friend)
and the A. F. of L.
For about six months Mr. Peg
ler, who writes daily for hundreds
of newspapers, has been giving
The Workers' Friend a pretty
rough time of it.
Every day. For six months. Read
ing time approx. five minutes.

jVf 11. PEGLER says that the execu
tive ranks of the A. F. of L.
are crawling with every conceivable
form of vermin from pickpockets to
white-slavers, in a variety of colors
too from pink to dark, dark red.
Mr. Pegler has charged that The
Workers' Friend stands at the
head of an organization of racket
eers, gangsters, potential fascists,
thugs, and common wife-heaters.
He has consistently reiterated the
fact that William Green knows all
this, and is therefore neck-deep in
the whole rotten business.

JVJR. PEGLER has not merely been
muck-raking bccause he has a
nasty disposition. He has document
ed his charges with facts and figures
and has pulled many an A. F. of L.
skeleton out of many a closed shop.
Last year "Peg" won the Pu
litzer Price for his expose of the
filth in American Labor's politics.
All last week the executive council
of the A. F. of L. has been conven
tioning in Seattle. Presumably Mr.
Pegler's name came up, accompa
nied by all sorts of unprintable com
ments. Because Mr. Pegler has
raised an issue—an issue which de
manded an answer.

| AST night the executive council
issued its annual report. The
executives (who are the objects of
Pegler's name-calling) said that "it
(the council) disavows and repudi
ates with all the power at its com
mand the lawlessness of any char
acter, racketeering in any form and
exploitation wherever practiced."
The council said further that the
Federation could not attempt to
regulate its international unions.
"Such procedure is no part of the
administrative policy of the A. F. of
L.," said the report.
Daddy, what is an executive coun
cil for?

r J n HE sixteenth week of the Russo-
German war began yesterday
with a terrific German aerial bom
bardment along the entire thousand
mile front. Reports from Berlin in
dicated that this was the prelude to
annihilation which Hitler spoke of
last Friday.
If this is true, then the Nazis are
launching a new offensive directed
toward Kharkov, and the Donets
Basin, and Rostov at the north
easternmost end of the Sea of
Azov.
Communiques from the German
High Command were extremely
fuzzy, naming no names, citing no
specific locales of action. The Rus
sian reports confirmed the aerial
attacks.
* * *
r J I IIE Russians claimed that their
counter-attacks —notably around
Leningrad and the Crimea — were
gaining momentum and gradually
hurling the Nazis back. They re
ported the capture of 30 towns.
German sources acknowledged
the renewed Russian resistance
but claimed that 011 all fronts the
Reds were repulsed with many
losses.
In short, last night's war com
muniques were nothing but a legion
of glittering and exasperating gen
eralities with both Russians and
Germans knocking the living day
lights out of the other.
Both sides issued a lot of figures
on the number of dead, dying,
wounded, destroyed tanks, planes,
guns.
Everybody is lying.
