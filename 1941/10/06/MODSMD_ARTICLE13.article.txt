# Iceland Troops Want More News, Liquor
## 
### 
REYKJAVIK, Iceland, Oct. 5 (UP).
—This city is bursting at the seams
like Louisville on derby eve and is
suffering from a shortage of two
popular American commodities —
news and liquor.
The American troops stationed
here say it reminds them of their
own country during prohibition.
The only drink sold in public is a
thin, watery Iceland beer.
