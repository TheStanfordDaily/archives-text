### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
With 1940-41 profits reaching an j
unexpected high, the Stanford Book
store is presenting the University a
$5,000 gift. Dr. B. F. Haley, president
of the Bookstore board of directors,
announced today.
The $5,000 gift will be divided in
three parts: $2,000 to the Commis
sion for Student Aid, $1,500 to the

Scholarship Committee, and $1,500
will be added to the Stanford Book- I
store Loan Fund.
REBATES DISTRIBUTED
In addition to this gift, $5,600 was
distributed last spring to students
and faculty in the form of a 6 per
] cent rebate on purchases made dur
| ing the preceding four quarters,
Although audit of the books has
not yet been completed an additional
profit is expected.
"It's only a guess," Dr. Haley
said, "but there probably will be a
Iprogt balance of $1,500 or $2,000."
FOR RAINY DAY
This will be placed in reserve in
| order to maintain the 6 per cent re-
I bate in the future, Dr. Haley ex
plained. The reserve will also pro
! tect the Bookstore in any future I
j emergency, he added.
In the last school year, the Book- !
| store grossed $175,000. This is an in
i crease of $9,000 over the preceding
year. Rebates for 1940-41 amounted
to $1,430 more than the preceding
I year, when rebates were distributed
' for the first time in recent years.
"The rebate system, more pros
perous times, and the excellent job
of merchandising being done by the
staff accounts for the increased
business," Dr. Haley pointed out.
FOUNDED BY 25 PROFS
The present Bookstore was found
ed several decades ago, after a stu
dent-operated store had failed. The
administration considered opening a
store, but 25 professors banded to
gether, forming a stock company,
and the present Bookstore was es
tablished.
Each professor bought a share of
stock—now the A.S.S.U. is also a
stockholder—and in turn, the stock
holders elected a five-man board to
administer the store. The board
names the manager, decides policy,
and is responsible for its operation.
No dividends are issued to the
stockholders, and faculty members
serve-without pay.
