# Indians Head for Bowl After Ruining Bruins; P.C.C. Rivals Defeated
## Stanford Scores in Every Quarter As Kmetovic, Vucinich Rip U.C.L.A. Line in 33-0 Farce; Meiners Okay 
### H. D. THOREAU III 
II is beginning to look as if life was just a Howl of Roses for thq S. and
S. (Stanford and Shaughncssy) football team since a quick look at the
P.C.C. standings shows only Montana's Grizzlies between the Indians and
an eighth trip to Pasadena. This is the startling situation after Saturday's
whiz-hoom games headed by the Cards' potential finally becoming actual

as they out-everythingcd the U.C -
L.A. Bruins, 33 to 0, in the local
stadium.
Since Stanford doesn't meet Mon
tana on the present schedule, local
followers will just have to hope
that some other team upsets the
Grizzlies during their stiff nine
game schedule. Next week they
meet the highly touted Q-T from
Westwood. It will take a potent
team like the Bruins to turn the
trick, since the Grizzlies have al
ready swamped B.Y.U. and N.D.
State in their ferocious charge to
ward their first conference cham
pionship since the days when Gen
eral Custer was calling signals
against the First of the Mohicans in
the Dust Bowl.
QUICK SCORES
Against a background of ardent
rooters yelling, "Take off that . .
"Where's your bell?" "Hooray Coast
Guard," "Roar, roar, roar, L.S. Jun-
IOR," "Where's Will Connolly," and
other allied subjects which had not
too much to do with the game going
on in front of them, Stanford's first;
team lost no time in establishing
their superiority over the Uclans.
U.C.L.A. Co-captain Ted Forbes
ran Ken Robesky's kickofT back all
the way into Indian territory. How
ever, the Bruin attack bogged down
and a short punt gave Stanford the
ball on their own 20-yard line. Mill
Vucinich, rejuvenated fullback,
pushed his way through the middle
of the Bruin line for a first down;
Frankie Albert, everybody's All-
American, snuck a flat pass to Pete
Kmetovic, a lot of people's All-
American, which netted 33 yards;
two slashes by Perfect Pete and one
by Voos put the ball on the one;
Albert, leading scorer in the confer
ence with 22 points, snuck it over for
6 and kicked it through for 1 more,
"it" being the ball.
VOOS TRAVELS
The next score was set up Al
bert's 63-yard punt to the Bruin
five. After a four-yard loss by Buck
Fawcett, soph halfback who took
the injured Eric Armstrong's place,
Kmet made 15; Vucinich went
through the middle and instead of
being dropped when surrounded by
Bruin tacklers, he kept going 21
yards to a touchdown, due to his
own driving power and due to nice
downfield blocking.
Along about the first of the second
quarter Coach Clark received a blow
when both Hank Norberg and Ar
nie Meiners were injured within th:-
space of a few minutes. Meiners will
be ready this week, but Hank's liga
ment injury will probably keep him
out for over a week.
The team, however, managed to
i struggle along, scoring another
| touchdown in the first half after a
| pass-interference penalty and a too
many-time-outs penalty had put the
ball on the Uclan 18-inch line. Al
bert had thrown a long one to Ro;.<
Laverty in the end zone. The ref,
Tom Fitzpatrifck, decided that Lav
erty's chances of getting the pass
| would have been increased consid
! erably had Bruin A1 Solari not been
j riding on his back.
Opening the second half the Big
i Red would have been content to
let things slide along as they were
had the Bruins done the same, bul
the Q-T finally generated a little
offense clown to the Card 19. Water
field, who had been leading the
Bruins throughout the game, pitched
one into the flat. No Southerner was
there to receive, so Albert oblig
ingly caught it. Fifty-eight yards
later, all the other way, Albert was
knocked out of bounds. Two of
Albert's dentals were almost knocked
out of bounds on the play.
An eight-yard jab by Voos set the
stage for an Albert to Kmetovic lat
eral play that netted 30 yards. Cap
tain Freddie Meyer made the tell
ing block in Kmet's run, eliminated
a swarm of opposing players from
contention. A half-dozen more stood
between Pete and tlie goal line in
a five-yard strip down the sideline.
They evidently weren't enough since
the score was made without the
chalk of the sideline w sing raised
except by the befuddled Bruins.
SOUP' SUBSTITUTES
From then on Mr. Shaughnessy
kept the man up the press box who
was keeping substitutions busier
than a no - armed paper-hanger.
Along in the waning minutes of
play he landed on the combination
of Ray Durham calling them and
Lee Brick-a-brack running them,
Brick-a-brack — his mother calls
him Bickenbach—after two fumbles
scored the 27th to 33rd points, in
clusive.
Albert, Kmetovic, Chuck Taylor,
;yid Meyer, who pushed Bruin all
coast end Milt Smith all over the
field, played Ail-American ball all
through the game. While it was
passing that put the Indians ahead
oi Oregon in the opener, running was
the main weapon Saturday with the
passes used only as a defense Open
er-uper. The weakness at fullback
which cropped up against the Ducks
was completely overcome by the
showing of Vucinich and Bill Sheller
today.
Under the slogan "T for Too-
Good-for-the-Opposition" the squad
will head for Corvallis this week to
play the up-and-down Beavers from
the Oregon State College of Agricul
ture. Although they don't have a
Q-T or Z-T formation, they must
have something to be able to "Husk
the Huskies."

ward their first conference cham
pionship since the days when Gen

against the First of the Mohicans in
the Dust Bowl.
QUICK SCORES
Against a background of ardent
rooters yelling, "Take off that . .
"Where's your bell?" "Hooray Coast
Guard," "Roar, roar, roar, L.S. Jun-
IOR," "Where's Will Connolly," and
other allied subjects which had not
too much to do with the game going
on in front of them, Stanford's first;
team lost no time in establishing
their superiority over the Uclans.
U.C.L.A. Co-captain Ted Forbes
ran Ken Robesky's kickofT back all
the way into Indian territory. How
ever, the Bruin attack bogged down
and a short punt gave Stanford the
ball on their own 20-yard line. Mill
Vucinich, rejuvenated fullback,
pushed his way through the middle
of the Bruin line for a first down;
Frankie Albert, everybody's All-
American, snuck a flat pass to Pete
Kmetovic, a lot of people's All-
American, which netted 33 yards;
two slashes by Perfect Pete and one
by Voos put the ball on the one;
Albert, leading scorer in the confer
ence with 22 points, snuck it over for
6 and kicked it through for 1 more,
"it" being the ball.
VOOS TRAVELS
The next score was set up Al
bert's 63-yard punt to the Bruin
five. After a four-yard loss by Buck
Fawcett, soph halfback who took
the injured Eric Armstrong's place,
Kmet made 15; Vucinich went
through the middle and instead of
being dropped when surrounded by
Bruin tacklers, he kept going 21
yards to a touchdown, due to his
own driving power and due to nice
downfield blocking.
Along about the first of the second
quarter Coach Clark received a blow
when both Hank Norberg and Ar
nie Meiners were injured within th:-
space of a few minutes. Meiners will
be ready this week, but Hank's liga
ment injury will probably keep him
out for over a week.
The team, however, managed to
i struggle along, scoring another
| touchdown in the first half after a
| pass-interference penalty and a too
many-time-outs penalty had put the
ball on the Uclan 18-inch line. Al
bert had thrown a long one to Ro;.<
Laverty in the end zone. The ref,
Tom Fitzpatrifck, decided that Lav
erty's chances of getting the pass
| would have been increased consid
! erably had Bruin A1 Solari not been
j riding on his back.
Opening the second half the Big
i Red would have been content to
let things slide along as they were
had the Bruins done the same, bul
the Q-T finally generated a little
offense clown to the Card 19. Water
field, who had been leading the
Bruins throughout the game, pitched
one into the flat. No Southerner was
there to receive, so Albert oblig
ingly caught it. Fifty-eight yards
later, all the other way, Albert was
knocked out of bounds. Two of
Albert's dentals were almost knocked
out of bounds on the play.
An eight-yard jab by Voos set the
stage for an Albert to Kmetovic lat
eral play that netted 30 yards. Cap
tain Freddie Meyer made the tell
ing block in Kmet's run, eliminated
a swarm of opposing players from
contention. A half-dozen more stood
between Pete and tlie goal line in
a five-yard strip down the sideline.
They evidently weren't enough since
the score was made without the
chalk of the sideline w sing raised
except by the befuddled Bruins.
SOUP' SUBSTITUTES
From then on Mr. Shaughnessy
kept the man up the press box who
was keeping substitutions busier
than a no - armed paper-hanger.
Along in the waning minutes of
play he landed on the combination
of Ray Durham calling them and
Lee Brick-a-brack running them,
Brick-a-brack — his mother calls
him Bickenbach—after two fumbles
scored the 27th to 33rd points, in
clusive.
Albert, Kmetovic, Chuck Taylor,
;yid Meyer, who pushed Bruin all
coast end Milt Smith all over the
field, played Ail-American ball all
through the game. While it was
passing that put the Indians ahead
oi Oregon in the opener, running was
the main weapon Saturday with the
passes used only as a defense Open
er-uper. The weakness at fullback
which cropped up against the Ducks
was completely overcome by the
showing of Vucinich and Bill Sheller
today.
Under the slogan "T for Too-
Good-for-the-Opposition" the squad
will head for Corvallis this week to
play the up-and-down Beavers from
the Oregon State College of Agricul
ture. Although they don't have a
Q-T or Z-T formation, they must
have something to be able to "Husk
the Huskies."
II is beginning to look as if life was just a Howl of Roses for thq S. and
S. (Stanford and Shaughncssy) football team since a quick look at the
P.C.C. standings shows only Montana's Grizzlies between the Indians and
an eighth trip to Pasadena. This is the startling situation after Saturday's
whiz-hoom games headed by the Cards' potential finally becoming actual

as they out-everythingcd the U.C -
L.A. Bruins, 33 to 0, in the local
stadium.
Since Stanford doesn't meet Mon
tana on the present schedule, local
followers will just have to hope
that some other team upsets the
Grizzlies during their stiff nine
game schedule. Next week they
meet the highly touted Q-T from
Westwood. It will take a potent
team like the Bruins to turn the
trick, since the Grizzlies have al
ready swamped B.Y.U. and N.D.

VOOS TRAVELS
The next score was set up Al
bert's 63-yard punt to the Bruin
five. After a four-yard loss by Buck
Fawcett, soph halfback who took
the injured Eric Armstrong's place,
Kmet made 15; Vucinich went
through the middle and instead of
being dropped when surrounded by
Bruin tacklers, he kept going 21
yards to a touchdown, due to his
own driving power and due to nice
downfield blocking.
Along about the first of the second
quarter Coach Clark received a blow
when both Hank Norberg and Ar
nie Meiners were injured within th:-
space of a few minutes. Meiners will
be ready this week, but Hank's liga
ment injury will probably keep him
out for over a week.
The team, however, managed to
i struggle along, scoring another
| touchdown in the first half after a
| pass-interference penalty and a too
many-time-outs penalty had put the
ball on the Uclan 18-inch line. Al
bert had thrown a long one to Ro;.<
Laverty in the end zone. The ref,
Tom Fitzpatrifck, decided that Lav
erty's chances of getting the pass
| would have been increased consid
! erably had Bruin A1 Solari not been
j riding on his back.
Opening the second half the Big
i Red would have been content to
let things slide along as they were
had the Bruins done the same, bul
the Q-T finally generated a little
offense clown to the Card 19. Water
field, who had been leading the
Bruins throughout the game, pitched
one into the flat. No Southerner was
there to receive, so Albert oblig
ingly caught it. Fifty-eight yards
later, all the other way, Albert was
knocked out of bounds. Two of
Albert's dentals were almost knocked
out of bounds on the play.
An eight-yard jab by Voos set the
stage for an Albert to Kmetovic lat
eral play that netted 30 yards. Cap
tain Freddie Meyer made the tell
ing block in Kmet's run, eliminated
a swarm of opposing players from
contention. A half-dozen more stood
between Pete and tlie goal line in
a five-yard strip down the sideline.
They evidently weren't enough since
the score was made without the
chalk of the sideline w sing raised
except by the befuddled Bruins.
SOUP' SUBSTITUTES
From then on Mr. Shaughnessy
kept the man up the press box who
was keeping substitutions busier
than a no - armed paper-hanger.
Along in the waning minutes of
play he landed on the combination
of Ray Durham calling them and
Lee Brick-a-brack running them,
Brick-a-brack — his mother calls
him Bickenbach—after two fumbles
scored the 27th to 33rd points, in
clusive.
Albert, Kmetovic, Chuck Taylor,
;yid Meyer, who pushed Bruin all
coast end Milt Smith all over the
field, played Ail-American ball all
through the game. While it was
passing that put the Indians ahead
oi Oregon in the opener, running was
the main weapon Saturday with the
passes used only as a defense Open
er-uper. The weakness at fullback
which cropped up against the Ducks
was completely overcome by the
showing of Vucinich and Bill Sheller
today.
Under the slogan "T for Too-
Good-for-the-Opposition" the squad
will head for Corvallis this week to
play the up-and-down Beavers from
the Oregon State College of Agricul
ture. Although they don't have a
Q-T or Z-T formation, they must
have something to be able to "Husk
the Huskies."
II is beginning to look as if life was just a Howl of Roses for thq S. and
S. (Stanford and Shaughncssy) football team since a quick look at the
P.C.C. standings shows only Montana's Grizzlies between the Indians and
an eighth trip to Pasadena. This is the startling situation after Saturday's
whiz-hoom games headed by the Cards' potential finally becoming actual

as they out-everythingcd the U.C -
L.A. Bruins, 33 to 0, in the local
stadium.
Since Stanford doesn't meet Mon
tana on the present schedule, local
followers will just have to hope
that some other team upsets the
Grizzlies during their stiff nine
game schedule. Next week they
meet the highly touted Q-T from
Westwood. It will take a potent
team like the Bruins to turn the
trick, since the Grizzlies have al
ready swamped B.Y.U. and N.D.
State in their ferocious charge to
ward their first conference cham
pionship since the days when Gen

against the First of the Mohicans in
the Dust Bowl.

U.C.L.A. Co-captain Ted Forbes

The team, however, managed to
i struggle along, scoring another
| touchdown in the first half after a
| pass-interference penalty and a too
many-time-outs penalty had put the
ball on the Uclan 18-inch line. Al
bert had thrown a long one to Ro;.<
Laverty in the end zone. The ref,
Tom Fitzpatrifck, decided that Lav
erty's chances of getting the pass
| would have been increased consid
! erably had Bruin A1 Solari not been
j riding on his back.
Opening the second half the Big
i Red would have been content to
let things slide along as they were
had the Bruins done the same, bul
the Q-T finally generated a little
offense clown to the Card 19. Water
field, who had been leading the
Bruins throughout the game, pitched
one into the flat. No Southerner was
there to receive, so Albert oblig
ingly caught it. Fifty-eight yards
later, all the other way, Albert was
knocked out of bounds. Two of
Albert's dentals were almost knocked
out of bounds on the play.
An eight-yard jab by Voos set the
stage for an Albert to Kmetovic lat
eral play that netted 30 yards. Cap
tain Freddie Meyer made the tell
ing block in Kmet's run, eliminated
a swarm of opposing players from
contention. A half-dozen more stood
between Pete and tlie goal line in
a five-yard strip down the sideline.
They evidently weren't enough since
the score was made without the
chalk of the sideline w sing raised
except by the befuddled Bruins.
SOUP' SUBSTITUTES
From then on Mr. Shaughnessy
kept the man up the press box who
was keeping substitutions busier
than a no - armed paper-hanger.
Along in the waning minutes of
play he landed on the combination
of Ray Durham calling them and
Lee Brick-a-brack running them,
Brick-a-brack — his mother calls
him Bickenbach—after two fumbles
scored the 27th to 33rd points, in
clusive.
Albert, Kmetovic, Chuck Taylor,
;yid Meyer, who pushed Bruin all
coast end Milt Smith all over the
field, played Ail-American ball all
through the game. While it was
passing that put the Indians ahead
oi Oregon in the opener, running was
the main weapon Saturday with the
passes used only as a defense Open
er-uper. The weakness at fullback
which cropped up against the Ducks
was completely overcome by the
showing of Vucinich and Bill Sheller
today.
Under the slogan "T for Too-
Good-for-the-Opposition" the squad
will head for Corvallis this week to
play the up-and-down Beavers from
the Oregon State College of Agricul
ture. Although they don't have a
Q-T or Z-T formation, they must
have something to be able to "Husk
the Huskies."
II is beginning to look as if life was just a Howl of Roses for thq S. and
S. (Stanford and Shaughncssy) football team since a quick look at the
P.C.C. standings shows only Montana's Grizzlies between the Indians and
an eighth trip to Pasadena. This is the startling situation after Saturday's
whiz-hoom games headed by the Cards' potential finally becoming actual

as they out-everythingcd the U.C -
L.A. Bruins, 33 to 0, in the local
stadium.
Since Stanford doesn't meet Mon
tana on the present schedule, local
followers will just have to hope
that some other team upsets the
Grizzlies during their stiff nine
game schedule. Next week they
meet the highly touted Q-T from
Westwood. It will take a potent
team like the Bruins to turn the
trick, since the Grizzlies have al
ready swamped B.Y.U. and N.D.
State in their ferocious charge to
ward their first conference cham
pionship since the days when Gen
eral Custer was calling signals
against the First of the Mohicans in
the Dust Bowl.
QUICK SCORES
Against a background of ardent
rooters yelling, "Take off that . .
"Where's your bell?" "Hooray Coast
Guard," "Roar, roar, roar, L.S. Jun-
IOR," "Where's Will Connolly," and
other allied subjects which had not
too much to do with the game going
on in front of them, Stanford's first;
team lost no time in establishing
their superiority over the Uclans.
U.C.L.A. Co-captain Ted Forbes
ran Ken Robesky's kickofT back all
the way into Indian territory. How
ever, the Bruin attack bogged down
and a short punt gave Stanford the
ball on their own 20-yard line. Mill
Vucinich, rejuvenated fullback,
pushed his way through the middle
of the Bruin line for a first down;
Frankie Albert, everybody's All-
American, snuck a flat pass to Pete
Kmetovic, a lot of people's All-
American, which netted 33 yards;
two slashes by Perfect Pete and one
by Voos put the ball on the one;
Albert, leading scorer in the confer
ence with 22 points, snuck it over for
6 and kicked it through for 1 more,
"it" being the ball.
VOOS TRAVELS
The next score was set up Al
bert's 63-yard punt to the Bruin
five. After a four-yard loss by Buck
Fawcett, soph halfback who took
the injured Eric Armstrong's place,
Kmet made 15; Vucinich went
through the middle and instead of
being dropped when surrounded by
Bruin tacklers, he kept going 21
yards to a touchdown, due to his
own driving power and due to nice
downfield blocking.
Along about the first of the second
quarter Coach Clark received a blow
when both Hank Norberg and Ar
nie Meiners were injured within th:-
space of a few minutes. Meiners will
be ready this week, but Hank's liga
ment injury will probably keep him
out for over a week.
