### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. (UP).—
Louis Dernbritz Brandeis, whose fa
mous liberal dissents became guiding
doctrine of the Supreme Court after
he had served on it for more than
two decades, died at his home here
tonight. He would have heen S.">
on Nov. 13.
Brandeis was with a
heart attack last Wednesday (Oct.
.1). Friends said tonight that death
came at 7:15 p.m.
The attack was the first serious
illness which Brandeis had suffered
since his retirement from the high
court on Feb.\l3, 1939, although he
always appeared frail.
FRIEND OF HOLMES
'Ihe first Jew to sit on the Su
preme Court bench, Brandeis was
the closest friend of the late Oliver
Wendell Holmes, grand old man of
American law, with whom he served
and made history on the tribunal
for many years.
Mrs. Brandeis, two daughters—
Mrs. Jacob Gilbert and Mrs. Paul
Raushenbush—and a sister were at
the bedside. Together with a num
ber of grandchildren, they arc his
only immediate survivors.
RETURNS FROM VACATION
Only two weeks ago, the Justice
and Mrs. Brandeis returned from
their home at Chatham, Mass., where
for many years they had spent the
summers with their children and
grandchildren.
Although he was stricken Wed
nesday, no announcement of Bran
deis' ilhiess was made until 2.
hours later. Then a friend of the
family reported the heart attack and
said the Justice was "gravely ill."
Members of the family were sum
moned and, because of his age, only
the faintest hope was held for his re
covery.
DEATH FORESEEN
His personal physician, Dr. Lewis
I Vkcr, announced la.st night that his
d' 11h was "only a few hours away."
1 iis condition earlier today was re
i H'ted as "unchanged."
Ihe nation's great and humblo
were quick to mourn his passing,
li ning his long v colorful career—
i a.s a crusading lawyer and in
later years as a member of the Su
preme Court—he won many names
tich as "the people's lawyer."
