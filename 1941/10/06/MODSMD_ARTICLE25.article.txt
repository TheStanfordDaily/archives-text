# SHAUGHNESSY 'ON THE AIR
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
Stanford's Rose-Bowl express con
j ductor, cultured Clark Shaughnessy,
I told a coast-to-coast radio audience
! Sunday that "any team that wins by
30 points had better look ouf for an
I awful fall."
Introduced by Bill Leiser, San
Francisco Chronicle sports editor,
Shaughnessy was the highlight of the
j "Second Guessers" broadcast in
which he reviewed and forecasted
j the Pacific Coast conference football
| picture.
1 "Do you mean," asked Leiser, "that
0.5.C., might beat you next week."
A GOOD LINE
"Not if a good line and Frankie
; Albert and Pete Kmetovic can help
it."
"Oh, you admit that you have a
[ good line?"
j Mr. Shaughnessy did not disagree.
"And you admit Albert is an All-
American?"
"Yes," answered Shaughnessy, "he
| was superb on defense, too, and that
is the real test for an Ail-American.
Goodness, it seems he always knows
what to do in every situation."
"You mean," countered Leiser,
"that he does a lot of the team'
thinking?"
"I mean," said the coach, "he does
most of it."
Asked about California's 6-13 up
j set by W.S.C., Shaughnessy said,
j "You know, I couldn't understand
that either, until I remembered that
j Babe Hollingberry had never lost a
j game to the Bears on his home field,
i There is more to a football game than
offense and defense. Maybe Holling
j berry gave his team a pep talk."
"Do you give your boys pep
talks?" queried Leiser incidentally.
NO PEP TALKS
"I never do. I feel that a play that
is good for twenty-five yards will do
them more good."
The great coach looks for "Cali
fornia to come back strong," and
predicted a terrific Santa Clara
| California game next Saturday.
NO RANKINGS YET
The program began in New York,
| where Coach Lou Little of Colum
bia. and Columnist Henry McLemore
looked over the Eastern and South
; ern situation. They praised Penn,
Navy, Colgate, Cornell, and Ford
ham, but refused to rank them. "The
teams must be tested through sev
eral games before that can be done,"
explained Little.
But McLemore, with his Southern
accent, felt difiei'ently about the
I South, saying, "I'm going to take
Duke and Tulane to dominate the
I South right now."
Switching to Chicago, the program
| next dealt with tlve Midwest. Col
umnist Francis Powers interviewed
i Northwestern Coach Lyn Waldorf,
' whose team walloped Kansas State

on Saturday. "The high humidity |
here must have beei? harder on the
Kansas boys, who are used to dry !
heat," he said. He also commended
Marquette, wh*> upset Wisconsin, and j
Illinois, whom he said is "bound to
cause trouble," and noted that j
"Notre Dame scored two touch- j
downs on Indiana from the T-for
mation."
Prophesied Powers: "It will be a
great game when Gopher speed |
meets Michigan cunning." In review- j
ing the Big Six, they agreed that the

coming Missouri-Nebraska and Ok
lahoma-Texas games would be two
of the greatest of the season.
FLY HOME
The last third of the program came
from the Pacific Coast, where Leiser
and Shaughnessy held their conver
sation. The broadcast ended with
Shaughnessy stating he would fly
back from Oregon, and would be
present on next week's program.
"Then I'll meet you at the airport
next Sunday morning at 2:30," con
cluded Leiser, signing off.


". . . a thirty-point winner should watch its step."
