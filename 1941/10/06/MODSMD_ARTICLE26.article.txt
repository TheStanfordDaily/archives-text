## 
### 
To exchange their own radio programs by script and recordings with
colleges ail over the country. Stanford University lias applied for member
ship in the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System.
This organization, now two years old, was established when students at
Brcwn University started broadcasting to doimitories cn their own cam-

pus. Now, from Massachusetts to
California, students will be able to
hear programs written and produced
at colleges fur from their own.
On all stations popular programs
are classical music, hit tunes, and
dramatic sketches. The station on
the Farm will have its own program
; manager and develop new programs
to fit its facilities and demands of its
own student audience, as does every
college station.
Although the actual operation of
! the stations is in the students' hands,
j faculty members on all the campuses
j give their advice, and help supply
i program material. Engineering stu
dents plan the wiring, design equip
ment, and handle the controls; oth
ers write, announce, and produce
programs.
The number of colleges to hook
lup with this new type of network
I totals 27; eastern colleges such as
Brown, Harvard, Columbia, Yale,
Princeton, and Cornell are members
j of the IBC. The University of Ala
-1 bama, Georgetown University in
Washington, D.C., and Knox College
in Illinois have also applied for
membership.
This exchange will furnish .sus
taining feature programs to the
member stations which will be both
scripts and recordings which are
the most unusual presented by each
college.
