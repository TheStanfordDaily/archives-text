# Report Sea Battle Off Brazil Coast
## Soviets Recapture 30 Towns; Germans Blitz into Crimea 
### United Press 
An unidentified ship has been
sunk after a sea battle within sight
of the Brazilian coast, travellers
reaching Pcmambuco 011 Brazil's
easternmost bulge reported Sunday
night 011 the eve of a bitter neutral
ity fight in Congress and amid con
tinued reports of savage warfare in
Russia.
The South Atlantic sea battle was
said to have occurred about 7 p.m.
Friday, in bright moonlight, and
was seen by residents of Maragogy,
on the coast between Pernambuco
and Maceio, whose homes were
shaken by the intensity of the firing.
QUESTIONABLE REPORT
The battle, if it actually did occur,
was in the same general area in
which United States warships and
planes were seeking the raider which
on Sept. 27 sank the American
owned Panamanian tanker I. C.
White.
Meanwhile, these were the reports
from the long Russian battlefront:
1. Nazis claimed that "very strong
formations" of German bombers had
gained complete control of the skies
over the front and were spreading
havoc through Russian communica
tions, supposedly in preparation for
the giant new offensive announced
last Friday by Adolf Hitler. Inten
sive Russian counter-drives were
admitted but it was said that all
were beaten back.
30 TOWNS RECAPTURED
2. Russian war dispatches claimed
that Red troops had recaptured 30
villages in a counter-offensive on
the southern front that was gaining
as much as 20 miles in 36 hours.
Leningrad defenders were said to
have hurled back the Germans three
miles in that sector after a three-day
battle. The Russians admitted that
the Germans were hurling huge
fresh forces into the battle for the
Crimea.
A Rumanian communique, carried
by DNB in Berlin, admitted for the
first time that Russian parachutists
had landed successfully in Rumania
and were continuing to function.
The communique said that 10 per
cent of the parachutists still were at
large.
Damage to the rich Ploesti oil
fields, on which the German war
machine is believed to lean heavily,
also was admitted, presumably as
result of continuous Russian aerial
bombing. Damage was placed thus
far at around 53.000.000.
THE SITUATION TODAY
As the war went into its 16th
week, this was the general situa
tion:
Around Leningrad the Russians
still claimed to be holding the Ger
mans at bay and the Germans had
made no serious counter-claims; in
the central sector the front appeared
more or less stabilized, with the
Russians claiming slight gains; and
in the south —area of most apparent
danger to the Soviets—the Germans
were pushing steadily eastward, in a
position to threaten Kharkov and
with it the great industrial Donetz
Basin.
In significant contrast to the battle
for Russia was the scene at the Eng
lish port of New Haven along the
English Channel. There 1.500 Ger
man war prisoners awaited aboard
British hospital ships for the word
which will send them across the
channel in exchange for as many
wounded and crippled British war
prisoners.
Meanwhile, a total of 35 surviors
of the sunken I. C. White were re
ported nearing Rio de Janeiro aboard
the ships West Nilus and Delnote.
