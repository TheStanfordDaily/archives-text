# Yanks Triumph in Ninth, 7-4; Try for Clincher Today
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
There was no joy in Flatbush yesterday, for Casey, the mighty C asey,
struck liim out, hut the ball bounded away from Mickey Owen, and
Tommy iicnrich roared down to first hast* to start the Yankees on their
way to a 7-4 triumph, their third of tin* series.
The beloved had the game in any pocket you like—two out in the

, first half of th ninth with a 4-!J lead
but fortune smiled on the Yankees, ,
• misfortune grimaced on the Bums.
Hugh Casey was on the mound,
pitching a great relief role, and
' had retired Johnny Sturm, first man
up, and then had tin own out Red
' Rolfe at. fust.
i CASEY vs. HENRICII
Tommy Henrich was up. The
I count went up to three and two.
Casey scorched the next pitch in
I and Henrich struck out with a lusty
' swing. The crowd cheered a mighty |
j cheer, but the ball escaped Owen,
I and Henrich buzzed down the first
! base line and wa.s safe a mile.
Up next was the Bomber himself,
Joe DiMaggio. Joe shot a prodigious
poke into left field for a single. Slill
the Bums had control.
KELLER HIT'S AGAIN
Charlie Keller, great clutch hitter
for the Yanks, swung twice, and
missed. Casey had him in the hole
at two and no. There was the chance
to finish it off.
But Keller blasted the third pitch
far x into right held, and DiMaggio
and Henrich streaked around the
bases. The ball hit the fence and
rolled back for a two-base hit, two
i runs across the plate.
Five to four was 0.k., enough to
make Flatbush groan, but the Yan

kee machine gave nought for feel
ings. After Bill Dickey drew a
walk, Joe Gordon smashed a double
to left field, scoring Keller and
Dickey. Johnny Muiphy went clown
to end the inning.
Brooklyn came out for their half
of the ninth, but the anticlimax put
the Bums down in order.
So the Brooks were "in" and out,
when the victory seemed right at
hand.
Today you can bank on Lefty Go
mez pitching for the Yanks. Gomez
has never lost a series game. For
the Bums it v/ill no doubt be de
pendable Whit Wyatt., out to put
Brooklyn back on the map.
