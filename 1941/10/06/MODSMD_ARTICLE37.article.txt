As the weeks go by, this Pacific Coast Conference grid campaign
becomes more and more involved, until now it is such a mixed-up affair
that only one thing is certain: Stanford is the class of the loop.
But with Oregon State's victory over the mighty U. of Wash, and the
schedule which says the Indians have to meet the Cougars in the North,
there's no certainty that Stanford is going to hold that spot. But confi
dentially, we think next Saturday night will find the Indians even more
in the lead.

If there was anything that the
old grads and (lie* thousands of
other spectators at the game Sat
| urday came to see and didn't, it's
j a miracle, for Coach Clark
Shaughncssy's boys flashed an at
tack and a defense that had ev
erything anyone could want to
witness. And from where we sat,
there wasn't a flaw in their play.
Technically, there must have heen,
I for there is no such thing as per
fect football. It's all a relative
| thing. But Albert, Kmetovic, Tay
] lor & Co. came close enough to
suit lis.
With the oh-so-surprising defeat
: of "Jolting Jim" Jurkovich and the
j "Rose - Bowl - bound" California
Bears by lowly Washington State,
U.S.C.'s loss to Ohio State, and the
afore-mentioned Cougar-Husky re
sult, Stanford is left as the only un
defeated major outfit in the confer
ence. Of course, the Trojans were
licked by a non-conference outfit,

which leaves their conference slate clean, but the Injuns are still in front
by virtue of two wins, no losses, and no ties, in comparison to U.S.C.'s one
victory.

TP HERE were a number of outstanding things about the Redshirts in
their game, a few of which will be mentioned here.
Milton C. Vucinich, the Slashing Slav from San Francisco, gave ample
evidence that he is a far better than average fullback. Any guy who can
carry the ball inside the ends nine times for an average of almost six yards
per carry has the stuff. Voos' terrific drive that carried him 21 yards
for Stanford's second touchdown was just one instance of his great work.
He did everything well. As we said before, he is an immensely improved
footballer. And he gets better each week.
Randall "Buck" Fawcett, the second-string right halfback who took
over the starting duties when Hoot Armstrong's injury kept the short
lad from playing, came through with flying colors. lie is getting that
experience that he needed so much. He didn't play flawless ball, but
he was good nevertheless. He was much better Saturday than he was
a week ago. and he'll be much better next week than he was last
Saturday. Did you see him run away from the Ucla defenders on
the lateral from Kmetovic, the play thai was called back? Speed plays
a large part in the T attack, and Fawcett has thai speed f His body
angle when he carries (he ball is nice, too.
We've had a feeling that in writing this column subconsciously we've
been de-emphasizing the greatness of All-American Frankie Albert. Mr.
Frank is so good that we more or less take him for granted. Saturday his
work was marvelous. His passing, play-calling, kicking, defensive play,
and all-around heads-up ball was all that could be asked. Without him,
there's no telling where the Indians would be in this early stage of the
race. It's extremely doubtful if they would have moved by the very good
University of Oregon outfit.
The same holds true of Pete Kmetovic, the boy they call "Perfect
Pete because he very seldom makes a mistake. What can you say about
his running? There just aren't words to describe either the way he runs
or how good it is. Kmetovic, because he can't pass or kick, is just built
for this type of an attack, where his slippery running and effective decoy
ing can be used to the greatest advantage.

QUTSTANDING in an outstanding line were two guards, Chuck Taylor
and sophomore Loren LaPrade. Between them they kept the Ucla
quarterbacks, Bob Waterfield and Ernie Case, in a constant dither. Many
were the times that Taylor and LaPrade stopped the Q-T before it even
started to move.

TP HERE were a number of outstanding things about the Redshirts in
their game, a few of which will be mentioned here.
Milton C. Vucinich, the Slashing Slav from San Francisco, gave ample
evidence that he is a far better than average fullback. Any guy who can
carry the ball inside the ends nine times for an average of almost six yards
per carry has the stuff. Voos' terrific drive that carried him 21 yards
for Stanford's second touchdown was just one instance of his great work.
He did everything well. As we said before, he is an immensely improved
footballer. And he gets better each week.
Randall "Buck" Fawcett, the second-string right halfback who took
over the starting duties when Hoot Armstrong's injury kept the short
lad from playing, came through with flying colors. lie is getting that
experience that he needed so much. He didn't play flawless ball, but
he was good nevertheless. He was much better Saturday than he was
a week ago. and he'll be much better next week than he was last
Saturday. Did you see him run away from the Ucla defenders on
the lateral from Kmetovic, the play thai was called back? Speed plays
a large part in the T attack, and Fawcett has thai speed f His body
angle when he carries (he ball is nice, too.
We've had a feeling that in writing this column subconsciously we've
been de-emphasizing the greatness of All-American Frankie Albert. Mr.
Frank is so good that we more or less take him for granted. Saturday his
work was marvelous. His passing, play-calling, kicking, defensive play,
and all-around heads-up ball was all that could be asked. Without him,
there's no telling where the Indians would be in this early stage of the
race. It's extremely doubtful if they would have moved by the very good
University of Oregon outfit.
The same holds true of Pete Kmetovic, the boy they call "Perfect
Pete because he very seldom makes a mistake. What can you say about
his running? There just aren't words to describe either the way he runs
or how good it is. Kmetovic, because he can't pass or kick, is just built
for this type of an attack, where his slippery running and effective decoy
ing can be used to the greatest advantage.

QUTSTANDING in an outstanding line were two guards, Chuck Taylor
and sophomore Loren LaPrade. Between them they kept the Ucla
quarterbacks, Bob Waterfield and Ernie Case, in a constant dither. Many
were the times that Taylor and LaPrade stopped the Q-T before it even
started to move.

As the weeks go by, this Pacific Coast Conference grid campaign
becomes more and more involved, until now it is such a mixed-up affair
that only one thing is certain: Stanford is the class of the loop.
But with Oregon State's victory over the mighty U. of Wash, and the
schedule which says the Indians have to meet the Cougars in the North,
there's no certainty that Stanford is going to hold that spot. But confi
dentially, we think next Saturday night will find the Indians even more
in the lead.

If there was anything that the
old grads and (lie* thousands of
other spectators at the game Sat
| urday came to see and didn't, it's
j a miracle, for Coach Clark
Shaughncssy's boys flashed an at
tack and a defense that had ev
erything anyone could want to
witness. And from where we sat,
there wasn't a flaw in their play.
Technically, there must have heen,
I for there is no such thing as per
fect football. It's all a relative

defeated major outfit in the confer

licked by a non-conference outfit,

which leaves their conference slate clean, but the Injuns are still in front

race. It's extremely doubtful if they would have moved by the very good
University of Oregon outfit.
The same holds true of Pete Kmetovic, the boy they call "Perfect
Pete because he very seldom makes a mistake. What can you say about
his running? There just aren't words to describe either the way he runs
or how good it is. Kmetovic, because he can't pass or kick, is just built
for this type of an attack, where his slippery running and effective decoy
ing can be used to the greatest advantage.

QUTSTANDING in an outstanding line were two guards, Chuck Taylor
and sophomore Loren LaPrade. Between them they kept the Ucla
quarterbacks, Bob Waterfield and Ernie Case, in a constant dither. Many
were the times that Taylor and LaPrade stopped the Q-T before it even
started to move.

yt7HAT a football week-end!
As the weeks go by, this Pacific Coast Conference grid campaign
becomes more and more involved, until now it is such a mixed-up affair
that only one thing is certain: Stanford is the class of the loop.
But with Oregon State's victory over the mighty U. of Wash, and the
schedule which says the Indians have to meet the Cougars in the North,
there's no certainty that Stanford is going to hold that spot. But confi
dentially, we think next Saturday night will find the Indians even more
in the lead.

If there was anything that the
old grads and (lie* thousands of
other spectators at the game Sat
| urday came to see and didn't, it's
j a miracle, for Coach Clark
Shaughncssy's boys flashed an at
tack and a defense that had ev
erything anyone could want to
witness. And from where we sat,
there wasn't a flaw in their play.
Technically, there must have heen,
I for there is no such thing as per
fect football. It's all a relative
| thing. But Albert, Kmetovic, Tay
] lor & Co. came close enough to
suit lis.
With the oh-so-surprising defeat
: of "Jolting Jim" Jurkovich and the
j "Rose - Bowl - bound" California
Bears by lowly Washington State,
U.S.C.'s loss to Ohio State, and the
afore-mentioned Cougar-Husky re
sult, Stanford is left as the only un
defeated major outfit in the confer
ence. Of course, the Trojans were
licked by a non-conference outfit,

which leaves their conference slate clean, but the Injuns are still in front
by virtue of two wins, no losses, and no ties, in comparison to U.S.C.'s one
victory.

TP HERE were a number of outstanding things about the Redshirts in
their game, a few of which will be mentioned here.
Milton C. Vucinich, the Slashing Slav from San Francisco, gave ample
evidence that he is a far better than average fullback. Any guy who can
carry the ball inside the ends nine times for an average of almost six yards
per carry has the stuff. Voos' terrific drive that carried him 21 yards
for Stanford's second touchdown was just one instance of his great work.
He did everything well. As we said before, he is an immensely improved
footballer. And he gets better each week.
Randall "Buck" Fawcett, the second-string right halfback who took
over the starting duties when Hoot Armstrong's injury kept the short
lad from playing, came through with flying colors. lie is getting that
experience that he needed so much. He didn't play flawless ball, but
he was good nevertheless. He was much better Saturday than he was
a week ago. and he'll be much better next week than he was last
Saturday. Did you see him run away from the Ucla defenders on
the lateral from Kmetovic, the play thai was called back? Speed plays
a large part in the T attack, and Fawcett has thai speed f His body
angle when he carries (he ball is nice, too.
We've had a feeling that in writing this column subconsciously we've
been de-emphasizing the greatness of All-American Frankie Albert. Mr.
Frank is so good that we more or less take him for granted. Saturday his
work was marvelous. His passing, play-calling, kicking, defensive play,
and all-around heads-up ball was all that could be asked. Without him,
there's no telling where the Indians would be in this early stage of the
race. It's extremely doubtful if they would have moved by the very good
University of Oregon outfit.
