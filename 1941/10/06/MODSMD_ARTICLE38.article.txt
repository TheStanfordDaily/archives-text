# Yearlings Shine In Jaysee Win
## 
### 
If anyone should ask, Harry Ship
key has a football squad par excel- ;
lenceâ€” his yearling gridders walked j
all over Long Beach J. C. Saturday,
20-0. The Papooses set up scores by i
a clipping penalty, a fumble, and an
intercepted pass.
Stanford's forward wall stood up
like a row of Mack trucks and kept
the Vikings deep in their own ter
ritory most of the game.
PETITT SCORES
They charged in, blocked fero- j
ciously, and when Jim Petitt rolled j
around right end for the third
touchdown, quarter Cannon Park
inson sliced under the last defensive
man in the Jaysee backfield, leav- i
ing him lying on the turf.
The first score: given the ball on j
the J.C. 29-yard line after a clip- j
ping penalty while a Stanford kick
was still in the air, Fred Parsons
flashed through a gaping hole at 1
right tackle and went over stand
ing up. Fred Sanderman's place- j
ment was good.
PASS INTERCEPTED
Shortly after the second half !
I opened, Petitt intercepted a pass on j
j the Long Beach 35-yard line and
went 10 before being hauled down, i
Helped along by a pass interfer
ence penalty, the frosh moved down
to the three, where Foss Dana
I punched over the goal. Parkinson's
. kick split the uprights for 14-0.
When Sam Dimas, J.C. full, fum
bled a moment later, the yearlings
took possession and went from the
20 to a touchdown in six plays,
Petitt going over with the aid of
Parkinson's aforementioned block.
The speedy quarterback's attempt at
placement missed.
