# Injuries to Norberg, Meiners Worry Dressing-Room Clique
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
"How's Ilank? How's Hank?"
That was Maylield Ike asking after
bis favorite, burly Henry Norberg,
the local boy who was iusl about to
make good when cut down by in
jury.
The scene was the Stanford dress
ing room after the 33-0 threshing
administered to the Bruins. Scribes
were looking for Shaughnessy. The
embattled coach was hemmed in by
happy supporters; but he was not
too happy, for he was thinking of his
two injured ends, Meiners and
Norberg, and had just been told
that Oregon State, next week's op
ponent, had walloped Washington.
Asked if he saw any marked simi
larity in the original T and the frus
trated QT. Shaughnessy said:
T VERSUS QT
"Oh sure . . . But there are a
lot of tricks in football."
Frankie Albert, with a couple of
teeth chipped, was introduced to
Phil Moffat, great Stanford half ten
years back. Standing in a pile of
tape, hip pads, and jerseys, Rog
Laverty seemed pretty happy about

his first big stretch in a game. Nor
berg left the gym under his own J
steam and later it was revealed that
both he and Meiners would prob
ably be ready to meet Dethman,
Durdan & Co. up at Corvallis this
week-end.
OLD TIMERS RETURN
Old-time stars were a dime a
dozen and some of them got a big J
kick out of discussing the great
game with the '"kids." Someone 1
suggested that, in the event Shaugh
nessy can't replace Albert next year, i
the Cards might adopt a strictly
power set-up.
Everyone seemed happy Saturday
in the dressing room after the game. ;
Stanford, unlike the New York
Yankees, hasn't reached the stage
where they don't get excited about
winning a ball game.
