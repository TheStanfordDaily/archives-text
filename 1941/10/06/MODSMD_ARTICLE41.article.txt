# Water Poloists Prime for Meets
## 
### 
Heavy scrimmage every day this
week is Coach Norton Thornton's
prescription for his varsity water
polo team as it prepares for a two
game wek-end —they meet Compton
J. C. Friday afternoon, and the
Olympic Club Saturday.
Perhaps the best game of the sea
son will be the Olympic Club
fracas. Generally conceded to be
the finest water polo team in the
United States, the Clubmen haven't
been beaten in three years. With
the football team up at Corvallis,
student attention probably will cen
ter on this game.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 (UP).—
The Washington Redskins upset the?
Football League victory before 32,-
Brooklyn Dodgers 13-0 today for
their first 1941 National Professional
b42 sweltering fans.
