# Dear Frosh:
## 
### 
YOU have had many warnings and rules
thrust at you since your arrival here. But
you have all heard that well-worn proverb
about an "ounce of prevention . . and in this
case we fecfl we are justified in doing just a
little more moralizing in your behalf.
Some of you might not have heard what hap
pened to a couple of last year's freshmen who
had a sincere interest in learning a little about
the life of the "other half" along San Francisco's
"Skid Row."
These two boys, dressed like bums, were
picked up for vagrancy and later brutally
beaten and injured by a couple of San Fran
cisco's keepers of law and order. The Police
Commission conducted a long and tedious in
vestigation—during the two fellows' final exam
period and spring vacation—and ended up by
firing three policemen. The newspapers cam
paigned for a wholesale cleanup in the police
force, but after a short while the whole thing
blew over.
At this propitious moment the police made
a great to-do over "closing the city down." A
few months later when the publicity began to
die away, some of the restrictions were guietly
eased off.
After all this one would normally feel that
uncivilized brutality would cease in the "City
by the Golden Gate."
But it didn't.
A citizen of Mexico was subjected to treat
ment similar to that accorded the two Stanford
frosh. The Consul-General of Mexico entered a
protest and demanded some action. The news
papers didn't seem very interested this time,
so with little publicity Jhis affair died out con
veniently for the San Francisco police force.
So we urge you to heed this little bit of ad
vice—if you MUST journey to the city on a "so
ciological experiment" please carry with you a
nine-by-twelve-inch photostatic copy of your
Stanford student body card. If you do this we
think you will be given civilized treatment by
the police force. It is doubtful whether they
wish to go through the throes of another inves
tigation by the Commission.
