# Off the Gripe List
## 
### 
THE very human foible of griping has mani
fested itself on campus for the past years in
criticizing the Stanford Bookstore. The gripes
and groans are too familiar to bear repetition.
Alas, however, many students now find them
selves with one less target to fire at, for the
Bookstore has by necessity been removed from
the gripe list. Its record of the past two years
defies even the most able griper, as may be
seen by today's announcement on page 1 of the
allotment of 1940-41 profits.
More than $5,600 was returned to students
and faculty in the form of rebates on purchases.
Thousands of dollars more would have been
rebated, but many students failed to turn in
their purchase slips.
"What is done with the huge surplus not re
turned in profits?" an undaunted griper may
growl.
Sorry to disappoint him, but the profits are far
from huge. The Bookstore has a very small
mark-up on all its merchandise, except branded
goods and books, on which manufacturers and
publishers set the price Only about $12,000
was netted from sales of $175,000 during the
past year—a very small margin.
Even better news than the six per cent rebate
is the $5,000 gift to the University to help stu
dents with student aid scholarships, academic
scholarships, and loans. Last year the gift
amounted to $3,500.
Finally the thousand dollars or so that remains

will be used as a reserve, so lhat when the next
depression arrives, the Bookstore will not face
the same condition it did in the last financial
crisis.
One criticism of the Bookstore appears to be
well founded—until it is investigated; that is,
the seemingly exorbitant prices on used books.
Handling the used texts is not merely a matter
of buying, classifying, and reselling them at a
few cents more than they cost.
A large loss is sustained by this department
each year, as numerous professors select new
texts, outmoding the used books. The Book
store, unlike the Co-op Book Exchange, does not
receive the used texts on consignment. Nor
can it exchange the outmoded texts with other
universities, as publishers will not allow this.
Such a large loss must in part be shared by all
purchasers of used texts.
But the Board of Directors and the staff of the
Bookstore are doing their darnedest to obtain
the best merchandise at the lowest possible
price, at the same time working to keep the
ovehead down. They face difficult problems,
some as yet unsolved—such as the used book
losses— but slowly the knotty problems are be
ing untangled.—Herman Silverman

turned in profits?" an undaunted griper may
growl.
Sorry to disappoint him, but the profits are far
from huge. The Bookstore has a very small
mark-up on all its merchandise, except branded
goods and books, on which manufacturers and
publishers set the price Only about $12,000
was netted from sales of $175,000 during the
past year—a very small margin.
Even better news than the six per cent rebate
is the $5,000 gift to the University to help stu
dents with student aid scholarships, academic
scholarships, and loans. Last year the gift
amounted to $3,500.
Finally the thousand dollars or so that remains

will be used as a reserve, so lhat when the next
depression arrives, the Bookstore will not face
the same condition it did in the last financial
crisis.
One criticism of the Bookstore appears to be
well founded—until it is investigated; that is,
the seemingly exorbitant prices on used books.
Handling the used texts is not merely a matter
of buying, classifying, and reselling them at a
few cents more than they cost.
A large loss is sustained by this department
each year, as numerous professors select new
texts, outmoding the used books. The Book
store, unlike the Co-op Book Exchange, does not
receive the used texts on consignment. Nor
can it exchange the outmoded texts with other
universities, as publishers will not allow this.
Such a large loss must in part be shared by all
purchasers of used texts.
But the Board of Directors and the staff of the
Bookstore are doing their darnedest to obtain
the best merchandise at the lowest possible
price, at the same time working to keep the
ovehead down. They face difficult problems,
some as yet unsolved—such as the used book
losses— but slowly the knotty problems are be
ing untangled.—Herman Silverman
THE very human foible of griping has mani
fested itself on campus for the past years in
criticizing the Stanford Bookstore. The gripes
and groans are too familiar to bear repetition.
Alas, however, many students now find them
selves with one less target to fire at, for the
Bookstore has by necessity been removed from
the gripe list. Its record of the past two years
defies even the most able griper, as may be
seen by today's announcement on page 1 of the
allotment of 1940-41 profits.
More than $5,600 was returned to students
and faculty in the form of rebates on purchases.
Thousands of dollars more would have been
rebated, but many students failed to turn in
their purchase slips.

turned in profits?" an undaunted griper may
