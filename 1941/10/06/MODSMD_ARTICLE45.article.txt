# Not Forgotten

THERE are a great many ways in which stu
dents can earn all or part of their college
expenses.
Since 1934 the federal government has each
year been allotting certain sizeable sums to the
National Youth Administration, better known
as NYA. This year Stanford's share of NYA
money has been cut due to the drop in enroll
ment, but it is important that the idea has not
been dropped.
The government is to be highly commended
on its farsightedness in continuing NYA to aid
needy students during this period of mounting
defense expenditures and correspondingly
mounting taxes.
In most cases the work a student does on
NYA is work which is of advantage to him not
only from the financial viewpoint but also it
allows him to gain a more intimate knowledge
of the fields of his interest â€”working with major
professors and now students of government
may even get jobs as apprentices in local, state,
and national government offices.
Though the sinking of ships may be upper
most at the present time, it is heartening to
think that some of the men in Washington have
not forgotten the students who might sink were
it not for NYA assistance.
