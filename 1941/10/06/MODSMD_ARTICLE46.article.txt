WORLD AND NANEII ARE OLDER
world is several billion years old, my grand
mother is 80 years old, and last Wednesday Stan
ford became 50 years old. My grandmother in her 80
years has had 13 children, an unknown number of
grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. Stan
ford in a much shorter period has done almost as well.
For Stanford in this comparatively short time has
become one of the main intellectual centers of the
world, and has played an important part in the devel
opment of the West.
Here, the knowledge of the world has been gath
ered. In one spot, information on almost any known
subject is assembled, sorted, catalogued, placed in an
easily attainable spot. There are other ways of getting
an education, of learning about the people and ideas
of the past, of understanding the happenings of the
present-day, and of getting an idea what the future
will be like, but I think that going to college is one
of the best ways, and by far the easiest.
Besides Stanford Ls such a wonderful place, large
and apart from everything but still aware of things,
with good weather and pretty scenery and a lot of
squirrels.
* * * #
in its 50 years has turned out many per-
K sons that have gained a certain amount of fame.
You know about most of them. You know about
Herbert Hoover, (he only living ex-president, about
Charles McNary, the Oregon Senator, and about our
school's President Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Then there was Steinbeck who once lived in En
cina, and Wallace and Will Irwin the authors, and the
playwright Maxwell Anderson, and the editor of the
New Republic, Bruce Bliven. You see Stanford has
quite a respectable representation in literary circles.
Then there was Doodles Weaver, actor, funny man
and rumored owner of the night dive, "The Club
Foot," Lloyd Nolan of the movies, Paul Speegle and
Bill Leiser of the Chronicle staff, not to forget Stan
Glikbarg who is in the army, Dwight Hutchinson, who
is going into the army and Harry Muheim who isn't
in the army.

A LL of these men have spent time at Stanford, and
Stanford in some measure, has helped to produce
them. There have undoubtedly been some women that
have done something, but I don't know of any. I don't
know much about women.
And besides the famous ones, the ones that every
one recognizes as successes, there have been over
35,000 others who have come to Stanford, most of
them fresh out of of high school and slightly confused.
They have been worked over and sent out a little
more mature, a little better prepared to get along
with life.
Stanford has had a good 50 years and we all hope
that it will keep going for a long time to come. And
not only this school, but the idea of education and
learning and advancement. It's a good idea and should
be continued.

WORLD AND NANEII ARE OLDER
world is several billion years old, my grand
mother is 80 years old, and last Wednesday Stan
ford became 50 years old. My grandmother in her 80
years has had 13 children, an unknown number of
grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. Stan
ford in a much shorter period has done almost as well.
For Stanford in this comparatively short time has
become one of the main intellectual centers of the
world, and has played an important part in the devel
opment of the West.
Here, the knowledge of the world has been gath
ered. In one spot, information on almost any known
subject is assembled, sorted, catalogued, placed in an
easily attainable spot. There are other ways of getting
an education, of learning about the people and ideas
of the past, of understanding the happenings of the
present-day, and of getting an idea what the future
will be like, but I think that going to college is one
of the best ways, and by far the easiest.
Besides Stanford Ls such a wonderful place, large
and apart from everything but still aware of things,
with good weather and pretty scenery and a lot of
squirrels.

in its 50 years has turned out many per-
K sons that have gained a certain amount of fame.
You know about most of them. You know about
Herbert Hoover, (he only living ex-president, about
Charles McNary, the Oregon Senator, and about our
school's President Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Then there was Steinbeck who once lived in En
cina, and Wallace and Will Irwin the authors, and the
playwright Maxwell Anderson, and the editor of the
New Republic, Bruce Bliven. You see Stanford has
quite a respectable representation in literary circles.
Then there was Doodles Weaver, actor, funny man
and rumored owner of the night dive, "The Club
Foot," Lloyd Nolan of the movies, Paul Speegle and
Bill Leiser of the Chronicle staff, not to forget Stan
Glikbarg who is in the army, Dwight Hutchinson, who
is going into the army and Harry Muheim who isn't
in the army.

A LL of these men have spent time at Stanford, and
Stanford in some measure, has helped to produce
them. There have undoubtedly been some women that
have done something, but I don't know of any. I don't
know much about women.
And besides the famous ones, the ones that every
one recognizes as successes, there have been over
35,000 others who have come to Stanford, most of
them fresh out of of high school and slightly confused.
They have been worked over and sent out a little
more mature, a little better prepared to get along
with life.
Stanford has had a good 50 years and we all hope
that it will keep going for a long time to come. And
not only this school, but the idea of education and
learning and advancement. It's a good idea and should
be continued.
