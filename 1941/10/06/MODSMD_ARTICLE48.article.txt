# Farm Sailors Enlarge Group
## Newcomers Bolster Hopes for Victory 
### 
Srxty members, including incom
ing sailors with experience, com
prise the ranks of Stanford's sailing
club which is fast becoming a well j
established institution on the cam
pus. This year's prospects of a win
ning season are held excellent by
club members.
Two years ago Stanford, Menlo,
San Jose, and California formed a
"conference," agreeing to sail against
each other as much as possible.
They chose Bob Allen, president of
the Stanford chapter, as conference
commodore. Present plans are to
expand the four-school association
to include Cal Tech, Pomona, U.S.C.,
and perhaps Washington â€” all this
year. Arrangements are now under
way to hold a regatta at Newport
during the Christmas holidays.
More definite information about fu
ture activities will be known after
the first official meeting this month.
The year's big event for the Stan
ford sailing club is a dual rivalry
with California each spring at Ber
keley, for which the Berkeley Cham
ber of Commerce has put up a tro- I
phy. This trophy is now on display i
in the Union, as Stanford won the j
races last year. Despite the absence j
of two of its star- sailors, the Indian :
team trounced the Bears by a score
of 217 to 160.
For this meet, the outstanding six
are selected to skipper the boats, j
and one point is allowed for each '
boat beaten.
The Stanford championship races
are a major spring event. Last year 1
Faye Pemberthy won over a field of
forty. Bob Allen took second, and
Howard Wright third. In the girls' I
division, although there was such a
gale that only ten could enter, Dot
tie Dickinson came off with first
place.
Also standing good chances of
repeating as skippers in intercolle- '
giate competition, as well as in Uni
versity competition, are Bob Hamp
ton and Ted Munroe.
This summer Wright took a 1000-
mile trip to Mexico in his 95-foot
yawl, with Phil Chapman as crew.
President Allen owns a starboat at
Balboa, and claims that most of
Stanford's best sailors are also from
Balboa.
