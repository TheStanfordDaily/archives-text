### AMIE REICHERT 
so comfy in the Kremlin.
It's so peaceful and so quiet,
Adolf Hitler wants to try it . . .
Yesterday the Nazis launched a
terrific pincers drive against Mos
cow. From the North and South si
multaneously artillery and tank divi
sions surged toward the Red capital.
In Russia the winters arc bitter
and Der Fuehrer doesn't like the
thought of camping out in 30-
below weather. When the heavy
snows come, they say it gets so
cold a mustache — even a teeny
one—will freeze solid with icicles.
And it's so comfy in the Kremlin.

ALONG the entire Russian front
the Nazis are fighting with re
newed vigor. There is an assault on
Kharkov in the South, and the siege
of Leningrad continues. But the
Moscow drive is the big act.
Two huge German armies un
der the command of the great
Nazi generals, Von Leeb and Von
Bock, swept out of the Northeast
and Northwest to converge in a
spearhead aimed at the heart of
Bolshevist Russia.
In six weeks the heavy snows will
blanket Moscow. The Germans
would like to get there in time to
set up headquarters and hot toddies
for the High Command.
But Uncle Joe Stalin likes good
solid comfort, too, for he is the top
Commissar in Communist Russia.
The Kremlin is a cozy hang-out and
he means to hold onto it.

JJETWEEN the Nazi columns and
the gates of Moscow stand crack
divisions of the Red Army. These
are soldiers carefully picked for the
sacred duty of defending the holy
city of Red Russia against the in
vader.
They are rested, well-equipped,
diig-in, and fanatically inspired.
They are the elite of the Red
guard and, remembering Lenin
grad and Odessa—and Kiev—they
will stand and fight.
Authoritative sources said the new
offensive "undoubtedly is making
some progress." The big drive was
given top play in dispatches from
Berlin and London. Moscow did not
mention it.
Germany's chances of hoisting 17
swastikas this winter from the 17
towers of the Kremlin are pretty
thin. For weeks now the Germans
have laid fierce and unabating siege
to the ports of Odessa and Lenin
grad. They are still rapping on the
gates of both cities. And in both
regions the Russians are counter
attacking severely.
* * *
r is extremely encouraging.
Even should the Nazis crash
through to the outskirts of the capi
tal before the heavy snows—which
is not entirely unlikely—they would
still have to engage in the same
kind of pitched battle which thus
far has not been successful, except
at Kiev. And the Moscow defenses
are far stronger than any which the
Germans have encountered.
In addition to this difficulty,
which the Nazis will he facing any
day now, there is the problem of
Russian counter-blows in the
North and South which seem
daily to be gaining in strength.
If these should develop into or
ganized. dynamic counter-attacks
while the Germans are concentrating
their power in the central sector, the
Nazis might conceivably be forced
to let up the pressure on Moscow
and send reinforcements to the other
fronts.

HITLER knows all this as
1 well as you or lorH. V. Kal
tenborn. He knew, too, when he first
attacked the Soviet that it would be
a long tough grind. But he thought
he could mop up in 70 days.
Now, it's a matter of six weeks.
If Der Fuehrer wants to keep snug
through the winter, he had better
adjust the time table.
