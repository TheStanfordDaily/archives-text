# Germans Unleash Massive Pincers in Moscow Drive
## Hitler Begins Last-Chance Effort To Beat Snow to Russian Capital 
### United Press 
A vicious pincers drive calculated to csconce Hitler in the Kremlin be
fore heavy winter snow arrives within six weeks was being countered by
the Russians yesterday, with the Reds claiming fierce defense on both the
Leningrad and Black Sea fronts.
The pincers are closing on Moscow from the northern and central
fronts, with a terrific impact of artillery, tanks and planes being hurled
against the Red defenders.

BERLIN, Oct. 6 (UP). — A great
new German offensive is smashing
steadily deeper into Russia, military
spokesman claimed tonight, refusing
to confirm or deny foreign reports
that panzer units already are attack
ing in the area of Kalinin, 100 miles
northwest of Moscow and Orel, 200
miles to the south.
DRIVE DEFINED
Kalinin is 178 miles east of the
last reported German position in
that section of the front. Last week
a Nazi spokesman displayed a map
showing a battle line that ran from
Lake Ilmen, below Leningrad,
southwestward through Kholm,
which is almost due west of Kalinin.
Authorized spokesmen, the official
DNB news agency and propaganda
company reporters all avoided any
hint as to the objectives of the new
drive which coincided with claims of
heavy casualties inflicted on the
Russians in a Red landing attempt
on the coast southwest of Leningrad
and another attempt to pierce Ger
man land lines encircling Russia's
second largest city.
LENINGRAD HIT
A spokesman said the Russians'
unsuccessful landing attempt near
Leningrad occurred east of Peterhof
in the bay of Kronstadt.
Several fully-loaded Russian ships
were sunk, "severe" casualties in
flicted on the troops, and 22 Russian
tanks destroyed. The Luftwaffe
Sunday night bombed military ob
jectives in Leningrad, the com
munique said.

■ LONDON, Oct. 6 (UP). — Adolf
Hitler has launched a massive pinc
ers drive against Moscow from the
northern and central fronts, throw
ing in great forces of artillery and
tanks and at least two air fleets of
3,000 planes each, hoping to capture
and set up winter headquarters in
ihe Red capital before the first
heavy snows, authoritative sources
said today.
TRIANGLE FORMED
The reported area of operations
formed almost an equilateral triangle
of Russian territory, with Moscow at
the focal point. Marshal Fedor von
Bock's central front armies were
striking northeast from Roslavl, 70
miles southeast of Smolensk, and
Marshal Wilhelm von Lecb's north
ern troops moved southeast from
the Valdai hills. Each of these
points is 230 miles from Moscow.
They are 300 miles apart, on an al
most straight north-south line.
This was believed to be the "op
eration of gigantic dimensions"
which Hitler said in his speech last
Friday had been under way for 48
hours. It apparently was accompa
nied by a general offensive along the
whole front, including an assault on
Kharkov in the south.
BIGGEST JOB
It was believed that the assault
would be a race against the heavy
snows expected to blanket Moscow
in six weeks.
However, the Germans' failure to
take either Odessa or Leningrad
after long sieges and fierce assaults,
and the fact that the best trained
and best equipped of all the Soviet
troops undoubtedly guard the ap
proaches to Moscow, confronted Hit
ler with the most difficult objective
he ever has sought.
