In the initial broadcast, Dr.

Monroe Doctrine be expanded to in
clude the Lima declaration of 1938.
The '38 declaration provided for
consultation among all the 21 Amer
ican republics in case of aggression
from abroad against the Western
Hemisphere, The Monroe Doctrine
has traditionally been a unilateral
policy of the United States to resist
aggression.
READ IN SPANISH
The speech, written by Dr. Wil
bur, was read in Spanish by Dr.
Walter V. Kaulfers, of the education
department. He was introduced by
Mrs. Maria Hoge, director of the Of
fice of Pan-American Relations in
the Hoover War Library.
In reference to his proposal for ex
panding the Monroe Doctrine, Dr.
Wilbur said:
. "To invoke that early document
under such a division would be tc
hear the voice of our hemisphere
shouting the realization of our his
torical aspirations."
THREE-POINT PLAN
A three-point plan, designed to
bring about hemisphere solidarity,
was proposed:
1. "Our free democracy demands
that each nation develop to the ut
most its own unique pattern of cul
ture. Before us lies the task of in
culcating in our people knowledge,
respect, and admiration of the spirit
which animates our republics.
2. "Greater diversification of agri
culture will lessen the strain for na
tions which have too much of a
single commodity.
FREE TRADE FLOW
3. "A free flow of trade between
our countries presupposes a means
of communication. . . . The means
with which to build a network of
roads throughout our hemisphere
wili be found."
