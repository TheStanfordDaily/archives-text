The sale of tickets to the U.S.C.
and California football games at the
B.A.C. enters its second and next-to
last day this morning at 8:30. The
sale ends tomorrow at 5 o'clock.
Long querues winding out through
the B.A.C. front doors and well out
along the sidewalk yesterday gave
corroboration to Publicity Director
Don Liebendorfer's statement urging
students to get their tickets early
since ducats to these games always
go fast. B.A.C. officials expected
near-record first-day sale.

in Los Angeles, is $1.10 apiece. In
addition, each student is allowed to
purchase six general public tickets
at $2.75 each.
For the Big Game, rooters' tick
ets are $1.65 each, and four general
