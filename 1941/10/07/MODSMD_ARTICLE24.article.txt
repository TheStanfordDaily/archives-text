Ted Schroeder, Stanford's No. 1

little time to practice due to his

the form that carried him to the
national junior title five years ago,
while he was still i U.C.L.A. under
graduate.
DEE, WADE WIN

no end of money. A crowd of 100,
including one volleyball team and
one soccer team, watched the exhi

steadied Miss Larkin to take the
singles match, 6-3, 6-4. Tony Smith

one dime per shot which netted them
no end of money. A crowd of 100,

one soccer team, watched the exhi
