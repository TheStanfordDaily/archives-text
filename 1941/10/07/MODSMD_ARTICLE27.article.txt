LONDON, Tuesday, o<?t. 7 (UP).
—The "second phase" of a German
plan to invade Britain last summer
was smashed by Royal Air Force
bombers which blasted 3,000 barges
concentrated along the coasts of
France and Holland, taking an un
told number of German lives, the
A.F. reported today.
In a 130-page booklet called "The
Bomber Command" — the story of
Britain's bombers since the start of
the war—the Royal Air Force said
the barges probably "were destined
to play a part of the second stage
oi the attack in which the first stage
was to destroy our naval and air
1 ases and our fighter forces and
thus gain command of the air."
