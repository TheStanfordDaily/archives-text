# Yankees Win, 3-1, To Cop Series
## Dodgers Get Only 4 Hits In Final Tilt 
### 
NEW YOriK, Oct. 6 (UP).â€”Old
Man River and the New York Yank
ees just keep rolling along, and to
day the Brooklyn Dodgers went
down for the last time and were
drowned in the Hood.
Playing before a hostile crowd of
34,072 at Ebbetts Field, the Yankees
defeated the Dodgers, 3 to 1, and
won their fifth world championship
in the last six years. It was the
ninth time in the history of the
game that the Bronx Bombers have
taken baseball's richest prize.
ERNIE COMES THROUGH
Manager Joe McCarthy of the
Yankees entrusted this champion
ship-clinching game to big Ernie
Bonham, who held the Dodgers to
four stingy hits and one measly run.
In the second inning the Yanks
got lo Wyatt. Charlie Keller walked
after working the count to three and
two and Bill Dickey shot a single to
center and Keller went to third.
Keller scored when Wyatt heaved a
wild pitch two feet over the head of
Catcher Mickey Owen. Dickey went
to second on the play, and scored
when Joe Gordon singled to right.
HENRI'CH HOMERS
In the fifth inning Tommy Hen
rich picked out the first pitch and
the ball sailed over the right field
screen for a home run.
The Dodgers picked up their lone
run in the third when Wyatt
dropped a double into the left field
corner of the park. Dixie Walker
Hied out to DiMaggio and Wyatt
held second, but Lew Riggs, substi
tute third baseman, bounced a single
off Bonham's right leg.
WYATT SCORES
Wyatt went to third and Bonham
was in his one tough spot of the
game. He forced Pete Reiser, a
dangerous hitter, to fly to Henrich in
right field, but Wyatt scored after
the catch. Dolph Camilli, left
handed power hitter of the Dodgers,
was up there swinging his big bat,
but Bonham struck him out.
The Dodgers made their dying
gasp in the last half of the ninth.
With two out, Manager Leo Duro
cher sent Jim Wasdell in to hit for
Reese. He hoisted a high fly, DiMag
gio broke fast to his left in center
field, gathered the ball in his big
brown glove and the World Series
was over.
