JIMMIE FOXX, left, and lies! hitting Ted Williams, both of Boston
Red Sox, can't witness World Series, but take it in from listening post
at San Francisco's St. Francis Hotel. The Red Sox lost out to the
Yankees for a crack at the World Series. Williams, with a .405 this
year, is the first man to top .400 in major leagues since 1930.
