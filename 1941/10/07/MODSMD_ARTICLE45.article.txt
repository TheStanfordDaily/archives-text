r |pHOTS thunk up while watching the Cards squash the Bruins last Sat
urday (continued from yesterday):
By not starting the game. Chuck Taylor, regular left guard who sits on
the bench to allow his replacement, Kenny Robesky, to kick off, gets a
good chance to see what's going on out on the field and, consequently, is
prepared to play a smarter game when he does enter. If that's the answer
to his great performance Saturday, when he played a good share of the
game in the Bruin backfield, let's hope the Indians lose the toss and have
to kick off in each game.
Many of Frankie Albert's incomplete passes were long ones. The
short flips usually connected. Perhaps the reason was the great amount
of work the Bruins did in preparation for the Indians' long passing
attack, which gave the Ducks so much trouble the week before. Mr.
Frank didn't have as much time to get off bis passes against the Bruins
as he did against the Ducks, for Ucla rushed hard, in contrast to the
Oregon boys, who played a waiting game.
Another of the innumerable instances when Albert used the old noodle
came late in the second quarter, when, with time growing short before the
end of the half, Mr. Frank called two plays in the huddle instead of one;
consequently, after Bill Sheller failed to hit pay dirt on the first attempt,
the outfit ran the second play without wasting the time of a huddle. Sheller
scored.
Despite Stanford's victory, there were two people in particular who
were a little sad Saturday. One was Henry Norberg Sr., father of the big
left end; the other was one Dick Palmer, the first-string right guard of
last season, who is no longer in school. Hank Sr., who has watched the
team practice every day since his son has been on it and who has been
waiting years to see "little" Hank play a complete season of college foot
ball, must have felt his heart drop to the bottom of his shoes when the
huge, blond-haired Palo Alto boy failed to get to his feet only one play
after he entered the game. And Palmer couldn't have been sitting there
and watching that outfit play ball without wishing that he were with them
again. Palmer is taking things easy nowadays; he isn't planning on return
ing to Stanford, according to information i-eceived from usually reliable
sources.
* * * *
was some very good ball played by the host of reserves who
saw action against the Bruins. Some say it was just that the Bruins
were softened up by the regulars; we would rather think that the subs
did well.
Third-Stringer R<tg Laverty came through in fine style when he un
expectedly had to play a good part of the game to fill in for the injured
Norberg and Arnic Meiners. And Sheller showed up well, too. As good
as he is. Milt Vucinich is going to have to keep right on plugging to
stay in front of the up-and-coming Conipton lad who transferred
here from Long Beach J. C. last spring. Sheller showed plenty of
straight-ahead power.
Ray Durham, too, looked good when he replaced Ray Hammett, who,
in turn, had replaced Mr. AIl-American. It's remarkable how much Dur
ham walks, runs, and acts like the inimitable Albert. We wouldn't be
surpi'ised to see Durham as the first substitute at quarterback soon.
Coincidence Department: Stanford's Frankie Forbes and Ucla's Teddy
Forbes both wore number 54 on their jerseys.
Wonder what Cal's defeat by Washington State makes St. Mary's, for
the Cougars, who were defeated by the team that was defeated by Stan
ford, themselves defeated the team that defeated the Gaels.

to kick off in each game.
Many of Frankie Albert's incomplete passes were long ones. The
short flips usually connected. Perhaps the reason was the great amount
of work the Bruins did in preparation for the Indians' long passing
attack, which gave the Ducks so much trouble the week before. Mr.
Frank didn't have as much time to get off bis passes against the Bruins
as he did against the Ducks, for Ucla rushed hard, in contrast to the
Oregon boys, who played a waiting game.
Another of the innumerable instances when Albert used the old noodle
came late in the second quarter, when, with time growing short before the
end of the half, Mr. Frank called two plays in the huddle instead of one;
consequently, after Bill Sheller failed to hit pay dirt on the first attempt,
the outfit ran the second play without wasting the time of a huddle. Sheller
scored.
Despite Stanford's victory, there were two people in particular who
were a little sad Saturday. One was Henry Norberg Sr., father of the big
left end; the other was one Dick Palmer, the first-string right guard of
last season, who is no longer in school. Hank Sr., who has watched the
team practice every day since his son has been on it and who has been
waiting years to see "little" Hank play a complete season of college foot
ball, must have felt his heart drop to the bottom of his shoes when the
huge, blond-haired Palo Alto boy failed to get to his feet only one play
after he entered the game. And Palmer couldn't have been sitting there
and watching that outfit play ball without wishing that he were with them
again. Palmer is taking things easy nowadays; he isn't planning on return
ing to Stanford, according to information i-eceived from usually reliable
sources.

was some very good ball played by the host of reserves who
saw action against the Bruins. Some say it was just that the Bruins
were softened up by the regulars; we would rather think that the subs
did well.
Third-Stringer R<tg Laverty came through in fine style when he un
expectedly had to play a good part of the game to fill in for the injured
Norberg and Arnic Meiners. And Sheller showed up well, too. As good
as he is. Milt Vucinich is going to have to keep right on plugging to
stay in front of the up-and-coming Conipton lad who transferred
here from Long Beach J. C. last spring. Sheller showed plenty of
straight-ahead power.
Ray Durham, too, looked good when he replaced Ray Hammett, who,
in turn, had replaced Mr. AIl-American. It's remarkable how much Dur
ham walks, runs, and acts like the inimitable Albert. We wouldn't be
surpi'ised to see Durham as the first substitute at quarterback soon.
