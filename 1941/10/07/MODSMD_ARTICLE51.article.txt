and fourth string men through a
scrimmage in preparation for their
hegira to Corvallis Thursday to play
the Oregon State Beavers.
The regulars underwent a short
dummy scrimmage handling a ball

in a pail of water. Shaughnessy is
getting prepared for all kinds of
weather up north.
Arnie Meiners and Eric Armstrong
resumed their left end and right
halfback spots on the first squad
with apparently no ill efTects linger
ing from their injuries. However,
