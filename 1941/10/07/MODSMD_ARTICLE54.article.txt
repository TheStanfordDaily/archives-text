# Stanford Favored To Retain Title
## 
### 
The football situation out West
is in deep confusion. Three upsets
over the week-end left Stanford and
Montana the only undefeated Pa
cific Coast Conference teams and
Stanford the odds-on favorite to
retain its conference title.
This week U.C.L.A. seeks to check
Montana's winning streak in a Fri
day night game in Los Angeles;

Washington goes to Pullman to play
Washington State; U.S.C. seeks a
comeback against Oregon at Los
Angeles; Oregon State entertains
Stanford at Corvallis; Idaho meet
Gonzaga in Friday-nighter at Spo
kane.
California comes back home to
play unbeaten Santa Clara at Berke
ley.
