# B.A.C. Rules Out Crew
## 
### 
THE prelude to last Saturday's football game
in the stadium—the parade of Block "S"
men from every class in Stanford's 50-year his
tory—'was a most impressive sight. .
Some of those men wearing the Block "S"
were around Stanford in the 'twenties. They
won their letters and brought fame to Stanford
as crew members rowing to national champion
ships.
Then crew was discontinued.
A little more than a year ago a few fellows
who had had some rowing experience banded
together to attempt a revival of interest in the
long-forgotten sport. They wanted to row for
the love of the sport and with the hope that
some day Stanford could possibly achieve again
the recognition she had lost.
The Board of Athletic Control told them there
would be absolutely no financial support from
the school. Far from being dismayed, they went
ahead and formed the Stanford Boat Club.
The accomplishments of this group were al
most inconceivable. They assessed themselves
a sizeable sum for each member. They built
their own training scow. The Redwood City
Harbor agreed to let them use its facilities, and
built them a launching float. The club members
built their own boathouse. Cal gave them a
shell and Washington promised them another
for this year. They got grad students who had
rowed at other colleges to coach them, at no
pay of course. They persuaded the School of
Physical Education to give them a gym credit
for the work they were doing.
They rowed in three races last year, paying
all their own traveling expenses, and making
a fair showing for their first competition. They
have the best and closest practice course {2Vz
miles) on the Coast with the exception of Wash
ington. With donations from interested alumni
and the money they put up themselves, they
have at present an investment of about $1,000
in the sport.
They had made pians this year, with the
extra shell to be a gift from the University of
Washington, to have a frosh crew and inter
squad competition as well as a few unofficial
intercollegiate races.
All this past work and future planning has
been knocked for a loop by the School of Physi
cal Education. They have refused to give the
fellows a unit of gym credit for crew.
This means that no shell will be forthcoming
from Washington and that lower division men
will not be able to turn out for crew. The time
they would put in on crew—something they
really wanted to do—will be taken up fulfilling
their two-year gym requirement with some
other sport.
As a consequence of this, crew will undoubt
edly die out as soon as the juniors and seniors
v/ho founded the club leave school.
Dr. Anderson, director of the School of Physi
cal Education, lists the following reasons as re
sponsible for his decision to abolish the one
unit of gym credit for crew; beneath each rea
son The Daily suggests a means of surmount
ing that objection:
1. The sport is off the campus and not super
vised by a member of the staff, thus providing
difficulty in keeping the records.
Crew could never be brought to the cam
pus, but as in other sports such as rugby a
coach may be officially appointed by the
University. WITH NO PAY. He would Assume
responsibility for operation of the course in
accordance with the standards of the School
of Physical Education. The coach is willing.
2. It is not supported by the University or the
Boad of Athletic Control and not recognized by
the Faculty Athletic Committee.
This objection could probably be met by
assurances that there would be absolutely
no request for financial or any other aid, that
any competition entered would be under the
name of the Stanford Boat Club, a private
organization of students, and not the Stanford
University crew. And the boys wouldn't mind
not getting blocks either, though they would
be working harder than in some other sports.
3. Since the sport is off the campus, the
school cannot take any responsibility for acci
dents or injuries incurred while students are
rowing or making the 15-minute trip between
here and Redwood City.
Every boy out for the sport would, we have
personally been assured, be willing to sign
a waiver releasing the University or any
branch thereof from any responsibility. Mi
nors will get their parents' signatures; those
over 21 will gladly accept this responsibility.
Underlying these objections we feel there
must be something else possibly a fear of
favorable publicity in city papers and an in
crease in the popularity of the sport which might
lead despite the fellows' present statements

at some time in the future to request lor official
recognition and financial support.
Still all that is being asked is that gym credit
be given. If this were granted for even a quar
ter or a year, the University reserving the right
to revoke it on violation of the standards of
physical education courses, some progress
would be gained.
It is our sincere hope that the Boat Club keeps
up its fight and that some such solution can be
worked out.
We would not like to see crew be completely
dropped again, this time for a few mere techni
calities.
