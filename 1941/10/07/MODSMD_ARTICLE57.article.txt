READY, sweep. Led into the fray by that con
genial chairman of cheers and consumer
of cheer, ye olde Charlie Bull, the Daily cleanup
gang will meet at 2 this afternoon to sweep out
last week's false mustaches and alumni who
are planning to spend the next fifty years living
in the Shack and cooking over the dark-room hot
plate.
