# BULL SESSION
## 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT
r jpHERE is absolutely nothing to talk about today. At
least I can't think of anything. I leaned over and
told this to one of our ace reporters, and she told me
that it happened to all Bull Sessioners. I went over
and told the managing editor, and he laughed "ha ha,"
and said "A blank, eh?" Neither one of them helped.
Nothing can help. I'm dead.
But suddenly a water-bag splashed into the room.
Then the news filtered down from the front of the
Shack that The Stanford Daily was officially at war
with The Chaparral. Things buzzed. All windows were
closed, the door was slammed shut, the wind seemed to
sense the drama and gave a howl.
After the first few sensational splashes of water, the
battle settled down to sneaking around the windows,
waiting and planning, then another burst of activity,
and more confusion. Then funny Chappie men stretched
a plank across their building to the roof of the Shack,
and crossed and then the water poured down on the
windows until it looked like rain. Then it was over.
Everyone was wet. Nothing was settled except that
most of the Chaparral staff are goats. Everyone was
wet except Rieser, who was busy showing a girl the
way to draw cartoons.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
so that was finished and still no subject any
where, nothing to write about, so I think I'll tell a
little story.
An energetic young girl took up working for the
Inter-Faith Council. It was her duty or job or pleas
ure to see the girls and try to drum up business for
the various Christian organizations. One day in the
course of her duty, job, or pleasure she gave a pious
knock on one of the Roble rooms. "If you know any
dirty jokes, come in," was the only answer she got.
She knew two of them but didn't go in.
Another story goes like this. It's about a freshman.
About the second day of school he rushed up, hap
pily shook my hand and said, "Isn't it wonderful that
this is a coeducational school."
I could go on like this for quite a while, but I
haven't a subject and have a savat class in the gym.
But one thing before we quit. Thinking about the
water and people climbing on roofs, I remembered last
Wednesday night and how easily people forget things.

But one thing before we quit. Thinking about the
water and people climbing on roofs, I remembered last
Wednesday night and how easily people forget things.
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT
r jpHERE is absolutely nothing to talk about today. At
least I can't think of anything. I leaned over and
told this to one of our ace reporters, and she told me
that it happened to all Bull Sessioners. I went over
and told the managing editor, and he laughed "ha ha,"
and said "A blank, eh?" Neither one of them helped.
Nothing can help. I'm dead.
But suddenly a water-bag splashed into the room.
Then the news filtered down from the front of the
Shack that The Stanford Daily was officially at war
with The Chaparral. Things buzzed. All windows were
closed, the door was slammed shut, the wind seemed to
sense the drama and gave a howl.
After the first few sensational splashes of water, the
battle settled down to sneaking around the windows,
waiting and planning, then another burst of activity,
and more confusion. Then funny Chappie men stretched
a plank across their building to the roof of the Shack,
and crossed and then the water poured down on the
windows until it looked like rain. Then it was over.
Everyone was wet. Nothing was settled except that
most of the Chaparral staff are goats. Everyone was
wet except Rieser, who was busy showing a girl the
way to draw cartoons.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
so that was finished and still no subject any
where, nothing to write about, so I think I'll tell a
little story.
An energetic young girl took up working for the
Inter-Faith Council. It was her duty or job or pleas
ure to see the girls and try to drum up business for
the various Christian organizations. One day in the
course of her duty, job, or pleasure she gave a pious
knock on one of the Roble rooms. "If you know any
dirty jokes, come in," was the only answer she got.
She knew two of them but didn't go in.
Another story goes like this. It's about a freshman.
About the second day of school he rushed up, hap
pily shook my hand and said, "Isn't it wonderful that
this is a coeducational school."
I could go on like this for quite a while, but I
haven't a subject and have a savat class in the gym.
