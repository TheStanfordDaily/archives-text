(Editor's Note: The following letter was writ
ten to the Phi Kap house by Robert Council, '40,
from army camp way down in Texas. Listen to the
voice of Stanford in the army.)

October 3, 1941
jJEAR. HOUSE:
Your curiosity having been piqued by the head
ing on this stationery, you may read further. Then
again, fearing some sort of belated draft notice, you
may not.
Anyhow, calm your fears as I have taken the Army
well in hand. I won it in the lottery, and latest dope
from GHQ, whatever that means, is that they are
going to let everyone else out and let me handle the
thing alone. That way the Army won't be getting out
of step so much.
This place is really sumpin' and I would write
reams about K.P., etc., but that is all on the seamy
side. Suffice it to say that it reminds me not a little
of Hell Week at the Phi Kap house, only the "week"
part is a little different.
In between our menial tasks, we manage to sneak
a potshot or two with such weapons as the Springfield,
Garand, Browning, Colt automatic, and dummy hand
grenades. If you have never heard the Hut Sut Song
sung by a column of marching men in gas masks on
a very hot day, brother, you haven't lived.
After waltzing through a gas chamber, cloudy with
tear gas, I sat right down and wrote the Duchess Spinelli
for a date—or isn't she still alive either?
No, I'm not the company clerk and this is the
same typewriter I used to keep everyone on the sleep
ing porch awake with. Even now, I hear the tired
soldiers pleading with me to give up this mad under
taking and go to bed. "It's full field packs in the
morning," they cry, clapping their tiny hands to
gether but never quite crushing the bedbugs which in
fest the joint.
If any of the glorious Class of '40 have been around,
perhaps they have told you of my plight. I've been
here six weeks—half of my training period—and am:
1. Sharpshooter with the "03,"
2. Expert with the bayonet (medal with two palms),
3. Squad leader and acting corporal,
4. Very tired of it all.
For a man with a sense of humor and a mirror the
Army offers limitless opportunities to laugh. Our
natty "Texas serge," blue denims to you guys, fatigue
uniforms, make us all look quite droll, especially me.
But let's talk about you. I got a rushing card from
our worthy rushing chairman but, unfortunately, most
of the fellows I've met lately have already been
pledges, and I do mean selected. "We've been looking
you over and we've decided that you're just the sort
of fellow who would fit in."
Half of our bunch are from California, the state,
not the mud flat, and the rest are a weird aggregation
dubbed "Arkies" by the suave Coasters. These refugees
from a hill-billy band don't have cadence counted for
them in the usual way. The sergeant just hollers,
"This foot, that foot," as we swing along through six
inches of mud.
Chair will entertain a motion to adjourn. So move!
The meeting was adjourned at the motion of Brother
Connell, who will now go to bed.
Fraternally yours, or, as we say in the infantry,
"Keep 'Em Walking,"
Robert Connell
