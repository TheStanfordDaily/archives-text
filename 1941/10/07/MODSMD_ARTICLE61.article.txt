# Bandit Queen 'Belle Starr' Proves Disappointing Film
## 
### 
''BELLE STARK," now playing at the Fox-Stanford Theater in Palo
Alto.
The public has been deluged by a variety of Southern Civil War
heroines from almost every state in the Confederacy. Now Missouri makes
its bid for fame in Twentieth Century Fox's most recent epic, "Belle
Starr the Bandit Queen."

Featuring Scarlett O'Hara - con
scious Gene Tierney as little Missy
Belle, the brave girl who takes the
entire burden of revenging the de
feat of the South on her own pretty
shoulders, this film is notable solely
for Natalie Kalmus' magnificent
technicolor photography. Unfortu
nately the producers have taken it
upon themselves to whitewash the
character of history's lusty Mrs.
Starr, and therefore effectively do
away with any reason there may
have been to make the picture in
the first place. Pretty Miss Tierney
plays Belle as a cooing, ultra-femi
nine creature, giving little hint of
being the "devfl" that practically
every character in the picture insists
she is. The hot temper credited to
her is displayed only in childish
tantrums and some of the most im
mature acting ever seen on stage or
screen.
SCOTT IS WOODEN
As her outlaw lover, Randolph
Scott turns in his usual wooden per
formance. We regret to say that Mr.
Scott nearly ruins our lovely
heroine's faith in human nature by
not sharing her noble and altruistic
feelings in respect to the South. After
happily knocking off some unsus
pecting Missourians and blithely
robbing and beating a few more, he
finally sees the light; but a dreadful
price is exacted in return. Our
Belle, the guide and inspiration of as
unfcavory a pack of outlaws as was
ever seen, dies at the hands of the
low and skulking villain; dies with
her boots on—a fact which is borne
out by a shot of her corpse wrap
ped in a blanket, her well-encased
feet pathetically sticking out at the
end.
LONG AND DULL
Directed by Irving Cummings,
"Belle Starr" proves to be too long
and very dull, despite the ridin'
and shootin' that goes on continually.
The nobility of every character in
the picture, with each one doing his
duty to God and country—excepting
Mr. Scott's Sam Starr, whose lapse
is only too short—becomes extreme
ly tedious and, eventually, funny.
But it isn't funny enough to sustain
interest, and therefore the movie
can't even be termed an amusing
horse opera.
Filling out the bill is another of
those Charlie Chan movies. This
time the erudite detective is in Rio,
but (he only difference between that
lovely city and all the others in
which Chan has found himself seems
to be the presence of a few samba
dancers.—Livingston
