### AMIE REICHERT 
President Roosevelt
touched—somewhat experimen
tally—two of the sorest spots in
America's defense set-up: the Neu
trality Act and Organized Labor.
Both sores have been festering
for some months now, and appar
ently the Doctor thinks the time
for treatment lias come. In the
case of the first, he recommended
an operation. As for the second,
lie did not say whether he will
continue to salve, or be forced to
amputate. It depends on the pa
tient.
There was a two and a half hour
consultation at the White House yes
terday, attended by congressional
leaders of both parties, plus Secre
tary of State Hull, and Harry Hop
kins.
Mr. Roosevelt told these gentle
men that he desired the repeal of
the two sections of the Neutrality
Act which forbid the arming of
American merchant ships and bar
them from belligerent zones.
* * St
QNE jY violent disagreements of the
conference were over method:
whether the revisions should be
.sought in the form of one bill or
two, and whether the proposed
modifications should be initiated in
the House or the Senate.
Senate majority leader Alben W.
Barcley told members of the press
that he was confident complete
agreement would be arrived at when
the conferees meet tomorrow. He
said Mi'. Roosevelt "undoubtedly"
will send a message to Congress out
lining his program.
Complicating the already troub
lesome situation was the decree of
the Panamanian Cabinet forbid
ding the arming of merchant
ships Hying its Hag. There arc
about 125 American-owned ships
under Panamanian colors, and of
these, some eight or nine have
been armed.
These ships have been transferred
to Panamanian registry in order to
permit their carrying war materials
into combat zones. Under Pan
namas' new decree they may still
enter war zones but must not mount
guns.
The U.S. now faces the alternatives
of (1) revising our Neutrality Act,
as the President proposes, (2) re
moving guns from American ships
flying the Panamanian flag, (3) trans
ferring registry of the ships ot some
other country.
Presumably one or the other of
the last two plans will be carried
out, until such time as legislation on
the Neutrality Act £oes through.

| JEALING with the labpr sore
spot, Mr. Roosevelt was less con
crete. He indicated no specific ac
tion against recalcitrant unions
which have persistently bottle
necked defense industries through
out the nation.
The President sent a strong
message to the A. F. of L. con
vention urging cessation of walk
outs in vital industries and a set
tlement of A. F. of L. - C. I. O.
hostilities.
Day before yesterday, A. F. of L.
President William Green pledged his
organization to follow the Adminis
tration to "the bitter end" if it be
came necessary to take "more deci
sive action to protect the freedom of
the seas and democracy throughout
the world."
Mr. Green had also asserted that
all A. F. of L. work stoppages in de
fense industries were of a minor
character. But the reaction of some
delegates, following the President's
message, was that stronger methods
should be employed from here on in
to prevent walkouts.

JVEW DEAL policy toward Or
ganized Labor for the past eight
years has been notoriously indul
gent. Despite the apparent refusal
of labor to sacrifice one jot of what
it has gained in the past few years
now that a national emergency has
been declared, the government has
done little more than continue to
coddle and scold gently its worst
problem child.
Only in two cases have U. S.
troops taken over paralyzed de
fense industries. For the rest, the
Administration has lectured and
rapped knuckles and frowned and
occasionally threatened.

about 125 American-owned ships
under Panamanian colors, and of
these, some eight or nine have
been armed.

to Panamanian registry in order to
permit their carrying war materials

There was a two and a half hour
consultation at the White House yes

leaders of both parties, plus Secre

Mr. Roosevelt told these gentle
men that he desired the repeal of
the two sections of the Neutrality
Act which forbid the arming of
American merchant ships and bar
them from belligerent zones.

QNE jY violent disagreements of the
conference were over method:
whether the revisions should be

two, and whether the proposed
modifications should be initiated in
the House or the Senate.
Senate majority leader Alben W.
Barcley told members of the press
that he was confident complete
agreement would be arrived at when
the conferees meet tomorrow. He
said Mi'. Roosevelt "undoubtedly"
will send a message to Congress out

Complicating the already troub
lesome situation was the decree of
the Panamanian Cabinet forbid
ding the arming of merchant
ships Hying its Hag. There arc
about 125 American-owned ships
under Panamanian colors, and of
these, some eight or nine have
been armed.
These ships have been transferred
to Panamanian registry in order to
permit their carrying war materials
into combat zones. Under Pan
namas' new decree they may still
enter war zones but must not mount
guns.
The U.S. now faces the alternatives
of (1) revising our Neutrality Act,
as the President proposes, (2) re
moving guns from American ships
flying the Panamanian flag, (3) trans
ferring registry of the ships ot some
other country.
Presumably one or the other of
the last two plans will be carried
out, until such time as legislation on
the Neutrality Act £oes through.

The President sent a strong
message to the A. F. of L. con

outs in vital industries and a set

hostilities.
Day before yesterday, A. F. of L.
President William Green pledged his
organization to follow the Adminis
tration to "the bitter end" if it be
came necessary to take "more deci
sive action to protect the freedom of
the seas and democracy throughout
the world."
Mr. Green had also asserted that
all A. F. of L. work stoppages in de
fense industries were of a minor
character. But the reaction of some
delegates, following the President's
message, was that stronger methods
should be employed from here on in
to prevent walkouts.

JVEW DEAL policy toward Or

of labor to sacrifice one jot of what
it has gained in the past few years
now that a national emergency has
been declared, the government has
done little more than continue to
coddle and scold gently its worst

President Roosevelt
touched—somewhat experimen
tally—two of the sorest spots in
America's defense set-up: the Neu
trality Act and Organized Labor.
Both sores have been festering
for some months now, and appar
ently the Doctor thinks the time
for treatment lias come. In the
case of the first, he recommended
an operation. As for the second,
lie did not say whether he will
continue to salve, or be forced to
amputate. It depends on the pa
