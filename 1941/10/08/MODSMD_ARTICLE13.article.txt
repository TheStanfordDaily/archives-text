### 
Stanford's freshman debaters will
open their current forensic season
Wednesday, Oct. 15, with a l'ound
table discussion of the nation's labor
problems. The meeting will be held
at 7:15 p.m. in the office of Coach
George Peavey in Memorial Hall.
"Resolved: That the Federal Gov
ernment Should Control by Law All
Labor Unions" will be the topic
which will provide the first workout
for the nine speakers signed up for
the squad. Prospects are bright for
a successful season with members
of championship teams from Illi
nois, California, Idaho, and .Montana
forming part of the group.
No interschool meetings have
been planned, but officials believe
that several will be arranged later in
I the quarter. As yet no freshman
manager has been appointed to assist
Varsity Manager Bob Hammett in
handling the beginners.
