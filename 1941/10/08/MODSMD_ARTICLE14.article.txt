# CHILEAN STUDIES 'QUAKES'
## Exchange Scholar Comments on U.S. Likes California, Its Cigarettes Best 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Picking yourself up out of an
| earthquake is no fun, but Danilo
| Luksic, Tarver Exchange scholar,
i just dusted himself off and came up
j to San Francisco, famous for its
earthquakes, to find out more about
I ihem.
Luksic, a student at the Univer-
J sity of Santiago, is the recipient of
\ the Interfraternity scholarship and
j is a graduate student in mining en- |
! gineering. Hugh O'Donnell. head of j
Men's Council last year, was the :
! other receiver of the scholarship.
Dan, after being sidetracked for a i
while over at Berkeley, is adapting i
i himself easily to Stanford life. "It is \
j a lot different than life in Chile, I
where you take a siesta every after- |
; noon for three hours. You can get j
so much more done," he said.
CHILE NEEDS SUPPLIES
Because Chile is so in need of |
I necessary supplies, Dan is hoping for
I an early end of the present conflict,
j so that ships may again regularly
j bring the vital necessities to his
j country.
"You know, Chile's only industries
J are the mining of nitrate and copper.
We are dependent upon the United
States and Europe for so many
| things in exchange for our minerals,
and if we can't exchange them they
i are no good to us, who need wheat,
i medical supplies, and foodstuffs.
"Chile is very unproductive. The
coastline stretches for three thou
| sand miles and the latitude at the
1 widest point is only 120 miles. On

one side is the ocean, and all the
cities and towns are on the slopes of
the mountain range which runs
right down to the shore. The winter
snows annually create floods of

devastating proportions."
"Chile has the highest infant
mortality rate, cancer and tubercu
losis rate in the world. Together with
the frequent earthquakes, Chile is
often laid almost totally to waste."
Luksic went on to say that for the
most part the Germans have brought
a certain prosperity to the country.
They have farmed the country to its
best advantage and are now experi
menting with cotton growing. The
Germans are hard workers and there
is little of the Nazi propaganda at
work that the United States has
heard about.
On the other hand, the govern
ment is divided among the Socialists,
Radicals, and Communists. There
have been dozens of secretaries of
state and other officials in the last
few years. As soon as one faction is
in there is another uprising, unfor
tunately.
LIKES U. S.
"The United States has been very
good to my country," Dan said. "In
the last few years they have given
her a large loan, in addition to much
machinery, medical equipment and
the like. We are grateful."
Dan really likes the States and
would like to live here if there was
not so much to be done in his home
land. The thing he likes best are all
the different kinds of cigarettes. He
really went wild for a while, smok
ing one package of one brand and
then another of a different kind. But
he is all settled now with his studies,
new friends, and cigarettes.

her a large loan, in addition to much
machinery, medical equipment and
the like. We are grateful."
Dan really likes the States and
would like to live here if there was
not so much to be done in his home
land. The thing he likes best are all
the different kinds of cigarettes. He
really went wild for a while, smok
ing one package of one brand and
then another of a different kind. But
he is all settled now with his studies,
new friends, and cigarettes.


DANILO LUKSIC
Picking yourself up out of an
| earthquake is no fun, but Danilo
| Luksic, Tarver Exchange scholar,
i just dusted himself off and came up
j to San Francisco, famous for its
earthquakes, to find out more about
I ihem.
Luksic, a student at the Univer-
J sity of Santiago, is the recipient of
\ the Interfraternity scholarship and
j is a graduate student in mining en- |
! gineering. Hugh O'Donnell. head of j
Men's Council last year, was the :
! other receiver of the scholarship.
Dan, after being sidetracked for a i
while over at Berkeley, is adapting i
i himself easily to Stanford life. "It is \
j a lot different than life in Chile, I
where you take a siesta every after- |
; noon for three hours. You can get j
so much more done," he said.
CHILE NEEDS SUPPLIES
Because Chile is so in need of |
I necessary supplies, Dan is hoping for
I an early end of the present conflict,
j so that ships may again regularly
j bring the vital necessities to his
j country.
"You know, Chile's only industries
J are the mining of nitrate and copper.
We are dependent upon the United
States and Europe for so many
| things in exchange for our minerals,
and if we can't exchange them they
i are no good to us, who need wheat,
i medical supplies, and foodstuffs.
"Chile is very unproductive. The
coastline stretches for three thou
| sand miles and the latitude at the
1 widest point is only 120 miles. On

one side is the ocean, and all the
cities and towns are on the slopes of
the mountain range which runs
right down to the shore. The winter
snows annually create floods of

devastating proportions."
"Chile has the highest infant
mortality rate, cancer and tubercu
losis rate in the world. Together with
the frequent earthquakes, Chile is
often laid almost totally to waste."
Luksic went on to say that for the
most part the Germans have brought
a certain prosperity to the country.
They have farmed the country to its
best advantage and are now experi
menting with cotton growing. The
Germans are hard workers and there
is little of the Nazi propaganda at
work that the United States has
heard about.
On the other hand, the govern
ment is divided among the Socialists,
Radicals, and Communists. There
have been dozens of secretaries of
state and other officials in the last
few years. As soon as one faction is
in there is another uprising, unfor
tunately.
LIKES U. S.
