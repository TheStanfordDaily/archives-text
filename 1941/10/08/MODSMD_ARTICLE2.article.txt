# Nutcracker Blitz Closes On Moscow
## Reds Admit Gigantic Offensive Puts Nazis Close to Objective 
### 
MOSCOW. Oct. 7 (UP). â€”Russia
admitted today that German forces
were crashing through Red defense
lines in a blitzkrieg drive which al
ready has reached to within 125 miles
of Moscow and bids fair to dwarf
all other actions of the war.
Non-British sources in London be
lieved Adolf Hitler was using 2,000,-
000 men in a great nutcracker oper
ation, with more than 450 miles sepa
rating the German armies slicing in
toward the Russian capital from
the Valdai hills on the north and the
Roslavl sector of the central front.
Each is 230 miles from Moscow,
central front. Each is 230 miles from
Moscow.
HEAVY ONSLAUGHT
Moscow's Wednesday morning
communique, reporting operations
for Tuesday, told of heavy fighting
in the vicinity of Yyazma, 125 miles
west of the capital, and Bryansk, 220
miles southwest.
Fighting in the Vyazma vicinity
represented a gain of at least 70
miles for the Germans, according to
previous Soviet communiques.
The Russian admission that Red
troops now face their "greatest trial
by fire" was the outstanding devel
opment in a day which also saw new
German executions in the restive
countries of occupied Europe and
the possibility that Britain may de
clare war on Finland, once consid
ered a sister nation-in-arms.
HISTORIC CLASH
These were the opposing claims
from the eastern front:
1. Russia, calling on her armies to
stand fast, said the Nazi forces were
throwing every bit of armament
they possess into the offensive, in
cluding thousands of airplanes and
even outmoded tanks seized in Bel
gium, Holland, and France. The en
tire 1,800-mile front was reported
blazing with action, with the Soviets
claiming new successes at Mur
mansk, Leningrad and Odessa.
2. Berlin continued its mysterious
silence about the new offensive but
said German forces sweeping east
ward along the Sea of Azov coast
had captured Berdyansk and Mariu
pol, the latter only 100 miles from
the Caucasian gateway of Rostov.
Heavy, continuous German air at-,
tacks were reported, particularly
around Kharkov, key to the Donetz
industrial basin.
