# Excom Debates Big Game Raid Problem; Reaffirms Penalty of Expulsion
## Leaders from Cal Attend Heated Session, Guarantee Presentation Of Stanford Crisis at Berkeley 
### BUD AMES 
Action without entangling interaction was the stand taken last night
b.v Ex Committee in a heated session regarding Cal-Stanford inter-campus
raids which have in the past comc during Bin Game Week.
Guests at the meeting were Ralph Fisher and Catherine Hcnck, Cal
| dudent body president and vice-president, who sat in on the round-

table to inject California viewpoints
into controversial matters.
Result of the conclave, which
lasted late till 10:45, revolves on the
fact that this year, breaking with
the impractical precedent of the last
two, no written agreement will be
signed between California and
Stanford's student presidents prom
ising the absence of campus raids on
the part of respective schools.
JUST SCRAPS
"Past written agreements have
turned into scraps of paper," blasted
George Jackson, A.S.S.U. president.
"They have proved merely some
thing to be run over roughshod. We
will not let this happen again.
"We, the Ex Committee, have no
alternative. A constitutional provi
sion provides that Stanford students
participating in such raids shall be
expelled. This year it will be upheld
to the fullest. In the light of last
week's tragic occurrence on this
campus, it must be upheldâ€”strin
gently.
"During this meeting we have pre
sented our problem and our stand
on this situation to Cal's repre
sentatives. In the light of what they
carry back to their campus, Cali
fornia must act."
NO MINCING
There were no minced words.
California President Fisher sagely
cited several points in California's
student and administrative govern
ment which, being less stringent as to
action and punishment, might prove
bottlenecks to as definite a stand
and as definite a program of counter
raid action as will be taken by
Stanford.
One thing is certain. Cal will
work her own ways to keep raid
crazy students on her campus.
Stanford will work her own ways.
And outside of a mutual under
standing of each other's problem,
there shall exist no entangling
strings, written or otherwise.

More Pacts," page 4.)
Added Stan Owen, chairman of
Men's Council, the body which will
try any offending Stanford raiders,
"I have been talking to Administra
tive heads this last week. Their
warning has been that the unfortu
nate death of last week will weigh
heavily and will act even more as a
'big stick' in dealing with offenses."
Concluded Excom, "There will be
no excuses this time."
