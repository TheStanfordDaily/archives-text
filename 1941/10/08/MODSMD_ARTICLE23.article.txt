# Torpedoing Described By Skipper
## Tanker Was Lighted 'Brilliantly' Before Submarine Struck 
### 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 7 (UP).—
The American-owned Panamanian
(anker I. C. White was brilliantly
illuminated, with a searchlight
(rained on the Panamanian •Hag at
(he mast, when a submarine attacked
it without warning in the American
hemisphere neutrality zone, Capt.
William Mello of Everett, Mass., re
ported today.
One of 34 surviors to arrive here,
Capt. Mello said the attack occur
red in south latitude 10.20 and west
longitude 27.30 (about 450 miles
southwest of Pernambuco, Brazil.)
The attack came in inky darkness
about 15 minutes after midnight on
Sept. 27, inside the American
hemisphere neutrality zone, and with
.such speed and accuracy that one
survivor believed the submarine
commander had advance information j
on the ship's course.
SURVIVORS GRIMY
"It certainly looks like our at
tacker knew our precise route in
order to catch up with us in the
South Atlantic at midnight," he said, i
"although he may have been trail
ing us previously."
The tanker soon became an in
ferno of blazing oil and billowing
smoke. Grimy and covered with oil j
from explosion of the tanks, the sur- j
viors spent seven days in a lifeboat i
before they were rescued. They had I
three cups of water and a few bis- I
cuits, "hard as stone," to nourish j
them daily.
Unable to send a wireless call for j
aid after the ship was torpedoed, I
ihey were forced to abandon ship j
quickly.
HOPE ABANDONED
Two American ships, the Del
Norte and the West Nilus, picked up
17 survivors each and brought them
here today, the Del Norte arriving
first. The I. C. White had been car
rying 70,000 barrels of fuel oil, picked
up at Curacao, Dutch West Indies,
and consigned to the Shell Oil Co. at
Capetown, South Africa.
There was virtually no hope left I
for three nAissing crew members, j
Survivors told United States embas
officials they believed the three !
! ,;.t their lives soon after the attack.

it without warning in the American
hemisphere neutrality zone, Capt.
William Mello of Everett, Mass., re
ported today.
One of 34 surviors to arrive here,
Capt. Mello said the attack occur
red in south latitude 10.20 and west
longitude 27.30 (about 450 miles
southwest of Pernambuco, Brazil.)
The attack came in inky darkness
about 15 minutes after midnight on
Sept. 27, inside the American
hemisphere neutrality zone, and with
.such speed and accuracy that one
survivor believed the submarine
commander had advance information j
on the ship's course.
SURVIVORS GRIMY
"It certainly looks like our at
tacker knew our precise route in
order to catch up with us in the
South Atlantic at midnight," he said, i
"although he may have been trail
ing us previously."
The tanker soon became an in
ferno of blazing oil and billowing
smoke. Grimy and covered with oil j
from explosion of the tanks, the sur- j
viors spent seven days in a lifeboat i
before they were rescued. They had I
three cups of water and a few bis- I
cuits, "hard as stone," to nourish j
them daily.
Unable to send a wireless call for j
aid after the ship was torpedoed, I
ihey were forced to abandon ship j
quickly.
HOPE ABANDONED
