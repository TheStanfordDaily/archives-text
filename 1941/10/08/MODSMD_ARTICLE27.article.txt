LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7 (UP).â€”
Working on the theory that plenty
of hard work on football funda
mentals is bound to improve any
team, Coach Babe Horrell sent the
U.C.L.A. Bruins through their sec
ond tough scrimmage of the week
today. End Ed Bredeing and half
back Howard Hunt did not show up
for practice and team physicians
said they would be out of action Tor
five weeks due to injuries received
in the Palo Alto trimming last week.
