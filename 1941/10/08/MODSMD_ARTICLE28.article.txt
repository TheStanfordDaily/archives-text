# Students Get NYA Training
## Government Bureaus Offer Experience 
### 
After a year's successful trial of
its Public Service Program, Cali
fornia's N.Y.A. is offering eligible
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents the opportunity for work ex
perience in a federal, state, or local
government agency.
Last year the N.Y.A. experimented
with a selected student group inter
ested in public service, according to
Adelaide Palmer, Stanford employ
ment secretary. The experiment
was conducted in pre-determined
locations in a Tew universities in
California, and limited to one hun
dred students, Miss, Palmer ex
plained.
"Due to the successful results of
the program, enthusiastic response
of the students, and willingness of
public agencies to co-operate, other
interested students are invited to
participate this year,'' Miss Palmer
said.
"Employment in the working en
vironment of some branch of gov
ernment enables a student to gain
practical experience along with his
academic training and tends to de
velop in him a greater professional
and occupational competency," the
employment secretary pointed out.
Last year three major assignments
were filled by Stanford students.
Assigned to the Palo Alto City
Council, one student studied exist
ing facilities at the Municipal Air
port and its proposed extension and
presented his findings to the Coun
cil for study.
Another assignment was to make
a detailed study of cases in which
the California Supreme Court
granted hearings, after decisions in
District Courts of Appeal. This
work was requested by Associate
Justice Douglas E. Edmonds. An
other student worked in the Palo
Alto City Auditor's-office.
Students who believe themselves
qualified for this type of assign
ment may obtain application blanks
from the employment office.
