# Swimmers Vie For Positions
## 
### 
With two positions still in doubt,
Stanford's potentially powerful var
sity water polo team begins final
preparations today for a two-game
week-end Friday and Saturday
against Compton J. C. and the pow
erful Olympic Club, respectively.
Head Coach Norton Thornton,
who has definitely set his sights for
the conference championship, is still
undecidcd as to his starters at the
important sprint and goalie spots.
Giving him greatest trouble is the
goalie job which finds four men.
Bob Breckner, Ed Smith, Bert
Singer, and Pete Lee, all about
equal. The first two are lettermen,
Singer, a transfer, has played with
the Olympic Club, and Lee was out
standing on the 1940 freshman cham
pion team.
Just two contenders remain for
the sprint position â€” Bill Mapel,
sharpshooting transfer from U. C.
L. A., and speedy Don Smith, varsity
swimming captain.
The rest of the team, including
Captain Frank Mitchell and Jack
Bleeker, guards; Hadley Bacon and
Fred Manwaring, forwards; and Bob
Jones, centerback, is considered to be
( !" of the best in Farm history by
Mentor Thornton.
