## 
### BOB HANNAH 
Some 100 spectators, huddled in the relative warmth of their automo
biles, watched San Mateo poloisis ride circles around the Stanford polo
team here late yesterday. Final score was San Mateo 11. Stanford
Playing in a manner reminiscent of Tommie Hitchcock, big Boh Smith
of San Mateo whacked the ball down the field time and again for score

set-ups. Charlie Low, of the visitors. +
proved himself to be the sensation
of the day by driving in six of his ■
team's tallies.
Playing for the Indians were Bill j
Dirker (No. 1), Captain Mike Gates
j (No. 2), Ben Snure (No. 3), and Jim
: Niebel (No. 4). The Stanford men ,
j played a tough, hard-riding game j
I but it was obvious from the start ;
| that they were playing an organiza-
I tion out of the collegiate class. J
■ Smith, of San Mateo, is rated at five
| goals by the polo association and he
: played yesterday as if he were a '
I six- or seven-goal man.
The three points that showed on
! Stanford's side of the score board j
! were given them as a handicap, al- i
: though 10 points would have been
! more appropriate, according to the
' grandstand concensus of opinion.
At the beginning of second half it j
looked as if Stanford was going to
treat, itself to a few goals by the
simple process of overpowering the j
somewhat out-of-condition visitors.
But the Indians were unable to get
together, and although individuals
starred at certain times, the com
bined effort necessary for a score
was lacking. The foui th chukker
was without points for either team |
and in the fifth and sixth. San Mateo j
rolled up three more to finish the
game.
