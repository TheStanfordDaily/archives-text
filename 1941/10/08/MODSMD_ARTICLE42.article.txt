SATURDAY was the day of revenge for Stanford's football heroes. Who
has forgotten that black Saturday, November 11, 1939? Everybody? ]
For everyone from a junior on up it is an unforgivable sin. Why? Be
cause that was the day five fool ball teams from the University of Southern
California stuffed five touchdowns and three conversions down the Li'l
Indian's throat.
Although you wouldn't have known it from reading the story that
appeared in The Daily (that's what Dean Culver called the Dippy)
since it was hidden down in the third paragraph, the score was !>3 to 0.
For years after that memorable occasion wherever Stanford men get
throughout the world -Sloppy Joe's in Havana (I learned that in the
movies), a church rummage sale in Saigon, or juke-box-jivin' at the Johns-
Hopkins-Hotel-high-atop-Snob-Hill (call it the John for short) —they
would issue forth the chant, while they stood with one foot on the brass
rail of the soda fountain, "Remember the," and then taking a big breath,
"Los Angeles-Coliseum-on-Novemberll.-1939," along the same vein as
the Texicans when they said "Remember the Alamo" after a fried cholo |
shot up a couple of "B-giils" one night in the Alamo Bar and Tea Shoppe. :

r GET back to the revenge, that 33-0 defeat was a blotch on the escut
cheon of the Farm until Saturday.
No. You're right, we didn't play S.C. last week. It was U.C.L.A. whom
we beat 33-0. However, at the same time Ohio State was deleating the
Trojans by the same score, 33 to 0. To me that is almost complete retalia
tion. Of course, we could go down there in a couple of weeks and run
through them by the same score, but the boys have had their fling and
they will probably go back to their usu;.l last-minute bursts to outscore
the opposition.

All those large numbers remind me of something I've been wonder
ing about for a long time. Why don't they have a 8204H question on
Take-il-or-leave-it, the radio show? They could always have a real
hard question like, "What was the name of Columbus's barber, the
one he had before he moved into the Third street house in Genoa?"
No one, even Columbus, who remembered faces but always had a
heck of a time with names, could answer it, but they would always
keep trying because no one, even Columbus after he found the Na
tional City Bank in the new world, would turn down a chance for
$2048.

W/HICH in turn reminds me of a thought I had the other day in volley- !
" ball class—why don't we have a big rally some night and invite those
two favorite sons of the Farm, Emerson "Bud" Spencer of Saturday Eve
ning Post fame and Tricky Dick Hyland of Tricky Dick Hyland fame, to
; be the guests of honor. Then we could throw rocks at 'em, all in good |
j friendly sport, naturally.

in her first 50 years has done quite well in sports, as well as
all the other fields which have probably been enumerated already.
In looking down the lists of the greatest collegiate athletes Stanford
can be put near in the top in all sports and at the top in several.
Didn't Ernie Nevers get intimidated by Encina laundrymen not so
many years back? You can count the number of his peers on the right
hand of a left-handed one-armed paper hanger.
Didn't Hank Luisetti climb the post office steps at noon a few years
back? He isn't the vice-president in charge of basketball for the Phillips
Oil Co. of Bartlesville, Okla., for nothing, is he?
Didn't Lawson Little dunk little girls in canoes in Lake Lagunita in
the spring of '33?
Didn't Ben Eastman choke on Union cokes too?
Didn't Keith Glcdhill wait in the Reserve Book Room just like you or I?
Didn't Quincy Thrush (he was Olympic single sculls champ in '04) cuss j
j at lockouts on many occasions?
I could go on indefinitely, but you get the idea and also since there is j
j a paper shortage I know the Board of Trusties will appreciate it if I cease, i
