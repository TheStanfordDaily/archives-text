ON page 23 of a little white book titled "Con
stitution and By-Laws of the Associated
Students of Stanford University," is the follow
ing paragraph under Student Control, Section 4,
Intercollegiate Agreements:
"As a result of the existing intercollegiate
agreement between Stanford and the Univer
sity of California, any disturbance, any act
of vandalism, and defacement of property, on
the University of Califoronia campus by Stan
ford students, is prohibited and may be pun
ished by expulsion from the University for
the quarter in which the act occurs, or by
such other disciplinary measures on which
the appropriate Councils for Student Control
may decide."
The "existing agreement" spoken of does not
mean the farcical scrap of paper signed—with
all good intentions—last year by Bruce Jessup
and A.S.U.C. President John McPherson. It
means the agreement between the two Univer
sity presidents, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur and Dr.
Robert Gordon Sproul.
These two men have the power to call off
the Big Game if they see fit.
So it is evident that this provision in our
constitution is not one which can be flouted.
The administration has assured that this rule
is going to ,be enforced to its fullest extent,
meaning expulsion of violators.
Last night Ex Committee thrashed out every
possible detail of the prevention of inter-campus
damage. The discussion was grave, since only
last week the possible corollaries of mass action
were cited in tragic fashion.
The A.S.U.C. president and vice president and
a representative of the Daily Californian were
present. There was a mutual interchange of
problems connected with Big Game raids.
Fortunately when the meeting ended any
thought of the two student body presidents or
the two Ex Committees attempting any form of
collaboration in an effort to solve the problem
had been dropped.
We at Stanford are going to bend every pos
sible effort to eliminating raids on the Berkeley
campus for the best interests of the two schools.
Cal will attempt to solve its own problems, in
the light of its present knowledge of our prob
lems.
This is the best solution possible to a very
thorny problem, far belter than two men sign
ing their names to a pledge which they person
ally cannot keep. Education and reason, backed
by the memory of the death of a fellow student
in similar action, will be our plan.
If the Big Game is to continue, if two of the
most prominent schools in the West are not to
have their names besmirched, if a sportsman
like rivalry can exist without mass hysteria, our
plan will have to succeed.

present. There was a mutual interchange of
problems connected with Big Game raids.
Fortunately when the meeting ended any
thought of the two student body presidents or
the two Ex Committees attempting any form of
collaboration in an effort to solve the problem
had been dropped.
We at Stanford are going to bend every pos
sible effort to eliminating raids on the Berkeley
campus for the best interests of the two schools.
Cal will attempt to solve its own problems, in
the light of its present knowledge of our prob
lems.
This is the best solution possible to a very
thorny problem, far belter than two men sign
ing their names to a pledge which they person
ally cannot keep. Education and reason, backed
by the memory of the death of a fellow student
in similar action, will be our plan.
If the Big Game is to continue, if two of the
most prominent schools in the West are not to
have their names besmirched, if a sportsman
like rivalry can exist without mass hysteria, our
plan will have to succeed.
ON page 23 of a little white book titled "Con
stitution and By-Laws of the Associated
Students of Stanford University," is the follow
ing paragraph under Student Control, Section 4,
Intercollegiate Agreements:
"As a result of the existing intercollegiate
agreement between Stanford and the Univer
sity of California, any disturbance, any act
of vandalism, and defacement of property, on
the University of Califoronia campus by Stan
ford students, is prohibited and may be pun
ished by expulsion from the University for
the quarter in which the act occurs, or by
such other disciplinary measures on which
the appropriate Councils for Student Control
may decide."
The "existing agreement" spoken of does not
mean the farcical scrap of paper signed—with
all good intentions—last year by Bruce Jessup
and A.S.U.C. President John McPherson. It
means the agreement between the two Univer
sity presidents, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur and Dr.
Robert Gordon Sproul.
These two men have the power to call off
the Big Game if they see fit.
So it is evident that this provision in our
constitution is not one which can be flouted.
The administration has assured that this rule
is going to ,be enforced to its fullest extent,
meaning expulsion of violators.
Last night Ex Committee thrashed out every
possible detail of the prevention of inter-campus
damage. The discussion was grave, since only
last week the possible corollaries of mass action
were cited in tragic fashion.
The A.S.U.C. president and vice president and
a representative of the Daily Californian were
present. There was a mutual interchange of
