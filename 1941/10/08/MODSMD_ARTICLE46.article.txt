XVPHE Newspaper Lights the Way of Free-
JL dom."
This is the theme of National Newspaper
Week," Oct. 1-8, and President Roosevelt has
commented fittingly:
. . | it | should awaken in the hearts and
souls of all Americans a renewed determina
tion to defend and maintain and perpetuate the
priceless heritage of a free press."
Freedom of the press is guaranteed in the
First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Fed
eral Constitution and in state constitutions, and
it may well be examined critically during Na
tional Newspaper Week in an effort to eternal
ize this fundamental right of free men.
In a radio address during Newspaper Week,
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, executive head of the
Stanford Division of Journalism, has listed two
immediate dangers to a free press:
1. Dependence of newspapers upon decreas
ing commercial support.
2. Threatened government censorship.
In recognizing during Newspaper Week these
possible pitfalls of press freedom, let us re
member Mr. Robert McCormick's definition of
a newspaper:
"The newspaper is an institution developed
by modern civilization ... to furnish that check
upon government which no constitution has

ever been able to provide."
Let us remember the absolute necessity of
the democratic function of criticism.
Secretary of State Cordell Hull's comment is
pertinent:
"A free and informed press is essential to a
successful program for national defense."
And, tying in the newspaper's contribution
to defense, we reprint a piece by J. Mason Knox,
entitled "Co-operation":
It ain't the guns nor armament,
Nor funds that they can pay,
But the close co-operation
That makes them win the day.
It ain't the individual,
Nor the army as a whole,
But the everlastin' teamwork
Of every bloomin' soul.
The newspaper will chip in and do its part
for the preservation of democracy by maintain
ing bald-eyed vigilance, jealously challenging
the agitator and the fifth-columnist and the sa
boteur and the usurper with the penetrating
searchlight of sound criticism. This can be its
contribution to eternal freedom.â€”Harold Shafer
