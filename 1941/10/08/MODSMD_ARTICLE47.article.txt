\*T A 7HAT does the campus think, or does it?"
V V should have been the title of this little
epistle, but it wouldn't fit.
The Daily has taken an aggressive stand
against the isolationists, because that is the
way we feel. With one short exception, how
ever, that seems to be the way the whole cam
pus, if it is thinking at all, feels since there has
been practically no condemnation of this stand.
We do not want to become completely one
sided on this matter, particularly since this is
American Newspaper Week and the virtues of
a free press with voice for the minority have
been extolled throughout the country.
The following is an invitation to anyone on
the campus, student or professor: We will print
in the editorial column of The Daily the best
off-staff contribution defending the viewpoint
of the isolationists. Requirements are moderate
length and the normal restrictions on matter for
public print.
The condition of present-day society is a
challenge to all Stanford men and women
to exert themselves to the utmost to provide
the enlightened leadership that present-day
society so sorely needs.—Charles A. Beards
