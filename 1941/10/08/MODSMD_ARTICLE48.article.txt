THE BEARS LOSE JURK
J READ in the paper yesterday that Jim Jurkovich,
the brilliant University of California halfback, was
out of football for good. The decision was finally
reached after the Washington State game, in which
Jurkovich took a blow on the chin, and went out again.
Thorough examinations of his head by a host of
medical experts have not revealed the reasons for
these frequent knockouts, but »n the contrary have
shown that Jurk is perfectly normal. But normal or
not, the coaching staff and doctors at California didn't
want him to take any chances and urged him to quit
the game. Knowing what power Jurk gave to the Cali
fornia team, the action of the officials is highly com
mendable.
* * * *
TURKOVICH started his football, career at Fresno
' High, where as a sophomore he worked at right
?nd, trading off with George Kaufman, the Firehouse
;tar. He was fast, aggressive, vicious, and gave all the
indications of being a star. The next year he was
noved to the tailback spot, to fill in for the graduated
Jimmy Johnson who went to Santa Clara. At tailback,
he was a natural. His terrific speed, his jolting straight
arms, his kicking and passing, made him the most
feared high school back in the valley. But just about
this time he began to get knocked out. He used to
make a long, beautiful run, and then after he was
tackled he would lie groveling on the turf. He was
continually being taken out of the games, worked over
and then sent back in.
One night after a game, I went down to the dress
ing room to see him. I told him that he had played
wonderfully, and started to ask him questions about
certain plays. He was a complete blank. He didn't
remember the action of whole quarters. His body,
legs ,and arms functioned perfectly, but his mind didn't
follow. 'Many were the quarters that he played in a
daze.
But he always recovered, he always felt in per
fect shape, and he was always eager to get back in
:he game.
* * * *
J SUPPOSE that about the same thing has been hap
pening at California. The same old knockouts, the
dizzy spells, the playing without remembering. But
the California officials have decided to make him quit
football, and they act wisely, for he is a good boy
and nothing in football is worth a permanent injury.
There is no doubt in my mind that Jurk would
have become one of the finest backs ever developed on
the Coast. In the short time that he did play varsity
ball, he displayed all the potentialities. In the first
game of this season against St. Mary's, he piled up
more than 100 yards from scrimmage in one quarter
of play. It's too bad, but it is more important to have
his head, and carry on with his engineering studies.
For athletics he can go out for track. He is a sprinter
who has done 9.8, has broad-jumped almost 25 feet,
and throws the discus 145 feet. That is enough for
anybody.

legs ,and arms functioned perfectly, but his mind didn't
follow. 'Many were the quarters that he played in a

J SUPPOSE that about the same thing has been hap
pening at California. The same old knockouts, the
dizzy spells, the playing without remembering. But
the California officials have decided to make him quit
football, and they act wisely, for he is a good boy
and nothing in football is worth a permanent injury.
There is no doubt in my mind that Jurk would
have become one of the finest backs ever developed on
the Coast. In the short time that he did play varsity
ball, he displayed all the potentialities. In the first
game of this season against St. Mary's, he piled up
more than 100 yards from scrimmage in one quarter
of play. It's too bad, but it is more important to have
his head, and carry on with his engineering studies.
For athletics he can go out for track. He is a sprinter
who has done 9.8, has broad-jumped almost 25 feet,
and throws the discus 145 feet. That is enough for
anybody.
THE BEARS LOSE JURK
J READ in the paper yesterday that Jim Jurkovich,
the brilliant University of California halfback, was
out of football for good. The decision was finally
reached after the Washington State game, in which
Jurkovich took a blow on the chin, and went out again.
Thorough examinations of his head by a host of
medical experts have not revealed the reasons for
these frequent knockouts, but »n the contrary have
shown that Jurk is perfectly normal. But normal or
not, the coaching staff and doctors at California didn't
want him to take any chances and urged him to quit
the game. Knowing what power Jurk gave to the Cali
fornia team, the action of the officials is highly com
mendable.
* * * *
TURKOVICH started his football, career at Fresno
' High, where as a sophomore he worked at right
?nd, trading off with George Kaufman, the Firehouse
;tar. He was fast, aggressive, vicious, and gave all the
indications of being a star. The next year he was
noved to the tailback spot, to fill in for the graduated
Jimmy Johnson who went to Santa Clara. At tailback,
he was a natural. His terrific speed, his jolting straight
arms, his kicking and passing, made him the most
feared high school back in the valley. But just about
this time he began to get knocked out. He used to
make a long, beautiful run, and then after he was
tackled he would lie groveling on the turf. He was
continually being taken out of the games, worked over
and then sent back in.
One night after a game, I went down to the dress
ing room to see him. I told him that he had played
wonderfully, and started to ask him questions about
certain plays. He was a complete blank. He didn't
remember the action of whole quarters. His body,
legs ,and arms functioned perfectly, but his mind didn't
follow. 'Many were the quarters that he played in a
