# DAREDEVIL RESCUED FROM "ISLAND"
## 
### 

THIS 857-FOOT granite monolith in Wyoming became an "island in the sky" for Daredevil George Hop
kins, shown with parachute that landed him on it in foolhardy $50 bet. After he got there, it took a rescue
party to get him down. He's a former flier with RAF.
