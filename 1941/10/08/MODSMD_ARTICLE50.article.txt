# Column Film Follows Dull, Drab Pattern
## 
### 
"MY LIFE WITH CAROLINE,"
starring Ronald Colman, Charles
Winninger, and a newcomer, Anna
Lee.
Intellectual escape seems to be the
goal of the newest "smart" comedy,
"My Life with Caroline." Intellec
tual aggravation seems to. be the re
sult. A more loosely woven tale has
never been presented to picture
going audiences.
Ronald Colman, whom we pre
fer to remember in such roles as
"The Tale of Two Cities," was duped
into starring in this Ladies Home
Companion story about a husband
who is being continually confronted
by a scatter-brained, thrill-seeking
wife. The movie tries to be a little
bit different by having the husband
fight the home-breaker in his own
element — dinners on the terrace,
windy sails, etc., etc.
HUSBAND NOBLE
However, the husband finally turns
out to be the noble character that he
is, which fools nobody.
"If I thought that my wife was in
love with another man I wouldn't do
a thing to stop her."
This little speech seems to be the
earmark of all the modern comedies
that have appeared out of filmland
in the last five years. Shades of
"The Thin Man!"
Single feature of the film must be
the settings which set a new high
for bar-room decoration. The Mag
nates must have gathered together all
the store decorators on Wilshire
Blvd. for this little extravanganza.
Piece-de-resistance is the staircase
covered with lamb's wool. This will
undoubtedly thrill the residents of
Stanford's living groups accustomed
to the dull brown linoleum.
Furry staircases is the only change
that the picture offers. Even the
ending is stock. This time the win
ning husband drops a sculptured
head of wife, done by the third
party, into the lake.
ENDING STOCK
The least of the evils in the picture
is Charles Winninger as the father
of the trouble-making female. You
are not supposed to like him very
much though, because he is too
easy-going.
Anna Lee seems to be a strange
combination—the mind of Marie
Wilson and the body of Lana Turner.
The second bill is an Ellery Queen
mystery with Ralph Bellamy as the
mastermind and Margaret Lindsay as
Nikki Porter. The explanation of
the whole crime by the great Queen
makes it nice to get in at the end
and leave before the begining.
Third feature is Mr. Norman Sper
who predicts that Obenshain's Fire
| house squad will win the intramural
j pennant.—Mull
