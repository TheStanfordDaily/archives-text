SEATTLE, Oct. 7 (UP). — Presi
dent Roscvelt called for an end to
| work stoppages in defense industries
and, in a strongly worded message to
the f» Ist annual convention of Ihe
American Federation of Labor to
day, the President said "the amount
necessary to overwhelm the Nazi
hordes" is the nation's only limit to
: all-out production.
"This is not the time to take
I chances with the national safety
I through any stoppage of defense
! work or defense production," Mr.
Roosevelt said.
"Our program of defense — our
production of ships, planes, guns,
tanks—must be all-out. It shall be
limited by only one factor — the
amount necessary to overwhelm the
| Nazi hordes."
GREEN APPROVES
The President's message found
general acceptance among AFL
leaders, including President William
Green, who had pledged his organi
zation to follow the chief executive
to "the bitter end" if it became nec
essary to take "more decisive action
to protect the freedom of the seas
and democracy throughout the
world."
Responsible sources believed the
message's immediate effect on AFL
I policies would be a strengthened
I stand against defense strikes.
WORKERS SYMBOLIC
Following the President's message,
! however, some delegates were be
! lieved to favor stronger action to
| prevent such walkouts. They said
i this might be effected by a resolu
tion directing the federation's in
ternational unions to assume greater
executive authority in dealing with
work stoppages in defense indus-
I tries.
