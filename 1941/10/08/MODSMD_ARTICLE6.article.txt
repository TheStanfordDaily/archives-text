## 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
With the presentation of the El
Camino Quartet in the Memorial
Auditorium at 7:30 last night, the
Tuesday Evening Series, sponsored
by the Stanford Committee on Pub
lic Exercises, began its 1941-42
series.
From their repertoire, the string
ensemble, noted in Bay area musical
circles, selected for the evening's
program the "Quartet in B Flat
Major" by Mozart and Dvorak's
"Quintet in A Major."
Elizabeth Peirce as first violinist,
Marilyn Doty, second violin, Marian
Nicholson, viola, and Norma Letroa
dec Hill, 'cello, completed the group.
The clear, high strains and har
monizing tones of the violins, the
softer, more mellow music of the
viola and the deep resonance of the
'cello blended together in varying
rhythms to present the first Series
audience with an outstanding eve
ning of excellent chamber music.
In the Dvorak selection, the quar
tet was assisted by Jorgen Nielsen at
the piano. Both this and Mozart's
"Quartet" were distinguished by
their slowness, though especially in
the latter there were several in
stances of sharply contrasting stac
cato movements.
Many in the audience remembered
hearing the quartet before when it
appeared several times for the Tues
day programs. The group has been
playing a series of concerts at Hid
den Villa in Los Altos for four years.
