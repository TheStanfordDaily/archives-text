# First Singstunde Meets Tomorrow
## 
### 
Under the sponsorship of the Ger
man department, the first Singstunde
of fall quarter will be held tomorrow
afternoon at 4:30 p.m. The public is
invited to attend the meeting,
which will be held at the campus
home of Professor B. Q. Morgan, 730
Santa Maria Avenue, instead of
Hawthorne Cottage as last year.
It is to the cultivation of the Ger
man folksong that the Stanford
German department devotes its bi
monthly Singstunde. In inviting
everyone to attend, Professor Mor
gan declared that one of the finest
gifts of the German people to the
world is their music, and one of the
most beloved of their musical prod
ucts is the folk song.
Because Professor Morgan's home
is on the far side of the campus,
transportation will be provided for
those who desire it. Cars will leave
from the Engineering Corner at
4:15. Those who wish transporta
tion or who can provide it for others
are asked to notify the office of the
German department not later than
the forenoon of the Singstunde.
