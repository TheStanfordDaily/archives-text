# Work of Research Institute Shown in inner Quad Exhibit

### BARBARA BADGER 
Food ration cards are little pieces of colored paper, but to the hungry
people of Europe, they mean the difference between life and starvation.
What do these little cards look like? Well, they are on display at the Food
Research Institute on the Inner Quad.
The rest of the exhibit is made up of interesting periodicals and charts

which help the members of the In- +
stitute to carry on their work of
compiling figures and facts concern
ing food consumption the world
over.
IN SPITE OF WAR
The exhibit, originally a part of
the Fiftieth Anniversary celebration,
shows further how the Institute's
work carries on despite the crip
pling effect of the war on its infor
mation sources. An explanation
above one of the periodical displays
recounts that more than 100 foreign
periodicals are received by the de
partment from 22 countries, though j
the foreign service has been reduced i
by more than one-third since the
outbreak of war.
These periodicals are now re
placed by clippings from foreign
newspapers.
One display shows the results of a
20 years' study of the normal litiga
tion of wheat in foreign countries,
which enables the Institute to throw
some light on the present food situa
tion abroad. Regional studies have
been made in this field as well, and j
the exhibit includes a publication of j
the German Fat Plan, without
which it has been said Germany j
could not have gone to war.
INSTITUTE'S WORK
Another exhibit shows the actual
example of the concrete work which
the Food Research Institute has
done. Seventeen volumes of wheat
publications, which one member of
the department said might be titled,
"Blood, Sweat, and Tears." Included
with these large volumes are books
published elsewhere by members of |
the Institute.
As* another part of the exhibit
which shows how these comprehen
sive volumes are put. together after

years of research, is a display of the
galley proofs of three new books in
the process of publication. The Rice
Economy of Monsoon Asia by V. D.
Wickizer and M. K. Bennett is one
of these which has incorporated in
formation from the foreign publica
tions plus many other sources into a
scientific work.
RATION CARDS
Food ration cards, which people
in war-torn countries must have in
order to buy such commodities as
milk, shoes, soap, and clothing,
make up the final display table. The
type shown are from Switzerland
and Finland. They are cancelled,
however, so it wouldn't do any good
to send them to your friends abroad.
The exhibits will be left intact for
a few days longer, before they all go
back into the files of the Food Re
search Institute.

people of Europe, they mean the difference between life and starvation.
What do these little cards look like? Well, they are on display at the Food
Research Institute on the Inner Quad.
The rest of the exhibit is made up of interesting periodicals and charts

which help the members of the In- +
stitute to carry on their work of
compiling figures and facts concern
ing food consumption the world
over.
IN SPITE OF WAR
The exhibit, originally a part of
the Fiftieth Anniversary celebration,
shows further how the Institute's
work carries on despite the crip
pling effect of the war on its infor
mation sources. An explanation
above one of the periodical displays
recounts that more than 100 foreign
periodicals are received by the de
partment from 22 countries, though j
the foreign service has been reduced i
by more than one-third since the
outbreak of war.
These periodicals are now re
placed by clippings from foreign
newspapers.
One display shows the results of a
20 years' study of the normal litiga
tion of wheat in foreign countries,
which enables the Institute to throw
some light on the present food situa
tion abroad. Regional studies have
been made in this field as well, and j
the exhibit includes a publication of j
the German Fat Plan, without
which it has been said Germany j
could not have gone to war.
INSTITUTE'S WORK
Another exhibit shows the actual
example of the concrete work which
the Food Research Institute has
done. Seventeen volumes of wheat
publications, which one member of
the department said might be titled,
"Blood, Sweat, and Tears." Included
with these large volumes are books
published elsewhere by members of |
the Institute.
As* another part of the exhibit
which shows how these comprehen
sive volumes are put. together after

years of research, is a display of the
galley proofs of three new books in
the process of publication. The Rice
Economy of Monsoon Asia by V. D.
Wickizer and M. K. Bennett is one
of these which has incorporated in
formation from the foreign publica
tions plus many other sources into a
scientific work.
RATION CARDS
Food ration cards, which people
in war-torn countries must have in
order to buy such commodities as
milk, shoes, soap, and clothing,
make up the final display table. The
type shown are from Switzerland
and Finland. They are cancelled,
however, so it wouldn't do any good
to send them to your friends abroad.
The exhibits will be left intact for
a few days longer, before they all go
back into the files of the Food Re
search Institute.
Food ration cards are little pieces of colored paper, but to the hungry
people of Europe, they mean the difference between life and starvation.
What do these little cards look like? Well, they are on display at the Food
Research Institute on the Inner Quad.
