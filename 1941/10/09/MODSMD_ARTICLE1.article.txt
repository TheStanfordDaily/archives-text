### AMIE REICHERT 
' jj 'HE news from Europe this morn
ing is sobering. Germany ap
parently has the ball safely tucked
under her arm and is running hell
bent for election.
From three different directions the
Nazis are ploughing ahead, and the j
Russians seem to be falling back
rapidly after resisting fitfully.
German military spokesmen
boasted that the Nazi front—"not :
advance units but the front—now
is about 125 miles from Moscow,
and spearheads are pushing
closer."
If true, this is breath-taking. Yes
terday's reports had the invaders |
some 230 miles from the Red capi- j
tal. If the Nazis can make 95 miles j
in one day, there are two possible j
explanations: Russian resistance is j
withering, or the Red Army is re- j
treating to dig in around Moscow j
for a long, bitter siege.

r J|MIE latter explanation is not
simply hopeful rationalization,
even though it is somewhat surpris
ing that the Reds are retreating this
early in the new offensive. The de
fense of Moscow rests on the com
petent shoulders of Russia's ablest
general, Marshal Semyon Timo
shenko.
His army is the only one the
Russians possess which is still
completely intact. Voroshilov's in
the North and Budcnny's in the
South have faced the relentless
hammering of the panzers and the
stukas for three months now.
Berlin claims that the defenders
of Leningrad and Odessa have been
annihilated, and that in the south
ern Ukraine 100,000 trapped Rus
sians are waiting to be destroyed.
These claims are a little steep to
he sure. But there seems little
doubt that the picture lias changed
radically in the last 48 hours, and
the Germans are making swift and
deadly progress.
In view of the immensity of these
alleged losses on all fronts, it would
not be entirely inconceivable then
that Timoshenko and his central
army are conducting -a strategic re
treat.

I\l OST ominous aspect of the new
successes is the fact that all
High Command reports name specif
ically the areas of greatest fighting.
These reports coincide for the most
part with the dispatches from Mos
cow and London.
The situation is extremely se
rious around Vyazma, Bryansk,
and Orel. Look at Vyazma on the
map. It's less than an inch away j
from Moscow on ours.
In the South, the German High
Command reports that their troops
have crashed through as far as
Mariupol, only 100 miles from Ros
tov. This is smack on the Soviet's
most vital Caucasian pipe line.
The Russians have made no at
tempt to conceal the gravity of the
situation. It was reported that they
made new proposals to the British
to strike decisively at the Axis in
the West.

FLEET, Russian naval or
gan, said that Hitler has concen
trated more than three million men,
the bulk of his fleet, and virtually
the entire German air force for this
last crushing blow at Russia. Only
25 to 30 weak Nazi divisions are
now left to defend France, it said.
All the answers arc there except
the big one: How? The British
have said over and over that they
simply don't have the equipment
and the time isn't ripe to launch
any sort of Continental invasion
this year. The best they can offer
their Russian allies is materiel.
But it seems a little late for that
sort of thing. No amount of tanks
and planes and guns will make half
the dent in the Nazi armor that a
full-sized invasion from the rear
would mean.
The British don't want to risk
another Dunkirk — they lost all
their heavy equipment at the first
one. Unless they feel that they can
invade, and invade successfully,
they will only continue to prom
ise supplies to the Soviet.
When the panzers keep rolling
along at 100 miles a day, this sort
of talk is small talk.
