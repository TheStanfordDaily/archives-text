# Sorority Transfers to Meet Sisters Under Pan-Hell Ruling
## 
### KAY SCHWARTZ 
Stanford hospitality is a byword in collegiate circles all over the country.
The "hello" tradition, the preregistration entertainment for freshmen
and transfers, are part of the University's policy to familiarize all new
students with life on the Farm. However, in past years girls who belonged
to sororities on other campuses and transferred to Stanford, generally re-

mained unknown to Row women i
and Pan Hellenic Council.
SITUATION REMEDIED
To remedy this situation, the
Council, under the leadership of
Barbara Rapp, has devised a plan.
For three days this week, Oct. 8, 9,
and 10, all transfers who are mem
bers of national sororities on other
campuses are being asked to register
their affiliations in the office of the
Dean of Women. This applies to
members of any national sorority
whether there is a chapter at Stan
ford or not.
Occasionally transfers stated their
sorority affiliations on their applica
tion blanks, but for the most part no
one knew about them and not too
many people cared. According to
Pan-Hell, if a sorority was not noti
fied by its other chapters of the ar
rival of a member, the girl probably
never saw the inside of her house
nor had any social contacts with its
members.
GIRLS INFLUENCED
In the opinion of some sorority
women, this has influenced many
Greek-letter girls against transfer
ring to this campus.
Row women and Pan-Hell are
confident that this plan will put an
end to all controversy on the mat
ter.
