# 'AMERICA ALREADY IN WAR'
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
We are already in the war and
i have been in it for many months,
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder, executive
head of the geology department, dc- j
clared in an interview yesterday.
"Yet many people in America are
still angrily debating how to 'keep
out of war.' There is» no way to
keep out of it, or even to get out of
it," Dr. Blackwelder emphasized,j
"except to go forward in concert
I with the other nations fighting the
j Axis powers, until the enemy is de
| feated."
Dr. Blackwelder asked not to be
i represented as a political science
i authority. He said his views are
! those of a scientist and a citizen.

"As a scientist, however, I realize
the importance of knowing the real
nature of that which we argue," the
well known geologist explained. "I
have noted many disagreements
hinged on what war is today.
"And that's why I say we are
already in the war," Dr. Blackwelder
asserted. "But let me prove my
case."
From his desk, he brought out
two dictionaries, a volume of the
Columbia Encyclopedia, and some
notes.
In these, he said, war is variously
defined.
WAR DEFINED
From the encyclopedia he read,
"WAR —An armed conflict between
I sovereign states . . . having as a pur
l pose the imposition of certain con- [
j ditions upon the opposing power j
after securing its defeat." Then,
j authorities on international affairs i
! say a conflict is not war until it has |
been declared, making it a legal
j war, he added. I

But, ho argued, neither of these
definitions seem broad enough to
suit conditions in the world of to
day.
"From a legalistic viewpoint it may
be advisable to limit the term 'war'
to a state of open or declared armed
conflict," Dr. Blackwelder explained.
"But war in this restricted sense is
only a part of one comprehensive
process."
If the whole operation is not war,
then we need another word for it,
he continued. It would seem better
for,-us to recognize that it is all one
growth and that military war is only
the evil flower that blooms upon it,
he added.
"From the viewpoint of the de
feated nation, war as practiced today

*-by the Nazi regime proceeds by
seven steps," he asserted. "In point
of time most of the steps overlap or
even coincide," he said, citing the
seven points as follows:
SEVEN POINTS
1. Weakening and destruction of
the nation's unity, by promoting
doubt, fear, confusion, dissension,
and class bitterness.
2. Economic attack, by sabotage,
■ ruining markets, diverting trade,
i and especially by forcing huge ex
penditures for national defense.
3. Separation of the nation from
its actual or potential allies.
4. Promotion of internal revolu
tion, through espionage and in
trigue.
5. Secret preparation, by enemy
agents, for the seizure of vital points
and communication facilities ahead
of recognized invasion.
6. Open military attack—usually
without a declaration of war in ad
vance.
7. Enslavement of the defeated
population and subversion of their
national life, ending in the forma
tion of a caste-supported despotism.
PHASES—WAR
"Each of these phases is quite as
much a part of such a war as the
sixth," Dr. Blackwelder emphasized.
"In the United States today we
have long been subjected to action
No. 1 and for a year or more to
Nos. 2 and 3.
"How far the enemies have al
ready proceeded with Nos. 4 and 5
we do not know, but there is evi-
I denee that they are busy at both,"
he said.
It must be clear, Dr. Blackwelder
j concluded, that, in the larger sense,
i we are already in the war and have
I been in it for months.

"Each of these phases is quite as

sixth," Dr. Blackwelder emphasized.
"In the United States today we
have long been subjected to action
No. 1 and for a year or more to
Nos. 2 and 3.
"How far the enemies have al

we do not know, but there is evi-
I denee that they are busy at both,"

"We are in the war . .
We are already in the war and
i have been in it for many months,
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder, executive
head of the geology department, dc- j
clared in an interview yesterday.
"Yet many people in America are
still angrily debating how to 'keep
out of war.' There is» no way to
keep out of it, or even to get out of
it," Dr. Blackwelder emphasized,j
"except to go forward in concert
I with the other nations fighting the
j Axis powers, until the enemy is de
| feated."
Dr. Blackwelder asked not to be
i represented as a political science
i authority. He said his views are
! those of a scientist and a citizen.

"As a scientist, however, I realize
the importance of knowing the real
nature of that which we argue," the
well known geologist explained. "I
have noted many disagreements
hinged on what war is today.
"And that's why I say we are
already in the war," Dr. Blackwelder
asserted. "But let me prove my
case."
From his desk, he brought out
two dictionaries, a volume of the
Columbia Encyclopedia, and some
notes.
In these, he said, war is variously
defined.
WAR DEFINED
From the encyclopedia he read,
"WAR —An armed conflict between
I sovereign states . . . having as a pur
l pose the imposition of certain con- [
j ditions upon the opposing power j
after securing its defeat." Then,
j authorities on international affairs i
! say a conflict is not war until it has |
been declared, making it a legal
j war, he added. I

But, ho argued, neither of these
definitions seem broad enough to
suit conditions in the world of to
day.
"From a legalistic viewpoint it may
be advisable to limit the term 'war'
to a state of open or declared armed
conflict," Dr. Blackwelder explained.
"But war in this restricted sense is
only a part of one comprehensive
process."
If the whole operation is not war,
then we need another word for it,
he continued. It would seem better
for,-us to recognize that it is all one
growth and that military war is only
the evil flower that blooms upon it,
he added.
"From the viewpoint of the de
feated nation, war as practiced today

*-by the Nazi regime proceeds by
seven steps," he asserted. "In point
of time most of the steps overlap or
even coincide," he said, citing the
seven points as follows:
SEVEN POINTS
1. Weakening and destruction of
the nation's unity, by promoting
doubt, fear, confusion, dissension,
and class bitterness.
2. Economic attack, by sabotage,
■ ruining markets, diverting trade,
i and especially by forcing huge ex
penditures for national defense.
3. Separation of the nation from
its actual or potential allies.
4. Promotion of internal revolu
tion, through espionage and in

"From a legalistic viewpoint it may
be advisable to limit the term 'war'
to a state of open or declared armed
conflict," Dr. Blackwelder explained.
"But war in this restricted sense is
only a part of one comprehensive
process."
If the whole operation is not war,
then we need another word for it,
he continued. It would seem better
for,-us to recognize that it is all one
growth and that military war is only
the evil flower that blooms upon it,
he added.
"From the viewpoint of the de
feated nation, war as practiced today

*-by the Nazi regime proceeds by
seven steps," he asserted. "In point
of time most of the steps overlap or
even coincide," he said, citing the
seven points as follows:
SEVEN POINTS
1. Weakening and destruction of
the nation's unity, by promoting
doubt, fear, confusion, dissension,
and class bitterness.
2. Economic attack, by sabotage,
■ ruining markets, diverting trade,
i and especially by forcing huge ex
penditures for national defense.
3. Separation of the nation from
its actual or potential allies.
4. Promotion of internal revolu
tion, through espionage and in
trigue.
5. Secret preparation, by enemy
agents, for the seizure of vital points
and communication facilities ahead
of recognized invasion.
6. Open military attack—usually
without a declaration of war in ad
vance.
7. Enslavement of the defeated
population and subversion of their
national life, ending in the forma
tion of a caste-supported despotism.
PHASES—WAR
"Each of these phases is quite as
much a part of such a war as the
sixth," Dr. Blackwelder emphasized.
"In the United States today we
have long been subjected to action
No. 1 and for a year or more to
Nos. 2 and 3.
"How far the enemies have al
ready proceeded with Nos. 4 and 5
we do not know, but there is evi-
I denee that they are busy at both,"
he said.
It must be clear, Dr. Blackwelder
j concluded, that, in the larger sense,
i we are already in the war and have
I been in it for months.

"We are in the war . .
We are already in the war and
i have been in it for many months,
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder, executive
head of the geology department, dc- j
clared in an interview yesterday.
"Yet many people in America are
still angrily debating how to 'keep
out of war.' There is» no way to
keep out of it, or even to get out of
it," Dr. Blackwelder emphasized,j
"except to go forward in concert
I with the other nations fighting the
j Axis powers, until the enemy is de
| feated."
Dr. Blackwelder asked not to be
i represented as a political science
i authority. He said his views are
! those of a scientist and a citizen.
R E A LIZES I IMPORT A N CE
"As a scientist, however, I realize
the importance of knowing the real
nature of that which we argue," the
well known geologist explained. "I
have noted many disagreements
hinged on what war is today.
"And that's why I say we are
already in the war," Dr. Blackwelder
asserted. "But let me prove my
case."
From his desk, he brought out
two dictionaries, a volume of the
Columbia Encyclopedia, and some
notes.
In these, he said, war is variously
defined.
WAR DEFINED
From the encyclopedia he read,
"WAR —An armed conflict between
I sovereign states . . . having as a pur
l pose the imposition of certain con- [
j ditions upon the opposing power j
after securing its defeat." Then,
j authorities on international affairs i
! say a conflict is not war until it has |
been declared, making it a legal
j war, he added. I

But, ho argued, neither of these
definitions seem broad enough to
suit conditions in the world of to
day.
"From a legalistic viewpoint it may
be advisable to limit the term 'war'
to a state of open or declared armed
conflict," Dr. Blackwelder explained.
