CLOSE RACE
All indications point to a close
race, particularly in the Men's
Council election, where the old ri
valry between Hall and Row is re
vived. Students will be required to
present their student body cards at
the polls, which will be stationed in
the usual places on the Quad.
Only men may vote in the Men's
Council contest; the B.A.C. election
is open to all students.
