# Germans Claim Arrival At Yyazama, 125 Miles From Russian Capital
## Stalinists Fall Before Strong Pincer Thrusts 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 8 (Ul»).—Jubilant
Nazi spokesmen said tonight that the
German front now was but 125 miles
from Moscow, and that the lied
armies of Marshal Semyon Timo
shenko—"the last army group avail
able to Stalin"—were encircled and
bing swiftly exterminated.
They said the huge battles of an
nihilation were centered west of
Vyazma.
A sunburst of jubilant claims in
dicated that a decision might bo
expected soon at Vyazma, after
which the German forces that
cracked through the Soviet defenses
at that point would be free to storm
toward Moscow in the wake of
spearheads already thrusting east
ward.
NAZIS CONFIDENT
Military spokesmen luxuriated in
the most emphatic and confident
comment of the war with Russia.
They said panzer columns were
streaking through the Ukraine vir
tually unimpeded by Marshal Sem
yon Budenny's "completely routed"
armies and Marshal Klementi E.
Voroshilov's northern armies had
bled to impotence.
From Moscow, a Soviet communi
que admitted that the German war
tide had surged forward another
80 miles on the central front to
overrun Orel, 210 miles south of
Moscow, which apparently is being
enclosed in a gigantic pincers move
ment.
GERMANS CAPTURE OREL
The communique .said that Rus
sian troops had abandoned Orel, 80
miles east of Bryansk, where the
Russians had placed the battle line
yesterday. Orel is on the main rail
way line south from Moscow
through Kharkov to the Crimea.
The Germans had advanced 150
miles from Roslavl, the reported
starting point of their main offensive
against Moscow. Instead of striking
directly northeast toward the capi
tal, however, they were driving
southeast. Their 150-mile gain had
taken them only 1.0 miles nearer
Moscow but they were now in po
sition to turn northeast and come
upon the city from the rear.
CHIPS ARE DOWN'
Meanwhile, British observers in
London admited the chips were down
in the tattle before Moscow. A de
cision pftobably will come within two
weeks, they said, and the fate of the
Soviet capital depends on Marshal
Semyon Timoshcnko's defense prep
arations.
It will be a battle of men and ma
chines throughout. Only a rolling,
wooded terrain stands between the
Germans and the prized city. Mos
cow's one natural defense was dis
tance, and the Germans are now less
than 150 miles away. Unlike Lenin
grad, Odessa and Kiev, which have
natural water defense, Moscow
stands exposed both to the brutal
winter and the invading armies that
are racing toward it.
It is too late to build any more
substantial bulwarks against the
Germans on thai front. There is a
considerabl opinion here, however,
that Timoshenko may have a sur
l prise in store for the Nazis.

in the tattle before Moscow. A de

It will be a battle of men and ma

wooded terrain stands between the
Germans and the prized city. Mos
cow's one natural defense was dis

natural water defense, Moscow
stands exposed both to the brutal
winter and the invading armies that

BERLIN, Oct. 8 (Ul»).—Jubilant
Nazi spokesmen said tonight that the
German front now was but 125 miles
from Moscow, and that the lied
armies of Marshal Semyon Timo
shenko—"the last army group avail
able to Stalin"—were encircled and
bing swiftly exterminated.
They said the huge battles of an
nihilation were centered west of
Vyazma.
A sunburst of jubilant claims in
dicated that a decision might bo
expected soon at Vyazma, after
which the German forces that
cracked through the Soviet defenses
at that point would be free to storm
toward Moscow in the wake of
spearheads already thrusting east
ward.
NAZIS CONFIDENT
Military spokesmen luxuriated in
the most emphatic and confident
comment of the war with Russia.
They said panzer columns were
streaking through the Ukraine vir
tually unimpeded by Marshal Sem
yon Budenny's "completely routed"
armies and Marshal Klementi E.
Voroshilov's northern armies had
bled to impotence.
From Moscow, a Soviet communi
que admitted that the German war
tide had surged forward another
80 miles on the central front to
overrun Orel, 210 miles south of
Moscow, which apparently is being
enclosed in a gigantic pincers move
ment.
GERMANS CAPTURE OREL
The communique .said that Rus
sian troops had abandoned Orel, 80
miles east of Bryansk, where the
Russians had placed the battle line
yesterday. Orel is on the main rail
way line south from Moscow
through Kharkov to the Crimea.
The Germans had advanced 150
miles from Roslavl, the reported
starting point of their main offensive
against Moscow. Instead of striking
directly northeast toward the capi
tal, however, they were driving
southeast. Their 150-mile gain had
taken them only 1.0 miles nearer
Moscow but they were now in po
sition to turn northeast and come
upon the city from the rear.
