Forty-one girls under the direc

Women's Clubhouse to receive di
rections before going out to make
contacts for the Y.W.C.A. member
ship drive. The drive, which began
yesterday afternoon, will continue

but with the new "Y" policy, dues
will be $1 and will have to be re

however, may participate in any of
the organization activities.

dents. Friendship, fun and activities
to suit each girl are offered.
This year's drive is being con
ducted in a different manner than
usual, in that the representatives
will seek new members from only
their own living groups.
