# No, It's Not Fifth Column In the Cellar

### MIKE KRESGE 
"Wie geht's, Herr Professor. Es
tut mir leid, das Ich mieh verspatet
habe."
Upon hearing this, troglodytes
(cave or cellar inhabitants) probably
think that there's nothing - less than
a fifth column invasion being plot
ted. To those uttering this guttural
babble it merely signifies that an
other session of German 852 is un
derway and some student is apolo
gizing for being late.
UNIQUE COURSE
German 852 is a conversation
course which has some unique as
pects. Taught by Mr. Donald Mc-
Kenzie. the class meets on Tuesday
and Thursday at 7:30 and 4:30. re
spectively, in the big corner booth
in tho Cellar. For an hour, amid the
din of the juke box, the class drinks
cokes, coffee, etc. (no. not beer) and
discusses current affairs and other
matters in German.
The course is given for one unit
of credit, no examinations are taken
and the grade given is either' a plus
or minus. The prerequisite is Ger
man 851, although if a student
knows enough German he may take
852.
RECORDS MADE
One of the newer approaches in
the course this year is the making
of phonograph records by the indi
vidual student. Sometimes the class
convenes at the home of Mr. Mc-
Kenzie. who has a home recording
machine.
By means of this device the stu
dents may speak German, read po
etry, or even sing, if he feels so in
clined. Then he has his record
played back to him and, in this man
ner, can hear his own conversation
and so can correct various pronun
ciation faults.
