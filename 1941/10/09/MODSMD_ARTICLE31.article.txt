# Asher Says "Bring In All Farm Stars'

### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Emerging from the smoke-filled
air raid shelter that serves as the
clubroom for Ramshead, Asher B.
Wilson, director of this year's star
studded Gaieties, said between in
haling great gusts of fresh air,
"Don't expect too much of (his year's
show. Priorities, you know."
With this sage comment on the
state of things he ducked back into
the melee inside the room. Two
pianos were trying to keep up with
one another on some of the tunes
that have been submitted as pos
sible Gaieties stuff. "You might
mention that the deadline for songs
is Oct. 13. It isn't Friday the 13th,
but only Monday the 13th. so don't
be hesitant about bringing them
around."
PERENNIAL TUG
With a sigh Wilson sat down at
| the long table, groaning under its
load of coke bottles and ash trays.
"You know," he said, "in the old
days, each living group submitted
some sort of a script or skit to be
tried out. Now the only thing we
get is the Kappa Alpha bathtub.
"The sooner the scripts are sub
mitted, the better chance they have
of getting our attention. And you
know us (with a wide sweep of his
j hand that laid low his two assist
j ants, Johnnie Lawry and A. Nor
j man Ross, he included every busy
i little person in the room). We are
I at your service" (this with a courtly
i bow).
"But to get on with things. The
; theme of the show has not been defi
! nitely decided upon. There will be
; marvelous songs, a spectacular
j rhumba (for Pan-Americanism) and
j a lavish, big production number,
i And lots of good looking women* —if
J they turn out."
PHANTASY NUMBER
j Wilson went on to say that one of
i the numbers will be a phantasy, all
I about a little boy and girl. "And
; that's about it. It's mostly phantasy
right now."
"Really though, we want every
| one who has a song, a dance or a
| joke to come over and tell us about
it. And if you can't do that there is
always the stage crew. And lots of
j beautiful women—if they turn out.
I So come, come, come!"
