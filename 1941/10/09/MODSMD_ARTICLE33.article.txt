PLAYED IN IRELAND
"The Far Off Hills" was first played
in the Abbey Theater in Dublin. It
! gained popularity in this country
I when the Abbey Players toured
America in 1932, and it proved the
first comedy success of their 1937
season with a run of 47 perform-
I ances.
The characters are typical Irish of

j main appeal is their naturalness.

i has designed sets to create a homey
atmosphere fitting the characters of
| the play.
