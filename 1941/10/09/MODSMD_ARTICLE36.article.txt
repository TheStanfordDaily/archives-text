### 
Figures released by the Board of
Athlc tic Control yesterday show that
the rooting sections at this year's
S.C. and Big Games will be two of
the biggest in Stanford's history.
Over 3000 rooters' tickets were
sold for the Big Game, and Stan
ford's quota of 1500 rooters' admis
sions for the S,C. game was entirely
sold out, according to Miss Eunice
DePrau, in charge of ticket sales.
The sale of general public tickets to
students was also unusually large
for both games, she said.

Hammer and Coffin Society, a na
tional humor magazine society orig
inated at Stanford.
