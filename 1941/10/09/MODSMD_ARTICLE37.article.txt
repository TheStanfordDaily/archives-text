### DON SELBY 
TF THERE is anything Coach Clark
Shaughnessy doesn't take intc
consideration when he prepares hit
team for a game, we certainly don'l
know about it.
In much the same manner as he
got his charges ready for their trek
to Pullman last fall for the Wash
ington State game, Shaughnessy hat
bo en taking into account all even
tualities as he runs his squad
through its stud in preparation foi
the battle with the surprising Ore
gon State Beavers at Corval'is this
Saturday.
It's not raining down here, hut
it might he up there. So the wily
Scotch-Irish mentor lias had the
foothall managers dunking the
oval in a bucket of water between
plays in order that the gridders
will get used to handling the wet
pill. The Indians are supposed to
have a concoction that is even
better for holding onto a wet ball
than resin.
But there's no denying the fact
that the Beavers will be at a distinct
advantage on their home grounds,
for they are not only more used to
the poor weather conditions, but
they are also familiar with the pecu
liar spongy turf at Corvallis. Even
so, we don't expect to see the Cardi
nal attack bog down just because of
the weather conditions, as important
as (hey might be. Furthermore, it
might be a beautiful day up there.
And the Indians will be prepared for
that, too.

intramural grid season has
just started, but already there
have been several lorfeits. What
we're wondering is why an organi
zation's mural manager signs his
team up for a sport, if that team
isn't going to compete.
Bobby .Burnett, who, .inciden
tally, is the hardest working in
tramural head we've seen in action
here, is doing a great job, but it
doesn't help him any when the
teams he schedules don't show up.
Nor is it fair to the other teams
in the league, for, although a win,
he it by a victory on the field or
via the forfeit route, moves an out
fit just that much closer to the
crown, the idea of the whole set
up is competition. And there's no
competition involved in a win by
forfeit.
Although the Firehouse is still the
number one choice to go through
undefeated again, look for a couple
of other teams to make the going
rough. The D.U.'s, with southpaw
Russ Smilh and rangy Bill Cowden
forming a real pass combination,
promise great things. Also included
in the up-and-coming category
should be the Kappa Sigs, who use
a modified "T"' formation, with Frank
Wells running in the quarterback
spot. Wells should have some good
ideas; he's an assistant freshman
grid mentor, and the Papoose squad
uses the "T."
Count the Zetes in, too. When
Sandy Tatum, all-intramural back,
returns from his trip and Cootie
Thompson, former Indian pitching
wizard who is now with the Holly
wood Stars, decides to play, the
Zotes will have a more potent out
fit than they had early this week.

TF THERE is anything Coach Clark
Shaughnessy doesn't take intc
consideration when he prepares hit
team for a game, we certainly don'l
know about it.
In much the same manner as he
got his charges ready for their trek
to Pullman last fall for the Wash
ington State game, Shaughnessy hat
bo en taking into account all even
tualities as he runs his squad
through its stud in preparation foi
the battle with the surprising Ore
gon State Beavers at Corval'is this
Saturday.
It's not raining down here, hut
it might he up there. So the wily
Scotch-Irish mentor lias had the
foothall managers dunking the
oval in a bucket of water between
plays in order that the gridders
will get used to handling the wet
pill. The Indians are supposed to
have a concoction that is even
better for holding onto a wet ball
than resin.
But there's no denying the fact
that the Beavers will be at a distinct
advantage on their home grounds,
for they are not only more used to
the poor weather conditions, but
they are also familiar with the pecu
liar spongy turf at Corvallis. Even
so, we don't expect to see the Cardi
nal attack bog down just because of
the weather conditions, as important
as (hey might be. Furthermore, it
might be a beautiful day up there.
And the Indians will be prepared for
that, too.

intramural grid season has
just started, but already there
have been several lorfeits. What
we're wondering is why an organi
zation's mural manager signs his
team up for a sport, if that team
isn't going to compete.
Bobby .Burnett, who, .inciden
tally, is the hardest working in
tramural head we've seen in action
here, is doing a great job, but it
doesn't help him any when the
teams he schedules don't show up.
Nor is it fair to the other teams
in the league, for, although a win,
he it by a victory on the field or
via the forfeit route, moves an out
fit just that much closer to the
crown, the idea of the whole set
up is competition. And there's no
competition involved in a win by
forfeit.
Although the Firehouse is still the
number one choice to go through
undefeated again, look for a couple
of other teams to make the going
rough. The D.U.'s, with southpaw
Russ Smilh and rangy Bill Cowden
forming a real pass combination,
promise great things. Also included
in the up-and-coming category
should be the Kappa Sigs, who use
a modified "T"' formation, with Frank
Wells running in the quarterback
spot. Wells should have some good
ideas; he's an assistant freshman
grid mentor, and the Papoose squad
uses the "T."
Count the Zetes in, too. When
Sandy Tatum, all-intramural back,
returns from his trip and Cootie
Thompson, former Indian pitching
wizard who is now with the Holly
wood Stars, decides to play, the
Zotes will have a more potent out
fit than they had early this week.
