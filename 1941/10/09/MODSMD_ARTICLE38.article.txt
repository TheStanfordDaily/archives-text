## 'JOLTING JIM' ENDS CAREER 
### 

THE FOOTBALL CAREER of "Jolting Jim" Jurkovich, Cal's poten
tial All-American hack, has been ended through an edict of the team
physician, which prescribes an end to his gridiron activities. Inju
ries kept him benched most of last season and he was hurt again in
the Cal-Washington State game, Saturday. Jim, a graduate of Fresno
High, was greatly admired by his grid teammates and opponents.
