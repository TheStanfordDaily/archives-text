# Frosh Prepare For Troy Game
## 
### 
Harry Shipkey's Papeese rolled
through another impressive work
! out yesterday afternoon, their last
before the Trobabe-Stanford grid
titanic in Los Angeles Saturday
| morning. The yearlings entrain to
morrow for the Southland.
Down at Southern California
i Mentor Gus Shaver greeted a turn
! out of 38 men and opened his sea
son drubbing Reedley J. C. two
! weeks ago, 27-0.
The Trobabes scored in every pe-
I riod against the Jaysees and con-
I trolled the game much the same as
the Stanford frosh when they took
care of Long Beach last week,
i 20-0.
BACKFIELD ANNOUNCED
In the Trojan backfield are Jim
Hardy, quarter, Dick Finch and
Tom Harper, halves, and Lowell
Wagner, full. At left end is Jim
! Stangeland, all-Southern California
man. Stangeland missed the Reed
ley game because of injuries, and if
he is not in shape Ken Donnelley,
former prep star at South Pasadena
High, will take over.
Remainder of the forward wall is
| made up of Jack Levengood and
j Tom Bossert, tackles; A1 Ohanus and
Paul Nelson, guards; and Otto Kil—
j ian, center.
Kilian made things tough for the
{S.C. varsity when the two squads
; scrimmaged recently, and will prob
i ably do the same for Frank Moul
ton, probable starter at center for
the Card frosh.
WEIGHTS EVEN
The Trobabes' line averages 183
in contrast to the Papooses' 193,
while the southerner's backfield
scales 174 to Stanford's 171.
On the basis of the shellacking
handed Reedley, Saturday's encoun
ter should be a toss-up, with the
Papooses given a slight edge on
their two victories over Long Beach
and Bakersfield.
Jack McCurdy, ace frosh center,
who has been nursing a bruised an
; kle since the season opened, alter
| nated with Moulton yesterday.

before the Trobabe-Stanford grid
titanic in Los Angeles Saturday
| morning. The yearlings entrain to
morrow for the Southland.
Down at Southern California
i Mentor Gus Shaver greeted a turn
! out of 38 men and opened his sea
son drubbing Reedley J. C. two
! weeks ago, 27-0.
The Trobabes scored in every pe-
I riod against the Jaysees and con-
I trolled the game much the same as
the Stanford frosh when they took
care of Long Beach last week,
i 20-0.
BACKFIELD ANNOUNCED
In the Trojan backfield are Jim
Hardy, quarter, Dick Finch and
Tom Harper, halves, and Lowell
Wagner, full. At left end is Jim
! Stangeland, all-Southern California
man. Stangeland missed the Reed
ley game because of injuries, and if
he is not in shape Ken Donnelley,
former prep star at South Pasadena
High, will take over.
Remainder of the forward wall is
| made up of Jack Levengood and
j Tom Bossert, tackles; A1 Ohanus and
Paul Nelson, guards; and Otto Kil—
j ian, center.
Kilian made things tough for the
{S.C. varsity when the two squads
; scrimmaged recently, and will prob
i ably do the same for Frank Moul
ton, probable starter at center for
the Card frosh.
WEIGHTS EVEN
The Trobabes' line averages 183
in contrast to the Papooses' 193,
while the southerner's backfield
scales 174 to Stanford's 171.
On the basis of the shellacking
handed Reedley, Saturday's encoun
ter should be a toss-up, with the
Papooses given a slight edge on
their two victories over Long Beach
and Bakersfield.
Jack McCurdy, ace frosh center,
who has been nursing a bruised an
; kle since the season opened, alter
| nated with Moulton yesterday.
Harry Shipkey's Papeese rolled
through another impressive work
! out yesterday afternoon, their last
