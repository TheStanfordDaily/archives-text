## 
### 
Fencing Coacfc luwyn Uugge nas
announced that there will be no
scheduled fencing tournaments in
the intercollegiate league until the
winter and spring quarters.
Busy at the present time with 13
I promising beginners, Bugge has
I hopes for future matches. Two
members of last year's squad re
j main to star in the coming tourna
ments, Bob Helliwell and John
Boyd, who, as members of the team,
saw six consecutive wins which gave
Stanford the Pacific Coast inter
j ccMegiate iloij championships in
cluding a victory over Utah.
It is Bugge's hope that he will
j have several promising recruits
i from the beginners' squad to re
place the men who graduated last
year. The advanced fencing team
will leave Coach Bugge something to
fall back on "with such able foil
tilters as Robeft Earl, IJ. Lotnax, T.
I Schlageter, H. Strick, and C. Wong.
