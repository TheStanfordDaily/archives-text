# Our Voice on the B.A.C.

### 
THE DAILY backs no candidates in any elec
tion.
For the second successive year, however, The
Daily strongly advocates that a non-athlete and
non-physical education major be elected as
student member of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
Why? Wouldn't an athlete be the logical can
didate? Wouldn't he understand the athletic
problems facing the B.A.C. better than a non
athlete?
This would appear reasonable. But look at
the records. In the past, athletes were almost
invariably elected to the B.A.C. And in the past,
student body opinion on B.A.C. problems has
carried little or no weight. This appears to be
the case even when the problem considered
concerned only the student body, as in Excom's
request last year for identifying pictures on
student body cards.
The next step in logic is: athletes on the B.A.C.
do not make for a strong student voice on ath
letic problems.
Let an editorial in last February's Daily enu
merate the reasons:
"While an athlete may know well enough the
reactions of his teammates to Board policies, he
is, three-fourths of the time, a physical education
major. If not a major, he often does much work
in the department. As such he is dependent
upon recommendation from his department in
seeking a coaching or teaching job after grad
uation.
"With his future in mind, he is naturally hesi
tant about opposing any action proposed by
faculty or alumni or administrative members
of the Board.
"Sometimes the athlete is on a scholarship
from an alumni group, one of whose most prom
inent members may be on the Board. Under
these circumstances it is impossible for the
student to be completely free in his expression
of opinion.
"It would be absurd, of course, to imply that
any member of the Board indulges in actual
coercion to influence student members. Such
is not the case. But, try as he may, the Stan
ford man or woman who votes next week cannot
overlook the fact that an unstated, implied co
ercion exists if an athlete is named to the 8.A.C."
This year there is additional need for a non-
P.E. major to servo on the Board; the other
elected member, named last year, is a star foot
ball player, Pete Kmetovic.
Elect someone who is free from athletic in
fluences; one who knows the student body will;
one who will fight for it.â€”Herman Silverman
