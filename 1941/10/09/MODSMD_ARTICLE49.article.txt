# Funny Bruins

IF we can do it without criticizing too sharply
the news judgment of our confrere, Malcolm
Steinlauf, editor of the California Daily Bruin, we
would like to recount for Stanford students the
front page play of the Bruin last Monday fol
lowing the 33-0 debacle of last Saturday.
In large, heavy, black type stretching half
way across the page was a head reading "Ohio
State Buckeyes Outclassed Trojans â€” S.C.
Slaughtered by Power Attack." Three of the
remaining columns were filled with a swell
action shot of the Ohio State-Trojan game. No
mention of Stanford. There were four top stories
on local Westwood items, and the fifth, we
reprint herewith for Stanford's enjoyment:
"2344 Bruins Return from Northern Trip"
(small headline).
Forty-tour members ot the varsity football
team returned late yesterday from a short
visit to the San Francisco bay region.
The players were accompanied by several
coaches and assistants, as well as some 2300
rooters.
While in the North the team members and
other students observed the local attractions
of the area. Included on the itinerary was a
brief stop at Stanford university, located at
Palo Altofnot far from San Francisco proper.
Here on Saturday afternoon, the Westwood
players engaged the Stanford players in a
football match which lasted until evening.
There was considerable local interest in the
event as evidenced by the sizable crowd of
35,000 which gathered to witness the exhibi
tion.
All of the members of the Bruin contingent
returned with a better understanding ot the

type ot work being done at the Northern in
stitution.
Don't worry, proud Stanfordites, they did ad
mit defeat and give our Rose-Bowling "T"-for
mation boys a little credit on one of their inside
pages. ,
