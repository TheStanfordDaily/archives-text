# Campus on Wheels

### 
STANFORD is faced with a paradox.
Fifty years have seen the Farm meta
morphose from a "walking campus" to a student
body on wheels.
And herein lies the paradox. Adopting mod
ern mechanical improvements, namely, the
automobile, is one thing—lagging behind in
safety measures is another.
In the rush to accept conveniences which the
automobile provides, it seems wise to stop and
remember the dangers which it brings. In this
connection, the campus police are undertaking
precautions for the direct benefit of pedestrian
and driver.
First, headlights must be dimmed within 500
feet of an oncoming vehicle, in compliance with
the Vehicle Code.
Second, bicycles will carry tail lights, as re
quired by law. Further, it is wise to carry flash
lights for protection at night.
Third, campus officials are raising the fine for
riding running boards from SI to $2.50.
These three moves are being enforced for
protection of the students and the beneficiaries
will reciprocate by adequate precautions.
All this, of course, is in addition to the strict
enforcement by Stanford's five-man police de
partment of all campus speed laws.
The pleasure car will not become a machine
for motorized destruction on the Farm.—Harold
