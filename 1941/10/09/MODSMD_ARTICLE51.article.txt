# BULL SESSION
## A 						VERY BAD JOKE 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
years ago, the United States government
decided that it wanted no part of European and
Asiatic troubles, that it wanted to keep to itself on
this large, well protected island, that it wanted to
live in peace and contentment, and the rest of the
world could take care of itself.
Administration officials decided that if an act were
passed saying that when there is a struggle, the United
States would remain absolutely neutral and not help
either side, then the U.S. couldn't possibly get itself
involved in any trouble. The Neutrality Act was passed.
Then also was passed a provision restricting private
loans to warring nations, and a cash and carry clause
which gave the President the right to prohibit all
shipment of goods to warring nations until transfer
of title had been made to the purchaser.

the United States, with the passage of a
couple of laws, smugly felt that it was safe, be
cause it said in the statutes that it was neutral and
no matter what might happen, the United States
wouldn't be interested and would stay on the fence.
But the United States, in the short time that I re
member, has never been neutral, and probably will
never be neutral in any important world crisis. It is
too large, its interests and stakes too wide, not to be
affected and interested in things that happen in the
world. And to be neutral means to be indifferent to
the course world affah-s take.
During the Spanish Civil War, we were not neutral,
that is, most of our people and interests and sympa
thies were on the side of the Loyalists, and most of us
wanted the defeat of Franco and Hitler and Mussolini.
But we put up the law, we laid down the embargo
clause, and instead of at least being neutral, we ac
tually were aiding the Rebels and Hitler and Musso
lini by cutting off our supplies to Loyalist Spain.
The same type of situation occurred during the
Chinese war. Everyone was in sympathy with the
Chinese. We declared, however, that we were neu
tral, we put up our embargo, and, in so doing, helped
the Japanese.

J>UT today there is even a greater world crisis. The
United States now fears invasion or economic
ruin if Hitler conquers the whole of Europe. And
again the United States is not neutral. We have chosen
sides again. The majority of the people favor a Brit
ish victory. We see again how useless and senseless
the act is. We see again that the people, and even our
government pay no attention to the act. The only thing
to do is throw the act out and think of it as a bad
joke.
