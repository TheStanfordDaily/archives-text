# CAMPUS OPINION
## JUST POLITICAL GUSH? 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
With regard to a recent letter running in Campus
Opinion (Confidence & Trust?) I would like very much
to know where you mustered up the gall to run such
a stupid, childish bit of second-hand political gush.
I know this is a free country and we have a free press,
but Mr. Editor, also remember that this is an institu
tion of higher learning and the inmates thereof gen
erally have a higher than average intelligence. They
are therefore interested in being slightly rational and
objective in their analysis and criticism.
Mr. Puzzled is puzzled about confidence in Mr.
Roosevelt. I'm puzzled as to how or if Mr. Puzzled
thinks, or is he just playing Polly Parrot for de
Colonel or somebody, and besides the election is over,
Herbert, Alfred, and Wendel all lost; remember?
