# OUT OF THE FRYING PANâ€”
## 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In regard to your editorial some time ago about
fire hazards at Encina, I wish to point out the fact
that ALL of Encina's outside doors open inward.
Furthermore, the unused half of the main door is
secured not only at the bottom, but at the top also,
far out of reach. Last of all, the fire hose for the lower
western corridor is gone. None was there at the begin
ning of the fall quarter.
The tragic effects of a panic in a building with in
ward opening doors are too well known to be retold
here. It isn't a question of the doors costing too much
to change, but whether they can be allowed to remain
in the present condition.
As for the hose, I understand that each class has
to pay for breakage. Three months ought to be a
long enough time to get a new one, Meanwhile, that
corridor remains doubly vulnerable, from fire and
from '44.
M T,
