## 
### 
The Stanford Trio, assisted by Elizabeth Pierce, Palo Alto violinist, last
night proved an excellent opening tit the concert season given by the Stan
ford Division of Music for the pleasure of the Friends of Music and their
guests.
"The History of the Sonata" was given graphically by the presentation
of examples of each type written for*

the different string instruments.
Selections were made from a reper
toire of several composers, thus
showing also the techniques of dif
ferent writers.
The program opened with the
Golden Sonata in F Major for two
violins and figured bass for piano
and violoncello by Henry Purcell,
presenting Ferenc Molnar and Eliza
beth Pierce, violins; Betty Barbour,
violoncello, and Carl Fuerstner,
piano.
EXCELLENT ADDITION
This sonata is an example of the
Largo, the solemn movement of the
Adagio, the brisk Canzona, the well
grounded rhythm of the Grave, and
the lively Scherzando. Miss Pierce
proved an excellent addition to the
trio in this number. We hope to see
more of her in the near future.
This was followed by an example
of a sonata for violoncello in which
Betty Barbour proved herself com
plete master of her instrument. Her
obligato passages were executed
with noticeable skill. She presented
Corelli's Sonata in D Minor for Vio
loncello.
Mr. Fuerstner demonstrated the
sonata written for piano in G mi
nor and G major. The artist re
vealed his talent and training to
excellent advantage in his handling
of the somewhat monotonous ex
pression of Scarlatti's sonatas.
MOLNAR SUPERB
In a sonata written for the violin
by Handel, Ferenc Molnar gave his
usual stellar performance to which
musical audiences at Stanford have
become accustomed through his nu
merous appearances here.
A fitting climax to this first pro
gram of the concert series, given to
Stanford University by Mrs. Eliza
beth Sprague Coolidge and the
Friends of Music, was a trio for
piano, violin and violoncello, dedi
cated to Mrs. Coolidge.—Craig

The Stanford Trio, assisted by Elizabeth Pierce, Palo Alto violinist, last
night proved an excellent opening tit the concert season given by the Stan
ford Division of Music for the pleasure of the Friends of Music and their
guests.
"The History of the Sonata" was given graphically by the presentation
of examples of each type written for*

the different string instruments.
Selections were made from a reper
toire of several composers, thus
showing also the techniques of dif
ferent writers.
The program opened with the
Golden Sonata in F Major for two
violins and figured bass for piano
and violoncello by Henry Purcell,
presenting Ferenc Molnar and Eliza
beth Pierce, violins; Betty Barbour,
violoncello, and Carl Fuerstner,
piano.
EXCELLENT ADDITION
This sonata is an example of the
Largo, the solemn movement of the
Adagio, the brisk Canzona, the well
grounded rhythm of the Grave, and
the lively Scherzando. Miss Pierce
proved an excellent addition to the
trio in this number. We hope to see
more of her in the near future.
This was followed by an example
of a sonata for violoncello in which
Betty Barbour proved herself com
plete master of her instrument. Her
obligato passages were executed
with noticeable skill. She presented
Corelli's Sonata in D Minor for Vio
loncello.
Mr. Fuerstner demonstrated the
sonata written for piano in G mi
nor and G major. The artist re
vealed his talent and training to
excellent advantage in his handling
of the somewhat monotonous ex
pression of Scarlatti's sonatas.
MOLNAR SUPERB
In a sonata written for the violin
by Handel, Ferenc Molnar gave his
usual stellar performance to which
musical audiences at Stanford have
become accustomed through his nu
merous appearances here.
A fitting climax to this first pro
gram of the concert series, given to
Stanford University by Mrs. Eliza
beth Sprague Coolidge and the
Friends of Music, was a trio for
piano, violin and violoncello, dedi
cated to Mrs. Coolidge.—Craig
