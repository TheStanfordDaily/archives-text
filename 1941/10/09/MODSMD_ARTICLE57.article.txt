Stanford University and 57 other
engineering colleges throughout the
country will have classes this year
for the training of industrial em
ployees in accident prevention.
These programs are part of a pro
gram inaugurated by the National
Committee for the Conservation of
Manpower in Defense Industries ap
pointed recently by Secretary of
Labor Perkins.
"The rise in industrial accident
injuries during recent months is
much greater than justified by the
increase in employment and serious
wastage of the available supply of
workers in defense industries can
be checked only by stricter attention
to the correction of work hazards
and by wider application of accident
prevention methods which have
been developed and applied suc
cessfully in some of the leading in
dustries," Secretary Perkins said.
Classes are made possible through
a grant of funds by Congress to the
U. S. Office of Education and made
available to engineering schools as
a part of the defense training pro
gram. While the safety courses will
be conducted under the general
management of the engineering col
leges, instructors will be selected
from a list of thoroughly experienced
safety engineers who have actually
worked in the field of accident pre
vention.
Secretary Perkins said that the
entire membership of the National
Committee for the Conservation of
Manpower in Defense Industries,
with its 400 safety engineers loaned
by industry, plus a paid field staff,
will actively assist the local engi
neering colleges with this project.
