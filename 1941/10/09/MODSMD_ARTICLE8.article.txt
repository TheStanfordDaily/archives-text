# Lunchers Plan Ambulance Unit
## British Government Needs 1,000 Drivers 
### 
An informal discussion of the
Stanford Ambulance Units of the
World War, and plans for such units
for service abroad now, was featui'ed
yesterday at the regular session of
the Luncheon Club.
Perry Patton, northern California
secretary for the American Field
Service, announced that the Brit
ish government had asked the AFS
for 400 ambulances and 1,000 driv
ers for service in the Middle East.
The 25-man units will remain to
gether for their term of service, and
their duties will be restricted to
driving. Patton called it a "noble
and humanitarian civilian service."
The University of California has
already organized the first western
unit, which will leave for the field
in early November.
Also contributing to the discussion
were Walter Bruns and Ed Kneass,
who served with the Stanford units
in the last war, and R. H. Hutchin
son, founder of the American Eagle
Club in London.
