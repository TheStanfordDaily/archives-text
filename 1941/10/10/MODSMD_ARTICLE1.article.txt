### AMIE REICHERT 
|>USSIA is fighting with her back
to the very walls of the Krem
lin, and the British are sitting right
tight on their little isle and wringing
their hands.
This is one of the major tragedies
of World War 11. The British peo
ple, the British press and, in all
probability, most of the British lead
ers want desperately to launch an
invasion in the West. But they sim
ply can not do it.
In Russia and the United States
many puzzled observers of this
latest wrinkle in Britain's war
policy are becoming resentful and
distrustful of the Churchill gov
ernment. They speak of a smug
Britain pursuing a policy of "you
stay in your yard, we'll stay in
ours."
They accuse the British of pre
paring to sell Russia down the river,
of letting the Red Army do their
fighting for them, of holding back in
order to force the United States into
the conflict.
* # #
the last twe years the British
have been waging purely defen
sive warfare. Except for the past few
months respite which enabled the
R.A.F. to pound Occupied France
and Germany, they have never been
able to carry the war to the Nazis.
The day Hitler marched across (he
Russian border was hailed as Brit
ain's first break of the war. Here
was her chance to inflict on Der
Fuehrer what he had dreaded and
shrunk from most: war on two
fronts.
What have the British done
with that matchless opportunity?
Everyone knows the answer: next
to nothing. But why?
Those who would dismiss the is
sue with the charge that the British
are waiting for America, or are sell
ing out the Russians should look
back on the record of Britain's per
formance thus far in this war. The
answer they will find there is an
even more painful one: the British
army hasn't got what it takes.

"IV OR WAY, Dunkirk, Greece, Crete.
Each time (excepting Dunkirk)
the British have been overcome by
superior forces, by shrewder mili
tary strategy, by the breathtaking
speed and unexpected tactics of the
Nazis. In every land encounter with
the Germans, the British have been
outclassed, and they have bungled.
Dunkirk was a tragic mistake, a
terrible and devastating combina
tion of unfavorable circumstances.
The treachery of the French and
Belgian leaders precluded a Brit
ish victory. But Norway, Greece,
and Crete were fiascos.
Dunkirk was acclaimed a great
victory because losses in men
•amounted to only 12 per cent, and
when one considers the trap the
B.E.F. was caught in, this is pretty
good. But in Greece the losses were
25 per cent, and in Crete 50 per
cent.
In each case the British lost al
most' all their heavy equipment.
And at Crete they lost four cruis
ers and six destroyers.

IN FACT, the only British success
on land was in Syria, and that
campaign took far too long for a
second-rate operation.
Somewhere along the line there
is something dangerously wrong
with the British military machine.
It is well-night impossible to judge
between the relative merits of
British and German equipment and
men at (bis time. But one striking
weakness is apparent in the Brit
ish army and this is the lack of
good generalship.
Archibald Wavell is the only Brit
ish general of any stature that this
war has produced. And his record
pales beside that of any German
general. Wavell has won two cam
paigns, lost two.

| IE is the British Lone Wolf fight
ing the star-studded combine of
List, von Runstedt, von Bock, and
von Leeb. And the odds are a little
steep even for Wavell, who is no
superman.
The British would like to make
that jump across the Channel but
they haven't got the equipment or
the generalship and they know it.

They accuse the British of pre
paring to sell Russia down the river,
of letting the Red Army do their
fighting for them, of holding back in
order to force the United States into
the conflict.

the last twe years the British
have been waging purely defen
sive warfare. Except for the past few
months respite which enabled the
R.A.F. to pound Occupied France
and Germany, they have never been
able to carry the war to the Nazis.
The day Hitler marched across (he
Russian border was hailed as Brit
ain's first break of the war. Here
was her chance to inflict on Der
Fuehrer what he had dreaded and
shrunk from most: war on two
fronts.
What have the British done
with that matchless opportunity?
Everyone knows the answer: next
to nothing. But why?
Those who would dismiss the is
sue with the charge that the British
are waiting for America, or are sell
ing out the Russians should look
back on the record of Britain's per
formance thus far in this war. The
answer they will find there is an
even more painful one: the British
army hasn't got what it takes.

"IV OR WAY, Dunkirk, Greece, Crete.
Each time (excepting Dunkirk)
the British have been overcome by
superior forces, by shrewder mili
tary strategy, by the breathtaking
speed and unexpected tactics of the
Nazis. In every land encounter with
the Germans, the British have been
outclassed, and they have bungled.
Dunkirk was a tragic mistake, a
terrible and devastating combina
tion of unfavorable circumstances.
The treachery of the French and
Belgian leaders precluded a Brit
ish victory. But Norway, Greece,
and Crete were fiascos.
Dunkirk was acclaimed a great
victory because losses in men
•amounted to only 12 per cent, and
when one considers the trap the
B.E.F. was caught in, this is pretty
good. But in Greece the losses were
25 per cent, and in Crete 50 per
cent.
In each case the British lost al
most' all their heavy equipment.
And at Crete they lost four cruis
ers and six destroyers.

IN FACT, the only British success
on land was in Syria, and that
campaign took far too long for a
second-rate operation.
Somewhere along the line there
is something dangerously wrong
with the British military machine.
It is well-night impossible to judge
between the relative merits of
British and German equipment and
men at (bis time. But one striking
weakness is apparent in the Brit
ish army and this is the lack of
good generalship.
Archibald Wavell is the only Brit
ish general of any stature that this
war has produced. And his record
pales beside that of any German
general. Wavell has won two cam
paigns, lost two.

| IE is the British Lone Wolf fight
ing the star-studded combine of
List, von Runstedt, von Bock, and
von Leeb. And the odds are a little
steep even for Wavell, who is no
superman.
The British would like to make
that jump across the Channel but
they haven't got the equipment or
the generalship and they know it.
|>USSIA is fighting with her back
to the very walls of the Krem
lin, and the British are sitting right
tight on their little isle and wringing
their hands.
This is one of the major tragedies
of World War 11. The British peo
ple, the British press and, in all
probability, most of the British lead
ers want desperately to launch an
invasion in the West. But they sim
ply can not do it.
In Russia and the United States
many puzzled observers of this
latest wrinkle in Britain's war
policy are becoming resentful and
distrustful of the Churchill gov
ernment. They speak of a smug
Britain pursuing a policy of "you
stay in your yard, we'll stay in
ours."
They accuse the British of pre
paring to sell Russia down the river,
of letting the Red Army do their
fighting for them, of holding back in
