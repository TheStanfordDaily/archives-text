# WE WON'T FIGHT BACK

(An Editorial)

Ex Committee thought last Tuesday night that it was taking
up the problem of inter-campus raiding between Stanford and
California far in advance of actual needs.
After all the game is almost two months away, they said.
But they met and soberly discussed all the attendant elements.
Cal's student body officers sat in on the meeting. They were
tnere to find out just what we were going to do about this raid
ing business. They found out.
We are going to enforce the severest penalty possible—ex
pulsion from the University—for any Stanford student, freshman
or upperclassman, who creates "any disturbance, any act of van
dalism . . . defacement of property" on the University of Cali
fornia campus.
But as it happengd, Excom's discussion was just in time.
As explained in the adjoining story, a spirited tradition has
been dropped because of the actions of the raiders from Berkeley.
The traditions of these two houses concerned a clock whose
possession had changed irregularly for the past 15 years.
That tradition is gone now. Cal will keep the clock.
We won't fight back.
It would not be good for the Berkeleyites to think that we are
softening up, that we are becoming a bunch of sissies, that we
are bowing to the iron-handed rule of a stodgy administration.
None of these is true.
We down here on the Farm have made our own decision to
abandon the senseless pranks so widely practiced by misdi
rected high school kids. We have made this decision thinking
back a few short days to the death of Johnny Phillips. We have
made it, not merely because of a provision in our constitution,
but because we now know too well what can happen when a
gang of fellows collectively proceed to lose their heads.
We have made our decision wishing to preserve the sports
manlike rivalry of our two great Universities.
Neither would it be good for Cal to think that we are appeal
ing to them to stay at home and leave us alone.
We are not doing that. It's just that we have made up oui
! minds.
We won't fight back.
Both St. Mary's and Santa Clara have been doing a little inter
raiding with Cal. More may be expected as the season goes on.
This is just an isolated instance of what may possibly increase
in intensity as the time for Big Game draws near.
The Cal house boasted in this morning's Daily Californian
that they had retrieved "their" clock. They made no mention of
the vandalism and property damage they perpetrated on their
"brothers" to get the clock back.
Though this may be a warning of "things to come" from
Berkeley, we are serving our warning right now—
We won't fight back.

been dropped because of the actions of the raiders from Berkeley.
The traditions of these two houses concerned a clock whose
possession had changed irregularly for the past 15 years.
That tradition is gone now. Cal will keep the clock.
We won't fight back.
It would not be good for the Berkeleyites to think that we are
softening up, that we are becoming a bunch of sissies, that we
are bowing to the iron-handed rule of a stodgy administration.
None of these is true.
We down here on the Farm have made our own decision to
abandon the senseless pranks so widely practiced by misdi
rected high school kids. We have made this decision thinking
back a few short days to the death of Johnny Phillips. We have
made it, not merely because of a provision in our constitution,
but because we now know too well what can happen when a
gang of fellows collectively proceed to lose their heads.
We have made our decision wishing to preserve the sports
manlike rivalry of our two great Universities.
Neither would it be good for Cal to think that we are appeal
ing to them to stay at home and leave us alone.
We are not doing that. It's just that we have made up oui
! minds.
We won't fight back.
Both St. Mary's and Santa Clara have been doing a little inter
raiding with Cal. More may be expected as the season goes on.
This is just an isolated instance of what may possibly increase
in intensity as the time for Big Game draws near.
The Cal house boasted in this morning's Daily Californian
that they had retrieved "their" clock. They made no mention of
the vandalism and property damage they perpetrated on their
"brothers" to get the clock back.
Though this may be a warning of "things to come" from
Berkeley, we are serving our warning right now—
We won't fight back.

Ex Committee thought last Tuesday night that it was taking
up the problem of inter-campus raiding between Stanford and
California far in advance of actual needs.
After all the game is almost two months away, they said.
But they met and soberly discussed all the attendant elements.
Cal's student body officers sat in on the meeting. They were
tnere to find out just what we were going to do about this raid
ing business. They found out.
We are going to enforce the severest penalty possible—ex
pulsion from the University—for any Stanford student, freshman
or upperclassman, who creates "any disturbance, any act of van
dalism . . . defacement of property" on the University of Cali
fornia campus.
But as it happengd, Excom's discussion was just in time.
As explained in the adjoining story, a spirited tradition has
been dropped because of the actions of the raiders from Berkeley.
