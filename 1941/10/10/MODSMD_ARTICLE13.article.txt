# Elimination of Fall Rushing Discussed by Row Council
## 
### 
Believing that fall rushing conflicts with a quarter schedule already
too heavily laden, a proposal to defer rushing entirely until winter quarter
occupied the limelight in last night's Stanford Interfraternity Council
meeting.
"There has been a strong feeling in favor of such a rule among many

fraternity members in the past few,
years," commented Interfraternity
President Jim Haugh upon the prop
osition.
Although no final action was
taken upon the measure, the ma
jority of the sixty-some delegates
seemed to favor the proposal, ac -
cording to Haugh.
TO BE DISCUSSED
House presidents will take the
idea back to their houses for dis
cussion in Monday night house
meetings. A special meeting of the
Council will be held Tuesday night
at 7:15 in the Nitcry to hear the
results of these discussions.
Until definite action has been
taken, emphasized Haugh, there will
be no rushing whatever of lower di
vision students.
YEAR PLANNED
General purpose of the meeting,
continued the Row leader, was "to

make plans for the coming ye.ir i'nd
to develop a complete understanding
of all rules governing fraternity con
duct."
For discussion of thei;* own par
ticular problems, Row presidents,
house managers, and rushing chair
men under the leadership of Haugh,
Jack Rittersbocker, and Colin Mc-
Clintock, respectively, held separate
meetings from 4:30 to 6.
WILBUR SPEAKS
A banquet in the Union at 6:30
wound up the affair with short
speeches by President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and George Whistler, chair
man of alumni advisers. Dr. Wilbur
told of the problems fraternities
must face in the event of a national
emergency, while Whistler comment
ed upon the great interest of alumni
in fraternity matters.
