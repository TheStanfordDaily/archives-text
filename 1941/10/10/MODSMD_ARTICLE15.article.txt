# Cal Chapter Raids Phi Kap House
## Berkeley Brothers Incited to Plunder By 'Clock' Tradition 
### 
Late Wednesday evening and early
yesterday morning the University of
California Alpha Lambda chapter of
Phi Kappa Sigma twice raided the
Stanford campus chapter house.
Original basis for the raid was a
tradition between the two chapters
in which each tried to retain pos
session of a large mantel clock. The
Stanford chapter held the clock,
which the California chapter re
gained in the raids.
The California men went through
the house and the rooms, taking
banners and pennants. They also
took mantel trophies, went through
a window screen, and searched a de
tached wing of the house.
BROTHERS AWAKENED
There they went through bureau
drawers, messed clothes and per
sonal items, and knocked clothes
hung in the closet to the floor.
Then, shouting loudly and ringing
a bell to awaken their Stanford
brothers, until then unaware of the
visitors, they shouted their identity
and sprang into an awaiting car for
the return dash to the California
campus.
Last Tuesday, Ex Committee met
with Ralph Fisher, U.C. student body
president, who promised to explain
at the earliest opportunity Stanford's
position to California students. This
will be done at next week's Cal Ex
com.
JACKSON COMMENT'S
"This (the raid) is the first step in
what we feared and therefore dis
cussed in the Excom meeting," com
mented George Jackson, A.S.S.U.
president, last night. "Spirit and
tradition are fine. It is a definite part
of our college life in a certain form.
"Last night's exhibition was not
spirit, though it might have started
out as such."
On the question of counter-raids,
Jackson definitely reaffirmed Ex
com's stand. He said:
"Let's make this clear. All Stan
ford is governed by a constitutional
provision which states that imme
diate expulsion shall be dealt to any
of our students participating in in
ter-campus raids. This year that
provision will be upheld even more
rigorously."
NO CONTROL
Continued Jackson, "The law has
been laid down. We have explained
our position to Cal. Their attitude
toward action on inter-campus raids
is different from ours. They do not
make the attempt, as does Stanford,
to control raids by their students."
California students Wednesday
night made a counter-raid against
the University of Santa Clara. Pre
vious to the St. Mary's game they
raided that campus.
Jackson continued: "These raids
start out as traditions, but fre
quently end up as free-for-alls. This
isn't like a raid up the row by our
freshmen. There will be men waiting
up at Cal for Stanford raiding
parties. Anything—and I mean any
thing—might. happen," he concluded.

of our students participating in in
ter-campus raids. This year that
provision will be upheld even more
rigorously."
NO CONTROL
Continued Jackson, "The law has
been laid down. We have explained
our position to Cal. Their attitude
toward action on inter-campus raids
is different from ours. They do not
make the attempt, as does Stanford,
to control raids by their students."
California students Wednesday
night made a counter-raid against
the University of Santa Clara. Pre
vious to the St. Mary's game they
raided that campus.
Jackson continued: "These raids
start out as traditions, but fre
quently end up as free-for-alls. This
isn't like a raid up the row by our
freshmen. There will be men waiting
up at Cal for Stanford raiding
parties. Anything—and I mean any
thing—might. happen," he concluded.
Late Wednesday evening and early
yesterday morning the University of
California Alpha Lambda chapter of
Phi Kappa Sigma twice raided the
Stanford campus chapter house.
Original basis for the raid was a
tradition between the two chapters
in which each tried to retain pos
session of a large mantel clock. The
Stanford chapter held the clock,
which the California chapter re
gained in the raids.
The California men went through
the house and the rooms, taking
banners and pennants. They also
took mantel trophies, went through
a window screen, and searched a de
tached wing of the house.
BROTHERS AWAKENED
There they went through bureau
drawers, messed clothes and per
sonal items, and knocked clothes
hung in the closet to the floor.
Then, shouting loudly and ringing
a bell to awaken their Stanford
brothers, until then unaware of the
visitors, they shouted their identity
and sprang into an awaiting car for
the return dash to the California
campus.
Last Tuesday, Ex Committee met
with Ralph Fisher, U.C. student body
president, who promised to explain
at the earliest opportunity Stanford's
position to California students. This
will be done at next week's Cal Ex
com.
JACKSON COMMENT'S
"This (the raid) is the first step in
what we feared and therefore dis
cussed in the Excom meeting," com
mented George Jackson, A.S.S.U.
president, last night. "Spirit and
tradition are fine. It is a definite part
of our college life in a certain form.
"Last night's exhibition was not
spirit, though it might have started
out as such."
On the question of counter-raids,
Jackson definitely reaffirmed Ex
com's stand. He said:
"Let's make this clear. All Stan
ford is governed by a constitutional
provision which states that imme
diate expulsion shall be dealt to any
of our students participating in in
ter-campus raids. This year that
provision will be upheld even more
rigorously."
