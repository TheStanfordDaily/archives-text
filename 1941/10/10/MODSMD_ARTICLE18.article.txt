Now is the time to get old Uncle
Thorndyke's elephant gun out of the
mothballs and try your hand at a
little target shooting with the Stan
ford Rifle Club. This year the club
is putting on an extensive drive for
new members and everyone is urged
to come out.
The club is quartered in the base
ment of the Administration Build
ing. There are two ranges, each the
required 50-foot length, with a back
drop of sheet-iron and rock. Each
member purchases his own shells at
cost from the club and the regula
tion targets are furnished free.
Stanford recognizes rifle shooting
as a minor sport and letters are
granted to those who are able to
shoot a certain score and to those
who compete in the match against
California. Of recent years this
match has not been held, but Carlos
Asensio - Wunderlich, president of
the club this year, is hoping that
there will be enough of a turnout
in the next few weeks to make such
a match possible.
The University donated four
rifles to the club when it was or
ganized. These are excellent guns,
having .22 modern Springfield
frames. In addition, the club has
four other rifles and a pistol. All
the guns are kept in the club
room.
Intra-ciub matches are now be
ing shot, and at the end of the
quarter the scores will be totaled
and the two highest members will
receive specially made medals.

Each club member wears the at- I
tractive emblem of the club, a
small red "S" with a rifle and
pistol at the base.
The Stanford club is affiliated with j
the National Rifle Association of ;
America. To be a member in regu- I
lar standing, a target a week in \
each of the positions must be shot, j
Dues of the club are a dollar a
quarter.
Secretary of the club is Sue Stew
art, the only woman member of the
club and equally adept with either

rifle or pistol. "I wish some more
girls would turn out," she said. At
present 17 members have signed up,
and there is a total of eight guns
in the club.
The big need of the club now is
for another spotting scope for the
second range, according to Wunder
lich. "We also need a new pistol, a
new rifle, and shooting coats and
gloves for use during the matches.
Our next turnout is on Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings of next week,
at 7:30."

Now is the time to get old Uncle
Thorndyke's elephant gun out of the
mothballs and try your hand at a
little target shooting with the Stan
ford Rifle Club. This year the club
is putting on an extensive drive for
new members and everyone is urged
to come out.
The club is quartered in the base
ment of the Administration Build
ing. There are two ranges, each the
required 50-foot length, with a back
drop of sheet-iron and rock. Each
member purchases his own shells at
cost from the club and the regula
tion targets are furnished free.
Stanford recognizes rifle shooting
as a minor sport and letters are
granted to those who are able to
shoot a certain score and to those
who compete in the match against
California. Of recent years this
match has not been held, but Carlos
Asensio - Wunderlich, president of
the club this year, is hoping that
there will be enough of a turnout
in the next few weeks to make such
a match possible.
The University donated four
rifles to the club when it was or
ganized. These are excellent guns,
having .22 modern Springfield
frames. In addition, the club has
four other rifles and a pistol. All
the guns are kept in the club
room.
Intra-ciub matches are now be
ing shot, and at the end of the
quarter the scores will be totaled
and the two highest members will
receive specially made medals.

Each club member wears the at- I
tractive emblem of the club, a
small red "S" with a rifle and
pistol at the base.
The Stanford club is affiliated with j
the National Rifle Association of ;
America. To be a member in regu- I
lar standing, a target a week in \
each of the positions must be shot, j
Dues of the club are a dollar a
quarter.
Secretary of the club is Sue Stew
art, the only woman member of the
club and equally adept with either

rifle or pistol. "I wish some more
girls would turn out," she said. At
present 17 members have signed up,
and there is a total of eight guns
in the club.
The big need of the club now is
for another spotting scope for the
second range, according to Wunder
lich. "We also need a new pistol, a
new rifle, and shooting coats and
gloves for use during the matches.
Our next turnout is on Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings of next week,
at 7:30."
