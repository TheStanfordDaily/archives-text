# Indians Invade Beaver Lair; Face Third Hurdle On Path to Rose Bowl
## Stanford Favored to Extend Win Streak to 14 Over Oregon State Giant Killers Tomorrow at Corvallis 
### H. D. THOREAU III 
The remodeled "T," which has already ruined the Quack and qunehed
the Bruin, headed for Corvallis yesterday afternoon on track 29 to attempt
to remove Oregon State's Beaver from that long and treacherous path to
Pasadena.
When the Red faces the Orange tomorrow afternoon in the O.S.C.

stadium the all-around prowess
Frankie Albert, the maneuvering of
Peter Krnetovic, the drive of the
Stanford line, and the coaching wiz
ardry of Clark Daniel Shaughnessy |
vill test itself against the twin
ti .ple-threatedness of Don Durdan
and Bob Dethman, the heft and ex
perience of the Beaver forwards,
and the unexpected spirit of Lon
Stiner's men.
THIRTY-EIGHT PLAYERS
Thirty-eight players, three coach
es, three managers, one saw-bones,
one trainer, and several stooges
climbed aboard the train, all with
the thought of returning Sunday
with the Beaver pelt under their
belt.
In their last workout prior to leav
ing, the squad went through a de
fensive drill outfitted in sweat suits.
After their arrival in Corvallis this
morning they will partake of a
short limbering-up drill before go
ing into their 18-hour pre-game hi
bernation.
The team that typld Stanford to a
7 to 7 tie in the first half of the 1940
game had a dismal outlook when
September came around this year
with their big offensive threats,
plunging fullbacks Jim Kisselburgh
and Kenny Dow, gone the way of
all good students. Kisselburgh, all
coast selection for two years, had
also been their kicker and a pillar
of strength on defense from his po
sition backing up the line.
ONE WON, ONE LOST
However, when it came to actually
playing games of football, O.S.C.
had a team not to be overlooked as
evidenced by the fact that South
ern California had to score in the
last minute of play to edge out the
Orangemen, 13 to 7, in the season
opener in Los Angeles, and that the
much publicized Washington Hus
kies were not able to score in the
last minutes and were thereby de
feated, 9 to 6, by the team from the
Oregon State Agricultural College.
An analysis of the first two games
played this year by both teams
shows that they both boast the same
type of attack—pass when it's handy
and run when it's handy. Against
the Trojans the Beavers, namely
Dethman, threw the ball all over the
Memorial Coliseum to the discom
fort of their opponents. One week
later in their own fcailiwick the
total yards gained from passing
amounted to exactly one dozen.
They relied almost entirely on a
ground attack.
Stanford followed much the same
