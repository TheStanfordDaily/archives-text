# Indians Invade Beaver Lair; Face Third Hurdle On Path to Rose Bowl
## Stanford Favored to Extend Win Streak to 14 Over Oregon State Giant Killers Tomorrow at Corvallis 
### H. D. THOREAU III 
The remodeled "T," which has already ruined the Quack and qunehed
the Bruin, headed for Corvallis yesterday afternoon on track 29 to attempt
to remove Oregon State's Beaver from that long and treacherous path to
Pasadena.
When the Red faces the Orange tomorrow afternoon in the O.S.C.

stadium the all-around prowess
Frankie Albert, the maneuvering of
Peter Krnetovic, the drive of the
Stanford line, and the coaching wiz
ardry of Clark Daniel Shaughnessy |
vill test itself against the twin
ti .ple-threatedness of Don Durdan
and Bob Dethman, the heft and ex
perience of the Beaver forwards,
and the unexpected spirit of Lon
Stiner's men.
THIRTY-EIGHT PLAYERS
Thirty-eight players, three coach
es, three managers, one saw-bones,
one trainer, and several stooges
climbed aboard the train, all with
the thought of returning Sunday
with the Beaver pelt under their
belt.
In their last workout prior to leav
ing, the squad went through a de
fensive drill outfitted in sweat suits.
After their arrival in Corvallis this
morning they will partake of a
short limbering-up drill before go
ing into their 18-hour pre-game hi
bernation.
The team that typld Stanford to a
7 to 7 tie in the first half of the 1940
game had a dismal outlook when
September came around this year
with their big offensive threats,
plunging fullbacks Jim Kisselburgh
and Kenny Dow, gone the way of
all good students. Kisselburgh, all
coast selection for two years, had
also been their kicker and a pillar
of strength on defense from his po
sition backing up the line.
ONE WON, ONE LOST
However, when it came to actually
playing games of football, O.S.C.
had a team not to be overlooked as
evidenced by the fact that South
ern California had to score in the
last minute of play to edge out the
Orangemen, 13 to 7, in the season
opener in Los Angeles, and that the
much publicized Washington Hus
kies were not able to score in the
last minutes and were thereby de
feated, 9 to 6, by the team from the
Oregon State Agricultural College.
An analysis of the first two games
played this year by both teams
shows that they both boast the same
type of attack—pass when it's handy
and run when it's handy. Against
the Trojans the Beavers, namely
Dethman, threw the ball all over the
Memorial Coliseum to the discom
fort of their opponents. One week
later in their own fcailiwick the
total yards gained from passing
amounted to exactly one dozen.
They relied almost entirely on a
ground attack.
Stanford followed much the same
proceduro in its initial encounters. A
staunch Oregon line forced Albert j
to pass to a win, while a not-so- ;
staunch U.C.L.A. defense enabled
Mr. Shaughnessy's disciples to run
around, through, and between the !
Bruins.
The Beavers work with two al
most equally good units in the line.
From left end to right end the start- !
ing lineup will probably include:
George Zellick, George Bain, Bill
Halverson, Quontin Greenough.
Martin Chaves, Stan Czech, and
Norm Peters.
Stanford will use its regular
starting line of Arnie Meiners, Ed
Stamm, Chuck Taylor, Loren La-
Prade, Bruno Banducci, and Fred
Meyer. However, the end spots will
be weakened by the loss of Hank
Norberg, who relieved Meiners.
Captain George Peters may be
one of the most astute signal callers
on the coast. Captain George Pe
ters may be an outstanding blocker.
The Cap might also be a fine pass
receiver, but since he plays quarter
back he must necessarily be shoved
behind the star of Frankie Albert.
Albert will have to hold up N the
Cards' side of the impending passing
duel, as well as doing the punting
and thinking.
HOOT IN LINEUP
"Hoot" Armstrong is back in the
lineup for Stanford, which gives the
Farm team back some of the punch
it did not lack last week. Playing
opposite Armie is the first of Stiner's
twin tailbacks, Bob Dethman, who
runs and passes to the right.
Don Durdan is usually on the re
ceiving end of Dethman's passes and
usually does the running as left half
in the twin tailback outfit. His ram
ble against the Huskies last week for
80 yards was an exhibition of his
skill. Speaking of skill, it is a thing
of which Pete Kmetovic has plenty.
Only one of the three running backs
on the 1940 "T" still in school,
Kmetovic has handled very ad
mirably the burden of the ground
attack.
PROMISING SOPH
In three weeks' time Choc Shelton
has moved two veterans out of the
! starting fullback post on the Ore-
I gon State eleven. Although just a
sophomore, his size and ability have
more than compensated for his lack
of experience.
All things considered, as long as
j Frankie keeps "calling 'em where
[ they ain't" and as long as Skeeter
! Peter doesn't break both legs—one
i wouldn't phase him—Stanford can
go ahead with its New Year's Day
plans.

THIRTY-EIGHT PLAYERS
Thirty-eight players, three coach
es, three managers, one saw-bones,
one trainer, and several stooges
climbed aboard the train, all with
the thought of returning Sunday
with the Beaver pelt under their
belt.
In their last workout prior to leav
ing, the squad went through a de
fensive drill outfitted in sweat suits.
After their arrival in Corvallis this
morning they will partake of a
short limbering-up drill before go
ing into their 18-hour pre-game hi
bernation.
The team that typld Stanford to a
7 to 7 tie in the first half of the 1940
game had a dismal outlook when
September came around this year
with their big offensive threats,
plunging fullbacks Jim Kisselburgh
and Kenny Dow, gone the way of
all good students. Kisselburgh, all
coast selection for two years, had
also been their kicker and a pillar
of strength on defense from his po
sition backing up the line.
ONE WON, ONE LOST
However, when it came to actually
playing games of football, O.S.C.
had a team not to be overlooked as
evidenced by the fact that South
ern California had to score in the
last minute of play to edge out the
Orangemen, 13 to 7, in the season
opener in Los Angeles, and that the
much publicized Washington Hus
kies were not able to score in the
last minutes and were thereby de
feated, 9 to 6, by the team from the
Oregon State Agricultural College.
An analysis of the first two games
played this year by both teams
shows that they both boast the same
type of attack—pass when it's handy
and run when it's handy. Against
the Trojans the Beavers, namely
Dethman, threw the ball all over the
Memorial Coliseum to the discom
fort of their opponents. One week
later in their own fcailiwick the
total yards gained from passing
amounted to exactly one dozen.
They relied almost entirely on a
ground attack.
Stanford followed much the same
proceduro in its initial encounters. A
staunch Oregon line forced Albert j
to pass to a win, while a not-so- ;
staunch U.C.L.A. defense enabled
Mr. Shaughnessy's disciples to run
around, through, and between the !
Bruins.
The Beavers work with two al
most equally good units in the line.
From left end to right end the start- !
ing lineup will probably include:
George Zellick, George Bain, Bill
Halverson, Quontin Greenough.
Martin Chaves, Stan Czech, and
Norm Peters.
Stanford will use its regular
starting line of Arnie Meiners, Ed
Stamm, Chuck Taylor, Loren La-
Prade, Bruno Banducci, and Fred
Meyer. However, the end spots will
be weakened by the loss of Hank
Norberg, who relieved Meiners.
Captain George Peters may be
one of the most astute signal callers
on the coast. Captain George Pe
ters may be an outstanding blocker.
The Cap might also be a fine pass
receiver, but since he plays quarter
back he must necessarily be shoved
behind the star of Frankie Albert.
Albert will have to hold up N the
Cards' side of the impending passing
duel, as well as doing the punting
and thinking.
HOOT IN LINEUP
"Hoot" Armstrong is back in the
lineup for Stanford, which gives the
Farm team back some of the punch
it did not lack last week. Playing
opposite Armie is the first of Stiner's
twin tailbacks, Bob Dethman, who
runs and passes to the right.
Don Durdan is usually on the re
ceiving end of Dethman's passes and
usually does the running as left half
in the twin tailback outfit. His ram
ble against the Huskies last week for
80 yards was an exhibition of his
skill. Speaking of skill, it is a thing
of which Pete Kmetovic has plenty.

Farm team back some of the punch
it did not lack last week. Playing
opposite Armie is the first of Stiner's
twin tailbacks, Bob Dethman, who
runs and passes to the right.
Don Durdan is usually on the re
ceiving end of Dethman's passes and
usually does the running as left half
in the twin tailback outfit. His ram
ble against the Huskies last week for
80 yards was an exhibition of his
skill. Speaking of skill, it is a thing
of which Pete Kmetovic has plenty.
Only one of the three running backs
on the 1940 "T" still in school,
Kmetovic has handled very ad
mirably the burden of the ground
attack.
PROMISING SOPH
In three weeks' time Choc Shelton
has moved two veterans out of the
! starting fullback post on the Ore-
I gon State eleven. Although just a
sophomore, his size and ability have
more than compensated for his lack
of experience.
All things considered, as long as
j Frankie keeps "calling 'em where
[ they ain't" and as long as Skeeter
! Peter doesn't break both legs—one
i wouldn't phase him—Stanford can
go ahead with its New Year's Day
plans.
The remodeled "T," which has already ruined the Quack and qunehed
the Bruin, headed for Corvallis yesterday afternoon on track 29 to attempt
to remove Oregon State's Beaver from that long and treacherous path to
Pasadena.

THIRTY-EIGHT PLAYERS
Thirty-eight players, three coach
es, three managers, one saw-bones,
one trainer, and several stooges
climbed aboard the train, all with
the thought of returning Sunday
with the Beaver pelt under their
belt.
In their last workout prior to leav
ing, the squad went through a de
fensive drill outfitted in sweat suits.
After their arrival in Corvallis this
morning they will partake of a
short limbering-up drill before go
ing into their 18-hour pre-game hi
bernation.
The team that typld Stanford to a
7 to 7 tie in the first half of the 1940
game had a dismal outlook when
September came around this year
with their big offensive threats,
plunging fullbacks Jim Kisselburgh
and Kenny Dow, gone the way of
all good students. Kisselburgh, all
coast selection for two years, had
also been their kicker and a pillar
of strength on defense from his po
sition backing up the line.
ONE WON, ONE LOST
However, when it came to actually
playing games of football, O.S.C.
had a team not to be overlooked as
evidenced by the fact that South
ern California had to score in the
last minute of play to edge out the
Orangemen, 13 to 7, in the season
opener in Los Angeles, and that the
much publicized Washington Hus
kies were not able to score in the
last minutes and were thereby de
feated, 9 to 6, by the team from the
Oregon State Agricultural College.
An analysis of the first two games
played this year by both teams
shows that they both boast the same
type of attack—pass when it's handy
and run when it's handy. Against
the Trojans the Beavers, namely
Dethman, threw the ball all over the
Memorial Coliseum to the discom
fort of their opponents. One week
later in their own fcailiwick the
total yards gained from passing
amounted to exactly one dozen.
They relied almost entirely on a
ground attack.
Stanford followed much the same
proceduro in its initial encounters. A
staunch Oregon line forced Albert j
to pass to a win, while a not-so- ;
staunch U.C.L.A. defense enabled
Mr. Shaughnessy's disciples to run
around, through, and between the !
Bruins.
The Beavers work with two al
most equally good units in the line.
From left end to right end the start- !
ing lineup will probably include:
George Zellick, George Bain, Bill
Halverson, Quontin Greenough.
Martin Chaves, Stan Czech, and
Norm Peters.
Stanford will use its regular
starting line of Arnie Meiners, Ed
Stamm, Chuck Taylor, Loren La-
Prade, Bruno Banducci, and Fred
Meyer. However, the end spots will
be weakened by the loss of Hank
Norberg, who relieved Meiners.
Captain George Peters may be
one of the most astute signal callers
on the coast. Captain George Pe
ters may be an outstanding blocker.
The Cap might also be a fine pass
receiver, but since he plays quarter
back he must necessarily be shoved
behind the star of Frankie Albert.
Albert will have to hold up N the
Cards' side of the impending passing
duel, as well as doing the punting
and thinking.

Norberg, who relieved Meiners.
Captain George Peters may be
one of the most astute signal callers
on the coast. Captain George Pe
ters may be an outstanding blocker.
The Cap might also be a fine pass
receiver, but since he plays quarter
back he must necessarily be shoved
behind the star of Frankie Albert.
Albert will have to hold up N the
Cards' side of the impending passing
duel, as well as doing the punting
and thinking.
HOOT IN LINEUP
"Hoot" Armstrong is back in the
lineup for Stanford, which gives the
Farm team back some of the punch
it did not lack last week. Playing
opposite Armie is the first of Stiner's
twin tailbacks, Bob Dethman, who
runs and passes to the right.
Don Durdan is usually on the re
ceiving end of Dethman's passes and
usually does the running as left half
in the twin tailback outfit. His ram
ble against the Huskies last week for
80 yards was an exhibition of his
skill. Speaking of skill, it is a thing
of which Pete Kmetovic has plenty.
Only one of the three running backs
on the 1940 "T" still in school,
Kmetovic has handled very ad
mirably the burden of the ground
attack.
PROMISING SOPH
In three weeks' time Choc Shelton
has moved two veterans out of the
! starting fullback post on the Ore-
I gon State eleven. Although just a
sophomore, his size and ability have
more than compensated for his lack
of experience.
All things considered, as long as
j Frankie keeps "calling 'em where
[ they ain't" and as long as Skeeter
! Peter doesn't break both legs—one
i wouldn't phase him—Stanford can
go ahead with its New Year's Day
plans.
