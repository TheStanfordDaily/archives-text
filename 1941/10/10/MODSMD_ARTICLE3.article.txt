Ash Wilson, director of this year's
Big Game Gaieties, issued a re
minder yesterday that Monday, Oct.
13, is the final day to submit songs
for the show.
Next Wednesday scripts arc due.
While the theme of the show hasn't
been definitely decided upon, ideas
and suggestions arc acceptable. The
sooner they are handed in, the bet
ter chance they will have in the
selection process, Wilson said.
Any song, gag, or idea will do,
and positions on the stage crew are
available.
October 17 tryouts for singint*
parts will be held, and acting selec
tions will be made on Oct. 20. Oc
tober 24, rill candidates for the danc
ing parts will be chosen.
