# Fire Destroys Farmer's Home
## Fire House Leaves Game to Fight Blaze 
### 
Tragedy again descended upon the
house of K. Takimoto, Japanese
farmer, when fire of unknown ori
gin burned his house to the ground
on the George Webb strawberry :
ranch, located near Felt Lake on I
Stanford University property, yes- J
terday afternoon.
Last year, Takimoto's wife
drowned when she fell into a creek
which runs behind the house.
Damages from the fire were esti
mated by Webb at $500, and it was
not covered by insurance. Nothing [
wt:s recovered from the building.
The fire was answered by one truck
of the Stanford Fire Department.
Three Takimoto children, who
usually play in the house while their !
father is at work in the fields, were
fortunately not at homeâ€”they were j
said to be visiting neighbors.
