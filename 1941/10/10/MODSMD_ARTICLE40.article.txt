# 'No Relation,' Says Student
## Adolfo Arias Opposes Ex-President's Policy 
### VIC MINAHAN 
As teletype machines throughout
the country yesterday recorded the
sensational news of the ousting of
Panama's pro-Nazi President Ar
nulfo Arias, Stanford's Panamanian
dramatic star Adolfo Arias answered
the question which popped immedi
ately into the minds of Stanfordites:
''No, I am n'o relation to Presi
dent Arias."
In fact, Arias, was has played the
lead in several Gaieties and other
student productions, is the nephew
of one of the ousted president's bit
terest political enemies — Francisco
Arias, former Panamanian minister
to the U.S. who ran against Presi
dent Arias in the last presidential
election.
VERY HAPPY'
In commenting on the news from
his homeland, Arias said yesterday
in a telephone interview, "The news
from home makes me happy, not only
because my uncle is an opposition
leader and I am in sympathy with
the movement myself, but because
I know my people are behind it also.
. "The President has never had the
support of the Panamanian people;
all he had was power."
Arias said he knew the deposed
president personally, as well as his
successor, Adolpho De La Guardia.
"De La Guardia is a very good
man," he commented.
Not only has President Arias been
pro-Nazi, but the election in which
he defeated Arias' uncle for the
presidency had been a fraud, ac
cording to the Stanford student. He
recalled how his uncle along with
other opposition leaders had been
arrested on the day before the elec
tion.
ILLEGAL VOTING
"Then when the few people that
went to the polls opened their bal
lots, in most cases they found only
the names of the government candi
dates. The vote as announced gave
President Arias the election by
some 350,000 to 235 or thereabouts—
a total higher than the number of
voters in the country."
Arias said he had had no news
from Panama on the political situa
tion, but that he was sure his uncle
had been high up in the movement
which ousted the president.
"He was a very bitter opponent of
President Arias, and so the news of
the coup is naturally very pleasing
to me," he said.

election.
VERY HAPPY'
In commenting on the news from
his homeland, Arias said yesterday
in a telephone interview, "The news
from home makes me happy, not only
because my uncle is an opposition
leader and I am in sympathy with
the movement myself, but because
I know my people are behind it also.
. "The President has never had the
support of the Panamanian people;
all he had was power."
Arias said he knew the deposed
president personally, as well as his
successor, Adolpho De La Guardia.
"De La Guardia is a very good
man," he commented.
Not only has President Arias been
pro-Nazi, but the election in which
he defeated Arias' uncle for the
presidency had been a fraud, ac
cording to the Stanford student. He
recalled how his uncle along with
other opposition leaders had been
arrested on the day before the elec
tion.
ILLEGAL VOTING
"Then when the few people that
went to the polls opened their bal
lots, in most cases they found only
the names of the government candi
dates. The vote as announced gave
President Arias the election by
some 350,000 to 235 or thereabouts—
a total higher than the number of
voters in the country."
Arias said he had had no news
from Panama on the political situa
tion, but that he was sure his uncle
had been high up in the movement
which ousted the president.
"He was a very bitter opponent of
President Arias, and so the news of
the coup is naturally very pleasing
to me," he said.
As teletype machines throughout
the country yesterday recorded the
sensational news of the ousting of
Panama's pro-Nazi President Ar
nulfo Arias, Stanford's Panamanian
dramatic star Adolfo Arias answered
the question which popped immedi
ately into the minds of Stanfordites:
''No, I am n'o relation to Presi
dent Arias."
In fact, Arias, was has played the
lead in several Gaieties and other
student productions, is the nephew
of one of the ousted president's bit
terest political enemies — Francisco
Arias, former Panamanian minister
to the U.S. who ran against Presi
dent Arias in the last presidential
election.
