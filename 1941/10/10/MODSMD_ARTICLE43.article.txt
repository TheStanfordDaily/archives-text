### LAWRENCE S. HAAS 
Editor's note: The coup d'etat in
Panama marks one of the most sig
nificant developments in further
ance of hemispheric defense since
the Havana and Panama confer
ences, in the opinion of Lawrence S.
Haas, United Press Latin American
editor, for many years a resident of
Latin America, who explains his
opinion in the following dispatch.

United Press Latin American Editor
OCT. 9 (UP). —The coup d'etat in
Panama, in which the allegedly pro-
Axis President, Dr. Arnulfo Arias,
was supplanted by what appeai'ed to
be a pro-democratic regime, is of
tremendous significance to Panama
Canal defense and to the defense of
the Western Hemisphere as a whole.
Since the inauguration of Arias
on Oct. 1 of last year he has been a
thorn in the side of the United States
government, and what appeared to
be his pro-Axis leanings caused
constant concern in Washington.
DICTATORIAL
Elected for a four-year term, Pres
ident Arias, soon after his accession
to the presidency, assumed dicta
torial powers long enough to write
a new constitution and jam it
through the National Assembly—
Panama's legislature. The constitu
tion extended his term of office to
six years, and Arias then enacted
restrictive laws, among them one
that curbed the press.
That Arias administration held up
negotiations for acquisition of sites
in Panama outside the Canal Zone
for use as U.S. Army airfields, ob
servation and anti-aircraft posts for
the defense of the canal, and al
though such sites finally were
granted, they seemed to be given in
a grudging spirit.
YOUNGEST HEAD
Arias, who was 39 when inaugu
rated, was Panama's youngest Presi
dent. He had served his country
as minister to Italy, and even be
fore he was chosen as a presidential
candidate his political adversaries
charged that he had become imbued
with Fascist doctrines.
The Arias regime was ultra-na
tionalistic, and one of the practices
it put into effect was an insistence
that all conferences between Panama
officials and Canal Zone and United
States Army officials be conducted
in Spanish, although many Pana
manians speak excellent English.
Thus, army and civilian officials from
the Zone who spoke no Spanish were
rquired to bring interpreters to such
confex'ences.

granted, they seemed to be given in
a grudging spirit.
YOUNGEST HEAD
Arias, who was 39 when inaugu
rated, was Panama's youngest Presi
dent. He had served his country
as minister to Italy, and even be
fore he was chosen as a presidential
candidate his political adversaries
charged that he had become imbued
with Fascist doctrines.
The Arias regime was ultra-na
tionalistic, and one of the practices
it put into effect was an insistence
that all conferences between Panama
officials and Canal Zone and United
States Army officials be conducted
in Spanish, although many Pana
manians speak excellent English.
Thus, army and civilian officials from
the Zone who spoke no Spanish were
rquired to bring interpreters to such
confex'ences.
Editor's note: The coup d'etat in
Panama marks one of the most sig
nificant developments in further
ance of hemispheric defense since
the Havana and Panama confer
ences, in the opinion of Lawrence S.
Haas, United Press Latin American
editor, for many years a resident of
Latin America, who explains his
opinion in the following dispatch.

United Press Latin American Editor
OCT. 9 (UP). —The coup d'etat in
Panama, in which the allegedly pro-
Axis President, Dr. Arnulfo Arias,
was supplanted by what appeai'ed to
be a pro-democratic regime, is of
tremendous significance to Panama
Canal defense and to the defense of
the Western Hemisphere as a whole.
Since the inauguration of Arias
on Oct. 1 of last year he has been a
thorn in the side of the United States
government, and what appeared to
be his pro-Axis leanings caused
constant concern in Washington.
DICTATORIAL
Elected for a four-year term, Pres
ident Arias, soon after his accession
to the presidency, assumed dicta
torial powers long enough to write
a new constitution and jam it
through the National Assembly—
Panama's legislature. The constitu
tion extended his term of office to
six years, and Arias then enacted
restrictive laws, among them one
that curbed the press.
That Arias administration held up
negotiations for acquisition of sites
in Panama outside the Canal Zone
for use as U.S. Army airfields, ob
servation and anti-aircraft posts for
the defense of the canal, and al
though such sites finally were
granted, they seemed to be given in
a grudging spirit.
