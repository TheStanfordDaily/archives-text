Perry Patton, Northern California Secretary of (he American Field
Service, addressing the Luncheon Club at Stanford University last Wed
nesday, announced that the first California ambulance unit of 25 men had
been formed at the University of California and arrangements were now
being made at Washington for the organization to depart for service in

the Middle East with British troops..
Robert H. Hutchinson, founder of
the American Eagle Club in London
for 11,000 American volunteers in
the British civilian and military
services; Edward D. Kneass, '18, and
Walter Bruns, '19, former members
of Stanford ambulance units in the
World War, all took part in the
afternoon's discussion.
MANY JOURNALISTS
Many of the volunteers who served
in the last war were planning jour
nalistic careers and wished to be at
the source when news was break
ing, said Mr. Bruns, who served
with a Stanford ambulance unit in
the Balkans during the 1917 con
flict.
"We felt," he added, "that the
American Field Service was doing
a good job, the humanitarian type of
work challenged us, and here was
the wide world we were going to
get into later on.
"All of us today have the feeling
that we did a real job. I think every
one of us would say today that the
several years spent over there gave
us something in the way of an edu
cation, in the way of a challenge,

that was more than equal to the
time we lost from academic sub
jects."
