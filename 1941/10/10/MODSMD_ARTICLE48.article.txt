# Albees to Show Colored Movie Of Yukon Life
## Lecturer-Explorers Brought to Campus For Tuesday Series 
### 
The William Albees, adventurers
and lecturers, will bring their 60-
minute color film, "Family Afoot in
the Yukon Wilds," to the campus
for the next Tuesday Evening Series
program in Memorial Auditoiium
at 7:30.
Last year the Albee family, in
cluding Billy and Jo-Evelyn, aged
eight and five, were sent by the
National Geographic Society on a
three-month 300-mile trek, on foot,
into the uncharted territory on the
Yukon to make a film of family life
on the trail.
TRAVELED BY COMPASS
Tramping through the most unin
habited part of North America, the
Albee family traveled by compass,
hiked by day, and camped at night,
living on the 40 pounds of food they
carried with them and the wild
game they found in the uncharted
wilderness.
The film of family life on the
trail against a Northern backdrop
was photographed in turn by all
members of the family.
SOME HONEYMOON
The Albees will accompany their
film with a running commentary of
the trip. They are well acquainted
with the north country, having
walked to Alaska on their honey
moon by way of British Columbia
over a route that no white man be
fore them had been able to cross.
When they finally arrived at an
Eskimo village on the Bering Strait,
after having lived for months on
moose meat shot once a week, they
stayed there for five years. Their
book, "Alaska Challenge," was writ
ten during their stay.
The Tuesday Evening Series is
presented by the University and is
open to the public free of charge.
