# Freshmen Rally At S.P. Depot To Cheer Team
## Encina Men Gather To Transport Roble Women to Station 
### 
Marshaled behind the entire com
ponent of Encina's squad of Model |
T's (loaded to the eunwales with j
Roble pulchritude), the freshman
class tonight will stage a monster
train rally to send off the Papoose
gridders who will meet the U.S.C.
frosh tomorrow in Los Angeles.
According to the recently orga
nized freshman rally committee this
is the first such train rally ever
produced by a first year class. Ac
companied by the Stanford band
and yell leaders, the "T's for Vic
tory" procession will leave Encina
at 7, proceed to Roble, pick up the
"queens" and thence on to the Paly
station for the festivities.
NOVELTY PROMISED
To accompany their debut in the
field of x-ally holding, the '45 rally
committeemen promise something
novel in the way of a program be
tween the arrival of the procession
and train time which is 7:40.
The "piece de resistance" of the
program is the premiere performance
of a new yell novelty entitled "Syn
copation in Yells." This brain child
of the frosh committee, according to
their publicity release, is something
on the order of yells intermingled
with drum thumping followed by
more yells.
SHIPKEY TO SPEAK
Harry Shipkcy, head frosh football
coach, will make a brief talk out
lining the team's chances, hopes and
fears. The starting lineup will be
introduced and probably induced
by enthusiastic clasmates to "say
something."
All Robleites arc requested to
bring their pom-poms and all men
j to wear their rooters' caps.
