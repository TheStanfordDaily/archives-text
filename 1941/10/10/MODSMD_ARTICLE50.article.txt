# Indians Open Water Polo Here Today
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
With Stanford's gridders hunting j
for Beaver up north, the campus
sportlight shifts to the Farm water I
polo teams this week-end as they
open their 1941 season with a two
day stand here today and tomor
row.
Top contest is the Stanford-Olym- j
pic Club fracas, scheduled to start i
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30. It |
brings together one of the top teams [
in the United States, the Post
Streeters, and what is considered |
to be one of the best, if not the best, j
squad in Stanford's great aquatic I
history.
According to Coach Norton j
Thornton, a radio will be kept |
tuned to the Beaver-Indian football
game throughout the water polo
contest.
NO PUSHOVER
Today's game against Compton j
Junior College will by no means be
a pushover in view of a 9 to 8 de- I
feat of the powerful U.C.L.A. Bruins
two weeks ago.
Playing without the services of J
Art Bermudez, the Tartars dropped |
the first game of the series, 11 to 1.
With Bermudez, they edged the |
Bruins in a thrilling return contest. I
But the real battle will be on Sat- I
urday. Undefeated in three years,
the Olympic Club boasts a star- j
studded line-up of former All-Coast j
players, including Don Peterson.
Stanford '36; and Chuck Giffin, also |
Stanford '3G; at guard positions;
and Jim Shields, California '37, at
sprint. Two men from California's
powerful 1940 outfit, Dan Aranson at
forward and Winston Woodman at j
goalie, will see action against their
old rivals. •
Two Stanford positions, goalie i
and sprint, will be filled at game |
time, according to Thornton,
Captain Frank Mitchell, all-Con- ■
ference last year, and Jack Bleeker, j
rated his equal by Coach Nort, play j
the guard positions; veterans Had
ley Bacon and Fred Manwaring are)
at the forward jobs ("best in years,"
says Thornton); and big Bob Jones
is at centerback.
LETTERiVIEN RETURN
Four men, Bob Breckner and Ed j
Smith, both 1940 lettermen, transfer I
Bert Singer, and Pete Lee, stand out
from last year's freshman cham- |
pions, are waging a battle for the
important goalie position.
Starting at the sprint will be
either sharpshooting Bill Mapcl or
speedy Don Smith.
