## 
### 
Victory on a double front went into the annals of the Firehouse yes
terday when the siren winding- brethren dampened a tire at a ranch five
miles north of the Farm with considerable water and one hour later damp
ened the spirit of Phi Gamma Delta with considerable passing by Monte
Ffyl to win an intramural grid mix 7 to 0.

Thinking of lonely comrades
tling the blaze, the defending intra- ]

Stanford ending when Pfyl passed to l
brother Frank for the score with a
minute to go. Cripes converted.

a standstill most of the way, both

the machine. Fijis gained the same
epitaph, with Harms the backbone
of their stand.

the pass combination of Hopper to j
Barringer for a score, and 3W scored
on a pass from Champion to Brown
after a 75-yard run by Ferraggiro.
MED SCHOOL BEATEN
Sequoia won their second tilt of
the season with a 12 to 0 defeat of
Medical School 11. Randell passed to
Hendricks for the first, and Smith
caught another Randell bullet on a
25-yard sleeper play for the second.
Encina 3E forfeited a 1-0 victory
to Encina 4E, and the El Toro, Medi
cal School I tilt is postponed until
Monday.
Victory on a double front went into the annals of the Firehouse yes
terday when the siren winding- brethren dampened a tire at a ranch five
miles north of the Farm with considerable water and one hour later damp
ened the spirit of Phi Gamma Delta with considerable passing by Monte
Ffyl to win an intramural grid mix 7 to 0.

Thinking of lonely comrades
tling the blaze, the defending intra- ]
mural champions pulled an orthodox
Stanford ending when Pfyl passed to l
brother Frank for the score with a
minute to go. Cripes converted.
The Fijis fought the champions to
a standstill most of the way, both
teams lacking scoring punch in vital
moments. Firehouse had the ball j
within the Fiji 20-yard line several
times, but incomplete passes bogged
the machine. Fijis gained the same
epitaph, with Harms the backbone
of their stand.
KAPPA SKIS WIN
Wells of Kappa Sigma was too
much for Sigma Chi. He passed to
Reed for one score, ran the conver
sion, flipped a 30-yard sleeper to J
Heinze for the second counter, i
passed for the extra and ran 10 j
yards for the third score. Heinze j
converted to make the final 21 to 0.
Encina 4W followed the long end j
sweeps of back Hopper to a 7 to 6
overtime win from Encina 3W. The !
winners previously had produced [
the pass combination of Hopper to j
Barringer for a score, and 3W scored
on a pass from Champion to Brown
after a 75-yard run by Ferraggiro.
