SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 9 (UP).— !
: Matty Mathews, veteran coach of !
football at University of Portland,
; picks Washington State to defeat
| Washington, Montana to trim •
U.C.L.A., and Stanford to nose out j
1 Oregon State after a terrific battle in
Pacific Coast Conference football
| this week-end.
The reason we bring Matty into the
picture is that so far this season in '
essaying a new role of football prog- ;
nosticator Mathews has had excep- J
tional success — except for his in
ability to call them for his own !
team, the Portland Pilots.
Last week only two games got j
| away from Matty. One was the j
California-Washington State affair 1
won by Washington State in what
was the upset of the season. The
other was the Portland-Willamette
game in which Matty said his team
! should win. Willamette won, 25-0.
