A OACII CLARK SHAUGHNESSY and .i 5 of his red-hot gridders en
trained yesterday afternoon for the wilds of Corvallis, Ore., to see
what could do up in that part of the country about turning back this
threat b>f the Oregon State Beavers, who, because of their unexpected
victory over*-the Washington Huskies, are playing the role of "giant
killers." i
In the varsity's last home grounds practice before the game, Shaugh
nessy jumped on his high horse in no uncertain manner, giving evidence
that he holds plenty of respect for the Beavers.
As experienced as lie is, Shaughnessy still hasn't reached the point
of not getting excited about the games that his charges play. Those
who have seen him from vantage points claim that the "rags-to-riches"
mentor drinks great amounts of coffee in the dressing room before the
game and on some occasions gets so excited that he can't talk. The
guy's just so sincere in everything he says and does that if he told
you that you were the world's worst football player, you'd believe it.
And that's why no one'-s feelings are hurt when he goes on one of his
mild rampages on the practice field. Tlie.y know that he knows what he's
talking about and that everything he says or does is for the good of the
team.

Yesterday, for instance, he told
the first string secondary defense
that they were terrible.
"A good passer and a good re
ceiver would make touchdowns
against you in no time at all," he
shouted, as the reserves ran Ore
gon State pass plays while the first
string backs and line backers stood
dummy defense.
But then he worked them in such
a manner that by the time of the
game the chances are no passer or
receiver that the Beavers have will
be able to score at will, or at all, for
that matter.

TUST the other day we remarked
on how thorough the Card
coaching staff was. Further evidence
of that fact is in how much the In
dian gridders know about the op
ponents they are going to play.
They know who can pass and who
can't, who can kick and who can't,
and they vary their defense accord-

ingly. The scouting reports are responsible for that.
And the defenses they have are enough to drive a man mad trying
to learn them. But the whole thing pays off, if games won is any criterion.

I AST WEEK Luckie Louie wasn't in too good form, picking only two
winners out of five contests. U.S.C., Washington, and California let
him down.
However, the Pixley prognosticator came back again yesterday with this
week's picks. He says he's really been studying the situation and is pre
pared to go to town.
"It's Stanford over Oregon State, Washington over Washington
State, Oregon over U.S.C., Idaho over Gonzaga. Santa Clara over
California, and U.C.L.A. over Montana," says Luckie Louie.
