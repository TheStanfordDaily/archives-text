# Frosh Favored Over Troybabes
## Indians Risk Win Streak Tomorrow 
### 
"T"eeming wilh reserve strength J
at every position. Stanford's un- ,
beaten frosh gridders entrain to- |
night for Los Angeles and their game |
with the U.S.C. frosh at 11:30 a.m. |
tomorrow in the Memorial Coli
seum.
With a squad of 35 players, the |
yearlings are heavy favorites to keep [
their slate clean against the might i
of Troy. Usually in command of a |
great amount of high school and j
prep material, the Trobabes for once (
have not the potential strength and i
will be the underdogs.
Gus Shaver, former Trojan great,
now coaching the U.S.C. frosh, will |
rely on a power attack without much !
of the finesse and razzle-dazzle j
which characterizes Stanford's type '
of play.
SMOTHERED REEDLEY
The Shaverites rode roughshod
over Reedley J.C., 27-0, two weeks
ago, and in their two scrimmages
with the Trojan varsity, the Tro
babes came out second best, but not j
by a big margin.
The first-string frosh line of Frank ;
Snyder, Ken Donnelley, and Jim I
Strangland vying for end spots; A1
Ohanus and Paul Nelson, guards;
Jack Leavengood and Tom Bossert,
tackles; Otto Kilian and Joe Wolf
battling for center, is rapidly im
proving, but spots the Papooses 10
pounds.
Back at home, the Card frosh is
two deep at every position, and
naming the starters for tomorrow's
game will be tough for Coach Harry j
Shipkey.
WOODS vs. PATE
Battling for the call at full, Dave
Pate and Clem Woods went great
guns in practice yesterday after
noon. Bert Avery was giving Jim
Cowin a fight for left guard and
Harry Ferris, who started at tackle
against Long Beach, may outpoint
Bill Young, who was injured but is
now ready to go.
At center Jack McCurdy was back
in uniform again and will be a cinch
to play by next week, if not in to
morrow's game. In the meantime it's
Pete Brown at center with Frank
Moulton close behind.
In the backfield at halves are Fred
Parsons and Jim Pettit, with Can
non Parkinson at quarterback. The |
"big gun" will probably start in place I
of Bobby Andrews at the signal
calling position.
