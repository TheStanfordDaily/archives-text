# Stanford Soccer Team Plays U.S.F. in Opener Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team will open its season tomorrow at 10:33 a.m.
against a strong U.S.F. team on Maloney Field. Improving with each
practice, the Indian team is now a good working unit, according to Coach
Maloney, who has divided the squad into four teams which he has been
playing off against each other during the early practice sessions.

The combinations have been,
changed with every practice and ac
cording to the veteran soccer coach,
some good soccer has been played.
Today there will be a chalk talk at
the regular time, during which cap
tain for the team will be elected,
and the starting line-up will be
announced.
"The U.S.F. game will afford an
opportunity to see where the play
ers belong," Maloney said. "Al
though the squad has been working
out four times a week since the
beginning of school, the inter-school
competition will act as more of a
test to see the quality of the play
ers."
Last year the Stanford soccer
team tied with Cal for second place
in the Northern California Intercol
legiate Soccer League. San Jose
won first place by undefeated
throughout the season. Two Farm
players, Wilson Clark, center-half,
and George Doyle, forward, were on
the first all conrerence team. Full
backs Ned Pugh and Dick Harmon

made the second all-conference
team.
"I will ask a couple of teams to
suit-up and will use as many sub
stitutes as I can to get a line on
the players," said the coach.
Johnny Moore, an ex-Stanford j
soccerman and secretary of the
N.C.1.5.A., will act as referee for the j
match.
