j f kMAR KHAYYAM wrs at a complete loss if he didn't have "a loaf of
bread, a jug of wine, and thou" sitting around the house. All Pete
1 Kmetovic needs is:> broken field and one good blocker of the variety which
j is so abundant on the L..S.J.U. oval pelota team.
On the first of January in forty-one, quite a few men are still having
fun, who remember that famous day and year, of the broken field run of
Pete Revere (Kmet wouldn't rhyme).

j JTERE's the picture: alter Nebraska had held for downs on their 73-
inch line. Hopp kicked out to about the 50 to Kmet, who started off
j across the field; he was about to be cornered when Dick Palmer of the
j Oklahoma Dick Palmers tapped the would-be assailant in a manner that
j knocked him cold, figuratively and literally; while Kmet eluded 15 more
1 taeklers Richard Palmer of the Oklahoma Richard Palmers bowled over
I several more.

r |" I HIS scene has been repeated several times already this year only
since "Oklahoma Dickie" Palmer of the Palo Alto "Oklahoma Dickie"
Palmers didn't get around to staying in school the blocks only knock the
opposition off cheir feet.
Tomorrow, while listening to the game over the wireless, I'll be waiting
to hear the non-partisan roar of the assembled multitude (2,000) at Cor
vallis when Pete racks up C points by means of a low-gear romp down
the side stripe. When the going gets too tough Freddie Meyer will sneak
up and blast three players and one official with one tap.
