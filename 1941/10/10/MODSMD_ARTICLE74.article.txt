# Yuba Team Picked Over Menlo J.C.
## 
### 
Despiie their defeat last week by
San Mateo J.C., Menlo is definitely
a stronger team this year. To take
advantage of his light backfield,
Coach Walter Hpinceke (former All-
American center), has discarded his
.'herished Warner double-wing sys
tem, and Assistant Coach Jim Ver
dieck has been teaching the boys the
intricacies of the now-famous "T"
formation.
Yuba, featuring a heavy line and
m outstanding triple-threat back, is
considered a rugged defensive team.
Coach Jorgensen has built his of-
Lense around Tom Hickson, employ
ing an unbalanced line and man-in
motion. Yuba is a slight favorite,
but a Menlo win would not be an
upset.
