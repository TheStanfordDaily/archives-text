### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 9 (UP).â€”Jim
Crowley and 34 Fordham Rains en
trained today for the Southland
where on Saturday their still un
certain line gets a "bowl test" against
North Carolina.

improvement over last week's per
formance against Southern Metho
dist, it would seem that the Rams are
bound straight for one of the big
bowls. They have a wealth of bril
liant backs.
