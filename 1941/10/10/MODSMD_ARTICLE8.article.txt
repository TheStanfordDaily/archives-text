# Gridders Get Big Send-off
## Shaughnessy, Team Cheered at Station 
### 
One thousand Stanford rooters j
cheered Coach Clark Shaughnessy j
and his fighting Indians shortly af
ter the hour of 3 yesterday after
noon as the local chugged out of
the Paly station for parts north.
Linemen with scarred faces and
hands, evidence of the season's first
two tough gridiron encounters with
University of Oregon and U.C.L.A., j
climbed on the train with their
teammates. Many remarked their
boys are the "best-dressed college
football team in the country."
FASHION PREVIEW
It looked like a fall fashion pre
view. Smart tweed suits, slacks and
odd sport coats, smooth felt hats
with brims neatly angled—that's the
tough but gentlemanly Big Red Ma
chine. Hank Norberg, first-string
left end, is not on the traveling
squad due to an injured knee.
"The Corvallis game may be the
hottest game on the schedule,"
Coach Shaughnessy told the train
ralliers.
"The team is probably in a good
frame of mind," he said, stressing
the psychological angle. "At least, I
hope they are, because they'll have
to be that way to win," he added.
SHAUGHNESSY HOPEFUL
"If the boys come back victorious,
and I think they are going to, it
will be marvelous," he grinned.
An example of what makes a foot
ball team run, besides the necessary
correct psychology, was evidenced in
the several packing boxes loaded
into the baggage car with trunks
and other equipment. There were
crates of oranges and apples and
other necessaries thrown onto the
train as the team arranged them
selves in their seats for the over
night journey to Oregon State. They
will take a light workout tomorrow
afternoon in Corvallis.
