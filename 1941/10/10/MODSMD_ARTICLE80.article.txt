# Turnabout

### 
IN the busy little swirl of what we so proudly
hail as campus activities, the Y.W.C.A. has
always been a notable eddy.
Through the years, it has been one of the
few organized groups on the campus whose
scope has extended beyond the confines of
Palm Drive. Constructive and tangible aid to
migratory workers, relief for non-belligerents
in war areas and social service efforts directed
toward the needy in this immediate vicinity
have been among many worthy enterprises of
the "Y." Its workers are now actively partici
pating in the U.S.O. drive.
On and for the campus, the group has worked
unheralded but diligently. Many informative
discussion groups under "Y" auspices are avail
able to women. The sponsor system, now in
such effective and recognized service all over
the campus, was one of many brain children to
issue from the board room of the "Y."
To add to its fine record of achievements,
the "Y" does need financial support, and this
week—in a turnabout—it approaches women
on the campus with outstretched palm. In its
current finance drive, the "Y" offers one-year
membership for a nominal sum and, in order to
do away with the necessity of a second drive
later in the year, is receiving other voluntary
contributions. The drive will end on Tuesday.
It is to be hoped that women approached by
"Y" representatives will remember the bene
fits held out to them by this group and that they
will carry out the unbalanced turnabout by a
liberal crossing of this seldom outstretched
palm,—Rosemarie Mullany
