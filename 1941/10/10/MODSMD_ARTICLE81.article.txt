# From Dartmouth "Fences Down"
## 
### 
TO keep us from getting wrapped up in our
small little orbits of thought, The Daily feels
that the opinions of other college editors will
be of interest to students of Stanford.
The following is a front page editorial from
The Dartmouth, the oldest college newspaper
in America.
It it is possible to take even the smallest
measure of encouragement trom stories of
mass-murdering, then there is at least a little
heartening news tor us in the sanguinary
Nazi executions still going on in Czecho
slovakia.
Ot course, there is the bald fact that the
revolting Poles and Czechs, sniping and sabo
taging from the shadows, are creating for the
world the "second front" against Hitler which
we have refused to do, and which Britain has
rejected either because of Tory unwillingness
or because of strategic considerations.
But also there is something to make the jaw
stiffen in knowing that here are motley, plain
people who have sampled for three years the
Fascist life: the security, the efficiency, the
valve-regulated spontaneity, the laughing and
the loving rationed out systematically like the
butter or the meat. And they have revolted.
Their answer has been that there is more
good living in not living than there is in a
subdued and chronometric Nazi order.
It is uneguivocal. Living on a fence either
dulls a man's backbone or pricks it. This is
the answer, as staight and sincere as getting
shot in the stomach for what you believe.
A three-year sample. And because it is
true and searing and bloody, all our alterna
tives are wiped out. We have no choice. The
fences are down all over the world. The
flesh strains against the harness.
The answer is as homely as living and as
simple as dark red on brown.
