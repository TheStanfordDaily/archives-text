# Change of Pace

### 
LAST week, uncontrolled spirit got the better

But this week it's a different class entirely
which presents itself to the campus.
Though many of us might not .realize it since

Tonight Encinamen and Robleites will serpen

without any upperclass help. They have the
Stanford spirit.
Keep it up, frosh.
