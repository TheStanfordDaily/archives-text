one dollar, men, you can buy a book that will
give you the name and picture of every freshman
girl in Roble, and of the boys in Encina if you want
them. The book hasn't a name yet, but it has a pur
pose, that of helping the freshmen associate names
with faces. But. there is nothing that says upper
classmen can't buy one of the books as long as there
are any left. It is a good idea, and the book should
sell almost as well as Bawlouts or even like hotcakes.
And with the frosh women we have this year, the
price of a dollar is extremely cheap. Not since I have
been here have the women been so pretty. They are
gorgeous. Little brown-haired girls with tanned faces
and big eyes. Long, tall angels, round, cheerful blondes
and even a couple of small blacks.
And some of them have even gotten past the Rally
Committee, the Quad, the Chaparral and other pow
erful organizations and landed in the Daily shack. The
increase in the number of men around the paper has
been amazing. Reporters who left two years at*o for a
story and never returned, are finally getting back,
ready and eager for another assignment.
I don't know the cause for this sudden burst of
beauty. Maybe it's because the girls are no longer
wearing stockings. Maybe it's because it's still spring
around Stanford. Whatever it is, there are a lot of
pretty girls and one dollar is cheap for the book.
* * * *
And speaking of girls, I think I'll always remember
the sleepless night I spent after reading a story titled,
"Women Are Getting Taller." But now I find that the
article was true, women are getting taller, taller; men
are staying the same, the same, and I'm even shrink
ing a little, a little.

ITE: Would you like to dance now?
She (loud voice): You know that I'm a foot taller
than
He: Shut up. You don't have to holler it.
She: But you know it won't look nice.
He: Oh, that's all right. I don't like to rhumba
anyway.
She: That's right, you don't like to rhumba.
He: Yeah, but sometimes I do. I feel like it tonight.
She: Well, you could wear Cuban heels.
He: But I don't want to wear Cuban heels. All I
want to do is rhumba.
She: But you don't like to rhumba.
He: Tonight I do. Anyway, you could burn those
spectator pumps.
She: Yeah, and have my legs look bad.
He: You could go to hell.
She (screaming): John!
He: Yes.
She (crying): Take me home.

I don't know the cause for this sudden burst of
beauty. Maybe it's because the girls are no longer
wearing stockings. Maybe it's because it's still spring
around Stanford. Whatever it is, there are a lot of
pretty girls and one dollar is cheap for the book.

And speaking of girls, I think I'll always remember
the sleepless night I spent after reading a story titled,
"Women Are Getting Taller." But now I find that the
article was true, women are getting taller, taller; men
are staying the same, the same, and I'm even shrink
ing a little, a little.

He: Shut up. You don't have to holler it.
She: But you know it won't look nice.
He: Oh, that's all right. I don't like to rhumba
anyway.
She: That's right, you don't like to rhumba.
He: Yeah, but sometimes I do. I feel like it tonight.
She: Well, you could wear Cuban heels.
He: But I don't want to wear Cuban heels. All I
want to do is rhumba.
She: But you don't like to rhumba.
He: Tonight I do. Anyway, you could burn those
spectator pumps.
She: Yeah, and have my legs look bad.
He: You could go to hell.
She (screaming): John!
He: Yes.

one dollar, men, you can buy a book that will
give you the name and picture of every freshman
girl in Roble, and of the boys in Encina if you want
them. The book hasn't a name yet, but it has a pur
pose, that of helping the freshmen associate names
with faces. But. there is nothing that says upper
classmen can't buy one of the books as long as there
are any left. It is a good idea, and the book should
sell almost as well as Bawlouts or even like hotcakes.
And with the frosh women we have this year, the
price of a dollar is extremely cheap. Not since I have
been here have the women been so pretty. They are
gorgeous. Little brown-haired girls with tanned faces
and big eyes. Long, tall angels, round, cheerful blondes
and even a couple of small blacks.
And some of them have even gotten past the Rally
Committee, the Quad, the Chaparral and other pow
erful organizations and landed in the Daily shack. The
increase in the number of men around the paper has
been amazing. Reporters who left two years at*o for a
story and never returned, are finally getting back,
ready and eager for another assignment.
