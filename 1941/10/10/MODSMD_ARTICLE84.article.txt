THAT USKD-BOOK QUESTION

r FHE EDITOR. SIR:
Mr. Silverman's fair and thoughtful editorial with
regard to the record of the Bookstore during the past
year was more than appreciated by those of us who
have responsibility for the store's policies. Naturally
we do hope that we have taken care of many of the
gripes that students and faculty have had in the past;
and we are anxious to do all we can to take care of
further gripes as they appear.
This brings up the very difficult matter of second
hand books. We have given a lot of attention Xo this
matter, and have made several changes in policy in
recent years that have worked out rather well. But
it's still a sore question.
The principal complaints arc: (1) that we do not
pay enough for used books, (2) that, we charge too
much for used books, and (3) that we do not have an
adequate supply of such books to meet the demand.
Now, what we can pay for used books in cash
must depend upon (a) what we can sell the book for,
and (b) the "mark-up" to cover our expenses on the
transaction. One way of increasing our buying price,
and thus meet complaint number one, is to increase
our selling price at the same time—but this obviously
would simply increase complaints of the number two
variety. Similarly, if we were to attempt to meet com
plaint number two by reducing our buying price so as
to make possible a reduction in selling price, this
would only increase complaints of the number one
variety. Clearly the mark-up is the crux of the mat
ter, so far as the first two complaints arc concerned.
The mark-up must be sufficient, to cover the cost
of handling the book in two transactions, the cost of
storage, the risk of not being able to sell the book at all,
and the transactions' share of accounting costs, taxes,
insurance, rent and other elements of overhead for the
store as a whole. If we operated in rent-free quarters,
used largely volunteer workers, and had no taxes to
pay, we could reduce this mark-up substantially. As
it is. we have reduced the mark-up on used books con
siderably below that of bookstores generally. The text
book department (both new and used books) now does
little more than break even for a number of very
good reasons for which there is not space here. (But
it is not true that the new book business is subsi
dized by the used book business done.) To reduce the
mark-up further would mean that this department
would run at a loss—and second-hand book buyers
and sellers among the students would in effect then
be subsidized by other students through reduced re
bates all along the line.
One tip I can give: if a student has a used book
that he wants to sell, he can get a much higher price
for it if he sells it to the Bookstore immediately be
fore it is to be used again by some class. Olherwise
we have to buy it at a much lower price because of
the possibility that the book may not be used again
.locally and consequently may have to be sold for
almost nothing to one of the large dealers.
The third complaint mentioned abnve—that we do
not carry a large enough stock of used books—arises
from the fact that the publishers of new books with
whom we must deal do not permit us to "import" used
textbooks. Along with other college bookstores we
have been fighting against this prohibition for a long
lime—bvit thus far without success. Unfortunately the
publishers have upper hand in the situation.
We welcome any suggestion that members of the
student body can give us with regard to any aspect
of this whole problem of second-hand hooks,

THAT USKD-BOOK QUESTION

r FHE EDITOR. SIR:
Mr. Silverman's fair and thoughtful editorial with
regard to the record of the Bookstore during the past
year was more than appreciated by those of us who
have responsibility for the store's policies. Naturally
we do hope that we have taken care of many of the
gripes that students and faculty have had in the past;
and we are anxious to do all we can to take care of
further gripes as they appear.
This brings up the very difficult matter of second
hand books. We have given a lot of attention Xo this
matter, and have made several changes in policy in
recent years that have worked out rather well. But
it's still a sore question.
The principal complaints arc: (1) that we do not
pay enough for used books, (2) that, we charge too
much for used books, and (3) that we do not have an
adequate supply of such books to meet the demand.
Now, what we can pay for used books in cash
must depend upon (a) what we can sell the book for,
and (b) the "mark-up" to cover our expenses on the
transaction. One way of increasing our buying price,
and thus meet complaint number one, is to increase
our selling price at the same time—but this obviously
would simply increase complaints of the number two
variety. Similarly, if we were to attempt to meet com
plaint number two by reducing our buying price so as
to make possible a reduction in selling price, this
would only increase complaints of the number one
variety. Clearly the mark-up is the crux of the mat
ter, so far as the first two complaints arc concerned.
The mark-up must be sufficient, to cover the cost
of handling the book in two transactions, the cost of
storage, the risk of not being able to sell the book at all,
and the transactions' share of accounting costs, taxes,
insurance, rent and other elements of overhead for the
store as a whole. If we operated in rent-free quarters,
used largely volunteer workers, and had no taxes to
pay, we could reduce this mark-up substantially. As
it is. we have reduced the mark-up on used books con
siderably below that of bookstores generally. The text
book department (both new and used books) now does
little more than break even for a number of very
good reasons for which there is not space here. (But
it is not true that the new book business is subsi
dized by the used book business done.) To reduce the
mark-up further would mean that this department
would run at a loss—and second-hand book buyers
and sellers among the students would in effect then
be subsidized by other students through reduced re
bates all along the line.
One tip I can give: if a student has a used book
that he wants to sell, he can get a much higher price
for it if he sells it to the Bookstore immediately be
fore it is to be used again by some class. Olherwise
we have to buy it at a much lower price because of
the possibility that the book may not be used again
.locally and consequently may have to be sold for
almost nothing to one of the large dealers.
The third complaint mentioned abnve—that we do
not carry a large enough stock of used books—arises
from the fact that the publishers of new books with
whom we must deal do not permit us to "import" used
textbooks. Along with other college bookstores we
have been fighting against this prohibition for a long
lime—bvit thus far without success. Unfortunately the
publishers have upper hand in the situation.

The third complaint mentioned abnve—that we do
not carry a large enough stock of used books—arises
from the fact that the publishers of new books with
whom we must deal do not permit us to "import" used

publishers have upper hand in the situation.
We welcome any suggestion that members of the
student body can give us with regard to any aspect
of this whole problem of second-hand hooks,
