"Drink to Yesterday" and U A
Toast to Tomorrow," by Manning
Coles, published by the Literary
Guild of America. Inc.
Manning Coles is actually two peo
ple: a woman, Adelaide Manning,
who served in the British War Of
fice during the first World War, and
Cyril Henry Coles, holder of three
years' experience in the British In
telligence.
Their collaboration on these two
books was for the purpose of writ
ing a spy story debunking the popu
lar conception of this type of story.
SPY IN GERMANY
The first book, "Drink to Yes
terday, is filled with thrills and
suspense stemming from the position
of a British spy in Germany during
the first world conflict, and the dif
ficulties of maintaining two outlooks
at the same time, one for the Ger
mans and one for his comrades.
Working his way into the inner
circle of the German military, the
hero, Bill Saunders, risks his neck to
foul German plans.
WOMEN UNDO HERO
Besides his spy activities. Saun
ders marries an English girl while
at home on leave and falls in love
with a German girl while in Ger
man character. These two eventually
result in his undoing.
The characters are completely
real, commonplace individuals that
the average person might meet in
his daily contacts rather than mys
terious, untouchable super-beings
bearing some sort of charmed life.
SAME CHARACTERISTICS
This second novel, "Toast to To
morrow," literally brings some of
the principal characters of the first
back from the dead and involves
them in even more exciting adven
tures .Suffering from a blow on the
head, the hero, Tommy Hambledon,
recovers his memory to realize that
he is the chief of police under the
Nazi regime.
With this made-to-order oppor
tunity to be of service to the British
Intelligence, he keeps just beyond
the clutches of Goering long enough
to undermine the* Reich by burning
the hall of records.
The touchy situation is kept from
being too serious by clever use of the
subtle humor so typical of the Brit
ish temperament. Both of these
stories are worth reading if you like
realistic narrative involving human
characters.â€”Craig
