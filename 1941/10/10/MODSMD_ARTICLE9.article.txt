## Germans Claim Russ Campaign Outcome Is Already Decided 
### 
MOSCOW. Friday, Oct. 10 (UP).— |
German blitzkrieg armies, bent on
knocking Russia out of the war be
fore promised British and American
aid arrives, have been stopped at the
outskirts of Vyazma, 130 miles south
west of the capital, just off the broad
Minsk-to-Moscow highway that
Marked Napoleon's invasion route,
war dispatches claimed today.
The great offensive, into which
Adolf Hitler hurled 200 divisions —
3,01)0,000 men—including tremendous
mechanized forces, raged along a
2,000-mile battle front but the Ger
mans made their supreme effort in
the region of Vyazma, once a
rambling country town of two-story
wood and stucco buildings that is
now a shambles.
NAZIS PUSHED BACK
Front dispatches said the Germans
had been beaten back in several
rushes at Vyasma.
The desperate nature of the fight
ing there was indicated in reports of
(he encirclement of Soviet detach
ments commanded by Gen. Ivan
Boldin who, early in July was en
circled with his division near Minsk
and remained for 45 days behind
the German lines before he fought
through them to join the main So

army before large scale supplies of

stroy the Allies before the United
[ States could land effective aid in
j France. It was believed that Hitler
is trying now to break up the Red
