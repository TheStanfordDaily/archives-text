### AMIE REICHERT 
JJRITISH war policy is getting all
horsed up and nobody is more
confused these days than the Cabi
net.
Take the case of Mr. Arthur
Greenwood, minister without port
folio. Mr. Greenwood is an athlete.
He jumps fences. Yesterday he
jumped over to the side and then
back again so fast that if he doesn't
watch it he may lose more than the
portfolio which he hasn't got.
Mr. Greenwood said it was all a
slip of the tongue. Or maybe a
slip of the microphone. Anyway,
he never never said such a thing,
it's all a dreadful mistake.
What Mr. Greenwood didn't say
was this: "We will give our men
until it hurts."
* * *
r JpHIS man is a member of Britain's
inner war cabinet and that last
remark, which he didn't make, was
quoted in British newspapers with
direct reference to aid to Russia.
Everybody got very excited and
all the London editor rolled lip
their sleeves and started typing
extravagant editorials with hold
face headlines like "Timoshenko,
We Are Coming," or "Oh. to Be in
Russia Now That Hitler's There."
But then Mr. Greenwood said it
was mike fright or a bad circuit or
indigestion and a very big mistake.
What Mr. Greenwood said he said
was this: "We are giving of our ma
terial sources, and we shall give of
them until it hurts."
Then everybody got angry and
confused and all the London editors
rolled down their sleeves and went
back to cutting paper dolls and
drinking tea with canned milk.
* * *
incident itself is unimportant.
But, it seems to me that it is
at the same time a symptom of the
confusion and general fuddle-duddle
atmosphere around foggy, foggy
London.
On the face of it, it would ap
pear that if there is anything
worse to an Englishman than de
claring war, it is going ahead and
fighting.
The British have been hemming
and hawing for two weeks now about
this invasion business—just the way
they hemmed and hawed in 1938
and 1939 about this Hitler business.
Maybe the fog around 10 Downing
Street is so thick these days that
Prime Minister Churchill can't see
what's going on. Maybe he doesn't
know that Uncle Joe Stalin is down
for the count, that the British press
is clamoring for action, spelled i-n
-v-a-s-i-o-n.
At any rate, Churchill is being
strangely silent at a time when
the air is charged with a question
which only he can answer.
He lets men like Poor Arthur
Greenwood do the talking and the
result is a little sad and awfully
funny too.
* * *
an army in Britain that
doesn't know where it's going,
or even if it's going, or how it can
go, or who's going to lead the party.
And this is the army that all the
arguing, is about.
But there Is an army in India
that numbers a million and is
growing at the rate of 50,000 re
cruits a month. This is an army
that lias a formidable leader in the
person of Archibald Wavcll. And
this is the army that no one is
talking about.
Britain also has an army in Iran,
just over the Russian Caucasian
border, and a jump away from In
dia.
Britain wants to create a new front
to take the pressure of! the Russians,
yes?
Those boys in India need exercise,
no?
Well . . . ?

an army in Britain that
doesn't know where it's going,
or even if it's going, or how it can
go, or who's going to lead the party.
And this is the army that all the
arguing, is about.
But there Is an army in India
that numbers a million and is
growing at the rate of 50,000 re
cruits a month. This is an army
that lias a formidable leader in the
person of Archibald Wavcll. And
this is the army that no one is
talking about.
Britain also has an army in Iran,
just over the Russian Caucasian
border, and a jump away from In
dia.
Britain wants to create a new front
to take the pressure of! the Russians,
yes?
Those boys in India need exercise,
no?
Well . . . ?
JJRITISH war policy is getting all
horsed up and nobody is more
confused these days than the Cabi
net.
Take the case of Mr. Arthur
Greenwood, minister without port
folio. Mr. Greenwood is an athlete.
He jumps fences. Yesterday he
jumped over to the side and then
back again so fast that if he doesn't
watch it he may lose more than the
portfolio which he hasn't got.
Mr. Greenwood said it was all a
slip of the tongue. Or maybe a
slip of the microphone. Anyway,
he never never said such a thing,
it's all a dreadful mistake.
What Mr. Greenwood didn't say
was this: "We will give our men
until it hurts."
* * *
r JpHIS man is a member of Britain's
inner war cabinet and that last
remark, which he didn't make, was
quoted in British newspapers with
direct reference to aid to Russia.
Everybody got very excited and
all the London editor rolled lip
their sleeves and started typing
extravagant editorials with hold
face headlines like "Timoshenko,
We Are Coming," or "Oh. to Be in
Russia Now That Hitler's There."
But then Mr. Greenwood said it
was mike fright or a bad circuit or
indigestion and a very big mistake.
What Mr. Greenwood said he said
was this: "We are giving of our ma
terial sources, and we shall give of
them until it hurts."
Then everybody got angry and
confused and all the London editors
rolled down their sleeves and went
back to cutting paper dolls and
drinking tea with canned milk.
* * *
incident itself is unimportant.
But, it seems to me that it is
at the same time a symptom of the
confusion and general fuddle-duddle
atmosphere around foggy, foggy
London.
On the face of it, it would ap
pear that if there is anything
worse to an Englishman than de
claring war, it is going ahead and
fighting.
The British have been hemming
and hawing for two weeks now about
this invasion business—just the way
they hemmed and hawed in 1938
and 1939 about this Hitler business.
Maybe the fog around 10 Downing
Street is so thick these days that
Prime Minister Churchill can't see
what's going on. Maybe he doesn't
know that Uncle Joe Stalin is down
for the count, that the British press
is clamoring for action, spelled i-n
-v-a-s-i-o-n.
At any rate, Churchill is being
strangely silent at a time when
the air is charged with a question
which only he can answer.
He lets men like Poor Arthur
Greenwood do the talking and the
result is a little sad and awfully
funny too.

The British have been hemming
and hawing for two weeks now about
this invasion business—just the way
they hemmed and hawed in 1938
and 1939 about this Hitler business.
Maybe the fog around 10 Downing
Street is so thick these days that
Prime Minister Churchill can't see
what's going on. Maybe he doesn't
know that Uncle Joe Stalin is down
for the count, that the British press
is clamoring for action, spelled i-n
-v-a-s-i-o-n.
At any rate, Churchill is being
strangely silent at a time when
the air is charged with a question
which only he can answer.
He lets men like Poor Arthur
Greenwood do the talking and the
result is a little sad and awfully
funny too.

an army in Britain that
doesn't know where it's going,
or even if it's going, or how it can
go, or who's going to lead the party.
And this is the army that all the
arguing, is about.
But there Is an army in India
that numbers a million and is
growing at the rate of 50,000 re
cruits a month. This is an army
that lias a formidable leader in the
person of Archibald Wavcll. And
this is the army that no one is
talking about.
Britain also has an army in Iran,
just over the Russian Caucasian
border, and a jump away from In
dia.
Britain wants to create a new front
to take the pressure of! the Russians,
yes?
Those boys in India need exercise,
no?
Well . . . ?
