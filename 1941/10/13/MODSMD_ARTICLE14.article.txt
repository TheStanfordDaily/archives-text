# Wilson Culls for Scripts, Songs As Deadlines Near
## 
### 
With the script and song deadlines closing in upon him, Ash Wilson,
director of this year's Big Game Gaieties, is asking that all writers and
composers complete their work as soon as possible and hand in the finished
products to Bill Moran, dramatic manager.
/ Today is the song deadline, while the last day to turn in scripts is

Wednesday. Chief Gaieties
Wilson is hoping that more scripts !
than have already been turned in j
will be submitted by the date of the
script deadline, because there has
been a particularly small amount of I
material turned in so far in this line, j
Director Wilson further urges that !
writers need not he bashful about
submitting their work.
The musical portion of the Gaieties
seems to be pretty well set, accord
ing to Wilson. Lots of songs and
words have been thus far turned in
and this material seems to be of high
quality. This, however, does not *
mean that anything good cannot be
used because, if it meets Gaieties J
standards, a top-notch tune can al- j
ways be used.
Helping Director Wilson shape the i
whole show up are Norman Ross and |
John Laurie. Ross is whipping out
skits and Laurie is aiding in the
show's musical angles.
If his schedule works out as he
has planned it, Wilson hopes to an- i
nounce his first tryouts for positions !
in the Gaieties cast about October ]
20. Exact tryout dates will be pub- i
lished later in The Daily.
