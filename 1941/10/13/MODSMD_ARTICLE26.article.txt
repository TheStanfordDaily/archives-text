# Beavers Upset Indian 'T' 10-0
## Kmetovic's Injury, Breaks and Mud Help Snap 13 Game Winning Streak 
### CHUCK SMITH 
(Special to The Stanford Daily)
BELL FIELD, CORVALIJS, Ore., Oct. 11.—Well, it finally arrived—
tliat day we knew in our hearts was coming eventually.
That day when newspapers across the country would thunder the news
of the first defeat of a Shaughnessy coached Stanford team.
It was Oregon State 10-0 over Stanford under a dreary, grey Oregon

sky and on the soggy treacherous
turf of Bell Field, Corvallis.
You all know by now how the
scores were made, who did the pass
ing, how the statistics looked; I
think you'd rather know how your
ball club took its first defeat in 13
games.
You'd have been proud of your
ball club last Saturday. If you'd
have seen them in there pitching to
the end. I'm being Joe College when
I say they literally "played their
hearts out."
It took me 15 minutes to get into
the locker room after the final gun,
and yet most of those first-stringers
were still sitting partially dressed in

the locker room, too darn tired to
pull off their muddy togs.
They went down scrapping to the
very end in the hardest rock-and
sock ball game the northwest has
ever seen.
And they were as gracious in their
defeat as they ever were in all their
string of victories. They were quick
to praise those hard charging, out
for-upset Beavers and refused to say
that an uncertain field and a slip
pery ball made the difference be
tween the teams. .
LOSS HARD TO TAKE
Saturday's loss was hard to take,
but it certainly made better men
and as you'll see a better football
team out of your ball club.
As for Coach, Coach Clark, lie
summed things up in a very real
istic way much better than I could.
First of all, he said Oregon State
was the better team out there Sat
urday and that it won accordingly.
Yes, your coach knows how to take
a setback graciously also.
Shaughnessy in a matter-of-fact
way listed four factors in his team's
defeat in this order of importance—•
the hard charge of the Beaver line,
the loss of Pete Kmetovic when the
game was only 7 minutes old, the
650-mile trip to Corvallis and the
wet field.
The Northwest will not soon for-
get last Saturday, the victory of their
favorite sons; nor will they forget
those Cards which still looked like
All-Americans in their defeat.
Proof that the northerns feared
and respected Albert, Taylor and
Co. was the fact that they would
start: chanting "hold that line" when
the Cards were in possession even as
far out as their own 40-yard line.
But that loss Saturday, as hard as
it was for team, coach, alumni, and
rooters to take, is not fatal.
Remember, your Cards are in the
toughest league in the country and
that they are still definitely in that
race for the Rose Bowl.
To say that they are going to
"bounce back" from this defeat is
an understatement. They know
now, more than ever, how much it
means to win and they're going to
be more of a winning ball club from
n>w on in because of what hap
pened Saturday out there on Bell
Field.

was the better team out there Sat
urday and that it won accordingly.
Yes, your coach knows how to take
a setback graciously also.
Shaughnessy in a matter-of-fact
way listed four factors in his team's
defeat in this order of importance—•
the hard charge of the Beaver line,
the loss of Pete Kmetovic when the
game was only 7 minutes old, the
650-mile trip to Corvallis and the
wet field.
The Northwest will not soon for-
get last Saturday, the victory of their
favorite sons; nor will they forget
those Cards which still looked like
All-Americans in their defeat.
Proof that the northerns feared
and respected Albert, Taylor and
Co. was the fact that they would
start: chanting "hold that line" when
the Cards were in possession even as
far out as their own 40-yard line.
But that loss Saturday, as hard as
it was for team, coach, alumni, and
rooters to take, is not fatal.
Remember, your Cards are in the
toughest league in the country and
that they are still definitely in that
race for the Rose Bowl.
To say that they are going to
"bounce back" from this defeat is
an understatement. They know
now, more than ever, how much it
means to win and they're going to
be more of a winning ball club from
n>w on in because of what hap
pened Saturday out there on Bell
Field.
(Special to The Stanford Daily)
BELL FIELD, CORVALIJS, Ore., Oct. 11.—Well, it finally arrived—
tliat day we knew in our hearts was coming eventually.
That day when newspapers across the country would thunder the news
of the first defeat of a Shaughnessy coached Stanford team.
It was Oregon State 10-0 over Stanford under a dreary, grey Oregon

sky and on the soggy treacherous
turf of Bell Field, Corvallis.
You all know by now how the
scores were made, who did the pass
ing, how the statistics looked; I
think you'd rather know how your
ball club took its first defeat in 13
games.
You'd have been proud of your
ball club last Saturday. If you'd
have seen them in there pitching to
the end. I'm being Joe College when
I say they literally "played their
hearts out."
It took me 15 minutes to get into
the locker room after the final gun,
and yet most of those first-stringers
were still sitting partially dressed in

the locker room, too darn tired to
pull off their muddy togs.
They went down scrapping to the
very end in the hardest rock-and
sock ball game the northwest has
ever seen.
And they were as gracious in their
defeat as they ever were in all their
string of victories. They were quick
to praise those hard charging, out
for-upset Beavers and refused to say
that an uncertain field and a slip
pery ball made the difference be
tween the teams. .
LOSS HARD TO TAKE
Saturday's loss was hard to take,
but it certainly made better men
and as you'll see a better football
team out of your ball club.
As for Coach, Coach Clark, lie
summed things up in a very real
istic way much better than I could.
First of all, he said Oregon State
was the better team out there Sat
urday and that it won accordingly.
