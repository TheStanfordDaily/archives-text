# Excom Plans Open Forum For Oct. 29
## Student Activities To Be Explained By Prominent Speakers 
### 
To lay plans for (ho Activities
Forum, scheduled by Ex Conimtilec
tor October 25), a committee beaded
by Pat Adams met Friday afternoon
in the A.S.S.U. room of the Old
Union.
Chairman Pat Adams reviewed
the problems which have surrounded
Farm activities for many years and
outlined how the forum hopes to
clear up this situation. "Too many
activities are entirely too vague and
this forum hopes to clear this up,"
she said.
The program is designed for three
classes of Stanford people. First,
those interested in student activities,
second to help the new officers and
third for the freshman.
Not all the speakers have been
contacted yet but those already
chosen are Bones Hamilton, who
will speak on "Alumni and Their
Relation to Us," and A1 Masters,
who will discuss "The B.A.C. and
What It Does for Us."
Informality is the theme of the
entire program with the speakers
answering questions about activities
and what they can do for those in
terested in them after their various
short speeches.
