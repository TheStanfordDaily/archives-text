## American Warship Bringing Prisoners For 'Examination' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UP).—
Official silence tonight shielded fur
ther developments on the seizure by
U.S. naval forces of some 20 Nazi
prisoners who set up a secret radio
station in Greenland.

The Navy Department said it has
nothing "at present" to add to its
original announcement that the radio
outpost has been "disposed of" and
that an American warship is bring
ing the prisoners, including an agent
of the German Gestapo and a group
of Norwegian quislings, to a United
States port for "examination."
The State Department had no com
ment. Neither did the German em
bassy, where a spokesman said that
"all we know is what we read in
the newspapers." This spokesman
"doubted very much" that Germany
would make diplomatic representa
tions, but hastily added that "what
ever there is will come from the
other side (Berlin)."
Where and when the prisoners
will be landed, what will be done
with them and what repercussions—
if any—will stem from the seizure
were questions which officially went
unanswered for the moment.
