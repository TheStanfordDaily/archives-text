# Farm Soccermen Deadlock U.S.F.
## 
### 
Efficient work by goalies of both
teams in a hard - fought match
brought a 0-0 score in Saturday's
soccer match between Stanford and
the University of San Francisco, an
outcome marred by the leg fracture
incurred by a U.S.F. man in the
second quarter.
A1 Wool and Co-captains Jack
Burns and Ed Johnson turned in
t.ood performances for the Indians.
The Stanford squad had two scoring
chances in the last period, but poor
, ussing stopped their attack.
Stanford's next game is scheduled
with the sailors from British ships
; nchored at Mare Island.
