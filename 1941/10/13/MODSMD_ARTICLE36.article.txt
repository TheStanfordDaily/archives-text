# Coach Clark Picks Ducks To Win P.C.C.
## 
### BILL DILLINGER 
Speaking over a nationwide hook
up on the program "Second-Guess
ers" Sunday morning, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy put himself out on a
limb in favor of Oregon University.
Commenting on the showing made
by the University of Texas against
Oklahoma, he predicted that Texas
would be the team to watch in the
Southwest Conference, and added
that the game scheduled between
Oregon and Texas in December
might well turn out to be a game
between the champion of the Pa
cific Coast Conference and the
champ of the Southwest.
Asked about his own team's de
feat at the hands of the Beavers,
Shaughnessy stressed the fact that
his boys had played a very fine
game. He especially lauded the
sixty-minute performances of Art:
Meiners and Fred Meyers, the Stan
ford ends, and the fine play of Pete
Kmetovic.
He placed partial blame for the
Indians' defeat on the totally un
expected stellar showing of Oregon
State's fullback "Choc" Shelton and
quarterback George Peters. The
Stanfords had prepared for O.S.C.'s
passing aces, right-hander Bob
Dethman and port-sider Don Dur
dan, but the Corvallismen's four
star backfield was a little more than
the Farm team could handle.
"What was Oregon State's defense
for the "T?" Coach Clark was ased.
"Find out from Stiner," was his
answer.
