# Ken Smith Adopts News Style In First Fall Alumni Review
## 
### 
From Chappie's Old Boy to edi
tor and publisher of the "Illustrated
Review" —that's the promotion Ken
Smith got for a graduation gift this
summer.
First issue of his publication will
be off the presses next week under
the new title of ''Stanford Alumni
Review." Make-up will be changed
from a feature style to a depart
mentalized news magazine.
"You can tell my readers that I've
worked black, blue, yellow, and pur
pic in the face trying to get this
thing finished," Ken said.
To simplify matters for Ken,
former Editor Leslie Squires went
on a honeymoon in Honolulu as soon
as he vacated his job. So Ken
learned the ropes all on his own
hook.
"I'm really not a publisher in
spite of the little white card on my
door," Ken explained. "In the first

place, I haven't got a dime invested
in this business. And in the second
place, I don't want to get sued for
anything that goes into this maga
zine."
Special emphasis will be laid on
notes from alumni under SmithSs
editorship.
"Most of our readers are primarily
interested in information as to what
the members of their class at Stan
ford are doing now," Ken said.
"Much of thsi material has been
mailed to me by the alums them
selves for the anniversary issue."
Football and the Fiftieth Anniver
sary celebrations will highlight
next week's edition of the Stanford
Alumni Review. Notes about fac
ulty, alumni, and students will run
under various departmental head
ings such as sports, radio, drama,
and press.
