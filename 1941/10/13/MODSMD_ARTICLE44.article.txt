r rHEY went and did it, those big Beavers from Oregon State College did!
They took a Stanford team that was seeking its 13th consecutive
victory under the guidance of Clark D. Shaughnessy, roughed it up a
bit, and sent it home a vanquished team.
How did they do it? And what does the defeat mean to Stanford's
Rose Bowl hopes? Those are questions that have been going the rounds
since about 5 o'clock Saturday.
The main answer to question number one is this: Lon Stiner's Oregon
Staters outplayed Clark Shaughnessy's Stanfords. To be sure, we weren't
there, but that was the case or else the great majority of those present at
the toppling got the wrong idea.
But there's another item that was undoubtedly a lai'ge factor in the
outcome. "Skeeter" Peter Kmetovic, Stanford's outstanding running threat
and probably the most consistent ground gainer in Pacific Coast football,
went out of action before the Indians really got in a position to attack.
Without Kmetovic the Big Red Machine isn't the same. Everyone has
said that all along, prophesying what would happen if Frankie Albert or
Kmetovic couldn't play. But no one knew it was going to happen so soon.
Bob Mitchell and A1 Cole subbed for Kmet, but they just couldn't fill his
shoes. Even if they were every bit as gcod as runners and as pass re
ceivers as Kmetovic, the fact that they haven't the great reputation he has
would cut down their effectiveness as decoys. And that makes a lot of
difference in whether the Indians roll or don't roll.

There are undoubtedly a number
of other things that entered into
Stanford's loss to the "giant killing"
Beavers, who only a week before
knocked the great University of
Washington out of the running, but
it really doesn't make a great deal
of difference now that it is all over.
The problem now. as far as the
Stanford gridders are concerned, is
to keep from allowing any more oc
currences, the likes of which re
semble Saturday's.
* * *
the Big Red Machine still
have a chance to be playing in
the Rose Bowl come January 1,
1942?
Sure it has!
The conference standings at the
present time look like this:
Won Lost
Stanford 2 1
Oregon 2 1
Oregon State 2 1
U.C.L.A 2 1
U.S.C 11
Washington 11
Washington State 1 2
California 0 1
Idaho 0 1
Montana 0 1
Stanford has played every team
that is tied with it for the top spot.
But the other three teams haven't

met each other, which makes it imperative that somebody knocks some
body else out of the race.
Still remaining on the Indians' schedule are U.S.F., Washington, Santa
Clara, U.S.C., W.S.C., and California in that order. There are two partic
ular toughies in that set-up: Santa Clara and the U. of W. The others
aren't pushovers.
Although the Broncs aren't a conference outfit, it is doubtful if the
conference would send an outfit to the Rose Bowl if that team had been
defeated twice, or more. So it looks as if Clark Shaughnessy's boys are
definitely under pressure from now on in.
0.5.C., unfortunately, has played the hardest part of its schedule al
ready, having met and defeated the Huskies and the Cards. But there's no
telling where the Beavers may be upset. After all, Sam Barry's U.S.C.
Trojans turned the trick once and it could happen again. Oregon, at the
present time, appears to be the most logical candidate to pull the stunt.
But then some team is going to have to beat the Ducks again, if Stanford
is going to wind up as sole possessor of the number one spot when the
dust has settled on the 1941 Pacific Coast Conference grid campaign.
Washington and U.S.C. are still in the running, too. All of which makes
it a rather mixed up affair.
Luckie Louie did a little better this week, picking five winners out of
six contests. Stanford's loss kept it from being a perfect day for the
Pixley prognosticator.

1942?
Sure it has!
The conference standings at the
present time look like this:
Won Lost
Stanford 2 1
Oregon 2 1
Oregon State 2 1
U.C.L.A 2 1
U.S.C 11
Washington 11
Washington State 1 2
California 0 1
Idaho 0 1
Montana 0 1
Stanford has played every team
that is tied with it for the top spot.
But the other three teams haven't

met each other, which makes it imperative that somebody knocks some
body else out of the race.
Still remaining on the Indians' schedule are U.S.F., Washington, Santa
Clara, U.S.C., W.S.C., and California in that order. There are two partic
ular toughies in that set-up: Santa Clara and the U. of W. The others
aren't pushovers.
Although the Broncs aren't a conference outfit, it is doubtful if the
conference would send an outfit to the Rose Bowl if that team had been
defeated twice, or more. So it looks as if Clark Shaughnessy's boys are
definitely under pressure from now on in.
0.5.C., unfortunately, has played the hardest part of its schedule al
ready, having met and defeated the Huskies and the Cards. But there's no
telling where the Beavers may be upset. After all, Sam Barry's U.S.C.
Trojans turned the trick once and it could happen again. Oregon, at the
present time, appears to be the most logical candidate to pull the stunt.
But then some team is going to have to beat the Ducks again, if Stanford
is going to wind up as sole possessor of the number one spot when the
dust has settled on the 1941 Pacific Coast Conference grid campaign.
Washington and U.S.C. are still in the running, too. All of which makes
it a rather mixed up affair.
Luckie Louie did a little better this week, picking five winners out of
six contests. Stanford's loss kept it from being a perfect day for the
Pixley prognosticator.


PETE KMETOVIC
r rHEY went and did it, those big Beavers from Oregon State College did!
They took a Stanford team that was seeking its 13th consecutive
victory under the guidance of Clark D. Shaughnessy, roughed it up a
bit, and sent it home a vanquished team.
How did they do it? And what does the defeat mean to Stanford's
Rose Bowl hopes? Those are questions that have been going the rounds
since about 5 o'clock Saturday.
The main answer to question number one is this: Lon Stiner's Oregon
Staters outplayed Clark Shaughnessy's Stanfords. To be sure, we weren't
there, but that was the case or else the great majority of those present at
the toppling got the wrong idea.
But there's another item that was undoubtedly a lai'ge factor in the
outcome. "Skeeter" Peter Kmetovic, Stanford's outstanding running threat
and probably the most consistent ground gainer in Pacific Coast football,
went out of action before the Indians really got in a position to attack.
Without Kmetovic the Big Red Machine isn't the same. Everyone has
said that all along, prophesying what would happen if Frankie Albert or
Kmetovic couldn't play. But no one knew it was going to happen so soon.
Bob Mitchell and A1 Cole subbed for Kmet, but they just couldn't fill his
shoes. Even if they were every bit as gcod as runners and as pass re
ceivers as Kmetovic, the fact that they haven't the great reputation he has
would cut down their effectiveness as decoys. And that makes a lot of
difference in whether the Indians roll or don't roll.

There are undoubtedly a number
of other things that entered into
Stanford's loss to the "giant killing"
Beavers, who only a week before
knocked the great University of
Washington out of the running, but
it really doesn't make a great deal
of difference now that it is all over.
The problem now. as far as the
Stanford gridders are concerned, is
to keep from allowing any more oc
currences, the likes of which re
semble Saturday's.

r rHEY went and did it, those big Beavers from Oregon State College did!
They took a Stanford team that was seeking its 13th consecutive
victory under the guidance of Clark D. Shaughnessy, roughed it up a
bit, and sent it home a vanquished team.
How did they do it? And what does the defeat mean to Stanford's
Rose Bowl hopes? Those are questions that have been going the rounds
since about 5 o'clock Saturday.
The main answer to question number one is this: Lon Stiner's Oregon
Staters outplayed Clark Shaughnessy's Stanfords. To be sure, we weren't
there, but that was the case or else the great majority of those present at
the toppling got the wrong idea.
But there's another item that was undoubtedly a lai'ge factor in the
outcome. "Skeeter" Peter Kmetovic, Stanford's outstanding running threat
and probably the most consistent ground gainer in Pacific Coast football,
went out of action before the Indians really got in a position to attack.
Without Kmetovic the Big Red Machine isn't the same. Everyone has
said that all along, prophesying what would happen if Frankie Albert or
Kmetovic couldn't play. But no one knew it was going to happen so soon.
Bob Mitchell and A1 Cole subbed for Kmet, but they just couldn't fill his
shoes. Even if they were every bit as gcod as runners and as pass re
ceivers as Kmetovic, the fact that they haven't the great reputation he has
would cut down their effectiveness as decoys. And that makes a lot of
difference in whether the Indians roll or don't roll.

There are undoubtedly a number
of other things that entered into
Stanford's loss to the "giant killing"
Beavers, who only a week before
knocked the great University of
Washington out of the running, but
it really doesn't make a great deal
of difference now that it is all over.
The problem now. as far as the
Stanford gridders are concerned, is
to keep from allowing any more oc
currences, the likes of which re
semble Saturday's.
* * *
the Big Red Machine still
have a chance to be playing in
the Rose Bowl come January 1,
1942?
Sure it has!
The conference standings at the
present time look like this:
Won Lost
Stanford 2 1
Oregon 2 1
Oregon State 2 1
U.C.L.A 2 1
U.S.C 11
Washington 11
Washington State 1 2
California 0 1
Idaho 0 1
Montana 0 1
Stanford has played every team
that is tied with it for the top spot.
But the other three teams haven't

met each other, which makes it imperative that somebody knocks some
body else out of the race.
Still remaining on the Indians' schedule are U.S.F., Washington, Santa
Clara, U.S.C., W.S.C., and California in that order. There are two partic
ular toughies in that set-up: Santa Clara and the U. of W. The others
aren't pushovers.
Although the Broncs aren't a conference outfit, it is doubtful if the
conference would send an outfit to the Rose Bowl if that team had been
defeated twice, or more. So it looks as if Clark Shaughnessy's boys are
definitely under pressure from now on in.
0.5.C., unfortunately, has played the hardest part of its schedule al
ready, having met and defeated the Huskies and the Cards. But there's no
telling where the Beavers may be upset. After all, Sam Barry's U.S.C.
Trojans turned the trick once and it could happen again. Oregon, at the
present time, appears to be the most logical candidate to pull the stunt.
But then some team is going to have to beat the Ducks again, if Stanford
is going to wind up as sole possessor of the number one spot when the
dust has settled on the 1941 Pacific Coast Conference grid campaign.
Washington and U.S.C. are still in the running, too. All of which makes
it a rather mixed up affair.
Luckie Louie did a little better this week, picking five winners out of
six contests. Stanford's loss kept it from being a perfect day for the
Pixley prognosticator.
