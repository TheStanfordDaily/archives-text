### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 2 (UP).â€”
It's a wide-open scramble for the
western Rose Bowl bid and the only
sure thing is that the Pacific Coast
Conference football champion will
be a beaten team.
After the third big football Sat
urday of the season, seven of the
major conference teams had been
beaten once and only W.S.C. had
been beaten twice.
Four teams were, technically tied
for the lead with two conference
wins and one loss each: Stanford,
Oregon, Oregon State and U.C.L.A.
The Uclans were virtually eliminated
when they lost 33-0 to Stanford.
