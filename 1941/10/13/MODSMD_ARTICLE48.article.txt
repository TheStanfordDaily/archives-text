# Freshmen Take to Air, Trounce Trobabes, 25-6
## Parkinson's Passes Click for Four Scores; Reserves Show Up Well 
### 
Under a blazing sun. Stanford's Papoose grid machine swept to a 25-0
victory over (lie Trobabes of U.S.C. i'i the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
Saturdayâ€”taking sweet revenge for the 13-12 defeat handed it two years
ago under like conditions on the same field.
Cannon Parkinson tired four passes for touchdowns and set up another
with a heave that found its mark* ~

Halfback Jim Pettit was on the re- I
ceiving end of three of those passes,
and Jim Heald on the fourth.
Finding their ground attack snub- '
bed in the first quarter by a Tro
babe line that dug in and held, the
Card frosh switched to an aerial
bombardment in the second which
netted two scores.
DEFENSE STRONG
Employing a 6-2-2-1 defense the !
southerners stopped the running j
cold, but their pass defense was vul- j
nerable as Ely at a slam contract, j
and the Papooses went wild through
the air.
Left End Dave Brown almost con
verted one of Quarterback Bobby
Andrew's tosses into a touchdown,
making a beautiful one-handed
catch, but he lateraled to a team
mate who was hauled down on the
spot.
In the line Harry Ferris, Harvey
Bernhard, Jack Sogorka, and Sandy
Atherton played a good game, while i
at the ends Pete August, Jack Col
burn, and Sandy Banks were in
there all the time.
McCURDY READY
Jack McCurdy centered in the
last five minutes of the game and j
will be ready to go next week. Neil |
Johnston was at the pivot most of [
the game, alternating with Frank j
Moulton.
Mentor Harry Shipkey was well
pleased with the outcome and can
now be assured of two full teams,
his reserves showed up so well in
the win.
BACKS ALTERNATE
At full Clem Woods and Dave Pate
played about half the game each,
while Pettit and Fred Parsons shone
at the halves. Don Zappetini got in
his share at half, with Fred Sander
man right behind.
Next Saturday's game, originally
scheduled with the Ucla frosh, has
been cancelled, due to lack of enough
men to start a squad at Westwood.
and arrangements are being made
for a game with the Moffatt Field
"B" team.
