# Water Poloists Win 2, Lose 2
## 
### 
Faring slightly better than did |
their brothers up north, Stanford's i
water polo teams broke even last
week, winning two of their four j
games.
After trouncing Compton J. C., 10
to 4, Friday, the varsity dropped a
tough one to a powerful Olympic
Club team, 6 to 5. The varsity re
serves were topped, 10 to 2, by the
Olympic Club subs Saturday.
Definite underdogs to the cham
pion Post Streeters, one of the top
teams in the nation, Coach Norton
Thornton's Indians fought it out on
even terms throughout the contest.
SHIELDS HIGH MAN
High-point man was Jim Shields,
California '37, of the Olympic Club,
who slammed in four scores, and
waged a terrific scoring battle with I
Jack Bleecker, Stanford guard, who j
tied with teammate Bill Mapel at two i
markers.
The game was a see-saw affair j
throughout with both teams even at j
I 2 to 2 in the first quarter, 3 to 3 at
! the third, and 4 to 4 at the third.
BLEECKER HOT
Both Bleecker and Shields were
I red hot in the second half, doing all
the scoring for their two teams.
Bleecker put Stanford ahead, 4 to 3,
after a minute and a half of the sec
ond half on a pass from Fred Man
waring. Thirty seconds later, Shields
evened it up.
Bleecker again put the Indians
ahead in the final period and Shields
tied the game up a few seconds later.
Finally, with 45 seconds to go,
Shields put the game on ice with a
' shot directly in front of goalie Pete
Lee.
