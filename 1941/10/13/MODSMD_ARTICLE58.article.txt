# On the Carpet

THE DAILY has been criticized by many Stan
ford undergraduates, as well as a few from
over in Berkeley, for the editorial stand taken
last Thursday and Friday on this inter-campus
raiding business.
Excom, too, came in for a little name-calling
from these same people.
"We're a bunch of wet blankets," they say.
"We're just a bunch of seniors over-stuffed
with our own importance."
"There have been raids for 50 years; why stop
now?"
"Why did you ever let the Administration
put that clause in the Constitution?"
"Do you want to make us look like a bunch
of sissies?"
We would like to attempt an explanation and
justification of our stand.
We don't like being accused of "wet-blanket
ing Stanford spirit." But the truth of the matter
is that we are not doing this. We are pointing
out that vandalism, gang-fights, injuries, head
lines in city papers are not manifestations of
Stanford spirit.
Yesterday's rally, with more students present
to welcome home a defeated team than were
present to cheer a prospectively victorious team
last Thursday, was true Stanford spirit.
And we are not being bulldozed by the Ad
ministration. Men's Council, composed of five
of your fellow students, two of whom will be
elected tomorrow, is going to hand down the
decision expelling you from Stanford if you are
caught in a raid on Cal.
Yes, we won't deny there have been raids
in the past. And did anyone ever gain anything
from them, except shaved heads and, last year,
30 hours' work at the Convalescent Home?
We don't have to worry about the "C." One
of the East Bay high schools always paints it a
couple of times a year anyway.
We still have all our Big Game Week tradi
tions. They can build up twice enough spirit
for any football game. At least our Administra
tion has not had to prohibit us from holding a
rally at night for the Big Game; it has not had to
say, "No, you can't have a Bonfire." Those
things have happened at Cal because of broken
store windows, torn-down trolley car lines, etc.
Now they have no Bonfire and have their rally
in the afternoon.
The whole thing boils down to this situation:
whether we at Stanford are "big" enough to
shoot a little dose of good old horse sense into
the flames of "spirit" without dropping the
temperature.
