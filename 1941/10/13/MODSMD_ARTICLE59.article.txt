# Nice Work . . .

RALLY COMMITTEE used to be just a fash
ionable activity. It was nice to wear a white
sweater with a red insignia—satisfying to be of
service to the Stanford Red. But aside from that,
Rally Committee just did its card stunts and
went about its business. Then:
"Konko the Bronko!" Bang! Rally Committee
suddenly soared to fame—or perhaps nosedived
to notoriety. Pre-game windshield stickers be
gan turning the campus stomach; Chappie,
quick on the up-take, threw in its two-bits' worth
in a blue-plate special issue with such little
gems as "Forge-on-essy with Shaughnessy." A
querulous campus reeled, and wove its plas
tered cars in and out of puzzled San Francisco
traffic. But it was good for the laughs.
Rally Committee emerged from the fun house
yesterday and drew a deep breath of a strange
smell. It was fresh air* Perhaps they were
startled out of their we'll-win, who-cares leth
argy when the jinx number, 13, caught up with
Stanford. After winning 13 games, under a jim
dandy field general with a 13 on his back, Stan
ford had a tough afternoon on the Corvallis turf
last Saturday. Maybe it was just fate.
Yesterday Rally Committee woke up on a
grey Sunday morning and found that its tummy,
bloated by victory for over a year, had deflated.

It cinched its belt and went to work.
The "Welcome Home" rally they threw at the
Paly depot yesterday afternoon was proof that
Stanford's affection for the Wow Bows and her
gratitude to Clark Shaughnessy is not fickle.—
