### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UP).—
Administration leaders tonight pre
dicted a speedy journey through
Congress for legislation to permit
arming of American merchant ships,
on which hearings start tomorrow.
Noting that the House Foreign
Affairs Committee already has de
cided to hold hearings only two
days— tomorrow and Tuesday—they
foresaw a House vote on passage of
the resolution before the end of the
week, and predicted that it would
show a substantial "aye" majority.
