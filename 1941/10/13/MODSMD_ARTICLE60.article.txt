# Dear Coach:

### 
IT had to come sooner or later.
You have had misfortunes at Stanford—par
ticularly one with a Mr. Atherton—but never
before defeat.
We of the student body were probably getting
a little over-optimistic after the first two show
ings of this season. We had visions of another
undefeated season. We didn't think there were
any football teams better than yours, and ours.
Now, our feet are on the ground. There won't
be any "Rose Bowling Indians" headlines in The
Daily for a little while. The one thing we want
you to know, Mr. Shaughnessy, is that last Sat
urday's loss—whether it was the "13 jinx," just
plain fate, a wet field, loss of Pete, or that the
Beavers were a superior team —does not in any
way dim in our minds your ability as a coach or
the team's ability to play top-notch football in
any man's league.
We'll be out there cheering harder than ever
next Saturday and every other Saturday.
