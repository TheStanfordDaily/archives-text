# Accident

LAST Thursday The Daily carried an editorial
titled "Campus on Wheels," a plea for safety
on Farm roads.
It included this statement:
. . bicycles will carry tail lights, as required
by law. Further, it is wise to carry flashlights
for protection at night."
Last night blame for an accident in which a
Stanford man, Herbert Zimmerman, received a
mild concussion and laceration of the head, was
laid directly upon the fact that the bicycle Zim
merman was riding carried no head lamp. He
ran into a car, the driver of which apparently
did not see the bicyclist in time to avoid the
accident, although he did stop dead still.
Frank F. Walker, financial vice-president of
the University, in a letter commending The Daily
following its first safety editorial, said:
"You and I are of course occasionally annoyed
by police interference as we drive our cars here
and on the highways, and yet in the last analysis
no individual should be permitted the right to
endanger the life and property of others by
disregarding ordinary safety precautions.
"Your article was a very helpful contribution
to our campaign."
Safety campaigns by the University and edi
torials in The Daily are designed to make Farm
roads safer for the motorist, the pedestrian—and
the bicyclist.
Last night careless disregard of safety rules
on the part of an individual resulted in an acci
dent. Not a bad one, but any accident is bad
enough.
If there is a next time, it might be much worse.
Anyone knows that. But will there be a next
time? Anyone, that is, everyone—each indi
vidual—has the answer to that one.—Harold
