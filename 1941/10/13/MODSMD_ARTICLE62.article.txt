EVERYTHING ENDS
r JpHE unbelievable has happened. Over the week-end j
our boys lost their first game in thirteen tries. We
are no longer the idol of the nation, we are just another
football team that wins on some Saturdays, and loses on
other Saturdays. There's nothing magic or mystical
about the Indiaiis. They arc a bunch of boys that play
football well.
It took a lot of bad luck to do it. It took rain, and
some tough penalties, and playing away from home,
and an injured Kmetovic and other things; but it was
done just the same, and it shows that there are some
obstacles that Stanford is unable to overcome, espe
cially when the obstacles come on the same day with
a powerful team.
But our season isn't over, any way you look at it.
Stanford still has a good chance of celebrating the
New Year in Pasadena. All we have to do is win all
our games and pray for an Oregon State defeat and
we're in.

It is too bad that our climb back to the top has to
start with the University of San Francisco. The Dons
are one of the weakest teams in organized football, and
would have a tough time edging out Mills College,
if Mary Shadid, ace fullback for Mills, hadn't gotten
a lockout, and gotten herself declared ineligible. We
will gain none of our lost prestige, no matter how badly
we beat the Dons, and it will be a wasted Saturday.

of our football enthusiasts were fortunate
k enough to make the trip to Corvallis. But the
majority of us had to stay home, and listen to the game j
over the radio. And anyone that heard that broadcast i
will think twice before ever driving into an Associated
station again. I know that every lime I go near one I'll
hear the awful voice of John Carpenter, and just keep !
going by. Carpenter telling about a play:
"The ball is snapped; it's Armstrong around
the. no it's Albert fading for one of his wonderful
passes, and he lets go a long one and. man oh
man what a wonderful play. Pardon me if I get
enthusiastic, folks, but you've never seen any
thing like it. How about it. Art. wasn't that swell?
Now let me run over that play again for you."
John Carpenter, everyone hates you. Whoever told
you that you were an announcer? Whoever told you
that you know anything about football? You dragged
Stanford through a terrible afternoon. Mr. John Car
penter, man oh man oh man, never talk at a Stanford
rally.

j AND over the week-end another consecutive record
came to an end. The sun stopped shining and the j
! blue skies disappeared and Sunday morning found big,
; black clouds hanging over the school and the streets
and lawns wet from the evening rain. But that has
cleared up already, and maybe our football picture
J will do the same tiling.
