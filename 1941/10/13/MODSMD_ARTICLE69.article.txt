# Beauty Bevy Adds Punch To 'Lady Be Good' Musical
## 
### 
"LADY BE GOOD," starring Aim
Sothern, Robert Young, and Elea
nor Powell, now showing at the
Fox-Stanford Theater.
If you are out for plenty of rhythm
and good tunes, spiced with a bevy
of beauty, "Lady Be Good" is it.
Based on a somewhat thin plot in
volving two song-writers who click
on music but not in marriage, it is
good for an afternoon of light en
tertainment.
Sultry-eyed Ann Sothern plays
Dixie Donagon, the wife who writes
the lyrics; and Robert Young, as
tall, dark, and handsome as ever, is
the tune-composing husband, find
ing that they are a natural combi
nation when it comes to writing hit
tunes, which incidentally deserve to
be called just that, they according
to procedure fall in love, but break
up their marriage because success
goes to the husband's head.
BARRYMORE GOOD
Lionel Barrymore is good even
in the small part of a judge in a do
mestic relations court, in which ca
pacity he plays Cupid to the bat
tling composers (after they have re
| married and are appealing for a
second divorce.)
We see very little of Eleanor
Powell and her twinkling taps, but
what we do see is good. She and
John Carroll furnish romance num
ber two, and are chief plotters to
bring their friends back together.
Most of the laughs are thrown
around by bungling Red Skelton,
I who is always sticking his foot in
the wrong place at the most inap-
I propriate moment.
DANCING TERRIER
In my opinion Miss Dixie Dona
gon's mascot, "Buttons," a clever
dancing terrier that takes part in
one of the two dances done by Miss
Powell, steals the show. A poker
faced songstress (the name doesn't
come) adds her bit to the gayety.
The Berry Brothers, negro tap
dancers and muscle twisters, are
practically unbelievable, they are
so good.
The picture was a little too long,
and drawn out by a few too many

intimate heart-to-heart talks, but
the music, if you like the kind that
makes you tup your foot and hum
when you come out of the theater,
is definitely good from the title tune
! on down.
II YOU LIKE IT
The second feature is one of those
gentleman gangster things with
plenty of bullets flying around, a
bar fight or two, and a bloody crash.
It stars Anthony Quinn as the fugi
tive from justice and Roger Pryor
| as the pursuing officer of the law.
After a number of fake traps fyil
to draw in the "Kingfish," the girl
I in the mix-up, a cute little dark
eyed trick, after marrying both the
principals (with a divorce inter
vening, of course), finally comes out
with the right one, slightly muddied
up after knocking of! the other one,
; but victorious. It's all right if you
like that sort of thing.â€”Craig
