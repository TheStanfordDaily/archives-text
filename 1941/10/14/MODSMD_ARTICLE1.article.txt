### AMIE REICHERT 
A RUMOR leaped into the head
lines last night. In boldface type
it screamed, "British Invade Rus
sia." The story beneath was cau
tious, vague, unconfirmed. It dealt
with generalities, using the ambig
uous lingo which is peculiar to all j
unverifiable news reports: "it was !
understood, "it is claimed."
Today, that rumor may become j
fact. At this writing, however, it :
remains a whisper caught by the
Swedes from the Finns and subsc- j
quently shouted to the world.
That is all we know.
Authorities in London did not
comment on the Stockholm report
that some 40,000 British soldiers
landed yesterday at Archangel, and
another unidentified port on the
White Sea, believed to be Kanda
lashka.
But the rumor would not be stifled
by British silence.

r |HIE persistence of the story leads
one to speculate on the effects
such an invasion might have at this
time.
The railway arterial from Arch
angel to Moscow is one of the three
supply lines in Russia which are
still intact. All the other important
routes to the outside world (except
ing the Persian Gulf and Vladivos
tok) have been cut by the Nazi
pincers.
This supply line runs north and
south ,tluit is, parallel to the Nazi
front. It passes some 350 miles
cast of Leningrad, northern ex
tremity of the German battle line.
Passage of British troops from
Archangel along this route to, say,
the Leningrad area, would be rela
tively free from Nazi interference.
They might even conceivably move
down to dig in with the Russjans to
the north and east of Moscow.
The mere presence of a B.E.F. of
almost any size in Russia would give
an incalculable boost to Russian
morale and preclude any possibility
of a separate Soviet-German peace.
Besides, it would serve as a
sedative to resentful and vocifer
ous Britishers who have been
seething over England's inactivity.
Criticism of Churchill and his
war cabinet has not been confined to
a mere editorial howling. It has
come from M.P.'s as well, especially
the Laborite group.

the fact that last night's
reports would seem to indicate a
slowing of the Nazi momentum, the
graveness of Russia's situation can
not be overemphasized.
The bone-crushing pincers are
curving inevitably around the
lied capital. From Kalinin, 100
miles to the north, and Tula, 100
miles to the south, Nazi columns
are driving steadily toward Mos
cow.
London expressed the belief yes
terday that the Russians would be
able to hold off the invaders 70 or 80
miles from the Kremlin until the
heavy snows fall.
This was the first optimistic
note from the British capital since
Adolf Hitler launched his new all
out offensive last Thursday.
But, it seems that the Nazis are
still rolling along, though their
speed has been diminished some
what by fierce and fanatical Rus
sian resistance.

lARASSING HARRY" made his
debut over the networks of
the 8.8.C. yesterday. Needless to,
say, he was an unwelcome and un
invited guest, for he has become
overnight the British radio's No. 1
heckler.
Like Russia's "Ivan the Ter
rible," Harry operates from a pow
erful outside station and breaks up
news broadcasts.
He comes in at the inopportune
moment with insulting not-so-smart
cracks. And because he is pro-Nazi
he is not very funny.
Ivan has the system down cold.
After every German victory claim,
he comes in with a villainous "hch
heh," or a contemptuous "scz
you."
But Harry seems to be overdoing
the thing. They say he is agitating
for the overthrow of Churchill, "who
has lost the empire," "sold out to
America," "swindled the British."
