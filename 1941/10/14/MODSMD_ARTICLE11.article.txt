# Britain Wants Supplies, Not Men—--Luck
## 
### 
Professor J. Murray Luck returned
from a tour of England yesterday
and reported the British do not feel
the United States should send an
expeditionary force to Europe.
Dr. Luck, professor of biochemis
try, went to Britain in August to
study wartime nutrition conditions
there. He said the British are at
present well fed, although there are
shortages in certain items of food,
and they are becoming increasingly
dependent upon the United States
for certain essential foodstuffs.
RATIONING WORKS
"The rationing system works very
well," said Dr. Luck. "There are a
number of foodstuffs that are not
rationed, and these tend to be in
short supply and are always difficult
to get. Meat is very strictly ra
tioned. Eggs are rationed at three
per person per month. There is a
very evident shortage of dried fruits
and a rather serious shortage of
citrus fruits."
Dr. Luck was impressed with the
"magnificent spirit" of the British
people, and said, "One never en
counters anywhere in Britain any
thing that savors of defeatism —to a
man they know what the outcome
is going to be."
BRriTSH APPRECIATIVE'
He stated that the British were
"tremendously appreciative" for the
supplies the United States has sent
them. "One thing they want more
than anything else," Dr. Luck said,
"is a continued flow of materials in
increasing volume, and anything that
will bring more supplies will be
welcomed."
Two interesting incidents marked
Dr. Luck's journeys across the At
lantic. On the way over the battle
ship Prince of Wales, carrying Prime
Minister Churchill back to London
after his Atlantic meeting with Pres
ident Roosevelt, passed through the
convoy, steaming by about 700 yards
to starboard from the ship on which
the Stanford professor was travel
ing. On the way home a submarine
attacked the convoy, but was driven
off by depth bombs before it could
launch any torpedoes.

tioned. Eggs are rationed at three
per person per month. There is a
very evident shortage of dried fruits
and a rather serious shortage of
citrus fruits."
Dr. Luck was impressed with the
"magnificent spirit" of the British
people, and said, "One never en
counters anywhere in Britain any
thing that savors of defeatism —to a
man they know what the outcome
is going to be."
BRriTSH APPRECIATIVE'
He stated that the British were
"tremendously appreciative" for the
supplies the United States has sent
them. "One thing they want more
than anything else," Dr. Luck said,
"is a continued flow of materials in
increasing volume, and anything that
will bring more supplies will be
welcomed."
Two interesting incidents marked
Dr. Luck's journeys across the At
lantic. On the way over the battle
ship Prince of Wales, carrying Prime
Minister Churchill back to London
after his Atlantic meeting with Pres
ident Roosevelt, passed through the
convoy, steaming by about 700 yards
to starboard from the ship on which
the Stanford professor was travel
ing. On the way home a submarine
attacked the convoy, but was driven
off by depth bombs before it could
launch any torpedoes.
Professor J. Murray Luck returned
from a tour of England yesterday
and reported the British do not feel
the United States should send an
expeditionary force to Europe.
Dr. Luck, professor of biochemis
try, went to Britain in August to
study wartime nutrition conditions
there. He said the British are at
present well fed, although there are
shortages in certain items of food,
and they are becoming increasingly
dependent upon the United States
for certain essential foodstuffs.
RATIONING WORKS
"The rationing system works very
well," said Dr. Luck. "There are a
number of foodstuffs that are not
rationed, and these tend to be in
short supply and are always difficult
to get. Meat is very strictly ra
tioned. Eggs are rationed at three
per person per month. There is a
very evident shortage of dried fruits
and a rather serious shortage of
citrus fruits."
