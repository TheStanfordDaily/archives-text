# Women of '44 Plan Reunion For Saturday
## Box Lunch Precedes Mass Attendance At Card-Don Game 
### 
Robleites of '44 will gather from j
Hall and Row to descend on the
Women's Gym at noon Saturday for
an all-out pre-game reunion. Tick
ets for box lunches are being sold at
40 cents by sophomore representa
tives in each of the living groups
throughout the week.
The event, suggested by "Sis" Lar
kin, first Roble president last year,
is being chairmanned by Janet At
kinson, her successor. Assisting her
is Pat Thurreson with "Ham" How
ard in charge of finance.
Under the committee's sponsor
ship, the mass meeting Is going to
be as close a re-enaction of last
year's luncheon hours as possible,
overlooking the regrettable absence
of the hashers. Available senior and
junior sponsors have been invited
and corridor groups are asked to
brush up on the Roble songs in
which they specialized.
LUNCHEON GUESTS
Special guests of the afternoon
will be Dean Yost; Miss Clark, this
year's director of Roble; Miss Lucy
Latiade, assistant director; Miss
Grace Glenn, director of the Roble
dining hall; Mrs. Mort, well-remem
bered by girls who have raced up
the hall steps at 2:29 a.m.; and Miss
Lee, responsible for the welcome
"one buzzer for a telephone, two
buzzes for a caller."
If possible, girls should try to
| reach the gym by 11 o'clock when
the volley-ball and tennis courts
will be open for impromptu games.
However, since this is the first time
the ex-Robleites have gotten togeth
er since last year, the time will prob
ably be spent on catching up with
summer and current gossip.
TO ATTEND GAME
Following the luncheon, the girls,
still in the guise of freshmen, will
walk over to the stadium en masse
where it is hoped that the Rally
Committee will l>e able to reserve a
special block of seats in the rooting
section. White shirts are the order
of the day, and chairmen are re
minding the sophomore women to
remember that both pompons and
student body cards are necessary to
get in the game. . . . Don't forget
them!
With any of the enthusiasm of last
year's Roble rooters displayed Sat
urday plus the revived varsity "T"
formation, the resulting combina
tion should prove tough for the vis
iting Dons, even without Kmetovic.

40 cents by sophomore representa
tives in each of the living groups
throughout the week.
The event, suggested by "Sis" Lar
kin, first Roble president last year,
is being chairmanned by Janet At
kinson, her successor. Assisting her
is Pat Thurreson with "Ham" How
ard in charge of finance.
Under the committee's sponsor
ship, the mass meeting Is going to
be as close a re-enaction of last
year's luncheon hours as possible,
overlooking the regrettable absence
of the hashers. Available senior and
junior sponsors have been invited
and corridor groups are asked to
brush up on the Roble songs in
which they specialized.
LUNCHEON GUESTS
Special guests of the afternoon
will be Dean Yost; Miss Clark, this
year's director of Roble; Miss Lucy
Latiade, assistant director; Miss
Grace Glenn, director of the Roble
dining hall; Mrs. Mort, well-remem
bered by girls who have raced up
the hall steps at 2:29 a.m.; and Miss
Lee, responsible for the welcome
"one buzzer for a telephone, two
buzzes for a caller."
If possible, girls should try to
| reach the gym by 11 o'clock when
the volley-ball and tennis courts
will be open for impromptu games.
However, since this is the first time
the ex-Robleites have gotten togeth
er since last year, the time will prob
ably be spent on catching up with
summer and current gossip.
TO ATTEND GAME
Following the luncheon, the girls,
still in the guise of freshmen, will
walk over to the stadium en masse
where it is hoped that the Rally
Committee will l>e able to reserve a
special block of seats in the rooting
section. White shirts are the order
of the day, and chairmen are re
minding the sophomore women to
remember that both pompons and
student body cards are necessary to
get in the game. . . . Don't forget
them!
With any of the enthusiasm of last
year's Roble rooters displayed Sat
urday plus the revived varsity "T"
formation, the resulting combina
tion should prove tough for the vis
iting Dons, even without Kmetovic.
Robleites of '44 will gather from j
Hall and Row to descend on the
Women's Gym at noon Saturday for
an all-out pre-game reunion. Tick
ets for box lunches are being sold at
40 cents by sophomore representa
tives in each of the living groups
throughout the week.
