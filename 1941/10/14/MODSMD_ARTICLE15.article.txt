### 
The Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion has been called in to investi
gate the causes of a fire which
charred the interior of the radio and
meteorological research station on
the old Searsvillc road last Friday
night.
Though the fire was apparently of
electrical origin, the FBI was noti
fied because the building is now
government property and the seat
of a defense research project being
directed by Prof. F. E. Terman, head
of the electrical engineering depart
ment.
About $2,000 worth of radio equip
ment had been installed in the
building, Dr. Terman said. How
badly the equipment was damaged
is not known at this time, since it
must be removed and tested.
The fire was discovered at 9 p.m.
by Prof. Edward S. Shaw, who lives
near the shack. The station was
originally for meteorological re
search, and equipment worth $500
was damaged. Certain meteorolog
ical records were also destroyed.
