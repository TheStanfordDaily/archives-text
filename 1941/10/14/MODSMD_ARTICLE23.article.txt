BERLIN, Monday, Oct. 13 (UP).—
German press dispatches reported
today that. Nazi troops have smashed
to within at least 90 miles of Moscow
at points west and southwest of the
Soviet capital after sweeping re
lentlessly past pockets at Bryansk
and Vyazma where it was claimed
200,000 additional Russian prisoners
were taken.
GERMANS SQUEEZE
MOSCOW PINCERS
BERLIN, Oct. 13 (UP).—Speedy
German panzer columns were re
ported tonight to be gouging through
the Kalinin and Tula regions 100
miles equidistant from Moscow to
the northwest and south in a giant
pincers maneuver to encircle the
capital and take it from the rear.
The high command said the frontal
menace to Moscow was growing
graver by the hour with the anni
hilation of Red army forces trapped
in the Vyazma and Bryansk areas.
It said the number of Russian pris
oners taken in those pockets had
surpassed 350,000 and was climbing
steadily.
The Nazis also claimed that the
destruction of the Vyazma troops was
nearly concluded, that helpless rem
nants of Soviet Ukrainian armies
were in mad retreat, leaving the
Donetz basin wide open to German
attack, and that the Red army was
unable to stem the great offensive
anywhere.
