### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UP).—
Three cabinet chiefs and two ad
mirals warned today that limitations
imposed by the Neutrality Act en
danger American defense and urged
swift revision to permit arming of
American ships before "it is too
late."
With their testimony, the admin
istration rested its case before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee,
which reserved tomorrow for oppo
sition witnesses.
Bui minority isolationist mem
bers, irked by the committee's deci
sion to restrict hearings to two days,
r< fused to call witnesses. Neverthe
less, five opponents will be heard
tomorrow at their request.
WHEKLER PROTESTS
Two ranking Republican members
- -Representatives Hamilton Fish of
New York and bewhiskered Geo/ge
Holden Tinkham of Massachusetts —
boycotted today's action as a gesture
of protest. This drew sharp criti
cism from Hou.se Democratic Leader
John McCormack who accused Fish
and Tinkham of "playing politics."
Meanwhile, Senate isolationist
leader Burton K. Wheeler, D., Mont.,
pledged a "determined fight" against
the administration proposal to arm
.ships.
In swift sequence, the House com
mittee heard Secretary of State Cor
dell Hull, Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson, Secretary of the Navy
Frank Knox, Admiral Emory S.
Land, chairman of the Maritime
Commission, and Admiral Harold R.
Stark, chief of naval operations.
KNOX GOES ALL-OUT
Hull and Stimson, first on the
stand, both urged repeal of the Neu
trality Act prohibitions against ship
; rming and entry of such ships into
belligerent areas.
Knox went beyond the proposals
"of his cabinet colleagues. He called
for repeal of the entire Neutrality
Act. He said the United States is
nt neutral and never has been in
pirit since the war started.
1 XPERTS' REASONS
Land and Stark explained the
technical advantages that would re-
It from mounting guns on ships,
'hey said guns would keep attack
iig planes at an altitude which
makes bomb hits difficult, give the
hips some chance against surface
i iders and force submarines to re
main submerged — thus inducing
their marksmanship. Land said also
the move would have an important
i fleet on the "morale of the men on
hoard."
All five administration witnesses
i < ad prepared statements which were
made public, then extended their
i' marks at secret hearings.
