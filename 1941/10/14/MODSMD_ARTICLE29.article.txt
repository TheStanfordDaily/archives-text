# Vocom Volunteers to Teach Women Which 'Apple to Bite'
## 
### 
"Would you know which apple to bite?" was the question asked of
undergraduate women in questionnaires distributed by Women's Voca
tional Committee last night during house meetings. The apples were after
collt'ge careers; and vocom, through its plan of guidance, makes selecting
this career as easy as biting an apple.

The survey which they are con
ducting opens the fall guidance pro
gram. It is designed to show the
occupational fields which interest
the majority of women, thus en
abling the committee to bring to the
women speakers and information
which will be the most valuable to
them.
To give senior women experience
required by employers, vocom will
continue the Quota Club which will
meet Wednesday afternoon at 5 in
the Women's Clubhouse. Employers
offer to these seniors an hour's try
out experience a week. Types of
experience offered might be typing,
selling, bookkeeping, taking dicta
tion, filing, or meeting people.
To help each woman plan ahead,
vocom provides the opportunity to
gain information about a chosen
career by enabling her to meet per
sons already successful in the field
which she plans to enter and by as
sisting each individual during her
undergraduate years to plan a pro
gram, which will lead to her even
tual goal.
