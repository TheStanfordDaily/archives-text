# 'Pick-Out-A-Man' Yells Are Big Help, Says 'Bandooch'
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
A new yell put in an appearance this year. At the Oregon game a little
black man stood up and roared "Bite 'em Bruno," which is a very distinc
tive yell never heard before except at the Belmont Dog Races.
Surprisingly enough, B. Banducei. right tackle and recipient of (his un
usual encouragement, spilled the Oregon ball carrier for a loss on the

next play. Bruno was asked yes
terday at practice if he thought in
dividual "pick-out-a-man" yelling
had more in the way of inspiration
than mass chanting. "Bandooch"
didn't recall that particular occasion
but he did go out of his way (five
fast laps) to say that the team really
missed its rooting section up at
Corvallis.
It's part of Bruno's nature to tear
the opposing line to pieces but he
admits that individual yelling of
encouragement is a big help. The big
tackle agreed that it is only natural
for a man to try even harder if he
knows someone is watching him in
particular.
As to the game up north, it seems
the home guard stood during most of
the game and hollered "hold that
line" even when the Indians got the
ball on their own 40. Against the
crazed yelling of the pro-Beaver
throng at Bell Field, Stanford put
up only a couple of dozen voices
which isn't enough when Dutch
Con lan is the referee.
