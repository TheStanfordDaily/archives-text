# Unhappy Don Coach Awaits Vengeful Cards
## 
### MAP EVERETT 
No one can blame Jeff Cravath
this week if the U.S.F. head man
decides football is more trouble
than it's worth.
The new coach of the Dons doesn't
even have a chance to concentrate
on forgetting St. Mary's; because,
this Saturday, he faces the worst
ordeal a football coach can go
through. The schedule demands
that his unfortunate Hilltoppers play
a bitter, revengeful band of Stanford
Indians on Saturday afternoon.
When a champion is temporarily
deposed it behooves the next op
ponent to prepare for the worst. It
isn't going to be very inspiring to
make a comeback against the lowly
Dons, but Stanford, with the mem
ory of that goose-egg at Corvallis,
will have to be restrained from
pouring it on no matter who the
opponent is.
SHOWED NOTHING
Jefi' Cravath's outfit showed next
to nothing against a mediocre St.
Mary's team Sunday with bad ball
handling cancelling any offensive
threat they might have presented.
Strader's Raiders completely smoth
ered the Hilltoppers by detecting
great gaps in the secondary. Pitch
ing Johnny Podesto of Modesto
threw strikes all afternoon and the
Dons didn't mind a bit, even when
the score went to 30-0.
San Francisco has lost the Fisk
brothers and so far. Pete Franceschi,
Vic Ramus, Neil Sheridan, and the
rest have been very ineffective as
offensive threats. About the only
thing that can be said for the Dons
is that their roster contains no out
of-state players.
PASSING DRILL
While Jeff Cravath tried fran
tically to get together a semblance
of a ball club, Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy ran his Stanford team through
passing drill with A1 Cole and.
Frank Forbes alternating at left
half; Hoot Armstrong, Buck Faw
cett, and Bob Ditlevsen trading off
at right half. Arnie Meiners badly
battered from the Beaver game
watched the workout in street
clothes. Roger Laverty ran at left
end with Bill Symes and Fred Meyer
alternating at the other wing spot.
Pete Kmetovic will be sidelined
for two weeks and Hank Norberg is
still favoring his injured leg.

Jefi' Cravath's outfit showed next
to nothing against a mediocre St.
Mary's team Sunday with bad ball
handling cancelling any offensive
threat they might have presented.
Strader's Raiders completely smoth
ered the Hilltoppers by detecting
great gaps in the secondary. Pitch
ing Johnny Podesto of Modesto
threw strikes all afternoon and the
Dons didn't mind a bit, even when
the score went to 30-0.
San Francisco has lost the Fisk
brothers and so far. Pete Franceschi,
Vic Ramus, Neil Sheridan, and the
rest have been very ineffective as
offensive threats. About the only
thing that can be said for the Dons
is that their roster contains no out
of-state players.
PASSING DRILL
While Jeff Cravath tried fran
tically to get together a semblance
of a ball club, Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy ran his Stanford team through
passing drill with A1 Cole and.
Frank Forbes alternating at left
half; Hoot Armstrong, Buck Faw
cett, and Bob Ditlevsen trading off
at right half. Arnie Meiners badly
battered from the Beaver game
watched the workout in street
clothes. Roger Laverty ran at left
end with Bill Symes and Fred Meyer
alternating at the other wing spot.
Pete Kmetovic will be sidelined
for two weeks and Hank Norberg is
still favoring his injured leg.
No one can blame Jeff Cravath
this week if the U.S.F. head man
decides football is more trouble
than it's worth.
The new coach of the Dons doesn't
even have a chance to concentrate
on forgetting St. Mary's; because,
this Saturday, he faces the worst
ordeal a football coach can go
through. The schedule demands
that his unfortunate Hilltoppers play
a bitter, revengeful band of Stanford
Indians on Saturday afternoon.
When a champion is temporarily
deposed it behooves the next op
ponent to prepare for the worst. It
isn't going to be very inspiring to
make a comeback against the lowly
Dons, but Stanford, with the mem
ory of that goose-egg at Corvallis,
will have to be restrained from
pouring it on no matter who the
opponent is.
