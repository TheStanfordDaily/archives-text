### DON SELBY 
SOMETHING has happened in the Northwest, and especially at Cor- i
vallis, Ore., the spot Oregon Staters call home. They've simply gone
football mad.
Reports from those who saw the game up that way are to the effect
that the Beaver rooters were (and are) the wildest mob that ever at
tended a football game. The night before the contest, the Stanford team
stayed in a little hotel in Corvallis, and the sleep they got isn't even
worth mentioning. The boys just didn't get to sleep, for the Oregon Staters
paraded up and clown the streets and made so much noise that it seemed
like New Year's Eve.
A San Francisco columnist last week mentioned that that was often
the case in Corvallis. That is. visiting teams are a little hard put for
a good night's rest mi the eve of the battle. We don't think that there
is anything intentional on the part of the O.S.C. coaching staff in the
demonstration's cffect 011 the Beavers' opponents. Fact is. the coaching
staff probably doesn't even think about it.
However, the break plus the inspiration that was running rampant in
the ranks of the Beavers would almost certainly have turned the trick
whether the Cards slept well or not. Inspiration is a great thing in football.
And the O.S.C. gridders had it Saturday.

Â¥T'S A GOOD thing that comparative scores don't mean anything.
Remember: Stanford beat U.C.L.A. by a tremendous score, and
the Bruins had previously defeated W.S.C.. the team that has defeated
California, the team that has trounced St. Mary's, the team that com
pletely overwhelmed U.S.F. Sunday last.
On that basis, what will the score of the Stanford-U.S.F. contest be? !
Yes, but you just can't operate on that basis, for there's hardly a thing j
as unreliable as comparative scores.

/ TIUCK TAYLOR, Stanford's great left guard, received a letter the other j
* day from Norm Standlee, the former Indian fullback who is now grid
ding for pay for the Chicago Bears, pro champs.
The Chief was wondering about who was playing right guard and (
who handled the right half duties. He wondered whether Milt Vuci
nich. with whom Standlee and Taylor roomed all last summer, was
to fat to "waddle around the ends."
He said that although pro football was a lot rougher than the college
brand, it was easier on a fellow in ihe long run.
"Back here a guy only plays a half where in college he'd play the j
whole game," is the way Standlee explained it.
Yesterday the Chief led his outfit to a runaway victory, serving notice i
that those who boomed him for All-American honors before he was in
jured last fall were not on the wrong track. Bill Osmanski, the former
Holy Cross star who led the Bears last year, was an All-American fullback
in his college days, but Standlee seems to be more outstanding of the
pair this fail. And Hugh Gallarneau, right half on the same team, is doing 1
well, too.
