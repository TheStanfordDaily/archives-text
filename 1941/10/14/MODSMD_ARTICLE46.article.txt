this: season.
Originally scheduled t<: moot the Bruin hahes here, the game was called

NO INJURIES
The Card frosh came back from
sunny southern Cal with a 25-6 win
over the Trobabes and no serious j
injuries to speak of.
Bob Hall, reserve end, fractured a I
bone in his hand but will be ready
to go soon.
Jack McCurdy, injured before the |
season got under way, was in at
center for the last five minutes of
the S.C. game, and looks like he
could move a house if he had to.
From all reports of the game in j
L.A. the Trobabe line was the stiff
est forward wall the Papeese have
been up against yet.

an aerial attack, and the frosh '
rolled up four touchdowns via I
passes. Cannon Parkinson com- j
pie ted three to Jim Pettit for scores* j
Bobby Andrews took a crack at the
signal calling spot and completed a
long heave to Dave Brown, who
made the circus catch of the day

goal.
Yesterday the yearlings worked
out on plays in a dummy scrim- i
mage.
