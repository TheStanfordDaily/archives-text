# Card Poloists Beat Berkeley
## 
### 
Stanford's polo team showed its
class last Saturday in whipping the
Berkeley Polo Club 8-3.
The first-string quartet of Ben
Snure, Bill Dirker, Mike Gates, and
Denny Green came through in style
that bodes well for the future of the
Farm's horsemen this year. Snure
led the scoring with four goals,
while Dirker notched a pair and
Gates and Green scored a goal
apiece.
Next Friday the Stanford outfit
faces the Cal Aggies team at 4 p.m.
on the Farm's home field. The Cal
Aggies, according to Lieutenant Rob
ert A. Ranzoni, coach of the- Stan
ford quartet, are a tough team and
should give the Farm boys a run for
their money.
