THE United States is contributing everything
in its system but its life blood to annihilate for.
eternity a madman whose methods fester ever
wider over the globe and which may come close
to putrifying the virtues of freedom.
This means that the United States is going so
deeply into debt that taxes, prices, and priorities
demand sacrifices from every man-jack who
salutes the Stars and Stripes in symbolical grati
tude for his personal liberty.
Further, it means that United States citizens,
through the voice of their government, have
justified the piling up of a debt the end of which
the present generation will never live to see
and which their descendants will have a very
hard time concluding. It threatens to cause in
flation and it endangers national security. But
it is taken for granted that we must run these
risks—that we must operate on the margin—to
preserve our life and defeat that which would
destroy it.
But the job is only half done, maybe less than
that. We are producing the goods, yes, but we
must deliver them. For that a transfusion to our
allies is necessary. Furthermore, we are com
mitted to defeat the Nazi thought, and to do
this we must go all-out to preserve our freedom.
This means fighting fire with fire, it means im
posing upon the world a cardinal point of inter
national law under the democratic conception—
freedom of the seas.
The United States, pushing home production
and personal sacrifice, cannot legally deliver
the goods, and it has a two-faced Judas appear
ance which at once guarantees freedom of the
seas and at the same time supports a Neutrality
Act which forbids sweeping the seas of piracy.
Granted that the problem is basically one of
conflicting philosophies of life; to preserve ours
it is necessary to act.
To win the present struggle with Naziism de
mands national unity, and unity is honeycombed
in the beginning by the vestigial remnant that
is the Neutrality Law.
To rectify the situation and create an honest,
democratic spearhead that will blast National
Socialism from the earth, President Roosevelt
asks revision of the 1939 law that forbids arm
ing of merchant ships flying the American flag.
He further requests that they be allowed to
enter belligerent ports, which he must by law
proclaim belligerent.
Senator Kenneth McKellar (D.) of Tennessee
has introduced a congressional resolution call
ing for complete repeal of the Neutrality Act.
He said:
"It is in direct conflict with our age-old policy
of freedom of the seas which we have pursued
for more than 100 years and for which we
fought two wars."
By simple reason, a country which is spend
ing billions to promote a Lease-Lend undertak
ing and to aid the anti-Hitler forces, should at
the very minimum write for itself an insurance
policy guaranteeing the goods will not pile up
Senator Kenneth McKellar (D.) of eTnnessee
bottom of it.
"It is time for this country to stop playing into
Hitler's hands and to unshackle our own." These
are the words of the President.
"The arming of merchant. ships under the
repeal of the Neutrality Act would result in the
sinking of less ships and each vessel would
thus ameliorate our shipping situation just that
much." These are the words of Rear Admiral
Emory S. Land.
British, allied and neutral shipping losses in
July, August and September were only one
third of those for the preceding quarter and the
lowest of any similar period in the war. The
Axis losses in the same period increased 150
per cent. These are facts from the lips of Win
ston Churchill. These encouraging statistics
prove that the proposed action will reassure free
seas.
Congress is now considering revision or re
peal or whether to act at all.
Unity is necessary to accomplish the country's
purpose. Unity requires the people's faith, and
their faith will be reassured by legal congres
sional revision or repeal of the Neutrality Act
rather than centralized executive orders which
must circumvent and evade the anachronistic
law.
These proclamations by the President, the
only alternative in event Congress does not act,
weaken the democratic method and add timber
to the isolationist building which houses the
termite thought now undermining our unity.
Isolationists can only be relied upon not to
filibuster away our nation's safety in Congress.
We must deliver the goods. And before the
democratic United States can deliver them to
British or Russian ports, it must make the de

livery legal. Only this way can we crush the
rattlesnake that is poised to strike at America.—
