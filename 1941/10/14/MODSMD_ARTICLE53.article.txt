FALL and winter A.S.S.U. elections consist
ently evoke practically no interest on the part
of Stanford.
We already have an election on our hands.
In fact, we have an election which promises to
be one of the lightest in the history of recent
campus balloting.
Why?
Because, the men and women on this campus
don't care who represents them. They get up
a little interest around spring quarter when the
A.S.S.U. president and some of the gravy jobs
are on the ballot, but there's not much appeal to
a race for Men's Council and B.A.C. representa
tive.
Men's Council doesn't mean much more to
Stanford men than a bunch of guys who rule on
traffic tickets. And the B.A.C. Many of the
student thoughts about this body are unprint
able. Actions of the Board are usually dis
missed with a sigh and a shrug of the shoulders.
Part of this the Board could overcome by bring
ing itself a little closer to the students; but also
the student should insure himself of adequate
representation on the Board. There is no reason
at all for lack of student appreciation of the
importance of Men's Council.
We could remind you to bring your student
body cards and to be sure to vote, but it is
dubious whether such a reminder would do a
cent's worth of good.
It's too bad that we have to admit that this
is the type of student body we have, but there
is no sense in denying the truth—Stanford men
and women don't care.
