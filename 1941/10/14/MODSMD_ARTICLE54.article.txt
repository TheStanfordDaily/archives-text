THE Indians Threw Rocks at Columbus, but
Editorial Board of The Daily is going to throw
more than rocks at staff members if they don't
show up for staff meeting today at 2 o'clock.
And another reasonâ€”Romie has now put the
tryoutees through their paces and this is the
last meeting which will be attended by the
old guards alone. So you better give the Shack
a break while there's still a chance to get a short
Afternoon Club check.
