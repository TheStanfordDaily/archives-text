### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
PLEASE BUY A CHAPPIE
r are many students in school who are inter
ested in writing stories, interested in drawing car
toons, interested in poetry and generally interested in
publishing a magazine, so it is only right that there
be an organized outlet for such students. It is only
right that such students be encouraged, and it is only
right that the best of their work be acknowledged by
publication. And for this reason Stanford students,
every month, publish the Chaparral.
The organization for publishing the magazine is
very informal. There is a little office in the Press
Building, and here interested boys and girls come to
gether, work and laugh and publish the magazine.
There is very little order, there are hardly any rules,
there is no real definite staff; it's just anyone that has
something to contribute, meeting in this office and put
ting out the magazine. And absolutely anyone in the
school that has a story, a poem, a cartoon, or an idea
for a story, a poem, or a cartoon, is extremely welcome
in the little office.

A ND tomorrow the first Chaparral of the year will be
on sale. You will know it because there will be
pretty girls standing in key positions all over the Quad,
promising you almost anything if you will only buy
one of the magazines.
I went up to the Chappie office the other day, both
to see what kind of a magazine the boys had worked
up and to pay for the Chappie window that I had
broken. There was the editor, Barney McClure, a
surprisingly serious looking editor, seated with car
toons, and jokes piled up all around him. I paid him
for the broken window, and then we talked about the
coming Chappie. From the things he showed me, and
the way he talked, I'm sure that everyone should buy
the issue.

/ "kNE thing that I'm sure you'll enjoy is a wonderful
story by Maxwell Myers, the Chappie's sophomore
sensation. Maxwell told me earlier this month that
his story was so good they were giving him a center
spread, which means that it will appear in a very prom
inent position. He also said that it was the best story
he had ever written, and that means something if you
will recall that it was Maxwell who wrote the wonder
ful story with the three endings in a Chaparral issue
last spring.
There will be a couple of new columnists this year.
Ben Miller, who usually hangs around the dramatics
department, will talk about records in the Smoothin'
Around column, and Bob O'Niel will tell you what to
do with a girl under the caption, Now That Date. Then
there are poems by Ed Hutching, who has graduated
but is still contributing, cartoons by Jack Hurt, Bob
Reiser and a sophomore, Jack Ogelsby, and another
story by Gail Mclnerny telling her impressions of
Stanford.
So buy one, because artists should be encouraged,
it only costs 15 cents, and it is nice to be seen talking
to a Stanford woman on the Quad.
