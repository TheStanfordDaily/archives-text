# CAMPUS OPINION
## PRIVATE LIBE? 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
It used to be an empty field. Then some workers
came and dug and made lots of noise. Slowly lots of
steel began to take shape and at last we had the
Hoover Library. But do we have it? No, it is re
served for graduate students and seminar students.
For heaven's sake, do we have to pay $143 per quarter
in order to look at the structure and hear "Jeannie
with the Light Brown Hair," or "I'm a Rambling Wreck
from Georgia Tech," and then go up to the San Fran
cisco Library in order to get a book that only grad
uate students and those in seminars can read inside
the new war library?
Unhappy,
Bill Lrvy
