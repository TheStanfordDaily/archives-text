# Authors Stunt Amusingly On Spanish Rice, Publicity
## 
### 
Two books in the lighter vein: "Intoxication Made Easy" by Elliot
Paul, and "Publicity Is Broccoli" by Constance Hope. Both new releases.
Constance Hope, the press agent for such musical bigwigs as Lily Pons,
Laurence Melchior, and Stokowsky, has decided to spill the beans of
her trade in the book "Publicity Is Broccoli." Purpose is to de-glamorize

the lime-lit stars by exposing the*
secrets of the publicity behind them.
The successful New York press
agent may well have spared her
breath, as most of the American pub
lic is already seemingly capable of
making its own selection in spite
of the floods of propaganda issued
from the offices of Constance Hope
and her ilk.
AMUSING, NO PURPOSE
The fact that the book serves
little or no purpose is, however, no
reason to pass it up. The book is
worth reading merely for the amus
ing writing contained. The real
worth of the book is the low-down
on the actual processes involved in
the making of a great name. This
entails all the hard work of erecting
a hydroelectric dam.
The best little bedtime book ever
printed is the newest ramblings of
Elliot Paul. "Intoxication Made
Easy" is essentially an instruction
book on the preparation of Spanish
rice. It goes into great detail con
cerning the selection of shrimps and
okra, etc., all of which go into the
construction of good Spanish rice. At
this point the author feels the need
of telling his readers about every
thing and the book becomes an ex
cursion into food and philosophy.
STUNT—BUT GOOD
Elliot Paul, who will be remem
bered mainly for his book, "The
Life and Death of a Spanish Town,"
is a European correspondent who
knows Spain and, presumably, Span
ish rice; however, he uses this
( knowledge to trick you into hearing
what he has to say about life and
the Nazis and everything. The book
is a stunt, but it is a good one.
Accompanying Mr. Paul's writ
ings are the marvelous illustrations
of Louis Canteriea.
Oh yes, on the last page is the
recipe for the Spanish rice.—Mull
