# Series to Show Saga of Yukon
## Adventurers Present Film on Trek Tonight 
### 
Bringing the story of their 300-
mile hike through the unchartcd
North country to the campus to
night, Mr. and Mrs. William Albee,
adventurers and lecturers, will show
"Family Afoot in the Yukon Wilds,"
a 60-minute color film, in Memorial
Auditoi'ium at 7:30.
A saga of family life on the trail,
the film portrays the Alboes, in
cluding Billy, 8, and Jo-Evelyn, 5,
on their three-month trip into the
uninhabited Yukon territory, hiking
by day, photographing the northern
scenery, camping at night, and liv
ing off the country for the most
part.
FAMILY SHARES WORK
Mrs. Albee makes the moccasins
they tramp in, cooks with one skil
let and two lard pails, while her
husband bulids a sea-worthy craft,
without rope, using an axe as his
only tool.
The children share in the work
by bringing in supplies of giant
northern currants, lingnen, and blue
berries, and Billy uses a gun to
stock the larder with wild duck and
grouse.
All the equipment used on the
journey was carried on their backs,
and throughout the entire three
months the only supply needed from
the first aid kit was a few bandaids.
HONEYMOON IN ALASKA
â€¢The Albees became acquainted
with the North country 11 years ago
when they hiked to Alaska on their
honeymoon and stayed in an Eskimo
village on Bering Strait for five
years. Last year the National Geo
graphic Society suggested that they
make the 300-mile trip along the
Yukon.
The route they chose had never
been successfully crossed by white
men before and was entirely un
charted. The motion pictures were
taken by all members of the family
in turn.
The Albees will accompany the
film with a lecture on their expe
riences.
The Tuesday Evening Series i.<
presented by the University each
week free of charge, and the lccturef
are open to the public.
