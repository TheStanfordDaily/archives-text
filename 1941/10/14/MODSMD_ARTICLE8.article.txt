# Fraternity Council to Argue Winter Rushing Question
## 
### 
Fate of the all-important winter rushing question will be decided by
24 Stanford fraternity presidents in tonight s Intcrfraternity Council meet
ing in the Nitery at 7:30.
The plan proposes to eliminate rushing entirely in autumn quarter in
favor of an as yet undecided period in the less congested winter quarter.

â€ž Main argument in favor of the
measure is that autumn quarter is
already too congested for the hectic
rushing periods.
The wait also gives fraternities an
opportunity to look at the various
boys' grades before taking any action
upon them. Past experience has
shown, according to Jim Haugh, that
boys going on probation in their
first quarter seldom go plus enough
to live in a house If they do pledge.
Rushing of boys with such low
bawlout averages is bad for _both
the boy and the house.
FINAL ACTION DUE
Against the proposal is the fact
that Christmas vacation will be wide
open for illegal rushing of all types.
The longer period of supposed nofi
contact makes it harder for houses
to resist illegal rushing.
In tonight's session. Council mem
bers will work out the details and
then make a recommendation favor
ing or opposing the plan. The length
of the winter period will also be dis
cussed.
Final action will be taken by the
Interfraterniyt Board in a meeting
Thursday at the Phi Psi house.
PLEDGES ANNOUNCED
Members of the Commissary Board
will meet tonight at 7:30 in the Chi
Psi house. Jack Rittersbocker, Chi
Psi and board chairman, will pre
side.
The Interfraternity Council also
announces the pledging of Gordon
Jacobs', Alpha Delt; Fredric Krause,
Phi Psi; Gordon Covell and Don
Ross, Delt; and Fitch Robertson and
Arthur L. Schmitz, Chi Psi.
