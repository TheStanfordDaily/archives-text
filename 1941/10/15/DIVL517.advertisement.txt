Just a Second
by STU DENT
It takes a lot of pep and spirit
to be a head yell leader like our
human windmill, Joe Messina, en
ergetic Delt.
Joe's job is especially tough be
cause of the Stanford spirit this
year ... He finds a guy has to
move fast to stay ahead of the
rooters.
But his backward "flip"â€”That
gets em ... If it weren't so un
dignified, Stanford women would
turn backward flips and cheer
loudly for the Clothes Closet.
That's bccause the Clothes
Closet, 520 Ramona St., has won
so many victories for Stanford
women in campus clothes, inside
or out, up or down.
