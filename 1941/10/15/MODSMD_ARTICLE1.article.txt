r |MIE Latin Americans are a ro
mantic, but practical people.
You can throw all the mouth-water
ing blondes in Hollywood at them;
you can send them smooth Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. dressed in a Palm
Beach suit and a broad grin; you
can even lend them fabulous Mickey
Rooney to ogle at and vice versa.
They will only smile and say,
"Manana" (from the song of the
same name).
But wave a reciprocal trade
treaty in their direction and they
stop see-sawing, begin si si-ing.
Nobody knows this better than
Cordell Hull. For several years now
Mr. Hull has been busy teaching
both the U.S. and South America
how to be Good Neighbors.
There have been hemispheric
conferences, "good will" missions,
pledges, speech-making, smiling,
Hollywood ambassadors, and much
horsc-laughtcr.
But Cordell flull's efforts are not
best appreciated, though they are
perhaps best known, in the light of
a matinee idol's tour of South
America.

HEMISPHERIC solidarity is. be
coming more than a catchword
or an excuse for a Hollywood pub
licity spree. The recent wholesale
clean-ups in so many Latin America
republics where Nazi elements were
boldly entrenched attest to this fact.
The wooing and winning of South
America has been accomplished by
shrewd politics, shrewder diplo
macy, and cold cash.
Most recent example of this ulti
mate in Good Neighborliness is
the reciprocal trade agreement
signed yesterday in Buenos Aires
between Argentina and this coun
try.
The treaty is the first of its kind
to be signed between the two na
tions since 1853. It was hailed by
Acting-President Castillo as a meas
ure "of overwhelming historical im
portance" and by President Roose
velt and Secretary Hull as new evi
dence of hemispheric solidarity and
a united front against Axis aggres
sion.

RGENTINA was a tough nut to
crack even for the strong fin
gers of the U.S. State Department.
Axis elements in that country are
probably more powerful, more in
fluential than in any other Latin
American republic excepting Brazil.
There are about 200,000 Germans
in the country. It was common
knowledge several months ago that
they were organized into a strong
political party which maintained
army training camps and arsenals
of guns, ammunition, and high ex
plosives.
German influence in the press
and in air transportation indus
tries was also reported as dispro
portionately, dangerously wide
spread.
Recently Argentina has followed
the examples set by her sister re
publics, notably Bolivia, Uruguay,
and (last week) Panama, in delous
ing herself to some extent. She has
taken steps toward repressing over
enthusiastic brothers nf the Bund.

| J')W effective these measures have
been is not known. But the U.S.
State Department is not taking any
chances with an unknown quantity
that is as important as this great
South American republic. Its motto
is, Be a Good Neighbor even if it
hurts.
And it will.
Among the provisions of the new
treaty is one granting tarifT re
ductions on Argentinian canned
beef.
No sooner was the agreement
.signed than western and midwest
ern Senators let up a groan and
yowl that sounded anything but
Neighborly:
They claim their cattle-raising
constituents are being "sacrificed
under the time-worn excuse of a
national emergency" — or so says
Senator Hugh Butler.
, This looks like a set-up for some
blood and thunder oratory. Some
body is being crucified on a cross
of canned beef.

how to be Good Neighbors.

the reciprocal trade agreement

Acting-President Castillo as a meas

a united front against Axis aggres

probably more powerful, more in

HEMISPHERIC solidarity is. be
coming more than a catchword
or an excuse for a Hollywood pub
licity spree. The recent wholesale
clean-ups in so many Latin America
republics where Nazi elements were
boldly entrenched attest to this fact.
The wooing and winning of South
America has been accomplished by
shrewd politics, shrewder diplo
macy, and cold cash.
Most recent example of this ulti
mate in Good Neighborliness is
the reciprocal trade agreement
signed yesterday in Buenos Aires
between Argentina and this coun
try.
The treaty is the first of its kind
to be signed between the two na
tions since 1853. It was hailed by
Acting-President Castillo as a meas
ure "of overwhelming historical im
portance" and by President Roose
velt and Secretary Hull as new evi
dence of hemispheric solidarity and
a united front against Axis aggres
sion.

RGENTINA was a tough nut to
crack even for the strong fin
gers of the U.S. State Department.
Axis elements in that country are
probably more powerful, more in
fluential than in any other Latin
American republic excepting Brazil.
There are about 200,000 Germans
in the country. It was common
knowledge several months ago that
they were organized into a strong
political party which maintained
army training camps and arsenals
of guns, ammunition, and high ex
plosives.
German influence in the press
and in air transportation indus
tries was also reported as dispro
portionately, dangerously wide
spread.
Recently Argentina has followed
the examples set by her sister re
publics, notably Bolivia, Uruguay,
and (last week) Panama, in delous
ing herself to some extent. She has
taken steps toward repressing over
enthusiastic brothers nf the Bund.

| J')W effective these measures have
been is not known. But the U.S.
State Department is not taking any
chances with an unknown quantity
that is as important as this great
South American republic. Its motto
is, Be a Good Neighbor even if it
hurts.
And it will.
Among the provisions of the new
treaty is one granting tarifT re
ductions on Argentinian canned
beef.
No sooner was the agreement
.signed than western and midwest
ern Senators let up a groan and
yowl that sounded anything but
Neighborly:
They claim their cattle-raising
constituents are being "sacrificed
under the time-worn excuse of a
national emergency" — or so says
Senator Hugh Butler.
, This looks like a set-up for some
blood and thunder oratory. Some
body is being crucified on a cross
of canned beef.
