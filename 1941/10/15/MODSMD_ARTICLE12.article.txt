# Taylor, Hammett, Morton Win B.A.C., Men's Council Positions Jim White Made Election Head
## Gene Tunney to Speak at Informal Rally, October 29 at 11 o'Clock; Defense Committee Considered 
### 
.lames White, Sigma Chi, was last night named as this year's chairman
of Election Board by Excom which finally came to a decision after post
poning final selection for two weeks.
"Sweeping changes in our election system at Stanford are now under
consideration," White last night told Excom when being interviewed, "and

I believe that no matter what sys-4
tern we use, definite improvements
should be made in counting of bal
lots and administrative handling."
Humor of the evening was pro
vided by the two sophomore mem
bers of Ex,com, Bob Hopper and
Betty Binns, who reported on cam
pus organizations of "questionable
aim."
FOR QUAD PICTURE
"First on the docket is Axe So
ciety," reported Hopper. "As I un
derstand it, Axe Society held only
one meeting last year, and that was
to pose for their picture for the
Quad."
"I disagree," injected Charley Bull, j
Daily editor. "They met twice—the !
second time to raise money to pay j
for that Quad picture."
Below the humorous note ran se- j
rious concern. Lengthy discussion
was held considering the value of
Axe Society, Phi Phi, and Scalpers.
Rather than jump off the deep end, |
Excom has postponed definite action, !
pro or con, until officers of the or- i
ganization address the Committee
for the defense.
RESULTING BY-LAW
As a result of this discussion, at
the recommendation of Hopper and
Binns, Excom passed a by-law stat- I
ing that: "a trial period of four
quarters be given each new organi
zation, during which time it shall
have full A.S.S.U. privileges but no
charter until it shall be deemed ad
visable by Excom."
Appointed to Drives Committee
which will judge all drives was Irma
Jean Hannibal, who will act as Ex
com l-epresentative.
IVIcKELLAR HELPS
Jim McKellar, student manager,
came forward with plans for the I
S.C. student train, stating that "we !
have purchased $2500 of script be
fore the increased taxes effective
October 1, and therefore we are
saving the students much money."
Plans for a defense committee, to
gather information which will bet
ter fit the college education to the
service, was approved. A chairman
will be appointed next week.
And finally, it was decided that
the Red Cross Drive will be held on
campus Nov. 3 to 6 in conjunction
with the national drive.
Dates approved were: U.S.F. rally,
i Oct. 16; Interclub dinner, Oct. 22;
j Theta Sigma Phi barbecue, Oct. 31;
| A. O. Pi Formal, Nov. 1; Chi Psi in
formal, Nov. 1; Sequoia Club dance,

And finally, it was decided that
the Red Cross Drive will be held on
campus Nov. 3 to 6 in conjunction
with the national drive.
Dates approved were: U.S.F. rally,
i Oct. 16; Interclub dinner, Oct. 22;
j Theta Sigma Phi barbecue, Oct. 31;

.lames White, Sigma Chi, was last night named as this year's chairman
of Election Board by Excom which finally came to a decision after post
poning final selection for two weeks.
"Sweeping changes in our election system at Stanford are now under
consideration," White last night told Excom when being interviewed, "and

I believe that no matter what sys-4
tern we use, definite improvements
should be made in counting of bal
lots and administrative handling."
Humor of the evening was pro
vided by the two sophomore mem
bers of Ex,com, Bob Hopper and
Betty Binns, who reported on cam
pus organizations of "questionable
aim."
FOR QUAD PICTURE
"First on the docket is Axe So
ciety," reported Hopper. "As I un
derstand it, Axe Society held only
one meeting last year, and that was
to pose for their picture for the
Quad."
"I disagree," injected Charley Bull, j
Daily editor. "They met twice—the !
second time to raise money to pay j
for that Quad picture."
Below the humorous note ran se- j
rious concern. Lengthy discussion
was held considering the value of
Axe Society, Phi Phi, and Scalpers.
Rather than jump off the deep end, |
Excom has postponed definite action, !
pro or con, until officers of the or- i
ganization address the Committee
for the defense.
RESULTING BY-LAW
As a result of this discussion, at
the recommendation of Hopper and
Binns, Excom passed a by-law stat- I
ing that: "a trial period of four
quarters be given each new organi
zation, during which time it shall
have full A.S.S.U. privileges but no
charter until it shall be deemed ad
visable by Excom."
Appointed to Drives Committee
which will judge all drives was Irma
Jean Hannibal, who will act as Ex
com l-epresentative.
IVIcKELLAR HELPS
Jim McKellar, student manager,
came forward with plans for the I
S.C. student train, stating that "we !
have purchased $2500 of script be
fore the increased taxes effective
October 1, and therefore we are
saving the students much money."
Plans for a defense committee, to
gather information which will bet
ter fit the college education to the
service, was approved. A chairman
will be appointed next week.
And finally, it was decided that
the Red Cross Drive will be held on
