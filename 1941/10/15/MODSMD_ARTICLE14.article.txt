# FRATERNITIES DEFER RUSHING
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Autumn rushing ;it Stanford for
the 1941-42 school your pasesd into
oblivion last night as the Stanford
I Intcrfratcrnity Council unanimously
| voted the proposed winter quarter
( rushing plan into existence.
1 Oidy three houses were opposed to
j the move in the final ballot and all
j of these quickly withdrew their op
position in face of the popular de
mand.
ROW ACCEPTANCE
"Lots of enthusiasm for the plan
I has been seen along the Row," com
| mented Interfraternity President Jim
Haugh upon the acceptance of the
plan. More than half of the house
presidents reported unanimous ac
ceptance of the plan in Monday
house meetings.
The plan will now be carried for-
I ward to a meeting of the Stanford
1 Interfraternity Board Thursday
! night at the Chi Psi -house, where
j details will be worked out. "The
I board will work out rules for strict
punishment of violators," said Prexy
Haugh.
WINTER RUSHING
The actual rushing plan itself was
I laid in the laps of the rushing com
| mittee under the direction of Colin

! McClintock. According to McClin
tock, a plan has already been
! worked out for autumn quarter and
it probably will simply be shifted
over to winter.
Chairman Haugh started the meet
ing with a preliminary roll call on
, the plan and found of the 23 pres
i ent, two were opposed, four neutral,
and seventeen favored the plan.
With this vote as a basis for dis
cussion, arguments pro and con
were brought up.
TO All) SCHOLARSHIP
Rushing Chairman McClintock
brought up the fact that rushing
i starts just as the already too
crowded autumn quarter begins to
intensify. He nAdcd that winter
rushing will tend to balance activi
ties.
The general low scholarship in
autumn quarter also was empha
sized by Haugh, who added that G7
j fraternity pledges went minus au
: tumn quarter last year, and 85 in
1939.
FINES TO BE IMPOSED
Strongest argument against the
: proposal was the fear of increased
| illegal rushing. "Illegal rushing,
however, rests upon each house,"
answered Satidy Tatuin, Zete. "Each

house must decide not to engage in
illegal rushing activities."
Houses can now be fined up to
$100 for illegal rushing, said Haugh.
At this point, the statement that
"little things add up to a good
pledge class in illegal rushing" was
heard.
Best way to combat this, the
Council agreed, was to impress the
freshmen with the fact that they
will be as guilty as the house in this
matter. Freshmen must realize, said
Tatum, that this is a direct violation
of rules.
Penalties meted out to freshman
offenders by the Encina Council and
publication of the names of the
houses and the individual offenders
were suggested as the best means
' of combatting illegal contacts. Final
action on violations was left to the
board meeting Thursday with Haugh
promising that "we will guarantee to
punish violations strictly."
As the short 45-minute meeting
was adjourned, both Haugh and Mc-
Clintock again emphasized the rule
that there shall be no rushing this
quarter of new lower division men â€”
freshmen and sophomores." No con
tacts of any nature can be made,"
i they said.-
