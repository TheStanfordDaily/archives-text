# Bobby Socks, Pigtails Okayed On Quad; But Girls, Behave!
## 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Will national defense undermine the stamina of Stanford women this
winter? Will an addition have to be built to the Women's Rest Home?
Will pneumonia strike down our girls walking to early morning classes
with the rain whipping at their bare legs?
A survey was conducted on the question yesterday and The Daily tan

definitely say tnat tnc snori sox
are hero to stay, come the howling
rain, pneumonia or what may.
In fact the short socks now have
the approval of Women's Conference,
Miss Yost's office, the women and the
(tacit) approval of the men. And
everybody is more or less happy
about the whole thing now.
In commenting on the change,
Miss Yost remarked that as for
wearing the socks and the pigtails
(which are another popular fad at
the moment) on the campus, it was
perfectly all right as long as the
girls themselves did not indicate
the trend of mind otic usually asso
ciates with braids and bobby socks.
Women's Conference, after hold
ing a special meeting to decide what
the ruling would be concerning the
short socks, decided that in view of
the serious silk shortage facing the
nation, it would not be a violation
of the honor code (since Mrs. Stan
ford requested that all students be
properly attired at the same time she
asked that there be no smoking on
the Quad) to wear short socks on
the Quad.
At a large tea held yesterday and
attended by faculty wives arid alum
nae, the question of short socks or
the traditional long stockings on the
undergraduate was asked them and
the vote was overwhelmingly in
favor of the socks. (This from some
who were graduated in the 'nine
ties.)
The women, the chief instigators
of the fad, are all for it. A large
dress shop reported that although
purchases of stockings still lead,
Stanford women are purchasing an
increased number of the bobby socks.
(The pale paslel woolly kind, with
their initials on them.)
Now we get down to the men,
' whose opinion really matters. It, will
be sufficient to say that they all
approve, without including some of
the comments made. Although one
of those questioned did ponder a
minute whether it was a matter for
the Honor Code, he soon got his bet
ter senses back.

Will national defense undermine the stamina of Stanford women this
winter? Will an addition have to be built to the Women's Rest Home?
Will pneumonia strike down our girls walking to early morning classes
with the rain whipping at their bare legs?
A survey was conducted on the question yesterday and The Daily tan

definitely say tnat tnc snori sox
are hero to stay, come the howling
rain, pneumonia or what may.
In fact the short socks now have
the approval of Women's Conference,
Miss Yost's office, the women and the
(tacit) approval of the men. And
everybody is more or less happy
about the whole thing now.
In commenting on the change,
Miss Yost remarked that as for
wearing the socks and the pigtails
(which are another popular fad at
the moment) on the campus, it was
perfectly all right as long as the
girls themselves did not indicate
the trend of mind otic usually asso
ciates with braids and bobby socks.
Women's Conference, after hold
ing a special meeting to decide what
the ruling would be concerning the
short socks, decided that in view of
the serious silk shortage facing the
nation, it would not be a violation
of the honor code (since Mrs. Stan
ford requested that all students be
properly attired at the same time she
asked that there be no smoking on
the Quad) to wear short socks on
the Quad.
At a large tea held yesterday and
attended by faculty wives arid alum
nae, the question of short socks or
the traditional long stockings on the
undergraduate was asked them and
the vote was overwhelmingly in
favor of the socks. (This from some
who were graduated in the 'nine
ties.)
The women, the chief instigators
of the fad, are all for it. A large
dress shop reported that although
purchases of stockings still lead,
Stanford women are purchasing an
increased number of the bobby socks.
(The pale paslel woolly kind, with
their initials on them.)
Now we get down to the men,
' whose opinion really matters. It, will
be sufficient to say that they all
approve, without including some of
the comments made. Although one
of those questioned did ponder a
minute whether it was a matter for
the Honor Code, he soon got his bet
ter senses back.
