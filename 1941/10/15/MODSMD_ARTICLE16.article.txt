# Dance Try outs Begin Monday

### 
Dance try outs for the 1941 Gaie
ties big routine will begin on Mon
day of next week, announced Asher
Wilson, director of this year's show,
yesterday.
Wilson, in issuing his call, particu
larly emphasized the need for male
dancers. "We need all the men that
we can get hold of for this routine,"
he said, "and we can guarantee all
those who make the grade in these
tryouts another spot in the show."
The deadline for Gaieties scripts
falls today and Wilson is hoping
that this will bring in a flock of last
minute material which can be in
corporated into his production. The
Gaieties, according to its director,
can still use skits with "punch" and
this means that aspiring writers still
have plenty of opportunity to have
their work used in the big show.
As to songs Wilson is optimistic.
The Gaieties chief stated that he had
received two or three very good
smooth tunes, several good dance
songs, and a couple of hot jive num
bers. Wilson also said his show had
"one good blues tunc."
