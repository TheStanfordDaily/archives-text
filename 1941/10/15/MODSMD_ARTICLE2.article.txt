# Nazis Drive To 60 Miles Of Moscow
## City Half-Encircled By 3 German Armies; Caucasus in Danger 
### United Press 
German armies with "now or
never" orders disdained heavy losses
and smashed to within <>0 miles of
threatened Moscow from three di
rections today, the Russians them
selves admitted, and Berlin claimed
the outer defenses of the Red capi
tal already were under Nazi artillery
fire.
In an accompanying sweep east
ward along the Azov seashore in the
far south, another strong German
army had captured and passed the
port of Mariupol, 100 miles from the
Rostov gateway to the Caucasus.
The latest official Soviet commu
nique thus admitted that the best
efforts of Russian reinforcements had
failed to stop the Nazi onrush to
ward the capital and that the vital
front in the far south was falling to
pieces. Moscow was half encircled,
at distances varying from about 60
miles to approximately 100 miles, and
German tanks and dive bombers
were battering their way forward
along four main approaches.
'LOSSES TERRIFIC'
The Russians insisted that Ger
man losses were terrific, claimed that
Soviet aviation commanded the air
and spoke of furious Russian coun
ter-attacks—one of which threw the
Germans back 11 miles—but still
the Nazi hordes advanced nearer
the city.
The gigantic scale of the bloody
conflict was indicated by Nazi claims
to the taking of 500,000 prisoners
during the present offensive, raising
the number of Russian prisoners
claimed to over 3,000.000 and total
Soviet casualties in 115 days to
6,000.000.
WHAT THEY SAY
The situation at these points, as
claimed by each side:
1. Moscow claimed the four
pronged German attack had been
thrown back 11 miles at one point,
63 to 70 miles west of the City in the
vicinity of Mozhaisk and Borodino,
to which the Russians fell back
after evacuating Vyazma. Eight
miles of this gain was held in the
face of heavy German counter-at
tacks and the Russians were in
strong positions.
To the southwest, near Bryansk,
Red armies were said to be beating
back fresh German attacks. Near
Orel, to the south, Soviet counter
attacks were reported clipping off
probing German panzer thrusts and
holding up Nazi attempts to ad
vance.
2. Berlin claimed that German
long-range guns "probably more
than 62 miles" from Moscow were
shelling the city's outer defenses
and that the Nazi armies were roll
ing forward on all sectors, at the
same time hacking to pieces "pock
ets'' of Russians trapped behind the
present lighting iiont.

and smashed to within <>0 miles of
threatened Moscow from three di
rections today, the Russians them
selves admitted, and Berlin claimed
the outer defenses of the Red capi
tal already were under Nazi artillery
fire.
In an accompanying sweep east
ward along the Azov seashore in the
far south, another strong German
army had captured and passed the
port of Mariupol, 100 miles from the
Rostov gateway to the Caucasus.
The latest official Soviet commu
nique thus admitted that the best
efforts of Russian reinforcements had
failed to stop the Nazi onrush to
ward the capital and that the vital
front in the far south was falling to
pieces. Moscow was half encircled,
at distances varying from about 60
miles to approximately 100 miles, and
German tanks and dive bombers
were battering their way forward
along four main approaches.
'LOSSES TERRIFIC'
The Russians insisted that Ger
man losses were terrific, claimed that
Soviet aviation commanded the air
and spoke of furious Russian coun
ter-attacks—one of which threw the
Germans back 11 miles—but still
the Nazi hordes advanced nearer
the city.
The gigantic scale of the bloody
conflict was indicated by Nazi claims
to the taking of 500,000 prisoners
during the present offensive, raising
the number of Russian prisoners
claimed to over 3,000.000 and total
Soviet casualties in 115 days to
6,000.000.
WHAT THEY SAY
The situation at these points, as
claimed by each side:
1. Moscow claimed the four
pronged German attack had been
thrown back 11 miles at one point,
63 to 70 miles west of the City in the
vicinity of Mozhaisk and Borodino,
to which the Russians fell back
after evacuating Vyazma. Eight
miles of this gain was held in the
face of heavy German counter-at
tacks and the Russians were in
strong positions.
To the southwest, near Bryansk,
Red armies were said to be beating
back fresh German attacks. Near
Orel, to the south, Soviet counter
attacks were reported clipping off
probing German panzer thrusts and
holding up Nazi attempts to ad
vance.
2. Berlin claimed that German
long-range guns "probably more
than 62 miles" from Moscow were
shelling the city's outer defenses
and that the Nazi armies were roll
ing forward on all sectors, at the
same time hacking to pieces "pock
ets'' of Russians trapped behind the
present lighting iiont.
German armies with "now or
never" orders disdained heavy losses
and smashed to within <>0 miles of
threatened Moscow from three di
rections today, the Russians them
selves admitted, and Berlin claimed
the outer defenses of the Red capi
tal already were under Nazi artillery
fire.
