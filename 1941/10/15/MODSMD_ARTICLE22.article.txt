Young, naive, and modest about
their accomplishments, the Albees
described scenes of their daily eight
to twelve-mile progress through
wild but picturesque mountainous
lake country where it was sometimes
necessary to make bridges over riv
ers by felling tall spruce trees across
them, and to cross treacherous ex
panses of burnt-over forest land.
Although they frequently saw
moose on the three-month journey
and found fresh traces of wolves and
bear, the worst menace was the mos
quitoes, which increased in number
after rain which fell a third of the
time, Mr. Albee said.

Contending that any young couple
can find happiness in the vast ex
panses of uninhabited territory along
the Yukon, Ruth and William Albee
showed the film they made last sum
mer on their 300-mile hike through
the north country with their chil
dren, "Family Afoot in the Yukon
Wilds," last night in Memorial Au
ditorium for the Tuesday Series
audience.
"These regions are not reserved
for seasoned explorers, but for any
one with the true American pioneer
ing spirit," Mr. Albee said in the
lecture that he shared with his wife
as they commented on the (iO-min
itte film.
J JFK IN WILDS
Young, naive, and modest about
their accomplishments, the Albees
described scenes of their daily eight
to twelve-mile progress through
wild but picturesque mountainous
lake country where it was sometimes
necessary to make bridges over riv
ers by felling tall spruce trees across
them, and to cross treacherous ex
panses of burnt-over forest land.
Although they frequently saw
moose on the three-month journey
and found fresh traces of wolves and
bear, the worst menace was the mos
quitoes, which increased in number
after rain which fell a third of the
time, Mr. Albee said.

With scenes showing expert camp
ing technique were pictures of the
magnificent north woods, lakes,
and wild flowers.
"Ruth married me to travel and
T married Ruth to settle down," Mr.
Albee laughed. "So in accordance
with American custom we traveled,
making our first trip to Alaska im
mediately after our marriage—and
stayed for five years."

ministered an Indian reservation for
