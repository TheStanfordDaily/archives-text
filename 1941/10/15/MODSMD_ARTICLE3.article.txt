WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt, confident that
lend-lease aid ultimately will defeat
the Axi.s, revealed today that deliv
eries under the program during Sep
tember were nearly triple the aver
age deliveries during the preceding
six months.
He emphasized at his press con
ference that the $155,000,000 value of
September deliveries represented
only a portion of actual war mate
rials shipped to nations resisting
aggression, since Russia is paying
for all armaments purchased in the
United States and Britain still is
paying for a large share of her .ship
ments.
Meanwhile in the Senate, an offi
cial navy report to the Naval Affairs
Committee revealed tonight that the
attempted torpedoing of the Ameri
can destroyer Greer on Sept. 4 was
preceded by an attack by a British
airplane upon the German U-boat
involved.
According to the report, written by
Admiral Harold R. Stark, chief of
naval operations, uie Greer was in
formed by the British plane of the
presence of a submerged submarine
10 miles ahead on its course.
