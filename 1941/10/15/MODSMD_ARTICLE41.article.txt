# Polo Squad Meets Moffett Field
## 
### 
Another hurdle in their drive for a
winning season meets the Stanford
polo team this afternoon at 4 when
Farm horsemen tangle with a squad
of officers from Moffett Field.
Dirker, Gates, Snure, and Grana
will be the opening quartet for
Stanford, and Lieutenant Robert
Ranzoni, Farm coach, will referee
the contest.
The local squad defeated Berkeley
Polo Club, 8-3 Saturday, and will
meet a team from California Agri
cultural School on Friday, also at 4.
Manager Bob Merchant hopes for a
record season in Farm polo for
1941-42, and would appreciate all
support of interested students toward
that end.

Finishing the season with a .400
average, Ted Williams led the Amer
ican League in hitting.
