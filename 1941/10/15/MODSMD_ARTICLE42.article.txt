# Red Gridders Lay for U.S.F.
## 
### 
Yesterday's intensive passing drill
indicated that Coach Shaughnessy is
going to make full use 'of Frankie
Albert's throwing arm while the
All-American quarterback is still
around.
A lot of second-guessers have been
urging more use of Stanford's power
runners but there are only four
more home games in which to watch
Albert and a brilliant passer like
Frankie doesn't show up every year.
For the past two days now, the
Cards have been concentrating on
the aerial attack, planning to exploit
S.F.U.'s main weakness as uncovered
Sunday by Podesto of Modesto.
Hank Norberg showed up yes
terday in a suit, still showing a
noticeable limp. Arnie Meiners
and Pete Kmetovic, neither boy
expecting to see much action this |
week-end, looked on from t lie
sidelines.
Running off Don formations,
Husky Hunt's reserves scrimmaged
a second-third team run by Phil
Bengtson and Marchie Schwartz.
The San Francisco plays didn't seem
to bewilder anyone.
Harry Shipkey hopes to send his
frosh against Husky's "Blacks" in a
preliminary game at the stadium Sat
urday although the game is not defi
nitely arranged. The freshmen have
been hard put to find competition,
with the Brubabes dropping football
and the Moffett Field "B" team re
fusing to come to terms.
In the "A unit" workout, Albert
was hitting his receivers hard with
bullet spot passes and dropping
them in nicely with his men on the
dead run. With a familiar, dry field
to operate on, the Indians may give
a real aerial exhibition Saturday. Al
bert seems to be able to throw all
afternoon without wearing out his
arm and Coach Shaughnessy had j
occasion to commend Frankie for his
timing and judgment in yesterday's
drill.

Hank Norberg showed up yes
terday in a suit, still showing a
noticeable limp. Arnie Meiners
and Pete Kmetovic, neither boy
expecting to see much action this |
week-end, looked on from t lie
sidelines.
Running off Don formations,
Husky Hunt's reserves scrimmaged
a second-third team run by Phil
Bengtson and Marchie Schwartz.
The San Francisco plays didn't seem
to bewilder anyone.
Harry Shipkey hopes to send his
frosh against Husky's "Blacks" in a
preliminary game at the stadium Sat
urday although the game is not defi
nitely arranged. The freshmen have
been hard put to find competition,
with the Brubabes dropping football
and the Moffett Field "B" team re
fusing to come to terms.
In the "A unit" workout, Albert
was hitting his receivers hard with
bullet spot passes and dropping
them in nicely with his men on the
dead run. With a familiar, dry field
to operate on, the Indians may give
a real aerial exhibition Saturday. Al
bert seems to be able to throw all
afternoon without wearing out his
arm and Coach Shaughnessy had j
occasion to commend Frankie for his
timing and judgment in yesterday's
drill.
