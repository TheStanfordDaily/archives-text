ROWLING over Bakersfield J. C., Long Beach J. C., and Southern Cali
fornia Trobabes, Stanford's Papeese have established themselves as a
great frosh team, with many likely prospects who may make a place on the
Big Red Machine ol '42.
Regardless of the outcome of this year's varsity in the grid wars, when
spring practice rolls around Clark Shaughnessy will be on the lookout for
! men to fill the departing sandals of his senior stars Frankie Albert, Pete
1 Kmetovic, Art Meiners, Doug Stable, Vic Lindskog, Ken Robesky, and
Freddy Meyer.
* * » n<
JY'VEN though his reserves are strong, Coach Clark needs more just like
) 'em for the '42 conquest up de Rose Bowl glory road.
And the frosh have just the boys to till the bill.
At halfback (here's Jim Pettit, as great a pass snatcher and nifty open
field runner as you'll find anywhere. Five feet eleven and 170 pounds,
I Pettit snagged three touchdown passes Saturday against S.C.
Pettit will probably do battle for the left half position with A1 Cole and
Joe Mardesich.
* # * *
AT quarterback to fight it out with Ray Hammett and Bob Mitchell, who
will probably shift to the signal-calling spot next year, is Cannon Park
inson. first-string quarter on the Card yearlings.
Parkinson fired the three aerials that connected to Pettit in the
25-U win over the Trobabes. Passing seems his best department, and he
does pretty well on concealing the ball during Shipkey's T for Trickery
movement.
Right behind Parkinson is liobby Andrews, San Marino boy, whose
signal-calling ability excels. He knows just the right play at the right
time.

r pHERE are a flock of men all on equal terms at the other halfback.
Fred Parsons heads the list, with Don Zappettini, Fred Sandcrman.
and Ross Dana to boot.
Parsons appears the speediest man on the squad, while Zappettini
hails from the Piedmont High wonder team and is fast going places as a
T back.
Shipkey has under his wing two solid, hard-driving fulllbacks,
Clement Woods and Dave Pate. Woods comes from Beverly Hills,
where he learned football from Walt Herriod of Notre Dame. Pale
showed himself as a great line crasher in the Bakersfield game, and
Woods, as a slashing type of runner in the same fray.
* * * *
•*
j DON'T have to go far to pick the standouts in the Papoose forward
wall.
Flanked at the ends by Dave "Bomber" Brown, Jack Ileald, and Pete
August, are enough good guards and tackles to keep 'em coming in an
endless stream. There's Jack Sogorka, Burt Avery, Sandy Atherlon (he
can't miss). Ward Cuminings, and Bill Siguardson at guards; Jim Cowin,
Bill Young, Harry Ferris, Harvey Bernhard, and Dave Porter, tackles.
Center man on the frosh T from now on will be Jack McCurdy, injured
earlier, but now ready to go and really drive. Neele Johnston and I'rank
Moulton have been at center in McCurdy's absence, both seeing action
against S.C.

day next spring Shipkey will turn over his squad to Shaughnessy.
and the Indian varsity will again start building up for another invasion
of P.C.C. honors.
And every man that shows up that day will have the T drilled into
hini from head to foot and hack again. He'll know it cold.
So the Shaughnee Warriors won't be held back one instant in learning
their assignments. There'll be no worries from a squad changing from a
Notre Dame style to the T. ,
Shaughnessy will he "fat."

MERRIWELL, the mythical man who has finished so many
! ~ things with a miracle wing-ding, will no doubt live again when the
| P.C.C. football season comes to a close.
Stanford is in a favorable spot.
Mathematical chances don't favor the Redshirts this time, but the
Oregon-Oregon State on Nov. 29 tussle does. The webfootcd men were
knocking on the door when Stanford won its opener, 19-15.
And they may knock the skids from under Oregon Staters. If they do,
and the Redskins finish the season undefeated, we'll see you in the Rose
Bowl, Joel. ,
To sunny southern Cal. where the sun shines frequently, and at times
very hotly, the Stanford frosh had to go to beat the Trobabes.
So torrid was it last Saturday that one Übangi met another in the Coli
i seum and spoke rapidly and thusly:

inson. first-string quarter on the Card yearlings.
Parkinson fired the three aerials that connected to Pettit in the
25-U win over the Trobabes. Passing seems his best department, and he
does pretty well on concealing the ball during Shipkey's T for Trickery
movement.
Right behind Parkinson is liobby Andrews, San Marino boy, whose
signal-calling ability excels. He knows just the right play at the right
time.

and Ross Dana to boot.
Parsons appears the speediest man on the squad, while Zappettini
hails from the Piedmont High wonder team and is fast going places as a
T back.
Shipkey has under his wing two solid, hard-driving fulllbacks,
Clement Woods and Dave Pate. Woods comes from Beverly Hills,
where he learned football from Walt Herriod of Notre Dame. Pale
showed himself as a great line crasher in the Bakersfield game, and
Woods, as a slashing type of runner in the same fray.

Parsons appears the speediest man on the squad, while Zappettini
hails from the Piedmont High wonder team and is fast going places as a
T back.
Shipkey has under his wing two solid, hard-driving fulllbacks,
Clement Woods and Dave Pate. Woods comes from Beverly Hills,
where he learned football from Walt Herriod of Notre Dame. Pale
showed himself as a great line crasher in the Bakersfield game, and
Woods, as a slashing type of runner in the same fray.

Flanked at the ends by Dave "Bomber" Brown, Jack Ileald, and Pete

endless stream. There's Jack Sogorka, Burt Avery, Sandy Atherlon (he
can't miss). Ward Cuminings, and Bill Siguardson at guards; Jim Cowin,
Bill Young, Harry Ferris, Harvey Bernhard, and Dave Porter, tackles.
Center man on the frosh T from now on will be Jack McCurdy, injured
earlier, but now ready to go and really drive. Neele Johnston and I'rank
Moulton have been at center in McCurdy's absence, both seeing action
against S.C.

day next spring Shipkey will turn over his squad to Shaughnessy.

of P.C.C. honors.
And every man that shows up that day will have the T drilled into

their assignments. There'll be no worries from a squad changing from a

Parkinson fired the three aerials that connected to Pettit in the
25-U win over the Trobabes. Passing seems his best department, and he
does pretty well on concealing the ball during Shipkey's T for Trickery
