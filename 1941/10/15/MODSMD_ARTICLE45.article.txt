# Georgia Offense Standby to Play
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 14 (UP).â€”Word
comes by advance courier that
Frank Sinkwich will play for Geor
gia against Columbia here this Sat
urday although he may go into the
game looking slightly like the
battleship Massachusetts under con
struction.
Frankie being some nine-tenths of
the Georgia offense, all means of
medication from electric welding to
tree surgery have been consulted
since he broke his jaw in the South
Carolina game.
