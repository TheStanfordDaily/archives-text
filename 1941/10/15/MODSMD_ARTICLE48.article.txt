# Card Hoopmen Begin Training
## 
### 
Stanford athletic teams are famed
for their conditioning and the var
sity basketball team is no exception
to the fact. Last season, as ardent
hoop fans can testify, the players al
ways had enough for that final el
fort when they needed it.
Right now with King Football in
tlie driver's seat other sports are
somewhat out of the news, but not
in total oblivion. The basketballers
i have already commenced work in
: quest of a repeat snare on the con
! ference hoop crown.
At present their work merely con
! sists of getting that all-important
I aforementioned conditioning. The
varsity works out three times a
i week, as do the frosh aspirants.
The training routine consists of a
| "2-2-2" around the soccer field, two
laps' distance, two sprint, two sprint
! and two zig-zag.
Alter this the boys then adjourn
to either the volleyball court or the
| softball court. Rather a novel con
j ditioning means but effective.
The respective squads will con
j tinue this training schedule until the
I first of November and then move in
i side to the pavilion for more exten
! sive drills and work.
