CORVALLIS. Ore., Oct. 14 (UP).
â€”The Oregon State Beavers, whose
Rose Bowl hopes have burgeoned
since they stopped Stanford last
week, had another easy day of it
today. The Beavers have an open
date this week-end but Coach Lon
Stiner said he plans to scrimmage
the boys tomorrow and Friday in
preparation for Washington State
the following Saturday.
The team physician reported
Quentin Greenough, center who was
carried out of the Stanford game
on a stretcher, has a dislocated fib
ula, just below the knee, but is ex
pected to be okay in a week or two.
