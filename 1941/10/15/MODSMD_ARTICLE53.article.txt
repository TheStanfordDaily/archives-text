# Flick That Switch
## 
### 
THROUGH a Pacific Gas and Electric power
sub-station behind campus pass the millions
of kilowatts of electricity used by Stanford each
year. And on the books at the end of each year
is an electric bill of nearly $50,000. (Almost
equal to the total tuition paid by students for
autumn quarter this year.)
For this electricity Stanford pays a special
institutional rate. The per-kilowatt price is a fair
rate, although the Administration believes it
could be lower and is taking action along this
line.
The crux of the electric problem, however, is
not the rate being paid, although it is a contrib
uting factor, but the extreme waste of electricity
on campus.
Worst offenders are residents of campus halls.
A survey in Encina, Branner, and Toyon reveals
an amazing negligence in turning off lights
when residents are not in the rooms. And even
when men are in their rooms, generally there
is an unnecessary light burning in the sleeping
porch, dressing room, or above the wash basin.
Nor are women of Roble, Lagunita, or the
Union units above reproach. Untold dollars are
wasted each year when lights are left burning
as the women go on 2:3o's and 12 o'clocks.
For comparison, ask members of the frater
nity or sorority houses if they leave lights burn
ing unnecessarily. No, they don't. They con
serve electricity, since a part of their house bill
goes to the power company. House managers
do not let residents forget this.
This is probably the key to the entire prob
lem: hall men and women do not realize that
indirectly they pay the power bill. Last year
Encina men contributed $2.91 each to the elec
tric company; Lagunita women each paid 52.64.
(Indicating a higher degree of male negligence.)
In addition, care has not been exercised when
studying in Quad rooms at night, in the Nitery,
or in departmental libraries.
If Stanford's operating expenses rise with the
general increase in prices throughout the coun
try, as is expected, room rent as well as tuition
will join this general trend. However, if econo
mies, such as saving electricity, are effected
through student co-operation, substantial in
creases may be avoided.
As much as 10 per cent of Stanford's light bill
—55,000 a year—can probably be saved. It's
simply a matter of a little consideration, an ex
tra minute, a flick of the finger.
Faculty members have done and are doing
their part. Last year the Administration asked
them to help conserve electricity in lecture
rooms and laboratories. And, according to Fi
nancial Vice-President Frank F. Walker, this
campaign is proving highly successful.
Now it's up to us.
However, a daily reminder of this minor task
would undoubtedly be helpful. We suggest that
a little sign be posted by the Administration in
every dormitory and classroom, reading:

"PLEASE TURN OFF THE LlGHTS."—Herman

THROUGH a Pacific Gas and Electric power
sub-station behind campus pass the millions
of kilowatts of electricity used by Stanford each
year. And on the books at the end of each year
is an electric bill of nearly $50,000. (Almost
equal to the total tuition paid by students for
autumn quarter this year.)
For this electricity Stanford pays a special
institutional rate. The per-kilowatt price is a fair
rate, although the Administration believes it
could be lower and is taking action along this
line.
The crux of the electric problem, however, is
not the rate being paid, although it is a contrib
uting factor, but the extreme waste of electricity
on campus.
Worst offenders are residents of campus halls.
A survey in Encina, Branner, and Toyon reveals
an amazing negligence in turning off lights
when residents are not in the rooms. And even
when men are in their rooms, generally there
is an unnecessary light burning in the sleeping
porch, dressing room, or above the wash basin.
Nor are women of Roble, Lagunita, or the
Union units above reproach. Untold dollars are
wasted each year when lights are left burning
as the women go on 2:3o's and 12 o'clocks.
For comparison, ask members of the frater
nity or sorority houses if they leave lights burn
ing unnecessarily. No, they don't. They con
serve electricity, since a part of their house bill
goes to the power company. House managers
do not let residents forget this.
This is probably the key to the entire prob
lem: hall men and women do not realize that
indirectly they pay the power bill. Last year
Encina men contributed $2.91 each to the elec
tric company; Lagunita women each paid 52.64.
(Indicating a higher degree of male negligence.)
In addition, care has not been exercised when
studying in Quad rooms at night, in the Nitery,
or in departmental libraries.
If Stanford's operating expenses rise with the
general increase in prices throughout the coun
try, as is expected, room rent as well as tuition
will join this general trend. However, if econo
mies, such as saving electricity, are effected
through student co-operation, substantial in
creases may be avoided.
As much as 10 per cent of Stanford's light bill
—55,000 a year—can probably be saved. It's
simply a matter of a little consideration, an ex
tra minute, a flick of the finger.
Faculty members have done and are doing
their part. Last year the Administration asked
them to help conserve electricity in lecture
rooms and laboratories. And, according to Fi
nancial Vice-President Frank F. Walker, this
campaign is proving highly successful.
Now it's up to us.
