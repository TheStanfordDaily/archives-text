# "Switch"
## 
### 
NEWSMAGAZINE Time this week took time
out for a couple of columns under the
slightly misleading head "Education" to note
the rather startling fact that college students
have changed their way of thinking in the past
few months.

All over the country new men have taken
over the editors' chairs in college dailies. Simul
taneously, spontaneously editorial policies have
made an abrupt about-face.
Our thoughts here at Stanford have changed.
Wo have noticed here and there other switches,
but we had no idea it was so general as brought
out by Time.
And Time's editors seemed puzzled at what
had "apparently convinced" us, at what had
made us drop like a hot potato the lofty ideal
isms of our predecessors who were sincere in

their isolationist beliefs.
Isolationist thinking had a legitimate part to
play then. The destiny of America was not clear
then as it is now.
It should not be so puzzling. The "switch" is
born of a common-sense realization that a Hitler
dominated Europe is a very definite menace to
this country, that America has an integral part
to play in the necessary realignment of world
politics.
The Princetonian, student daily, formerly 100
per cent isolationist, best expressed the senti
ments involved in the following editorial ex
tract:
"We believe . . . that the VALID debate is
over, that isolationists in large measure now
amount to merely obstructionists. ... We
urge these people to examine their own con
sciences, to ask themselves as democratic
citizens if it were not better for democracy
that they yield, as we have yielded." .
A college daily not mentioned by Time was
the Daily Pennsylvanian, which recently de
clared:
"We make no bones about it. .. We are for
intervention.
"This is not a hasty conclusion drawn by a
tew warmongers too old to fight, nor is it the
work of pups easily swayed by flags and
bands and ideals. It is rather the result of
careful deliberation on the part of some of
those who will do the fighting, and who, more
important, will do the living in the America
of the future."
The fact of the matter is that we are already
in the war, as Dr. Eliot Blackwelder stated re
cently in The Daily. We are supporting the
century-old doctrine of freedom of the seas, es
poused by America since the founding of the
country. We are truly keeping the seas open be
tween here and our farthest outpost of Iceland.
We realize that our archaic Neutrality Act must
be repealed.
Why should we blindfold ourselves?
Why should college editors be any different
from the 70 per cent of our population (accord
ing to a Gallup poll last week) who have de
cided that it is more important to defeat Hitler
than to keep out of the war?

When one can feel fear and not be afraid
he has developed courage.â€”President Harold
W. Dodds of Princeton
