### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
TIIE PEOPLE YOU MEET
T HE serious, young woman in Wilson's, carefully
looking all around her, then tilting her head back
and using nose drops is the head of Roble, Sylvia
Berry. The young woman in the trim brown suit, with
one arm in a sling, shouting to the obedient and re
sponsive crowd, "I was trying to shoot a gun, a gun
mind you," is Isabel Fawcett of Excom and other
fames.
The tall blonde-haired boy who you always see in
the library is not Timothy Hopkins but is Bob Comp
ton, whose Bawlout standing reads 51 plus 102. And
the mysterious man in the worn, grey flannel suit, with
brown dark glasses, who rides a bicycle and always
hurries through the library, no one knows who he is.
And the tall, thin sensitive looking man who wears a
striped suit and continually hums aloud, no one knows
who he is.

girl with the legs and bottomless eyes who pa
trols the reference room is none other than Eve
(I'm in the mood for love) Bruckner. And the bubbling
young man that pushed you around the school, trying
to sell you a Quad on registration day, is Norm King,
rumored editor of next year's Quad. And the little man
in the big car with the top down, and with sweater
girls climbing all over his car is Bob Ashley, prize
of the SA.E.'s sophomore class. And that red car that
sits motionless, day after day, on Palm Drive is a Ford.
That round man with the brown sweater and sad
face, and black rimmed glasses is Ash Wilson, just an
other director of the Gaieties trying to round up a
show. And that charming blonde, who is all smiles and
knows and talks to everyone is the sophomore diving
star, Mai'jorie Gestring.
The three boys sitting in the little office in front of
the Quad are George Kaufman, Hap Everelt and Ted
(Semi-finals) Schroeder, who serve as student guides
and will readily answer any questions or lead you in
a tour around the school. And the husky, wavy-haired
giant waving goodbye to Loren LaPrade as the train
pulled off for Corvallis is the basketball star Bill
Cowden, and his arm is around Dori Redman.

r squat kid in the gray pants and blue shirt,
passing the football on the porch of the S.A.E.
house is Harper Harry Ink, the roller-skating tennis
star from San Diego. And the energetic little man with
the glasses over his eyes is the new president of Bran
ner Hall, Jerry Stoner, who in his own words is out
"to put Branner on the map," whatever that means,
and I for one am sure he'll do it. And the girl that
you can find, almost any afternoon, lolling around the
pool at the Hacienda, and one of the main reasons why
the high rent of $75 a month is tolerated around there
is Harriet (Flip to me and Fernando) Price.
And the little man with curly hair, barely visible
through the San Francisco fog, hurriedly distorting
words and peeking in bars, is Herb Caen, a columnist
on a rival paper.

The three boys sitting in the little office in front of
the Quad are George Kaufman, Hap Everelt and Ted
(Semi-finals) Schroeder, who serve as student guides
and will readily answer any questions or lead you in
a tour around the school. And the husky, wavy-haired
giant waving goodbye to Loren LaPrade as the train
pulled off for Corvallis is the basketball star Bill
Cowden, and his arm is around Dori Redman.

r squat kid in the gray pants and blue shirt,
passing the football on the porch of the S.A.E.
house is Harper Harry Ink, the roller-skating tennis
star from San Diego. And the energetic little man with
the glasses over his eyes is the new president of Bran
ner Hall, Jerry Stoner, who in his own words is out
"to put Branner on the map," whatever that means,
and I for one am sure he'll do it. And the girl that
you can find, almost any afternoon, lolling around the
pool at the Hacienda, and one of the main reasons why
the high rent of $75 a month is tolerated around there
is Harriet (Flip to me and Fernando) Price.
And the little man with curly hair, barely visible
through the San Francisco fog, hurriedly distorting
words and peeking in bars, is Herb Caen, a columnist
on a rival paper.
TIIE PEOPLE YOU MEET
T HE serious, young woman in Wilson's, carefully
looking all around her, then tilting her head back
and using nose drops is the head of Roble, Sylvia
Berry. The young woman in the trim brown suit, with
one arm in a sling, shouting to the obedient and re
sponsive crowd, "I was trying to shoot a gun, a gun
mind you," is Isabel Fawcett of Excom and other
fames.
The tall blonde-haired boy who you always see in
the library is not Timothy Hopkins but is Bob Comp
ton, whose Bawlout standing reads 51 plus 102. And
the mysterious man in the worn, grey flannel suit, with
brown dark glasses, who rides a bicycle and always
hurries through the library, no one knows who he is.
And the tall, thin sensitive looking man who wears a
striped suit and continually hums aloud, no one knows
who he is.

girl with the legs and bottomless eyes who pa
trols the reference room is none other than Eve
(I'm in the mood for love) Bruckner. And the bubbling
young man that pushed you around the school, trying
to sell you a Quad on registration day, is Norm King,
rumored editor of next year's Quad. And the little man
in the big car with the top down, and with sweater
girls climbing all over his car is Bob Ashley, prize
of the SA.E.'s sophomore class. And that red car that
sits motionless, day after day, on Palm Drive is a Ford.
That round man with the brown sweater and sad
face, and black rimmed glasses is Ash Wilson, just an
other director of the Gaieties trying to round up a
show. And that charming blonde, who is all smiles and
knows and talks to everyone is the sophomore diving
star, Mai'jorie Gestring.
