# CAMP US OPINION
## 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
If you see fit, please enter the following in your
Campus Opinion column:
Maybe I'm just a little sentimental but I thought
that the welcome you gave to a defeated football team
really hit the spot. It was a different feeling for us to
lose, and we wondered how everyone else, especially
our own student body, would take it. I, personally,
thought that the whole squad was going to have to
wait for rides to the campus in the front of Wilson's,
and upon arrival be pestered by "What was the matter
up there?"
You can't imagine our surprise when we saw the
reception waiting for us. You've shown us a spirit
that we won't forget.
A grateful football player
