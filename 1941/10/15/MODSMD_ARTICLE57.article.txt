# Victor Swing Album Quivers On 'Hep Cat Popularity Limb
## 
### 
Victor went out on a limb recently in selecting four records to make up
a "Symposium of Swing," something like picking a "Two-foot Bookshelf."
The recording people left themselves wide open for criticism from
thousands of would-be experts, but considering the ticklishness of the job,
did pretty well by most of swing's dogmatic fanatics. Unlike the fickle

fans of ordinary dance music, real,
swing addicts stick by their favorites
through thick and thin. One guy
went so far as to say that Goodman
had the best band in the country at
a time when Benny was playing for
the Boston Philharmonic.
GOODMAN, KRUPA
Almost everyone, however, would
concur in the choice of the first two
discs. "Sing, Sing, Sing" of course is
the famous two-sided classic that
Goodman turned out at the height of
his glory, featuring Krupa's dramatic
drumming, unequalled brass power,
and Benny's own clarinet.
Equally famous is Bunny Berigan's
only masterpiece, "I Can't Get
Started," coupled with "The Prison
er's Song." Berigan's much-dis
cussed vocal is something that grows
on you and the record winds up with
some marvelous trumpet work.
OTHER TWO DEBATABLE
The other two choices are quite
debatable. Tommy Dorsey is typical
on his 12-inch recording of "Beale
St. Blues," backed by "Stop, Look,
and Listen." Fats Waller turns out
"Blue Turning Grey Over You" on
the reverse of his own composition,
"Honeysuckle Rose," both sides giv
ing you the full benefit of Thomas'
piano without too much of his husky
vocalizing.
Ellington fans are going to be ler T
ribly disappointed because Victor
didn't have a spot for "Mood Indigo,"
"Caravan," 'Harlem Butterfly," or
any one of the Duke's classics. Aside
from this regrettable omission we
think Victor's choice pretty repre
sentative of American swing. â€”
