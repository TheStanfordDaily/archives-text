# Farm 'Hams,' War Libe join Forces on Foreign Programs
## 
### 
How could we summon help if Stanford were completely isolated by
windstorm. Hood or earthquake—if all telephone and telegraph communi
cations were down and electricity sources were cut? Fifteen students
have the only answer—for they are radio "hams."
If such a catastrophe ever happened, the "hams" could immediately

establish contact with Red Cross and
relief sources by using "walky-*
talkies," compact suitcase sending ;
and receiving sets powered by stor
age batteries. Within a few minutes
automobile generators could be uti
lized to power permanent short wave !
sets.
During normal times, Stanford s
"hams" confine their activities to
their -short wave station, VVGYX, and >
the station at the Hoover War Li
brary. Headquarters for the club is
the "ham shack" behind the Ryan j
High - Voltage Laboratory, where ,
most of their equipment is housed. :
WAR LIBE USES
At the present time this equipment
is being used by the War Libe for
broadcasts to Latin America, and for
a Far Eastern listening post. The j
'"hams" help in the operation of \
both the broadcasts and the listening
post.
Using horizontal and vertical di
rective antennae, the War Libe list
ening post picks up propaganda and
news broadcasts from Japan, China,
Australia, New Zealand, and other
Far Eastern countries. These broad
casts arc recorded on metal records,
and later transcribed by translators
and typed for reference.
WA RTIME RESTRICTIONS
All members of the radio club are
licensed operators and take turns
in operating the club's short wave j
equipment, which is directly licensed
by the government to Mike Villard,
club president.
Since the beginning of the war.
club members have had to confine
themselves to domestic broadcasts,
since all foreign broadcasting is sub
ject to strict supervision by the Fed
eral Communications Commission.
