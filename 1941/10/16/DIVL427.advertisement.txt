Just a Second

Stanford is always moving ahead
—whether its in the classroom or
on the football gridiron. The rea
son? There's lots of 'em.
But it takes research of the past
to build for the future—students
study past achievements; griddcrs
study past performances.
Stanford women are always up
to date in their campus and off -
campus attires. The reason? Well
Clothes Closet research is one big
aide.
Just off University Ave., at 520
Ramona St., the Clothes Closet
docs research to find out what
Stanford women want most. The
results show it works. Come and
see why!
