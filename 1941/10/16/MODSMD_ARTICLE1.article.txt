### AMIE REICHERT 
YESTERDAY Captain Hideo Hi- j
raide told the U.S. that "the
Japanese navy is itching for action." j
Well, the Japanese have been itch- j
ing for some time now, and they
haven't scratched yet. At least not !
in our direction.
This itch, however, coming as it j
does from the Nipponese Naval i
Ministry, is perhaps a little more
serious. Japan's navy chiefs have 1
in the past supported almost un
equivocally all "appeasement"
overtures between their country
and the U.S.
While the Army hotheads have
consistently urged war in the inter
ests of the "New Order in Asia,*' the
Navy has, for the most part, re
mained aloof from the shouting and
has steadily sought to promote a
peaceful settlement.
But yesterday Hie Navy came
all-out for war. The exact words
used were these: "It is certainly at
such a time like this that the Navy
should fulfill its primary mission."
Captain Hiraide declared that
Japan stands at the "final cross
roads." He emphasized the fact that
this is the strategic moment for
Japan to fulfill her destiny, and he
added suggestively that the U.S.
Navy is not strong enough to fight
a two-ocean war.
* # •*
/'APTAIN HIRADE was talking
4 turkey. He is absolutely right.
But he is a little short-sighted if he
thinks that war between the U.S.
and Japan will be merely a war be
tween our Navy and theirs.
The U.S. has naval and air bases
on the Philippines, Guam, the Wake
Islands, and the powerful British
fortress of Singapore is at our dis
posal.
Should Japan declare war on us,
our Navy co-ordinating with Brit
ain's Pacific fleet could probably
rut Japan's supply lines, encircle
her Navy, and bomb the bamboo
island to splinters.
Since the U.S. has begun convoy
ing and patrol ing the Atlantic, Brit
ain's sea losses have dropped to a
fraction of what they were only a
few months ago. The efficiency of
the Nazi sea raiders has been cut
considerably. And when the Neu
trality Act is amended to permit
arming of merchantmen, Anglo-
American power in the Atlantic will
be something even Joe Goebbels
won't be able to laugh off.

MEANWHILE, what of the Pa
cific? Experts are almost
unanimously agreed that as long as
the British Navy remains intact and
working in-*he Atlantic with out*
convoys and, if necessary, in the
Pacific with the bulk of our fleet, we
can take on the Japanese Navy with
very little trouble.
Naturally the whole matter rests
at the moment with Captain Ilideo
Hiraide and his buddies. The U.S.
wants to keep the peace in the Pa
cific and it has tried and will con
tinue—to try to arrive at a set
tlement of the difficulties.
But we will not back down. We
cannot sell the Chinese down the
river a la Munich, and Japan on
the other hand can't back down
either and save face.
Undoubtedly if Japan is going to
move at all, this is the time. But
North, not South would be the bet
ter direction. She could pull a Mus
solini and stab Russia in the back
with far greater ease than she could
face the U.S. and Britain.

JAPANESE talk is only big talk

his blitz on the Soviet, the Japanese
stood up and hollered. When Kiev
fell they repeated the performance,

Both times they hushed up
rather abruptly when those mad
Russians continued to fight. Talk
of peace and appeasement followed
the inexplicable silence and the
Japanese press played up all the
angles on the Washington confer

Now Moscow is severely threat

While the Army hotheads have
consistently urged war in the inter
ests of the "New Order in Asia,*' the
Navy has, for the most part, re
mained aloof from the shouting and
has steadily sought to promote a
peaceful settlement.

all-out for war. The exact words
used were these: "It is certainly at
such a time like this that the Navy
should fulfill its primary mission."
Captain Hiraide declared that
Japan stands at the "final cross
roads." He emphasized the fact that
this is the strategic moment for
Japan to fulfill her destiny, and he
added suggestively that the U.S.
Navy is not strong enough to fight
a two-ocean war.

/'APTAIN HIRADE was talking
4 turkey. He is absolutely right.
But he is a little short-sighted if he
thinks that war between the U.S.
and Japan will be merely a war be
tween our Navy and theirs.
The U.S. has naval and air bases
on the Philippines, Guam, the Wake
Islands, and the powerful British
fortress of Singapore is at our dis
posal.
Should Japan declare war on us,
our Navy co-ordinating with Brit
ain's Pacific fleet could probably
rut Japan's supply lines, encircle
her Navy, and bomb the bamboo
island to splinters.
Since the U.S. has begun convoy
ing and patrol ing the Atlantic, Brit
ain's sea losses have dropped to a
fraction of what they were only a
few months ago. The efficiency of
the Nazi sea raiders has been cut
considerably. And when the Neu
trality Act is amended to permit
arming of merchantmen, Anglo-
American power in the Atlantic will
be something even Joe Goebbels
won't be able to laugh off.

MEANWHILE, what of the Pa

unanimously agreed that as long as
the British Navy remains intact and
working in-*he Atlantic with out*
convoys and, if necessary, in the
Pacific with the bulk of our fleet, we
can take on the Japanese Navy with
very little trouble.
Naturally the whole matter rests
at the moment with Captain Ilideo
Hiraide and his buddies. The U.S.
wants to keep the peace in the Pa
cific and it has tried and will con
tinue—to try to arrive at a set
tlement of the difficulties.
But we will not back down. We
cannot sell the Chinese down the
river a la Munich, and Japan on
the other hand can't back down
either and save face.
Undoubtedly if Japan is going to
move at all, this is the time. But
North, not South would be the bet
ter direction. She could pull a Mus
solini and stab Russia in the back
with far greater ease than she could
face the U.S. and Britain.
