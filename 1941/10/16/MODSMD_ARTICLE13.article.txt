# WANT GREEN FEET?-DELYON CAN DO IT
## Campus Shine Man Will Dye 'Anything' 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Anytime you want to change your
satin evening slippers from just a
plain drab red or yellow to some
thing tasty like "salad green" or
something flowery like "pansy" or
something daring like "flesh," take
them to Albert Dclyon, owner of
the Campus Shoe Shop, who has a
repertoire of 120 different colors he
can dye shoes.
Delyon went on to say that he
also has one pair of silver spike
heels studded with brilliants left
over from 1929 by a coed who for
got to come for them. First come,
first served.
A native of Martinique, Dclyon is
now a United Slates citizen. He
opened his first shoe shop on the
campus in 1912 in a small building
on the site of the present Union.
Since then he has moved five times
but now is settled in his comfortable
shop behind the Bookstore.
NEW MACHINERY
One end of Delyon's shop is now
a mass of new machinery. Just
ribout all of his work is now done
by these machines; buffing, polish
ing and shining on one and stitching
on the other. Delyon ordered the
machinery before the present em
ergency and was able to get delivery
| on them before the OPM clamped

down.
On the other side of the shop
there is a comfortable row of seats
for those getting shoeshines. All the
latest in periodicals are here, for
Delyon believes in keeping the cus
tomer happy. If the proprietor is
too busy working his new machin
ery, there are two assistants anxious
to shine them up.

"Stanford students buy good i
shoes," Delyon replied to the query
i about how the Stanford student I
| treats his feet, "too good for my !
business. Those saddle shoes wear ,
| forever. But when they do come
jin they usually have everything j
j doneâ€”heels and soles and a shine,
j But then that's usually the mini
-1 mum to be done."
