# Saddles Wear 'Too Well' for Business
## 
### 
When asked what, the funniest |
tiling that has happened to him, the i
salesman who was installing the j
machinery turned around and said, !
"Probably the funniest tiling that
happened to him was the realization
that he bought all this new ma
chinery."
SADDLES FOREVER
Delyon still has some of his old
equipment, his old bench, hammer
and awl. He also has a large framed
mirror which was badly cracked in
the San Francisco earthquake of
1906, but as yet it hasn't brought
him any of the proverbial bad luck.
True to his native ancestry, Delyon
goes for any sort of melons. He
keeps a big one on ice in his little
back room and will serve you up a
slice while you have a shine. He
also can dye your shoes a particu
larly attractive color called "honey
melon."
Delyon feels particularly gratified
after all his years on the campus
when people from Los Angeles and
from as far away as Canada send
their shoes back to him to have a
"good job done." Evidence that he
has a good trade is the fact that
parking is at a premium in front of
his shop and the police have put up
a sign which allows only 20 minutes
to a customer.
