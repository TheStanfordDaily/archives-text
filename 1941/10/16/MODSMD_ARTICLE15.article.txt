# Mrs. Timothy Hopkins Dies In Menlo after Year's Illness
## 
### 
Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, 7!), whom President Kay Lyman Wilbur oncc
called "one of the very best friends Stanford ever had," died Tuesday
evening at her home in Menlo Park following an illness of a year.
Prior to her confinement at home, Mrs. Hopkins, who was present at
the laying of the Stanford cornerstone and at many other historic campus

functions, was able to attend the<
â€¢ r )oth anniversary celebration in June.
She centered much of her philan
thropy on the Convalescent Home,
which she helped to establish in
Senator and Mrs. Stanford's old resi
dence. She was a close friend of
both the Stanfords.
HOPKINS ROOM DONOR
One of the gifts for which students
remember her is the Timothy Hop
kins room in the main library. Mrs.
Hopkins, whose family was of May
flower origin, was a member of the
Century Club, Town and Country
Club, Colonial Dames, and several
other organizations.
The friendship between the Stan
fords and the Hopkinses began when
the "Big Four" were founding the
Central Pacific railroad. Mr. Hop
kins, another benefactor of the Uni
versity up until his death on Jan
uary 1, 1936, plotted the townsite of
Palo Alto, originally known as Uni
versity Park, in 1887.
HELPED LIBRARY
He was one of the first supporters
of the main library, presenting it
with 5000 books during its first year.
These formed the nucleus for the
Hopkins Railway Library. His gift
of $5000, for the purchase of biology
books, was mainly responsible for
the establishment of the biological
laboratory at Pacific Grove.
His estate, which was estimated at
$963,515, will now go to Stanford. A
condition of the will provides that 60
per cent of the estate be used for the
development of the Hopkins Marine
Station. Details of Mrs. Hopkins'
own estate are not yet known.
DAUGHTER SURVIVES
One daughter, Miss Lydia Kel
logg Hopkins of Woodside, is the
only surviving relative.
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, emeritus
chaplain, will come from his home
in Carmel to officiate at the funeral
services, which will be conducted at
the Stanford Memorial Church Fri
day afternoon at 2 o'clock. Roller
and Hapgood Mortuary is in charge
of arrangements.
