LONDON, Oct. 15 CUP). â€” The
mystery voice which heckled the
British Broadcasting Company's
newscasters last night was drown
ed out by Scottish bagpipes as
BBC was signing off.
However, just as the bagpipes
stopped the voice came on and re
marked:
"Thank God, at last some use has
been found for those windbags."
