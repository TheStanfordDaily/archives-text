# Artists to Give Informal Talks
## 
### 
So that Stanford students may gain
a "better understanding of sym
phonic music," a series of informal
talks by eminent artists, first of
whom will be Pierre Monteux, have
been scheduled to take place on the
campus during the San Francisco
Symphony season.
This announcement, released last
night by Dick Lyons, also disclosed
that a limited number of season
tickets to the Symphony will be
available for $9, a rate which is $6
below the public sale price.
SEATS SAVED
Lyons, who heads the student
committee selling the season tickets
on campus, said that two blocks of
seats, one in the grand tier and one
in the orchestra, are being saved for
Stanford students. Because the
tickets are being printed especially
for this purpose, reservations must
be made immediately.
On each Wednesday night preced
ing the Saturday concerts, an infor
mal meeting, headlining the musi
cians who will appear in the con
certs, will be held at some sorority
house. At those meetings, the works
featured on the coming programs
will be explained and commented
upon.
Among the artists appearing dur
ing the 12-concert season arc: Mir
iam SoloviefT, Igor Stravinsky, Vla
dimir Horowitz, and Arthur Rubin
stein.
AUDIENCE BUILD-UP
According to Lyon, the program
is being made possible because Mrs.
Leonora Armsby, president of the
San Francisco Symphony Associa
tion, and Howard Skinner, the Asso
ciation business manager, are vitally
interested in building up a "young
audience of future symphony-goers."
Since about eight of the concerts
arc sure to be sell-outs, Lyon com
mented, the Stanford audience con
realize the scope of the Symphony
Association plan.
He added that those students who
do not wish to attend all concerts
will be served by a "clearing house"
in the A.S.S.U. office at which they
i can sell their scats to individual
j concerts.
NOT ACADEMIC
"The major thing about this," Lyon
| stated, "is that it's not academic, and
â–  it's a chance for all Stanford stu
j dents to sit together.
"And, besides getting to sit with
; your friends, you can save money.
Incidentally, the scats are the best
in the house."
Season tickets may be purchased
j through any of the following people:
I Pi Thornton, DeeGec; Brandy Bat
sett, and Dave Jessburg, Delts; Amie
j Reichert, Lagunita; Ted Cole, El
Toro; Mary Brown, Roblc; By Dell,
