# Red Capital Faces Siege Or Surrender as Nazi Giant Pincer Tightens
## U.S.-Japanese Crisis Feared; 'War Imminent' 
### United Press 
Siege or surrender seemed inevi
table for Moscow today (Thursday)
as reinforced German armies
smashed nearer from the west and
the panzer arms of a giant nutcrack
er slowly closed around the Red
capital despite the Soviet army's best
efforts.
Hie government was reduced to
its last extremityâ€”appealing for a
"people's defense" waged by every
man, woman and child of the city's
4,500,000 population able to hurl a
bottle of flaming gasoline at a Nazi
tank.
FIGHT OR RUN
With unchecked German armies
smashing nearer the city from three
directions, the Russians admitted
their venerated capital was in immi
nent peril. With the chance of
throwing back the onrushing Ger
mans apparently one in a hundred,
the Soviet central armies and the
millions of Muscovites must choose
soon between abandoning Moscow
or fighting in protracted winter
siege.
In appealing to civilians to join
Red army troops in the defense of
the capital, the government appar
ently had decided definitely on the
heroic latter course.
WAR AT A GLANCE
Major war developments included:
1. Berlin claimed, without specific
contradiction from Moscow, that
panzer columns were streaming four
abreast over feebly defended high
ways to Moscow on the vital sector
west of the capital. At the same
time, according to the Nazis, the steel
arms of a gigantic nutcracker closing
on the half-encircled city were knif
ing forward through the regions of
Kalinin, less than 100 miles north
west of Moscow, and Tula, about the
same distance to the south.
Soviet counterattacks hurled at
the oncoming Germans were said to
have been beaten back with heavy
Russian losses. Extremely signifi
cant, if confirmed, was a German
claim that the great battles of anni
hilation in the Vyazma and Bryansk
pockets had been terminated with
the capture of 560,000 Russians and
that huge Nazi forces were thereby
released to join in the assault on
Moscow.
2. Russia's official newspapers for
the first time admitted the Red capi
tal was in grave danger and called
upon the entire population to spring
to aid the Red army "to beat off this
onslaught. . . . sparing neither
strength nor life."
