# Big Game Gaieties Chief Summons Vocalists to Try Out Tomorrow in Theater
## 
### 
Singing tryouts for this year's Gai
eties will take place tomorrow after
noon, Marion Scott, chief Gaieties
tunesmith, announced yesterday.
These tryouts will he held on the
stage of the auditorium and all can
didates for positions in the big sh;,w
are asked to bring their own music.
Scott is quite happy about the
musical prospects of the Gaieties.
There have been a large numbi r of
songs turned in and, according to
Scott, "we've got lots of good stuff.

Particularly good are a couple of
neat novelty tunes that we have re
ceived. In fact, yoti might almost
say we're 'fat'." Scott, incidentally,
asked that it be known that, despite
his name, Marion, he is a he.
In addition to tomorrow's song
tryouts, dance tryouts will be held
Monday. Adolfo Arias and Jackie
Poly are heading up this portion of
the show and particularly want men
for their heel-and-toe routine. All
those who make the grade as dancers

are guaranteed of getting another
spot in the Gaieties. This, according
to Arias and Poly, should be ample
inducement for the large turn-out
that the Gaieties heads are hoping
for.
Deadline for the show's scripts fell
yesterday. A large amount of mate
rial was turned in and, to quote
Gaieties head man Ash Wilson, "we
have received some, really clever
work." Chief among the writers that
turned in skits for the production

were Norm Ross, John Lawry, A1
Hampson, and H. D. Thoreau. Wil
son. together with John Lawry, is
now going over the script, smoothing
out the rough places and creating
continuity in the show.
Marion Scott has tentatively se
lected Six Hits and a Dent, a sing
ing feature of the Gaieties, and this
group will in all probability start
practicing on Monday. In all. Direc
tor Wilson is pleased with the way
things are going.
