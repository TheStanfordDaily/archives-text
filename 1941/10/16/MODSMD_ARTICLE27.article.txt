# Indian Gridders Prepare Passing Attack to Crush Dons in Revenge for Loss
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
A San Francisco team that doesn't have much to offer will he down
here Saturday to help Stanford launch a come-hack. 'Ihe Indians, anxious
to wipe out the memory of their 10-0 defeat at the hands of Oregon State,
are preparing a devastating aerial attack for the visitors who were proved

weak in the secondary. Sunday.
Yesterday Coach Shaughnessy
scrimmaged a backfield of Hammett.
Sheller, Vucinich, and Fawcett, be
hind a second-string line, against
the frosh. Meanwhile Frank Albert
tossed passes to the halfbacks and
ends, including Hank Norberg, who
worked out for the first time since
his injury in the U.C.L.A. game. The
line ran through blocking drill.
Crunch Crane. Pete Kmetovic,
and Arnie Meiners are all definitely
out of the U.S.F. game this week
end and it is doubtful if any ol
these boys will be ready lor Wash
ington.
Coach Shaughnessy saw Ihe Don-
Gael game Sunday and liked the
kicking of Vic Ramus. The Card
coach also had praise for Franceschi
and Sheridan, U.S.F. backs.
It is difficult to see much in store
for the Dons this season. Although
the statistics show that the Hill
toppers did all right against St,
Mary's except for pass defense, Jefi
Cravath's boys seem to lack the
spark that they had to a certain ex
tent last year when Big Dan Fisk
powered through for encouraging
yardage. The Dons were guilty of
poor ball handling last Sunday and
kept themselves in the hole with
fumbles.
Bulwarks in the visitors' line are
Bcebee Mohr and Doc Haley. Russ
Kynoch is a standout at end. The
backfield lacks a definite threat in
the form of one key man like Stan
ford's Albert but includes a few
competent veterans, Gene Benedetti
Sammy Johnstone, Ramus, Frances
chi, Sheridan, and Mel Reid.
