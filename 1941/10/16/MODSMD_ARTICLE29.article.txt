### 
Opening its 1!)41 conference sea
son, Coach Norton Thornton's var
sity water polo team will face the
powerful U.C.L.A. Bruins Friday af
ternoon at 4:15 in the Encina pools.
Boasting two all conference for
wards—Bill Mitchell and Johnny
Segal—from last year's powerhouse
team, the Uclans, according to j
Thornton, are the squad to beat in
the conference this year.
BRUINS SECOND
Coach Don Parks' mermen placed
second behind California last year
and were conference champions the
year before. They also won the title !
in 1935 and tied for first in 1937.
Of the Indians' (i to 5 loss last
week to the Olympic Club—rated
one of the top teams of the nation, j
they will be plenty hard to beat, |
says Thornton.
Comparative scores against Comp- I
ton J. C. give Stanford a slight ad- |
vantage. Thornton's charges topped
the Tartars, 10 to 4. while the Bruins 1
won two, 11 to 1 and 10 to 8, and
dropped a third game, 9 to 8.

Olympic Club have earned sharp- j
shooting Bill Mapel and freshman \
Pete Lee the probable starting posi
tions at sprint and goalie, respec- |
tively, Friday afternoon.
The rest of the team will line up 1
with Fred Manwaring and Hadley i
Bacon, forwards; Bob Jones, center
