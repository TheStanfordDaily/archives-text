# Robleites of '44 Meet Saturday
## 
### 
Hall and Row girls who haven't
had time to get together since their
Roble days last year are exhibiting
mounting enthusiasm over the first
reunion of the year planned for this
Saturday noon in the Women's Gym
nasium, according to Janet Atkinson,
general chairman of the event.
Starting about 11:45 from the A.
O. Pi house, the "ex-freshmen" will
proceed down the Row gathering
their sophomore sisters from each
of the sorority houses and meeting
the Union women before going on
to the Gym where they will meet
the Lagunita contingent.
Box lunches will be served at
noon in the gym, and the group will
start toward the stadium as soon as
possible to facilitate sitting together
in the rooters' section.
Tickets, being sold for 40 cents by
representatives in each of the wom
en's living groups, must be turned
in to Emily Howard, finance chair
man, by 1 o'clock this afternoon.
Anyone wishing to buy tickets after
today should contact Miss Howard
at the Gamma Phi house.
