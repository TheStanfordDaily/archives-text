]VOT so long ago we mentioned
how much difference a few wins
made in whether the public wanted
i to see a team win or wanted to see
some outfit topple it from the
i heights.
Now you can see what a little
defeat can do for a team in the
opinion of some of the nation's
grid experts. Whereas Stanford
was rated light up among the top
teams in the country a week ago,
j an Associated Press poll reveals
that the spertswritcrs of that or
ganization now regard thp In
; dians as being in the category
marked "also rans." Clark
Shaughnessy's hoys used to be up
there with the Minnesotas, the
Texans, and the Fordhams, hut
; now they arc way, way down
there with Southern Methodist and
Dartmouth, the latter outfit being
the one at whose expense Stan
ford started its streak of victories
that the Beavers brought to an
end.
But there really isn't much to
j worry about on that score, for, no
' matter where the experts put the
Indians in their rankings, Shaugh
nessy's charges are still in the run
, ning. And if the attitude the team
shows on the practice field is any
j criterion, it'll be a good outfit that
j turns back the Stanford Indians
J again this season.
* * *
r PHE trouble is that there are some
good—very good—teams still on
; the Indians' schedule, Santa Clara
j and Washington, for example. Of
j course, everyone is counting on the
} teams in the state of Oregon to load
the race light up until the last mo
j ment, when the Beavers and the
Ducks do battle with each other.
[Then one of them#will have to fall
by the wayside. But unless it turns
out to be the Beavers that do the
J tailing, things aren't too bright for
! the Indians.
However, with the things that
have happened already in this
crazy, helter-skelter Pacific Coast
Conference grid race, we've de
| tided that there's no predicting
what's going to happen during the
rest of the season. Even Stub

I Allison's Golden Bears might do
! a bit of upsetting to aid the cause.
] They certainly should he able to
do something along those lines if
I the way they ran over St. Mary's
1 means anything. Maybe it'll be
| Oregon this Saturday or Oregon
| Stale on November 15. It's just a
"maybe," but it would help the
Indians no end.
The chances are that if Stanford
goes through the rest of the season
without another setback, the other
candidates in this campaign will take
care of each other in such a way
that the Cards will be IN.

IN the new Esquire, which hit the
| newsstands yesterday, the writer
j of an article titled, "The New Hud
| die Muddle" lists our Clark Daniel
..Shaughnessy as one of the "ten best
tragic heroes."
We don't quite know how the
Indian mentor fits in as a "tragic
hero," but the comment upon him
is gcodj although not very enlight
ening.

| newsstands yesterday, the writer
j of an article titled, "The New Hud
| die Muddle" lists our Clark Daniel
..Shaughnessy as one of the "ten best
tragic heroes."
We don't quite know how the
Indian mentor fits in as a "tragic
hero," but the comment upon him
is gcodj although not very enlight
ening.

/
]VOT so long ago we mentioned
how much difference a few wins
made in whether the public wanted
i to see a team win or wanted to see
some outfit topple it from the
i heights.
Now you can see what a little
defeat can do for a team in the
opinion of some of the nation's
grid experts. Whereas Stanford
was rated light up among the top
teams in the country a week ago,
j an Associated Press poll reveals
that the spertswritcrs of that or
ganization now regard thp In
; dians as being in the category
marked "also rans." Clark
Shaughnessy's hoys used to be up
there with the Minnesotas, the
Texans, and the Fordhams, hut
; now they arc way, way down
there with Southern Methodist and
Dartmouth, the latter outfit being
the one at whose expense Stan
ford started its streak of victories
that the Beavers brought to an
end.
But there really isn't much to
j worry about on that score, for, no
' matter where the experts put the
Indians in their rankings, Shaugh
nessy's charges are still in the run
, ning. And if the attitude the team
shows on the practice field is any
j criterion, it'll be a good outfit that
j turns back the Stanford Indians
J again this season.
* * *
r PHE trouble is that there are some
good—very good—teams still on
; the Indians' schedule, Santa Clara
j and Washington, for example. Of
j course, everyone is counting on the
} teams in the state of Oregon to load
the race light up until the last mo
j ment, when the Beavers and the
Ducks do battle with each other.
[Then one of them#will have to fall
by the wayside. But unless it turns
out to be the Beavers that do the
J tailing, things aren't too bright for
! the Indians.
However, with the things that
have happened already in this
crazy, helter-skelter Pacific Coast
Conference grid race, we've de
| tided that there's no predicting
what's going to happen during the
rest of the season. Even Stub

I Allison's Golden Bears might do
! a bit of upsetting to aid the cause.
] They certainly should he able to
do something along those lines if
I the way they ran over St. Mary's
1 means anything. Maybe it'll be
| Oregon this Saturday or Oregon
| Stale on November 15. It's just a
"maybe," but it would help the
Indians no end.
The chances are that if Stanford
goes through the rest of the season
without another setback, the other
candidates in this campaign will take
care of each other in such a way
that the Cards will be IN.
