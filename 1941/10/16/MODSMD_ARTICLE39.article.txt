# If I Were President—
## 
### 
TF F. D. Roosevelt of Hyde Park and Washing-
JL ton called me and said, "If you were in my
shoes today, what would you do?"—well, I'd
know exactly what to suggest.
Mr. President, I'd say, last May or June I'd
probably have changed your entire foreign pol
icy. I believed you were merely a pawn of
the British and were heading this country into
another empire-saving war.
But now, Mr. President, I'll admit I was
wrong. My arguments for an isolationist Amer
icsa were fallaciously based on the ostrich doc
trine and selfishness—to save my own skin.
Further, to continue fighting your policies—
sanctioned by the people of the United States
last November—is no longer democratic license,
but pure obstructionism.
However, Mr. President, if I were President,
I would immediately adopt the following pro
gram, to consolidate and facilitate present de
fense efforts.
1. Ask or, if necessary, demand that the price
control legislation now before the House of Rep
resentatives be reported out of committee. This
vital bill has been tossed around in committee
for over a month while prices on necessities of
life boom sky high without justification. This
legislation must be passed, not toyed with.
2. Clarify and nationalize draft regulations. In
Kansas City a medical student is not exempt
from the draft; in Berkeley he may be. One in
terpretation of the rules is needed, not a different
interpretation by each of the thousands of draft
boards.
3. Instruct Secretary of the Treasury Morgen
thau that all future tax bills be drafted to tax
according to ability to pay. Indirect taxes are
digging deeper and deper into the pockets of
the "little man," he who can least afford it.
4. Abolish the red tape and hypocrisy of the
national defense program. If necessary, estab
lish a "war czar" over the entire program, re
sponsible pnly to the President. There is too
much overlapping and bickering on defense
boards. By legislation or other means, control
production to increase defense output.
5. Appeal to the people of the United States
through propaganda of reason. In an attempt to
be fair, we have leaned backward too long and
are now caught in the web of indecision, fear,
and complacency. Sacrifices must be made and
the nation must realize it. However, do not sur
round governmental actions with the air of mys
tery, unless militarily or diplomatically neces
sary. Again, keep the people informed.
7. Tell capital, tell labor—this is not the time
for selfishness. This is war.
And remember, Mr. President, as the Nazis
squeeze tighter around Moscow, as the Japanese
get tougher, the destiny of this nation is in your
hands.
Take whatever action is necessary to insure
this destiny.—Herman Silverman

2. Clarify and nationalize draft regulations. In
Kansas City a medical student is not exempt
from the draft; in Berkeley he may be. One in
terpretation of the rules is needed, not a different
interpretation by each of the thousands of draft
boards.
3. Instruct Secretary of the Treasury Morgen
thau that all future tax bills be drafted to tax
according to ability to pay. Indirect taxes are
digging deeper and deper into the pockets of
the "little man," he who can least afford it.
4. Abolish the red tape and hypocrisy of the
national defense program. If necessary, estab
lish a "war czar" over the entire program, re
sponsible pnly to the President. There is too
much overlapping and bickering on defense
boards. By legislation or other means, control
production to increase defense output.
5. Appeal to the people of the United States
through propaganda of reason. In an attempt to
be fair, we have leaned backward too long and
are now caught in the web of indecision, fear,
and complacency. Sacrifices must be made and
the nation must realize it. However, do not sur
round governmental actions with the air of mys
tery, unless militarily or diplomatically neces
sary. Again, keep the people informed.
7. Tell capital, tell labor—this is not the time
for selfishness. This is war.
And remember, Mr. President, as the Nazis
squeeze tighter around Moscow, as the Japanese
get tougher, the destiny of this nation is in your
hands.
Take whatever action is necessary to insure
this destiny.—Herman Silverman
TF F. D. Roosevelt of Hyde Park and Washing-
JL ton called me and said, "If you were in my
shoes today, what would you do?"—well, I'd
know exactly what to suggest.
Mr. President, I'd say, last May or June I'd
probably have changed your entire foreign pol
icy. I believed you were merely a pawn of
the British and were heading this country into
another empire-saving war.
But now, Mr. President, I'll admit I was
wrong. My arguments for an isolationist Amer
icsa were fallaciously based on the ostrich doc
trine and selfishness—to save my own skin.
Further, to continue fighting your policies—
sanctioned by the people of the United States
last November—is no longer democratic license,
but pure obstructionism.
However, Mr. President, if I were President,
I would immediately adopt the following pro
gram, to consolidate and facilitate present de
fense efforts.
1. Ask or, if necessary, demand that the price
control legislation now before the House of Rep
resentatives be reported out of committee. This
vital bill has been tossed around in committee
for over a month while prices on necessities of
life boom sky high without justification. This
legislation must be passed, not toyed with.
