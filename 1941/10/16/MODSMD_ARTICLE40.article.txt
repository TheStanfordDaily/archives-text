LEAVING Roble behind them about three
years ago, the "better half of 1942" was re
luctant to part with the pleasant associations
formed there. Rushing had reshuffled the group
. . . true; the group, however, refused to drop
neatly and finally into the appropriate Hall-Row
pigeonholes.
There were so many and such strong ties
among these women that they believed a little
effort would stretch the bonds from the most
obscure reaches of Lasuen to the farthest room
in Lagunita. So, early the next year they did
put forth a little effort ... in the direction of a
simple buffet luncheon, served in the Women's
Clubhouse. It wasn't much, but it turned the
trick.

Again, last year the sophomores felt the irre
sistible pull of Roble and they too staged in
formal reunions. The trend was taking shape.
The Daily has carried this week several stories
on Saturday's pre-game patio luncheon at which
women of the class of '44 will have the chance
to pay profitable tribute to the force of those
year-long Roble associations.
Friendship and acquaintance do not break;
they crumble or fail into decay from lack of
active interest. With opportunity for adequate
expression of interest, however, there is no need
for this crumbling, decaying process, which
other classes have already halted.
