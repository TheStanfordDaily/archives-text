r JpHIS is truly a wonderful world, even though the
brothers are ordering me around and making me
learn all kinds of wonderful things, and even though I
stay up until 4 a.m. writing a paper which I found
out later I didn't have to have, and even though I go
to sleep in my history class and have-the prof awaken
me, and even though those Boches are pushing the
Russians all over the steppes, and even though T
doesn't necessarily stand for Victory any longer, and
even though the sisters at one of the local sorority
houses won't even allow me to call on the £>hone since
I don't have a convertible—as I was saying, it's a
wonderful world.

name Asher Wilson keeps popping up in the
news. To frosh and others who have never come
in contact with A.8., but who are planning to try out
for a Gaieties part in the near future or are planning
to submit anything to Time, let me issue a word of
warning. From his appearance one would judge that
he is the quiet, good-natured, and efficient sort of
person.
The fellow who said, "Don't judge people by their
appearances," and his cousin who said. "Looks are de
ceiving," obviously didn't know Asher. He is as he
looks.
Speaking from an unbiased viewpoint, I can truly
say that the 1941 Big Game Gaieties will be the greatest
student show ever put on on this campus, and per
haps the greatest collegiate revive ever produced any
where.
Already songs and skits have been turned in that
are unsurpassable. Wilson with his production assist
ants, Johny La wry and Norm Ross, when Norm can
get away from his frosh boys, have been slavinjg since
the start of school and will keep right on going up
until November 28. but when their finished product
"hits the road" (two performances at the Memorial
Theater) it will more than compensate for their efforts.
I got the above information from the publicity di
rector so it must be accurate.

IN ALL the years that Bull Session has been com
manding a place in The Daily, through the Mellin
koffs, Cobbses, Ameses, Mayers, and even the Saroyans,
there has never been a mention of one of the most im
portant things that we will run into in this entire
universe.
A complete understanding of this thing would be
worth more than a Ph.D. from Menlo, yet none of
these intelligent men has ever had the guts to men
tion it. This morning I'm going to wave aside my
personal interests and bring this soul-searing state
ment to the attention of the masses:
"MENE, MENE TEKEL, UPHARSEN."

koffs, Cobbses, Ameses, Mayers, and even the Saroyans,
there has never been a mention of one of the most im
portant things that we will run into in this entire
universe.
A complete understanding of this thing would be
worth more than a Ph.D. from Menlo, yet none of
these intelligent men has ever had the guts to men
tion it. This morning I'm going to wave aside my
personal interests and bring this soul-searing state
ment to the attention of the masses:
"MENE, MENE TEKEL, UPHARSEN."
r JpHIS is truly a wonderful world, even though the
brothers are ordering me around and making me
learn all kinds of wonderful things, and even though I
stay up until 4 a.m. writing a paper which I found
out later I didn't have to have, and even though I go
to sleep in my history class and have-the prof awaken
me, and even though those Boches are pushing the
Russians all over the steppes, and even though T
doesn't necessarily stand for Victory any longer, and
even though the sisters at one of the local sorority
houses won't even allow me to call on the £>hone since
I don't have a convertible—as I was saying, it's a
wonderful world.

name Asher Wilson keeps popping up in the
news. To frosh and others who have never come
in contact with A.8., but who are planning to try out
for a Gaieties part in the near future or are planning
to submit anything to Time, let me issue a word of
warning. From his appearance one would judge that
he is the quiet, good-natured, and efficient sort of
person.
The fellow who said, "Don't judge people by their
appearances," and his cousin who said. "Looks are de
ceiving," obviously didn't know Asher. He is as he
looks.
Speaking from an unbiased viewpoint, I can truly
say that the 1941 Big Game Gaieties will be the greatest
student show ever put on on this campus, and per
haps the greatest collegiate revive ever produced any
where.
Already songs and skits have been turned in that
are unsurpassable. Wilson with his production assist
ants, Johny La wry and Norm Ross, when Norm can
get away from his frosh boys, have been slavinjg since
the start of school and will keep right on going up
until November 28. but when their finished product
"hits the road" (two performances at the Memorial
Theater) it will more than compensate for their efforts.
I got the above information from the publicity di
rector so it must be accurate.
