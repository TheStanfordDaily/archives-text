## GOVERNMENT BY PROMISES? 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
It is almost a year now since President Roose
velt was re-elected by one of the largest majorities in
our history. It seems to me that you have forgotten
the promises that the President made to us before he
was re-elected. These promises he was expected to
keep when we gave him his third term. Some of
his more pertinent promises arc as follows:
"We are arming ourselves not for any purpose
of conquest or intervention in foreign disputes,
repeat again that I stand on the platform of our
party: 'We will not participate in foreign wars and
will not send our Army, Naval or Air Forces to
fight in foreign lands outside of the Americas ex
cept in case of attack.
"It is for peace that I have labored; and it is
for peace that I shall labor all the days of my life."
Philadelphia, Oct. 2.'5, HMO
"I have said this before, but I shall say it again
and again, and again, your boys are not going to be
sent into any foreign wars."
Boston, Oct. :>(), 1940
"The first purpose of our foreign policy is to
keep our country out of war."
Cleveland, Nov. 2, 1940
"In 1935, in the face of growing dangers through
out the world, your government undertook to
eliminate the hazards which in the past had led to
war.
"We made it clear that ships flying the Ameri
can flag could not carry munitions to a bellig
erent; and that they must stay out of war zones."
Brooklyn, Nov. 1, 1940
Do you, Mr. Editor, sincerely believe, in the light
of these promises, that the President is keeping faith
with the American people?

(The one phrase which was more responsible
than any other one factor for the re-election of
Woodrow Wilson to presidency in 1910 was, "He
kept us out of war." A few months after the elec
tion, we declared war. These statements of Mr.
Roosevelt's were made jus! about a year ago.

ple who elected him could foresee our position of
today when these speeches were made. It's not a
question of faith in his promises of a year ago. hut

It is almost a year now since President Roose
velt was re-elected by one of the largest majorities in
our history. It seems to me that you have forgotten
the promises that the President made to us before he
was re-elected. These promises he was expected to
keep when we gave him his third term. Some of
his more pertinent promises arc as follows:
"We are arming ourselves not for any purpose
of conquest or intervention in foreign disputes,
repeat again that I stand on the platform of our
party: 'We will not participate in foreign wars and
will not send our Army, Naval or Air Forces to
fight in foreign lands outside of the Americas ex
cept in case of attack.

for peace that I shall labor all the days of my life."
