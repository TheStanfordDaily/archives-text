## 
### 
Casting of the major roles of
"Knickerbocker Holiday," satirical
musical comedy to be presented Nov.
13, 14, and 15 in Memorial Auditor
ium, has been completed, it was an
nounced by F. Cowles Strickland,
director, as readings and tryouts
continue for several minor parts and
for the men's and women's chorus.
Two newcomers to the Farm this
year, Betsy Durkee and Ted Upman,
are -cast in leading roles along with
many actors familiar to campus au
diences.
Miss Durkee, transfer from Car
negie Tech, has been cast as Tina,
the women's leacl, and Upman,
former student at the Juillard School
of Music, will sing the role of Wash
ington Irving, a part requiring an
experienced singer, Mr. Strickland
said.
MARCUSE SINGS
Playing opposite Miss Durkee in
the role of Brom Broeck will be Hal
Millen, who last year played Win
tergreen in "Of Thee I Sing." Ted
Marcuse, in his first singing role at
Stanford, will take the part of
Peter Stuyvesant.
Although 15 roles have not as yet
been cast and places in the men's
and women's chorus are still open,
rehearsals are now in progress. Any
one interested in trying out for the
vacant posts should contact Mr.
Strickland or attend the Friday re
hearsal at 7:30 on the main stage of
Memorial Hall.
"Knickerbocker Holiday," written
by Maxwell Anderson, a former
Stanford man, is one of the most
popular musical shows of recent
years, according to Mr. Strickland.
It will be the second musical
comedy to be produced by the Stan

ford Players, chosen because of the
popularity of last year's singing pro
duction, "Of Thee I Sing."
A cartoon of New Amsterdam in
the old Dutch days of Pegleg Peter
Stuyvesant, "Knickerbocker Holi
day" is a colorful production taking
place in an atmosphere of wind
mills, wooden shoes, and starched
lace caps.
POLITICAL SATIRE
The story, told in an old style, is
a satire on political problems of
that time — graft and unreasonable
war—which the author believes fit
the contemporary set-up.
Although the plot fundamentally
concerns the love story of Brom and
Tina, it is complicated by the fact
that Brom can't take orders. It is
finally decided that this attitude is
one peculiar to Americans in the
song, "How Can You Tell an Amer
ican?." sung by Brom, Washington
Irving, and the chorus.
LYRICS LONG
Some of the lyrics of the song are,
"It's just that he hates and eter
nally despises the policeman on his
beat and the judge at his assizes, the
sheriff with his warrants and the bu
reaucratic crew, for the sole and
simple reason that they tell him
what to do."
Music for Knickerbocker Holiday
was written by Kurt Weill.

A cartoon of New Amsterdam in
the old Dutch days of Pegleg Peter
Stuyvesant, "Knickerbocker Holi
day" is a colorful production taking
place in an atmosphere of wind
mills, wooden shoes, and starched
lace caps.
POLITICAL SATIRE
The story, told in an old style, is
a satire on political problems of
that time — graft and unreasonable
war—which the author believes fit
the contemporary set-up.
Although the plot fundamentally
concerns the love story of Brom and
Tina, it is complicated by the fact
that Brom can't take orders. It is
finally decided that this attitude is
one peculiar to Americans in the
song, "How Can You Tell an Amer
ican?." sung by Brom, Washington
Irving, and the chorus.
LYRICS LONG
Some of the lyrics of the song are,
"It's just that he hates and eter
nally despises the policeman on his
beat and the judge at his assizes, the
sheriff with his warrants and the bu
reaucratic crew, for the sole and
simple reason that they tell him
what to do."
Music for Knickerbocker Holiday
