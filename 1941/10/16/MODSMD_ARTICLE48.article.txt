# 'Der Rosenkavalier' Equals Success of 1940 Premiere
## 
### DIXON ADAMS 
Willi tlu" presentation of "Dcr Rosenkavalicr," one of the most elaborate
and successful productions in San Francisco opera history was repeated
Tuesday night in the War Memorial Opera House.
Given with the same cast, sets, and costumes that brought acclaim to
last year's San Francisco "Rosenkavalicr" premiere, the audience saw the

exceptionally good use to which the,,
San Francisco company puts stage
sets and costuming.
The three sets for the opera sug
gested perfectly the delicate* 18th
century Viennese taste, and Rise
Stevens' costume in the second act
and Lotte Lehmann's in the third
act increased the effect.
STRAUSS WORK
"Rosenkavalier" is probably Rich
ard Strauss' most purely enjoyable
work, and the orchestra, under Erich
Leinsdorf, brought out the rich har
mony and Wagnerian orchestration
so well that it often drowned-out
the voices of Lehman, as the Prin
cess von Werdenberg, and Rise
Stevens as Octavian.
Nothing, however, marred Leh
mann's reputation as one of the
greatest sopranos to sing the role,
and applause, tabooed during the
acts of Wagnerian and Strauss opera,
was hard to suppress after her third
act trio with Stevens and Margit
Bokor, as Sophia.
STEVENS SUPERB
All of which speaks as well for
Miss Stevens and Miss Bokor as for
Mme. Lehmann. Rise Stevens de
serves a reputation as Octavian
equal to that of Lehmann as the
Princess.
Alexander Kipnis has never dis
appointed San Francisco audiences
with his clear, warm bass. As the
profligate Baron Ochs he brought
applause for his voice as well as
laughter for his interpretation of
the comic role. Walter Olitzki as
Fanimal and Olive Ponitz as Mar
ianne and a large supporting cast
also deserve praise.

so well that it often drowned-out
the voices of Lehman, as the Prin
cess von Werdenberg, and Rise
Stevens as Octavian.
Nothing, however, marred Leh
mann's reputation as one of the
greatest sopranos to sing the role,
and applause, tabooed during the
acts of Wagnerian and Strauss opera,
was hard to suppress after her third
act trio with Stevens and Margit
Bokor, as Sophia.
STEVENS SUPERB
All of which speaks as well for
Miss Stevens and Miss Bokor as for
Mme. Lehmann. Rise Stevens de
serves a reputation as Octavian
equal to that of Lehmann as the
Princess.
Alexander Kipnis has never dis
appointed San Francisco audiences
with his clear, warm bass. As the
profligate Baron Ochs he brought
applause for his voice as well as
laughter for his interpretation of
the comic role. Walter Olitzki as
Fanimal and Olive Ponitz as Mar
ianne and a large supporting cast
also deserve praise.
