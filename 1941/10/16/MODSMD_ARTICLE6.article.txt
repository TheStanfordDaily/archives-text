'"Lieut. Commander Tunney is an
excellent speaker," Maloney said
last night, "and his subject will un
doubtedly interest the student body.
The talk will be open to both men

and women, although classes will not
be dismissed to attend.
"Eight or ten Stanford men have
already applied for the posts, and
will be interviewed by Tunney while
he is here. The Lieut. Commander
has several former Farm men work
ing under him now and is very
pleased with their work."
PROMOTION POSSIBLE

approval and who pass the physical

these cups is based not only upon
boxing ability, but also on scholar
ship and personal qualities. These
cups are presented by Dr. Ray Ly

of the Circle S Society, of which
Tunney is an honorary member.
