# 'Sensational' Chappie Sells Out Rapidly
## 
### 
"The Chappie was a sensation —
sold out by 10 a.m.—a new record.
Girls came crying to the office for
more magazines, girls came crying
to the office for the privilege of
standing beside the "Old Boy...dis
appointments all over the campus."
This was Editor Barney McClure's
reaction to the first issue of Stan
ford's humor magazine.
The 1500 magazines were sold out
on all the Quad stations by 10 a.m.,
which in itself is a new record. Not
content with this record, Chappie
also sold 670 subscriptions, which is
130 more than last year.
The Chappie staff was at complete
odds as to the cause of their sud
den success. Some said that it was
the new cover which was the first
time the Chaparral has had a colored
photograph for its cover. Others
said the "Queens of the Month"
were the cause, but Barney McClure
remarked when asked to what he
attributed his success, "They bought
us out, the driveling idiots." '
