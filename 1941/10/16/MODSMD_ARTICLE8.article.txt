# Professors 'Bull' At Hall Smoker
## 
### 
Behind the closed doors of smoke
filled Branner lobby last night, three
Stanford professors gave their un
censored views on Stanford women.
The edifying comments of the fac
ulty on this important subject are
not for publication, but are being
kept as secrets of the hall.
The non-academic seminar was
the second Branner Club smoker of
the quarter, and the learned mem
bers of the panel were Professors
T. A. Bailey, P. W. Buck, and P. A.
Leighton. Free smokes were avail
able and cokes and sandwiches were
served.
The club's first social function will
be a Hallowe'en dance October 31.
