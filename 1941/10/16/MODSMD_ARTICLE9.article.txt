# Lunchers Hear Refugee Rabbi
## Emil Cohn Says Age 'Convulsively Dying' 
### 
That our modern age was dying
"in horible convulsions" was the
opinion presented by Rabbi Emil
Bernhard Cohn, refugee from Nazi
Germany, as guest speaker at the
Wednesday Luncheon Club yester
day.
Giving a scholarly and philosophic
interpretation of current events, Dr.
Cohn staled that this age had been
a short one, only a century and a
half, and was already dying out. He
blamed present conditions on ethical
relativismâ€”the idea that there are
no fixed standards of right and
wrong, which make it possible to
excuse Hitlerism.
Calling upon all people to solve the
problems of the world in themselves,
to free themselves from spiritual
confusion and chaos, Rabbi Cohn
concluded, "We are at the edge and
we must jump, each of us, to a
higher level in the coming age."
Presiding over the Luncheon Club,
which meets every Wednesday in
the Nitery, was Stu
dents interested arc welcome.
