### AMIE REICHERT 
JAPAN is holding the pcace of the
* Pacific in her avowedly itching
fingers. Last night Konoye's cabi
net toppled after teetering danger
ously for several weeks. With it
crashed almost the last hope for a
settlement of U.S.-Japanese differ
ences.
Almost the last hope, ln'cause
one slim 011c remains. If the Army
hotheads take over the government
the chances for war are better
than even. But if a new group of
moderates steps in to form the
next cabinet, yesterday's develop
ment will he nothing more than
an added incident in the Japanese
war of nerves.
For the last ten years a constant
.struggle has threatened to rip Japa
nese domestic politics wide open. It
has been the Army against the gov
ernment. The extremists against
the moderates.
In four years of war as many
cabinets have fallen because of
bitter disagreement over foreign
policy. The Army pressure groups
are the closest to the German fifth
column in Japan. There is abso
lutely no question about what it
would mean if the militarists take
over: it would mean war.
The Army realizes that if it is
going to fight at all it must fight
now, before the already strangling
Anglo-American economic blockade
squeezes the very life out of the
Nipponese military machine.

jyiATSUOKA has been suggestedl
by foreign correspondents as
successor to Konoye. He is remem
bered as the little man who trundled
between Tokyo and Berlin and Mos
cow and Berlin again, fixing things
just fine and dandy for everybody.
But he and his cabinet fell three
months ago when Hitler turned on
Stalin and Japan was caught in
the embarrassing position of hold
ing hands with both boys.
If the Japanese are to embark on
a policy of all-out Axis co-operation
with the Army packing the cabinet,
Matsuoka sounds like exactly the
man for premier.
But there is a clique of conserva
tives in the government too who
must be reckoned with. How strong
that group is and how steadfast it is
we will know better when the new
cabinet is announced, probably to
morrow.
The conservative group is less vo
ciferous but it has—or did have—an |
overwhelming advantage in pres
tige because the Emperor has in the
past always thrown his influence on
their side.

r |TIE fate of Japan depends en
tirely on the Son of Heaven's
present state of mind. It is possible
that he may feel now that the U.S.
is determined to reduce Japan to a
second- or third-class power in view
of Hull's adamant attitude at his
conferences with Nomura.
On the other hand, he may still
feel that Japan can survive as a
first-class power without risking
an American war, in which Brit
ain unquestionably would take
part.
Whatever he decides will deter
mine the membership of the new
cabinet and the future of Ameri
can-Japanese relations.
In the past Hirohito's policy
toward the Occident has been one
of watching and waiting — to see
which way the wind is blowing,
then blowing with it. Japan signed
up with the Axis powers at a time
when they were riding the crest,
then backed water when the U.S.
and Britain talked, and acted tough.
* * *
r |' , ODAY Japan cries out in an
guish that she is being encircled
by the two democracies. In reality
she has encircled herself. Each step
of aggression has only served to
bring her closer to her two enemies
Japan's position is desperate. The
Allied embargo has deprived her of
two-thirds of her steel industry's
raw imports, 93 per cent of her oil.
She has gotten herself into this
mess. The question now is whether
she is going to try to fight or talk
her way out of it.

jyiATSUOKA has been suggestedl

bered as the little man who trundled
between Tokyo and Berlin and Mos
cow and Berlin again, fixing things
just fine and dandy for everybody.
But he and his cabinet fell three
months ago when Hitler turned on
Stalin and Japan was caught in
the embarrassing position of hold
ing hands with both boys.
If the Japanese are to embark on
a policy of all-out Axis co-operation

Matsuoka sounds like exactly the
man for premier.
But there is a clique of conserva

that group is and how steadfast it is
we will know better when the new

would mean if the militarists take
over: it would mean war.
The Army realizes that if it is
going to fight at all it must fight
now, before the already strangling
Anglo-American economic blockade
squeezes the very life out of the
Nipponese military machine.

jyiATSUOKA has been suggestedl
by foreign correspondents as
successor to Konoye. He is remem
bered as the little man who trundled
between Tokyo and Berlin and Mos
cow and Berlin again, fixing things
just fine and dandy for everybody.
But he and his cabinet fell three
months ago when Hitler turned on
Stalin and Japan was caught in
the embarrassing position of hold
ing hands with both boys.
If the Japanese are to embark on
a policy of all-out Axis co-operation
with the Army packing the cabinet,
Matsuoka sounds like exactly the
man for premier.
But there is a clique of conserva
tives in the government too who
must be reckoned with. How strong
that group is and how steadfast it is
we will know better when the new
cabinet is announced, probably to
morrow.
The conservative group is less vo
ciferous but it has—or did have—an |
overwhelming advantage in pres
tige because the Emperor has in the
past always thrown his influence on
their side.

r |TIE fate of Japan depends en
tirely on the Son of Heaven's
present state of mind. It is possible
that he may feel now that the U.S.
is determined to reduce Japan to a
second- or third-class power in view
of Hull's adamant attitude at his
conferences with Nomura.
On the other hand, he may still
feel that Japan can survive as a
first-class power without risking
an American war, in which Brit
ain unquestionably would take
part.
Whatever he decides will deter
mine the membership of the new
cabinet and the future of Ameri
can-Japanese relations.
In the past Hirohito's policy
toward the Occident has been one
of watching and waiting — to see
which way the wind is blowing,
then blowing with it. Japan signed
up with the Axis powers at a time
when they were riding the crest,
then backed water when the U.S.
and Britain talked, and acted tough.

Japan's position is desperate. The
Allied embargo has deprived her of

JAPAN is holding the pcace of the
* Pacific in her avowedly itching
fingers. Last night Konoye's cabi
net toppled after teetering danger
ously for several weeks. With it
crashed almost the last hope for a
settlement of U.S.-Japanese differ
ences.
Almost the last hope, ln'cause
one slim 011c remains. If the Army
hotheads take over the government
the chances for war are better
than even. But if a new group of
moderates steps in to form the
next cabinet, yesterday's develop
ment will he nothing more than
an added incident in the Japanese
war of nerves.
For the last ten years a constant
.struggle has threatened to rip Japa
nese domestic politics wide open. It
has been the Army against the gov
ernment. The extremists against
the moderates.
In four years of war as many
cabinets have fallen because of
bitter disagreement over foreign
policy. The Army pressure groups
are the closest to the German fifth
column in Japan. There is abso
lutely no question about what it
would mean if the militarists take
over: it would mean war.
The Army realizes that if it is
going to fight at all it must fight
now, before the already strangling
Anglo-American economic blockade
squeezes the very life out of the
Nipponese military machine.
