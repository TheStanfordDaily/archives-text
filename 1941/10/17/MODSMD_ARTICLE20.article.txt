# F.D.R. Watches Nippon Crisis
## Japanese Situation Causes U.S. Parley 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UP).—
President Roosevelt today canceled
a scheduled meeting with the cabi
net and conferred instead for two
hours with top military and State
Department advisers on the new
crisis in Japan precipitated by the
fall of the cabinet of Prince Fumi
maro Konoye.
Neither the White House nor the
conferees would discuss the confer
ence or the new threat in the Far
East. But other informed quarters
regarded the situation as grave.
JAPAN MAY FIGHT
Fall of the Konoye regime was in
terpreted by some as reflecting the
collapse of so-called "peace talks
which have been under way be
tween Washington and Tokyo for
two months. The possibility that
Japan may strike a blow for her
Axis partners by attacking the Rus
sian maritime provinces or resume
her drive to the south was seen in
other quarters.
There was speculation, too, that
; Japan might cause an explosion in
the Pacific by interfering with ships
carrying United States aid to Rus
sia via the Siberian port of Vladi
vostok. The vessels must pass
through "Japanese-controlled" wa
ters.
No official comment on the fall of
the Konoye regime was forthcom
ing immediately. At the capitol,
backers of the administration's for
eign policies and non-intervention
ists alike agreed that the threat in
the Pacific had been intensified.
SENATORS TAKE STAND
Senator Claude A. Pepper, D.,
Fla., who frequently has anticipated
the President's foreign policy moves,
demanded that the United States
"immobilize" Japan before this
country's position is further imper
iled. Senator Lister Hill, D., Ala.,
favored taking every step necessary
"to insure in every way our secu
rity."
It will mean a "serious hour for
us" if the new Japanese cabinet is
put in the hands of "an all-out mili
tary group," said Senator Gerald P.
Nye, R., N.D., a leader of the non
interventionists.
Before the Konoye cabinet col
lapsed, Senator Burton K. Wheeler,
i D., Mont., had taken sharp issue
] with Pepper's stand. He doubted
1 that. Japan would be "crazy enough
I to go to war with us."

No official comment on the fall of
the Konoye regime was forthcom
ing immediately. At the capitol,
backers of the administration's for
eign policies and non-intervention
ists alike agreed that the threat in
the Pacific had been intensified.
SENATORS TAKE STAND
Senator Claude A. Pepper, D.,
Fla., who frequently has anticipated
the President's foreign policy moves,
demanded that the United States
"immobilize" Japan before this
country's position is further imper
iled. Senator Lister Hill, D., Ala.,
favored taking every step necessary
"to insure in every way our secu
rity."
It will mean a "serious hour for
us" if the new Japanese cabinet is
put in the hands of "an all-out mili
tary group," said Senator Gerald P.
Nye, R., N.D., a leader of the non
interventionists.
Before the Konoye cabinet col
lapsed, Senator Burton K. Wheeler,
i D., Mont., had taken sharp issue
] with Pepper's stand. He doubted
1 that. Japan would be "crazy enough
I to go to war with us."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UP).—
President Roosevelt today canceled
a scheduled meeting with the cabi
net and conferred instead for two
hours with top military and State
Department advisers on the new
crisis in Japan precipitated by the
fall of the cabinet of Prince Fumi
maro Konoye.
Neither the White House nor the
conferees would discuss the confer
ence or the new threat in the Far
East. But other informed quarters
regarded the situation as grave.
JAPAN MAY FIGHT
Fall of the Konoye regime was in
terpreted by some as reflecting the
collapse of so-called "peace talks
which have been under way be
tween Washington and Tokyo for
two months. The possibility that
Japan may strike a blow for her
Axis partners by attacking the Rus
sian maritime provinces or resume
her drive to the south was seen in
other quarters.
There was speculation, too, that
; Japan might cause an explosion in
the Pacific by interfering with ships
carrying United States aid to Rus
sia via the Siberian port of Vladi
vostok. The vessels must pass
through "Japanese-controlled" wa
ters.
