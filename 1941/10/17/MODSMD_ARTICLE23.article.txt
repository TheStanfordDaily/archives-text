TOKYO. Fri., Oct. 17 (LP). —A
premier to head what is expected
to he a strongly pro-Axis, mili
taristic government was agreed
upon today hy Japan's elder
statesmen at a long conference hut
his identity was not revealed im
mediately.
The new cabinet is expected to
have a general at its head. The
elder statesmen, consisting of nine
former premiers, including Prince
Fumimaro Konoye, whose third
government resigned Thursday in
the face of apparent collapse of
rapprochement negotiations with
the United tSatcs, chose his suc
cessor at a three-hour meeting
which ended at 4 p.m.
TOKYO, Friday, Oct. 17 (UP).—
A strongly pro-Axis, militaristic
government to guide Japan through
one of the most critical periods of
her history probably will be an
nounced late today, political quar
ters believed, after the fall of the
moderate government of Premier
Prince Fumimaro Konoye.
It was believed the Korxoye gov
ernment fell because of its failure to
reach an understanding with the
United States.
It was expected that personnel of
the new government would be an
nounced after a meeting to be held
in Konoye's official residence at 5:30
p.m. Konoye, meanwhile, upon im
perial order, is continuing to act as
Premier.
Fall of the Konoye government
came shortly after Major General
Kiyofuku Okamoto, director of tho
second section of the army general
staff, warned a meeting of Tokyo
war veterans that negotiations with
the United tSates might end in fail
ure and that "the Japanese people
should be fully prepared for the
worst."
UPHOLD SPIRIT
Asserting that Washington had
shown no appreciation of Japan's
position and that "there is a limit to
concessions by Japan,' the general
emphasized the need to strengthen
the nation's internal wartime struc
ture of upper national defense.
He said that Japanese foreign
policy must uphold firmly the spirit
of the three-power treaty among this
country, Germany and Italy.
Well - informed political quarters
said it was virtually certain that
Konoye, who has headed three gov
ernments since the undeclared war
with China started, would not as
sume the premiership again and
some experts expected a "surprise
selection" involving a personality
not heretofore mentioned.
It was universally conceded that
Konoye's failure to reach an agree
ment with the United States for a
general understanding with regard
to the Far East led to the cabinet's
fall. Most political quarters wero
confident the new government will
be strongly pro-Axis and militaris
tic.

TOKYO. Fri., Oct. 17 (LP). —A
premier to head what is expected
to he a strongly pro-Axis, mili
taristic government was agreed
upon today hy Japan's elder
statesmen at a long conference hut
his identity was not revealed im
mediately.
The new cabinet is expected to
have a general at its head. The
elder statesmen, consisting of nine
former premiers, including Prince
Fumimaro Konoye, whose third
government resigned Thursday in
the face of apparent collapse of
rapprochement negotiations with
the United tSatcs, chose his suc
cessor at a three-hour meeting
which ended at 4 p.m.
TOKYO, Friday, Oct. 17 (UP).—
A strongly pro-Axis, militaristic
government to guide Japan through
one of the most critical periods of
her history probably will be an
nounced late today, political quar
ters believed, after the fall of the
moderate government of Premier
Prince Fumimaro Konoye.
It was believed the Korxoye gov
ernment fell because of its failure to
reach an understanding with the
United States.
It was expected that personnel of
the new government would be an
nounced after a meeting to be held
in Konoye's official residence at 5:30
p.m. Konoye, meanwhile, upon im
perial order, is continuing to act as
Premier.
Fall of the Konoye government
came shortly after Major General
Kiyofuku Okamoto, director of tho
second section of the army general
staff, warned a meeting of Tokyo
war veterans that negotiations with
the United tSates might end in fail
ure and that "the Japanese people
should be fully prepared for the
worst."
UPHOLD SPIRIT
Asserting that Washington had
shown no appreciation of Japan's
position and that "there is a limit to
concessions by Japan,' the general
emphasized the need to strengthen
the nation's internal wartime struc
ture of upper national defense.
He said that Japanese foreign
policy must uphold firmly the spirit
of the three-power treaty among this
country, Germany and Italy.
Well - informed political quarters
said it was virtually certain that
Konoye, who has headed three gov
ernments since the undeclared war
with China started, would not as
sume the premiership again and
some experts expected a "surprise
selection" involving a personality
not heretofore mentioned.
It was universally conceded that
Konoye's failure to reach an agree
ment with the United States for a
general understanding with regard
to the Far East led to the cabinet's
fall. Most political quarters wero
confident the new government will
be strongly pro-Axis and militaris
tic.
