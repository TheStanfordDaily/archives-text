Ralph Lutz, and other officials.
COMMITTEE TO BE NAMED
A separate committee to handle
the Senior Sing will be named Mon
day by the Council, Cowden said.

' ecretary, spoke to the assembled
enior representatives Tuesday night
on membership in the Alumni Asso
ciation, and informed them a special
rate is offered graduating seniors.
Mr. Hamilton rumored the associa
tion would present the seniors with
