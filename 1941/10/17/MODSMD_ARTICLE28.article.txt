# Hygiene Professor Finds Girl Of 1941 Tall, Terrific, Healthy
## 
### KAY SCHWARTZ 
She's tall, she's terrific, and above all she's healthy. That's (be Stanford
lovely of 1941.
This startling statement came from Dr. Helen I>. Pryor, professor of
hygiene and medical advisor for women. She went on to say that on the
basis of her research on weights and heights, the Stanford woman is an

4 inch and a half taller than her sis
ters of 30 years ago and a good
deal heavier. But don't worry, girls,
you have the inside track on health
and good looks, too.
REQUESTS FROM CHINA
Dr. Pryor's survey on the rela
tionship between bone structure and
weight is ihe result of many years
of investigation and has brought her
world-wide recognition. She has
received requests from China, India,
J and Oxford University to aid in nu
trition surveys these countries are
carrying on as a result of war con
ditions.
Since her graduation from the
University of Minnesota School of
Medicine in 1924, Dr. Pryor's work
in the field of pediatrics and nutri
tion has admitted her to many of
i the leading medical foundations in
the country and has carried her
i across the Pacific Ocean into the
| heart of China. During the seven
! years she spent there, she was a
i resident in the Peking Union Med
ical College, collaborated on a sub
stitute formula for milk, and was a
personal physician to many of the
socially elite Chinese women in
; Nanking. "No high class Chinese
woman would permit herself to be
seen by a man, other than her hus
band, particularly a doctor. So strong
is this tradition in old world China
| that few women receive proper
medical care, which accounts for
I much of the loss of life in child
j birth," said Dr. Pryor.
MANY HONORS
Dr. Pryor has come a long way
! from that college girl who chose the
j toughest profession in the world for
! a woman. She has a long list of
acihevements and has been honored
by medical authorities throughout
the country. It has taken a lot of
hard work and probably a lot of
] heartaches, but in Dr. Pryor's own
! words, "There is nothing more sat-
J isfying in the world than to help
I people."
