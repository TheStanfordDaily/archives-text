# A.S.U.C. Facing Administration Finance Control
## Cal Ex Committee Discusses Plan To Avoid Income Taxes 
### 
(Spccial to The Stanford Daily)
A complete financial reorganiza- j
tion of the Associated Students of i
the University of California, turning '
over in effect to the Board of Re
gents all A.S.U.C. funds was being
considered yesterday by the A.S.U.C.
Executive and Finance Committees
in joint session after several days of
secret sessions and conferences with
Administration heads.
The plan, which would place in
the hands of the University business
manager direct control over student
budgets and expenditures, was
drawn up purportedly to remove a
technicality of organization under j
which the government is charging
the A.S.U.C. income tax and to avoid
possible future excess profits taxes.
It is reported there is some feeling
on the Cal campus that the move
is being designed by the Adminis- i
tration to gain control over student :
funds and thereby have absolute
control over all student acilvities.
A1 Masters, general manager of i
the A.S.S.U., stated last night that
the plan offered is similar in basic \
pattern to Stanford's present system, j
"We have always been a depart- j
ment of the University," he said,
"and as such have not been subject
to taxation."
.Jim McKellar, present A.S.S.U.
student manager, acts for Masters
and Dr. J. P. Mitchell, treasurer of
the A.S.S.U.
According to The Daily Califor
nian, students understand the plan
does not necessitate student approv- i
al or disapproval, although the j
A.S.U.C. Ex Committee has the au
thority to sanction the reorganiza- j
tion.
The Daily Cal took no editorial
stand on the matter.
