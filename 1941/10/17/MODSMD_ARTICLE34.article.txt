# Gaieties Singers Try Out Today
## 
### 
Today is the day that singing try
outs for the 1941 Gaieties will be
held. These tryouts are going to take
place on the stage of the auditorium
from 1 to 6 o'clock this afternoon
and all candidates for vocal parts in
the show are asked to bring their
own music. Marion Scott, head of
the Gaieties song department, urges
that anyone who is interested turn
out for these tryouts.
In addition to today's song trials,
Margo Crane, chief of the Gaieties
dance routine, is holding tryouts
for dancers from 4 to 6 on Mon
day. Especially wanted for the
show's dance routine are men, who,
if they qualify for the Gaieties rou
tine, are certain of getting parts in
some other portion of the produc
tion.
Asher Wilson, director of the
Gaieties, also announced yesterday
that acting tryouts for his show will
be held on Oct. 22.
