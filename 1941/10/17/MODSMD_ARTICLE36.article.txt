# Women of '44 Stage Reunion
## Women's Gym To Be Scene of Box Lunch Picnic Tomorrow 
### 
Official starting time has been
changed to 11:30 a.m. Saturday for
the parade of sophomore women
from the top of the Row to Union,
on to Lagunita and finishing at the
Women's Gym for a box lunch re
union before the Stanford-U.S.F.
game.
Original plans were for the girls
to meet at 11:45 at the A. O. Pi house
before proceeding down the Row to
pick up their ex-freshman sisters.
"With the enthusiasm being dis
played by sophomore women all over
the campus, more time will have to
be allowed to assemble at the gym,"
according to Janet Atkinson, chair
man of the event and president of
Roble last year.
Those who neglected to buy the
tickets for 40 cents being sold at
the first of the week by representa
tives in each of the women's living
groups, may still buy them by con
tacting Emily Howard, finance chair
man, at the Gamma Phi house. If it
is impossible to reach Miss How
ard, tickets for the box lunches may
be secured Saturday at the Gym.
Luncheon will be served in the
patio at 12 o'clock, and shortly after
ward the whole group will leave
together for the stadium. It is hoped
that by arriving early it will be
possible to obtain seats together in
the rooting section.
