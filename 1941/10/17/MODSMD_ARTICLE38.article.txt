# THREE TOP COACHES
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 16 (UP).â€”To
date, the men who participated in
1940's near record turnover of
coaches have been paced by an old
timer, a Johnny-come-lately and a
brash rookie. They are Tuss Mc-
Laughry, who switched from Brown
to Dartmouth; Frank Leahy, who
moved from Boston to Notre Dame;
and Paul Brown, who quit the high
school ranks to occupy the execution
chamber at Ohio State.
