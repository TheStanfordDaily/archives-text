## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1G (UP). —The House completed all but one hour
of general debate tonight on the administration-sponsored resolution to
permit arming of merchant ships and adjourned until 11 a.m. tomorrow,
with a vote on passage scheduled shortly after noon.
Democratic leaders, who predicted there would be a 100 to 150 "aye"

► vote for pasage, held the chamber in
session until 8 p.m. to facilitate
final action, after Representative
Knute Hill, D., Wash., charged the
measure was "just another step to
ward war.'
Hill declared it would be "futile"
to arm merchantmen because that
would be to invite attack. He as
sailed the administration's foreign
policies in general and declared, "I
cannot follow the President in this
un-American step."
His denunciation was one of sev
eral speeches revealing sharp splits
within both Democratic and Re
publican ranks. Several G.O.P. par
tisans praised the resolution and an
nounced they would vote for it.
Democratic leaders predicted be
fore debate started that there would
be a majority of 100 to 150 "aye"
votes on passage. Speaker Sam Ray
burn and House Majority Leader
John W. McCormack agreed that
the sudden heightening of tension
in the Far East had won new support
for the resolution.
Meanwhile two Republican Sena
tors asserted the United States will
be in the war "when Hitler says
so." Senator Alexander Wiley, R.,
Wis., declared that "our air and na
val forces are working in co-opera
tion with those of Great Britain,*
and added:
"Is that war? Well, it will be when
Hitler says so."
Senator Arthur Vandenberg, R.,
Mich., referred to the presence of
American troops in Iceland and said
"We are in a position where any
attack by the Axis powers on Iceland
would put us into war."
