# 'Duty Of U.S. To Avoid War,' Says Thomas
## Reaction from War May End Democracy For Indefinite Time 
### 
It is America's duty to keep out
of war, make American democracy
work in a war-torn world, and give
all the aid we can to Britain and
Russia without involving ourselves
in the conflict, Nonnan Thomas,
leader of the American Socialist
Party, to'"! the Palo Alto World
Problem' Club yesterday.
Mr. T iOmas predicted a grave re
action will follow America's entry
into the world conflict. At first this
reaction will be chaos and confusion,
which will offer an opportunity for
the seizure of power by some dema
gogue, who will end democracy in
the United States for an indefinite
period, Thomas said.
The Socialist Party's candidate
for the Presidency in the past sev
eral elections went on to express his
views on the probable immediate
outcome of the war if we go in. The
peace settlement will be based on
the Roosevelt - Churchill "eight
points," which are "Wilson's fourteen
points watered down and warmed
up,' he said. A victory based on
this program of armed exploitation
of the world in the interests of the
English-speaking peoples is not
worth the price America will have
to pay if she enters the war, Mr.
Thomas concluded.
PEACE BY EXHAUSTION
However, if we enter the war and
thus prolong its conclusion, the final
outcome will be a peace by ex
haustion as the result of the com
petitive starvation of the fighting
countries, Mr. Thomas stated.
"Never can any war defend or
preserve democracy, it can only sac
rifice it," he declared vehemently.
The advantages of our staying out
greatly overshadow those of our go
ing in, Mr. Thomas said.
If we stay out, we will give the
Europeans new hope in the future,
we will have more to offer to the
anti-Axis nations, and we will be
able to propose a more lasting and
logical peace, he continued.
UNFORTUNATE' SPEECH
When questioned on Lindbergh's
Des Moines address, Thomas termed
it "unfortunate." He said that the
America First Committee, of which
he is not a member, handled the
speech poorly; but that the condem
nation of it by Walter Winchell and
Liberty magazine did much more
harm than the speech itself.

views on the probable immediate
outcome of the war if we go in. The
peace settlement will be based on
the Roosevelt - Churchill "eight
points," which are "Wilson's fourteen
points watered down and warmed
up,' he said. A victory based on
this program of armed exploitation
of the world in the interests of the
English-speaking peoples is not
worth the price America will have
to pay if she enters the war, Mr.
Thomas concluded.
PEACE BY EXHAUSTION
However, if we enter the war and
thus prolong its conclusion, the final
outcome will be a peace by ex
haustion as the result of the com
petitive starvation of the fighting
countries, Mr. Thomas stated.
"Never can any war defend or
preserve democracy, it can only sac
rifice it," he declared vehemently.
The advantages of our staying out
greatly overshadow those of our go
ing in, Mr. Thomas said.
If we stay out, we will give the
Europeans new hope in the future,
we will have more to offer to the
anti-Axis nations, and we will be
able to propose a more lasting and
logical peace, he continued.
UNFORTUNATE' SPEECH
When questioned on Lindbergh's
Des Moines address, Thomas termed
it "unfortunate." He said that the
America First Committee, of which
he is not a member, handled the
speech poorly; but that the condem
nation of it by Walter Winchell and
Liberty magazine did much more
harm than the speech itself.
It is America's duty to keep out
of war, make American democracy
work in a war-torn world, and give
all the aid we can to Britain and
Russia without involving ourselves
in the conflict, Nonnan Thomas,
leader of the American Socialist
Party, to'"! the Palo Alto World
Problem' Club yesterday.
Mr. T iOmas predicted a grave re
action will follow America's entry
into the world conflict. At first this
reaction will be chaos and confusion,
which will offer an opportunity for
the seizure of power by some dema
gogue, who will end democracy in
the United States for an indefinite
period, Thomas said.
