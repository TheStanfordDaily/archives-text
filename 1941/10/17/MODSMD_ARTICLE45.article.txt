# 'Far Off Hills' Starts Oct. 22
## 
### 
Complete with an authentic Irish
brogue, "The Far OfT Hills," the
comedy chosen by the Stanford
Players for their first show of the
season, is now in the final stages of
production. Dress rehearsals will be
held Monday and Tuesday. The
curtain of the Little Theater will
rise on the famous Abbey Theater
comedy on Wednesday, Oct. 22.
The play is the story of Marion
Clancy, young, beautiful, and domi
nating, who manages her father and
two younger sisters with an iron
hand. After devious machinations,
and to the relief of her family, Mar
ion is finally won by Pierce Hegarty,
an equally dominating character,
who first tells her off and then,
promising that she can run the town,
marries her.
The actors, who have been prac
ticing their accent with recordings,
are Sylvia Berry, Frank Burt,
Nancy Burkett, Kitty Belle Tippetts,
Brownlee Corrin, Dave Farmer, Bcr
nice Linden, Charles Howe, Lyle
Mayer, and Georgia Haviland. Di
rector is Charles Vance, and tech
nical director is William Girvan.
"The Far OH Hills" (that always
look the greenest) was first pre
sented in Dublin, and was intro
duced to this country in 1932. The
characters are typical, middle-class
Irish, full of vitality and natural
humor.
Nearly a complete sellout already,
tickets may still be obtained for all
nights, Oct. 22-27, for 75 cents plus
tax. They are available in the
speech and drama office in Memo
rial Hall.
Movies of the Nova-Louis bout are
considered so dull that only flashes
of the knockdown will be circulated
throughout the states.
