# U.S.F. Preparing Grimly For Massacre by Indians, Says Don Sports Editor
## 
### GENE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor, San Francisco Foghorn
Bewildered by tlu> events of last Sunday afternoon when an amaz
ingly rejuvenated Galloping Gael ran roughshod over them, the Univer
sity of San Francisco Dons have settled grimly to the task of stemming
what to all outward appearances should he another Indian massacre.
lileak indeed is the outlook for followers of the green and gold and

it's a far cry from the high pregame
hopes of just one year ago, the
year that U.S.F. acted as the spring
board for a meteoric rise to the grid
iron heights. However, don't be mis
lead by the word bleak. It by no
means implies that there is no hope
at all or that the Dons are ready to
concede the game to their worthy
opponent. U.S.F. will be able to mus
ter a team that might possibly sur
prise a good many people.
No doubt Stanford will be on the
warpath as a result of their defeat
at the hands of Oregon State, but
remember that the Dons may be a
little peeved after the St. Mary's
affair. Stanford has a great passer in
Frankie Albert but U.S.F. has a
pair of sophomores who can also
throw a football around with con
siderable skill. They are Neill Sheri
dan and Hal Johnston, both break
away threats at all times.
INJURIES PLAGUE DONS
Injuries that have plagued the
already thin Don ranks throughout
the season are again playing havoc
wit h U.S.F. chances. Phil Kearney,
hard-hitting fullback, senior first
year man, and student body presi
dent, will be a doubtful participant.
So too are a pair of giant regular
guards, namely Stan Mohr and Val
March i.
Perhaps the most glaring weak
ness in the U.S.F. setup is, as we all
know, pass defense, and a weakness
in that department is just about
fatal against Stanford. Imagine
what a passer like Albert will do
when Podesto of St. Mary's, an un
heralded back, can complete seven
passes in a row and wind up the
day with an average of 12 for 18. One
reason for this situation is that all
the Don backs are small and are no
match for long-legged ends. Unless
JefT Cravath can work out a solution
for this knotty problem right away,
Frankie Albert may have a field day
on the morrow.
U.S.F. MORALE HIGH
U.S.F. spirit and morale is very
high among both players and the
student body. The spirit of the root
ers in times of adversity has been
remarkable. Last Sunday for ex
ample, when the team was in the
hole for five touchdowns, the root
ing section was still four or five
times louder in volume of yells and
encouragement than was St. Mary's.
From our seat way up here on the
Hilltop it looks as though Stanford
carries too many guns for the Dons.
If U.S.F. was at full strength the
outlook might be brighter. Never
theless, football is as unpredictable
as the weather, so too is U.S.F. and
she might give Stanford quite a scare
before that game is over tomorrow
afternoon.
