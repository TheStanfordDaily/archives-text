# Huskies Picked As 'Dark Horse'
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16 (UP).â€”
Peg those University of Washington
Huskies as the real dark horse
threat in this wide-open scramble
for top honors in the Pacific Coast
Conference football rodeo this year.
The Huskies, who play U.C.L.A. in
Seattle Saturday, have turned up
with a pair of sensational sophomores
who may make Seattle forget the
McAdams, Muchas, Johnstons, Cru
vers, and even the George Wilsons
of yesteryears.
The sophomores, fullback Meir
Brooks and halfback Bob Barrett,
have had just one workout, and
they wrecked Washington State in
their trial run.
