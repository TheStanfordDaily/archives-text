# FIRE BOYS TOP INTRAMURAL GRID
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Of the 50 teams in the Stanford
1941 intramural grid race, 49 are
contenders or ex-contenders and the
Firehouse is the champion until
someone produces a running-passing
combination that can equal Monte
Pfyl & Co.
Three hopefuls who have looked
hopeful, Zeta Psi, Delta Chi, and
Sigma Nu, play tonight against Kap
pa Alpha, Business School, and Phi
Psi I respectively. In the other en
counters, Medical School I meets El
Toro, and S A.E. tangles with Med
ical School 11.
LEAGUE No. 1
Firehouse, with defeats of Fiji
and Tigre to its credit, waits for real
opposition to develop in its league.
Fiji could easily come back to be
this team, with Campo a possibility,
and Tigre and Alpha Sigma Phi
warring over the cellar.
LEAGUE No. 2
Medical School I shares a one-win
lead with Toro until tonight's out-

come. Theta Delta Chi and Los
Arcos bring up the middle with a
win and a loss apiece, and the un
lucky Japanese Club wails at the
bottom, capable yet of some giant
killing.
LEAGUE No. :]
Sequoia has two wins on the debit
tide of its ledger, and an unknown
SA.E. squad on the credit side to
worry about. Otherwise the picture
is clear with Cuadro, Theta Chi, and
Medical School II not dangerous on
the basis of performance thus far.
LEAGUE No. 4
Frank Wells heads a powerful
Kappa Sigma aerial crew which
shares the lead with Delta Tau Delia
at two wins each. The two meet
Tuesday at 5:00 in a game that will
settle the issue. Phi Delta Theta,
Sigma Chi, and El Capitan will han
dle the rest between themselves.
LEAGUE No. 5
This is the hot spot of the circuit.
Wednesday at 5:00 the Zetes meet
the Delta Chi's in a mix that might
spot the main challenger in the cir
cuit, providing there are no upsets
tonight. Business School comes
third, and Theta Xi and Kappa Al
pha divide what honor is left.
LEAGUE No. C
Beta Theta Pi. Breakers, Chi Psi.
and Delta Upsilon are all guesses as
yet. Breakers and Beta on com
parative scores are the strongest,
with D.U. close behind.

LEAGUE No. 7
Twice winners, the Dekes should j
have little trouble in carrying on. I
A.T.O. has one win and no losses I
for runner-up laurels, and Phi Kap |
must be classed as a possibility.
LEAGUE No. 8
Sigma Nu rolled up 37 points in '
its first game, and is out tonight to
show what if anything that means.
Phi Psi I is opening its year tonight,
winning its first on a forfeit. Alpha
Delt has one win to its credit, and :
A.K.L. and Branner are well lodged
in the basement.
FRESHMAN LEAGUES !>. 10
The second floor boys in Encina.
both E and W, have a grid monopoly |
thus far with two wins in Leagues 9 j
and 10, respectively. 3E and 3W I
have two losses and a dismal out- l
look, the others are in-betweens, j
Encina Basement has a powerhouse \
that will have to be reckoned with.

LEAGUE No. 5
This is the hot spot of the circuit.
Wednesday at 5:00 the Zetes meet
the Delta Chi's in a mix that might
spot the main challenger in the cir
cuit, providing there are no upsets
tonight. Business School comes
third, and Theta Xi and Kappa Al
pha divide what honor is left.
LEAGUE No. C
Beta Theta Pi. Breakers, Chi Psi.
and Delta Upsilon are all guesses as
yet. Breakers and Beta on com
parative scores are the strongest,
with D.U. close behind.

LEAGUE No. 7
Twice winners, the Dekes should j
have little trouble in carrying on. I
A.T.O. has one win and no losses I
for runner-up laurels, and Phi Kap |
must be classed as a possibility.
LEAGUE No. 8
Sigma Nu rolled up 37 points in '
its first game, and is out tonight to
show what if anything that means.
Phi Psi I is opening its year tonight,
winning its first on a forfeit. Alpha
Delt has one win to its credit, and :
A.K.L. and Branner are well lodged
in the basement.

The second floor boys in Encina.
both E and W, have a grid monopoly |
thus far with two wins in Leagues 9 j
and 10, respectively. 3E and 3W I
have two losses and a dismal out- l
look, the others are in-betweens, j
Encina Basement has a powerhouse \
that will have to be reckoned with.
Of the 50 teams in the Stanford
1941 intramural grid race, 49 are
contenders or ex-contenders and the
Firehouse is the champion until
someone produces a running-passing
combination that can equal Monte
Pfyl & Co.
Three hopefuls who have looked
hopeful, Zeta Psi, Delta Chi, and
Sigma Nu, play tonight against Kap
pa Alpha, Business School, and Phi
Psi I respectively. In the other en
counters, Medical School I meets El
Toro, and S A.E. tangles with Med
ical School 11.
LEAGUE No. 1
Firehouse, with defeats of Fiji
and Tigre to its credit, waits for real
opposition to develop in its league.
Fiji could easily come back to be
this team, with Campo a possibility,
and Tigre and Alpha Sigma Phi
warring over the cellar.
LEAGUE No. 2
Medical School I shares a one-win
lead with Toro until tonight's out-

come. Theta Delta Chi and Los
Arcos bring up the middle with a
win and a loss apiece, and the un
lucky Japanese Club wails at the
bottom, capable yet of some giant
killing.
LEAGUE No. :]
Sequoia has two wins on the debit
tide of its ledger, and an unknown
SA.E. squad on the credit side to
worry about. Otherwise the picture
is clear with Cuadro, Theta Chi, and
Medical School II not dangerous on
the basis of performance thus far.
LEAGUE No. 4
Frank Wells heads a powerful
