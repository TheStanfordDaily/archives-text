# Second Floor Takes Encina Track Meet
## 
### 
Encina second floor captured the
hall track title yesterday afternoon,
defeating the champion first floor
team of last spring in the second an
nual Encina track meet under the
scrutinizing eye of Coach Franklin
P. Johnson on Angell Field.
Star of the meet was John Fulton,
ace miler from Los Angeles, who
annexed both the 440 and the 880.
His quarter-mile time was 51.4,
while he ran the half in 2 minutes
4.9. These times so early in the
season stamp him as one of the
best distance prospects to enter
Stanford in a decade.
Contesting Fulton for top honors
was "Flynn" McLin, sprinter. He
ran to a clean-cut victory in the
220 and tied with Dick Hambleton
for first in the 100.
Gordon Gray's win in the mile
completed the list of flat races. Gray
coasted to a 5:01.9 win. The per
formances in the hurdle races and
field events did not produce marks
equal to those already mentioned.
The inter-floor meet in which
50 men competed was the first in a
series of track and cross-country
events which Coach Johnson has
scheduled for both varsity and
frosh competitors.
'45 CROSS-COUNTRYMEN
MEET LOWEI.I, TOMORROW
Stanford's 1941 cross-country sea
son will open tomorrow at 10:30 on
the golf course when the frosh team
races Lowell High School's squad.
Although the Papoose team, with
out any competition behind it, is an
unknown quantity, such men as
John Fulton and Gordon Gray make
the team appear to be a winner.
Backing Fulton and Gray are Bob
Sears, George Grimes, Earl Rex, and
Jim Doty. In workouts so far this
fall Fulton has appeared to be the
better man at times, but on other
afternoons Gray takes his measure.
One week from tomorrow the frosh
take on the varsity in a practice
meet, which should be close despite
the academic difference. The var
sity team's first actual meet will be
with the Olympic Club's perpetually
strong aggregation on November 1.
Stanford made 80 substitutions
during the Oregon game.
