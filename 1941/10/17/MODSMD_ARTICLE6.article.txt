# Model 'T' Launches Comeback Tomorrow Against Hilltoppers
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
Stanford launches a comcback to
morrow afternoon against the Uni
versity of -San Francisco in the
Stadium.
Stopped cold by Oregon State last
week after twelve straight victories,
the Indians will be heavy favorites
over the Dons. Some 15,000 fans will
witness the rejuvenation of Clark
Shaughncssy's ball club, fully ex
pecting the Cards to get back on the
victory trail.
U.S.F. is woefully weak this year,
having lost 30-0 to St. Mary's, which
in turn lost to mediocre Cal 33-0.
But the Dons have a crafty coach
in Jeff Cravath, who helped map out
U.S.C.'s defense against the "T" last
year. Then San Francisco has a
couple of backs that might give
Stanford trouble, including Pete
Franceschi who has run his head off
against Indian football and rugby
teams for the last two years.
The Dons' best new back is Hal
Johnston, a fast transfer from Mon
tebello. Neill Sheridan is overdue
as a ball-packer. He and his team
mates piled up almost 300 yards
against St. Mary's without a score,
convincing proof that U.S.F. might
look pretty good some day with a
few breaks.
DONS LOST IN 10
Last year the Dons were in on the
unveiling of the "T" and the poor
Hilltoppers didn't know what was
coming off after the first ten minutes.
They wound up on the short end
0-27. This year they miss "Tiger"
Dan Fisk and his plunging brother,
Cliff, the two boys that sparked
U.S.F. in the early stages of the 1940
season.
Both teams will go into tomorrow's
game minus some of their best men.
The Dons arc without the services
of Phil Kearney, an outstanding ball
packer, and Stan Mohr, veteran
guard. Ben Petrini takes over the
right guard spot and Pete Fran
ceschi will probably play full in
\ Kearney's place.
Stanford has temporarily lost Pete
Kmetovic, Arnie Meiners, and Hank
Norberg, although all three arc ex
pected to make the trip to Washing
ton next week-end. Pete is laid low
! with a back injury and watched
j yesterday's workout in a sweatsuit.
LEG BOTHERS MEINERS
Meiners is still bothered by a bad
leg and visited a specialist in San
Francisco a couple of days ago to
make sure lie wasn't through for the
year. Arnie played almost 60 min
i utes at Corvallis and was badly
battered by the Beavers.
Hank Norberg suited up yesterday
but didn't work out. He still has a
j bum leg from the U.C.L.A. game.
With the Cards hard up for ends,
' fans may see some new faces on the
| wing tomorrow. Jack Francis, who
I has been playing guard for two
j years, took a turn at left end yes
terday, catching some of Albert's and
j Hammett's passes. Bob Mastin is
expected to get the call opposite
Freddie Meyer, with Rog Laverty
and Bill Symes backing up. Meyer
looked better than ever snagging
{ long ones yesterday.
Kmetovic's left half spot is a
toss-up between Frankie Forbes and
A1 Cole, tv/o little speedy guys who
lack Perfect Pete's open-field abil
ity. Milt Vucinich, who only carried
the ball half a dozen times against
Oregon State, had an impressive av
erage for the day and is bound to
see more action on power stuff to
, morrow. Early in the week. Shaugh
nessy worked almost entirely on
passing plays but yesterday he had
the two quarterbacks mixing them
up with line smashes.
It begins to look like Stanford is
going to go through them or over
| them and not around the ends, at
least until Kmet returns.
For the Dons", Franceschi will take
over Kearney's fullback position,
Gene Benedetti and Vic Ramus will
be at h;ilves, and Neill Sheridan,
quarterback. Ramus does the kick
ing and has turned in a dependable
performance so far this season.
Stanford fans will remember Doc
Haley, veteran tackle, but will get
their first peek at Val Marchi, 220-
pound sophomore guard who is one
1 of the mainstays in the Don line.
