### BY DON SELBY 
IF YOU can believe those who should know, Stanford's football team is
going to start the long climb up the victory ladder again tomorrow at the
expense of the lowly U.S.F. Dons.
Quite probably they're right. The Indians certainly should take the
Hilltoppers down another notch, if there is any lower a notch than the
one already occupied by Jeff Cravath's lads.
Despite the knowledge that it's a very good thing for Stanford that the
Dons are scheduled for this week-end, we can't seem to get excited about
1 the fray. For some reason, we've a hunch that the outcome is going to be
i disappointing. Not that we think the Big Red Machine will be denied, for
that would be as logical as concluding that Hitler will give the conquered
countries their freedom.

But Frank C. Albert Scoring
(without Pete Kmetovic) Com
pany is just going to have to
trounce the Hilltoppers so thor
oughly to satisfy the public that
the result will be one of two
things: (1) U.S.F. will be over
whelmed, walloped, and mas
i sacred and the contest will be a
pitiful affair, or (2) the Dons will
put up a good showing and keep
, the Indians from walking away
with the game, with the result that
everyone will immediately con
; elude that the Stanford lads
| really are off the beam.
a very heartening outlook, is
it.' But when you think it over,
there are good points to either out
come. In the first one, the Stanford
band wagon would be very happy,
for to that group it matters not how
well the game is played but rather
how big a score the Injuns pile up.
In the seconu case, the team would
! probably benefit, as long as no one
gets hurt, for it would probably

make the Washington Huskies the favorites next week, providing, of course,
the latter outfit downs Ucla in Seattle.
* * * *
SCHEDULED to open at the left halfback spot left vacant by Kmetovic's
inability to play tomorrow is either A1 Cole or Frank Forbes, both
scooter-type backs.
Ever since we saw Cole run wild as a frosh, we've been waiting to
see this lad, who is one of the hardest boys to bring down you can find
in this loop, go all the way in varsity competition. He's terrifically
tricky, but quite often his own cleverness betrays him. for while he's
dancing around in one spot evading tacklers. he's gaining little or no
ground.
The fact that U.S.F. isn't too strong an opponent makes tomorrow's
game an excellent opportunity for the coaching staff to see what these
boys can really do. And they may have to carry the whole load again the
following week, when the Cards clash with Washington, for it's not yet
certain that Kmetovic will be able to play in that game either. You never
can tell but what Clark Shaughnessy will have moved another man to
that position by then, though.
The same situation holds true at the left end spot, Arnie Meiners and
Hank Norberg being the doubtful quantities there. Bob Mastin and Roger
Laverty will do most of the work at that position tomorrow.

J UC'KY LOUIE'S air mail letter, which arrived yesterday, brought the
following grid picks:
Washington over U.C.L.A.
U.S.C. over Washington State
Oregon over California
Santa Clara over Michigan State
Stanford over U.S.F.
Since Oregon State is idle tomorrow, the above results would leave the
conference race virtually unchanged, although it would shove Oregon
into a mathematical lead because of more games played and won. The
Bruins would also drop down and Washington would move up even with
the Cards and Beavers. But it would still make little difference in the
race.
* * J* s(t
looking for Shaughnessy's boys to turn on a power attack in
no uncertain manner tomorrow. With the showing that Milt Vuci
nich has made in that department in the games to date, plus the drive
ol Hoot Armstrong and Bill Sheller, the Indians now appear to be in
better shape for a power game than at any time in the past.
The passing game that was such an important factor in Stanford's
success last season probably won't be at its best tomorrow for, al
though Albert is every bit—and more—the pitcher he was a year ago,
the boys on the receiving end aren't up to par with Meiners, Norberg,
and Kmetovic out of commission.
Albert's favorite receiver will probably be Fred Meyer, but you*
can't pitch all day 1m the same guy. Armstrong, Laverty, Cole, Forbes,
and Mastin arc all comparatively short gridders.
Of course* the Dons arent' too sharp on pass defense, as Johnny
Podesto proved in the Gael-U.S.F. game last Sunday, which may even
things up.

J UC'KY LOUIE'S air mail letter, which arrived yesterday, brought the
following grid picks:
Washington over U.C.L.A.
U.S.C. over Washington State
Oregon over California
Santa Clara over Michigan State
Stanford over U.S.F.
Since Oregon State is idle tomorrow, the above results would leave the
conference race virtually unchanged, although it would shove Oregon
into a mathematical lead because of more games played and won. The
Bruins would also drop down and Washington would move up even with
the Cards and Beavers. But it would still make little difference in the
race.

looking for Shaughnessy's boys to turn on a power attack in
no uncertain manner tomorrow. With the showing that Milt Vuci
nich has made in that department in the games to date, plus the drive
ol Hoot Armstrong and Bill Sheller, the Indians now appear to be in
better shape for a power game than at any time in the past.
The passing game that was such an important factor in Stanford's
success last season probably won't be at its best tomorrow for, al
though Albert is every bit—and more—the pitcher he was a year ago,
the boys on the receiving end aren't up to par with Meiners, Norberg,
and Kmetovic out of commission.
Albert's favorite receiver will probably be Fred Meyer, but you*
can't pitch all day 1m the same guy. Armstrong, Laverty, Cole, Forbes,
and Mastin arc all comparatively short gridders.
Of course* the Dons arent' too sharp on pass defense, as Johnny
Podesto proved in the Gael-U.S.F. game last Sunday, which may even

IF YOU can believe those who should know, Stanford's football team is
going to start the long climb up the victory ladder again tomorrow at the
expense of the lowly U.S.F. Dons.
Quite probably they're right. The Indians certainly should take the
Hilltoppers down another notch, if there is any lower a notch than the
one already occupied by Jeff Cravath's lads.
Despite the knowledge that it's a very good thing for Stanford that the
Dons are scheduled for this week-end, we can't seem to get excited about
1 the fray. For some reason, we've a hunch that the outcome is going to be
i disappointing. Not that we think the Big Red Machine will be denied, for
that would be as logical as concluding that Hitler will give the conquered
countries their freedom.

But Frank C. Albert Scoring
(without Pete Kmetovic) Com
pany is just going to have to
trounce the Hilltoppers so thor
oughly to satisfy the public that
the result will be one of two
things: (1) U.S.F. will be over
whelmed, walloped, and mas
i sacred and the contest will be a
pitiful affair, or (2) the Dons will
put up a good showing and keep

there are good points to either out
come. In the first one, the Stanford
band wagon would be very happy,
for to that group it matters not how
well the game is played but rather
how big a score the Injuns pile up.
In the seconu case, the team would
! probably benefit, as long as no one
gets hurt, for it would probably

make the Washington Huskies the favorites next week, providing, of course,
the latter outfit downs Ucla in Seattle.
* * * *
SCHEDULED to open at the left halfback spot left vacant by Kmetovic's
inability to play tomorrow is either A1 Cole or Frank Forbes, both
scooter-type backs.
Ever since we saw Cole run wild as a frosh, we've been waiting to
see this lad, who is one of the hardest boys to bring down you can find
in this loop, go all the way in varsity competition. He's terrifically
tricky, but quite often his own cleverness betrays him. for while he's
dancing around in one spot evading tacklers. he's gaining little or no
ground.
The fact that U.S.F. isn't too strong an opponent makes tomorrow's
game an excellent opportunity for the coaching staff to see what these
boys can really do. And they may have to carry the whole load again the
following week, when the Cards clash with Washington, for it's not yet
certain that Kmetovic will be able to play in that game either. You never

SCHEDULED to open at the left halfback spot left vacant by Kmetovic's
inability to play tomorrow is either A1 Cole or Frank Forbes, both
scooter-type backs.
Ever since we saw Cole run wild as a frosh, we've been waiting to
see this lad, who is one of the hardest boys to bring down you can find
in this loop, go all the way in varsity competition. He's terrifically
tricky, but quite often his own cleverness betrays him. for while he's
dancing around in one spot evading tacklers. he's gaining little or no
ground.
The fact that U.S.F. isn't too strong an opponent makes tomorrow's
game an excellent opportunity for the coaching staff to see what these
boys can really do. And they may have to carry the whole load again the
following week, when the Cards clash with Washington, for it's not yet
certain that Kmetovic will be able to play in that game either. You never
can tell but what Clark Shaughnessy will have moved another man to
that position by then, though.
The same situation holds true at the left end spot, Arnie Meiners and
Hank Norberg being the doubtful quantities there. Bob Mastin and Roger
Laverty will do most of the work at that position tomorrow.

J UC'KY LOUIE'S air mail letter, which arrived yesterday, brought the
following grid picks:
Washington over U.C.L.A.
U.S.C. over Washington State
Oregon over California
Santa Clara over Michigan State
Stanford over U.S.F.
Since Oregon State is idle tomorrow, the above results would leave the
conference race virtually unchanged, although it would shove Oregon
into a mathematical lead because of more games played and won. The
Bruins would also drop down and Washington would move up even with
the Cards and Beavers. But it would still make little difference in the
race.

looking for Shaughnessy's boys to turn on a power attack in
no uncertain manner tomorrow. With the showing that Milt Vuci
nich has made in that department in the games to date, plus the drive
ol Hoot Armstrong and Bill Sheller, the Indians now appear to be in
better shape for a power game than at any time in the past.
The passing game that was such an important factor in Stanford's
success last season probably won't be at its best tomorrow for, al
though Albert is every bit—and more—the pitcher he was a year ago,
the boys on the receiving end aren't up to par with Meiners, Norberg,
and Kmetovic out of commission.
Albert's favorite receiver will probably be Fred Meyer, but you*
can't pitch all day 1m the same guy. Armstrong, Laverty, Cole, Forbes,
and Mastin arc all comparatively short gridders.
Of course* the Dons arent' too sharp on pass defense, as Johnny
Podesto proved in the Gael-U.S.F. game last Sunday, which may even

IF YOU can believe those who should know, Stanford's football team is
going to start the long climb up the victory ladder again tomorrow at the
expense of the lowly U.S.F. Dons.
Quite probably they're right. The Indians certainly should take the
Hilltoppers down another notch, if there is any lower a notch than the
one already occupied by Jeff Cravath's lads.
Despite the knowledge that it's a very good thing for Stanford that the
Dons are scheduled for this week-end, we can't seem to get excited about
1 the fray. For some reason, we've a hunch that the outcome is going to be
i disappointing. Not that we think the Big Red Machine will be denied, for
that would be as logical as concluding that Hitler will give the conquered
countries their freedom.
