# Cards Aim for First Conference Crown in Five Years; Meet Bruins
## 
### 
Revenge will he in order for the Stanford varsity water polo team this
afternoon when it faces the powerful U.C.L.A. Bruins in the Encina pools
at 4:15.
Two defeats, 15 to 5 and 5 to 4. were administered to Stanford by the
Bruins last year. Fred Manwaring, Iladlcy Bacon. Boh Jones, Frank

â™¦ Mitchell, Jack Bleecker, and Bob
Breckner from that 1940 Cardinal
j team return lor action this year with
a thirst for revenge.
The contest also will go a long ;
way toward deciding the feud be
tween Coach Norton Thornton of
Stanford and Don Parks of U.C.L.A.
Since Parks came to West wood, the
Bruins and Indians have each won
eight games.
Despite the return of a pair of all I
conference Bruin forwards, Bill
Mitchell and Johnny Segal, from last
year, Stanford's potentially power- ;
ful squad is a slight favorite to win. !
i Thornton's own all conference j
player, Guard and Captain Frank j
Mitchell, returns to head what
Coach Thornton already considers
one of the best outfits in Farm his
! tory.
For 20 years up to 1932. Stanford
water polo teams won their confer
: ence championship. But not since
193(3 have the Farm mermen copped
the league diadem. And U.C.L.A..
says Thornton, is "the team to beat
in the conference this year."
Teaming up with Mitchell at the
guard position is sharpshooting Jack
Bleecker, high-point man on the
! team this year and rated Mitchell's
equal by Coach Thornton.
At center back is big Bob Jones,
a 1940 veteran. Playing forward
will be Fred Man waring and Had
ley Bacon, also veterans.
On his performance in last week's |
Olympic Club game, sophomore
Pete Lee seems to have temporarily
wrested the goalie position from
transfer Bert Singer and lettermen
Bob Breckner and Ed Smith. Bill
Mapel holds a slight advantage over
Don Smith for the sprint position.
It will be up to these men to stop j
the shooting threat of Mitchell of
U.C.L.A. backed up by the passing
lof Segal. These two have developed i
into a potent scoring combination in
two years of working together.
Admission to the contest will be
free, according to Thornton.
