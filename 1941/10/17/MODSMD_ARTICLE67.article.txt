# Frosh Practice Injures Woods
## 
### 
Clement Woods, ace frosh full
back, injured his leg in scrimmage
and will probably be out for at
least two weeks as the Papooses
prepared to take it easy with no
game scheduled tomorrow. Woods
may miss the San Mateo encounter
on Nov. 1, but will definitely be
ready for the Cal Cubs Nov. 8.
So far now the Yearlings have hit
1.000 with three wins in three tries
over Long Beach J.C., Bakersfield
J.C., and the U.S.C. frosh.
The long wait between games
should put the Papeese at full
strength for the Bulldog encounter.
Jack McCurdy will no doubt be ready
to take over at center, and any other
slight injuries sustained last week
will be o.k.
Last game on the schedule after
the San Mateo go is a game with
Cal, while the varsity travels south
to engage U.S.C.
