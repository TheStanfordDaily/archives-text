# Farm, Cal Aggie Poloists to Meet
## 
### 
Ralph Grana, who took a bad spill
in the Moffett Field game Wednes
day, may not start at Number 2
when Stanford meets the Cal Aggies
polo team this afternoon at 4:30.
If Grana doesn't play, Denny
Green will be moved into the line
up. The other three positions are
pretty well set with Bill Dirker,
Mike Gates, and Ben Snure.
The Aggies have a strong team
that includes two riders of the Pat
Linfoot stables, Bill and Wes Lin
foot.
