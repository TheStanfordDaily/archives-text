### 
Aspirants for the dance chorus of
"Knickerbocker Holiday," campus
musical show now in production, are
requested to attend the rehearsal
tonight, from 4 to 5 in the Memorial
Theater. Those who have pre
viously tried out. should also be
present tonight, according to Mar
garet Jewell and Margo Crain,
dance directors.
In the words of Miss Jewell,
"Male dancers with the conventional
number of pedal extremities are
sorely needed for the dancing
chorus." Three women and four
men are in demand to fill vacant
spots in the choruses of "Young
People Think About. Love," "Scars,"
and "Nowhere to Go But Up."
