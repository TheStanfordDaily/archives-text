ONE of the most profitable and at the same
time entertaining extra-curricular functions
available to college men and women at the
University of California and at Stanford is the
anual symphony season in San Francisco —with
the best seats in the house guaranteed at re
duced price!
Stanford Chairman Dick Lyon stated yester
day the San Francisco Symphony Association
sustains a loss of three thousand dollars a sea
son to make the special concessions available to
Stanford alone, not mentioning the red ink
which is entered in the ledger so that Cal stu
dents may simultaneously enjoy the same
privilege.
This gesture, yes, it is certainly more than a
gesture, on the part of San Francisco symphony
iovers is tendered us simply because that is
what they are—lovers of good music. It is
their hope that those of us who would not ordi
narily have the opportunity to participate in
the symphonic season will take advantage of
the offer and profit by it.
The dollars and cents end of the arrangement
allows Cal and Stanford listeners season tick
ets at S9, a rate which has been hacked $6 below
the public sale figure.
This is the second consecutive year in which
the concession has been made that we may go
to the symphony in the city. This season, emi
nent musicians and artists will come down to
the Farm to lead a series of informal talks pre
vious to the concerts, a new form of "program
note" that should find wide interest. Pierre
Monteux, conductor of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, will be "number one" on the
discussion program.
There are 12 concerts to the season. They
feature artists such as Miriam Solovieff, Igor
Stravinsky, Vladimir Horowitz and Artur Ru
binstein.
Stanford is grateful to the San Francisco
Symphony Association for their gracious offer,
and will reciprocate by making the students'
part of the season a success.

when they see it.—Harold Shafer
ONE of the most profitable and at the same
time entertaining extra-curricular functions
available to college men and women at the
University of California and at Stanford is the
anual symphony season in San Francisco —with
the best seats in the house guaranteed at re
duced price!
Stanford Chairman Dick Lyon stated yester
day the San Francisco Symphony Association
sustains a loss of three thousand dollars a sea
son to make the special concessions available to
Stanford alone, not mentioning the red ink
which is entered in the ledger so that Cal stu
dents may simultaneously enjoy the same
privilege.
This gesture, yes, it is certainly more than a
gesture, on the part of San Francisco symphony
iovers is tendered us simply because that is
what they are—lovers of good music. It is
their hope that those of us who would not ordi
narily have the opportunity to participate in
the symphonic season will take advantage of
the offer and profit by it.
The dollars and cents end of the arrangement
allows Cal and Stanford listeners season tick
ets at S9, a rate which has been hacked $6 below
the public sale figure.
This is the second consecutive year in which
the concession has been made that we may go
to the symphony in the city. This season, emi
nent musicians and artists will come down to
the Farm to lead a series of informal talks pre
vious to the concerts, a new form of "program
note" that should find wide interest. Pierre
Monteux, conductor of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, will be "number one" on the
discussion program.
There are 12 concerts to the season. They
feature artists such as Miriam Solovieff, Igor
Stravinsky, Vladimir Horowitz and Artur Ru
binstein.
Stanford is grateful to the San Francisco
Symphony Association for their gracious offer,
and will reciprocate by making the students'
part of the season a success.
Stanford men and women know a good thing
when they see it.—Harold Shafer
