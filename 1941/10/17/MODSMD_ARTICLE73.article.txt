# Dear Rally Committee:

IN the past you have come in for a great deal
of criticism from the students, much deserved
and some undeserved. Now criticism, well
founded, is being leveled at you from another
source.
The Tuesday Evening Series fills Memorial
Hall with citizens of Palo Alto and other neigh
boring communities. Now these people are
good friends of Stanford and all that, but their
football spirit is not quite the same as ours.
Last Tuesday night, series-goers returned to
their cars to find them "literally slobbered with
football stickers," to use the words of a Stan
ford faculty member who brought the matter
to the attention of The Daily.
This faculty member states that a public news
paper would "not be able to publish the things
that I heard last night about the Stanford student
body and their utter disregard for private prop
erty."
It is posible you might not have realized the
inconvenience being caused these people. In
addition to the inconvenience and the resent- j
ment these stickers seem to have brought about, |
they would have done a lot more good had :
they been put on student cars around the j

dormitories and up the' Row.
And students would also appreciate having
the stickers placed in the lower right-hand cor
ner of the windshield rather than in the middle
of side and rear windows.
