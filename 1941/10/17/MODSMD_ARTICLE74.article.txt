# The 						Life Blood

### 
IT is an often-heard commentary that the pass
ing of years is made poignant by the passing
of friends. Youth is shocked by the death of a
contemporary, middle age is regretful, and old
age is resigned.
Stanford University celebrated its Fiftieth
Aniversary this yeai. /\s an institution, the
Farm is yet young and memories of the found
ers are still vivid and are still recalled by their
contemporaries. The University is in its youth
and is still shocked by the death of a contem
porary, particularly one who was as close and
as valued a friend as the late Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins.
Her connection with the University arid her
concern for it have been constant and loyal ever
since Senator and Mrs. Stanford decided to
convert a peninsula farm into this living memo
rial to their son. As Mrs. Timothy Hopkins,
wife of the adopted son of the fabulous Mark
Hopkins, she established a relationship with
the University which neither she nor her hus
band ever lost sight of.
And Stanford University will never have to
grope for evidence of this relationship. The
Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific Grove, the
Hopkins Medical Library in San Francisco, and
the Timothy Hopkins Room in the Stanford
Library are, however, only the tangible re
minders of a spirit far larger, far more signifi
cant to Stanford. For, such are the spirits which
manifest themselves in greatness.
As long as the University can claim loyalties
from such as Mary Kellogg Hopkins, it is justi
fied in the hope for a measure of greatness.â€”
