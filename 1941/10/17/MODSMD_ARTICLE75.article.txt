THE PROFESSORS TALK
knows that ping pong is one of the most
interesting of all indoor sports. There is grace and
speed and rhythm, and a co-ordination of the wrist
and eye. And besides it is a lot of fun, so the other
evening I went down to the Branner lobby to have a
couple of games. But there was some kind of a meet
ing going on and I couldn't play.
Around a table were Professor Buck, Professor
Bailey, and Professor Leighton, and sprawled in front
of them were a mob of smoking, heckling students. I
learned that the professors were giving their ideas
about Stanford women. It sounded interesting so I
listened.
« « « «
OPiOFESSOR LEIGHTON, being a member of the
chemistry department, looked at the Stanford
woman from the standpoint of her chemical compo
nents. And looked at from this point of view, he con
cluded that most girls were alike, that is, they all had
about the same amount of carbon, sulphur, nitrogen
and so forth. But add to these components two others,
lipstick and cigarettes, and you will have the Stanford
woman, according to the professor.
Professor Buck had some interesting views, but one
point of his, in particular, interested me. Mr. Buck
quite frankly stated that girls are able to get grades
because they can look so beautifully, so completely
helpless. They have the ability to make teachers give
them breaks, and this men students can never do. I
had always thought that girls were doing things like
that, but I guess they need every break they can get.
Professor Bailey tok a different approach to Stan
ford women. As he said. "I'm going to take the his
torical approach." And this the professor went on to
do by comparing the Stanford girl of today with the
Stanford girl of his time, as to looks and intelligence.

r professor first said that the women of his time
were not homelier than those of today, but that
they merely looked homelier. He cleared this seem
ingly contradictory statement by saying that the women
of his time did not spend time fixing themselves up,
and thus although really as pretty, they looked home
lier. And he gave good reasons for the lack of care.
One that the ratio during his time was 4 to 1, and also
that the girls were more interested in making Phi
Bete and lastly that Mills was three days away by
horse and buggy.
The professor went on to say that because women
of today have much more competition in the matter of
men, now that Dumbarton Bridge and the automo
bile have brought Mills girls dangerously close, they
have to spend more time working themselves over.
And because of this waste of time from study, they
have become dumber than the girl of the past. Not
that they aren't as smart as the girl of the past, but
that they don't get as good grades.
And so the professors jokingly rambled in this vein
to the delight of the men students. And all these
things I learned instead of hitting the little white ball.
But I still don't think I know any more about the
Stanford woman. I think I'll stick to my original
statement that girls are getting prettier and taller.
