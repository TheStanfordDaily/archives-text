# CAMPUS OPINION
## ODE TO STANFORD 
### 
r rilE EDITOR. SIR:
Three weeks or so ago, I arrived on campus with
hundreds of other freshmen and transfers (like my
self) for the first time. Since then I've been hearing
nothing but complaint from my green compatriots.
Maybe you've heard some of it too. Let me here and
now express myself as a true-blue booster for this
Stanford place before someone inadvertently puts me
on the gripe list, too:
I like Stanford's musty halls,
Her shaky profs, her chipping walls;
I like the dorms, the domes, the dopes,
The deans, the dames who know the ropes;
I like the Cellar—l'll never wail
'Bout muddy cofTee—Oh, so stale!
I like the team, the Stanford Rod,
The lumpy springs of my Branner bed;
1 like my studies, long and irksome,
And my sponsor, daft and quirksome;
I LIKE this place, I really do—
Watch me roll in '41!
Yours,
J. F. B.
