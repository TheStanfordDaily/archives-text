# 'Major Barbara' Administers Shavian Philosophy Painlessly
## 
### 
at (he Fox-Stanford Theater in
Palo Alto.
Seething with wit and humor,
George Bernard Shaw's "Major
Barbara" proves to be one of the
most biting satires on the fallacies
of man's thinking that the Irish play
wright has written. With a cast that
reads like a roll of honor of the
English theater, transcribed for the
screen by Shaw himself and di
rected by the man who gave us
"Pygmalion," Gabriel Pascal, this
film deserves to be ranked with the
few masterpieces of cinema history.
It is a parable, a parable of com
promise that in reality solves noth
ing. It tells the story of a modern
Joan of Arc in a Salvation Army
bonnet, whose faith is in the essen
tial goodness of the common people,
and who believes that salvation can
not be bought with the tainted dol
lars of the rich. But the ideal she
has built up is destroyed by her
shrewd, fabulously wealthy father,
md in its place he ofTers his creed:
he power of money is enough to
provide for any wants of the human
>oul. So Barbara, while she does not
•dmit defeat in the end, is forced to
itrike a happy medium: she will
dwell in the world that he has cre
•ited around his munitions factory
and preach salvation to men with
full bellies instead of poor starving
wretches who listen to her words
only to get a free meal.
PLAY SOLVES NOTHING
In other words, "Major Barbara"
solves nothing. We are left with
the uncomfortable feeling that Shaw
has been laughing up his sleeve at
)ur complete gullibility in believing
that perhaps the solution to the
problem has been found.
The film is packed full of Sha
vian philosophy, painlessly admin
stered through his characters, who
are in reality but the puppets of the
playwright. Wendy Hiller is su-
Jerb as Major Barbara; she plays
tier with fine and sensitive under
standing, with a freshness and vi
ality that lend credence to a role
that is most difficult to handle. Rex
Harrison is urbanely ironical and
charming as Adolphus Cousins, the
scholar who enters the Army for
the sake of Barbara.
But the outstanding piece of work
in the film is contributed by Robert
Newton as the sullen, defiant bully,
Bill Walker. He paints Bill with
all his faults, his shiftiness and his
meanness, and yet he shows us the
streak of integrity in his character
that makes us believe in his con
version. It is the acting of a master
ciaftsman, a man who thoroughly
understands every facet of the role
he is creating.
CAST IS EXCELLENT
Second only to Newton is Robert
Morley as Undershaft, the munitions
manufacturer, the supreme realist,
the complete egoist—a sort of com
bination of Ivar Kruger and Shaw
himself. Emlyn Williams is out
standing as a shifty, hypocritical
Cockney who lives in the Salvation
Army shelter, and the rest of the
cast, including Marie Lohr, Sybil
Thorndike, Penelope Dudley-Ward,
are excellent.
The only real criticism of the film
is that it is undeniably talky, but
if you like Show, who is a master
of dialogue, it won't bother you.
The Irish playwright addresses his
American audience in a prologue to
the film that must not be missed.
"I am sending you my old plays
as you are sending us your old bat
tleships," he states. If "Major Bar

bara" i.s a sample of his "old plays"
we believe that we are definitely
getting the benefit of the deal.
Try to miss the second feature,
something about '"Highways West,"
if we remember correctly. "Major
Barbara' is enough for any man's
money.—Livingston

ality that lend credence to a role
that is most difficult to handle. Rex
Harrison is urbanely ironical and
charming as Adolphus Cousins, the
scholar who enters the Army for
the sake of Barbara.
But the outstanding piece of work
in the film is contributed by Robert
Newton as the sullen, defiant bully,
Bill Walker. He paints Bill with
all his faults, his shiftiness and his
meanness, and yet he shows us the
streak of integrity in his character
that makes us believe in his con
version. It is the acting of a master
ciaftsman, a man who thoroughly
understands every facet of the role
he is creating.
CAST IS EXCELLENT
Second only to Newton is Robert
Morley as Undershaft, the munitions
manufacturer, the supreme realist,
the complete egoist—a sort of com
bination of Ivar Kruger and Shaw
himself. Emlyn Williams is out
standing as a shifty, hypocritical
Cockney who lives in the Salvation
Army shelter, and the rest of the
cast, including Marie Lohr, Sybil
Thorndike, Penelope Dudley-Ward,
are excellent.
The only real criticism of the film
is that it is undeniably talky, but
if you like Show, who is a master
of dialogue, it won't bother you.
The Irish playwright addresses his
American audience in a prologue to
the film that must not be missed.
"I am sending you my old plays
as you are sending us your old bat
tleships," he states. If "Major Bar

bara" i.s a sample of his "old plays"
we believe that we are definitely
getting the benefit of the deal.

something about '"Highways West,"

Barbara' is enough for any man's
money.—Livingston

Seething with wit and humor,
George Bernard Shaw's "Major
Barbara" proves to be one of the
most biting satires on the fallacies
of man's thinking that the Irish play
wright has written. With a cast that
reads like a roll of honor of the
English theater, transcribed for the
screen by Shaw himself and di
rected by the man who gave us
"Pygmalion," Gabriel Pascal, this
film deserves to be ranked with the
few masterpieces of cinema history.
It is a parable, a parable of com
promise that in reality solves noth
ing. It tells the story of a modern
Joan of Arc in a Salvation Army
bonnet, whose faith is in the essen
tial goodness of the common people,
and who believes that salvation can
not be bought with the tainted dol
lars of the rich. But the ideal she
has built up is destroyed by her
shrewd, fabulously wealthy father,
md in its place he ofTers his creed:
he power of money is enough to
provide for any wants of the human
>oul. So Barbara, while she does not
•dmit defeat in the end, is forced to
itrike a happy medium: she will
dwell in the world that he has cre
•ited around his munitions factory
and preach salvation to men with
full bellies instead of poor starving
wretches who listen to her words
only to get a free meal.
PLAY SOLVES NOTHING
In other words, "Major Barbara"
solves nothing. We are left with
the uncomfortable feeling that Shaw
has been laughing up his sleeve at
)ur complete gullibility in believing
that perhaps the solution to the
problem has been found.

of man's thinking that the Irish play
wright has written. With a cast that
reads like a roll of honor of the
English theater, transcribed for the
screen by Shaw himself and di
rected by the man who gave us
"Pygmalion," Gabriel Pascal, this
film deserves to be ranked with the
few masterpieces of cinema history.
It is a parable, a parable of com
promise that in reality solves noth
ing. It tells the story of a modern
Joan of Arc in a Salvation Army
bonnet, whose faith is in the essen
tial goodness of the common people,
and who believes that salvation can
not be bought with the tainted dol
lars of the rich. But the ideal she
has built up is destroyed by her
shrewd, fabulously wealthy father,
md in its place he ofTers his creed:
he power of money is enough to
provide for any wants of the human
>oul. So Barbara, while she does not
•dmit defeat in the end, is forced to
itrike a happy medium: she will
dwell in the world that he has cre
•ited around his munitions factory
and preach salvation to men with
full bellies instead of poor starving
wretches who listen to her words
only to get a free meal.
PLAY SOLVES NOTHING
In other words, "Major Barbara"
solves nothing. We are left with
the uncomfortable feeling that Shaw
has been laughing up his sleeve at
)ur complete gullibility in believing
that perhaps the solution to the
problem has been found.
The film is packed full of Sha
vian philosophy, painlessly admin
stered through his characters, who
are in reality but the puppets of the
playwright. Wendy Hiller is su-
Jerb as Major Barbara; she plays
tier with fine and sensitive under
standing, with a freshness and vi
ality that lend credence to a role
that is most difficult to handle. Rex
Harrison is urbanely ironical and
charming as Adolphus Cousins, the
scholar who enters the Army for
the sake of Barbara.
But the outstanding piece of work
in the film is contributed by Robert
Newton as the sullen, defiant bully,
Bill Walker. He paints Bill with
all his faults, his shiftiness and his
meanness, and yet he shows us the
streak of integrity in his character
that makes us believe in his con
version. It is the acting of a master
ciaftsman, a man who thoroughly
understands every facet of the role
he is creating.
CAST IS EXCELLENT
Second only to Newton is Robert
Morley as Undershaft, the munitions
manufacturer, the supreme realist,
the complete egoist—a sort of com
bination of Ivar Kruger and Shaw
himself. Emlyn Williams is out
standing as a shifty, hypocritical
Cockney who lives in the Salvation
Army shelter, and the rest of the
cast, including Marie Lohr, Sybil
Thorndike, Penelope Dudley-Ward,
are excellent.
The only real criticism of the film
is that it is undeniably talky, but
if you like Show, who is a master
of dialogue, it won't bother you.
The Irish playwright addresses his
American audience in a prologue to
the film that must not be missed.
"I am sending you my old plays
as you are sending us your old bat
tleships," he states. If "Major Bar

bara" i.s a sample of his "old plays"
we believe that we are definitely
getting the benefit of the deal.
Try to miss the second feature,
something about '"Highways West,"
if we remember correctly. "Major
Barbara' is enough for any man's
money.—Livingston
