# Frosh to Hold First Debate
## Freshmen to Discuss Unions Wednesday 
### 
Speaking for the first, time in a
formal debate as Stanford forensists,
eight members of the Class of '45
will discuss the problem of labor
unions next Wednesday evening at
7:15 in Memorial Plall.
The question is an outgrowth of
topics discussed at the squad's first
meeting at which the question was
stated, "Resolved: That the Federal
Government Should Regulate by
Law All Labor Unions." The main
purpose of the debate is to give
Freshman Coach George Peavey a
chance to see his prospects in
action.
Plans for the freshman team are
tentative, but Ed Conn, acting fresh
man manager, believes that debates
will be arranged with such schools
as Stockton J. C., Menlo Park, and
other surrounding schools for the
near future, as well as several radio
round-tables on different topics of
national interest.
Freshmen. interested in debating
work are asked to report to the
meeting Wednesday, or to contact
Coach Peavey.
