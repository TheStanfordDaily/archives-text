# S.F. Symphony Offers Rates
## Special Sections Saved for Stanford 
### 
For the first time the San Fran
cisco Symphony Association is of
fering season tickets at special rates
to Stanford. Blocks of seats in the
grand tier and orchestra sections of
the War Memorial Opera House are
being set aside especially for Farm
students.
Tickets for the season's concerts,
which begin in December, are avail
able this week and next for $9.90
(tax included) in contrast to the
regular prce of $16.50. Buying
tickets this early will guarantee the
saving of the best seats in these sec
tions for Stanford.
Plans are now being made by the
Symphony Association working
with a student committee to con
duct a series of informal musical
talks on campus during the season
at which symphony artists will ap
pear.
A clearing house i.s to be estab
lished in the A.S.S.U. office so that
students who hold season tickets
and do not care to use them for a
particular symphony may sell their
seats.
Tickets may be purchased now
through the following students:
Dick Lyon, Zete; Pi Thornton, Dee-
Gee; Brandy Bassett and Dave Jess
burg, Delts; Aniie Reichert, Lagu
nita; Ted Cole, El Toro; Mary
