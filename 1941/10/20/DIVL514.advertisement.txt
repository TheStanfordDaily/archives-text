THE ROOS WAGON COAT
To say you college fellows will like this
Wagon Coat is putting it mildly! It's the
kind of a coat you'll wear to an 8:00 o'clock
... to loaf around ... to live in. It's loose
and comfortable. It's good looking . . . tan
cotton gabardine, hand-whipped edges.
Everything about the Roos _
Wagon Coat (including the $7.95
7.95) is right for campus life. ■
