### AMIE REICHERT 
YESTERDAY Herbert Hoover
raised once again the issue that
is nearest and dearest to his heart:
food for the starving peoples of
German-occupied Europe. He de
credie the state department's dis
missal with a "curt letter" of his ap
peals to find a way to feed 40,000,000
children facing tsarvation this win
ter.
Mr. Hoover is a sincere and de
voted humanitarian. The issue he
raises is to his mind a clear-cut
one of right and wrong. He is look
ing at the situation humanely and
from a completely moral stand
point.
But in a world where might makes
right, where force rides roughshod
over reason, Mr. Hoover's ideals are
a pathetic anachronism.

OPPOSING as frankly humani
itarian a proposal as Mr. Hoo
ver's is a dangerous and decidedly
unpopular policy. But those who do
not share his enthusiasm in this
matter are not necessarily all wife
beaters and baby-killers.
Mr. Hoover's opponents recognize
and command and agree with his
humanitarianism, but they cannot
accept its political and economic im
plications.
This is war. We are at war. (Al
though perhaps Mr. Hoover would
not admit it.) This is not a case
of right and wrong, good or bad.
This is not moral issue but a po
litical one. And it is on these
grounds that Mr. Hoover's position
is open to attack.
Mr. Hoover argues, and with a
considerable degree of truth, that
Hitler "cannot be defeated with
armies of starving children." There
fore he eanot see how we will be
jeopardizing in any way the posi
tion of our Allies in this war if we
send food into the occupied coun
tries.

,JUT there is a larger, more prac
tical aspect of this problem that
cannot be overlooked though it is
somewhat distasteful, and that is the
question of morale.
Mr. Hoover docs not need to be
reminded that wars arc not only
fought on the battle front with
guns and planes and tanks. He
knows as well as his critics that
hunger incites revolt, that the
starvation of the German people in
1!M8 was one of the primary factors
in their overthrow of the Kaiser.
He knows also that any attempt to
send food to Europe today would
have to be negotiated with Adolf
Hitler, the conqueror of the conti
nent. And he must know that any
pledge, any promise made by der
Fuehrer is just so much vocal ex
ercise.
What guarantee will there be
that the Naiz storm tropcrs will
not seize the food and supplies
sent to the occupied countries for
themselves or for their people?
Obviously there can be none, there
is none that can he depended
upon.
And even if Mr. Hoover were to
negotiate a satisfactory arrange
ment of some sort whereby the food
would be doled out only to the starv
ing population, it cannot be denied
that there is a tremendous psycho
logical and practical advantage for
the Allies in the starvation of the
continent. Any realistic man can
not fail to see this.

IT IS a terrible commentary on
modern warfare that children
must be starved and civilians must
die of malnutrition in order to be
Victorious. "But it must be so.
This is not our war; it is Ilerr
Hitler's. We arc not making the
rules; he has already showed us
by his example waht our coarse of
action must lie.
Starving Europe is not a cold
blooded reprisal inflicted upon the
inocent for revenge. It is sound,
hard-headed strategy, though it is
heartless.
In war there can be no compro
mises, no half-way measures. The
starvation and smouldering hatred
of Europe is a powerful and terrible
weapon which we must use against
the Nazis. Mr. Hoover's philanthro
py is a luxury we cannot afford.
At least not right now.
