# More Nations Than Britain Deserve Food, Hoover Says
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
American opinion that the United !
States should accept British rejection j
of the Hoover plan to feed Europe's
starving children is ungrounded, |
according to ex-President Herbert 1
Hoover who addressed a nation- i
wide radio audience from New York !
yesterday afternoon.
"The feeding of Europe is not :
solely a British concern," Hoover
said. "Have not the women and i
children of democracies other than
Great Britain a right to live? Is the 1
Allied cause advanced by the death
and hunger of European children?" ,
Hoover asked.
Already the British have opened
the blockade to feed captive British
soldiers in Germany with food that
they trust the Germans to distrib
ute, according to Hoover. Also ship
ments destined for Greece are al
lowed to go through Turkey past
the blockade.
"If it is practical to feed captive
British soldiers," Hoover asked, "is
it not practical to feed captive
wocen and children? '
GIVES NO ADVANTAGE
The methods which he proposes
can give no possible military ad
vantage to either side of the war
ring nations, Hoover claimed.
"I have proposed that the Ameri
can government lake the initiative
in enlisting the help of neutral na
tions to negotiate wilh the belliger
ents," Hoover said. "As a basis of
such negotiations I proposed that
the Germans, having a surplus of
breadstuffs, should supply from
their own stocks what breadstuffs
were needed to save these children.
I suggested that only the fats and
special food for children which due
to (he blockade are deficient all over
Europe should be imported over
seas."
The fact that Germany would be
supplying the bread is sufficient rea
son to prevent Nazi agents from
seizing this food, according to Hoo
ver.

"It is said that the Germans would
seize fats for explosives, but scien
tists assure us that this transforma
tion is not possible," Hoover as
serted.
Hoover is confident that the Ger
man people do not want children in
Nazi occupied territory to go hun
gry. He also stated that he knows
many British people who want his
plan to work. Appeals from the
people of the small democracies are
still coming to him although the
governments of these nations now
Teel bound to adhere to the decisions
; of the Western powers.
"We are contributing to the block
ade of small democracies when we
have a moral responsibility to help
them. Promises for food after the
conclusion of the war only make
these starving people bitter. Food
for the dead has little value, * Hoo
ver said.
The American government must
put the plan of the National Com
mittee on Food for Small Democra
cies into the hands of a neutral
government, Hoover claimed. He
named Switzerland, Sweden, Argen
tina and Ireland as possibilities for
executors of his proposal.
WE WILL GET CREDIT
"If Germany refuses to accept the
plan, then we will get the credit for
trying to aid the small democracies
and there will be no hatred of Amer
ica after the war," Hoover said. "If
the Germans accept the plan and
violate its rules, all stocks of im
ported food will be cut off immc
| diately.
Stressing the need for aid to occu
pied territory, Hoover said that a
shortage of meats, fats, and milk in
Belgium is crucifying the Belgian
children. An appalling stop in
growth and rise of disease is imper
iling the health of several genera
tions, he asserted.
"The death rate in Poland has in
creased 15 times in the last year,"
Hoover stated. "The death rate
among children is now ten times as
large as the birthrate."
Appeals to find a way to feed
40,000,000 children facing starvation
this winter in occupied Europe were
dismissed by the State Department
with a "curt letter," Hoover charged.
PLAN OUTLINED
An outline summary of Hoover's
plan for feeding Europe's small de
mocracies is printed below:
1. Supervision of food distribu
tion will be placed in the hands
of one of the remaining neutral
governments, e.g., Switzerland,
Sweden, Argentina, or Ireland.
2. Germany is to provide bread
stuffs; fats and other foods which
Europe larks will come from the
Western Hemisphere.
The nations receiving the food
will pay for it.
4. Food will he stored in ware
houses under neutral control;
failure of a shipment to arrive on
schedule is to he reported imme
diately to the neutral commission.
5. Warehouses will distribute
the food to soup kitchens within
the occupied nations; failure of
food to arrive here on time must
also be reported to the neutral
commission.
(i. Food tickets issued only to
citizens of the occupied nations
must be presented in order to ob
tain food which must he eaten on
the spot.
7. Reports of failure of supplies
to arrive on schedule will be fol
lowed immediately by a neutral
commission investigation; German
seizure of goods will automatically
stop further shipments.

British soldiers," Hoover asked, "is
it not practical to feed captive
wocen and children? '
GIVES NO ADVANTAGE
The methods which he proposes
can give no possible military ad
vantage to either side of the war
ring nations, Hoover claimed.
"I have proposed that the Ameri
can government lake the initiative
in enlisting the help of neutral na
tions to negotiate wilh the belliger
ents," Hoover said. "As a basis of
such negotiations I proposed that
the Germans, having a surplus of
breadstuffs, should supply from
their own stocks what breadstuffs
were needed to save these children.
I suggested that only the fats and
special food for children which due
to (he blockade are deficient all over
Europe should be imported over
seas."
The fact that Germany would be
supplying the bread is sufficient rea
son to prevent Nazi agents from
seizing this food, according to Hoo
ver.

"It is said that the Germans would
seize fats for explosives, but scien
tists assure us that this transforma
tion is not possible," Hoover as
serted.
Hoover is confident that the Ger
man people do not want children in
Nazi occupied territory to go hun
gry. He also stated that he knows
many British people who want his
plan to work. Appeals from the
people of the small democracies are
still coming to him although the
governments of these nations now
Teel bound to adhere to the decisions
; of the Western powers.
"We are contributing to the block
ade of small democracies when we
have a moral responsibility to help
them. Promises for food after the
conclusion of the war only make
these starving people bitter. Food
for the dead has little value, * Hoo
ver said.
The American government must
put the plan of the National Com
mittee on Food for Small Democra
cies into the hands of a neutral
government, Hoover claimed. He
named Switzerland, Sweden, Argen
tina and Ireland as possibilities for
executors of his proposal.
WE WILL GET CREDIT
"If Germany refuses to accept the
plan, then we will get the credit for
trying to aid the small democracies
and there will be no hatred of Amer
ica after the war," Hoover said. "If
the Germans accept the plan and
violate its rules, all stocks of im
ported food will be cut off immc
| diately.
Stressing the need for aid to occu
pied territory, Hoover said that a
shortage of meats, fats, and milk in
Belgium is crucifying the Belgian
children. An appalling stop in
growth and rise of disease is imper
iling the health of several genera
tions, he asserted.
"The death rate in Poland has in
creased 15 times in the last year,"
Hoover stated. "The death rate
among children is now ten times as
large as the birthrate."
Appeals to find a way to feed
40,000,000 children facing starvation
this winter in occupied Europe were
dismissed by the State Department
with a "curt letter," Hoover charged.
PLAN OUTLINED
An outline summary of Hoover's
plan for feeding Europe's small de
mocracies is printed below:
1. Supervision of food distribu
tion will be placed in the hands
of one of the remaining neutral
governments, e.g., Switzerland,
Sweden, Argentina, or Ireland.
2. Germany is to provide bread
stuffs; fats and other foods which
Europe larks will come from the
Western Hemisphere.
The nations receiving the food
will pay for it.
4. Food will he stored in ware
houses under neutral control;
failure of a shipment to arrive on
schedule is to he reported imme
diately to the neutral commission.
5. Warehouses will distribute
the food to soup kitchens within
the occupied nations; failure of
food to arrive here on time must
also be reported to the neutral
commission.
(i. Food tickets issued only to
citizens of the occupied nations
must be presented in order to ob
tain food which must he eaten on
the spot.
7. Reports of failure of supplies
to arrive on schedule will be fol
lowed immediately by a neutral
commission investigation; German
seizure of goods will automatically
stop further shipments.

American opinion that the United !

Hoover asked.

the blockade to feed captive British
soldiers in Germany with food that
they trust the Germans to distrib
ute, according to Hoover. Also ship

"It is said that the Germans would
seize fats for explosives, but scien
tists assure us that this transforma
tion is not possible," Hoover as
serted.
Hoover is confident that the Ger
man people do not want children in
Nazi occupied territory to go hun
gry. He also stated that he knows
many British people who want his
plan to work. Appeals from the
people of the small democracies are
still coming to him although the
governments of these nations now
Teel bound to adhere to the decisions
; of the Western powers.
"We are contributing to the block
ade of small democracies when we
have a moral responsibility to help
them. Promises for food after the
conclusion of the war only make
these starving people bitter. Food
for the dead has little value, * Hoo
ver said.
The American government must
put the plan of the National Com
mittee on Food for Small Democra
cies into the hands of a neutral
government, Hoover claimed. He
named Switzerland, Sweden, Argen
tina and Ireland as possibilities for
executors of his proposal.
WE WILL GET CREDIT
"If Germany refuses to accept the
plan, then we will get the credit for
trying to aid the small democracies
and there will be no hatred of Amer
ica after the war," Hoover said. "If
the Germans accept the plan and
violate its rules, all stocks of im
ported food will be cut off immc
| diately.
Stressing the need for aid to occu
pied territory, Hoover said that a
shortage of meats, fats, and milk in
Belgium is crucifying the Belgian
children. An appalling stop in
growth and rise of disease is imper
iling the health of several genera
tions, he asserted.
"The death rate in Poland has in
creased 15 times in the last year,"
Hoover stated. "The death rate
among children is now ten times as
large as the birthrate."
Appeals to find a way to feed
40,000,000 children facing starvation
this winter in occupied Europe were
dismissed by the State Department
with a "curt letter," Hoover charged.
PLAN OUTLINED
An outline summary of Hoover's
plan for feeding Europe's small de
mocracies is printed below:
1. Supervision of food distribu
tion will be placed in the hands
of one of the remaining neutral
governments, e.g., Switzerland,
Sweden, Argentina, or Ireland.
2. Germany is to provide bread
stuffs; fats and other foods which
Europe larks will come from the
Western Hemisphere.
The nations receiving the food
will pay for it.
4. Food will he stored in ware
houses under neutral control;
failure of a shipment to arrive on
schedule is to he reported imme
diately to the neutral commission.
5. Warehouses will distribute
the food to soup kitchens within
the occupied nations; failure of
food to arrive here on time must
also be reported to the neutral
commission.
(i. Food tickets issued only to
citizens of the occupied nations
must be presented in order to ob
tain food which must he eaten on
the spot.
7. Reports of failure of supplies
to arrive on schedule will be fol
lowed immediately by a neutral
commission investigation; German
seizure of goods will automatically
stop further shipments.

American opinion that the United !
States should accept British rejection j
of the Hoover plan to feed Europe's
starving children is ungrounded, |
according to ex-President Herbert 1
Hoover who addressed a nation- i
wide radio audience from New York !
yesterday afternoon.
"The feeding of Europe is not :
solely a British concern," Hoover
said. "Have not the women and i
children of democracies other than
Great Britain a right to live? Is the 1
Allied cause advanced by the death
and hunger of European children?" ,
Hoover asked.
Already the British have opened
the blockade to feed captive British
soldiers in Germany with food that
they trust the Germans to distrib
ute, according to Hoover. Also ship
ments destined for Greece are al
lowed to go through Turkey past
the blockade.
"If it is practical to feed captive
British soldiers," Hoover asked, "is
it not practical to feed captive
wocen and children? '
GIVES NO ADVANTAGE
The methods which he proposes
can give no possible military ad
vantage to either side of the war
ring nations, Hoover claimed.
"I have proposed that the Ameri
can government lake the initiative
in enlisting the help of neutral na
tions to negotiate wilh the belliger
ents," Hoover said. "As a basis of
such negotiations I proposed that
the Germans, having a surplus of
breadstuffs, should supply from
their own stocks what breadstuffs
were needed to save these children.
I suggested that only the fats and
special food for children which due
to (he blockade are deficient all over
Europe should be imported over
seas."
The fact that Germany would be
supplying the bread is sufficient rea
son to prevent Nazi agents from
seizing this food, according to Hoo
ver.

"It is said that the Germans would
seize fats for explosives, but scien
tists assure us that this transforma
