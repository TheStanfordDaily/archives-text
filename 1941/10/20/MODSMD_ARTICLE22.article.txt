# Stanford Red Machine Rolls Over U.S.F. 42-26 In Wide Open Grid Tilt
## Cards Collect 25 First Downs In Power Show 
### HAP EVERETT 
Shaughnessy's legions marched up
and down the Stadium greensward
Saturday for 2.Â» first downs, .'>oo odd
yards, and 12 points. However, our
Indians forgot to lower the gate on
defense and an inspired San Fran
cisco team ran up the surprising total
of 2fi points, largest score ever reg
istered against a Shaughnessy-Stan
ford combination.
The offense-minded Indiana ap
peared to be looking the other way
on several occasions and if Vic Ra
mus can do what he did to Stanford
think what havoc will be wrought
when Ernie Steele starts to roll this
week-end.
SCREEN PLAYS WORK
The ability of the Dons to get out
into the open has been attributed to
clever screen plays rigged up by
JefT Cravath; but sloppy defensive
work on the part of Stanford re
serves is a more logical reason. Buck
Fawcett looked like Tony Firpo on
pass defense and Bull Durham, play
ing safety, must have been counting
the attendance on one of those Don
touchdowns.
The entire Stanford secondary
throughout a great part of the game
was eilher asleep at the owitch or
tackling like a bunch of dancing
teachers. Fortunately the same may
be said for the Dons.
Stanford seems to be going all-out
for offense, a trend that has proved
popular with the fans but obviously
neglects a vital department of foot
ball.
STACKPOOL LAID UP
Undoubtedly some emphasis will
be placed on defense this week for,
despite the fact that Stackpool was
hurt up at Seattle this week-end,
Washington is going to be plenty
powerful, at least more so than the
lowly Dons. Harry Shipkey saw the
Bruin game Saturday and will have
some dope for the coaching staff to
work with in the next four days.
With a well-established set of of
fensive weapons, the Stanford prob
lem now is to construct a defense for
the mighty Huskies. Phelan. has a
backfield studded with veterans like
Steele and Stackpool, and a flock of
brilliant sophs, Bobby Erickson, Neil
Brooks, and Bob Barrett. Washing
ton is pretty well stocked with ends
too. Earl Younglove and Fred Olson
start but sophomore A1 Sloan has
been the most sensational pass
catcher in the Northwest tliis year.
In short, the Huskies are going to
be hard to stop, especially in their
own lair. If it rains in Seattle this
week-end Stanford's offense may be
stalled as it was in Corvallis. In that
case, it would be a good thing if
the Indians were equipped to hold
Washington. They won't do it if they
play the brand of ball they played
against U.S.F.
NO TEA PARTY
The Don game was no tea party for
either side. Don Lyon, U.S.F. tackle,
was sent to the hospital with a pel
vis fracture and Stanford men were
laid out right and left. Frankie
Forbes was helped off the field with
a knee injury, Ray Hammett was
kicked in the leg, Durham and Vu
cinich were both kicked in the head,
and Loren LaPrade required three
stitches in his hand. Already on the
sidelines for the Indians are Pete
Kmetovic, Amie Meiners, Jack
Barkley, and Hank Norberg.
The awful details of Saturday's
I game serve to show the offensive
\ strength and defensive weakness of
j Stanford.
In the first thfee minutes, Vuci
' nieh, Sheller. and Armstrong drove
! 74 yards in ten plays to score. Be
j fore the first quarter was over, Shel
ler pounded over the last yard for
(he seoond score. The second team
staged their own drive, Sheller again
going over to make it 21-0.
Crunch Crane led a fourth drive
| to a touchdown, Hammett scoring on 1
a quarterback sneak. The Dons I
then went right through Stanford I
for 70 yards in four plays. Two !
minutes later, Vic Ramus went j
through the whole Stanford team i
! for 64 yards and a touchdown.
Then Albert tossed one to Sheller |
in the end zone. Score 35-13. Fran
ceschi then slid through for 74
yards. Then the Indians came back
with a 70-yard drive. Finally Ky
noch caught a pass from Johnston
in the end zone and the game ended
J with Tyler Norton trying a drop- j
| kick for the Indians from 20 yards
j out. A marvelous track meet.
