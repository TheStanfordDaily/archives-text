# 'Power to Tax Is Power To Destroy'
## 
### 
Enlivening the autumn colors of
the trees along ihe Row is the
"Bomber," a sprightly, face-lifted
Model A, originally of the year 15)29.
Not merely painted, it is camou
flaged, in a pastel A.T.O. creation.
But the Bomber's existence is
jeopardized. Is it worth five dollars?
It will either pay a five-dollar tax
or Officer Gordy Davis will get it.
"Students have thought,' Davis
said, "that as long as they didn't
drive—or push—their cars anywhere
off campus, they were all right.
However, this registration applies to
the campus as well, and a general
roundup of the old models will be
gin if the new tax is not paid by the
first of the year."
OL1) OWNERS GONE
Bringing registrations up to date,
which is also required by law, will
involve complications. For, as Offi
cer Davis remarked, some of the old
Fords are registered to owners who
graduated years ago and the cars
have changed hands several times
since, with no registration made at
the change of ownership. Techni
cally they are violating the state
law and are liable to be picked up
and impounded.
What Davis is afraid of is that
instead of paying the tax, the capi
talists who own these limousines will
be tempted to abandon them, since
five dollars is five dollars these days.
TRADITION DIES
Already there are indications that
the old Stanford traditions is dying
out. The popular Bubbles, which
was parked at Roble last year, is un
fortunately no more. Apparently the
girls of '45 are uninterested in the
stallable type of automobile.
Encitiamen, on the other hand,
never lose such interest. This year
I hey have a model which would pass
for a French taxi of pre-World War
I days. Its collapsible top allegedly
still works.
Parked in the familiar place close
to the Union is the long, compli
cated maroon touring car, which is,
as usual, sported by the Alpha Delts.
HOOT'S CAR
But the car that has had the most
notoriety (Ihe whole front page of
the green sheet having been given
over to it) is the checker-top jalopy
seen usually breathing hard after
carrying its load of football players
to practice. Hoot's car is still here.
How much longer will we be see
ing these trademarks of the Stanford
campus?

How much longer will we be see
ing these trademarks of the Stanford
campus?
Enlivening the autumn colors of
the trees along ihe Row is the
"Bomber," a sprightly, face-lifted
Model A, originally of the year 15)29.
Not merely painted, it is camou
flaged, in a pastel A.T.O. creation.
But the Bomber's existence is
jeopardized. Is it worth five dollars?
It will either pay a five-dollar tax
or Officer Gordy Davis will get it.
"Students have thought,' Davis
said, "that as long as they didn't
drive—or push—their cars anywhere
off campus, they were all right.
However, this registration applies to
the campus as well, and a general
roundup of the old models will be
gin if the new tax is not paid by the
first of the year."
OL1) OWNERS GONE
Bringing registrations up to date,
which is also required by law, will
involve complications. For, as Offi
cer Davis remarked, some of the old
Fords are registered to owners who
graduated years ago and the cars
have changed hands several times
since, with no registration made at
the change of ownership. Techni
cally they are violating the state
law and are liable to be picked up
and impounded.
What Davis is afraid of is that
instead of paying the tax, the capi
talists who own these limousines will
be tempted to abandon them, since
five dollars is five dollars these days.
TRADITION DIES
Already there are indications that
the old Stanford traditions is dying
out. The popular Bubbles, which
was parked at Roble last year, is un
fortunately no more. Apparently the
girls of '45 are uninterested in the
stallable type of automobile.
Encitiamen, on the other hand,
never lose such interest. This year
I hey have a model which would pass
for a French taxi of pre-World War
I days. Its collapsible top allegedly
still works.
Parked in the familiar place close
to the Union is the long, compli
cated maroon touring car, which is,
as usual, sported by the Alpha Delts.
HOOT'S CAR
But the car that has had the most
notoriety (Ihe whole front page of
the green sheet having been given
over to it) is the checker-top jalopy
seen usually breathing hard after
carrying its load of football players
to practice. Hoot's car is still here.
