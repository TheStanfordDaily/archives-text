### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 19 (UP).
â€” Representatives of Pacific Coast
shipping companies will confer to
morrow with Rear Admiral John W.
Greenslade, commandant of the 12th
Naval District, to draw up a plan
for transfer of naval reservists from
merchant vessels to active navy
duty, it was announced today.
It was emphasized that the Navy
did not plan a wholesale call for
reserve officers presently, but hoped
to work out a schedule whereby
reservists could not be taken when
necessary from the merchant marine
without seriously affecting efficiency
of merchant shipping.
