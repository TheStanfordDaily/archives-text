Coach Norton Thornton's hopes for a conference championship this
/year were given a rude jo!t here Friday afternoon when an inspired
U.C.L.A. water polo team upset his Indian mermen. 10 to (5.
"There isn't much to say about it," commented Coach Thornton after
the game. "They just had it today and we didn't."

, Most encouraging aspect of the
game was the discovery of Grant
Cullqy, sophomore forward. Enter
ing at half time with Stanford be
hind. 8 to 2, Culley ran wild to score
four points in six attempts and lead
a fighting, but unsuccessful, come
back attempt. Playing with the re

seven points to almost single-hand
edly lead his teammates to a 9 to 6
victory over San Jose State.
CULLEY I'LAYS BEST
Culley was the only Indian swim
mer to be "hot," although everyone
fought hard throughout the contest.
Captain Frank Mitchell accumulated
eight fouls in trying to stop the
Bruins' potent scorers, Bill Mitchell
and Johnny Segal.
Mtichell and Segal, all-conference
forwards, lived up to advance notices
by scoring 5 and 3 points, respec
tively. Mitchell, in particular, ran
wild through most of the game.
Not many excuses could be given
for Stanford in the first half. Coach
Don Parks' Bruins were ahead, 2
to 1, at the end of the first quarter,
and then forged in front, 8 to 2, at
halftime.
UCLAN DEFENSE STRONG
The second half saw a fighting
Cardinal team try everything in a
frenzied attempt to even the score
but they just couldn't pierce the
tight U.C.L.A. defense.
Stanford's starting line-up con
sisted of Hadley Bacon and Fred
Manwaring, forwards; Bill Mapel,
sprint; Bob Jones, center back; Frank
Mitchell and Jack Bleecker, guards;
and Pete Lee, goalie.
