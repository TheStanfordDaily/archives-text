# British Sailors Trim Varsity Soccer Teams
## 
### 
A team of 11 sailors from the
British cruisers Orion and Liver
pool came down to the Farm Sat
urday morning and eased to a 1-0
win over Stanford's varsity soccer
team.
Although the British had not
trained and had no substitutes to
use, they played a much superior
game to the Indians, who had dif
ficulty holding the score at what it
was. The local players described
them as the best group of sports
they had ever played.
BRITISHER SCORES
Center-forward Adams of the vis
itors scored the game's only goal.
Co-captain Jack Burns and his sub
stitute Frank Card as goalies played
a remarkable defensive game keeping
the Britishers to only one goal.
Ollie Hamlin, Card left fullback,
and Ed Johnson, the other co-cap
tain fit center halfback, also played
well for the Farm team. Other men
on the Stanford starting line-up were
Fernandh, Carney, Sol, Gunterman,
Wool, Vose, Chapot, and Peters.
LUNCII AT UNION
After the game the host team took
the 11 Britishers and the two petty
officers which accompanied them to
the Union for lunch and from there
to the American football game in
the afternoon.
Their reactions to the first football
game they had seen were that it
looked pretty rough and that they
had considerable trouble following
the ball in the T formation. They
watched the man in motion until it
was too late.
FROSH WIN
The frosh soccer men defeated
Lowell High School, 2 to 0, in a
game played on Saturday morning
also.
