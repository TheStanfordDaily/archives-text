# Biz School Beats Delta Chi
## 
### 
Passes that didn't connect and a
Business School team that proved
the it's-never-too-late adage com
bined to upset a favored Delta Chi
squad 6 to 0 in the highlight of in
tramural grid games Friday.
On the last play of the game. Busi
ness School's Bill Tweedie shot a 7-
yard pass to John Farley for the
score. The losers threatened sev
eral times but incomplete passes
ended the hopes. Victory pushed the
medicos into a tie with Zeta Psi for
first place in League 5.
The Zete outfit had little trouble
in outpassing Kappa Alpha 20 to 6.
Frank McCann passed to Jack Dana,
Dick Northon, and Sandy Tatum for
the three goals, Hanlon booted one
extra, and a pass brought the other.
Kappa Alpha's score came on a pass
to Dick Ray.
SIGMA NU WINS
George Atherton ran back a pass
interception for 50 yards to bring
victory to his Sigma Nu teammates
over a strong Phi Psi I squad, 6
to 0. The Nus assumed the lead in
League 8 as the result of the win.
El Toro popped into the lead in
League 2 with a 7 to 6 victory on a
break from Medical School I. The
Toros scored on a pass from Bob
Montgomery to Bob Morton, Mont
gomery passing for the winning con
version. George Torassa passed to
George Egenolf for the Med School
score, but a penalty nullified the
conversion and gave the game to
Toro.
Medical School II had a Lyon
passing act, T. Lyon to D. Lyon,
that was 12 points too much for
S.A.E. The passes, one for 7 and
one for 15, gave the winners a 50-50
split in games played and another
crack at league honors.
