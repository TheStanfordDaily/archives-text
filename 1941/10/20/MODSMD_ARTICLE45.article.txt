### DON SELBY 
JUST as everybody said they would
do, Stanford's football team lar
ruped the University of San Fran
cisco Saturday.
And. just as Bull Sessioner Ches 1
Saroyan predicted, Stanford regained
little of its "lost prestige," despite
the basketball score the Indians ran
up on the Dons.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy was far
from satisfied with the showing of
his ball club, and the l-esult is likely
to be a tough practice week for
the boys, although the trip to Se
attle, which starts Wednesday, will
cut down the length of the work
outs.
Any time that a team with as in
effectual an attack as the Dons
showed can score 26 points on a team
that is one of the leading contend
ers for the conference title, some
thing's amiss. The Indians knew
that there wasn't a chance that '
they'd lose the game, after they
had moved through the San Fran
ciscans so easily. The mental atti
tude was not up to snuff, but it
didn't matter much in the final ac
counting.
However, if any defense laxes,
such as those that occurred in Sat
urday's runaway, crop up against
teams like Stanford's next two op
ponents, the U. of W. and Santa
Clara, the results can be expected to
be on the disastrous side.

QLD LUCKIE LOUIE had a per
fect waek-end, although we
must admit that he picked some
pretty sure things. The results he
predicted make the standings look
like this:
Won Lost
Oregon 2 1
Oregon State 2 1
Stanford 2 1
U.S.C 2 1
Washington 2 1
U.C.L.A 2 2
W.S.C 1 3
California 0 2
Idaho 0 1
Montana 0 1
