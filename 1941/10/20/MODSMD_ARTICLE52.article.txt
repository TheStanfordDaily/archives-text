# The 						Rainâ€”It's Here

### 
ONCE again Stanford enters that annual sea
son of puddles and parkas and boots and
bandanas. Convertible tops go up for good and
letters will soon be flowing into Campus Opin.
bemoaning the lack of parking around the libe,
the feudal snobbery of some of our wheeled
pedestriain-splashers and the moats without
drawbridges at every corner.
Somebody should write a song "Stanford in
the Rain," with apologies to the authors of "Stan
ford in Spring." They could throw in a couplet
on the need for white lines down the centers
of our roads. Maybe a verse on reflector type
"Stop" signs where now there are none. And
the olfactory sensation of a classroom full of
damp clothes. They might touch upon the
sometimes inefficient drainage facilities. But
these aren't very poetical.
When drops fall on Lagunita,
And it's damp along the Quad,
When the rain sings a song
As you slush along,
That's Stanford in the Rain.
You can do better than this. Address all con
tributions to the editor.
