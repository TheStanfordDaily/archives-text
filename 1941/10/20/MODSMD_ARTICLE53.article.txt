ONE of the functions of the press—and that
includes college newspapers—is to keep
the public aware of the actions of its representa
tives.
Constructive criticism can often bring con
structive action. This point has been proved
most recently by our "rival" across the Bay,
the Daily Californian.
One of the organs of the Berkeley Associated
Students is known as Welfare Council, whose
purpose is to "make investigations and recom
mendations to the Executive Committee and to
act upon such matters as concern the welfare of
the association."
The Daily Cal felt that this Welfare Council
v/as not functioning as it should, was not deal
ing with problems truly of concern to a majority
of the students or of the association in general.
They publicized the fact in their editorial col
umns. They said that the problem of inter-cam
pus raids was one which concerned "the wel
fare of the association," as it most certainly
does.

Though their interest in possible cancellation
of games because of raiding and vandalism by
students was mainly financial—necessary funds
from gate receipts might be cut —they were
right in feeling that the problem is a serious one,
and one to be dealt with by students.
Through the paper the matter came to the at
tention of President Sproul who criticized the
council for ignoring problems within its sphere
and called for "immediate consideration" of
inter-campus raids, rooting section conduct and
other problems.
At the same time, aid from the Berkeley cam
pus in eliminating the useless form of "college
spirit" which entails "invasions" and other high
school pranks came from another source.
The chairman of the Big "C" Guards called
for sportsmanlike conduct from the Cal students
in line with our decision to discourage —more
than that, to abandon—raiding.
We hope the Berkeley students will heed Dr.
Sproul's call for action.
With help like this there will be no need dur
ing that last week in November for shaved
heads, mass riots, somber Men's Council meet
ings, expulsion of your fellow-students.

most recently by our "rival" across the Bay,
the Daily Californian.
One of the organs of the Berkeley Associated
Students is known as Welfare Council, whose
purpose is to "make investigations and recom
mendations to the Executive Committee and to
act upon such matters as concern the welfare of
the association."
The Daily Cal felt that this Welfare Council
v/as not functioning as it should, was not deal
ing with problems truly of concern to a majority
of the students or of the association in general.
They publicized the fact in their editorial col
umns. They said that the problem of inter-cam
pus raids was one which concerned "the wel
fare of the association," as it most certainly
does.

Though their interest in possible cancellation
of games because of raiding and vandalism by
students was mainly financial—necessary funds
from gate receipts might be cut —they were
right in feeling that the problem is a serious one,
and one to be dealt with by students.
Through the paper the matter came to the at
tention of President Sproul who criticized the
council for ignoring problems within its sphere
and called for "immediate consideration" of
inter-campus raids, rooting section conduct and
other problems.
At the same time, aid from the Berkeley cam
pus in eliminating the useless form of "college
spirit" which entails "invasions" and other high
school pranks came from another source.
The chairman of the Big "C" Guards called
for sportsmanlike conduct from the Cal students
in line with our decision to discourage —more
than that, to abandon—raiding.
We hope the Berkeley students will heed Dr.
Sproul's call for action.
With help like this there will be no need dur
ing that last week in November for shaved
heads, mass riots, somber Men's Council meet
ings, expulsion of your fellow-students.
ONE of the functions of the press—and that
includes college newspapers—is to keep
the public aware of the actions of its representa
tives.
Constructive criticism can often bring con
structive action. This point has been proved
most recently by our "rival" across the Bay,
the Daily Californian.
