# Winter Whirl
## 
### 
FQR the past several years there have been
many complaints that fall and spring quar
ters were crammed too lull of student activities.

Winter quarter was always so dead, they said.
Let's give more activities to winter quarter.
That is what has been going on for the past
several years. New activities have been shunted
into winter quarter. Old ones have been
switched away from fall and spring.
The latest switch took place the other night
when men's rushing was scheduled for winter
quarter. This just about brings the former "dead
quarter" to a saturation point. You couldn't
possibly schedule another thing on A.S.S.U.
Vice-President Pat Adams' new "at-a-glance"
wall calendar of activities.
Just in case you hadn't realized it, here are a

few of the doings which are clogging the winter
activity calendar:
The Stanford Fund Drive and "Family Call,"
basketball season, the heaviest part of the sym
phony season, the Senior Prom, winter elec
tions, a probable Sadie Hawkins Hop, Ram's
Head one-acts, a University play or two, wom
en's rushing and now men's rushing with the
Pledge Prom of course, two of the A.S.S.U. con
certs, ski week-ends in the mountains, opening
of Lake Lagunita, the usual quota of house
dances, and, without a doubt, the usual quota of
rain which never fails to slow things down a bit.
So you were figuring on winter quarter for a
study quarter, were you?
Best hit those books now while you have a
chance.
