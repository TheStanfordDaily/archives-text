# BULL SESSION

### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
THE WEEK-END AT HOME
JNSTEAD of staying around school for the U.S.F.
game, your old Bull S'er drove down into the val
ley, to Fresno, to home. It takes me about four weeks
before I start thinking about how it is at home, how
Lhe yards look, how it is to sit in the den after din
ner, how good the food is, and how much I miss the
family. And it had been about four weeks so your old
Bull Sessioner drove home.
And everything seemed to be about the same as
Dver, only a little hot for this late in the fall. There
were brown leaves all over the streets and lawns, and
everyone was scared because there was a threat of
rain, and a rain would ruin all the crops and this in
turn would hurt business. There is always that fear in
the valley, and things seemed to be about the same as
ever.
The family was all feeling well, except that my
brother Eugene had hurt his finger playing football for
the Fresno High School lightweights. My little sister
Betty was taking up tennis, and she walked around in
shorts and with a tennis racket in her hand all the time.
My mother was having trouble with her pansies and
my father was worried about the Russians.

afraid," he said, "that the Russians are going to
fall. It's a shame. They fought so well."
"Yes, they did," I said.
"Yes, they fought well. It's too bad. I guess they'll
have to leave the city and hide in the hills."
"Can they do that?" I asked.
"Yes, but that won't bother the Germans. They will
have all they want. They will have gotten all the rich
country that they need."
"I guess that's right," I said.
"It's too bad. They fought so well. I'm almost cer
tain now that the United States will come out and
declare war."
"Is that right?" I asked.
"Yes, I'm almost certain of it."
"That's too bad," I said.
"Yes, that's too bad; war is too bad," he said, a
little sadly.
I talked to my neighbor, Frank, over the back fence.
He told me that his daughter had married, and was
now living in Los Angeles. "He's a fine boy," he said.
"He works for Lockheed, and they're both very happy.
Tell me, what happened at Oregon State last week?"
When he said this, I left him hanging on the back fence.

r |' , HE little girl next door had the mumps and her
brother told me all about how it was in junior
high school. He also asked about Oregon State, and
whether Kmetovic would recover soon and whether I
knew Frankie Albert. His sister's face was puffed
out from the mumps. She was always trying not to
laugh because it hurt her to laugh.
In the afternoon I went to my grandmother's house.
1 found her sitting on her porch, her eyes fastened on
an issue of Life. She was staring and shaking her
head up and down at a picture of a torch singer, who
had her hands raised above her head. Next to the
torch singer picture was an advertisement showing a
man in terrible pain.
"Do you read now, Naneh?" I asked.
"Just pictures. This nice lady is praying for this
poor man," she said. "He is dying." Then she tooT< me
and wet my face with her lips and then she made
some tea and we smoked a cigarette together. I
asked her what she thought about the war.
"Someone has caused God to become very angry,"
she said.
"Yes, Naneh. That's right," I said.
"Someone has done a terrible thing to anger God so.
A terrible thing."
Before she could ask me about the Oregon State
game, I left. The next morning we drove back to Palo
Alto. In about another four weeks I'll feel like going
home again.
