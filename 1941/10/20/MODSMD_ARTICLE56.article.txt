# CAMPUS OPINION
## BLESS OUR 3121 
### 
r rirE EDITOR, SIR:
In case Bull Session is looking for a worlliy cause
to support, we suggest that he campaign for better
service for 3121.
a) From the outside:
1. No one answers,
2. The line is continually busy.
3. When you do get the operator, he hangs up as
soon as he answers, before he can get the name
or room number from you.
4. If he doesn't hang up, he keeps you waiting 15
minutes and then says the party didn't answer.
What really happens is this:
b) From the inside:
1. You go to the phone and can't get the operator.
2. Then when you finally get him, he says the party
has hung up.
3. The lines get crossed.
Why can't we have 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 operators at
one time?
Some disgusted Union girls
P.S.: We think the operator gets a commission from
the Telephone Company, as all the girls who can pos
sibly adord it get private phones.
