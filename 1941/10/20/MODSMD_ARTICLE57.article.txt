# SYMPOSIUM OF SWING
## 
### 
r FHE EDITOR. SIR:
Though Mr. Everett -may think (Stanford Daily.
Oct. 15) that Victor "recently" issued a Symposium
of Swing, such news will assuredly surprise the Victor
Company. The album of which he speaks has been on
sale at all record shops for upwards of four years,
having been issued early in 1937.
As to the opinions expressed, I think that Mr. Ev
erett again errs. In the first place, hardly anyone ac
quainted with the swing idiom will hold any brief
either for Benny Goodman's "Sing, Sing, Sing" or for
the Tommy Dorsey band. Secondly, it was and is im
possible to collect a "symposium" of swing on four
records, and any such claim is little short of fraudu
lent. As in the present case, too much that is good is
left out. and too much that is bad is included.
