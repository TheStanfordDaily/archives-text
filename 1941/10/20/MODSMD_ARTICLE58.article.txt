# Crowd Likes Puccini Role In 'La Tosca'
## 
### 
It was the composer, rather than
the singers, who turned in the star
performance in "La Tosca" at the
San Francisco Opera House Satur
day night. Puccini attracted as usual
a particularly large crowd, and the
warmth and power of his music was
enough to satisfy the audience.
Stella Roman, making her San
Francisco debut as Tosca, showed
sparks of brilliancy in her singing
and the audience was so completely
captivated by her aria, "Vissi
d'Arte," in the second act, as to stop
the progress of the opera with ap
plause, which the soprano consid
ered great enough to step out of her
part to acknowledge.
MARIO WELL SUNG
Outstanding performer of the
evening was Charles Kullman, who
sang the role of Mario with a youth
ful fervor and richness of tone nec
essary to the part. His slight over
acting in the second act as he was
dragged away to be hanged was
completely forgotten in the last act
with his appealing rendition of
"E Lucevan Le Stella."
John Brown lee, as Scarpia, failed
to portray the wickedness demanded
by the role of the fiendish chief of
police, but his voice was pleasing
throughout although it lacked va
riety.
BACCALONE DRAWS LAUGHS
Equaling his other intelligent por
trayals of comic characters, Salva
tore Baccalone as the sacristan
proved the one perfect characteri
zation during the short time he was
on the stage.
Others in the cast provided an ade
quate background and sang their
roles with average skill. The sets
were not outstanding.
PERFORMANCE PICKS UP
Fortunately enough, the entire
opera did not follow the slow move
ment of the first act. Whether the
singers found it difficult to produce
force in their first arias while Gae
tano Merola dragged the orchestral
accompaniment, or whether it was
simply a matter of requiring time to
warm up, is a question.
Excellent balance, however, be
tween voice and orchestra was care
fully maintained, and while the
whole performance lacked the vi
tality and tragic intensity charac
teristic of "La Tosca" enough com
pensation was made in other ways
to leave the impression of a very
creditable performance. — Schwa

sang the role of Mario with a youth
ful fervor and richness of tone nec
essary to the part. His slight over
acting in the second act as he was
dragged away to be hanged was
completely forgotten in the last act
with his appealing rendition of
"E Lucevan Le Stella."
John Brown lee, as Scarpia, failed
to portray the wickedness demanded
by the role of the fiendish chief of
police, but his voice was pleasing
throughout although it lacked va
riety.
BACCALONE DRAWS LAUGHS
Equaling his other intelligent por
trayals of comic characters, Salva
tore Baccalone as the sacristan
proved the one perfect characteri
zation during the short time he was
on the stage.
Others in the cast provided an ade
quate background and sang their
roles with average skill. The sets
were not outstanding.
PERFORMANCE PICKS UP
Fortunately enough, the entire
opera did not follow the slow move
ment of the first act. Whether the
singers found it difficult to produce
force in their first arias while Gae
tano Merola dragged the orchestral
accompaniment, or whether it was
simply a matter of requiring time to
warm up, is a question.
Excellent balance, however, be
tween voice and orchestra was care
fully maintained, and while the
whole performance lacked the vi
tality and tragic intensity charac
teristic of "La Tosca" enough com
pensation was made in other ways
to leave the impression of a very
creditable performance. — Schwa

It was the composer, rather than
the singers, who turned in the star
performance in "La Tosca" at the
San Francisco Opera House Satur
day night. Puccini attracted as usual
a particularly large crowd, and the
warmth and power of his music was
enough to satisfy the audience.
Stella Roman, making her San
Francisco debut as Tosca, showed
sparks of brilliancy in her singing
and the audience was so completely
captivated by her aria, "Vissi
d'Arte," in the second act, as to stop
the progress of the opera with ap
plause, which the soprano consid
ered great enough to step out of her
part to acknowledge.
MARIO WELL SUNG
Outstanding performer of the
evening was Charles Kullman, who
sang the role of Mario with a youth
ful fervor and richness of tone nec
essary to the part. His slight over
acting in the second act as he was
dragged away to be hanged was
completely forgotten in the last act
with his appealing rendition of
"E Lucevan Le Stella."
