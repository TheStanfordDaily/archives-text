# History ... 1941

### AMIE REICHERT 
about 36 hours now the great
city of Moscow has been officially
under siege. Yesterday the Luft
waffe unleashed a gigantic blitz
bombing offensive on the Soviet
capital and it was reported that
hundreds of German spies, sabo
teurs, and terrorists parachuted be
hind the city.
Early yesterday morning Jo
sef Slalin declared that the holy
city of Communism was besieged
by the Nazi invaders. He urged a
street to street defense by every
able-bodied defender in the capi
tal.
Women and children have been
evacuated. The government has
moved to a temporary capital, Kui
byshev on the Volga, some 550 miles
cast of Moscow. Only Stalin and
the defenders of the city remain.
Manifestly, it is only a matter of
time. But in this Russo-German
war, Father Time has been in there
pitching along with the staunch
Russian soldiers.

two months now Leningrad
has endured the fire and sword
of the enemy. It still fights on. In
fact, yesterday's reports, undenied
by the Germans, claimed that the
Russians had effected a counter
attack around Leningrad.
Odessa, besieged for a month, fell
only last week. Kiev put up a tough
fight. The Reds continue to hold the
Germans 40 miles from Rostov and
the vital Caucasian oil pipe lines.
Kharkov has not been taken.
The situation is bad, but it is not
hopeless.
Two main spearheads which
Hitler last week thrust at the
Kremlin have been stalled for the
last 24 hours in the Mozhaisk and
Maloyaroslavets regions, 60 miles
west ,and 65 miles southwest of
the capital.
Even should the great city fall
in the near future, the situation
would not even then become ut
terly hopeless. The Russians can
dig in cast of the Volga, as they
already arc preparing to do, and
continue to wage destructive
warfare upon their enemies.
It must not be forgotten that ap
proximately 40 per cent of Soviet
industry is marshalled east of the
Ural mountains; that supplies from
the U.S. are flowing in an ever-in
creasing stream; that pressure in
Britain is increasing daily for more
active aid to the Soviets, and may
perhaps bear fruit; that the upris
ings throughout the length and
breadth of the European continent
continue to plague and harass the
German conquerors.

JT MUST not be forgotten either
that the loss of the Russian cap
ital would be a severe psychological
blow to morale; that a great ammu
nition industrial center would be
lost should the city fall; that sup
plies from the outside via Arch
angel would be cut off; that already
the Nazis in the Donets Basin are
threatening Allied supply lines via
the Caucasus.
This leaves only one highway
into Russia for Allied aid: Vladi
vostok, a dangerously distant port
over which the Japanese threat
hangs like a Damoclctian sword.
Supplies traveling this route from
the U.S. must go a total of 10,600
miles in contrast to the 5,400-milc
trek hy way of Archangel.
This question of supplies is, in the
long run, the crucial factor in the
Russian war. The fall of a city,
even though it be great Moscow, will
not alone 'mean the death of Russia.
But the severing of her supply ar
teries would probably prove fatal.

JAPANESE - AMERICAN relations
have passed from a state of mild
and short-lived hysteria to one of
critical surface calmness. This is the
lull which may precede the storm.
General opinion in Washington,
however, seems to be that if and
when the Japanese move it will be
against Thailand and Russia—not the
U.S. Navy.
The conferences between Nomura
and Hull arc to be resumed, but
Premier Tojo made it quite clear
that he will not tolerate any more
U.S. finagling or fooling around.
That's what the mouse said to the
cat just before she (the cat) pounced.
