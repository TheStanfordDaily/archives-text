its army in the emergency, but on its
industrial workers as well, accord
ing to Dr. Winslow, and the health
of workers in the factories and on
the farms becomes equally important
in time of war.
He will also discuss the need for
emotional as well as physical health.
Contending that the nation itself
is responsible for the rejection of
half a million men in the draft, Dr.
C. E. A. Winslow of Yale University
will speak tonight at 7:30 on "Public
Health and National Defense" in
Memorial Auditorium for the Tues
day Evening Series.
Dr. Winslow believes that the na
tion is to blame for the physical de
fects of rejected men since it has not
corrected the remediable conditions
that make them unfit.
STRESSES HOUSING
Dealing with the demand for total
defense created by total war, the
speaker will stress the fact that the
movement for better housing, social
security, and medical care for the
underprivileged must go on as essen
tial measures in the defense pro
gram.
As a health authority, Dr. Wins
low has received national and inter
national recognition, as past presi
dent of the Association of American
Bacteiiologists and the American
Public Health Association. He was
general medical director of the
League of Red Cross Societies, Ge
neva, in 1921; an assessor of the
Health Committee of the League of
Nations from 1927 to 1930. In 1930
he was International Health Direc
tor of the Rockefeller Foundation.
MANY POSITIONS
Dr. Winslow, a professor of pub
lic health at Yale, began his expe
rience in the health field as assistant
health officer in New Jersey, and
later became a member of the Mas
sachusetts State Board of Health, the
New York State Department, of
Health, and the United States Public
Health Service.
The nation depends not only upon
its army in the emergency, but on its
industrial workers as well, accord
ing to Dr. Winslow, and the health
of workers in the factories and on
the farms becomes equally important
in time of war.
He will also discuss the need for
emotional as well as physical health.
