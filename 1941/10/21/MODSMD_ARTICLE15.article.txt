"Why does the B.A.C. catch people
with other people's student body
cards at the games? Why is the
Union food so good or so bad? Come
to the Activities Forum October 29
and find the answer to these and
many other questions which have
been bothering you about Stanford,"
Pat Adams announced yesterday.

Stanford; Bill Smith, assistant su
perintendent of the Corporation

as his subject; Bones Hamilton, who
will talk on the alumni; and George

.MORE BOOGIE WOOGIE

rangements have been made so that
Bob Rieser and Tray Galliano can
play some of their boogie woogie at
the forum.
Letters have been sent to all the
organizations urging that everyone
attend the program.
The whole program is to be in
formal with short speeches, music,
and questions. There will be no long,
boring speeches. "Its just going to
be a good informal forum about
something that really concerns every
one of us," Miss Adams added.
