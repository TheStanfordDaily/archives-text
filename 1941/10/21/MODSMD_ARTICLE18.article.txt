# Nippon May Strengthen Axis Pact
## Leaders to Request Bolstering of Ties With Germany, Italy 
### 
BULLETIN
TOKYO, Tues., Oct. 21 (UP). â€”A
resolution urging the new "army"
government headed by Premier Gen.
Hidcki Tojo to strengthen Japan's
"alliance" with Germany and Italy,
and "eliminate the challenging acts
of third powers hostile to Nippon,"
will be presented to the government
today hy a strong group of members
of the lower house of Parliament.
Without mentioning the United
States by name, the parliamentar
ians, known as the "throne assisting
diet members league," will make
clear their opposition to any policy
of "temporizing" in discussing
Japan-American relations.
LIST THREE POINTS
The resolution, after pledging vig
orous support to the Cabinet, makes
three principal points:
1. A foreign policy based on in
tensification of ties with the Axis
nations as outlined in the three
power pact.
2. Vigorous action designed to
prevent encirclement of Japan by
the so-called ABCD powers (Amer
ica, Britain, China and Holland.)
3. Immediate placing of the em
pire on a total war basis to carry
out the program for a great East
Asia sphere of "mutual prosperity."
The government must organize a
"super-national defense state to at
tain the world mission of Nippon,"
the resolution states.
NEW CONFERENCES
Meantime the Nationalist newspa
per Hochi predicted that Russia will
continue her war against Germany
indefinitely and compared the prob
lem that Germany faces in her con
flict with the USSR to Japan's diffi
culties in her protracted conflict
with China.
Authorized quarters said yester
day that the new government will
resume conversations with the
United States within a week in an
effort to effect a general settlement
of Japanese-American differences.
But, it was emphasized, the new
Cabinet, in contrast to the former
government headed by Prince Fu
minaro Konoye, will not permit an
indefinite continuation of negotia
tions while Washington continues
its "plans to encircle Nippon."
TO EXAMINE U. S.
The premier and Foreign Minister
Shigenori Togo are agreed, it was
said, that the time has come for an
early and complete clarification of
the American attitude and a deci
sion as to whether there is a chance
of a satisfactory agreement. If the
outlook for agreement is hopeless, it
was said, the negotiations simply
will be called off by this country.
American quarters generally ex
pected a period of calm for the next
two weeks or more and pointed out
that a number of Japanese steamers
now are en route to the United States
in voyages which would not be un
dertaken if Tokyo expected trouble
in the near future.
