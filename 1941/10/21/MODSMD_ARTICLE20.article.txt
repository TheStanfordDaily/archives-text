# Five-Inch Tube Rivals Sun
## 
### IRVING RECTOR 
The most powerful artificial light
in the world now rests atop the
Hoover War Library: a tiny mer
cury-filled quartz tube, the inven
tion of Stanford's famous research
physicist, Cornelis 801.
Dancers on the Quad on the night
of the Fiftieth Anniversary Celebra
tion were delighted with the ro
mance lent by the intense blue
light; few realized the significance
of Dr. Bol's achievement. The amaz
ing little tube is only 5 inches long
and less than one-fourth inch in
diameter, yet it burns to a heat
more intense than that on the sur
face of the sun. It is constantly
water-cooled and consequently ra
diates so little heat that it is soon to
be used in movie studios as replace
ment for the old-fashioned illumi
nating scorchers.
SIMPLE EXPLANATION
To the layman, this may be diffi
cult to understands but Dr. 80l ex
plains it scientifically and simply:
the light of mercury slides off the
visible spectrum at the opposite side
from the red end where heat waves
predominate. This also explains the
blueness of the light. Besides its
uses in cinema projection, the light

will also be used extensively for
airport illumination and various
medical cures.
The inventor, stout, bewhiskercd,
Cornelis 80l was born 56 years ago
in Holland. He came to the United
States in 1907 to attend Princeton,
the University of Montana, and
Stanford—in that order. In 1916 he
returned to his native land to work
as chief physicist in the great Phil
lips' Glow Lamp Co. of that country.
It was here that he invented his
famous mercury vapor lamp. The
rights to its production are now held
jointly by the Phillips' Laboratories
and General Electric Co. of the
United Stales.
FLED WAR-TORN EUROPE
In 193j, Cornelis 801, his wife,
and five sons left unsettled Europe
and reti.rned, by choice, to Stanford
where he has continued his research
in thr laboratory of the physics
builc'iig. When asked by "Time
Maguiiine" why he left Europe, Dr.
801, a devoted family man, typic
ally answered, "Europe iss no plasse
to raisse fife childrun."
Early in the week, Cornelis 80l
left for New York City, possibly to
discuss the future of his remarkable
invention.

Early in the week, Cornelis 80l
left for New York City, possibly to
discuss the future of his remarkable
invention.
The most powerful artificial light
in the world now rests atop the
Hoover War Library: a tiny mer
cury-filled quartz tube, the inven
tion of Stanford's famous research
physicist, Cornelis 801.
Dancers on the Quad on the night
of the Fiftieth Anniversary Celebra
tion were delighted with the ro
mance lent by the intense blue
light; few realized the significance
of Dr. Bol's achievement. The amaz
ing little tube is only 5 inches long
and less than one-fourth inch in
diameter, yet it burns to a heat
more intense than that on the sur
face of the sun. It is constantly
water-cooled and consequently ra
diates so little heat that it is soon to
be used in movie studios as replace
ment for the old-fashioned illumi
nating scorchers.
SIMPLE EXPLANATION
To the layman, this may be diffi
cult to understands but Dr. 80l ex
plains it scientifically and simply:
the light of mercury slides off the
visible spectrum at the opposite side
from the red end where heat waves
predominate. This also explains the
blueness of the light. Besides its
uses in cinema projection, the light

will also be used extensively for
airport illumination and various
medical cures.
The inventor, stout, bewhiskercd,
Cornelis 80l was born 56 years ago
in Holland. He came to the United
States in 1907 to attend Princeton,
the University of Montana, and
Stanford—in that order. In 1916 he
returned to his native land to work
as chief physicist in the great Phil
lips' Glow Lamp Co. of that country.
It was here that he invented his
famous mercury vapor lamp. The
rights to its production are now held
jointly by the Phillips' Laboratories
and General Electric Co. of the
United Stales.
FLED WAR-TORN EUROPE
In 193j, Cornelis 801, his wife,
and five sons left unsettled Europe
and reti.rned, by choice, to Stanford
where he has continued his research
in thr laboratory of the physics
builc'iig. When asked by "Time
Maguiiine" why he left Europe, Dr.
801, a devoted family man, typic
ally answered, "Europe iss no plasse
to raisse fife childrun."
