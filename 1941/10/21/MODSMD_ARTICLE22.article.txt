When Lennox Robinson's "The
Far Oil' Hills" comes to the stage of
the Little Theater on Wednesday
night, it will be with a cast of "pol
ished actors," according to Director
Charles Vance; some of whom are
newcomers to the Farm, and some
whose reputation here is already es
tablished.
Both Frank Burt, playing the role
of Patrick Clancey, and Ted Mar
cuse, playing Oliver O'Shaughnessy,
were members of the original Tahoe
Theater group, and are triple
threat men in the theater, directing,
acting, and managing. Marcuse is a
newcomer to the cast of the Irish
comedy, having stepped into a va
cancy last Friday.
NEW ACTORS FEATURED
Marian Clancy, heroine of the
play, will be played by Sylvia Berry,
whose work in "The Warrior's Hus
band" won her an offer of a Holly
wood contract (which she refused in
order to finish her schooling). Op
posite Miss Berry, as Pierce Hegerty,
is Lisle Selby, new to Stanford, but
an actor who has appeared in many
productions at U.C. and in San
Francisco.
Kitty Belle Tippetls, Nancy Bur
kett, and Bernice Linden have all
handled minor parts in other Stan
ford Players productions, but in
"The Far Off Hills," all three ap
pear in their first, major roles.
Georgia Haviland will be seen as
Ellen, the Clancy maid, whose teeth
warn her of an approaching change
in her "gentleman friends."
