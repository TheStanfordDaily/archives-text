### 
BERLIN, Oct. 2ft (UP).—Germany
has loosed on beleaguered Moscow
a sustained and steadily mounting
aerial bombardment as intensive at
its peaks as the raids which blighted
great stretches of London last year,
Nazi informants said tonight.
The Germans said the battle for
Moscow raged with unremitting
fury, with pressure on the imperiled
capital intensified by annihilation
air raids of the type heretofore re
served by the Nazis for such cities
as London, Warsaw and Rotterdam.
A curtain of secrecy still hung
over the panzer onslaught against
Moscow's ringed fortifications. The
last word v/as that titanic thrusts
Saturday had cracked the city's out
er defenses at many places and Red
army attempts to stem the assault
had been thwarted.
