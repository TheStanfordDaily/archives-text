### DON SELBY 
ALTHOUGH it has been more
than a week since Stanford's
football team and Clark Shaughnes
sy returned from the Northwest anc
the Oregon State debacle, it just oc
curred to us that in saying the nexi
thing to nothing about the loss
Shaughnessy set an example thai
more coaches should follow.
A goodly portion of those fron
this part of the state who saw the
game have said that in their opinion
the Ind inns would win four out ol
five games played against the Beav
ers. We're only guessing, but we'd
be willing to bet that Shaughnessy
feels the same way about it.
Hut did he say anything to that
rlTcct? No. And the chances are
he wouldn't, even if his charges
were to lose games Saturday after
Saturday. Perhaps that is some
thing he learned while coaching
losing teams so long at the Uni
versity of Chicago.
There are probably a few other
coaches in college football with the
same idea, but they are far out
numbered by contemporaries who
feel that there is nothing like an ex
cuse to soften things after a de
feat. Each Sunday and Monday
mornings, the papers carry stories
quoting coaches of defeated elevens,
and more often than not those quo
tations are to the effect that "we
wuz robbed."
The particular example we have
in mind is the statement made by
Matty Mathews, Portland University
mentor, after his team was shellacked
by a 31-0 count by Red Strader's St.
Mary's Gaels Sunday. Mathews is al
leged to have said that if his team
were to play the Gaels again they'd
win.
How do you know what the out
come would he if the two teams
were to play again? The point is,
that the teams WON'T play again
this season.
So whyinell don't the guys just
keep their traps shut and take it on
the chin when victory fails to come
their way, especially when the con
test is as much of a runaway as the
Gael-Portland thing was.

| letter to Mr. Bill Leiser,
sports editor, The San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
Dear Bill:
There is, as you must know, a
certain Mr. Will Connelly on your
staff. He seems like a swell guy.
As a matter of fact, we think he is,
despite the fact that he picked Cali
fornia to go to the Rose Bowl. But
he has probably heard enough about
that by now.
The thing that we're wondering
about is Stanford's trip north and
the game against Washington at
Seattle. NSturally, your paper
will he represented 011 the trip.
But who will he the man?
Please, don't make it Mr. Con
nelly. He went to Pullman with
the Bears. W.S.C. won. He went to
Corvallis with the Indians. O.S.C.
won. And just last week, he went to
Eugene with Cal again. Yeh, and
the Ducks took that one.
Now it comes time for another
trek to the Northwest. Our In
dians just have to cop this game
to keep in the running for the
conference crown. We don't doubt
hut what Mr. Connelly would like
to see the Big Red Machine win
this one, hut 110 matter what his
likes and dislikes are, he is nev
ertheless a distinct jinx to teams
from our section of the state trav
eling north. Why, he is even more
effective than the famed Palouse
jinx.
You wouldn't like to see Stanford
downed, would you? No, of course
not. It would make your pick of
Stanford through the season look
awfully silly. The solution is a sim
ple one. Just assign Mr. Connelly
to the California-U.S.C. game. That
would be nice.
Thanks, Bill, we knew you'd un
derstand.

QUITE a disappointment was the
defeat of Nort Thornton's water
polo team, which dropped the open
ing conference tilt to U.C.L.A. last
week.
Nort has been more than a little
proud of his charges, quite often
saying that they were the hoys to
cop the title this year. And they
might yet. for all we know. But
(he chances of that happening
aren't too good, for (he Bruins

losing teams so long at the Uni
versity of Chicago.
There are probably a few other
coaches in college football with the
same idea, but they are far out
numbered by contemporaries who
feel that there is nothing like an ex
cuse to soften things after a de
feat. Each Sunday and Monday
mornings, the papers carry stories
quoting coaches of defeated elevens,
and more often than not those quo
tations are to the effect that "we
wuz robbed."
The particular example we have
in mind is the statement made by
Matty Mathews, Portland University
mentor, after his team was shellacked
by a 31-0 count by Red Strader's St.
Mary's Gaels Sunday. Mathews is al
leged to have said that if his team
were to play the Gaels again they'd
win.
How do you know what the out
come would he if the two teams
were to play again? The point is,
that the teams WON'T play again
this season.
So whyinell don't the guys just
keep their traps shut and take it on
the chin when victory fails to come
their way, especially when the con
test is as much of a runaway as the
Gael-Portland thing was.

Dear Bill:
There is, as you must know, a
certain Mr. Will Connelly on your
staff. He seems like a swell guy.
As a matter of fact, we think he is,
despite the fact that he picked Cali
fornia to go to the Rose Bowl. But
he has probably heard enough about
that by now.
The thing that we're wondering
about is Stanford's trip north and
the game against Washington at
Seattle. NSturally, your paper
will he represented 011 the trip.
But who will he the man?
Please, don't make it Mr. Con
nelly. He went to Pullman with
the Bears. W.S.C. won. He went to
Corvallis with the Indians. O.S.C.
won. And just last week, he went to
Eugene with Cal again. Yeh, and
the Ducks took that one.
Now it comes time for another
trek to the Northwest. Our In
dians just have to cop this game
to keep in the running for the
conference crown. We don't doubt
hut what Mr. Connelly would like
to see the Big Red Machine win
this one, hut 110 matter what his
likes and dislikes are, he is nev
ertheless a distinct jinx to teams
from our section of the state trav
eling north. Why, he is even more
effective than the famed Palouse
jinx.
You wouldn't like to see Stanford
downed, would you? No, of course
not. It would make your pick of
Stanford through the season look
awfully silly. The solution is a sim
ple one. Just assign Mr. Connelly
to the California-U.S.C. game. That
would be nice.
Thanks, Bill, we knew you'd un
derstand.

QUITE a disappointment was the
defeat of Nort Thornton's water
polo team, which dropped the open
ing conference tilt to U.C.L.A. last
week.
Nort has been more than a little
proud of his charges, quite often
saying that they were the hoys to
cop the title this year. And they
might yet. for all we know. But
(he chances of that happening
aren't too good, for (he Bruins
appear (o he tops.
ALTHOUGH it has been more
than a week since Stanford's
football team and Clark Shaughnes
sy returned from the Northwest anc
the Oregon State debacle, it just oc
curred to us that in saying the nexi
thing to nothing about the loss
Shaughnessy set an example thai
more coaches should follow.
A goodly portion of those fron
this part of the state who saw the
game have said that in their opinion
the Ind inns would win four out ol
five games played against the Beav
ers. We're only guessing, but we'd
be willing to bet that Shaughnessy
feels the same way about it.
Hut did he say anything to that
rlTcct? No. And the chances are
he wouldn't, even if his charges
were to lose games Saturday after
Saturday. Perhaps that is some
thing he learned while coaching
losing teams so long at the Uni

come would he if the two teams
were to play again? The point is,
that the teams WON'T play again
this season.
So whyinell don't the guys just
keep their traps shut and take it on
the chin when victory fails to come
their way, especially when the con
test is as much of a runaway as the
Gael-Portland thing was.

| letter to Mr. Bill Leiser,
sports editor, The San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
Dear Bill:
There is, as you must know, a
certain Mr. Will Connelly on your
staff. He seems like a swell guy.
As a matter of fact, we think he is,
despite the fact that he picked Cali
fornia to go to the Rose Bowl. But
he has probably heard enough about
that by now.
The thing that we're wondering
about is Stanford's trip north and
the game against Washington at
Seattle. NSturally, your paper
will he represented 011 the trip.
But who will he the man?
Please, don't make it Mr. Con
nelly. He went to Pullman with
the Bears. W.S.C. won. He went to
Corvallis with the Indians. O.S.C.
won. And just last week, he went to
Eugene with Cal again. Yeh, and
the Ducks took that one.
Now it comes time for another
trek to the Northwest. Our In
dians just have to cop this game
to keep in the running for the
conference crown. We don't doubt
hut what Mr. Connelly would like
to see the Big Red Machine win
this one, hut 110 matter what his
likes and dislikes are, he is nev
ertheless a distinct jinx to teams
from our section of the state trav
eling north. Why, he is even more
effective than the famed Palouse
jinx.
You wouldn't like to see Stanford
downed, would you? No, of course
not. It would make your pick of
Stanford through the season look
awfully silly. The solution is a sim
ple one. Just assign Mr. Connelly
to the California-U.S.C. game. That
would be nice.
Thanks, Bill, we knew you'd un
derstand.

QUITE a disappointment was the
defeat of Nort Thornton's water
polo team, which dropped the open
ing conference tilt to U.C.L.A. last
week.
Nort has been more than a little
proud of his charges, quite often
saying that they were the hoys to
cop the title this year. And they
might yet. for all we know. But
(he chances of that happening
aren't too good, for (he Bruins
appear (o he tops.
ALTHOUGH it has been more
than a week since Stanford's
football team and Clark Shaughnes
sy returned from the Northwest anc
the Oregon State debacle, it just oc
curred to us that in saying the nexi
thing to nothing about the loss
Shaughnessy set an example thai
more coaches should follow.
A goodly portion of those fron
this part of the state who saw the
game have said that in their opinion
the Ind inns would win four out ol
five games played against the Beav
ers. We're only guessing, but we'd
be willing to bet that Shaughnessy
feels the same way about it.
Hut did he say anything to that
rlTcct? No. And the chances are
he wouldn't, even if his charges
were to lose games Saturday after
Saturday. Perhaps that is some
thing he learned while coaching
losing teams so long at the Uni
versity of Chicago.
There are probably a few other
coaches in college football with the
same idea, but they are far out
numbered by contemporaries who
feel that there is nothing like an ex
cuse to soften things after a de
feat. Each Sunday and Monday
mornings, the papers carry stories
quoting coaches of defeated elevens,
and more often than not those quo
tations are to the effect that "we
wuz robbed."
The particular example we have
in mind is the statement made by
Matty Mathews, Portland University
mentor, after his team was shellacked
by a 31-0 count by Red Strader's St.
Mary's Gaels Sunday. Mathews is al
leged to have said that if his team
were to play the Gaels again they'd
win.
How do you know what the out
come would he if the two teams
were to play again? The point is,
that the teams WON'T play again
this season.
So whyinell don't the guys just
keep their traps shut and take it on
the chin when victory fails to come
