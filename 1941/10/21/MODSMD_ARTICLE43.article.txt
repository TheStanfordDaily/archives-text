# Indians Lose Two of Their Three Quarters; Kmet Back
## 
### 
When Stanford's varsity football squad leaves for Seattle Thursday for
their all important game with the Washington Huskies, they will he
bolstered by the presence of Pete Knietovic and Ilank Norberg, but they
will be lacking the services of Ray Hammett, Ray Durham, and Frank
Fcrbes, all of whom were injured in the U.S.F. game last Saturday.

Kmetovic and Norberg were back
at their left half and left end posi
tions in yesterday's practice, having
fully recovered from their injuries.
Durham received a brain concus
sion in the Don game, which ac
counts for his lapse on Franceschi's
touchdown run. He will be out for
an indefinite period. Hammett
chipped a bone in his leg and will
be out for three weeks. Forbes
wrefiched his knee, which will
probably put him out for good.
COLE TO QUARTERBACK
A1 Cole has been switched to the
quarterback position behind Frankie
Albert by Coach Shaughnessy, since
the injuries to Durham and Ham
mett left Albert without a substitute
when the team was on offense.
Arnie Meiners will go tip to San
I Francisco today to consult a special
| ist as to whether he should play
1 Saturday or not. With Meiners and
! Norberg out of the left flank spot
last week, Shaughnessy moved Jack
J Francis into the position. Because
j of Francis' good showing Saturday,
, he was running with the first string
in the first pre-Husky practice.
VOOCH OK' AGAIN
Milt Vucinich, who became
"punchy" for a time Saturday after
a blow on the head, was back in
good shape yesterday and running
at his new right halfback spot.
Coach Shaughnessy was using a
backfield of Albert. Kmetovic, Vuci
nich, and Willard Sheller which
promises to give the team its best
running attack since the exodus of
j Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Stand-
I lee.
The line had Francis, Ed Stamm,
Chuck Taylor, Vic Linskog, Loren
LaPrade, Bruno Banducci, and Fred
Meyer .from left to right. LaPrade
! sustained a serious cut on his hand
1 Saturday, but he will be ready for
| the Huskies. He and Vucinich
| worked out in sweat suits yesterday
rather than the regular uniforms.
