# Governali Sparks Columbia's Streak
## 
### 
After the first four weeks of the
1941 football campaign, some sensa
tional backs have cropped up in
the East.
Tony Governali sparked Colum
bia's short winning streak with
sensational running. The Lion back
is not fast but Tiis ability to get
through the entire opposing team is
amazing. Andy Tomasic is the
greatest back Temple has had since
Dave Smuckler.
