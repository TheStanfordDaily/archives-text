# The 						Taste That Tells

MANY are the reasons which have been
advanced for the defeat of Hitler and the
complete eradication from the face of the earth
of his dictated, regimented New Order.
Political and economic reasons normally take
the fore with their world-shaking import. But to
us as students in a liberal University, in a free
country, there is another reason why this men
ace to our future political, economic, and intel
lectual freedom must be crushed—Nazism, Hit
lerism cannot stand up under free thought. It
exists only as long as it can control the think
ing and, from this, the speaking of its subjects.
This is not conjecture.
If it were, would there be need for concen
tration camps for those who speak what they
think?
Would it be necessary for every candidate for
teaching credentials in modern Germany to
swear this oath: "Adolt Hitler, we will see to it
that our young people become imbued with
your ideas, thoughts, and will"?
Would it be necessary for Herr Dr. Goebbels
to tell 2,500 students and teachers gathered in
the Sportspalast in 1939: "The brain worker must
learn to obey, not to reason"?
"If free thought could exist under totalitarian
rule, would one of Nazi Germany's leading edu
cators express the keynote of his educational
ideas in words like these: "Learning is mean
ingful only where it giows out of racial con
sciousness and serves the interests of the na
tional community"?
Statements such as these do not dovetail with
ideas on educational liberty prevalent outside
the sphere of the New Order. It is impossible to
imagine Oxford or Harvard or Stanford operat
ing under such a system. ,
"Men who have tasted liberty never forget
the taste," said Dr. Raymond Fosdick.
All we have to do is to make sure that new
Germany's younger generation gets that taste.
"A free press stands as one of the great
interpreters between the government and the
people. To allow it to be fettered is to tetter
ourselves."—Mr. Justice Sutherland
