EXCERPTS from an article by Eleanor Roose
velt in the first issue of Threshold, October,
published by International Student Service:
"I should want to choose my courses very
carefully, both from the point of view of subject
matter and the point of view of the personality
of the people giving the courses.
My reason for emphasizing the importance
of taking into consideration the personalities of
the people giving various courses is that I think
contacts with great people leave a mark never
to be obliterated from the minds and souls of
the young. A great teacher can inspire, can
illuminate a subject, can open up new avenues
for exploration and start a student along paths
which may lead that student beyond the ability
of the teacher. Therefore, it is no unimportant
thing to study the personality of the man or
woman who is going to give a course, before
making a decision. If a teacher has the quality
which makes a student want to work, the work
will be worth while.
"An interest in labor will lead to a study of
certain industries and a comparison with indus
tries elsewhere.
"( stress this particular item of one's education

because it seems to me that it is one we can
least afford to neglect at this particular moment
in history when democracy is being challenged
and each one of us must do our share in edu
cating ourselves to meet that challenge.
"Some time during the four years at college,
if I were not earning my way through, I would
put in a period of work with my hands as well as
with my head. I would make it a point to take a
job which required manual labor and I would
stick to it long enough to really know what it
means to work with my hands for eight con
secutive hours. This, of course, is part of the
kind of self-discipline which I think all of us
should acquire and the sooner we acquire it, the
less difficult it is.
"Life will force us all, as time goes on, to
accept discipline, but if we have not imposed
it on ourselves, the acceptance forced upon us
is not as valuable in the formation of character.
The imposing on oneself of certain obligations
which cannot be shirked under any form of
ordered society is an education for life as a
citizen."

it on ourselves, the acceptance forced upon us
is not as valuable in the formation of character.
The imposing on oneself of certain obligations
which cannot be shirked under any form of
ordered society is an education for life as a
citizen."
EXCERPTS from an article by Eleanor Roose
velt in the first issue of Threshold, October,
published by International Student Service:
"I should want to choose my courses very
carefully, both from the point of view of subject
matter and the point of view of the personality
of the people giving the courses.
My reason for emphasizing the importance
of taking into consideration the personalities of
the people giving various courses is that I think
contacts with great people leave a mark never
to be obliterated from the minds and souls of
the young. A great teacher can inspire, can
illuminate a subject, can open up new avenues
for exploration and start a student along paths
which may lead that student beyond the ability
of the teacher. Therefore, it is no unimportant
thing to study the personality of the man or
woman who is going to give a course, before
making a decision. If a teacher has the quality
which makes a student want to work, the work
will be worth while.
"An interest in labor will lead to a study of
certain industries and a comparison with indus
tries elsewhere.
"( stress this particular item of one's education

because it seems to me that it is one we can
least afford to neglect at this particular moment
in history when democracy is being challenged
and each one of us must do our share in edu
cating ourselves to meet that challenge.
"Some time during the four years at college,
if I were not earning my way through, I would
put in a period of work with my hands as well as
with my head. I would make it a point to take a
job which required manual labor and I would
stick to it long enough to really know what it
means to work with my hands for eight con
secutive hours. This, of course, is part of the
kind of self-discipline which I think all of us
should acquire and the sooner we acquire it, the
less difficult it is.
"Life will force us all, as time goes on, to
accept discipline, but if we have not imposed
it on ourselves, the acceptance forced upon us
is not as valuable in the formation of character.
The imposing on oneself of certain obligations
which cannot be shirked under any form of
