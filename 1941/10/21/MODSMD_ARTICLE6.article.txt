### KAY SCHWARTZ 
Stanford sororities wlil dust off
the wclcome mats in front of their
respective houses next Friday, Sat
urday, and Sunday from .'I to 5:30
p.m. when all new women who are
interested take part in the first
sorority function of the year.
Panhellenic Council is sponsoring
a series of open houses, as a gesture
of hospitality to new women enter
ing this fall and, according to Coun
cil president, Barbara Rapp, the sec
ond floors of each sorority house
will be open for inspection. This is
an opportunity for any new woman
to see what a sorority house and its
members looks like in an informal,
everyday atmosphere, she added,
lit; GUESTS A DAY
Each house will entertain one
hundred sixteen new women each
day for three days. The list of guests
will divided alphabetically so that
a group of girls whose last names
come within the alphabetical divi
sion designated by Pan Hellenic
Council will be entertained by a
certain house on each successive
day. The method of division, as
planned by Council, will be an
nounced in the Daily later in the
week.
SECRETARY SPEAKS
A strictly informal atmosphere
will be maintained throughout the
open house series. Council requests
that the new women wear Quad
clothes and also put on name tags

her office this week from 1 to 2
to aid in introductions. The sorority
women have been instructed to do
likewise.
In a meeting held yesterday at the
Nitery, Council discussed final plans
for the open houses and listened to
an address by Mrs. J. A. Younger,
Pan Hellenic executive secretary.
She discussed some of the more
technical points in the new rushing
system and stating that, "The aim
of this new system is to contribute
toward a more acceptable form of
rushing."
Mrs. Younger also stressed the
fact that rushing is not the exclu
sive function of Pan Hellenic Coun
cil. It offers more to Stanford than
self-preservation, for through its
activities Council helps the college
woman ot adjust herself to expe
riences which she will have to face
throughout her life.
LISTS OFFICE HOURS
Miss Rapp, Pan Hellenic presi
dent, has just opened her new of
fice in the Union and will have office
hours there until the conclusion of
the rushing season. Both she and
Mrs. Younger have earnestly re
quested any of the Row women at
Stanford who have any suggestions
for the improvement of the func
tions of Pan Hellenic Council to
contact them during their regular
office hours. Miss Rapp will be in
o'clock every afternoon.
