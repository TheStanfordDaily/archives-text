# BULL SESSION
## TO MR. SULLIVAN 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
"W/HILE prowling around our files room, I noticed
last Friday's issue of the University of San Fran
cisco Foghorn. In particular I noticed a column called
Sports Lowdown, written by Gene Sullivan. Halfway
through the column I noticed my name and noticed
that Mr. Sullivan, who is sports editor of the Foghorn,
was attacking something that I said in my column
about the Don football team. If you will excuse me,
I would like to take this column to comment on Mr.
Sullivan's attack.
The following is what appeared in the Foghorn:
"A so-called writer (that means that I'm not
really a writer but that I'm just called a writer)
for The Stanford Daily had nothing to say so he
said this:
" 'It is too had that our climb back to the top
has to start with the University of San Francisco.
The Dons are one of the weakest teams in organ
ized football, and would have a tough time edg
ing out Mills College, if Mary Shadid, full
back for Mills, hadn't gotten a lockout and gotten
herself declared ineligible. We will gain none of
our lost prestige, no matter how badly wc beat the
Dons, and it will be a wasted Saturday.'
"This little tidbit (that means the above quota
tion) almost got a rise out of us until we consid
ered the source—a Mr. Cheslie Saroyan, feature
writer who seemed short on copy and wandered
onto sports, about which he evidently knew little.
Yes, he claims to be a cousin of William Saroyan,
that explains everything."
* * * *
'J'HAT was written by the sports editor of the U.S.F.
Foghorn, and it is an attack on what I said about
the San Francisco football team. And although Mr.
Sullivan says that everything is explained, to me noth
ing is explained. The only thing that I got out of
the article was that Mr. Sullivan is so tied up with
everything that is U.SF. that he has lost his sense of
reason . And anything that is said against the Dons,
whether it be true or false, will get a rise out of Mr.
Sullivan, although he says that my comments did not
get a rise out of him.
Mr. Sullivan, you did not make it clear to me as to
where I was wrong about the Don football team. If
you had wanted to, you could have pointed to the
powerful showings that the Dons made against St.
Mary's and Santa Clara. You could have shown, by
comparative scores, that the Dons are really strong
and you could show how Stanford would gain pres
tige by beating the Dons.
You didn't do this, and I don't blame you, because
you would have a hell of a time.
Instead, Mr. Sullivan, you preferred to defend the
Dons by merely saying that I didn't know a thing
about sports. As a matter of fact, I know a lot about
sports. For the things I say, I will give scores, com
parative statistics and facts. And any time that you
would like to dispute my statements, kindly give facts
and we can have a good argument.
If you have figures to prove that U.S.F. is not one
of the weakest teams in organized football, if you can
prove that Stanford gained prestige by whipping the
Dons, then I will say that I'm wrong, but to attack my
comments by saying that he is "a cousin of William
Saroyan, that explains everything," is entirely inade
quate and shows a definite lack of valid facts and a
lack of rational, unemotional sense of analysis.

'J'HAT was written by the sports editor of the U.S.F.
Foghorn, and it is an attack on what I said about
the San Francisco football team. And although Mr.
Sullivan says that everything is explained, to me noth
ing is explained. The only thing that I got out of
the article was that Mr. Sullivan is so tied up with
everything that is U.SF. that he has lost his sense of
reason . And anything that is said against the Dons,
whether it be true or false, will get a rise out of Mr.
Sullivan, although he says that my comments did not
get a rise out of him.
Mr. Sullivan, you did not make it clear to me as to
where I was wrong about the Don football team. If
you had wanted to, you could have pointed to the
powerful showings that the Dons made against St.
Mary's and Santa Clara. You could have shown, by
comparative scores, that the Dons are really strong
and you could show how Stanford would gain pres
tige by beating the Dons.
You didn't do this, and I don't blame you, because
you would have a hell of a time.
Instead, Mr. Sullivan, you preferred to defend the
Dons by merely saying that I didn't know a thing
about sports. As a matter of fact, I know a lot about
sports. For the things I say, I will give scores, com
parative statistics and facts. And any time that you
would like to dispute my statements, kindly give facts
and we can have a good argument.
If you have figures to prove that U.S.F. is not one
of the weakest teams in organized football, if you can
prove that Stanford gained prestige by whipping the
Dons, then I will say that I'm wrong, but to attack my
comments by saying that he is "a cousin of William
Saroyan, that explains everything," is entirely inade
quate and shows a definite lack of valid facts and a
lack of rational, unemotional sense of analysis.
"W/HILE prowling around our files room, I noticed
last Friday's issue of the University of San Fran
cisco Foghorn. In particular I noticed a column called
Sports Lowdown, written by Gene Sullivan. Halfway
through the column I noticed my name and noticed
that Mr. Sullivan, who is sports editor of the Foghorn,
was attacking something that I said in my column
about the Don football team. If you will excuse me,
I would like to take this column to comment on Mr.
Sullivan's attack.
The following is what appeared in the Foghorn:
"A so-called writer (that means that I'm not
really a writer but that I'm just called a writer)

said this:
