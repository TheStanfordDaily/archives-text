the editor, sir:
i am just an ordinary guy which does not get to
the pickture show more than onct in a month, i gotta
depend on you guys to tell me what it is that is going
on in the theater, now ofThand i would say that
usually you does a pretty good job but there comes
a time when us guys like me feel that we gotta kick
coming, i aint saying i do not like the revues which
you write but this on partikular thing in your review
on major barbara has got me irritated enough to write
this which i am writing, what i wants to know is—who
is this guy ivar kruger and what has he got to do with
the raoom pikturc biz?
yers,
mike frite
