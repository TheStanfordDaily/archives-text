# Hackneyed Plot Highlighted By R.A.F. Battle Scenes
## 
### 
"A Yank in the R.A.F.," starring Tyrone Power, Betty Grable, and
assorted Blenheim Bombers, Spitfires, and Mcsserchmitts, now playing
at the Fox Stanford Theater.
Some day there may he a movie constructed about an American who is
involved with Burke's Peerage, Oxford, or the British armed forces. This

American will not be a cocky,
may-care fellow who can find a
blonde under every bush on Saville i
Row. This may happen—but it will
not happen in my time; nor in
yours.
This time the Yank is Tyrone
Power, and the leading blonde is
Betty Grable, a nightclub dancer.
His love for her is a casual thing;
but she finds him irresistible. "You
worm!" she often shrieks, kissing
him passionately.
BREAKS DATE
Mr. Power, while in London dur
'ing the early days of the present
war, renews acquaintance with the
dancer. She tells him he is a worm
because he broke a date they had a
year ago in Dallas. So he joins the
R.A.F. to be near her.
This, in effect, is the plot of "A
Yank in the R.A.F." Of course, the
minute Our Hero breaks another
date, the dancer takes up with a
titled Englishman who is not a worm
and never breaks dates except when
he has to bomb Berlin.
SLICK DIALOGUE
On the credit or entertainment
side, '"A Yank in the R.A.F." has
some slick comedy dialogue, a
couple of good, restrained stifl
upper-lip scenes, and Miss Betty
Grable's legs, of which she has two.
And then the flying scenes, among
the most powerful ever filmed, made
with the help of the R.A.F. under
war conditions. Among the shots <
you'll never forget are: the raid I
over Berlin with searchlights stab
bing the sky, the roar of the flak,
the metallic gleam of the planes as
they zoom and twist in and out of j
the glare; the crippled plane land
ing at 90 miles an hour on a tiny
strip of beach; the shot of an in
jured German pilot, blood streaming |
down his face, and then smoke fill- ]
ing the cockpit as he falls toward j
the bloody beach at Dunkirk,
Certainly the picture does just
exactly what it was intended to do. j
The actors and director have put as j
much as they can into the classic, !
hackneyed plot. Anyone could have
detailed the whole scheme of events |
after seeing the first two scenes.
POWER NOT TOO BAD
Power is cocky without being too
painful. Miss Grable looks attrac- j
tive, sings and dances in brief attii'e, j
and the part makes no demands on
her histrionic ability—which is ;
probably just as well. Reginald i
Gardiner smoothly steals every scene i
he's in. You'll remember his cool j
chatter as he dives straight down ;
the beam of a Nazi searchlight.
All-in-all, "A Yank in the R.A.F." I
is a popular, entertaining feature '
which should make lots of money. |
However, Mr. Darryl Zanuck might ;
note that this is quite a big war i
now. And the attitude of his hand- !
some leading man sometimes looks i
a little puerile, beside the looming !
horror of his backdrop.—Nowell

SLICK DIALOGUE
On the credit or entertainment
side, '"A Yank in the R.A.F." has
some slick comedy dialogue, a
couple of good, restrained stifl
upper-lip scenes, and Miss Betty
Grable's legs, of which she has two.
And then the flying scenes, among
the most powerful ever filmed, made
with the help of the R.A.F. under
war conditions. Among the shots <
you'll never forget are: the raid I
over Berlin with searchlights stab
bing the sky, the roar of the flak,
the metallic gleam of the planes as
they zoom and twist in and out of j
the glare; the crippled plane land
ing at 90 miles an hour on a tiny
strip of beach; the shot of an in
jured German pilot, blood streaming |
down his face, and then smoke fill- ]
ing the cockpit as he falls toward j
the bloody beach at Dunkirk,
Certainly the picture does just
exactly what it was intended to do. j
The actors and director have put as j
much as they can into the classic, !
hackneyed plot. Anyone could have
detailed the whole scheme of events |
after seeing the first two scenes.
POWER NOT TOO BAD
Power is cocky without being too
painful. Miss Grable looks attrac- j
tive, sings and dances in brief attii'e, j
and the part makes no demands on
her histrionic ability—which is ;
probably just as well. Reginald i
Gardiner smoothly steals every scene i
he's in. You'll remember his cool j
chatter as he dives straight down ;
the beam of a Nazi searchlight.
All-in-all, "A Yank in the R.A.F." I
is a popular, entertaining feature '
which should make lots of money. |
However, Mr. Darryl Zanuck might ;
note that this is quite a big war i
now. And the attitude of his hand- !
some leading man sometimes looks i
a little puerile, beside the looming !
horror of his backdrop.—Nowell
"A Yank in the R.A.F.," starring Tyrone Power, Betty Grable, and
assorted Blenheim Bombers, Spitfires, and Mcsserchmitts, now playing
at the Fox Stanford Theater.
Some day there may he a movie constructed about an American who is
involved with Burke's Peerage, Oxford, or the British armed forces. This

American will not be a cocky,
may-care fellow who can find a
blonde under every bush on Saville i
Row. This may happen—but it will
not happen in my time; nor in
yours.
This time the Yank is Tyrone
Power, and the leading blonde is
Betty Grable, a nightclub dancer.
His love for her is a casual thing;
but she finds him irresistible. "You
worm!" she often shrieks, kissing
him passionately.
BREAKS DATE
Mr. Power, while in London dur
'ing the early days of the present
war, renews acquaintance with the
dancer. She tells him he is a worm
because he broke a date they had a
year ago in Dallas. So he joins the
R.A.F. to be near her.
This, in effect, is the plot of "A
Yank in the R.A.F." Of course, the
minute Our Hero breaks another
date, the dancer takes up with a
titled Englishman who is not a worm
and never breaks dates except when
he has to bomb Berlin.
