# Dancers Try For Gaieties Roles Today
## 
### 
Margo Crane, dance director for
the Big Game Gaieties, who is look
ing for Stanfordites that can dance,
and Stanfordites who are looking
for a dancing role in the Big Game
Gaieties will meet today at a try
out session in Ram's Head room of
the auditorium from 4 to 6â€”not
from 1 to 5 as previously announced.
Male dancers for the production's
routine are especially needed, and
show directors urge anyone with any
trace of talent to forget bashfulness
and turn out.
Those who qualify for this spot in
the show are virtually assured of
another part elsewhere in the re
view. The heads of the production
hope for a sizeable turnout.
Acting tryouts for the extrava
ganza will be held in the audito
rium's foyer tomorrow during the
entire afternoon.
Asher Wilson, Gaieties head, is
looking for a five-foot five-inch stu
dent who can roller-skate. He will
be used in a novelty spot in the
script. Anyone qualified should see
Wilson at once.
