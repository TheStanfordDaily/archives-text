| AST Monday this column dis
u cussed Herbert Hoover's latest
appeal for food shipments to the
starving children of Occupied Eu
rope. "History 1941" presented a j
case against the proposed plan
which has apparently started a small
controversy, evidence of which may
bo seen in today's Campus Opinion
letter.
"History 1941" will continue there
fore to discuss this issue in a series
of articles, of which this is the first.

|Y|R. HOOVEIt has proposed that
the United States feed some 40
million children in the Nazi-occupied
countries of Europe. He points out
that food sent from Britain to the
40,000 British prisoners in Germany
has been distributed "with fidelity."
He proposes to set up a neutral
board to dole out the food, to in
sure its delivery into civilian, not
Nazi hands. Mr. Hoover is quick to
point out the efficiency of this plan
as carried out in Belgium during the
last war, and he feels that it can
be done again without in the least
jeopardizing the position of the Al
lies or aiding the Germans.
Neither of these precedents —
that of food 'for British prison
ers or food for Belgium in World
War ll—are valid arguments in
this larger issue. The situations
are not analogous. Where on the
one hand the British sent food to
40,000 men, the U.S. to seven or
eig'it million Belgians, the present
I 1 oposal involves 40 million peo
ple, and a proportionately greater
.'mount of supplies, and greater
risk should these supplies fall into
German hands.
But, Mr. Hoover and his support
ers point out, that will not happen.
The food will not fall into the hands
of the Nazis because we will set up
a neutral board which will see that
only women and children are sup
plied, and as soon as any infringe
ments are reported, the food ship
ments will cease.

should this ideal arrange
ment be effected, there are still
objections to the plan which we
will deal with later. But first, let
us see how practicable such an or
ganization would be.
The following excerpt is from an
article which appeared recently in
The Nation:
During the first World War
when the problem was to feed
seven or eight million people in
Belgium and northern France there
was reasonably effective control.
That it was not as effective as is
claimed is shown by the following
remark of Princess Bluchcr, the
wife of a high official in the Ger
man foreign Ministry: "I can add
(hat England, without knowing it,
is paying for our dinners, for the
food that we are able to obtain
generally comes from Belgium and
was sent to feed the Belgians."
The following paragraph is from a
recent issue of Time:
Lais Moen, an American chem
ist who was caught in Belgium by
the blitzkrieg, reported in his re
cent book, "Under the Iron Heel,"
that scores of Belgians told him
"perhaps the major share" of food
sent from the U.S. to Belgium dur
ing World War I was diverted to
the Germans.
Up until several weeks ago the
British have been sending food ship
ments to neutral Switzerland. Ger
man pressure, however, was so great
that the British have been forced to
reduce their shipments so that the
food will not fall into the Nazis'
hands.

|Y|R. HOOVER was evidently not
able to control this diversion of
food completely in the last war when
he was dealing with supplies for
only seven or eight million people,
but he claims that it can be done
today with food for 40 million.
How? By setting up a neutral au
thority. Despite the fact that any
plans for feeding Occupied Europe
would have to be rubber-stamped
by Adolf Hitler, Mr. Hoover still
feels that everything would be fair,
square and neutral. Perhaps. But
even if Hitler were to allow the sup
plies to his conquered, you may be
.sure he would not be motivated by
compassion. Herr Hitler is no hu
manitarian.
