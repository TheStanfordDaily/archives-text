### 
NEW YOKK, Oct. 21 (UP).
Wendell L. Wiilkic tonight submitted
to till Republican members of Con
gress a statement of 124 Republican
leaders asserting that the Neutrality
Act "in efTect constitutes aid to Hit
ler" and tailing for its immediate
outright repeal.
In releasing the statement, Wiilkic
described the Roosevelt Administra
tion as "laggard" in not presenting
"a forthright, direct international
policy designed to encompass the
destruction of totalitarianism by
whatever means necessary."
He called attention to the fact that
the statement was signed by several
governors and important Republican
party officials in most of the states.
