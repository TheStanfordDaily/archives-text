As past president of the Associa
tion of American Bacteriologists and
the American Public Health Asso
ciation, Dr. Winslow spoke as an
authority on public health. He ap
plauded the high health standard
that has been reached in our pres
ent army, but stated that the fact
that 40 per cent of our draft-age men
are suffering from physical and emo
tional conditions which keep them
I from the army is an "indication that
j we have fallen down in caring for
our young men.
HEALTH FOR ALL
"Defense has revealed a need for
a permanent health program." Hav
ing improved the health and accident
standard of our defense workers, "do
| we not wonder if this shouldn't be
| done for all workers."
"Can the economic problem, as
exists in Southern states, be per
mitted to continue," Winslow contin
ued, saying that only 22 cents is be
ing spent for every venereal disease
case in Mississippi, while in New
Hampshire the state is spending
I $13.60 for each case.
