# 'Far Off Hills' Opens Week's Run Tonight
## 
### 
"We have good actors, g<Â»od crew
work, good sets, and a good script," !
commented Director Charles Vance,
"so it ought to be a good show." With
this official benediction, the curtain ,
will go up tonight on "The Far Off
Hills," at 8:15 p.m. in the Little
Theater.
The play is the story of Marion |
Clancy, played by Sylvia Berry, a j
handsome and dominating girl of 23 ;
who manages her father, her sisters, j
and the household with an iron i
hand, much to the distress of the two |
sisters, 16 and 17 years old, respec- j
lively.
Marion has expressed the desire !
to enter a convent, but says that, she j
must look after the father, a widow
er whose eyes arc failing him. The :
younger girls, anxious to have a i
little freedom, plot to marry their
father off, but Marion refuses to
leave until the cataracts on Mr.
Clancy's eyes have been removed,
and "until the girls are educated."
HE'S A BIGGER MAN
To the relief of all, father, step
mother, and sisters, Marion finally
meets a character stronger than her
own. Pierce Hegarty first tells her
off, and then wins her with the
promise that, with his help, she can
run the whole town.
"The Far Off Hills" is directed by
Charles Vance, lights are by Walde
mar Johansen, sets by William Gir
van. Lorraine Nicholson, whose
name was omitted from the pro
gram, is assistant director.
PLANS FAIL
Plans to open the dress rehearsal
to the men from Moffett Field fell
through when it developed that
transportation was not available.
"The Division of Speech and Drama
hopes," said secretary Chester A.
Barker, "to invite the service men
to a special performance of one of
our productions later in the season."
"The Far Off Hills" will run Oct.
22 to 27, except Sunday. Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday nights are
completely sold out already, but
some seats are available for tonight
and Monday. Tickets cost 83 cents
and are available in room 202, Me
morial Hall. Season tickets will be
honored at the box office.
