LONDON, Oct. 21 (UP).—The full
force of (he German blitzkrieg—an
estimated 25,000 tanks, 2,000,000
mechanized troops and three-fourths
of the whole German air force have
been beaten off the Moscow ap
proaches for the third straight day,
the Moscow radio reported tonight,
as the fourth month of the Russian
war ended in bedlam on all fronts.
The usual midnight communique
said the battle lines were holding
at Mozhaisk, Maloyaroslavets and
Kalinin, points 65 miles southwest to
100 miles north of Moscow, and that
"the Germans tried to attack our
positions several times, throwing in
fresh forces but our forces repulsed
the attacks."
