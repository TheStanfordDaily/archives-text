# Engineers Plan Winter Radio Defense Class
## Barclay Will Leave Today for M.I.T. To Confer on Course 
### 
A special course in micro-wave
radio transmission sponsored by the
federal government as an aid to na
tional defense will be given to Stan
ford students starting next quarter,
according to a recent announcement
by Prof. F. E. Terman.
Mr. W. J. Barclay, research assist
ant of the Electrical Engineering
School, will leave today for Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology to
confer with instructors of other
schools about the program. The
course, similar to ones about to be
given in 40 schools all over the
country, is designed to reduce a
shortage of technicians skilled in
the subject.
SECRET TRAINING
According to Dr. Terman, those
students completing the course will
be eligible to become officers in the
Army Signal Corps. They may then
receive more thorough Instruction in
secret communications technique.
The course will also be valuable for
students planning to become engi
neers in electrical industries.
Stanford and M.I.T. are the only
two schools that have done exten
sive experimentation in the field of
micro-wave radio waves. The re
sults of Stanford's research will be
passed on to the representatives of
other schools by Professor W. W.
Hansen, on leave from the Physics
Department and now connected with
national defense research at M.1.T.,
who will lecture during the con
ference.
WILL TEACH COURSE
Barclay, who will teach the
courses winter and spring quarters,
has specialized in the subject here
since coming to Stanford on a Cof
fin Research Fellowship. He was
formerly an instructor at Oregon
State College.
The course is sponsored by the
U.S .Office of Education as part of a
nationwide program of technical in
struction. However, this course is
the only one open to college stu
dents at the present time.
