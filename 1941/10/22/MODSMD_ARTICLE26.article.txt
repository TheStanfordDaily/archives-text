# Excom Gingerly Inspects Evils of Election System, Fails to Reach Solution
## McNeil Named Chairman of Farm Defense Committee; Report Made On S.C. Game Train Regulations 
### BUD AMES 
General, extremely general, discussion of Stanford's election system
and the "obvious evils of the caucus system" was pushed gingerly around
the tahle at last night's Exeom meeting to the tune of "The Morry-go
round Broke Down."
Tactfully silent and obviously not quite certain of the electoral ground

they trod, Ex Committee members
each offered his or her caucus cor
rective which invariably turned to
dust, at the touch of inspection.
Only conclusion reached by ad
journment time was the truism that
"it's going to be a pretty tough
problem to get rid of caucuses and
smoke-filled rooms."
Finally discussion was tabled for
further investigation by Exconi's
election sub-committee of Ralph
Clark, Nancy Burkett, and Till
Denton which will reopen rantings
at a later meeting.
S.C. TRAIN
Proceeding minutes were cram
med with administrative details,
laughter-lightened somewhat by
Irma Jean Hannibal's report on the
S.C. Game Train.
"There will be five lounge ears
between the men's and women's
section," she chortled. "And there
will be two policemen stationed at
the door of the women's section."
"For safety's sake, I think one
should be at the door to the men's
section," quipped Stan Owen.
In a swing to the serious, Exeom
next approved Bob McNeil to chair
man Stanford's Defense Committee
"since he has been the most acitve
in laying the groundwork for the
committee."
Minor sports awards were ap
proved to William Dirker, Ben
Snurc, Ryerson Gates, and Robert
Merchant; and Ralph Hill, Robert
Merchant. Lewis Ciannelli, and
George May hew were made man
agers of the polo team.
LOST AND FOUND
Visitors at the meeting were rep
resentatives of the Co-op Lost and
Found department, who made urg
ent pleas for assistance in their work
which Chairman George Jackson
! aptly termed "dry and purely ad
! ministrative."
"The Lost and Found has turned
out to be a dead-weight," the
spokesman said. "We could use
help if we hope to be of real as
sistance to the University. We urg
ently need a more rapid means of
collection of the lost articles from
the many university departments."
ADMINISTRATION PROBLEM
Since N.Y.A. assistance can not bp
procured, Exeom proposed that the
Administration accept the responsi
bility of operating Stanford's lost
and found problem, and that they
set up a centralized agency to handle
this problem.
Another appointment followed;
George Tolman as student-at -large
for the Drives Committee. Mention
was made that Axe Society will re
port at the next meeting whether or
not they plan to continue their ex
istence, and that student guides will
assist in the Boy Scout convention
to be held here in November. All
Exeom members knew the scout
sign.
Climaxing with more mundane
subjects, Exeom moved, on their
stomachs, through plans for their
dinner to be held with the Univer
sity of California Exeom at the Ber
keley Tri-Delt house tonight.
Following the dinner Exeom mem -
bers will attend one of the famed
"far into the night" sessions of the
Cal Ex Committee.

Theta Xi Formal cancelled from
Oct. 25.
General, extremely general, discussion of Stanford's election system
and the "obvious evils of the caucus system" was pushed gingerly around
the tahle at last night's Exeom meeting to the tune of "The Morry-go
round Broke Down."
Tactfully silent and obviously not quite certain of the electoral ground

they trod, Ex Committee members
each offered his or her caucus cor
rective which invariably turned to
dust, at the touch of inspection.
Only conclusion reached by ad
journment time was the truism that
"it's going to be a pretty tough
problem to get rid of caucuses and
smoke-filled rooms."
Finally discussion was tabled for
further investigation by Exconi's
election sub-committee of Ralph
Clark, Nancy Burkett, and Till
Denton which will reopen rantings
at a later meeting.
S.C. TRAIN
Proceeding minutes were cram
med with administrative details,
laughter-lightened somewhat by
Irma Jean Hannibal's report on the
S.C. Game Train.
"There will be five lounge ears
between the men's and women's
section," she chortled. "And there
will be two policemen stationed at
the door of the women's section."
"For safety's sake, I think one
should be at the door to the men's
section," quipped Stan Owen.
In a swing to the serious, Exeom
next approved Bob McNeil to chair
man Stanford's Defense Committee
"since he has been the most acitve
in laying the groundwork for the
committee."
Minor sports awards were ap
proved to William Dirker, Ben
Snurc, Ryerson Gates, and Robert
Merchant; and Ralph Hill, Robert
Merchant. Lewis Ciannelli, and
George May hew were made man
agers of the polo team.
LOST AND FOUND
Visitors at the meeting were rep
resentatives of the Co-op Lost and
Found department, who made urg
ent pleas for assistance in their work
which Chairman George Jackson
! aptly termed "dry and purely ad
! ministrative."
"The Lost and Found has turned
out to be a dead-weight," the
spokesman said. "We could use
help if we hope to be of real as
sistance to the University. We urg
ently need a more rapid means of
collection of the lost articles from
the many university departments."
ADMINISTRATION PROBLEM
Since N.Y.A. assistance can not bp
procured, Exeom proposed that the
Administration accept the responsi
bility of operating Stanford's lost
and found problem, and that they
set up a centralized agency to handle
this problem.
Another appointment followed;
George Tolman as student-at -large
for the Drives Committee. Mention
was made that Axe Society will re
port at the next meeting whether or
not they plan to continue their ex
istence, and that student guides will
assist in the Boy Scout convention
to be held here in November. All
Exeom members knew the scout
sign.
Climaxing with more mundane
subjects, Exeom moved, on their
stomachs, through plans for their
dinner to be held with the Univer
sity of California Exeom at the Ber
keley Tri-Delt house tonight.
Following the dinner Exeom mem -
bers will attend one of the famed
"far into the night" sessions of the
