# GERMANS GAIN DONETS' HEART
## 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 21 (UP). â€” Ger
many's eastern blitzkrieg has over
run Setalino and Dagoe Island,
thereby carving the heart out of the
Donets Basin and completing the
conquest of the Baltic area, but has
slowed down before the gates of
Moscow, the Nazis reported tonight.
The Germans claimed that Soviet
power had been crushed at both
ends of the battle line and only at
Moscow had success eluded the
Nazis.
The high command announced
that German and Italian mountain
chasseurs had taken the Stalino nu
cleus of Donets industry, one of the
Soviet Union's main workshops, and
spokesmen said the remainder of
the basin would be in Axis hands in
a few days.
