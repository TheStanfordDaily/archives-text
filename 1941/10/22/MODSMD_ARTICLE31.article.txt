# Frosh to Argue Labor Question
## 
### 
Two freshman debate teams of
four men each will meet tomorrow
at 7; 15 p.m. in the Memorial Hall
offices of Coach George Peavy to
debate the question: Resolved: "That
the Federal Government Should
Regulate By Law All Labor Unions."
This will be the first debate of the
year for the freshmen. A varsity
team of Colin McClintock and Alma
Mae Campbell participated in a
round table discussion on "War
Aims" last Sunday in San Fran
cisco with several Bay Area schools.
Purpose of the trial debate, which
is not open to the public, is to give
Coach George Peavy an opportunity
to hear his speakers in action. Later
in the quarter the frosh will meet
several junior colleges in inter-col
legiate competition.
At the last meeting subjects were
suggested for the quarter's discus
sion among which were: Federal
Control of Public Utilities, Military
Alliance with Great Britain, World
Federation of Democracies, Govern
ment Control of Interstate Trade.
Problems of State Government in
California.
Freshman debate at Stanford is
still open to any interested student.
Previous experience is not necessary.
No definite teams will be appointed
from squad personnel, but teams to
debate on various occasions will be
| picked from the squad to debate as
! these occasions arise.
