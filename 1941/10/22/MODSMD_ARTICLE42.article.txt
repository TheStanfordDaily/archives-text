# Meiners O.K. For Huskies On Saturday
## 
### 
When the varsity football team
leaves for Se;rttle tomorrow after
noon, Pete Kmetovic. Aruie Meiners.
Hank Norberg, and Ray Durham
will be with them, reudy to go
against the Washington Huskies Sat
urday in the game which will go a
long way toward deciding the con
ference champion and Pose Bowl
contender.
Meiners got an okay from a San
Francisco specialist yesterday, and
was out in practice fully suited.
Jack Francis, who was moved to the
left end position when both Meiners
and Norberg were out, has moved
back to right guard. Meiners hasn't
been out for practice in ten days so
he will take a little conditioning.
Durham was back in suit today
after receiving a knock on the head
in the U.S.F. game which was ex- |
pected to keep him out of action for j
several weeks. Durham worked out j
with the third team on defense :
against the "blacks." The latter [
team was running th£ Husky plays J
as seen by Marchie Schwartz who |
has seen all four of the Washington J
games this season.
FRANKIE—AS USUAL
Frankie Albert quarterbacked the j
first team with Kmetovic, F.rie Ann- j
strong, Milt Vucinich, and Willard J
Sheller running the ball. Drills so j
far this week indicate that Shaugh
nessy will use a powerful running I
attack against his northern oppo- j
nents Saturday.
Heading the second team was A1 j
Cole in his second day as signal |
caller. Scooter worked with Bob
Crane, Bob Mitchell, and Buck ,
Fawcett in a manner that appeared j
to give a ray of light to next year's
gray football picture.
:SX TO MAKE TRIP
Approximately 38 men will leave j
Palo Alto at 3 p.m. Thursday, in- |
stead of Wednesday as was an- |
nounced earlier. The team will get
into Seattle Friday night. Only
members of the squad who will not
be able to play this week-end are
Ray Hammett, Albert's first replace- j
ment, who chipped a bone in his leg j
last Saturday; halfback Jack Bark- ;
ley, who has been out for several
weeks, and Frank Forbes, soph back
whose wrenched knee may keep
him out of football permanently.
Watching the afternoon's session
was a group of female reporters
from a local high school news-writ
ing class. They interviewed several
of the players, and added a note of
cheer to the proceedings.

Approximately 38 men will leave j
Palo Alto at 3 p.m. Thursday, in- |
stead of Wednesday as was an- |
nounced earlier. The team will get
into Seattle Friday night. Only
members of the squad who will not
be able to play this week-end are
Ray Hammett, Albert's first replace- j
ment, who chipped a bone in his leg j
last Saturday; halfback Jack Bark- ;
ley, who has been out for several
weeks, and Frank Forbes, soph back
whose wrenched knee may keep
him out of football permanently.
Watching the afternoon's session
was a group of female reporters
from a local high school news-writ
ing class. They interviewed several
of the players, and added a note of
cheer to the proceedings.
When the varsity football team
leaves for Se;rttle tomorrow after
noon, Pete Kmetovic. Aruie Meiners.
Hank Norberg, and Ray Durham
will be with them, reudy to go
against the Washington Huskies Sat
urday in the game which will go a
long way toward deciding the con
ference champion and Pose Bowl
contender.
Meiners got an okay from a San
Francisco specialist yesterday, and
was out in practice fully suited.
Jack Francis, who was moved to the
left end position when both Meiners
and Norberg were out, has moved
back to right guard. Meiners hasn't
been out for practice in ten days so
he will take a little conditioning.
Durham was back in suit today
after receiving a knock on the head
in the U.S.F. game which was ex- |
pected to keep him out of action for j
several weeks. Durham worked out j
with the third team on defense :
against the "blacks." The latter [
team was running th£ Husky plays J
as seen by Marchie Schwartz who |
has seen all four of the Washington J
games this season.
FRANKIE—AS USUAL
Frankie Albert quarterbacked the j
first team with Kmetovic, F.rie Ann- j
strong, Milt Vucinich, and Willard J
Sheller running the ball. Drills so j
far this week indicate that Shaugh
nessy will use a powerful running I
attack against his northern oppo- j
nents Saturday.
Heading the second team was A1 j
Cole in his second day as signal |
caller. Scooter worked with Bob
Crane, Bob Mitchell, and Buck ,
Fawcett in a manner that appeared j
to give a ray of light to next year's
gray football picture.
