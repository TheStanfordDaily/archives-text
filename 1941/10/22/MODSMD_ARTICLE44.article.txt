# Firemen Wreck Alpha Sigs 35-0
## 
### 
Seven gentlemen from the Fire
house gathered on intramural grid
field yesterday afternoon and among
other things demonstrated (1) that
they are definitely the champions of
the circuit still, (2) that they are
55 points better than Alpha Sigma
Phi, and (3) that the ground can
still be used to run on instead of
to pass over.
Firehouse introduced hard, clean
blocks that reduced the opposition
to the status of spectators and al
lowed b'laze-chasing back Monte
Pfyl to collect five touchdowns. Wy
land Cripe followed by scoring two
goals, and Bill Berryessa blocked a
kick to bring the other. Five con
versions and a safety were added to
make the final count Firehouse 55,
Alpha Sigs 0.
Kappa Sigma kept in the unbeaten
ranks' with a 20 to 0 defeat of Phi
Delta Theta. Frank Wells tossed
two of the touchdown passes, and
Jack Harris flipped one. Conver
sions added two points.
DELTS TRIUMPH
Delta Tau Delta remained in a
tie fpr the lead in League No. 4 with
the Kappa Sigs by defeating El
Capitan 20 to 7. Bill Boyer and
Bob Kennedy supervised the activ
ity, Boyer passing for two of the
scores and beginning a lateral which
via Ray Chapot. Kennery, and Ward
Walkup brought a 50-yard goal-line
march. Two conversions came on
passes. Bill Cameron passed to Don
Gabriel lor the Capitan marker.
Chi Psi passed over Delta Upsilon,
12 to 0. back Joe McHarg throwing
to Jack Jensen for both touchdowns.
Business School's Bill Tweedie
passed to Frank Dowling and Jack
Farley for two scores, and John
Emanuel took another pass to score
the touchdowns in the business
men's 21 to 0 defeat of luckless The
ta Xi.
TIIETA DELTS WIN
Theta Delta Chi had little trouble
in subduing Los Arcos 18 to 0.
Two end runs by Tom Boyle and a
50-yard romp by Ross Hughes did
the damage.
