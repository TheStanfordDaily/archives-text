### H.D. THOREAU Assistant Sports Editor 
lIMMY PI 1 EI,AN is the head football coach at the U. of Washington.
If Jimmy Phelan can decipher (lie October 25. 1!)41. edition of the
I Shaughnessy T formation attack, he is a smart man. Knute Kockne called
: liim "one of the smartest and gamcst quarterbacks in Noire Dame football
history." He'd have to he smart to keep ahead of the I . ol Washington

alumni wolves for 12 years. 4
Last year Jimmy Phelan was
smart too. He was too smart for |
Stanford for over half of the game,
but within a few plays the T wised
up for three touchdowns to outsmart
the Huskies 20 to 10.
Although Phelan is getting no less
smart fast, Clark Shaughnessy, who
is head football coach at Stanford U.,
seems to be getting wiser by leaps
and bounds also, and that's saying
something considering his w.q. (win
ning quotient) last year. In less than
three hours' time up at Corvallis two
weeks ago, Shaughnessy learned
enough to fill what's left of a vol- i
ume after I get through discussing !
football, which is considerable.
This week Shaughnessy's intelli
gence, plus the physical fitness of
Pete Kmetovic, plus the new found
talent both Willard Sheller and
Milt Vucinich have for playing half
| back, plus the practice in the rain,
I plus the copious notes Marchie
Schwartz has taken in his three or
four views of the Huskies, seem to
add up to a dimming to Phelan's in- I
tellectual light. And I'm not passing
the buck to Luck Louie, either.

| JTUGH GALLARNEAU played
quite a bit of right halfback for
Stanford last year and several years
immediately preceding. Hugh is now
playing quite a bit of right half
back for the Chicago Bears, a pro
fessional football squad which has
been pushing its opponents right
out of their stadiums for the past 14
months, both opened ends and closed
ends.
Last year the Bears had all
kinds of good halfbacks. Maniaei,
i McAfee, McLean, Swisher, Sny
, der, Eamiglietti or something, and
j other assorted men of note. Gal
| larneau is playing first-string this
j year, not because these boys have
slipped, but because four years at
J Stanford made him a real good
football player.
A slight example of his prowess is
shown in the fact that his No. 1 sub
stitute George McAfee, the former
scourge of the North Carolina to
bacco plantations while an under
graduate at Duke, has an average
kickoff return over the first three
games this year of over 40 yards per
crack.
Another story of the small college
boy who makes good with the big
pro team, has Norm Standlee as the
hero. Although Norm is only the
second string fullback for the Bears,
his superior is Bill Osmanski, a vet
eran bone crusher from Holy Cross,
who seems to be a medium sized
Bronko Nagurski.
Speaking of Nagurski, I'd like to
see the remains of any man or beast
j who ever attempted to Konko
Bronko.

In Midwestern football circles,

to Billy Hillebrand of Indiana.
lIMMY PI 1 EI,AN is the head football coach at the U. of Washington.
If Jimmy Phelan can decipher (lie October 25. 1!)41. edition of the
I Shaughnessy T formation attack, he is a smart man. Knute Kockne called
: liim "one of the smartest and gamcst quarterbacks in Noire Dame football
history." He'd have to he smart to keep ahead of the I . ol Washington

alumni wolves for 12 years. 4
Last year Jimmy Phelan was
smart too. He was too smart for |
Stanford for over half of the game,
but within a few plays the T wised
up for three touchdowns to outsmart
the Huskies 20 to 10.
Although Phelan is getting no less
smart fast, Clark Shaughnessy, who
is head football coach at Stanford U.,
seems to be getting wiser by leaps
and bounds also, and that's saying
something considering his w.q. (win
ning quotient) last year. In less than
three hours' time up at Corvallis two
weeks ago, Shaughnessy learned
enough to fill what's left of a vol- i
ume after I get through discussing !
football, which is considerable.
This week Shaughnessy's intelli
gence, plus the physical fitness of
Pete Kmetovic, plus the new found
talent both Willard Sheller and
Milt Vucinich have for playing half
| back, plus the practice in the rain,
I plus the copious notes Marchie
Schwartz has taken in his three or
four views of the Huskies, seem to
add up to a dimming to Phelan's in- I
tellectual light. And I'm not passing
the buck to Luck Louie, either.

| JTUGH GALLARNEAU played
quite a bit of right halfback for
Stanford last year and several years
immediately preceding. Hugh is now
playing quite a bit of right half
back for the Chicago Bears, a pro
fessional football squad which has
been pushing its opponents right
out of their stadiums for the past 14
months, both opened ends and closed
ends.
Last year the Bears had all
kinds of good halfbacks. Maniaei,
i McAfee, McLean, Swisher, Sny
, der, Eamiglietti or something, and
j other assorted men of note. Gal
| larneau is playing first-string this
j year, not because these boys have
slipped, but because four years at
J Stanford made him a real good
football player.
A slight example of his prowess is
shown in the fact that his No. 1 sub
stitute George McAfee, the former
scourge of the North Carolina to
bacco plantations while an under
graduate at Duke, has an average
kickoff return over the first three
games this year of over 40 yards per
crack.
Another story of the small college
boy who makes good with the big
pro team, has Norm Standlee as the
hero. Although Norm is only the
second string fullback for the Bears,
his superior is Bill Osmanski, a vet
eran bone crusher from Holy Cross,
who seems to be a medium sized
Bronko Nagurski.
Speaking of Nagurski, I'd like to
see the remains of any man or beast
j who ever attempted to Konko
Bronko.
