# War with Japan?
## 
### 
WILL Japan and the United States go to war?
This question is in the mind and on the
lips of America. Probably no one knows the
answer. The situation is made crucial by the
ascension of the new militaristic army govern
ment of Premier General Tojo. These leaders
seek co-operation with the Axis, although they
are continuing negotiations with the United
States and today (Wednesday) offered media
tion in the European war.
What their decision will be and how their
action will affect the United States is uncertain;
but there are statistical reasons why Japan
should not and, perhaps, may not initiate war
with the United States.
These figures are the basis of an excellent
analysis of the Japanese-U.S. situation by Alex
ander H. Williams in The Christian Science Mon
itor. We quote excerpts:
There is a hope that "the proverbial ability
of the Japanese to consider personal problems
objectively will influence even the militarists
. . . to stop short of war. The hope is grounded
on more than one obvious fact. Among these
are (1) Japan's best interests are with the Pow
ers who stand for liberal trade throughout the
world; namely, the United States and Britain;
(2) that in repudiating their non-aggression pact
with Russia and attempting to halt American aid
to the Soviet Union through the port of Vladi
vostok, a 'shooting war' between the United
States and Japan would certainly result; (3) that
war between the United States and Japan would
serve the worst interests of the two Powers.
"Emphasizing what war between the United
States and Japan would mean to trade, it is
recalled that the Japanese bought $227,203,794
worth of goods from the United States in 1940,
as compared with $231,418,000 in 1939, and sold
exports to the United States to the value of
5158,376,321, as compared with $161,095,000
the previous year.
"It takes no mathematician to figure out in
the face of these totals what war would mean
to United States-Japanese economy.
"The question asked ... is whether the Japa
nese militarists will see it and consider the tre
mendous burden of taxation the Japanese people
are now carrying and the difficulties Japan faces
as the war in China drags on despite Nipponese
peace bids.
"On this internal and external situation the
hope for peace between the democratic Powers
and Japan finds a grounding too, on a realization
in Tokyo that compliance with Reichsfiihrer Hit
ler's urgings for Japan to take the field in the
Russian maritime provinces would merely be
trying to pull the Nazi chestnuts out of the fire.
If the operation were successful, Japan would be
acquiring a neighbor more dangerous to its
political and economic orders than is Russia.
"If Japan wants to prosper, the trade route is
its best avenue, according to the consensus here.
This is all the United States and Britain want—
John Hays' Open Door."

WILL Japan and the United States go to war?
This question is in the mind and on the
lips of America. Probably no one knows the
answer. The situation is made crucial by the
ascension of the new militaristic army govern
ment of Premier General Tojo. These leaders
seek co-operation with the Axis, although they
are continuing negotiations with the United
States and today (Wednesday) offered media
tion in the European war.
What their decision will be and how their
action will affect the United States is uncertain;
but there are statistical reasons why Japan
should not and, perhaps, may not initiate war
with the United States.
These figures are the basis of an excellent
analysis of the Japanese-U.S. situation by Alex
ander H. Williams in The Christian Science Mon
itor. We quote excerpts:
There is a hope that "the proverbial ability
of the Japanese to consider personal problems
objectively will influence even the militarists
. . . to stop short of war. The hope is grounded
on more than one obvious fact. Among these
are (1) Japan's best interests are with the Pow
ers who stand for liberal trade throughout the
world; namely, the United States and Britain;
(2) that in repudiating their non-aggression pact
with Russia and attempting to halt American aid
to the Soviet Union through the port of Vladi
vostok, a 'shooting war' between the United
States and Japan would certainly result; (3) that
war between the United States and Japan would
serve the worst interests of the two Powers.
"Emphasizing what war between the United
States and Japan would mean to trade, it is
recalled that the Japanese bought $227,203,794
worth of goods from the United States in 1940,
as compared with $231,418,000 in 1939, and sold
exports to the United States to the value of
5158,376,321, as compared with $161,095,000
the previous year.
"It takes no mathematician to figure out in
the face of these totals what war would mean
to United States-Japanese economy.
"The question asked ... is whether the Japa
nese militarists will see it and consider the tre
mendous burden of taxation the Japanese people
are now carrying and the difficulties Japan faces
as the war in China drags on despite Nipponese
peace bids.
"On this internal and external situation the
hope for peace between the democratic Powers
