# How It Ticks
## 
### 
DURING recent years, Stanford has each
spring held a leadership institute â€”a kind
of large round-table meeting at which all in
coming and outgoing student leaders discussed
their little problems.
Leadership Institute was not held last spring
as it was felt the good derived was not worth
the effort. It was abandoned in favor of some
sort of forum to be held this fall.
Nobody had much of an idea what this forum
would be like, but just naturally felt it would
be "a good thing."
Now this "thing" has taken solid form and will
be held a week from this evening in the Edu
cation Auditorium.
An interesting and informative panel of five
minute speakers has been lined up. They will
give the low-down on organizations and activi
ties around Stanford. Most of their information
will be new to approximately 80 per cent of
Farm students.
And they have thrown in a little good enter
tainment too.
Drop around to the Activities Forum with the
rest of us who want to know what makes every
thing tick around here. It's not just for those
actively engaged in activities; it's for all who
would like to gain a little more from Stanford
than what they can get in the Library.
