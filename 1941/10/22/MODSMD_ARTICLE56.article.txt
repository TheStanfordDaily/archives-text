### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
A MESSAGE FROM 088
| AST night I received my latest communication from
u my agent in Moscow. My boy is named Obb and
he sits on the Red Square selling pencils and in be
tween sales he looks around the city and gathers in
formation for me. This is the first message that I
have gotten for over a month, and it is unusual be
cause Obb usually sends a little news every week.
I was beginning to think that the pencil business was
tremendously good, and that Obb just didn't have time
for messages and information and such, but here is
what he says, translated for you from our code.
"Boss, sorry that I haven't mailed the message
sooner but I have really been busy. My pencil
business was fulling oIT terribly, it seemed that no
one was writing letters any more, so I introduced
the chain letter idea over here to stimulate the
pencil sales. The chain letter business was so good
I cleaned up fifty kopecs and a couple rubles in
two weeks. But since the Germans have invaded
Russia, people have stopped corresponding, and I
get all my Vodka money from the pencils again.
So you see, boss, I'm not doing so well. Everything
is ruined and I'm getting tired of being "My Boy
Obb, Staff Observer and Analyst of Red Square
and Immediate Vicinity." I want some money or
I'm coming home."

r JpiIEN there's a little part here about a peasant girl
who canie to buy a pencil.
"As for the war, things arc of course going
badly. All the smart people and the diplomats
have already left the city. The other night there
was a call for a People's army, and a bunch of
Red officers saw me sitting at the place where you
told me to sit. They said that if I didn't hold a gun,
I couldn't sell pencils there any more. So now
I've got a gun.
"The people arc all confident that the city can
be held. They all listen to the speeches that Roose
velt and Churchill make, and they're expecting a
whole load of troops from both countries, any
day now. They know that Roosevelt won't forget
them. They remember that it was Roosevelt who
recognized thcin, and they have a secret little feel
ing that Roosevelt is a communist."
Then there is a little part here about a peasant girl
who came to buy a pencil.
"But still the Germans are getting plenty close.
At night when I sleep I can hear their big guns
blasting away at the Russians. The other evening
I put my gun and my pencils down and went to
sleep, and in the morning there was a big, blue G
painted in the middle of the Square. Everyone got
real mad and excited, and no one knew what to do
about it. I suggested that they paint it over with
red paint. They painted it and the Square is as
red as ever and I've got a little medal. The Rus
sian leaders are thinking of signing a pact or some
thing forbidding such practices.
"That's about all there is. Please send me a
couple hundred more pencils, the ones with the
erasers. And also some money or I won't send you
any stories about the Germans when they come
through. Write me,
"Obb, Box 264, Red Square, Russia."
There is also a post script but it's all about a
peasant girl who came to buy a pencil. 1 don't like
Obb's attitude any more. He's getting a little insolent.
I think I'll switch him with my boy Gath, my agent
at Berchtesgaden. The pencil business is really bad at
the Gaden and that will teach Obb to have more
respect for His Boss.

thing forbidding such practices.
"That's about all there is. Please send me a
couple hundred more pencils, the ones with the
erasers. And also some money or I won't send you
any stories about the Germans when they come
through. Write me,
"Obb, Box 264, Red Square, Russia."
There is also a post script but it's all about a
peasant girl who came to buy a pencil. 1 don't like
Obb's attitude any more. He's getting a little insolent.
I think I'll switch him with my boy Gath, my agent

the Gaden and that will teach Obb to have more
respect for His Boss.
A MESSAGE FROM 088
| AST night I received my latest communication from
u my agent in Moscow. My boy is named Obb and
he sits on the Red Square selling pencils and in be
tween sales he looks around the city and gathers in
formation for me. This is the first message that I
have gotten for over a month, and it is unusual be
cause Obb usually sends a little news every week.
I was beginning to think that the pencil business was
tremendously good, and that Obb just didn't have time
for messages and information and such, but here is
what he says, translated for you from our code.
"Boss, sorry that I haven't mailed the message
sooner but I have really been busy. My pencil
business was fulling oIT terribly, it seemed that no
one was writing letters any more, so I introduced
the chain letter idea over here to stimulate the
pencil sales. The chain letter business was so good
I cleaned up fifty kopecs and a couple rubles in
two weeks. But since the Germans have invaded
Russia, people have stopped corresponding, and I
get all my Vodka money from the pencils again.
So you see, boss, I'm not doing so well. Everything
is ruined and I'm getting tired of being "My Boy
Obb, Staff Observer and Analyst of Red Square
and Immediate Vicinity." I want some money or
I'm coming home."
* * + *
r JpiIEN there's a little part here about a peasant girl
who canie to buy a pencil.
"As for the war, things arc of course going
badly. All the smart people and the diplomats
have already left the city. The other night there
was a call for a People's army, and a bunch of
Red officers saw me sitting at the place where you
told me to sit. They said that if I didn't hold a gun,
I couldn't sell pencils there any more. So now
I've got a gun.
"The people arc all confident that the city can
be held. They all listen to the speeches that Roose
velt and Churchill make, and they're expecting a
whole load of troops from both countries, any
day now. They know that Roosevelt won't forget
them. They remember that it was Roosevelt who
recognized thcin, and they have a secret little feel
ing that Roosevelt is a communist."
Then there is a little part here about a peasant girl
who came to buy a pencil.
"But still the Germans are getting plenty close.
At night when I sleep I can hear their big guns
blasting away at the Russians. The other evening
I put my gun and my pencils down and went to
sleep, and in the morning there was a big, blue G
painted in the middle of the Square. Everyone got
real mad and excited, and no one knew what to do
about it. I suggested that they paint it over with

whole load of troops from both countries, any
day now. They know that Roosevelt won't forget
them. They remember that it was Roosevelt who
recognized thcin, and they have a secret little feel
ing that Roosevelt is a communist."
Then there is a little part here about a peasant girl
who came to buy a pencil.
"But still the Germans are getting plenty close.
At night when I sleep I can hear their big guns
blasting away at the Russians. The other evening
I put my gun and my pencils down and went to
sleep, and in the morning there was a big, blue G
painted in the middle of the Square. Everyone got
real mad and excited, and no one knew what to do
about it. I suggested that they paint it over with
red paint. They painted it and the Square is as
red as ever and I've got a little medal. The Rus
sian leaders are thinking of signing a pact or some
thing forbidding such practices.
"That's about all there is. Please send me a
couple hundred more pencils, the ones with the
erasers. And also some money or I won't send you
any stories about the Germans when they come
through. Write me,
"Obb, Box 264, Red Square, Russia."
There is also a post script but it's all about a
peasant girl who came to buy a pencil. 1 don't like
Obb's attitude any more. He's getting a little insolent.
I think I'll switch him with my boy Gath, my agent
at Berchtesgaden. The pencil business is really bad at
the Gaden and that will teach Obb to have more
respect for His Boss.
