lIOW ABOUT TIIIS, AMIE?

r jTHE EDITOR, SIR:
"Amie" of your History 1941 column has written
some pretty shrewd comment, but when she under
took to attack Herbert Hoover's last radio appeal to
Americans to save the starving children of Europe, she
displayed about an eighth grader's intelligence. Her
paragraph asking:
"What guarantee will there he that the Nazi
storm troopers will not seize the food and supplies
sent to the occupied countries for themselves 01*
for their people? Obviously there can be none,
there is none that can he depended upon,"
shows that she missed one of Mr. Hoover's cardinal
points in which he stated that even the British officials
admitted that the food which they sending to
Germany to feed 40,000 British prisoners "is distributed
with fidelity." Another point she missed in Mr. Hoo
ver's radio address is this one: "Every child or its
mother who receives food must come to the soup
kitchen and eat it on the spot." The food warehouses
proposed are to be under neutral control, with neutral
supervisors who will report immediately any violation
of the agreement by the Nazis.
Amie, —it would be a very good thing for you to
miss all your meals for about a week, so that you
could feel what it is like to be hungry. Perhaps you
are even so fortunate that you were not trimmed down
to meat once in ten days, with an etemality of beans,
spaghetti and oleo, as was this writer's family in the
depression years. (Yes, we had two university degrees
in the family, too!)

Or, perhaps it would help convince you that saving
millions of starving children is really worth a little
effort and brain work if you would observe in the
Hoover Library exhibit room, at right of entrance, the
volumes of thanks of Polish, Czecho-Slovak, Austrian
and Belgian mothers for the lives of their children
saved from starvation twenty-five years ago by this
same Hoover whose "ideals are a pathetic anachronism."
History will not confirm your judgment.
You have the true Soviet complex,—wholesale fam
ine when necessary to make the five-year plan work
in Russia, 1934; now starvation for French, Greek, Bel
gian and Polish children so that Britain may come
out on top. And when you speak of ours as "a world
where might makes right, where force rides rough
shod over reason," you're not talking about America,
nor reflecting the spirit of an American University.

Your closing sentence is a sky-rocket: "Mr. Hoo
ver's philanthropy is a luxury we cannot afford. At
least not right now." Apparently we can afford to
send $40,000.00 or more nearly every month to Brit
ain, as aid from only a part of one state (contribution
from the British War Relief Association of Northern
California, see their last report for confirmation) in
addition to many more thousands monthly from other
groups organized for British aid, and thousands of dol
lars in aid of hungry Chinese children.
Your chatter about a "tremendous psychological
and practical advantage for the Allies in the starvation
of the continent" leaves me cold. Remember, Hoover's
plan is to feed children mainly from one to three, not
adults.
Just so that we may part friends, I'll agree with this
statement of yours: "This is not our war; it is Hen-
Hitler's. We are not making the rules." That's just
America's weak point: the nation that is furnishing
the billions for the lease-lend gestures, the bombers,
and the food for much of Britain OUGHT to be mak
ing the rules. Stanford. '42
