"Low Man on a Totem Pole," by 11. Allen Smith, with an introduction
by Fred Allen.
Fred Allen in his introduction to (lie book describes the author thus:
"There isn't enough meat on him to glut a baby buzzard." This leads one

a feature writer for United Press is<
not a physical activity, then you 1
should read this book. You should j
read this book, anyway.
In its three hundred pages Mr. j
Smith records his experiences in in

sonalities."
PURE STORY TELLER

shows that he upholds the theoiy of
pure story telling. He says nothing
that his interviewee could not say
better.
He runs into a newspaper man
who is under the delusion that Her
bert Hoover has bladders on his feet;
Joe E. Brown who asked for at j
least one interview that did not
mention his mouth; and Gypsy
Rose Lee, who is Gypsy Rose Lee.
ADVICE ON DIETRICH
To those who aspire to become
feature writers someday, or to any
one who might be confronted with
the problem of interviewing a fa
mous person, Mr. Smith gives some
valuable tips. The outstanding ex
ample of this art is given in the
opening chapters of the book when
the author tells of an assignment to
see and get a story about Marlene
Dietrich.
When Mr. Smith arrived at her
apartment in the Waldorf-Astoria he
was completely swept off his feet
upon her appearance. He was at a
loss for words to start the inter
view. After a few awkward mo
ments he took hold of himself and
made a bold attempt to bring the
situation "down to earth." They sat
down and he asked:
"Miss Dietrich, what would you
say if I asked you to pull up your
dress and let me see your legs?"
She did not bat an eye.
"Why don't you ask me?" she said.
"Ail right," said the author. "Pull
up your dress and let me sec your
legs."
"No."
Mr. Smith did not see the legs, but
he had broken the ice for some "un
conventional questioning."—Oglesby

ADVICE ON DIETRICH
To those who aspire to become
feature writers someday, or to any
one who might be confronted with
the problem of interviewing a fa
mous person, Mr. Smith gives some
valuable tips. The outstanding ex
ample of this art is given in the
opening chapters of the book when
the author tells of an assignment to
see and get a story about Marlene
Dietrich.
When Mr. Smith arrived at her
apartment in the Waldorf-Astoria he
was completely swept off his feet
upon her appearance. He was at a
loss for words to start the inter
view. After a few awkward mo
ments he took hold of himself and
made a bold attempt to bring the
situation "down to earth." They sat
down and he asked:
"Miss Dietrich, what would you
say if I asked you to pull up your
dress and let me see your legs?"
She did not bat an eye.
"Why don't you ask me?" she said.
"Ail right," said the author. "Pull
up your dress and let me sec your
legs."
"No."
Mr. Smith did not see the legs, but
he had broken the ice for some "un
conventional questioning."—Oglesby
"Low Man on a Totem Pole," by 11. Allen Smith, with an introduction
by Fred Allen.
Fred Allen in his introduction to (lie book describes the author thus:
"There isn't enough meat on him to glut a baby buzzard." This leads one
to believe that Mr. Smith is not a very active person, but if you think being

a feature writer for United Press is<
not a physical activity, then you 1
should read this book. You should j
read this book, anyway.
In its three hundred pages Mr. j
Smith records his experiences in in
terviewing everybody from Einstein
to Faith Bacon. The best Way to
give a short description of the book
is to call it a "travelogue in per
sonalities."
PURE STORY TELLER
As to the author's style, his book
shows that he upholds the theoiy of
pure story telling. He says nothing
that his interviewee could not say
better.
He runs into a newspaper man
who is under the delusion that Her
bert Hoover has bladders on his feet;
Joe E. Brown who asked for at j
least one interview that did not
mention his mouth; and Gypsy
Rose Lee, who is Gypsy Rose Lee.
