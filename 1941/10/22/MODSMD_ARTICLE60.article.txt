# AMMUNITION ORDERS
## 
### 
Since the Stanford Rifle Club is j
planning to send in its ammunition j
order to the government, it will be I
necessary to know hew many mem- j
bers will want shells and ammuni- j
tion. Members are requested to !
phone in their orders to Carlos Ascn- -
sio-Wunderlich, in Branner, before I
Friday. A substantial discount may
be obtained by purchasing through
the club.
