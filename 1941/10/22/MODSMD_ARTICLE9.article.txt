# AFL Labor Leader Maintains Strike Record Below Average
## Shishkin Stops Here En Route to Capital From Seattle Meet 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
The tall, smoothly groomed gentle
man took a slow drag from the
mouthpiece of his cigarette holder.
So this was how a high ranking la
bor leader looked!
Boris Shishkin, national econ
omist for the American Federation
of Labor, seated himself for an in
terview during his visit to Stanford
yesterday on his return trip from the
A. F. of L. convention in Seattle to
his home in Washington, D.C.
"The strike record during (he na
tional emergency from 1940 through
the first quarter of 1941 is far be
low the average record, Shishkin
stated. "Most of these strikes have
been pressures for wage adjust
ments. Since the start of defense
production, producer's profits have
increased tremendously but labor's
wages have lagged far behind."
Pulling a sheet of figures out of
his brief case, Shishkin pointed to
a production chart that covered the
years from 1929 to 1940.
OUTPUT INCREASED
"Since 1929, the output of labor
has increased 43 per cent, but labor
cost to the producer has declined
(5.5 per cent. Today that gap be
tween the income of capital and la
bor is splitting wider and wider."
Normal producer's profits average
6 per cent of the total income of the
industry, according to the A. F. of L.
economist. During the first quarter
of 1941, those profits rose to 10 per
cent and can now be estimated at
approximately 14 per cent, in Shish
kin's opinion.
"Those profit figures exclude all
government taxes on industry,"
Shishkin explained. "Actually profit
taxes in the United States are light
compared to those levied in Eng
land."
WAGES STATIC
While wages have failed to in
crease, except in instances of la
bor pressure, the purchasing power
of labor's income is steadily decreas
ing, Shishkin said. Rising prices arc 1
shrinking the value of the dollar.
"So you see labor strikes for fair !
wages do have u factual basis," j
Shishkin asserted. "However the
A. F. of L. tries to follow a policy
of settling employer-labor problems j
by negotiation."
To Westbrook Pegler's charge that
strikes are instigated by an oli
garchy of union officials without
voluntary co-operation lrom union
members, Shishkin gave this an
swer:
"The most conclusive proof I can
offer of the spontaneous nature of
strikes in our defense industries is
the fact that most of them have been
instigated by local unions without
the consent of the national officials.
National union approval has been
granted after the strikes have been
declared in the majority of these
cases."
During his entire conversation,
Shishkin spoke of labor as a homo
geneous body, never once referring
I to the C. I. O. - A. F. of L. split. He
even applied the term "our coal
workers" to the United Mine Work
ers Union of the C. I. O.
Continuing with his broad analysis
of labor's stand in the defense pro
gram, Shishkin said:
"Labor disputes must also be
j judged in the light of today s tre
mendous dislocation of employment
| that accompanies defense produc
j tion. Thousands of men who held
I jobs in consumers goods industries
j are now out of work because those
factories are closed down for lack
of raw materials."
