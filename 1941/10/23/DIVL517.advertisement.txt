On many of lite defense projects encountered by the Hell
System, the work sheets — showing telephone facilities
reeded and time allowed—would make a good, conservative
engineer's hair stand on end.
For example, take the Navy's huge new air base near
Corpus Christi, Texas, which covers 11,500 aeres. includes 29
separate flying fields and 181 buildings. Closely connected
with the base are Defense Housing projects for 1700 families.
Imagine the complex problems involved in planning tele
phone facilities for this new'"city" where formerly there
were sand dunes—in obtaining and installing miles and miles
D O
of wire and cable, switchboards, telephones by the thousand.
But telephone engineers and construction men look bold
—proceeded to shatter records—completed their huge task
in seemingly impossible time. For men with the "will to
do," there's a real thrill in such Bell System work!
