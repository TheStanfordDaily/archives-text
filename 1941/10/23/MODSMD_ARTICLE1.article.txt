### AMIE REICHERT 
IUST for the sake of argument let
us assume that Mr. Hoover's plan
to feed Occupied Europe goes
through.
We will have to do a heap of as
suming: that the Eritish relax their
blockade; that Mr. Hoover finds a
"neutral" authority; (that there is
such a thing as a neutral state to
day); that Herr Hitler allows the
food to be sent in and adheres to
the provisions: namely food only for
women and children.
Granted all this might be done,
what then? The New Republic has
this to say on the subject:
It is hard to sec how help can he
given the peoples of the subjugated
countries in such a way that it
does not aid Germany. Any food
that comes from the outside re
leases food to he used for other
pu rposcs.
This, then, would be the motive
behind Hitler's acquiescence to Hoo
ver's plan. A study made last year
by the U.S. Department of Agri
culture showed that there was
enough food in Europe (i.e., German
control) to prevent famine. In fact,
Walter Darre, Nazi secretary of ag
riculture, has boasted that the Ger
mans have enough food to feed all
Europe and still wage war indefi
nitely.
* sjt $
,j ut —Joe Goebbels and his propa
ganda stooges have in recent
months taken up the cry that Ger
many cannot feed these people; that
Britain and the U.S. can and must
feed them.
The strategy behind this is ob
vious in the light of recent foocf
statistics from Europe. The Nazis
have conserved and swollen a tre
mendous Food Pool to see them
through this war. They cannot let
Occupied Europe starve complete
ly for several important strategic
reasons:
There is the danger of revolt; they
have geared the industries of Occu
pied Europe to their war machine
and must keep up the working
capacity of their slaves; there is the
dread of plague and pestilence which
might sweep from the famine-rid
den countries to the very heart of
Germany.
For these reasons, the Nazis
know that Occupied Europe must
be fed. But they would like it
much better if Britain and the
U.S. did the feeding. Then they
could continue to conserve all
their food; continue to manufac
ture ersatz explosives and air
plane plastics from foodstuffs.
Britain and the U.S. have fallen
into a carefully planned trap laid by
the cunning fingex-s of Doktor Goeb
bels. Propagandizing the lie that
Germany is food-short shifts the re
sponsibility to the Allies.
* If! *
IFOOVER'S supporters argue that
starving Europe will not increase
resistance to the Nazis but only turn
the Occupicd countries against
Britain and the U.S. These people
say that hatred of the Allies will
overwhelm hatred of Hitler.
Well, you don't have to go back
far in history to find examples of
what hunger can do to an op
pressed population. Our own
time has seen revolt and rebellion
because of famine.
In 1932 the streets of Berlin were
patrolled by hundreds of policemen
and guards. But the people were
starving and in broad daylight, un
der the eyes of the police, they
stormed into .the shops of Berlin and
seized the food.
Today in Europe there are hun
gry people too. These are the peo
ple that plow in the fields, reap
the harvests, drive the columns of
food trucks into Berlin for their
Nazi masters. They know only that
the Germans are eating; they arc
not. And William Shircr tells us
that nightly they pray for the
R.A.F. to drop bombs on their
country — though it may mean
their own death—only so the Nazis
will be wiped out.
In starving Nazi-held Belgium
terrorists are firing food ware
houses today. Yes, the Belgian peo
ple are hungry, but they value their
freedom more.
These are the deeds of men who
prefer starvation to slavery, death to
dishonor.

IUST for the sake of argument let

through.
We will have to do a heap of as
suming: that the Eritish relax their
blockade; that Mr. Hoover finds a
"neutral" authority; (that there is
such a thing as a neutral state to
day); that Herr Hitler allows the
food to be sent in and adheres to
the provisions: namely food only for
women and children.
Granted all this might be done,
what then? The New Republic has
this to say on the subject:
It is hard to sec how help can he
given the peoples of the subjugated
countries in such a way that it
does not aid Germany. Any food
that comes from the outside re
leases food to he used for other
pu rposcs.
This, then, would be the motive
behind Hitler's acquiescence to Hoo
ver's plan. A study made last year
by the U.S. Department of Agri
culture showed that there was
enough food in Europe (i.e., German
control) to prevent famine. In fact,
Walter Darre, Nazi secretary of ag

months taken up the cry that Ger
many cannot feed these people; that
Britain and the U.S. can and must
feed them.
The strategy behind this is ob
vious in the light of recent foocf
statistics from Europe. The Nazis
have conserved and swollen a tre
mendous Food Pool to see them
through this war. They cannot let
Occupied Europe starve complete
ly for several important strategic
reasons:
There is the danger of revolt; they
have geared the industries of Occu
pied Europe to their war machine
and must keep up the working
capacity of their slaves; there is the
dread of plague and pestilence which
might sweep from the famine-rid

Germany.
For these reasons, the Nazis
know that Occupied Europe must
be fed. But they would like it
much better if Britain and the
U.S. did the feeding. Then they
could continue to conserve all
their food; continue to manufac

Britain and the U.S. have fallen

patrolled by hundreds of policemen
and guards. But the people were
starving and in broad daylight, un
der the eyes of the police, they
stormed into .the shops of Berlin and
seized the food.
Today in Europe there are hun
gry people too. These are the peo
ple that plow in the fields, reap
the harvests, drive the columns of
food trucks into Berlin for their
Nazi masters. They know only that
the Germans are eating; they arc
not. And William Shircr tells us
that nightly they pray for the
R.A.F. to drop bombs on their
country — though it may mean
their own death—only so the Nazis
will be wiped out.
In starving Nazi-held Belgium
terrorists are firing food ware
houses today. Yes, the Belgian peo
ple are hungry, but they value their
freedom more.
These are the deeds of men who
prefer starvation to slavery, death to
dishonor.
IUST for the sake of argument let
us assume that Mr. Hoover's plan
to feed Occupied Europe goes
through.
We will have to do a heap of as
suming: that the Eritish relax their
blockade; that Mr. Hoover finds a
"neutral" authority; (that there is
such a thing as a neutral state to
day); that Herr Hitler allows the
food to be sent in and adheres to
the provisions: namely food only for
women and children.
Granted all this might be done,
what then? The New Republic has
this to say on the subject:
It is hard to sec how help can he
given the peoples of the subjugated
countries in such a way that it
does not aid Germany. Any food
that comes from the outside re
leases food to he used for other
pu rposcs.
This, then, would be the motive
behind Hitler's acquiescence to Hoo
ver's plan. A study made last year
by the U.S. Department of Agri
culture showed that there was
enough food in Europe (i.e., German
control) to prevent famine. In fact,
Walter Darre, Nazi secretary of ag
riculture, has boasted that the Ger
mans have enough food to feed all
Europe and still wage war indefi
nitely.
* sjt $
,j ut —Joe Goebbels and his propa
ganda stooges have in recent
months taken up the cry that Ger
many cannot feed these people; that
Britain and the U.S. can and must
feed them.
The strategy behind this is ob
vious in the light of recent foocf
statistics from Europe. The Nazis
have conserved and swollen a tre
mendous Food Pool to see them
through this war. They cannot let
Occupied Europe starve complete
ly for several important strategic
reasons:
There is the danger of revolt; they
have geared the industries of Occu
pied Europe to their war machine
and must keep up the working
capacity of their slaves; there is the
dread of plague and pestilence which
might sweep from the famine-rid
den countries to the very heart of
Germany.
For these reasons, the Nazis
know that Occupied Europe must
be fed. But they would like it
much better if Britain and the
U.S. did the feeding. Then they
could continue to conserve all
their food; continue to manufac
ture ersatz explosives and air
plane plastics from foodstuffs.
Britain and the U.S. have fallen
into a carefully planned trap laid by
the cunning fingex-s of Doktor Goeb
bels. Propagandizing the lie that
Germany is food-short shifts the re
sponsibility to the Allies.
* If! *
IFOOVER'S supporters argue that
starving Europe will not increase
resistance to the Nazis but only turn
the Occupicd countries against
Britain and the U.S. These people
say that hatred of the Allies will
overwhelm hatred of Hitler.
Well, you don't have to go back
far in history to find examples of
what hunger can do to an op
pressed population. Our own
time has seen revolt and rebellion
because of famine.
