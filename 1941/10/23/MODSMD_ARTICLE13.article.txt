# Moses Presents Isolationist Views
## 
### 
Feeling that a student newspa
per adequately reflects the views
of the students, Editorial Board of
The Daily felt that those opposed
to the present editorial policy
should have the opportunity of ex
pressing their ideas.
Lin Moses, political science grad
and assistant in that department
was asked by The Daily to submit
an editorial explaining non-inter
vention viewpoints.
His contribution appears today
on page 4.
Friday morning's Daily will
carry an answer to Mr. Moses'
contribution. Friday noon all
students will have an opportunity
to participate in The Stanford
Daily Poll explained today in an
other column.
