# R.O. Unit Smashed In Mud Hole Blitz
## 
### 
Stanford's "little army," doing
its bit for national defense, braved
death in the field south of the
stables yesterday when an R.O.T.C.
battery charged into a camouflaged
mudhole.
When the smoke of battle had
cleared, two horses of Battery C
and their respective gun crews
were trapped in the abyss. A re
lief unit was summoned and the
victims of the encounter were
hauled back to the stablesâ€”for a
bath.
