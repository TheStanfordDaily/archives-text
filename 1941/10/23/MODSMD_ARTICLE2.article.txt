# Train Rally Cheers Team Today, 2:20
## Indians Will Fight To Stay in Race For Pacific Title 
### 
For the second time (his year,
Stanford students, gathering at the
Fiji house at 2:15 this afternoon,
will send their football team north
with another train rally.
This time, the situation is a bit
different. No longer is Stanford un
defeated and untied. Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's Indians are fighting
to stay in the conference race and
the Washington game is slated by
most sports writers to be one of the
toughest contests of the year.
"Let's make this northern excur
sion more successful than the last
one with a big turnout at the station
to see the team off," urges Bob
Blake, co-chairman of the rally with
Jane Armstrong.
Blake urges everyone, equipped
with cars and as many means of
making noise as possible, to gather
at the Fiji house promptly at 2:15.
The route followed will be the same
as before with the procession wind
ing down the Row, going past
Roble, doubling back by Encina and
Branner, and driving down Palm
Drive to the Palo Alto station.
A short program, featuring short
talks from Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy and various members of the
team and yells and songs and yells
by Head Yell Leader Joe Messina
and assistants Doc Colyear and Bud
Clary, will be held before the train
pulls away at 3.
The Stanford band will again be
on hand to lead the way to the
station.
