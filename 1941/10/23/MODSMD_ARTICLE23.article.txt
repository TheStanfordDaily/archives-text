# German Drive Bogs Down As Winter Storms Sweep Moscow, Southern Fronts
## Reds Claim Strong Counter-attacks Stall Nazi Blitz for Fourth Day; Report Japanese-U.S. Agreement 
### United Press 
Indications appeared today (Thursday) that the German offensive
against Moscow, now three weeks old, was breaking down and that the
Sitter Russian winter, fast closing down on most of the eastern front, might
force a stalemate of major operations until spring.
Both sides agreed that snowstorms, icy gales and driving rains were
■ .sweeping the struggling armies and

seriously hampering military opera
tions.
The Germans admitted the rough
weather was slowing down the as
sault on Moscow's defenses and that
their panzer forces assaulting the
Donets Basin and driving towards
the Caucasian gateway of Rostov
had paused for a "breathing spell."
RUSSIA CLAIMS:
The Russians asserted that stub
born Soviet counter-attacks had
stalled the Nazi offensive against
Moscow for the fourth successive
day and had stopped the German
sweep eastward in the far south.
Meanwhile, in London Lord Slra
bolgi, championing the plan of in
vading the Continent, charged thai,
a "feeling of frustration and disap
pointment was widespread in Brit
ain and said he understood that the
Germans had only 25 divisions
(about 375,000 men) of second-lino
troops and fewer than 100 tanks in
the "whole of the west."
NAZIS RETALIATE
In France, German authorities
rounded up 100 "firing squad" hos
tages for the assassination of a Nazi
army major at Bordeaux and exe
cuted 50 others for the slaying of a
German lieutenant colonel at Nantes
on Tuesday. Fifty others were to be
executed for the Nantes slaying—re
prisal of 100 for I—unless the assail
ants were in German hands by Fri
day. Vichy officials in radiocasts ap
pealed to Frenchmen to stop the at
tacks on German authorities and to
betray the killers.
