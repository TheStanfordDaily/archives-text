TOKYO, Thurs., Oct. 23 (UP).â€”
Tokyo and Washington are nearing
agreement on a formula for relaxa
tion of their mutual freezing re
strictions as applies to funds of the
diplomatic establishments of each
nation in territories controlled by
the other, it was understood today.
The agreement, which has been
urider discussion since each country
froze the financial assets of the other,
including funds of diplomatic estab
lishments, possibly will be along the
lines a heady reached between this
country and Britain under which
funds from limited export sales un
der license are allowed to accumu
late in such centers as London,
Tokyo and New York, to provide a
"pool" of available money on which
diplomatic establishments can draw
for operating expenses.
HOPEFUL SITUATION
The U.S. embassy here lias been
operating under the greatest diffi
culty since its funds were frozen
but it was anticipated that this sit
uation soon will be lightened.
There was no indication, however,
of any general relaxation of Un
freezing regulations which would
make possible a restoration of trade
between Japan and the United
States on any appreciable scale.
MORE GOOD NEWS
Meantime, in another indication of
a slight lessening in Japanese-Amer
ican tension following formation of
the new "army" government headed
by Prime Minister Gen. Hideki Tojo,
the foreign office announced last
night that three Japanese ships are
en route to American ports with
1,204 passengers, mostly American
citizens of Japanese descent.
