# Farm Student Guide Service Shows Stanford to World
## 
### 
Like every other institution, Stanford has its "front men."
Poised at the front of the Quad to interpret the University to scores of
visitors from all over the globe, three Stanford students act as hosts to
the outside world.
George Kaufman, as director of the guide service, is the head "mouth-

| piece." With two years'
lin the Stanford fire department, |
I George knows the physical layout
: of the campus like a book. His two (
assistants are Hap Everett and Ted j
; Schroeder. Ted, who is the nation's |
j third ranking tennis player, is in
' charge of the souvenir stand and
I Hap specializes in the school's his
i tory, athletic and otherwise.
CACHED IN ARCH
One or more of the boys is cached
'in a little vault-like chamber in
what remains of the Memorial Arch
i from 10 until 5 every day. Sunday
j is by far the busiest day for the trio,
though Grayline and California Par
lor Car tours are conducted through
the church on week-days.
The guide service has been in ex
j istence for several years, but this
j year, under the supervision of Mrs.
Marjorie Price, the service has been
pepped up and has taken its place
as one of the key organizations in
Stanford's relations with the outside
world.
Although the church is the main
point of interest to almost all visi
, tors, many people ask to be directed
i to Herbert Hoover's home, the War
; Libe, or the Museum.

"It is an easy job to contact visi
j tors," the boys say, "because they
can't help being enthusiastic when
they drive down Palm Drive in the
| sun and see that church and that
j tower."
Everyone has a good word for
the University. One woman, re
cently arrived from Denmark, said
! she had never expected to see any
thriig like "that cathedral" in the
new world. Globe - trotters have
commented that it surpasses any
thing in Europe.
Many people want to know if the
| students appreciate their own church
and alumni especially like to talk
[ with the guides about the old days.
The guides are sometimes baited
after a Stanford athletic defeat but
most people express a deep regard
for the school's sports eminence,
j Easterners like If) compare Stanford
! with Cornell.
