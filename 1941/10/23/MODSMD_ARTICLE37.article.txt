# GRIDDERS LEAVE TODAY FOR NORTH
## 
### 
S football squad leaves today for the Northwest and its
chance to wind up as the Conference's best team. The Indians, who
tangle with Jimmy Pholan's Washington Huskies Saturday in the big
bowl by the side of the lake, went through their semi-final home work
out yesterday.
The team's final workout will be here this morning before the team
boards the train at 3 p.m. Brightest note in yesterday's drill was the
showing of A1 Cole at quarterback. The little Scooter has taken to the
position very quickly in the matter of signal calling, passing, faking, and
running. Hoot Armstrong suffered a reoccurrence of an old leg injury, but
heat was immediately applied to the leg so he will probably be able to
go Saturday.

This will be Stanford's toughest
hurdle, with the possible excep
tion of Santa Clara. The way the
conference boils down now, the
four toughest teams in the loop
are Washington, Stanford, and the
two Oregons. Right now Washing
ton is probably as hot as any of
them and the Cards will know
they are in a ball game when they
face Itay Frankowski, Jack Stack
pool, and the rest.
HUSKIES LOSE 2, WIN 2
The Huskies lost to Minnesota and
Oregon State, but who hasn't? Both
games were very close and the Hus
skies acquitted themselves very
well. Since those first two games,
Washington has polished off Wash
ington State and U.C.L.A. Phelan's
favorite trick is to trip the league's
hot shot. Remember what he used
to do to U.S.C. And the Seattle
jinx holds almost as much terror for
our southern teams as the famed
"Curse of the Palouse."

in the Bruin game, Washington will just about be at full strength. Stack-

Despite the fact that several of their best men were temporarily cooled
pool whs injured last week but unfortunately for Stanford he will probably ;
see action. Frankowski was also taken out of the game but will be
ready to go.
Washington has a lot of new faces this year. With 'Marx, McDowell,
Mucha, and McAdams graduated, the Huskies came up with some sensa
tional new men.
Don Means, a veteran at quarter, is just rounding into his old form
and Ernie Steele has also settled down to his old habits of running holes
in the opposing secondary.
Earl Younglove and Fred Olson hold down the end positions hut
these two boys have to make room for Bill Sloan, a sensational pass
catcher. Bobby Erickson. who throws passes to these three and Steele,
has been having a little trouble with his leg but will probably start
against the Cards.
In the line, Walt Harrison, a made-over fullback, is taking Mucha's
place and since the Oregon State game, has been doing a fine job at
center. Glen Conley, veteran from Cheney, and Dick Greenwood are I
others back in the line. Frankowski at his best is one of the Coast's great- j
est guards and with Mucha gone, he has been carrying much of the j
defensive burden.
This man Sloan at end has been an offensive demon so far this season, j
especially on the receiving end of passes thrown by Sophomore Erickson. j
Sloan is five feet ten inches tall and weighs 185 pounds. He's been aroiJnd !
for a couple of years but not until the first two games of this year has he j
really been outstanding. He is battling it out with Olson for the right j
end spot.
SCOUT All) CARDS' PREPARATIOkN
Stanford leaves at :5 o'clock this afternoon. Yesterday the boys
took another look at Washington plays while several men on crutches
and canes looked on from the sidelines.
The Indians fear Washington's new backs, although the scouts have
gotten a pretty good line on this year's Husky. Besides Erickson, a fine j
triple-threater, Phelan has Neil Brooks, who this week is being prepared
to take Stackpool's place in case the big pile-driver has to retire early. |
Uncovered in the Cougar game was Bobby Barrett, who ran W.S.C. crazy
in the closing minutes of the game. Then Washington has some fine
reserve backs in Mark McCorkle and Ernie Snow.

S football squad leaves today for the Northwest and its
chance to wind up as the Conference's best team. The Indians, who
tangle with Jimmy Pholan's Washington Huskies Saturday in the big
bowl by the side of the lake, went through their semi-final home work
out yesterday.
The team's final workout will be here this morning before the team
boards the train at 3 p.m. Brightest note in yesterday's drill was the
showing of A1 Cole at quarterback. The little Scooter has taken to the
position very quickly in the matter of signal calling, passing, faking, and
running. Hoot Armstrong suffered a reoccurrence of an old leg injury, but
heat was immediately applied to the leg so he will probably be able to
go Saturday.

This will be Stanford's toughest
hurdle, with the possible excep
tion of Santa Clara. The way the
conference boils down now, the
four toughest teams in the loop
are Washington, Stanford, and the
two Oregons. Right now Washing
ton is probably as hot as any of
them and the Cards will know
they are in a ball game when they
face Itay Frankowski, Jack Stack
pool, and the rest.
HUSKIES LOSE 2, WIN 2
The Huskies lost to Minnesota and
Oregon State, but who hasn't? Both
games were very close and the Hus
skies acquitted themselves very
well. Since those first two games,
Washington has polished off Wash
ington State and U.C.L.A. Phelan's
favorite trick is to trip the league's
hot shot. Remember what he used
to do to U.S.C. And the Seattle
jinx holds almost as much terror for
our southern teams as the famed
"Curse of the Palouse."

in the Bruin game, Washington will just about be at full strength. Stack-

Despite the fact that several of their best men were temporarily cooled
pool whs injured last week but unfortunately for Stanford he will probably ;
see action. Frankowski was also taken out of the game but will be
ready to go.
Washington has a lot of new faces this year. With 'Marx, McDowell,
Mucha, and McAdams graduated, the Huskies came up with some sensa
tional new men.
Don Means, a veteran at quarter, is just rounding into his old form
and Ernie Steele has also settled down to his old habits of running holes
in the opposing secondary.
Earl Younglove and Fred Olson hold down the end positions hut
these two boys have to make room for Bill Sloan, a sensational pass
catcher. Bobby Erickson. who throws passes to these three and Steele,
has been having a little trouble with his leg but will probably start
against the Cards.
In the line, Walt Harrison, a made-over fullback, is taking Mucha's
place and since the Oregon State game, has been doing a fine job at
center. Glen Conley, veteran from Cheney, and Dick Greenwood are I
others back in the line. Frankowski at his best is one of the Coast's great- j
est guards and with Mucha gone, he has been carrying much of the j
defensive burden.
This man Sloan at end has been an offensive demon so far this season, j
especially on the receiving end of passes thrown by Sophomore Erickson. j
Sloan is five feet ten inches tall and weighs 185 pounds. He's been aroiJnd !
for a couple of years but not until the first two games of this year has he j
really been outstanding. He is battling it out with Olson for the right j

Stanford leaves at :5 o'clock this afternoon. Yesterday the boys
took another look at Washington plays while several men on crutches
and canes looked on from the sidelines.
The Indians fear Washington's new backs, although the scouts have
gotten a pretty good line on this year's Husky. Besides Erickson, a fine j
triple-threater, Phelan has Neil Brooks, who this week is being prepared
to take Stackpool's place in case the big pile-driver has to retire early. |
Uncovered in the Cougar game was Bobby Barrett, who ran W.S.C. crazy
in the closing minutes of the game. Then Washington has some fine
reserve backs in Mark McCorkle and Ernie Snow.

S football squad leaves today for the Northwest and its
chance to wind up as the Conference's best team. The Indians, who
tangle with Jimmy Pholan's Washington Huskies Saturday in the big
bowl by the side of the lake, went through their semi-final home work
out yesterday.
The team's final workout will be here this morning before the team
boards the train at 3 p.m. Brightest note in yesterday's drill was the
showing of A1 Cole at quarterback. The little Scooter has taken to the
position very quickly in the matter of signal calling, passing, faking, and
running. Hoot Armstrong suffered a reoccurrence of an old leg injury, but
heat was immediately applied to the leg so he will probably be able to
go Saturday.

This will be Stanford's toughest
hurdle, with the possible excep
tion of Santa Clara. The way the
conference boils down now, the
four toughest teams in the loop
are Washington, Stanford, and the
two Oregons. Right now Washing
ton is probably as hot as any of
them and the Cards will know
they are in a ball game when they
face Itay Frankowski, Jack Stack
pool, and the rest.
HUSKIES LOSE 2, WIN 2
The Huskies lost to Minnesota and
Oregon State, but who hasn't? Both
games were very close and the Hus
skies acquitted themselves very
well. Since those first two games,
Washington has polished off Wash
ington State and U.C.L.A. Phelan's
favorite trick is to trip the league's
hot shot. Remember what he used
to do to U.S.C. And the Seattle
jinx holds almost as much terror for
our southern teams as the famed
"Curse of the Palouse."

in the Bruin game, Washington will just about be at full strength. Stack-

Despite the fact that several of their best men were temporarily cooled
pool whs injured last week but unfortunately for Stanford he will probably ;
see action. Frankowski was also taken out of the game but will be
ready to go.
Washington has a lot of new faces this year. With 'Marx, McDowell,
Mucha, and McAdams graduated, the Huskies came up with some sensa
tional new men.
Don Means, a veteran at quarter, is just rounding into his old form
and Ernie Steele has also settled down to his old habits of running holes
in the opposing secondary.
Earl Younglove and Fred Olson hold down the end positions hut
these two boys have to make room for Bill Sloan, a sensational pass
catcher. Bobby Erickson. who throws passes to these three and Steele,
has been having a little trouble with his leg but will probably start
against the Cards.
In the line, Walt Harrison, a made-over fullback, is taking Mucha's
place and since the Oregon State game, has been doing a fine job at
center. Glen Conley, veteran from Cheney, and Dick Greenwood are I
others back in the line. Frankowski at his best is one of the Coast's great- j
est guards and with Mucha gone, he has been carrying much of the j
defensive burden.
This man Sloan at end has been an offensive demon so far this season, j
especially on the receiving end of passes thrown by Sophomore Erickson. j
Sloan is five feet ten inches tall and weighs 185 pounds. He's been aroiJnd !
for a couple of years but not until the first two games of this year has he j
really been outstanding. He is battling it out with Olson for the right j
end spot.
