# Card Soccer Team to Play S.F. Staters
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity soccer team
that plays San Francisco State to
morrow afternoon will lie a vastly
improved aggregation over the team
which opened the season three
weeks ago.
After being held to a scoreless tie
by U.S.F. in the first game, the
Cards met a team of experienced
British sailors last week. Although
the sailors won, 1 to 0, the local
team gained a great deal of knowl
edge from the game, which they can
use to good advantage against the
Rams tomorrow.
The squad looked better in this
week's practice than it has in any
of its games this season. Coach
Harry Maloney still is dickering
with two teams, either of which he
may start the game with. He won't
definitely decide on his starters until
tomorrow before the game.
The team which played the ma
jority of the game last week-end in
cludes Fernando, Carney, Sol, Gun
terman, and Wool in the front line,
Co-captain Johnson, Vose, and Cha
pot at the halfbacks, Hamlin and
Peters at fullbacks, and the other
co-captain. Jack Burns, at goalie.
