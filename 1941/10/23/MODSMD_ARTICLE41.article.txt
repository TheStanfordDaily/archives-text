### DON SELBY 
TF YOU plan to do any betting on football games in which Stanford par
ticipates this season, Saturday is the best date you can pick.
For the first time since the Washington-Stanford game a year ago, the
Indians will not be overwhelming favorites. Indeed, everything points
to Clark Daniel Shaughnessy's charges going into the fracas as the under
dogs, especially in Seattle betting circles.
In the second place, if the Indians go lo the Rose Bowl, you'll need
money to accompany them. If they win Saturday, you win your bet
and will have that money. If they lose to the Huskies, they won't he
heading Pasadena-ward in December, and you won't need the money.
So how can you lose?
If, some way or other, the Big Red Machine can roll through, over, or
around the Huskies for enough points to win the game, the chances of a
successful season will be greatly enhanced. Having taken care of two of

the Ihree other toughest teams in
the loop, the Oregon teams, Stanford
can look forward only to Santa
Clara, U.S.C., W.S.C., and California.
Did we say that a set-up like that
was easy? If so, we didn't mean it.
At any rate, everybody else is say
ing that the Cards will be a shoo-in
if they pass up Washington. They
say Buck Shaw's Santa Clara boys
aren't as good as the undefeated, un
tied record of the Broncs indicates.
But any schedule that puts the In
dians against the Huskies and the
Broncs on successive Saturdays is
no set-up.

COURSE, most everything de
pends upon this battle up in
Seattle Saturday.
Let's see how things stack up:
Although Stanford has in Bruno
Banducci, Chuck Taylor, Vic
Lindskog, Ed Stamm, Loren La-
Prade, and Freddie Meyer six
sevenths of a forward wall that
experts rate as the best on the
coast, the Indians have not shown
a really top-notch defense. Even
in winning every game last sea
son. the Stanfords were not rated

as the best at stopping the other fellows' stuff.
The "Wow Boys" just made more points than did the other fellows.
They had the men who could do it. Now the situation is a little changed.
But Washington, on the other hand, hasn't come through with too sharp
a defensive record itself, having given vip only slightly less yardage per
game than the Indians have. Broken down into the aerial and ground
phases of the game, the statistics show that while the Indians have been
bumped for an average of six yards more by the running attacks of
opponents, Washington has allowed 88.5 yards per game via the air lanes
in comparison to the 84.2 gained over the Indians.
