## Championship Intramural Tilt Will Precede Cougar Contest 
### 
In a setting that is a fair reward for the efforts that 375 Stanford put
into making the intramural grid rate a success, ihe 1941 championship
intramural game will be played as a preliminary to the Stanlord-Wash
ington State game in Stanford Stadium November 15.
Intramural Manager Hob Burnett announced the arrangement last
night, and expressed the hope

teams will co-operate in running off |
schedules on time so that Ihe dead- ]
line for the title mix can be met.
Just what teams will play before
probably the largest intramural au- |
dience in Farm history is still a
guess, but wise guessers cannot go j
too l'ar wrong in examining the Fire- j
house squad, defending champions.
Kappa Sigma. Delta Tau Delta.
Zeta Psi, Business School, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Nu, and En
cina Basement. These and several
others arc still strong in the race for
their particular league honors and
from then on anyone that reaches j
the playoffs will be at top form.

The champions will have their last
workout in preliminary play against
Campo Tuesday. Zcta Psi will settle
its feud with the Delta Chi's Wed
nesday. Business School has yet to
meet the Zetes before their path is
clear.

feated leaders in League No. 7. Jack

Encina Basement dismembered
Encina 3W, 24 to 0. Bill Spragins
passed for two scores to Ken Horth,
and conected with Bob Elliott for an
other, Clarence Woodard fell on a
kickoff in 3W's end zone to complete
the score.
ENCINA IE WINS
Encina IE completed a 30 to 0 re
conditioning of an unorganized squad
from 3E. End runs were the main
weapons, Art Smith traveling 60
yards on one sweep. Charles Metcalf
going for a second, and Bill liar
wood producing a third for three of
the goals. Phil Prince passed for
30 yards to Harwood for the fourth
goal, and tossed a 50-yard flip, again
to Harwood, for the "coup de grace."
In a setting that is a fair reward for the efforts that 375 Stanford put
into making the intramural grid rate a success, ihe 1941 championship
intramural game will be played as a preliminary to the Stanlord-Wash
ington State game in Stanford Stadium November 15.
Intramural Manager Hob Burnett announced the arrangement last
night, and expressed the hope

teams will co-operate in running off |
schedules on time so that Ihe dead- ]
line for the title mix can be met.
Just what teams will play before
probably the largest intramural au- |
dience in Farm history is still a
guess, but wise guessers cannot go j
too l'ar wrong in examining the Fire- j
house squad, defending champions.
Kappa Sigma. Delta Tau Delta.
Zeta Psi, Business School, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Nu, and En
cina Basement. These and several
others arc still strong in the race for
their particular league honors and
from then on anyone that reaches j
the playoffs will be at top form.

The champions will have their last
workout in preliminary play against
Campo Tuesday. Zcta Psi will settle
its feud with the Delta Chi's Wed
nesday. Business School has yet to
meet the Zetes before their path is
clear.
