# Frosh Gridmen To Face A.A.C.
## 
### 
Until we learn more about the
! prep stars, high school stars, and
.I.C. stars that make up the Alham
bra Athletic Club, Stanford's un
| beaten Papeese remain heavy favo
rites to wax the Clubmen when they
meet in the Stadium at 2:30 p.m.
Saturday.
Don't be surprised Saturday when
Harry Shipkey comes up with a few
new wrinkles in his T offense. From
the looks of practice, halfback Jim
i Pettit is being groomed for a couple
I of breakaway dashes behind vastly
I improved blocking.
PATE SHIFTED
Mentor Shipkey moved into an
I unbalanced line for a bit yesterday
with Dave Pate plunging off the
short side on what looks like a po
tential ground gainer.
Two weeks from Saturday the
Card yearlings tie into the age-old
rival, California.
The Blue and Gold frosh ran up
75 points in its first two games this
| season against SF.J.C and McClel
\ lan Field Flyers, but Coach Clint
j Evans wants to see the results of
| Saturday's game with S.C. before he
i believes the Cubs are really a
I capable club.
WOODS INJURED
Evan's eleven haven't measured
! the Trobabes since 1936, the last
time they went through the season
j undefeated. Since the Redskin
babes trounced S.C. 25-6 two weeks
I ago, the Cal-Trobabe score should
I be a good indicator of what will
j happen two weeks hence.
Dave Pate will handle fullback
1 Saturday. Out with an injured
knee, Clem Woods will no doubt be
; lost to the team until the Cal en
! counter.
I Jim Kresl, third-string full,
worked out in practice and will be
j ready at first hand to replace Pate.
