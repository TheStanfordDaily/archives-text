# The 						Opposition Speaks
## 
### 
Always wishing to follow a policy of free
dom of speech and thought, The Daily has
called upon one of the prominent campus
isolationists, Lin Moses, to express the views
of those generally opposed to Daily editorial
policy. His editorial, written at the request of
The Daily, follows:
ONE can undertake such a job as "presenting
the case of the non-interventionist in 600
words" only with fear and trembling. A water
tight argument cannot be presented on either
side; and certainly no short treatment will do
either side justice.
'Io the reader I apologize for the didactic
method employed. By questions rather than
statements, however, the most undisputed evi
dence (i.e., the acceptable evidence in your
own mind) can be adduced.
I have tried to group the queries around the
chief issues of the problem. And I do know
that many of these are leading questions. Beefs
may be addressed to Campus Opinion.
* * *
Is intervention necessary for our national self
preservation?
If invasion were a reasonably simple military
venture, would not Churchill have invaded
Western Europe in the past few weeks with
the bulk of German military might in the East?
Is intervention an economic necessity?
If Hitler wins, and if he chooses to pursue the
policy orneriest, but least beneficial to the Ger
man standard of living, and (if he can) so cuts
off all our European and Asiatic export trade,
will that loss (less than 3V2 per cent of our pro
duction in the last two decades) plunge us into
dictatorship and chaos? If so, how?
Is Dakar, 3500 miles from Europe and 1800
miles from a point still 7000 miles from the U.S.,
a telling threat to our military safety?
Will intervention leave us more, or less, free
to strengthen our defenses, military, economic,
political, and ideological, in Latin America?
If it is the "Hitler idea" that is the threat, how
is it better defeated, on the battlefield, or in the
realm of ideas, and the political and economic
issues they concern? Can we better defeat the
"Hitler idea" by falling into a long and exhaust
ing (and bloody) war, or by education, by propa
ganda, and by "making democracy work"?
* * *
Will intervention entail an appreciable social
cost?
Can we win the war without defeating the
German army? How? Will we also have to
defeat the Japanese army? Can we defeat these
armies without presenting substantially equal
armies—and taking roughly comparable losses?
How? (Submit answers to the General Staff,
United States Army, Washington, D.C.)
How many years will this take? How many
lives will it cost —how many million lives?
Will the waging of a war require regimenta
tion of materials, men, and ideas during the
war? Will the problems at the end of the war
be so much simpler as to make possible the
cessation of that regimentation?—will national
unity be any firmer, or any less necessary? Will
a demobilized army returning to no jobs in
crease governmental worries? Will the curtail
ing of war production and consequent unem
ployment relax the emergency? Then how con
fident can we be that a war against dictatorship
will not be a (perhaps the only possible) way

of bringing dictatorship to the United States?
Will we be a nation in better psychic balance,
of more emotional and political stability at the
end of such a bitter war than at the end of an
equal period of "striving to make democracy
work"?
Will the eight points and the policing of the
world leave us any less of an "armed camp"
than a Hitler victory? How?
What can we expect our intervention to gain
for the world?
Will Joe Stalin's kindly influence at the peace
table (assuming we can win) be beneficial for
the cause of democracy? What paths other than
defeating his army, or compromising, are avail
able?
Will the long run interests of the race be
promoted by anything other than an ameliora
tion of the basic problems that gave rise to Hit
lerism? And will we (and the British—and the
Russians), after sacrificing sons and brothers,
and security, and hope, be in proper mind to
make such concessions and adjustments as are
necessary to the establishment of a more just
(and hence more peaceful) order?
If not, what hope for others? If not, what jus
tification for the terrific toll?
* * *
Then?
Then do we do better to adopt program 1 or
program 2?
1. Rather than see a British defeat, enter the
war (to win it —and therefore at any required
cost) in dubious prospect of benefits for our
selves, or for the oppressed, or for future gen
erations of war-ridden peoples, but at an inevi
table cost in lives, and to our democracy.
2. Stay out and: curtail present tendencies
toward hysteria; extend our efforts toward trade
and amicability in Latin America; aid Britain on
a genuinely "short of war" basis; continue ade
quate defenses; improve steadily the working
of our democracy by eliminating the footholds
of Nazism: intolerance, injustice, poverty, ig
norance, and fear.

miles from a point still 7000 miles from the U.S.,
a telling threat to our military safety?
Will intervention leave us more, or less, free
to strengthen our defenses, military, economic,
political, and ideological, in Latin America?
If it is the "Hitler idea" that is the threat, how
is it better defeated, on the battlefield, or in the
realm of ideas, and the political and economic
issues they concern? Can we better defeat the
"Hitler idea" by falling into a long and exhaust
ing (and bloody) war, or by education, by propa
ganda, and by "making democracy work"?
* * *
Will intervention entail an appreciable social
cost?
Can we win the war without defeating the
German army? How? Will we also have to
defeat the Japanese army? Can we defeat these
armies without presenting substantially equal
armies—and taking roughly comparable losses?
How? (Submit answers to the General Staff,
United States Army, Washington, D.C.)
How many years will this take? How many
lives will it cost —how many million lives?
Will the waging of a war require regimenta
tion of materials, men, and ideas during the
war? Will the problems at the end of the war
be so much simpler as to make possible the
cessation of that regimentation?—will national
unity be any firmer, or any less necessary? Will
a demobilized army returning to no jobs in
crease governmental worries? Will the curtail
ing of war production and consequent unem
ployment relax the emergency? Then how con
fident can we be that a war against dictatorship
will not be a (perhaps the only possible) way

of bringing dictatorship to the United States?
Will we be a nation in better psychic balance,
of more emotional and political stability at the
end of such a bitter war than at the end of an
equal period of "striving to make democracy
work"?
Will the eight points and the policing of the
world leave us any less of an "armed camp"
than a Hitler victory? How?
What can we expect our intervention to gain
for the world?
Will Joe Stalin's kindly influence at the peace
table (assuming we can win) be beneficial for
the cause of democracy? What paths other than
defeating his army, or compromising, are avail
able?
Will the long run interests of the race be
promoted by anything other than an ameliora
tion of the basic problems that gave rise to Hit
lerism? And will we (and the British—and the
Russians), after sacrificing sons and brothers,
and security, and hope, be in proper mind to
make such concessions and adjustments as are
necessary to the establishment of a more just
(and hence more peaceful) order?
If not, what hope for others? If not, what jus
tification for the terrific toll?
* * *
Then?
Then do we do better to adopt program 1 or
program 2?
1. Rather than see a British defeat, enter the
war (to win it —and therefore at any required
cost) in dubious prospect of benefits for our
selves, or for the oppressed, or for future gen
erations of war-ridden peoples, but at an inevi
table cost in lives, and to our democracy.
2. Stay out and: curtail present tendencies
toward hysteria; extend our efforts toward trade
and amicability in Latin America; aid Britain on
a genuinely "short of war" basis; continue ade
quate defenses; improve steadily the working
of our democracy by eliminating the footholds
of Nazism: intolerance, injustice, poverty, ig
norance, and fear.
Always wishing to follow a policy of free

ONE can undertake such a job as "presenting
the case of the non-interventionist in 600

tight argument cannot be presented on either

either side justice.

will not be a (perhaps the only possible) way

of bringing dictatorship to the United States?
Will we be a nation in better psychic balance,
of more emotional and political stability at the
end of such a bitter war than at the end of an
equal period of "striving to make democracy
work"?
Will the eight points and the policing of the
world leave us any less of an "armed camp"

Then?
Then do we do better to adopt program 1 or
program 2?
1. Rather than see a British defeat, enter the
war (to win it —and therefore at any required
cost) in dubious prospect of benefits for our
selves, or for the oppressed, or for future gen
erations of war-ridden peoples, but at an inevi
table cost in lives, and to our democracy.
2. Stay out and: curtail present tendencies
toward hysteria; extend our efforts toward trade
and amicability in Latin America; aid Britain on
a genuinely "short of war" basis; continue ade
quate defenses; improve steadily the working
of our democracy by eliminating the footholds
of Nazism: intolerance, injustice, poverty, ig
norance, and fear.
Always wishing to follow a policy of free
dom of speech and thought, The Daily has
called upon one of the prominent campus
isolationists, Lin Moses, to express the views
of those generally opposed to Daily editorial
policy. His editorial, written at the request of
The Daily, follows:
ONE can undertake such a job as "presenting
the case of the non-interventionist in 600
words" only with fear and trembling. A water
tight argument cannot be presented on either
side; and certainly no short treatment will do
either side justice.
'Io the reader I apologize for the didactic
method employed. By questions rather than
statements, however, the most undisputed evi
dence (i.e., the acceptable evidence in your
own mind) can be adduced.
I have tried to group the queries around the
chief issues of the problem. And I do know
that many of these are leading questions. Beefs
may be addressed to Campus Opinion.

Is intervention necessary for our national self
preservation?
If invasion were a reasonably simple military
venture, would not Churchill have invaded
Western Europe in the past few weeks with
the bulk of German military might in the East?
Is intervention an economic necessity?
If Hitler wins, and if he chooses to pursue the
policy orneriest, but least beneficial to the Ger
man standard of living, and (if he can) so cuts
off all our European and Asiatic export trade,
will that loss (less than 3V2 per cent of our pro
duction in the last two decades) plunge us into
dictatorship and chaos? If so, how?
Is Dakar, 3500 miles from Europe and 1800
miles from a point still 7000 miles from the U.S.,
a telling threat to our military safety?
Will intervention leave us more, or less, free
to strengthen our defenses, military, economic,
political, and ideological, in Latin America?
If it is the "Hitler idea" that is the threat, how
is it better defeated, on the battlefield, or in the
realm of ideas, and the political and economic
issues they concern? Can we better defeat the
"Hitler idea" by falling into a long and exhaust
ing (and bloody) war, or by education, by propa
ganda, and by "making democracy work"?
* * *
Will intervention entail an appreciable social
cost?
Can we win the war without defeating the
German army? How? Will we also have to
defeat the Japanese army? Can we defeat these
armies without presenting substantially equal
armies—and taking roughly comparable losses?
How? (Submit answers to the General Staff,
United States Army, Washington, D.C.)
How many years will this take? How many
lives will it cost —how many million lives?
Will the waging of a war require regimenta
tion of materials, men, and ideas during the
war? Will the problems at the end of the war
be so much simpler as to make possible the
cessation of that regimentation?—will national
unity be any firmer, or any less necessary? Will
a demobilized army returning to no jobs in
crease governmental worries? Will the curtail
ing of war production and consequent unem
ployment relax the emergency? Then how con
fident can we be that a war against dictatorship
will not be a (perhaps the only possible) way

of bringing dictatorship to the United States?
