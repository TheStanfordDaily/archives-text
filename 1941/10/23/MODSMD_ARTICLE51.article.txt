LET US HELP AND BELIEVE
J READ in the paper the other morning that promi
nent Protestant clergymen, at a recent meeting held
in Washington, urged the President to continue in his
policy of all-out aid to Russia, and if anything to in
crease and make this aid more effective. The clergy
men in so doing slapped the faces of ostensibly pious
newspaper crusaders who have been saying that we
should not help the Russians because they have no
organized church system, and because they are an ad
mittedly "atheist" state.
The declaration of the clergy shows that many per
sons who are really religious minded are in favour
of aid to Russia, and are not particularly scared that
Russia's atheistic ideas will seep into this country. And
to me that is the only stand that can be taken. For all
that we are interested in at the present time is to have
the Germans defeated, the Russians are in a measure
trying to do this, and it is only natural that our sym
pathy and our help go to the side of the Russians.
In the fight that they are fighting, most of us think
them right, and helping them doesn't mean that we
will agree or be affectcd by their irreligious ideas. All
we want from them is to stop the Germans for as
long as they can.
For newspaper editors to write editorials in bold
face saying that we shouldn't, help the Russians be
cause in so doing we would be fostering ideas of athe
ism and irreligion, is ridiculous and a very weak
argument for keeping this country out of foreign en
tanglements. It may be desirable to keep this country
out of foreign affairs, but this is not one of the good
reasons.

A ND along the same lines, Senator Martin Dies came
out with the statement saying "the very grave
danger exists that our government, by its aid to Russia
on the Eastern Front, has opened up for Stalin a new
Western Front right here in the capital of America."
I think that the Texas Tornado is a little confused
in his conclusions. It sounds kind of logical to say that
our helping the Russians in their battle encourages
Communist infiltration in this country, but I don't think
it is. I don't think that the Russians believe that we
have changed our ideas about their system, I don't
think that they are naive enough to think that we are
sending them supplies because we want to preserve
Communism, I don't think the Russians expect the
United States to turn Communistic after the war. I'm
sure that most Russians know that the United States
is selfish, and that it is helping Russia because in so
doing it is also helping itself.
No, I think the T from Texas is wrong in thinking
lhat there is any kind of correlation between the
amount of supplies we send the Russians, and the
number of slinky assassins and time bombs that the
Russians send over to us.
