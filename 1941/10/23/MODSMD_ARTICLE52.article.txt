# CAMPUS OPINION
## FIVE SIMPLE QUERIES 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I need help! Every day I hear of some new ex
tracurricular activity, some new rule or regulation.
Good God, is everyone at Stanford, except me, the
chairman of some committee? There seem to be so
many campus organizations that there can't possibly
be enough jobs to keep each one busy.
Therefore, everyone must run about duplicating
the jobs of others. Yet, there must be some sort of
planned distribution of activities throughout the cam
pus because so many things are accomplished by the
students.
However, why keep this system of activity integra
tion a secret, unless it be to hide a bit of graft and
corruption? I'm a sophomore now (through no fault
of the noise at Encina) and I know as little about
what makes the University tick as when I innocently
entered last year. I would feel as if I were a man of
the world if I knew:
1. Why the B.A.C. ticket takers at football games
aren't on the San Francisco police squad;
2. What the Cardinals do and how much they get
for doing it;
3. What the Excom does at L'Omelette's on Tuesday
evenings;
4. Who was responsible for "Konko the Bronko";
5. Who gets all the $2 fines I have to pay.
Oh so innocent!
