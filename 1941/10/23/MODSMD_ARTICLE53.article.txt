# DEFENDERS OF GOLDEN GATE
## 
### 

ON THE ALERT for an attacking force by "invaders" loitering in
naval craft oIT the Golden Gate at San Francisco, soldiers of the harbor
defense forces leap into action from a bomb-proof shelter to meet a
"landing party." It's a part of maneuvers designed to test harbor
defenses.
