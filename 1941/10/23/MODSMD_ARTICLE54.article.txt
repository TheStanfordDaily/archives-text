# Direction, Cast Make Players' 'Far Off' Hills' Excellent Show
## 
### 
"THE FAR OFF HILLS," by Lennox Robinson, presented by the Stanford
Players and scheduled for performance October 215, 24, 25, and 27.
The air of the Little Theater last night was literally foggy with brogues
when the Stanford Players opened their season with the famous Irish
comedy, "The Far OfT Hills." And very good it was, too —accents and all.

Concerned with the problems oi
middle class Irish family, under the
thumb of a domineering elder sister j
(superbly played by Sylvia Berry), j
the play presented a group of charm
ing, gentle people, with just enough 1
salt to keep affairs out of the sac
charine classification.
From the critic's standpoint, "The j
Far Off Hills" literally shrieked of
excellent direction and staging. The
play, in itself, is pleasant but not
outstanding. It needed everything
cast and director could give it. They 1
gave it all they had, with results j
which left the audience chuckling !
most of the time, and howling just
enough of the time.
Besides Miss Berry, in the role
of intolerant Marian Clancy, the cast
boasted a more-than-usual quota of
Stanford's better actors — to wit:
Frank Burt, as the blind father;
Nancy Burkett as an excitable ado
lescent; and Ted Marcuse as a raf
fish perennial bachelor.
New and also were Ber
nice Linden, Kitty Bell Tippetts, and
Lisle Selby.—Nowell
