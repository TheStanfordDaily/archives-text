WITH THE GERMAN ARMY AT
KIEV, via Courier to Berlin (UP). —
A series of explosions and fire which
raged from Sept. 24 to 2!) laid waste
an area of 20 to !50 square blocks
along the main street of this capital
of the Ukraine, leaving 50,000 per
sons homeless.
German authorities say two Soviet j
mine explosions near the Grand and ;
Continental hotels started the catas- j
trophe; that so far German pioneers
have removed 10,000 mines from the J
city and that they are not all out yet.
Mines have been found in mu- i
seums, churches, ofiice buildings |
and homes, the Germans say, and j
they work cautiously in restoring j
the electric system because they are i
afraid there are mines attached to
wiring.
SHORT-WAVE MINES
Fears that the Russians are ex
ploding the mines by short-wave j
radio keep everyone on edge.
Almost one month after its cap- j
lure, Kiev is orderly and is seeth- i
ing with German troops. The water j
supply is not over-plentiful but j
electricity has been restored to some j
individual buildings.
There are bread lines in the ;
streets but no signs of acute short
ages or panic. Potatoes apparently
are plentiful. Germans say the Ger
man army is feeding itself, leaving
the available supplies for the popu- j
lation.
WELL NOURISHED
The general population seems i
fairly well nourished and cheerful,
although badly clothed by western
standards. Terrific poverty is ob
vious in some sections of the city—
dirty, grimy houses or hovels and
ragged inhabitants—and the few im
posing government buildings, such as
the Parliament building, the com
bined ministries building, and the
Ukrainian military command head
quarters, have been taken over by
the German command.

along the main street of this capital
of the Ukraine, leaving 50,000 per
sons homeless.
German authorities say two Soviet j
mine explosions near the Grand and ;
Continental hotels started the catas- j
trophe; that so far German pioneers
have removed 10,000 mines from the J
city and that they are not all out yet.
Mines have been found in mu- i
seums, churches, ofiice buildings |
and homes, the Germans say, and j
they work cautiously in restoring j
the electric system because they are i
afraid there are mines attached to
wiring.
SHORT-WAVE MINES
Fears that the Russians are ex
ploding the mines by short-wave j
radio keep everyone on edge.
Almost one month after its cap- j
lure, Kiev is orderly and is seeth- i
ing with German troops. The water j
supply is not over-plentiful but j
electricity has been restored to some j
individual buildings.
There are bread lines in the ;
streets but no signs of acute short
ages or panic. Potatoes apparently
are plentiful. Germans say the Ger
man army is feeding itself, leaving
the available supplies for the popu- j
lation.
WELL NOURISHED
The general population seems i
fairly well nourished and cheerful,
although badly clothed by western
standards. Terrific poverty is ob
vious in some sections of the city—
dirty, grimy houses or hovels and
ragged inhabitants—and the few im
posing government buildings, such as
the Parliament building, the com
bined ministries building, and the
Ukrainian military command head
quarters, have been taken over by
the German command.
