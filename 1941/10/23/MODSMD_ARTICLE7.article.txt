More than $10,000 has been left the Stanford Convalescent Home by ;
the late Mrs. Timothy Hopkins in her will probated yesterday in Redwood
City. The exact sum of the bequest has not been revealed as the law re

reverted to Stanford University.
MARINE STATION, LIBE
Sixty per cent of the income from
the $963,515 trust fund is to be used
for the support of the University's
Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific
Grove.
An allotment of $4,000 annually
will be devoted to the support of
the Hopkins Transportation Library
and the remainder was designated
for the "establishment and mainte
nance of the Hopkins Medical Li
brary in the Lane Library." The Lane
Library is located at the Stanford
Medical School in San Francisco.
Mrs. Hopkins died last Tuesday
at her home in Menlo Park after an
illness of a year.
Her will, dated March 7, 1934, di
rected that upon her death, a trust
fund in the Wells Fargo Bank and
Union Trust Company should be es
tablished from her personal estate,
income to go to Mr. Hopkins. In
event that he should precede her in
death, the income was to go to the
Stanford Convalescent Home.
LIFE FRIEND
Mrs. Hopkins, a friend of Stanford
University since its founding, was a
benefactor of the Convalescent.
Home.
In addition to the trust fund, the
will bequeathed seven items of jew
elry, manufactured in Paris, to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York City.
The will provides that Stanford
University should receive the in
come from the trust fund, if the
Convalescent Home ceases to oper

to other educational institutions in
California.
ONLY ONE SURVIVOR
No provision was included for
Miss Lydia Kellogg Hopkins, a
daughter, now residing in Woodside
and the only survior of Mrs. Hop
kins. A trust fund for Miss Hopkins
has already been established, the
will explained.
Mrs. Hopkins' estate includes the
luxurious Victorian furnishings of
three Hopkins homes—two in Menlo
Park, the other in San Francisco—
her commercial bank balance, and
personal effects.
"Sherwood Hall,'' manorial home
of Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins in Menlo
Park, was given to them as a wed
ding gift by Mark Hopkins, asso
ciate of Senator Leland Stanford
and foster father of Timothy Hop
kins. Since the 1906 earthquake, the
Hopkins have not occupied Sher
wood Hall, living instead in the
equally elaborate San Franciscc
home during the winter and theii
other home in Menlo Park during
the summer.
