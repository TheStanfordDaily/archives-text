# Time Is Changed For Lagunita Ball
## 
### 
Lagunita's Court Ball is to begin
at 8:30 this Saturday night instead
of the usual 9, because of the 12
o'clock time limit on Saturday
campus dances.
Towers, stained glass windows,
armor, and page boys are being ar
ranged for to create the illusion of a
medieval castle, and all but the mu
sic, furnished by Ernie Heckscher's
orchestra will follow the medieval
theme. Refreshments are to be
served in the Magnolia and Eucalyp
to Social rooms from 10:30 to 11 for
the girls and their escorts, and in
Casa Naranja for patrons and pa
tronesses.
