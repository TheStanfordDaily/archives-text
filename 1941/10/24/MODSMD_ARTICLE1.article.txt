### AMIE REICHERT 
r is the last time this column
shall take up the cudgels against
Herbert Hoover's food plan. Most
of the shooting—at least from these
parts—will then be over; because we
feel that when today's say is fin
ished, we have stated the case as
clearly as we see it, and as com
pletely as space will allow.
Mr. Hoover's appeal, it would ap
pear, rests squarely on a humani
tarian basis. To him feeding the
starving people of Occupied Europe
is nothing more—or less—than a
matter of philanthropy, of moral
responsibility, in short, of humani
tarianism.
It is too bad that Mr, Hoover
has so persistently advocated
American economic collaboration
with a victorious Naziism; that
lie is so closely associated with
some of the most open and die
hard appcascrs in the United
States. All this is too had he
cause it weakens Mr. Hoover's ar
gument.
Mr. Hoover would like his appeal
to remain aloof from political rami
fications, to be purely, simply hu
manitarian. But this is impossible
not only because of Mr. Hoover's
own political views, but because the
scope of the plan is not universal
enough to be called absolutely hu
manitarian.

WPAIN is the most desolate of all
k the famine - ridden countries in
Europe. Why has not Mr. Hoover
made an effort to organize food ship
ments to that country?
Finland's legions are fighting side
by side with the Nazis in northern
Russia. But Mr. Hoover proposes to
send food to Finland.
We cannot follow the reasoning
behind this if Mr. Hoover contin
ues to make appeals in the name
of humanitarianism. Obviously he
lias, in his own mind, inadc some
sort of demarcation line, for to a
humanitarian the children of
Spain would be just as worthy of
food as those of Finland.
It may be argued by Mr. Hoover
and his supporters that Spain is not
ringed with Nazi steel and the Brit
ish naval blockade; that Spain may
buy food from the democracies (al
though the Franco government is
virtually bankrupt).
To a humanitarian this should
make no difference. If there arc
children starving it should make
no difference whose fault it is or
what the reasons are.
This is not to imply that Mr. Hoo
ver is actively pro-Nazi or a fifth
columnist or any other species of
subversive element. But, clearly,
whether he realizes it or not, he
has given his food plan a political
implication which is hardly consist
ent with his philanthropic ideals.

'JMiE question of morale raised by
today's Campus Opinion letter
was discussed conversely in yester
day's column. However, it might
prove enlightening to look at the
U.S. efforts at "vitamin diplomacy"
of only last summer.
At that time we sent a few food
shipments to Spain and French
North Africa, with the permission
of Britain. The idea was to wean
these countries away from the
Axis.
Apparently these attempts were
not too successful. We have seen no
signs of Franco and Weygand
changing their Axis partners for the
Allies.
If it is true that the fifth column
in Occupied Europe will not he
"bought" by American and British
food, it must conversely lie true
that the supporters of democracy
will not he turned against the Al
lies by our withholding food, es
pecially when they see their Nazi
overlords fat, well-fed, and thriv
ing.

Wjpms is a war in which so far,
ruthlcssncss wins. The whole
picture of this war and the periods
leading up to it has had a con
stant characteristic. Always one
side, Hitler, has been willing to be
ruthless, while the other side, Brit
ain was not — and Hitler has won
every time. Maybe Britain can sur
vive by being ruthless too." (Col
umnist Mark Sullivan)
