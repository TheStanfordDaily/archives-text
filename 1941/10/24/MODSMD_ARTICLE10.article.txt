# Faculty Poll Favors FDR War Policy
## 75% Agree to Added Measures If Needed To Help Defeat Axis 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Seventy-five per cent of the Stan
ford faculty unqualifiedly would
favor stronger measures than revi
sion of neutrality legislation and
further lease-lend legislation, if
needed to assure defeat of the Axis
powers, as claimed by the most
recent faculty poll, results of which
were released yesterday.
Second in a series of current opin
ion poll see-saws, the latest was con
ducted by the "dynamic defense"
committee, headed by Dr. Lewis M.
Terman, and was apparently the
committee's answer to Mr. Herbert
Hoover's poll, released Oct. 2.
Mr. Hoover drew the conclusion
from his poll that GO per cent of
the faculty did not agree with 176
faculty members who earlier urged
a "more dynamic defense against the
totalitarian menace."
OPPOSITE VIEWPOINTS
While it would he presumptuous
to say that the Terman poll is a
refutation of Mr. Hoover's, and while
Dr. Terman and his committee would
make no statement to that effect
yesterday, the most recent poll in
fact received answers reflecting de
cidedly opposite viewpoints from
those expressed in the Hoover poll.
Dr. Terman yesterday would make
no statement other than the sugges
tion, "Draw your own conclusions."
341 RESPONSES
The Terman poll was confined to
members of the Academic Council,
active and emeritus (professors, as
sociate professors, and assistant pro
fessors), and the number who gave
some response to one or more of the
questions was 341. A total of 483
ballots were sent out. The commit
tee's statement on the poll claimed
this figure as "an unusually heavy
vote for a poll conducted by mail."
RESULTS FOLLOW
All the figures in the following
statistics are percentages of the 341
who answered one or more of the
questions, according to the release:

policy of our government in the

(Food and munitions to enemies of

bases; the military expedition to
Iceland; the North Atlantic patrol;
embargo on war supplies to Japan.)"
