# Soldiers Favor Wage Increase
## 
### 
Believing that an increase in pay
for soldiers would greatly bolster
army morale, members of the Stu
dent Defenders of Democracy last
week questioned 268 soldiers from
39 different camps and found that.
87.3 per cent of those queried think
that draftees need an immediate
wage increase.
Of those interviewed, 86.2 per cent
feel that the base pay, which is now
$21 a month, should be raised to at
' least $30; 60.5 per cent want it raised
to at least $35; and 42.2 per cent
I want it raised to at least $40. Only
I 13.8 per cent thought that $21 was
I sufficient.
Other S.D.D. members went to
Washington recently to talk with
j legislators about the possibility of
increasing draftees' pay. They vis
ited Senator Murray of Montana,
member of the Military Affairs Com
mittee, who said that he was in favor
of an increase and was investigating
Senate bills which would raise the
army pay. Congressman O'Toole of
New York promised to suggest in
the House that a rider be put on the
next appropriations bill in order to
provide funds for sueh an increase.
