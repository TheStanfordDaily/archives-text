# 'Daily' Student War Poll To Record Farm Views At Noon Meals Today
## Lunch Groups To Cast Votes In Big Survey 
### 
Every Stanford student sitting
down to lunch this noon will have
a chance to express an opinion in a
poll conducted by The Daily on the
question of the United States posi
tion in the war.
"Sixty-five editorial stafT members
of The Daily will distribute more
than 3,500 ballots to students in din
ing halls, eating clubs, fraternities
and sororities, Palo Alto restaurants,
and the rest homes. Students ofl
campus—at Medical School in San
Francisco and the Marine Station at
Pacific Grove —will not be polled.

All Daily stall members must
report to the Daily Shack between
11:45 and 12:10 today to receive
instructions and ballots for the
war poll. Bring cars, if possible.

Individual, printed ballots will be
distributed to all registered stu
dents, who are requested not to sign
their names to the ballots. Voters
will check the square opposite the
statement with which they agree and
will indicate their class and sex.
Ballots will be collected imme
diately after the eating group has
finished voting. Public tabulation of
the votes will be held in the Daily
Shack early Friday afternoon, and
results will be released in Monday's
Daily.
DEGREES OF OPINION
The questions present five alterna
tives from which each student will
select the one which most nearly
represents his attitude toward the
war and the role the United States
should play in the war.
A sample ballot is printed in the
adjoining column.
"Polling seems to be the fash
ionable thing to do these days, but
the purpose of this poll goes deeper
than that," Charles Bull, Daily edi
tor, said.
CO-OPERATION ASKED
"We hope to find out," Bull ex
plained, "just what Stanford stu
dents think, how their thoughts to
day compare with those of the stu
dent, body last year, and how they
compare with those of the nation as
a whole."
"We hope that students will co
operate to the fullest extent so that
3 valid result may be obtained,"
Bull concluded.
