# Blitz Within 37 Miles Of Moscow, Nazis Claim
## Russians Say German Drive Halted By Snow and Mud; British Demand Immediate Invasion of Continent 
### (By United Press 
Panzer forces have smashed to within 117 miles of Moscow on a broad
front, the German high command claimed Thursday, but contradictory
Soviet dispatches asserted that the Nazis' mechanized offensive had bogged
down in snow and mud.
Russia, in the first drastic shakeup of the military command, replaced

Marshal Semyon Timoshenko
commander of the central sector
with Gen. Grigori Zhukov, and, in
a move to strengthen the home front,
sentenced three Moscow factory of
ficials to death for deserting their
jobs in the face of the enemy.
GERMAN VERSION
In addition, German newspapers
published a report datelined Stock
holm saying "it is learned" that

Marshal Semyon Budenny, Russian
commander on the southern front,
is in Lubljanka prison at Moscow
and that Marshal Klementi E. Voro
shilov, commander on the northern
front, had been "liquidated."
In London the House of Com
mons resounded to demands that
Britain reopen a western front, si
multaneously rushing all aid pos
sible to embattled Russia if not ac
tually sending British middle-east

em forces into the Caucasus. The
government pledged that all possible
aid was being and would be sent
the U.S.S.R. but turned a deaf ear
to demands for attacking Germany
in the west.
WHAT THEY SAY:
These were the contradictory
claims from the fighting front:
1. A terse communique from
Adolf Hitler's headquarters claimed
Moscow's outer defenses were pene
trated "in the past few days" from
the west and southwest "on a broad
front" and that offensive spearheads
"fought their way forward at points
within GO kilometers (37.25 miles)
of Moscow."
2. Russian dispatches claimed the
Germans, stopped or thrown back at
all points from Leningrad to the
Crimea, had called upon air and
cavalry forces to regain the of
fensive for them. No new German
gains were reported and the bitter
Russian winter was closing in fast.
WHY THE SHAKE-UP?
The most likely explanation of Jo
sef Stalin's decision to change
horses in midstream is that he and
Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, con
sidered close friends, disagreed
about the defense of Moscow.

a move to strengthen the home front,
sentenced three Moscow factory of
ficials to death for deserting their
jobs in the face of the enemy.
GERMAN VERSION
In addition, German newspapers
published a report datelined Stock
holm saying "it is learned" that

Marshal Semyon Budenny, Russian
commander on the southern front,
is in Lubljanka prison at Moscow
and that Marshal Klementi E. Voro
shilov, commander on the northern
front, had been "liquidated."
In London the House of Com
mons resounded to demands that
Britain reopen a western front, si
multaneously rushing all aid pos
sible to embattled Russia if not ac
tually sending British middle-east

em forces into the Caucasus. The
government pledged that all possible
aid was being and would be sent
the U.S.S.R. but turned a deaf ear
to demands for attacking Germany
in the west.
WHAT THEY SAY:
These were the contradictory
claims from the fighting front:
1. A terse communique from
Adolf Hitler's headquarters claimed
Moscow's outer defenses were pene
trated "in the past few days" from
the west and southwest "on a broad
front" and that offensive spearheads
"fought their way forward at points
within GO kilometers (37.25 miles)
of Moscow."
2. Russian dispatches claimed the
Germans, stopped or thrown back at
all points from Leningrad to the
Crimea, had called upon air and
cavalry forces to regain the of
fensive for them. No new German
gains were reported and the bitter
Russian winter was closing in fast.
WHY THE SHAKE-UP?
The most likely explanation of Jo
sef Stalin's decision to change
horses in midstream is that he and
Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, con
sidered close friends, disagreed
about the defense of Moscow.
Panzer forces have smashed to within 117 miles of Moscow on a broad
front, the German high command claimed Thursday, but contradictory
Soviet dispatches asserted that the Nazis' mechanized offensive had bogged
down in snow and mud.
Russia, in the first drastic shakeup of the military command, replaced

Marshal Semyon Timoshenko
commander of the central sector
with Gen. Grigori Zhukov, and, in
a move to strengthen the home front,
sentenced three Moscow factory of
ficials to death for deserting their
jobs in the face of the enemy.
