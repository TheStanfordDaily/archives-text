HONOLULU, T. 11.. Oct. 2.! (UP).â€”
German warplanes bombed Ameri
can merchant ships in the Red Sea
"fiercely and deliberately" almost
daily, damaging two so seriously
they were drydocked for repairs,
the crew of a freighter returning
from the Red Sea said today,
j A third American freighter hit a
German mine in Suez Harbor and
was badly damaged, the crew said.
The tug towing the damaged freight
| t*r was blown up by the same mine
j and its crew killed.
John Stowe, Brooklyn, N.Y., quar
j termaster of the freighter which ar
j rived at Honolulu from Suez, said
exploding bombs littered the decks
of anchored American ships with
I steel splinters, but none of the ves-
I sels was hit directly by a bomb.

I "The only thing that saved our
! lives," said Stowe, whose ship was a
j target for Stukas, "was the fact the
| Nazis didn't seem to be able to hil a
i bull astern with a bass fiddle."
There were no casualties among
the American crews, Stowe said, but
in one attack fcy German and Italian
planes which lasted more than six
hours, 48 persons were killed ashore
al Suez.
Stowe said his own .ship was "lifted
almost clear of the water" by Ger
man aerial bombs exploding in the
harbor. These "near misses loosened
some hull plates on Stowe's vessel
"but there was no serious damage,"
he said.
