The man who was once the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court (that
is as far as Stanford's production of
"Of Thee I Sing" went) otherwise
Professor Bayard Q. Morgan, re
marked with a smile of reminis
cence, "I think that's the thing I have
enjoyed doing the most here at Stan
ford."
Dr. Morgan, who heads the De
partment of Germanic Languages,
will again play the part of a politi
cian in the forthcoming production
of "Knickerbocker Holiday."
"Our family is all interested in
dramatics. We seem to feel thor
oughly at home on a stage. Our
special interest was in the group of
Stanford actors who played at Tahoe
this summer."
AUTHOR OF BIBLIOGRAPHY
But something that will outlast Dr.
Morgan longer than his acting is his
"Bibliography of German Literature,
1481-1927." This monumental work
has occupied much of his time both
here and at the University of Wis
consin, where he taught for 27 years
before coming to Stanford in 1934.
Dr. Morgan went through about
8,000 volumes, all of which are
classified in this bibliography. He
conducted research in Germany
while on sabbatical leave and a great
deal of his work was done in Lon
don at the British Museum, which
has the most complete collection of
German manuscripts in the world.
The Library of Congress also fur
nished some of the material for his
book.
The Morgan family for a while
conducted summer tours to Ger
many for students. The last time
Professor Morgan was abroad was
during the winter of 1938 and 1939.
He spent much time at the German
universities and was able to observe
the beginning of Hitler's gradual ef
fect on the universities.
GERMAN INDIVIDUALISTS
"The fundamental trend of the
German people is toward individual
thinking and truth. The German
youth is as ardently seeking truth
today as it did in the schools and
universities although the youth is
now on the battlefield. As soon as
Naziism is overthrown, this trait
will rise up."
"Germany is in a state of transi
tion even now. As soon as the
present regime has run its course,
Germany will revert to type and in
dividual thinking will once more be
free."
Professor Morgan is an amateur
musician, an amateur poet, and an
amateur tennis player. Extremely
versatile, he also gardens and does
needlework and tapestry.
SPONSORS CONTEST
Morgan, for the Stanford German
department, has established a trans
lation contest among the California
high schools. Up to 200 manuscripts
have been received and Professor
Morgan awards cash prizes to the
winners. The contest has helped to
acquaint many students with Stan
ford and is the only department at
Stanford which sponsors a contest
of this sort.

AUTHOR OF BIBLIOGRAPHY
But something that will outlast Dr.
Morgan longer than his acting is his
"Bibliography of German Literature,
1481-1927." This monumental work
has occupied much of his time both
here and at the University of Wis
consin, where he taught for 27 years
before coming to Stanford in 1934.
Dr. Morgan went through about
8,000 volumes, all of which are
classified in this bibliography. He
conducted research in Germany
while on sabbatical leave and a great
deal of his work was done in Lon
don at the British Museum, which
has the most complete collection of
German manuscripts in the world.
The Library of Congress also fur
nished some of the material for his
book.
The Morgan family for a while
conducted summer tours to Ger
many for students. The last time
Professor Morgan was abroad was
during the winter of 1938 and 1939.
He spent much time at the German
universities and was able to observe
the beginning of Hitler's gradual ef
fect on the universities.
GERMAN INDIVIDUALISTS
"The fundamental trend of the
German people is toward individual
thinking and truth. The German
youth is as ardently seeking truth
today as it did in the schools and
universities although the youth is
now on the battlefield. As soon as
Naziism is overthrown, this trait
will rise up."
"Germany is in a state of transi
tion even now. As soon as the
present regime has run its course,
Germany will revert to type and in
dividual thinking will once more be
free."
Professor Morgan is an amateur
musician, an amateur poet, and an
amateur tennis player. Extremely
versatile, he also gardens and does
needlework and tapestry.
SPONSORS CONTEST
Morgan, for the Stanford German
department, has established a trans
lation contest among the California
high schools. Up to 200 manuscripts
have been received and Professor
Morgan awards cash prizes to the
winners. The contest has helped to
acquaint many students with Stan
ford and is the only department at
Stanford which sponsors a contest
of this sort.
