# Gaieties Director Wants Dancers
## 
### 
Margo Crane, chief dance director
of this year's Gaieties, still needs
men dancers for the big routine in
the 1941 show.

There are still a number of spots
in the dancing portion of the pro
duction for men. Those that qualify
for these positions are almost cer-

tain of getting a position some
where else in the show. There will
be little time requhed for dance
practice and this also offers an ex
cellent opportunity to become ac
quainted with the "inside workings"
of the show.

Final selection of the cast will not
be made until 7:15 o'clock Wednes
day evening at which time all men
interested in taking part in the
dance routine should report to the
Ram's Head room in the rear of the
auditorium.
