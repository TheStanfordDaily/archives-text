# Seniors to Hold Class Songfest
## 
### 
Plans for an inaugural Senior Sing
under Co-chairmen Ethel Hoover
and Chuck Smith are still in the
primary stages, but the festivity
will be patterned on successfully
carried out sings given on the Uni
versity of California campus. It is
mainly being held to organize mem
bers of the senior class before Sen
ior Activities Week begins in June.
Senior Council members, elected
by senior representatives from each
living group, selected the Hoover-
Smith combination to take charge of
the experiment festivity.
Entertainment will be entirely by
and for the senior class.
