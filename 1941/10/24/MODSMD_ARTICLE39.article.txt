# Army Record Compliments New Coach

### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 23 (UP).—One I
of the big questions on Eastern grid
irons is this: Just how potent was |
the inspiration Army derived from
last week's victory over Yale?
Will it lift the revitalized Cadets |
to a triumph over Columbia at West
Point Saturday so that they can
march into Yankee Stadium on Nov.
1 and face Notre Dame with a perfect
record for the first time in eight
years?
Inspiration—morale—seems to be
the all-important factor now with
Army's modernized football forces
which have been drilled magnifi
cently so far this season by Red
Blaik, first civilian coach in West
Point grid history.
BLAIK TAKES HOLD
Blaik and his assistants have done
a great job with the Cadets since
they shifted from Dartmouth in the
spring. Using men from the. same
army team that staggered to one lone
victory last season, Blaik and Co.
have steered the lads in gray and
gold to victories in their initial three
games, the first time an Army team
has achieved this since 193 G.
In his short tenure at the Point,
sorrel-thatched Blaik—a strict fun
damentalist and detail man—started
his squad with the ABC's of football
and brought them along. The Cadets
know their football They
maneuver well.
Meanwhile Blaik and associates
have had the parallel job of re
storing confidence to players who
comprised probably the worst team
in Army history last year. In addi
tion to teaching the soldiers how to
play correctly, they had to sell the
cadet athletes on the idea that they
could win.
PRACTICE FIELD CHANGED
Restoration of confidence was ac
complished partially by shifting
football practice from a distant field
far down by the river to an athletic
field adjacent to the parade grounds.
This shift saved time in going to and
coming from practice, but more im
portant, it permitted the cadet corps
to watch the workouts and cheer
the athletes on. Said watching, in
cidentally, instilled new interest and
pride among corps members.
Army has beaten the Citadel, Vir
ginia Military Institute and Yale.
The Yale victory—2o to 7—was an
upset. Now comes Columbia, and
if the Cadets defeat Lou Littlei's
Lions, that will be an upset also.
The Lions were quoted 7-5 favorites
today, despite Columbia's 7-3 defeat
by unbeaten Georgia last week.
The experts figure that Columbia
and Georgia are considerably tough
er than the opposition the cadets
have faced heretofore. Whether the
experts are right or wrong, one
thing is certain—West Point is per
meated with an atmosphere of pig
skin confidence it hasn't known in
years. From plebe to commandant
there is that old feeling of confidence
that swept the Academy in 1933
when Army met Notre Dame on Dec.
2 after nine straight victories.
