Coach Harry Maloney gave his
first two strings a rest yesterday
preparatory to their game with San
Francisco State this afternoon on
Maloney Field at 3:45.

Maloney sent his reserves through
a scrimmage with the frosh. After
the practice Coach Maloney and
Captain Jack Burns announced the
following starting line-up: forward
line left to right, Fred Carnie, Tony
Gunterman, A1 Wool, Rene Paz, and
Fernando Eleta; halfbacks left to
right, Jack Pagen, Ed Johnson, and
Howard Vose; fullbacks. Oilie Ham
lin and Hank Peters; and goalie, ei
ther Burns or Frank Card.
The State eleven has won its only
two starts this season, defeating Cal
Aggies and San Mateo J.C. Al
though the visiting team will be
small, it will be fast and smart.

In 1906 a baseball game between
Philadelphia and Boston lasted 4
hours and 47 minutes.
