### DON SELBY 
Vf/ITH so much consideration being given to the great Stanford-Wash
ington set-to up north, it seems to us that a looksee should be tossed
in the direction of the other battles in and out of the conference.
CALIFORNIA VS. U.S.C.
This is a bad one to start out with, for there is little more than pride
at stake in this game, which used to be one of the biggest contests in
the conference.
The Bears started out, especially after their first game, as one of
the teams to beat, which everyone proceeded to do with ease. Now
they are fighting to keep out of the cellar against the only team to
have downed highly-touted Oregon State.
It looks like a U.S.C. victory from where we stand, for, while the
Trojans aren't too outstanding, they appear to have a superior attack, sim
ply because they have Bobby Robertson. The Bears have no one. as long

as there is no more a Jim Jurko
vich to carry the mail, who can do
for them what Robertson (and now
Paul Taylor) does for U.S.C.
OREGON STATE VS.
WASHINGTON STATE
The Cougars could piny "Fairy
Godmother" to the winner of the
Stanford - Washington crucial by
knocking over the team that has put
both the Huskies and the Indians
in the ranks of teams defeated in
conference play.
Naturally, the chances of that hap
pening are slight, for Oregon State's
record gives ample evidence that the
Beavers have far more on the ball
than have the Cougars. Yet, as long
as thei'e's a boy named Billy Sewell
on the W.S.C. eleven, that outfit has
a scoring threat that may break
loose any time. It's O.S.C. to win,
but our hopes lie with Babe Hol
lingberry's lads.
OREGON VS. U.C.L.A.
Tex Oliver's surprising team, onc-

half of the upset twins from the state of Oregon, should have little trouble
fathoming a Q-T attack that's been very ineffectual thus far. As a mat
ter of fact, it would indeed be a reversal of form if any eleven downs the
Ducks before they meet O.S.C. late in the season.
Curt Meecham, one of the best backs in the loop, and ten other boys
who can play good football will move through the Bruins, stop the latter's
offense, and come out of the battle with a clear-cut victory.
SANTA CLARA VS. OKLAHOMA
The only undefeated, untied major team on the Pacific Coast faces a
midwestern outfit that has been downed by only Texas University, the
scourge of the gridirons. If the Broncs have their minds on Stanford and
revenge for last year's 7-6 shading, the Sooners could quite easily send
Santa Clara home a beaten gang. This wouldn't be good from a Stanford
point of view, for it would likely make the Broncs all the tougher for
next week's contest.
On the ability of the Broncs to come through depends the reputation of
Pacific Coast football, and we're counting on L. T. "Buck" Shaw's boys to
win. Kenny Casenega will be the difference.
ST. MARY'S VS. LOYOI^A
With two runaway victories over U.S.F. and Portland U. tucked firmly
under their collective belt, the Gaels should roll over the southerners (from
Los Angeles) on pure momentum. Johnny Podesto can pass; Buzz Tre
botich can run. St. Mary's will win, despite Matty Mathews' prediction
that the Lions will take a surprise victory. Mathews, you will remember,
is the fellow who screamed that his team could beat the Gaels if the teams
were to play again. This after his lads had taken a 31-0 shellacking.

IUOW to get back to things having to do with Stanford:
'Long about the first of the week we were thinking that the smart
thing to do would be to pick the Huskies to win tomorrow's "gigantic" at
Seattle. It just seemed logical, that's all.
Included among the reasons for that thought were the following:
the uncertainty of Pete Kmetovic's ability to play; the same with
Arnie Meiners; the fact that Washington has played a somewhat
tougher schedule than the Indians have; and a general idea that the
Ilukies had really been rolling up to that point.
As the week wore on, however, that old faith in the Shaughnessy
coached Stanfords began to creep in, until now we just can't see the Indians
losing.
It's a matter of sentiment, no less. Yet we feel that there are many
others who have that same faith in the Indians to come through.
They did it last year when no one expected it. Just because every
one (or almost everyone) expects the boys to pull miracles out of the
bag again this year is no reason why they can't do just that.
Perhaps they won't have to come from behind tomorrow as they did a
year ago, when the score was 10-0 in favor of Washington when the teams
took time out for a rest after half the game had been played. We hope
not, for that kind of football is darn tough on the nerves. But if Stanford
is behind come half time tomorrow, we'll still be counting on a victory for
the Red. We felt that way when the Beavers led by that count two weeks
ago, and nothing happened. We don't think the case will be the same
tomorrow.
