# Encina 2E, 4W Top Foes To Capture Mural Leads
## 
### 
Freshman views of the; intramural grid picture were considerably
cleared up last night when two Encina teams, 2E and 4W, won their third
straight games and emerged its definite leaders of the two frosh brackets,
League 9 and 10.
The squad from second floor east dropped the 4E septet (i to 0 in a

close duel which gave the
first, claim on honors in League 9.1
John Brudie tossed to Rueben
Mettler for the single score. The
passing duo of Brudie to Bob Hago- !
pian did most of the work for 2E,
which has one game left against
the comparatively impotent Bull
pen.
Chuck Hopper, Bob Craig, and
Durward Howes led the 4W squad in
a 32 to 0 annihilation of 2W. The
pass-run-block slaughter was the
third straight win for the fourth
floor team, but their outlook is less
cheery than their fellow winners on
the east side. 4W's remaining game
is against an Encina Basement squad
that has won two straight by 24-0
and 19-6 scores.
BREAKERS DOWN BETA
Bruce Clark skirted the end of
his Breaker squad to bring a score
and a victory over Beta Theta Pi,
7 to 2. Clark flipped a bullet to Al
Wool for the conversion. The Betas
smeared Clark behind his goal as he
was attempting to return Roger
Laverty's kick for their two points.
Phi Psi I ended the football year
for Alpha Kappa Lambda by admin
istering its third defeat 12 to 0. Bill
Quackenbush passed to Tiff Denton
for the first goal, and Norman Ene
vold threw a pass to Edwin DeMoss
for the final count.
Luckless Phi Kappa Sigma lost its
second consecutive mix by a single
point as Phi Delta Phi outscored it
13 to 12. The winners collected first
on a pass from Robert Gooch to Bill
Doble. The second six came on a
flip from Gooeh to Lawrence Lydick,
and the winning extra was accom
plished by the Gooch-Doble combi
nation.
Phi Kap played even ball all the
way, their scores the results of ef
forts of Harry Dyck who flipped to
two scores, one to Bud Ames, and
the other to Fred Pruter. The all
important extra point was nullified,
despite official argument on the
decision.
FINAL ARRANGEMENTS
Further information about the
final game for the circuit, to be
played as a preliminary to the Stan
ford-Washington State conference
tilt, was released by Manager Bob
Burnett. Dr. Oswald Andersen, di
rector of the School of Health, will
make the presentation of the 18-inch
trophy to the champions. Members
of both the winning and running-up
squads will be introduced through
the public address system.
Arrangements for the final game
were made by Harry Wolter, head
of the Stanford intramural program.
Today at 4, undefeated Zeta Psi
meets an equally unblemished Busi
ness School team. If Business School
wins they are champions of League
5. If fortune backs up Ace Hanlon,
i the Zetes still have Delta Chi to
hurdle before they are in.

cleared up last night when two Encina teams, 2E and 4W, won their third
straight games and emerged its definite leaders of the two frosh brackets,
League 9 and 10.
The squad from second floor east dropped the 4E septet (i to 0 in a

close duel which gave the
first, claim on honors in League 9.1
John Brudie tossed to Rueben
Mettler for the single score. The
passing duo of Brudie to Bob Hago- !
pian did most of the work for 2E,
which has one game left against
the comparatively impotent Bull
pen.
Chuck Hopper, Bob Craig, and
Durward Howes led the 4W squad in
a 32 to 0 annihilation of 2W. The
pass-run-block slaughter was the
third straight win for the fourth
floor team, but their outlook is less
cheery than their fellow winners on
the east side. 4W's remaining game
is against an Encina Basement squad
that has won two straight by 24-0
and 19-6 scores.
