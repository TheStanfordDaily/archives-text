# Papooses Seek Fourth Victory Of '41 Season
## 
### 
Out for its fourth straight win,
Harry Shipkey's frosh eleven clashes
with the Alhambra Alumni Club in
Stanford Stadium at 2:30 p.m. to
morrow. Of unknown potential
strength, the club boasts several for
mer stars of high school and prep
teams.
For the Papooses, the opening line
up is almost the same except at full
back, where Dave Pate starts in
place of Clem Woods, injured in
practice last week. Ross Dana will
start at right half.
Taking a look at the Alhambra
record so far this season we find the
Clubmen coming up with three wins,
two losses and one tie.

Back to the home roost gives the
Card babes three impressive vic
tories over better-than-average bull
clubs, Bakersfield 12-0, Long Beach
J.C. 20-0, and S.C. frosh 25-6.
The yearlings' offense has been
just that to its opponents thus far.
In the S.C. game, the ground game
bogged down and the Shipkey crew
looked like a herd of turtles. So
into a series of pass plays went quar
terback Cannon Parkinson, the Utah
hotshot.
And three heaves netted three
touchdowns.
But it won't be passing alone to
morrow from the looks of practice.
Potential ground-gainers from an
unbalanced line have been diagnosed
to fit the speedy backfield quartet
of Parkinson, Pate, Dana, and Jim
Pcttit.
Jack McCurdy is definitely in
stalled at center after missing the
first two games and playing only the
last five minutes of the S.C. tussle.
