# Water Polo Team Meets U.S.C Today
## 
### 
Fighting to stay in the league race,
Stanford's water polo team will tan
gle with the Southern California
Trojans at 4:15 today in the Encina
pools.
The favored Cardinal mermen '
dropped their opening conference i
contest, 10 to 6, to the powerful
U.C.L.A. Bruins last week. Out- |
played completely in the first half [
and behind, 8 to 2, the Indians, led j
by sophomore Giant Culley, made a
determined comeback attempt but |
just couldn't penetrate the Bruin de
fense.
Stars of the visiting Trojan squad
are Krause, veteran forward, and
Hitchcock, second team all-conl'er
ence selection at goalie last year.
With Krause leading the way, the
Trojans topped Compton J.C. twice
by scores of 7 to 4, and 5 to 4.
Stanford's Grant Culley, forward
star of the U.C.L.A. game, has been
kept out by a cold part of this week
and probably will not start.
Most encouraging news is the re
turn of Don Smith, varsity swimming
captain, to back up Bill Mapel at the
important sprint job. When Smith
enters the game, Mapel probably
will shift over to forward.
Still in doubt is the goalie position
where sophomore Pete Lee is tem
porarily installed at first string. Cap
tain Frank Mitchell and Jack
Bleecker, Stanford's dependable
I guard pair, will start at their usual
jobs.
Stanford's freshman team will face
I Fullerton Junior College in the En
' cina pools at 2:30 followed by the
I varsity jayvees against the San
! Francisco Y.M.C.A.
