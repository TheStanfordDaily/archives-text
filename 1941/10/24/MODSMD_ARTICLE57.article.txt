ffOW do you like your football
teams rated? By the point
system, whereby Minnesota compiles
a 324.56 rating and Emory and Henry
gets only 43.02? Or perhaps by the
voting method, whereby Texas re
ceives 2,098'/a votes from the leading
society writers throughout the coun
try as one of the nation's top teams
and Presbyterian gets only 2 votes?
Or maybe you like the indefinite
type whereby a self-styled expert
releases the top 300 teams of the
country, in order, each week not for
any particular reason, but just on in
tuition?
For my money the system that
picks Stanford as the No. 1 team in
the country, despite adversity of all
kinds, is the only rating that really
puts out the straight dope.

after three hours of hard
u work on the practice field Pete
Kmetovic and Milt Vucinich still
have as much spirit as if they were
just going into the Big Game. In
that three hours they're not just
sitting around, because on most of
Coach Shaughnessy's plays the backs
are always in motion somewhere
even if they aren't directly connect
ed with the ball.
Pete Kmetovic maintains the same
all-out attitude even when he knows
he has his post cinched. He always
works the plays exactly as Shaugh
nessy intends them to be worked
