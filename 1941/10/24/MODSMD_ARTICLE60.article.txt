# Defeat of Hitler Essential--— An Answer to Isolation Arguments
## 
### 
YESTERDAY in this column Lin Moses ex
pressed the essence of arguments against ;
intervention of the United States in the war.
To attempt to answer individually each of the
36 questions he posed would take a good deal
more type than could be fitted into these two
columns. We will, however, attempt to dis
cuss his four general divisions of the problem
in the same order as they appeared yesterday.
Intervention might not be necessary for our
national self-preservation, but the defeat of Hit
ler is necessary. If England and Russia can j
eliminate Hitlerism with the kind of aid we are |
now giving them that would be fine. But it is j
rather dubious.

Economically, a Hitler defeat is practically
essential to our present way of life. A Hitler
victory and subsequent elimination of all U.S.
exports to Europe and Asia v/ould give our eco
nomic system a shock much more severe than
it has ever been subjected to in the past. That
export of a mere 3V2 per cent (actually nearer
6 per cent) of our production referred to yes
terday amounts to a mere three to five billion
dollars annually. But in that small percentage of
tolal production is included 60 per cent of our
cotton, 40 per cent of our tobacco, 30 per cent
of our machinery, 36 per cent of our copper, 15
per cent of our automobiles, and high percent
ages of the total output of many other KEY
INDUSTRIES.

It's just like bowling—if you hit the KEY pin
all the others will fall as a result of this one
blow.
Trade with Hitler implies a return to the
barter system, and he dictates the terms. He'll
buy our stuff if we take back twice the value
in some one of his products (which we don't
want) infi&xchange.
And hell be able to undersell us in South
America with the products of low-cost, low
wage Central European mass production.
This is a much greater threat to our nation
than that of immediate armed invasion.

If Hitler wins, we'll have all we can do over
here trying to keep alive some spark of democ
racy without trying to educate and propagan
dize the German people into dropping the
"Hitler idea" and giving democracy a little try.

"Will intervention entail an appreciable social
cost?"
If it is necessary for us to intervene any more
than we already have—to send an expedition
ary force—to insure the defeat of Hitler, it will
"entail an appreciable social cost."
Many men will be killed. Some of them will
be from Stanford.

But would this not be better than leaving the
job for the classes of '55 and '60? It will be a
lot harder then.
Would this not be better than subjecting them
to what v/ould amount to life in an armed camp,
continuous compulsory military training, con
tinuous conflict with an empire bent on world
domination?
We weathered regimentation, rationing, de
mobilized armies, and all the rest the last time.
If the immediate objective can be gained, would
it not be worth weathering these again? We
think the leaders of nations also have a very
clear picture in their minds of the muddle of
Versailles and will not stage a repeat per
formance.
The color of future events in case we win is
a little more vague than if totalitarianism is
victorious (we know what the "New Order" is
like), but we'd rather take a chance on getting
rid of a little regimentation in our own country
after the war than "striving to make democracy
work" against the insidious inroads of an all
pervading Hitlerism.

What can we expect our intervention to gain
tor the world?
As a defeatist attitude has never at any time
had much support in America, let's assume that
we are going to win.
The "long run interests" of the Czechs, the
Danes, the Poles, the Belgians, and a few mil
lion other subjugated people will not, we are
sure, suffer a setback in the event of an Anglo-
American victory.
And when the time comes for setting up some
effective form of international organization, we
will be far better equipped than we were in
1920.
There is an old proverb—"lf at first you don't
succeed, try, try again."
Just because our first attempt at international
organization had two strikes on it when it
started, is that any reason why we cannot profit
from our mistakes and "try again," with the
even-money bet that we will be able to do a
better job?

Then to achieve our predetermined end—
complete eradication of all the elements of Hit
lerism—would we not do best by adopting the
following policy:
Aid to Britain in every way which is militarily
and strategically necessary and valuable to the
cause.
The consummation of the Roosevelt-Churchill
eight points.
Ultimately, achievement of an effective form
of democratic international organization.

Versailles and will not stage a repeat per
formance.
The color of future events in case we win is
a little more vague than if totalitarianism is
victorious (we know what the "New Order" is
like), but we'd rather take a chance on getting
rid of a little regimentation in our own country
after the war than "striving to make democracy
work" against the insidious inroads of an all
pervading Hitlerism.

What can we expect our intervention to gain
tor the world?
As a defeatist attitude has never at any time
had much support in America, let's assume that
we are going to win.
The "long run interests" of the Czechs, the
Danes, the Poles, the Belgians, and a few mil
lion other subjugated people will not, we are
sure, suffer a setback in the event of an Anglo-
American victory.
And when the time comes for setting up some
effective form of international organization, we
will be far better equipped than we were in
1920.
There is an old proverb—"lf at first you don't
succeed, try, try again."
Just because our first attempt at international
organization had two strikes on it when it
started, is that any reason why we cannot profit
from our mistakes and "try again," with the
even-money bet that we will be able to do a
better job?

Then to achieve our predetermined end—
complete eradication of all the elements of Hit
lerism—would we not do best by adopting the
following policy:
Aid to Britain in every way which is militarily
and strategically necessary and valuable to the
cause.
The consummation of the Roosevelt-Churchill
eight points.
Ultimately, achievement of an effective form
of democratic international organization.
YESTERDAY in this column Lin Moses ex
pressed the essence of arguments against ;
intervention of the United States in the war.
To attempt to answer individually each of the
36 questions he posed would take a good deal
more type than could be fitted into these two
columns. We will, however, attempt to dis
cuss his four general divisions of the problem
in the same order as they appeared yesterday.
Intervention might not be necessary for our
national self-preservation, but the defeat of Hit
ler is necessary. If England and Russia can j
eliminate Hitlerism with the kind of aid we are |
now giving them that would be fine. But it is j
rather dubious.

Economically, a Hitler defeat is practically
essential to our present way of life. A Hitler
victory and subsequent elimination of all U.S.
exports to Europe and Asia v/ould give our eco
nomic system a shock much more severe than
it has ever been subjected to in the past. That
export of a mere 3V2 per cent (actually nearer
6 per cent) of our production referred to yes
terday amounts to a mere three to five billion
dollars annually. But in that small percentage of
tolal production is included 60 per cent of our
cotton, 40 per cent of our tobacco, 30 per cent
of our machinery, 36 per cent of our copper, 15
per cent of our automobiles, and high percent
ages of the total output of many other KEY
INDUSTRIES.

It's just like bowling—if you hit the KEY pin
all the others will fall as a result of this one
blow.
Trade with Hitler implies a return to the
barter system, and he dictates the terms. He'll
buy our stuff if we take back twice the value
in some one of his products (which we don't
want) infi&xchange.
And hell be able to undersell us in South
America with the products of low-cost, low
wage Central European mass production.
This is a much greater threat to our nation
than that of immediate armed invasion.

If Hitler wins, we'll have all we can do over
here trying to keep alive some spark of democ
racy without trying to educate and propagan
dize the German people into dropping the
"Hitler idea" and giving democracy a little try.

"Will intervention entail an appreciable social
cost?"
If it is necessary for us to intervene any more
than we already have—to send an expedition
ary force—to insure the defeat of Hitler, it will
"entail an appreciable social cost."
Many men will be killed. Some of them will
be from Stanford.

But would this not be better than leaving the
job for the classes of '55 and '60? It will be a
lot harder then.
Would this not be better than subjecting them
to what v/ould amount to life in an armed camp,
continuous compulsory military training, con
tinuous conflict with an empire bent on world
domination?
We weathered regimentation, rationing, de
mobilized armies, and all the rest the last time.
If the immediate objective can be gained, would
it not be worth weathering these again? We
think the leaders of nations also have a very
clear picture in their minds of the muddle of
Versailles and will not stage a repeat per
formance.

It's just like bowling—if you hit the KEY pin
all the others will fall as a result of this one
blow.
Trade with Hitler implies a return to the
barter system, and he dictates the terms. He'll
buy our stuff if we take back twice the value
in some one of his products (which we don't
want) infi&xchange.
And hell be able to undersell us in South
America with the products of low-cost, low
wage Central European mass production.
This is a much greater threat to our nation
than that of immediate armed invasion.

If Hitler wins, we'll have all we can do over
here trying to keep alive some spark of democ
racy without trying to educate and propagan
dize the German people into dropping the
"Hitler idea" and giving democracy a little try.

"Will intervention entail an appreciable social
cost?"
If it is necessary for us to intervene any more
than we already have—to send an expedition
ary force—to insure the defeat of Hitler, it will
"entail an appreciable social cost."
Many men will be killed. Some of them will
be from Stanford.

But would this not be better than leaving the
job for the classes of '55 and '60? It will be a
lot harder then.
Would this not be better than subjecting them
to what v/ould amount to life in an armed camp,
continuous compulsory military training, con
tinuous conflict with an empire bent on world
domination?
We weathered regimentation, rationing, de
mobilized armies, and all the rest the last time.
If the immediate objective can be gained, would
it not be worth weathering these again? We
think the leaders of nations also have a very
clear picture in their minds of the muddle of
Versailles and will not stage a repeat per
formance.
The color of future events in case we win is
a little more vague than if totalitarianism is
victorious (we know what the "New Order" is
like), but we'd rather take a chance on getting
rid of a little regimentation in our own country
after the war than "striving to make democracy
work" against the insidious inroads of an all
pervading Hitlerism.

What can we expect our intervention to gain
tor the world?
As a defeatist attitude has never at any time
had much support in America, let's assume that
we are going to win.
The "long run interests" of the Czechs, the
Danes, the Poles, the Belgians, and a few mil
lion other subjugated people will not, we are
sure, suffer a setback in the event of an Anglo-
American victory.
And when the time comes for setting up some
effective form of international organization, we
will be far better equipped than we were in
1920.
There is an old proverb—"lf at first you don't
succeed, try, try again."
Just because our first attempt at international
organization had two strikes on it when it
started, is that any reason why we cannot profit
from our mistakes and "try again," with the
even-money bet that we will be able to do a
better job?

Then to achieve our predetermined end—
complete eradication of all the elements of Hit
lerism—would we not do best by adopting the
following policy:
Aid to Britain in every way which is militarily
and strategically necessary and valuable to the
cause.
The consummation of the Roosevelt-Churchill
eight points.
Ultimately, achievement of an effective form
of democratic international organization.
YESTERDAY in this column Lin Moses ex

To attempt to answer individually each of the
36 questions he posed would take a good deal
more type than could be fitted into these two
columns. We will, however, attempt to dis
cuss his four general divisions of the problem
in the same order as they appeared yesterday.
Intervention might not be necessary for our
national self-preservation, but the defeat of Hit
ler is necessary. If England and Russia can j
eliminate Hitlerism with the kind of aid we are |
now giving them that would be fine. But it is j
rather dubious.

Economically, a Hitler defeat is practically
essential to our present way of life. A Hitler
victory and subsequent elimination of all U.S.
exports to Europe and Asia v/ould give our eco
nomic system a shock much more severe than
it has ever been subjected to in the past. That
export of a mere 3V2 per cent (actually nearer
6 per cent) of our production referred to yes
terday amounts to a mere three to five billion
dollars annually. But in that small percentage of
tolal production is included 60 per cent of our
cotton, 40 per cent of our tobacco, 30 per cent
of our machinery, 36 per cent of our copper, 15
per cent of our automobiles, and high percent
