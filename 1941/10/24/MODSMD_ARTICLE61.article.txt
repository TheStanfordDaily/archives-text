# "All the World's a Stage"
## 
### 
TODAY The Daily is polling the entire Stan
ford student body in an effort to determine
their composite opinion on the present war situ
ation and the United States' relationship to it.
There have been two such polls, previous to
this one, taken of the Stanford faculty. They
were Mr. Herbert Hoover's personal poll, and
that of a Stanford faculty committee headed by
Dr. Lewis M. Terman, results of which are
printed on the front page of this morning's
paper.
This noon at the luncheon table in every
eating club, dormitory, sorority, and fraternity,
you, the Stanford student, will democratically
express your views on the subject of whether
the United States has any business in the pres
ent war, and if so, how much business we have,
and what part we shall play.

"All the world's a stage, and all the men and
women merely players" are Shakespeare's fa
miliar lines. Today our roles have become in
creasingly important as democracies have been
timetabled off the stage and replaced by pup
pets under dancing strings manipulated by to
talitarian marionetteers.

Sometimes we consider ourselves lucky still
to be saying our own lines on the modern stage
of international affairs, and we may sincerely be
grateful that we are. It seems almost a little too
ethereal, too idealistic to stop there.

If we are to continue to function democrati
cally, it is imperative that we jealously grab the
privileges extended and make our voices—each
one of them count one way or the other in
erecting a public policy and giving it direction.
If Stanford students realize the necessity of

throwing in their two bits' worth, and every
man's opinion will help just so much more, they
will answer the poll at the luncheon table today
and anxiously await the results.
This is one country where actors tell the di
rector how to run things.
And the show must go on.—Harold Shafer
