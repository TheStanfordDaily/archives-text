JUMP ON THE MUSIC TRAIN
J HAVE always felt that music is one of the most
important things in life, and that a true apprecia
tion of music is just another one of the things thai
makes living more interesting and oxciting. There is
nothing that I rather do than spend an evening by
the phonograph and radio, listening to the songs of
Biily Holliday, or the smooth, organized power of
Benny Goodman and his gang, or the singing of Frank
Sonatra, with the Pied Piepers, or the weird, distinc
tive styles of the colored genius, Duke Ellington.
And it is also fun to listen to the semi-classical
stuff, and songs like the ever-present Frank Mund
sings, and it is just as enjoyable to listen to the sym
phonies and concertos of the famous classical com
posers.
For I have always had a hazy theory that all music
is essentially the same, and that anyone that enjoys
one kind of music, can learn to like another. They
are all notes on a scale, some arranged simply, some
complicated, but more or less the same thing. The
only reason that most people like and enjoy popular
music is because it is so simple, because it is heard so
much, and it is easy to get the tune buzzing through
the head. Symphonies are about the same thing, only
more complicated, but they too can start buzzing
through the head, if they are heard enough. To prove
this, consider the popularity of Tchaikowsky's piano
concerto, and the popular songs, Our Love and Moon
Love and many others that were lifted directly from
classical works.
And so I think that there is much in classical mu
sic that people would really enjoy, if they only had the
opportunity to hear, and know this music.

AND so I was very pleased tn hear (hat the San
Francisco Symphony Association had offered the
students of Stanford and other schools a chance to
hear and enjoy such music. The association is offering
a season ticket to their 12 concerts for something over
$9. This means that each concert will cost something
around 75 cents, which is exceptionally reasonable.
Besides this, the Association people have arranged it
so that all the students of one school will sit to
gether. that is all the Stanford kids will be in one
gang, like a rooting section, only there won't be any
rooting, just mostly a lot of affected interest.
The program for this year looks very interesting.
People like Horowitz, Rubenstein, Stravinsky will do
the perfroming, so that the best people in the business
will be on hand.
This column isn't trying to urge anyone into buy
ing a ticket, because this column doesn't care if any
one goes or not. What this column is trying to say is
that symphonies and most classical music is highly
enjoyable, that 75 cents is cheap for such concerts,
and everyone that has any sense will take advantage
of this chance of yetting acquainted with a source of
pleasure that has been sadly neglected.

sings, and it is just as enjoyable to listen to the sym
phonies and concertos of the famous classical com
posers.
For I have always had a hazy theory that all music
is essentially the same, and that anyone that enjoys
one kind of music, can learn to like another. They
are all notes on a scale, some arranged simply, some
complicated, but more or less the same thing. The
only reason that most people like and enjoy popular
music is because it is so simple, because it is heard so
much, and it is easy to get the tune buzzing through
the head. Symphonies are about the same thing, only
more complicated, but they too can start buzzing
through the head, if they are heard enough. To prove
this, consider the popularity of Tchaikowsky's piano
concerto, and the popular songs, Our Love and Moon
Love and many others that were lifted directly from
classical works.
And so I think that there is much in classical mu
sic that people would really enjoy, if they only had the
opportunity to hear, and know this music.

AND so I was very pleased tn hear (hat the San
Francisco Symphony Association had offered the
students of Stanford and other schools a chance to
hear and enjoy such music. The association is offering
a season ticket to their 12 concerts for something over
$9. This means that each concert will cost something
around 75 cents, which is exceptionally reasonable.
Besides this, the Association people have arranged it
so that all the students of one school will sit to
gether. that is all the Stanford kids will be in one
gang, like a rooting section, only there won't be any
rooting, just mostly a lot of affected interest.
The program for this year looks very interesting.
People like Horowitz, Rubenstein, Stravinsky will do
the perfroming, so that the best people in the business
will be on hand.
This column isn't trying to urge anyone into buy
ing a ticket, because this column doesn't care if any
one goes or not. What this column is trying to say is
that symphonies and most classical music is highly
enjoyable, that 75 cents is cheap for such concerts,
and everyone that has any sense will take advantage
of this chance of yetting acquainted with a source of
pleasure that has been sadly neglected.

J HAVE always felt that music is one of the most
important things in life, and that a true apprecia
tion of music is just another one of the things thai
makes living more interesting and oxciting. There is
nothing that I rather do than spend an evening by
the phonograph and radio, listening to the songs of
Biily Holliday, or the smooth, organized power of
Benny Goodman and his gang, or the singing of Frank
Sonatra, with the Pied Piepers, or the weird, distinc
tive styles of the colored genius, Duke Ellington.
And it is also fun to listen to the semi-classical
stuff, and songs like the ever-present Frank Mund
sings, and it is just as enjoyable to listen to the sym
phonies and concertos of the famous classical com
posers.
