## FOR HISTORY 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
Miss Ainic Reichert, the author
of "Historyâ€”l94l," is a most in
telligent and charming young lady.
She is also a very positive one. Her
Monday column this week was de
voted to a criticism of Mr. Hoover's
latest plea for food shipments to
hungry Europe. She considers Mr.
Hoover "a sincere and devoted hu
manitarian" who views the situation
from "a completely moral stand
point," and whose ideals in this
world of force are "a pathetic anach
ronism." Miss Reichert then raises
the question of morale, reminding
us that both Mr. Hoover and his
critics agree that the hunger block
ade helped win the last war. She
therefore assumes that the present
starvation of Europe will prove to
be "a tremendous psychological and
practical advantage for the Allies,"
that somehow the "smouldering hat
red of Europe" will prove to be, or
rather is already, "a powerful and
terrible weapon which we must use
against the Nazis."
I agree that the present policy of
the Allies will forge a weapon which
we must use against the Nazis, be
cause if we don't change it, we may
well find it turned against us to de
stroy our hopes for a decent peace
settlement in case we are able to
win the war. (I agree with Miss
Reichert that we are at war.)
I do not believe with her that it
is possible to separate humanitar
ianism from hard - headed ruthless
war policy to be pursued by the Al
lies. Men, women, and children who
have been rolled over by a blitz
krieg and then find themselves sub
jected to British blockade and aerial
bombardment must feel bitterness
and bewilderment in their hearts
more than sufficient to pievent
their greeting these Allied measures
as welcome means toward eventual
overthrow of the German yoke.
They must curse and rage at the
British who continue bombing them
complacently instead of using all
their striking power against Germany
proper and to aid Russia on the east
ern front.

This policy together with the pub
lication of Lord Gort's report on the
futilities of the B.E.F. must seem
clear evidence that the British are
and will be unable to take the of
fensive for years to come. It will
only bring the conquered peoples to
the conclusion of the men of Vichy
that anything, even Hitler's new
Europe, would be preferable to an
indefinite continuation of this Brit
ish war which to them must seem
warfare directed against helpless
friends rather than against the en
emy.
They know that the British en
courage the effort through the Red
Cross to feed their own nationals
who are prisoners in Germany.
They know that their refugee gov
ernments in London are unable to
protect their interests, depending
upon Britain as they do for their
existence; and they must feel a real
contempt, perhaps even hatred, for
the British and American govern
ments which refuse to experiment
with Mr. Hoover's plan. This con
sists of an elaborate scheme includ
ing food distribution in small lots,
control by a really neutral nation,
and consumption at the distribution
centers. It should work!

Even if some food were seized by
the Germans, their gain would be
more than equalled by the new
morale these conquered people
would have. They would see hope
for eventual victory in allies who
felt strong enough to send them food
and thus encouragement. We can
not expect them to hope for deliv
erance at the hands of a British na
tion which helps lone Russia by
starving its own helpless friends
elsewhere.
After all, we want the British, the
refugee government forces, and our
own brothers to be welcomed when
they attempt a landing in Europe,
instead of being faced by a starva
tion-crazed population either sunk in
apathy or actively aiding the Ger
mans.
Even if the Allies should win, the
present policy toward Europe will
make co-operation in war recon
struction impossible, and the whole
horrible business will remain a wel
ter. The British and Americans will
not then be eager to tackle the prob
lems themselves.
Miss Reichert is right. There is a
larger question of morale.
Henry McCreery
