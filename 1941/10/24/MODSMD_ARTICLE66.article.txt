# Concert Ticket Supply Limited
## 
### 
It is still possible to obtain season
tickets at special reduced rates for
the San Francisco Symphony, al
though the supply is limited.
Blocks of seats in the grand tier and
orchestra sections of the War Memo
rial Opera House have been set
aside for Stanford students who will
be able to sit together for all twelve
of the concerts.
Tickets for the winter season
which begins December 6, winds up
April 18, are selling to Stanford stu
dents for $9.90 (tax included) in
contrast to the regular price of $16.50.
Featured on the symphony programs
will be such noted artists as Stra
vinsky, Rubenstein, Horowitz, Solo
vieff, and Francescatti.
When the season starts a clearing
house will be set up in the A.S.S.U.
office, where tickets for individual
concerts may be turned in by sea
son ticket holders who do not plan
to use them. They will thereupon
be resold at the same price they
were purchased.
Tickets may be obtained now
from the A.S.S.U. office or from rep
resentatives in the individual living
groups.
