# 'Our Wife' Lends Comedy To Eternal Triangle Plot
## 
### 
"Our Wife," starring Melvyn Douglas, Ruth llusscy, and Ellen Drew,
now playing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
"Our Wife" is a gay sophisticated comedy, which involves the prin- J
ciples, a trumpet-playing composer, his ex-wife, and the always smooth
llulh Husscy, the third woman in the case, in a somewhat involved hut ,

very intriguing plot.
y It all begins when Douglas, after j
a hard night in Panama, is brought |
back to the steamer by Miss Husscy
and her pals as an act of kindness to
an irresponsible fellow passenger; a
very innocent beginning for the fire
works which ensue when our hero
wakes up the next morning and re
alizes that he only had passage as
far as Panama.
ERROR STARTS ACTION
Much disturbed by their mistake
and much upbraided by the unfor
tunate victim, Miss Hussey and her
associates hastily offer to send him I
back when they get to Havana. He
repents his rudeness when it is time
for him to leave and so offers to
have his benefactors use his house
in New York while he is away.
Taking him up on the offer, his
guests arrive, much amazed to hear
; the hesitant tooting of a trumpet is
suing from within. The erstwhile
composer has decided he didn't want
to go back to Panama after all, but
would rather come back to Miss
Hussey and the symphony which he
I is writing.
The symphony is given in Carne
gie Hall, where his fiance cleverly
meets his first wife when both, late
for the performance, are forced to
listen from the foyer. When the
| symphony is a success, first wife de- j
| cides hubby is pretty good after all j
I and goes to his home to await his !
return from the theater.
FALL COMPLICATES PLOT
When he informs her that he is j
going to marry someone else, she j
falls downstairs and is suddenly af- ;
dieted with a paralysis which makes
it impossible to move her. Suspect
ing some underhand goings-on, Miss
j Husscy spends most of the rest of
j ihe picture thinking up schemes to
' make Miss Drew forget herself and
j walk.
Just as it begins to appear as if
| the ex-wife is going to triumph,
j Miss Hussey conveniently sets the
house on fire and has to carry her
rival out because of her "affliction."
J But don't get discouraged; some-
I thing happens while the firemen are
I spewing water on the fire, and Miss
' Hussey gets her man.
If you like clever dialogue and a
| new angle on the eternal triangle
and want a thoroughly amusing and
pleasant evening or afternoon of di
version, you will find it in "Our
Wife." Then too, it is supplemented
; by a fairly interesting second fea-
I ture, "Parachute Battalion." â€” Craig
