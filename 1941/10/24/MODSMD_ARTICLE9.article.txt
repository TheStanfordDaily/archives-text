# Huskies Ready For Stanford Pass Offense
## Kmetovic, Meiners Will Play; Mitchell, Armstrong Doubtful 
### DON SELBY 
The Daily Sports Editor
With Pete Kmetovic, Arnie Mein
ers, and Hank Norberg, last week's
sick list hoys, in the fold, Stanford's
cver-so-detennined gridders, !»8 j
strong, entrained yesterday after- I
noon for the Northwest and the
Washington-Indian Battle of Seattle.]
But it wasn't just a train ride that 1
the Indians had yesterday, for Clark
Shaughnessy sent his charges!
through a grueling three-hour drill '
before the departure, figuring that i
it was the last good workout the 1
boys would engage in before the ;
all-important game.
Adding a sad tinge to an other
wise happy picture of the practice
session was the fact that Eric Arm
strong and Bob Mitchell, a pair of
halfback reserves, watched the final j
heavy practice session from the side- |
lines because of leg injuries. It was j
expected, however, that both boys I
would be ready to go by game time, i
Upon Armstrong's ability to play j
in this ball game depends a great
deal, for in the backfield set-up now
employed by the upward climbing
Cards, the sawed-off speed-burner
replaces Kmetovic, who is hardly ex
pected to go the route because of|
the back injury which kept him out
of the U.S.F. game last week.
Feature of yesterday's workout j
was the concentrated practice on
the passing phase of the Big Red
Machine's offensive game. With Ail-
American Frankie Albert pitching at
his best and the pass receivers feint
ing imaginary defensive backs out
of position through fine basketball
maneuvering, the drill gave evidence
that, regardless of the weather, the
Indians will give Washington's ae
rial defense a good working over.
And it is this phase of the game
that appears to be giving Jimmy
Phelan and his Huskies the most
worry—what with Albert's great
throwing record this year and the
memory of how the Cards came from
behind to cop last year's Husky-
Redskin game.
HUSKIES FORGET?
It is quite possible, however, that
in emphasizing methods of stopping
Stanford's aerial attack, the Huskies
are neglecting something. In most
of the games that the Indians have
played this year, they have used a
style similar to the one that took
them to the Rose Bowl last season.
These are the games that Washing
ton has scouted. But with a back
field that has, besides Albert and
Kmetovic, Milt Vucinich and Bill
Sheller, the Indians are quite likely
to break out with a real power of
fense, something that was lacking in
the Oregon, U.C.LA., and Oregon
State battles.
If Phelan's boys aren't looking for
that, the surprise may be too great
for them. If they are watching for it,
the great power generated by the
driving legs of Vucinich and Sheller
and the ever-present deception of
the Stanford attack may still over
whelm the Huskies.
There is every reason to believe
that the ofTense that has made the
Stanfords the number one team in
ground gaining in the Pacific Coast
Conference will be even better to
morrow. We base that belief on j
these factors:
FOUR FACTORS
1. Shaughnessy has switched his !
men around in such a manner that
he can now field the best backs in
the same quartet, namely Albert,
Kmetovic, Sheller, and Vucinich.
2. If Armstrong is able to go at
top speed, as the coaches say he
will, there will be a much more ef
fective replacement for Kmetovic.
since Hoot now spells Kmet instead
of starting at right half.
3. The team's attitude, although it ;
has never been bad, will be tops for
tomorrow's contest, simply because
the boys know that the success of
their season depends upon the out- |
come of the game. The pressure is ;
on, and the "Wow Boys, Version
1941" are the type of ball players j
who go best when the chips are
down.
4. Most of the injuries that have
hampered the Indians from game to
game have been cleared up, and
Stanford's luck in this department is
about due for an about-face.
These factors deal mostly with
the backfield, for it is there that
most of the changes have been oc
curring. Aside from the left end
spot, the great line, which has been
more than a little responsible for
Stanford's good showing to date, has
held intact since the opening con
test. The only change there is the
gradual improvement of boys who
were already top-notch ball players.
With Meiners and Norberg back
in condition to take over the duties
at the left flank, the prospects are
bright for tomorrow to see Stanford
play its best football game to date.
WASHINGTON FAVORED
Although Shaughnessy says that
Washington is the favorite in his
book, the reported loss of Jack
Stackpool threatens to weaken the
Huskies considerably.
No matter what angle you take
on it, two things are certain: the
game is a "crucial" in every sense
of the word: and the teams stack up
as being very, very evently matched.
The Stanford traveling squad is
composed of: Frank Albert, Eric
Armstrong, Bruno Banducci, Lee
Bickenbach, Brubaker, A1 Cole. Jim
Cox, Bob Crane, Bob Ditlevsen, Ray
Durham, Jack Francis, Buck Faw
cett, Henry Hege, Ed Johanessen,

expected, however, that both boys I
would be ready to go by game time, i
Upon Armstrong's ability to play j
in this ball game depends a great
deal, for in the backfield set-up now
employed by the upward climbing
Cards, the sawed-off speed-burner
replaces Kmetovic, who is hardly ex
pected to go the route because of|
the back injury which kept him out
of the U.S.F. game last week.
Feature of yesterday's workout j
was the concentrated practice on
the passing phase of the Big Red
Machine's offensive game. With Ail-
American Frankie Albert pitching at
his best and the pass receivers feint
ing imaginary defensive backs out
of position through fine basketball
maneuvering, the drill gave evidence
that, regardless of the weather, the
Indians will give Washington's ae
rial defense a good working over.
And it is this phase of the game
that appears to be giving Jimmy
Phelan and his Huskies the most
worry—what with Albert's great
throwing record this year and the
memory of how the Cards came from
behind to cop last year's Husky-
Redskin game.
HUSKIES FORGET?
It is quite possible, however, that
in emphasizing methods of stopping
Stanford's aerial attack, the Huskies
are neglecting something. In most
of the games that the Indians have
played this year, they have used a
style similar to the one that took
them to the Rose Bowl last season.
These are the games that Washing
ton has scouted. But with a back
field that has, besides Albert and
Kmetovic, Milt Vucinich and Bill
Sheller, the Indians are quite likely
to break out with a real power of
fense, something that was lacking in
the Oregon, U.C.LA., and Oregon
State battles.
If Phelan's boys aren't looking for
that, the surprise may be too great
for them. If they are watching for it,
the great power generated by the
driving legs of Vucinich and Sheller
and the ever-present deception of
the Stanford attack may still over
whelm the Huskies.
There is every reason to believe
that the ofTense that has made the
Stanfords the number one team in
ground gaining in the Pacific Coast
Conference will be even better to
morrow. We base that belief on j
these factors:
FOUR FACTORS
1. Shaughnessy has switched his !
men around in such a manner that
he can now field the best backs in
the same quartet, namely Albert,
Kmetovic, Sheller, and Vucinich.
2. If Armstrong is able to go at
top speed, as the coaches say he
will, there will be a much more ef
fective replacement for Kmetovic.
since Hoot now spells Kmet instead
of starting at right half.
3. The team's attitude, although it ;
has never been bad, will be tops for
tomorrow's contest, simply because
the boys know that the success of
their season depends upon the out- |
come of the game. The pressure is ;
on, and the "Wow Boys, Version
1941" are the type of ball players j
who go best when the chips are
down.
4. Most of the injuries that have
hampered the Indians from game to
game have been cleared up, and
Stanford's luck in this department is
about due for an about-face.
These factors deal mostly with
the backfield, for it is there that
most of the changes have been oc
curring. Aside from the left end
spot, the great line, which has been
more than a little responsible for
Stanford's good showing to date, has
held intact since the opening con
test. The only change there is the
gradual improvement of boys who
were already top-notch ball players.
With Meiners and Norberg back
in condition to take over the duties
at the left flank, the prospects are
bright for tomorrow to see Stanford
play its best football game to date.
WASHINGTON FAVORED
Although Shaughnessy says that
Washington is the favorite in his
book, the reported loss of Jack
Stackpool threatens to weaken the
Huskies considerably.
No matter what angle you take
on it, two things are certain: the
game is a "crucial" in every sense
of the word: and the teams stack up
as being very, very evently matched.

worry—what with Albert's great
throwing record this year and the
memory of how the Cards came from
behind to cop last year's Husky-
Redskin game.
HUSKIES FORGET?
It is quite possible, however, that
in emphasizing methods of stopping
Stanford's aerial attack, the Huskies
are neglecting something. In most
of the games that the Indians have
played this year, they have used a
style similar to the one that took
them to the Rose Bowl last season.
These are the games that Washing
ton has scouted. But with a back
field that has, besides Albert and
Kmetovic, Milt Vucinich and Bill
Sheller, the Indians are quite likely
to break out with a real power of
fense, something that was lacking in
the Oregon, U.C.LA., and Oregon
State battles.
If Phelan's boys aren't looking for
that, the surprise may be too great
for them. If they are watching for it,
the great power generated by the
driving legs of Vucinich and Sheller
and the ever-present deception of
the Stanford attack may still over
whelm the Huskies.
There is every reason to believe
that the ofTense that has made the
Stanfords the number one team in
ground gaining in the Pacific Coast
Conference will be even better to
morrow. We base that belief on j
these factors:
FOUR FACTORS
1. Shaughnessy has switched his !
men around in such a manner that
he can now field the best backs in
the same quartet, namely Albert,
Kmetovic, Sheller, and Vucinich.
2. If Armstrong is able to go at
top speed, as the coaches say he
will, there will be a much more ef
fective replacement for Kmetovic.
since Hoot now spells Kmet instead
of starting at right half.
3. The team's attitude, although it ;
has never been bad, will be tops for
tomorrow's contest, simply because
the boys know that the success of
their season depends upon the out- |
come of the game. The pressure is ;
on, and the "Wow Boys, Version
1941" are the type of ball players j
who go best when the chips are
down.
4. Most of the injuries that have
hampered the Indians from game to
game have been cleared up, and
Stanford's luck in this department is
about due for an about-face.
These factors deal mostly with
the backfield, for it is there that
most of the changes have been oc
curring. Aside from the left end
spot, the great line, which has been
more than a little responsible for
Stanford's good showing to date, has
held intact since the opening con
test. The only change there is the
gradual improvement of boys who
were already top-notch ball players.
With Meiners and Norberg back
in condition to take over the duties
at the left flank, the prospects are
bright for tomorrow to see Stanford
play its best football game to date.
WASHINGTON FAVORED
Although Shaughnessy says that
Washington is the favorite in his
book, the reported loss of Jack
Stackpool threatens to weaken the
Huskies considerably.
No matter what angle you take
on it, two things are certain: the
game is a "crucial" in every sense
of the word: and the teams stack up
as being very, very evently matched.
The Stanford traveling squad is
composed of: Frank Albert, Eric
Armstrong, Bruno Banducci, Lee
Bickenbach, Brubaker, A1 Cole. Jim
Cox, Bob Crane, Bob Ditlevsen, Ray

driving legs of Vucinich and Sheller
and the ever-present deception of
the Stanford attack may still over
whelm the Huskies.
There is every reason to believe
that the ofTense that has made the
Stanfords the number one team in
ground gaining in the Pacific Coast
Conference will be even better to
morrow. We base that belief on j
these factors:
FOUR FACTORS
1. Shaughnessy has switched his !
men around in such a manner that
he can now field the best backs in
the same quartet, namely Albert,
Kmetovic, Sheller, and Vucinich.
2. If Armstrong is able to go at
top speed, as the coaches say he
will, there will be a much more ef
fective replacement for Kmetovic.
since Hoot now spells Kmet instead
of starting at right half.
3. The team's attitude, although it ;
has never been bad, will be tops for
tomorrow's contest, simply because
the boys know that the success of
their season depends upon the out- |
come of the game. The pressure is ;
on, and the "Wow Boys, Version
1941" are the type of ball players j
who go best when the chips are
down.
4. Most of the injuries that have
hampered the Indians from game to
game have been cleared up, and
Stanford's luck in this department is
about due for an about-face.
These factors deal mostly with
the backfield, for it is there that
most of the changes have been oc
curring. Aside from the left end
spot, the great line, which has been
more than a little responsible for
Stanford's good showing to date, has
held intact since the opening con
test. The only change there is the
gradual improvement of boys who
were already top-notch ball players.
With Meiners and Norberg back
in condition to take over the duties
at the left flank, the prospects are
bright for tomorrow to see Stanford
play its best football game to date.
WASHINGTON FAVORED
Although Shaughnessy says that
Washington is the favorite in his
book, the reported loss of Jack
Stackpool threatens to weaken the
Huskies considerably.
No matter what angle you take
on it, two things are certain: the
game is a "crucial" in every sense
of the word: and the teams stack up
as being very, very evently matched.
The Stanford traveling squad is
composed of: Frank Albert, Eric
Armstrong, Bruno Banducci, Lee
Bickenbach, Brubaker, A1 Cole. Jim
Cox, Bob Crane, Bob Ditlevsen, Ray
Durham, Jack Francis, Buck Faw
cett, Henry Hege, Ed Johanessen,
Pete Kmetovic, Loren LaPrade, Rog
er Laverty. Vic Lindskog, Bob Mas
tin, Bill Mannon, Arnold Meiners,
Fred Meyer. Ed McCain, Bob Mitch
ell, Bob Millington, Ben Morrison,
Hank Norberg, Dave Patterson. Ken
Robesky, Kelly Ross, Darwin See
ley, Jack Smith, Doug Stahle, Bill
Symes, Ed Stamm, Bill Sheller,
Chuck Taylor, and Milt Vucinich.

With Pete Kmetovic, Arnie Mein
ers, and Hank Norberg, last week's
sick list hoys, in the fold, Stanford's
cver-so-detennined gridders, !»8 j
strong, entrained yesterday after- I
noon for the Northwest and the
Washington-Indian Battle of Seattle.]
But it wasn't just a train ride that 1
the Indians had yesterday, for Clark
Shaughnessy sent his charges!
through a grueling three-hour drill '
before the departure, figuring that i
it was the last good workout the 1
boys would engage in before the ;
all-important game.
Adding a sad tinge to an other
wise happy picture of the practice
session was the fact that Eric Arm
strong and Bob Mitchell, a pair of
halfback reserves, watched the final j
heavy practice session from the side- |
lines because of leg injuries. It was j
expected, however, that both boys I
would be ready to go by game time, i
Upon Armstrong's ability to play j
in this ball game depends a great
deal, for in the backfield set-up now
employed by the upward climbing
Cards, the sawed-off speed-burner
replaces Kmetovic, who is hardly ex
pected to go the route because of|
the back injury which kept him out
of the U.S.F. game last week.
Feature of yesterday's workout j
was the concentrated practice on
the passing phase of the Big Red
Machine's offensive game. With Ail-
American Frankie Albert pitching at
his best and the pass receivers feint
ing imaginary defensive backs out
of position through fine basketball
maneuvering, the drill gave evidence
that, regardless of the weather, the
Indians will give Washington's ae
rial defense a good working over.
And it is this phase of the game
that appears to be giving Jimmy
Phelan and his Huskies the most
worry—what with Albert's great
throwing record this year and the
memory of how the Cards came from
behind to cop last year's Husky-
Redskin game.
HUSKIES FORGET?
It is quite possible, however, that
in emphasizing methods of stopping
Stanford's aerial attack, the Huskies
are neglecting something. In most
of the games that the Indians have
played this year, they have used a
style similar to the one that took
them to the Rose Bowl last season.
These are the games that Washing
ton has scouted. But with a back
field that has, besides Albert and
Kmetovic, Milt Vucinich and Bill
Sheller, the Indians are quite likely
to break out with a real power of
fense, something that was lacking in
the Oregon, U.C.LA., and Oregon
State battles.
If Phelan's boys aren't looking for
that, the surprise may be too great
for them. If they are watching for it,
the great power generated by the
driving legs of Vucinich and Sheller
and the ever-present deception of
the Stanford attack may still over
whelm the Huskies.
There is every reason to believe
that the ofTense that has made the
