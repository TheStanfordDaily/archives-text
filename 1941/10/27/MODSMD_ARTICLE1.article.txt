### AMIE REICHERT 
"I. a Citizen of the Great Soviet Union,
and a true son ol the heroic Russian
people, swear 1 wilt not lay down my
arms until the last Fascist in our terri
tory is destroyed.
"1 swear I will carry out the orders
ol my commanders without question and
observe strict military discipline.
"For damaging our villages and coun
try. lor the death of our children and
for the terror and tortures inflicted on
my people, 1 swear to avenge myself bit
terly, mercilessly, and ceaselessly on
the enemy.
"1 will take an eye lor an eye and a
tooth lor a tooth.
"I swear I would rather die in bitter
fight than allow myself and my family
or the Soviet people to become Fascist
slaves. 11 by my weakness or cowardice
or by ill fate I break this vow and be
tray the interests of my people, let me
die the traitor's death at the hands of
my comrades."

YESTERDAY the valiant guerrilla
fighters of the Red Army had
good reason to remember this oath,
and to rededicate themselves to
eternal resistance, for on all fronts
the Red Army was hurled back by
the smashing, crashing Nazi mili
tary might.
On the central front, it was re
ported that German panzer and
infantry divisions had broken
through "on a broad front" in the
sector before Moscow. This Ber
lin communique was not con
finned by the Russians, however,
they acknowledged the despera
tion and danger of the situation.
The greatest threat—from point of
actual loss in materiel—was in the
South where the Germans had en
circled, if not captured, the great
industrial region of Kharkov and
the Donets Basin, and were ham
mering at Rostov.

r | I IIE loss of this section would be
a terrible blow to the entire
Russian war effort. The Donets Basin
is the center of a vast organization
of metallurgical, steel, and engineer
ing factories, power plants, and coal
mines.
Rostov guards the strategic rail
way which carries Soviet oil from
the Caucasus to the armies of Rus
sia. German shock troops were re
ported storming that city yester
day, and it was admitted by Mos
cow radio that the danger was
grave.
German divisions were being re
inforced by a constant stream of
equipment, the Russians said. An
earlier communique from Moscow
had said that in virtually all sec
tors the Germans were repulsed, that
their losses were so great they were
towing wooden tanks behind real
ones to conceal the shortage.
But no amount of sugar-coating
or propagandized optimism could
conceal the fact that the whole
South of Western Russia is se
riously threatened, and thereby a
great percentage of Russia's oil, in
dustries, and arsenals.
From Rostov—the crossroads of
the Southern front—the Germans
might choose either of two routes: a
southward swing to the oil-rich
Batum-Baku area, or straight east
to Astrakhan, at the mouth of the
Volga on the Caspian Sea.

| N the case of the first, there is the
probability that they would have
to encounter Wavell's British-Indian
armies which have massed in Iran.
It is reported in authoritative circles
that Britain is prepared to fight for
the Caucasian oil fields.

But should (he Nazis continue di
rectly east and the Red Army con
tinue to fall back, the Germans
could succeed in cutting off the
whole Caucasian isthmus from West
ern Russia.
If the Nazis do, they will cut off
all Allied aid coming to Russia
now through the Caucasus, and
leave only Archangel as a port for
supplies, since the use of Vladi
vostok has been abandoned.

Budenny and Voroshilov are fe
verishly reorganizing and re-equip
ping new armies.

Wth the loss of the Donets indus
trial might, aid from Britain and the
U.S. is becoming not a matter of
convenience but an absolute essen
tial.
