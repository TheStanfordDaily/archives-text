WASHINGTON, Oct. 2<» (UP;. — I
President Roosevelt tonight called ;
on President John L. Lewis of the j
United Mine Workers (CIO) <(» re- !
scind his order for a strike at "cap
tive" coal mines owned by steel j
companies and to confer with My
ron C. Taylor, former chairman of j
U. S. Steel, in an effort to reach "a
peaceful solution" of the dispute.
In a letter to Lewis, Mr. Roose
velt pointed out that the "uninter
rupted production of coal for mak
ing of steel" is essential to the entire
defense program.
It has been estimated that the ]
walkout, technically effective last
midnight, would affect steel output
materially within 10 days. A steel
failure would cripple seriously the
entire rearmament effort.
