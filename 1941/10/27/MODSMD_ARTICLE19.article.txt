# What Makes Stanford Run?
## Informal Program Slated for Wed. Night 
### 
Does the corp yard make a prac
'ticc of tearing lip the roads every
year? Are the used books in the
Bookstore priced correctly in re
spect to those in the co-op? What
makes Stanford run?
Pat Adams, vice-president of the
A.S.S.U., urged everyone to come to
the Activities Forum on Wednesday,
October 20, at 7:30 p.m. in the Edu
cation auditorium. She went on to
say that it was a fine chance to find
out how the activities at Stanford
function.
"Don't forget to think up a lot of
questions to bring to the meeting so
there will be plenty of activity after
the speeches are over," Pat Adams
cautioned.
The Activities Forum is a pro
gram designed to clear up some of
the cloudiness and questions about
the many activities at Stanford, she
said.

AI Masters will discuss the B.A.C.
and its relation to the Stanford com
munity. Bones Hamilton will rep
resent the alumni. Bill Smith, as
sistant director of the corporation
yard, will really try to show that
there is some good in the years of
torn-up roads. Frank F. Walker,
financial vice-president of the Uni
versity, will talk on the Bookstore,
the co-op and the Union Board of
Governors. Paul Davis, recently ap
pointed secretary of the University,
will give a summary of the campus
activities, and George Jackson,
A.S.S.U. president, will discuss with
the help Â°f a blackboard "The Inte
gration of the Various Activities at
Stanford."
"The speeches arc going to be no
longer than five minutes and we
are going to have Bob Reiser and
Tray Galliano play some of their
boogie-woogie. It is going to be a
good informat program," P;tt Adams
promised.
