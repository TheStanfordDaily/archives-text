### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
The Stanford student body's icy
attitude toward interference in the
present war—a sentiment pre
dominant in past years—has melt
ed to warm support of an aid-to
the-allies policy for the United
States.

In the Daily poll conducted last
Friday noon, 37 per cent of the
students voted for alternative No.
3; "While at first it looked as
though this was not our war, it
now looks as though we should
back England until Hitler is beat
en."

In addition, 24 per cent support
ed No. 2; "A lot of mistakes have
brought us close to a war that
isn't ours but now that it's done
we should support in full the gov
ernment's program."
However, one out of every four
voters checked No. 1; "Those who
think this is our war are 'wrong
.. .resist any move that would lead
us further into war."
One out of every ten students
asked for a declaration of war';

"It is our war as well as England's
and we should have been in there
lighting with her before this."
Four per cent of the voters in
dicated they were undecided.
In the poll conducted during the
noon hour last Friday in every
campus eating group and Palo Alto
restaurants, 2,267 students ex
pressed opinions. Tabulated re
sults may be seen in the Daily
Shack.
By oral and written criticism,
many students indicated that none
of the statements represented their
opinions.
Luke-warm isolationists said
they were forced into the die-hard
isolation stand of No. 1 or had to
support No. 2, with which they
were not in full agreement.
A few mild interventionists re
ported they would support the ad
ministration's policy as long as a
"shooting war" is not on the pro
gram.
Women favored statements No.
2 and 3 more strongly than the
men. Conversely, more men voted

the isolationist No. 1 than women.
The tabulation follows:
Question Men Women
(%) (%)
No. 1 28 18
No. 2 22 28
No. 3 36 40
No. 4 9 11
No. 5 5 3
A breakdown of the men's votes
by class reveals another trend.
Upperclass men are more in fa
vor of isolationism than frosh or
sophomores. Graduate men, how
ever, voted in between the two
groups, from which may be in
ferred that they are less in dan
ger of being drafted than upper
class men. (Most graduates now
attending school are exempt for
defense or other reasons.)

Many students explained their
choices by written comment.
Representative of one school of
comment is, "Protect our shores,
no foreign advancement."
Another declared, "Declare war
now."
Other comments:
"This war is as vital to us as to
England, but I feel the best way
to aid Britain is economically,
which implies efficiency in Amer
ican industries."
"Build up our own defenses;
consider Britain's secondly."
"Support England and Russia
with materials."
"None of the statements express
my stand."
"The war, since the start, has
been of vital importance to us."
"We do not want war! Young
Americans have been trained for
a better life than that."
"We should give Russia all pos

hell."

been of vital importance to us."
"We do not want war! Young
Americans have been trained for
a better life than that."
"We should give Russia all pos
sible aid and let England go to
hell."
The Stanford student body's icy
attitude toward interference in the
present war—a sentiment pre
dominant in past years—has melt
ed to warm support of an aid-to
the-allies policy for the United
States.

In the Daily poll conducted last
Friday noon, 37 per cent of the
students voted for alternative No.
3; "While at first it looked as
though this was not our war, it
now looks as though we should
back England until Hitler is beat
en."

In addition, 24 per cent support
ed No. 2; "A lot of mistakes have
brought us close to a war that
isn't ours but now that it's done
we should support in full the gov
ernment's program."
However, one out of every four
voters checked No. 1; "Those who
think this is our war are 'wrong
.. .resist any move that would lead
us further into war."
One out of every ten students
asked for a declaration of war';

"It is our war as well as England's
and we should have been in there
lighting with her before this."
Four per cent of the voters in
dicated they were undecided.
In the poll conducted during the
noon hour last Friday in every
campus eating group and Palo Alto
restaurants, 2,267 students ex
pressed opinions. Tabulated re
sults may be seen in the Daily
Shack.
By oral and written criticism,
many students indicated that none
of the statements represented their
opinions.
Luke-warm isolationists said
they were forced into the die-hard
isolation stand of No. 1 or had to
support No. 2, with which they
were not in full agreement.
A few mild interventionists re
ported they would support the ad
ministration's policy as long as a
"shooting war" is not on the pro
gram.
Women favored statements No.
2 and 3 more strongly than the
men. Conversely, more men voted

the isolationist No. 1 than women.
The tabulation follows:
Question Men Women
(%) (%)
No. 1 28 18
No. 2 22 28
No. 3 36 40
No. 4 9 11
No. 5 5 3
A breakdown of the men's votes
by class reveals another trend.
Upperclass men are more in fa
vor of isolationism than frosh or
sophomores. Graduate men, how
ever, voted in between the two
groups, from which may be in
ferred that they are less in dan
ger of being drafted than upper
class men. (Most graduates now
attending school are exempt for
defense or other reasons.)
Tabulation of the men's opin
ions follows. (All figures are listed
percentages.)

Many students explained their
choices by written comment.
Representative of one school of
comment is, "Protect our shores,
no foreign advancement."
Another declared, "Declare war
now."
Other comments:
"This war is as vital to us as to
England, but I feel the best way
to aid Britain is economically,
which implies efficiency in Amer
ican industries."
"Build up our own defenses;
consider Britain's secondly."
"Support England and Russia
with materials."
"None of the statements express
my stand."
"The war, since the start, has
been of vital importance to us."
"We do not want war! Young
Americans have been trained for
a better life than that."
"We should give Russia all pos
sible aid and let England go to
hell."
