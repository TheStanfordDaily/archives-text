# Indians' Win Plus Upsets Give Cards New Lease In P.C.C. Gridiron Picture
## Huskies' Defeat and U. of O Losses Return Rosy View of Bowl Trip; W.S.C., Cal Last Bumps On Road 
### HAP EVERETT 
'llie Coast Conference picture took on a brilliant cardinal hue this
week-end as Stanford's Indians defeated the University of Washington
while all other applicants for the job of Rose Bowl host fell by the wayside.
Stanford was installed, half-heartedly, as underdog last week; hut al
most everyone had a hunch that the Cards, after two poor games, were

fourth contender, was removed from
the race by the up-and-down Bruins
of U.C.L.A. and just by way of
build-up for the Big Game, Cal ran
over U.S.C. 14-0.
If all this isn't enough, the only
undefeated team on the Coast, Santa
Clara, was bowled over by Indian
Jack Jacobs and his Oklahoma com
patriots 16-6.
ROSE BOWL BOUND
At this point it would seem that
Stanford definitely has the inside
track to the Rose Bowl, for the In
dians are over the toughest teams
on the schedule. Two unpredictable
foes, however, served notice that,
they were going to make trouble for
Stanford next month. Without
throwing a single pass, Washington
State powered 86 yards through
that tough Oregon State line for a
touchdown and went on to run up al
most 300 yards with Billy Sewell do
ing most of the ball-handling. At
Berkeley, the Bears showed great
defensive strength in bottling up
Paul Taylor and Bob Robertson, and,
as usual, the Bears improve as the
season goes along.

Frank Albert left a deep Impres
sion on the Northwest. The Seattle
boys had heard of the Old Left-
Hander's brainy headwork as field
general, his deft kicking-to-touch,
and his uncanny passing ability; but
new to the northerners was Albert's
tricky runing style, which set up
Stanford's first touchdown. Frank,
back to pass on his own forty, could
not find a receiver, and with the
help of a strategic block by Ed
Stamm, ran all the way to the Wash
ington six, where ho tired and was
cut down by Don Means. Will Shel
ler hit the line for two and Milt
Vucinich packed it over on the next
play.
CHUCK TAYLOR INSPIRED
Later in the second quarter, Chuck
Taylor, who played an inspired game
at guard, pounced on Barrett's fum
ble three yards from the Husky goal.
On the third play Sheller knifed
through the line for Stanford's sec
ond touchdown, Albert adding the
conversion this time.
Everyone thought Ernie Steelr
would be slowed down after a vicious
tackle by Freddie Meyer but tho
speedy half came back into the game
and rammed over a touchdown late
in the third quarter. Steele re
turned Albert's punt 24 yards to the
Stanford 30, circled left end to t.lie
7, and took a reverse over standing
up for the score. With Steele in
there. Washington was a threat down
to the last minute.
In that last quarter Stanford
played fine football. Pete Kmetovic
squirmed his way for GO yards on a
punt return only to have the touch
down called back and a clipping pen
ally slapped on the Indians. A few
plays later, Freddie Meyer grabbed
a 40-yard pass from Albert, stepping
into the end zone while the defend
ers were trying to figure out how he
caught the ball. But Dutch Conlan
and his little gang of officials got
together and decided to carry on
the tradition of northern referees
established by Bob Morris, and can
celed this score too. Fired up by
this discouraging legislation, Stan
ford finished strong.
After the game, Phelan singled
out Shcller and Loren LaPrade as
the big factors in Stanford's im
provement. Sheller hit Harrison on
the uoal line like a ton of cement,
temporarily cooling the big Husky
center. The game was clean cut and
tough, and Stanford came out in
good shape. The team arrives from
the north about 10:30 this morning.

the race by the up-and-down Bruins
of U.C.L.A. and just by way of
build-up for the Big Game, Cal ran
over U.S.C. 14-0.
If all this isn't enough, the only
undefeated team on the Coast, Santa
Clara, was bowled over by Indian
Jack Jacobs and his Oklahoma com

ROSE BOWL BOUND
At this point it would seem that
Stanford definitely has the inside
track to the Rose Bowl, for the In
dians are over the toughest teams
on the schedule. Two unpredictable
foes, however, served notice that,
they were going to make trouble for
Stanford next month. Without
throwing a single pass, Washington
State powered 86 yards through
that tough Oregon State line for a
touchdown and went on to run up al
most 300 yards with Billy Sewell do
ing most of the ball-handling. At
Berkeley, the Bears showed great
defensive strength in bottling up
Paul Taylor and Bob Robertson, and,
as usual, the Bears improve as the
season goes along.

Frank Albert left a deep Impres
sion on the Northwest. The Seattle
boys had heard of the Old Left-
Hander's brainy headwork as field
general, his deft kicking-to-touch,
and his uncanny passing ability; but
new to the northerners was Albert's
tricky runing style, which set up
Stanford's first touchdown. Frank,
back to pass on his own forty, could
not find a receiver, and with the
help of a strategic block by Ed
Stamm, ran all the way to the Wash
ington six, where ho tired and was
cut down by Don Means. Will Shel
ler hit the line for two and Milt
Vucinich packed it over on the next
play.
CHUCK TAYLOR INSPIRED
Later in the second quarter, Chuck
Taylor, who played an inspired game
at guard, pounced on Barrett's fum
ble three yards from the Husky goal.
On the third play Sheller knifed
through the line for Stanford's sec
ond touchdown, Albert adding the
conversion this time.
Everyone thought Ernie Steelr
would be slowed down after a vicious
tackle by Freddie Meyer but tho
speedy half came back into the game
and rammed over a touchdown late
in the third quarter. Steele re
turned Albert's punt 24 yards to the
Stanford 30, circled left end to t.lie
7, and took a reverse over standing
up for the score. With Steele in
there. Washington was a threat down
to the last minute.
In that last quarter Stanford
played fine football. Pete Kmetovic
squirmed his way for GO yards on a
punt return only to have the touch
down called back and a clipping pen
ally slapped on the Indians. A few
plays later, Freddie Meyer grabbed
a 40-yard pass from Albert, stepping
into the end zone while the defend
ers were trying to figure out how he
caught the ball. But Dutch Conlan
and his little gang of officials got
together and decided to carry on
the tradition of northern referees

plays later, Freddie Meyer grabbed
a 40-yard pass from Albert, stepping
into the end zone while the defend
ers were trying to figure out how he
caught the ball. But Dutch Conlan
and his little gang of officials got
together and decided to carry on
the tradition of northern referees
established by Bob Morris, and can
celed this score too. Fired up by
this discouraging legislation, Stan
ford finished strong.
After the game, Phelan singled
out Shcller and Loren LaPrade as
the big factors in Stanford's im
provement. Sheller hit Harrison on
the uoal line like a ton of cement,
temporarily cooling the big Husky
center. The game was clean cut and
tough, and Stanford came out in
good shape. The team arrives from

fourth contender, was removed from
the race by the up-and-down Bruins
of U.C.L.A. and just by way of
build-up for the Big Game, Cal ran
over U.S.C. 14-0.
If all this isn't enough, the only
undefeated team on the Coast, Santa
Clara, was bowled over by Indian
Jack Jacobs and his Oklahoma com
patriots 16-6.
ROSE BOWL BOUND
At this point it would seem that
Stanford definitely has the inside
track to the Rose Bowl, for the In
dians are over the toughest teams
on the schedule. Two unpredictable
foes, however, served notice that,
they were going to make trouble for
Stanford next month. Without
throwing a single pass, Washington
State powered 86 yards through
that tough Oregon State line for a
touchdown and went on to run up al
most 300 yards with Billy Sewell do
ing most of the ball-handling. At
Berkeley, the Bears showed great
defensive strength in bottling up
Paul Taylor and Bob Robertson, and,
as usual, the Bears improve as the
season goes along.

Frank Albert left a deep Impres
sion on the Northwest. The Seattle
boys had heard of the Old Left-
Hander's brainy headwork as field
general, his deft kicking-to-touch,
and his uncanny passing ability; but
new to the northerners was Albert's
tricky runing style, which set up
Stanford's first touchdown. Frank,
back to pass on his own forty, could
not find a receiver, and with the
help of a strategic block by Ed
Stamm, ran all the way to the Wash
ington six, where ho tired and was
cut down by Don Means. Will Shel
ler hit the line for two and Milt
Vucinich packed it over on the next
play.
CHUCK TAYLOR INSPIRED
Later in the second quarter, Chuck
Taylor, who played an inspired game
at guard, pounced on Barrett's fum
ble three yards from the Husky goal.
On the third play Sheller knifed
through the line for Stanford's sec
ond touchdown, Albert adding the
conversion this time.
Everyone thought Ernie Steelr
would be slowed down after a vicious
tackle by Freddie Meyer but tho
speedy half came back into the game
and rammed over a touchdown late
in the third quarter. Steele re
turned Albert's punt 24 yards to the
Stanford 30, circled left end to t.lie
7, and took a reverse over standing
up for the score. With Steele in
there. Washington was a threat down
to the last minute.
In that last quarter Stanford
played fine football. Pete Kmetovic
squirmed his way for GO yards on a
punt return only to have the touch
down called back and a clipping pen
ally slapped on the Indians. A few
plays later, Freddie Meyer grabbed
a 40-yard pass from Albert, stepping
into the end zone while the defend
