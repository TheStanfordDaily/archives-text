# Red Cross Drive Raises Goal Due to National Emergency
## Memberships Will Be on Sale In All Campus Living Groups 
### 
Due to tlif national emergency the goal of Stanford's annual Red Cross
drive, slated for Nov. 3-7, will be raised to $1150, Chairman Betsy Paulson
announced last night. This is 15 per cent above last year's mark of $1000.
The additional $150 will go toward the establishment of Red Cross
headquarters in army camps throughout the country. Memberships in the
Red Cross will be sold in all livings

groups ou the campus.
In addition to the establishment
of headquarters in the camps, the
money will also be used to train
nurses for both peace and wartime
duty. Funds will also go toward the
production of surgical dressings and
the obtaining of blood donors.
A portion of the money is em
ployed in training civilians in first
aid work. One of the Rod Cross
first-aid classes is held at Stanford
under Dr. Pryor in the Women's
Gym.
"This year, more than ever, the
Red Cross needs the funds," Chair
man Paulson said. "With a tremen
dous number of draftees now in the
army, the establishment of head
quarters in the camps is more im
perative than ever. In addition to
this increased burden, all the other
needs still exist.
"Jt might be a good idea to start
laying some money aside for the
drive right now," she suggested.
"The drive starts next Monday and
that's not so far off. If that's done,
you will have the money when they
ask you for it."
Committee heads for the various
living groups were also announced
last night. The drive at Lagunita
will be headed by Emily Frank, and
Ann Clare Brokaw will be in charge
of raising funds at Roble. Bob Crary
will head the drive at Encina, Joe
McKellar at Sequoia, and Jack Eu
phrat at Toyon.
Men's chairman will be Harry
Morgan, and women's chairman will
be Nancy Haskins. Names of com
mittee members will be released la
ter this week.
The drive is under the jurisdic
tion of Cardinals.
