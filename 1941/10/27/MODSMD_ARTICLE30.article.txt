morrow's Tuesday Evening Series
program by Deane Dickason, who
returned to the United States from
Batavia Oct. 20 after a 29-day zig
zag sea voyage across the Pacific
dodging raiders.
Mr. Dickason, as neweaster for the
Columbia Broadcasting System, cor
respondent for the New York Times,
and cameraman for Pathe and Para
mount newsreels, has been in the
Pacific Southwest since April.
COUNTRIES AT WAR
In speaking of bis trip, Mr. Dicka
son remarked that the governments
of the Netherlands East Indies and
the British Straits Settlements af
forded every facility to observe their
countries at war.
"I have seen their formidable
military machines, inspected their
splendid economic and industrial ef
forts, many of them developed only
since the war began. I have talked
to prince and peasant, to peer and
pariah without limitation or re
straint, and my impressions are fresh
and uncensored," Mr. Dickinson
said.
DODGING RAIDERS
Sailing from Batavia on a Java
nese cargo boat laden with rubber,
under sealed orders from the Brit
ish Admiralty, route and destina
tion unannounced, Mr. Dickason
said that his ship, instead of head
ing northeast to San Francisco,
pointed southeast. Six days later
and some 2,200 miles from Batavia,
the captain of the vessel divulged
that raiders prowling the Pacific had
induced the change in routing.
The Tuesday Evening Series pro
grams are presented in Memorial
Auditorium at 7:.'!0.
