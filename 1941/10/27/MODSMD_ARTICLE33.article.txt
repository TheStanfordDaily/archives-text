# Engineers Take Night Training
## 
### 
Approximately 350 registrations
h;ive been received by Stanford's
School of Engineering for evening
classes being given as part of a na
tional defense training program.
The program, designed primarily to
overcome man shortage in produc
tion engineering, is open to men
eligible for engineering positions in
defense industries, or those already
holding such positions.
College students are not admit
ted. The courses now being given
are on a college level and include
the fields of mechanical and elec
trical engineering, physics, chem
istry, and engineering economics.
The response to the program is
much greater than expected, accord
ing to Professor Eugene L. Grant,
the institutional representative for
Stanford. Classes are numbering
more than the maximum set, and the
students are commuting from points
all over the bay area to attend.
A course in Industrial Safety En
gineering is being planned for No
vember 14, sponsored by the U. S.
Department of Labor.
