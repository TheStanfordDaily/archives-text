Once more in front in the Coast's
incredible conference race, Clark
Shaughnessy, appearing on the na
tionwide "Second Cuessers" broad
cast yesterday, declared the Wash
ington contest "was the toughest,
hardest football game we have
played in two years. You could
hear the blocks and tackles the boys
put on all over Puget Sound."
"What about that pint-sized back
field you have been talking about?"
queried Bill Leiser. San Francisco
sports editor, who was interviewing
him. "What about little Albert and
little Kmetovic?"
LITTLE FRANK AND PETE
"Little Albert and Kmetovic," an
swered Shaughnessy, "looked like
the biggest men in the football world
to me Saturday."
And after handing out bouquets
to most of his team for its 13 to 7
victory, he concluded, "I say that
Captain Art Meiners, Fred Meyer,
and Hank Norberg were really
great."
Launching into an analysis of the
Coast's upsets, the two reached the
conclusion that Oregon State lost to
Washington State 7 to 0. because it
came up against Billy Sewell, who
ran as well as he passed Saturday.
But it was not so clear to Leiser
why U.C.LA., which Stanford beat
33 to 0, was able to beat Oregon
14 to 7. Stanford had trouble in
checking the Webfeet 19 to 15.
SENSE TO FOOTBALL?
"Is there any sense to this game
you are teaching?" ho asked.
"All the sense in the world," re
plied Shaughnessy. "We arc all
evenly matched out here."
Coach Lyn Waldorf of North
western, who said his team played
its best game to date in defeating
Ohio State, gave just as simple an
explanation of Santa Clara's 16 to R
upset at the hands of Oklahoma: "I
guess Santa Clara just had a bad
day," and pointed to their two
fumbles which set up Oklahoma
touchdowns.
Leiser, in the last question on the
program, asked Shaughnessy, "Shall
I send a transport plane for you
next time so you'll feel at home?"
"I think I can steer the old car up
here," answered the coach, "that is
if Santa Clara isn't too fast for
us."
