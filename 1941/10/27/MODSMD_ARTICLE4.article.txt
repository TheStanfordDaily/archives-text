Tough defenders of Moscow con
tinued to hold some 15,000,000 Axis
troops at hay Sunday after 25 days
of reckless assault, hut in the South
a new crisis was developing with
the fall of Kharkov and a powerful
German assault on the defenses of
Rostov—gateway to the Caucasus.
Around Moscow, where Red Army
defenders claimed that one out of
every ten of the attackers had been
killed or wounded, battle lines ap
parently continued the same as a
week ago, with Russian sources still
admitting no German advance closer
than 60 miles.
A German "break through" in
the Moscow sector was claimed by
the official news agency DNB, but
the agency gave no location and offi
cial sources failed to bear out the
claim.
