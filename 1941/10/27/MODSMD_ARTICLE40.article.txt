# Business Team Dumps Zetes To Win League
## 
### 
Business School has an intra
mural football team that doesn't give
a darn about being classed as an
underdog, and they also have a back
named Bill Tweedie. Friday night
the two combined to defeat Zeta
Psi, 8 to 7, in an overtime playoff
to win the championship of League
5 and jump into the position of lead
ing contender for the Firehouse
crown.
Again it was Tweedie's passing
that brought the unheralded busi
nessmen their fourth straight win.

First he passed to Frank Dowling for
35 yards and six points. George
JedenofT passed to Dowling for the
extra.
Frank 'McCann passed to Jack
Dana for 20 yards and the Zetes
were in the game. Ace Hanlon
flipped an extra to Dick Northon.
OVERTIME PASS
Into an overtime and Tweedie be
gan flipping bullet passes to Jede
nofT for 5-10 yards. That was the
end of Zete hopes.
Business School began the year by
being an "unknown" against Kappa
Alpha but they won, 7 to 0. Then
she became a "possibility" against
Theta Xi and won 21 to 0. After
her (J to 0 win over Delta Chi she
was a "contender." Most of the
Zetes will now agree that she could
be "champ."
In the other game Delta Kappa
Epsilon forfeited to Phi Psi II to end
their season wtih 3 wins and one
loss.
LEAGUE PREVIEW

known after their mix with Theta
Delt tonight.
Kappa Sigma and Delta Tau Delta
have three wins apiece and a duel
set for Wednesday to decide League

waits for the rest of League 7 to
finish up. A.T.O. and Phi Delta Phi
have the only chance to tie them.
Sigma Nu and Alpha Delt in No.
