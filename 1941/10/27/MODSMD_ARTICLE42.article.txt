# Pettit Shows 'Big Stuff' In 26-13 Win
## 
### 
Slow to get moving, Harry Ship
key's Papooses moved up in the
stretch and won going away, 2G-13,
from a hard-running hunch of Al
hamhra Athletic Clubmen in Stan
ford Stadium Saturday afternoon.
Halfback Jim Pettit figured prom
inently in the victory and should
give returning varsity lettermen a
stifT fight for a starting berth at left
half on the varsity next year.
He scored once from the 35-yard
line on a cutback over left tackle
and again in the final period on a
pass from Cannon Parkinson.
PARKINSON CO-STARS
Quarterback Parkinson co-starred,
as he kicked out of bounds on the
A.A.C. 2-yard stripe and took the
return boot on the 40 to come back
down the field 33 yards. Pettit made
one over tackle, and fullback Dave
Pate crashed over on a cross buck.
Parkinson's kick was good.
That score came after A1 Mignnni
and Chuck DiMaggio, cousin of Joe,
had engineered a score on quick
running thrusts and a 25-yard pass
to Leo Peccianti on the yearlings
25-yard line. Mignani broke through
a big hole in the Papoose line and
scored standing up.
PAPOOSES SCORE
The Redskin babes tallied on
Pettit's first touchdown run after
Don Zappettini rolled 15 yards for a
first down on the Club 35.
The Parkinson-Pettit aerial com
bination switched places, with
Parkinson in motion this time and
Pettit throwing straight down the
middle to him for the third score
and a 19-G lead.
1)1 MAGGIO SPARKPLUG
DiMaggio sparkplugged Alham
bra to its second score to put the
Club back in the game at 19-13.
Then came Pettit's second clash to
end the scoring at 26-13.
Ross Dana started at right half
and broke away for good yardage
during the early going.
The Papoose forward wall held
like a good thing at times, and then
again let the completely radical
A.A.C. offense leave them behind on
a new bit of maneuvering.
Center Jack McCurdy knifed
through to get his man behind the
scrimmage line several times.
Next week the frosh meet San
Mateo. undefeated, untied and
probably the best squad Coach Mu
rius McFadden has had in J.C. his
tory. The following week it's the
Cal frosh, Saturday victors over
S.C., 26-0.
