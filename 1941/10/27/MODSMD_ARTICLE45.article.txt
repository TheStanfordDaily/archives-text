STANFORD'S football team, coached by the great Clark I). Shaugh
nessy, defeated Washington Universtiy. That's true.
Tlie Indians moved into an indisputable lead in ll.e heller-skelter con
ference grid campaign. That's also true.
I»ut there's cne thing that isn't true—YET. Stanford is NOT in the
Rose Bowl.

Sure, we all like to believe that
we're going to be able to spend New
Year's Day in that canyon stadium
down Pasadena way, watching our
boys do a repeat performance of
last season's great show. Perhaps
that'll happen. But, let us repeat,
the Indians aren't in yet.
It may appear that since Santa
Clara lost to Oklahoma, the Brones
aren't such a hot outfit. We doubt
that. The Broncs are going to be
an awful tough team lor Shaugh
nessy's lads to down. And we'd bel
that the Stanford grid head would
be the first to verify that.
Then, after the Santa Clara affair,
come games with U.S.C., W.S.C., and
California. This appears to be the
weak end of the Card schedule, and \
these teams aren't rated as being in ]
a class with the U. of W., Oregon,
and Oregon State. But how can you
figure anything, when a team that is
supposed to be a pushover (Wash
ington State) ups and blasts one of
the? big guns (Oregon State) litfht
out of the picture?
Babe Hollingberry's Cougars have
that same fighting chance of upset
ting the Big Red Machine.
So why don't we all just coast
along for a while—perhaps even un
til Frankie Albert and the boys
wind up the regular season with the
Cal fracas? If after that game, the
Stanfords boast three more victo
ries than they have now, it'll be
plenty of time to holler about the
Rose Bowl.
In the meantime, we can think,
and hope, can't we?

() UR
predictions that went awry
this past week-end haven't
made us unhappy in the least. We
missed on four and hit two. A poor
average, but the results made the
conference race look like this:
Won Lost
Stanford 3 1
U.C.L.A 3 2
Oregon 3 2
OS..C 2 2
U.S.C 2 2
Washington 2 2
W.S.C 2 2
California 1 2
Idaho 0 1
Montana 0 1
If Stanford loses another game this
fall, it appears that the Rose Bowl
will be a farce, for the western rep-
I resentative will necessarily be a
I Iwice defeated team. The chances
! are that the Sugar Bowl, and per
haps even the Cotton Bowl, could
wind up with a better set-up than
| that.
Something will certainly be amiss
in the football world this year if
Frank Albert doesn't repeat as an
All-American quarterback. Here on
the Farm we take the boy too much
for granted. As long as he plays his
; regular brand of ball, everything is
■ okay and little is said here about
him. If, on the other hand, he were
to fall below par just one Satur
day, you'd hear plenty about the
failure of Frank Albert, All-Amer
ican quarterback on the Stanford
football team, to come through.
The point is that he just never
does fail to come through.

Something will certainly be amiss
in the football world this year if
Frank Albert doesn't repeat as an

the Farm we take the boy too much
for granted. As long as he plays his

■ okay and little is said here about
him. If, on the other hand, he were
to fall below par just one Satur
day, you'd hear plenty about the
failure of Frank Albert, All-Amer

football team, to come through.
The point is that he just never

STANFORD'S football team, coached by the great Clark I). Shaugh
nessy, defeated Washington Universtiy. That's true.
Tlie Indians moved into an indisputable lead in ll.e heller-skelter con
ference grid campaign. That's also true.
I»ut there's cne thing that isn't true—YET. Stanford is NOT in the
Rose Bowl.

Sure, we all like to believe that
we're going to be able to spend New
Year's Day in that canyon stadium
down Pasadena way, watching our
boys do a repeat performance of
last season's great show. Perhaps
that'll happen. But, let us repeat,
the Indians aren't in yet.
It may appear that since Santa
Clara lost to Oklahoma, the Brones
aren't such a hot outfit. We doubt
that. The Broncs are going to be
an awful tough team lor Shaugh
nessy's lads to down. And we'd bel
that the Stanford grid head would
be the first to verify that.
Then, after the Santa Clara affair,
come games with U.S.C., W.S.C., and
California. This appears to be the
weak end of the Card schedule, and \
these teams aren't rated as being in ]
a class with the U. of W., Oregon,
and Oregon State. But how can you
figure anything, when a team that is
supposed to be a pushover (Wash
ington State) ups and blasts one of
the? big guns (Oregon State) litfht
out of the picture?
Babe Hollingberry's Cougars have
that same fighting chance of upset
ting the Big Red Machine.
So why don't we all just coast
along for a while—perhaps even un
til Frankie Albert and the boys
wind up the regular season with the
Cal fracas? If after that game, the
Stanfords boast three more victo
ries than they have now, it'll be
plenty of time to holler about the
Rose Bowl.
In the meantime, we can think,
and hope, can't we?

If Stanford loses another game this
fall, it appears that the Rose Bowl
will be a farce, for the western rep-
I resentative will necessarily be a
I Iwice defeated team. The chances
! are that the Sugar Bowl, and per
haps even the Cotton Bowl, could
wind up with a better set-up than
| that.
Something will certainly be amiss
in the football world this year if
Frank Albert doesn't repeat as an
All-American quarterback. Here on
the Farm we take the boy too much
for granted. As long as he plays his
; regular brand of ball, everything is
■ okay and little is said here about
him. If, on the other hand, he were
to fall below par just one Satur
day, you'd hear plenty about the
failure of Frank Albert, All-Amer
ican quarterback on the Stanford
football team, to come through.
The point is that he just never
does fail to come through.
