NEW YORK, Oct. 2G (UP).—The
Chicago Bears, the gridiron Goliaths
who put the kick in the Model T
formation, remained the only un
beaten club in the National football
league after Sunday's mid-season
games saw the hitherto undefeated
New York Giants smacked over by
the Brooklyn Dodgers in the sea
son's biggest upset.
A crowd of 17,217 turned out to
see the Bears roll up their fifth
straight victory and run their total
points to 209 (approximately 42
points per game) by a 37 to 7 win
over the Steelers. Rain and a soggy
field slowed the Bears up somewhat
and they passed less frequently
than usual. They drove G3 and 49
yards for their first two touch
downs.
