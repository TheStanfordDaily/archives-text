# Is the 'Hell' Out of Hell Week? Pardon Us—Initiation Period
## 
### 
STANFORD'S 24 Greek letter fraternities are
supposedly governed by two bodies —Inter-
fraternity Council, made up of student members
of the houses themselves, and Interfraternity
Board of Control, with student, administration,
and alumni representatives.
These bodies a year ago last spring passed
and put into effect last fall a new and humani
tarian code of rules which were supposedly go
ing to take the "Hell" out of Hell Week.
They even decided to abandon the old name
and call it Initiation Period.
It is admitted by present Row seniors that the
rules have done some good—that initiations are
not as bad now as when the Class of '42 was
taken in.
But it is also common knowledge that prac
tically every one of the rules set up was broken
by one or more fraternity houses.
The men who laid down these rules were
aware that a rule is no stronger than its enforc
ing body. So they provided for an Initiation
Period Committee and an inspection committee
to approve the individual house programs and
enforce the regulations. Violators were to be
liable, upon the judgment of Interfraternity
Board of Control, to a maximum fine of $100.
The Board meets early in November. Whether
the inspection committee took its job seriously
will be known for sure at that time.
Many houses abided by most of the rules.
Others disregarded most of them. If the Council
and the Board are to command the respect
which they should, they should let it be known
they are aware of the violations and levy fines
accordingly.
Or else they should admit failure and throw
out the rules if they decide not to really enforce
them.
This latter alternative would not look very
good in the light of the much-publicized com
ment when the program was first devised:
"I feel it is a desirable refinement of a prac
tice that has always been ridiculous," said In
terfraternity President Bob Moullon.
Row man Arch Jenkins, Editor of The Daily,
called it "a bit of the most beneficial legislation
ever to come out of our famed Fraternity Row."
It was originally intended that all hazing and
all paddling be outlawed. But Webster has
been played with a bit so that "hazing" now
means "public hazing." And as for paddling,
the Board will have to draw some imaginary
line where it ceases to be just paddling and be
comes "unreasonable physical treatment."
These can't be called violations.
But besides these two, there are several other
very specific rulings which we are assured
were flagrantly violated by more than just one
house.
Officially Initiation Period was not to start in
any house until Friday at noon. Actually, it got
under way for many sophs on Wednesday and
Thursday.
"The initiation activities shall be restricted
to the house and grounds of the local chapter
house." This was to eliminate the old favorite
"quest." It probably reduced the number of
sophs dropped off miles away from Stanford
with their little papers of instructions. But this
rule did not eliminate them.

To safeguard health of initiates, they should
be allowed to eat reasonable food, they should
be allowed SIX consecutive hours of sleep AT
NIGHT in every twenty-four, and should be
subjected to no "unreasonable physical treat
ment." Judge for yourself when a hasher goes
to sleep on his feet while walking along with a
full tray of food. (Luckily somebody caught
him.) Others have had to go to the hospital and
home because they were too sick to stay at the
house. Others were made to stand on one three
foot sguare all night without going to sleep.
"Study periods shall be provided of not less
than two hours a day," it says in the rules.
Check with the professors on this one.
"The activities should not interfere with the
peace and quiet of any other person or group
of persons." There were not many complaints
this time for screams rending the early morning
air resulting from dull thwacks on already red
dened posteriors.
These are the fraternity-made rules. These
are a few of the violations.
Now what is going to be done?

and put into effect last fall a new and humani
tarian code of rules which were supposedly go
ing to take the "Hell" out of Hell Week.
They even decided to abandon the old name
and call it Initiation Period.
It is admitted by present Row seniors that the
rules have done some good—that initiations are
not as bad now as when the Class of '42 was
taken in.
But it is also common knowledge that prac
tically every one of the rules set up was broken
by one or more fraternity houses.
The men who laid down these rules were
aware that a rule is no stronger than its enforc
ing body. So they provided for an Initiation
Period Committee and an inspection committee
to approve the individual house programs and
enforce the regulations. Violators were to be
liable, upon the judgment of Interfraternity
Board of Control, to a maximum fine of $100.
The Board meets early in November. Whether
the inspection committee took its job seriously
will be known for sure at that time.
Many houses abided by most of the rules.
Others disregarded most of them. If the Council
and the Board are to command the respect
which they should, they should let it be known
they are aware of the violations and levy fines
accordingly.
Or else they should admit failure and throw
out the rules if they decide not to really enforce
them.
This latter alternative would not look very
good in the light of the much-publicized com
ment when the program was first devised:
"I feel it is a desirable refinement of a prac
tice that has always been ridiculous," said In
terfraternity President Bob Moullon.
Row man Arch Jenkins, Editor of The Daily,
called it "a bit of the most beneficial legislation
ever to come out of our famed Fraternity Row."
It was originally intended that all hazing and
all paddling be outlawed. But Webster has
been played with a bit so that "hazing" now
means "public hazing." And as for paddling,
the Board will have to draw some imaginary
line where it ceases to be just paddling and be
comes "unreasonable physical treatment."
These can't be called violations.
But besides these two, there are several other
very specific rulings which we are assured
were flagrantly violated by more than just one
house.
Officially Initiation Period was not to start in
any house until Friday at noon. Actually, it got
under way for many sophs on Wednesday and
Thursday.
"The initiation activities shall be restricted
to the house and grounds of the local chapter
house." This was to eliminate the old favorite
"quest." It probably reduced the number of
sophs dropped off miles away from Stanford
with their little papers of instructions. But this
rule did not eliminate them.

To safeguard health of initiates, they should
be allowed to eat reasonable food, they should
be allowed SIX consecutive hours of sleep AT
NIGHT in every twenty-four, and should be
subjected to no "unreasonable physical treat
ment." Judge for yourself when a hasher goes
to sleep on his feet while walking along with a
full tray of food. (Luckily somebody caught
him.) Others have had to go to the hospital and
home because they were too sick to stay at the
house. Others were made to stand on one three
foot sguare all night without going to sleep.
"Study periods shall be provided of not less
than two hours a day," it says in the rules.
Check with the professors on this one.
"The activities should not interfere with the
peace and quiet of any other person or group
of persons." There were not many complaints
this time for screams rending the early morning
air resulting from dull thwacks on already red
dened posteriors.
These are the fraternity-made rules. These
are a few of the violations.
Now what is going to be done?
STANFORD'S 24 Greek letter fraternities are
supposedly governed by two bodies —Inter-
fraternity Council, made up of student members
of the houses themselves, and Interfraternity
Board of Control, with student, administration,

taken in.
But it is also common knowledge that prac
tically every one of the rules set up was broken
by one or more fraternity houses.
The men who laid down these rules were
aware that a rule is no stronger than its enforc
ing body. So they provided for an Initiation
Period Committee and an inspection committee
to approve the individual house programs and
enforce the regulations. Violators were to be
liable, upon the judgment of Interfraternity
Board of Control, to a maximum fine of $100.
The Board meets early in November. Whether
the inspection committee took its job seriously
will be known for sure at that time.
Many houses abided by most of the rules.
Others disregarded most of them. If the Council
and the Board are to command the respect
which they should, they should let it be known
they are aware of the violations and levy fines
accordingly.
Or else they should admit failure and throw
out the rules if they decide not to really enforce
them.
This latter alternative would not look very
good in the light of the much-publicized com
ment when the program was first devised:
"I feel it is a desirable refinement of a prac
tice that has always been ridiculous," said In
terfraternity President Bob Moullon.
Row man Arch Jenkins, Editor of The Daily,
called it "a bit of the most beneficial legislation
ever to come out of our famed Fraternity Row."
It was originally intended that all hazing and
all paddling be outlawed. But Webster has
been played with a bit so that "hazing" now
means "public hazing." And as for paddling,
the Board will have to draw some imaginary
line where it ceases to be just paddling and be
comes "unreasonable physical treatment."
These can't be called violations.
But besides these two, there are several other
very specific rulings which we are assured
were flagrantly violated by more than just one
house.
Officially Initiation Period was not to start in
any house until Friday at noon. Actually, it got
under way for many sophs on Wednesday and
Thursday.
"The initiation activities shall be restricted
to the house and grounds of the local chapter
house." This was to eliminate the old favorite
"quest." It probably reduced the number of
sophs dropped off miles away from Stanford
with their little papers of instructions. But this
rule did not eliminate them.

To safeguard health of initiates, they should
be allowed to eat reasonable food, they should
be allowed SIX consecutive hours of sleep AT
NIGHT in every twenty-four, and should be
subjected to no "unreasonable physical treat
ment." Judge for yourself when a hasher goes
to sleep on his feet while walking along with a
full tray of food. (Luckily somebody caught
him.) Others have had to go to the hospital and
home because they were too sick to stay at the
house. Others were made to stand on one three
foot sguare all night without going to sleep.
"Study periods shall be provided of not less
than two hours a day," it says in the rules.
Check with the professors on this one.
"The activities should not interfere with the
peace and quiet of any other person or group
of persons." There were not many complaints
this time for screams rending the early morning
air resulting from dull thwacks on already red
dened posteriors.
These are the fraternity-made rules. These
are a few of the violations.
Now what is going to be done?
STANFORD'S 24 Greek letter fraternities are
supposedly governed by two bodies —Inter-
fraternity Council, made up of student members
of the houses themselves, and Interfraternity
Board of Control, with student, administration,
and alumni representatives.
These bodies a year ago last spring passed
and put into effect last fall a new and humani
tarian code of rules which were supposedly go
ing to take the "Hell" out of Hell Week.
They even decided to abandon the old name
and call it Initiation Period.
It is admitted by present Row seniors that the
rules have done some good—that initiations are
not as bad now as when the Class of '42 was
taken in.
