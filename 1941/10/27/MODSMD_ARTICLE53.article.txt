# Cal Comes Through
## 
### 
LAST week, with Stanford Excom members
sitting in, California's Ex Committee served
notice that Stanford efforts to eliminate pre Big

Game raiding and vandalism were not going to
be purely one-sided.
Killing any thought of delegating the raid
question to any of the A.S.U.C.'s numerous sub
committees, they decided to put Ralph Fisher,
student body president, in complete charge of
a special group of campus leaders to investigate
and act upon any question connected with inter
campus raids.
Though Cal has no provision, as has Stanford,
for expulsion of students for such offenses, it
was assured that an active program of education
would be taken up, that sportsmanlike conduct
would be the rule and not the exception in the
coming intensification of the traditional rivalry.
Thanks, Cal.
