WE'RE PRACTICALLY IN
THIS column sounds like it belongs on the sport
page, it's only because your Bull Sessioncr is so
happy and excited about the results of the football
games over the week-end. Oh boy, things happened
wonderfully. After the Oregon State game, and even
after the San Francisco game, it looked as if Stanford
wasn't meant for the Rose Bowl this year. But things
happened perfectly. We won, everyone else lost, and
the rest of our tough games are at home and it looks
like Bud Ames is going to have to give another party
in Pasadena, New Years.
It would have been a perfect Saturday if Santa
Clara had won their game, and come to play us as an
undefeated team. The prestige gained would have
been tremendous, the crowd would have overflowed
and things like that help keep the tuition price a little
more static. But it will still be a good game.

o ne of the best games of the week was the Navy-
Harvard game. That score made me very happy.
If any of you read Bill Leiser's column with any kind
of regularity, you will have noticed that he is always
quoting the national rankings of a man named Deke
Houlgate. As everyone else on campus, your Bull
Sessioner has a lot of respect for Leisex - 's judgments
concerning sports, but why he pays so much attention
to Deke Houlgate, I have never been able to under
stand. For instance last week. Deke came out with
his rankings and placed Navy as the top team in the
nation. He placed Navy over Minnesota, over the
strong Texas team that drubbed Rice 40-0 and also
holds a one-sided win over Oklahoma, and he places
Navy over Duke, over Michigan and Northwestern,
over Fordham and all the teams on the Coast. In some
way, Houlgate ran over all his figures and statistics
and chose Navy as the best team in the country.
Saturday, Navy was held to a 0-0 tie by a Harvard
team that is practically unheard-of. And the result
of the game wasn't too surprising, if you consider that
a week before an undermanned Cornell team ran all
over Navy, got inside the five-yard line three times in
the first half, and then lost in the second half. Every
one likes you Bill, but Navy just isn't the best team
in the country, and no one can understand the system
Deke uses, and why you value his judgments as you
do.

Â¥ ISTENING to the Stanford game over the radio, I
was surprised when suddenly I heard a huge
rooting section swing out on the axe yell. I knew that
a few Stanford students had moved North for the
game, but I didn't think that a whole section had
gone up. And then I began to hear mistakes in the
yell and the announcer said that it was the Washing
ton rooters who were giving the yell. Of course that
is terrible. It's our yell, and we aren't even supposed
to give it until the U.S.C. or Cal game, and we don't
want anyone else to give it and especially no one to
give it with the timing all wrong. Just stop that kind
of stuff, that's all.

And the other thing of the week-end is that the
weather seems to have turned black for good. There
isn't a break in the sky anywhere, and it looks like
we're in for one of those rainy sieges. I've got my
green hat out, and my vitamin pills ready. But the
football picture was also black, and that has cleared
up. Maybe the weather will do the same thing.
