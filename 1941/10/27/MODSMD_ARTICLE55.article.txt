## AS A STRIP-TEASER... 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
As a strip-teaser apologizes for her modesty, as
the sloth craves pardon for its speed, as the desert
winds no doubt shyly confess their dampnessâ€”so Lin
coln Moses "apologizes" for his "didactic" method.
Nature is truly wonderful!
The true meaning of "didactic" is "instructive."
And our friend Lin has apparently not noticed a fact
that women never let most men forget: Asking ques
tions is not the same as giving the answers. And
neither is filling the editorial page with 36 sophis
tic questions a substitute for clarity and logic.
Typical fallacies in this bizarre mixture of specious
reasoning and question marks were these:
(1) Lin, as did Norman Thomas a short time before,
asks, "If invasion of the continent is feasible, why
hasn't Churchill done it?" It should not come as a
complete surprise to Lin that the British alone are not
so strong as would be a united Britain and Amer
ica. It should not be singularly amazing that the Brit
ish may not be able to invade the continent without
more help from us. And yet our teacher Lincoln is
supposed to argue against intervention by asking a
question as absurd as this: Is it possible that two is
greater than one?

(2) All through his caricature of a socratic dis
course Lincoln charges intervention with a phalanx of
doubts, while defending isolation with the rosy phan
tom "making democracy work." He wants the United
States "to continue adequate defense" in a world
which we are only half-heartedly prepared to keep
from Nazi domination. This, he implies, will be no
psychic, political, or economic strain on the country;
we will be quite able to abolish fear, poverty, intol
erance, ignorance, and injustice. (I assume we will all
become trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, cour
teous, kind, etc., by this method too.) But if we fight
.the enemy that LIN WANTS US TO DEFEND OUR
SELVES AGAINST, all these miracles will be im
possible! How ridiculous to believe that defense against
a hostile world will in the long run be less expensive
than joining our allies before they are dead.
Granted intervention is not a pleasant prospect.
That somehow does not convince one that a perpetual
arsenal is a paradisal dream. Nor does it convince
me that America should shroud itself in words while
millions are dying in a battle against the common
enemy.
Even if Lincoln Moses' index finger develops a
chronic twitch over the question mark on his type
writer, the stark facts will not be altered: An army
of murderers has declared war upon the world. If
America joins her allies now, we shall be stronger in
our fight for freedom.
Sincerely,
Sherman Mellinkofl
