# Licia Albanese Gives Fine 'Butterfly' Performance
## 
### 
With the leading tenor's part an officcr in the U.S. Navy, and the "Star
Spangled Banner" a continually recurring theme ,a more appropriate opera
than Madame Butterfly could not have hecn performed for the contingent
of service men who occupied a choice section of seats at the San Fran
cisco Memorial Opera House Thursday night.

Licia Albanese, interpreting
charming, childish part of Butterfly
with notable skill, was playing her
first season in San Francisco. Un
known though she was, the audience
knew, when it heard the off-stage
singing just prior to her entrance,
that she was going to be good; and
in the music of the second act,
which is the reigning favorite among
sopranos, she rose to the occasion as
superbly as ever a soprano before
her has done.
A GOOD TROUBLE'
But stealing the show right out
from under Butterfly, was the little
golden-haired Trouble, played by
Stephanie Weaver, who was startled
by the audience's applause and be
wildered by the singers about her,
and not relishing the profuse hug
ging, she wiped off a kiss or two as
the drama became too sentimental
for her. When taking her curtain
call, which was the most enthusiastic
of all, she got tired waiting and sat
down. The opera has surely never
had a better Trouble.
Tenor Frederick Jagel, at his
bravado best, was a flawless Pinker
ton, and John Brownlee, as Sharp
less, though sometimes self-con
scious, was the perfect U.S. consul
type, and his full baritone was al
ways satisfactory. Making the most
of his short appearance on the stage,
Lorenzo Alvary, as The Bronze, the
bald-headed priest, was a holy ter
ror while he lasted. Ably support
ing Butterfly in duets was her serv
ant, played by rich-voiced Irra Pe
tina. And Margaret Ritter as Kate
Pinkerton, was beautiful scenery.
PUCCINI AT BEST
Puccini always goes over when
done well, and this night, under
Conductor Papi, he was done well-r
intensely, delicately, as Butterfly
should be performed. With cherry
blossom trees in the garden, the scen
ery was as fragilly tinted as the
music itself.
The only approach to the old-time
overacting was in the ending, which
was simplified from the conventional
close. Instead of blindfolding the
child and placing an American flag
in its hand, Butterfly sent it into
the garden, and then, as one specta
tor put it, "She died all over the
stage."â€”Covey
