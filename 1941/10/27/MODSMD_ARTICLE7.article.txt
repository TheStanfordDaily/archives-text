# Talk to Explain House Rushing
## 
### 
Discussing all the points of the
new rushing system, Mrs. J. A.
Younger, Pan - Hellenic executive
secretary, will speak tonight in the
Education auditorium at 7:15. Any
new woman living on or off campus
who is interested in learning the do- j
tails of sorority rushing is invited to j
attend,

According to Pan-Hellenic Coun
cil, this discussion by Mrs. Younger
is a prelude to the registering of new
women who wish to partcipate in ac
tive sorority rushing. This program
of registration will also be explained
in order to avoid any confusion on
Friday when it takes place, Mrs.
Younger stated.

Barbara Rapp, Council president,
stated that she urges all new women
to take advantage of this rushing
discussion as it will be the only op
porunity for them to ask questions
about and to understand the new
rulings which Pan-Hellenic has de
vised for rushing this year.

Yesterday was the climax of the
sorority open house teas and Miss
Rapp expressed great satisfaction
with the response made by the new
women. "Pan - Hellenic Council
sponsored these teas as a gesture of
hospitality to all new women and
we were highly gratified their
co-operation," stated Miss Rapp.
