A FOOTSORE FABLE
Once upon a time three was a man who was lost. He wandered around
for days, trying to find his way home. He would walk five miles down
one road, until he discovered that it didn t lead to where he wanted to
I
go, and then he would walk down another road. He was very unhappy,
and his feet hurt.
After a long lime he met another man, and asked for directions.
The second man looked at him and said, "Isn't that a map sticking out
of your pocket?"
"Yes," said the man who was lost.
"Then why don't you look at the map, and find out which road you
should take?"'
"Mry goodness!"" said the lost man, "I never thought of that!"

when you'll find an up-to-the-minute shopping map in the advertisements
in this paper?
The answer is, of course: You shouldn't!
Save yourself many weary footsteps and precious, hard-earned dol
lars, hy reading the advertisements carefully, every day.
