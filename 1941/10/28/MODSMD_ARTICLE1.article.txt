Lewellyn Lewis is rapidly be
coming much more than Organized
Labor's Bad Boy. Public Obstruc
tionist Number One would be closer
to it.
Mr. Lewis has been raising hell
again. This time it's all because
there are several hundred men in
the nation's coal industry who
just don't feel like joining his club
so that they can have the supernal
privilege of paying exorbitant
dues for affiliation with a singular
sort of fraternity whose self-seek
ing, power-thirsting, utterly ruth
less Grand Potentate uses the un
ions as a political tool all in the
name of sweet sweet Labor.
(Deep breath)
So Mr. Lewis has told the lx>ys in
his club to pick up their toys and go
and that is what they have done,
leaving a nation that is feverishly,
desperately arming for defense,
minus four-fifths of its steel produc
tion, the output of seven of its larg
est steel companies.

]V|R. LEWIS knows that steel is the
nation's most vital industry at
this moment, and that steel cannot
possibly be made without coal. He
may even know what all the hubba
hubba in Washington is about, what
this country is trying to do in the
way of rearming. And there is just
an outside chance that somebody
has told him about A. Hitler and all
that nasty business in Europe; and
that the U.S. is just on the brink of
the whole thing.
But Mr. Lewis is such a big man
that lie can rise above all that
sort of thing. He can ignore re
peated appeals from the President
of the United States, stop the
work of 5.'},001) miners, bog down
the entire national defense effort,
and then blame the whole thing on
"a rich man named Morgan, who
lives in New York." ("What utter
rubbish!" said Mr. Morgan, taking
a sip of his cognac and a drag on
his gold-studded hookah.)
Democracy is truly a wonderful
thing.

Y'ESTERDAY'S reports of a recent
Gallup poll on the U.S. pub
lic's attitude toward Organized La
bor, showed some remarkable re
sults. According to Dr. Gallup, "to
day's study shows that organized la
bor has lost substantial public sym
pathy in recent years. It has fewer
friends today than it had five
ago; fewer even than during the pe
riod of the highly unpopular sit
down strikes in 1937."

Furthermore, since May 1940
more than three million voters
have turned against labor unions,
undoubtedly because of the per
sistent refusal of the unions to
co-operate in the defense effort.
For the months of August and
September alone there were 169
strikes in just plants working on
Army contracts .a loss of 703,350
man-days. And Mr. Lewis' latest
stunt will raise this Bawlout av
erage considerably.

The results of Dr. Gallup's poll
are significant if for no other reason
than they show an amazing discrep
ancy between public opinion and the
Administration's labor policy.

J JUT, evidently, the New Deal la
bor-lovers arc having a change
of heart. Enough is, after all,
enough. President Roosevelt last
night rapped "the selfish obstruction
of a small but dangerous minority
of labor leaders who are a menace
to the true cause of labor itself, as
well as the nation as a whole."
Yes, John, the man means you.
Lip until now the President has
dandled labor fondly on his knee,
cliukked it under the chin, occa
sionally wrapped its knuckles. Hut
it is obvious that this time he
means business.

It was reported from Washington
that Roosevelt is ready to take ac
tion unless things clear up consid
erably and immediately. That this
action will be in the form of legis
lation—which Congress would in all
probability pass in a few days—was
also strongly hinted.

Legislation of this sort will be
welcomed by many of labor's friends
as well as by people like that rich
old man in New York.
