# Registration of New Women For Rushing Opens Tomorrow
## 
### 
Inaugurating a new system in sorority rushing at Stanford, all new
women students who wish to participate in rushing will register tomor
row and Thursday from 1 to 5 p.m. in the Pan-Hellenic ofliec, which is
located on the third floor of the Women's Clubhouse.
"Registration on those days is the only way in which new women can

be included in any of the rushing
lists," stresses Barbara Rapp, presi
dent of Pan-HeLlenic Council. Any
one who has not ben enrolled dur
ing a previous rushing period, in
cluding freshmen, transfers, and off
campus residents, is eligible to reg
ister.
At the time of registration, each
woman will receive a copy of the
Pan-Hellenic bidding contract and
any other necessary information. A
registration fee of one dollar will
be charged.

At a meeting Monday evening in
the Education Auditorium, Mrs. J.
A. Younger, Pan-Hellenic executive
secretary, explained the Stanford
sorority system to an audience of
new women.

Characterizing rushing as "court
ing in a goldfish bowl," Mi's. Young
er urged the co-operation of every
one in alleviating the difficulties cre
ated by a situation of selective mem
bership. Such intricacies of rushing
as informal contacts, the quota sys
tem, and deferred rushing were dis
cussed in her talk.

To aid new women seeking infor
mation or guidance during rushing,
Barbara Rapp will be in the Pan-
Hellenic office on Mondays from 2
to 3 p.m. and from 1 to 2 p.m. on
Tuesdays through Fridays during
this quarter.
