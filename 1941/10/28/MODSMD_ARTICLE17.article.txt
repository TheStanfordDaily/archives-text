# Panamanian Consul Admires Intelligence of U.S. Co-eds
## 
### MARTHAGRACE POWELL 
American coeds are intelligent
and lack coquetry, according to
Guillermo Benedetti, young Pana
manian chancellor of the Consulate
General.
Mr. Benedetti spoke yesterday in
a radio talk from the Hoover Wat-
Library on "My Impressions â€¢ as a
University Student of Latin and
North America."
FEARS VANISHED
Announcing that his fears upon
first entering a co-educational insti
tution were that the atmosphere
would be one of "pretext for finding
a good husband or pretty wife," he
later added, "My fears vanished as I
was able to notice a girl holding her
own with ease and intelligence in
discussions with boys.
"I began to observe," he contin
ued, "that the psychological make
up of North American boys is such
that they can overlook feminine
charms when they study."
Since Mr. Bcnedetti's recreational
preferences were "always placid,
such as swinging in a hammock," he
pointed out his inability to under
stand the value of sports in Ameri

can college life. After several years
of instruction he reported, "The
mental strain of study makes phys
ical exercise as indispensable as
food and rest."
GREATEST EXPERIENCE
Continuing along a more serious
vain, he noted the greatest experi
ence he had in this country, that of
seeing "the liberty given to profes
sors to teach whatever they please
in their given field, and the liberty
that the students enjoy to learn in
the same manner."
Modern democracy at work, Mr.
Benedetti said, forms one of the
most inspiring chapters in his book
of life, and he stresses the import
ance of accepting democracy as the
foundation of the good neighbor
policy.
GOOD NEIGHBORS
"I speak with a conviction," he
concluded, "that the good neighbor
policy in the Americas, undertaken
before the present European conflict,
will grow and strengthen after the
conflict is ended; that it will be re
juvenated and solidified by the
ardent youth of the countries."
