BERLIN, Oct. 27 (UP). â€”German
armies are bogged down in tho bot
tomless mud of Russia, authorized
military spokesmen admitted to
night, at the same time claiming that
they needed "only a few firm roads
to liquidate what remains of the
Red army in Europe."
For the first time since Adolf Hit
ler ordered the supreme eastern of
fensive on Oct. 2, the Nazis conceded
that the German advance was being
"delayed for a few days." But they
insisted that bad weather and spongy
roads caused the delay, and not Rus
sian resistance.
