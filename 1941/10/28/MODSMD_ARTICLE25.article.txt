WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (UP). — Declaring (hat "the shooting has
started," President Roosevelt said tonight that American merchant ships
must Ih» armod and protected by the U. S. Navy to insure delivery of
the supplies essential to defeat the Nazis, whom lie charged with having
definite designs on the Western Hemisphere,

Revision of the U.S. Neutrality ad.
is "the course of honesty and real
ism," the President said, adding that
"our American ships must be free
to carry our American goods into
the harbors of our friends."
In a Navy and Total Defense Day
address bristling with anti-Nazi
challenges, Mr. Roosevelt, said that
shooting began when German sub
marines torpedord American mer
chant and naval vessels and that,
while "history will record who fired
the first shot," in the long run "all
that will matter is who fired the last
shot."
He disclosed that he has in his
possession two secret German docu
ments revealing hitherto unknown
Nazi objectives if the Third Reich
succeeds in dominating the world.
GERMANS' PLOT
One, he said, is a plan to destroy
all existing religions; it envisions
seizure of all church property and
substitution of an international Nazi
church which would replace the
Bible with the words of "Mein
Kampf," and substitute the swastika
and the naked sword for the cross
of Christ.
The other, he revealed, is a map
of the "new order" as applied to
South America and a part of Central
America. It divides South America
into "five vassal states" one of
which would embiace the Republic
of Panama and the Panama Canal.
HITLER WILL BE STOPPED'
The President was supremely con
fident of Hitler's ultimate defeat.
"The forward march of Hitlerism
can be stopped—and will be stop
ped," he declared. "Very simply
and very bluntly—we are pledged
to pull our own oar in the destruc
tion of Hitlerism."
The speech, broadcast nationally
and to the world, highlighted a na
tionwide celebration of Navy Day.
It was delivered after a banquet at
the Mayflower Hotel at which high
Army and Navy's leaders spoke.
REAFFIRMS 'FREE SEAS'
In his speech the President:
Reaffirmed freedom of the seas as
a fundamental policy of this govern
ment.
Without specifically mentioning
U.S.-to-Europe convoys, said that
American naval vessels would pro
tect this country's merchant ships
carrying war aid to Hitler foes - a
freedom the merchantmen will have
when and if Congress revises the
Neutrality Act.
Endorsed proposed repeal of other
"hamstringing" provisions of the
Neutrality Law to permit arming of
merchant ships and to allow them to
transit combat areas.
MILITARY IS PRIMED
Asserted that the Navy is ready
for action; that units of the Atlantic
patrol already are in action and that,
the new Army steadily is developing
strength needed to withstand ag
gressors.
Said the United States would not
take U-boat attacks on U.S. naval
and merchant shipping "lying down"
and declared that the "shoot first"
orders which he gave to the fleet on
Sept. 11 are in full force.
