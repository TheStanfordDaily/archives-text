### DON SELBY 
I VTOr? a long time we've been wondering why Harry Shipkey's freshman
gridders, who have been several heads above most of their compe
j tition for the past several years, have not been scheduled to play some
teams that could make things tough for them.
For aside from California and U.S.C., two of the three frosli outfits
that the Papoose squad plays, most of the teams have been far from
the equals of Shipkey's lads. The Stanford yearlings sneaked by Cal
last year and the year before and dropped a one-point decision to
the Trobahcs in the fall of 1!).'!}). But (hey have had little more than a
scrimmage under game conditions with the array of junior college
talent that has been tossed against them.
Well, the long period of wondering finally brought action yesterday in
the form of conversations with Shipkey and A1 Masters, general manager
of the 8.A.C., which in turn brought the following general finding:
Since the freshmen, by conference ruling, are allowed to play only
six games, a schedule that included, besides Cal. U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.,
freshman teams from other colleges and universities around the bay
area would be too tough for men in their first year at Stanford. That
is, such a schedule would make freshman football so important that
it would take up time that could be used by the freshman football
player in becoming oriented and hitting the books.
That may be true, but if some bay area university's frosh grid club, say
Santa Clara, could be substituted for the Ucla yearlings, who never offer
much, if any, competition, freshman football at Stanford would probably
be a little more interesting. At the same time, it wouldn't put too much
emphasis on it.
It's great to have an undefeated Papoose football team every year, but
it would be better if the boys played somebody that counted.
As it stands, the frosh schedule allows the boys more games than
many yearling clubs play—freshman teams in the Northwest play only
three games a year. But that's no reason why it couldn't be better.

W/TTHOUT a doubt Nort Thornton, Stanford's swimming and water polo
mentor, was a proud man yesterday morning when he found out
that two boys that he has coached, Paul Herron and Howard Adams, were
named on the all-American swimming team.
Herron competed for the Indians only one season—his freshman year—
but Adams is still in school and will dive for Stanford this winter and
spring.
Herron was named on the 88ft-yard free style relay team, while
Adams was given honorable mention as a diver, ranking behind the
great Early Clark.

ALTHOUGH he moved onto the first string only last week, Will Sheller,
Stanford's new backfield ace, leads Stanford in the scoring column
with oO points to his credit. Discounting Bill Micklich and Eso Naranche,
who play for Montana and Idaho—schools that do not play a round-robin
conference schedule—Tommy Roblin shares the tallying honors with
Sheller. And the next two men are also Indians—Frank Albert, with 27
points from three touchdowns and nine conversions; and Milt Vucinich,
with four touchdowns.
The funny thing is that Stanford's biggest running threat. Skeeter
Peter Kmetovic, doesn't hit pay dirt as often as the other boys do.
That fact is significant in that it shows that the.power backs are doing
most of the scoring this year, whereas the liig Red Machine often
marked up many of its touchdowns via the long-gainer route a year
ago. Now Stanford gets in scoring territory and powers its way over.
And Sheller and Voos are just the boys who can do the powering, too.

IIOT SUGGESTION DEPT.
Two institutions of higher learning that we know of called ofT classes
yesterday just because their football teams won football games.
Allegheny College (Pa.), after a long, long losing streak, took a 21-
14 victory over American University last Saturday, and the result was
a holiday yesterday. The same thing happened at Oklahoma Univer
sity because of the Sooners victory over Santa Clara.
Now that Stanford is high up in the football picture, the Indians are
expected lo win all the time, so we could hardly ask for a day off because
of a victory. But why didn't somebody suggest that procedure at the start
of last season, when the Wow Boys started on the upgrade after that
oh-: o-disastrous 1939 season?
