# Varsity Runs Through First Drill for Bronco
## 
### 
With the regulars taking things
i easy the Stanford varsity went
through its first anti - Santa Clara
drill yesterday afternoon. After a
lengthy chalk talk, Albert, Linds
kog, and the other first-stringers
j jogged around for a few minutes and
; checked into the gym.
Coach Shaughnessy ran two
teams of reserves through signal
drill with A1 Cole doing the quar-
I terbacking. Freddie Meyer had his
sprained wrist well taped up and
Milt Vucinich, who bruised his leg
i at Seattle, appeared in street clothes.
INJURIES SMALL
Bruno Banducci has a bad leg, but
it's nothing serious. "Bandooch"
had a day of rest yesterday. Pete
1 Kmetovic came out of the Washing
ton game in 1 good shape and Hank
Norberg and Arnie Meiners are now
both sound. Bill Shelter's bashed
nose shouldn't bother him, so Stan
ford now has the smallest injury list
since the Oregon State game.
Jack Sarkisian and Tony Cal
velli dropped in from Moffett Field
to watch Stanford work out yester
day. Sarky, who used to play with
Stanford's Jack Smith at San Jose
Stale, had high praise for Butch
Morse, who, at the age of 31, is
playing sensational ball for the Fly
ers.
CALVELLI STARS
Calvelli, Stanford's defensive tiger
a few years ago, helped ruin Camp
Haan this week-end with his line
backing. Tony gathered in a Haan
j pass and barged 23 yards to pay dirt.
The Indians, who got into town
yesterday morning, have a great
respect for Santa Clara and expect
the Broncs to be plenty tough after
their loss to Oklahoma.
