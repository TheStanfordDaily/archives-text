# Papooses Prep For San Mateo
## 
### 
When Harry Shipkey's Papooses
step into the grid ring against San
Mateo J. C. Saturday, it will be
without doubt, the yearlings' tough
est opponent of the season, includ
ing Cal frosh.
San Mateo is undefeated, untied,
I and almost unscored-on:
San Mateo J.C.
18 Menlo J.C 0
17 Modesto J.C 0
2(> S.F. State 0
20 Salinas J.C 0
12 Stockton J.C 7
But off their win over Alhambra
i Alumni Club Saturday last, the
Papeese shouldn't be too far the un
j derdog. The way Jim Pettit was
| breaking away behind clever block
; ing reminds one of Hugh Gallar
neau, flashy half of Stanford's '40
Rose Bowl squad.
Following the San Mateo tussle,
Shipkey's men meet Cal frosh here
the following week.

Cornelius Warmerdam, of the San
Francisco Olympic Club, is the first
man to ever scale the height of 15
feet in the pole vault.
