# Voss Leads List of Tall '42 Hoopmen
## 
### 
These rainy afternoons, drop
around Encina Gym and you'll see
! 15 or 20 human skyscrapers, bump
ing the rafters of the gym and barely
able to keep from touching the net
cords of the basket—they're the Red
skins' 1942 basketball team—tallest
in height since Jack climbed the
beanstalk.
Towering at the top of the list is
Ed Voss at six foot six. Drop down
one inch and there's Howard Dall
mar at six-five. Dallmar, former
Menlo J.C. flash, is on the Farm for
good and will be fighting hard for
a starting position on Coach Everett

Dean's first string.
Also at six-five is Jim Pollard,
last year's frosh phenom. Right
now, you can see Pollard heaving
footballs country miles during intra
mural grid frays.

Getting down out of the sky at six
th ree are Bill Cowden and Don
Burness, both named southern divi
sion All-Stars last season. With
nine lettermen missing this year due
to graduation and defense, Burness
and Cowden will no doubt form the
| starting nucleus of the new club.

Also at six-three are Fred Oliver
and John Eikelman. Ollie didn't
discover his own ability till late in
Ihe frosh season last year. Given the
chance, he did o.k. for Beeb Lee's
yearlings, who won over Cal in the
little Big. Series, 2-1.
