# FRESNO PREPS FOR U.S.F.
## 
### 
FRESNO, Oct. 27 (UP).-Highly
pleased because the Fresno State
College offense has finally "arrived,"
Coach James Bradshaw neverthe
less prepared tonight for continued
emphasis on offensive blocking to
keep his team's scoring punch at
peak for the game with the vastly
improved University of San Fran
cisco here Saturday night.
