TROLLS and people are funny things. Polls try
.IT lo find out what people think; and people try
to interpret what polls mean. And the Stanford
Daily war poll, conducted last Friday noon with
results released yesterday morning, is no ex
ception.
Of the nearly 3,000 students voting, many
criticized the alternatives to the question pre
sented. By oral and written comment, "luke
warm isolationists" and "mild interventionists"
indicated that none of the statements repre
sented their opinions, that more degrees of opin
ion were needed.
To satisfy every degree of opinion, even a
hundred alternatives would be inadequate. Per
haps, however, less vague statements and an
additional degree of isolation opinion would
have answered the purpose.
Nevertheless, the poll revealed definite
trends of campus opinion:
1. Stanford is no longer an advocate of the
stay-in-your-own-back-yard policy. Dynamic
world events have cracked this complacency
and selfishness.
2. The need for national unity in this crisis
has even broken through Stanford's adamant
stand against the Roosevelt Administration.
3. Forty-seven per cent of the student body
realize the urgency of defeating Hitler—at any
cost. "Back Hitler until England is beaten," say
37 per cent. "We should have been in there
fighting before this," 10 per cent declare.
4. Stanford is more strongly isolationist than
the country as a whole. One out of every four
students on campus say it is not our war and
we should resist any move that would further
lead us toward war. Compared to Stanford's 25
per cent, the nation as a whole is between 16
and 20 per cent isolationist, depending on the
turn of the war and other developments.
More than anything else, this poll reveals that
Stanford has awakened to problems existing be
yond its Palm Drive portals.—Milton Silverman
