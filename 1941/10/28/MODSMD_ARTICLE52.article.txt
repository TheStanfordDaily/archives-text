# Objections Overruled
## 
### 
THERE have been a few objections voiced to
our reminding, at the bottom of the edit col
umn, Daily staff members of the weekly Tues
day sessions. It pleases us greatly to know that
someone actually reads the edits all the way
down to the bottom. However, objections are

overruled by reason of ancient tradition. That's
one tradition national defense can't take away.
And so without further ado, the edit column
will adjourn into Bull Session until 2:15 today
when the editor will do a strip-tease.
