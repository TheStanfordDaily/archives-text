SHOULD WE OR NOT

Jj AST Friday, the Daily printed the results of a poll
J taken by Dr. Lewis Terman, questioning the mem
bers of our faculty on their ideas of intervention and
isolation. From the poll it was learned that about 75
per cent of the Stanford professors favor measures by
Congress and the administration that would assume the
defeat of the axis powers. In other words, most of
our professors feel that it is important to the United
States what happens in the other parts of the world.

Yesterday morning, the Daily printed another poll.
This time the entire student body of the campus was
canvassed, and the results show that the student feel
ing about the war is about the same as that of the
professors. For 37 per cent of the students came out
and said by their votes that we should back England
in every way until Hitler is defeated, and along with
this, 24 per cent of the students felt that we should
support in full the government's program. Thus we
have 61 per cent of all our students and a bunch of
professors who are getting in the war spirit.

But there is another number that says 28 per cent
of the students feel this is not our war, and that we
should resist every effort to di'aw this country into
war. That is quite a large minority, and I feel that
there would have been even more on this side, if
there had been as many questions on that side as there
were on the side of the interventionists. For the poll
had three different degrees for entering the war, and
only one, definite, all the way, question for those that
oppose war. Just as there are degrees of favoring war,
there are also degrees of opposing war, and a really
accurate poll would have allowed this sentiment a
fairer chance to express itself.

BUT from the two polls it looks like we're getting
warm and ready for anything. A declaration of
war wouldn't startle anyone at this time. Some people
already feel that it is overdue. "I'm getting tired of
all this fighting," people say, "we ought to jump in and
settle it. This thing has dragged on long enough." I'm
beginning to hear things like that. People are really
tired of war. They are tired of always reading about
it. They are tired of hearing about it over the radio,
and seeing it in the movies, and they are tired of talk
ing about it. There is too much tension in the air, there
is always the feeling that something heavy is hang
ing above and will fall any minute, but just doesn't.
The pressure is too great, and people want it to end
and so people don't care if this country goes to war or
not. A lot of people don't, anyway.

I think that most everyone wants to do the right
thing. Hardly anyone that I know has any special in
terest in going to war or staying out. Most people, in
an objective way, try to understand the problem and
come to a decision that would be most beneficial to
the country. But it is such a hard problem, it is so
easy to get mixed up.

I remember when I was in high school, and we
studied the last war. Our teacher said that all of a
sudden a war sentiment swept the country, everyone
lost their heads, everyone got caught by the propa
ganda and we soon were in the war. I always kept
feeling that if I had been alive during that time, I
wouldn't have gotten excited, I wouldn't have gotten
panicky, I would have kept saying that we should
remain sane and sober and stay out of the war.

But now the same thing is happening, the same fury
is sweeping across the country, and I am all mixed up.
How do I know if it's all propaganda. How can I tell
if we are all suckers. How can anyone know if it is
right to jump into the thing, or to stay out. I can't
figure it out, but I'm going to keep trying, because
I want to be right, just as everyone else does.
