# CAMPUS OPINION
## EUROPEAN FEEDING 
### 
r JTHE EDITOR, SIR:
As a Stanford woman myself, I believe that a
Stanford student has the right to any opinion he
chooses, and the right to express it where and when
he pleases. This stretches from the editorial stafl of
the Daily down to this year's freshman.

I also believe that every student has a right to all
the facts on which to base his opinion. Especially in a
matter so close to America's creed of humanity as the
feeding of the child-victims of the European war, I
think scrutinizing the facts is more than a right, it is a
duty of honor.

Since some of the Stanford student-body have re
marked to me that they do not feel that they have
had the facts on this question, but only colored opin
ions based on distortions, I should like to say that a
copy of Mr. Hoover's last speech reporting on the effort
is in the Hoover Library, in the righthand room. Also
I should be glad to supply any information I can to
anyone writing me to Box 3020, Campus.

Will you publish this so that no Stanford student
need feel that he need, by implication, be labeled as
heartless, or by lack of information be debarred from
endorsing any effort toward the American "arsenal
of mercy"?
