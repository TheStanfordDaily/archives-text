# THEY WANNA YELL, TOO

r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
This Saturday there will be a large crowd in the
stadium to see Stanford battle Santa Clara. Seated in
a section by themselves will be several thousand sol
diers who every Saturday go to the football games
for relaxation and a good time. Why can't Stanford
help these fellows have a good time by appointing a
cheer leader to organize their yells? It is certainly
much better to have the section for us than cheering
against us under the guidance of a visiting cheer
leader as has been the case so far this season. Their
desire for organized cheering is certainly there, and
added noise at a football game is something never to
be passed by.

But student committees have done just that. They
have passed up the army section. For over three weeks
now I have been trying to get this proposal acted upon
without any success. It is beyond Rally Committee's
power. Cardinals referred it to Ex Com and now Ex
Com for the third consecutive week has put the dis
cussion off. Football season doesn't last forever. Let's
hope that Ex Com descends from its high horse tonight
and moves for better good will with the army.
All who have been to Army or Navy games in the
East know exactly what their organized sections arc
capable of. They're terrific!
