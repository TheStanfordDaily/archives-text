# Determined Lana Turner Reforms Amorous Gable
## 
### 
"lIONKY TONK," now playing at the Fox Stanford Theater in Palo Alio.
When Clark Gable kisses Lana Turner, brother, she stays kissed. But
the amorous advances of that charming gentleman don't stop determined
Miss Turner from making him see the litfht and turning from his confidence
man racket to clean-living and high thinking.

Set in the rowdy, gun-totin' era.
when the West was young, "Honky
Tonk" is as virile and lusty a picture
as ever was. It's full of those tense
moments when the hero's cool
nerves and level head defeat the
brutish villain, while the audience
holds its breath for fear that hand
some, rascally Mr. Gable will bite
the well known dust. But he knows
his business, and manages to wiggle
out of every bad situation until Miss
Turner comes along and knocks him
for a loop. She gets him drunk and
marries him, although like you
know-who, he "isn't the marrying
kind," and then, good people, the
fun begins.
GABLE EXCELLENT
As Rhett Butlerish Candy John
son, Clark Gable is excellent. All
the credit in the world is due him
for turning himself into a real actor
after a starter as one of the sex
appeal boys. Of course that old spark
is still there, but he always man
ages to turn in a good performance
with it. As for Lana Turner, as the
spunky gal from Boston, this little
lady is fast becoming an able per
former. From sweater girl to Bern
hardt is a long leap, but Turner is
doing the best she can.

Frank Morgan, in the role of her
father, "Judge" Cotton, ex-con man
and boozer supreme, turns in a
splendid performance. Claire Tre
vor, as one of those shady saloon
queens, again proves herself to be
one of Hollywood's better young
actresses. We are looking forward
to the day when she will be given
the attention worthy of her talents.
Albert Dekker is a smooth and evil
heavy, and Marjorie Main is amus
ing in her usual part of a tough
talking, salt of the eai'th type.

Don't go to "Honky Tonk" pre
pared to see the problems of the
world solved; don't, for heavens'
sake, go to be uplifted. But if you
want to spend an amusing, often
times exciting, evening, by all means
take yourself down to the Stanford.
NO SECOND FEATURE

We are happy to announce that
there is no second feature on the
bill. In order that the theater-goers
may get their money's worth there
is a veritable barrage of short sub
jects, and good ones at that. Don't
miss John Nesbitt's Passing Parade,
nor the March of Time's neat bit
of propaganda, "Peace by Adolf
Hitler."â€”Livingston
