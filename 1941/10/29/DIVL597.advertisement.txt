DO YOU KNOW
YOUR BOOKSTORE?
Question: What is the rebate and how does one collect?
Answer: The rebate is the system that the Stanford Book
store uses to share with students and faculty the profits
made during its fiscal year. It is paid in cash on the basis
of the amount of cash receipt coupons the individual has
saved. The Bookstore provides envelopes for saving these
coupons. Rebate envelopes and coupons must be turned
in to the' Stanford Bookstore before May 15, 1942.
