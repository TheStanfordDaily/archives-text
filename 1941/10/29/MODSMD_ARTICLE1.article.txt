### AMIE REICHERT 
IJENITO MUSSOLINI stuck out
his chin again yesterday and
made whatever kind of a noise it is
that a jackal makes. He stood on
the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia
and told anybody that was interested
that, the United States would be
crushed by the Axis.
Below him 50,000 Fascists cheered
lustily; at least Virginio Gayda said
that they cheered lustily, so it must
be so.
And why shouldn't the Italian
people cheer and hop up and down
in glee un( | shout Huzza! They
love their Duce and they love the
war he has brought them, the ra
tioning, (he hunger, the bombings,
the series of dishonorable defeats,
the booty-less "victories." And
best of all tlicy must love being
the chattels of Adolf Hitler.
The Italian jackanapes has never
been in better form. "Bolshevism,"
he shouted, "against which we waged
war 20 years ago, is in its death
agony—struck in the heart by our
Axis partner, and our arms as well
as our allies.
"Russia's allies in both Europe and
America —a coalition which repre
sents the powers of egoism—will be
crushed by the revolutionary forces
of Fascism and Naziism."

IT WAS good of the Duce to give
the Nazi soldiers that friendly pat
of confidence. A little moral sup
port goes a long way, especially
when that is all one has to offer.
And it has been apparent for some
time that moral support is about
all the Blackshirts are capable of.
But there is a place for everyone in
Herr Hitler's New Order and it looks
like the Italian soldiers have found
theirs in the rooting section. And
Benito has carved himself a little
niche as Head Yell Leader.
This is quite a change from the
glorious days of yesteryear when
II Duce was preaching Charles
Atlas and Bernarr MacFadden to
bis soldiers in order to build up
an army of Class A-l'ers.
Those were the years of the Fascist
"Olympic games." Those were the
years when you couldn't go to a
theater without being treated to the
amazing newsreel pictures of several
hundred sheepish-looking Italians
dressed in black trunks hurdling
rows of upturned spears, or crash
ing through sheets of fire.
Yep, Benito was building an army
to make Superman look like a regu
lar pantiy - waist. Those were the
days—but they are gone forever.

r was a time when one heard
tales of the Italian soldier in
action—and a pretty poor specimen
he was. But for several months now
there haven't been reports of any
consequence about what the Black
shirts have been up to. Apparently
they haven't been very busy —or
maybe they arc still hurdling spears
and crashing through flames.
But a trickle of news has come
from inside Italy which would seem
to indicate that Mussolini has been
pretty busy with domestic troubles.
The truth, as far as «_an be learned,
is that the Italian people are sick to
death of this war.
In the last month their food and
clothing rations have been slashed
considerably and they have had no
glorious victories to sugar-coat
the pill. Italian naval successes
in the Mediterranean have fallen
off, and Gayda has been doing his
best to keep the people happy
with propaganda and fairy-tale
conquests. But he obviously lacks
the imagination of Dr. Gocbhels
and there is much unrest and dis
satisfaction among the people.

This factor is small comfort to
Britain and the Allies. The Italians
know as well as their Duce that they
are neck-deep in Friend Hitler's war
and it is too late to pull out now
even if they could — which they
can't.
They are in the worst possible
spot: they can't fight — every time
tliey try to they get licked—and they
can't fight because Hcrr Hitler wants
his rooting section and Mussolini
likes being Head Yell Leader.
