# Red Cross Goal Set at $1150
## Cardinals to Sponsor Drive Opening Nov. 3 
### 
The Stanford Cardinals, under the
chairmanship of Bess Paulson, fires
the opening gun of the University's
annual Red Cross drive next Mon
day, November 3.

This year because of the present
national emergency the goal of the
drive has been raised from $1000 to
$1150. All contributions are volun
tary and each living group will be
canvassed by committees which arc
being selected by Miss Paulson. The
heads of these committees in the
halls have already been named, and
they are: Emily Frank, Lagunita;
Ann Clare Brokaw, Roble; Bob
Crary, Encina; Joe McKellar, Se
quoia; and Jack Euphrat, Toyon.

Stanford, according to Miss Paul
son, has had an activc participation
in supporting the work of the
American Red Cross since 1916. She
added that the entire project is or
ganized entirely by students and its
success depends on the co-operation
of the whole Stanford student body.

"We have long had the reputation
here at Stanford of backing whole
heartedly every worthy cause for
which our aid has been asked. This
Red Cross drive is an opportunity
for every student on this campus to
add to that reputation by contribut
ing toward the goal of $1150 which
has been set for this university," said
Miss Paulson.
