Although the name of Edward

ner, who has been conducting nego
tiations with the band leader, ex

pects the signed contract to come
sometime today.
Acceptance of the committee's offer

was received from Ellington, otic of
the nation's greatest dance band
leaders, by telegram Monday.
COMMITTEE TO MEET
Sophomore Cotillion Committee
members will meet this afternoon at
5 in the Nitery to formally accept the
contract if it arrives and to decide
upon the dance theme.
"We want to feature Ellington's
smoothness as a dance band rather
than his jazz," reports Dick Dri.scoll,
decoration committee chairman.
"He's as famous for his distinctive
arrangements of such tunes as 'Fla
mingo' as he is for his swing music."
A Candlelight Ball with the light
ing done entirely with candles has
been suggested as a possible dance
theme. "This idea might be expen
sive, but if we can sell out our tick
ets, we can do it," adds Driscoll.
Mood Indigo also Tias been suggested
as a theme for the affair.
