# Indies Valuable, Says Dickason
## Newsman Stresses Defense Materials 
### 
Emphasizing the fact that the
United States should cultivate, stim
ulate, and co-operate with the Neth
erlands East Indies now, Deane
Diekason, newspaperman and pho
tographer who has spent the last 18
years studying their resources and
development., spoke to last night's
Tuesday Series audience on "The
Coveted East Indies."
Realizing that some Americans ad
vocate the concentration of our ef
forts and interest here, Mr. Dieka
son declared that "in this age of the
airplane, radio and telegraph, sucli
an attitude is selfish and futile, for
unless we help others to be free, we
cannot be free ourselves."
ECONOMIC STAKE
Many Americans arc indifferent to
our economic stake in the East In
dies, Mr. Diekason said. They pro
duce 94 per cent of the world's rub
ber supply, (iO per cent of the petro
leum, and 75 per cent of the tin, and
the United States' investment in
their industries amounts to $300,-
000,000.
They are a vast and expanding
; market, for American products, the
| speaker continued. "Despite higher
prices, everyone wants American
made goods, and even the lowliest
pariah knows the worth of Ameri
can products over those of Japan and
Germany."
The Allies are now extremely in
terested in the East Indies' vast
wealth of raw materials, but the
people of the Netherlands East In
dies are obstinate, hard-headed, and
determined never to permit inva
sion. They will fight if anyone at
tacks, with or without alliance.
ORDER IGNORED
Mr. Diekason declared that the
Netherlands East. Indies last April
sent a prepaid order to the United
States for 100,000 rifles and in Oc
tober the order had not even been
acknowledged.
"The Dutch arc not resentful or
expecting us to pull their chestnuts
j out of the fire. They realize that we
have just as many chestnuts on that
fire as they have," the speaker said,
but, in the words of a Dutch general,
"How can your government expect
j us to resist with no weapons?"
