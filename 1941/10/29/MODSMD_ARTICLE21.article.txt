# Excom Denies Benefits Of Primary Elections; Recommends No Change
## Bob McNeil, New Head of Defense Committee, Unable to Accept Job; Chairman's Position Now Open 
### BUD AMES 
Excom finally did something last night regarding Stanford's electoral
system, the subject under discussion at the last three meetings. They
decided to do nothing.
"The subcommittee has found that universities with primary systems
have the same troubles," pointed out Nancy Hurkett, spokesman. "In

addition, we could discover no other
solutions, and there is at present no
student demand for such a change.
"We recommend therefore that no
change be made in our electoral
system." The recommendation was
accepted â€” after the correction of
such words as "electoral" and "ir
relevant" which Miss Burkett could
not spell.
WAYS AND MEANS
Having thus dispensed with the
primary - versus - preferential prob
lem, Excom continued election dis
cussion by considering possible ways
of nullifying the effect of the cau
cus and of improving the present
preferential system.
"Well, if we could get 20 caucuses
going on the campus at the same

j time everybody would gel so con
fused that nobody would be back
ing anybody,' 1 suggested Betty Binns.
More constructive suggestions
were made. The possibility of a
more complete education of Stan
ford voters to the ways of the pref
erential system was discussed. Fi
nally the whole matter was tabled,
undoubtedly for discussion at some
future conclave.
"Gosh, what'll we talk about: next
week/' queried again Miss Binns.
LIKE CLOCKWORK
Other business of the evening was
handled one, two, three, four, hurry
up, it's beginning to bore.
Members of the Election Board,
now refreshed under the guidance
of Chairman Jim White, were named
1 and approved. Ponderance was given
the fact that Bob McNeil, appointed
fiead of the new Defense Committee,
will not be able to shoulder the task.
"We therefore need another chair
man," said George Jackson, A.S.S.U.
president, "and I would appreciate
getting in touch this week with all
persons who have the time to as
sume the responsibilities connected
with this chairmanship job."
Major appointment of the evening
| went to Junior Bob Crrtry who will
I head the Family Call Drive.
NO YELL LEADER
It was decided that no third yell
leader would be named to lead the
service section at football games.
"After all," suggested Larry Freer,
"maybe the soldiers and sailors don't
want to cheer for Stanford."
What started out. as a serious re
port on the Boy Scout Convention to
be pup-tented at Stanford Nov. 1 and
2 turned into a gag session as Chair
man Jack Pugh, of Ned Pugh fame,
reported on the ,4,000 expected little
visitors who will overrun the cam
j pus.
Someone suggested to Nancy Bur
; kett the rumor that the Kappas were
setting up a date bureau.
"I'm not agreeing and I'm not de
nying it," she fought back. "But it
i lias possibilities."
