# 'King of Jazz' Scorns Set Orchestra Style
## 
### BOB O'NEILL 
"Take Glen Miller, for instance. Glen's flicked with a solid blend, and
good, too. But I can show you spots in old Whiternan records where we
used that very same blend 15 years ago."
Paul Whiteman, the King of Jazz, raised his voice to he heard ahove
his orchestra's music in the Rose Room Howl, Palace Hotel, and went on

to say that the musical styles of all
"name" bands were originated when
swing was unknown—in the days
when Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey,
Bix Biederbecke, Jack Teagarden,
and Henry Busse were playing under
his, Whiteman's, baton.
"One time we were playing in a
New York hotel where Dick Rimber
was staying. We were working on a
tune in which we used some pyra
mids (chords built up by several
brass instruments). Dick came up
to me and said he liked the arrange
ment; that it had possibilities for a
definite style and he maintained if
you played those pyramids long
enough you'd create a style. Well,
he did."

Whiteman started talking about
modern music, calling all the band
leaders by their first names, which
became a bit confusing at times.
"Tommy and Jimmy were two
swell kids, both of them fine musi
cians'. Jimmy has come up fast,* 1
think, and his smooth styling has
really caught on with the public
right now. They ride on top for a
while and then another style comes
along. That is why I don't have a
set style myself but keep four ar
rangers working all the lime; we
play everything.
"Charlie Bainett plays his stuff
light uses a lot of instrumentation.
Artie Shaw's stuff isn't new either.
He takes a passage and then the
band answers him; in the old days
we used to call that instrumenta
tion 'conversation.'
"And take all your swing tunes—
they're nothing but our old riffs
dressed up and stretched out. The
big trouble is that nothing new is
being written. I'd like to see these
young kids start in on original mod
ern music; that's the only way we'll
ever get any more 'Rhapsodies in
Blue'."
Concluding ihe interview, White
man remarked, "I think that kids lx'-
tween the second year of high
school and the second year of col
lege have the best sense of rhythm.
After that they get too romantic."

"One time we were playing in a
New York hotel where Dick Rimber
was staying. We were working on a
tune in which we used some pyra
mids (chords built up by several
brass instruments). Dick came up
to me and said he liked the arrange
ment; that it had possibilities for a
definite style and he maintained if
you played those pyramids long
enough you'd create a style. Well,
he did."

Whiteman started talking about
modern music, calling all the band
leaders by their first names, which
became a bit confusing at times.
"Tommy and Jimmy were two
swell kids, both of them fine musi
cians'. Jimmy has come up fast,* 1
think, and his smooth styling has
really caught on with the public
right now. They ride on top for a
while and then another style comes
along. That is why I don't have a
set style myself but keep four ar
rangers working all the lime; we
play everything.
"Charlie Bainett plays his stuff
light uses a lot of instrumentation.
Artie Shaw's stuff isn't new either.
He takes a passage and then the
band answers him; in the old days
we used to call that instrumenta
tion 'conversation.'
"And take all your swing tunes—
they're nothing but our old riffs
dressed up and stretched out. The
big trouble is that nothing new is
being written. I'd like to see these
young kids start in on original mod
ern music; that's the only way we'll
ever get any more 'Rhapsodies in
Blue'."
Concluding ihe interview, White
man remarked, "I think that kids lx'-
tween the second year of high
school and the second year of col
lege have the best sense of rhythm.
After that they get too romantic."
"Take Glen Miller, for instance. Glen's flicked with a solid blend, and
good, too. But I can show you spots in old Whiternan records where we
used that very same blend 15 years ago."
Paul Whiteman, the King of Jazz, raised his voice to he heard ahove
his orchestra's music in the Rose Room Howl, Palace Hotel, and went on

to say that the musical styles of all
"name" bands were originated when
swing was unknown—in the days
when Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey,
Bix Biederbecke, Jack Teagarden,
and Henry Busse were playing under
his, Whiteman's, baton.
