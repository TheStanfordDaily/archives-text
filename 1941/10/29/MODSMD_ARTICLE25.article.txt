### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2k (UP).â€”
Months of conjecture over the latest
creation of the inventive mind of
John K. Northrop ended tonight
when the noted airplane designer
disclosed details of his new "Flying
Wing" plane, a bat-like airship en
tirely lacking a fuselage and tail, and
speedier than present craft.
