United Press Staff Correspondent
NEW YORK, Oct. 28 (UP).—lf it's
at ;d I possible to read a man's
thoughts from the look on his face,
you can forget about the Texases,
ihe Dukes and the Fordhams for the
Rose Bowl. Dismiss them just as
you'd brush off Swarthmore or Slip
pery Rock—for the lucky winner
of football's biggest bingo contest is
going to be the Navy.

That is, it's going to be the Navy
and a couple of if's. First, if I prop
erly interpreted the expressions
which flitted tod;iy over the battered
countenance of Emory Ellsworth
Larsen, the Marine who landed at
Annapolis a couple of years ago and
has the situation well in hand. Sec
ond, if said Major Larsen gets co-op
eration from the 40 young officers he
has molded into the football power
house of the East.
HOWL BID HOPED FOR
Swede Larsen has brought the
Middies quite a way in the past two
seasons, but he isn't finished yet. Far
from it. He's figuring now on taking
them a whole lot farther, and by
farther I mean out into the nice,
warm sun that beats down on Pasa
dena around New Year's Day. The
Major not only isn't ducking a Bowl
bid. he frankly hopes to obtain one.
At the moment. Navy is unde
feated. The Middies have crushed
four rivals, 128 points to 2, and form
the only team in America on which
not even one touchdown has been
scored. The only blot on the record
is a scoreless tie with Harvard. That,
observers report, was just one of
those things. Navy didn't take Har
vard seriously, fumbled umpteen
times—and, socko! But that is all
changed now, but drastically.
FACE UNBEATEN PENN
Which brings us back to the Ma
jor and his expressions and thoughts.
This week Larsen sends his team
against undefeated Penn and as he
phrases it himself—"This isn't just
a game we want to win, it is one
we've got to win." When he says
that, his face jells into a fair replica
oi Bismarck s iron fist. He means
it. and how. And as for the rest of
the games, it's more of the same.
Unless Navy goes through unde
featod, Major Emory Ellsworth Lar
sen is liable to find himself trans
ferred to an obscure command in
Iceland.
Supposing, now, that Larsen does
get the co-operation from his boys
and the Middies do roll through un
defeated. Would they get the bid,
say to the Rose Bowl? .Put it this
way—the United States is spending
billions of dollars on defense and the
citizens are spending millions to
keep the boys in the army and navy
happy. The selectees get free tickets
to all sport events, at least in this
territory, so what would be more
fitting than that the Navy was given
the ticket to the big saucer in the
Arroyo Seco?
Shucks, men, open the gates. The
anchors are aweigh.
