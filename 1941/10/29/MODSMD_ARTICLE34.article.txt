# SLANTING SIDELINES..

### H. D. THOREAU 
I AST Saturday afternoon 75 brave
people, huddling around portable
radios, watched the frosh clean up
on the Alhambra Athletic Club,
while the varsity was cleaning up on
the Huskies in Seattle, and while
the frats were cleaning up on the
Class of '44 up on the row.
These rugged individualists who
tried to divide their Attentions be
tween listening to the varsity,
watching the frosh, and keeping
warm, spent an afternoon that was
well worth their while, since the
Papooses showed a quarterback that
made shades of Nevers, Grayson,
and Albeit pass across old timers'
minds.
Jim Pettit did some very astound
ing things with the football, but
most of them turned out for the
best and were the main reason why
the Class of '45 outpointed the
alumni of the Alhambra High School
of Martinez, California, headed by
Changing Chuck DiMnggio.

A FTER watching the Oklahoma
Sooners hang one on Santa Clara
last Saturday in Oklahoma City,
Stanford's line coach, Phil Bengtson,
was handed another surprise. His
attempts to get aeroplane connec
tions back the coast were thwart
ed, so he was left with only one
alternative—to come back on the
train with the Broncs.

Sunday when the train was held
up due to storms which seem to be
pervading the country, most people
thought, "what a break for Stan
ford," since Santa Clara would have
one and maybe two fewer days of
practice before the game which de
cides the championship of the Santa
Clara Valley. What they did not
consider was that the rain kept
Bengtson back also, and therefore
Stanford could not have a chance

to practice their defense against the
Bronc plays which Phil had so care
fully noted.
However, we foiled them. Bengt
son detrained at Tuscon and finally
got a plane which got him in here
Monday night, while the Broncs
frittered away their time on the
choo choo until yesterday.

\ LTHOUGH scouting plays a ma
jor part in present day football, oc
casionally it backfires. Last week
during practice the local team was
informed that Means, Husky quar
ter, was the weak man in the Husky
backfield on pass defense. Conse
quently the opening pass of the
game was thrown from Frankie Al-

Assistant Sports Editor

Bert to Freddie Meyer down in
Means corner of the tertiary. The
weak link not only kept Meyer from
completing the play, but actually in
tercepted the pass. However, this is
only an isolated example, and 50
examples to the contrary would
show the part Marchie Schwartz

.scouting played in defeating Wash
ington.

T> ACK in the dark ages Mr. Stan
; ford of the Central Pacific R.R.
must have gotten something on Mr.
Curtis of the Curtis Publishing Co.
This morning next Saturday's Sat
urday Evening Post will go on sale.
In ft is an article entitled. "Is
Shaughnessy Behind the Eight
Ball?" or "Luck or Skill" or some
thing to that effect. It was only a
, few weeks back that the same week
| ly rag came out with a story, when
I say story I don't mean article, by
Bud Spencer on Frankie Albert and
the T.

Now it seems to me that it must
; be blackmail when two such similar
| pieces appear within such a short
| space of time. Of course this one
may be retribution for the first,
which, if. true, is quite feasible.

I noon's running of the Husky-
Card flickers in the Ed Aud, Pete
Kmetovic's ramble last Saturday

tional as the one which he executed
| against Nebraska last New Year's
Day.

After much deliberation I have
arrived at the conclusion that the
I chief value of these jaunts of Kmet's
lies not in the immediate damage
done to the opponents, but to the

I AST Saturday afternoon 75 brave
people, huddling around portable
radios, watched the frosh clean up
on the Alhambra Athletic Club,
while the varsity was cleaning up on
the Huskies in Seattle, and while
the frats were cleaning up on the
Class of '44 up on the row.
These rugged individualists who
tried to divide their Attentions be
tween listening to the varsity,
watching the frosh, and keeping
warm, spent an afternoon that was
well worth their while, since the
Papooses showed a quarterback that
made shades of Nevers, Grayson,
and Albeit pass across old timers'
minds.
Jim Pettit did some very astound
ing things with the football, but
most of them turned out for the
best and were the main reason why
the Class of '45 outpointed the
alumni of the Alhambra High School
of Martinez, California, headed by
Changing Chuck DiMnggio.

A FTER watching the Oklahoma
Sooners hang one on Santa Clara
last Saturday in Oklahoma City,
Stanford's line coach, Phil Bengtson,
was handed another surprise. His
attempts to get aeroplane connec
tions back the coast were thwart
ed, so he was left with only one
alternative—to come back on the
train with the Broncs.

Sunday when the train was held
up due to storms which seem to be
pervading the country, most people
thought, "what a break for Stan
ford," since Santa Clara would have
one and maybe two fewer days of
practice before the game which de
cides the championship of the Santa
Clara Valley. What they did not
consider was that the rain kept
Bengtson back also, and therefore
Stanford could not have a chance

to practice their defense against the
Bronc plays which Phil had so care
fully noted.
However, we foiled them. Bengt

I AST Saturday afternoon 75 brave
people, huddling around portable
radios, watched the frosh clean up
on the Alhambra Athletic Club,
while the varsity was cleaning up on
the Huskies in Seattle, and while
the frats were cleaning up on the
Class of '44 up on the row.
These rugged individualists who
tried to divide their Attentions be
tween listening to the varsity,
watching the frosh, and keeping
warm, spent an afternoon that was
well worth their while, since the
Papooses showed a quarterback that
made shades of Nevers, Grayson,
and Albeit pass across old timers'
minds.
Jim Pettit did some very astound
ing things with the football, but
most of them turned out for the
best and were the main reason why
the Class of '45 outpointed the
alumni of the Alhambra High School
of Martinez, California, headed by
Changing Chuck DiMnggio.

A FTER watching the Oklahoma
Sooners hang one on Santa Clara
last Saturday in Oklahoma City,
Stanford's line coach, Phil Bengtson,
was handed another surprise. His
attempts to get aeroplane connec
tions back the coast were thwart
ed, so he was left with only one
alternative—to come back on the
train with the Broncs.

Sunday when the train was held
up due to storms which seem to be
pervading the country, most people
thought, "what a break for Stan
ford," since Santa Clara would have
one and maybe two fewer days of
practice before the game which de
cides the championship of the Santa
Clara Valley. What they did not
consider was that the rain kept
Bengtson back also, and therefore
Stanford could not have a chance

to practice their defense against the
Bronc plays which Phil had so care
fully noted.
However, we foiled them. Bengt
son detrained at Tuscon and finally
got a plane which got him in here
Monday night, while the Broncs
frittered away their time on the
choo choo until yesterday.

\ LTHOUGH scouting plays a ma
jor part in present day football, oc
casionally it backfires. Last week
during practice the local team was
informed that Means, Husky quar
ter, was the weak man in the Husky
backfield on pass defense. Conse
quently the opening pass of the
game was thrown from Frankie Al-

Assistant Sports Editor

Bert to Freddie Meyer down in
Means corner of the tertiary. The
weak link not only kept Meyer from
completing the play, but actually in
tercepted the pass. However, this is
only an isolated example, and 50
examples to the contrary would
show the part Marchie Schwartz

.scouting played in defeating Wash
ington.

T> ACK in the dark ages Mr. Stan
; ford of the Central Pacific R.R.
must have gotten something on Mr.
Curtis of the Curtis Publishing Co.
This morning next Saturday's Sat
urday Evening Post will go on sale.
In ft is an article entitled. "Is
Shaughnessy Behind the Eight
Ball?" or "Luck or Skill" or some
thing to that effect. It was only a
, few weeks back that the same week
| ly rag came out with a story, when
I say story I don't mean article, by
Bud Spencer on Frankie Albert and
the T.

Now it seems to me that it must
; be blackmail when two such similar
| pieces appear within such a short
| space of time. Of course this one
may be retribution for the first,
which, if. true, is quite feasible.

! AS SHOWN in yesterday after-
I noon's running of the Husky-
Card flickers in the Ed Aud, Pete
Kmetovic's ramble last Saturday
