# Stahle to Lead Indians in Vital Bronco Fracas
## 
### 
Doug Stable, big Stanford center,
was chosen captain last night for the
Santa Clara game Saturday. He
will lead the Indians in their big
i non-conference game of the year, a
game which always has a great ef
fect on Stanford's national prestige.
Regardless of odds, which have
the Rose Bowl leaders at 10-6, both
teams this Saturday will go into the
game with important psychological
advantages.
The Indians didn't consider 7-6
enough of a beating last year to
compensate for four years of Bronco
domination despite the fact that the
score didn't truly state Stanford's
superiority.
GOOD FRAME OF MIND
Stanford's frame of mind this
week couldn't be better. Many of
the Indians would rather beat Santa
Clara than any other rival. Boys
like Chuck Taylor who have lived
around San Jose have special rea
sons, of course, for whipping the
Broncs.
Then the Santa Clara fracas is a
Big Game in its own right, for years
I ago, when Cal was playing Ameri
can football and Stanford held onto
| rugby, Santa Clara was the Cards'
chief rival.
With the squad in the best con
dition it has been in for several
weeks, the prospect of a dry field,
and the fact that the game is being
played at home, Stanford fans are
looking for one of the Indians' best
performances.
BRONCS OUT FOR BLOOD
The Broncos, on the other hand.
] are in a nasty mood after dropping
[ that game to Oklahoma in the mud,
and are not to be trifled with this
week-end. They remember that
only three points kept them from an
undefeated season last year, one of
those missing digits being Jimmy
Johnson's conversion attempt against
Stanford. A tie with the Indians
would have gained much prestige for
Santa Clara at the end of the sea
| son when people began to realize
how good Stanford was.
Last year's touchdown was a 50-
yard heave from Casanega to Thorn
; and this year Kenny teams up with
Alyn Beals in an even more deadly
combination.
AT CROSSROADS
Either team, with a win Saturday,
could go on to a splendid season, for
, each has only one defeat. So if atti
! tude means anything, Saturday's
battle is going to be tough.
Stanford worked out yesterday
with the secqnd team scrimmaging
j some frosh reserves. Phil Bengtson,
who scouted the Bronc-Sooner
i game, ran his Blacks in Santa Clara
| formation against the first string.

performances.
BRONCS OUT FOR BLOOD
The Broncos, on the other hand.
] are in a nasty mood after dropping
[ that game to Oklahoma in the mud,
and are not to be trifled with this
week-end. They remember that
only three points kept them from an
undefeated season last year, one of
those missing digits being Jimmy
Johnson's conversion attempt against
Stanford. A tie with the Indians
would have gained much prestige for
Santa Clara at the end of the sea
| son when people began to realize
how good Stanford was.
Last year's touchdown was a 50-
yard heave from Casanega to Thorn
; and this year Kenny teams up with
Alyn Beals in an even more deadly
combination.
AT CROSSROADS
Either team, with a win Saturday,
could go on to a splendid season, for
, each has only one defeat. So if atti
! tude means anything, Saturday's
battle is going to be tough.
Stanford worked out yesterday
with the secqnd team scrimmaging
j some frosh reserves. Phil Bengtson,
who scouted the Bronc-Sooner
i game, ran his Blacks in Santa Clara
| formation against the first string.
Doug Stable, big Stanford center,
was chosen captain last night for the
Santa Clara game Saturday. He
will lead the Indians in their big
i non-conference game of the year, a
game which always has a great ef
fect on Stanford's national prestige.
Regardless of odds, which have
the Rose Bowl leaders at 10-6, both
teams this Saturday will go into the
game with important psychological
advantages.
The Indians didn't consider 7-6
enough of a beating last year to
compensate for four years of Bronco
domination despite the fact that the
score didn't truly state Stanford's
superiority.
GOOD FRAME OF MIND
Stanford's frame of mind this
week couldn't be better. Many of
the Indians would rather beat Santa
Clara than any other rival. Boys
like Chuck Taylor who have lived
around San Jose have special rea
sons, of course, for whipping the
Broncs.
Then the Santa Clara fracas is a
Big Game in its own right, for years
I ago, when Cal was playing Ameri
can football and Stanford held onto
| rugby, Santa Clara was the Cards'
chief rival.
With the squad in the best con
dition it has been in for several
weeks, the prospect of a dry field,
and the fact that the game is being
played at home, Stanford fans are
looking for one of the Indians' best
performances.
