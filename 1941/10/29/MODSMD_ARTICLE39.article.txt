# Hot Firehouse Pitches Campo
## 
### 
Scoring 41 points and still block
ing for keeps, Firehouse blanked El
Campo to win the title of League 1
in the intramural grid circuit yes
terday and entered upon a resting
period while some 30 other teams
contest for the privilege of being
next in line for the slaughter.
El Campo provided the other
seven men on the field to make the
game legal, but outside of that duty
their efforts were of little avail be
fore the blocking attack of the siren
winders. Monte Pfyl was general
chairman of the meeting, which in
cluded some superior by
Tom Kruger, Wyland Cripe, George
Kaufman, and Frank Farrel. Re
membering that the Campos weren't
exactly a breather if their 28-0 and
33-6 wins over Alpha Sigma Phi and
Tigre mean anything, the power of
the champion's attack is clear.
DEKES FAVORED
Most able to understand this fact
will be the winners of the nine other
leagues who will have to meet the
Fireboys in the course of the gen
eral playoffs. Delta Kappa Epsilon
definitely qualified as one of the "fa
vored" few when intramural man
ager Bob Burnett announced that
they had been awarded a 1-0 deci
sion over Phi Psi II which had pre
viously been entered on the books
as a forfeit against them. The
Dekes gain the championship in
League 7 by the ruling.
PHI KAPS WIN
Phi Kappa Sigma's Dyek passed
to Fred Pruter for 40 yards to bring
a 6 to 0 win over A.T.O. The Phi
Kaps end their year with a 50-50
average and the memory of a lot of
bad breaks against them.
Theta Chi accomplished the same
feat by topping Medical School II 6
to 0 on a pass, again for 40 yards, by
Dick Jenkins. Bullpen won on a
forfeit from Encina 3E, 1 to 0.
Gerald Roinestad accounted for 12
points to lead his 4E squad in a vic
tory over lE, 12 to 0. 4E could tie
for first in League 9 if 2E drops its
coming game with the Bullpen.
