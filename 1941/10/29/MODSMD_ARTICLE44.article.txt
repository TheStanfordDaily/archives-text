# Frosh Splashers To Play San Jose
## 
### 
With four straight wins behind
them, Stanford's freshman water
polo team tangles with the San Jose
State freshmen Friday night. The
game, scheduled for 8 o'clock, will
be a preliminary to the San Jose
State-Stanford varsity fracas.

Three younger brothers of Stan
ford mermen hold down tentative
first-string positions. Phil Lee,
brother of Pete Lee, varsity goalie,
plays a guard position, while Dick
Narver, sprint, and Alan Weeden,
forward, had brothers on the 1940
varsity squad.

Completing the probable starting
line-up Friday are Willard Bell,
high scoring forward; Hank Salton
stall, center back; Jim Wilkinson,
guard; and Jim Noble, goalie.

After dropping their first game, 8
to 7, to Sequoia High School, the
Indian babes, coached by Harvey
Rothschild, have improved rapidly,
defeating the Compton J.C. reserves,
6 to 5, Palo Alto High School, 10 to
9; Sequoia, 9 to 4; and San Fran
cisco J.C., 11 to 5.
