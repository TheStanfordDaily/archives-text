THROUGH an error yesterday morning's edi
torial column carried the statement "Back
Hitler until England is beaten, say 37 per cent."
The statement should have been reversed to
read "Back England until Hitler is beaten, say
37 per cent." Authorship of the article was erro
neously attributed to Milton Silverman rather
than Herman Silverman.
