# Axis Reaction

### 
THE Axis opened its mouth yesterday and
unleashed a vitriolic attack on President
Roosevelt and his stand taken Monday in his
Navy Day speech.
Premier Mussolini told 50,000 fanatic Fascists,
howling hatred at the United States in the Ven
ice Palace square, that the Axis will crush the
United States and all other anti-Axis forces upon
the face of the globe. Mussolini, the creature
that accepts bones from Hitler's table, barked
vociferously. We believe he is barking up the
wrong tree.
Berlin composed itself, looked at the situation
objectively, and quietly commented that Mr.
Roosevelt's speech was the "ravings of a lunatic
or a criminal," and that it was "in more than
one sense the final step toward an undeclared
shooting war by the United States."
Voelkischer Beobachter, Nazi party organ,
condescended to say that "Franklin Delano Roo
sevelt is not crazy, but simply a political coun
terfeiter and shameless gangster."
The essence of the President's speech was
this:
"Today in the face of the newest and greatest
challenge, we Americans have cleared our
decks and taken our battle stations. We stand
ready in the defense of our Nation and the faith
of our fathers to do what God has given us the
power to see as our full duty."
America supports the President. This is a fact

that was proved yesterday. Telephone and tele
graph communications to Mr. Roosevelt yester
day were 8 to 1 in favor of his stand, according
to a United Press dispatch received last night.
Perhaps we have come to the final parting of
the ways with the Axis.—Harold Shafer
