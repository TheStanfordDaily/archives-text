### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
COFFEE IS WARM ON A COLO NIGIIT

I STUDIED late the other night, so at three in the
morning I drove down to Paly for a cup of coffee.
It was a cold, foggy, wet night so I drank two cups. On
the way back, I saw two young men, one lying in the
gutter, the other sitting on the curb in front of the
B.A.C. I asked myself, do you know these two boys,
and also, isn't it funny that they're sitting there at
this time in the morning? I answered myself, saying,
yes I do know those two boys, and if you mean strange
and not funny, yes to the second question also. So I
stopped the car.
"Hello and what are you doing?" I asked.
"Resting and hello," said the one sitting on the curb.
The other one just looked up, groaned and went back
to the gutter.
"Are you two drunk?"
"No, we are resting."
"Aren't you sleepy?"
"Yes."
"Everyone that I know goes to bed when they are
sleepy. Why don't you go to bed?"
The one in the gutter looked up again, then groaned
and rolled back to the gutter. The other was much
more patient, and obviously wanted to clear things up
for me. "Hell Week," he said.
"Oh," I said, and reached into my pocket for a
cigarette. The cigarette brought both boys to atten
tion, and they watched me carefully, their lips twitch
ing, their eyes sparkling.
"Oh, I'm sorry. Here," and I handed them the
pack.
For a minute there was a fast debate. I could see
the ideas working through their heads . . .
Shall I go through with this damn thing . . . maybe
I won't be a good Row man . . . cigarettes, smoke
and matches . . . smoke in . . . smoke out . . . rush
ing . . . pledging ... I hate it ... I quit the whole
thing.
He said finally, "Can't smoke. Hell Week."
"What do you guys do all day?"
"Exercise," he said, and there was another groan
from the gutter.
"Exercise?"
"Exercise. We run around the house, we do push
ups, we get paddled, we take long walks in the
country, and we exercise."
"Is it fun?"
"Fun? I haven't slept for three days. I've got a
terrible cold. I've got tests coming. I've got papers
due, and still I have to smile and say, 'Yes sir,' and
exercise."
"That's terrible," I said.
"Things are going to be changed when I get up in
that house," he said.
We turned and saw that our friend in the gutter
was sound asleep. The talkative one woke him up
and got ready to leave.
"We've got to go," he said. "We got to get back
at four o'clock for exercises. So long."
And they hobbled down the road, one leaning on
the other and the other leaning on the other. If they
hadn't looked so funny, it would have been tragic.
I kept thinking that when those two and others like
them got up in the house, the rough edges of Hell
Week would be smoothed out. But it was a cold night,
I didn't stop to figure the thing out.

"Is it fun?"
"Fun? I haven't slept for three days. I've got a
terrible cold. I've got tests coming. I've got papers
due, and still I have to smile and say, 'Yes sir,' and
exercise."
"That's terrible," I said.
"Things are going to be changed when I get up in
that house," he said.
We turned and saw that our friend in the gutter
was sound asleep. The talkative one woke him up
and got ready to leave.
"We've got to go," he said. "We got to get back
at four o'clock for exercises. So long."
And they hobbled down the road, one leaning on
the other and the other leaning on the other. If they
hadn't looked so funny, it would have been tragic.
I kept thinking that when those two and others like
them got up in the house, the rough edges of Hell
Week would be smoothed out. But it was a cold night,
I didn't stop to figure the thing out.
COFFEE IS WARM ON A COLO NIGIIT

I STUDIED late the other night, so at three in the
morning I drove down to Paly for a cup of coffee.
It was a cold, foggy, wet night so I drank two cups. On
the way back, I saw two young men, one lying in the
gutter, the other sitting on the curb in front of the
B.A.C. I asked myself, do you know these two boys,
and also, isn't it funny that they're sitting there at
this time in the morning? I answered myself, saying,
yes I do know those two boys, and if you mean strange
and not funny, yes to the second question also. So I
stopped the car.
"Hello and what are you doing?" I asked.
"Resting and hello," said the one sitting on the curb.
The other one just looked up, groaned and went back
to the gutter.
"Are you two drunk?"
"No, we are resting."
"Aren't you sleepy?"
"Yes."
"Everyone that I know goes to bed when they are
sleepy. Why don't you go to bed?"
The one in the gutter looked up again, then groaned
and rolled back to the gutter. The other was much
more patient, and obviously wanted to clear things up
for me. "Hell Week," he said.
"Oh," I said, and reached into my pocket for a
cigarette. The cigarette brought both boys to atten
tion, and they watched me carefully, their lips twitch
ing, their eyes sparkling.
"Oh, I'm sorry. Here," and I handed them the
pack.
For a minute there was a fast debate. I could see
the ideas working through their heads . . .
Shall I go through with this damn thing . . . maybe
I won't be a good Row man . . . cigarettes, smoke
and matches . . . smoke in . . . smoke out . . . rush
ing . . . pledging ... I hate it ... I quit the whole
thing.
He said finally, "Can't smoke. Hell Week."
"What do you guys do all day?"
"Exercise," he said, and there was another groan
from the gutter.
"Exercise?"
"Exercise. We run around the house, we do push
ups, we get paddled, we take long walks in the
country, and we exercise."
"Is it fun?"
"Fun? I haven't slept for three days. I've got a
terrible cold. I've got tests coming. I've got papers
due, and still I have to smile and say, 'Yes sir,' and
exercise."
