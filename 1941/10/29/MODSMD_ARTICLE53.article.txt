MELLINKOFF OBSCURE?

r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
Mr. Mellinkoff has let off a lot of steam; for pur
pose of camouflage rather than locomotion, I fear.
In his eloquent indignance, so unbecoming to a man
of science, he leaves unanswered, or what is worse,
obscured, some of the more basic questions that bother
one who soon expccts to be asked to kill or be killed
for his country.

Take, for example, his beautiful phrase, "our fight
for freedom." Mr. Mellinkoff doesn't say which of
the meanings of the term "freedom" he has in mind,
but I am sure he must have at least one in mind, for
there are so many. There is, on the other hand, the
freedom which true democrats cherish, the freedom
between equals; this is a type of freedom of which all
are allowed to partake; it is responsible freedom, in
volving mutual obligations to respect the rights of
others; it is definitely limited freedom for the in
dividual in order that unlimited freedom for the com
munity may prevail. There is, on the other hand, the
freedom which true aristocrats cherish, the freedom
of master over slave; this is the type of freedom of
which few are allowed to partake; it is irresponsible
freedom, involving no obligations outside of that of
maintaining suppression of the slave; it is unlimited
freedom for the individual in order that limited free
dom for the community may prevail.

Given the term freedom in this latter sense, can
we not say that Germany is fighting for freedom, free
dom from British and American domination, just as
Japan and Italy are fighting for freedom? I ask what
sort of freedom the British are fighting for, and arc
asking America to fight for, when Mr. Churchill and
Mr. Roosevelt propose to defeat the aggressor, dis
arm him, but not themselves, and police the worldâ€”
for freedom. P'reedom for whom? Frankly, I am not
patriot enough to fight for this type of freedom.
Wc don't propose, to make Germany our equal, we
propose to make her our slave!
We say we are fighting militarism. Do wc fight all
militarism or only that which might possibly be di
rected against us? We say we are fighting an "army
of murderers." Are all armies murderers, or just
the German army? Do we fight all murderers, or just
those who turn their weapons upon us? We say. we
are fighting fascism. Do we fight all fascists, or only
those who threaten our security?

We seek friendship with South America not be
cause we want to be "good neighbors" but because we
don't want the South Americans to be bad neighbors.
The people of South America can thank Adolf Hitler,
and not America, for the half way decent treatment
they have been led to expect from the United States.

This has been a rather naive attempt to answer the
all important question: "What arc we fighting for?"
We seem to be fighting for one thing only, American
security. Love for security has long been the motiva
tion of British. American, as well as German foreign
policy. It merely remains, then, to determine what is
the best way of providing for our own security. We
should perhaps confine our debate to this question.
The rather troublesome question of whether love for
our own security, above all else, even though it mean
insecurity for half of mankind, is consistent with the
democratic ideal can best be left to men of a less
practical turn of mind. Or perhaps there will be
time enough to reflect upon it after we have wiped
out the "army of murderers."
Yours truly,
Willard F. Mitchcll
