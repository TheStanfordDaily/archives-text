Letters written by Katherine
Mansfield, Jack London, Noel Cow
ard, and many other well known
British and American authors are
on display this week in the Felton
Library, announces Mrs. Violet L.
Shue, head of that department.

First to be seen on the "Holo
graph Letters of American and
British Authors" are those of Jack
London to his literary agent in Lon
don, James B. Pinker. One letter is
dated "May 26, 1904," and was writ
ten while London was employed as
a newspaper correspondent covering
the Russo-Japanese War. At the
time he composed this letter he was
with the .First Japanese Army in
Feng-Wang-Cheng, Manchuria.

In the letter he asks his agent to
do something about the American
Magazine giving away serial rights
to his short story, "Marriage of Lit-
Lit." He also mentions that he will
soon be returning to his home in
California. It was during this year of
1904 that he wrote his well known
book, "The Sea Wolf."
MANSFIELD LETTERS
On the second shelf of the case are
displayed some personal letters of
Katherine Mansfield to her close
friend Lady Ottoline Morrell. This
letter, which is undated, was writ
ten sometimes during the period of
her life after 1915 in which she re
mained in a state of semi-illness un
til her death in 1923. In this note,
written at Fontainebleau, she ex
plains why she had not attempted to
compose any stories for many
months. "Ive only external things to
sayâ€”things that don't matter," says
the letter.

She also mentions that she hoped
to be returning to London soon.
Katherine Mansfield was born in
1888 and died of tuberculosis in
1923, but during those years, start
ing at nine years of age, she became
one of Britain's best short story
authors.

Next are the letters of America's
poet, William Bliss Carman, who
although he was born in Canada,
spent the greater part of his life in
the States. This collection includes
business letters to Mr. Robert S.
Yard, publisher, and the manuscript
of "A Toast to Tusitala," a poem
Carman wrote honoring Robert
Louis Stevenson. It is dated No
vember 1900.
DIED IN POVERTY
Of the many collections of poems
Bliss Carman published, "The Pipes
of Pan" series was his best liked
and known. Although he held
many editorial positions and was
editor of the Oxford Book of Ameri
can Verse, he died in almost com
plete poverty.

Single letters of other famed au
thors are shown in a second case.
These include such writers as Jo
seph Conrad, Noel Coward, R. W.
Emerson, O. W. Holmes, and John
G. Whittier to mention a few.

The exhibit, which opened last
Friday, will be open to all who are
interested. The lilarary requests that
