Three college editors told a nation
wide radio audience in a broadcast
Friday that "American youth is
ready to fight because only by war
itself can the menace of Hitlerism
be defeated."

The three men, all of draft age,
spoke from New York City over the
Columbia Broadcasting System in a
symposium sponsored by the First
to-Fight Division, youth group of
the Fight for Freedom.

Chairman of the Daily Princeton
ian, John N. Brooks Jr., stated that
"the debate between the isolation
ists and interventionists was fun
while it lasted, but America today
is irrevocably committed to the
defeat of Hitlerism, even at the cost
of total war. Only a small minority
fail to realize that the issue is de
cided, and still raise their voices of
obstruction in belated protest." Lor
en Hickerson, editor of The Daily
lowan, spoke from Chicago, declar
ing that "we are in this war—now.
The United States is pitted against
the Nazi philosophy in a death
struggle."

Editor Charles P. Gyllenhaal, of
The Daily Pennsylvanian, said that
"America's young people believe
there is nothing more important than
the final and complete defeat of
Nazi Germany. We are convinced
that this can only be accomplished
by the immediate entrance of the
United States into an active war."

All three men stressed that youth's
job will be two-fold: to win the
war, and to win the peace. Brooks
declared that the "American policy
must be not the defeat of Hitler in
itself, but the establishment of an
orderly international society living
in accordance with the democratic
way of life, a society in which the
cataclysm of World War will never
be permitted to recur."
