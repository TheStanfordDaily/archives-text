### AMIE REICHERT 
yoR ten days now the Nazis have
been putting the pressure on
the Crimean peninsula. Yesterday
they really turned the screws.
Berlin reported that "bomber
pared infantry was streaming
through the shattered Russian for
tifications" of the narrow Perekop
ithsmus which links the Crimea
with the mainland.
If this is true, the panzers may
well be poised for an easy hop, skip,
and jump to the strait of Yanikale,
only four miles from the heart of
the Caucasus.
The new advance is a dangerous
one. Loss of the Crimea would
in itself be a body blow to Rus
sia's hard-pressed southern front,
containing as it does the nation's
second largest deposits of iron ore
and the main naval base for the
lilack Seas fleet (Sevastopol).
But more to be feared than the
occupation of the Crimea itself is
the prospect of what would happen
next. Apparently the Crimea spear
head is maneuvering into a position
where it can join with the advance
from the Donets Valley in a gigantic
death-pincer around Rostov and the
Northern Caucasus.

IF THIS operation should succeed,
not only would the oil pipelines
of the Caucasus be cut off from the
Red Army, but also the ever-swell
ing stream of supplies from Britain
and America via this southern route.
This is, of course, what the Nazis
are driving at. An interesting thing
here is the co-ordination and tim
ing of the two spearheads. (Cri
mean and Donets Valley) involved
in the maneuver. The Nazis cut
oIT the peninsula several weeks
ago; then proceeded along its
northern periphery to the out
skirts of Rostov. Now that Khar
kov—and the major part of the
Donets Valley are theirs, an of
fense against the Crimea is pushed
forward and the two columns will
meet—as soon as the Russians will
allow.

How long this will be is the x
quantity in the situation. But at the
moment things don't look any too
good for the Allies. British war ex
perts expressed the fear last night
that the Russian southern armies
have lost so heavily in men and
equipment that they have not been
able to form a strong, co-ordinated
front and may not be able to hold
long.
However, it is still a little too early
to tell.

r JPHE silver lining to all this gloom
is Archibald Wavcll and the
million-man British Indian Army
he commands. These troops, at
present massed in the north of Iran,
could come to the aid of the Rus
sians in the Caucasus if Churchill
gave the word.
As it is now, the German threat
is gravest to the North Caucasus,
and fortunately, the bulk of Cau
casian oil (about 85 per cent)
comes from the south side of a
rugged mountain range.
On the Moscow front the Nazi
drive seems to have bogged down
literally. Even the Germans admit
that Russian mud is just too much
for their super-mechanized army.
Berlin acknowledged strong
Russian countcr-atacks in this re
gion, hut claimed the Russians
were thrown back after heavy
lighting.
The Russians, on the other hand,
claimed that their counterattacks
were highly successful, that they re
captured six towns.

Britain came a report that
Bcaverbrook has decided to "take
a rest"—which, it was hinted, means
he will resign from Churchill's war
cabinet. The British Supply Min
ister advocated sending a B.E.F. to
Russia, and, it was reported, the
government turned the plan down
cold.
Agitation in London — especially
from the press and the labor groups
continues toward this same end.
British commentators said yesterday
that the majority of the government
"doubted the wisdom of placing a
sizeable B.E.F. on the Russian front
lines owing to the great transporta
tion difficulties." The inadequate
Iran railway would have to serve as
a major supply route, they said.

If this is true, the panzers may
well be poised for an easy hop, skip,
and jump to the strait of Yanikale,
only four miles from the heart of
the Caucasus.
The new advance is a dangerous
one. Loss of the Crimea would
in itself be a body blow to Rus
sia's hard-pressed southern front,
containing as it does the nation's
second largest deposits of iron ore
and the main naval base for the
lilack Seas fleet (Sevastopol).
But more to be feared than the
occupation of the Crimea itself is
the prospect of what would happen
next. Apparently the Crimea spear
head is maneuvering into a position
where it can join with the advance
from the Donets Valley in a gigantic
death-pincer around Rostov and the
Northern Caucasus.

IF THIS operation should succeed,
not only would the oil pipelines
of the Caucasus be cut off from the
Red Army, but also the ever-swell
ing stream of supplies from Britain
and America via this southern route.
This is, of course, what the Nazis
are driving at. An interesting thing
here is the co-ordination and tim
ing of the two spearheads. (Cri
mean and Donets Valley) involved
in the maneuver. The Nazis cut
oIT the peninsula several weeks
ago; then proceeded along its
northern periphery to the out
skirts of Rostov. Now that Khar
kov—and the major part of the
Donets Valley are theirs, an of
fense against the Crimea is pushed
forward and the two columns will
meet—as soon as the Russians will
allow.

How long this will be is the x
quantity in the situation. But at the
moment things don't look any too
good for the Allies. British war ex
perts expressed the fear last night
that the Russian southern armies
have lost so heavily in men and
equipment that they have not been
able to form a strong, co-ordinated
front and may not be able to hold
long.
However, it is still a little too early
to tell.

r JPHE silver lining to all this gloom
is Archibald Wavcll and the
million-man British Indian Army
he commands. These troops, at
present massed in the north of Iran,
could come to the aid of the Rus
sians in the Caucasus if Churchill
gave the word.
As it is now, the German threat
is gravest to the North Caucasus,
and fortunately, the bulk of Cau
casian oil (about 85 per cent)
comes from the south side of a
rugged mountain range.
On the Moscow front the Nazi
drive seems to have bogged down
literally. Even the Germans admit
that Russian mud is just too much
for their super-mechanized army.
Berlin acknowledged strong
Russian countcr-atacks in this re
gion, hut claimed the Russians
were thrown back after heavy
lighting.
The Russians, on the other hand,
claimed that their counterattacks
were highly successful, that they re
captured six towns.

Britain came a report that
Bcaverbrook has decided to "take
a rest"—which, it was hinted, means
he will resign from Churchill's war
cabinet. The British Supply Min
ister advocated sending a B.E.F. to
Russia, and, it was reported, the
government turned the plan down
cold.
Agitation in London — especially
from the press and the labor groups
continues toward this same end.
British commentators said yesterday
that the majority of the government
"doubted the wisdom of placing a
sizeable B.E.F. on the Russian front

containing as it does the nation's
second largest deposits of iron ore
and the main naval base for the
lilack Seas fleet (Sevastopol).
But more to be feared than the
occupation of the Crimea itself is
the prospect of what would happen
next. Apparently the Crimea spear
head is maneuvering into a position
where it can join with the advance
from the Donets Valley in a gigantic
death-pincer around Rostov and the
Northern Caucasus.

IF THIS operation should succeed,
not only would the oil pipelines
of the Caucasus be cut off from the
Red Army, but also the ever-swell
ing stream of supplies from Britain
and America via this southern route.
This is, of course, what the Nazis
are driving at. An interesting thing
here is the co-ordination and tim
ing of the two spearheads. (Cri
mean and Donets Valley) involved
in the maneuver. The Nazis cut
oIT the peninsula several weeks
ago; then proceeded along its
northern periphery to the out
skirts of Rostov. Now that Khar
kov—and the major part of the
Donets Valley are theirs, an of
fense against the Crimea is pushed
forward and the two columns will
meet—as soon as the Russians will
allow.

How long this will be is the x
quantity in the situation. But at the
moment things don't look any too
good for the Allies. British war ex
perts expressed the fear last night
that the Russian southern armies
have lost so heavily in men and
equipment that they have not been
able to form a strong, co-ordinated
front and may not be able to hold
long.
However, it is still a little too early
to tell.

r JPHE silver lining to all this gloom
is Archibald Wavcll and the
million-man British Indian Army
he commands. These troops, at
present massed in the north of Iran,
could come to the aid of the Rus
sians in the Caucasus if Churchill
gave the word.
As it is now, the German threat
is gravest to the North Caucasus,
and fortunately, the bulk of Cau
casian oil (about 85 per cent)
comes from the south side of a
rugged mountain range.
On the Moscow front the Nazi
drive seems to have bogged down
literally. Even the Germans admit
that Russian mud is just too much
for their super-mechanized army.
Berlin acknowledged strong
Russian countcr-atacks in this re
gion, hut claimed the Russians
were thrown back after heavy
lighting.
The Russians, on the other hand,
claimed that their counterattacks
were highly successful, that they re
captured six towns.

Britain came a report that
Bcaverbrook has decided to "take
a rest"—which, it was hinted, means
he will resign from Churchill's war
cabinet. The British Supply Min
ister advocated sending a B.E.F. to
Russia, and, it was reported, the
government turned the plan down
cold.
Agitation in London — especially
from the press and the labor groups
continues toward this same end.
British commentators said yesterday
that the majority of the government
"doubted the wisdom of placing a
sizeable B.E.F. on the Russian front
lines owing to the great transporta
tion difficulties." The inadequate
Iran railway would have to serve as
a major supply route, they said.
yoR ten days now the Nazis have
been putting the pressure on
the Crimean peninsula. Yesterday
they really turned the screws.
Berlin reported that "bomber
pared infantry was streaming
through the shattered Russian for
tifications" of the narrow Perekop
ithsmus which links the Crimea
with the mainland.
If this is true, the panzers may
well be poised for an easy hop, skip,
and jump to the strait of Yanikale,
only four miles from the heart of
the Caucasus.
The new advance is a dangerous
one. Loss of the Crimea would
in itself be a body blow to Rus
sia's hard-pressed southern front,
containing as it does the nation's
second largest deposits of iron ore
and the main naval base for the
lilack Seas fleet (Sevastopol).
