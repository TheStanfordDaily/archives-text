# Rallycom Says, No Bronc Rally
## 
### 
There will be no rally tonight
for the Santa Clara-Stanford foot
j ball game. This was the decision
i reached Tuesday night by the Rally
Committee.
"After the U.S.F. rally, we believe
that everyone wants a rest from ral
lies week after week," stated Pi
Thornton, co-chairman of the rally
group. "Players and students alike
were disappointed at the turnout."
These facts together with the many
midterms scheduled for Friday led
Rally Committer to its decision, even
j though everyone agreed that the
| Santa Clara game was important.
I Card stunts will be prepared for
the game Saturday, under the di
| rection of Jane Armstrong. Students
are again asked to return cards when
the stunts are over to enable the
committee to stay within its reduced
budget this year.
Jim Cahill and P. A. Palmer were
placed in charge of the U.S.C. rally
a week from today with Burt Berry
to plan the parade.
