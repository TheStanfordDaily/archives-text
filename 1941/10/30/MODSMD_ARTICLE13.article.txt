in conference at the Mayflower
Hotel before carrying their discus
sions to the White House.
Mr. Roosevelt asked Lewis and
Taylor to reopen the mines imme
diately on the understanding that
the Defense Mediation Board would
consider the miners' demands—chief
of which is insistence on the union
shop—when it meets on Friday and
continuously thereafter.
Lewis would not give a final an
swer tonight. He said one would be
forthcoming tomorrow after he
meets with his district leaders from
the regions in which Captive Mines
are located.
"Does that mean that no Captive
Mines will open tomorrow?" Lewis
was asked.
"That's right," he replied.
Tavlor said that he was in "com

plete agreement" with the Presi
dent's request.
The President's new request was
formalized in a letter to Davis, which
read:
"I have asked the United States
Steel Corp., and the United Mine
Workers of America if they will im
mediately reopen the mines on the
understanding that the National De
fense Mediation Board will proceed
in full session to consider the merits
of the dispute and make its final rec
ommendation.
"It is understood that neither

party is committed in advance It) the
acceptance of the final recommenda
tions.
"You have informed mo lhat the
full board is meeting on Friday and
will be prepared to consider the
matter continuously until it makes
its final recommendations."
Davis read the text to reporters.
The usually affable chairman was
stern and unsmiling. He offered no
elaboration. Lewis also was tight
lipped, saying only that he would
put the question up to the district
leaders.
