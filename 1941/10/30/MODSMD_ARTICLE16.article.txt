LONDON. Oct. 29 (UP). —Foreign
diplomats said tonight there might
be a direct connection between
Lord Beaverbrook's stand in favor of
sending a British expeditionary
force to Russia and reports that he
would resign from the supply min
istry and, consequently, from the
War Cabinet.
These envoys, who were in posi
tion to know, said Beaverbrook had
been more insistent than any other
Cabinet member in advocating the,
sending of a strong BEF to Russia—
presumably to the Donets Valley or
the eastern Ukraine, where the
heavy fighting is now in progress.
