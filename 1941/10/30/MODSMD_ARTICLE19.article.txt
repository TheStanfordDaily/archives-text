# Germans Blitz to Cut Off American Supplies; Russ Claim Moscow Line Holds
## 
### United Press 
The German drive to seize Russia's vital heavy in
dustries in the south and cut the route of U.S.-Britisli
aid appeared roaring to a bloody climax today (Thurs
day), with the great city of Kharkov admittedly lout,
Rostov under assault, and Nazi forces reportedly
streaming into the Crimea.

► Simultaneously the Germans
loosed the greatest artillery bom
bardment of the war on Moscow's
defenses and were massing thou
sands of tanks preparatory to a
grand assault on the Red metropo
lis.
With the admitted fall of Kharkov,
which the Germans claimed Saturn
day, went control of Russia's great
est industrial district. The city of
nearly 1,000,000 population, often
called Russia's '"Pittsburgh," is the
administrative and economic center
of Soviet metallurgical, coal mining,
chemical and heavy industries.
AT TERRIFIC LOSS'
The Moscow radio said the Ger
mans took t.he city at the terrific cost
of 120,000 men, 450 tanks, 200 big
guns and 3,000 vehicles, and entered
it only after Soviet defenders had
evacuated '"all the most important''
factories, railway rolling stock, raw
materials and stores.
Of vital portent also was the Ger
man claim to have smashed into the
i Crimean peninsula, by-passed in the
] Nazi drive eastward along the Black
Sea coast last month but under heavy
attack for the past 10 days.
i The titanic battle for Moscow
roared toward a decision despite mud
which hampered mechanized ma-

ncuvers. The Russians, not waiting
for the full force of the German at
tack, counter-attacked in force and
reportedly drove the Germans out
of six front line villages.
The 1.000 miles from the snow
and slush of the Kalinin battlefield,
100 miles northwest of Moscow, to
the warm shores of the Black Sea in
♦he Crimea were the scene of one
vast battle.
WHAT THEY SAY:
German and Russian versions of
the action follow.
1. The Nazis claimed that by
smashing into the Crimea and rout
ing Soviet defenders after 10 days of
battle they had opened a short route
to the Caucasus.
A furious, continuing assault on
Moscow's approaches was described,
with panzer forces claiming a break
through in one unnamed sector. Ad
mittedly strong Soviet counter-at
tacks before Moscow were said to
have been thrown back with costly
losses.
2. The Russians admitted that
fierce battles raged south, west and
north of Moscow —with massed Ger
man artillery raining shells on So
viet defenses—but asserted that all
German attempts lo advance were
thrown back and that Russian coun
ter-attacks had recaptured six towns
from the Nazis.
Russian communiques ignored the
lighting in the Crimea —an ominous
indication that German claims of
successes there were true.
