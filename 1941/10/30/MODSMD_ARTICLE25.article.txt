# International Club Fosters Good Will Among Foreigners
## 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Il's a far cry from peace in the Orient, but at Stanford a Chinese stu
dent and a Japanese student are rooming together and there has been
no complaint from either. They met through Stanford's International Club.
Another good example of the effect of the club is its work in bringing
together two students from France. The students, who didn't know one

another, turned out to have lived,
just a block apart in Paris. It's a
small world.
Stanford's International Club in
the last four years has become an
active organization again. There has
always been an organization for
foreign students, but until Mrs. Ed
win J. Thomas donated her resi
dence for the meeting, there was no
place where the American and for
eign students could come together
under a home atmosphere. The club
now has about 50 members and it is
stressed by the club officers that
everyone is welcome at the meet
ings.
STUDENTS MET
An international committee of
the A.S.S.U. meets the foreign stu
dents at the train at the beginning
of the quarter and helps them get
acquainted. Through the Interna
tional Club these friendships are
continued and new ones are made.
Meeting on Wednesday evenings,
the club either spends the evening
informally talking, playing games
and bridge, which seems to be the
thing everyone is really interested
in, or having a guest speaker ad
dress the meeting.
POLICY FURTHERED
Some of the outstanding speakers
last year were Pierre de Lanux,
J former French Minister, and Dr.
Rudolf Ho Isti. At the meeting last
night Guillermo Benedetti, chancel
lor to the Panamanian Consul-Gen -
eral of San Francisco, spoke of the
recent events in his country. There
have also been other very discreet
members of the diplomatic corps
residing in San Francisco who have
j addressed the club.
One of the main purposes of the
club now is to further the Good

Neighbor policy of our government.
A committee has been formed and
will work under Professor Graham
I Stuart, studying Pan-Americanism.
The club officers are Janet Snell
ing, president; Gunner Scholer, from
J Denmark, vice-president; Llewellyn
: Gould, secretary; Kay Kitagawa,
: treasurer; and Sallye Ross, program
I chairman and vice-president.
Recently the club had a roller
skating party for the new members. |
For many club members it was their
first time on skates. But it's a lot
easier taking a course in interna-
I tional relations on the floor of the
j roller-skating rink (as the American
student found out) than getting up
and going to an eight o'clock.
