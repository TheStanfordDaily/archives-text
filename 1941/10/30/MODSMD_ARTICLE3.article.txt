They have done it again. I didn't
think they would have nerve

been finished last year, hut they
have done it again. But you will
hear no cries of anguish from me.
Now I am going home. But I shall
never reach my home, for I am
going to quietly do away with
myself on a quiet, lonely place I
know on Sandhill Road.
(ioodbye. faithful friends.
Adieu!
