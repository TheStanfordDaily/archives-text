## Cards' Chances Saturday Depend on New Backfield 
### H.D. THOREAU 
If (lie new Sheller-Vucinich combination can replace I Gallarneau
and Norm Stamllee, if I.lne Coach I'll it Bengtson's scouting fathoms the
Broneo attack as well this year as it did liist season, and if the Cards
receive a little more luck than in last year's contest, Stanford should net
their thiid straight victory <111 their way to the Bowl, at the expense of
Santa Clara.

Last Saturday's game at Seattle
proved that Pete Kmetovic, Sheller,
and Vucinich form an excellent
ground offense, giving power through
the middle and through the tackles,
and speed around the ends. It was
Standlee, 220-pound fullback now
with the Chicago Bears, who did the
big damage against Santa Clara in
last year's 7-(i debacle.
Before the 1940 contest the Broncos
announced a new "X attack." How
ever, Coach Clark Shaughnessy and
his men deciphered it to the extent
that except for one long pass the
Santa Clarans made no gains all
afternoon. Bengtson just returned
irom Oklahoma, where he scouted
Santa Clara, with his head full of
ways to combat that fast-charging
line and those powerful backs.
Even Coach Buck Shaw of the
visitors said last year that Stanford
should have won by three touch
downs instead of the insignificant
one point. The Indians marched up
and down inside the 20-yard stripes,
but tied up when pay dirt was in
view.
