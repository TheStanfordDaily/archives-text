## 
###

time period brought them a 1-0 victory over a stubborn Chi Psi septet in
an intramural grid bout yesterday.

third straight win. bringing (lie winners one step nearer the crown in

League 8. Monday at 5 the Phi
ma Kappa outfit will provide the last
opposition to Breakers' hopes.
Kappa Sigma revealed beautiful
end sweeps, some equally nice flat
zone passes, general flash through
out, and got exactly nowhere with
it all.
Delta Tau Delta, on the other
hand, couldn't get the ball away
from the Kappa Sigs long enough to
do anything, and after one long
Kappa Sig drive after another, Ref
eree Leo McCaffrey called the game
because of darkness. The 0-0 tie
wlil be played off sometime next
week to determine the champion of
League 4.
ZETES END YEAR
The Zetes shaded Delta Chi 7 to 6
in an overtime mix that showed
some sweet maneuvers and double
reversing by both squads. The
Zetes clinched the verdict in the
overtime when Ace Hanlon sliced
through the Delta Chi middle for
decisive yardage.
Previously, Delta Chi had led
most of the game by virtue of War
ren Thoits' 35-yard run after a pass
interception. In the last period Han
lon engineered a Zete drive ending
with a bullet pass that tied the
game. Over both teams hung the
shadow of Business School which
had beaten both of them to turn
what should have been the eham
| pionship mix in the league into "just
| another" game.

Ericina Basement.
