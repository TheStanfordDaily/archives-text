### 
Sequoia defeated Phi Sigma Kappa
last night in a series of fast volley
hall games 15-11, 12-15, 15-14 in
Encina Gym. Sequoia played hard
and was barely able to carry the last
game because of their opponents'
fast play.
Alpha Delt II downed Theta Xi
15-12, 15-9 in games in which Bon
ner and Driscoll starred.
In freshmen competition Encina
Bull Pen nosed out Encina 2E 15-7,
12-15, 15-9, while Encina 4W won
from the Basement 15-9, 15-12.
The Business School vs. Alpha
Kappa Lambda, and Sigma Nu vs.
S.A.E. games were postponed.
No games have been scheduled for
tonight because at the time of post
ing it was thought there would be a
rally in the gym.
League standings will be posted
again after next week's play.
