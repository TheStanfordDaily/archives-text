### DON SELBY 
IF YOU think Stanford is going to
have an easy time of it with the
Broncos from Santa Clara in the
Stadium Saturday, you're about due
for another thinking session.
II you think that the Stanford
gridders are taking the Broncs
lightly merely because Buck Shaw's
boys dropped a game to Oklahoma,
repeat the process of revising your
thoughts.
The Indians really want to whip
Santa Clara, partly to erase any
ideas that they were lucky to down
: the Prune Valley lads by that 7-(»
! margin last year, but mostly be
' cause they have that Rose Bowl
fever, and just can't see letting
any outfit put the skids under
them.
You can lay your shekels on one
thing: the Broncos will be fighting
like tigers to down Stanford. And
the boys from down the road a piece
may have a lot of stuff to throw
against the Indians that they haven't
shown yet.
For instance, it's about time for
the Broncos to break out with at
least some phases of the style of
game they used so successfully last
year. To date, Buck Shaw has had
his charges running mostly from a
balanced line, the orthodox forward
wall formation of Notre Dame-style
teams. But in addition to the also
orthodox box formation in the back
field, the Broncs have employed the
single wing set-up, which features
power.
The bottleneck comes in the fact
that a great deal of the power gen
erated by a single wingbaek forma
tion is nullified by the balanced line.
Now, last year and the year before,
Shaw used the single wing but with
an unbalanced line. The result was
good from a Santa Clara point, of
view, although it may be argued
that it was the personnel rather
j than the formation that made the
I difference.
At any rate, it wouldn't surprise
j us too much if the Broncs used
that unbalanced line along with
| their other attacking formation

Saturday, *It's quite probable that
they've been wailing in the grass
for a good opportunity to knock
Stanford on the hitter's ear. But
we don't think that any new
moves the Broncs might bring in
will upset the Indians who always
epxcct anything and everything
from their opponents — and quite
often get it.
So far this season the Broncos
have been playing uninspired ball,
winning their games before last !
week in an unimpressive manner.
This lends further to the idea that
Santa Clara has been pointing for
the Stanford game. The Broncs are
due to break out of their lethargy
and the Saturday would be the log- \
ical time for them to do it.

VTi: WANNA KNOW WIIY DEPT.
We want to know why Bud .
Spencer, the former Stanford track
man who now writes sports for a }
San Francisco paper, insists that
Stanford is going to drop out of the
Pacific Coast Conference. Last nighl
Spencer came forth with another
one of his yarns,' warning all and
sundry that the whole thing was j
going to blow up soon.
Unless he's just dreaming the
whole thing up, he must have some
basis for his writings. Yet no true
basis can be found in the story.
There are always a few alums
who get hot under the collar about
things like the Atherton purge, hilt
as yet nothing has been forthcom
ing from Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur on
Stanford's dropping out of the |
conference. And. after all. he's the
man on whom the decision rests.
It certainly looks as if the thing is
just a rumor that is growing because
of the sensational results it would
bring if the conference really did go
up in smoke.
But why don't they just forget all
about it until something really
breaks.
The chances, as we see them, are
that they would mean forgetting it
for a long, long while—perhaps for
all time.
