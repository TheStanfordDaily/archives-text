# You Weren't There?

ANYBODY who sat around listening to the
radio or even doing some studying last
night between 7:30 *nd 8:30 ought to kick him
self around the Quad for missing the first Activi
ties Forum.
If this were Herb Caen's column —we're glad
it's not, though—we would completely exhaust
the supply of "beaucaens" tossing them to A1
Masters and Frank Walker, who did a marvel
ous job of explaining to students just where all
the money and tickets go; to Bones Hamilton,
Bill Smith, and Jim McKellar, for their very lucid
explanations of the functions and activities of
the Alumni Association, the Corporation Yard,
and the A.S.S.U. student organization; and to
Pat Adams —from Pat came the idea for the
forum, the driving force which carried it through
to a most successful conclusion, and the perfect
chairmanship of the meeting itself.
It was short, and to the point.
The only trouble was tnat everyone left the
meeting with at least three more questions he
would like to have asked.
We would like to see another one tonight in
Memorial Hall with every Stanford student
present.
But as such a meeting is impossible, there are
two things left to do:
1) There was a secretary there last night who
took down the whole procedure. The transcrip
tion of the pages of shorthand in her little book
should be printed in booklet form and a copy
given to every student—more than that, to ev
eryone on the Stanford campus who has any
interest in the way the University is run.
2) Make good and sure Activities Forum be
comes an annual custom.
