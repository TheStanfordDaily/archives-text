# "Rally" Committee?

W'-pHE U.S.F. rally shows that the student body
X is tired of rallies every week," is the Rally
Committee's explanation for not scheduling a
rally tonight for the Santa Clara game.
To this we answer, "Re-Re-Konko Rally Com
mittee."
Translated, this means that Rally Committee
is once again falling down on the job.
Rally Committee's purpose is to fire spirit, if
it is lacking, and to keep it alive, if it begins to
cool.
Victory has perhaps gone to Stanford's head;
the student body has lost its 1940 spirit and is
now a little blase about it all. Although not to
be justified, this is to be expected.
Rally Com, however, should not become
blase. Nor should it judge the need for the
Bronco rally on the U.S.F. fizzle that never
should have been held. Nevertheless, there
should be a rally tonight, for Saturday's is a
battle of Peninsula giants, of coaching master
minds, the outcome of which has been debated
since last year.
But no matter what the game, if Rally Com
scheduled a program of real interest, Stanford
would turn out a-la-1940. Bring Bill Leiser or
Harry Borba down from the City. Or better yet,
what Stanford man would resist the "chance"
at Will Connolly?
Look, however, at the programs held so far!
True, Rally Com has a difficult job. It's diffi
cult pleasing everybody. But often—too often—
it pleases no one; "Konko the Bronko," torch
fires at the U.C.L.A. rally, and "no rally this
week."
Yes, it's a difficult job, but it's the one they've
undertaken, and "a job worth doing, is worth
doing well."—Herman Silverman
