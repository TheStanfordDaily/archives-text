LAST spring an energetic young man named
Pugh racked his brain to find the solution to
Stanford's reputedly rotten election and caucus
system.
Tuesday night Ex Committee tossed "Pugh's
ommended to this year's Ex Committee that
"Pugh's Plan" be adopted. It involved elimi
nation of caucuses, use of a nominating assem
bly and primary elections.

Last night Ex Committee tossed "Pugh's
Plan" into the legislative waste basket.
His ideas were not junked without serious
consideration and debate. Pros and cons have
been hashed over by Ex Committee as a whole
and by an investigating committee.
The only concrete decision that could be
reached was that our election system is bad
but that it is the best we can do.

Despite the disinterest of the student body in
not spending about five minutes of serious
concentration to understand the preferential
system, it was decided that the primary system
would not remedy the existing evils.
And the operations of the caucuses, long the
subject of angered arguments, both this way
and that, were agreed to be out of the realm
of Ex Com ruling since they are already not a
part of the A.S.S.U. constitutional set-up. Being
unofficial, they are immune from any official

action. They can't even be threatened.
The most that can be done is "recommenda
tion" on the part of Ex Committee.
Whether much can be accomplished is du
bious.
And so, another sleeping dog is left lying.
