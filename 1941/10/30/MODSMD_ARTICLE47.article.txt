TAKE CARE, TAKE CARE

THINK that it was in my Political Science class last
spring that 1 learned that most of labor's gains and
advancements are made duirng times of peace and
advancements are made during times of peace and
sion, the laboring man's cause seems to be forgotten.
I think that it Mr. John L. Lewis had been in my
political science class last spring, he would use a little
more care and discretion in the work that he is doing at
the present time.

For at the present time we are in a period of
stress, a period of confusion. This country is hurriedly
building up its national defenses. Everyone is work
ing, driving, striving at a fast pace to insure the safety
of this country. The general public is interested in
results. They arc interested in the number of planes
constructed, in the number of battleships launched, in
the number of guns, tanks, and bombs produced. This
country wants to be sure that it will be ready for any
kind of emergency that may arise.

And since this country is in such stress and hur
ried activity, people are intolerant of anything that
slows up this production. They no longer care if the
cause is just or unjust. All they are interested in is
seeing production continue unhampered, because of
the great danger facing the country.

B T Mr. Lewis doesn't see things this way, or if
he does, he doesn't care. F"or Mr. Lewis is so tied
up in his unions, he loses sight of the larger problem.
Instead of trying to co-operate and trying to have
labor fit into the national program, he has asked 53,000
coal miners to quit their jobs, and has almost upset
the whole program of production. And the cause of
the strike is a demand for closed shops. It may be that
under normal circumstances there would be a just
cause for calling such a strike, for everyone knows
that a union loses its effectiveness if there is an
open shop. But right at the present time, there are
more important things going on. This is not the time
for labor to be striving for such gains.

The problem of closed shops is not so pressing as
to justify the tying up of one of the most vital of all
defense industries. For the matter of closed shops is
a means of achieving for labor the ends of fair wages
and hours and general betterment of conditions. But
at the present time, these workers are receiving fair
wages and their general working conditions are all
right. They are not striking for these things, but for
the means of achieving these ends, which at the present
time they have. In other words, the strike is concern
ing a long-range matter, and at the present time,
there isn't time for such things.

|>UT Mr. Lewis is insistent, and the workers have
struck, and in so doing have turned public senti
ment against all of labor and against all the ideas for
which unions stand. Even the President has come out
with a denunciation of the strike, and there is good
chance that legislation will be passed that will nullify
many of labor's hard-earned gains.

This is the result of labor's honest efforts, and the
results are just, because this is not the time for such
improvements. We have another larger, much more
important matter to settle first. When this more press
ing matter is settled, when we return to a more normal
period, then it will be the time for labor to make
these just advancements. But if Mr. Lewis and other
labor leaders try to do the work now, they have a
good chance of throwing back the cause of labor many
valuable years.
