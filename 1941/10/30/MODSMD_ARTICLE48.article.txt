ALL ABOARD, WILLARD

EDITOR, SIR:
People have been asking me lately, "Is it true, as
Willard Mitchell says, that you are obscure?" There
isn't much that I can answer, because Willard may
have implied a pun.
But the bad thing is that my friends watch me
carefully for an engine-like burst of steam when J
walk. And it is all Willard's fault; he said that I let
off a lot of steam —the Daylight and I.
Well, Willard, the Daylight and I are going to move
over, orange paint and all, and we shall rise off the
rails to bow as you join us. Willard encouraged this
courtesy when he went into a long philosophical dis
course on freedom, because when the mist of words
had risen, lo! we discovered that the proper definition
of "freedom" makes it turn out that Germany, Italy,
and Japan are all fighting for freedom.
Now instead of ploughing around in Mr. Mitchell's
devious pathways to truth, suppose we examine the
amazing conclusion that Hitler is a liberator. This
sounds strangely like a confidential tip from Joe
Goebbels and should be worth looking into.
Was Hitler fighting for freedom when he clamped
an iron hand over the mouths of those Germans who
disagreed with him? Was Hitler fighting for freedom
when he murdered—pardon me, Willard, I meant "exe
cuted"—those who managed to breathe a few words
through the iron clamp?
Did Hitler strike significant blows toward the lib
eration of the human race when he conquered, regi
mented, and inflicted physical and political misery
upon practically every nation of Europe? Does Adolph
sound like a Great Emancipator when he vows to make
Germany the master race of the world?
If the answer to those questions is "yes," then why
don't we all hire storm troopers to beat us with
clubs so that we can all be free? How fatuous and
asinine Willard Mitchell's manipulations of the word
"freedom" would sound to the thousands of French
men, Dutchmen, and Czechs in Hitler's concentration
camps! And how absurd they should sound to Ameri
cans whom Hitler's mouthpieces have recently threat
ened with a similar fate!

And so you see, Willard, the definition of "free
dom" need not be sought in academic meanderings in
theory. It is written in the blood of our fellow human
beings.
We grant that American and British politics are not
pure white crystals made in God's own workshop un
der the personal supervision of St. Peter. But on this
side of the Pearly Gates there can be no reasonable
doubt in our minds which way promises more free
dom—the way of Hitler's world or the way of our
own.

Yes, we are fighting for our own security. Yes, we
are trying to consolidate the Americas because we are
trying to fight Hitler. But our security and hemispheric
solidarity are not built with the tools that Fascism
uses. It is not built with concentration camps and
persecution. It is not built without regard for per
sonal liberties. And it is not built without room for
the hope thi-t the blackness of sacrificed liberties will
someday be lifted from an oppressed world.

If you want to know what "freedom" means, ask
yourself one question: Which would you rather be, a
German in Germany, or an Englishman in England?

ALL ABOARD, WILLARD

EDITOR, SIR:
People have been asking me lately, "Is it true, as
Willard Mitchell says, that you are obscure?" There
isn't much that I can answer, because Willard may
have implied a pun.
But the bad thing is that my friends watch me
carefully for an engine-like burst of steam when J
walk. And it is all Willard's fault; he said that I let
off a lot of steam —the Daylight and I.
Well, Willard, the Daylight and I are going to move
over, orange paint and all, and we shall rise off the
rails to bow as you join us. Willard encouraged this
courtesy when he went into a long philosophical dis
course on freedom, because when the mist of words
had risen, lo! we discovered that the proper definition
of "freedom" makes it turn out that Germany, Italy,
and Japan are all fighting for freedom.
Now instead of ploughing around in Mr. Mitchell's
devious pathways to truth, suppose we examine the
amazing conclusion that Hitler is a liberator. This
sounds strangely like a confidential tip from Joe
Goebbels and should be worth looking into.
Was Hitler fighting for freedom when he clamped
an iron hand over the mouths of those Germans who
disagreed with him? Was Hitler fighting for freedom
when he murdered—pardon me, Willard, I meant "exe
cuted"—those who managed to breathe a few words
through the iron clamp?
Did Hitler strike significant blows toward the lib
eration of the human race when he conquered, regi
mented, and inflicted physical and political misery
upon practically every nation of Europe? Does Adolph
sound like a Great Emancipator when he vows to make
Germany the master race of the world?
If the answer to those questions is "yes," then why
don't we all hire storm troopers to beat us with
clubs so that we can all be free? How fatuous and
asinine Willard Mitchell's manipulations of the word
"freedom" would sound to the thousands of French
men, Dutchmen, and Czechs in Hitler's concentration
camps! And how absurd they should sound to Ameri
cans whom Hitler's mouthpieces have recently threat
ened with a similar fate!

And so you see, Willard, the definition of "free
dom" need not be sought in academic meanderings in
theory. It is written in the blood of our fellow human
beings.
We grant that American and British politics are not
pure white crystals made in God's own workshop un
der the personal supervision of St. Peter. But on this
side of the Pearly Gates there can be no reasonable
doubt in our minds which way promises more free
dom—the way of Hitler's world or the way of our
own.

Yes, we are fighting for our own security. Yes, we
are trying to consolidate the Americas because we are
trying to fight Hitler. But our security and hemispheric
solidarity are not built with the tools that Fascism
uses. It is not built with concentration camps and
persecution. It is not built without regard for per
sonal liberties. And it is not built without room for
the hope thi-t the blackness of sacrificed liberties will
someday be lifted from an oppressed world.

If you want to know what "freedom" means, ask
yourself one question: Which would you rather be, a
German in Germany, or an Englishman in England?
