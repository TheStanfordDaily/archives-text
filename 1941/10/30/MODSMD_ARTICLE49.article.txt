# Melchior Is Tops In S.F. 'Tannhauser'
## 
### 
That there has been too little Wag
ner here this year was apparent in
the success achieved by last Friday
night's performance of "Tannhau
ser" at the San Francisco Opera
House. Perhaps one of the com
poser's later works would have been
more representative of his genius for
his sole presentation of the season,
but without the presence of Flag
stad probably only "Die Meister
singer" could have been more suc
cessful.

In the leading role, Lauritz Mel
chior proved again that he is the
foremost Wagnerian tenor in the
world today. While his acting
seemed to be impeded at times by
his bulk, his impassioned singing,
particularly in the first act, in praise
of Venus, was the high point of the
evening, emotionally speaking.

Stella Roman, as Elizabeth, showed
considerable traces of beautiful lyric
quality in her voice, but to such an
extent that her prayer in the last
act might have been mistaken for an
aria from an Italian opera. A little
more power in her greeting to the
Hall of Song in the second act would
have been gratifying, too.

Julius Huehn, portraying Tann
hauser's friend, Wolfram, with aver
age skill, reached his peak of the
evening with his rather unique ren
dition of the "Evening Star." Out
standing on the stage in his small
role of Landgrave was Alexander
Kipnis, whose richness of vocal qual
ity and superb artistic ability never
failed to thrill the audience.
