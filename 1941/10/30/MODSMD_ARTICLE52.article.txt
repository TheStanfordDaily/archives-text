AUSTIN. Tex., Oct. 29.—Fifty-one per cent of American college stu
dents, unlike most U.S. adults, are opposed to changing the neutrality law
to allow supply ships to be armed and sent into war zones.
This isolationist attitude is discovered in the first poll of (lie school
year completed last week by Student Opinion Surveys of America. The

nation-wide canvassing likewise re-<
veals overwhelming sentiment
against actual fighting in the war
and growing pessimism on the cam
pus about the country's ability to
avoid conflict.
The latest Gallup poll, taken since
Congress took up neutrality revi
sion, found a ratio of 46% to 40%
in favor of mounting guns on Amer
ican ships and 54% approving of
American ships and crews deliver
ing supplies to Britain. But college
interviewers, sampling a scientific
cross section in every part of the
nation found a different answer
among students.
The question: "Are you for or
against changing the neutrality law
so that American Supply ships may
be armed and sent into war zones?"
brought the following results:
In favor 42%
Against 51%
Undecided 7%
SECTIONAL VOTES
Following are sectional percent
ages of those favoring the law
change. New England 52, Middle

"What do you believe is more im
portant for the United Suites to try
to do," the interviewees wei'e next
asked, "declare war and use our
fighting forces where needed, or try
to keep out as long as possible and
supply nations fighting Hitler and
Japan?"
Results were:
Declare war and light 14%
Stay out and supply 79%
Undecided 7%

AUSTIN. Tex., Oct. 29.—Fifty-one per cent of American college stu
dents, unlike most U.S. adults, are opposed to changing the neutrality law
to allow supply ships to be armed and sent into war zones.
This isolationist attitude is discovered in the first poll of (lie school
year completed last week by Student Opinion Surveys of America. The

nation-wide canvassing likewise re-<
veals overwhelming sentiment
against actual fighting in the war
and growing pessimism on the cam
pus about the country's ability to
avoid conflict.
The latest Gallup poll, taken since
Congress took up neutrality revi
sion, found a ratio of 46% to 40%
in favor of mounting guns on Amer
ican ships and 54% approving of
American ships and crews deliver
ing supplies to Britain. But college
interviewers, sampling a scientific
cross section in every part of the
nation found a different answer
among students.
The question: "Are you for or
against changing the neutrality law
so that American Supply ships may
be armed and sent into war zones?"
brought the following results:
In favor 42%
Against 51%
Undecided 7%
