## 
### 
Gene Tunncy (old a scanty crowd of 000 yesterday morning in the
Pavilion that "individual litness is 110 different from national fitness. We ;
must he prepared."
The former heavyweight champion's discourse ranged from a history <
of sports in the good old days of Tutankhamen and Agamemnon, the an- ;

cient Egyptians and Greek sports- â™¦
-men, to the fighting Meet of the
United States Navy.
The greater part of Tunney's
speech, however, was devoted to
physical fitness.
Great disappointment to the crowd
was the failure of Clark Shaugh
nessy to put in an appearance. "He
had to go to Oakland 1o meet hi.s
mother," Bud Hebert, student chair
man at the assembly, explained af
terwards.
MESSINA LEADS YELLS
The informal rally was opened
with several yells led by Joe Mes
sina. Messina then introduced
Harry Maloney, director of minor j
sports at Stanford and an intimate j
friend of Tunney's.
Maloney gave a brief sketch of
Tunney's career and then intro
duced the former champion, who is
now a Lieut. Commander in the
U.S. Navy.
"Minor sports like boxing and
fencing were in existence long be
fore football, and will continue long
after the gridiron sport has disap
peared," he prophesied. Frankie Al
bert and Pete Kmetovic, sitting in
the stands, smiled at this statement.
EMPHASIZES EXERCISE
"It is not games you learn like
tennis and squash that will keep
you physically fit," Tunney contin
ued, "but. things you do every day.
Every person should do some kind
of exercise every d;iy for 15 min- j
utes," he recommended. "Those 15 i
minutes will keep you in shape for '
the rest of your life.
"Ours is the greatest Navy that j
has ever existed," Lieut. Commander
Tunney stated, moving on to another
subject. "But we must have man
power for our new ships."
Tunney concluded on an ominous
note with, "When you start looking
for a military job, which you all
soon will be doing, don't overlook
the Navy. I personally believe this
will be a long drawn-out emer
gency."
