# McKellar Acumen Saves Students 10%
## 
### 
An astute Student Manager, Jim
McKcllar by name, has just saved
Stanford students about $250.
"How?" you ask.
Well, he bought $2,50(1 worth of
scrip from the Southern Pacific
Company. And now when you
drop around to the A.S.S.U. office
to buy your train ticket for the
Stanford Special for the U.S.C.
game you won't have to pay that
new 10 per cent government tax.
on train tickets.
That is, if you get there before
the first $2,500 worth of tickets is
gone. And at $10 per round trip
(Pullman is extra) they won't last
long, says McKcllar.
