# History ... 1941

### AMIE REICHERT 
r cult of isolationism is deep
rooted, time-hallowed, tinged
with martyrdom. Its protagonists
have never been popular during war
time and many have enjoyed a
doubtful kind of martyrdom; others
have made consistency the cardinal
virtue of their faith; many have
been wholly sincere, motivated by
national interest and national safety.
It is hard to tell where to draw
the line. Perhaps that is a job for
the psychiatrist, for certainly psy
chological factors are involved in
the case of Lindbergh who, admit
tedly, is haunted by the "martyr
dom" and—he believes—later vin
dication of his father, Charles
Augustus Lindberg Sr.
Lindbergh Sr. was elected to Con
gress in 190 G. He was convinced that
(he entire American economics sys
tem was a conspiracy against the
Midwest farmer, and when war was
declared in 1917, he regarded it as
another nefarious Wall Street
scheme. He wrote bitter speeches
condemning the "exploiters" and
"Wall Street speculators" who di
rected "the inner circle" which was
plunging America into a foreign
war.

|F COURSE there is absolutely no
similarity between the argu
ments of Lindbergh the elder and
Lindbergh the younger. But histor
ically their positions may be anal
ogous.
And Charles Augustus Jr. is
fully aware of this. He remem
bers how his father was mobbed
and stoned in 1918 when be was
making an unsuccessful campaign
for Governor of Minnesota. But he
is firmly convinced that his
father has been vindicated since
his death in 1924, and he believes
that be will be too.
"In 10 or 15 years," he has said,
"people will understand what I am
doing now."
There may be some hereditary
basis for isolationism. Whatever the
reason, it is interesting to note that
another son of a famous isolationist
leader has caught up the torch and
is carrying it on today.

r rWENTY-FOUR years ago a se
rious young man sat in the gal
lery of the Senate and watched his
father, Robert M. LaFollette Sr., lead
the opposition in a successful fight
against Woodrow Wilson's proposal
to arm merchant ships.
Several days ago, Robert LaFol
lette Jr. condemned Franklin D.
Roosevelt's proposal to arm mer
chant ships as an invitation to war.
In 1917 a filibuster defeated tbe
bill, and a month after Wilson
steamrollered the measure without
Congressional approval, the U. S.
was in a shooting war.
Today the same decision faces the
Senate. And once again the Ad
ministration has its "little group of
willful men," among them LaFol
lette. Wheeler, Nye, Johnson, D.
Worth Clark, Bennett Clark, Van
denburgh, and Taft.
Only one of the original "willful
men" still in Congress is George W.
Norris, who supports the Adminis
tration in the present debate.

p*OR four days now Neutrality re
vision has been under Senatorial
fire. With each day Administration
supporters seem to be growing a
little stronger.
Half the proposed revision—that
concerning the arming of merchant
ships — seems inevitable. Even the
opposition has conceded defeat here.
But the vote on the repeal of the
combat zone and belligerent port re
strictions will be close.
This is the most important bit
of war legislation to come before
Congress thus far hut the apathy
in the Senate was appalling. Those
who object to tbe President's act
ing without consulting Congress
should note the fact that at one
point in yesterday's proceedings
there were only two Senators
present to hear a colleague. Dull,
isn't it?
