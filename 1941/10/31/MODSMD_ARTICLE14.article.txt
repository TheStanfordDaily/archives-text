# Carillon Success Cancels Deficit
## 
### 
Nearly sold out in a single morn
ing, Carillon made its first, appear
ance' of the quarter Wednesday.
"Our profits," said Editor Cab Bur-
Icy, "should be sufficient to clean
up the deficit, of our first issue."
Original financing was provided by
the A.S.S.U.
Anyone who bought his Caril
lons in the prepublication sale and
who has not yet taken delivery can
gel them at the Carillon office in the
Art Studio building, behind the
Quad office.
Next issue of the Farm's general -
interest magazine will appear at the
end of November. Material may be
turned in at the office any after
noon.
