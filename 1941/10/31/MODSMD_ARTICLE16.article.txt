# VENGEFUL BRONCOS INVADE FARM
## Mythical Coast Title at Stake Bad knee May Keep 'Bandooch' Out; Meyer Back in Shape for Contest 
### H.D. THOREAU 
If th«re were such a thing, the football championsliip <»f the Far Western
region of (he United States would be at stake tomorrow afternoon in tho
stadium when Stanford contacts Santa Clam's Broncs on the striped green
turf.
Present leader in the P.C.C. race, the Indians will enter the game as

slight favorites, due principally to
their impressive win over Washing
ton last week and the Santa damns'
loss to Oklahoma at the same time.
Despite the Broncos' defeat they are
by far the outstanding independent
team on this side of the Rockies.
Three changes will appear in the
Cards' starting lineup, according to
Head Coach Clark Daniel Shaugh
nessy's announcement. Erie "Hoot"
Armstrong will be back in his start
ing right halfback position in place
of sophomore Willard Sheller who
usurped his spot for the Husky game.
Bruno Banducci is out with a
wrenched knee, leaving Ed McCain
as the opening right tackle. Game
Captain Doug Stable will replace
Vic Lindskog at center.
BANDUCCI MISSING
For Banducci and Lindskog it. will
Ik? the first kickofT they have missed
since they started playing varsity
ball for the Farm. Fred Meyer, who
was out of practice several days
this week with a cold, will be back
at the right end position at which
he won All-Coast honors last year.
Chuck Taylor, Ed Stamm, and Ar
nie Meiners will fill the left side of
the Card line.
So far this season the visitors have
not shown anything resembling a
sure-fire offense, but many observ
ers feel that Coach Buck Shaw, who
has few peers as a coach, has be on
holding something in reserve for the
Indians, who handed his boys their
only defeat last year.

Students and other campus resi
dents are urged to leave their cars
home tomorrow when they go to
the Santa Clara game, which starts
at 2 p.m. (Jaivez Street will bo
closed to all stadium-bound traflic
shortly after noon, and campus
cars will be parked on the frosh
baseball field and soccer field.

However, in all their games this
year the Broncs' fast charging line
lias kept the opposition's scrimmage
gains to a minimum. They seem to
have a weakness in the pass defense
department which will coma in
hancly for the Indians as long a.'j
Frankie Albert, a left-over A.ll
- keeps his health.
LONG PASS SCORED
Last season's Card - Bronc epic
which ended with Stanford on the
least-short end of the score, 7-6,
was a struggle pitting the pile-driv
ing of Norm Standlee, who scored the
Indians' lone touchdown, against Ken
Casenaga, who, after being rated
behind teammate Jimmy Johnson,
went on to lead the Broncs and give
them their only points through one
long pass down the middle.
Standlee has graduated, and so has
Hugh Gallerneau, who helped the
Big Chief mow down the visiting
line.
In their places are Vueinich, who
i is developing into a plunger of no
little ability; Shetler, another big,
fast man, and Armstrong, a seat
back with plenty of ability. Returned
is Pete Kmetovic, who will be guard
ed like the crown jewels. Kmet,
hailing from the Broncs' back yard,
I has a reputation for tearing off large
pieces of yardage which the oppo
j sition realizes full well.
Although Casenega has not broken
I out and shown his ability this year
! like he did last, he is still the Broncs'
chief threat and a constant danger
j both as a passer and a runner. He
may open the game on the bench in
order to get a better look at the
set-up with Jess Freitas taking his
place.
A wide open passing duel is not
out of the range of supposition, since
neither team boasts a better than
average pass defense and Albert and
Casenega can throw the ball where
they want to most of the time.
Although John Thom, who re
ceived Casenega's pass last year to
defeat the Cards, is not returning,
I the Broncs have in Alyn Beals an
! end who is even better, so they do
not lack a receiver. In Meyer, Hank
Norberg, and Kmetovic, Albert has
three men who can catch 'em any-
I where.
CENTER DOES PUNTING
Much punting by Albert featured
this week's Farm drills, indicating
J that Shaughnessy may expect a
kicking duel to materialize. Since
he has had little long distance punt
ing to do this year, Albert's average
in this respect does not measure up
■ to the 45-plus yards he accumulated
last year. A] Santucci pulls out of
his center spot to do the punting for
{ Santa Clara.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy after
I last season's game said that Dick
j Palmer, from right guard, had called
the best game of defensive signals
he had ever seen. Palmer is not
around this year, but Loren La-
Prade, sophomore replacement for
! him, has improved to the point
| where he now calls a mean game
himself.
BLOCKING QUESTIONABLE
Rupe Thornton, Bronc left guard,
j does the defensive analyzing for his
j team. His work last year was very
J instrumental in keeping the score
so low. Thornton, however, is like
Casenaga in that he had been touted
to make All-American honors this
season, but, so far, has not shown it.
Question marks for the invaders
are the blocking which they do or
do not get, and the quarterbaeking
which former center Eddie Forrest
! can produce. With Joe Viselli, Tom
Matula, and Nubby Wright back in
good health, and with the above
questions answered favorably for
them, Santa Clara should present a
problem which only a team on the
top of their game can solve.
If th«re were such a thing, the football championsliip <»f the Far Western
region of (he United States would be at stake tomorrow afternoon in tho
stadium when Stanford contacts Santa Clam's Broncs on the striped green

LONG PASS SCORED
Last season's Card - Bronc epic
which ended with Stanford on the
least-short end of the score, 7-6,
was a struggle pitting the pile-driv
ing of Norm Standlee, who scored the
Indians' lone touchdown, against Ken
Casenaga, who, after being rated
behind teammate Jimmy Johnson,
went on to lead the Broncs and give
them their only points through one
long pass down the middle.
Standlee has graduated, and so has
Hugh Gallerneau, who helped the
Big Chief mow down the visiting
line.
In their places are Vueinich, who
i is developing into a plunger of no
little ability; Shetler, another big,
fast man, and Armstrong, a seat
back with plenty of ability. Returned
is Pete Kmetovic, who will be guard
ed like the crown jewels. Kmet,
hailing from the Broncs' back yard,
I has a reputation for tearing off large
pieces of yardage which the oppo
j sition realizes full well.
Although Casenega has not broken
I out and shown his ability this year
! like he did last, he is still the Broncs'
chief threat and a constant danger
j both as a passer and a runner. He
may open the game on the bench in
order to get a better look at the
set-up with Jess Freitas taking his
place.
A wide open passing duel is not
out of the range of supposition, since
neither team boasts a better than
average pass defense and Albert and
Casenega can throw the ball where
they want to most of the time.
Although John Thom, who re
ceived Casenega's pass last year to
defeat the Cards, is not returning,
I the Broncs have in Alyn Beals an
! end who is even better, so they do
not lack a receiver. In Meyer, Hank
Norberg, and Kmetovic, Albert has
three men who can catch 'em any-
I where.
CENTER DOES PUNTING
Much punting by Albert featured
this week's Farm drills, indicating
J that Shaughnessy may expect a
kicking duel to materialize. Since
he has had little long distance punt
ing to do this year, Albert's average
in this respect does not measure up
■ to the 45-plus yards he accumulated
last year. A] Santucci pulls out of
his center spot to do the punting for
{ Santa Clara.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy after
I last season's game said that Dick
j Palmer, from right guard, had called
the best game of defensive signals
he had ever seen. Palmer is not
around this year, but Loren La-
Prade, sophomore replacement for
! him, has improved to the point
| where he now calls a mean game
himself.
BLOCKING QUESTIONABLE
Rupe Thornton, Bronc left guard,
j does the defensive analyzing for his
j team. His work last year was very
J instrumental in keeping the score
so low. Thornton, however, is like
Casenaga in that he had been touted
to make All-American honors this
season, but, so far, has not shown it.
Question marks for the invaders
are the blocking which they do or
do not get, and the quarterbaeking
which former center Eddie Forrest
! can produce. With Joe Viselli, Tom
Matula, and Nubby Wright back in
good health, and with the above
questions answered favorably for
them, Santa Clara should present a
problem which only a team on the
top of their game can solve.
If th«re were such a thing, the football championsliip <»f the Far Western
region of (he United States would be at stake tomorrow afternoon in tho
stadium when Stanford contacts Santa Clam's Broncs on the striped green
turf.
Present leader in the P.C.C. race, the Indians will enter the game as

slight favorites, due principally to
their impressive win over Washing
ton last week and the Santa damns'
loss to Oklahoma at the same time.
Despite the Broncos' defeat they are
by far the outstanding independent
team on this side of the Rockies.
Three changes will appear in the
Cards' starting lineup, according to
Head Coach Clark Daniel Shaugh
nessy's announcement. Erie "Hoot"
Armstrong will be back in his start
ing right halfback position in place
of sophomore Willard Sheller who
usurped his spot for the Husky game.
Bruno Banducci is out with a
wrenched knee, leaving Ed McCain
as the opening right tackle. Game
Captain Doug Stable will replace
Vic Lindskog at center.
BANDUCCI MISSING
For Banducci and Lindskog it. will
Ik? the first kickofT they have missed
since they started playing varsity
ball for the Farm. Fred Meyer, who
was out of practice several days
this week with a cold, will be back
at the right end position at which
he won All-Coast honors last year.
Chuck Taylor, Ed Stamm, and Ar
nie Meiners will fill the left side of
the Card line.
So far this season the visitors have
not shown anything resembling a
sure-fire offense, but many observ
ers feel that Coach Buck Shaw, who
has few peers as a coach, has be on
holding something in reserve for the
Indians, who handed his boys their
only defeat last year.

Students and other campus resi
dents are urged to leave their cars
home tomorrow when they go to
the Santa Clara game, which starts
at 2 p.m. (Jaivez Street will bo
closed to all stadium-bound traflic
shortly after noon, and campus
cars will be parked on the frosh
baseball field and soccer field.

However, in all their games this

{ Santa Clara.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy after
I last season's game said that Dick
j Palmer, from right guard, had called
the best game of defensive signals
he had ever seen. Palmer is not
around this year, but Loren La-
Prade, sophomore replacement for
! him, has improved to the point
| where he now calls a mean game
himself.
BLOCKING QUESTIONABLE
Rupe Thornton, Bronc left guard,
j does the defensive analyzing for his
j team. His work last year was very
J instrumental in keeping the score
so low. Thornton, however, is like
Casenaga in that he had been touted
to make All-American honors this
season, but, so far, has not shown it.
Question marks for the invaders
are the blocking which they do or
do not get, and the quarterbaeking
which former center Eddie Forrest
! can produce. With Joe Viselli, Tom
Matula, and Nubby Wright back in
good health, and with the above
questions answered favorably for
them, Santa Clara should present a
problem which only a team on the
top of their game can solve.
If th«re were such a thing, the football championsliip <»f the Far Western
region of (he United States would be at stake tomorrow afternoon in tho
stadium when Stanford contacts Santa Clam's Broncs on the striped green
turf.
Present leader in the P.C.C. race, the Indians will enter the game as

slight favorites, due principally to
their impressive win over Washing
ton last week and the Santa damns'
loss to Oklahoma at the same time.
Despite the Broncos' defeat they are
by far the outstanding independent
team on this side of the Rockies.
Three changes will appear in the
Cards' starting lineup, according to
Head Coach Clark Daniel Shaugh
nessy's announcement. Erie "Hoot"
Armstrong will be back in his start
ing right halfback position in place
of sophomore Willard Sheller who
usurped his spot for the Husky game.
Bruno Banducci is out with a
wrenched knee, leaving Ed McCain
as the opening right tackle. Game
Captain Doug Stable will replace
Vic Lindskog at center.
BANDUCCI MISSING
For Banducci and Lindskog it. will
Ik? the first kickofT they have missed
since they started playing varsity
ball for the Farm. Fred Meyer, who
was out of practice several days
this week with a cold, will be back
at the right end position at which
he won All-Coast honors last year.
Chuck Taylor, Ed Stamm, and Ar
nie Meiners will fill the left side of
the Card line.
So far this season the visitors have
not shown anything resembling a
sure-fire offense, but many observ
ers feel that Coach Buck Shaw, who
has few peers as a coach, has be on
holding something in reserve for the
Indians, who handed his boys their
only defeat last year.

Students and other campus resi
dents are urged to leave their cars
home tomorrow when they go to
the Santa Clara game, which starts
at 2 p.m. (Jaivez Street will bo
closed to all stadium-bound traflic
shortly after noon, and campus
cars will be parked on the frosh
baseball field and soccer field.

However, in all their games this
year the Broncs' fast charging line
lias kept the opposition's scrimmage
gains to a minimum. They seem to
have a weakness in the pass defense
department which will coma in
hancly for the Indians as long a.'j
Frankie Albert, a left-over A.ll
- keeps his health.
LONG PASS SCORED
Last season's Card - Bronc epic
which ended with Stanford on the
least-short end of the score, 7-6,
was a struggle pitting the pile-driv
ing of Norm Standlee, who scored the
Indians' lone touchdown, against Ken
Casenaga, who, after being rated
behind teammate Jimmy Johnson,
went on to lead the Broncs and give
them their only points through one
long pass down the middle.
Standlee has graduated, and so has
Hugh Gallerneau, who helped the
Big Chief mow down the visiting
line.
In their places are Vueinich, who
i is developing into a plunger of no
little ability; Shetler, another big,
fast man, and Armstrong, a seat
back with plenty of ability. Returned
is Pete Kmetovic, who will be guard
ed like the crown jewels. Kmet,
hailing from the Broncs' back yard,
I has a reputation for tearing off large
pieces of yardage which the oppo
j sition realizes full well.
Although Casenega has not broken
I out and shown his ability this year
! like he did last, he is still the Broncs'
chief threat and a constant danger
j both as a passer and a runner. He
may open the game on the bench in
order to get a better look at the
set-up with Jess Freitas taking his
place.
A wide open passing duel is not
out of the range of supposition, since
neither team boasts a better than
average pass defense and Albert and
Casenega can throw the ball where
they want to most of the time.
Although John Thom, who re
ceived Casenega's pass last year to
defeat the Cards, is not returning,
I the Broncs have in Alyn Beals an
! end who is even better, so they do
not lack a receiver. In Meyer, Hank
Norberg, and Kmetovic, Albert has
three men who can catch 'em any-
I where.
CENTER DOES PUNTING
Much punting by Albert featured
this week's Farm drills, indicating
J that Shaughnessy may expect a

he has had little long distance punt
ing to do this year, Albert's average
in this respect does not measure up
■ to the 45-plus yards he accumulated
last year. A] Santucci pulls out of
his center spot to do the punting for
{ Santa Clara.

he won All-Coast honors last year.
Chuck Taylor, Ed Stamm, and Ar
nie Meiners will fill the left side of
the Card line.
So far this season the visitors have
not shown anything resembling a
sure-fire offense, but many observ
ers feel that Coach Buck Shaw, who
has few peers as a coach, has be on
holding something in reserve for the
Indians, who handed his boys their
only defeat last year.

Students and other campus resi
dents are urged to leave their cars
home tomorrow when they go to
the Santa Clara game, which starts
at 2 p.m. (Jaivez Street will bo
closed to all stadium-bound traflic
shortly after noon, and campus
cars will be parked on the frosh
baseball field and soccer field.

However, in all their games this
year the Broncs' fast charging line
lias kept the opposition's scrimmage
gains to a minimum. They seem to
have a weakness in the pass defense
department which will coma in
hancly for the Indians as long a.'j

LONG PASS SCORED
Last season's Card - Bronc epic
which ended with Stanford on the
least-short end of the score, 7-6,
was a struggle pitting the pile-driv
ing of Norm Standlee, who scored the
Indians' lone touchdown, against Ken
Casenaga, who, after being rated
behind teammate Jimmy Johnson,
went on to lead the Broncs and give
them their only points through one
long pass down the middle.
Standlee has graduated, and so has
Hugh Gallerneau, who helped the
Big Chief mow down the visiting
line.
In their places are Vueinich, who
i is developing into a plunger of no
little ability; Shetler, another big,
fast man, and Armstrong, a seat
back with plenty of ability. Returned
is Pete Kmetovic, who will be guard
ed like the crown jewels. Kmet,
hailing from the Broncs' back yard,
I has a reputation for tearing off large
pieces of yardage which the oppo
j sition realizes full well.
Although Casenega has not broken
I out and shown his ability this year
! like he did last, he is still the Broncs'
chief threat and a constant danger
j both as a passer and a runner. He
may open the game on the bench in
order to get a better look at the
set-up with Jess Freitas taking his
place.
A wide open passing duel is not
out of the range of supposition, since
neither team boasts a better than
average pass defense and Albert and
Casenega can throw the ball where
they want to most of the time.
Although John Thom, who re
ceived Casenega's pass last year to
defeat the Cards, is not returning,
I the Broncs have in Alyn Beals an
! end who is even better, so they do
not lack a receiver. In Meyer, Hank
Norberg, and Kmetovic, Albert has
three men who can catch 'em any-
I where.
CENTER DOES PUNTING
Much punting by Albert featured
this week's Farm drills, indicating
J that Shaughnessy may expect a
kicking duel to materialize. Since
he has had little long distance punt
ing to do this year, Albert's average
in this respect does not measure up
■ to the 45-plus yards he accumulated
last year. A] Santucci pulls out of
his center spot to do the punting for
{ Santa Clara.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy after
I last season's game said that Dick
j Palmer, from right guard, had called
the best game of defensive signals
he had ever seen. Palmer is not
around this year, but Loren La-
Prade, sophomore replacement for
! him, has improved to the point
| where he now calls a mean game
himself.
BLOCKING QUESTIONABLE
Rupe Thornton, Bronc left guard,
j does the defensive analyzing for his
j team. His work last year was very
J instrumental in keeping the score
so low. Thornton, however, is like
Casenaga in that he had been touted
to make All-American honors this
season, but, so far, has not shown it.
Question marks for the invaders
are the blocking which they do or
do not get, and the quarterbaeking
which former center Eddie Forrest
! can produce. With Joe Viselli, Tom
Matula, and Nubby Wright back in
good health, and with the above
questions answered favorably for
them, Santa Clara should present a
problem which only a team on the
top of their game can solve.
If th«re were such a thing, the football championsliip <»f the Far Western
region of (he United States would be at stake tomorrow afternoon in tho
stadium when Stanford contacts Santa Clam's Broncs on the striped green
turf.
Present leader in the P.C.C. race, the Indians will enter the game as

slight favorites, due principally to
their impressive win over Washing
ton last week and the Santa damns'
loss to Oklahoma at the same time.
Despite the Broncos' defeat they are
by far the outstanding independent
team on this side of the Rockies.
Three changes will appear in the
Cards' starting lineup, according to
Head Coach Clark Daniel Shaugh
nessy's announcement. Erie "Hoot"
Armstrong will be back in his start
ing right halfback position in place
of sophomore Willard Sheller who
usurped his spot for the Husky game.
Bruno Banducci is out with a
wrenched knee, leaving Ed McCain
as the opening right tackle. Game
Captain Doug Stable will replace
Vic Lindskog at center.
BANDUCCI MISSING
For Banducci and Lindskog it. will
Ik? the first kickofT they have missed
since they started playing varsity
ball for the Farm. Fred Meyer, who
was out of practice several days
this week with a cold, will be back
at the right end position at which
he won All-Coast honors last year.
Chuck Taylor, Ed Stamm, and Ar
nie Meiners will fill the left side of
the Card line.
