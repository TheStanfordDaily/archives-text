# 'The British Can Take It And Ask for More'—Luck
## Stanford Professor Praises Morale Of Britain, Predicts Axis Defeat 
### 
"The British can lake any kind of rubbing, and they'll still ask for
more," were (he emphatic words of Dr. J. Murray Luck in his talk on
war-time Britain last nii>h( in the Education Auditorium.
The British morale is good, and as long as the flow of goods and supplies
continues from the United States, Britain will win, according to Dr. Luck.

"Not only is Britain fighting for,
survival. So are we, and let's make
no mistake about that," he declared.
Dr. Luck, professor of biochemis
try, returned last month after a
four-week stay in Britain, observing
the food conditions and the general
living in England.
FOOD RATIONS
Registration of food began Sep
tember 29, 1939, according to Dr.
Luck. Actual rationing did not start
until January of the following year.
Each person must name the retailer
with whom be intends to trade. The
retailer is in turn required to buy
from a designated wholesaler, and
the latter is subject to the control of
the National Ministry of Food.
The living costs and food prices
have been surprisingly low because
of price control and government
subsidies. For example, Dr. Luck
listed the prices of the more com
mon commodities. Milk, he said,
costs 7 cents a pint. Bread costs
about 3'/j» cents a pound, and steak
can be bought for about 30 cents a
pound.
Meat, fish, eggs, citrus fruits, and
other foods are somewhat scarce.
Gardens around each home are be
ing transformed into vegetable
patches and are being taken care
of by women because of labor short
age.
HIGH MORALE
But spirit in Britain is high. Every
individual takes part in defense from
aii' raids. The actual destruction by
bombings is relatively slight, al
though certain parts of London are

damaged completely, added Dr.
Luck.
Dr. Luck made the trip to London
in August on u 10,000-ton boat con
voyed with 73 ships, including
several destroyers ana planes. He
obtained information for .several
food committees in this country.
He is the editor of the "Annual

from a designated wholesaler, and
the latter is subject to the control of
the National Ministry of Food.
The living costs and food prices

of price control and government
subsidies. For example, Dr. Luck
listed the prices of the more com
mon commodities. Milk, he said,
costs 7 cents a pint. Bread costs
about 3'/j» cents a pound, and steak
can be bought for about 30 cents a
pound.
Meat, fish, eggs, citrus fruits, and
other foods are somewhat scarce.
Gardens around each home are be
ing transformed into vegetable
patches and are being taken care
of by women because of labor short
age.
