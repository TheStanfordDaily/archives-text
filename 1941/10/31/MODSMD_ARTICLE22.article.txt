# Stanford to Aid Refugees By Supporting Red Cross
## 
### KAY SCHWARTZ 
"Dear Red Cross:
. . Thank you for the hoots and sweater, also the pajamas and
socks. I am ten years old and have heen billeted at Bedford. My father
was captured at Dunkirk and is now a prisoner in Germany. So you
can see how much I needed help . .

Every day the American Red ¥
Cross receives letters such as this i
from refugees of war stricken na
tions, and every day millions of
dollars worth of food, clothing, and
medical supplies are sent from its
national headquarters to the four j
corners of the earth.
The annual Red Cross drive will
be held at Stanford next week, No
vember 3 to 7. Every student who
contributes to this Roll Call has a
right to know just where his money !
is going. The services performed by
the American Red Cross would fill n j
volume, and today's world prob- 1
lems have created a need for even :
more extensive work and increased j
expenditures.
MILLIONS FOR RELIEF
To date, $47,000,000 worth of war
relief has been extended to other I
countries by the Red Cross. Some of j
this vast sum has gone to supply !
food, clothing, and other comfort :
articles to prisoners of war. Some I
has helped to finance the informa
tion service in Geneva whereby !
thousands of families who have
been separated in the course of this '
war are able to find one another
again.
On the home front the American
Red Cross is equally active. Every- i
one is familiar with the work it has !
done in time of disasters: providing
j shelters for the homeless, food for ,
the hungry, and medical attention I
for the injured. But few realize the
tremendous role the Red Cross is
playing in the government national
I defense program.
NATIONAL HEADACHE
When 2,000,000 men are suddenly
I taken from their homes and families
and put into army camps and ill
fitting uniforms, the government has
a national headache.
Drafted men aren't too strong on
| patriotism and love of duty when
I they have family troubles preying
on their minds. The Red Cross field
director, maintaining an office at the
army or naval base, has the responsi
bility of dealing with these prob
lems. Whether the draftee is in
j need of financial assistance or just
advice, the Red Cross is always
I there to help.
Next week every Stanford ,stu
dent will have a chance to con
tribute to the American Red Cross.
JOlN—that dollar you give is an
! investment in America's future.
