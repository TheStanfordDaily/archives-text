# Loss of Papoose Centers Classes Frosh Grid Team As Underdogs Tomorrow
## 
### 
Haled as (lit' toss-up of all time until yesterday when Harry Shipkey
announced Jack McCurdy and Neele Johnston, lirst and second string
centers, would miss the game, the Papoose grid dors go into tomorrow's
game with San Mateo J. C. as definite underdogs. Starting time is 11 a.m.

in Maniord stadium.
With Clem Woods out and Dave
Pate in doubtful condition, Mentor
Shipkey plans a starting backfield of
Don Zappettini at full, Bobby An
drews at quarter, and Fred Sander
man and Fred Parsons at halves.
In the second backfield unit will
be Pate, Jim Pettit, Ross Dana, and
Cannon Parkinson, all at their
normal positions.
With McCurdy and Johnston out,
Pete August moves over from end
to play center.
NO HUDDLE
When the Bulldog offensive opens,
look out for plays'coming up with
out huddle or signal of any kind.
Against Stockton J. C., the Bull
dogs caught their opponents off
guard and scored a touchdown while
the Stockton boys sat around pick
ing daisies waiting for the huddle.
Pate was always good for needed
yardage against A.A.C. last Satur
day, but with him in doubtful shape,
the Papoose offensive lacks a hard
driving back to blast the forward
wall of the undefeated Bulldogs.
SCREEN PASS
Under the tutelage of Murius Mc-
Fadden, the S.M. boys promise an
offensive featuring spinners and
their greatest play, a screen pass, as
used by S.F., when the Dons rang
lip 26 points against the Redskin
varsity.
Man to watch in the Bulldog ball
packers is Lee Gomard, Hawaiian
halfback. Gomard is shifty and fast,
and will bo tough to catch on spin
ners that break a man clear in a
hurry.
