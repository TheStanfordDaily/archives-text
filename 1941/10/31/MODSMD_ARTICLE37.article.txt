SAN JOSE, Oct. 30.—Stanford's
varsity water polo squad tonight
soundly scuttled San Jose State. 10-
4, in the losers' pool. Jack Bleeckcr
led the Redskins with 1 points. Fred
Manwaring dumped in 3, and Boh
Jones, Boh Ilind, and Fred Mitchell
1 apiece. Coach Nort Thornton used
every man on the traveling squad
of 14, and no man played a full
game.

Stanford's varsity water polo team
(angles with the powerful Olympic
Club tonight at S in San Francisco.
This will he the second of five
straight contests the Indians will
play away from home.
In an earlier game this year, the
Card mermen dropped a 6 to 5 de
cision to the Clubmen in a game
that was nip and tuck all the way.
The Post Streeters had to ram in
two quick goals in the last few min
utes of play to overcome a Stanford
lead.
Since then, the Olympic Club has
defeated California twice by scores
of 15 to 8, and 7 to 2. A victory
over Stanford tonight would give
them a perfect season and their
fourth consecutive Northern Cali
fornia water polo title.
A Redskin victory would give
them a chance to tie for the title if
the Indians can beat California. Not
since 1938. however, has the Olym
pic Club been beaten and they go
into the game favorites, according to
Norton Thornton, Card coach.
Outstanding on the Club team are
three Stanford mermen — Chuck
Giffin, Don Peterson, and Bob Walk
er. Giflin captains the Winged O
outfit.
Stanford's tentative starting line
up is the same as last night's with
Bill Mapel, sprint; Grant Culley and
Fred Manwaring, forward; Bob
Jones, center back; Captain Frank
Mitchell and Jack Bleecker, guards;
and Pete Lee, goalie.
