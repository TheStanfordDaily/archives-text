IF YESTERDAY'S semi-final practice session before the Santa Clara
tussle Saturday is any indication, Stanford's Clark Shaughnessy must
figure that brains are going to play an unusually large part in the outcome
of this, the outstanding game on the Coast.
For Shaughnessy wore out several pieces of chalk as he orated at
length wtih the frequent aid of demonstrations on the way the Indians
were going to have to play the game in order to down Buck Shaw's men
from Prune Valley. And by the time that the concentrated skull session
had come to an end, it was 5 o'clock, and the boys still had to go through
their physical workout.
Well, the Broncs have the Braun—Bill's his first name—so it appears
that the Indians will have to have the Brain, which is the middle name of
one Mr. Frank Albert.

there aren't any other games on the Coast that can stand up in
comparison to the gigantic here tomorrow, this being the mid-season
let-down week-end, we'll chop Luckie Louie's weekly report up and
use it piece by piece, with the Santa Clara-Stanford game in the top
spot. Says the Pixley prognosticator:
"Although Santa Clara is going to be a much better team this Sat
urday than it has been thus far this season, I believe that Stanford—
even if the great Bruno Banducci doesn't recover from his leg in
jury in time to play—will take the Broncos. Stanford is rolling now;
the hoys have visions of another New Years in Pasadena; and they arc
net likely to spend much time fooling around."
And the Indians are confident. Not over-confident, but just cocky
enough to play a top rate brand of football. (This is our own note, not
Luckie's.)
O.S.C. OVER IDAHO —"The Beavers took it on the chin against Wash
ington State, and, although they are virtually out of the conference race,
they'll be in there battling to keep from being upset.
WASHINGTON OVER MONTANA—"Here's another game in which the
better team will pull through without too much difficulty. The Huskies
are definitely a superior gang.
CALIFORNIA OVER U.C.L.A. Both teams came through with flying
colors last week, and this should be a tight contest. Despite the fact that
the Bruins appear to have mastered the Q-T formation, I think the Bears
will take the game.
"OTHER PICKS: Oregon over W.S.C., San Jose State over Santa Bar
bara State (tonight), and St. Mary's over Gonzaga (Sunday).

"OTHER PICKS: Oregon over W.S.C., San Jose State over Santa Bar
bara State (tonight), and St. Mary's over Gonzaga (Sunday).
IF YESTERDAY'S semi-final practice session before the Santa Clara
tussle Saturday is any indication, Stanford's Clark Shaughnessy must
figure that brains are going to play an unusually large part in the outcome
of this, the outstanding game on the Coast.
For Shaughnessy wore out several pieces of chalk as he orated at
length wtih the frequent aid of demonstrations on the way the Indians
were going to have to play the game in order to down Buck Shaw's men
from Prune Valley. And by the time that the concentrated skull session
had come to an end, it was 5 o'clock, and the boys still had to go through
their physical workout.
Well, the Broncs have the Braun—Bill's his first name—so it appears
that the Indians will have to have the Brain, which is the middle name of
one Mr. Frank Albert.

there aren't any other games on the Coast that can stand up in
comparison to the gigantic here tomorrow, this being the mid-season
let-down week-end, we'll chop Luckie Louie's weekly report up and
use it piece by piece, with the Santa Clara-Stanford game in the top
spot. Says the Pixley prognosticator:
"Although Santa Clara is going to be a much better team this Sat
urday than it has been thus far this season, I believe that Stanford—
even if the great Bruno Banducci doesn't recover from his leg in
jury in time to play—will take the Broncos. Stanford is rolling now;
the hoys have visions of another New Years in Pasadena; and they arc
net likely to spend much time fooling around."
And the Indians are confident. Not over-confident, but just cocky
enough to play a top rate brand of football. (This is our own note, not
Luckie's.)
O.S.C. OVER IDAHO —"The Beavers took it on the chin against Wash
ington State, and, although they are virtually out of the conference race,
they'll be in there battling to keep from being upset.
WASHINGTON OVER MONTANA—"Here's another game in which the
better team will pull through without too much difficulty. The Huskies
are definitely a superior gang.
CALIFORNIA OVER U.C.L.A. Both teams came through with flying
colors last week, and this should be a tight contest. Despite the fact that
the Bruins appear to have mastered the Q-T formation, I think the Bears
will take the game.
