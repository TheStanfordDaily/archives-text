# In Union There Is Profit, Butâ€”
## 
### 
WEDNESDAY night near the end of the Ac
tivities Forum, Mr. Frank Walker dropped
a statement into the beaker of student opinion
on the Union.
This statement, grossly misunderstood by
his audience, reacted as two chemicals to form
a cloudy precipitate of doubt as to whether or
not Union women were paying off the entire
Memorial Theater debt.
Chairman Pat Adams, who did not want to let
the meeting last more than an hour, inadver
tently closed the evening's discussion before
Mr. Walker was able to secure all the facts and
figures out of his overcoat pocket.
The situation is this:
Each year 75 per cent of the Stanford Union's
profits goes toward payment of the Memorial
Theater note contracted for by the A.S.S.U.
These profits come from operation of the Cellar,
Cellar Store, Encina Cellar, the Old Union Dorm,
the ice cream plant, corporate income (dues,
interest, franchises, etc.), AND the Union dining
halls, both public and residence.
These profits amounted last year (1939-40) to
about $27,000; this year (1940-41), to a little over
$21,000. Toward this latter figure the Union
public dining room and the Union residence
dining hall contributed $5,793.31.
Now this may seem rather large to Union
women. But it must be remembered that this
represents profit over a whole year. And the
total sales in these Union dining halls, public
and residence, from banquets, single meals,
and quarterly board bills, was approximately
$115,000.

This means that the $5,793.31 profit was a
mere 5 per cent of total sales. And 5 per cent
profit is a very modest profit indeed.
In all other University-operated dining halls
a similar modest profit is made. Roble, Lagu
nita, and Encina profits (modest ones) go back
into the general University funds to help pay
half the cost of our education here at Stanford.
When we "make checks payable" on Reg Day
we are only paying half the cost of what we
get.
So we're helping to pay, in a small way, the
cost of educating the Union women.
And the Union women are helping the A.S.-
S.U. to pay, also in a small way, the cost of
Memorial Theater.

and quarterly board bills, was approximately
$115,000.

This means that the $5,793.31 profit was a
mere 5 per cent of total sales. And 5 per cent
profit is a very modest profit indeed.
In all other University-operated dining halls
a similar modest profit is made. Roble, Lagu
nita, and Encina profits (modest ones) go back
into the general University funds to help pay
half the cost of our education here at Stanford.
When we "make checks payable" on Reg Day
we are only paying half the cost of what we
get.
So we're helping to pay, in a small way, the
cost of educating the Union women.
And the Union women are helping the A.S.-
S.U. to pay, also in a small way, the cost of
Memorial Theater.
WEDNESDAY night near the end of the Ac
tivities Forum, Mr. Frank Walker dropped
a statement into the beaker of student opinion
on the Union.
This statement, grossly misunderstood by
his audience, reacted as two chemicals to form
a cloudy precipitate of doubt as to whether or
not Union women were paying off the entire
Memorial Theater debt.
Chairman Pat Adams, who did not want to let
the meeting last more than an hour, inadver
tently closed the evening's discussion before
Mr. Walker was able to secure all the facts and
figures out of his overcoat pocket.
The situation is this:
Each year 75 per cent of the Stanford Union's
profits goes toward payment of the Memorial
Theater note contracted for by the A.S.S.U.
These profits come from operation of the Cellar,
Cellar Store, Encina Cellar, the Old Union Dorm,
the ice cream plant, corporate income (dues,
interest, franchises, etc.), AND the Union dining
halls, both public and residence.
These profits amounted last year (1939-40) to
about $27,000; this year (1940-41), to a little over
$21,000. Toward this latter figure the Union
public dining room and the Union residence
dining hall contributed $5,793.31.
Now this may seem rather large to Union
women. But it must be remembered that this
represents profit over a whole year. And the
total sales in these Union dining halls, public
and residence, from banquets, single meals,
and quarterly board bills, was approximately
$115,000.

This means that the $5,793.31 profit was a
mere 5 per cent of total sales. And 5 per cent
