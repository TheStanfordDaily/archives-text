THOUGH Stanford's Senior Class is laying
itself open to possible ribbing for adopting
an idea from Cal, we think it's worth it.
Come November 12 Stanford will have its first
"Senior Sing."
Stanford has been in need of more small
scale, informal, midweek, comparatively spon
taneous activities for a long time. And a class
sing is just the right thing to fill this bill.
Another perfect justification for making the
Senior Sing a tradition—it is not very often that
classes have any functions exclusive to their
own class from the time they leave Encina and
Roble until it's almost too late to renew old frosh
acquaintances, during Senior Week.
The idea has taken hold so well over at Berke
ley that every class now has them.
Let's start the ball rolling down here with a
top-notch Senior Sing on November 12.
