A GANG of big radio and ASCAP moguls sit
ting around a table in New York Tuesday
afternoon finally signed the papers, finally
reached some agreement on the vital question
which has kept some of the country's finest
music—and Stanford songs too—off most of
the airlanes since January 1, 1941.
We're glad they got things patched up so that
once again radio listeners will be able to hear
"Come Join the Band" and the others ring
through their receivers on Saturday afternoons.

And there won't be all that confusion in Pasa
dena on January 1 next year, no more cutting
off "Sons of the Stanford Red" in the middle
and swinging into Yankee Doodle whenever our
band passes a mike during the parade.
No, it'll all run off smoothly this time.
