### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
ONE COW FROM VERONA

r other day the clouds cleared away, the sky
turned blue, the sun warmed everything, and it
looked much like spring again. The hills and country
side lobked so inviting, I picked up my "Complete
Works of Shakespeare," my binder with all my notes,
my glasses, and went to the hills to study for my
Shakespeare mid-term.
I found a brown mountain with a little flat clear
ing, so I climbed up and stretched out under a crab
apple tree to study. The whole country was alive
with noises and activity. Little crickets chirped and
hopped around. Tiny snakes came out of their houses
to warm their backs in the sun and stretch their stom
achs across the ticklish grass. Birds flew back and
forth singing their old songs and a few new ones,
happy about the sun and things in general. Little
insects of all kinds rushed hurriedly back and forth,
accomplishing all sorts of wonderful works. Eveiything
looked wonderful and right and it was fun lying
there on my back, looking around at things from under
a crab-apple tree, up on a brown mountain, on a
fall day that seemed like spring.

B U . T I had a test the next day, so I forgot about
the pretty things around me and turned to my work.
I read and read and then I looked up and there was a
fat, brown cow leaning on the crab-apple tree, looking
me in the eye. I hadn't expected to meet anyone on
the mountain, so I was surprised. "How now, cow,"
I said. "What do you want?"
I must have been lying in the cow's favorite spot,
because she didn't answer me, but instead kept looking
me in the eye with a mean look, and edging closer
and closer. â€¢
Now I have never been one that was scared of a
cow, but alone there on the mountain, the cow looked
big and brown and dangerous, so I left my book and
notes and crawled under the fence and out of her
reach.
The cow watched me triumphantly, then spotted my
open binder and started eating my Shakespeare notes.
Up went the syllabus, up went the lecturc on tragedy,
up went the notes on Medieval life, up went the vio
lated Lucrece, up went Romeo and also Juliet, up
went King John, up went King Richard (I'm not sure
it it was Richard II or Richard III) and up went
everything until the cow had a pretty fair background
of Shakespeare inside her. Then she turned and, with
a sophisticated, bored smile, she walked away.

r pHE next morning I went back to the mountain, to
see if I could find the cow and take her to the
test with me. (Dr. Bailey allows notes to be used dur
ing her tests.) But when I got there, I saw a whole
herd of cows instead of my cow, and most of them
were brown, but none had the mean look. So I'm hop
ing that Dr. Bailey will take this into consideration in
correcting my paper, and think of the cow, and think
of me watching the cow eat, and think of how much
better I could have done if I had been able to bring
the cow to class yesterday.
