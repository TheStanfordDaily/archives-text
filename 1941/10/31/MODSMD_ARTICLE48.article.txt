ANOTHER "M" JOINS THE FIGHT

r EDITOR, SIR:
At the risk of entering what is rapidly becoming
a "free for all," I would like to poke a curious thumb
into the Moses-MellinkofT-Mitchell pie, recently pulled
out of the oven and apparently still hot.

Why is it that a person of Mr. MellinkofFs brains
and obvious self-confidence has deliberately and per
sistently avoided a straight-forward, honest discussion
of the isolationist-interventionist problems? With lit
erary and legal skill he hedges around—one might al
most say crawled under—the all too pertinent ques
tions of Lin Moses. Hasn't Sherman forgotten his posi
tion? He is no longer in the varsity debate attempting
to support his stand by skillful manipulation of fact
and word. The questions which Mr. Moses proposed
are not answerable with witty verbalizations. They
are flesh and blood issues. (No quibbling about meta
phors, please.)

Such sidetracks as criticizing didactic when it is
clear to anyone with half a cerebrum that dialectic
was the word intended by Moses are hardly more than
petty.
Worse is Mr. MellinkofFs liberal distortion of quo
tation. It is simple to pick a fallacy in one's own
version of another's statement, isn't it? In case you've
forgotten, Sherman, it's the very first item in your so
called answer. (Daily, Oct. 27.)
Item two collapses with a similar thud. Moses did
not "charge(s) intervention with phalanx of doubts."
In fact, I would be interested to have Mr. Mellinkoff
quote (and accurately, pltSase) any charges in what
Lin wrote. Since when are MellinkofFs interferences
equal to Moses' charges?

This goes also for Sherman's clearly false sugges
tion that Moses implied that defense would not be a
strain. He and everybody else knows that defense is a
strain. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER GOING TO
WAR WOULD BE A GREATER STRAIN Mr. Mellin
koff covered with a sweeping generalization that clev
erly but not too honorably confused the issue.'

On the question of freedom (Daily, Oct. 30) he is
equally evasive. 'It. is true that Hitler's way is not the
way of freedom we desire. But is it true that by going
to war the United States will best find the freedom of
personal liberties and tolerance?
What about a straightforward answer with some
attempt to be constructive, Mr. Mellinkoff?
Sincerely,
Mary Merner

r JMIE EDITOR, SIR:
It would seem Rally Committee is on the carpet.
Okay, so we got re-konked. Could we make a
point, however—just in passing? Allegedly, we are
blase because we deemed it inadvisable, in the light
of recent events—i.e., the U.S.F. Rally— to arrange a
Santa Clara rally. Rally Committee does not operate
in a vacuum; student opinion, at large, seemed to dis
approve such a rally. And the team, admittedly, was
disappointed at the half-hearted student response to
the U.S.F. Rally.

So, Rally Committee decided to concentrate on the
Pajamarino and the Big Game Parade and Rally.
As for the sticker, it was so successful last year
that we felt campus sentiment called for—nay de
manded—a return engagement.
Use that stored-up energy in the rooting section,
Saturday.
Honest, Gordy, we're sorry —

point, however—just in passing? Allegedly, we are
blase because we deemed it inadvisable, in the light

Santa Clara rally. Rally Committee does not operate
in a vacuum; student opinion, at large, seemed to dis
approve such a rally. And the team, admittedly, was
disappointed at the half-hearted student response to
the U.S.F. Rally.

ANOTHER "M" JOINS THE FIGHT

r EDITOR, SIR:
At the risk of entering what is rapidly becoming
a "free for all," I would like to poke a curious thumb
into the Moses-MellinkofT-Mitchell pie, recently pulled
out of the oven and apparently still hot.

Why is it that a person of Mr. MellinkofFs brains
and obvious self-confidence has deliberately and per
sistently avoided a straight-forward, honest discussion
of the isolationist-interventionist problems? With lit
erary and legal skill he hedges around—one might al
most say crawled under—the all too pertinent ques
tions of Lin Moses. Hasn't Sherman forgotten his posi
tion? He is no longer in the varsity debate attempting
to support his stand by skillful manipulation of fact
and word. The questions which Mr. Moses proposed
are not answerable with witty verbalizations. They
are flesh and blood issues. (No quibbling about meta
phors, please.)

Such sidetracks as criticizing didactic when it is
clear to anyone with half a cerebrum that dialectic
was the word intended by Moses are hardly more than
petty.
Worse is Mr. MellinkofFs liberal distortion of quo
tation. It is simple to pick a fallacy in one's own
version of another's statement, isn't it? In case you've
forgotten, Sherman, it's the very first item in your so
called answer. (Daily, Oct. 27.)
Item two collapses with a similar thud. Moses did
not "charge(s) intervention with phalanx of doubts."
In fact, I would be interested to have Mr. Mellinkoff
quote (and accurately, pltSase) any charges in what
Lin wrote. Since when are MellinkofFs interferences
equal to Moses' charges?

This goes also for Sherman's clearly false sugges
tion that Moses implied that defense would not be a
strain. He and everybody else knows that defense is a
strain. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER GOING TO
WAR WOULD BE A GREATER STRAIN Mr. Mellin
koff covered with a sweeping generalization that clev
erly but not too honorably confused the issue.'

On the question of freedom (Daily, Oct. 30) he is
equally evasive. 'It. is true that Hitler's way is not the
way of freedom we desire. But is it true that by going
to war the United States will best find the freedom of
personal liberties and tolerance?
What about a straightforward answer with some
attempt to be constructive, Mr. Mellinkoff?

not "charge(s) intervention with phalanx of doubts."
In fact, I would be interested to have Mr. Mellinkoff
quote (and accurately, pltSase) any charges in what
Lin wrote. Since when are MellinkofFs interferences
equal to Moses' charges?

This goes also for Sherman's clearly false sugges
tion that Moses implied that defense would not be a
strain. He and everybody else knows that defense is a
strain. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER GOING TO
WAR WOULD BE A GREATER STRAIN Mr. Mellin
koff covered with a sweeping generalization that clev
erly but not too honorably confused the issue.'

On the question of freedom (Daily, Oct. 30) he is
equally evasive. 'It. is true that Hitler's way is not the
way of freedom we desire. But is it true that by going
to war the United States will best find the freedom of
personal liberties and tolerance?
What about a straightforward answer with some
attempt to be constructive, Mr. Mellinkoff?
Sincerely,
Mary Merner

r JMIE EDITOR, SIR:
It would seem Rally Committee is on the carpet.
Okay, so we got re-konked. Could we make a
point, however—just in passing? Allegedly, we are
blase because we deemed it inadvisable, in the light
of recent events—i.e., the U.S.F. Rally— to arrange a
Santa Clara rally. Rally Committee does not operate
in a vacuum; student opinion, at large, seemed to dis
approve such a rally. And the team, admittedly, was
disappointed at the half-hearted student response to
the U.S.F. Rally.

So, Rally Committee decided to concentrate on the
Pajamarino and the Big Game Parade and Rally.
As for the sticker, it was so successful last year
that we felt campus sentiment called for—nay de
manded—a return engagement.
Use that stored-up energy in the rooting section,
Saturday.
Honest, Gordy, we're sorry —
Pi Thornton
Mickey Levee
(Hut is it not still true that, in (lie light of the
successful train rally after the Oregon State game,
we never should have wasted a rally three days
later on the U.S.F. I treat her.—The Fditor)
