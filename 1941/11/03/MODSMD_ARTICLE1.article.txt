### AMIE REICHERT 
JTS a little late to start bickering
about technical formalities and
splitting semantical hairs. The U.S.
is at war with Germany and has
been for some time. If one must
draw a line somewhere to affix a be
ginning to the "state of war" between
the two nations, perhaps the Presi
dent's "shoot first" speech early in
September is as good a time as any.
Declarations of war have be
come quite passe. Adolf Hitler,
who is a master in the art of
wholesale slaughter, has knocked
n dozen countries cold without
ever taking the trouble to inform
the governments or the people that
all the shooting signified this thing
called war. lie made his meaning
clear nevertheless.

As a matter of fact Hitler wasn't
just being unconventional for un
conventionality's sake when he de
cided not to pin a label* on his activi
ties. There were decided political
advantages to be gained by not
formally declaring war. Under in
ternational law hosilities in the ab
sence of a formal declaration do not
constitute a war.

Thus aggressor nations wage all
out blitzkrieg war on the one hand
and on the other turn around and
wink at the rest of the world and
the people at home. The propaganda
value in this sort of thing is im
portant.

J N the second place, up until the
days when undeclared wars first
became popular (the Manchurian
"incident," 1931, Sino - Japanese
"hostilities," 1937, German-Austrian
"anschluss," 1938) the League of
Nations and the concept of collective
security had not yet been aban
doned as restraining forces on over
enthusiastic nations.
As long as war was not formally
declared the League could not force
all its members to employ punitive
measures against the aggressor.
Furthermore, by not declaring
was an aggressor nation could nul
lify the efficacy of neutrality leg
islation (such as the U.S. had un
til 1939) which prohibited aid to
cither of the belligerents; or (since
1939) which invoked sanctions
against the aggressor, should the
President choose to find that a
state of war existed.
The Axis powers were fully
aware of these advantages when
they embarked on careers of unde
clared war.
* * *
|}UT for the U.S. there are no such
advantages. Collective security
has collapsed along with interna
tional law. Besides, we have been
attacked, we are not the aggressor.
It does not help to argue that we
asked for it; that if we are going to
send our ships as protective convoys
for fleets bearing arms to a bellig
erent, Germany is justified in sink
ing them.
The important thing is that she
has sunk our ships, that we are
lighting back, that convoys do
mean shooting, and shooting is war
whether we choose to call it that
or not.
And what if we should call it
that? What if we should declare
war on Germany? The immediate
result of such a declaration would
be to lift, the American public from
th estate of apathetic unreality in
which it finds itself, unify and con
centrate labor and business in a re
newed all-out effort, blast the na
tionwide feeling of "business as
usual."

yyCCORDING to William Philip
Simms, Fulton Lewis, and many
another Washington commentator,
Congressional sentiment is beginning
to develop steadily along these lines.
The sinking of the Reuben James
seems to have crystallized the situa
tion.
Even an isolationist, if he is in
tellectually honest, must conccdc
today that this country is at war.
According to William Shirer, dur
ing the entire length of World
War I the U.S. lost two warships;
already in the past few weeks
alone we have had one sunk and
one damaged.

Refusing to call a spade a spade
does not solve the problem; refusing
to pigeon-hole these hostilities in
the War category docs not deny the
fact that war exists.
