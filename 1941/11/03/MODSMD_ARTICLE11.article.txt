# Horace, The Boy Scout, Gets Educated—The Hard, Wet Way
## 
### PHIL HORNBY 
(Editor's Note: The following is a generally damp account of the
week-end spent in becoming a Stanford man by one Horace Smith,
voted by various sources as "typical" of (he 4,50(1 scouts who enjoyed
the hospitality of the University at the three-day 1941 Emergency
Service O'Rama.

At about 5 p.m. Friday Horace arrived at the intramural football
field with his pup-tent, scout knife, extra shirt, and general scouting spirit.
He was soon joined by considerable rain, about 300 other scouts, and

darkness. Using his triple-position
fiashlght, he was delighted to find
that somebody had lined the ground
with chalk marks (ordinarily used
for marking the intramural grid
fields) and proceeded to dig ditches
along them to keep the water out of
his water-proof sleeping bag.
After this pioneering procedure
known as "ditching," he arranged
his pup tent, crawled underneath,
erected middle pole of same, crawled
outside, knocked pole down, returned
and repeated the procedure, and
eventually secured an abode.
CAME THE DAWN
Dawned Saturday and Horace as
sisted various of his arriving fellows
to develop aquatic camping meth
ods, after which he participated in a
mass breakfast cooking.. .followed
in many cases by lunch at the Stan
ford Union.
At noon Horace was handed an
American flag and marched to the
stadium. Arriving about, an hour
early, he sat in the rain watching
some 75,000 people gather to see
him and 22 football players perforin.
Assisted by the Stanford and Santa
Clara bands, he and about 500 of
his friends presented "Scouting,
America's Answer" between halves.
After the ceremony he returned to
camp, took the lid off his dinner
with his chromium can opener, and
wended his soaked way to the base
ball field.
Before a sizeable crowd he par
ticipated in a first-aid stunt as part
of a mass demonstration of scouting
emergency skills.
After the program, he dried off
his clothes by walking up the Row.
While wondering whether the proper
way to miss rain was walk through
it and dodge it, or sleep in it and
let it roll off, mercy personified by
several Phi Kappa Sigma brothers,
smiled. Invited by the house to
spend a comfortable night in their
guest room, he caught several hours
of sleep btewcen the conversations
of incoming members and outgoing
snores.
