# Tuesday Series To Probe Films
## Rosten to Discuss Film Capital Legend 
### 
Contrasting Hollywood as the pub
lic thinks it is and Hollywood as it
really is, Leo C. Rosten, well known
author of the H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P-
stories written under the
name of Leonard Q. Ross, will speak
tomorrow evening in Memorial Au
ditorium at 7:30 for the Tuesday Se
ries program.
Believing that besides being the
fourth largest industry, movie-mak
ing is the most complex and socio
logically important, Mr. Rosten has
spent the last three years in Holly
wood on a study to bring out the
true, connected picture of the com
plicated web of social, economic, and
artistic forces at work there.
MOVIE PEOPLE SUBJECT
In his talk tomorrow evening,
titled "The Hollywood Legend," Mr.
Rosten will give information on the
kinds of people who make the mov
ies, answering such questions as
where they are from, how much edu
cation they have had, and what their
attitudes, opinions, and problems
are.
After writing the "Kaplan" stories,
Mr. Rosten spent some time in Hol
lywood writing for the movies. It
was then that he was able to observe
enough of the movie capital to be
come convinced that it deserved a
job of sociological study. The Car
negie and Rockefeller foundations
thought so too, and it was these or
ganizations that made the research
project possible.
TWO YEARS' RESEARCH
Six to eleven assistants worked
with him on two years of research
work and a year spent in correlat
ing material and writing reports for
publication.
The door of Mr. Rosten's Holly
wood office bears the title of "Mo
tion Picture Research Project," and
he tells how people were always
popping in looking for movie jobs.
One woman, he said, brought in a
child and said, "If you'll research
my little girl, you II find shes lietter
than Shirley Temple."
