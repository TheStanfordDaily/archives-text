# Indian-Bronco Fracas 'Proves' Shaughnessy's '41 Model Equal to '40
## Cards Produce Lightning Thrusts To Score as Fawcett Resurrects Old Title, 'Scourge of Los Banos' 
### 
Saturday's "season's greatest game" in which Stanford's intelligent
football team humbled Santa Clara, 27 to 7, cleared up several Items here
tofore in doubt, and further established several other already proven
facts:
The ''11 model T is equal to its '40 predecessor.

The Indians deserve a trip to Pasa
dena.
They can score on a sustained
march down the field.
Frankie Albert deserves AJI
- honors.
So does Pete Kmetovic.
So does Chuck Taylor.
The above facts have been mulled
about in many people's minds for
some time now, but the Broncos'
defeat brings them out as acknowl
edged facts. Saturday's game was
only added proof to the following
statements:
SHAUGIINESSY BRAINV
Coach Clark Shaughnessy of this
school is a very brainy individual in
matters concerning football.
The T formation in the proper
hands is the most deadly scoring
weapon known to map.
A good offense is the best de
fense against a good defense.
Santa Clara never is a "soft
touch."
Inclement weather won't keep
people away from something they
want to see. Even proven facts.
BRONCS HELD BACK?
Although there is a faint possi
bility that, as a dejected Bronc stu
dent rooter said as he left the sta
dium after the game, Coach Buck
Shaw of the Santa Clarans "held
back his scoring plays for St.
Marys," most observers felt that the
visitors gave all they had, which
was quite a bit, but just weren't
capable of competing with the light—
ning-like thrusts of the Cards.
They must have been lightning
like, since four touchdowns were
scored by Stanford in the slightly
more-than five minutes time in
which they were in Bronc territory.
The majority of the game was played
with Stanford defending deep in her
own territory.
The opening minutes of play took
on the appearance of so many other
Stanford football games since the
advent of the T. We scored quick,
then they scored equally as quick.
BUCK FAWCETT SPRINTS
However, after Buck Fawcett
sprinted 80 yards down the sidelines
to the second Card score, the
Broncs never got back in the ball
game. Up until last week-end Faw
cett has been the sophomore with
plenty of natural ability who never
showed much of it. He was to busy
running the wrong place at the
wrong time to really show why he
was the "scourge of Los Banos"
when in high school.
The play which enabled Kmeto
vic to score the first touchdown,
which also set Fawcett loose for his
score, and which unnerved the
Broncs at other times during the
game, was one of Coach Clark's
little gems.
After maneuvering the ball close
to the right sidelines, Albert would
call out several numbers, plus in
structions for blocking, which would
send the tailback through the big
opening left by the opposing line
backer moving over slightly to fur
ther protect the wide side.
Blocks by Freddie Meyer and Tay
lor left only Kenny Casenega and
Eddie Forrest for Kmet to elude,
which he did, even in the confines of
the sidelines. After Fawcett bucked

one man out of the way, lie out
travelled the rest of his attackers.
Many slightly "previous bridge- |
crossers" have wondered what would \
happen if one of those five men in
the middle of the Big Red line met
with a mishap. One of them, Bruno
Banducci, did last week, but stocky
Ed McCain stepped in to fill the
breech so admirably that Bruno was
hardly missed.
Coach Justin M. Barry of U.S.C.
after scouting Saturday's game went
home with an excellent idea of the
troubles which his team will en- |
counter next Saturday in the L.A. |
Coliseum.

matters concerning football.
The T formation in the proper
hands is the most deadly scoring
weapon known to map.
A good offense is the best de
fense against a good defense.
Santa Clara never is a "soft
touch."
Inclement weather won't keep
people away from something they
want to see. Even proven facts.
BRONCS HELD BACK?
Although there is a faint possi
bility that, as a dejected Bronc stu
dent rooter said as he left the sta
dium after the game, Coach Buck
Shaw of the Santa Clarans "held
back his scoring plays for St.
Marys," most observers felt that the
visitors gave all they had, which
was quite a bit, but just weren't
capable of competing with the light—
ning-like thrusts of the Cards.
They must have been lightning
like, since four touchdowns were
scored by Stanford in the slightly
more-than five minutes time in
which they were in Bronc territory.
The majority of the game was played
with Stanford defending deep in her
own territory.
The opening minutes of play took
on the appearance of so many other
Stanford football games since the
advent of the T. We scored quick,
then they scored equally as quick.
BUCK FAWCETT SPRINTS
However, after Buck Fawcett
sprinted 80 yards down the sidelines
to the second Card score, the
Broncs never got back in the ball
game. Up until last week-end Faw
cett has been the sophomore with
plenty of natural ability who never
showed much of it. He was to busy
running the wrong place at the
wrong time to really show why he
was the "scourge of Los Banos"
when in high school.
The play which enabled Kmeto
vic to score the first touchdown,
which also set Fawcett loose for his
score, and which unnerved the
Broncs at other times during the
game, was one of Coach Clark's
little gems.
After maneuvering the ball close
to the right sidelines, Albert would
call out several numbers, plus in
structions for blocking, which would
send the tailback through the big
opening left by the opposing line
backer moving over slightly to fur
ther protect the wide side.
Blocks by Freddie Meyer and Tay
lor left only Kenny Casenega and
Eddie Forrest for Kmet to elude,
which he did, even in the confines of
the sidelines. After Fawcett bucked

one man out of the way, lie out
travelled the rest of his attackers.
Many slightly "previous bridge- |
crossers" have wondered what would \
happen if one of those five men in
the middle of the Big Red line met
with a mishap. One of them, Bruno
Banducci, did last week, but stocky
Ed McCain stepped in to fill the
breech so admirably that Bruno was
hardly missed.
Coach Justin M. Barry of U.S.C.
after scouting Saturday's game went
home with an excellent idea of the
troubles which his team will en- |
counter next Saturday in the L.A. |
Coliseum.
Saturday's "season's greatest game" in which Stanford's intelligent
football team humbled Santa Clara, 27 to 7, cleared up several Items here
tofore in doubt, and further established several other already proven
facts:
The ''11 model T is equal to its '40 predecessor.

The Indians deserve a trip to Pasa
dena.
They can score on a sustained
march down the field.
Frankie Albert deserves AJI
- honors.
So does Pete Kmetovic.
So does Chuck Taylor.

with Stanford defending deep in her
own territory.
The opening minutes of play took
on the appearance of so many other
Stanford football games since the
advent of the T. We scored quick,
then they scored equally as quick.
BUCK FAWCETT SPRINTS
However, after Buck Fawcett
sprinted 80 yards down the sidelines
to the second Card score, the
Broncs never got back in the ball
game. Up until last week-end Faw
cett has been the sophomore with
plenty of natural ability who never
showed much of it. He was to busy
running the wrong place at the
wrong time to really show why he
was the "scourge of Los Banos"
when in high school.
The play which enabled Kmeto
vic to score the first touchdown,
which also set Fawcett loose for his
score, and which unnerved the
Broncs at other times during the
game, was one of Coach Clark's
little gems.
After maneuvering the ball close
to the right sidelines, Albert would
call out several numbers, plus in
structions for blocking, which would
send the tailback through the big
opening left by the opposing line
backer moving over slightly to fur
ther protect the wide side.
Blocks by Freddie Meyer and Tay
lor left only Kenny Casenega and
Eddie Forrest for Kmet to elude,
which he did, even in the confines of
the sidelines. After Fawcett bucked

one man out of the way, lie out
travelled the rest of his attackers.
Many slightly "previous bridge- |
crossers" have wondered what would \
happen if one of those five men in
the middle of the Big Red line met
with a mishap. One of them, Bruno
Banducci, did last week, but stocky
Ed McCain stepped in to fill the
breech so admirably that Bruno was
hardly missed.
Coach Justin M. Barry of U.S.C.
after scouting Saturday's game went
home with an excellent idea of the
troubles which his team will en- |
counter next Saturday in the L.A. |
Coliseum.
Saturday's "season's greatest game" in which Stanford's intelligent
football team humbled Santa Clara, 27 to 7, cleared up several Items here
tofore in doubt, and further established several other already proven
facts:
The ''11 model T is equal to its '40 predecessor.

The Indians deserve a trip to Pasa
dena.
They can score on a sustained
march down the field.
Frankie Albert deserves AJI
- honors.
So does Pete Kmetovic.
So does Chuck Taylor.
The above facts have been mulled
about in many people's minds for
some time now, but the Broncos'
defeat brings them out as acknowl
edged facts. Saturday's game was
only added proof to the following
statements:
SHAUGIINESSY BRAINV
Coach Clark Shaughnessy of this
school is a very brainy individual in
matters concerning football.
The T formation in the proper
hands is the most deadly scoring
weapon known to map.
A good offense is the best de
fense against a good defense.
Santa Clara never is a "soft
touch."
Inclement weather won't keep
people away from something they
want to see. Even proven facts.
BRONCS HELD BACK?
Although there is a faint possi
bility that, as a dejected Bronc stu
dent rooter said as he left the sta
dium after the game, Coach Buck
Shaw of the Santa Clarans "held
back his scoring plays for St.
Marys," most observers felt that the
visitors gave all they had, which
was quite a bit, but just weren't
capable of competing with the light—
ning-like thrusts of the Cards.
They must have been lightning
like, since four touchdowns were
scored by Stanford in the slightly
more-than five minutes time in
which they were in Bronc territory.
The majority of the game was played
with Stanford defending deep in her
own territory.
