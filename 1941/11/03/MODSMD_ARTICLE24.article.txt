# Coach Clark Is 'Great'
## Shaughnessy Names Texas as Top Team On Sunday Program 
### 
"We in the East believe Clark
Shaughnessy 1o be one of the great
est coaches of all time," spoke Coach
Lou Little, of Columbia, on the j
nation - wide "Second Guessers"
broadcast Sunday, following a dis
cussion by Little and Henry Mc-
Lcrnore of a possible Stanford-Navy
Rose Bowl game.
J n S;in Francisco, Shaughnessy
;ind Bill Leiser, Chronicle sports edi- j
tor, had different considerations. !
"Why don't you invite Texas to
play in the Hose Bowl with you New
Y» ar's Day?" asked Leiser.
L! ISIJI—A JINX
"Mr. Leiser," replied Shaugh- '
nessy, "if you ever mention us in
connection with the Rose Bowl
again, I'll quit this program cold. 1
can't stand a jinx like that. It's bad
enough to have you pick us every
week."
"At present," Leiser was saying a
little later, "Stanford is leading the
conference with live teams tied for
second place. Now, if you would just
lose another game, there would be
six teams tied for first."
"There is not a team in the con

"that can be certain of losing no
more games."
"Do you think U.S.C. can beat
you? * Leiser pressed.
"U.S.C. rested Saturday, and Sam
Barry was watching us. They might
give us trouble." Surveying other

conference games for next week,
the coach stated that the two best
defensive clubs of the Coast, Wash
ington and California, may battle
to a 0-0 deadlock
But the Stanford-Santa Clara
game was the big topic of conver
sation. "Do you know," said Leiser,
"that your team ran only twelve
scrimmage plays in the first half, yet
scored twenty points, that 54 min
utes and 3 seconds of the game's
(50 minutes was played in its own
half of the field, and that it let Santa
Clara have the ball three-fourths
of the time?"
WAS I WORRIED?
"And you asked me what I was
worried about!"
"I never saw a team that could
do that and yet keep game control,"
Leiser continued.
"Except for Frankie Albert!" in
terjected the coach. "What u field
general he is! He had to light ten
minutes to get out of the hole. The
problem was getting through. It
took a Frankie Albert to do that."
Also, such players as Fete JKmeto
vic and Chuck Taylor were roundly
praised. "And I thought McCain, in
the injured Banducci's place, played
a very fine game," said Shaughnessy
in closing, and with his promise to
be on hand next week, the program
ended.

CLARK SHAUGHNESSY
ference," Shaughnessy commented,
"Texas, best in the nation"
"We in the East believe Clark
Shaughnessy 1o be one of the great
est coaches of all time," spoke Coach
Lou Little, of Columbia, on the j
nation - wide "Second Guessers"
broadcast Sunday, following a dis
cussion by Little and Henry Mc-
Lcrnore of a possible Stanford-Navy
Rose Bowl game.
J n S;in Francisco, Shaughnessy
;ind Bill Leiser, Chronicle sports edi- j
tor, had different considerations. !
"Why don't you invite Texas to
play in the Hose Bowl with you New
Y» ar's Day?" asked Leiser.
L! ISIJI—A JINX
"Mr. Leiser," replied Shaugh- '
nessy, "if you ever mention us in
connection with the Rose Bowl
again, I'll quit this program cold. 1
can't stand a jinx like that. It's bad
enough to have you pick us every
week."
"At present," Leiser was saying a
little later, "Stanford is leading the
conference with live teams tied for
second place. Now, if you would just
lose another game, there would be
six teams tied for first."
"There is not a team in the con

"that can be certain of losing no
more games."
"Do you think U.S.C. can beat
you? * Leiser pressed.
"U.S.C. rested Saturday, and Sam
Barry was watching us. They might
give us trouble." Surveying other

conference games for next week,
the coach stated that the two best
defensive clubs of the Coast, Wash
ington and California, may battle
to a 0-0 deadlock
But the Stanford-Santa Clara
game was the big topic of conver
sation. "Do you know," said Leiser,
"that your team ran only twelve
scrimmage plays in the first half, yet
scored twenty points, that 54 min
utes and 3 seconds of the game's
(50 minutes was played in its own
half of the field, and that it let Santa
Clara have the ball three-fourths
of the time?"
WAS I WORRIED?
"And you asked me what I was
worried about!"
"I never saw a team that could
do that and yet keep game control,"
Leiser continued.
"Except for Frankie Albert!" in
terjected the coach. "What u field
general he is! He had to light ten
minutes to get out of the hole. The
problem was getting through. It
took a Frankie Albert to do that."
Also, such players as Fete JKmeto
vic and Chuck Taylor were roundly
praised. "And I thought McCain, in
