## 
### 
ROME, Nov. 2 (UP).â€”The Na
tional Confederation of Artisans and
Tailors, meeting at Milan, voted to
day that men's trouser cuffs be de
clared unsanitary, pro-British and
generally unstylish.
The confederation declared that
the cuffs are "a waste of perfectly
j good material which should be used
j elsewhere," and added:
| "Trouser cuffs are veritable dust
bins which are most unhealthy to
have attached to ihe trouser legs.
Furthermore, this fad was intro
duced by a member of the British
royal family who went in for setting
style as a prince."
