# CRIMEA ALMOST LOST TO GERMAN LEGIONS

BERLIN, Nov. 3 UP). â€” One
month after ordering a last "deci
sive" offensive this year, Adolf Hit
ler appeared today (Monday) to be
on the verge of overrunning the
Crimea, seat of the great Sevastopol
naval base, and the Donets valley,
center of most of Russia's war sup
plies.
Nazi forces claimed the capture of
Simferopol, Crimean capital, within
35 miles of Sevastopol, and appar
ently were swiftly approaching a po
sition where they could attempt to
span the narrow straits separating
the peninsula from the mainland
and loose a drive on the oil-rich
Caucasus.
|But the picture was not all black
for the Russian defenders. Russian
reports said the Germans were fall
ing back before determined Soviet
counterattacks west and north of
Moscow, and before Leningrad Axis
forces were being kept on the defen
sive.)
