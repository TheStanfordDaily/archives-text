### 
Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, director
emeritus of the Food Research In
stitute, has contributed a 32-page
pamphlet, "Germany Then and
Now," to a recently published series
of short accounts of current inter
national topics entitled, "America in
a World at Wor."
Dr. Taylor contrasts the Germany
of today with the Germany of the
days before World War I, and notes
the changes in that country from the
time of the Hohenzollerns to the
time of Hitler. The substance of the
contrast is the loss of liberty and
freedom in virtually every aspect of
public and private life.
If the Allies win, he believes, an
enduring peace must include a
peace within Germany, the recovery
of the spirit of equality with other
nations, and rejection of the ambi
tion of a dictatorship over the rest
of the world.
