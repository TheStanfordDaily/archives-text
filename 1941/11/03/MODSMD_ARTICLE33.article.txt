# Mermen Display 'Magnificent' Defense as 'Winged O' Wins
## 
### 
Olympic Club's vaunted water polo team again proved too much for
Stanford Friday night as the powerful Post Street mermen defeated Stan
ford, (> to .'5.
Although Stanford "played its best game of the season," according to
Coach Norton Thornton, the Farm swimmers just couldn't match the Club

ollense. Stanford put on a
cent defense in holding the Olympic
Club as much as they did, Thornton
added.
Pete Lee, sophomore goalie, was
particularly outstanding. The rest of
the backfield â€” forwards Frank
Mitchell and Jack Bleecker and Cen
ter Back Bob Jones, also played
well, said Thornton.
CULLEY ABSENT
With Grant Culley, high-scoring
forward, in the rest home with a
cold, Stanford's offense just couldn't
get going until the final quarter.
Thornton did find a capable substi
tute, however, in Bert Singer, re
serve goalie, who filled in very ac
ceptably for Culley at forward.
Jack Bleecker, Singer, and
Mitchell each scored one goal for

Stanford, while Shields, Keeler, and
Popovich shared the Olympic Cldb's '
scoring equally.
The Olympic Club led 3 to 1 at
halftime and 5 to 1 at the end of
the third quarter. Stanford's only
score came in the second quarter
when Bleecker intercepted an
Olympic Club pass and slapped it
past the Club goalie.
NEW COMBINATION
The final quarter saw a new com
bination of Hadley Bacon at sprint
and Singer and Mapel at forward
take over and start a determined
comeback. Singer tallied from close
in while Mitchell dribhled the
length of the pool for another score.
With a minute to go, Popovich shot
the final goal of the contest.
Stanford journeys southward next
week-end, meeting U.S.C. Friday
afternoon in the Trojan pool and
U.C.L.A. Saturday morning in the
Bruin water.
