# Zappettini, Pate Spark Papooses to 13-7 Victory Over S.M.J.C.; Cal Next
## 
### 
Stanford frosh 13, S.MJ.C. 7.
And nM'st of what the Papooses got Saturday they owe to their mud
ders—Don Zappettini and Dave Pate.
It wes Piedmont Don, cleats sticking lo soggy turf like flics to fly
paper, picking his way through a stubborn Jaysee line, shifting to high

gear in the secondary again
again in the third quarter, and fi
nally scoring on an end sweep as j
Bill Young blocked out the last Bull
dog to get in his way.
And it was Pate, hurling a wet
ball 40 yards to Cannon Parkinson
for the fourth-quarter score. Forty
yards with that pigskin was real
football -
NO HUDDLE' BEFUDDLES
Curious thing about San Mateo's
offense. Their two big scoring
threats, a screen pass and a "no
huddle" play, had been thoroughly
advertised. But the Bulldogs didn't
throw a pass until the last quarter,
and nary a play went without a
huddle until,the last quarter.
But when that screen pass came
with left half Jim Gomard south
pawing to Wiley Mudgett all over
the field, it clicked like a good
thing. The "screen" series finally
ended on the frosh 12, where full
back Phil Corbin bucked over in
three tries. The "no huddle," though
only tried once, was good for. 14
yards.
Incidentally, Minnesota beat
Northwestern Saturday on the
identical play.
PETTIT BLOCKS
Halfback Jim Pettit, who ran in
sensational fashion against Alham- <
bra Athletic Club, carried the ball
so many times during the first two
quarters he could hardly stand up in
the second half when called on and
looked as .if he were waiting around
for rigor mortis to set in.
Pettit's blocking game was superb.
Normally a running half, he was
shifted to the blocking post for
change and did equally well. Look
for him on Coach Clark's varsity
next season.
Both clubs failed to score in the
first half, but the Redskin babes
were knocking on the door via the
aerial route with three minutes to
go . Parkinson, on his own 27-yard
line, unleashed passes to Dave
Brown, Ross Dana, and Pettit mov
ing the ball to the S.M. 41.
There it bogged down and stopped
cold as the half ended.
ZAPP' ROLLS
Came the second half with Zap
pettini clicking off yard after yard,
and the Papoose machine roared
from the Jaysee 40 on and over,
"Zapp" tallying from 30 yards out.
Fred Parsons looks as if he could
run the 100-yard dash in 9.7 the
way he was traveling. Subbing for
Pettit he looked all over another
Freddy Meyer on blocking.
Harry Shipkey got his boys to lat
eral. And they were o.k. Pate, trap
ped once just over the scrimmage
line, lateraled out to Pettit for a
16-yard gain.
BROWN LIKE GRAFF
, Starting at right end. Bob Hall
looked great and should improve
with experience.
"Bomber" Brown blasted across
the line once and nailed Corbin for
a loss the same way Stan Graff
dropped a Nebraska Cornhusker in
the Rose Bowl last Jan. 1.
Bill Young was in the Bulldogs'
hair all day long with hard, solid
tackling. .
Next Saturday it's the little Big
Game— Stanford and California frosh
battling it out in the Stadium while
the varsity travels south to meet
U.S.C.
The scoring:
Frosh 0 0 7 (5—13
San Mateo 0 0 0 7— 7
