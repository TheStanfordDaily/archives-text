HYDE PARK, N.Y., Nov. 2 (UP).
—President Roosevelt tonight put
the entire Coast Guard under juris
diction of the American Navy, con
centrating the nation's power at sea
for the undeclared war that already
is raging in the North Atlantic.
Previously, individual units of the
Coast Guard had been transferred
from Treasury to Navy Department
jurisdiction. But the President's ex
ecutive order tonight transferred all
Coast Guard units and personnel to
the Navy "until further orders."

The Coast Guard said its person
nel includes about 20,000 enlisted
men and 1,700 commissioned and
warrant officers. Its fleet includes
290 ships, exclusive of small craft—
16-foot picket boats and other ships
used only in inshore work. They
pointed out that the number of small
ships fluctuates constantly because
of reserve ships being called to duty.
