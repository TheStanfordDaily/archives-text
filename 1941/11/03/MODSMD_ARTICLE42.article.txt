# Booters Beat Gentlemen From Davis
## 
### 
A smooth passing Stanford eleven
defeated a gentlemanly Cal Aggies
soccer team 4-1 last Saturday on
Maloney Field. The Cal Aggies'
team was composed largely of Cen
tral and South American players
who were not as aggressive as the
Card team.
Fernando Eleta, center forward
for the Indians, scored the first Stan
ford goal from an angle shot from
quite a ways out. Johnny Gertridge
pushed the second tally through af
ter his first shot had bounced off
the goalie.
Gabriel Davalos made the third
(ally for the Indians from right in
front of the card. A1 Wool scored
the fourth and final goal when he
got by the Cal Aggie fullbacks and
brought the ball in alone to punch
it through the unprotected goalie.
The whole Stanford team was
playing much better with smooth
passing and ball handling. Jack Pa
gan, a .sophomore, proved himself
to be a capable halfback in the game.
