# Judgment Day

### 
THE college social fraternity faced Judgment
Day last week-end during the Western Di
visional Interfraternity Conference.
Authorities charged that, at present, the fra
ternity is treading hot water. They said finan
cial distress will canse the fraternal demise.
What these maladies are, is best explained by
outlining the authorities' prescription for finan
cial health:
1. Balance the budget by cutting expenses.
2. Eliminate mortgages.
3. Collect back dues, and new ones promptly.
4. Make a play for graduate students to live
in the house. This means a determined effort to
maintain a much quieter atmosphere than now
obtains, for study seems to be more important
to the graduate than to the undergraduate stu
dent.
"The country faces a lower national standard
of living," in the opinion of Mr. Frank F. Walk
er, Financial Vice-President of Stanford Uni
versity, "which will result in decreased Univer
sity enrollment."
That the fraternities, on the whole, have not
so far made a determined effort to meet these
horizontal black clouds means that they are
not preparing to meet the national emergency
and that they are not laying in stores against
the long winter of reconstruction.
Fraternities are also warned to improve schol
arship and, in rushing, to "abide by the rules
or the rushee will think the fraternity cannot
stand on its own feet." These latter two sug
gestions are those of Dean of Men John Bunn
and Frank Tatum, president of the Stanford
chapter of Zeta Psi.
These suggestions by these men represent
the essence of the invaluable conference.
Stanford, incidentally, had the pleasure of
learning that its deferred rushing system, re
cently deferred again from the middle of au
tumn quarter to winter quarter, is probably the
nearest method possible to perfection.
The success of the conference is due princi
pally to the generalship of Jim Haugh, Stanford
Interfraternity president, who deserves Stan
ford's thanks. The value of the conference is
due to the foresight of those who spoke and
warned. It is to be hoped the fraternities will
take heed of this advice. The responsibility
here, as in most responsibilities, is an individual
one resting not only on the shoulders of chap
ter leaders but on those of each brother.

The problems are known; the solutions are
prescribed. Application of the remedies is all
that remains to be done by Stanford's capably
led fraternities.â€”Harold Shafer
