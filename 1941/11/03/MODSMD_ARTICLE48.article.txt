# To Blame or Not to Blame
## 
### 
RALLY COMMITTEE comes in for a good
share of ribbing all over the campus, in
cluding the columns of The Daily.
Much of this ribbing is deserved. Last week
it was deserved when they canceled the Santa
Clara rally.
But for the failure of last Saturday's card
stunts, it does not seem that they should take
all the blame. It is granted that they could have
explained the new system better, both to the
students and to Rally Committee workers. They
also might have tacked the instruction cards on
the seats and then passed the cards out—men
would have known then who was supposed to
get cards.
But the real reason was that students would
not co-operate. They tore up the cards before
anything could get under way. A few rowdies
in the whole rooting section made it impossible
even to try the stunts.
Maybe we might try out the suggestions of a
bunch of ambitious and disgusted Robleites—
let the women do the stunts and let the men
wave the pompons.
