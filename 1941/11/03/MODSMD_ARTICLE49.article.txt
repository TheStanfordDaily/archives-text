WjpEMEMBER, dear, a frosh in the hand is
Ja. worth six seniors in the army," wrote a
mother recently to her daughter in Roble. When
the world situation worries mothers over the
social futures of our frosh queens, that world
situation must indeed be serious.

Stanford men and women, along with all
young Americans, face a difficult future. The
near future —the next year or two—assumes
grave proportions, as the United States draws
closer to the war.

Already men who were attending classes last
year as members of the Class of '42 are now
marching up and down on parade fields known
only as privates of Company X. Many others
will soon join them. And junior men are only
a jump farther away from the nearest induction
station. Although a victory over Cal seems rela
tively more important than the death struggle
on the bloody fields of Russia, the Stanford man
had best look at the national defense effort and
the role he is to play in it.

The Stanford man should determine the line
of defense in which he will be of most value
and in which he will be happiest to serve.
Army or navy intelligence? Communications?
Air corps? Engineering or medical corps? Pub
lic relations? Ordnance? Or one of the innu
merable other departments offering interesting
duties with good pay. (Unpaid recruitment ad
vertising.)
The Stanford man with the hot breath of the
draft board down his neck should analyze his
gualifications and then investigate the fields
open to him.
To help this Stanford man out, a student de
fense committee is being formed on campus to
collect and disseminate information on service
openings. Already a sizeable amount of mate
rial has been collected, and tomorrow night
Excom will appoint a chairman for the com
mittee.
With this material available, in the library or
a special office, the Stanford "service man" of
tomorrow will be able to find his job and do it
well.—Herman Silverman

WjpEMEMBER, dear, a frosh in the hand is
Ja. worth six seniors in the army," wrote a
mother recently to her daughter in Roble. When
the world situation worries mothers over the
social futures of our frosh queens, that world
situation must indeed be serious.

Stanford men and women, along with all
young Americans, face a difficult future. The
near future —the next year or two—assumes
grave proportions, as the United States draws
closer to the war.

Already men who were attending classes last
year as members of the Class of '42 are now
marching up and down on parade fields known
only as privates of Company X. Many others
will soon join them. And junior men are only
a jump farther away from the nearest induction
station. Although a victory over Cal seems rela
tively more important than the death struggle
on the bloody fields of Russia, the Stanford man
had best look at the national defense effort and
the role he is to play in it.

The Stanford man should determine the line
of defense in which he will be of most value
and in which he will be happiest to serve.
Army or navy intelligence? Communications?
Air corps? Engineering or medical corps? Pub
lic relations? Ordnance? Or one of the innu
merable other departments offering interesting
duties with good pay. (Unpaid recruitment ad
vertising.)
The Stanford man with the hot breath of the
draft board down his neck should analyze his
gualifications and then investigate the fields
open to him.
To help this Stanford man out, a student de
fense committee is being formed on campus to
collect and disseminate information on service
openings. Already a sizeable amount of mate
rial has been collected, and tomorrow night
Excom will appoint a chairman for the com
mittee.
