Twenty contributions in memory
of the late Mrs. Herbert Clayburgh
have swelled to $11,489.50 the Doris
Clayburgh Steiner Endowment Fund
of the Stanford Medical School.
The fund was created in 1939 by
Mr. and Mrs. Clayburgh in honor of
their deceased daughter, Mrs. Stein
er, who graduated from Stanford in
1937. Philip Barth Clayburgh, her
brother, was a member of the Stan
ford ski team and graduated from
the School of Engineering last year.
Mr. and Mrs. Clayburgh have been
frequent donors to the University.
In 1939 Clayburgh established the
Doris Clayburgh Steiner fellowship
for a graduate student in English.
