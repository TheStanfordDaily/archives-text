### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
HALF-WAY MARK

M ID -TERMS are over, the Santa Clara game is over,
a very confused week-end is over, but the rains
keep coming down and time keeps passing and it's
another Monday. And today is the start of the second
half of our autumn quarter, for five weeks have al
ready gone by. The first five weeks were a lot of
fun, but the next five should be even better. Think
of the things that are going to happen. This week we
have the annual pajamarino rally and then everyone
goes down to Los Angeles for the U.S.C. game. Then
back to school for Duke Ellington at the Cotillion
and the Washington State game, and then a rest be
fore Big Game week starts, with all its noise and activ
ity, with the bonfire and the Gaieties and all the
parties. Then the quiet of finals week, and then a
little later on it will be Christmas and home, rested,
full and warm.
But the best thing about it all is that while having
so much fun, most everyone is also learning things.
At least I'm learning things, and anyone that isn't, has
only himself to blame because there's information
lying around all over the place. It's possible to go
through this school, having the fun and going through
the motions of the study pail, but it's foolish, as well
as being very expensive. Right now is the time to
learn, for the chance will never come again, so have
all the fun but take time out to absorb some infor
mation. Both can be done.

JT SEEMS that every tiijie Stanford plays Santa
Clara, the refereeing becomes exceptionally bad.
Last year there were three bad calls against us that
almost caused the still struggling, lucky Indians to
lose the game. This year there were two of them and
both were really senseless. One was a fifteen-yarder
called on Freddy Meyer for clipping after Freddy had
put one of the cleanest, hardest blocks I've ever seen
on Rupe Thornton of the Broncos. The other was on
our All-American, and it to was for clipping. Bill
Leiser of the Chronicle called both, "clean splendid
blocks, well within the rules," but Dutch Conlan called
both of them clipping and in so doing nullified two
beautiful punt returns by Kmetovic. That's the kind
of officiating that ruins the game, for both the specta
tors and players. I should think the officials would
use a little more discretion in calling infractions that
they aren't really sure of.

There were a lot of things that happened at the
game besides the football. One of the best things was
the fight the soldier put up in the Service Section. He
was really a wild man. But even better than that was
our card tricks during the half time. Stanford has al
ways been noted for its clever, original stunts during
the rest period, but the ones this Saturday were the
best of all time.
