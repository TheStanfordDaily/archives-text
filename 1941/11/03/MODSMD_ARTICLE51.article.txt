VICTIMS OF ISOLATIONISM?

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
I was very much interested in Mr. Cheslie
Saroyan's artless confession of a few days back. Evi
dently he was—like most of his generation—the victim
of isolationist propaganda. I was very much alive in
191(i; I can assure Mr. Saroyan that we, the support
ers of Wilson, did lose our heads; we made up our
minds. But America's mind wouldn't stay made up,
and the result is a second world war. Moral: don't
believe everything that your high school teacher tells
you. If teacher says so, it may be so. That goes for
university professors too —I have been one for 35 years.
Yours sincerely,
Lieut. X, A.E.F,

THE QUESTION IS

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
It is irrelevant to discuss the humanitarian aspcets
of feeding starving Europe in accordance with Mr.
Hoover's plan. Both proponents and opponents of the
plan agree on the humanitarian angle. It is likewise
irrelevant to discuss the tragedy of starvation in a
world where there is plenty to eat, or the tragedy
that a man like Hitler exists. Again both sides agree.

The question is merely whether or not in a situa
tion where total war is the order, one side can permit
aid and relief to be given to peoples controlled by the
enemy and thereby relieving the enemy of a lot of
trouble. The question is simple, it is the answer that
is difficult.

I would like to point out one distinction between
the first and second world wars. In the first one, the
war was fought mainly by the armies concerned. In
the present war, whole populations are involved. This
statement is so trite as to fall rather flat and not make
the impression it should in connection with the Hoover
plan. Because of the total aspect of the war the ques
tion to be decided is whether the powers who control
the sea (the U.S. and Britain) can relieve Germany
of the tremendous problem of feeding the population
she controls. Remember the powers arc fit war (or
essentially so). The reasons for feeding Europe are
good, but probably not good enough to outweigh the
reasons for not letting Hitler win the war. Whether
these two sets of reasons have a bearing on each other
is the point at issue.

Opponents of the plan claim that dissatisfaction and
unrest (from starvation) work to Hitler's disadvantage.
The opinion of those favoring the plan is that the
disadvantage is trivial, and therefore feeding under
stringent regulation should be carried out. Even if
we grant that feeding can be suitably handled, we
still have to decide the main question. Let us try to do
so without beclouding the discussion with emotional
argument.
Yours truly,
S. C.
