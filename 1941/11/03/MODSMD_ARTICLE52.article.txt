# MacDonald Teeth Terrify In Saccharine M.G.M. Musical
## 
### 
"SMILIN' THROUGH," now playing at (he Fox-Stanford Theater in
Palo Alto.
The screen at the Fox Theater is fairly drooling with saccharine and
sentiment these days, for M.G.M. has chosen to unearth once again from
its files that tear-jerking opus, "Smilin' Through." Starring Jcanctte

Mac Donald as the wistful little
ghost, Moonyeen, and her more mod
ern niece, Kathleen, the film drags
its weary way, running the gamut
from mush to melodrama in approxi
mately two hours.
In order to suit the characters to
what the studio fondly believes to
be Miss Mac Donald's more obvious
talents, both Moonyeen and Kath
leen are given to warbling sweet old
ballads at the drop of a hat; doubt
less the lady's voice is better than
her histrionic ability, but in out
opinion it's a question of which is
the lesser of two evils. However,
she does as well as can be expected,
and shines her 32 teeth effectively
throughout.
RAYMOND INCOMPETENT
As fiery Jeremy Wayne, and his
son Kenneth—this is confusing, we
admit — rabbity-looking Gene Ray
mond flexes his cheek muscles in
effectually and again proves himself
to be a thoroughly incompetent
actor. Brian Aherne does the best
he can with the part of John Carte
ret, Moonyeen's ever-faithful lover,
looking rather fierce wtih a pair of
over-sized eyebrows. In the role of
the Vicar, lan Hunter is, as always,
very, very understanding.
Great credit is due Natalie Kal
mus for her expert technicolor di
rection; that lady is probably the
most overworked person in Holly
wood. Cedric Gibbons' montages are
beautiful, but even Kalmus and Gib
bons can't make a picture.
SENTIMENTAL SLOP
Frank Borzage's direction is pretty
inept—he could have prevented a
great deal of the over-playing and
sentimental slop that had many of
our disrespectful comrades in the
audience in stitches. In fact, all that
is lacking in "Smilin' Through" is
either Nelson Eddy or Eliza cross
ing the ice—take your choice.

The companion feature is an aw
ful thing about football, called
"Harmon of Michigan," starring poor
Tommy Harmon (of Michigan). Re
member a nice fellow named Hank
Luisetti? He was a good man, and a
magnificent basketball player. Well,
Hollywood got him for just one pic
ture, that was enough. They did the
same thing to Harmon, who from all
indications seems to be a swell guy,
if a lousy actor; now it's good-bye
Tommy. For heavens' sake, Frankie,
don't let them get you, boy.—Liv
