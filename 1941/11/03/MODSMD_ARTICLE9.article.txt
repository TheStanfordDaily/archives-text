Because of the rain yesterday
■tally Committee was tinahlc to
(ack up the cards for (he half
time stunt. The rain would have
ruined the cards, and as you all
know, we can get no more. This
would have meant no stunts for
future games this season.
We attempted to use a system of
passing out cards practiced by
other large west coast universities,

the Stanford s(uden( body.
Admi(tcd there were a few
faults in our procedure, hut with a

have worked.
The atti(udc of the students in
