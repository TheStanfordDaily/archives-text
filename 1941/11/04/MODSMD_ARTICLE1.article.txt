### AMIE REICHERT 
QH Mr. Hitler, Oh Mr. Hitler,
I have a slight request to make
of you.
Three million is my bill,
So now open up that till—
Absolutely, Mr. Hitler;
Positively, Franklin D.
Dh Franklin D., Oh Franklin D.,
I don't have that much ready cash
on hand.
But I'll open an account;
Just you watch the credit mount —
Absolutely, Mr. Hitler?
Positively, Franklin D.

YESTERDAY the U.S. State De
partment warbled an indem
nity across the Atlantic to the Ger
man government to the tunc of $2,-
1)07,092. The bill read, "One Ameri
can merchantman, Robin Moor,
sunk by Nazi submarine, May 16,
1941."
So far the Nazi chorus hasn't
returned anything—hut the sour
notes won't he long in coming. Of
coursc Ilerr Hitler isn't going to
wrap the appropriate amount of
marks with pink ribbon into a
little Bundle for Franklin and drop
it in the letter box.
He will probably have a short
laugh and then return to chewing
his carpet, for he is a little too busy
and too worried at this point to
bother about formalities, and, it
would appear, that is all the collossal
invoice amounts to.
* * *
with the govern
ment's demand for this indem
nity was Secretary of State Hull's
message to the Finnish govei'nment
urging a negotiated peace between
that country and Russia.
Hull revealed that Russia has re
peatedly renewed her offer to end
hostilities since the middle of August
but the Finns have been adamant in
their refusal.
There seems little doubt that
Finland will continue to refuse
for she, like Rumania and Hun
gary, has become a Nazi pawn.
The Finns went into this war orig
inally with the determination to
regain the land they had lost to
Russia in 1939—n0 more, no less.
When Finnish troops reached their
old borders a month or so ago, the
people and the government for the
most part, had had enough. But it
was too late then. The Germans
were standing with a gun in their
backs and they were forced to con
tinue fighting.
Diplomatic quarters in London fol
lowed Hull's statement with the be
lief that Britain will declare war on
Finland should she reject the peace
offers of Russia.
* * *
W/HILE military experts believe
that a B.E.F. to Finland would
not be nearly so troublesome to Hit
ler as a full-sized invasion of the
Continent, there are nevertheless po
litical advantages in such a move.
It is about time the Russians
had some real assurance that
Britain is in this war too, and any
sort of expeditionary force from
England Mould be tremendously
valuable in raising morale and al
laying whatever suspicions they
may have about the integrity of
the British government.
It was rumored all last week that
Wavell's British-Indian army will
come to the aid of the Russians in
the Caucasus when the time comes.
But, obviously the British don't
think that the time has come yet,
for Wavell turned up in Singapore
last week and his army hasn't
scratched yet.

The Germans are not yet with
in reach of the great Baku oil
fields which lie south of the Cau
casian mountain range. However,
they arc threatening the lesser oil
fields of Maikop, and perhaps
Grozny near the Caspian. If the
British have drawn any line at all
as to where they will start shoot
ing, it is obviously north of the
mountains.

W/HILE military experts believe

not be nearly so troublesome to Hit

Continent, there are nevertheless po
litical advantages in such a move.
It is about time the Russians
had some real assurance that
Britain is in this war too, and any
sort of expeditionary force from
England Mould be tremendously
valuable in raising morale and al
laying whatever suspicions they
may have about the integrity of
the British government.
It was rumored all last week that
Wavell's British-Indian army will
come to the aid of the Russians in
the Caucasus when the time comes.
But, obviously the British don't
think that the time has come yet,
for Wavell turned up in Singapore
last week and his army hasn't
scratched yet.

The Germans are not yet with
in reach of the great Baku oil
fields which lie south of the Cau
casian mountain range. However,
they arc threatening the lesser oil
fields of Maikop, and perhaps
Grozny near the Caspian. If the
British have drawn any line at all
as to where they will start shoot
ing, it is obviously north of the
mountains.

with the govern

message to the Finnish govei'nment

that country and Russia.
Hull revealed that Russia has re

hostilities since the middle of August
but the Finns have been adamant in
their refusal.
There seems little doubt that
Finland will continue to refuse
for she, like Rumania and Hun
gary, has become a Nazi pawn.
The Finns went into this war orig
inally with the determination to
regain the land they had lost to
Russia in 1939—n0 more, no less.
When Finnish troops reached their
old borders a month or so ago, the
people and the government for the

was too late then. The Germans
were standing with a gun in their

tinue fighting.

it in the letter box.
He will probably have a short
laugh and then return to chewing
his carpet, for he is a little too busy
and too worried at this point to
bother about formalities, and, it
would appear, that is all the collossal
invoice amounts to.

with the govern
ment's demand for this indem
nity was Secretary of State Hull's
message to the Finnish govei'nment
urging a negotiated peace between
that country and Russia.
Hull revealed that Russia has re
peatedly renewed her offer to end
hostilities since the middle of August
but the Finns have been adamant in
their refusal.
There seems little doubt that
Finland will continue to refuse
for she, like Rumania and Hun
gary, has become a Nazi pawn.
The Finns went into this war orig
inally with the determination to
regain the land they had lost to
Russia in 1939—n0 more, no less.
When Finnish troops reached their
old borders a month or so ago, the
people and the government for the
most part, had had enough. But it
was too late then. The Germans
were standing with a gun in their
backs and they were forced to con
tinue fighting.
Diplomatic quarters in London fol
lowed Hull's statement with the be
lief that Britain will declare war on
Finland should she reject the peace
offers of Russia.

W/HILE military experts believe
that a B.E.F. to Finland would
not be nearly so troublesome to Hit
ler as a full-sized invasion of the
Continent, there are nevertheless po
litical advantages in such a move.
It is about time the Russians
had some real assurance that
Britain is in this war too, and any
sort of expeditionary force from
England Mould be tremendously
valuable in raising morale and al
laying whatever suspicions they
may have about the integrity of
the British government.
It was rumored all last week that
Wavell's British-Indian army will
come to the aid of the Russians in
the Caucasus when the time comes.
But, obviously the British don't
think that the time has come yet,
for Wavell turned up in Singapore
last week and his army hasn't
scratched yet.

The Germans are not yet with
in reach of the great Baku oil
fields which lie south of the Cau
casian mountain range. However,
they arc threatening the lesser oil
fields of Maikop, and perhaps
Grozny near the Caspian. If the
British have drawn any line at all
as to where they will start shoot
ing, it is obviously north of the
mountains.
