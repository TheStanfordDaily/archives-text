SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3 (UP).â€”
American Producers, upon short, no
tice, are delivering 100 octane oil to
embattled Soviet Russia after solv
ing difficult transportation and re
fining problems, W. R. Boyd, Jr.,
president of the American Petro
leum Institute, said today.
The petroleum industry, geared
for British-aid and domestic con
sumption of high-octane aviation
fuel, was forced to speed up produc
tion of 100 octane because of Rus
sia's emergency needs.

"Some of our problems arose be
cause of the unexpected Russian
situation," Boyd said, explaining
that the aid-to-Russia program
placed a new responsibility upon the
American petroleum industry. Boyd
also said there was no shortage of
oil for national defense.
