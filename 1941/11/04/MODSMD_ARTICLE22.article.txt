## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (UP).
The United Strifes today moved to
immobilize Finland as a co-belliger
ent with Germany by warning her
to make peace with Russia or risk
the dual loss of her own security
and American friendship.
The peace offensive was revealed
by Secretary of State Cordell Hull
along with a tersely-phrased, ex
planatory press conference state
ment.

The Finnish legation had no im
mediate comment. Minister Hjalmar
Procope said, however, that Hull's
declaration had been transmitted to
his government.

Hull said that on Aug. 18 the State
Department had conveyed to Pro
cope a Soviet offer to negotiate a
peace under which Finland would
receive territorial concessions.
