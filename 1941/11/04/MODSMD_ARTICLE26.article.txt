I*ii(>lieaiiÂ«tii and distribution (if national literature should he subsidized
by governments or educational foundations according to I)r. Nathan Van
Patten, director of the University libraries. I)r. Van Patten spoke yesterday
afternoon on a short-wave broadcast ro Latin America from the Hoover
War Library. >

"The changes brought about in
the life ol nations by man and na
ture are reflected with clarity in the
national literatures," Dr. Van Pat
ten said. "Translations from the na
tional literatures of the American
states must be made available for a
limited number of readers."

The Mexican government has pio
neered in the translation and distri
bution of foreign literature for use
in its schools and libraries accord
ing to Dr. Van Patten.

"Rational, action in the economic
and political fields is impossible be
tween nations unless our leaders
base such actions upon the firm
ground of mutual esteem and under
standing," Dr. Van Patten stated.

In his opinion this understanding
between nations must be accom
plished through an exchange of na
tional art, music, dance, and litera
ture.

"Nations should jealously guard
their national cultures," Dr. Van Pat
ten said. "It is not desirable that the

peoples of the Americas should come
to ihink, to act, and to look alike.
What we should seek is not sameness
but understanding and appreciation
of differences."

American nations should lose no
time in making the great books of
every nationality available to read
ers throughout the hemisphere. It
is the cultural relationship and un
derstanding that will eventually cre
ate the community of nations, con
cluded Dr. Van Patten.
