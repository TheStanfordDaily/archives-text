# Government Priorities Worry Stanford's Foundry Director
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
What looks like "fun for the kiddies" in Stanford's foundry is actually
practice in (lie fundamentals of technology's basic industry, casting.
To a casual visitor the foundry's salient feature is a heap of black sand
on the floor, in which future engineers are making molds for the casting
process. Closer inspection reveals an electric arc furnace in one corner

and a coke furnace for heating the,
metals; at one end of the big room
is the office where Mr. Wilmer
Young, director, worries over his or
ders of metals at which the govern
ment has first crack.
"We can still get enough pig iron
and steel plate," the director said
yesterday, "but we will have more
and more trouble getting these
things as time goes by, and it is al
most impossible to get copper any
more."
FARM GRADUATE
Mr. Young was graduated from
Stanford in 1923 in mechanical en
gineering and he has specialized in
foundry at Stanford for ten years.
"Before the advent of foundry
work, industry was based on forge,"
he explained. "Casting is now the
foundation for most of our big ma
chines, from locomotives to lathes,
and is the fundamental operation in
our heavy industry."

After listening to the foundry di
rector, it was not hard to see that
in these days, when heavy machin
ery is coming more and more into
the limelight, foundry casting is of
vital importance.

FOUNDRY IS BASK

"The significance of foundry's po
sition lies in the fact that it is the
basic industry of all heavy indus
try," said Mr. Young. "From the
foundry come locomotive frames,
engine blocks, and most of the
foundations of heavy machinery."
The purpose of these courses at.
Stanford is not to turn out finished
experts in the work, but to give en
i gineering students an idea of the

| problems that have to be overcome
|in the foundry. In their designing
j work later on they will know what
jto look out for in casting if they
| have had some actual experience in
the shop.
