COMMITTEE COLLECTS

another group of women will can

tions. There is also a resident com
mittee worker in each living group
in order to give every Stanford
student a chance to contribute to
the Red Cross, said Chairman Paul
son.
Collection boxes have been placed
in strategic spots on the campus
and drive heads have suggested that
students forego a few cokes or cig
arettes and put their spare change
in these boxes.
GOAL IS $1150
The goal for this year's Red Cross
Drive at Stanford has been set at
$1150 and committee workers will
collect contributions until Friday
afternoon of this week.
The Red Cross, according to Miss
Paulson, is now offering the stu
dents of Stanford another opportu
nity to aid in war work. A "Knitz
krieg" has been established on the
third floor of the Women's Club
house, where students may get yarn
and instructions for knitting sweat
ers for America's new army. She
added that a hundred sweaters and
other knitted garments are needed
by Christmas and she urged that
Stanford women answer this call.
