### DON SELBY 
the number of persons who are deciding that they won't tr«k
southward for the U.S.C.-Stanford game this week-end, one would
think that Sam Barry's men from Troy had already given up the ghost
and conceded the game to the Indians. .
Naturally, Stanford is going to be an overwhelming favorite. But
even though Barry said after last Saturday's Card-Bronco game that
Clark Shaughncssy's present team is better than the Rose Bowl kings
of 1940, the new S.C. mentor isn't preparing his boys this week in how
to take a loss graciously.
Barry undoubtedly had a few thoughts in his noodle when he went
home after the game, which, of course, doesn't tell anyone anything about
which team is going to win. But, after all, this is still football they're play
ing, and the way things have been going in this increasingly screwy Pacific
Coast Conference, there's no guarantee whatsoever that the Troians won't

tip and scalp the Indians Saturday.
It's not that we're expecting Stan
ford to lose, but rather that it's ter
rible to see—or think you see —Stan-
ford's student body getting that old
complacent attitude, thinking that
all Shaughnessy's lads have to do to
win a game is to walk out on the
field.
When we talked to "Elevator
Sam" Barry this past summer,
U.S.C.'s new hucukiuin predicted
that Stanford would come out on
top again this year, said that the
Trojans would be much better in
'12 than in '41, and opined that his
boys would do some upsetting be
fore the season was over.
A victory over Stanford would
make any team have a successful
season, and U.S.C. is no exception.
The Trojans will be digging hard
against the Indians. So don't you
think it might be a good game after
all?

'J'HE play of Randall Fawcett Sat
urday was certainly encourag
ing. Ever since early season, and
especially after Eric Armstrong was
injured, the coaching staff has been

working like the very dickens with Fawcett. Gradually, very gradually,
lie improved. The Bronc game was the pay-off: the Los Banos flash per
formed well on all his assignments.
Of course, the running he did received most of the attention, for
il was spectacular, br.t if you watched him closely, you noticed that
he also turned in a much better brand of ball on defense and on his
decoying assignments.
From now on, he'll be much more effective as the man in motion, for
now the opposing coaches will have instructed their players to watch him
closely, which means that other holes will be open.
That's the way this T formation attack works. If the defense plays for
any single player, or even any two players, Quarterback Frank Albert
has both the players and the plays to shoot something unexpected.
And as the season weax - s on, the number of men who are distinct
threats to the defense is increasing. At first it was only Albert's passing
and Pete Kmetovic's running. Then Milt Vucinich began to show the
stufl that made him the leader of Lowell's "Gems of the Generation"
eleven in his high school career. Armstrong improved; Will Sheller gave
evidence that he is a great power back; and now Fawcett comes through.
Don't be surprised if, before the season has been completed. Shaughnessy
has a couple of more men playing in the backfield who can be labeled
as real threats.

p'OR A GOOD morning quarterback session on Monday morning,
just drop around to Eddie Twiggs' golf class on the practice fairway
on the Stanford course.
We always knew that Eddie knew an awful lot about golf—as his
teams' records show—but each week our esteem for tlie little man with
impeccable taste for clothes as an astute football observer increases.
Quite often a student in Twiggs' golf class has been Clayton Frye,
Stanford's handsome boxing coach. Maybe Frye reciprocates by giving
Eddie lessons in how to handle his dukes when a nearby fan for the oppo
sition gets too excited during the football games.

J JESPITE the ups and downs of the football season on the west coast,
Luckie Louie appears to be doing fairly well these days.
He must be particularly proud of his pick of Cal over Ucla, which,
they say, was an upset. The week-end results gave Louie an .857 avei'age
for seven picks. W.S.C.'s unexpected win over the University of Oregon
was the only one missed by the Pixley picker.

BOUQUETS TO BURNETT

For more than a week, we've been trying to find space to congratulate
Bobby Burnett for his work in having the final play-off game for the
intramural football championship played in the stadium.
Being as busy as he is with frosh basketball practice, Burnett might
well just ease through with this intramural managership. But he doesn't.
He works, and works hard. And the results are apparent, for this has
been, is, and will probably continue to be the best organized mural
program we've seen here at Stanford.
The schedule is always on time; the officials almost always show up
to work the games; and there have been a minimum of forfeits.
By having the game played in the stadium a great deal more in
terest will be attached to winning the mural crown, which, inci
dentally, will probably go to Monte Pfyl and his Firehouse hoys for
the third consecutive year. Then, too, rather than just have the teams
leave the stadium after their game with many of the spectators not
knowing just what they were watching, Burnett has arranged for the
trophy presentation to be made right 011 the field, with the aid of
Don Liebendorfer on the public address system.
The whole thing shows good thought, co-operation, and lots of work.
Speaking of basketball, as we were several paragraphs above, Everett
Dean should turn up with another smooth quintet again this season. Stan
ford basketball teams, since Dean has been here, have been good outfits
to watch, for theirs is not a game of individual brilliance but rather a
game of team play.
With last year's co-captains, Don Williams and Kenny Davidson, gone,
and Fordy Anderson taken by the draft, the Farm hoopsters are a team
which has yet to prove itself. Veterans Don Burness and Bill Cowden are,
however, back for another year and with boys like Linari, Voss, Eichleman,
Pollard, and Oliver back Dean need not worry too much.
