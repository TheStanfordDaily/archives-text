# LEAGUE SUMMARY
## 
### 
Tonight at 7:15 representatives of
the ten winning teams will meet
intramural manager Bob Burnett in
the B.A.C. building to draw up
brackets for the final playoffs.
The Firehouse has developed the
ground attack of the league, based
upon blocking plus. Add to this
the passing, running, and defensive
play of such gridders as the Pfyl
brothers, George Kaufman, and Wy
land Cripe, and it spells something
very near another blaze-chaser's
crown.
There is growing feeling that the
team that may stop the siren-wind
ers is Frank Wells' hot and cold out
fit from Kappa Sigma. When they
are hot they are very, very hot.. .ask
any Phi Delt, Delt, Sigma Chi, or
Capitan.

Business School has the money
team of the league, giant-killing
such pre-season favorites as Delta
Chi and Zeta Psi in their regular
round. Bill Tweedie can really pass
if amply protected.
Breakers, as mentioned, have
Bruce Clark, and on many days a
good blocking set-up to spring him.
Alpha Delt has a 0-to-0 deadlock
to settle, and Toro must dump the
Japanese Club today before the pic
ture is entirely cleared up. Besides
those mentioned, strong Sequoia and
Deke teams complicate the picture.
The whole season has been one of
upsets, and the finals will probably
similar. But...have you watched
the Firehouse practice?
