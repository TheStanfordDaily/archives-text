# Papeese Prep For Cub Game
## 
### 
Next Saturday afternoon the
frosh gridders will take over the
Stanford football spotlight when
they meet the Cal frosh in the an
nual Little Big Game in the stadium
while the varsity journeys south to
play U.S.C.

In their first day of practice pre
paratory to encountering the Cubs,
the Indians were faced with a quag
mire on which to work out. How
ever, this did not daunt them as
Coach Harry Shipkey put them
through a general offensive drill.

The team representing Cal's class
of '45 has gone undefeated so far
this year, holding victories over
strong jaysee aggregations as well
as a service team.

This should not scare the Papooses,
however, after their convincing win
over San Mateo J.C.'s previously un
beaten squad in last Saturday's fore
runner to the Card-Bronc game.
After last Saturday's game the
Berkeley freshmen will have no of
fensive star to concentrate their de
fense against, since Zappettini, Pate,
and Parsons blossomed out to take
places along with Pettit, Parkinson,
and Andrews as backfield threats
worth watching.
The Cubs will be out for revenge
this year for the one-point defeat
they suffered last year when Jim
Ellis, who has been Athertonized
since then, kicked the try for point
through the uprights for a 7-6 win
for the Farm.
