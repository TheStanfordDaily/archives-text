# LOUIS' CROWN SECURE
## 
### 
Jack Johnson, 64-year-old vet
eran and one-time champion prize
fighter of the world, while matching
his 22-year-old negro fighter Leo
Ross in Los Angeles today, made the
statement that Joe Louis will never
lose his title as long as he fights such
weak contenders. Johnson said that
many old-time "champs" would have
out-boxed Louis for the title.
