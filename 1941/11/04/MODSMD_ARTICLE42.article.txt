# A 						Mid-Quarter Suggestion
## 
### 
The time is growing so short in
which to have really nice pic
tures made for Christmas. This
is a suggestion that you make
an effort to come to the Max
ine Kellogg Studio within the
next few weeks so, that you
will have them finished before
finals. We will then have
plenty of time to make some
thing lovely for youâ€”some
thing your parents and friends
will enjoy while you are away
from home.
We never take more orders
than we can finish perfectly;
so that we can accommodate
more students, we suggest you
call P.A. 21894 soon, for an
ippointmcnt.
