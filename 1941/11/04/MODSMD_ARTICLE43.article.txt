# Red Machine Looks Good In Wet Drill

Stanford worked out in the slop
yesterday with Coach Clark Sliaugh
nessy telling his Indians what to do
about U.S.C.
The first two units worked on
power plays, and yesterday's prac
tice session would indicate that the
Trojan center line is going to get a
thorough pounding down at L.A.
this week-end. A full squad of
something like 60 men will be taken
south for the U.S.C. game, a good
reward for the "Blacks" and other
reserves which have been pushing
the varsity along and taking quite a
lot of pounding all season.
It was dark and wet out on the
practice field yesterday. Bruno
Banducci was out for a short lime
and will gradually take up his work
at tackle. Meanwhile Ed McCain is
doing a bang-up job in the line.
Chuck Taylor, whose great sub
marining Saturday tore up the Santa
Clara line, took a day's rest. He is
probably the scrappiest player in
football, and just about kills him
self at the center of Stanford's line.
Eric (Hoot) Armstrong was huddled
under a blanket watching the work
out. He's favoring a charley-horsed
right leg.
