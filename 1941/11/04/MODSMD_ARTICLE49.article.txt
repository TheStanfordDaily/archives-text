# Prices: On the Fence
## 
### 
WASHINGTON has been sitting, like a mug
wump, on the price control legislation
fence for some two months or more, with its
mug on one side of the fence and . . .
The House Banking and Currency Committee
approved an amended version of the original
control bill Saturday. This action, in turn, pre
cipitated a charge by some government econo
mists that this new version of the measure is
inflationary.

President Roosevelt's return to the capital
from Hyde Park tomorrow may signal the start
of a fight to restore the original Administration
bill.

Meanwhile, time passes, and we go 'round
and 'round, mugging and wumping.
Canada has already invoked a measure freez
ing prices, wages and rents, and is now watch
ing American prices closely, fearing an im
pending inflationary spiral.

Inflation is very likely to pour forth from the
lake of war-time defense efforts and flood the
nation, unless a precautionary dam is erected
to peg prices—and promptly, Administration
leaders warn.

Right now the bill is bogged down in the
House in a dispute over farm prices. Commit
tee revision would ban imposition of ceilings
on farm commodities at a level lower than the
general price level of the 1919-1929 decade.
Government economists say the provision
would permit food costs to skyrocket and would
defeat the bill's primary purpose—to avert in
flation.

'The House is currently enjoying an official
vacation—and will not consider the measure
until next week. Observers believe Mr. Roose
velt will have to exert extreme pressure to bring
Speaker Sam Rayburn, his number one House
spokesman, into line against the committee's
farm clause, since Rayburn represents a strictly
agricultural Texas district. The farm bloc consti
tutes about the strongest pressure group in the
Capitol and has, on occasion, passed farm-aid
legislation even over the President's veto.
Simply, that seems to be the picture of the
present state of price-control efforts, and it
seems to be the reason why Washington is rid
ing the merry-go-round, why today we have no
price dyke in our defense effort.
Perhaps prospects for action will be enhanced
if labor, farm groups, consumers and taxpayers
have the assurance that profits will be con
trolled as well as prices and wages. Whether
the United States can get the defense supplies
it needs if the profit incentive is lessened re
mains to be seen. The soldier risks his life with
out thought of profit; we hope, in this period of
American danger, the loyalty of the business
man can be counted upon.

Time is precious in the fight to squelch Hitler.
So far this year, Congress has appropriated
nearly $13,000,000,000 for guns, tanks, planes,
food and other materials to accomplish the na
tional purpose.

We are out 13 billion dollars in less than one
year; this is costly, yes, but our defense ex
ertions are likely to become even costlier to
our national economy if we continue to sit on
the do-nothing fence or on the compromise
fence.—Harold Shafer
