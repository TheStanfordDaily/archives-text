# It's a Treatâ€”"Dutch"
## 
### 
DESPITE the Bull Sessioner's dissertation on
the equality of men and women in this
morning's column, it is pretty certain that the
old situation will not change radically as a gen
eral rule.
Most women will go on being squired around
depleting men's pocketbooks on date after
date.
And, believe it or not, some men do not agree
with the idea that the women should pay their
share, although we can't quite agree with them.
But there is one night (besides the Sadie Haw
kins Hop) when the women have their chance,
when tradition decrees they should share in
footing the damages.

That is Big Game night.
And for the benefit of new Stanfordites, the
damages can really reach the astronomical
figures.
That is why Big Game night has traditionally
been "dutch" on the Farm.
There have been many plans devised to make
this idea work. Some prefer the penny bank
system. Both save all their pennies and dimes
for some weeks ahead. It's almost too late to
start that now. Others, mainly the women who
don t like to assert their independence in pub
lic, just slip their dates a check before the eve
ning begins.
But, whatever the means to achieve the end,
Big Game night "dutch" is one tradition that
should not be allowed to die.
