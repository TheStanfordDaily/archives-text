WELL, Rally Committee, let's just sit down
md talk things over. You told us yester
day the rain prevented you from tacking up the
cards for the half-time card stunts in the rooting
section. The rain would have ruined the cards,
and so they had to be passed out to rooters.
"We attempted to use a system of passing out
cards practiced by other large West Coast uni
versities, but apparently this is unsuited to the
Stanford student body," you say.
Sure, the other schools pass out the cards,
but they tack up the instruction cards on the
seats preceding the game. Maybe we could do
that, too. We know a man who sat in seat 9 of
his row, and received an instruction card for
seat 26.

You can't blame the students for not being
able to straighten out this mess. About the only
way we can think of, that would have worked
without the instructions already tacked up,
would be to commission Superman, send "him
aloft and tell him to let fall the instructions and
cards, each in its right place.
Incidentally, there is the matter of holding
a rally prior to the U.S.F. pushover, and then
none for the Santa Clara game which, preceding
the tilt, was a crucial.
But, getting back to the subject, you say:
"The attitude of the students in refusing to
co-operate by tearing and throwing cards is a
typical example of mass adolescent anarchy."
Then you ask, "Is the Stanford spirit a myth?"
So we're anarchists? So we have no Stanford
spirit? Horsefeathers!â€”Harold Shafer
