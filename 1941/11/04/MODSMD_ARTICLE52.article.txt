### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
MARGARET SHOULD PAY

POR years now women have been asserting them
selves. From the obscure position they once held,
they have pushed and fought and scratched their way
out of the kitchen, until they are now the equals of
men. Girls are allowed to go to school, they vote, they
enter all professions and can be found in almost any
of the activities that men are in.

And as their rights and freedoms increased, so also
increased their feeling of independence of man. For
once out in the world, the girl worked, made money,
met people, faced situations and in so doing acquired
a lot of strength and lost her dependence on men.
And this idea of independence and equality has gotten
over to the women that didn't leave the home, and
didn't go out into the world. They too claim equality
and freedom. And like in all other places, at Stanford
there no longer exists the romantic idea that women
are weak and men are strong and women need men
to protect them and lead them about. Women are
equals of men, and perfectly capable of caring for
themselves and if anyone doesn't believe this, just ask
some of the girls you know.

COURSE this equality is not wrong. If women
want it that way, that is their right. They should
be allowed to have all the freedoms and advantages of
men. But if women are going to be free and equal
and strong, I can't understand why when a man and a
girl go to a show or a dance or to dinner or to a
play, it is the man who has to always say "two" and
pay for his equally intelligent, equally strong, his
very independent friend. There's something wholly in
consistent and expensive about the whole arrangement.

IYJOST women now have as much money as men do,
and at Stanford that is especially true. Most
women enjoy eating just as much as men do. Most
women laugh at a funny movie as loudly as men do,
and most women are as sad as men at a tragic play.
Most women enjoy dancing as much as men do, and
most women enjoy being out with a man as much as
a man enjoys being out with a woman. In other words,
both get an equal amount of pleasure out of an eve
ning spent together, and the girl isn't doing anyone a
special favor by accepting an invitation, and I think
that it is only practical and right that the girl pay
for half of the evening.

And if anyone thinks there is any particular pleas
ure connected with asking father for more money so
that the man can pay for the girl, I would be very
happy to go out and let the girl pay for the whole
evening and let the girl have all the pleasure.
