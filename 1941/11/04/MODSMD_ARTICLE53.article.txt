ROBLEITES' REPRIMAND

ARE WE DANGEROUS?

r £ I HE EDITOR, SIR:
It is regrettable that any Stanford students arc
capable of such stupidity as was exhibited at last Sat
urday's game. The destruction of cards, refusal to
try to co-operate with the Rally Committee which
had worked on the card stunts was not in the Stanford
spirit as we freshmen have seen it before this.
Even though the directions, because of the rains,
had not been made clear as they had been for previous
card stunts, the adolescent attitude taken was not in
keeping with the spirit which has been impressed upon
us, and more such demonstrations will result in the
destruction of the reputation which is our responsi
bility to uphold.

story on the front page will carry a reprimand from
our President for rotten rooting section spirit.

r | , IIE EDITOR, SIR:
It is interesting to note that an Englishwoman who
is not a pacifist can write, "A year hence it may seem
to most English people that England's friends in the
United States were more dangerous to her than those
Americans called isolationists."
The quotation is from an article by Freda Utley in
the October Reader's Digest, originally appearing in
August Common Sense, "Must the World Destroy It
self?"
While we in America are fearful of being called
"appeasers," she states, "In England forums of intelli
gent citizens debate the terms of the eventual com
promise peace."
Her quotation from Lord Lothian seems to me to
sum up the situation, "The lesson of the last war is
that we get neither democracy, nor liberty, nor peace
out of a world war, however noble the end for which
it is fought."
Sincerely yours,
Elsie R. Renne
