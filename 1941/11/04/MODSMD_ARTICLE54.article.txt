# Van Doren Tells Stories Of Revolutionary Intrigue
## 
### 
"SECRET HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION," by Carl
Van Doren. Published by the Viking Press.
Living as we do in a world of suspicion and intrigue we are apt to
envy the comparative ease of mind which our forefathers seem to have
possessed. It is interesting, therefore, when scholarly Carl Van Doren tells

the story of underground plotting
and planning during the American
Revolution that compares favorably
with the fifth-column yarns of to
day.
Dug from the voluminous collec
tion of William L. Clement of Eng
lish and German headquarters pa
pers, the book deals mainly with
the conspiracy of Benedict Arnold,
America's number one traitor.
Fully half of the book is concerned
with this notorious character, and
the methods employed in gaining
his co-operation. This is probably
the first time that such a complete
account of this episode in American
history has been compiled, and it
seems so accurate that it is doubtful
whether any added material could
be unearthed that could add much
more in detail.
ARNOLD BRIBE
The bickering over the amount of
Arnold's bribe, and the numerous
other complicating forces give full
testimony to the delicacy of the Eng
lishmen's task. This type of sabotage
activity has undoubtedly gone by
the board, for it is difficult to vis
ualize the German army awaiting
the decision of a traitor's wife, as
was the case with Arnold.
The remaining half of the book
deals with the case against this coun
try's lesser traitors, Generals Put
nam, Schuyler, Sullivan, etc.
TREND OF TIMES
Notably a book that is in the gen
eral swing of the "book world"—
that of publishing the crimes of the
German nation, both past and pres
ent; the book nevertheless is im
portant in that it completes a string
of documentary evidence on the
secret methods employed in the
Revolutionary War.
The volume contains many quotes,
but the brilliant composition of Van
Doren weaves it into a fascinating
tale which runs with novel-like
smoothness.—Mull

Living as we do in a world of suspicion and intrigue we are apt to
envy the comparative ease of mind which our forefathers seem to have
possessed. It is interesting, therefore, when scholarly Carl Van Doren tells

the story of underground plotting
and planning during the American
Revolution that compares favorably
with the fifth-column yarns of to
day.
Dug from the voluminous collec
tion of William L. Clement of Eng
lish and German headquarters pa
pers, the book deals mainly with
the conspiracy of Benedict Arnold,
America's number one traitor.
Fully half of the book is concerned
with this notorious character, and
the methods employed in gaining
his co-operation. This is probably
the first time that such a complete
account of this episode in American
history has been compiled, and it
seems so accurate that it is doubtful
whether any added material could
be unearthed that could add much
more in detail.
ARNOLD BRIBE
The bickering over the amount of
Arnold's bribe, and the numerous
other complicating forces give full
testimony to the delicacy of the Eng
lishmen's task. This type of sabotage
activity has undoubtedly gone by
the board, for it is difficult to vis
ualize the German army awaiting
the decision of a traitor's wife, as
was the case with Arnold.
The remaining half of the book
deals with the case against this coun
try's lesser traitors, Generals Put
nam, Schuyler, Sullivan, etc.
TREND OF TIMES
Notably a book that is in the gen
eral swing of the "book world"—
that of publishing the crimes of the
German nation, both past and pres
ent; the book nevertheless is im
portant in that it completes a string
of documentary evidence on the
secret methods employed in the
Revolutionary War.
The volume contains many quotes,
but the brilliant composition of Van
Doren weaves it into a fascinating
tale which runs with novel-like
smoothness.—Mull
