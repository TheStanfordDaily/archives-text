# Farm Women Entertain Army
## 
### 
Sunday evening, taking advantage
of an opportunity to help out the
U. 5.0., the Tri Delt house enter
tained a group of Moffett Field men
with supper, bridge, ping-pong,
dancing and singing. At 9:30 the
girls drove the men back and re
turned to campus before 10:30 lock
outs.
A sudden influx of plans for simi
lar events from other carnpUs wom
en has caused Women's Conference
to sponsor a central co-ordinating
council to help in making and carry
ing out arrangements with army
units. In the framework for enter
taining the service men, drawn up
by the committee, emphasis is laid
on the purpose of these functions
which are "not only to provide en
joyment of the company of men and
women but especially to provide
entertainment for service men."
RULES SPECIFIED
Rules also specify that the director
or house mother of the living group
must be included in all plans for the
function, and must be present at the
function.
Since it is the official connecting
link between Moffett Field, the
U.S.O. and Stanford, the Co-ordi
nating Committee would like to
have all arrangements for contact
ing the men made through it. How
ever, if an individual, known by a
girl in the living group, could be
contacted personally all invitations
could be arranged through him.
All dates and plans are to be
cleared through the co-ordinating
committee before the invitations are
issued. Recommendations will be
made by the committee. Reports
of the functions and suggestions for
the future will be turned in to it by
the living groups.

Hannibal, president of Women's
Conference; B. J. Binney, president

Of particular importance to cam
pus women going south for the game
this week-end are the University of
Southern California social rules, an
nounced by Miss Hannibal at the
meeting of Women's Conference yes
terday afternoon. Since Stanford

women who plan to stay on the
U.S.C. campus must abide by these
rules, and since any infractions will
be reported to the Stanford Council
and dealt with as regular violations,
Miss Hannibal made a special re
quest that the girls read and become
familiar with them.
