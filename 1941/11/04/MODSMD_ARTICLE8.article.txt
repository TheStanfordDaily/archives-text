# Stanford Radio Station Now Being Considered
## Faculty to Give Final Decision 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Stanford may soon have a radio
station of its own.
Plans for a radio system, broad
casting exclusively on campus, will
be presented this week to the Stan
ford Radio Committee, composed of
faculty members.
The plans, however, are past the
paper stage, as experiments on trans
mission of broadcasts over the cam
pus steam heating system were suc
cessfully conducted last week, ac
cording to A1 Armour, spokesman
for the five Stanford men promoting
the project.
These five include Howie Ledeen,
Cortlandt Van Rensselaer, Paul
Wolf, Kiyo 1 omiyasu, and Armour.
UNLIKE MOST STATIONS
The proposed radio station will
be unlike regular commercial sta
tions in that it will broadcast over
the steam heating lines throughout
campus. Such a station is not under
the jurisdiction of any governmental
regulation as long as the frequencies
do not radiate beyond 250 feet of
the steam lines.
Programs from a campus studio
will be broadcast over a regular
transmitter. The radio frequency
output will be connected to the steam
pipe.
PIPES EVERYWHERE
Pipes from the steam healing sys
tem penetrate every corner of the
campus, running into practically ev
ery building except a few fraternity
houses.
Any radio within 250 feet of a
steam pipe will be able to pick up
the Stanford station, which will
broadcast four or five hours each
day—just before dinner and in the
evening.
A blank spot on the radio dial will
be selected to place the station. Al
though the transmitter to be used
can radiate as much as 10 watts,
only 2 or 3 watts will be employed.
TEST PROGRAMS
Ten days ago test programs were
broadcast from the Corporation Yard.
Portable radios picked up the tests
throughout the campus, in buildings
and on the outside. The experi
menters report the reception was
excellent.
