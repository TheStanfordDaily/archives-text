# Card Checking Will Continue
## 
### 
Checking of tickets at the coming
football games will definitely be
continued, according to a report re
ceived yesterday from the B.A.C.
Gene Coldiron, head of the ticket
checkers, in answer to the numer
ous protests concerning the way the
student body cards were checked at
the Santa Clara game, said the dras
tic measure was taken because sev
eral of the checkers knew students
were loaning their cards and wanted
some way to stop the offenders.
Last Saturday most students were
asked by the checkers to present
identification with their student body
cards. This is the first time this
football season such a method has
been used.
According to Coldiron, 48 student
body cards were taken at the stu
dent gate. This makes a total of 78
cards taken for the season. They can
be redeemed at the B.A.C. on pay
ment of $2.
