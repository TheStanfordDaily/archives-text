### AMIE REICHERT 
r jpilE Japanese are a small people.
Like all small people, they talk
big. They are persistent and there
fore a nuisance. They want to ex
pand. But they know they are not
really strong enough to do this all
alone. So they continue to talk big
and be persistent and be a nuisance.
Furthermore, they try very hard.
They get an "A" for effort.
The Japanese always want the last
word. They make quite sure that
they are having the last word be
cause every time they say anything
at nil they preface it with "this is
the last word."
That has happened often. Then
people expect them to be quiet and
maybe start shooting. But they are
foxy, the Japanese are. They look
around a little more, ponder the
strength of the American-British-
Netherlands Indies coalition, and
(hey decide not to shoot. Miracu
lously they regain speech, and
they become quite articulate.
They make threats, they reshuffle
iheir cabinet, they polish up their
sailboats — all the while talking.
"This is the last word," they say.
"Now we will start making things
hot for the United States," they say.

B UT they never do. Some day, of
course, they will—unless Adolf
Hitler is exterminated while they
are still talking. But so far all they
have been doing is send out false
alarms—at least where the United
States is concerned.
Yesterday they came forth with a
dilly. The Times - Advertser in
Tokio, which is the English lan
guage newspaper mouthpiece of the
Foreign Office, presented a seven
point program for maintaining
friendly relations between Japan
and the U.S. with a neat little warn
ing tacked on.
The seven points:
1. Discontinuance of U.S. and
other military aid to China.
2. Leave China free to deal with
Japan, end hostilities, and estab
lish economic collaboration.
3. Encourage China to make
peace with Japan.
4. Acknowledge Japan's co
prosperity sphere and her leader
ship in the Western Pacific.
5. Recognition of Manchukuo by
the U.S.
(». Lifting of orders freezing
Japanese assets.
7. Negotiate a new Japanese-
American trade treaty.
The warning was that if we don't
hustle and do all these things right
away we will give the Japanese
Diet—which meets next week—acute
indigestion ancl the members will
probably adopt a "defensive pro
gram" (the quotes are Tokio's).

over Japan's next
k move has been runing the gamut
for the past week. One reads just as
much prophesy for a northward
movement as for a southward one.
Judging from the stress laid on
the China war in the seven points,
it would seem apparent that the
Japanese themselves admit that
they can't do much on a large
scale until that little mess is mop
ped lip.
However, as long as the U.S. con
tinues aid to China along with
maintaining a stringent economic
blockade, the Japanese can't make
much headway in that department.
They are committed to a policy of
expansion, but they haven't the nec
essary raw materials—chiefly oil—to
wage any kind of a big war success
fully.

pressing shortage is one of
the prime motivating factors be
hind Japan's big talk. And there is
oil to the south of Japan—in Su
matra and the Netherlands Indies.
On the other hand, a Japanese
invasion of Siberia might prove a
simpler stunt because the Rus
sians have their hacks turned at
the moment, and the chances are
stronger that Britain and the U.S.
would not move against Japan in
this event, as they would almost
surely do if she attacked in the
south.
The seven - point warning is no
more nor less dire than similar pro
nunciamentos emanating from the
Japanese capital in the last months.
It is probably just another "last
word."
