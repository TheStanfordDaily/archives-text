Spotlighted by the lights of hun
dreds of cars, some five hundred
members of the Class of 15)45 will
parade down the famed Stanford
Row tomorrow night as a prelude
to the annual Pajamarino rally.
Freshmen, clad in their traditional
pajamas, are asked by Rally Chair
men Mickey Levee and Pi Thornton
to gather at the Fiji house promptly
at 7:15, so the rally can start at
7:30, so the football players can en
train promptly for southern Cali
fornia at 8:40.
Following tradition, all freshman
men will sit on the floor throughout,
the rally. After the rally, they will
parade to Roblc to serenade the
freshman belles who traditionally
have arrived there first. The men
wind up the night by attending a
free movie at, the Varsity Theater.
All members of the Row "motored
aristocracy" are asked to turn their
cars facing the Row with their
lights on to light the parade.
