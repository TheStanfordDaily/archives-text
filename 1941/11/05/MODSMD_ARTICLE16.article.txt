# Chi Psis Fined For Infraction Of Rush Rules
## Council Promises More Severe Move For Later Violations 
### 
Illegal rushing last night cost the
Chi Psi house an immediate fine of
$25 and a suspended sentence
amounting to jeopardization of rush
ing privileges in case of further in
fractions.
Punitive action was slapped on
the Chi Psi's for direct violation of
rush regulations—ofT-campus con
tact of one freshman by three house
members—by Inter fraternity Board
of Control, meeting at the Alpha
Delt house.
MORE SEVERE
The Board went on record as stat
ing any infraction of any nature will
from now on be dealt with severely.
"Tonight's action represents the
taking up of the slack in rushing
rule enforcement, which has been so
definitely needed for so long around
here," declared Frank "Sandy" Ta
tum, Board rushing committee chair
man and president of the Zete house,
following the meeting.
CO-OPERATION NEEDED
Interfraternity President Jim
Haugh said:
"We particularly need co-opera
tion (of individual houses) this year
because we are introducing the plan
of winter quarter rushing."
This is known as the defered
rushing system, which this year has
been strengthened by defering rush
ing inauguration from the middle of
autumn quarter to winter quarter,
FROSH TO BE RESPONSIBLE
The freshman involved in last
night's case was not held responsible,
but freshmen connected with illegal
rushing in the future will be subject
to penalty, Haugh explained.
He charged the fraternities with
being ignorant of the rules, and
urged them to become familiar with
them. (Editor's note: See editorial,
"No Bliss in this Ignorance,'* page 4.)
Haugh and Tatum will release a
statement in Thursday's Daily.
