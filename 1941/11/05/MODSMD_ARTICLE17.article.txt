# Rosten Speaks On Movie Myth
## 
### 
Declaring that Hollywood is the
last frontier of American society,
Leo C. Rosten, who spoke in Me
morial Auditorium last night for the
Tuesday Evening Series on "The
Hollywood Legend," said that to the
public the movie capital represents
the fantasy of Cinderella stories.
In a society in which economic
bonds are becoming tighter, when
there are thousands of millions un
employed for many years, and, at
the same time, people are becoming
rich overnight for no apparent rea
son other than luck, it is difficult
for the average American not to
think the same luck might bring
him, too, riches and fame, Mr. Ros
ten reasoned.
Hollywood is presumed to he the
Bagdad of the Pacific, Mr. Rosten
continued, but it is in reality a big
business just, beginning to achieve a
criteria for efficency, since no one
really knows how to guarantee a
good movie. "Even Shakespeare
couldn't write a great drama every
time he tried," he added.
The fact that movie-making is a
big business is often overlooked, Mr.
Rosten said, since its fascinating ele
ment does not coincide with the
usual business concept. An invest
ment of two billion dollars and 350
movies arc made each year in Holly
wood, however.
Movies and movie-makers arc
news because films can transcend
language barriers in every part of
the world. There are more newspa
permen in Hollywood than in any
other city, except. Washington, D.C.,
in the world, the speaker said.
"During the worst bombing of
London, the British press requested
a front-page story on Ann Shcri
ran's matrimonial difficulties, and
the Italians, in their recent retreat
from Greece, were heard singing a
tune from the "Wizard of Oz," Mr.
Rosten added, emphasizing Holly
wood's universal appeal.
