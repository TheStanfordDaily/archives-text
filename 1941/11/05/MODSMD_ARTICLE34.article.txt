# Radio Addicts Glean Sound Phenomena from Broadcasts

### MARTHAGRACE POWELL 
A horse and wagon going over a rutted dirt road may not lie the raging
torrent of a Hood, but in recorded form, cut to half speed and aided by
the gurglings of a sound man, the Stanford radio workshop has found an
effective substitute.
Stanford radio enthusiasts in the new series, "The Wealth of the

West," broadcast every Thursday at
8 p.m. over KQW, have found a new
workshop for effectively learning
and experimenting with radio tech
niques.
The programs which went on the
air for the first time three weeks ago
were intended by the Radio Com
mittee, appointed by Dr. Wilbur this
summer, to bring Stanford Univer
sity and the treasures of the West
closer to the western people. After
the first broadcast the other possi
bility was realized—a radio work
shop.
Through a new extra-curricular
course organized this week by Dr.
Hubert Heffner and Frank Cady,
author of the program, students can
branch out into any field of radio
work—acting, writing, directing, and
technical work.
Not only have students directly
participated in the program itself,
but they have helped bring about a
radio studio on campus. Skipwith
Athey, a graduate student, and Jim
Walter, (he custodian of Memorial
Theater, aided by experts from var
ious departments of the school, have
erected a workable and practical ra
dio studio within the Hoover Li
brary.
By treating the walls and parti
tioning off the hallway with sound
proofed board and glass, a fairly
good studio was obtained from an
average room in the library.
Next quarter the speech depart
ment hopes to include this radio
workshop as a course in its regular
curricula, but for the present there
is, according to 'Mr. Cady, opportu
nity for work, experience, a chance

for an indiivdital to prove himself in
some line of radio work, but for
little credit.

good studio was obtained from an
average room in the library.
Next quarter the speech depart
ment hopes to include this radio
workshop as a course in its regular
curricula, but for the present there
is, according to 'Mr. Cady, opportu
nity for work, experience, a chance

for an indiivdital to prove himself in
some line of radio work, but for
little credit.
A horse and wagon going over a rutted dirt road may not lie the raging
torrent of a Hood, but in recorded form, cut to half speed and aided by
the gurglings of a sound man, the Stanford radio workshop has found an
effective substitute.
Stanford radio enthusiasts in the new series, "The Wealth of the

West," broadcast every Thursday at
8 p.m. over KQW, have found a new
workshop for effectively learning
and experimenting with radio tech
niques.
The programs which went on the
air for the first time three weeks ago
were intended by the Radio Com
mittee, appointed by Dr. Wilbur this
summer, to bring Stanford Univer
sity and the treasures of the West
closer to the western people. After
the first broadcast the other possi
bility was realized—a radio work
shop.
Through a new extra-curricular
course organized this week by Dr.
Hubert Heffner and Frank Cady,
author of the program, students can
branch out into any field of radio
work—acting, writing, directing, and
technical work.
Not only have students directly
participated in the program itself,
but they have helped bring about a
radio studio on campus. Skipwith
Athey, a graduate student, and Jim
Walter, (he custodian of Memorial
Theater, aided by experts from var
ious departments of the school, have
erected a workable and practical ra
dio studio within the Hoover Li
brary.
By treating the walls and parti
tioning off the hallway with sound
proofed board and glass, a fairly
good studio was obtained from an
average room in the library.
Next quarter the speech depart
ment hopes to include this radio
workshop as a course in its regular
curricula, but for the present there
is, according to 'Mr. Cady, opportu
nity for work, experience, a chance

for an indiivdital to prove himself in
some line of radio work, but for
little credit.
