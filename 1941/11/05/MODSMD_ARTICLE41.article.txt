# Stanford T Knows Plays Of Trojans
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity footballers will
not lack a knowledge of what they
must face when they leave for the
Southland Thursday to play the
Southern California Trojans in the
Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday.
Louie Vincenti, brainy Card grid
der of the late 'twenties, who is
now practicing law down south, gave
Coach Shaughnessy and his team the
low-down on the Trojan power
plays, most of which run off an un
balanced litfe, during yesterday's
practice session. Vincenli trans
mitted the plays to the "blacks," who
ran them against the first and sec
ond strings.
ARMSTRONG RECOVERING
Hoot Armstrong was the only
squad member not in suit today. He
has a charley-horse in his leg, which
is healing fast, however. Running
at his post on the first string was
Willard Sheller.
Only other personnel change was
the elevation of Jim Cox, sophomore,
to the second string left tackle po
sition, putting Swede Johannessen
on the third team.
DELAUER INJURED
Only Trojan who is not likely to
see service against the T Saturday
is Captain Bob DeLauer, first string
tackle. After recovering from the
early season injuries which have
kept him out of most of the games
to date, DeLauer broke his wrist in
practice last week, and since it is
now in a cast, he is a doubtful
starter.
However, Mel Bleeker, Jim Crow
ther, Fred McCall, Dick Danehe,
and Ray Woods are all back in the
lineup after their various length
absences. Danehe was running at
the first string center spot until in
juries hit him.
CROWTIIER REPLACES
With DeLauer out Crowther may
be moved from his second string
guard position in the tackle berth.
With Bleeker and Woods back, the
S.C. attack can function at full
strength. It will be the first time all
season that all of the Trojan ball
carriers, the quarterbacks, fullbacks,
and right halves, have been in shape
simultaneously.
Bob Robertson, leader in total of
fense for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, will start at quarterback, but
may be shifted to right halfback
during the course of the encounter.
Working with Robertson is Paul
Taylor, the left-handed passing full
back. Spelling these two men are
Bill and Bob Musick, brothers of
former S.C. Ail-American Jim Mu-

Hoot Armstrong was the only
squad member not in suit today. He
has a charley-horse in his leg, which
is healing fast, however. Running
at his post on the first string was
Willard Sheller.
Only other personnel change was
the elevation of Jim Cox, sophomore,
to the second string left tackle po
sition, putting Swede Johannessen
on the third team.
DELAUER INJURED
Only Trojan who is not likely to
see service against the T Saturday
is Captain Bob DeLauer, first string
tackle. After recovering from the
early season injuries which have
kept him out of most of the games
to date, DeLauer broke his wrist in
practice last week, and since it is
now in a cast, he is a doubtful
starter.
However, Mel Bleeker, Jim Crow
ther, Fred McCall, Dick Danehe,
and Ray Woods are all back in the
lineup after their various length
absences. Danehe was running at
the first string center spot until in
juries hit him.
CROWTIIER REPLACES
With DeLauer out Crowther may
be moved from his second string
guard position in the tackle berth.
With Bleeker and Woods back, the
S.C. attack can function at full
strength. It will be the first time all
season that all of the Trojan ball
carriers, the quarterbacks, fullbacks,
and right halves, have been in shape
simultaneously.
Bob Robertson, leader in total of
fense for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, will start at quarterback, but
may be shifted to right halfback
during the course of the encounter.
Working with Robertson is Paul
Taylor, the left-handed passing full
back. Spelling these two men are
Bill and Bob Musick, brothers of
former S.C. Ail-American Jim Mu-
Stanford's varsity footballers will
not lack a knowledge of what they
must face when they leave for the
Southland Thursday to play the
Southern California Trojans in the
Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday.
Louie Vincenti, brainy Card grid
der of the late 'twenties, who is
now practicing law down south, gave
Coach Shaughnessy and his team the
low-down on the Trojan power
plays, most of which run off an un
balanced litfe, during yesterday's
practice session. Vincenli trans
mitted the plays to the "blacks," who
ran them against the first and sec
ond strings.
