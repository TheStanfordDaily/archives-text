# Poloists to Meet Hayward Squad
## 
### 
If the weather man can hold the
rain off long enough to get the high
way polo field dry to play on, Lieu
tenant Robert Ranzoni's varsity
polo team will tussle with the Hay
ward Polo Club next Saturday.
Sunday's exhibition game with the
Hayward outfit was called off due to
the moisture but a couple of the
Ranzoni-regulars shot a few goals
for the Boy Scouts just to show how
it's done.
The Indians have always had no
end of trouble when they meet the
Hayward Club. In the last game the
Hay wards were way out in front but
in the closing chukkers of the game
the Stanford team, under Bill Dirk
er's direction, managed to slam
through two goals to tie the score
and end the game, 5-5. The visitors
from the Bay Area have been play
ing polo together for a good many
years now and they really know how
to maneuver the ball through the
opponent's goal.

The New York Aquarium, opened
December 10, 189(5, is the oldest in
the United States.
