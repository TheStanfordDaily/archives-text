# Frosh Gridmen Injuries Mount
## 
### 
Crippled as a stumblebum wearing
wedgies, Stanford's Papeese bounced
through a muddy scrimmage yester
day on the soccer field. missed
the workout: Woods, Wallace, Col
burn, McCurdy, and Johnston.
With the Cal-Stanford yearling
struggle a week off, Mentor Harry
Shipkey was bemoaning his injury
riddled squad with the usual pre
game pessimism.
BUT:
Pete August handled center Sat
urday against San Mateo J. C. in
place of McCurdy and Johnston, first
and second string pivotmen.
Dave Pate, at fullback for Woods,
passed 40 yards to Cannon Parkin
son for the winning score over S.M.
Bob Hall, ( in for Wallace and Col
burn, started at right end and looked
great.
And the frosh won out over S.M.,
; so why can't they do it again against
: Cal's Cubs?
BEAK BABES STRONG
The Golden Bear babes undoubt
edly have one of the greatest frosh
teams they've ever had. Southern
Cal's Trobabes fell before the Cubs,
26-0. while the Papeese slugged out
a 25-6 victory over the Trobabes.
Smallest man on the Cub squad
is the toughest. Jack Clifford, 154-
pound halfback, accounted for or
I set up each of the four touchdowns
scored against S.C.
