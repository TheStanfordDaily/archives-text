# RICHMOND HANDICAP
## 
### 
SAN BRUNO, Nov. 4 (UP).â€”H. F.
Haldcman's Count Chat won the
$1,000 Richmond Handicap at six fur
longs at Tanforan race track today.

On Thursday at 4:00, Monte Pfyl
; and his Fireboys start rolling against
i a Breaker outfit that has Bruce Clai'k
and hopes. The other three play
offs set will be decided on Monday,
November 10, at 4:00.
KAPPA SIGS vs. BIZ MEN
The two main contenders, Frank
Wells and his Kappa Sig team and
Bill Tweedie with his '"dark-horse
businessmen," will match their pass
ing and running on Monday at 4:00.
The brackets being what they are,
the winner of this struggle is the
most logical choice to meet the Fire
house in the finals. Either team may
win this toss-up, but the champ here
must definitely be rated a favorite
over the top team of the Alpha
Delt-Sequoia duo.
In the top bracket Dekes play Toro
and 2E plays 4W. The winners of
these meet for the honor of playing
the winner of Firehouse-Breakers to
reach the finals. The favorite here
is not exactly a long shot, which
means that barring upsets it will be
Firehouse against Kappa Sigma or
Business School in the stadium on
November 15.
