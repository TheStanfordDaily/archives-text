# Mural Playoff Brackets Scheduled for Gridders
## 
### 
Firehouse plays Breakers, Deke
plays Toro, Encina 2E plays Encina
4W, Alpha Delt plays Sequoia, and
Kappa Sigma plays Business School
in the first games of the Stanford
intramural championship playoffs.
The bracketings were announced
after a meeting of the ten team man
agers and circuit director Bob Bur
nett last night. Firehouse was seed
ed first in the arrangement, with
Kappa Sig, Business School, Alpha
Delt, and Delta Kappa Epsilon rated
on a par as the next best squads.
Only possible hitches in the brack
et arrangement will result if Alpha
Delt is upset by Phi Psi in a game
today. If the Phi Psi's, who played
the Alpha Delts to a 0 to 0 dead
lock Monday, win, that league is
thrown into a three-way tie for first,
with Sigma Nu the third party eli
gible. Similarly, El Cuadro must
lose to Medical School II today if
Sequoia's title is to be clinched. A
Cuadro win would necessitate an
other playoff here, further slowing
up the picture. Both teams with
doubtful titles are bracketed together
so that other games can be surted
at once.
PLAYOFF DATES
This afternoon the Dekes will
meet the El Toros to start the ball
rolling at 4:00. Deke will spring
a lineup featuring Jim Pollard, John
Leddy, and a fast pass attack. Toro
banks on Bob Morton, Bob Mont
gomery, and a squad that has played
the breaks the right way in a tough
preliminary round.
