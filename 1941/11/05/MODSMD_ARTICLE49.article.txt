ORINGING home the fact that the
hoop season isn't terribly far
away is the notice in the morning
papers about Hank Luisetti, the
former Stanford baskethaller who is
probably as great a player as there
has ever been, leading his Phillips
(56 quintet to victory in that outfit's
first game of the year.
The fact that Luisetti is now
playing with the Oilers is a great
loss to San Francisco club basket
ball, for the angular Italian boy was
the greatest impetus in the revival
of the hoop game as played by in
dustrial and club teams in the area.
Now that the game is going at a
good speed again, the interest in San
Francisco will probably survive, at
least for a few years, but it won't
be the same without the inimitable
Hank.

JT WOULD BE interesting to knnw j
what rank would be given the '
Stanford Indians in the national foot- 1
ball ratings at this stage of the 1941
race if Oregon State hadn't done our J
boys dirt.
Considering the competition the
Indians go up agaihst, it wouldn't
be hard to figure them in the top
spot, the berth that Dana X. Bible's
University of Texas Longhorns hold
in the Associated Press rankings and
that the Navy eleven rests in ac
cording to Deke Houlgate. Houlgate, !
incidentally, figures that Stanford is
the seventh, best team in the coun
try today, behind the aforementioned j
Navy and Texas, and Minnesota, j
Duke, Fordham, and Michigan.
That's why it would be so good if
the Indians go to the Rose Bowl. For
then they will be able to invite one j
of those higher ranking teams and j
take a crack at knocking it off its !
lofty perch.
That would make the boys who do
the figuring and come out with the j
standings feel mighty good.

THAT both of the leading :
exponents of the famous T
formation, Stanford and the profes
sional Chicago Bears, are among the
ranks of the once-defeated teams
this year, we wonder how the boys
who figured that the T was the
only thing necessary for victory
feel.
Even more surprising than Stan
ford's defeat by the Beavers was the
licking given George Halas' Bears j
by the Green Bay Packers. It all j
just goes to show that no matter 1
how good you and a lot of other
people think you are, there's always ;
someone who won't agree and has I
the weapons to prove their point.
But now that both teams have
been knocked over, perhaps football '
critics will get their feet back on |
the ground again, and return to the
concluson that it is men that make j
teams, not a style of attack. And
now the Indians and the Bears MAY
—whether they CAN or not is an
other question—start on their merry j
way again, just as they did last i
season.

On a day in December, 1933, a
dynamite explosion set off on the
Arctic island of Nova Zembia was
detected in Berlin, more than 2,000 j
miles away. i
