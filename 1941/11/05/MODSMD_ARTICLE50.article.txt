# Mermen to Clash With S.C., Bruins
## 
### 
Revenge will very definitely be in
order for the Stanford varsity water
polo team this week-end when they
tangle with U.S.C. Friday night in
the Trojan plunge and with the
powerful U.C.L.A. Bruins Saturday
morning at 10 in the Westwood pool.
The Bruins hold an earlier 8 to 6
victory over Coach Norton Thorn
ton's mermen. Boasting two all
conference forwards, Cab Mitchell

and Johnny Segale, the Bruins have
real offensive strength.
On Center Back Bob Jones and
Guards Frank Mitchell and Jack
I Bleecker will fall the burden of
stopping this scoring threat. Stan
| ford's own shooting is coming in for
a lot of attention this week. The
I Cards had a poor average against
! the Bruins last game, according to
1 Thornton.
