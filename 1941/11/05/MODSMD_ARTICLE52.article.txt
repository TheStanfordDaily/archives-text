# No Bliss in This Ignorance
## 
### 
TNTERFRATERNITY Board of Control last night
I proved to the campus that its rushing regu
lations are furnished with sharply filed teeth,
and furthermore set an example of student lead
ership, when it leveled punitive action at a
house which had illegally jumped the rushing
gun.
In fairness to the Chi Psi's, perhaps we can
presume they were ignorant of the rushing
rules. Perhaps they were not. But, it is obvious
that this time ignorance is anything but bliss
ful. And we know that, in the case of future
infractions, the preceding sentence in this edi
torial will be an understatement. For, in the
words of the Board, "Any infraction of any na
ture will from now on be dealt with severely."
Rushing regulations and a prepared state
ment from the Board will be printed in tomor
row's Daily. There can be no excuse next time
and, as always, that includes ignorance of the
law.
This year the Board re-deferred the inaugura
tion of rushing from the middle of autumn quar
ter to winter quarter. Benefits of the deferred
rushing system are multifold—among others,
the fraternity house can carry out fall initiation
of sophomores without being harassed with
thoughts of impending rushing; freshmen have
adequate time to devote their first quarter to
studies, and to survey the houses with a per
spective that only distance can afford.
A vital organization about which compara
tively little is known on the Farm is the inter
fraternity organization. It consists of Interfra
ternity Council, comprising all house presidents
and Interfraternity officers (president, secretary
treasurer, and house managers chairman);
house mangers group; and Interfraternity Board
of Control, the ultimate authority, consisting of
II men (five alumni, Administration, and fac
ulty members and six undergraduates). Three
of the student members are the Interfraternity
officers and the other three are elected repre
sentatives from the Council.
The students are not run by their elders, for
their elders believe in student government at
Stanford. In voting, the students have a 6 to 5
majority over the alumni, faculty and Admin
istration members. And, in case of tie vote, the
Interfraternity and Board president, who is a
student, has the deciding vote.
Let one thing be understood clearly. Inter
fraternity Board of Control is not a toy of the
Administration; we know this far a fact be
cause we represented The Daily at Interfra
ternity meetings for two years. We watched
them discuss and solve their problems. It is
only wise to have older men interested in sane
fraternity activity hold membership on the
Board, and their opinions have always guided
Iraternities along the wise course.
It is the live Interfraternity Board's avowed
purpose to weed out any and every infraction
this year, and they will swing a mighty blud
geon of retribution against those who cannot
play the game squarely.
The Board is to be congratulated for the ac
tion taken last night.—Harold Shafer

ful. And we know that, in the case of future
infractions, the preceding sentence in this edi
torial will be an understatement. For, in the
words of the Board, "Any infraction of any na
ture will from now on be dealt with severely."
Rushing regulations and a prepared state
ment from the Board will be printed in tomor
row's Daily. There can be no excuse next time
and, as always, that includes ignorance of the
law.
This year the Board re-deferred the inaugura
tion of rushing from the middle of autumn quar
ter to winter quarter. Benefits of the deferred
rushing system are multifold—among others,
the fraternity house can carry out fall initiation
of sophomores without being harassed with
thoughts of impending rushing; freshmen have
adequate time to devote their first quarter to
studies, and to survey the houses with a per
spective that only distance can afford.
A vital organization about which compara
tively little is known on the Farm is the inter
fraternity organization. It consists of Interfra
ternity Council, comprising all house presidents
and Interfraternity officers (president, secretary
treasurer, and house managers chairman);
house mangers group; and Interfraternity Board
of Control, the ultimate authority, consisting of
II men (five alumni, Administration, and fac
ulty members and six undergraduates). Three
of the student members are the Interfraternity
officers and the other three are elected repre
sentatives from the Council.
The students are not run by their elders, for
their elders believe in student government at
Stanford. In voting, the students have a 6 to 5
majority over the alumni, faculty and Admin
istration members. And, in case of tie vote, the
Interfraternity and Board president, who is a
student, has the deciding vote.
Let one thing be understood clearly. Inter
fraternity Board of Control is not a toy of the
Administration; we know this far a fact be
cause we represented The Daily at Interfra
ternity meetings for two years. We watched
them discuss and solve their problems. It is
only wise to have older men interested in sane
fraternity activity hold membership on the
Board, and their opinions have always guided
Iraternities along the wise course.
It is the live Interfraternity Board's avowed
purpose to weed out any and every infraction
this year, and they will swing a mighty blud
geon of retribution against those who cannot
play the game squarely.
The Board is to be congratulated for the ac
tion taken last night.—Harold Shafer

I proved to the campus that its rushing regu
lations are furnished with sharply filed teeth,
and furthermore set an example of student lead
ership, when it leveled punitive action at a
house which had illegally jumped the rushing
gun.
In fairness to the Chi Psi's, perhaps we can
presume they were ignorant of the rushing
rules. Perhaps they were not. But, it is obvious
that this time ignorance is anything but bliss
ful. And we know that, in the case of future
