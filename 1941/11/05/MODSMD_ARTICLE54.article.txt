A COUPLE of Saturdays ago the U.S.C. Tro
jans came up to Berkeley and took a drub
bing from the Bears.
Last Saturday our rooting section didn't take
very well to card distribution, but that's nothing.
We hope the editor of an opponent's college
paper won't have to print anything like the fol
lowing about our rooting section.
Daily Trojan Editor Myron Minnick sarcasti
cally took the Cal rooters down a peg in an edi
torial entitled "Those Cal Gentleman." For the
benefit of Stanfordites who have not had the
pleasure of hearing the Cal section this year, or
in past years, we reprint the following excerpt
from the Trojan editorial. We'll hear them on
the 29th:
"One, two, three, four, five—you . . . !"
"This charming bit of what is commonly
called 'school spirit' was directed at the ref
eree by the University of California rooting
section in Saturday's game. It was one of the
many ways employed by those very intelli
gent university students to express their opin
ions. Their opinions were impressed not only
on the minds of the spectators, but also on the
minds oi the thousands of radio listeners who
heard the shouted obscenities.
. . To demonstrate their artistic prowess,
some of these California rooters held up ob
scene drawings on 6-foot cards, so that the
public would realize the cultural atmosphere
which surrounds their busy and productive
college lives. . .
