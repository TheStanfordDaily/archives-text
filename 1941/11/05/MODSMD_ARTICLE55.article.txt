NOW IS THE TIME
J CAN'T help feeling that the British are a little too
relaxed, a little too complacent at the present time,
and are not taking the active part in helping the Rus
sians that they should. The British seem too inclined
to let the Russains battle it out. They sympathize
with the Russians, they have sent over airmen, me
chanics and "numerous" planes, but they haven't done
anything really decisive. Their whole attitude seems
to be that bombing on Britain has ceased for a while,
and someone else is getting it and while it is too bad,
there isn't much that England can do. The British al
ways seem too eager to let someone else do the fight
ing, if they get the chance.
It would seem that the British would have had time
to recover from their troubles to be ready for an
assault on Italy or an attack on Finland or a more
effective use of their sea strength. But nothing defi
nite, concrete has been done, and the British are allow
ing the Russians to slowly waste away. For as it looks
now, the fall of Russia is only a matter of time.
The British say that they have not attacked Fin
land mainly because of objections raised by the
United States. When the Russians suggested that it
might be to England's advantage to declare war on
Finland, the British replied that "naturally the United
States is being kept informed on the subject."

V|T/HY does England stall around so much? Why
should England care what the United States
thinks about what it does? Is it because they want
the sympathy of the U.S. and want to give the U.S.
the feeling that it too is greatly connected with what
happens? Is it because they are trying to draw the
United States into the middle of the muddle instead of
doing the work themselves? It would be to England's
advantage to attack Finland and they don't have to
worry what anyone says. If they really wanted to help
the Russians, if they weren't too eager to let things
drift and try to drag other countries into their fight,
such action would be taken immediately.
But they choose to ask the United States to take
the leadership in dealing with the Finns, they allow
the Russians to battle with the Germans by themselves,
while they shrewdly play the diplomatic game. Now is
the time for some definite action, for the Germans are
in the worst shape than they have been in for a long
time. Now is the time, and the British had better take
advantage of it, for it may never come again.

The following dispatch from Rome camc over the
wire the other day: "The government announced today
all students and graduates of universities and sec
ondary schools who are 20 years old or over will be
called to the colors Dec. 1 for training as officers."
You see, this war scare is even getting over to
Europe.
