# CAMPUS OPINION
## PLEASE SIGN THEM 
### 
r rO STANFORD STUDENTS:
Those of you who think, whether or not your
thoughts be wise or reasonable, often write to The
Daily. That is fine. We like to get the letters, we
like to know that someone who reads The Daily will
take the time and effort to write in, cither agreeing
or diasgreeing, or suggesting.
However, it is necessary that names be signed to
all letters. The name will be withheld if you wish,
but the letter must be signed.
In addition, we do not feel that the campus opin
ion is the place for term-paper-like dissertations on the
philosophical aspects of most anything. Please confine
your letters to a sensible length. Your letter will stand
a lot better chance of getting printed if it is short and
to the point. A page and a half double spaced is the
absolute maximum.
Thanks for your letters. We're sorry about the un
signed ones.
The Editor
