# Smith's 'Passionate Witch' Printed After Seven Days
## 
### 
THE PASSIONATE YVITCTI by Thorne Smith and completed by
Norman Matson; published by Doublcday Doran.
In the space of his short life, the late Thorne Smith succeeded in estab
lishing for himself a one-man literary genre. Uncqualcd and unrivaled
in his own type of hilarious almost ribald humor, he has carried this spirit

into his newest publication which,
will be read with the same relish as
have all his foregoing novels.
The most surprising thing about
the "Passionate Witch' 'is that it
was left incomplete at the time of
Smith's death seven years ago.
Where Smith's writing stops and
Nroman Matson's begins will be dif
ficult for anyone to discover.
POOR, MEEK WOOLSEY
The text of the story is typically
Smith-like. Meek, respectable, T.
Wallace Woolsey, a wealthy nearly
middle-aged widower, finds himself
faced with a terrific problem. He
has unwittingly gotten involved with
and married a first-class witch. In
human form (she later is reincar
nated in the shape of Woolsey's pet
horse), she calls herself Jennifer
Broome and by means of her witchy
wiles and passionate antics sweeps
poor unsuspecting Mr. Woolsey off
his feet. He is supremely happy un
til he discovers the true identity of
his new wife; then his happiness
turns to fear, then to stark despera
tion. T. Wallace, who has never
touched anything stronger than car
rot juice and vitamin pills, turns to
the evil drink as a means of shut
ting out the horror of his life. It
first starts as a little thing, but the
necessity of being constantly drunk
mounts and mounts until Woolsey
finds he cannot live in anything ap
proaching peace unless he is totally
inebriated. Then, to top off all his
other difficulties, he knows that he
really loves Betty, his private sec
retary, who has always loved him
but whom he has never had time to
care about, until now. But it is now
too late. He is married to a witch.
BLOOD!
Miss Broome, or rather Mrs.
Woolsey, realizes that her husband
knows who she is; so she makes no
attempt to conceal her witchcraft
and openly goes out for a stroll in
the moonlight or strangles a chicken
over the bathtub for a cup of blood.
She loves her husband's money and
when she sees his loving glances
toward his secretary, she tries to
bump her off by burning her house
down. However, Betty doesn't get
burned at all, but Jennifer (in hu
man form) is killed by a burning
timber falling from the house. At
last Mr. Woolsey thinks his troubles
are at an end, but he forgets to tell
the mortician to stick a stake in the
dead Jennifer's heart. Therefore, she
comes back to haunt him in the form
of his beloved horse. The climax of
the tale is much too funny to bear
description. One must read it in or
der to appreciate all of its alcoholic
hilarity. The story ends on a happy
note as Mr. Woolsey gets rid of his
unsuccessful second wife and em
barks on a honeymoon cruise with
his successful third, the private sec
retary.
This book is the answer to seven
years of prayer by Smithomaniacs.
It takes its place on the high shelf
beside Skin and Bones, the Topper
stories, and other novels of this re
markable humorist.—Rector

poor unsuspecting Mr. Woolsey off
his feet. He is supremely happy un
til he discovers the true identity of
his new wife; then his happiness
turns to fear, then to stark despera
tion. T. Wallace, who has never
touched anything stronger than car
rot juice and vitamin pills, turns to
the evil drink as a means of shut
ting out the horror of his life. It
first starts as a little thing, but the
necessity of being constantly drunk
mounts and mounts until Woolsey
finds he cannot live in anything ap
proaching peace unless he is totally
inebriated. Then, to top off all his
other difficulties, he knows that he
really loves Betty, his private sec
retary, who has always loved him
but whom he has never had time to
care about, until now. But it is now
too late. He is married to a witch.
BLOOD!
Miss Broome, or rather Mrs.
Woolsey, realizes that her husband
knows who she is; so she makes no
attempt to conceal her witchcraft
and openly goes out for a stroll in
the moonlight or strangles a chicken
over the bathtub for a cup of blood.
She loves her husband's money and
when she sees his loving glances
toward his secretary, she tries to
bump her off by burning her house
down. However, Betty doesn't get
burned at all, but Jennifer (in hu
man form) is killed by a burning
timber falling from the house. At
last Mr. Woolsey thinks his troubles
are at an end, but he forgets to tell
the mortician to stick a stake in the
dead Jennifer's heart. Therefore, she
comes back to haunt him in the form
of his beloved horse. The climax of
the tale is much too funny to bear
description. One must read it in or
der to appreciate all of its alcoholic
hilarity. The story ends on a happy
note as Mr. Woolsey gets rid of his
unsuccessful second wife and em
barks on a honeymoon cruise with
his successful third, the private sec
retary.

THE PASSIONATE YVITCTI by Thorne Smith and completed by
Norman Matson; published by Doublcday Doran.
In the space of his short life, the late Thorne Smith succeeded in estab
lishing for himself a one-man literary genre. Uncqualcd and unrivaled
in his own type of hilarious almost ribald humor, he has carried this spirit

into his newest publication which,
will be read with the same relish as
have all his foregoing novels.
The most surprising thing about
the "Passionate Witch' 'is that it
was left incomplete at the time of
Smith's death seven years ago.
Where Smith's writing stops and
Nroman Matson's begins will be dif
ficult for anyone to discover.
POOR, MEEK WOOLSEY
The text of the story is typically
Smith-like. Meek, respectable, T.
Wallace Woolsey, a wealthy nearly
middle-aged widower, finds himself
faced with a terrific problem. He
has unwittingly gotten involved with
and married a first-class witch. In
human form (she later is reincar
nated in the shape of Woolsey's pet
horse), she calls herself Jennifer
Broome and by means of her witchy
wiles and passionate antics sweeps
poor unsuspecting Mr. Woolsey off
his feet. He is supremely happy un

his new wife; then his happiness
turns to fear, then to stark despera
