# 'Nosey' Excom Settles Lost, Found Issue
## 
### BUD AMES 
In a meeting which definitely
should be termed "lethal," Excom
last night emerged from the per
fumed mist with only one note
worthy action, namely the returning
of the Lost and Found Bureau into
Administration hands.
"The system has proved unsatis
factory in student hands and the
Administration has kindly consented
to accept the burden," stated George
Jackson, A.S.S.U. president. "They
are now working on plans for an
efficient system."
Only light spot of the evening was
the perfume sampling test given Ex
Committee men in line with a story
which shall appear in The Daily's
forthcoming fashion addition. With
Larry Freer and Isabclle Fawcett in
the advance, the sampling turned to
battle royale as perfume was lib
erally sprinkled on the hair and
clothes of Excom men.
Most poignant statement of the
eveningâ€”by President Jackson: "It
stinks."
Discussion of Axe Society's ref
ormation led to granting them by
Excom "two quarters of grace" in
which to regain their former footing.
Hays Busch carefully outlined Big
Game Dance plans, and Irma Jean
Hannibal, speaking for the Drives
Committee, dealt long on the prob
lem of raising funds for the Ameri
can Farm School in Greece.
"Are there American children in
this Farm School," queried Isabclle
Fawcett.
"No," retorted Miss Hannibal,
"they're Greece lx>ys in Greece."
All in all the meeting was re
mindful of smells in the New Or
leans French quarter.
