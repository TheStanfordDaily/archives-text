"Hurry up and get your S.C.
game train tickets if you want spe
cial rates," Jim McKellar, student
manager, stated last night. The S.P.
Special for Stanford students leaves
Palo Alto this Friday evening at
7:40.
Tickets are going at a rapid rate
and those at special rates are limit
ed, according to McKellar. Only one
section will make the trip to L.A.
and when this is filled, no more
train reservations are available.
Students must buy berths besides
their $10 round trip tickets; an up
per berth costs $3.36 and the lower
$4.42.
The S.C. train leaves Palo Alto at
7:40 Friday evening and arrives in
L.A. at 7:40 Saturday morning, mak
ing the trip in exactly 12 hours. The
train will leave Los Angeles at 6:45
Sunday evening and is scheduled to
arrive in Palo Alto Monday morning
at 6:45 a.m., just in time for 'Mon
day classes.
Last week Jim McKellar bought
$2,500 worth of S.P. tickets at spe
cial rates and in so doing saved
about $250 for Stanford students.
The regular tickets cost about 5 per
cent more, plus an additional railroad
tax.
