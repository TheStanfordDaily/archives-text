/ I ERMAN armies in the Crimea
9 have apparently succeeded in
hacking the Russian defense line
into three not-so-neat pieces. The
result is that the Russians are mak
ing a desperate attempt to reach
ports on the Black Sea and get out
before they are trapped.
The situation is comparable in
many respects to Dunkirk. The
Russian troops are encircled, their
communications with the north
completely severed, and there is
only one way for them to get out
and that is by sea. Much depends
on the Red navy's performance;
this is the first time the Russian
fleet has had to co-ordinate with
the land forces in a military opera
tion of any size.
The Russians, hotly pursued by
Nazi troops, and strafed for good
measure by the Luftwaffe, have had
little chance to dig in and make an
other stand, The Crimea is lost; now
it is just a question of whether they
can pull out their armies or not.
Sevastopol, Kerch, and Yalta are
the Black Sea ports which the Reds
are headed for. These cities are al
ready under shattering bombard
ment and the German High Com
mand claimed yesterday that nine
Soviet evacuation ships had been
sunk or crippled.
# « *
IRUSSIAN losses in men along the
whole southern front have been
devastating all through this war.
The fall of Kiev took a bad toll, and
the Budenny fiasco coming on top of
that was a severe blow.
Fortnight ago Stalin transferred
Timoshcnko to the southern front
in an eleventh-hour attempt to
save the situation, while Budenny
was sent behind the lines to or
ganize an army of raw recruits.
But apparently even the great
marshal, defender of Moscow, was
not enough to stop the southern blitz
for it had already gone too far. The
encircling, pincer strategy has been
nowhere so effective in this cam
paign as it has in the south—Ukraine,
Donets, Crimea all have been snared
in it.
London military experts have ex
pressed the belief that when the
Germans complete the drive through
Crimea to the Caucasus they will
turn north to Rostov and, coming up
on the city from behind, will out
flank the whole Russian Don river
defense line.
* * *
r |' , HE success of a move like this
would mean virtual loss of the
entire northern Caucasus because
once the Nazis encircled Rostov from
both the north and south, they
would be in a position to wheel
around and strike for the Maikop
and Grozny oil fields, both of which
are north of the Caucasus mountain
range.
While these oil fields are not near
ly so rich as those of Baku—south of
the mountains —nevertheless they are
nothing for the Germans to sneeze
at, especially in their present oil
poor condition.
These losses in the south would
be far more serious than anything
the Russians have experienced to
date. Even the fall of Moscow
would not be as critical a blow.
But Moscow seems to be holding
out and shows every sign of contin
uing to do so. At any rate, opera
tions on the central front have bog
ged down considerably in the past
week, and the Russians now claim
that they arc counter-attacking suc
cessfully in several points.

I ERMAN newsreels yesterday
r showed Der Fuehrer inspecting
all sorts of elaborate paraphernalia
designed to keep the boys warm
through the winter. While the Ger
man soldiers were pictured warming
their hands at campfires and knock
ing the ice from water buckets in or
der to shave, Hitler was shown
looking at sleds, portable brick fire
places, iron stoves, etc., etc.
This will be a cold hard winter
—as all Russian winters are. But
psychologically it will go harder
with the Germans who expected to
he toasting themselves before (he
braziers in the Kremlin within six
weeks after the first offensive was
launched, and hanging their Xmas
stocking up on good solid Russian
fireplaces instead of portable
makeshifts.

The fall of Kiev took a bad toll, and
the Budenny fiasco coming on top of
that was a severe blow.

Timoshcnko to the southern front
in an eleventh-hour attempt to
save the situation, while Budenny
was sent behind the lines to or

But apparently even the great
marshal, defender of Moscow, was
not enough to stop the southern blitz
for it had already gone too far. The
encircling, pincer strategy has been
nowhere so effective in this cam

Donets, Crimea all have been snared
in it.

Crimea to the Caucasus they will
turn north to Rostov and, coming up
on the city from behind, will out

are north of the Caucasus mountain
range.
While these oil fields are not near

the mountains —nevertheless they are
nothing for the Germans to sneeze
at, especially in their present oil
poor condition.
These losses in the south would
be far more serious than anything
the Russians have experienced to
date. Even the fall of Moscow
would not be as critical a blow.
But Moscow seems to be holding
out and shows every sign of contin

before they are trapped.
The situation is comparable in
many respects to Dunkirk. The
Russian troops are encircled, their
communications with the north
completely severed, and there is
only one way for them to get out
and that is by sea. Much depends
on the Red navy's performance;
this is the first time the Russian
fleet has had to co-ordinate with
the land forces in a military opera
tion of any size.
The Russians, hotly pursued by
Nazi troops, and strafed for good
measure by the Luftwaffe, have had
little chance to dig in and make an
other stand, The Crimea is lost; now
it is just a question of whether they
can pull out their armies or not.
Sevastopol, Kerch, and Yalta are
the Black Sea ports which the Reds
are headed for. These cities are al
ready under shattering bombard
ment and the German High Com
mand claimed yesterday that nine
Soviet evacuation ships had been
sunk or crippled.

IRUSSIAN losses in men along the
whole southern front have been
devastating all through this war.
The fall of Kiev took a bad toll, and
the Budenny fiasco coming on top of
that was a severe blow.
Fortnight ago Stalin transferred
Timoshcnko to the southern front
in an eleventh-hour attempt to
save the situation, while Budenny
was sent behind the lines to or
ganize an army of raw recruits.
But apparently even the great
marshal, defender of Moscow, was
not enough to stop the southern blitz
for it had already gone too far. The
encircling, pincer strategy has been
nowhere so effective in this cam
paign as it has in the south—Ukraine,
Donets, Crimea all have been snared
in it.
London military experts have ex
pressed the belief that when the
Germans complete the drive through
Crimea to the Caucasus they will
turn north to Rostov and, coming up
on the city from behind, will out
flank the whole Russian Don river
defense line.

would mean virtual loss of the
entire northern Caucasus because
once the Nazis encircled Rostov from
both the north and south, they
would be in a position to wheel
around and strike for the Maikop
and Grozny oil fields, both of which
are north of the Caucasus mountain
range.
While these oil fields are not near
ly so rich as those of Baku—south of
the mountains —nevertheless they are
nothing for the Germans to sneeze
at, especially in their present oil
poor condition.
These losses in the south would
be far more serious than anything
the Russians have experienced to
date. Even the fall of Moscow
would not be as critical a blow.
But Moscow seems to be holding
out and shows every sign of contin
uing to do so. At any rate, opera
tions on the central front have bog
ged down considerably in the past
week, and the Russians now claim
that they arc counter-attacking suc
cessfully in several points.
