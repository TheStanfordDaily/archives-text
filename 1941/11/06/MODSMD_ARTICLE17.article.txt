# Stanford Court Favors Airlines
## 
### 
The Supreme Court of Stanford
decided in favor of Unified Airlines
in the first of two hearings last
night in the semi-finals of the an
nual Moot Court competition of the
law school. The question decided
was the constitutionality of a tax
levied by the State of Stanford upon
interstate airline traffic.
Attorneys for the defendant air
line were Dean Johnson and Jack
Laney. Johnson stressed the fact
that if the court held with the state,
then that would be giving the state
too much control over interstate
commerce.
FACTS OVER LOGIC
Representing the taxing state were
Robert Curtiss and Norman Chung,
whose brief proved to be weighted
down with too much philosophical
classroom logic to effectively com
bat the constant stream of facts of
fered by Johnson and Laney.
Acting as judges for the hearing
were Professor Arthur M. Cathcart,
professor emeritus of Stanford, now
professor of law at Hastings College,
and his sons Robert S. Cathcart and
Wallace D. Cathcart, both practicing
law in San Francisco.
TWO TAXES LEVIED
The Unified Airlines, Inc., con
ducted an interstate passenger and
freight service with one regular air
field in the State of Stanford. The
state levied two taxes which the air
line refused to pay on the ground
that they violated the commerce and
due process clauses of the federal
Constitution.
The trial court found the taxes
valid and ordered the airline to pay.
The present hearing reversed the de
cision of the lower court and de
cided in favor of the airline.
The attorneys were all third-year
law students, in their second year of
moot court competition. From last
night's hearing and the last semi
final hearing Monday, four men will
be selected to compete in the finals
in spring quarter.
