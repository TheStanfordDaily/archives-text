hundreds of Row cars.

tored aristocracy" are asked to turn
their cars face outward on Lasuen
with their lights turned on. No

Row, thence by the Library, and end
up on the floor of the Pavilion,
where the rally will begin promptly

coach, Harry Shipkey, will be on
the stage with-the varsity.

men will troop over to Roble for
their annual serenade of the belles
