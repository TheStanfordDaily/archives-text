### United Press 
Army authorities were ordered to
commandeer seven divisions of Air
Associates in an extension of the
government's intervention at the
Bendix, N.J., central unit after the
management failed to co-operate in
settlement of a C.1.0. strike. The
new divisions were at Lodi and
Belleville, N.J.; Rockford and Chi
cago, 111.; Dallas, Tex.; Marshall, Mo.,
and Los Angeles.
Striking welders began returning
to work in the Puget Sound area
while in Los Angeles striking weld
ers voted almost unanimously last
night to return to work immediately
at shipyards here pending media
tion of their demands for recogni
tion by other craft unions.

Rowing is the oldest of organized
college sports.
