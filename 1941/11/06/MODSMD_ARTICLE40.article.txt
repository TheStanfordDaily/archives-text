# LAVAL RECEIVES U.P. WHITER
## 
### 

IN THE FIRST PICTURE since he was shot by a would-be assassin
in Versailles last August, former French Premier Pierre Laval (with
cane) appears a bit drawn and noticeably thinner. He is shown in the
garden of his medieval castle near Vichy, with United Press Corre
spondent Ralph Heinzcn, right, and daughter and son-in-law, Countess
Jose and Count Rene de Chamhrun.
