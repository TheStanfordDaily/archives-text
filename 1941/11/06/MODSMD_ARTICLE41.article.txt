# Cinch Notices Loom Black In Activity-Jammed Future

### JIM WUENSCHEL 
"Mid-quarter reports on scholarship shall he obtained from all in
structors, and students reported as doing unsatisfactory work shall be noti
fied of their deficiencies" —so runs the old saying from the faculty
regulations.
This is the week of the Southern Cal game. Also the week of the Pa-

jamarino, Red Cross Drive and
dry other meetings of the many
committees without portfolios. Also,
unfortunately, this is the week for
mid-quarters.
Smoke-ups, cinch notices or what
ever else you call those little blue
cards that give you a clutching feel
ing about the heart will soon be in
the mail. This is the week. And
after the blue cards comes the penny
postcard asking you to come, but
soon, to your respective Dean's office,
OLD CUSTOM
Stanford's custom of sending out
mid-quarter deficiency notices dates
back to the years when the Univer
sity was on the semester system in
stead of the quarter plan.
In 1917, the study system at Stan
ford was reorganized and the quarter
system was adopted. But unfortu
nately or not, the system of sending
in reports clung on like the last leaf.
But it still comes back to the
freshmen studying their Western
Civ, sophomores studying Econ or
Poli Sci and upperclassmen doing
most anything at this stage, for their
mid-quarters come right in the midst
of football, the Gaieties, and the
Rally Committee meetings, to men
tion a few.
SUGGESTED REMEDIES
Suggested remedies are a closed
week-end about this time and then
regular days for the tests which
could come during the class period.
But what about Saturday's football
game? And all the other things that
happen on a football week-end?
But the one comforting note this
troublesome week is from the office
of the Scholarship Committee. They
are anticipating about the usual
number of smokeups, football season
and everything else included. See
you in the Dean's office.

OLD CUSTOM
Stanford's custom of sending out
mid-quarter deficiency notices dates
back to the years when the Univer
sity was on the semester system in
stead of the quarter plan.
In 1917, the study system at Stan
ford was reorganized and the quarter
system was adopted. But unfortu
nately or not, the system of sending
in reports clung on like the last leaf.
But it still comes back to the
freshmen studying their Western
Civ, sophomores studying Econ or
Poli Sci and upperclassmen doing
most anything at this stage, for their
mid-quarters come right in the midst
of football, the Gaieties, and the
Rally Committee meetings, to men
tion a few.
SUGGESTED REMEDIES
Suggested remedies are a closed
week-end about this time and then
regular days for the tests which
could come during the class period.
But what about Saturday's football
game? And all the other things that
happen on a football week-end?
But the one comforting note this
troublesome week is from the office
of the Scholarship Committee. They
are anticipating about the usual
number of smokeups, football season
and everything else included. See
you in the Dean's office.
"Mid-quarter reports on scholarship shall he obtained from all in
structors, and students reported as doing unsatisfactory work shall be noti
fied of their deficiencies" —so runs the old saying from the faculty
regulations.
This is the week of the Southern Cal game. Also the week of the Pa-

jamarino, Red Cross Drive and
dry other meetings of the many
committees without portfolios. Also,
unfortunately, this is the week for
mid-quarters.
Smoke-ups, cinch notices or what
ever else you call those little blue
cards that give you a clutching feel
ing about the heart will soon be in
the mail. This is the week. And
after the blue cards comes the penny
postcard asking you to come, but
