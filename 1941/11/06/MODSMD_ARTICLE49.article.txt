## 
###

On the first play of the game, Pol
lard pulled down a high flip from
Jack Clark to run 70 yards and

the third play Clark again tossed in
the general direction of Pollard,
who stretched above the helpless
Toros and obtained six points. Clark
passed a safe extra to John Leddy.
TORO POPS BACK
Toro popped back into the picture
sparked by the brilliant play of
back Bob Montgomery. A 40-yard
pass from Montgomery to Bob Mor
ton was good for six points toward
the end of the half, but the conver

half Toro threatened, using the pass
ing of Montgomery on every play.
The Deke pass defense relaxed con
siderably, but the Toro ends forced
the drives by dropping passes. As
