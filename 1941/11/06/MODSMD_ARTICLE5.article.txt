### 
In the meeting of the Interfraternity Board of Control of November 4
the Chi Psi fraternity was penalized for an infraction of the rushing rules.
The infraction was of a technical nature, and in justice to the Chi Psi
fraternity it should be known that there was no serious intent to rush
illegally. In order to clear up any misunderstanding that may arise now
or in the future as a consequence of action of this nature it is our pur
pose to present here the stand of the Interfraternity Board of Control
on these matters.
For many years now the rushing system of Stanford fraternities has
been criticized because lack of enforcement of its rules led to numerous
violations. During the course of these years every fraternity on the campus
has at one time or another complained bitterly about the inequality created
fiy the abuse of the rushing rules. There can fie no doubt about the
justification of these complaintsâ€”abuse of the rushing rules does create
unhealthy inequality.
This year the Interfraternity Council (composed of the presidents of
Stanford fraternities) resolved to alleviate this condition. Consequently,
ths body not only approved of the rushing rules, but also determined to
give them strength by recommending strict enforcement. 'Ihe Interfra
ternity Board of Control acting on this recommendation decided to take
immediate and effective action on any rushing rule violations brought to
its attention.
The action taken on this first infraction should indicate to all fraternity
men that the Board of Control is ready to back them in eliminating these
abuses. The rushing rules are clear and specific, and it is (he obligation
of every present and prospective fraternity man to understand and abide
liy them. Therefore, ignorance of the rules cannot be an excuse for in
fraction.
It is particularly vital to the success of the new deferred rushing pro
gram that fraternity men co-operate in living up to the rules. Fraternity
men were unanimously in favor of this program and all agreed if it was
to lie a success the rules must he adhered to. Consequently, it is difficult
to understand why there should be any infractions. If there arc any,
however, the Board stands ready to penalize the infracting house and
penalize it severely.
