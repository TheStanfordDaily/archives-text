# Girl's-Eye View of Gridiron Reveals Queens Ooze Spirit
## 
### SUSIE FARMERETTE 
(Editor's note: Feeling that women perhaps have different views on this
game of football, we herewith present the following article by a Stanford
woman.)

I am a Stanford woman. I go by many names—coed, queen, and, sad
but true, bag. Stanford is the stamping ground of what the sports writers
are calling these days "the Rose liowl Champs." (Two years ago it was
something different.) Therefore, I have had cultivated within me a great

and overpowering love of the game..
I literally ooze with spirit.
Around about every other Satur
day afternoon, I take my pompon,
cigarettes, etc., in hand and trek to
the stadium. With the ordeal of
being seated behind me, I wait with
bated breath for the great moment —
the sublime second when all the
players trot onto the field in their
lovely clean white pants and crim
son sweaters.
OH, WHAT LUNGS!
Then, my time has come. I rise
and add my mezzo-soprano to the
mighty roar. There is nothing I like
better to do than yell, and looking
about me, I realize that I am not
alone. The Stanford woman has a
mighty pair of lungs and she cer
tainly knows how to use them. I
know.
From here on in, all is a little
vague. The kickoff impresses me
most—it's so symmetrical and you
can see what everyone is doing. It's
when they all get down and pile
into one another that I become con
fused. I have difficulty locating
that player with number—well, with
a particular number on his jersey.
HANKIE DROPPER
Much stress seems to be laid on
downs and the significance usually
eludes me. I never know what we
are being penalized for because the
person in front of me is standing at
that moment. I am still waiting to
see the referee—or is it umpire—
drop his handkerchief.
Aside from all this, there is a
particular point about football as
it is being played this season that
causes me no little worry. They put
one man in and take him out so
often that all that running back and
forth from the bench must wear him
to a frazzle. I can't understand
how he can give his all with the
boys out there when he spends so

much time sprinting on entirely su
perfluous errands.
Finally, I leave the stadium de
cidedly disconcerted. The referee's
time out always seems to be for one
purpose and one purpose only and
I do really think that it is a little
intimate for a man to change his
pants in front of 40,000 people—
particularly, right below the WOM
EN'S rooting section-

Philadelphia, of the American
League, has had more members re
ceive the "most valuable player"
award than any other baseball team.

alone. The Stanford woman has a
mighty pair of lungs and she cer
tainly knows how to use them. I
know.
From here on in, all is a little
vague. The kickoff impresses me
most—it's so symmetrical and you
can see what everyone is doing. It's
when they all get down and pile
into one another that I become con
fused. I have difficulty locating
that player with number—well, with
a particular number on his jersey.

Much stress seems to be laid on
downs and the significance usually
eludes me. I never know what we
are being penalized for because the
person in front of me is standing at
that moment. I am still waiting to
see the referee—or is it umpire—
drop his handkerchief.
Aside from all this, there is a
particular point about football as
it is being played this season that
causes me no little worry. They put
one man in and take him out so
often that all that running back and
forth from the bench must wear him
to a frazzle. I can't understand
how he can give his all with the
boys out there when he spends so

much time sprinting on entirely su
perfluous errands.
Finally, I leave the stadium de
cidedly disconcerted. The referee's
time out always seems to be for one
purpose and one purpose only and
I do really think that it is a little
intimate for a man to change his
pants in front of 40,000 people—
particularly, right below the WOM
EN'S rooting section-

Philadelphia, of the American
League, has had more members re
ceive the "most valuable player"
award than any other baseball team.
(Editor's note: Feeling that women perhaps have different views on this
game of football, we herewith present the following article by a Stanford
woman.)

I am a Stanford woman. I go by many names—coed, queen, and, sad
but true, bag. Stanford is the stamping ground of what the sports writers
are calling these days "the Rose liowl Champs." (Two years ago it was
something different.) Therefore, I have had cultivated within me a great

and overpowering love of the game..
I literally ooze with spirit.
Around about every other Satur
day afternoon, I take my pompon,
cigarettes, etc., in hand and trek to
the stadium. With the ordeal of
being seated behind me, I wait with
bated breath for the great moment —
the sublime second when all the
players trot onto the field in their
lovely clean white pants and crim
son sweaters.
OH, WHAT LUNGS!
Then, my time has come. I rise
and add my mezzo-soprano to the
mighty roar. There is nothing I like
better to do than yell, and looking
about me, I realize that I am not
alone. The Stanford woman has a
mighty pair of lungs and she cer
tainly knows how to use them. I
