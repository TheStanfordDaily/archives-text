# Track Squads Train for Ucla
## 
### 
The varsity cross-country team, in
anticipation of the coming U.C.L.A.
meet, got down to heavy training in
earnest yesterday afternoon when
they ran their first four-mile inter
squad race of the season. The time
for the event, run over the Stanford
j golf course, was 24:51.5.
Leading the way across the finish
marker was Francis Olsen, with
Larry Gray, freshman harrier, fol
lowing in second place. Trailing be
| hind these two were Wyland Cripe,
Jim Disher and Allen Rosenfeld.
Due to the failure of the Olympic
Club to show up on last Saturday
the varsity will go into the U.C.L.A.
meet a week from Saturday un
tested and thus unproven. Last year
U.C.L.A. won by one point and the
varsity will be out to avenge this
defeat.
The track team this year has de
voted itself so far mainly to getting
into condition. The rainy weather
has also hampered them and it has
been impossible to obtain any times
indicative of the true merits of the
men.

pionship was won by 14-year-old
