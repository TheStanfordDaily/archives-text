# Frosh Gridders Prep for Little Big Game Tilt
## 
### 
Harry Sliipkey's first unit of the
freshman football team got a look at
Cat plays yesterday in a workout on
a still muddy field.
The first stringers scrimmaged
against third and fourth stringers
minus the services of Jim McCurdy,
who will be out of the Little Big
Game Saturday. McCurdy's first re
placement, Neele Johnston, will also
be missing when the frosh meet the
Cal babes, so Shipkey is left with
two centers, Pete August, a made
over end ,and Frank Moultin.
The backfield is full of choices at
all positions with Jim Pettit alone
having a strangle-hold on his half
back slot.
BATTLE FOR FULL
At full, Dave Pate and Don Zap
pettini are battling it out. Zap and
Dave proved great mudders in last
week's victory over San Mateo. Pate
has held a slight edge so far this
season. At quarter Shipkey likes
Bobby Andrews, flashy back from
South Pasadena, but Cannon Park
inson seems to be the better signal
caller and is a sensational passer.
Fred Sanderman was carried off the
field last week but was out at prac
tice last night. He and Fred Par
sons are candidates for the other
halfback position.
A reserve team that included
Johnny Eliel, Sandy Banks, and Ed
Taylor ran through all passing plays
yesterday against a sketchy defense
composed of Jimmy Coffis, Tex Car
vey, and the injured McCurdy.
CAL CUBS GOOD
The first unit, however, is hard at
work, for the Cal team is one of the
best in Berkeley's history. Little
Jack Clifford, 150-lb. demon, is back
in harness again and is ready to get
in Stanford's hair. The Cubs have
smashed San Francisco J.C., the
Trojan flash, and a McClellan team
which included Jim Kisselburg in
its backfield.
