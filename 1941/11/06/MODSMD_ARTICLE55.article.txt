# Farm Splashers To Play U.C.L.A.
## 
### 
Along with most of the Stanford
campus, Stanford's varsity water
polo team will entrain tonight for a
"crucial" two-game series against
Southern California and U.C.LA.
Coach Norton Thornton's big
game will be against the unbeaten
U.C.LA. Bruins in the Westwood
plunge, Saturday morning at 10. The
Indian mermen must defeat the
Bruins to get at least a tie for first
place in conference standings.
Off a previous 8-6 win over U.S.C.,
Stanford is favored to top the Tro
jans, who have lost all three of their
conference games this season.
