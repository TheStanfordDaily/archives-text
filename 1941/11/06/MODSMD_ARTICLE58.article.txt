# Draft Hits Red Machine; Albert Passes Physical; 'Kmet,' Francis in Line
## 
### 
It has finally come.
Frankie Albert took his physical exam for the draft last Thursday and
apparently has no disabilities to keep him from becoming one of that great
army of American youth now in the army.
'I'llis blow bit Clark Shaughnessy's team in the midst of its prepara-

lions for Saturday's struggle with
Southern California's Trojans in
Los Angeles.
However, there is still more to
come. Pete Kmetovic, Jack Fran
cis, and Ed McCain are in line for
their examinations within the next
two weeks.
ALBERT CAPTAIN
Albeit, who has been made cap
tain for the Trojan game, as signal
caller, passer, and punter for the T,
earned the ranking of AU-Ameri
can last year and is on his way to
similar honors this year.
The four men who have been
served notice may not even be able
to play in the Rose Bowl game, pro
viding Stanford earns the bid.
Kmetovie, tailback for the Cards, is
one of the most elusive runners in
the country, while both McCain and
Francis are versatile linemen who,
when important cogs were injured,
have filled in gaps in the Indian
forward wall admirably.
DUMMY SCRIMMAGE
Meanwhile, the team continued its
pre-Trojan drills, working against
the "blacks" on defense and then
running offensive maenuvers in
dummy scrimmage. For a time the
second and third string backfields
ran plays behind the first string for
wards.
Eric "Iloot" Armstrong, No. 1
right halfback, who has been out for
several days with a severe charley
hor.se, was back in uniform yester
day afternoon and took a slight
workout.
The team will leave Palo Alto to
night at. 8:40 for the Southland.
Coach Shaughnessy is taking the
entire squad, which numbers more
than 50 men, down for the game.
The last time Stanford's varsity
football team played the Trojans
only two blocks from their campus,
the Indians went down to a 33 to 0
defeat. That was in 1939 before the
influx of the "Wonder Worker from
Chicago" and his T.
