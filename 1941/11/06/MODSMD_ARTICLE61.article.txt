# Allison Fears 'Bad Attitude' for Game
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 5 (UP).â€”Coach
Stub Allison today said he feared
two impressive wins had given his
University of California football
team a "bad attitude" for the Wash
ington game and ordered an extra
practice for tomorrow. The squad
was sore from a hard scrimmage
Tuesday and did not scrimmage to
day. The only doubtful starter on
the varsity Saturday is Stu Lewis,
left end, who has a leg injury.

Night baseball was first played in
he major leagues in 1935.
