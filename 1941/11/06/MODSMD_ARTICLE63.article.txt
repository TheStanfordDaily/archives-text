### DON SELBY 
Bob Robertson and Paul Taylor have been receiving all the
publicity -ol" nearly all of it—down Southern California way, two
other backs who have the stuff to come through have gone unheralded.
They are Mel Blocker and Mickey Anderson.
Bleeker, as most of the juniors on the Stanford outfit will remember,
was the boy who caused them so much trouble when, in 1939, the U.S.C.
yearlings set the Papoose eleven down with its only defeat of the year,
j the score being 13-22.
Up until the battle with the Trobabes, Harry Shipkey's crew had moved
through all oppositon with the greatest of ease. The Papeese that year
were composed of such ball players as Hank Norberg, Chuck Taylor,
Bruno Banducci, Dick Palmer, Ed Stamm, Al Cole, Milt Vucinich, Eric
Armstrong, Bill Symes, and a number of other good boys.
But this boy Bleeker didn't know that those boys were going to be
come an integral part of the "Wow Boy" eleven of the next season. So he

huffed and he puffed, and he knocked
the flush's undefeated record right
j off the map, scoring both U.S.C.
j touchdowns and generally giving
the liltle Indians a bad afternoon.
Bleeker has been bothered with
injuries this season, but reports
J from the Southland say that he is
in good shape for Saturday's game.
Maybe he'll be able to give Taylor
j and the other boys a rough time
[ again. Maybe.
* * *
r p , HAT same afternoon in that same
| stadium, we watched the Trojan
varsity overwhelm a valiant Illinois
j team. And, although he wasn't the
! outstanding man on the field, Mickey
Anderson did some great running.
Anderson, the brother of George
Anderson, California's former sprint
star, is also a trackman and a good
one, which is partly why Clark
Shaughnessy is doing so much "fear
ing" this week. And as long as he
fears Anderson's speed, he has a
very good basis, for there's no de
nying that the boy is fast.

If the Trojans ever get in a position to use him the way they did
against Illini that day in the Coliseum, and if he gets the help lhat he did
thai day, it's not unlikely that Shaughnessy's fears will turn into reality.
But that's not saying that the men from Troy will win.

W/'RITING about that freshman football team of 1939 brings to mind the
idea that a team that is defeated often has more outstanding players
on it than some outfits with unblemished records—even though the opposi
tion may be of the same caliber.
For instance, that Papoose outfit put Banducci, Taylor, Stamm. Vucinich,
and Armstrong on this year's first string. The undefeated freshman team
of the year before, the one that was headed by Albert and Kmetovic. has
only those two boys and Freddie Meyer on this season's number one eleven.
And the latest undefeated Stanford freshman team, the 1940 aggregation,
is represented by Loren LaPrade. Vic Lindskog and Arnie Meiners, the
other two first-stringers, didn't play on any of the three aforementioned
freshman squads. Lindskog transferred to Stanford, while Meiners played
1 reshman ball in 1937, with Norm Standlee & Co., which wasn't one of
Shipkey's undefeated clubs.

r p , HAT same afternoon in that same
| stadium, we watched the Trojan
varsity overwhelm a valiant Illinois
j team. And, although he wasn't the
! outstanding man on the field, Mickey
Anderson did some great running.
Anderson, the brother of George
Anderson, California's former sprint
star, is also a trackman and a good
one, which is partly why Clark
Shaughnessy is doing so much "fear
ing" this week. And as long as he
fears Anderson's speed, he has a
very good basis, for there's no de
nying that the boy is fast.

If the Trojans ever get in a position to use him the way they did
against Illini that day in the Coliseum, and if he gets the help lhat he did
thai day, it's not unlikely that Shaughnessy's fears will turn into reality.
But that's not saying that the men from Troy will win.

W/'RITING about that freshman football team of 1939 brings to mind the
idea that a team that is defeated often has more outstanding players
on it than some outfits with unblemished records—even though the opposi
tion may be of the same caliber.
For instance, that Papoose outfit put Banducci, Taylor, Stamm. Vucinich,
and Armstrong on this year's first string. The undefeated freshman team
of the year before, the one that was headed by Albert and Kmetovic. has
only those two boys and Freddie Meyer on this season's number one eleven.
And the latest undefeated Stanford freshman team, the 1940 aggregation,
is represented by Loren LaPrade. Vic Lindskog and Arnie Meiners, the
other two first-stringers, didn't play on any of the three aforementioned
freshman squads. Lindskog transferred to Stanford, while Meiners played
1 reshman ball in 1937, with Norm Standlee & Co., which wasn't one of
Shipkey's undefeated clubs.


BRUNO BANDUCCI
Bob Robertson and Paul Taylor have been receiving all the
publicity -ol" nearly all of it—down Southern California way, two
other backs who have the stuff to come through have gone unheralded.
They are Mel Blocker and Mickey Anderson.
Bleeker, as most of the juniors on the Stanford outfit will remember,
was the boy who caused them so much trouble when, in 1939, the U.S.C.
yearlings set the Papoose eleven down with its only defeat of the year,
j the score being 13-22.
Up until the battle with the Trobabes, Harry Shipkey's crew had moved
through all oppositon with the greatest of ease. The Papeese that year
were composed of such ball players as Hank Norberg, Chuck Taylor,
Bruno Banducci, Dick Palmer, Ed Stamm, Al Cole, Milt Vucinich, Eric
Armstrong, Bill Symes, and a number of other good boys.
But this boy Bleeker didn't know that those boys were going to be
come an integral part of the "Wow Boy" eleven of the next season. So he

huffed and he puffed, and he knocked
the flush's undefeated record right
j off the map, scoring both U.S.C.
j touchdowns and generally giving
