# Redskin Water Poloists Leave Tonight for Southland Frays
## 
### 
Along with the football team, Stanford's varsity water polo team en
trains t; night for the sunny Southland where they will tangle with the
Southern California Trojans Friday afternoon at 3 and the U.C.L.A. Bruins
Saturday morning at 10 in two very important games.
"Crucial" is an understatement of the importance of the Bruin fracas.

Coach Norton Thornton's mermen
must defeat Bob Parks'' Westwood
swimmers to stay in the conference
race.
Holding a 10 to 6 victory over
Stanford here, the Bruins are unde
feated this year. Boasting a pair of
sharpshooting all - conference for
wards in Johnny Segale and Bill
Mitchell, the Bruins are plenty
strong offensively, according to
Coach Thornton.
NEW COMBINATION
Experimenting with a new for
ward combination of Grant Culley,
recently discovered sophomore scor
ing ace. and Bert Singer, made-over
goalie, Thornton is trying to add
some needed scoring punch.
It was in the last Bruin game that
Culley first came through to lead
an Indian comeback in the second
half that closed up the score from
8 to 2 to 10 to 6.
It was also in the last Bruin game
that Segale and Mitchell showed why
they are all - conference players.
Mitchell ran wild, scoring six points,
aided by the acurate feeding of Se
gale, who marked up four points in
his own name.
LEE TO PLAY
Against the Bruin attack. Thorn
ton will have his dependable de
fensive backfield of center back Jack
Bleecker, guards Bob Jones and
Frank Mitchell, and goalie Pete Lee.
Mitchell, an all-conference man him
self, has been out with a cold but
should be ready to play Saturday.
Although Stanford is concentrat
ing on U.C.L.A., the Trojans are no
pushover. The Indians edged them
out, 8 to 6. two weeks ago in a
tough scramble.
The Trojans broke even with Cali
fornia last week and are currently
residing in third place in the con
ference. Lacking outstanding stars,
the Trojans have a fast-moving, all
around team.

Bleecker, guards Bob Jones and
Frank Mitchell, and goalie Pete Lee.
Mitchell, an all-conference man him
self, has been out with a cold but
should be ready to play Saturday.
Although Stanford is concentrat
ing on U.C.L.A., the Trojans are no
pushover. The Indians edged them
out, 8 to 6. two weeks ago in a
tough scramble.
The Trojans broke even with Cali
fornia last week and are currently
residing in third place in the con
ference. Lacking outstanding stars,
the Trojans have a fast-moving, all
around team.

CORVALLIS, Ore.. Nov. 5 (UP).—
! Jim Dixon, Oregon State College
line coach, who scouted the Cali
-1 fornia-U.C.L.A. game in Los Ange
; les lasl week, today predicted a wide
open game here Saturday when the
; Beavers meet the Bruins. Dixon
warned that the Uclans have the
: "most powerful offense on the Coast."
Along with the football team, Stanford's varsity water polo team en
trains t; night for the sunny Southland where they will tangle with the
Southern California Trojans Friday afternoon at 3 and the U.C.L.A. Bruins
Saturday morning at 10 in two very important games.
"Crucial" is an understatement of the importance of the Bruin fracas.

Coach Norton Thornton's mermen
must defeat Bob Parks'' Westwood
swimmers to stay in the conference
race.
Holding a 10 to 6 victory over
Stanford here, the Bruins are unde
feated this year. Boasting a pair of
sharpshooting all - conference for
wards in Johnny Segale and Bill
Mitchell, the Bruins are plenty
strong offensively, according to
Coach Thornton.
NEW COMBINATION
Experimenting with a new for
ward combination of Grant Culley,
recently discovered sophomore scor
ing ace. and Bert Singer, made-over
goalie, Thornton is trying to add
some needed scoring punch.
It was in the last Bruin game that
Culley first came through to lead
an Indian comeback in the second
half that closed up the score from
8 to 2 to 10 to 6.
It was also in the last Bruin game
that Segale and Mitchell showed why
they are all - conference players.
Mitchell ran wild, scoring six points,
aided by the acurate feeding of Se
gale, who marked up four points in
his own name.
LEE TO PLAY
Against the Bruin attack. Thorn
ton will have his dependable de
fensive backfield of center back Jack
Bleecker, guards Bob Jones and
Frank Mitchell, and goalie Pete Lee.
