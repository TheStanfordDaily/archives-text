# We ... Who Are Adout To Die

### 
MORE than a thousand Stanford students . . .
all hitting the road between here and Los
Angeles ... a hearty shout and a wave when
we pass another Stanford car . . . spirits high
with football fever . . . zooming along traffic
filled highways ... a crash . . . the hooded
figure of Death, keeper of the highways, chalks
up another victim.
Maybe that mangled mass of flesh and bone
carelessly tossed by Death to the roadside was
the fellow going the other way. But rnaybe he
was that fellow with the new convertible just
down the hall from us.
A thousand Stanford students on the high
ways . . . eight hundred miles of just batting
along ... the odds are pretty favorable that most
of us will come back alive . . . but Death won t
take a holiday over this week-end. in fact he'll
put on extra help . . . and he's not particular
whether or not wo go to Stanford ... if the odds
are a thousand to one. there's nothing in the
books to say that you or I won't be that one.
Statistics on the number of people who die
violent deaths on the nation's highways each
day don't mean much to us unless they hit
close, unless it's a fraternity brother, a class
mate.
You can slam the door and roll up the window
in Death's face by driving safely and sanely,
observing the laws; but even that won't keep
him out. There's always the other fellow. A
good motto is to regard everyone else on the
road as a damned fool.
But some of us don't even take the precau
tion of slamming the door in his face. We let
the old right foot lean pretty heavily on the
gas pedal; we're careless; we might stop aong
the way for a drink; we drive along, nose high,
contemptuous of the law except when spotted
in the mirror; we drive cars mechanically im
perfect; we drive when we are too tired and
sleepy to have control of our senses.
Any one of these things some of us might do
is an urgent invitation to Death to join our party.
And don't think that he'll be slow in accepting
the date.
Sometimes the extra help he gets for the
week-ends isn't quite as efficient as boss Death
himself. They do a sloppy job and leave their
victim to suffer in hospitals, disfigured or dis
abled for life.
There'll be "victory" headlines in Monday's
Daily, we're sure.
But, we hope, no "victim" headlines.
