winVERYONE seemed to have fun, even those
XL people that finally gave up the idea of
trying to dance on the too-small floor and re
sorted to playing bridge," reported the student
body manager of the first Big Game Dance in
1939.

One year later the next student manager
wrote, "Hear ye, hear ye —to whom it may con
cern. The second annual Big Game Dance was
held after the Cal game —as usual—and the
same criticism of the first dance may again be
aired, namely, there was still not enough space
at the San Francisco Country Club."
And just a week ago when the Big Game
Dance committee announced the formal will
bo held at the same place this year, moans and
groans were heard throughout campus. Down
town bootie shops reported a rush on cleated
shoes. Men and women began to train for the
ordeal, walking on nails, dropping weights on
their feet, and scrimmaging with the varsity
gridders.
Such training, however, will be to no avail.
There will be plenty of foot room the night
o( November 29, when Stanford celebrates re
tention of the Axe for another year.
Three ballrooms at the Country Club have
been rented. An excellent loudspeaking sys
tem will be used. And precautions will be taken
to separate the most enjoyable honky-tonk
rhythms of Lu Watters from the sweet music
of Gene Englander.
After a nerve-racking afternoon in the Sta
dium, celebrants may be assured of sufficient
room to wear themselves out in the evening
