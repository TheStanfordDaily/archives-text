# No Longer Defunct
## 
### 
EX COMMITTEE Tuesday night gave Axe So
ciety two quarters of grace to get itself re
organized and to convince the student govern
ing body that the society will maintain itself
as an active student organization.
Unfortunately last year several circumstances
combined to drag Axe Society down into the
depths of inactivity.

Ex Committee's "Defunct Organizations Com
mittee" found a happy hunting ground in Axe
Society. It was really defunct.
But the senior men who were in the society
last year realized that there was some purpose
to the organization and that an intensive effort
should be made to resuscitate it. They met last
week and elected the new members who should
have been taken into the group last spring.
They will soon hold another meeting with
all the new members and elect officers.
We hope that with new blood Axe Society
will again regain its former prestige.
