# BULL SESSION

### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
I DON'T LIKE IT

d iNE Tri-Delt stepped innocently to the gate and
presented her ticket. The gateman growled, "Are
you the person on the card?"
"Yes, and my Bawlout average is 5)4 plus 102. And
I live at the Tri-Delt house, whose president is So
and So."
"Oh, memorizing it, eh? We'll have to hold you
here to check on this."
That was written lay Bud Ames, in (his same col
umn almost a year ago. When I read it 1 thought it
was funny, but probably a little exaggerated. But they
have started the thing again. They still think check
ing is a good idea. For the same thing as the above
quotation happened at last Saturday's game, but in
this case it was a man, a man who has been in this
school for four years. But. that didn't make any dif
ference. The bull at the gate glared at him and said,
"Memorizing it, eh? We'll have to check on you."

AS EVERYONE knows, we're paying for those games.
We have a right to show our cards and walk in
without always getting accused of cheating by those
B.A.C. thugs. And in many cases, the card cheeking
causes rooters to miss the kickofT, which is one of
the best plays to watch. There's no reason why stu
dents who arc not cheating, who have not loaned
their cards out, who are not using a borrowed card,
who have been good all morning, should be forced to
stand and argue with a couple of goats with B.A.C.
written on their arms, while inside the stadium Kmeto
vic is swerving his hips down the sidelines.
And say that a couple of students decide they don't
want to go to the game. What is wrong with letting
one of their friends, or a friend of one of their friends
use the ticket? The seat is paid for. We have to pay
for every game that's played when wc come to the
University. We pay for that little block of wood and
we should be allowed to fill it in any way that we
want, either with our own bodies or with a friend's
body. But the B.A.C. doesn't like this because they
would be out a couple hundred dollars, because these
friends would have to buy tickets if they weren t al
lowed in the rooting section. And the B.A.C. will not
lose money even if it has to check every card, every
signature, every name, every address of every rooter
that gets into the section.

IP' THE B.A.C. is so eager to see justice done, why
don't they refund money to the students who are
not going to use their student body cards. Then in
stead of loaning the cards out, the students would turn
them in. But again with a set-up like this, the B.A.C.
would be losing money, and in this particular case it
doesn't care to see justice done.
And one other thing. Aren't we supposed to have
some kind of an honor code around this school? If the
officials of the school have no confidence in the code,
how can it be expected of students to take the thing
seriously?
