CIII I'SI LETTER

r IMIE EDITOR, SIR:
We arc fully aware that we have broken one of
the vital rules of the Interfraternity Board of Control
...not intentionally... hut nevertheless wc have brok
en it. We arc not opposed to being fined for our trans
gression.
What we are somewhat bitter about is the way The
Daily handled the situation. None of the facts against
the house were «iven. In The Daily's editorial on the
subject (yesterday) wc feel that an unjust insinuation
was made without presenting the facts.
The faet that Ted Moreno and his brother share a
grey Plymouth car was not mentioned. That Ted's
brother, who lives in Encina, asked to use the commun
ity sedan was not mentioned. A committee of three
Chi Psis was not sent down to Encina to rush hell out
of the freshman. All three of the Row men had known
the freshman long before Stanford.
They went down to Encina in an open way, shouted
at him from the Bull Pen in a loud, clear voiec, and
then sinee they all had to go down town, they went
together. This is their offense.
We admit that wc broke the rules. We admit that
we are liable to the just fine which we were given.
But wc do think that The Daily handled the situation
incorrectly.
Instead of, as The Daily would have you believe, a
commission of three Chi Psis rushing up and down the
halls of Encina with a handful of pledge buttons, chas
ing down and nailing the terrified freshman, Ted went
to see his brother Dick.
An annoyed Chi Psi
Editor's note: We are glad to learn why and how
the Chi Psi rushing regulation infraction occurred.
We believe everyone is convinced it was not inten
tional. We also believe The Daily did not handle
the situation "incorrectly," and that there was no
statement or innuendo in yesterday's editorial
which painted the picture described in the last para
graph of the above letter. Wc said, "In fairness to
the Chi Psis, perhaps we can presume they were
ignorant of the rushing rules. Perhaps they were
not." We hope the student body realizes the vio
lation was unintentional. This would indicate the
Chi Psis did not know the rules. As the Interfra
ternity Board of Control states on page 1 this
morning. "• • • ignorance of the rules cannot be an
excuse for infraction." (See story giving rush rules
on page I).

DANIKL SAID IT

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
The words of the "mysterious" slicker which, it
appears, has baffled students and faculty alike, were
those interpreted by the? prophet Daniel to the King
of Babylon. "Mene, Mene, Tekcl (not terkel) Uphar
son" appeared as the handwriting on the wall and
meant, briefly, that Belshazzar's reign was ended, his
downfall at hand.
The general bewilderment may be accounted for,
in part, by the fact that the Bible, no longer regarded
at Stanford as an outstanding piece of literature, was
transferred a number of years ago from the Univer
sity Library to Memorial Church.
While sharing heartily the wish of the stickers
originator for the immediate and complete downfall
of the Trojans, we can't condone the use of the Bible
as a source for football slogans.

CIII I'SI LETTER

r IMIE EDITOR, SIR:
We arc fully aware that we have broken one of
the vital rules of the Interfraternity Board of Control
...not intentionally... hut nevertheless wc have brok
en it. We arc not opposed to being fined for our trans
gression.
What we are somewhat bitter about is the way The
Daily handled the situation. None of the facts against
the house were «iven. In The Daily's editorial on the
subject (yesterday) wc feel that an unjust insinuation
was made without presenting the facts.
The faet that Ted Moreno and his brother share a
grey Plymouth car was not mentioned. That Ted's
brother, who lives in Encina, asked to use the commun
ity sedan was not mentioned. A committee of three
Chi Psis was not sent down to Encina to rush hell out
of the freshman. All three of the Row men had known
the freshman long before Stanford.
They went down to Encina in an open way, shouted
at him from the Bull Pen in a loud, clear voiec, and
then sinee they all had to go down town, they went
together. This is their offense.
We admit that wc broke the rules. We admit that
we are liable to the just fine which we were given.
But wc do think that The Daily handled the situation
incorrectly.
Instead of, as The Daily would have you believe, a
commission of three Chi Psis rushing up and down the
halls of Encina with a handful of pledge buttons, chas
ing down and nailing the terrified freshman, Ted went
to see his brother Dick.
An annoyed Chi Psi
Editor's note: We are glad to learn why and how
the Chi Psi rushing regulation infraction occurred.
We believe everyone is convinced it was not inten
tional. We also believe The Daily did not handle
the situation "incorrectly," and that there was no
statement or innuendo in yesterday's editorial
which painted the picture described in the last para
graph of the above letter. Wc said, "In fairness to
the Chi Psis, perhaps we can presume they were
ignorant of the rushing rules. Perhaps they were
not." We hope the student body realizes the vio
lation was unintentional. This would indicate the
Chi Psis did not know the rules. As the Interfra
ternity Board of Control states on page 1 this
morning. "• • • ignorance of the rules cannot be an
excuse for infraction." (See story giving rush rules
on page I).

DANIKL SAID IT

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
The words of the "mysterious" slicker which, it
appears, has baffled students and faculty alike, were
those interpreted by the? prophet Daniel to the King
of Babylon. "Mene, Mene, Tekcl (not terkel) Uphar
son" appeared as the handwriting on the wall and
meant, briefly, that Belshazzar's reign was ended, his
downfall at hand.
The general bewilderment may be accounted for,
in part, by the fact that the Bible, no longer regarded
at Stanford as an outstanding piece of literature, was
transferred a number of years ago from the Univer
sity Library to Memorial Church.
