# 'Weekend In Havana' Filled With Latin-American Flavor
## 
### 
"WEEK-END IN HAVANA," now playing at the Fox Stanford Theater
in Palo Alto.
This spicy technicolor musical with a Latin-American flavor, in spite
of having; a rather stereotyped plot, is convincing enough to make you
forget about Hitler, the world situation, and midquarters during the dura-

lion of its showing. <
Twentieth Century-Fox has taken
Carmen Miranda, Alice Faye, Cesar
Romero and John Payne and put
them into a fast moving musical
comedy concerning a "Maey shop
girl" who goes to Havana on the
lookout for night clubs and ro
mance.
Briefly, the plot is this:
A shop girl (Alice Faye) is on
her way to Havana when the boat
goes on a reef. The steamship com
pany lawyer (John Payne) tries to
get her to sign a waiver not to sue
the company, but she says she
won't. She wants her vacation and
besides she has "something on the
captain" -and furthermore she won't
sign until she's thoroughly enjoyed
the trip.
STORY OBVIOUS
I The rest of the story is obvious.
The lawyer is delegated to send the
girl via plane to Cuba and to show
her a good time (but he has a fi
ancee). Then the girl meets a Latin
thrill. Cesar Romero —so what hap
pen??
Alice Faye, in this show-goer's
opinion, never looked more attrac
tive, and isn't compelled to sing once
every reel. This is left to Carmen
Miranda, whom the costumers suc
ceeded ably in not attiring her in
one costume thai had any semblance
of a color combination. At times,
the technicolor when focused on
Carmen was a bit hard on the eyes.
John Payne, as usual, is at his
nonchalant best. However, the di
rectors missed out when they tried
to make him stifT, and aloof to any
one but Miss Faye. Cesar Romero's
role is made to order for him. He
even has the opportunity to rhumba
as well as the movie publicity says
he does. As Payne's fiance, Cobins
Wright Jr. shows that one debutante
in real life can be natural in real
life too.

are not yet prominent on the air
lanes. Doubtlessly, the dance se
quences and the gorgeous costum
ing and settings combined with grea
splashes of color will make "Week
end in Havana" remembered wher
you leave the theater.
"Krakotoa," a long "short" abou
an undersea volcano in eruption is
an interesting companion feature. A

tleman's Gentleman" completes the
bill.—Frease

Twentieth Century-Fox has taken
Carmen Miranda, Alice Faye, Cesar
Romero and John Payne and put
them into a fast moving musical
comedy concerning a "Maey shop
girl" who goes to Havana on the
lookout for night clubs and ro
mance.
Briefly, the plot is this:
A shop girl (Alice Faye) is on
her way to Havana when the boat
goes on a reef. The steamship com
pany lawyer (John Payne) tries to
get her to sign a waiver not to sue
the company, but she says she
won't. She wants her vacation and
besides she has "something on the
captain" -and furthermore she won't
sign until she's thoroughly enjoyed
the trip.
