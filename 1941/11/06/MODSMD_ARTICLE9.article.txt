### 
TOKYO, Thursday, Nov. ti (UP). â€”
Sahuro Krusu, veteran Japanese
diplomat, was flying to Washington
today for a "final desperate effort
to adjust Japan's relations with the
United States and thus avert what
newspapers described as a possible
Japanese - American ciash in the
Pacific Ocean.
His departure was announced yes
terday after a series of conferences
between Foreign Minister Shige
nori Togo and U.S. Ambassador Jo
seph C. Grew.
'THE COLD SHOULDER'
Washington reports say that
Kurusu will find a cool reception
unless Japan is ready to modify
her aggressive policies, reliable
quarters stated tonight. Secretary
of State Cordell Hull was silent on
the envoy's mission.
In the official view Kurusu, who
is due in Washington Nov. 17, will
serve as an assistant to Admiral
Kichisaburo Nomura, Japanese am
bassador in the American capital.
The popular view is that he is a sort
of super-envoy representing Em
peror Hirohito and the new cabinet
headed by Premier General Hideki
Tojo and has "final" instructions on
which the future of Japanese-Amer
ican relations may hang.
