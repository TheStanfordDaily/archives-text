### AMIE REICHERT 
r JMIE controversy over Herbert
Hoover's proposed food plan
continues to rage beyond Palm Drive
as well as inside it. Most recent
evidence of this is to be found in
Mr. Hoover's new series of articles
for the Saturday Evening Post.
"History" has stated the nega
tive side of the case once (see The
Daily, Oct. 20-25) and has no wish
to re-enter the fray. With this
firmly in mind we herewith re
print a letter from Mr. Maurice
Pate, president of the Commission
for Polish Relief, Inc., because the
writer has expressly requested
that we do this and because he is
a co-worker of Mr. Hoover's.
Mf. Pate takes issue with ''His
tory" on the question of food diver
sion which was one of the arguments
advanced in this column.
The letter follows:

HAVE read your first two ar
ticles regarding Mr. Hoover's
proposal for an experimental feed
ing plan in Belgium, where starva
tion is very acute, and where Bel
gium's 2,000,000 children (her next
generation) are in peril of either a
lingering death or deformity if a so
lution cannot be found to help them.
"May I inform you (as a man
who served in Belgium for a year
during the last war in Mr. Hoover's
food organization) that any diversion
of food by the Germans was micro
scopic in comparison to the 4,000,000
tons of food that was imported. When
occasional small infractions by minor
Germans took place, Mr. Hoover
hard-fistedly demanded restitution,
and got it. During one year of serv
ice in southern Belgium, I never
had occasion to report the diversion
from Belgian hands of a single
pound of food.

"Again during the present war I
have served for two years as di
rector of the Commission for
Polish Relief. For 18 months, as
Mr. Hoover mentioned in his
speech of October 19, we have
heen feeding 50,000 children in
Polish cities. Not a single case of
food diversion has occurred in
this period. Our American in
spectors in Poland affirm this, and
hundreds of our Polish collabora
tors give their right hand that
every pound of this food has gone
to the Polish children for whom it
was intended. These same Poles
through secret channels send us
communications, asking, "Why
cannot this work be continued and
greatly increased? If our children
die or are stunted, there can be no
future Poland.'

Has it occurred to you that if we
let the children of Belgium, Poland,
valiant Greece and the other invaded
countries starve, —the Germans may
he the only healthy race left in Eu
rope? Please remember that the
'Belgian experiment' proposed by
Mr. Hoover foresees closely con
trolled feeding of children and des
titute adults in special kitchens,
with consumption of food on the
spot. Food would go into Belgium
only one shipload at a time; and this
supply would cease immediately, in
ease of German infraction."

JYjANIFESTLY, there is no way to
answer this argument of Mr.
Pate's, for he is, undoubtedly, an
authority on the subject. But the
fact is true also that there are other
authorities who claim exactly the
opposite of Mr. Pate. The issue can
not be decided on this one ground
alone.
It is important to point out that
the one argument advanced by the
opponents of Mr. Hoover's plan
which has never been answered
is that fact that when we send
food to occupied countries —
whether Mr. Hitler diverts it or
not —it simply means that he is
no longer responsible for the feed
ing of just that many mouths. He
can keep just that much more food
for his army.

And the fact is true too that he
must feed these people—to a cer
tain extent—in order to keep their
working capacity geared to his war
pitch and to prevent the contagion
of pestilence from starvation.
