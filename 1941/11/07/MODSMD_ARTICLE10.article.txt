# 'Dethunder SC' Roar Rallymen
## 3,000 Students Hear Revenge Promised 
### 
"Let's take the Thunder out of the
; Thundering Herd," said 1930 Gaie
ties star Herbert Wenig, and some
3000 Stanford student roared unani
mous approval keynoting last night's
tumultuous Pajamarino.
"We aren't forgetting our 33 to 0
licking of 1939 at the hands of Troy,"
said Coach Clark Shaughnessy in
seconding Wenig's motion for a
smashing victory Saturday.
Yell Leader Joe Messina followed
him with a staccato Coach Clark
yell and climaxed the Farm's top
rally of the year so far with the
famed Axe yell, ending the 1941
Pajamarino.
PARADE ON TIME
Starting from the Fiji house light
on the dot of 7:15, over 400 freshmen
paraded down the Row illuminated
in car headlights in a march that
was noisy but uneventful.
The shouting, milling group tum
bled into the Pavilion and the rally
began.
First speaker was Wenig, who
showed his old talent in keeping the
entire group in near hysterics. Af
ter telling the story of the swallow
lon his way to Capistrano who got
mixed up in the "damnedest bad
minton game you ever saw,* Wenig
drove his point home with "Let's
i «ive U.S.C. the damnedest football
game they ever had."
Lew Dorsey introduced a new
| band number, "Bells and Chimes," to
i the students after telling its history.
[ And the crowd clapped out the num-
I her with a roar of approval.
SKIT PANS RALLY COM
A few new ideas in sticker slo
gans were advanced in a skit, by
H. D. Thoreau panning the Rally
[ Committee. Included in the cast
i were John Lit wry, IT. D. Thoreau,
Patty Bouchard, Bob Rockwell, Pat
Weiss, and Brown lee Corrinj
ust as the skit group disappeared
in a mass suicide, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy entered, and the stu
dent body gave with what seemed
to be the loudest yell of the year.
Apologizing for thr non-appear
ance of the team, which was eating
dinner, Coach Shaughnessy told of
I his fear of Troy, but said "We're in
' good condition."
ROBLE SERENADED
Trailing at a disrespectful dis
tance, the freshman men followed
the girls of '45 to Roble where they
had their annual serenade. Their
night ended with a rush to the free
movie at the Varsity Theater.
Meanwhile, some 300 loyal Stan
fordites were bidding their team
goodbye at the Southrn Pacific sta
tion, minus yell leaders and band,
But the yell-leading difficulty was
soon solved by some five ingenious
freshmen who led the crowd in yells
1 and songs.
Amid a pandemonium of "Come
Join the Band," goodbyes, and "Me
ne, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin," the
j Stanford football team entrained for
I the south.

i the students after telling its history.
[ And the crowd clapped out the num-
I her with a roar of approval.
SKIT PANS RALLY COM
A few new ideas in sticker slo
gans were advanced in a skit, by
H. D. Thoreau panning the Rally
[ Committee. Included in the cast
i were John Lit wry, IT. D. Thoreau,
Patty Bouchard, Bob Rockwell, Pat
Weiss, and Brown lee Corrinj
ust as the skit group disappeared
in a mass suicide, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy entered, and the stu
dent body gave with what seemed
to be the loudest yell of the year.
Apologizing for thr non-appear
ance of the team, which was eating
dinner, Coach Shaughnessy told of
I his fear of Troy, but said "We're in
' good condition."
ROBLE SERENADED
Trailing at a disrespectful dis
tance, the freshman men followed
the girls of '45 to Roble where they
had their annual serenade. Their
night ended with a rush to the free
movie at the Varsity Theater.
Meanwhile, some 300 loyal Stan
fordites were bidding their team
goodbye at the Southrn Pacific sta
tion, minus yell leaders and band,
But the yell-leading difficulty was
soon solved by some five ingenious
freshmen who led the crowd in yells
1 and songs.
Amid a pandemonium of "Come
Join the Band," goodbyes, and "Me
ne, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin," the
j Stanford football team entrained for
I the south.
"Let's take the Thunder out of the
; Thundering Herd," said 1930 Gaie
ties star Herbert Wenig, and some
3000 Stanford student roared unani
mous approval keynoting last night's
tumultuous Pajamarino.
"We aren't forgetting our 33 to 0
licking of 1939 at the hands of Troy,"
said Coach Clark Shaughnessy in
seconding Wenig's motion for a
smashing victory Saturday.
Yell Leader Joe Messina followed
him with a staccato Coach Clark
yell and climaxed the Farm's top
rally of the year so far with the
famed Axe yell, ending the 1941
Pajamarino.
PARADE ON TIME
Starting from the Fiji house light
on the dot of 7:15, over 400 freshmen
paraded down the Row illuminated
in car headlights in a march that
was noisy but uneventful.
The shouting, milling group tum
bled into the Pavilion and the rally
began.
First speaker was Wenig, who
showed his old talent in keeping the
entire group in near hysterics. Af
ter telling the story of the swallow
lon his way to Capistrano who got
mixed up in the "damnedest bad
minton game you ever saw,* Wenig
drove his point home with "Let's
i «ive U.S.C. the damnedest football
game they ever had."
