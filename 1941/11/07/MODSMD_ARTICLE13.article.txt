# LITVINOV APPOINTED AMBASSADOR TO U.S.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 (UP). —
Josef Stalin raised former Soviet
Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov
from political oblivion today and
named him Russian ambassador to
Washington in what may be the pre
lude to a diplomatic offensive on the
issues of peace or war in the Pa
cific and Japan's future role in the
Axis alliance.

Litvinov, a long-time exponent of
anti-Nazi collaboration, succeeds
Ambassador Constantine Oumansky
who has been in Russia for some
time.

His appointment was regarded as
especially significant as it came on
the heels of the disclosure that
Japan is rushing a special envoy—
Saburo Kurusu, former ambassador
to Berlin—to Washington with last
minute compromise proposals for
settlement of Japanese-American
differences.
