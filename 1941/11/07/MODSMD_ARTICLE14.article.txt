# Strikes Tie Up Air Factories

### United Press 
A welders' strike at major aircraft
industries and the threat of a strike
call among the nation's railway em
ployees confused the defense-labor
scene Thursday as President Roose
velt warned workers of a need for
"full sacrifices now" and "three
shifts a day" to safeguard the coun
try against the Nazi menace.
Even as the President spoke, rep
resentatives of 350,000 skilled rail
way workers pondered a "disap
pointing" government compromise
recommendation of their wage gain
demands and prepared a report ex
pected to set a strike deadline early
in December. This group embraced
the Big Five brotherhoods of oper
ating trainmen.
More than $1,000,000,000 in mili
tary aircraft orders were affected by
a two-day strike of independent
welders at the Consolidated Air
craft, plant, San Diego, and the Lock
heed and Vega plants at Los Ange
les, and the walkout threatened to
extend to a half-dozen other air
plane plants holding another $2,700,-
000.000 in defense assignments. The
imperiled plants were the Douglas,
North American, Vultee, Northrop,
Ryan and Solar divisions in the Los
Angeles area.
The jurisdiction dispute between
A.F.L. welder.s and metal trades un
ions, which had choked a billion
dollars' worth of defense shipbuild
ing on the West Coast for nearly a
month, flared in violence Thursday
just after a peace had been effected.
The striking welders charged they
had been attacked by metal trades
pickets as they sought to re-enter
shipyards under terms of the settle
ment.
A San Diego naval training base
construction job and another at
Camp Elliott. California, were halt
ed by a walkout of A.F.L. building
trades workers asking wage in
creases.
