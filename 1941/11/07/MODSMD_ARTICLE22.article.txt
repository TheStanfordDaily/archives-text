## Bioff, Browne Face 30-year Sentences After Jury Decision 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. (> (UP).—Wil-
I it- BiofT, who went from pandering
to Hollywood, tonight heard himself
;tiid Gi'orge E. Browne, his fellow
leader of movie labor, convicted of
extorting $550,000 from the movie
industry under threat of ruining it
with strikes.
Each was convicted of three counts
of extortion and conspiracy and
each is liable to a total of 30 years'
imprisonment when sentence is im
posed Wednesday by Federal Judge
John C. Knox. They were taken to
jail immediately to await sentence.
BiofT, West Coast representative
of the International Alliance of The
atrical Stage Employees (A.F.L.), of
which Browne is president, accepted
the verdict sullenly, his face flush
ing. Browne, owl-eyed and phleg
matic:, chewed the stub of a linger
on his left hand, from which the
first knuckle is missing.
Malhias F. Correa, United States
Attorney, had demanded of the busi
ness men jury that it. find the de
fendants guilty and thus "serve no
-lii<: on racketeers and mobsters,
Imodiums and similar gentry that
they must get out of American in
dustry and labor."
White-haired Judge Knox, re
calling the testimony of top-ranking
movie executives — the Warner
brothers, Nicholas Schenck and oth
ers that they had paid sums total
ing almost $1,000,000 to BiofT and
BroyJne over a long period of years,
observed in his charge that "it is a
sorry world in which, no matter
whose testimony you believe, these
things can happen."
Browne did not testify but BiolT,
chief witness for the defense, con
tended that he had accepted vast
urns from movie executives only as
a messenger boy, in which he made
transcontinental trips with as much
as $100,000 at a time. He collected
the money from movie executives,
lie said, and delivered it to other
executives on the understanding that
II was to b used to fight legislation
! y which the industry would have
been "sandbagged."
