### 
HOLLYWOOD, Nov. 6 (UP).—
Michigan's great football star, Tom
Harmon, today arrived in the movie
colony for the dual purpose of seeing
blonde Elyse Knox and checking
whether he is wanted for picture
work.
The All-American player of 1940
was met at Lockheed Air Terminal
by Miss Knox when he arrived this
afternoon by United Airlines. Al
though Harmon blushed and stam
mered when he greeted Miss Knox,
he previously had told fellow pas
sengers on the transport he hoped
to become engaged to the little film
actress before he joins the army.
Harmon recently volunteered for
duty in the Army Air Corps after
his draft board at Ann Arbor, Mich.,
classified him as 1-A. He said he did
not expect to be called up for serv
ice for a month or two and thought
he might be able to do a picture role
before then.
