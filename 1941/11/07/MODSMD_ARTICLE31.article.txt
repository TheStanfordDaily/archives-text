# Knickerbocker Set Completed
## Gallows and Clouds Test Staff Ingenuity 
### 
With such production problems as
building real gallows, turning wind
mills, clouds drifting across the sky, [
boats rocking at a wharf, the in- j
genuity of the production staff of |
"Knickerbocker Holiday" and Wal
demar Johansen, Stanford Players'
technical director in particular, has !
been tested, but not found wanting.
"We couldn't bury the base of the
gallows in the stage, so we made it j
of pipe and disguised it to look like J
wood," said Johansen. The cloud- |
machine was built as a special proj- j
ect by the lighting class.
As the lights go up after Wash
ington Irving's prologue, the town
square of old New Amsterdam is
seen, the Dutch houses with holly
hocks around the door, and the gal
lows and stockade in a blue and
white color scheme. "The set is not
an accurate portrayal of the scene,"
Johansen commented. "It's a mu
sical-comedy idealization."
Statistics of the show indicate it
requires 72,000 watts of light, more !
than twice as much as the usual I
production. The "sky-cloth" is 170
feet around, and the windmills 28
feet high. The production staff,
business, properties, and stage crew
numbers 40.
"Knickerbocker Holiday" will be
presented by the Stanford Players
Nov. 13, 14. 15. Tickets are 83 cents,
tax included, and may be obtained j
in Room 202. Memorial Hall.
