# Papooses, Cubs To Clash
## Frosh Try For Fourth Annual Win 
### 
The Stanford freslimcn, who have
lost only one football game in three
years, meet a powerful California
Cub team tomorrow afternoon in
the stadium.

The Papooses will not be at full
strength in the Little Big Game for
Jim McCurdy will be missing for
the second consecutive Saturday.
His first replacement, Neele John
ston, i.s also on the invalid list,
leaving only two men for the pivot
post. One is Pete August, who is
used to playing end. If Pete can't
go (50 minutes, Frank Moultin will
be called into action. Moultin has
the hustle, but lacks experience.
Wally Wallace, an end, will also
be missing from the line-up. Ev
eryone in Shipkey's backfield, how
ever, seems ready to go. Fred San
derman was carried off the field
last week but worked out this week.
<;AIYIE TOSS-UP
The game rates as just about a
toss-up although Cal possibly has
the more impressive record. The
only common foe of the two teams is
U.S.C. The Cubs walloped the Tro
babes 26-0 while the Papeese
beat the Southerners 25-6.
Cal also trounced Â«San Francisco
J.C. in their season's opener and
followed it up with an impressive
victory over McClelland Field, a
team that boasTed Jim Kisselburgh
in the backfield.
Clint Evans' team includes some
of the Piedmont Wonder team of
last year, but their main threat is
little Jack Clifford, who weighs in
at 154 pounds. The little scooter
averaged six yards a crack against
the Trobabes, carrying the ball 20
times. He ran a punt back 77 yards
to a touchdown. He and Cliff Mc-
Clain have been punting well.
Evans has a third punter, Bill Pen
nington, who kicked GO yards over
the safety man's head in the Me-
Clellan game.
