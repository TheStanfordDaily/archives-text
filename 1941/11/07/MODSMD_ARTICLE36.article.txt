### DON SELBY 
: conference teams go to the
post again tomorrow afternoon.
Unless a tie, an unheard-of thing
in the loop this year, pops up, four
teams will have been taken down a
rung on the conference ladder by
I tomorrow night.
Luckie Louie, who strutted into
the shack with head high yester
day afternoon, said that Cal, Idaho,
U.C.L.A., and U.S.C. would he the
I four down-trodden outfits, to he
victimized by Washington, Wash
ington State, Oregon State, and
Stanford, respectively.
Of his work on last week's picks,
we'd say your chances of coming
out on top by stringing along with
the Pixley prognosticator are better
than average. Use your own judg
ment.

DEFORE entraining last night for
the Southland, Clark Shaugh
nessy had the Indians speeding
through their last hard drill before
the game. And, if anyone had the
idea that the Trojans are going to
be a soft toueh, there certainly was
n't any evidence of such an atti
tude on the practice field. Indeed,
Shaughnessy's manner alone would
have caused any of the gridders to
think several times before easing up
on the work.
There's a chance that the Trojans
will come through with the unex
| pected. There is always that chance
| —and usually a pretty good one—in
j football or any other sport. Cer
tainly Sam Barry's outfit cannot be
as bad as some of the experts would
like to have you believe. A peek
! at the statistics, which show that
U.S.C.'s Bobby Robertson is the
leading ball carrier in the Pacific
Coast Conference, proves that point.
So all those observers who are
laughing up their sleeve at Shaugh
nessy's fear of the Trojans may be
off the track. Please understand that
we're not trying to build the men
from Troy into a mighty team
merely through the use of words.
I It's just that they can't be so ter
! ribly poor. Remember that they
downed 0.5.C., Stanford's conqueror.
The debacle over Berkeley way
i between California and Washing
ton should be fairly close. But
for our football, we'll take the
U.S.C.-Stanford game. Even if we
were impartial, which we're not,
we'd favor the southern battle,
simply because Stanford plays the
brand of football that is interest
ing to watch. Washington is just
an ordinary Notre Dame style
team. And Cal is colorless, as far
as the type of game the Bears play
is concerned. Whatever color they
have is in the personnel.
But with the Inidans it's different.
1 There's a lot of action; the play is
deceptive; and even the uniforms
i the Cards wear are flashy.

r pHE news these days is to the ef
j feet that Secretary of the Navy
| Knox said "no dice" on Navy com
ing to the Rose Bowl. That's a fine
thing: the guest refuses before he
is asked, even before the guy who
might have asked him is determined.
Which brings up the question of
Stanford's chances of going down
to the Arroyo Seco. It appears
that Stanford's are the best to be
had in the loop at this time, but
there's no certainty to it.
At the beginning of the season, it
appeared that Stanford would be
playing the toughest teams in the
round robin in the first half of the
schedule. Well, that part of it came
through all right, for the first half
season was tough. But now, when
the Injuns come to the second half
of the schedule, it begins to look as
if the tail end is every bit as tough
as the first part war. This is espe
cially true of W.S.C. and Cal, a
j pair of teams that have been com
ing fast.
