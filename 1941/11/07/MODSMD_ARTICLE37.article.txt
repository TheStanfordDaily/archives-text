# Firemen Blank Breakers, 26-0
## 
### 
Led by their Frankie-Albert-like
halfback, Monte Pfyl, the seven gen
tlemen from the Firehouse success
fully defended their several intra
mural grid reputations and knocked
the Breakers out of the champion
ship playoffs, 26 to 0, yesterday.
Pfyl had several aces up his sleeve,
but he contented himself with play
ing two, spot passing and broken
field running. For about one-half
of the game the Breakers lineman
did break through to mess up his
passing which was satisfactory. In
the other cases, Pfyl ran around his
ends, through his tackles, and any
where in general to count up the
yardage.
In line with family tradition Pfyl
flipped the first scoring pass to
brother Frank Pfyl. Several plays
later the brothers continued to hog
the ball with another six points via
an aerial connection.
Wyland Cripe converted the first
of his two extras, and an insignifi
cant time later Pfyl tossed a third
touchdown pass to his father's other
son.
CLARK THREATENS
Bruce Clark of the Breakers had
been threatening to break loose on
an end sweep all afternoon and two
plays before the half he proceeded
some 65 yards into Firehouse terri
tory. A pass to A1 Wool put the ball
on the blaze-chasers' 30, but the gun
ended the effort.
In the middle of the third quarter.
Pfyl twisted through numerous
Breakers for some 70 yards. A pass
to Frank Farrell on the next play
ended the scoring for the day.
