## Tyler Norton, Vern Hart Are 'Specialists' of Grid Squad 
### HAP EVERETT 
Behind tlic droves of top-notch all-around players that make up
Clark Shaughnessy's football squad are two specialists who are stand
outs in their chosen fields.
Exponent of what is practically a lost art, Tyler Norton is probably the
only drop - kick expert now employed exclusively for that purpose on

the Pacific Coast. «
According to the roster, he's a
center, behind Vic Lindskog, Doug
Stahle, Tony Medved, and Dar
(Bothel) Seeley. That doesn't bother
Nort because he sticks pretty much
to his hobby, dropping kicks through
the uprights from difficult angles 30
and 4t) yards out. You can see him
before every game doing it and the
coaches know that some day there
may be a perfect spot for his con
sistency.
DROP-KICKS FADING
There hasn't been the emphasis on
field goals and drop-kicking in the
past five years that there was at one
time. Many an old - timer like
I Charley Erb, has been trying to
bring kicking back to its old place
|in the game. The field goal from
! placement is still with us to a great
I extent but the drop-kick is fading
fast. A man like Tyler Norton is
not wasting time, coaches will tell
you, for he is helping preserve one
of the game's most spectacular
angles.
Another unconspicuous man on
Stanford's squad is a lean, dark
trackman, Vern Hart, known all over
the West as a fine hurdler and high
jumper. At Narbonne High in south
ern California Vern was quite a half
back and a sensational punter. He
!is not quite hefty enough for a
full-time Stanford player and had
not even considered himself a mem
ber of the squad after the first few
j weeks of the season.
VERN BACK AT TABLE
The other day, Shaughnessy look
ed over the sidelines of the prac
tice field and saw Vern boot a dozen
spirals 70 yards downfield to Bill
Havetto. Some time later, A1 Mas
ters came out and told Vern to re
port back to training table.
Some day there will be a spot for
Hart, too. As a matter of fact, Harry
Shipkey sent Vern in two years ago
down at S.C. with the frosh on their
own eight and the slim halfback
booted one G5-yards up the field.
Many people wonder why Hart
and Norton keep hanging around.
The answer is that Stanford has a
lar-sighted coaching staff.

Some day there will be a spot for
Hart, too. As a matter of fact, Harry
Shipkey sent Vern in two years ago
down at S.C. with the frosh on their
own eight and the slim halfback
booted one G5-yards up the field.
Many people wonder why Hart
and Norton keep hanging around.
The answer is that Stanford has a
lar-sighted coaching staff.
Behind tlic droves of top-notch all-around players that make up
Clark Shaughnessy's football squad are two specialists who are stand
outs in their chosen fields.
Exponent of what is practically a lost art, Tyler Norton is probably the
only drop - kick expert now employed exclusively for that purpose on

the Pacific Coast. «
According to the roster, he's a
center, behind Vic Lindskog, Doug
Stahle, Tony Medved, and Dar
(Bothel) Seeley. That doesn't bother
Nort because he sticks pretty much
to his hobby, dropping kicks through
the uprights from difficult angles 30
and 4t) yards out. You can see him
before every game doing it and the
coaches know that some day there
may be a perfect spot for his con
sistency.
DROP-KICKS FADING
There hasn't been the emphasis on
field goals and drop-kicking in the
past five years that there was at one
time. Many an old - timer like
I Charley Erb, has been trying to
bring kicking back to its old place
|in the game. The field goal from
! placement is still with us to a great
I extent but the drop-kick is fading
fast. A man like Tyler Norton is
not wasting time, coaches will tell
you, for he is helping preserve one
of the game's most spectacular
angles.
Another unconspicuous man on
Stanford's squad is a lean, dark
trackman, Vern Hart, known all over
the West as a fine hurdler and high
jumper. At Narbonne High in south
ern California Vern was quite a half
back and a sensational punter. He
!is not quite hefty enough for a
full-time Stanford player and had
not even considered himself a mem
ber of the squad after the first few
j weeks of the season.
VERN BACK AT TABLE
The other day, Shaughnessy look
ed over the sidelines of the prac
tice field and saw Vern boot a dozen
spirals 70 yards downfield to Bill
Havetto. Some time later, A1 Mas
ters came out and told Vern to re
port back to training table.
