It ain't the Chattanooga Choo
Choo.
But apparently many Stanford
students could afTord to board, evi
denced by the fact that tonight at
7:40 more than 250 Stanfordites will
be South, but hardly slumber, bound
on the S.C. special.
Tickets for the special train are
practically sold out, according to Jim
McKellar, student manager. Late

Women returning to Stanford on
the rooters' train Sunday night
will be granted non-quota leaves,
according to an announcement
from Women's Council.

yesterday afternoon there were only
a few tickets and berths left on the
entire train.
DEADLINE AT NOON
Today noon will be the deadline
for those who have receipts for their
Pullmans to come to claim their
berth tickets at the A.S.S.U. office.
After 12 o'clock no Pullmans will be
available.
The Special will reach Los An
geles at 7:40 tomorrow morning. On
the return trip the train is scheduled
to leave L.A. at 6:45 Sunday eve
ning and will arrive in Palo Alto
Monday morning at 6:45 a.m.
More than 250 students have taken
advantage of special rates which Jim
McKellar obtained from the South
ern Pacific Company last week. Mc-
Kellar bought $2,500 worth of scrip
which was not subject to the new
10 per cent government tax on train
tickets. Round trip tickets cost $10
plus berths.
