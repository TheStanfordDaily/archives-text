# Water Poloists Play in South
## 
### 
With thoughts of revenge definite
ly fixed in their minds, Coach Norton
Thornton, eleven members of the
varsity water polo team, and two
managers entrained last night for the
Southland for a two-game week
end against U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
They face the Trojans this after
noon at 3 in the U.S.C. plunge and
the Bruins tomorrow morning at 10
in the Westwood pool.
Although the Trojan contest will
be no pushover, the Indians are
guning for Bob Parks' unbeaten
Bruins seven. The Bruins, paced by
all conference forwards Bill Mitch
ell and Johnny Segale, hold a pre
vious 10 to 6 victory over the Cards
and are now currently residing at
the top of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence.
Offense has been Stanford's big
weakness thus far. Thornton's back
field combination of Bob Jones,
Frank Mitchell, and Jack Bleecker
along with goalie Pete Lee are sec
ond to none on the coast, but his
i forwards with the exception of
Grant Culley have been very er
ratic in the scoring department.
Using Culley, sophomore "discov
ery" of the last Bruin contest, and
Best Singer, transferred from goalie
last week, at the forward spots,
j Coach Nort hopes to add some
needed punch to the Cards. Bill
Mapel will hold down his regular
sprint spot although Hadley Bacon,
former forward, has shown up well
in the speed position.
Present conference standings:
Won Lost
U.C.L.A 3 0
Stanford 11
U.S.C 1 2
California 1 3
