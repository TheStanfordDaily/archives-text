Bouquets with Bricks
ROSES are red; and, at the present time, they
are particularly pertinent in so far as Stan
ford is concerned. We like the bouquets a cer
tain national magazine has been throwing to the
Farm, but when there are bricks in them—
please, mother, don't pin a rose on me.
Bill Henry, topflight writer for one of Los An
geles' newspapers, laid emphasis in one of his
recent columns on the fact that when large
scale national magazines write something about
a person that person usually runs into trouble.
And Stanford is no exception.
The Saturday Evening Post carried an article
about Frank Albert; the next week Stanford's
winning streak was upset by Oregon State. Last
week the same magazine ballyhooed Shaugh
nessy; and Yesterday Frank Albert passed his
service physical examination and was placed
in class IA.
If any other magazine writes on Stanford foot
ball—and Collier's is expected to run a Frank
Albert yarn and cover in the near future—look
for the worst. It may not be roses you will be
smelling New Year's Day, just brick dust.—Bud
