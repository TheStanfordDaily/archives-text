CHARITY drives at Stanford have always
been objects of controversy. Each year
there flows into the A.S.S.U. executive offices a
never-ending stream of requests for permission
to hold drives on the campus. And each year
Executive Committee discusses the question of
just which organizations should be granted this
permission.

Two years ago, the .Executive Committee
then in office adopted a policy whereby no
drives which did not directly affect Stanford
were to be authorized. Two exceptions were
made in favor of the Red Cross Drive and the
March of Dimes.

During the school year each Stanford student
is approached numerous times for local chari
ties. There is always some vital financial prob
lem looming up on the campus, and besides
those that loom up, there are the steadies, the
week-long Convalescent Home Drive and the
"Y" Drive.

Nationally conducted drives are, for the most
part, unquestionably worthy. But, is it fair to
Stanford students, and their parents, to let each
of these groups come forth with the empty, out
stretched palm?

And each and every one it will be, if the pres
ent Executive Committee swings wide the flood
gates to the open palms.—Rosemarie Mullany
