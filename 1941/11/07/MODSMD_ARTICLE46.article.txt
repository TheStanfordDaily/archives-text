RALLY COMMITTEE has had more than its
share of criticism. Much has been justified,
some unfair; but mostly all has been destructive
criticism. So now for a little constructive criti
cism.
It is perhaps a little late for this season, but
for future reference we suggest to Rally Com
mittees of tomorrow that they present well
balanced, entertaining programs on each rally.
A larger and more interested crowd of students
will attend if there is more on the program than
the usual yells, songs, and perhaps one pep talk.
In years past, the difficulty has been too many
good speakers and stunts, not too few.
Words, however, are easy to write. There's
much more to it than "just plan a program." And
the problem of problems is to please a Stanford
crowd.
But there certainly is abundant material in the
Bay Area and right here on campus for really
swell rallies. Who can be obtained? Here are
just a few speakers that could be asked. (To be
filed by Rally Committee.)
The newspaper fraternity is always a good
bet:

Bill Leiser (4 stars), Prescott Sullivan, Harry
Borba, Tom Laird, Bud Spencer (S.F. News), Don
Glendon (radio and newspaper sports authority),
Morrie Morrison (Chronicle sports cartoonist
and football analyst), Dick Friendlich, Jack Mc-
Donald (Call-Bulletin), Russ Newland (Associ
ated Press), Ed Sullivan (United Press), and so on
and on and on.
How about Stanford greats of the past?— Keith
Topping, Bones Hamilton, Bill Corbus, Ernie
Nevers, Little Jim Reynolds, and so an ad infi
nitum.
And former Stanford funnymen: Doodles
Weaver or Dana Winters.
Call on the coaching fraternity: Jeff Cravath,
Alonzo Stagg, Buck Shaw, Ben Winkelman, Pop
Warner, Stub Allison, and Slip Madigan.
Past student body presidents would be dandy
for a quick speech—Ken Cuthbertson, for ex
ample. And a big gun of the alumni—like Big
Jim Reynolds.
The list could continue for pages, but then

turn to campus talent. If there were aisles to
roll in, a President Roosevelt pep talk by Frank
lin Shorty Grannis would put the student body
in these aisles—if the aisles were there. How
about a Hank Swafford's "Casey Cal"? This list,
too, could go on and on.
Nor do we forget that many prospects will not
consent to speak to a Stanford rally—the dis
courtesy and abuse are too discouraging. But
they are in the minority. Nor can Rally Com
mittee ask a prominent man to speak just a few
days before the rally. There's all year to plan
the programs.
The answer to these and all problems is ad
vance planning, ingenuity, perseveranse, and
perspiration. Rally Committee should have all
these virtues.—Herman Silverman

Alonzo Stagg, Buck Shaw, Ben Winkelman, Pop
Warner, Stub Allison, and Slip Madigan.
Past student body presidents would be dandy
for a quick speech—Ken Cuthbertson, for ex
ample. And a big gun of the alumni—like Big
Jim Reynolds.
The list could continue for pages, but then

turn to campus talent. If there were aisles to
roll in, a President Roosevelt pep talk by Frank
lin Shorty Grannis would put the student body
in these aisles—if the aisles were there. How
about a Hank Swafford's "Casey Cal"? This list,
too, could go on and on.
Nor do we forget that many prospects will not
consent to speak to a Stanford rally—the dis
courtesy and abuse are too discouraging. But
they are in the minority. Nor can Rally Com
mittee ask a prominent man to speak just a few
days before the rally. There's all year to plan
the programs.
The answer to these and all problems is ad
vance planning, ingenuity, perseveranse, and
perspiration. Rally Committee should have all
these virtues.—Herman Silverman
RALLY COMMITTEE has had more than its
share of criticism. Much has been justified,
some unfair; but mostly all has been destructive
criticism. So now for a little constructive criti
cism.
It is perhaps a little late for this season, but
for future reference we suggest to Rally Com
mittees of tomorrow that they present well
balanced, entertaining programs on each rally.
A larger and more interested crowd of students
will attend if there is more on the program than
the usual yells, songs, and perhaps one pep talk.
In years past, the difficulty has been too many
good speakers and stunts, not too few.
Words, however, are easy to write. There's
much more to it than "just plan a program." And
the problem of problems is to please a Stanford
crowd.
But there certainly is abundant material in the
Bay Area and right here on campus for really
swell rallies. Who can be obtained? Here are
just a few speakers that could be asked. (To be
filed by Rally Committee.)
The newspaper fraternity is always a good
bet:

Bill Leiser (4 stars), Prescott Sullivan, Harry
Borba, Tom Laird, Bud Spencer (S.F. News), Don
Glendon (radio and newspaper sports authority),
Morrie Morrison (Chronicle sports cartoonist
and football analyst), Dick Friendlich, Jack Mc-
Donald (Call-Bulletin), Russ Newland (Associ
ated Press), Ed Sullivan (United Press), and so on
and on and on.
How about Stanford greats of the past?— Keith
Topping, Bones Hamilton, Bill Corbus, Ernie
Nevers, Little Jim Reynolds, and so an ad infi
nitum.
And former Stanford funnymen: Doodles
Weaver or Dana Winters.
