Vk7HENEVER it's early twilight I feel like taking a
kayak from Quincey to that other place that
rhymes with kayak and right now it feels like early
twilight. It is afternoon, but I can't say afternoon be
cause the paper doesn't come out until tomorrow. It
is afternoon on Thursday, a bright sunny day. To
night we are going to have a pajamarino rally. Today
and tomorrow, which is really today, the cars and peo
ple start rolling south. I am supposed to sit at this
typewriter until I have filled two takes of this yellow
paper because there is a space saved on the back page
for the two takes. It's got to be done, but I don't
feel like doing it because I feel like taking a kayak
somewhere.

I don't feel like thinking for about a week. I feel
like sitting somewhere and not thinking. Just sitting
and looking, not thinking. I feel like putting a candle
in a bottle and burning the candle so that the tallow
will fall all over the bottle and cover it with tallow.
That would be fun. To just sit and watch tallow fall
all over a bottle. You don't have to think. When the
fire goes out, strike a match and start the candle burn
ing again. When the candle is all burnt, get another
one from somewhere and start all over again. Candles
are cheap and you could get a lot of them and burn
them and have fun without thinking. I would like to
do that or take a kayak to Quincey and back.

/\NCE in Quincey, I would sit in the middle of
Quincey and not think. If anyone should bother
me and ask me what I'm doing I would say that I'm
dead for three days but I'll be all right don't worry.
And then I would ask them if they had any old
bottles they weren't using, and a couple of old candles
lying around the house. The people would all bring
me their old candles and bottles, because people of
Quincey like dead people. Then I would thank them
and sit in the middle of Quincey for a little while
longer then I would get in the kayak and drive back.

J WOULD like to do that or sit on the beach and
build castles out of the sand. You don't have to
think to build sand castles. Just sit and pile the sand
and pile the sand up until the sand looks like a castle
instead of sand. If the water comes and eats the
castle back down, move up just a little higher on the
beach and start piling the sand up again. I would
like to do that for about three days and not think.

I would like to do that or sit up in a tree and act
like a bird and let out a coo every once in a while
so that everyone would think that I was a bird instead
of a person with a name, who wears clothes and
in a house and knows how to talk and has to think.
I would like to sit on a branch and say coo and coo and
coo and coo and not think, and make everyone puzzled,
because I would be the biggest bird in any tree that
they had ever seen. I would like to sit there in the
tree and say coo and fool everyone and not think.
That would be a lot of fun.

There are any number of things that I would like
to do instead of acting like a person and having to
say hello and having to be responsible and having to
talk and having to think. But I can't. I don't know
why but I have to finish this, copyread it, make up a
title and take it to the backshop and have it set up.
I don't want to but I'm going to but I'll do so remem
bering the candles and the tallow and Quincey and the
sand and how I fooled everyone.
