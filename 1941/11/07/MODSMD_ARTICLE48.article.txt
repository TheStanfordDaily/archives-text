ONE OTHER . . . ?

'T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
Amic's at it again! I see she has us really AT
WAR today. Apparently there is just no way to
pacify Amie but for us all to get behind her and
Franklin D., administer Twilight Sleep to Congress,
and closing our eyes, leap in. One paragraph states:

"The immediate result of such a declaration would
be to lift the American public from the state of apa
thetic unreality in which it finds itself, unify and
concentrate labor and business in a renewed all-out
effort, blast the nationwide feeling of "Business as
usual'."

Oh yes, there would be one further result of a
declaration of war by America: hundreds of thou
sands of American boys would in a short time be
shipped abroad to invade the continent (without which
action no military victory can be won by Britain)
and then after dying in torture, the said American
boys would perhaps start coming home again in their
coffins, so thoroughly ordered by our government
last spring. All the while, Amie and other political
science majors could sit comfortably in their offices
and write words.
Stanford, '41
(We Who Would Die)
(Editor's note: "History 1941," while not de
nying the possibility that a declaration of war
might mean an A.E.F., nevertheless did not advo
cate such an expedition. "History" advocated noth
ing but outright declaration of war since we are
already shooting and being shot at.)

ATTENTION, S.C. ROOTERS

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Apart from our yells, chants and victory songs is
our hymn. It is something special, something sacred.
Singing it we feel our greatest love and pride in Stan
ford. Can't we keep it above the ordinary, 'let our
sincerity and respect for our hymn and school pene
trate the audience in the stadium? It would be so
much more effective if there were no yelling and clap
ping after it.
Also, we are disappointed. We'd heard about Stan
ford's wonderful spirit, remembered two seasons ago
when an unvictorious team was faithfully cheered
and supported through failure after failure. Such
esprit de corps isn't common. When we entered here,
we were thrilled by it and held by it and anxious to
be part of it. But Saturday we were puzzled by it,
unsure. Not only did the rooting section lack the
all-in-fun rolling and "take off that blue hat," but
it was substituted by booing, counting and general
dissension. . . . We hope it won't be that way again.
