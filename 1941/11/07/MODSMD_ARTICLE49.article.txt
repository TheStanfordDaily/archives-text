# James Cain's Latest Book Not His Best
## 
### 
"MILDRED PIERCE," by James
M. Cain, and published by Alfred
Knopf. $2.50.

A successful blending of sex and
story is accomplished gracefully by
a few writers, and James M. Cain
is not one of them. Not that this
should be any detriment to his writ
ing ability. It will probably have
the opposite effect on the sales of
his books—since he will probably
choose the profitable road of writing
Spicy Detective stories in bound
volumes.
This discourse on the subject of
sex is unfortunate in a discussion of
Cain's new book, "Mildred Pierce,"
but sex stands out in Cain's books
even more conspicuously than the
proverbial sore thumb.
BOOK HAS POINT
There is a point to Cain's book,
however, and it is significant
enough to stand above the cloud of
mud-slinging going on in every
page. The book accomplishes, in a
way better than I have ever seen it
done, the exposure and leveling of
false sophistication.
His instrument is a woman who
has the task of supporting her two
husbands, both of which were
former "successful" men, although
through no effort on their part.
Her first marriage netted her two
children, the better of which died
at the age of nine years. The other,
a girl, is eleven when Mildred and
her first husband separate. The
daughter has all the prigishness of
her father, and proves to be more
of a burden than the two husbands.
STORY PROGRESSES
The story progresses from the dis
mal atmosphere after the crash to
the brighter outlook of '36. Along
with this wave of recovery Mildred
Pierce becomes a comparatively
wealthy woman. The daughter en
ters womanhood, and becomes suc
cessful in her own right. The af
fairs of mother, daughter, and new
husband become complicated and
the resulting crash brings Mildred's
world once more down around her
as in 1933. The ending is tragic but
unavoidable.—Mull

This discourse on the subject of
sex is unfortunate in a discussion of
Cain's new book, "Mildred Pierce,"
but sex stands out in Cain's books
even more conspicuously than the
proverbial sore thumb.
BOOK HAS POINT
There is a point to Cain's book,
however, and it is significant
enough to stand above the cloud of
mud-slinging going on in every
page. The book accomplishes, in a
way better than I have ever seen it
done, the exposure and leveling of
false sophistication.
His instrument is a woman who
has the task of supporting her two
husbands, both of which were
former "successful" men, although
through no effort on their part.
Her first marriage netted her two
children, the better of which died
at the age of nine years. The other,
a girl, is eleven when Mildred and
her first husband separate. The
daughter has all the prigishness of
her father, and proves to be more
of a burden than the two husbands.
STORY PROGRESSES
The story progresses from the dis
mal atmosphere after the crash to
the brighter outlook of '36. Along
with this wave of recovery Mildred
Pierce becomes a comparatively
wealthy woman. The daughter en
ters womanhood, and becomes suc
cessful in her own right. The af
fairs of mother, daughter, and new
husband become complicated and
the resulting crash brings Mildred's
world once more down around her
as in 1933. The ending is tragic but
unavoidable.—Mull
"MILDRED PIERCE," by James
M. Cain, and published by Alfred
Knopf. $2.50.

A successful blending of sex and
story is accomplished gracefully by
a few writers, and James M. Cain
is not one of them. Not that this
should be any detriment to his writ
ing ability. It will probably have
the opposite effect on the sales of
his books—since he will probably
choose the profitable road of writing
Spicy Detective stories in bound
volumes.
