# Victory-Conscious Grid Squad Heads South for U.S.C. Tussle
## Men Leave Farm in Top Shape; Banducci, Armstrong Will Start 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Tliirty-seven victory-conscious Indian footballers left last night for the
sunny Southland, their objective being tomorrow afternoon's game with i
Southern California's inconsistent Trojans on the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum greensward.
Two years ago, Stanford's defeat-conscious "Big" lied Machine took a !

33-0 trouncing at the hands of a dif
ferent Trojan outfit. Troy was on its
way to the Rose Bowl that year. They
were spurred on by the thought of
Pasadena's saucer just beyond the
Verdugo Foothills.
The picture is similar this year,
except that the Cards are the squad
with Bowl aspirations, while the
Southern Califomians are now grov
elling in the abyss of defeat.
ALBERT GOAT
Grenny Landsdell, Ambie Schind
ler, and Doyle Nave jointly quarter
backed the Trojans to victory that
year. However, the outstanding men
on the field were two burly Farm
heroes, Norm Standlee and Stan
Andersen. If a goat had been picked
for the game it would have been a
bewildered Card sophomore half
back, Frankie Albert.

The five stars of that day's game
have left college and gone into the
great world outside. However, the

White shirts, rooters' caps, and
pompons are required for tomor
row's rooting section in the Coli
seum, according to Tink Downey,
secretary of Rally Committee.
The rooting section will be mixed
with card stunts at half-time.

There will he no ofTicial check
of student cards by Stanford, but
U.S.C. might inaugurate a sys
tem, the B.A.C. asid last night.
The game starts in the Colis<wun at
2:15 p.m.

"goat" is still around. He now occu
pies the role of hero, having come
into his own last year under Clark
Daniel Shaughnessy's ideas of how
to play football.
After a season and a half of all-
American play, Albert has been
chosen to lead his teammates during
the game.
KMET OUTSTANDING
Another sophomore of the 1939
game who didn't look like much,
was Pete Kmetovic, another half
back. Since then Pete has come into
his own also. Now he ranks as the
coast's outstanding open, and closed,
field runner.
Although many of this year's team
members were cither lowly fresh
men or high school boys when the
33-0 catastrophe took place, they
will all be out to compensate for
that game, with an impressive win
this year. Even last year's unbeaten
team had to come back with two
quick scores in the fourth period to
hand the Trojans a 21-7 loss.
So far this year U.S.C. has been
defeated in more starts than she has
won. However, with her captain in
the starting line-up for the first
time all season, and the rest of the
squad generally improved after a
ten-day vacation, the team will pre
sent a different story tomorrow.
After Trojan Coach Sam Barry
saw Stanford overcome Santa Clara
last week-end, he scoffed at Shaugh
nessy's fears, saying that the Farm
team was even better than last
year's. To counteract for the expert
eye which Barry cast on the Cards,
Louie Vincenti, former Card grid
der and now a lawyer in Southern
California, arrived at the Farm this
week with an accurate account of
what Troy has used so far this year.

All members of the local team left
Palo Alto in top shape for the game.
Bruno Banducci and Eric Arm
strong, both recently on the injured
list, are scheduled to start tomorrow
at right tackle and right half, re
spectively.

The other men on Coach Shaugh
nessy's opening list are Freddie
Meyer and Arnie Meiners at the
encls, Ed Stamm in the other tackle
post, Loren LaPrade and Chuck
Taylor, guards, Vic Llndskog, cen
ter, and Milt Vucinich in the back
field. '

Tliirty-seven victory-conscious Indian footballers left last night for the
sunny Southland, their objective being tomorrow afternoon's game with i
Southern California's inconsistent Trojans on the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum greensward.
Two years ago, Stanford's defeat-conscious "Big" lied Machine took a !

33-0 trouncing at the hands of a dif
ferent Trojan outfit. Troy was on its
way to the Rose Bowl that year. They
were spurred on by the thought of
Pasadena's saucer just beyond the
Verdugo Foothills.
The picture is similar this year,

with Bowl aspirations, while the
Southern Califomians are now grov
elling in the abyss of defeat.
ALBERT GOAT
Grenny Landsdell, Ambie Schind
ler, and Doyle Nave jointly quarter
backed the Trojans to victory that
year. However, the outstanding men
on the field were two burly Farm
heroes, Norm Standlee and Stan
Andersen. If a goat had been picked
for the game it would have been a
bewildered Card sophomore half
back, Frankie Albert.

The five stars of that day's game
have left college and gone into the
great world outside. However, the

White shirts, rooters' caps, and
pompons are required for tomor
row's rooting section in the Coli
seum, according to Tink Downey,
secretary of Rally Committee.
The rooting section will be mixed
with card stunts at half-time.

There will he no ofTicial check
of student cards by Stanford, but
U.S.C. might inaugurate a sys
tem, the B.A.C. asid last night.
The game starts in the Colis<wun at
2:15 p.m.

"goat" is still around. He now occu
pies the role of hero, having come
into his own last year under Clark
Daniel Shaughnessy's ideas of how
to play football.
After a season and a half of all-
American play, Albert has been
chosen to lead his teammates during
the game.
KMET OUTSTANDING
Another sophomore of the 1939
game who didn't look like much,
was Pete Kmetovic, another half
back. Since then Pete has come into
his own also. Now he ranks as the
coast's outstanding open, and closed,
field runner.
Although many of this year's team
members were cither lowly fresh
men or high school boys when the
33-0 catastrophe took place, they
will all be out to compensate for
that game, with an impressive win
this year. Even last year's unbeaten
team had to come back with two
quick scores in the fourth period to
hand the Trojans a 21-7 loss.
So far this year U.S.C. has been
defeated in more starts than she has
won. However, with her captain in
the starting line-up for the first
time all season, and the rest of the
squad generally improved after a
ten-day vacation, the team will pre
sent a different story tomorrow.

week with an accurate account of
what Troy has used so far this year.

All members of the local team left
Palo Alto in top shape for the game.
Bruno Banducci and Eric Arm
strong, both recently on the injured
list, are scheduled to start tomorrow
at right tackle and right half, re
spectively.

The other men on Coach Shaugh
nessy's opening list are Freddie
Meyer and Arnie Meiners at the
encls, Ed Stamm in the other tackle
post, Loren LaPrade and Chuck
Taylor, guards, Vic Llndskog, cen
ter, and Milt Vucinich in the back
field. '
Tliirty-seven victory-conscious Indian footballers left last night for the
sunny Southland, their objective being tomorrow afternoon's game with i
Southern California's inconsistent Trojans on the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum greensward.
Two years ago, Stanford's defeat-conscious "Big" lied Machine took a !

33-0 trouncing at the hands of a dif
ferent Trojan outfit. Troy was on its
way to the Rose Bowl that year. They
were spurred on by the thought of
Pasadena's saucer just beyond the
Verdugo Foothills.
The picture is similar this year,
except that the Cards are the squad
with Bowl aspirations, while the
Southern Califomians are now grov
elling in the abyss of defeat.
ALBERT GOAT
Grenny Landsdell, Ambie Schind
ler, and Doyle Nave jointly quarter
backed the Trojans to victory that
year. However, the outstanding men
on the field were two burly Farm
heroes, Norm Standlee and Stan
Andersen. If a goat had been picked
for the game it would have been a
bewildered Card sophomore half
back, Frankie Albert.

The five stars of that day's game
have left college and gone into the
great world outside. However, the

White shirts, rooters' caps, and
pompons are required for tomor
row's rooting section in the Coli
seum, according to Tink Downey,
secretary of Rally Committee.
The rooting section will be mixed
with card stunts at half-time.

There will he no ofTicial check
of student cards by Stanford, but
U.S.C. might inaugurate a sys
tem, the B.A.C. asid last night.
The game starts in the Colis<wun at
2:15 p.m.

"goat" is still around. He now occu
pies the role of hero, having come
into his own last year under Clark
Daniel Shaughnessy's ideas of how
to play football.
After a season and a half of all-
American play, Albert has been
chosen to lead his teammates during
the game.
KMET OUTSTANDING
Another sophomore of the 1939
game who didn't look like much,
was Pete Kmetovic, another half
back. Since then Pete has come into
his own also. Now he ranks as the
coast's outstanding open, and closed,
field runner.
Although many of this year's team
members were cither lowly fresh
men or high school boys when the
33-0 catastrophe took place, they
will all be out to compensate for
that game, with an impressive win
this year. Even last year's unbeaten
team had to come back with two
quick scores in the fourth period to
hand the Trojans a 21-7 loss.
So far this year U.S.C. has been
defeated in more starts than she has
won. However, with her captain in
the starting line-up for the first
time all season, and the rest of the
squad generally improved after a
ten-day vacation, the team will pre
sent a different story tomorrow.
After Trojan Coach Sam Barry
saw Stanford overcome Santa Clara
last week-end, he scoffed at Shaugh
nessy's fears, saying that the Farm
team was even better than last
year's. To counteract for the expert
eye which Barry cast on the Cards,
Louie Vincenti, former Card grid
der and now a lawyer in Southern
California, arrived at the Farm this
week with an accurate account of
what Troy has used so far this year.
