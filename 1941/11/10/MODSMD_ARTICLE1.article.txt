### AMIE REICHERT 
WAR II has unquestion
ably had its share of drama.
The flight of Rudolf Hess to Scot
land last May was one of the most
theatrical and one of the most mys
terious episodes. It has yet to be ex
plained, and in all probability the
truth will not be known for many
years to come.
In his latest best-seller, "That Day
Alone," Pierre van Paasen sets forth
a new theory, which is as good—if
not better—than the run-of-the
mill.
Mr. van Paasen says that Hess,
who was Hitler's most intimate
friend, adviser, and confidante,
flew to England on the command
of his Fuehrer in order to nego
tiate an alliance with the British
for the purpose of exterminating
the Red scourge in the East.
Hess was commissioned for sev
eral reasons, asys van Paasen: Hit
ler felt that he could not arrange
the deal through the usual diplo
matic channels since it might be in
terpreted as a bid for peace mo
tivated by a weakening of Germany's
resources; Hess was well known to
the Duke of Hamilton, and others
of England's Naziphile Cliveden set,
therefore could work through the
British fifth column.
* * *
r JPHE plan went awry when Hess,
upon landing, was confronted
not by his friend, the Duke of Ham
ilton, but a stubborn Scottish
farmer and a menacing pitchfork.
Van Paasen goes on to say that
Churchill listened to Hess' pro
posal and thereupon demanded
that the British government be
given some assurance of Hitler's
intention to make peace with Brit
ain and unite with her against
Russia.
There followed the blitz against
Russia in June and the simultaneous
cessation of bombers over Britain.
But Churchill foxed Der Fuehrer
and lined up with the Russians in
stead of against them.
* * *
I>Y SO DOING, says van Paasen,
Churchill scored a four-fold
diplomatic and strategic victory: he
gained an ally in Soviet Russia; suc
ceeded in diverting the full fuiy of
the German blitzkrieg from the West
to the East; gave British industry
valuable time to reproduce what
was lost at Dunkirk and Crete; gave
the U.S. time for lend-lease aid to
become effective.
The theory is perhaps a little
too pat; but so are all the theories
which were advanced in the heat
of the excitement which followed
the sensational flight. It carries a
little more weight because it is
bolstered by van Paascn's reputa
tion and the fact that he has been
on the in during much of this war.
Although van Paasen presents the
story as fact, until it is substantiated
by Messrs. Churchill, Hess, and Hit
ler it cannot be regarded as any
thing more than an interesting
theory.
# * *
item which packs dra
matic appeal is the story which
comes today from London of a mod
ern Scarlet Pimpernel—a man who
helps loyal Belgians escape the
clutches of the Nazis and flee to
England, freedom, and safety.
The escapades of this man of mys
tery who is wanted dead or alive by
the Gestapo makes Leslie Howard—
who played the part of the S.P. in
the movie—look like a sissie.
Recently he helped 100 persons,
who were beaded for a German
concentration camp in Belgium,
escape by detaching a railroad car
in which they were riding from
the rest of the train. So the story
goes.
He works with a small band of
fanatical patriots who also distrib
ute the world's most clandestine
newspaper, "La Libre Belgique." In
an interview which came over the
wire from London, he tells how, in
many cases, the Germans them
selves have unwittingly helped to
pass the revolutionary word by
carrying bundles of the newspapers
all over the country without know
ing they arc doing so.
It makes a good story, anyway.

In his latest best-seller, "That Day
Alone," Pierre van Paasen sets forth
a new theory, which is as good—if
not better—than the run-of-the
mill.
Mr. van Paasen says that Hess,
who was Hitler's most intimate
friend, adviser, and confidante,
flew to England on the command
of his Fuehrer in order to nego
tiate an alliance with the British
for the purpose of exterminating
the Red scourge in the East.
Hess was commissioned for sev
eral reasons, asys van Paasen: Hit
ler felt that he could not arrange
the deal through the usual diplo
matic channels since it might be in
terpreted as a bid for peace mo
tivated by a weakening of Germany's
resources; Hess was well known to
the Duke of Hamilton, and others
of England's Naziphile Cliveden set,
therefore could work through the
British fifth column.
* * *
r JPHE plan went awry when Hess,
upon landing, was confronted
not by his friend, the Duke of Ham
ilton, but a stubborn Scottish
farmer and a menacing pitchfork.
Van Paasen goes on to say that
Churchill listened to Hess' pro
posal and thereupon demanded
that the British government be
given some assurance of Hitler's
intention to make peace with Brit
ain and unite with her against
Russia.
There followed the blitz against
Russia in June and the simultaneous
cessation of bombers over Britain.
But Churchill foxed Der Fuehrer
and lined up with the Russians in
stead of against them.
* * *
I>Y SO DOING, says van Paasen,
Churchill scored a four-fold
diplomatic and strategic victory: he
gained an ally in Soviet Russia; suc
ceeded in diverting the full fuiy of
the German blitzkrieg from the West
to the East; gave British industry
valuable time to reproduce what
was lost at Dunkirk and Crete; gave
the U.S. time for lend-lease aid to
become effective.
The theory is perhaps a little
too pat; but so are all the theories
which were advanced in the heat
of the excitement which followed
the sensational flight. It carries a
little more weight because it is
bolstered by van Paascn's reputa
tion and the fact that he has been
on the in during much of this war.
Although van Paasen presents the
story as fact, until it is substantiated
by Messrs. Churchill, Hess, and Hit
ler it cannot be regarded as any
thing more than an interesting
theory.

item which packs dra
matic appeal is the story which
comes today from London of a mod
ern Scarlet Pimpernel—a man who
helps loyal Belgians escape the
clutches of the Nazis and flee to
England, freedom, and safety.
The escapades of this man of mys
tery who is wanted dead or alive by
the Gestapo makes Leslie Howard—
who played the part of the S.P. in
the movie—look like a sissie.
Recently he helped 100 persons,
who were beaded for a German
concentration camp in Belgium,
escape by detaching a railroad car
in which they were riding from
the rest of the train. So the story
goes.
He works with a small band of
fanatical patriots who also distrib
ute the world's most clandestine
newspaper, "La Libre Belgique." In
an interview which came over the
wire from London, he tells how, in
many cases, the Germans them
selves have unwittingly helped to
pass the revolutionary word by
carrying bundles of the newspapers
all over the country without know

of his Fuehrer in order to nego
tiate an alliance with the British
for the purpose of exterminating
the Red scourge in the East.
Hess was commissioned for sev
eral reasons, asys van Paasen: Hit
ler felt that he could not arrange
the deal through the usual diplo
matic channels since it might be in
terpreted as a bid for peace mo
tivated by a weakening of Germany's
resources; Hess was well known to
the Duke of Hamilton, and others
of England's Naziphile Cliveden set,
therefore could work through the
British fifth column.

r JPHE plan went awry when Hess,
upon landing, was confronted
not by his friend, the Duke of Ham
ilton, but a stubborn Scottish
farmer and a menacing pitchfork.
Van Paasen goes on to say that
Churchill listened to Hess' pro
posal and thereupon demanded
that the British government be
given some assurance of Hitler's
intention to make peace with Brit
ain and unite with her against
Russia.
There followed the blitz against
Russia in June and the simultaneous
cessation of bombers over Britain.
But Churchill foxed Der Fuehrer
and lined up with the Russians in
stead of against them.

I>Y SO DOING, says van Paasen,
Churchill scored a four-fold
diplomatic and strategic victory: he
gained an ally in Soviet Russia; suc
ceeded in diverting the full fuiy of
the German blitzkrieg from the West
to the East; gave British industry
valuable time to reproduce what
was lost at Dunkirk and Crete; gave
the U.S. time for lend-lease aid to
become effective.
The theory is perhaps a little
too pat; but so are all the theories
which were advanced in the heat
of the excitement which followed
the sensational flight. It carries a
little more weight because it is
bolstered by van Paascn's reputa
tion and the fact that he has been
on the in during much of this war.
Although van Paasen presents the
story as fact, until it is substantiated
by Messrs. Churchill, Hess, and Hit
ler it cannot be regarded as any
thing more than an interesting
theory.

item which packs dra
matic appeal is the story which
comes today from London of a mod
ern Scarlet Pimpernel—a man who
helps loyal Belgians escape the
clutches of the Nazis and flee to
England, freedom, and safety.
The escapades of this man of mys
tery who is wanted dead or alive by
the Gestapo makes Leslie Howard—
who played the part of the S.P. in
the movie—look like a sissie.
Recently he helped 100 persons,
who were beaded for a German
concentration camp in Belgium,
escape by detaching a railroad car
in which they were riding from
the rest of the train. So the story
goes.
He works with a small band of
fanatical patriots who also distrib
ute the world's most clandestine
newspaper, "La Libre Belgique." In
an interview which came over the
wire from London, he tells how, in
many cases, the Germans them
selves have unwittingly helped to
pass the revolutionary word by
carrying bundles of the newspapers
all over the country without know
ing they arc doing so.
It makes a good story, anyway.
WAR II has unquestion
ably had its share of drama.
The flight of Rudolf Hess to Scot
land last May was one of the most
theatrical and one of the most mys
terious episodes. It has yet to be ex
plained, and in all probability the
truth will not be known for many
years to come.
In his latest best-seller, "That Day
Alone," Pierre van Paasen sets forth
a new theory, which is as good—if
not better—than the run-of-the
mill.
Mr. van Paasen says that Hess,
who was Hitler's most intimate
friend, adviser, and confidante,
flew to England on the command
of his Fuehrer in order to nego
tiate an alliance with the British
for the purpose of exterminating
the Red scourge in the East.
Hess was commissioned for sev
eral reasons, asys van Paasen: Hit
ler felt that he could not arrange

matic channels since it might be in
