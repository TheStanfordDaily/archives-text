# 'Knickerbocker' Pronounced 'Fine and Funny' Production
## 
### 
Even with half the cast at the U.S.C. game, the week-end rehearsal of
"Knickerbocker Holiday" showed "great promise," according to Director
F. Cowles Strickland, and will be a "fine and funny" show.
The rehearsal, as rehearsals usually are, was a little confused. Scenery
was moving on and off, men were hung with imaginary rope to imaginary

gallows, soldiers marched with non-.
existent guns, and a few parts of
costumes were worn with everyday
clothes, but action, lines, and busi
ness, Strickland commented, are
shaping up well.
MARCUSES WOODEN LEG
Ted Marcuse (Governor Stuyves
sant) had some difficulty with his
wooden leg, so a few changes in
placing were made to make sure that
there would always be someone at
hand to pick him up if he slipped.
Musical accompaniment to the
solos and choruses of "Knicker
bocker Holiday" is being provided
by Professors Warern D. Allen, head
of the music division, and Herbert
Jan Popper, director of the opera
workshop. They give out with the
show's syncopated tunes on an elec
tric organ and a piano, respectively.
KATZENJAMMER ACCENT
One interesting item is the Katzen
jammer accent in which the New
Amsterdam Town Council gurgles
forth its lines and songs. Also in
teresting is Director Strickland's
light-footed manner of leading the
girls' chorus in its dance steps and
instructing it in curtsying.
"Knickerbocker Holiday," a hit
Broadway musical, will be present
ed by the Stanford Players Nov. 13,
14, and 15. Tickets may be obtained
in Room 202, Memorial Hall, 83
cents, tax included.
