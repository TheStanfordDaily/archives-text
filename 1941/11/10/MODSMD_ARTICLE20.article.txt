# Noise, Color Characterize S.C. Game
## Cards, Trojans Hold Cross-Gridiron Yells As Model T Rolls On 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Showing none of the usual ani
mosity that has characterized pre
vious Southern California games,
rooting sections of both universities
treated the spectators at. Saturday's
game to a happy exchange of pleas
antries.
The Trojans led off with a big
"Beat Call" to which Stanford re
plied "We will!" Next the Indians
yelled across "Beat U.C.L.A.!" and
S.C. came back with a noisy "Don't
worry!"
There was more spontaneous yell
ing from the time the S.P. special
pulled into the Los Angeles station
to the time when the last celebrant
left after Saturday night's celebrat
ing than at any time at Stanford.
SHIRT-SLEEVED CROWD
The crowd, most of whom were in
their shirt sleeves because of the
extreme November heat, was im
pressed by the orderly conduct of
the rooters. No disorderly service
man marred the game nor were there
many blue coats to arouse the Stan
ford rooters.
Through the courtesy of the Na
tional Broadcasting Company a spe
cial football broadcast and rally was
held Friday evening. Trojan Coach
Sam Barry gave a short talk and
then a football quiz tested the stu
dents' gridiron knowledge, with
Coach Barry being called in to de
termine the correct answer to sev
eral of the questions.
(iRID KNOWLEDGE
Three Stanford couples were
awarded an evening's entertainment
at the Palladium for successfully
showing the most football learning.
In the various Southern California
night clubs, the orchestras played all
the Stanford songs and the M.C.'s
led the crowds in the Stanford yells.
At half time, the Stanford band
formed a gigantic clock, giving the
correct time incidentally, and then
the words "T Time." For their stunt,
the S.C. band put up a U.S.C. tepee
and then gave an Indian war dance.
The Trojans were at their usual
best in presenting their cards stunts,
one of which, a likeness of Coach
Shaughnessy, drew a big cheer from
the huge crowd that saw the game.
