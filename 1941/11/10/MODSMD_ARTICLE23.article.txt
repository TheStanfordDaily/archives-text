# Stanford T Grid Victory Disappoints 90,000 Fans Who Demand Slaughter
## Coliseum Crowd Sees Farm Top S.C. By Two Touchdowns Using Magic Of Shaughnessy vs. Barry Defense 
### DON SELBY, Daily Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. !) (Spccial to The Daily.)— There's no doubt but
that a large part of the biggest crowd to see a football game in the nation
this season left Memorial Coliseum yesterday disappointed because Stan
ford didn't knock U.S.C. right out of the Stadium.
That's what comes with success. No longer is it enough for the Stan-

ford Indians, just about the top team
in the country today, to win a foot
ball game. They have to squash
their opponents before the fans are
satisfied.
Most of the 90,000 people came to
see what kind of magic Clark
Shaughnessy uses to make Stanford's
football team the most interesting
to watch in the nation.
INDIAN MAGIC
For a full quarter the Indians
showed them that magic, the magic
of good sound football with a lot
of hard physical work and a great
deal of gigantic mental work. The
rest was anti-climax.
The game the Indians used against
U.S.C. is reminiscent of the Vow
boys. The style of football was dif
ferent, but the color of the game
was the same, in that Stanford
scored quickly, early in the fray,
and won by refusing to allow the
other team to mark up any points.
The defense set-up that Sam Bar
ry threw at Albert and Co. was
really a honey. Perhaps all the credit
can't be given to the defense, for
personnel has a great deal to do
with it. But, whatever it was, Stan
ford had an awful time moving
through that line.
TROJAN DEFENSE
True, the statistics, which show
that the Indians rolled up 396 yards
from running plays, don't make it
seem as if the Trojans did any stop
ping at all. We'd bet, however, that
very few of those yards were made
on plays going through the line be
tween tackles.
It may have api>eared that the
Trojans clamped down on Stanford
during the last three quarters, but
the statistics again give ample evi
dence that the Indians were far the
superior team, out-running, out
passing, and out-kicking U.S.C.
Aside from chipped teeth suf
fered by Freddy Meyer and Bruno
Banducci and the reopening of a
cut over Loren LaPrade's eye, the
Cards came out of the fray in good
shape.
THE COLISEUM STORY
The way those Indians played ball
in the initial canto was proof
enough that they are still an outfit
that can and does score from any
place on the field at the darnedest
times, and when they were hot Sat
urday afternoon, they were sizzling.
Hardly had late-comers slid into
their seats when the white-clad
gridders from the Farm started to
move in their usual thrilling style.
The Indians appeared headed for
their first six points when, after
Pete Kmetovic shot out around the
defensive left half and slithered,
weaved, and snaked his way to the
Trojan 23-yard marker, the afore
mentioned Kmetovic, Milt VucLnich,
and Eric Armstrong pounded out a
first down on the U.S.C. 9.
But things didn't click, and after
| Voos gained to the four", a last-down
I lateral from Frankie Albert to
■ Kmetovic out to the right, was low,
! fumbled, and recovered for no gain.
ANOTHER WAY
Figuring that if they couldn't do
it near the goal, they ought to be
able to ring up six points some other
way, the Indians did it all in one big
push from 69 yards out. Little Hoot.
Armstrong, the boy who had a
bruised leg muscle, zoomed out
around the U.S.C. right end, scooted
down the sidelines, and taking ad
