# Coach Clark Says Team Didn't Loaf
## 'No Vote Taken By Card Team On Bowl Foe' 
### 
"Eighty-nine thousand fans," said
Rill Leiser to Clark Shaughnessy in
Hollywood over the Second Guess
ers broadcast Sunday, "spent a lot
of time and money to see your team
loaf through three quarters of the
game."
"Bill," replied Shaughnessy, "you
're just plain silly. If it. hadn't been
for the breakaways of Pete Kmeto
vie, the alertness of Arnie Meiners,
and the pluckiness of Erie Arm
strong, we would not have scored
at all. Southern California got too
stubborn for us. Their Bobby Rob
ertson was a great player; he almost
stymied us."
Turning attention to the game
across the Bay, Leiser noted, "The
Washington-California game didn't
end in a scoreless tie after all."
HUSKIES EARNED WIN
"The Huskies got their veteran
fullback, Jack Stackpool, back yes
terday," explained Shaughnessy,
"and Washington marched to its two
touchdowns, which were no flukes."
The third game to which the two
gave particular attention was the
number one upset of the week, the
Texas-Baylor 7-7 tie. "On the rec
ord," the coach commented, "Texas
Was the top team of the nation last
week. But the record changes every
week. Right now you'd have to say
that Texas A. & M. was the top team
of the Southwest." Baylor's tie was
attributed in part to their finding a
weakness in the Texas left tackle
position.
EASTERN UPSETS
The other major Saturday upsets
were covered by Lou Little and
Henry McLemore in the East, who
said Fordham was not on its toes
and was outplayed all the way, that
Pitt's great back, Jones, was hot and
(he team was determined, all factors
I jreducing the upset. The passing of
Bertelli, they decided, was the big
factor in Notre Dame's win over
Navy. Also, their opinion was that
Harvard trounced Army, because
Harvard has been a great but under
e: timated team all along.
Leiser and Shaughnessy inevitably
touched upon the topic of the Rose
Bowl, and upon the scoop story that
appeared in Saturday's papers that
the Stanford team had voted unani
mously for Texas as their Rose Bowl
opponent.
NO BOWL VOTE
"No vote was taken," Shaugh
nessy stated flatly. "The boys will
not take a vote on who they'll play
in the Rose Bowl unless they them
elves receive an invitation; and
they'll not play there till they beat
both Washington State and Califor
nia, and that is a very questionable
thing."
About the vote, Leiser explained
that a copy boy had asked a couple
of Stanford players, "If you're go
ing to the Rose Bowl, would you be
willing to meet Texas?" "Sure," an
â–  wered the players. And that was
the extent of it.
WHO WILL BEAT CARDS?
"Oregon State may go to the Rose
Bowl itself iJ Stanford loses one
more game," said Leiser. "But who
i: )',<'ing to beat Stanford, Coach?"
To which the coach replied, "Did
n't anybody tell you about Bob Ken
nedy of Washington State yester
day...the boy who scored three
touchdowns in seven minutes?"
"Not to mention the coast's best
p see, Billy Sewell, playing along
with Kennedy, and Susoeff, one of
the Coast's best pass receivers,"
Leiser added.
