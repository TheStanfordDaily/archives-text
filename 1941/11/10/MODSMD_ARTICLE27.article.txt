# Bookstore Shows Christmas Gifts
## 
### 
"Do your Christmas shopping
early," is the motto of the Stanford
Bookstore for this month, and to
back it up they already have their
line of Christmas gifts on display, ac
cording to Mrs. Beauchamp, direc
tor of the bookstore.
Though early for Christmas dis
plays, the bookstore is forced to
show its Christmas line now so that
the students will have a chance to
look it over and buy before leaving
for Christmas vacations.
The outstanding offer now is the
sale of Christmas cards. These cards
have been on display for two weeks,
and the bookstore is giving a 10 per
cent reduction on all orders placed
before the 15th of November. This
Christmas card reduction is only one
of the advantages offered by shop
ping early. There is also a large se
lection of gifts for that "trouble
some man" in the family.
