# Papoose Tilt Provides Preview of Grid Future
## Cal Wins 6-0; Vengeful Frosh Await Future 
### BILL HORNBY 
During the coming three years
Stanford and California will play
some of the greatest '"Big Games" in
the annals of West Coast football.
This fact was evident after watching
future stars of both teams play
some wide-open football as the Cali
fornia freshmen shaded the Stanford
Papeese, 6 to 0. in the stadium Sat
urday.
In football, as well as in war, the
axiom is still good that the last shot
wins the battle. Cannon Parkinson,
Jim Pettit, Pete August and the rest
of Harry Shipkey's outstanding
first-year crew ait? going to have
three more years of association with
Messrs. Ait Honegger, Jack Clif
ford, and Dick Millington, flashes
from the Berkeley institution. And
those three years, we venture the
opinion, will see the Cardinal wave
over the Gold and Blue.
ANOTHER FRANKIE?
Cannon Parkinson, wearing a
reminiscent number 13 jersey worn
last year by another Stanford quar
terback, Frank Culling Albert, has
the kicking, the running, and the
general intestinal equipment to lead
another great T sometime in the
future.
Then there is Jim Pettit, the Ben
son Tech bouncer from Portland,
who can play GO minutes of ball and
si ill turn out 25 and 35-yard runs.
A converted end, Pete August, was
underneath so many plays Saturday
that he got grass stains inside his
stomach. Don't forget ends like Jack
Heald and Dave Brown, who can
cling to passes like flies to flypaper in
the Belgian Congo (it's much stickier
there).
The Cubs, the first undefeated Cal
frosh eleven since 1936, certainly de
served their victory over a Shipkey
squad that was undefeated in 16
starts. But absolutely not by any
more than the six points that they
garnered.
THE SIX POINTS
The said six points were the re
sult of a fumble by a Stanford back
in the opening minutes. Cal recov
ered on the Stanford 25, and on the
next play Art Honegger began an
outstanding day's work with six
yards on a fake reverse of! tackle.
Then Jack Clifford threw a bullet
to Don Doerr on the 14. Rawn
ihrough tackle for nine yards, Clif
ford for one to the 4-yard line, an
other line buck to the three, one no
gain crash, and finally a two-yard
lunge by Honegger to pay dirt went
for the only score in the game.
Stanford spent the greater part of
the afternoon in coming back, never
quite far enough. Immediately after
(he Cal score, the frosh took the Cal
kick-ofT on their own 31. Ross Dana
made 3, and then Parkinson tossed
to Pettit who lateraled-fumbled to
Dana who fumbled-kicked the ball
to the Cal 47, where he fell on it
and set up a Stanford drive.
STANFORD FUMBLES
Zappetini made six, Pettit lost
one, and then Parkinson remem
bered the heritage of number 13
and flipped a pass to Atherton on
the 35 and followed with another to
Pettit on the Cal 12. The first-year
Cardinals collapsed on a fumble on
the next play. Cal recovered and
kicked out of danger.
Iri the second frame Pettit sprang
another of his end sweeps that kept
Cal in doubt of its touchdown honor
(singular) all afternoon. First for 11
and then for 6 and then for 7, and the
ball was on the Stanford 46. Park
inson's 43-yard flip was incomplete,
and on the last down another of his
flips lacked inches of a first down on
the Cal 47. Cal kicked out, and once
again the Parkinson Pass Company
got the ball to Cal's 36 but no
further.
CAL'S SECOND CHANCE
After a Cal ground drive, a Clif
ford pass to Rawn on the 10 and
Stanford was in the eight ball spot.
Cal powered to the 7. Honegger was
stopped on his bucks by the
Stanford line. Then Clifford passed
into the end zone for what should
have been another score, but Pete
August got it instead and scampered
to the 10 and safety.
SECOND HALF
The second half was pretty much
the same picture. Pettit and Park
inson kept almost breaking a Card
score lose â€” and almost wasn't
enough. Cal didn't have enough,
either, to crack the Stanford line
when the chips were down. In the
middle of the last period Cal's end
Smith snatched a pass from Parkin
son's hands and gave Cal another
start on the Stanford 37.
Clifford snaked his way through
Ihe Stanfords for 31 yards to the
six-yard line. Four times the Cali
fornia Cubs tried to crack the Stan
ford center, and four times Ship
key's charges proved that they are
one of the best Encina bunches in
years. No soap for Cal. Cal had
the ball in Stanford's land as the
gun ended the game.
