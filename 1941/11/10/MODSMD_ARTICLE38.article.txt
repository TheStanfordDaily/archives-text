# Kappa Sigs to Face Biz Grid Team as Mural Finals Loom
## 
### 
Pointing toward the championship finals in the Stanford Stadium on
Saturday, six leading contestants in the 1941 intramural grid race continue
their process of elimination this afternoon at 4.
Top interest will settle on the clash between Frank Wells and the
Kappa Sigma outfit against Hill Tweedie's nobody-thought-they-could-do-

team from
Business School. Seven players rep
resenting the Firehouse will be espe
cially interested in the proceedings,
the winner of the clash being .the
likely opponent of the Firemen in
the final tilt.
Kappa Sigma has qualified for
such an opinion of its abilities on
the basis of defeats of such teams as
the Delts, El Capitans, and Sigma
Chis. Someone ventured the opin-

ion that Biz School is "mediocre." If
j so, they are the most consistently
I 'mediocre" team in the race. Delta
Chi and Zeta Psi will corroborate.
Encina will turn out in mass to
watch 4W and 2E settle the cham
pionship of the brownstone man
l sion. 4W led by the passing and
power sweeps of Chuck Hopper
: will face a 2E team which has no one
outstanding and everyone capable.
The winner moves up the bracket
to meet the Dekes.
Sequoia and El Cuadro will play
off a tie for the championship of
their league.
The remainder of the playoffs will
be run off before Friday. The top
teams play as a preliminary to the
Washington State - Stanford game
Saturday.
Referees for the game will be
chosen from the whistle blowers of
the regular season, Stan Owen,
Thor Peterson, Bill Joslyn, and Leo
McCaffrey.
