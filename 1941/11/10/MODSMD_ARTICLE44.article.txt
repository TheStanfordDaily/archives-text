### 
A short-manned and out-of-po
sitioned Stanford soccer team lost to
the U.C.L.A. Bruins 2-1 in West
wood Saturday morning.
Although Harry Mallmey, Farm
soccer coach, promised that every
one who showed up for the non-con
ference game could play in it, only
eleven men did show up.
Tefvik Sadullah, assistant soccer
coach, scored the only Stanford goal
in the game. He dribbled in close in
the second period and banged ii past
the goalie.
Because of the few players, every
one had to play a full game anc 1
many men had to play positions
which they had never played before.
It was a hard-contested game and
the Stanford players were in the
game the whole way.
Captain Jack Burns, who is the
standard goalie for the Cards, played
in the forward >line since there were
so few forwards.
Other players in the game were:
Dick Wilbur, goalie; Frank Card,
left full; Clair Peck, right full; Jack
Pagan, right half; Bob Mostow, cen
ter half; Howard Voss, left half; Fer
nandt; Eleta, left wing; Bob Sol, in
side left; Tefvik Sadullah, center
forward; Johnny Gertridge, inside
right; and Jack Buins, right wing.
