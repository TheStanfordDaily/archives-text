# IN MEMORIAM Sally Louise Travers, '45
## 
### 
A RADIO news commentator announced
Saturday night that tragedy had inter
rupted a carefree football week-end, taking the
life of a Stanford girl who was traveling south
by auto. It was a moment or two before the
girl's name was given.
To the great majority of listeners who were
not parents of Stanford girls traveling south, it
was just a moment. To those who were, the
moment must have been an eternity during
which there was so much time for panic to grip
the mind, for grief to stand by.
And the next moment, panic subsided and
left the stark tragedy of the fact, and the grief
of the parents of Sally Louise Travers.
In the rooting section, the news passed from
person to person. She would have been in the
stands helping to seat the rooters. On the
campus, Sally Travers' friends, especially those
in Roble, were shocked and unhappy. They
felt deeply the empty hopelessness which at
tends the passing of youth's contemporaries.
All those parents — all of Stanford, what
wouldn't they give to be reading about two
victories this morning, on the gridiron and on
the highway, instead of one victory and one
victim story?
And what can be given, or said, or done to
turn back time and automobiles in their flights?
