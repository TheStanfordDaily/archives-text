# America and War
## 
### 
WE Americans are usually practical people.
Fighting for our independence, conquering
frontiers, building cities and homes, we have
had to be practical. True, ideals have inspired
us, but never blinded us.
Today, however, a few good citizens decry
the "hypocrisy," the "politics," the "diplomacy"
of the Roosevelt Administration and its foreign
policy.
"He's leading us into war," they shout, "and
the neutrality revision is the last straw. He
himself is declaring war, an illegal war. Why
doesn't he declare war, legally, through Con
gress?" Critics are against either his methods
or his policy or both.
Let's use the analogy of the local robber and
murderer. He has attacked 15 houses in your
neighborhood and now he is moving to your
house. Every time he is caught he swears he
won't do it again. But he said that 10 houses
away.
Would you wait for him to attack? Would you
refuse to help those neighbors organized to
light him? Would you go after him unarmed?
Would you warn him that you are coming after
him? Would you call everybody in town and
tell them your plans? Would you debate your
plans with them for weeks?
No, you'd be practical.
And our Administration is being practical in

dealing with the robbers and murderers who
are terrorizing our European neighbors.
The President has seen the danger and has
answered it with a tremendous re-armament
program. He has extended our defense lines
to strategic points in the Atlantic and Pacific.
With each new base strengthened and com
pleted, the President could just sit back, relax
ing in a "Maginot Line" attitude.
But the lesson of France is too recent. The
murderers of the seas must be apprehended.
Materials for our Allies do little good at the bot
tom of the ocean. So, the President says we'll
make the first move, and the naval war begins.
Have the people who protest this action for
gotten that this is an emergency? That imme
diate action is required if this democracy is to
live? The President has a mandate from the
people to LEAD the nation. In ordinary times,
he could stop at each decision and listen longer
to the people. Not quite so today.
The President has observers throughout the
world. He certainly has more information on
the conflict than any other citizen in this coun
try. Undoubtedly military and diplomatic rea
sons prevent him from revealing all his infor
mation to the nation. Is this not wise in critical
times?
And will it be necessary to declare war? Has
the time come? We believe the President has
the answers, and will reveal them at the most
opportune moment.
When Congress votes for revision of the Neu
trality Act, it knows the possible consequences.
Then, why shout about an illegal undeclared
war? Let's be practical.—Herman Silverman

With each new base strengthened and com
pleted, the President could just sit back, relax

But the lesson of France is too recent. The
murderers of the seas must be apprehended.
Materials for our Allies do little good at the bot
tom of the ocean. So, the President says we'll
make the first move, and the naval war begins.
Have the people who protest this action for
gotten that this is an emergency? That imme
diate action is required if this democracy is to
live? The President has a mandate from the
people to LEAD the nation. In ordinary times,
he could stop at each decision and listen longer
to the people. Not quite so today.
The President has observers throughout the
world. He certainly has more information on
the conflict than any other citizen in this coun
try. Undoubtedly military and diplomatic rea
sons prevent him from revealing all his infor
mation to the nation. Is this not wise in critical
times?
And will it be necessary to declare war? Has
the time come? We believe the President has
the answers, and will reveal them at the most
opportune moment.
When Congress votes for revision of the Neu
trality Act, it knows the possible consequences.
Then, why shout about an illegal undeclared
war? Let's be practical.—Herman Silverman
WE Americans are usually practical people.
Fighting for our independence, conquering
frontiers, building cities and homes, we have
had to be practical. True, ideals have inspired
us, but never blinded us.
Today, however, a few good citizens decry
the "hypocrisy," the "politics," the "diplomacy"
of the Roosevelt Administration and its foreign
policy.
"He's leading us into war," they shout, "and
the neutrality revision is the last straw. He
himself is declaring war, an illegal war. Why
doesn't he declare war, legally, through Con
gress?" Critics are against either his methods
or his policy or both.
Let's use the analogy of the local robber and
murderer. He has attacked 15 houses in your
neighborhood and now he is moving to your
house. Every time he is caught he swears he
won't do it again. But he said that 10 houses
away.
Would you wait for him to attack? Would you
refuse to help those neighbors organized to
light him? Would you go after him unarmed?
Would you warn him that you are coming after
him? Would you call everybody in town and
tell them your plans? Would you debate your
plans with them for weeks?
No, you'd be practical.
And our Administration is being practical in

dealing with the robbers and murderers who
are terrorizing our European neighbors.
The President has seen the danger and has
answered it with a tremendous re-armament
program. He has extended our defense lines
to strategic points in the Atlantic and Pacific.
