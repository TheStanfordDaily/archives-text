CONGRATULATIONS are due Rally Com
mittee for handling successfully a football
week-end 400 miles from home.
The half-time card stunts at the S.C. game
were done smoothly, and this served to prove
that Rally Committee could do it, after a par
ticularly unfortunate preceding week-end when
Stanford engaged Santa Clara and the stunts
flopped. That failure was partly due to rain and
to inability to meet an emergency.

That Rally Committee profited by that expe
rience was evidenced by their most recent job.
They made a comeback and are worthy of com
mendation, as are the Stanford rooters and yell
leaders, whose spontaneity of spirit exhausted
all the yells in the book and improvised new
ones, even when the game grew somewhat tire
some.
The performance of Rally Committee and of
the cheering section this week-end was proof,
if any were needed, that the Stanford spirit is
not a myth.â€”Harold Shafer
