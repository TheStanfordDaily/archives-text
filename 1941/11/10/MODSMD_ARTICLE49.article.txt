### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
TIIE DIPLOMATIC WAY

events of the past week-end made it one
k of the most newsworthy in many a month. In
the first place almost every team that was mentioned
as a possible Rose Bowl candidate was knocked mo
mentarily out of consideration. Down went Navy,
Army, Fordham, and most surprising of all, down went
Texas to a tie with the impotent Baylor Bears.
But that wasn't all that happened. For the United
States was still having labor difficulties, and this time
it was announced that 350,000 railroad workers would
soon be on strike, to enforce demands for a 30 per cent
increase.
And tension was increasing along the Chinese, Japa
nese fronts, and reports came that the Japanese are
landing more troops in Indo-China, that the Japanese
have sent a special ambassador to the United States
in a "war or peace" mission, and that President
Roosevelt is considering the evacuation of our marines
from China, which means that relations between the
U.S. and Japan may break.
And all the while the battle of Russia was going on,
and reports seemed to indicate that the Russians were
slowing the Nazi advances. And the British announced
that their planes had dealt Berlin and other key Ger
man cities, severe bombing raids over the week-end.

OUT the biggest story of the week came from Wash
ington. where the Senate passed the administra
tion bill which will allow American merchant ships to
mount guns and sail into war zones and belligerent
ports with supplies. After eleven days of torrid dis
cussion, the bill nullifying the shipping restrictions of
the neutrality act was passed.
And what docs this mean to the United States.
It means that from now on we are going to pile goods
and supplies on our ships, and deliver them directly
to the British docks. And we are doing so because the
United States feels that there should be freedom of
the seas. The president says the bill was passed be
cause there must be freedom of the seas. But how
can anyone expect to have freedom of the seas, when
all of Europe is locked in a struggle for its life. There
are people over there that are struggling, fighting,
scratching, killing for their heads, for their eyes, for
their children and for their homes, and not for the
freedom of a pile of water. How can we expect Hitler
and his men to watch supplies and materials that are
going to be used against him, land safely, quietly into
British docks, without doing anything about it. Would
we think about freedom of the seas if we were en
gaged in a death struggle with some powerful nation
and another power kept supplying our enemy. We
wouldn't think about it, and Hitler won't think about it.
If we arm our merchant ships and send them over
where they don't belong, we've got to expect them to
be attacked. If we expect them to be attacked, and if
we expect to fight back, that means we are at war
with Germany. And that is what the bill means. It
is not a declaration of the freedom of the seas, but a
declaration of war. Maybe it is right for this country
to declare war, and maybe it isn't. But I don't like
this sneaky, political, diplomatic way of declaring war,
because I hate politics, politicians, diplomacy, and
"necessary evils."
