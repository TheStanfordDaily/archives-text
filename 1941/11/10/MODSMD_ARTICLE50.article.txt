# 'Sergeant York' Presents Fine, Sensitive Portrayal
## 
### 
"SERGEANT YORK," now playing at the Fox-Stanford Theater in
I'alo Alto.
In these days of flag-waving and high-pressure patriotism it is a
pleasure to see an honest, sincere, and moving story of a typical American
soldier of the first World War without benefit of the sensationalism which

ordinarily accompany the
| treatment of this theme. Such is
"Sergeant York," and it is a superb
picture indeed.
Gary Cooper turns in one of his
fine and sensitive performances as
| Alvin York. Obviously he is a natu
! ral for the part of the simple Ten-
I nessee farmer who becomes Ameri
! ca's number 1 war hero for his brav-
I ery in the field. His slow drawl,
I straightforward manner, and gawky
| mannerisms mark him definitely as
| (he epitome of the plain American
j son of the soil.
MAGNIFICENT ACTING
Cooper does a magnificent piece
j of acting in the scene where he is
converted from a hard - drinking,
bar-fighting rounder into a deeply
j religious man. It is all done in pan
; tomime with a superb musical back
ground—as requested by the real
I Sergeant York—and is as subtle and
J moving a thing as we have ever
I seen.
Joan Leslie, one of Warner Broth
! ers" new discoveries, turns in a very
I capable piece of work as York's
! sweetheart. This young lady shows
| definite possibilities; we hope that
{the brothers Warner will not be-
I come too wrapped up in Bette Davis
not to give her a chance.
BRENNAN EXCELLENT
Walter Brennan, as always, pre
sents an excellent characterization
as the pastor who is Sergeant York's
mentor and guide.
You will find it well worth your
while to take three hours off to see
"Sergeant York"; it is as inspired a
| production as we have seen come
; out of Hollywood in a good long
j time.—Craig
