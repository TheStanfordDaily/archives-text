# English Navy Sinks 10-Ship Italy Convoy
## Moscow Line Breaks In One Sector; Reds Stop Nazis in South 
### United Press 
The war blazed up again in the
Mediterranean Sunday with the
complete destruction by British
warships of a 10-ship Italian convoy
and one escorting destroyer, while
cn the Russian front a German
breakthrough southwest of Moscow
and further Axis advances in the
Crimea were reported.
The Rod capital appeared to be
in no immediate danger, however,
and the war entered its 21st week
with the Russians not only strongly
defending Moscow and Leningrad
but on the offensive before both
cities. German hopes to take the
Soviet's two greatest cities before
hard winter in "the last great bat
tle of the year" apparently had been
frustrated by bad weather and stout
Russian resistance.
NAZIS HELD IN SOUTH
On the critical southern front, the
German advance toward Rostov was
still held up, Sevastopol showed no
signs of surrender and the Russians
still held the Kerch peninsula lead
ing to the Kerchenski Strait—four
mile water gap separating the Cri
mea and the Caucasus.
Principal war developments in
cluded:
1. A British cruiser and destroyer
force in the central Mediterranean,
the Admiralty announced, early Sun
day attacked and completely de
stroyed a 10-ship Italian convoy pro
tected by Italian cruisers and de
stroyers south of Taranto, without
damage to the British.
RUSSIANS RETREAT
2. The German high command an
nounced the capture of Yalta, port
of secondary importance on the Cri
mean south coast, and said Axis
forces "successfully continued the
pursuit of the beaten enemy" along
that coast and eastward on the
Kerch peninsula.
The Germans claimed they were
within 30 miles o'f Moscow, in an
unspecified sector. A DNB dispatch
from that front said Nazi forces Sat
urday broke through and rolled up
Soviet defense positions, capturing
80 bunkers and inflicting heavy
losses.
ON THE MOSCOW FRONT
3. Soviet dispatches reported
strong Russian counterattacks in the
region around Moscow and in the
Donets Basin in the south, where a
Nazi alpine regiment was said to
have been smashed.
Furious fighting was reported on
the Moscow sector, where Russian
counter-attacks admittedly made
little or no progress, and one line in
a dispatch of the official Tass Agency
suggested a major German break
through.
The Royal Air Force again sent
strong bomber formations raiding
western Germany Saturday night,
concentrating on Essen and report
edly doing heavy damage, but the
attack was considerably below that
of Friday night when (500 to 800
bombers carried out the biggest Brit
ish raids of the war from Norway
through Germany to Italy.
The high comamnd in Rome said
today that British planes again
raided Naples last night.

Furious fighting was reported on
the Moscow sector, where Russian
counter-attacks admittedly made
little or no progress, and one line in

suggested a major German break

The Royal Air Force again sent
strong bomber formations raiding
western Germany Saturday night,
concentrating on Essen and report
edly doing heavy damage, but the

The war blazed up again in the
Mediterranean Sunday with the
complete destruction by British
warships of a 10-ship Italian convoy
and one escorting destroyer, while
cn the Russian front a German
breakthrough southwest of Moscow
and further Axis advances in the
Crimea were reported.
The Rod capital appeared to be
in no immediate danger, however,
and the war entered its 21st week
with the Russians not only strongly
defending Moscow and Leningrad
but on the offensive before both
cities. German hopes to take the
Soviet's two greatest cities before
hard winter in "the last great bat
tle of the year" apparently had been
frustrated by bad weather and stout
Russian resistance.
NAZIS HELD IN SOUTH

German advance toward Rostov was
still held up, Sevastopol showed no
signs of surrender and the Russians
still held the Kerch peninsula lead
ing to the Kerchenski Strait—four
mile water gap separating the Cri
mea and the Caucasus.
Principal war developments in
cluded:
1. A British cruiser and destroyer
force in the central Mediterranean,
the Admiralty announced, early Sun

that coast and eastward on the
Kerch peninsula.
The Germans claimed they were
within 30 miles o'f Moscow, in an
