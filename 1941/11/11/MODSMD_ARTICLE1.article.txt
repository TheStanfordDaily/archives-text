### AMIE REICHERT 
I7LEVEN o'clock, hush. Remember.
" J In the artificial stillness remem
ber the dead, remember the misery
and the disillusion and the despair
and the triumph of bestiality and
the broken word and the violated
peace, and now again The War.
On November 11, 1918, there was
a silence at 11 o'clock too. A silence
that was pathetically short-lived.
From the moment of its inception it
was stirred restively with murmurs
which became groans, rumbles,
roars, until now the world is torn
once more by the strident cacaphony
of war. And nowhere is there si
lence.
In the midst of all the shouting
a great scourge swept over Europe.
At first it was scarcely noticed, or
if it was, few feared it, many aided
it. So-called "liberals" and con
servatives alike saw no reason to
check the fascist fury, for clearly,
here was an ideology pledged to
the annihilation of holshcvism, an
ideology therefore allied with the
vested interests, with the privi
leges of wealth and power, with
the defenders of the status quo.
So they ignored it, laughed it ofl,
nourished it, and when it became too
big to be ignored, laughed off,
nourished, they appeased it. This is
in part the story of fascism and how
it grew.

there have been men
who cry peace, and today once
more there are such. Austria,
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Belgium,
Holland, Luxembourg, Norway, Den
mark, France, Yugoslavia, Greece —
these are not proof enough that the
fascist dictator does not mean peace.
Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria, Italy
—these are not adequate evidence
that his domination is all but ines
eapahle. The bombing of Britain,
the blitz against Russia, the attacks
on the Middle East, the Tripartite
alliance with Italy and Japan, the
fifth column in South America—these
are not sufficient testimony that his
appetite is insatiable, that his plans
do not stop short of a World Empire.
Munich failed to convince the
appeasers that a negotiated peace,
a "peace in our time" on Herr
Hitler's terms is an impossibility
—worse, a nightmare. The Lind
berghs and the Wheelers go on
prcaehing the gospel of appease
ment, of negotiated peace.
They refuse to recognize and
acknowledge the existence of evil.
They allay the fears of their coun
trymen with the anaesthesia of
isolation, with the optimism of
compromise.
They continue to talk peace—even
today. They do not understand—or
perhaps they do not wish to under
stand—that peace is not an end in
itself but a means to many ends.
They have lost their sense of values;
they have traded their ideals and
they would trade the ideals of
democracy for a false and temporary
security.

r jpHEY talk of peace as though it
were a commodity which may
be purchased cheaply—as indeed it
may be if one will take slavery, the
triumph of barbarism, and the anni
hilation of freedom, justice, truth,
and grace into the bargain.
By all means let us talk of
pcacc. Let us talk of the peace
that will come after this war,
after the fascist terror has been
struck forever from the earth. Let
us talk then of a pcacc that will
wipe out the causes of totalitar
ianism, a pcacc that will end
war not for our time alone but
for all time. We shall not make
the same mistakes we did in 1918
when the time for talk of pcacc
comcs.
But until then, let us talk of war.
Let us continue to aid the British
and the Russians so long as they
fight our battle—the battle of all
humanity — against the forces of
barbarism.

"Gentlemen may cry, Pcacc,
pcacc, pcacc—but there is no
pcacc. The war is actually begun!
.. .Is life so dear or pcacc so sweet
as to be purchased at the price of
chains and slavery? Forbid it, Al
mighty (iod. I know not what
coursc others may take; but as for
me, give me liberty, or give me
death."
