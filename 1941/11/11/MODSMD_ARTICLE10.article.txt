# YOSEMITE, WE ARE HERE!
## Weed Taches Slat Riders Fundamentals

In a sea of skis, white gym stilts
and brown legs, Sun Valley is being
re-enacted regularly at Stanford.
Attired in sweat sox, ski boots and
skis, men and women ski addicts
gather for instruction given by Miss
Luell Weed three times a week, on
a course laid out in back of the
Women's Gym. All that was missing
was the snow and everybody's dark
glasses.
"First we'll do our limbering-up
exercises. Ready everybody? Ev
erybody down, (This meant nothing
to one of the girls in the rear who
was completely down in a welter of
straw and skis.) All rightâ€”one two,
one two, one two," Miss Weed count
ed, and the class began to go slowly
clown and come up in short, quick
bends at the knee accompanied by
follow-through motkms with the
arms.
WHEN LIMBERED UP
When the class had sufficiently
limbered themselves up, they tried
their kicking exercise, which again
saw some of the more active kickers
down in the straw, which substitutes
for snow on the Stanford "course."

white slopes of Yo.semit<_' kept the
class at it, including the late .strag
glers who do their dry-skiing with
out benefit of the warming-up ex
ercises.
"Dry-skiing helps strengthen the
knees and the ankles as well as gen
erally limbering up the body. Our
purpose is to help educate the nov
ice as well as condition the expe
rienced .skier," Miss Weed said.
(iV.VI CREDIT
Classes are held three times a
week, once a general class for both
men and women and the other two
times a class for each yroup sepa
rately. Regular gym credit is given
and the classes have been held for
the last five years at Stanford. Be
cause of the increased interest, this
year the class :ias had to be limited.
The practice course occupies about
live hundred square feet over which
has been spread about twelve bales
of straw, which protects the surface
of the skis and makes a softer spot
to fall.
RENTED EQUIPMENT
All equipment is rented from a
Palo Alio sport shop. Too big to go
into the regular lockers, the skis are
kept in the basement "ski lodge" of
the Women's Gym.
Most of fJit menvrxn's of the class
are or will be members of the Stan
ford Ski Club. Through the Ski
Club, reduced rates for skiing at Yo
semite are obtained and this year
will see large week-end crowds at
the resort.
it looks like a big year for Yo
sernite, tfie Stanford ski team, and
the snow.
