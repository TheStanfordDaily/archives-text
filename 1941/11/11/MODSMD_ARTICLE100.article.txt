to match the dress, are a graceful frame for the decollete neckline and provide an old-style touch in the fan. Sequins,

gomery, center, in white flowing chiffon. Ruffles, the black velvet shoulder straps and streamers are old-fashioned eye
catchers. Whether it's an exit or entrance for Amie Reichert, right, it will be graceful in this black tulle bouffant
gown. Black lace is appliqued on the bodice and shoulder straps. —both from Magnin's. Eleanor Watson appears, left,
