# Luxury Tax Hits Fur Sales; New Coats Generally Bulky
## 
### 
Furs used to be costly, but now they are super luxurious.
Prices advanced from ten to thirty percent over last year, hut fur busi
ness was phenomenal during the months of August and September; since
the luxury tax has become effective, sales have been few.
The general characteristic of the new fur coat gives a bulky appearancc

—a stylish fullness which tends to
be exaggerated. There is nothing
extreme, but just a moderation—
especially of the shoulders. They
have a mildly square effect, not as
tilted as they formerly were, yet cer
tainly not droopy.
The sleeves are of two types. They
are either like tunnels, with plenty
of room for ventilation to seep
through the arms, or they gather at
the wrist in the new mellon style.
If the sleeve line is of the former
type, the highest fashion is to have
turned-backed, wide cuffs.
Round Collars Rich
Most coats are not collaiiess. A
small, round collar tends to give a
soft, rich effect.
Muskrat is» dyed, blended, and
worked in the manner of mink and
takes first spot in the rating of spec
tator furs. It is a practical coat, in
asmuch as it can be used for both
street and dressy wear, and has
proved to be very durable.
Second only to muskrat is the
American opposum. These skins
make up a sporty coat with a lively
appearance. This fur is semi-long
haired in a natural shade with silver
top hair. It is a classic for utility.
Casuals Long
Also the usual leopard cat, beaver,
and nutria skins are styled in long
or three-quarter lengths for casual
wear. Mouton is very popular around
the campus. It is a reasonably priced,
beaver-dyed fur and gives a smooth,
velvety appearance. Skunk is still

a popular all-occasion fur.
For dressy afternoon, the most
stylish furs are kolinsky, China and
eastern mink, and Alaska seal. These
skins are made up with fullness but
not flare.
Scarfs of sable, marten, fox, and
kolinsky are always good, from the
durable as well as fashion angles.
