# "Old lamps for new?"

### 
To the coed this cry means that
her newest jewelry comes from
grandmother's treasured old col
lections, for heirlooms are the
vogue. Strands of rose carved
ivory and coral or amber or crystal
beads are marvelous dangling on
the bright campus sweaters, and
the longer and the loopier, the
belter.
Lavaliers are in great demand
and quaint old gold jewelry such
as clips, bracelets and earrings are
tops for those dressy occasions.
There are also some beautiful (and
tricky) gadgets to be worn in the
hair. Many of the charms on the
jangling date bracelets are rescued
antiques that make delightful
conversation pieces.
