PINK-RED WINS
The farmerette's favorite color this
fall is "scarlet slipper," a brilliant
reddish pink, with "stop red" run
ning a close second. Color trends in
Jul lipsticks are bright red and pink;
purple undertones have relinquished
1h( ir popularity to warmer, more
vivid natural shades.
Many prefer to have a number of
miniature lipsticks and a wider se
lection of shades; here the cheaper
lip: ticks of the dime stores hold
sway, and quantity, not quality,
reigns.
DEFENSE AGAIN
The names of the shades of all
brands have jumped on the band
wagon of national defense.
"Courage red," "1776," "Regiment
red," "Betsy Ross red" and "Old
(.dory" among them. Pan-American
• ntiments are also expressed in col
names—"Toreador," Spanish red,"
"tropic," "Jungle red," and barbaric."
On drab, rainy days—to bolster her

<veaters —the co-ed wears "sing
i ; red," "rosy future," "red dice,"
' red pepper," "school house red,"
' poker-chip red," "sapphire," or
. clamine day." On those ever so
iir ortant dates to create a lasting
i , -cession, she wears "siren," "can

"i. i liscreet," "heart throb," or "dark

PINK-RED WINS
The farmerette's favorite color this
fall is "scarlet slipper," a brilliant
reddish pink, with "stop red" run
ning a close second. Color trends in
Jul lipsticks are bright red and pink;
purple undertones have relinquished
1h( ir popularity to warmer, more

reigns.

brands have jumped on the band
wagon of national defense.
"Courage red," "1776," "Regiment
red," "Betsy Ross red" and "Old

"tropic," "Jungle red," and barbaric."

' red pepper," "school house red,"
' poker-chip red," "sapphire," or
