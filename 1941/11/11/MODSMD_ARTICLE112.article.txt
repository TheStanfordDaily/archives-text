# Skirt Lengths Foil Experts; To Stay Short
## 
### 
Rumors are rampant that women's
dresses will soon become longer.
From the historical viewpoint this
forecast seems very unlikely. In
stead, they shall probably remain
short until the war crisis is over, if
history follows its repetitious habits.
For centuries clothes have been a
barometer of the times. In the Gre
cian era men's clothes were short to
fit the active sports in which they
loved to participate. In the Middle
Ages the clothes were long to hide
the body which the Church thought
should be disregarded. The Renais
sance brought an era of extremely
elaborate clothes, suitable to the for
mal court life of the times. And so
on through the ages.
During the twentieth century
clothes have changed radically. Until
1915 they were long, but the first
World War brought in ankle-length
dresses. Women could not have the
necessary cloth and money to get
yards of material. Then there was a
short period after the War when
business was booming as a tempo
rary reaction. Skirts went down a
little again; however, this soon
changed as we entered into the de
pression of 1929.
As we edge into the second World
War, hems have edged up too. His
tory makes it probable that we shall
not lengthen them again until times
become more settled. A silk shortage
is already evident, and there may be
other fabric shortages.
Unless history fails to repeat itself
—for the first time—we had better
become used to knees, good, bad,
and indifferent.
