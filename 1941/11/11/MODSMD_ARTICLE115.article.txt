# Interior Decorators Live In Lovely Dream World
## 
### HELEN LIVINGSTON 
Endowed with four walls and the most basic pieces of furniture, the
average college girl promptly runs amuck and ereates a room thai looks
like a combination folding bed and potato-masher. "Mademoiselle" may
go into ecstasies ever the delights of matching drapes and bedspreads, in
terior decorators may rant and tear their hair, but the coed blissfully goes
on her own sweet way, creating >

chaos out of order.
Pillows of various sizes, shapes,
and materials; flower pots with wi.sps
of some type of deceased trailing
arbutus; colorful Matson Line men
us; almost any kind of picture, from
Van Gogh to Catalina-on-a-Clear-
Day; rugs, drapes, and spreads that
certainly don't match; veritable me
nageries of stuffed animals, ranging
from gnus to gorillas; and of course,
the inevitable photographs of the
stronger sex—tall men, short men,
handsome men, ugly men, but men
leering out at you from bureaus,
walls, and desks; this is the room of
the Stanford woman.
AND GENERAL STUFF . . .
Add to this some pretty good col
lections of overdue library books
and a dash of color here and there,
supplied by artistically draped items
from the wardrobe, and your picture
is almost complete.
"But," cries our indignant coed,
"home is where the heart is. This
may be messy, but I love it."
Ah yes, but you don't know what
you're missing until you have cre
ated for yourself an atmosphere of
charm and grace by harking to the
advice that is being flung at you
from every quarter on how to deco
rate your room in six easy lessons.
"One's room is an expression of
one's personality," gush the maga
zines; if this is true of the modern
college girl's bedchamber, heaven
help us!
NO ROCOCO, PLEASE
We do not suggest that you go in
for delicate touches of French pro
vincial, but we do make a plea for
a little attention to making your
room more attractive. Plaid drapes
are swell, but they don't go with
print pillows and calico (spreads;
Cezanne is a pretty good artist, but

he doesn't shine placed next to a !
Hawaiian print.
One of the more interesting no- j
lions we have noticed is a solid color j
bedspread edged in print, with !
drapes and pillows matching the
trimming on the spread. Another
idea is printed chintz drapes, with a
candlewiek spread carrying out the j
dominant color in the drapes, the j
pillows covered in chintz. All man- j
tier of tricks may be played with
these combinations, but the various
colors and materials should tie to
gether some way or other.

A room may be brightened up J
considerably with the addition of j
well-chosen pictures, which should
be related, however remotely, to the j
basic color scheme. Flower prints
are always attractive, and those
nicely-framed copies of well-known
paintings that you can rent in Union
and Lagunita are stunning and ef
fective.
Then there are always those mi
nor, but extremely important touches
that are added with cigarette boxes |
and ash trays, vases which could on
occasion be filled with flowers,
dresser scarfs, and such like. After j
all, Stanford is pretty nice about
providing us with the fundamental
elements of a good-looking room; ,
with a little effort we can do the rest.
