# Defense Hits Farm Woman's Silk Clad Legs
## 
### 
Although campus opinion seems to
favor a return to the tradition of
silk stockings on the Quad, world
conditions seem destined to thwart
the desire of Stanfordites. Bobby
sox are probably here to stay for
the "duration" at least.
Men and women showed a remark
able unanimity in their views on the
stockings vs. sox controversy. Men's
comments on the change to sox in
cluded "Looks horrid, honest to
God," "Can't get used to it" and "Sox
are too much like high school." A
double feature combination of sox
over stockings was the preference of
one male middle-of-the-roader.
While most of the women pre
ferred the stockings from an esthetic
point of view, sox got their votes for
practicality, since they are less deli
cate, less expensive, and more com
fortable. As one said,
"Stanford is justly noted for its
stocking tradition, but sox are more
practical." Another favored sox, ex
cept in the rain when sox worn over
stockings are the thing.
A survey of Palo Alto stores shows
that the stocking situation is not
hopeless, but that most prudent
Farmerettes will save their silk and
nylon hose for special wear. Al
though a very few all-silk stockings
in good shades are still available at
prices of $1.35, $1.50 and $1.65, no
more will be forthcoming until U.S.-
Japanese relations improve consid
erably.
Nylon, silk's biggest competitor in
peace-time, has been drafted for
war-time tasks, although it is hoped
some can be exempted from service
to be used in stockings. The present
supply of nylon hose is restricted
mainly to very dark shades, selling
at $1.65, but store officials believe
the output will be materially -in
creased in the next few months de
spite defense needs.
A "dark ho(r)se" for the future is
the stocking just introduced which
features the new construction of
rayon foot and top with a silk leg.
Priced at $1.00, these stockings come
in a variety of popular shades. One
saleslady predicted that this com
bination of rayon and silk would be
as durable as the all-silk.
If, however, either the family for
tune or the stocking supply disap
pear completely, there is a sizeable
selection of bobby sox from which
to choose.
Starting at 55c for those contain
ing 15% wool, prices go up with in
crease in wool content. A current
favorite are the plaid sox, which sell
for $1.25 a pair in the wool.
Copies can be obtained in cotton
for 65c.
All of which seems to indicate that
no Stanford woman need go bare
legged, world conditions be what
they may.

stockings are the thing.
A survey of Palo Alto stores shows
that the stocking situation is not
hopeless, but that most prudent
Farmerettes will save their silk and
nylon hose for special wear. Al
though a very few all-silk stockings
in good shades are still available at
prices of $1.35, $1.50 and $1.65, no
more will be forthcoming until U.S.-
Japanese relations improve consid
erably.
Nylon, silk's biggest competitor in
peace-time, has been drafted for
war-time tasks, although it is hoped
some can be exempted from service
to be used in stockings. The present
supply of nylon hose is restricted
mainly to very dark shades, selling
at $1.65, but store officials believe
the output will be materially -in
creased in the next few months de
spite defense needs.
A "dark ho(r)se" for the future is
the stocking just introduced which
features the new construction of
rayon foot and top with a silk leg.
Priced at $1.00, these stockings come
in a variety of popular shades. One
saleslady predicted that this com
bination of rayon and silk would be
as durable as the all-silk.
If, however, either the family for
tune or the stocking supply disap
pear completely, there is a sizeable
selection of bobby sox from which
to choose.
Starting at 55c for those contain
ing 15% wool, prices go up with in
crease in wool content. A current
favorite are the plaid sox, which sell
for $1.25 a pair in the wool.
Copies can be obtained in cotton
for 65c.
All of which seems to indicate that
no Stanford woman need go bare
legged, world conditions be what
they may.
Although campus opinion seems to
favor a return to the tradition of
silk stockings on the Quad, world
conditions seem destined to thwart
the desire of Stanfordites. Bobby
sox are probably here to stay for
the "duration" at least.
Men and women showed a remark
able unanimity in their views on the
stockings vs. sox controversy. Men's
comments on the change to sox in
cluded "Looks horrid, honest to
God," "Can't get used to it" and "Sox
are too much like high school." A
double feature combination of sox
over stockings was the preference of
one male middle-of-the-roader.
While most of the women pre
ferred the stockings from an esthetic
point of view, sox got their votes for
practicality, since they are less deli
