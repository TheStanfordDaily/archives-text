# Christmas Cards to Be Gentle Though World Undertone Grim
## 
### 
Though "Peace on Earth and Good VV'iil to Men'* are, in the larger
sense, hollow sentiments for this year's Christinas season, the gentle Christ
mas spirit will do its best to take the nation's heart again this season, ac
cording to the shop-keepers.
And, since the majority of us have more friends and relatives than we

have cash for presents, the Christmas,
card appropriation shall take its usual
place among the Yule budget items.
Perhaps because of the grim un
dertone in the season's joyousness,
the majority of the "belly-laugh"
variety of cards have been elimi
nated from the showcases and sam
ple books. Likewise, the chauvinis
tic flag-wavers of last December
have retired to decent obscurity.
ANGELS IN RED FLANNEL
From the American Artists Group
come the superb cards designed by
such men as Adolph Dehn, Dale
Nichols, and Rockwell Kent. These
are inexpensive, but thoroughly
lovely. Designers and illustrators of
note have also come through—the
best of these are Prestopino's baby
angels in red flannel underwear.
New to the Yule card market are
; reproductions of American sculp
tural works by Manship, Warneke,
and Robert Laurent. These men are
also members of the American Art
ists Group.
Always good and more personal

than any of the others are sheets of
notepaper in Wedgewood blue with
a white-and-cerise scroll down the
center. You write your own message
on these.
FOR THE ARMY
For the men in the armed foi'ces,
one designer, who feels that the boys
might not appreciate scenes of fire
side warmth and gaiety, has gotten
out a series depicting a very quaint
army life.
In the "for gosh sakes" department
are toy balloons which when blown
up reveal cherubs on sleds, snow
men, and your name at the bottom.
At the usual shops it takes 15 days
for the name to be painted on—or
whatever they do to put it there.
If you love your movie stars with
a great and enduring love it is
possible—at certain shops—to pur
chase duplicates of the cards which
Mr. Power, or Miss Lamarr, or Mr.
Karloff, among others, sent out last
year.

mas spirit will do its best to take the nation's heart again this season, ac
cording to the shop-keepers.
And, since the majority of us have more friends and relatives than we

have cash for presents, the Christmas,
card appropriation shall take its usual
place among the Yule budget items.
Perhaps because of the grim un
dertone in the season's joyousness,
the majority of the "belly-laugh"
variety of cards have been elimi
nated from the showcases and sam
ple books. Likewise, the chauvinis
tic flag-wavers of last December
have retired to decent obscurity.
ANGELS IN RED FLANNEL
From the American Artists Group
come the superb cards designed by
such men as Adolph Dehn, Dale
Nichols, and Rockwell Kent. These
are inexpensive, but thoroughly
lovely. Designers and illustrators of
note have also come through—the
best of these are Prestopino's baby
angels in red flannel underwear.
New to the Yule card market are
; reproductions of American sculp
tural works by Manship, Warneke,
and Robert Laurent. These men are
also members of the American Art
ists Group.
Always good and more personal

than any of the others are sheets of
notepaper in Wedgewood blue with
a white-and-cerise scroll down the
center. You write your own message
on these.
FOR THE ARMY
For the men in the armed foi'ces,
one designer, who feels that the boys
might not appreciate scenes of fire
side warmth and gaiety, has gotten
out a series depicting a very quaint
army life.
In the "for gosh sakes" department
are toy balloons which when blown
up reveal cherubs on sleds, snow
men, and your name at the bottom.
At the usual shops it takes 15 days
for the name to be painted on—or
whatever they do to put it there.
If you love your movie stars with
a great and enduring love it is
possible—at certain shops—to pur
chase duplicates of the cards which
Mr. Power, or Miss Lamarr, or Mr.
Karloff, among others, sent out last
year.
Though "Peace on Earth and Good VV'iil to Men'* are, in the larger
sense, hollow sentiments for this year's Christinas season, the gentle Christ
mas spirit will do its best to take the nation's heart again this season, ac
cording to the shop-keepers.
