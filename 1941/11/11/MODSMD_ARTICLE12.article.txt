##

The 1941 Sophomore Cotillion is
almost a. sell-out, said Hy Hebert,
dance ticket chairman, in reporting
on yesterday's ticket sales. Just ten
bids remain for the affair and these
should be sold early this morning, he
added.
"For those who come too late to
get tickets, a waiting list will be filled
out for any returned tickets," con
tinued Hebert. "But we can't
promise tickets to those on the list."
The formal dance, featuring the
music of Duke Ellington's orchestra,
one of the top dance outfits in the
nation, will be held in the Pavilion
November 14, the night, before the
Washington State-Stanford football
game.
