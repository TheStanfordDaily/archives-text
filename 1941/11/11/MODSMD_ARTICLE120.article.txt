# Perilous Adventure Dogs Footsteps Of Average Coed at Football Game
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Viewed from every angle, the I
Stanford woman's attendance at each
Saturday's football game is an ex
perience fraught with peril and sav
oring of high adventure. Exhaustive
research on this subject, conducted
during four seasons—two black and
two much brighter—has led to "the
following series of conclusions and
suggestions concerning the equip
ment and program to be followed by
the normal or game-going coed.
Each problem, its ramifications, and
possible solutions will be discussed
in turn.
THE POMPON
Analysis: This is a red-and-whitc,
crepe paper object attached to a
small pole and resembling nothing
so much as an embarrassed head of
lettuce. (On sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice, 25 cents each.) Ostensibly, the
pompon is to be used as a visual
expression of mass ecstasy during
exciting moments; or as a demonstra
tion of innate rhythm in the coed
soul.
Hidden Meanings: In reality, the
innocuous-looking pompon is a ma
levolent, evil thing. It is quite pos
sible that Adolf Hitler, because of
ignorance of the pompon's value as
an offensive weapon, will never es
tablish his New Order.
The danger of the pompon lies in
the way it strikes at civilian morale.
Women keep the home fires burn
ing, and comfort the fighting man in
times of stress. But she, who has
been beaten about the head for two
and a half hours every Saturday,
nine weeks out of the year is a
dazed and befuddled thing, com
pletely unequipped to act as a builder
of any sort of morale at all.
In the rain, the pompon reveals
even more delightful traits. Pom
pons rejoice in rain. They drink in
the little droplets and dye the whole
world red in sheer exuberance. One
patriotic woman has written William
Knudsen protesting the "criminal"
waste of dye.
Conclusion: It is obvious that
Mickey Levee and Pi Thornton are
inadvertantly constituting themselves
a menace to national defense and the
whole emergency set-up.
FOOD AND DRINK
Analysis: These consist of hot
dogs, ice cream bars, and cokes
which are hawked about the stadium
by raucous urchins who obviously
regard every student as a dupe and
pawn. Since the Stanford Woman,
on the average, consumes two hot
dogs, three cokes, and one ice cream
bar at each game (she needs fuel to
keep the fix - es of the spirit burning),
the candy butchers are a fairly nec
essary evil.
Ramifications: Each Saturday,
there is one woman sitting at the
end of each row who does not see

the game. For her the afternoon re
solves itself into the realms of high
er mathematics. The 22 men on the
field, the cheers of the victors, and
the screams of the wounded, merely
act as incidental music to the greater
drama of sustenance and cold hard
cash. She receives out-going money,
catches the salesman's roving eye,
transacts complicated deals, and di
rects inbound edible traffic.
Conclusion: The job calls for an
executive of the highest order, and
the Bus School has been asked to
establish a course specifically de
signed to train the more intelligent
women for this purpose. It is up to
the B.A.C. to supply the mechanical
details such as: those little change
making gadgets street-car conduc
tors wear on their stomachs; add
machines for computing expendi
tures; a small cash register; and a
typewriter for listing items desired.
VICTORY FEATHERS
Analysis: The victory feather is
red, and is derived from a chicken,
who probably misses it something
awful. This is a fairly new develop
ment, and any Junior or Senior
woman can remember the days when
she had never heard of them. They
signify a winning team; joi de vivre
in general; and a hairdresser's head
ache.
Ramifications: By careful count,
exactly 32 bobby pins and three be
rets are required to keep a victory
feather in place on a clear and draft
less day. Normally, the weather be
ing what it is, these are not enough.
Here again the pompon appears. The
one (pompon) quite effectively can
cels out the other (feather). In the
rain, the feather droops disconso-
J lately, and the section acquires an
inadvertant henna rinse. However,
the high wind, which sweeps down
over the press box and into the girls'
section is a gay and frolicsome influ
j ence which adds a great deal to the
i general picture. It also robs many
a spirited rooter of her red badge of
courage.
Conclusion: Chewing gum at the
base of the plume, and applied to
the hair at whatever point one finds
the feather most becoming, will do
the trick very effectively. There is
no need to use fresh gum every Sat
urday. It will not fall out. When the
' season is over a pair of scissors will
; remove the substance. A weekly
clipping would eventually lead to
complications in the form of no hair.
SMALL BOYS
Analysis: These moppets appear,
! apparently from nowhere, immedi
ately after the game. They frequent
the field itself and the parking lots
around the stadium. Though they
differ in comparative smallness, col
or, and freckles per square inch,
they are one in their basic desire:
1 that is, they yearn — inexpressibly

and deeply for a pompon and/or a
victory feather. They will stop at
nothing to make these desires fact.
Ramifications: If the child is afoot,
the problem is a fairly simple one,
since the average Stanford Woman is
larger than the average small boy.
The only thing is that a Deke-like
clutch must be maintained on both
pompon and feather. Once t"he brat
has acquired his beloved object,
the problem becomes more difficult.
They run like stags.
If a bicycle is involved there is
little hope. A twelve-year-old lad
on a bicycle resembles the centaurs
of old—only mechanized.
Conclusion: All boys should be
born at the age of 14.

ignorance of the pompon's value as
an offensive weapon, will never es
tablish his New Order.
The danger of the pompon lies in
the way it strikes at civilian morale.
Women keep the home fires burn
ing, and comfort the fighting man in
times of stress. But she, who has
been beaten about the head for two
and a half hours every Saturday,
nine weeks out of the year is a
dazed and befuddled thing, com
pletely unequipped to act as a builder
of any sort of morale at all.
In the rain, the pompon reveals
even more delightful traits. Pom
pons rejoice in rain. They drink in
the little droplets and dye the whole
world red in sheer exuberance. One
patriotic woman has written William
Knudsen protesting the "criminal"
waste of dye.
Conclusion: It is obvious that
Mickey Levee and Pi Thornton are
inadvertantly constituting themselves
a menace to national defense and the
whole emergency set-up.
FOOD AND DRINK
Analysis: These consist of hot
dogs, ice cream bars, and cokes
which are hawked about the stadium
by raucous urchins who obviously
regard every student as a dupe and
pawn. Since the Stanford Woman,
on the average, consumes two hot
dogs, three cokes, and one ice cream
bar at each game (she needs fuel to
keep the fix - es of the spirit burning),
the candy butchers are a fairly nec
essary evil.
Ramifications: Each Saturday,
there is one woman sitting at the
end of each row who does not see

the game. For her the afternoon re
solves itself into the realms of high
er mathematics. The 22 men on the
field, the cheers of the victors, and
the screams of the wounded, merely
act as incidental music to the greater
drama of sustenance and cold hard
cash. She receives out-going money,
catches the salesman's roving eye,
transacts complicated deals, and di
rects inbound edible traffic.
Conclusion: The job calls for an
executive of the highest order, and
the Bus School has been asked to
establish a course specifically de
signed to train the more intelligent
women for this purpose. It is up to
the B.A.C. to supply the mechanical
details such as: those little change
making gadgets street-car conduc
tors wear on their stomachs; add
machines for computing expendi
tures; a small cash register; and a
typewriter for listing items desired.
VICTORY FEATHERS
Analysis: The victory feather is
red, and is derived from a chicken,
who probably misses it something
awful. This is a fairly new develop
ment, and any Junior or Senior
woman can remember the days when
she had never heard of them. They
signify a winning team; joi de vivre
in general; and a hairdresser's head
ache.
Ramifications: By careful count,
exactly 32 bobby pins and three be
rets are required to keep a victory
feather in place on a clear and draft
less day. Normally, the weather be
ing what it is, these are not enough.
Here again the pompon appears. The
one (pompon) quite effectively can
cels out the other (feather). In the
rain, the feather droops disconso-
J lately, and the section acquires an
inadvertant henna rinse. However,
the high wind, which sweeps down
over the press box and into the girls'
section is a gay and frolicsome influ
j ence which adds a great deal to the
i general picture. It also robs many
a spirited rooter of her red badge of
courage.
Conclusion: Chewing gum at the
base of the plume, and applied to
the hair at whatever point one finds
the feather most becoming, will do
the trick very effectively. There is
no need to use fresh gum every Sat
urday. It will not fall out. When the
' season is over a pair of scissors will
; remove the substance. A weekly
clipping would eventually lead to
complications in the form of no hair.
SMALL BOYS
Analysis: These moppets appear,
! apparently from nowhere, immedi
ately after the game. They frequent
the field itself and the parking lots
around the stadium. Though they
differ in comparative smallness, col
or, and freckles per square inch,
they are one in their basic desire:
1 that is, they yearn — inexpressibly

and deeply for a pompon and/or a
victory feather. They will stop at
nothing to make these desires fact.
Ramifications: If the child is afoot,
the problem is a fairly simple one,
since the average Stanford Woman is
larger than the average small boy.
The only thing is that a Deke-like
clutch must be maintained on both
pompon and feather. Once t"he brat
has acquired his beloved object,
the problem becomes more difficult.
They run like stags.
If a bicycle is involved there is
little hope. A twelve-year-old lad
on a bicycle resembles the centaurs
of old—only mechanized.
Conclusion: All boys should be
born at the age of 14.
Viewed from every angle, the I
Stanford woman's attendance at each
Saturday's football game is an ex
perience fraught with peril and sav
oring of high adventure. Exhaustive
research on this subject, conducted
during four seasons—two black and
two much brighter—has led to "the
following series of conclusions and
suggestions concerning the equip
ment and program to be followed by
the normal or game-going coed.
Each problem, its ramifications, and
possible solutions will be discussed
in turn.
THE POMPON
Analysis: This is a red-and-whitc,
crepe paper object attached to a
small pole and resembling nothing
so much as an embarrassed head of
lettuce. (On sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice, 25 cents each.) Ostensibly, the
pompon is to be used as a visual
expression of mass ecstasy during
exciting moments; or as a demonstra
tion of innate rhythm in the coed
soul.
Hidden Meanings: In reality, the
innocuous-looking pompon is a ma
levolent, evil thing. It is quite pos
sible that Adolf Hitler, because of
ignorance of the pompon's value as
an offensive weapon, will never es
tablish his New Order.
The danger of the pompon lies in

pawn. Since the Stanford Woman,
on the average, consumes two hot
dogs, three cokes, and one ice cream
bar at each game (she needs fuel to
keep the fix - es of the spirit burning),
the candy butchers are a fairly nec
essary evil.
Ramifications: Each Saturday,
there is one woman sitting at the
end of each row who does not see

the game. For her the afternoon re
solves itself into the realms of high
er mathematics. The 22 men on the
field, the cheers of the victors, and
the screams of the wounded, merely
act as incidental music to the greater
drama of sustenance and cold hard
cash. She receives out-going money,
catches the salesman's roving eye,
transacts complicated deals, and di
rects inbound edible traffic.
Conclusion: The job calls for an
executive of the highest order, and
the Bus School has been asked to
establish a course specifically de
signed to train the more intelligent
women for this purpose. It is up to
the B.A.C. to supply the mechanical
details such as: those little change
making gadgets street-car conduc
tors wear on their stomachs; add
machines for computing expendi
tures; a small cash register; and a
typewriter for listing items desired.
VICTORY FEATHERS
Analysis: The victory feather is
red, and is derived from a chicken,
who probably misses it something
awful. This is a fairly new develop
ment, and any Junior or Senior
woman can remember the days when
she had never heard of them. They
signify a winning team; joi de vivre
in general; and a hairdresser's head
ache.
Ramifications: By careful count,
exactly 32 bobby pins and three be
rets are required to keep a victory
feather in place on a clear and draft
less day. Normally, the weather be
ing what it is, these are not enough.
Here again the pompon appears. The
one (pompon) quite effectively can
cels out the other (feather). In the
rain, the feather droops disconso-
J lately, and the section acquires an
inadvertant henna rinse. However,
the high wind, which sweeps down
over the press box and into the girls'
section is a gay and frolicsome influ
j ence which adds a great deal to the
i general picture. It also robs many
a spirited rooter of her red badge of
courage.
Conclusion: Chewing gum at the
base of the plume, and applied to
the hair at whatever point one finds
the feather most becoming, will do
the trick very effectively. There is
no need to use fresh gum every Sat
urday. It will not fall out. When the
' season is over a pair of scissors will
; remove the substance. A weekly
clipping would eventually lead to
complications in the form of no hair.
SMALL BOYS
Analysis: These moppets appear,
! apparently from nowhere, immedi
ately after the game. They frequent
the field itself and the parking lots
around the stadium. Though they
differ in comparative smallness, col
or, and freckles per square inch,
they are one in their basic desire:
1 that is, they yearn — inexpressibly

and deeply for a pompon and/or a
victory feather. They will stop at
nothing to make these desires fact.
Ramifications: If the child is afoot,
the problem is a fairly simple one,
since the average Stanford Woman is
larger than the average small boy.
The only thing is that a Deke-like
clutch must be maintained on both
pompon and feather. Once t"he brat
has acquired his beloved object,
the problem becomes more difficult.
They run like stags.
If a bicycle is involved there is
little hope. A twelve-year-old lad
on a bicycle resembles the centaurs
of old—only mechanized.
Conclusion: All boys should be
born at the age of 14.
Viewed from every angle, the I
Stanford woman's attendance at each
Saturday's football game is an ex
perience fraught with peril and sav
oring of high adventure. Exhaustive
research on this subject, conducted
during four seasons—two black and
two much brighter—has led to "the
following series of conclusions and
suggestions concerning the equip
ment and program to be followed by
the normal or game-going coed.
Each problem, its ramifications, and
possible solutions will be discussed
in turn.
THE POMPON
Analysis: This is a red-and-whitc,
crepe paper object attached to a
small pole and resembling nothing
so much as an embarrassed head of
lettuce. (On sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice, 25 cents each.) Ostensibly, the
pompon is to be used as a visual
expression of mass ecstasy during
exciting moments; or as a demonstra
tion of innate rhythm in the coed
soul.
Hidden Meanings: In reality, the
innocuous-looking pompon is a ma
levolent, evil thing. It is quite pos
sible that Adolf Hitler, because of
ignorance of the pompon's value as
an offensive weapon, will never es
tablish his New Order.
The danger of the pompon lies in
the way it strikes at civilian morale.
Women keep the home fires burn
ing, and comfort the fighting man in
times of stress. But she, who has
been beaten about the head for two
and a half hours every Saturday,
nine weeks out of the year is a
dazed and befuddled thing, com
pletely unequipped to act as a builder
of any sort of morale at all.
In the rain, the pompon reveals
even more delightful traits. Pom
pons rejoice in rain. They drink in
the little droplets and dye the whole
world red in sheer exuberance. One
patriotic woman has written William
Knudsen protesting the "criminal"
waste of dye.
Conclusion: It is obvious that
Mickey Levee and Pi Thornton are
inadvertantly constituting themselves
a menace to national defense and the
whole emergency set-up.

VICTORY FEATHERS
Analysis: The victory feather is
red, and is derived from a chicken,
who probably misses it something
awful. This is a fairly new develop
ment, and any Junior or Senior
woman can remember the days when
she had never heard of them. They
signify a winning team; joi de vivre
in general; and a hairdresser's head
ache.
Ramifications: By careful count,
exactly 32 bobby pins and three be
rets are required to keep a victory
feather in place on a clear and draft
less day. Normally, the weather be
ing what it is, these are not enough.
Here again the pompon appears. The
one (pompon) quite effectively can
cels out the other (feather). In the
rain, the feather droops disconso-
J lately, and the section acquires an
inadvertant henna rinse. However,
the high wind, which sweeps down
over the press box and into the girls'
section is a gay and frolicsome influ
j ence which adds a great deal to the
i general picture. It also robs many
a spirited rooter of her red badge of
courage.
Conclusion: Chewing gum at the
base of the plume, and applied to
the hair at whatever point one finds
the feather most becoming, will do
the trick very effectively. There is
no need to use fresh gum every Sat
urday. It will not fall out. When the
' season is over a pair of scissors will
; remove the substance. A weekly
clipping would eventually lead to
complications in the form of no hair.
SMALL BOYS
Analysis: These moppets appear,
! apparently from nowhere, immedi
ately after the game. They frequent
the field itself and the parking lots
around the stadium. Though they
differ in comparative smallness, col
or, and freckles per square inch,
they are one in their basic desire:
1 that is, they yearn — inexpressibly

and deeply for a pompon and/or a
victory feather. They will stop at
nothing to make these desires fact.
Ramifications: If the child is afoot,
the problem is a fairly simple one,
since the average Stanford Woman is
larger than the average small boy.
The only thing is that a Deke-like
clutch must be maintained on both
pompon and feather. Once t"he brat
has acquired his beloved object,
the problem becomes more difficult.
They run like stags.
If a bicycle is involved there is
little hope. A twelve-year-old lad
on a bicycle resembles the centaurs
of old—only mechanized.
Conclusion: All boys should be
born at the age of 14.
Viewed from every angle, the I
Stanford woman's attendance at each
Saturday's football game is an ex
perience fraught with peril and sav
oring of high adventure. Exhaustive
research on this subject, conducted
during four seasons—two black and
two much brighter—has led to "the
following series of conclusions and
suggestions concerning the equip
ment and program to be followed by
the normal or game-going coed.
Each problem, its ramifications, and
possible solutions will be discussed
in turn.
THE POMPON
Analysis: This is a red-and-whitc,
crepe paper object attached to a
small pole and resembling nothing
so much as an embarrassed head of
lettuce. (On sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice, 25 cents each.) Ostensibly, the
pompon is to be used as a visual
expression of mass ecstasy during
exciting moments; or as a demonstra
tion of innate rhythm in the coed
soul.
Hidden Meanings: In reality, the
innocuous-looking pompon is a ma
levolent, evil thing. It is quite pos
sible that Adolf Hitler, because of
ignorance of the pompon's value as
an offensive weapon, will never es
tablish his New Order.
The danger of the pompon lies in
the way it strikes at civilian morale.
Women keep the home fires burn
ing, and comfort the fighting man in
times of stress. But she, who has
been beaten about the head for two
and a half hours every Saturday,
nine weeks out of the year is a
dazed and befuddled thing, com
pletely unequipped to act as a builder
of any sort of morale at all.
In the rain, the pompon reveals
even more delightful traits. Pom
pons rejoice in rain. They drink in
the little droplets and dye the whole
world red in sheer exuberance. One
patriotic woman has written William
Knudsen protesting the "criminal"
waste of dye.
Conclusion: It is obvious that
Mickey Levee and Pi Thornton are
inadvertantly constituting themselves
a menace to national defense and the
whole emergency set-up.
FOOD AND DRINK
Analysis: These consist of hot
dogs, ice cream bars, and cokes
which are hawked about the stadium
by raucous urchins who obviously
regard every student as a dupe and
pawn. Since the Stanford Woman,
on the average, consumes two hot
dogs, three cokes, and one ice cream
bar at each game (she needs fuel to
keep the fix - es of the spirit burning),
the candy butchers are a fairly nec
essary evil.
Ramifications: Each Saturday,
there is one woman sitting at the
end of each row who does not see

the game. For her the afternoon re
solves itself into the realms of high
er mathematics. The 22 men on the
field, the cheers of the victors, and
the screams of the wounded, merely
act as incidental music to the greater
drama of sustenance and cold hard
cash. She receives out-going money,
catches the salesman's roving eye,
transacts complicated deals, and di
rects inbound edible traffic.
Conclusion: The job calls for an
executive of the highest order, and
the Bus School has been asked to
establish a course specifically de
signed to train the more intelligent
women for this purpose. It is up to
the B.A.C. to supply the mechanical
details such as: those little change
making gadgets street-car conduc
tors wear on their stomachs; add
machines for computing expendi
tures; a small cash register; and a
typewriter for listing items desired.
