# New Hair Gadgets Will Catch the Eye
## 
### 
Come the dusk, few heads appear
in dance spots or dining rooms with
out some bit of adornment. Some
are covered altogether in what is,
literally, a headdressâ€”yards of this
or that flung over the tresses.
Less dramatic, but also less de
manding on the features, are the
new, sweet little swirls of horsehair.
In their centers pearls quiver from
the tips of gilt spirals, catching ev
ery highlight and eye. White for
brunettes, black for blondes, and the
sleeker the hairflx, the slicker one
of these can look. Wear yours right
over an ear. Or wear one over each,
if you like balance.
