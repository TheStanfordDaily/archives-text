# Skirts Hit New Low For Cocktail Wear
## 
### 
Skirts are on the rampage again.
Before long the fashion experts will
be plugging the "new low." During
the cocktail hour "the smart" will
have a hemline midway between the
calf and ankle. It's ideal to start out
the late afternoon with and then to
continue on through an "unpredict
able" evening.
There is a hint in the air that
"up-in-the-front-down-in-the-back" j
skirts will be ushered in this spring.
They will also be standbys for din
ner-and-dancing evenings when for
mals are not in order.
