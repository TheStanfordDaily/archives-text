# American Designers Take Note Of British Auxiliary Uniforms
## 
### 
The major part of fashions in Eng- i
land today is determined by dic
tates of women's auxiliary defense
forces. Fluffs and furbelows must
be saved for occasional nightclub
wear because day clothes have to
give service.
Because American women may
have to face total civilian defense in
the near future, fashion designers
are taking note of female uniforms
in England.
The ATA, auxiliary unit to the
army, wears a uniform of complete
khaki in a drab olive shade. Black
ties and official insignia are the only
decorations. Topping these uni
forms are overseas caps.
The WRENS, the Royal Navy
auxiliary, have the ljest looking uni
forms. They are a plain navy blue
with gold buttons and braid and are
worn with navy blue tri-corn hats.
Most popular women of the Eng
lish auxiliary units are tlic members
of the WAAF, air force auxiliary.
They wear bobbed hair so that hair

I will not soil their white shirts or get
! in their way while they are working
| on airplane engines.
Worst looking uniforms are those
l adopted by the farm auxiliary serv
ice. They wear heavy, thick, ribbed
green sweaters with turtle necks.
These useful women drive tractors,
reap wheat and other harvests. Over
their warm sweaters, they wear
khaki overalls.
All uniforms are made by military
tailors. Each unit is requirtd to
wear black lisle stockings and black
neckties. Men's shirts are worn be
neath the uniforms so that jackets
can be put aside and shirt sleeves
rolled up when work becomes de
manding.
The WRENS are generally used
as clerical workers for the navy.
They also keep up the buildings by
actual manual labor such as wash
ing floors. They do minor official
duties ashore for the more specialized
branches of the navy.
The WAAF handles telephone and
| communications for the air force.
