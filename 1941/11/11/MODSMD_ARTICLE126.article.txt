# War Conditions, Defense Needs Cut Off Cosmetics Ingredients
## 
### MARTHAGRACE POWELL 
Use of face powder in defense may seem far fetched, but tlie cosmetic
and perfume industry lias been one of the hardest hit by war and defense
production.
War blockades have cut off imports of essential oils and other ingredi
ents. Supplies of some of the industry's most important domestically pro-

duced materials are being swallowed,
up by defenseâ€”zinc oxide necessary
to powder, rouge, and creams, alumi
num chloride, and brass for lipstick
cases.
The silk shortage, although painful
to most women, seems destined to
l,e one of the big breaks for the cot
ton industry. This fact is rather a
repetition of the last World War
when cotton use sky-rocketed to its
present position.
Cotton Stockings Coming
Experiments in sheer cotton hos
iery are proving most effective. The
French before the war had produced
quite a flatteringly sheer hose; the
American manufacturers have taken
it up from there.
Contrasting this war with the last,
it is interesting to note, that women
Ihen gave up silk hose not because
of lack of silk but rather the lack of
German dyes. Too often a sheer pair
of black hose turned green after
washing.
No Zippers
No loss will be felt quite so defi
nitely as ihe loss of the hair pin or
the time saving zipper. The priority
pinch on nickel has proved so severe
in the zipper industry, that unless
a substitute can be found, the zipper
will be but a happy memory.*
This saving-for-defense spirit has
even touched the new fashion tenter,
New York. This year's styles, by
featuring short tight skirts, omy oc
casionally disguised by a miifpr bit
of fullness, are saving yardafee for
defense. J
Cleaning Business Hit
The "keep-yourself-neat-by-send
ing-your-suits-to-the-cleaners - ev
(ry-sixth-wearing" campaign might
be doomed. Business experts have
predicted a widespread shutdown of
dry cleaning plants. The shut, down

will affect some 5,000 cleaners using
(he synthetic cleaning fluid which
has chlorine as its main component.
Sacrifices made by women during
(he last war were mostly confined to
culinary arts. Meats, wheat, com
and sugar were at a premium.
This time, the government seems
determined to save us from suffering
(he shortage of necessities by sacri
ficing the frills to defense.
