# Grandma's Hankie Takes Evening Spot
## 
### 
Although it may have been for
gotten, handkerchiefs can vary and
have style changes just as the other
wardrobe accoutrements. The Vic
torian "dinner handkerchief" is be
ing revived, all fifteen inches of it.
There is still the "floating" hankie
of gossamer chiffon for evening wear,
j Amid all that, the dainty ladylike
handkerchiefs with small, prim mon
ograms hold their own and white is
still the preferable color.
