# Boy Scouts Like Farm Women, Paulette Goddard, Card Team, Cal Roofers

### AL HAMPSON 
Although Boy Scouts wear short pants, they are human, and are af
fected by the charm—or lack of it—in the Stanford woman.
In a quest designed to satisfy the demand for some new opinions on
the Stanford Woman, we interviewed one of the '1,000 Boy Scouts who
stayed here over the wet Santa Clara footliall game weekend.

Bob Sherburn, Boy Saout, First
Class, of Sulinas, had very definite ■
opinions about Stanford's chosen |
1,000.
"They're swell," he said, "that is, i
through binoculars." He added that j
he did not mean that the girls lost j
their charm upon close inspection,
but that he had had no opportunity i
for a closer inspection.
When he learned that some 1,000
Stanford men were in the same boat,
he became, in some measure, con
soled.
COULDN'T DISTINGUISH
Boy Scout Sherburn also had defi
nite views about the attire of Stan
ford women. First, he wanted to j
know how on earth anyone could
tell them apart since they were all
dressed identically — rubber boots,
reversible rain-coats, and bandanas
on their heads.
"Those rubber boots," he com
mented reflectively. "I don't like
them .... all their legs look like
the right guard's."
I supplied the name of Loren La
Prade. He thanked me.
Claiming that he knew nothing of i
the male-style cashmere sweater on j
Stanford females, he remarked that i
spectator pumps—these also had to j
be identified—\frere very nice indeed. |
WEDGIES? WELL—
"Makes their legs look thin, yet j
shapely," he said.
He also liked moccasins, which he j
saw in the sea of mud after the game, '
but was undecided about the qualifi- i
cations of semi-wedgies which were
also very evident. He thought the
wedgies looked "unsafe."
Upon the silk-stocking question— |
which stares every Stanford right
in the face when she steps onto the
Quad —he had definite views. Bobby
sox? He would have none of them,
even for the sake of national defense.
Silk stockings were the only thing.
"Legs are bad enough looking on
most girls as it is,"' he said dogmati
cally. "Why make it worse?"
Scout Sherburn liked the typical
Stanford hair-do with the little roll
in front. Page boys left him 'strange
ly cold." Firmly, he vetoed colored
glasses frames, but okeyed "those
harlequin things."
ALL OR NONE
On the subject of lipstick and nail
polish, he divided his opinions. He
thought that lipstick, in general was
a good thing, but was strangely reti
cent concerning the purple kind.
With the Salinas Scout it was ox
blood nailpolish or none at all. "None
of these halfway measures."
He was unconditionally against
toe-nail polish, although none was
visible that wet, grey day.
On more general subjects he liked:
1. The Stanford football team,
; which he thinks is destined for the
Rose Bowl. (Thinks pompons are
! instrumental in the team's victories.)
2. Brunettes. (His favorite movie
star is Paulette Goddard.)
3. The cordial way in which the
rooting section received the referee.
Strongly recommended, Boy Scout
j that he was, the much-commented
upon Cal policy.
