## Main Floor, Balcony Completely Sold Out 
### 
Although the main floor and bal
cony of Memorial Hall were sold out
lÂ«or the Paul Robeson concert Dec. 1
weeks ago, there are still a few seats
left on the stage, according to Con
cert Series Manager Helen Peter
son. Tickets for these are $2.20
apiece.
There are also a few season tick
ets left, according to Miss Peterson,
selling at $4.55, $3.45 and $2.35 each.
These tickets give the buyer the
same seat or seats for this year's four
concerts, which are: Dec. 1, Paul
Robeson; Jan. 21, Cornelia Otis Skin
ner; Feb. 16, Jose Iturbi; and April
21, Helen Traubel.
Those students who have bought
season tickets will be able to pick
them up at the Concert Series office
beginning next week, Miss Peterson
announced yesterday. Because of a
mistake in levying the new amuse
ment taxes, students who bought
their tickets after Oct. 1 will have to
pay 15 cents extra when they pick up
their tickets.
According to Miss Peterson, the 10
per cent levy called for in tax bill
which became effective Oct. 1 was
made by the Concert Series office on
the special pxice offered to students,
while later investigation revealed
that the government would not rec
ognize the special price, making it
necessary to figure the tax accord
ing to the price of the general public
tickets.
