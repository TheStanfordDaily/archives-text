# Evening Sweater Vogue Continues
## 
### 
Those who knit will be glad to
know that sweaters are the thing,
not only around campus, but for
dressy afternoons and evenings.
There's one in Boucle shot with sil
ver for cocktail wear.
For sports, knit one in waistcoat
style with checks and wear it with
slacks or under a suit.
For evening, there's a long sleeved
number with ribbed sleeves and a
draped neckline. Have it in a vivid
color and wear it over a black skirt.

Velvet is being used extensively
this fall for gloves, purses and trim.
