# Brilliant Hues Will Brighten Campus Haunts
## 
### 
Color will brighten the Quad this I
quarter. Clear, bright primaries, '
yellows and blues and the beloved
reds, garish, screaming plaids topped j
by brilliant sweaters or long-sleeved
blouses, almost any color as long as |
it's vivid, will trot up the post-office I
steps.
At least one red dress is almost a |
necessity. Particularly popular are |
soft wool dirndls for not-too-dressy
dates. Also widely used are gay red
waistcoats, especially over a combi
nation such as a beige shirt and skirt.
Yellow has been plugged by fash
ion mags as the news of the fall. Try
yellow with purple or deep blue for
classes, yellow with beige, or start
ling yellow with black for formal
wear. Only remember, it's hard to
wear and find the shade that suits
you.
All Blues Good
Widely seen 011 campus are powder
and other soft blues, probably be
cause a'majority of men voted blue
their favorite color in a recent sur
vey. Worn with matching plaids or
the luscious cherry-red, it is easy
enough to see why they did. Bright
blues, although they are not common
in sweaters and skirts, are much
used for classroom and date dresses.
Bright green is gathering more fol
lowers all the time. It is excellent
with navy for winter dash, and is
fashion news when worn with black
for evening. In a slightly more sub
dued shade, green is also a smart
buy for a topcoat because it blends
well with most colors.
Rain Clothes Noisy
Reversibles get plaidier and pret
tier each year. The latest crop is
particularly noisy, both plaids and
solid colors apparently striving to
keep rainy days cheerful. Of course
red and white, or shiny black or
brown boots, and brilliant peasant
or flowered scarfs are worn with
them.
Argyle plaids and Tattersall checks
are pick-me-ups for any wardrobe,
the Argyle used in sweaters, the
checks for waistcoats, shirts, and
jackets.
The same, brilliant colors which
are used solid are combined to form
plaids. Almost any type, from gent
ly subdued browns, wines and blues
to noisier and more startling mix
tures are available. Bright red and
yellow, gently pried apart by beige,
is one good bet; wine, beige and blue
is another, and red, green, and yel
low, orange, brown, and powder blue
are a third and fourth.
Combine Them All
In pairing your sweaters and skirts
try goldenrod and green, turquoise
and white, red and beige, yellow
and purple, wine and green, or a
swirling of any of these colors into
a plaid with one of them emphasized
by a matching blouse or sweater.
Numerous new ideas in color have
been injected into evening dress.
Cherry-red, olive, pale blue and
black, teal blue embroidered in gold,
gleaming yellow, any of these could
change off with the favorite black
and white or silver. And for surprise
let a full-length camel's hair topcoat
in pale pink keep you warm.
