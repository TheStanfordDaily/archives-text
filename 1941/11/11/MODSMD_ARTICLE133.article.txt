# Knitting Habit Hits 1917 Level
## 
### 
It's "knit one and purl two" and
"where is that stitch?" everywhere ,
that women are now.
The ever present Red Cross start- >
ed many of these stitch-droppers on
their way to sweaters by asking
them, and not taking no for an
answer, to knit for the Russians or :
the British, the soldiers or the !
sailors.
And it has been noted that after
painfully knitting the sweater and
loathing its sight for three months,
when tht' time comes to actually give
the sweater to the Red Cross, the ,
knitter develops an unsuspected
fondness for the article, and hates to
give it up.
So, the embryo knitter goes down
to the nearest yarn shop and, after j
yearning over all of the invariably
luscious yarns in stock, finally pur
chases eight or nine balls, which,
after another two months, is worn
in the shape of a sweater with a
"a-poor-thing-but-mine-own" look.
After the second sweater almost
anyone is likely to benefit from the
acquired urge to knit and knit and
knit. The "man" of the moment is
often the next victim, but perhaps
not so much of a victim either for
three sweaters are very educational.
And then there are many other
things which can be knitted, in
cluding: mittens, in two colors for
the very experienced or very brave;
and socks, but beware of the heels.
Knitting, at present, is patriotic
and some of the more confirmed
addicts are even thinking of asking
Miss Yost for permission to knit at
lectures so the Russians and the
British and the soldiers and the
sailors won't be cold this winter be
cause of the lack of a sweater.
