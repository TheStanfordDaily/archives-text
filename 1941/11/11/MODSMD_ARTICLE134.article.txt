# MINXY MITTENS
## 
### 
"Minxy mittens" are the thing for
reaching eight o'clocks with fingers
fit for taking notes. Especially the
handmade ones, just out, design
knitted of sturdy Norwegian wool
yarn. Navy blue and white is the
color combination to contrast with
the red skirts of football season, and
to look pretty against the snow dur-
I ing the winter quarter skiing season.
