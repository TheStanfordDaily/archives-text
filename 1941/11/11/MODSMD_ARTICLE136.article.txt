# 'Big' Men Gag, Cry for Help, In Perfume Survey
## Ten Famous Brands Get 'Smell' Tests From Farm Greats 
### MARTHA DEANE 
Excom sniffed one night last week
when ten world-famous perfumes
went through the acid test—a "smell
poll" taken of ten prominent men
about campus.
Said Bud Ames, Daily Managing
Editor, about Elizabeth Arden's best
seller, "Blue Grass," "My dear
mother went blind on this stuff."
Larry Freer, graduate man, thinks
Shalimar," by Bourgeois, is "worse
•than dheap gin." And A.S.S.U.
President George Jackson polished
off the universal favorite, "Chanel
No. 5" with, "It stinks."
THEY SAID PLENTY
Such comments, wafted on the
aromas of what many a Stanford
belle fondly hopes will please "the
stronger sex," filled the air within a
two-mile radius. It would behoove
perfume manufacturers to cast an
eye toward the potent, if slightly
"different," opinions of the Stanford
man.
Topping the list was Dana's "Tabu"
with .six votes in its favor. Tiff Den
ton, member-at-large, termed it
"Medicine, but good medicine." Stan
Owen, Men's Council chairman,
branded it "Harem Special," and Bob
Hopper, sophomore man, went ov
erboard with "Me for that!"
EItEER ON "TABIT"
On the con side Larry Freer's
"Pungent, penetrating, but lousy"
and George Jackson's "My God, too
powerful!" were tabulated.
Tied for second place were Le
long's "Mon Image" and Guerlain's
"Shalimar." As for "Mon Image,"
Stan Owen said, "Why struggle?"
and George Jackson, "Tremendous!"
while Bob Hopper named it "Ghast
ly.' It was "much too strong" for
Tiff Denton.
"Shalimar," the exotic, "sent" Stan
Owen, and drew a long shuddering

"Ahhhh" from Bob Hopper. How
ever, Ralph Clark, senior man,
thought it "could make a good drink"
and to Bud Ames it was "like stale
cinainmon rolls at our fraternity."
BEWITCHING SHOWS
"Bewitching" by Dunhill came in
for a weak third spot. "Fair," said
student Manager Jim McKellar "And
how," exclaimed Bob Hopper, but
Stan Owen said. "Over-ripe" and
Tiff Denton passed it on with "like
men's shaving lotion."
It was about this point that Isabel
Fawcett and Nancy Burkett became
playful and went about the sacred
sanctum of the Ex Committee room
applying liberal doses. Plaintive
male shrieks for mercy rent the aro
matic air. But they soon changed
to "Jeez, smell the back of my shirt;
I can wear it for another week!"
The remaining perfumes that went
on trial before the discriminating

jury gathered around the Excom
table were Faberg's "Tigress," Cor
day's "Orchidee Bleu," Lelong's
"'Opening Night." "Chanel No. 5,"
"Kobako" by Bourgeois, and "Blue
Grass" by Elizabeth Arden. If pos
sible, these big names fared worse
than the others.
McKELLAR EXPOUNDS
Frank Van Acker, graduate man,
thought "Chanel No. 5" was "like a
shampoo." It had no smell as far as
Larry Freer was concerned but Till
Denton breathed, "Exotic" and Jim
McKellar said, "Excellent, any Stan
ford girl could get any man with
this."
"Kobako" went down to ignomin
ious defeat with "Bourbon, but bad
Bourbon," and "even worse than the
name." Said George Jackson, "Too
strong, it drives me away." Bud
Ames grimaced, "Kansas City on a
hot night."

"Orchidee Bleu" was a "weak gin
drink," "insipid," and "Undoubtedly
effective."
"Tigress" climbed up the ladder to
success with Tiff Denton's "Excel
lent" and Bud Ames' "That's Nancy
Burkett' and then slid right down
again with Frank Van Acker's "Shoe
polish," Larry Freer's "Terrible," and
Ralph Clark's "It doesn't live up to
it's name and I don't believe it."
AWAY WITII IT
When the gamut was run, ten very
"big" men slunk sheepishly down
the stairs to the Cellar feeling, oh, so
small, and smelling—oh, how they
smelled! A parting shot from George
Jackson wafted through the halls,
"I'll smell it for a month!"


PAT ADAMS, student body vice-president and spectator at the Excom perfume survey,
appears concerned over President George Jackson's emphatically negative reaction to the
scent under his nose. President Jackson's her2in-pictured reaction was typical of many ex
pressed at the after-meeting scent survey, as was that of Tiff Denton, right.
