# Purses Enliven Fall Ensembles
## 
### 
Purses add the final touch which
means the difference between a
merely good ensemble and a plu
perfect one. There are purses and
purses and they're all "in" this year.
Use the purse to accent the glitter
on one of those new sequined short
evening dresses. A square bag as
gold as the stuff that comes from the
mint or a shiny patent leather one
to duplicate the sheen from the se
quins would do the trick.
Or match the purse to the hat,
shoes, and belt to tie in the color
scheme dreamed up to renovate the
indispensable, one and only "good
black dress."
Don't despair of all those beloved
but ancient bags that have seen such
"important" occasions. Dress them
up by sticking a pin, gold, silver or
what have you, that is one of those
utterly "good* things, casually on
the front and contemplate the added
verve.
Those big floppy envelopes that all
and sundry have been carrying for
informal service seem too useful to
disappear. The ones with plaid lin
ings and spaces for cigarettes,
matches, lipstick, and pad and pencil
are the answer to every coed's
prayer for the eight o'clock dash.
These are also good for long-dis
tance sports events for they carry
all the paraphernalia for P.D.Q. re
pairs. Block felt monograms will
dress them up for the occasion.
