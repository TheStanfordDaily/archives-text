If the current craze for mono- ]
clothing continues, the j
3awlout, Quad, and Frosh Pictorial
will become obsolete us means of |
identifying fascinating female fresh
men. Where initials formerly piqued
the curiosity, monograms now give
everything but a home address.
f'are indeed is the girl whose out
fit does not have a clue to her iden
tity embroidered on it someplace, so
just keep looking, men. Ankle sox
are a popular spot for monograms,
and any girls with two legs can offer
a double feature with her name on
one, her telephone number on the
other.
One-piece dresses offer a variety
of locations for embroidered infor
mation; it can go on the collar, on
the pocket, on the cuff, or running
down the sleeve.
Original home of the monogram is
(he sweater, and it remains a favor
ite with collegiennes. Many continue
to place their initials or names near
the neck, but a modern innovation
is the placing of a nick-name diag
onally down one side.
Despite its popularity, the practice
of monogramming creates at least
one problem, that of selecting a color
that will not limit the use of the
article upon which it is put. That is,
a shirt with a red monogram can
hardly be worn happily with a wine
skirt.
Except for this difficulty, the mon
ogram seems to be here to stay as
long as college girls don't want to i
conceal their identities.
And they don't.
