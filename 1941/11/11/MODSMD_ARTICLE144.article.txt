# Odd Lapel Gadgets Command Attention
## 
### 
Costume jewelry is, in these days,
farther fetched than ever before,
Wear it big and wear it brazen is
the fashion edict. There's a cute
little donkey with a wide grin and
tremendous ears to pin on your lapel
or hat to leer at passers-by.
Then there's a huge key with ini
tials on the tnp. It's not meant to
open anything but looks well over
the heart.
A stunning set appeared the other
dayâ€”a beaten silver clip in the
shape of a native's head and a
mighty bracelet to match. Fine to
brighten up last year's dress and to
attract attention.
