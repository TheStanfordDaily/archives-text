# Door-Knockers Don Tweed Suit Lapels
## 
### 
Another lapel gadget with a
knockout idea is the newest minia
ture door-knocker, a copy of those
you see on the doors of private
homes.
The knockers come in antique gold
or silver finish, and your name in
old English print Rives a mellow
touch to tweed suits and wools.
