# Saddles Fast Losing Ground
## 
### 
After being a tradition to college
girls for at least ten years, saddle
shoes arc fast losing ground. First
runner-up are the rope-soled suede
Escadiillos, popularly priced at $3.95.
They are shown in blue, green,
beige, and almost any other color
you want.
Still popular are the mocassins
which are entering their second year
of being "seen on Quad." A recent
survey showed that about 40 per
cent of college women own this type
of shoe. Loafers are "in there, too."
Prices of these two types of shoe
range from $8.95 to copies around
$3.50.
Joyce is putting out a suede win
ter model of her popular spring pala
mino model. These come in all fall
colors and are priced at $5.50.
The brown and white golf shoes
are more and more seen off the
courses. Mexican and domestic huar
aches are not losing ground in pop
ularity, by any means.
But saddle shoes are still being
purchased by the more conservative
co-eds who don't mind cleaning
them.
For rainy weather the traditional
boots, all colors and forms, are still
good. Prices range from $2.00 to
$4.95 and are in great danger of go
ing up because of priorities rulings.
Wooden shoes are making slight
progress, too, in popularity.
In sporty dress shoes, alligator
and lizard are climbers. Suede spec
tator-sport pumps with alligator trim
have lost none of their popularity,
either.

In date, dressy shoes, nail-head
ornamentations seem the most pop
ular. Joyce is making just such a
low, wedge-heeled dress shoe in
black; it is priced at $7.95.
Height of heels for date shoes
ranges from extra-high, French heels
to the "short-man," spool, and wedge
heels.
