# Four Injured Freshman Women Pronounced 'Out of Danger'
## 
### 
Four freshman women who were critically injured last Friday night in
a Ridge Route auto crash in which their classmate, Sall.v Travers, was
killed, have been pronounced "out of clanger, barring complications" by
doctors in attendance, according to information received yesterday by

Sylvia Berry, president of Rohle.
The four, Helen Jones, Betty
Miller, Julie Crommelin, and Joan
Monroe, are at present in the San
Joaquin Hospital in Bakersfield.
Parents of the injured women are
now with them in the valley city.
The exact nature or time of the
accident probably will never be de
termined, since neither Miss Jones,
the driver, nor any of the other sur
vivors can remember striking the
truck-trailer, Miss Berry said. None
of the surviving women regained
consciousness until after they were
in the ambulance, she stated, and at
tending physicians, fearing shock
complications, have not told any of
the four of their classmate's death.
Miss Crommelin may be allowed
to finish the quarter, according to
her physicians. The other three may
lie sufficiently recovered to return
to the University winter quarter.
Services for Sally Louise Travers
were held yesterday afternoon at
1:20 at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather
in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los
Angeles. Flowers were sent, both by
Roble Club and by Pat Adams, rep
resenting the Associated Students of
