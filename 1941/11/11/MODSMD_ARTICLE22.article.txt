# British Will Aid U.S. 'Within Hour' In War With Japan---Churchill
## Defense Board Rejects C.L.O. Goal Demands 
### United Press 
LONDON, Nov. 10 (UP).â€”Prime
Minister Winston Churchill de
clared today that Great Britain
would come to the aid of the United
States "within the hour" in event
of war with Japan.
Britain is now strong enough to
"provide powerful naval forces and
heavy ships" for action in the Pa
cific, Churchill asserted. He also
spoke of the large part of the Ameri
can Navy now in action against the
Axis.

The declaration of the British
prime minister was described in in
formed Japanese quarters today as a
"mere reiteration of previous Brit
ish statements" and presumably part
of a plan to intimidate Nippon, and
"without much meaning."
Informed quarters generally con
sidered the new British declaration
as another move in the current war
of nerves between Tokyo, London
and Washington, in which London
was described as playing largely a
"supporting role."
