# Varsity Begins Drills for Tilt With Cougars
## 
### 
"Okny, Husky, gel your Blacks
and start teaching them Washington
I State stun'."
Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his
! Stanford varsity yesterday started
! practice for the "peak game of the
year," Saturday's battle with the
j Cougars.
In a 15-minute pep talk-chalk
| talk, Shaughnessy warned that
! Washington State, unlike the Tro
jans, is equipped with an explosive
offense and will be the most dan
; gerous opponent Stanford has yet had
to face.
THREE OR FOUR SCORES
He indicated that the Indians
j would have to score three or four
J touchdowns to beat the Cougars and
that off-tackle plays would not do.
! As practice got under way, it looked
j like the Cards would go back to
quick-openers, long-gainers, and
passes. The Reds and Whites ran
through these plays against the
Blues.
Only Will Sheller, who was banged
up a little, is not in top shape.
Shaughnessy indicated that the
1 team would be in its best physical
condition this Saturday and warned
the Indians against getting tired of
football, an attitude that sometimes
sets in at this time of the season.
A WEEK OF HARD WORK
"We have to work hard this week
j and it will take our best game to
get past Washington State," said
Shaughnessy, "but after this week
we have two weeks to get ready for
California and I'll let you go Mon
j day and Tuesday."
Everybody is pretty concerned
over this Cougar outfit. Babe Hol
! ling berry's men not only defeated
Oregon State but walloped them.
And no longer is Bill Sewell the
only threat, for Bob Kennedy has
| developed into a first-rate power
! back. Felix Fletcher, the great pass
catching halfback, has not been feel
ing up to snuff for a couple of weeks
but he should be ready to play down
here Saturday.
BASKETBALL END
Dale Gentry, a member of the
Cougars' championship basketball
team, is at one end. He and Fletcher
are Sewell's main receivers, but 011
the other end is big Nick Susoeff.
a fine all-around wingman, who is
capable of the most rugged end game
on the Coast.
Washington State doesn't fool
around. Kennedy scored three times
in seven minutes against Idaho Sat
urday and these Cougars have come
to life all of a sudden to beat some
of the best teams in the conference.
Rain or shine, Sewell can be de
pended on for a brilliant punting,
passing, and running game. He is
almost as good as the great Ed God
dard and if it wasn't for Frankie Al
bert's rep on the Coast, Billy would
probably wiggle into that All -
American backfield.
