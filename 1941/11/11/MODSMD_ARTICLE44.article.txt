said to us yesterday morning:
"Didn't you enjoy the game down South?"
As a matter of fact, we enjoyed the game very much, frustrating though
it was to see this Indian team that is one of the best football outfits in the
country fail to ring up points on drives that carried deep into U.S.C.'s
territory.
In our story, we merely said that many were disappointed because
the Indians didn't knock the Trojans right out of the stadium. And
they were.
But from the number of persons here on the campus who have made
it a point to tell us that they thought the game was very interesting
and very good, we happily conclude that the students here aren't
getting as spoiled as some of the grid fans who follow the Reds from
game to game.
It's not hard for observers, who have become accustomed to watching
a Stanford team that either won games in the last quarter of play or
else completely smother the opposition, get to the point where they expect
miracles from the Cards Saturday after Saturday.
Clark Shaughnessy recognizes that fans are getting to the point of
demanding everything in the book each week-end. In the dressing room
after the game last Saturday, Shaughnessy, a study in serious thought
fulness, said:
"It's not enough for the boys to make four or five yards on a play any
more. The people want a touchdown or the next thing to it. That's what j
comes with success."
When you're on top, you have to fight harder than ever to stay
there. And that's just the spot these Indians arc in now—the spot
they've been in ever since the beginning of the season.
They've held up well. There are only two battles left on the regular
schedule. Whether or not the Big Red Machine is involved in the New
Year's Day struggle in Pasadena remains to be seen.
This Saturday it's the W.S.C. game. The following week finds the In
dians taking it easy, with a bye for the first time this season. And then
it's the Big Game in the Stanford Stadium on Nov. 29.
Two more games to go, and they'll be toughies.
If Stanford wins, no matter what the scores may be, we'll be satisfied.
Plenty satisfied. Won't you?

J UST where Stanford will stand in the national ratings after the week
end games, we don't know at the time of this writing, although you
probably will have been able to find out by the time you read this.
At any rate, it's our idea that Clark Shaughnessy's boys should he
right near the top. They were seventh last week, according to Dekc
Houlgatc, the guy who figures it out with numbers. Leading them
were Navy, Texas, Minnesota, Duke, Ford ham, and Michigan.
Notre Dame showed Navy where to head in. Texas had to be satisfied
with a tie with Baylor—a team that Texas A. & M. had soundly walloped
earlier in the year. Fordham took it on the chin from Pitt.
Michigan didn't play, but Minnesota didn't appear very effective in
downing Nebraska. All of which leaves Duke, who had a breather, as the
only outfit in the first six which lived up to its reputation Saturday.
We don't know how you can make them come ( out according to figures,
btu we'd say that it wouldn't be too far off the beam to put Duke, Stanford,
Michigan, and Minnesota in that order, with Texas close behind.
We're iust guessing, but so are you.

schedule. Whether or not the Big Red Machine is involved in the New
Year's Day struggle in Pasadena remains to be seen.
This Saturday it's the W.S.C. game. The following week finds the In
dians taking it easy, with a bye for the first time this season. And then
it's the Big Game in the Stanford Stadium on Nov. 29.
Two more games to go, and they'll be toughies.
If Stanford wins, no matter what the scores may be, we'll be satisfied.
Plenty satisfied. Won't you?

J UST where Stanford will stand in the national ratings after the week
end games, we don't know at the time of this writing, although you
probably will have been able to find out by the time you read this.
At any rate, it's our idea that Clark Shaughnessy's boys should he
right near the top. They were seventh last week, according to Dekc
Houlgatc, the guy who figures it out with numbers. Leading them
were Navy, Texas, Minnesota, Duke, Ford ham, and Michigan.
Notre Dame showed Navy where to head in. Texas had to be satisfied
with a tie with Baylor—a team that Texas A. & M. had soundly walloped
earlier in the year. Fordham took it on the chin from Pitt.
Michigan didn't play, but Minnesota didn't appear very effective in
downing Nebraska. All of which leaves Duke, who had a breather, as the
only outfit in the first six which lived up to its reputation Saturday.
We don't know how you can make them come ( out according to figures,
btu we'd say that it wouldn't be too far off the beam to put Duke, Stanford,
Michigan, and Minnesota in that order, with Texas close behind.
We're iust guessing, but so are you.

"Didn't you enjoy the game down South?"
As a matter of fact, we enjoyed the game very much, frustrating though
it was to see this Indian team that is one of the best football outfits in the
country fail to ring up points on drives that carried deep into U.S.C.'s
territory.
In our story, we merely said that many were disappointed because
the Indians didn't knock the Trojans right out of the stadium. And
they were.
But from the number of persons here on the campus who have made
it a point to tell us that they thought the game was very interesting
and very good, we happily conclude that the students here aren't
getting as spoiled as some of the grid fans who follow the Reds from
game to game.
It's not hard for observers, who have become accustomed to watching
a Stanford team that either won games in the last quarter of play or
else completely smother the opposition, get to the point where they expect
miracles from the Cards Saturday after Saturday.
Clark Shaughnessy recognizes that fans are getting to the point of
demanding everything in the book each week-end. In the dressing room
after the game last Saturday, Shaughnessy, a study in serious thought
fulness, said:
"It's not enough for the boys to make four or five yards on a play any
more. The people want a touchdown or the next thing to it. That's what j
comes with success."
When you're on top, you have to fight harder than ever to stay
there. And that's just the spot these Indians arc in now—the spot
they've been in ever since the beginning of the season.
They've held up well. There are only two battles left on the regular
schedule. Whether or not the Big Red Machine is involved in the New
Year's Day struggle in Pasadena remains to be seen.
