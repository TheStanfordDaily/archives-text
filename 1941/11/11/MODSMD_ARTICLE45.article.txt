# 'Little Giant' Team Piles up Victories
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 10 (UP). â€”
Their backfield has averaged a first
down on every other play in mov
ing a mile and a half on the gridiron
this season and their coach is the
smallest mentor in the business, so
it's only fitting to recognize the Mid
land College warriors of Fremont,
Neb., as this week's United Press
"little giant" football team.
