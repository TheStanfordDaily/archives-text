varsity water polo team will face
California Saturday morning at 11 in
the first of a two-game series.
The Farm freshman mermen will
face the powerful Bear Cube in the
preliminary Saturday morning at 10.
The Bear freshmen paid their own
way to Los Angeles last week-end
and walloped the U.S.C. freshmen, 19
to 5, and the U.C.L.A. first-year men,
10 to 4.
Stanford's line-up is somewhat in
doubt at the present time, according
to Coach Norton Thornton.
The dependable backfield of Bob
Jones and Frank Mitchell, guards,
and Jack Bleecker, center back, is
pretty well set as are Bill Mapel at
sprint and Hadley Bacon at for
ward.
But the remaining forward job
and goalie position are wide open,
according to Thornton, with three
men about equal for each spot. Bert
Singer, Grant Culley, and Fred
Man waring are the three top for
ward aspirants, while Pete Lee, Bob
Breckner, and Ed Smith are battling
it out at goalie.
Scrimmage this week will tell the
story, Thornton added.
