# Frosh Gridders Turn to Basketball
## 
### 
Some of Harry Shipkey's Papoose
gridders will exchange the foot for
the basket in the next couple of days
as frosh hoop coach Bobby Burnett's
winter workouts get into full swing.
Due to report are Dave "Bomber"
Brown, Jack Heald, Bob Hall, Fred
dy Parsons, and Dave Porter, who
handles himself beautifully despite
the excess avoirdupois and muscle.
Brown played for the Oakland

Athens Club last year and looks like
a real ball player. Heald and Hall,
both ends on the yearling football
team, along with Brown and Par
sons, the 9.7 dash man, will start
practicing with the Redskin babes
at their regular 2-4 p.m. session any
day now.
The frosh season opens January 1,
when the Burnettmen tangle with
Piedmont High at the home roost.
