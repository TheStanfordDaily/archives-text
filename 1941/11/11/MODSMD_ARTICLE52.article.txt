# Armistice Day---1941
## 
### 
STANFORD today will be just like Stanford
on any other day —no celebrations, no
speeches, no moments of silence as in the past.
In town, stores which used to close in memory
of the past are staying open.
Last year classes were dismissed for a chapel
service and the blowing of taps. Last year Presi
dent Roosevelt led the nation in a prayer for
peace from Arlington Cemetery.
This morning the President speaks to the
nation from the same spot, the grave of the Un
known Soldier. This year his words will not be
a blind prayer for peace.
They will echo a seeking for peace. But they
will be tempered by the knowledge that there
can be no peace while the swastika flies from
Europe's flagpoles.
Our thoughts should not be in the past. We
must forget the peace that failed and strive to
build from its wreckage a peace that will last.
The following message from International
Student Service expresses just what Armistice
Day, 1941, should mean to us. In succeeding
issues The Daily will discuss the questions em
bodied in the message—
