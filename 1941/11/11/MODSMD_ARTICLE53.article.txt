### 
To the millions who in 1918 celebrated the
first Armistice Day, it meant the end of a long,
bitter struggle and the beginning of a new and
better era.
After 23 years we are observing Armistice
Day in the midst of a new and more terrible
war, the result of humanity's failure to utilize
the opportunities presented by the peace of
Versailles. As we, the American people, now
take up the grim task of mobilizing all our re
sources for defense, we must also make sure
that we shall not lose the next peace.
The character of the peace that will come
out of this war will in part be determined by
the degree to which statesmen are supported
by a mature and informed public opinion.
Colleges can take leadership in diffusing in
formation and stimulating interest in the prob
lems inherent in building a better world. Cer
tainly the student body, with its associates
everywhere, whether in the armed forces, on
the farm or in the factory, who will inherit
the post-war world, have a right and responsi
bility to concern themselves with this issue.
The United States Committee of Interna
tional Student Service, therefore, urges that
Armistice Day thoughts be organized around
the theme of peace aims and post-war recon
struction.
The foremost questions to be considered
are:
1. What stake does the United States have
in the peace that will follow the war?
2. Is the Roosevelt-Churchill statement of
peace aims—the Atlantic Charter—an ade
quate summary of the peace aims of the
American people? How shall those aims be
implemented and realized?
We could make this Armistice Day an oc
casion for mourning over the failure of the
1918 Armistice to provide a lasting peace. Or
we could blindly and selfishly concern our
selves only with protection against immediate
dangers. It would be far better to work posi
tively to create a just peace and a better inter
national order within the democratic frame
work and with faith in the peoples of the world
to govern themselves. Even in this bleak win
ter of man's hopes, we can sow the seeds that
will produce the springtime of a better world.
