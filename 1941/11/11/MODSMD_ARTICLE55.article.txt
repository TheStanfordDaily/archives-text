to breathe, to ride over hill and dale on sunny
days and revel in the natural life.
It's nice to be able to luxuriously take a week
end off from work and responsibilities and travel
800 miles through California to and from an off
campus football game.
But this is also a brutal world. There is an
essential fight for existence, and this means sur
vival of the fittest. Civilization interprets this
fight with the mediums of precaution, safety,
prevention and rules of the game. Too often it
becomes necessary to invoke a pound of cure.
Tragically, it is too often impossible even to
apply a pound of cure.
Death rides the highway. Years of precise,
safe driving can be blasted to eternity by a split
second of carelessness. Dead or maimed bodies
and tortured minds and unnecessary grief and
expense are the penalties.
You know these things. But is it enough to
sigh, "So be it," and forget?
When you drive home for vacations, to foot
ball games, on business or for a night in the
city, keep these suggestions keenly in mind:
1. Never relax your vigil while at the wheel.
2. Do not distract the driver.
3. Regard every other driver as a damned
fool, as suggested previously in this column.
4. Obey the law.
5. Plan your trip to permit safe driving speed,
minimum of night driving and minimum of driv
ing in sloppy weather. Avoid driving during
hours of heavy traffic, if possible.
6. Make sure your car is mechanically sound:
brakes, lights, tires, steering apparatus, horn,
windshield wipers, tail lights.
7. No liquor.
8. Be sure the driver is competent and ex
perienced.
9. Watch out for those ill-lighted jalopies
darting out of side roads and clogging the high
ways. They're often driven by drunks or irre
sponsible kids.
10. Use old-fashioned horse sense; don't take
a chance.

But this is also a brutal world. There is an
essential fight for existence, and this means sur
vival of the fittest. Civilization interprets this
fight with the mediums of precaution, safety,
prevention and rules of the game. Too often it
becomes necessary to invoke a pound of cure.
Tragically, it is too often impossible even to
apply a pound of cure.

When you drive home for vacations, to foot
ball games, on business or for a night in the
city, keep these suggestions keenly in mind:
1. Never relax your vigil while at the wheel.
2. Do not distract the driver.
3. Regard every other driver as a damned
fool, as suggested previously in this column.
4. Obey the law.
5. Plan your trip to permit safe driving speed,
minimum of night driving and minimum of driv
ing in sloppy weather. Avoid driving during
hours of heavy traffic, if possible.
6. Make sure your car is mechanically sound:
brakes, lights, tires, steering apparatus, horn,
windshield wipers, tail lights.
7. No liquor.
8. Be sure the driver is competent and ex
perienced.
9. Watch out for those ill-lighted jalopies
darting out of side roads and clogging the high
ways. They're often driven by drunks or irre
sponsible kids.
10. Use old-fashioned horse sense; don't take
a chance.
