### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
PRIVILEGES FOR MARGARET
Vf/HEN I wrote that Bull Session last week about
girls being the equals of men, and advocating that
they pay half of all dates, I wrote it and then thought
everyone would start doing it. But last Sunday night
as I was walking past the show, I saw a Stanfoi-d man
buy both tickets, both of them, while the girl stood,
with a preoccupied look on her face, looking at the
coming attraction posters. The idea has not gone over.
Besides that I have been receiving some letters, argu
ing the points over with me. One letter in particular
was very interesting, and I think expresses the views
of most of Stanford women. It said in part:
"But did you ever stop to realize, as have most
girls many times, that what men are paying for on
these occasions is the privilege (and it is a privilege,
as you would see were it taken from you) of asking
whom you please, when you please, where you please
and how you please. It has been, except on rare occa
sions, the right of man to seek out the girl ... to
telephone, to call, to date, or correspond. In any of
these matters, what choice is left to the girl?"
* * * «
TI/TAY I try to answer this girl. In the first place I
admit that it is a privilege to ask a girl out,
having the right to decide on when, where, and how
and the others. And it is a privilege that men would
not like to lose. But never did I say that men should
Jose that privilege, but what I did say was that women
should pay for half the date. Now if that statement
implies that women should also have the privilege of
asking the men out, having the privilege of phoning
and arranging the date, that is an implication that I
am in favor of. I am not saying this because I have
gradually been pushed to that conclusion, but because
I really, seriously think that it would be a fine thing.
So you see, I wouldn't want to see that privilege
taken away from men, but instead I would like to see
it extended to women. And I don't think that many
men will disagree with me on this unless they have a
distorted notion of their dignity and importance. I
don't think that many men would think it a bad thing
to be relaxed in their room, and - have a girl phone
and say I'll be over at eight. The man wouldn't have
to worry about a car, wouldn't have to wori-y about
the where, or about the when or anything. All he
would have to do would be to dx - ess up and relax and
wait to be amused by the girl. I don't think many men
would object to such a set-up.

A ND don't you believe that more people would be
brought together this way? Wouldn't it be twice
as exciting? Don't you think that a bunch of boys and
girls miss coming together because of shyness on the
part of -the men? There must be a lot of girls that
would like to ask boys out, but just can't do it. They
know they can't do it, but if you ask them why, they
will be rather vague and say something about it not
being the right thing to do. Of course there is nothing
wrong with it.
But please don't think that I want women to be
the aggressors and the men the ones who sit around
and wait. That's just what I don't want because I
don't think it has worked for the girls. What I do want
is equality. If the girl wants to ask a boy out, she
does and they go out and each pays half and they have
a good time. And if the boy wants to take a girl out,
the same thing. Instead of just having one half of
our humanity asking and working to get together
with the other half, we would have everyone chasing
everyone else, and I think that more people would get
together.

Jose that privilege, but what I did say was that women
should pay for half the date. Now if that statement
implies that women should also have the privilege of
asking the men out, having the privilege of phoning
and arranging the date, that is an implication that I
am in favor of. I am not saying this because I have
gradually been pushed to that conclusion, but because
I really, seriously think that it would be a fine thing.
So you see, I wouldn't want to see that privilege
taken away from men, but instead I would like to see
it extended to women. And I don't think that many
men will disagree with me on this unless they have a
distorted notion of their dignity and importance. I
don't think that many men would think it a bad thing
to be relaxed in their room, and - have a girl phone
and say I'll be over at eight. The man wouldn't have
to worry about a car, wouldn't have to wori-y about
the where, or about the when or anything. All he
would have to do would be to dx - ess up and relax and
wait to be amused by the girl. I don't think many men
would object to such a set-up.

A ND don't you believe that more people would be
brought together this way? Wouldn't it be twice
as exciting? Don't you think that a bunch of boys and
girls miss coming together because of shyness on the
part of -the men? There must be a lot of girls that
would like to ask boys out, but just can't do it. They
know they can't do it, but if you ask them why, they
will be rather vague and say something about it not
being the right thing to do. Of course there is nothing
wrong with it.
But please don't think that I want women to be
the aggressors and the men the ones who sit around
and wait. That's just what I don't want because I
don't think it has worked for the girls. What I do want
is equality. If the girl wants to ask a boy out, she
does and they go out and each pays half and they have
a good time. And if the boy wants to take a girl out,
the same thing. Instead of just having one half of
our humanity asking and working to get together
with the other half, we would have everyone chasing
everyone else, and I think that more people would get
together.

would like to ask boys out, but just can't do it. They
know they can't do it, but if you ask them why, they
will be rather vague and say something about it not
being the right thing to do. Of course there is nothing
wrong with it.
But please don't think that I want women to be
the aggressors and the men the ones who sit around
and wait. That's just what I don't want because I
don't think it has worked for the girls. What I do want
is equality. If the girl wants to ask a boy out, she
does and they go out and each pays half and they have
a good time. And if the boy wants to take a girl out,
the same thing. Instead of just having one half of
our humanity asking and working to get together
with the other half, we would have everyone chasing
everyone else, and I think that more people would get
together.
PRIVILEGES FOR MARGARET
Vf/HEN I wrote that Bull Session last week about
girls being the equals of men, and advocating that
they pay half of all dates, I wrote it and then thought
everyone would start doing it. But last Sunday night
as I was walking past the show, I saw a Stanfoi-d man
buy both tickets, both of them, while the girl stood,
with a preoccupied look on her face, looking at the
coming attraction posters. The idea has not gone over.
Besides that I have been receiving some letters, argu
ing the points over with me. One letter in particular
was very interesting, and I think expresses the views
of most of Stanford women. It said in part:
"But did you ever stop to realize, as have most
girls many times, that what men are paying for on
these occasions is the privilege (and it is a privilege,
as you would see were it taken from you) of asking
whom you please, when you please, where you please
and how you please. It has been, except on rare occa
sions, the right of man to seek out the girl ... to
telephone, to call, to date, or correspond. In any of
these matters, what choice is left to the girl?"
* * * «
TI/TAY I try to answer this girl. In the first place I
admit that it is a privilege to ask a girl out,
having the right to decide on when, where, and how
and the others. And it is a privilege that men would
not like to lose. But never did I say that men should
Jose that privilege, but what I did say was that women
should pay for half the date. Now if that statement
implies that women should also have the privilege of
asking the men out, having the privilege of phoning
and arranging the date, that is an implication that I
am in favor of. I am not saying this because I have
gradually been pushed to that conclusion, but because
I really, seriously think that it would be a fine thing.
So you see, I wouldn't want to see that privilege
taken away from men, but instead I would like to see
it extended to women. And I don't think that many
men will disagree with me on this unless they have a
distorted notion of their dignity and importance. I
don't think that many men would think it a bad thing
to be relaxed in their room, and - have a girl phone
and say I'll be over at eight. The man wouldn't have
to worry about a car, wouldn't have to wori-y about
the where, or about the when or anything. All he
would have to do would be to dx - ess up and relax and
wait to be amused by the girl. I don't think many men
would object to such a set-up.

A ND don't you believe that more people would be
brought together this way? Wouldn't it be twice
as exciting? Don't you think that a bunch of boys and
girls miss coming together because of shyness on the
part of -the men? There must be a lot of girls that
would like to ask boys out, but just can't do it. They
know they can't do it, but if you ask them why, they
will be rather vague and say something about it not
being the right thing to do. Of course there is nothing
wrong with it.
But please don't think that I want women to be
