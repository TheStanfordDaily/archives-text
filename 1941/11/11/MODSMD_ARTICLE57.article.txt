r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In reply to the "Bull Session" of November 5, I
should like to ask Mr. Saroyan one question: What
would be his attitude regarding "some definite action"
on the part of the United States, in behalf of England
and Russia? Some action that would involve more than
mere "sympathy with Russians and English," and
"sending over airmen, mechanics, and 'numerous
planes'"?
'Margaret Morten. '43
I can't decide.—Saroyan
