# 'New Yorker's' Best Short Stories Published In Book
## 
### 
"Short Stories from the New Yorker," Simon and Schuster, New York.
In the 15 years that it has been published, the New Yorker has become
one of America's most versatile and popular humor magazines. Much of
its popularity has come from its monthly publication of short stories by
a wide selection of today's most prominent authors.

Both for those who follow
magazine every month and those
who are only slightly familiar with
it, Simon and Schuster have com
piled and edited a valuable collec
tion of 68 short stories, the cream of
those which have made the New
Yorker a publisher of the best short
fiction in America.
This dazzling assembly is not con
fined solely to those stories which are
funny, because the selection ruled
out the magazine's weekly gems of
humorous satire, burlesque, parody,
nonsense, humorous reminiscence
and reporting in order to give the
readers fiction.
INCLUDES FAVORITES
Within the covers of this collec
tion are contained such well-remem
bered favorites as Irwin Shaw's
charming "Gifls in Their Summer
Dresses," E. B. White's psycholog
ical satire, "The Door," two Dorothy
Parker typicals, "Arrangement in
Black and White" and Soldiers of
the Republic."
If you prefer gripping realism,
there are Robert M. Coates" "The
Net," and "Incident on a Street Cor
ner," by Albert Maltz, or Erskine
Caldwell's "Man and Woman." Or
perhaps you like accounts of life's
little tragedies like Walter Bern
stein's "Houseparty" and Nancy
Hale's poignant "Midsummer."
DOMESTIC STORIES
In contrast are the domestic stories
of Sally Benson and Sherwood An
derson's, "Nice Girl," and brief
sketches of eveiyday trials we all
meet, including "The Test," by An
gelica Gibbs, "The Knife," by Bren
dan Gill, and Benedict Thielen's in
comparable "Tourist Home."
These are only a few of the most
notable, but every one has an indi
viduality that makes it distinctive
and readable. The entire collection
presents excellence and variety which
indicates that the New Yorker, as
well as being America's leading hu
morous publication, is also a source
of the most distinguished contempo
rary short fiction in the world to
dayâ€”Craig
