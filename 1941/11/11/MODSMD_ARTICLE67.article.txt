# Hats Go Conservative But Retain Originality
## 
### 
The hat problem should be a eincii this season, judging from all the
reports. The lack of French imports has made milady's hits comp: rativel;
conservative, a fact which should please the men. Not the most darhr
weeds you can find make up a bat this year; whatever really shows o.'l
your best assets should dett i nline your choice.

Youthful culots that perch on top
of your head wit I) devilish wings
peeking out on each side might just
transform you into something pretty
.special. Perhaps you like to look
through u misty haze and prefer a
cobwebby veil. The sophisticated
young tiling might choose one of
those snood affairs which covers the
back of her hair like an apron.
Tall women can wear the more ex
treme type of hat more easily than
the diminutives. Derby-like doo
dads, which are almost straight out
of a Virginia hunt, have been soft
ened up with veils and leathers to
suit the tastes of the sports enthusi
ast and look mighty chic with tai
lored clothes.
Many women approve the hat
which matches one particular cos
tume. It might have a grosgrain
trim to match a black faille and vel
vet dress or a splotch of fur which
matches the mull or fur coat. Soft
felt hats which a California mist
can't ruin are always popular.
In short, any old thing to keep du
rum off won't do this year accord
ing to the experts.
