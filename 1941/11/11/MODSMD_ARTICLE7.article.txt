# Knickerbocker Opus Is Satire
## Musical Comedy Hit Will Open Thursday 
### 
For all its sophisticated song and
fast humor, "Knickerbocker Holi
day," hit Broadway musical to be
presented this Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday nights in Memorial Hall, is
first and foremost a crackling polit
ical satire.
The plot is the story of liberty vs.
dictatorship. More particularly,
Brom Broek, who can't take orders
and who loves Tina, clashes with
Governor Pieter Stuyvesant, who
likes to give orders, and who has or
dered Tina to marry him.
Nieuw Amsterdam has a Town
Council as corrupt as any. Governor
Stuyvesant takes over, and amid
general rejoicing assisted by his
army, proclaims his New Order,
which has a remarkably modern fla
vor. Brom is tossed in jail.
After the exciting incidents where
in Tina loses her six petticoats while
visiting in jail one night, and the In
dian attack on the settlement, the
peg-legged dictator orders Brom
hanged and tells the Council to pull
the rope.
Contrasting their old government,
corrupt but easy-going, and the
new one, even more corrupt and to
talitarian to boot, Brom makes a
final appeal from the gallows. The
Council, remembering their ancient
liberties and their lost profits, rebel.
Governor Pieter orders his troops
to shoot them down, and only in the
nick of time does Washington Irv
ing, the author, appear. Appealing
to Stuyvesant in the name of pos
terity, he persuades the governor to
relent. Brom marries Tina, and
"they all live happily ever after."
Tickets for "Knickerbocker Holi
day" are on sale in Room 202 in
Memorial Hall, price 83 cents, tax
included.
