# Return to Simplicity, Feminism Mark 1941 Fashion Trends; U.S. Takes Lead in Style from Paris
## 
### 
"Welcome hack" is (he keynote of fashion trends for 1941 . . . wel
come hack to the simplicity, the natural lines, the feminism which char
acterized the clothes women wore from the turn of the century through
(lie early twenties. These are the styles women love to wear and men
admire because they're flattering, they're practical, and they are an escape

from the stark realism of today's
world.
America has taken up the fashion
banner which once flew so proudly
over Paris, and women throughout
the world are now looking to Ameri
can designers for the pace-setting
styles and trends. These designers
have met this challenge with all the
ingenuity and initiative at their
command. The result, according to
"Vogue," is clothes timed for these
times .... yet which bring back
some of history's most heartbreak
ing fashions.
Draft Emphasizes Clothes
The Stanford woman has every
reason to be vitally interested in
this year's fashion trends. She wants
to be as attractive as possible, for
the "two-to-one ratio," her insur
ance of social success, has gone with
Ihe draft. She wants the classic
clothes that will wear and be kind
to her already overtaxed budget.
And because she's young, she wants
some of the fads and touches of mad
ness that punctuate the' styles of
1941.
Now that we know what a Stan
ford woman wants in date and dressy
clothes let's give her the chance of
a lifetime to make those desires
come true. Let's lock her closet door
and send her out into the world of
fashion armed with a checkbook and
current issues of Vogue, Harpers,
and Mademoiselle. She must build
an entirely new dress wardrobe,
incorporating the newest trends, ma
terials, and lines into it and still have
a collection of clothes that are suit
able for Stanford.
Vogue Gives Trends
From Vogue she will learn the
general trends of this year's fashions.
She will discover that the natural
feminine line characterizes every
type of clothes. Gone are the exag
gerated shoulders and waist lines,
that have been so popular in the last
few years. Vogue and Harpers have
both stressed the pencil-slim sil
houette for daytime clothes.
This radical change from the cas
ual full-skirted dirndls and peasant
fashions is indicative of the Ameri
can women's new business-like at
titude. She has little need for the
whimsical whirly clothes of other
years when each day is crammed
with charity drives, war relief work,
and dozens of other responsibilities
which women have assumed in the
national emergency.
Glamour for Evening
The Draft may have snared a good
percentage of the men, but Miss
Stanford Woman who is in on the
hunt for a new wardrobe will give
plenty of time and thought to the
selection of date clothes. When the
night lights come on, she wants to
forget her bawlout average and wrap
herself in an aura of feminism and
glamour.
This year's date clothes reflect the
war styles of 1918. Black is good as
always but color has taken the most
prominent place in the fashion pic
ture. This is proven by Vogue's sur
vey which showed that fabric com
panies sold 70% colored materials
1 his year and only 30% black.
Welcome Back
A few of the welcome back fea
tures that have been incorporated in
the dressier clothes are: simple lines
with emphasis on trimming, jet
jewelry, capes, uneven hemlines,
covered-up evening dresses.
'1 he Stanford woman sighs and
turns a little green with envy when
she sees these styles portrayed in
Vogue, but unless she's a terriffic
extrovert, she'll pass them by when
she's choosing a Farm wardrobe.
However, there are a few of the New
York designers brainchildren that
the Stanford co-ed will use to good
advantage. She'll stick to black for
her date clothes with touches of
color supplying the drama. And the
colors she uses will be new: petunia
pink, vermillion, purple, and even
orange.
Wind-proof Hats
Hats are the big news this year
and the smart woman will forget her
prejudice against them if she's in
the market for masculine approval.
The cranium toppers for 1941 are
decorative, practical (a la San Fran
cisco breezes), and dear to the hearts
of men.
Cloches Excellent
Ihe Cloche, a deep-crown little
number that sits well down on the
head and frames the face, is making
most of the millinery headlines. This
type of hat graced the heads of smart
women through the decade of the
twenties and the length of its popu
larity is proof enough of its becom
ingness.
For the few die-hards who still
refuse to wear hats, there are an
infinite variety of skull caps which
cover the back hair. This extension
of brims downward gives an all-in
one impression so that the hat looks
as if it were a continuation of the
dress.
Comes It War
Congress passed the Draft Act and
twenty million women blossomed out
in brass buttons, gold braid, and
replicas of American flags on every
piece of wearing apparel. The mili
taristic trend in fashions started out
as a fillip to jaded wardrobes, but
it has since progressed to national
hysteria. Women from Nantucket
to Pasadena have entered the mad
race to achieve the wardrobe rank
ing of a General or Major.

This is poison to "our boys in
camp" and the sooner the fair sex
realize it the better. No man wants
to be blinded by braid and brass
buttons five days a week and then
spend his weekends basking in the
reflected glory of his female dressed
like a West Pointer on dress parade.
Coats Coming Up
By now our Stanford woman
should have quite a gorgeous array
of clothes, but in deference to the
wayward quality of California
weather, she still must select coats.
The casual wrap-around style has
been dragged out of the past and
promises to attain great popularity.
Vogue and a good many of its con
temporaries stress the trend of bulki
ness in coats and slimness in dresses.
Stanford women's first loves, the
reefer and the princess-style coat
will still be in great demand, but
the wrap-around is the big fashion
news.
Clothes for Morale
It's a pretty grim world the college
girl of today faces and for the sake
of her own confidence and the mor
ale of her man, she must not forget
for a moment the importance of be
ing attractive.
She must be pretty-as-a-picture,
efficient as a Draft Board, and pre
sent a courageous front to the world.
The New York designers have cap
tured this feeling in the clothes for
this season, and women, the object
of their creativeness, have the task
of wearing these clothes with all the
dignity and suaveness at their com
mand.
