mas presents, there's a smart money
clip that's making news — great
heavy initials in gold that keep the
greenbacks in a nice tidy bunch. Or
if it's something ready-made you're
looking for substitute a large dollar
sign.
Then there's one with a coin con
tainer on the other side. Push a
center button and out pops the quar
ter, nickel, or dime. It comes in pig
skin or morocco leather.
For a really fine present, dig a
twenty dollar goldpiece out of the
family archives and have it made into
a clip.
