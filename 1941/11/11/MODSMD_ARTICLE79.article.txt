# Chiffon Scarfs Aid Fur Collar Problem

### 
The experts have now dug up an
answer to that prime sticklerâ€”the
problem of keeping the collar of one's
fur coat in presentable condition.
This doesn't mean to insinuate that
one's neck is dirty but the new chif
fon scarfs are a superb idea.
They are narrow in the middle to
protect your coat and still not wide
enough to bubble out at the top.
Then they have wide ends which fall
in deep flattering folds. They are
both flattering and practical and they
come in all colors.
