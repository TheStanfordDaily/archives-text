# Hair Stays Up, Coifs Are Short
## 
### 
'Short' is the byword of hair styl
ists speaking about the trend of
coiffeurs for the coming year. Either
short all over, or short in back, and
long in front, but short somewhere.
The most recent development in
haircuts are three to five inch locks
which can be easily manipulated into
becoming styles for practical wear
or formal affair. You may have
waves and swirls, puffs and curls.
Particular attention is being paid to
top-of-the-head treatment and un
usual back arrangements. The up
and off-the-face sweep, with nape
curls in back seems to be most pre
dominant, but bangs, curled under
and otherwise are also very popular.
Defense Coiffures
National defense (you can't escape
it) shows its influence in novel 'wing
styles' with "V" parts. More practi
cal is the Popinjay, in which the hair
is five to six inches long on the sides
and in front, and two to three inches
in back. This is very adaptable for
variety hair-dos.
One salon uses as its slogan, "as
the hat goes, so goes the hair," indi
cating the value of changeable coifs.
Pompadours, of course, are very con
venient and for the most part flat
tering to set off a tricky hat.
Individualism Is In
Actually, however, the prevailing
style is not as important as it used
to be. The trend is toward individual
styling to find the coiffure most be
coming to the contours of the face.
But the latest in coiffures has little
to do with Stanford and most col
lege coeds, according to beauty op
erators in Palo Alto. "Short and up,"
says the fashion—"long and loose,"
say Stanfordites. "They want it even
looser than last year, if that is pos
sible," one operator reports. "Just
a wave, maybe, on top, possibly a
swirl over the ear, and then loose
and wavy to the ends."
"Different"—As Usual
The explanation for the popularity
of this style with college and high
school girls (it has lasted now for
more than four years) is that it
seems easier to keep, although there
seems to be a shade of doubt as to
the validity of this reason. Hair still
has to be "put up" every night, and
there evidently is no decline in busi
ness for beauty salons.
Pompadours were gaining popu
larity for a while, along with bangs,
but they are losing ground again
now to the "Stanford Classic."
Of course, the fact that most girls
on campus prefer the long and loose
style does not mean that there aren't
many more adventurous souls who
like to experiment, and try some
thing a little more unusual.
The new short styles are influenc
ing coeds somewhat, however, in that
the dominant shoulder length is giv
ing way slightly. The trend is not so
much "up," as simply a little shorter.

the dominant shoulder length is giv
ing way slightly. The trend is not so
much "up," as simply a little shorter.
'Short' is the byword of hair styl
ists speaking about the trend of
coiffeurs for the coming year. Either
short all over, or short in back, and
long in front, but short somewhere.
The most recent development in
haircuts are three to five inch locks
which can be easily manipulated into
becoming styles for practical wear
or formal affair. You may have
waves and swirls, puffs and curls.
Particular attention is being paid to
top-of-the-head treatment and un
usual back arrangements. The up
and off-the-face sweep, with nape
curls in back seems to be most pre
dominant, but bangs, curled under
and otherwise are also very popular.
Defense Coiffures
National defense (you can't escape
it) shows its influence in novel 'wing
styles' with "V" parts. More practi
cal is the Popinjay, in which the hair
is five to six inches long on the sides
and in front, and two to three inches
in back. This is very adaptable for
variety hair-dos.
One salon uses as its slogan, "as
the hat goes, so goes the hair," indi
cating the value of changeable coifs.
Pompadours, of course, are very con
venient and for the most part flat
tering to set off a tricky hat.
Individualism Is In
Actually, however, the prevailing
style is not as important as it used
to be. The trend is toward individual
styling to find the coiffure most be
coming to the contours of the face.
But the latest in coiffures has little
to do with Stanford and most col
lege coeds, according to beauty op
erators in Palo Alto. "Short and up,"
says the fashion—"long and loose,"
say Stanfordites. "They want it even
looser than last year, if that is pos
sible," one operator reports. "Just
a wave, maybe, on top, possibly a
swirl over the ear, and then loose
and wavy to the ends."
"Different"—As Usual
The explanation for the popularity
of this style with college and high
school girls (it has lasted now for
more than four years) is that it
seems easier to keep, although there
seems to be a shade of doubt as to
the validity of this reason. Hair still
has to be "put up" every night, and
there evidently is no decline in busi
ness for beauty salons.
Pompadours were gaining popu
larity for a while, along with bangs,
but they are losing ground again
now to the "Stanford Classic."
Of course, the fact that most girls
on campus prefer the long and loose
style does not mean that there aren't
many more adventurous souls who
like to experiment, and try some
thing a little more unusual.
