# Icy Art Advanced By Swirling Skirts
## 
### 
Take up skating if only to wear
one of dhose cute, short, swirly
skirts. There's a white gabardine
suit with green rick-rack trim and
a flowered percale lining that shows
when you twirl.
There's a smoothie in black and
whiteâ€”checked top with long sleeves
and a long tucked waist leading into
a full black skirt. Or try a brilliant
flannel skirt with a knitted cable
stitch sweater in white.
The pains and aches after a ses
sion on the ice will be compensated
for by the compliments.
