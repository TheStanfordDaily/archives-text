# Coffee Can Windings, Bottle Tops to Bedeck Smart Lapels
## 
### 
Original and home jewelry is 'in' for the coming year. Pins concocted
from coffee can windings and cork necklaces are among Ihe wilder ideas.
Lapel pins fashioned from coke bottle tops and strung with colored

yarn are easy to make. Just remove + -
the piece of cork, insert the yarn,
and replace the cork.
Why not wear a red skeleton key?
Try painting one with bright red nail
polish. If you wear different shades
of polish yourself, paint several keys
so that you will always have one to
match.
Try Amateur Carving
It isn't hard to carve soap into
interesting shapes. Block letters,
dogs, Indians, drums, and radios are j
a few ideas. When painted with
water colors, even the most amateui*- !
ish attempts are effective.
Colored rubber bands bound to
gether with thread into soft, string
balls offer many possibilities.
An odd-shaped chip of wood (the
kind little boys carry in their pock
ets) can be used for a pin if you
print your initials on it with map
tacks.
Anything Goes
If you would like to be a blessing J
in disguise, print the date on a small ;
card, fasten a clothes pin to the card,
and clip them both to your lapel.
You will be most valuable on the
first of the month and on examina
tion mornings.
Paper clips strung together in var
ious patterns and combinations of
large and small offer a great field for
originality. Why not try it your- 1
self?
Have you thought of stringing cof
fee can unwindings into a bracelet
with colored yarn?
