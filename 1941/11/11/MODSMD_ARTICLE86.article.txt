# Vitamins Cause Pill Box Boom
## 
### 
Pill boxes may mean hats to the
average student but to vitamin con
scious females, pill boxes are boxes
for pills.
These tip-o-your-thumb size cre
ations come in round, square, oval,
and horseshoe shapes made of gold,
silver, enamel, and cloisonne. Women
pay from $1.00 to $7.00 for the
gadget containers in Palo Alto shops.
Jewelers and dress shops have
carried pill boxes for approximately
three years, but the vitamin rage has
stimulated a sales boom. Vitamin
B and its complexes are by far the
most popular excuses for purchasing
pill boxes.
VITAMIN HORS D'OUVRES
At a recent cocktail party in Nt j w
York, the hostess passed a tray of
Vitamin B pills to prevent hang
overs. Guests promptly opened their
purses and filled their pill boxes.
Approximately 12 tablet sized Vi
tamin B pills fit into the average
pill box. Women also carry rni
grain, aspirin, and glucose pills in
these boxes.
Despite the usefulness of pill boxes
for pills, many clerks are con
vinced that women buy the gadgets
just because they are cute litUe
boxes. Some women collect them.
Others find them to be ideal Christ
mas and birthday gifts.
SILVER TAKES FIRST
Filagree silver is the most widely
used material for pill boxes in Palo
Alto jewelry shops. Designs include
Dutch windmills, raised hearts,
horseshoes, and flowers. Runners
up are perfectly plain round sterling
silver boxes and gold fill heart
shapes.
Most shops also carry white en
amel square boxes with book open
ings. One of these is topped by a
gold lion. Another carries a rhine
stone bird with an imitation ruby
eye. Oval shaped gold boxes with
cloisonne flowers in the middles are
on display.
New York jewelers are advertis
ing more expensive pill boxes inlaid
with genuine stones. Novelty brace
lets with pill boxes in the center are
also popular in the East.

Jewelers and dress shops have
carried pill boxes for approximately
three years, but the vitamin rage has
stimulated a sales boom. Vitamin
B and its complexes are by far the
most popular excuses for purchasing
pill boxes.
VITAMIN HORS D'OUVRES
At a recent cocktail party in Nt j w
York, the hostess passed a tray of
Vitamin B pills to prevent hang
overs. Guests promptly opened their
purses and filled their pill boxes.
Approximately 12 tablet sized Vi
tamin B pills fit into the average
pill box. Women also carry rni
grain, aspirin, and glucose pills in
these boxes.
Despite the usefulness of pill boxes
for pills, many clerks are con
vinced that women buy the gadgets
just because they are cute litUe
boxes. Some women collect them.
Others find them to be ideal Christ
mas and birthday gifts.
SILVER TAKES FIRST
Filagree silver is the most widely
used material for pill boxes in Palo
Alto jewelry shops. Designs include
Dutch windmills, raised hearts,
horseshoes, and flowers. Runners
up are perfectly plain round sterling
silver boxes and gold fill heart
shapes.
Most shops also carry white en
amel square boxes with book open
ings. One of these is topped by a
gold lion. Another carries a rhine
stone bird with an imitation ruby
eye. Oval shaped gold boxes with
cloisonne flowers in the middles are
on display.
New York jewelers are advertis
ing more expensive pill boxes inlaid
with genuine stones. Novelty brace
lets with pill boxes in the center are
also popular in the East.

fastest growing family. Meet the all-
Nylon sweaters, the first of their
kind just received in San Francisco.
Pill boxes may mean hats to the
average student but to vitamin con
scious females, pill boxes are boxes
for pills.
