# Suede Jacket Returns to Favor
## 
### 
Newest in jackets is the suede
doeskin jacket, aptly called Leather
neck. It's so silky, so lush, so bright,
that it'll be a favorite for nippy win
ter days. Collared like a little boy's
coat, and with a string belt for jerk
ing in the waist, it's entirely simple
and businesslike.
Best of all are the woolen-match
ing colors, of which the most suited
to Stanford is a tangy Chinese red.
