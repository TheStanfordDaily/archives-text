# Through Twenty Years Farm Coeds Retain 'Stanford Different' Slogan

### BARBARA STEVENS 
One way to trace the changing
Stanford co-ed is to check her shop
ping instincts from 20 years back
down to the year 1941 .... and be
lieve us, she has changed!
Think of the campus woman of
today.. .her hair combed back.. .at
tired in red from the ribbon perched
in her curls to the top of her turned
down rubber boots.. .a careful bit of
lipstick, dash of powder.

with belts.. .there was a prevailing
fashion, possibly a preview of 1941
.. .for wearing boys' sweaters. ..
There was a craze for hand-knit
ted suits...and sweaters were defi
