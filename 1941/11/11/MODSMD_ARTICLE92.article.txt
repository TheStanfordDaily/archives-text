# Through Twenty Years Farm Coeds Retain 'Stanford Different' Slogan
## 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
One way to trace the changing
Stanford co-ed is to check her shop
ping instincts from 20 years back
down to the year 1941 .... and be
lieve us, she has changed!
Think of the campus woman of
today.. .her hair combed back.. .at
tired in red from the ribbon perched
in her curls to the top of her turned
down rubber boots.. .a careful bit of
lipstick, dash of powder.
Contrast this picture with a Stan
ford woman of not-really-so-long
ago ... her hair piled forward and
enhanced with numerous spit curls
.. .her rouge, lipstick and mascara,
fashionably inches deep...think of
her on Quad in a pleated skirt...
ground-length... but' don't imagine
she would be seen in red...she

barred it from her wardrobe be
cause it was the campus color and
too common!
KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED
Reports gathered from Palo Alto
merchants indicate that the Stanford
woman has always known what she
wanted when she came in to buy her
clothes.. .and has never settled for
a substitute.. .she has always been
more style-conscious than girls from
any other coast colleges.. .she has
shown unfailing good taste. "Strict
ly Stanford" clothes have been
bought to appeal to her, for it has
been said that the "Stanford girl is
a little different."
Looking hack into the past...it
is easy to see that, yes, the Stan
ford girl has always been a little
different.. .apparently her worst

appearances wore dictated by
fashion, though it is hard to be
lieve that she always tempered her
style sense with her famed good
taste...
Going back 20 years ago.. .when
skirts dropped to the ground (in
length).. .and sweaters were cinched
with belts.. .there was a prevailing
fashion, possibly a preview of 1941
.. .for wearing boys' sweaters. ..
There was a craze for hand-knit
ted suits...and sweaters were defi
nitely not a-la-sloppy Joe. Vivid
lisle stockings were good for sports
wear (recent attempts to revive this
colorful fashion have not so far been
successful).
Quad styles were more conserva
tive one-piece dresses and fewer of
the '41 classic skirt and sweater en
sembles complete with ten-inch
strands of pearls. In fact, very little
of the early Stanford woman's al
lowance was squandered 011 "junk
jewelry," but she, too, found herself
a little low toward the end of the
month, and checking back, usually
discovered that most of her dimes
and dollars had gone for more and
more and more cosmetics.. .and
deeply pronounced marcels...
But she too used up more closet
space with her smart bucket bats
...(bucket hats were the thing be
cause any other kind would pie
vent her hair from showing at all
...and with the hours and hours
she put into that marcelled, pom
padourcd and spit-curled work of
art.. .it bad lo show!
In the.evenings.. .she went some
what risque... since it was the era
of short, knee-length, evening dress
es with flounces and ruffles and the
indefinite waistline that slipped
down on the hips...and it was also
the era...when gathering her cour
age...and casting convention to the
winds...she did away with silk
stockings, and atempted to both fool
the public, and save in hosiery.
STOCKING SHEERER
Contrary to present opinion.. .the
dozen nylons that are locked in every
Stanford woman's strong box, since
they are supposed to be worth their
weight in gold, according to war
scare reports.. .are not really as
sheer and of as lovely a quality as
those luxed every night by the Class
of '22. Theirs were limited to shades
varying on peach, however, and
couldn't change from the golden
browns, to the red-browns that cur
rent selections include.
In spring a young girl's fancy
lightly turns to buying one or
even two new bathing suits in an
effort to dazzle the Stanford rough
when she reclines on the boathouse
deck presumably studying psych,
but actually working up to a good
game of bridge... .Think of the
time when the stores of Palo Alto

carried only black Jantzen bathing
suits... their limited repertoire
putting a crimp in spring shopping
expeditions.. .definitely.
Cheering the Wow Boys on, the
Stanford woman wears a white
blouse. . .skirt. . .and when the cool-1
Jer shadows fall during the fourth
quarter she slips on a red, or white
sweater. Cheering 911 the pre-Vow
Boy teams was a different thing. . .at
| the first sign of cool weather, made
moiselle co-ed of the early 20's whip
-1 pod out her priJje striped blazer with
the fancy pony-slcin collar. She
wore dark dresses... not white
blouse and skirt.. .nine times out of
ten she didn't own a white blouse,
but she owned a drawer of white
dickie#...
RAIN ALWAYS WITH US
Coming down from the darker ages
of Stanford to about "the middle of
the 30'th...it seems that a few dis
mal rainy winters similar to the last
few... inspired some colorful rain
paraphernalia that can be only
equalled by the late red hat, coat
and boots, fire house combinations
... Galoshes took the place of boots
...but the rain coats were fash
ioned of heavy, shiny leather similar
to rubber-boot cloth, in every bright
shade imaginable.. .Their popularity
was voted in on a landslide, and
their durability insured them of a
third term... Says one saleslady,
reminiscing, "I sold 39 one day my
self."
Before the beanie...of several
years ago, there was a small,
round, French-basque style beret
that made its way into the closet
of every Stanford woman who was
really in the know.
So is the somewhat sketchy re
view of the Stanford woman from
the 20's to the 40's. Over the whole
! period, she seems to have favorably
impressed the merchants and sales
people of Palo Alto. They comment,
"There is a lovely class of girls at
Stanford, they are always lady-like
and easy to be friends with."
"The girls haven't changed much
except that they seem younger.

and easy to be friends with."
"The girls haven't changed much
except that they seem younger.
One way to trace the changing
Stanford co-ed is to check her shop
ping instincts from 20 years back
down to the year 1941 .... and be
lieve us, she has changed!
Think of the campus woman of
today.. .her hair combed back.. .at
tired in red from the ribbon perched
in her curls to the top of her turned
down rubber boots.. .a careful bit of
lipstick, dash of powder.
Contrast this picture with a Stan
ford woman of not-really-so-long
ago ... her hair piled forward and
enhanced with numerous spit curls
.. .her rouge, lipstick and mascara,
fashionably inches deep...think of
her on Quad in a pleated skirt...
ground-length... but' don't imagine
she would be seen in red...she

barred it from her wardrobe be
cause it was the campus color and
too common!
KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED
Reports gathered from Palo Alto
merchants indicate that the Stanford
woman has always known what she
wanted when she came in to buy her
clothes.. .and has never settled for
a substitute.. .she has always been
more style-conscious than girls from
any other coast colleges.. .she has
shown unfailing good taste. "Strict
ly Stanford" clothes have been
bought to appeal to her, for it has
been said that the "Stanford girl is
a little different."
Looking hack into the past...it
is easy to see that, yes, the Stan
ford girl has always been a little
different.. .apparently her worst

appearances wore dictated by
fashion, though it is hard to be
lieve that she always tempered her
style sense with her famed good
taste...
Going back 20 years ago.. .when
skirts dropped to the ground (in
length).. .and sweaters were cinched
with belts.. .there was a prevailing
fashion, possibly a preview of 1941
.. .for wearing boys' sweaters. ..
There was a craze for hand-knit
ted suits...and sweaters were defi
nitely not a-la-sloppy Joe. Vivid
lisle stockings were good for sports
wear (recent attempts to revive this
colorful fashion have not so far been
successful).
Quad styles were more conserva
tive one-piece dresses and fewer of
the '41 classic skirt and sweater en
sembles complete with ten-inch
strands of pearls. In fact, very little
of the early Stanford woman's al
lowance was squandered 011 "junk
jewelry," but she, too, found herself
a little low toward the end of the
month, and checking back, usually
discovered that most of her dimes
and dollars had gone for more and
more and more cosmetics.. .and
deeply pronounced marcels...
But she too used up more closet
space with her smart bucket bats
...(bucket hats were the thing be
cause any other kind would pie
vent her hair from showing at all
...and with the hours and hours
she put into that marcelled, pom
padourcd and spit-curled work of
art.. .it bad lo show!
In the.evenings.. .she went some
what risque... since it was the era
of short, knee-length, evening dress
es with flounces and ruffles and the
indefinite waistline that slipped
down on the hips...and it was also
the era...when gathering her cour
age...and casting convention to the
winds...she did away with silk
stockings, and atempted to both fool
the public, and save in hosiery.
STOCKING SHEERER
Contrary to present opinion.. .the
dozen nylons that are locked in every
Stanford woman's strong box, since
they are supposed to be worth their
weight in gold, according to war
scare reports.. .are not really as
sheer and of as lovely a quality as
those luxed every night by the Class
of '22. Theirs were limited to shades
varying on peach, however, and
couldn't change from the golden
browns, to the red-browns that cur
rent selections include.
In spring a young girl's fancy
lightly turns to buying one or
even two new bathing suits in an
effort to dazzle the Stanford rough
when she reclines on the boathouse
deck presumably studying psych,
but actually working up to a good
game of bridge... .Think of the
time when the stores of Palo Alto

carried only black Jantzen bathing
suits... their limited repertoire
putting a crimp in spring shopping
expeditions.. .definitely.
Cheering the Wow Boys on, the
Stanford woman wears a white
blouse. . .skirt. . .and when the cool-1
Jer shadows fall during the fourth
quarter she slips on a red, or white
sweater. Cheering 911 the pre-Vow
Boy teams was a different thing. . .at
| the first sign of cool weather, made
moiselle co-ed of the early 20's whip
-1 pod out her priJje striped blazer with
the fancy pony-slcin collar. She
wore dark dresses... not white
blouse and skirt.. .nine times out of
ten she didn't own a white blouse,
but she owned a drawer of white
dickie#...
RAIN ALWAYS WITH US
Coming down from the darker ages
of Stanford to about "the middle of
the 30'th...it seems that a few dis
mal rainy winters similar to the last
few... inspired some colorful rain
paraphernalia that can be only
equalled by the late red hat, coat
and boots, fire house combinations
... Galoshes took the place of boots
...but the rain coats were fash
ioned of heavy, shiny leather similar
to rubber-boot cloth, in every bright
shade imaginable.. .Their popularity
was voted in on a landslide, and
their durability insured them of a
third term... Says one saleslady,
reminiscing, "I sold 39 one day my
self."
Before the beanie...of several
years ago, there was a small,
round, French-basque style beret
that made its way into the closet
of every Stanford woman who was
really in the know.
So is the somewhat sketchy re
view of the Stanford woman from
the 20's to the 40's. Over the whole

impressed the merchants and sales

impressed the merchants and sales
people of Palo Alto. They comment,
"There is a lovely class of girls at
Stanford, they are always lady-like
and easy to be friends with."
"The girls haven't changed much
except that they seem younger.
One way to trace the changing
Stanford co-ed is to check her shop
ping instincts from 20 years back
down to the year 1941 .... and be
lieve us, she has changed!
Think of the campus woman of
today.. .her hair combed back.. .at
tired in red from the ribbon perched
in her curls to the top of her turned
down rubber boots.. .a careful bit of
lipstick, dash of powder.
Contrast this picture with a Stan
ford woman of not-really-so-long
ago ... her hair piled forward and
enhanced with numerous spit curls
.. .her rouge, lipstick and mascara,
fashionably inches deep...think of
her on Quad in a pleated skirt...
ground-length... but' don't imagine
she would be seen in red...she

barred it from her wardrobe be
cause it was the campus color and
too common!
KNEW WHAT SHE WANTED
Reports gathered from Palo Alto
merchants indicate that the Stanford
woman has always known what she
wanted when she came in to buy her
clothes.. .and has never settled for
a substitute.. .she has always been
more style-conscious than girls from
any other coast colleges.. .she has
shown unfailing good taste. "Strict
ly Stanford" clothes have been
bought to appeal to her, for it has
been said that the "Stanford girl is
a little different."
Looking hack into the past...it
is easy to see that, yes, the Stan
ford girl has always been a little
different.. .apparently her worst

appearances wore dictated by
fashion, though it is hard to be
lieve that she always tempered her
style sense with her famed good
taste...
Going back 20 years ago.. .when
skirts dropped to the ground (in
length).. .and sweaters were cinched
with belts.. .there was a prevailing
fashion, possibly a preview of 1941
.. .for wearing boys' sweaters. ..
There was a craze for hand-knit
ted suits...and sweaters were defi
nitely not a-la-sloppy Joe. Vivid
lisle stockings were good for sports
wear (recent attempts to revive this
colorful fashion have not so far been
successful).
Quad styles were more conserva
tive one-piece dresses and fewer of
the '41 classic skirt and sweater en
sembles complete with ten-inch
strands of pearls. In fact, very little
of the early Stanford woman's al
lowance was squandered 011 "junk
jewelry," but she, too, found herself
a little low toward the end of the
month, and checking back, usually
discovered that most of her dimes
and dollars had gone for more and
more and more cosmetics.. .and
deeply pronounced marcels...
But she too used up more closet
space with her smart bucket bats
...(bucket hats were the thing be
cause any other kind would pie
vent her hair from showing at all
...and with the hours and hours
she put into that marcelled, pom
padourcd and spit-curled work of
art.. .it bad lo show!
In the.evenings.. .she went some
what risque... since it was the era
of short, knee-length, evening dress
es with flounces and ruffles and the
indefinite waistline that slipped
down on the hips...and it was also
the era...when gathering her cour
age...and casting convention to the
winds...she did away with silk
stockings, and atempted to both fool
the public, and save in hosiery.
STOCKING SHEERER
Contrary to present opinion.. .the
dozen nylons that are locked in every
Stanford woman's strong box, since
they are supposed to be worth their
weight in gold, according to war
scare reports.. .are not really as
sheer and of as lovely a quality as
those luxed every night by the Class
of '22. Theirs were limited to shades
varying on peach, however, and
couldn't change from the golden
browns, to the red-browns that cur
rent selections include.
In spring a young girl's fancy
lightly turns to buying one or
even two new bathing suits in an
effort to dazzle the Stanford rough
when she reclines on the boathouse
deck presumably studying psych,
but actually working up to a good
game of bridge... .Think of the
time when the stores of Palo Alto

carried only black Jantzen bathing
suits... their limited repertoire
putting a crimp in spring shopping
expeditions.. .definitely.
Cheering the Wow Boys on, the
Stanford woman wears a white
blouse. . .skirt. . .and when the cool-1
Jer shadows fall during the fourth
quarter she slips on a red, or white
sweater. Cheering 911 the pre-Vow
Boy teams was a different thing. . .at
| the first sign of cool weather, made
moiselle co-ed of the early 20's whip
-1 pod out her priJje striped blazer with
the fancy pony-slcin collar. She
wore dark dresses... not white
blouse and skirt.. .nine times out of
ten she didn't own a white blouse,
but she owned a drawer of white
dickie#...
RAIN ALWAYS WITH US
Coming down from the darker ages
of Stanford to about "the middle of
the 30'th...it seems that a few dis
mal rainy winters similar to the last
few... inspired some colorful rain
paraphernalia that can be only
equalled by the late red hat, coat
and boots, fire house combinations
... Galoshes took the place of boots
...but the rain coats were fash
ioned of heavy, shiny leather similar
to rubber-boot cloth, in every bright
shade imaginable.. .Their popularity
was voted in on a landslide, and
their durability insured them of a
third term... Says one saleslady,
reminiscing, "I sold 39 one day my
self."
Before the beanie...of several
years ago, there was a small,
round, French-basque style beret
that made its way into the closet
of every Stanford woman who was
really in the know.
So is the somewhat sketchy re
view of the Stanford woman from
the 20's to the 40's. Over the whole
! period, she seems to have favorably
impressed the merchants and sales
people of Palo Alto. They comment,
