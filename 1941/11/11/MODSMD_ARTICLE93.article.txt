Since the first purpose of clothes
is to provide protection from the
elements, the first thing that should
be considered in selecting shoes,
skirts, dresses and so forth is wheth
er the clothes do keep the cold out,
do keep the rain off and in general
keep the body protected from the
weather.
After this comes the matter of
comfort, because all clothes that you
wear should be comfortable. You
shouldn't have to think about them.
You shouldn't always have to be ad
justing something, or have a sweater
that tickles the neck, or shoes that
look good but cannot be walked in
after the first hour. Comfort should
always be taken into consideration
when choosing clothes.

After adequate protection and the
comfort of the clothes have been
decided upon, then should the looks
of the clothes be considered. For as
long as clothes are going to be woni,
and since clothes are things that are
seen all the time, the matters of
color, style, and material and the
way the clothes match might as well
be pleasing to the eye.
Every year there are certain
basic things that always look good
on girls. Starting from the bottom
up, saddle shoes never go out of
style, and look good around the
campus. Then there's a kind of a
brown shoe, in the shape of a moc
assin, that looks sturdy and com
fortable. There's a girl in one of
my classes that has a pair, and I sit
and watch them all through class.
Of course there is nothing like high
heels to give the legs length and
form, but they don't look too good
around the campus.

Now that silk stockings aren't in
quired, most girls are wearing bobby
socks. The best looking ones are the
real wooley kind. And these socks
of course should match what is be
ing worn above.
Around school I hardly ever sec
dresses anymore, mostly sweaters
and skirts. And I think they're keen.
They give the girl a young, happy
fresh look, besides having a nice in
formal appearance.
They can be of any colors, but the
skirts and sweaters look best when
there is a contrast between the two.
When the skirt is dark, the sweater
should be light and the other way
around. The best colors for sweaters
and stockings are brown, the differ
ent shades of green and blue. White
tennis sweaters look fine as do red
sweaters. Any kind of a white thing
underneath the sweaters is required
to set off the neck and face from the
sweater.

Something stuck in the hair looks
good on certain girls. Either a little
flower or a strip of a bandanna. The
coloring of these again depends on
the color of the hair.
Above all keep the clothes simple,
and the lines straight. Avoid com
plicated blouses and too many little
pins and animals and names hung
from your clothes. Be protected, be
comfortable, wear colors that go well
With the coloring of your faces, look
neat, have a little system in your
color scheme so that there will only
be about two different colors at most,
look even and balanced, be good
and everyone will love you.

long as clothes are going to be woni,
and since clothes are things that are
seen all the time, the matters of
color, style, and material and the
way the clothes match might as well
be pleasing to the eye.
Every year there are certain
basic things that always look good
on girls. Starting from the bottom
up, saddle shoes never go out of
style, and look good around the
campus. Then there's a kind of a
brown shoe, in the shape of a moc
assin, that looks sturdy and com
fortable. There's a girl in one of
my classes that has a pair, and I sit
and watch them all through class.
Of course there is nothing like high
heels to give the legs length and
form, but they don't look too good
around the campus.

Now that silk stockings aren't in
quired, most girls are wearing bobby
socks. The best looking ones are the
real wooley kind. And these socks
of course should match what is be
ing worn above.
Around school I hardly ever sec
dresses anymore, mostly sweaters
and skirts. And I think they're keen.
They give the girl a young, happy
fresh look, besides having a nice in
formal appearance.
They can be of any colors, but the
skirts and sweaters look best when
there is a contrast between the two.
When the skirt is dark, the sweater
should be light and the other way
around. The best colors for sweaters
and stockings are brown, the differ
ent shades of green and blue. White
tennis sweaters look fine as do red
sweaters. Any kind of a white thing
underneath the sweaters is required
to set off the neck and face from the
sweater.

Something stuck in the hair looks
good on certain girls. Either a little
flower or a strip of a bandanna. The
coloring of these again depends on
the color of the hair.
Above all keep the clothes simple,
and the lines straight. Avoid com
plicated blouses and too many little
pins and animals and names hung
from your clothes. Be protected, be
comfortable, wear colors that go well
With the coloring of your faces, look
neat, have a little system in your
color scheme so that there will only
be about two different colors at most,
look even and balanced, be good
and everyone will love you.
Since the first purpose of clothes
is to provide protection from the
elements, the first thing that should
be considered in selecting shoes,
skirts, dresses and so forth is wheth
er the clothes do keep the cold out,
do keep the rain off and in general
keep the body protected from the
weather.
After this comes the matter of
comfort, because all clothes that you
wear should be comfortable. You
shouldn't have to think about them.
You shouldn't always have to be ad
justing something, or have a sweater
that tickles the neck, or shoes that
look good but cannot be walked in
after the first hour. Comfort should
always be taken into consideration
when choosing clothes.

After adequate protection and the
comfort of the clothes have been
decided upon, then should the looks
of the clothes be considered. For as
long as clothes are going to be woni,
and since clothes are things that are
seen all the time, the matters of
color, style, and material and the
way the clothes match might as well
be pleasing to the eye.
