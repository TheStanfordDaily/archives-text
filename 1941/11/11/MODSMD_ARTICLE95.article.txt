//\7"OU CAN always tell a Stanford woman, but you can't tell
JL her much."
This flip cliche has been applied many times to many situa
tions. It is not this writer's intention to chart the nature and ex
tent of its truth. Specifically, however, we feel that it is valid
with regard to fashion.
It is hard to believe that any woman on the Farm rushes to
check her attire with the latest Vogue or Harpers or even, more
leisurely, to peruse them studiously for "hints." And it is insane
to conceive of a typical Stanford woman eagerly scanning these
pages for guidance in dressing.
She has high fashion standards and what she doesn't know
she is sure is not important.
She may be wrong, but she's never in doubt.
With these characteristics in mind the editor and staff of the
current fashion edition of the Daily have set about telling the
Stanford woman, not what should or will be worn, but what is
actually being worn, and what is available to her.â€”R. M.
