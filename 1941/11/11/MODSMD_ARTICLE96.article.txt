# 'V'—FOR VICARIOUS
## 
### 
DOT-DOT-DOT-DASH tapped out on a table in an Athens res
taurant.
The opening notes of Beethoven's Fifth whistled by an anony
mous man on a crowded street in Prague.
"V" chalked on a wall in Belgrade.
A Nazi officer murdered in a lonely Oslo alley.
One hundred innocent "hostages" stood up against a Parisian
wall and shot.
"V" FOR VICTORY.

"This year the newest wrinkle in fashion gadgets and dress
design is inspired by the "V" campaign. The dot-dot-dot-dash
makes a new and oh-so-attractive textile design . . . We have
worked the "V" motif into pockets, and belt buckles on the new
fall sports-wear .... and if you're really dashing you'll feature
a "V" pin or clip on that new black dress . . .
Thus spake the American dress-designers this fall, proving
to all that they can read a newspaper as well as the next man.
It's a snappy new winkle, all right. It caught on right away—
went like a house afire. One hairdresser, with a topical turn
of mind, even thought up a new hairdess with the V's worked
out in sausage-curls. It wasn't too becoming to the model, but
it made Life Magazine.
The idea has gone like wild-fire in Europe, too. Only in a
little different guise. One "V" embroidered on a breast pocket
is good for one (1) tete-a-tete with a German firing squad over
there. Nobody wears a "V" in public. They brand it on their
hearts. It takes courage to do that.
We Americans go for thrills. Preferably cheap thrills—a
kick without a kick-back. Mrs. Glotz can sport a "V" as well as
Mrs. Astor. We drag it through Tiffany's and Woolworth's with
equal glee.
Over there, "V" signifies a chance to regain freedom, if they
fight long enough, and hard enough, and enough of them die.
But in the Good Old U.S.A., V stands for "vicarious"—an easy
way to prove you're a patriot with little effort and less thought. '
We buy our freedom on a dress—they seek it in concentration
camps, sabotage, and bread riots.—J.N.

went like a house afire. One hairdresser, with a topical turn
of mind, even thought up a new hairdess with the V's worked
out in sausage-curls. It wasn't too becoming to the model, but
it made Life Magazine.
The idea has gone like wild-fire in Europe, too. Only in a
little different guise. One "V" embroidered on a breast pocket
is good for one (1) tete-a-tete with a German firing squad over
there. Nobody wears a "V" in public. They brand it on their
hearts. It takes courage to do that.
We Americans go for thrills. Preferably cheap thrills—a
kick without a kick-back. Mrs. Glotz can sport a "V" as well as
Mrs. Astor. We drag it through Tiffany's and Woolworth's with
equal glee.
Over there, "V" signifies a chance to regain freedom, if they
fight long enough, and hard enough, and enough of them die.
But in the Good Old U.S.A., V stands for "vicarious"—an easy
way to prove you're a patriot with little effort and less thought. '
We buy our freedom on a dress—they seek it in concentration
camps, sabotage, and bread riots.—J.N.
DOT-DOT-DOT-DASH tapped out on a table in an Athens res
taurant.
The opening notes of Beethoven's Fifth whistled by an anony
mous man on a crowded street in Prague.
"V" chalked on a wall in Belgrade.
A Nazi officer murdered in a lonely Oslo alley.
One hundred innocent "hostages" stood up against a Parisian
wall and shot.
"V" FOR VICTORY.

"This year the newest wrinkle in fashion gadgets and dress
design is inspired by the "V" campaign. The dot-dot-dot-dash
makes a new and oh-so-attractive textile design . . . We have
worked the "V" motif into pockets, and belt buckles on the new
fall sports-wear .... and if you're really dashing you'll feature
a "V" pin or clip on that new black dress . . .
Thus spake the American dress-designers this fall, proving
to all that they can read a newspaper as well as the next man.
It's a snappy new winkle, all right. It caught on right away—
