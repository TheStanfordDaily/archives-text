strands are medium length, hand
knotted, and finished off with a
bowl-you-over catch of double,
square brilliants.

vital if it hasn't a touch of fire en
gine red somewhere. If you're cau

carry a flaming bag and gloves. If

go "all out" with a dress, evening
gown or wrap that will knock their
eyes out.
