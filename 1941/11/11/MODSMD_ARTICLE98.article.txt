# College Girl Sets Own Rules In Gown Game
## Dress Experts Try To Fathom Depths Of Campus Thought 
### JEAN NOWELL 
There's something wrong with the
system. No matter how hard they
try, and Heaven knows they try, the
college girl and the fashion editor
can't seem to get together.
"The college girl will plug such
and such this year," state the People-
Who-Know firmly each fall.
But somehow, a note of pleading
creeps into the statement.
"How very interesting," comments
the College Girl vaguely, and wan
ders off on some new fashion tang
ent, oblivious to the agony she has
left behind her.
ISSUE EDICT
From time to time, the harried
ladies who put out the monthly
treatises on clothes, issue an edict.
Two years ago, they put forth the
dogmatic statement that diagonal
plaids were in.
Last year at this time they had the
pencil skirt, for both street and eve
ning wear, on their minds. The Col
lege Girl sniffed the plaids tenta
tively for a year, checked the breadth
of her beam, and came around
grudgingly about a year and a half
later, if she thought she was slim
enough.
The straight skirts fared even
more unhappily. The college girl
likes things with swish and swing—
and she's clung to them firmly, and
with little ill-effect.
SHE'S NOT SLOW
Not that the American College
Girl is slow—far from it. She just
has her own ideas, and the new
things originate on the campus, not
on the Editor's drafting boards.
Check back. The only edict, com
ing from the style centers, which
has been adopted by the College Girl,
has been shorter skirts. And the col
lege skirt had always been a little
bit shorter than decreed.
On the other hand—sweaters, both
backwards and forwards, as well as
skirts in general—have been the ob
ject of editorial sharpshooting for
years. They've tried to put us in
cute little wool dresses, or in match
ing suits, and such for years. These
have made certain headway, yes,
but only because they were prac
tical—and the classic sweater and
skirt still leads the field by miles.
TAKE EM AND LIKE EM
The bucket hat, and fireman's hat
—both rain musts—originated with
the girls. The girls bought boys'
hats, first, and then the manufac
turers got wise and constructed a
few models on the same plan.
Boots—also de rigeur for rain—
they came at a dollar and half out
of children's stores until the shoemen
came to the parade.
Pig-tails, pearls, knee socks, sad
dle-shoes, baggy sweaters—all these
came out of the obscure reaches of
some College Girl's mind. Then the
Fashion people picked them up, and
plugged them. Unfortunately, like
Dopey, they're always just a little
bit behind. By the time they ferret
out a fad, it's on its way out.
lIOW THEY'VE TRIED
They've tried—oh,yes—they even
have College Girls put out their Col
lege issues* —but the basic trouble is
still the same. The Gals, well-in
formed though they may be, can't
predict the future devious working
of their own minds. They can report
what has happened — most college
curriculums do not include Necro
mancy either MWF or dhur.
Then, too, skip the most basic fac
tor in the girl's clothes-life .... the
time element. The tricky little deals
they try to palm off on us, arc simply
not designed to be donned in the ten
minutes' grace allowed before the 8
o'clock dash.
For the same reason, the wash
afc|es and often-need-to-be-cleaned's
fare badly. The College Girl likes
to be washed, but she doesn't want
to fuss with terrific laundry bills or
cleaner's delays if she can possibly
help it.
Then there's the comfort angle.
Flats for walking, non-wrinkle-ables
(nobody likes to look as tho she'd
slept in her clothes, even if she has)
warmth without too much weight
(a binder is heavy enough). All
these enter in.
SHE'S PRACTICAL
Cockcyed gadgets and fads offer
amusement and diversions — but
cold-eyed practicality is the basis
for every college fashion. Even pig
tails are practical because they offer
an easy way to keep your hair with
out benefit of hairdresser or bobby
pins.
Fashion is spinach — something
you've got to take whether you like
it. or not—according to Elizabeth
Hawes. But somebody has gotten
back at the people who've been
choking us on spinach for so many
years. The College Girl is handing
the spinach back to the Fashion ex
perts, and they're eating it.
But they don't like it.

out a fad, it's on its way out.
lIOW THEY'VE TRIED
They've tried—oh,yes—they even
have College Girls put out their Col
lege issues* —but the basic trouble is
still the same. The Gals, well-in
formed though they may be, can't
predict the future devious working
of their own minds. They can report
what has happened — most college
curriculums do not include Necro
mancy either MWF or dhur.
Then, too, skip the most basic fac
tor in the girl's clothes-life .... the
time element. The tricky little deals
they try to palm off on us, arc simply
not designed to be donned in the ten
minutes' grace allowed before the 8
o'clock dash.
For the same reason, the wash
afc|es and often-need-to-be-cleaned's
fare badly. The College Girl likes
to be washed, but she doesn't want
to fuss with terrific laundry bills or
cleaner's delays if she can possibly
help it.
Then there's the comfort angle.
Flats for walking, non-wrinkle-ables
(nobody likes to look as tho she'd
slept in her clothes, even if she has)
warmth without too much weight
(a binder is heavy enough). All
these enter in.
SHE'S PRACTICAL
Cockcyed gadgets and fads offer
amusement and diversions — but
cold-eyed practicality is the basis
for every college fashion. Even pig
tails are practical because they offer
an easy way to keep your hair with
out benefit of hairdresser or bobby
pins.
Fashion is spinach — something
you've got to take whether you like
it. or not—according to Elizabeth
Hawes. But somebody has gotten
back at the people who've been
choking us on spinach for so many
years. The College Girl is handing
the spinach back to the Fashion ex
perts, and they're eating it.
But they don't like it.
There's something wrong with the
system. No matter how hard they
try, and Heaven knows they try, the
college girl and the fashion editor
can't seem to get together.
"The college girl will plug such
and such this year," state the People-
Who-Know firmly each fall.
But somehow, a note of pleading
creeps into the statement.
"How very interesting," comments
the College Girl vaguely, and wan
ders off on some new fashion tang
ent, oblivious to the agony she has
left behind her.
ISSUE EDICT
From time to time, the harried
ladies who put out the monthly
treatises on clothes, issue an edict.
Two years ago, they put forth the
dogmatic statement that diagonal
plaids were in.
Last year at this time they had the
pencil skirt, for both street and eve
ning wear, on their minds. The Col
lege Girl sniffed the plaids tenta
tively for a year, checked the breadth
of her beam, and came around
grudgingly about a year and a half
later, if she thought she was slim
enough.
The straight skirts fared even
more unhappily. The college girl
likes things with swish and swing—
and she's clung to them firmly, and
with little ill-effect.
SHE'S NOT SLOW
Not that the American College
Girl is slow—far from it. She just
has her own ideas, and the new
things originate on the campus, not
on the Editor's drafting boards.
Check back. The only edict, com
ing from the style centers, which
has been adopted by the College Girl,
has been shorter skirts. And the col
lege skirt had always been a little
bit shorter than decreed.
On the other hand—sweaters, both
backwards and forwards, as well as
skirts in general—have been the ob
ject of editorial sharpshooting for
years. They've tried to put us in
cute little wool dresses, or in match
ing suits, and such for years. These
have made certain headway, yes,
but only because they were prac
tical—and the classic sweater and
skirt still leads the field by miles.
TAKE EM AND LIKE EM
The bucket hat, and fireman's hat
—both rain musts—originated with
the girls. The girls bought boys'
hats, first, and then the manufac
turers got wise and constructed a
few models on the same plan.
Boots—also de rigeur for rain—
they came at a dollar and half out
of children's stores until the shoemen
came to the parade.
Pig-tails, pearls, knee socks, sad
dle-shoes, baggy sweaters—all these
came out of the obscure reaches of
some College Girl's mind. Then the
Fashion people picked them up, and
plugged them. Unfortunately, like
Dopey, they're always just a little

of her beam, and came around
grudgingly about a year and a half
later, if she thought she was slim
enough.
The straight skirts fared even
more unhappily. The college girl
likes things with swish and swing—
and she's clung to them firmly, and
with little ill-effect.
SHE'S NOT SLOW
Not that the American College
Girl is slow—far from it. She just
has her own ideas, and the new
things originate on the campus, not
on the Editor's drafting boards.
Check back. The only edict, com
ing from the style centers, which
has been adopted by the College Girl,
has been shorter skirts. And the col
lege skirt had always been a little
bit shorter than decreed.
On the other hand—sweaters, both
backwards and forwards, as well as
skirts in general—have been the ob
ject of editorial sharpshooting for
years. They've tried to put us in
cute little wool dresses, or in match
ing suits, and such for years. These
have made certain headway, yes,
but only because they were prac
tical—and the classic sweater and
skirt still leads the field by miles.
TAKE EM AND LIKE EM
The bucket hat, and fireman's hat
—both rain musts—originated with
the girls. The girls bought boys'
hats, first, and then the manufac
turers got wise and constructed a
few models on the same plan.
Boots—also de rigeur for rain—
they came at a dollar and half out
of children's stores until the shoemen
came to the parade.
Pig-tails, pearls, knee socks, sad
dle-shoes, baggy sweaters—all these
came out of the obscure reaches of
some College Girl's mind. Then the
Fashion people picked them up, and
plugged them. Unfortunately, like
Dopey, they're always just a little
bit behind. By the time they ferret
out a fad, it's on its way out.
lIOW THEY'VE TRIED
They've tried—oh,yes—they even
have College Girls put out their Col
lege issues* —but the basic trouble is
still the same. The Gals, well-in
formed though they may be, can't
predict the future devious working
of their own minds. They can report
what has happened — most college
curriculums do not include Necro
mancy either MWF or dhur.
Then, too, skip the most basic fac
tor in the girl's clothes-life .... the
time element. The tricky little deals
they try to palm off on us, arc simply
not designed to be donned in the ten
minutes' grace allowed before the 8
o'clock dash.
For the same reason, the wash
afc|es and often-need-to-be-cleaned's
fare badly. The College Girl likes
to be washed, but she doesn't want
to fuss with terrific laundry bills or
cleaner's delays if she can possibly
help it.
Then there's the comfort angle.
Flats for walking, non-wrinkle-ables
(nobody likes to look as tho she'd
slept in her clothes, even if she has)
warmth without too much weight
(a binder is heavy enough). All
these enter in.
SHE'S PRACTICAL
Cockcyed gadgets and fads offer
amusement and diversions — but
cold-eyed practicality is the basis
for every college fashion. Even pig
tails are practical because they offer
an easy way to keep your hair with
out benefit of hairdresser or bobby
pins.
Fashion is spinach — something
you've got to take whether you like
it. or not—according to Elizabeth
Hawes. But somebody has gotten
back at the people who've been
choking us on spinach for so many
years. The College Girl is handing
the spinach back to the Fashion ex
perts, and they're eating it.
But they don't like it.
There's something wrong with the
system. No matter how hard they
try, and Heaven knows they try, the
college girl and the fashion editor
can't seem to get together.
"The college girl will plug such
and such this year," state the People-
Who-Know firmly each fall.
But somehow, a note of pleading
creeps into the statement.
"How very interesting," comments
the College Girl vaguely, and wan
ders off on some new fashion tang
ent, oblivious to the agony she has
left behind her.
ISSUE EDICT
From time to time, the harried
ladies who put out the monthly
treatises on clothes, issue an edict.
Two years ago, they put forth the
dogmatic statement that diagonal
plaids were in.
Last year at this time they had the
pencil skirt, for both street and eve
ning wear, on their minds. The Col
lege Girl sniffed the plaids tenta
tively for a year, checked the breadth
of her beam, and came around
grudgingly about a year and a half
later, if she thought she was slim
enough.
