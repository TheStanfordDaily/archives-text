### AMIE REICHERT 
YESTERDAY a significant word
was stricken from the CIO vo
cabulary. The word was "mediation"
and it used to mean just that. But
to maverick CIO President Philip
Murray it obviously means appease
ment, or else.
The resignation of the two CIO
representatives from the National
Mediation Hoard after (he Board's
decision against the union in the
Captive coal mine controversy in
dicates quite plainly that the la
bor bosses have no use for talk
unless it is strictly in their lan
guage.
Murray declared quite frankly
that "the usefulness of the Board is
ended so far as I am concerned."
* * ♦
JT IS a pity that Lewis insisted so
violently upon making an issue of
this particular strike—a strike which
involves 10 per cent of the coal in
the U.S., yet only 5 per cent of the
workers in the Captive mines.
Clearly it is not worth making
all (his fuss and jeopardizing the
defense effort so long as 85 per
cent of the laborers are unionized
anyway, l»».i( Lewis is determined
to set a precedent, and the sorry
thing about the whole business is
\hat the U.S. government is prob
ably going to heat him to it and
set a very different sort of prece
dent.
Lewis will, in all probability, re
ject the decision of the Board —he
did not promise to abide by it al
though the steel companies did. In
that event, it is almost a certainty
that Congressional legislation against
strikes in defense industries will
follow quickly.
They tell us this country of ours
is still a democracy; that the ideals
of democracy are still worth fight
ing for—in fact, that is the very
reason for our vast defense effort.
But it is certainly a characteristic
of the totalitarian, not the democrat
ic, way of life that men should be
virtually forced to work, denied the
right to object to conditions which
they feel are unfair.
* *
yet it must be done, if we
are to win out in the end. While
there are obstructionists, opportu
nists, self-seeking egotists like John
L. Lewis, who pull the puppet strings
of organized labor, such precautions
must be taken—or the result will
surely be the defeat not only of all
of labor's gains in the past, but of
its hopes for the future.
No one would wish to see labor
sacrificed alone in (his time of
crisis. In all-out effort, in the ful
fillment of this country's new
Victory Program of production,
both capital and labor must make
sacrifices, .just as they are doing in
Britain today. Neither can be per
mitted to cling to the notion of
"business as usual" —or "strikes
as usual" in these crucial times.
Big business has made sacrifices—
involuntary sacrifices which have
been imposed by excessive govern
ment taxation, and, in rare cases,
voluntary sacrifices where business
men have converted their industries
from civilian to wartime needs.
♦ * *
B UT big business has not yet
made the sacrifice it will have
to make if we are to follow our
"blueprint for victory." It will have
to submit to price ceilings and wage
control legislation.
The same is true of the farmer.
Labor in the U.S. today has re
fused to make a single concession
or sacrifice to (he defense effort.
On the contrary, labor has treach
erously gone oul of its way to use
(he present emergency as the stra
tegic (ime to blackmail big busi
ness into granting its demands.
But labor will be forced to sacri
fice along with the rest of the Amer
ican people. It is already guaran
teed a minimum wage and extra
pay for overtime; it is hoped that it
will be guaranteed a stabilized
standard of living (if price and wage
control is ever finally enacted) but
it cannot be guaranteed the right to
call strikes in vital industries be
cause several hundred men have
not joined the union.

The resignation of the two CIO
representatives from the National
Mediation Hoard after (he Board's
decision against the union in the
Captive coal mine controversy in

JT IS a pity that Lewis insisted so
violently upon making an issue of
this particular strike—a strike which
involves 10 per cent of the coal in
the U.S., yet only 5 per cent of the
workers in the Captive mines.
Clearly it is not worth making
all (his fuss and jeopardizing the
defense effort so long as 85 per
cent of the laborers are unionized
anyway, l»».i( Lewis is determined
to set a precedent, and the sorry
thing about the whole business is
\hat the U.S. government is prob
ably going to heat him to it and
set a very different sort of prece
dent.
Lewis will, in all probability, re
ject the decision of the Board —he
did not promise to abide by it al
though the steel companies did. In
that event, it is almost a certainty
that Congressional legislation against
strikes in defense industries will
follow quickly.
They tell us this country of ours
is still a democracy; that the ideals
of democracy are still worth fight
ing for—in fact, that is the very
reason for our vast defense effort.
But it is certainly a characteristic
of the totalitarian, not the democrat
ic, way of life that men should be
virtually forced to work, denied the
right to object to conditions which
they feel are unfair.
