# Reds Push Back Nazis; C.I.O. Bolts Defense Board in Coal Dispute
## Lewis Reaction Awaited; A.F.L. Strike Halted 
### United Press 
The CYngress of Industrial Organi
zations threatened a critical breach
in defense labor relations Tuesday
night by bolting President Roose
velt's National Defense Mediation
Board in united protcs( against a
decision adverse to John L. Lewis'
United Mine Workers in (he captive
coal mine dispute. This may precipi
tate a resumption of the coal strike
Nov. 15.
This menacing development was in
dark contrast to the situation across
the continent at San Diego, Calif.,
where K. G. Bitter, secretary of the
A.F.L. Building Trades Council, in
structed 2,164 striking craftsmen to
return to work on eight, navy and
marine projects at noon Wednesday.
AN OPEN REVOLT'
The back-to-work orders averted,
at least for the time, use of emer
gency seizure powers by the navy
to suppress the strike, which naval
officers termed "an open revolt"
against the United States.
President Philip Murray of the
C.1.0. led the walkout of seven C.1.0.
members of the N.D.M.8.. and the
United Automobile Workers, a major
C.1.0. affiliate, promptly deferred
consideration of its disputes before
Mr. Roosevelt's emergency agency.
WHAT WILL lIE DO
Federal labor experts awaited
John L. Lewis' reaction to the De
fense Mediation Board's rejection of
closed shop demands for 53,000 C.1.0.
mine workers at captive coal fields
in the steel industry. Union sources
frankly expressed doubt that Lewis
would abide by the board's finding,
thereby precipitating a new peril
to vital steel production on Nov. 15,
his deadline for concession to union
demands.
