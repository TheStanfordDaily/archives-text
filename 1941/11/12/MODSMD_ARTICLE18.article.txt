WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 (UP).—
President Roosevelt told his fellow-
Americans today that the nation
owes a duty to the World War dead
and to itself to "make the world a
place where freedom can live and
grow into the ages."
He warned that the United States,
as in 1917, faces "a terrible danger"
—the loss of its liberty—but that
Americans agree "that liberty is
worth fighting for"—and, he added,
"if they are obliged to fight they will
fight eternally to hold it."
