# Excom Revises Co-op Society
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
News that $46 had been found
missing from Co-operative Book Ex
change Society funds precipitated a
total revision of the Co-op manage
ment last night by Executive Com
mittee.
This action was the result of two
weeks' investigation, following an
earlier secret meeting of Excom.
Society operation and funds will
henceforth be under strict control,
headed by a bonded manager, who
will be selected through the try
outee method. Purpose of the revi
sion is to put the responsibility on
one man, who will receive $10 a
month salary, it was explained by
Jim McKellar, student manager of
the A.S.S.U.
That the money was missing was
discovered by an authorized ac
countant, but investigation has failed
to solve the case. Under the new
system, the office, for which there
will be only one key, will be opened
and closed by the manager, books
will be subject to quarterly audit,
there will be quarterly inventory,
and funds will be kept in the A.S.-
S.U. safe. This will be incorporated
in the Co-op charter by Excom.
Other business follows:
DEFENSE COMMITTEE: Harry
Morgan was named to chairman the
student information service, which
will describe opportunities in de
fense work and the armed forces
open to college students.
LOST AND FOUND: The Admin
istration has agreed to re-adopt the
orphaned department, to be quar
tered in the Cashier's office, Ad
ministration Building.

faculty members will be conducted

News that $46 had been found
missing from Co-operative Book Ex
change Society funds precipitated a
total revision of the Co-op manage
ment last night by Executive Com
mittee.
This action was the result of two
weeks' investigation, following an
earlier secret meeting of Excom.
Society operation and funds will
henceforth be under strict control,
headed by a bonded manager, who
will be selected through the try
outee method. Purpose of the revi

one man, who will receive $10 a
month salary, it was explained by

will be only one key, will be opened
and closed by the manager, books
