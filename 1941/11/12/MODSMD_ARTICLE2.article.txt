McDonald, Sylvia Barry and Mary
Jean Haynes.
A short dance on the order of an
informal jolly-up will conclude the
evening's festivities. Arrangements
for it have been under the direction
of Bill Moran.
IDEA FROM CAL
"The University of California ori
ginated the idea of the sing and its
success on the Berkeley campus will
only be topped by the Stanford ver
sion tonight," states Co-chairman
Ethel Hoover. It is being especially
conducted to give the Class of '42 a
chance to become acquainted be
fore the hectic rush of Senior Week
activities in June.
The program is designed for and
by seniors only. It is their first big
social gathering of the year. All at
tending will be charged a dime to
cover the cost of cokes and cigarettes
which will be passed out during the
evening.
