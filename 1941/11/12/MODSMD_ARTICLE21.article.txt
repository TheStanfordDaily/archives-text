# Russ Attacks Gain Positions Near Moscow
## 
### United Press 
Fierce Russian attacks were re
ported Tuesday to have won new
strong positions from the Germans
northwest of Rostov and to have in
flicted heavy losses in men and ma
terials on the Nazis near Tula and
Volokolamsk south and west of
Moscow.
The Russians claimed (he situation
was improving on all fronts, includ
ing the Crimea, where Red bombers
were said to have destroyed several
German concentrations.
Scanty German reports claimed
further advances against Sevastopol
and Kerch in the Crimea and spoke
of Russian prisoners taken on the
Moscow sector but gava little real
information.
ITALY LOSES 10 SHIPS
Britain's relentless war in the
Mediterranean on Axis shipping to
North Africa has sunk or crippled
10 more ships, the Admiralty an
nounced, running to 19 the number
of enemy ships destroyed since last
Saturday. These included three Ital
ian destroyers and 16 troop or supply
ships, reportedly carrying thousands
of German and Italian troops.
Nothing but relatively minor
clashes were reported from the east
ern front by either side—perhaps in
dicating that bitter winter weather
already is making impossible large
scale campaigning.
WHAT THEY CLAIM:
1. The Moscow radio said Soviet
bombers in the Crimea destroyed a
regiment (3,000 men) of motorized
infantry, 21 tanks and 80 cars. On
the nearby southern sector Soviet
troops reportedly killed 750 Italians
and captured 1,500 more, in addition
to throwing back German forces and
taking new defensive positions.
Near Tulft, 110 miles south of Mos
cow, the Russians were said to have
killed or captured 1.000 Nazi officers
and men and to have destroyed or
taken large quantities of war mate
rials in sharp fighting still under
way. Near Volokolamsk, 65 miles
northwest of Moscow, the Russians
increased pressure on a large group
of Germans reportedly encircled and
fighting desperately to escape.
NO NAZI BOASTS
2. The official DNB German news
agency said two Nazi divisions over
ran a sector of Moscow's defenses,
capturing 1,000 Russians and 80 guns,
but the high command spoke only of
German air activity on the Moscow
front. The high command claimed
further advances in the Crimea,
without giving any detail.
London professed to sec signs that
the Russians were slowly but stead
ily organizing great masses of men
and guns for what may be crucial
battles of the war. The Russian
problem, however, admittedlly is not
one of manpower but of importing
equipment from Britain and the
United States.

North Africa has sunk or crippled
10 more ships, the Admiralty an
nounced, running to 19 the number
of enemy ships destroyed since last
Saturday. These included three Ital
ian destroyers and 16 troop or supply
ships, reportedly carrying thousands
of German and Italian troops.
Nothing but relatively minor
clashes were reported from the east
ern front by either side—perhaps in
dicating that bitter winter weather
already is making impossible large
scale campaigning.
WHAT THEY CLAIM:
1. The Moscow radio said Soviet
bombers in the Crimea destroyed a
regiment (3,000 men) of motorized
infantry, 21 tanks and 80 cars. On
the nearby southern sector Soviet
troops reportedly killed 750 Italians
and captured 1,500 more, in addition
to throwing back German forces and
taking new defensive positions.
Near Tulft, 110 miles south of Mos
cow, the Russians were said to have
killed or captured 1.000 Nazi officers
and men and to have destroyed or
taken large quantities of war mate
rials in sharp fighting still under
way. Near Volokolamsk, 65 miles
northwest of Moscow, the Russians
increased pressure on a large group
of Germans reportedly encircled and
fighting desperately to escape.
NO NAZI BOASTS
2. The official DNB German news
agency said two Nazi divisions over
ran a sector of Moscow's defenses,
capturing 1,000 Russians and 80 guns,
but the high command spoke only of
German air activity on the Moscow
front. The high command claimed
further advances in the Crimea,
without giving any detail.
London professed to sec signs that
the Russians were slowly but stead
ily organizing great masses of men
and guns for what may be crucial
battles of the war. The Russian
problem, however, admittedlly is not
one of manpower but of importing
equipment from Britain and the
United States.
Fierce Russian attacks were re
ported Tuesday to have won new
strong positions from the Germans
northwest of Rostov and to have in
flicted heavy losses in men and ma
terials on the Nazis near Tula and
Volokolamsk south and west of
Moscow.
The Russians claimed (he situation
was improving on all fronts, includ
ing the Crimea, where Red bombers
were said to have destroyed several
German concentrations.
Scanty German reports claimed
further advances against Sevastopol
and Kerch in the Crimea and spoke
of Russian prisoners taken on the
Moscow sector but gava little real
information.
