# Russia Does Not Have Pure Communism, Says Tuesday Series Speaker
## 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
"It is a mistake to believe that
the government of today in Russia
is a case of pure Cojnmunigm," said
William Henry Chamberlin, lecturer,
author, and former Russian corre
spondent for the Christian Science
Monitor, when he spoke before a
capacity Tuesday Series audience in
the Memorial Auditorium last night
on "Russia, the Far East and the
War."
"The original feature of the Bol
shevik revolution has not been car
ried out, though there is no question
that religion, private property, and
the institution of the family were
destroyed by the revolution. To be a
minister or priest is to be in one of
the most dangerous occupations in
Russia today, with the threat of a
concentration camp forever immi
nent."
LENIN COMMENT
He illustrated the aims of the Rus
sian government by quoting a com
ment made by Lenin, "The Commu
nist party should be in power—all
other parties should be in jail.*
In speaking of the Russian policy
of aloofness from the European fra
cas in 1939, Chamberlin said, "Stalin
wished to step in and liquidate the
ruins of European civilization with
the Red army. He underestimated
German striking power and overesti
mated the French power of resist
ance. As a result, when, on June
22, attacked Russia, Stalin
faced Hitler alone."
Loyalty for the fatherland has
been built up in the younger gen
eration to a strong degree. One
young Russian was quoted as say
ing, in protestation of the necessity
of studying a foreign language, "Ev
erything that needs to be known, is
known in Russia."
HITLER'S INTEREST
Chamberlin stated that he be
lieves that Hitler's main interest lies
toward the east of Europe rather
than to the west or overseas. Since
Germany is strongest in land and
air power her greatest triumphs
can be reached on land. Hitler needs
a navy ten or 20 times stronger than
her present-day fleet to conquer
overseas. To build it up would take
a matter of years, even decades.
There are two risks in helping
Russia, according to Chamberlin.
One, Stalin may win the war and
overrun Europe with a resulting sit
uation similar to the present state of
affairs; two, the Soviet may collapse
and materials sent to Russia by the
U.S. be taken by the Germans.
Three reasons advanced for Japan
not attacking Russia were: the Nip
ponese are bogged down in China,
they are impressed by the Soviet re
sistance of Germany, and they are
further impressed by the firmer pol
icy of the U.S.
Mr. Chamberlin ended his talk in
saying that the ultimate hope of the
Russians in the maze of contem
porary world problems is that
"eventually there will be a free Rus
sia in a free Europe."

He illustrated the aims of the Rus
sian government by quoting a com
ment made by Lenin, "The Commu
nist party should be in power—all
other parties should be in jail.*
In speaking of the Russian policy
of aloofness from the European fra
cas in 1939, Chamberlin said, "Stalin
wished to step in and liquidate the
ruins of European civilization with
the Red army. He underestimated
German striking power and overesti
mated the French power of resist
ance. As a result, when, on June
22, attacked Russia, Stalin
faced Hitler alone."
Loyalty for the fatherland has
been built up in the younger gen
eration to a strong degree. One
young Russian was quoted as say
ing, in protestation of the necessity
of studying a foreign language, "Ev
erything that needs to be known, is
known in Russia."
HITLER'S INTEREST
Chamberlin stated that he be
lieves that Hitler's main interest lies
toward the east of Europe rather
than to the west or overseas. Since
Germany is strongest in land and
air power her greatest triumphs
can be reached on land. Hitler needs
a navy ten or 20 times stronger than
her present-day fleet to conquer
overseas. To build it up would take
a matter of years, even decades.
There are two risks in helping
Russia, according to Chamberlin.
One, Stalin may win the war and
overrun Europe with a resulting sit
uation similar to the present state of
affairs; two, the Soviet may collapse
and materials sent to Russia by the
U.S. be taken by the Germans.
Three reasons advanced for Japan
not attacking Russia were: the Nip
ponese are bogged down in China,
they are impressed by the Soviet re
sistance of Germany, and they are
further impressed by the firmer pol
icy of the U.S.
Mr. Chamberlin ended his talk in
saying that the ultimate hope of the
Russians in the maze of contem
porary world problems is that
"eventually there will be a free Rus
sia in a free Europe."
"It is a mistake to believe that
the government of today in Russia
is a case of pure Cojnmunigm," said
William Henry Chamberlin, lecturer,
author, and former Russian corre
spondent for the Christian Science
Monitor, when he spoke before a
capacity Tuesday Series audience in
the Memorial Auditorium last night
on "Russia, the Far East and the
War."
"The original feature of the Bol
shevik revolution has not been car
ried out, though there is no question
that religion, private property, and
the institution of the family were
destroyed by the revolution. To be a
minister or priest is to be in one of
the most dangerous occupations in
Russia today, with the threat of a
concentration camp forever immi
nent."
