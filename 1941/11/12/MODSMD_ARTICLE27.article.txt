# Service Men Entertained Farm Style
## 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
Thirty soldiers, draftees, waited
impatiently at the main gate to Mof
fett Field. Only a little late for the
appointment were their escorts —
thirty Stanford Tri-Delts.
The women brought the guests
back to their house where the cor
porals, sergeants and privates were
treated to dinner and an evening of
dancing and singing, and then drove
the soldiers back to Moffett Field in
time to make 10:30 lockouts.
Service men from Texas and Cali
fornia predominated in the group,
which had several good entertainers
in it. The Tri-Delts found the sol
diers to be up on all the popular
songs and to be extremely versatile
ping-pong players.
MAI) GOOD TIME
Judging from the "thank-you" let
ters written on the Moffett Field sta
tionery, the first venture at helping
to entertain the army was a great
success. All of the soldiers reported
having one of the best times since
they started their service.
The success of the Tri-Delt service
party has inspired other Stanford
living groups to plan parties for the
men. Several of the Lagunita casas
have entertained them, and Haw
thorne will sponsor a party next
Sunday evening. Informal Quad
clothes are worn, the army wearing
its regular dress uniform.
HEADS PARTIES
Mrs. Samuel B. Morris, wife of
Dean Morris, selective service ad
ministrator for this area, is in charge
of the parties given at Stanford. She
is a member of the United Service
Organization.
Men invited to the entertainments
are selected by the commanding offi
cer at Moffett, and no discrimination
is made as to the soldier's rank. One
of the Stanford guests said that he
had been on K.P. (kitchen police)
duty for the past week, and, as such,
would have to pass up the sweet
potatoes which were on the menu.
And now the fraternities are just
waiting till the order comes through
drafting the women.

the soldiers back to Moffett Field in
time to make 10:30 lockouts.
Service men from Texas and Cali
fornia predominated in the group,
which had several good entertainers
in it. The Tri-Delts found the sol
diers to be up on all the popular
songs and to be extremely versatile
ping-pong players.
MAI) GOOD TIME
Judging from the "thank-you" let
ters written on the Moffett Field sta
tionery, the first venture at helping
to entertain the army was a great
success. All of the soldiers reported
having one of the best times since
they started their service.
The success of the Tri-Delt service
party has inspired other Stanford
living groups to plan parties for the
men. Several of the Lagunita casas
have entertained them, and Haw
thorne will sponsor a party next
Sunday evening. Informal Quad
clothes are worn, the army wearing
its regular dress uniform.
HEADS PARTIES
Mrs. Samuel B. Morris, wife of
Dean Morris, selective service ad
ministrator for this area, is in charge
of the parties given at Stanford. She
is a member of the United Service
Organization.
Men invited to the entertainments
are selected by the commanding offi
cer at Moffett, and no discrimination
is made as to the soldier's rank. One
of the Stanford guests said that he
had been on K.P. (kitchen police)
duty for the past week, and, as such,
would have to pass up the sweet
potatoes which were on the menu.
And now the fraternities are just
waiting till the order comes through
drafting the women.
Thirty soldiers, draftees, waited
impatiently at the main gate to Mof
fett Field. Only a little late for the
appointment were their escorts —
thirty Stanford Tri-Delts.
The women brought the guests
back to their house where the cor
porals, sergeants and privates were
treated to dinner and an evening of
dancing and singing, and then drove
the soldiers back to Moffett Field in
time to make 10:30 lockouts.
Service men from Texas and Cali
