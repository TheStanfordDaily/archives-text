How to be a successful juvenile
writer was described to the Stan
ford Writers" Club at their regular
meeting yesterday by Howard Pease,
'24, well-known writer of boys' sea
stories.
Before coming to Stanford, Pease
went to sea aboard a tramp steamer,
as a wiper in the engine room, in
search of material. This was in the
days before seamen's unions, and
"hell ships" were common, accord
ing to Pease.
"The men on shipboard today are
softies. We never got good food, very
often the leftovers from the officers'
table. There was never enough ven
tilation in the forecastle."
Pease first became interested in
writing before he came to Stanford.
His first story was written in col
laboration with Doris Knight, who
later became famous as a writer of
"pulp" love stories.
Pease showed the club several
maps and diaries he has collected to
document his books. He is the au
thor of "The Jinx Ship," "The Ship
Without a Crew," and other sea sto
ries for boys.
