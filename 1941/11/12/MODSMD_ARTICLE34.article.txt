# Knickerbocker Show Written By Ex-Student
## Maxwell Anderson's First Musical Tells Of Peter Stuyvesant 
### 
"Knickerbocker Holiday," to open
in Memorial Hall tomorrow night,
was written by a Stanford man, one
of the Farm's most illustrious alumni
and one of America's foremost play
wrights, Maxwell Anderson, Here
as a graduate student, Anderson re
ceived his M.A. in 19.14, and later
served on the English faculty.
The first of Anderson's successes
was "What Price Glory?" written in
collaboration with Lawrence Stal
lings. Since then, there has seldom
been a year in which his work has
not been on Broadway. "Saturday's
Children" won the Pulitzer Prize;
"Elizabeth and Essex" and "Mary of
Scotland" were successful treatments
of serious historical themes. On
more contemporary themes, but in
different forms each time, Anderson
lias written "Winter-set," "High Tor,"
and "Star Wagon."
FIRST MUSICAL
"Knickerbocker Holiday" is An
derson's first attempt at musical
comedy. Borrowing the story of Pe
ter Stuyvesant from Washington
Irving, he has built a romantic com
edy of political satire, which pos
sibly has more to do with present
day politics than those of Old New
Amsterdam. Kurt Weil supplied the
music, and, to quote F. Cowles
Strickland, director of the Stanford
Players' production, "the result is a
comedy both 'good and amusing,'
which was what Washington Irving
says all writing should be."
In "Knickerbocker Holiday," Max
well Anderson (whose first name is
James) is expressing through his
characters his reason for favoring
democracy.
DEFINES DEMOCRACY
Governor Stuyvesant, his would
be dictator, defines government as
"an organization in a limited area
selling protection at monopolistic
prices." Brom Broek, his hero, likes
democracy "because it's so inefficient
that people can have a little fun,"
and he denounces totalitarianism as
being too efficient in graft, corrup
tion, and crime, as well as in govern
ment.
"Knickerbocker Holiday," a hit on
Broadway, is being presented by the
Stanford Players Nov. 13, 14, and 15,
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
nights. Tickets are still available in
Room 202 in Memorial Hall. All
seats are reserved. The price is 83
cents, tax included.
