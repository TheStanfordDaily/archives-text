# Red Machine Warms Up For Cougars
## 
### 
Washington St;it<* fukus football
seriously and no one is going to
fool with the Cougars after they
walloped Oregon State and Oregon
on successive Saturdays, holding
both of those fine teams scoieless.
This is the assumption that Stan
ford is working on this week in prac
tice for the Cougar game Saturday.
The Indians worked hard yesterday
afternoon on a cold, damp field.
The way the Cougars have devel
oped after losing their three best
fullbacks early in the season is re
markable. Right now they are prob
ably the hottest team in the league

Eric "Hoot" Armstrong, No. 1
right halfback, sprained an ankle
late yesterday afternoon at prac
tice while the teams were running
through defensive plays. Dr. Blake
C. Wilbur, attending physician,
slated that the injury is not se
rious, and that Armstrong should
he on it again in "just a day or
two."

with the possible exception of Stan
ford. Shaughnessy said Monday that
the Indians will have to score 27
points to beat the Cougars.
The fact that Washington State
takes football seriously is evidenced
by the fact that the frosh team at
Pullman has five coaches, including
Stan Johnson, All-Coast tackle last
year, and Les McLennan, a fullback
declared ineligible this year.
With a well-known backfield and
a set of terrific ends, the Cougar line
is often overlooked. Buck Bailey,
once one of the greatest tackles in
the country when he played for the
Olympic Club, turns out good lines
consistently, and some of the ex-
Cougar giants include Mel Hein,
Turk Edwards, George Theodoratus,
and Kenny Devine. This boy Stan
Doepke is a fine guard, Jim Woody
plays a mean game at tackle, and
any line that can control the plung
ing of O.S.C.'s Shelton is good.
Speaking of lines, Stanford's coach
had high praise Monday for Ed
Stamm, who has played almost 60
minutes at the toughest position on
a football team, left tackle.
