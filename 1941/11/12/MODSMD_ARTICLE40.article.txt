A PRIVATE note to the western team in the Rose Bowl next January 1,
whoever it might be: What's the matter with Duke? Those "in the
know" immediately say, "Look at the pipe teams they play every Saturday."
However, I, too, consider myself "in the know," and I don't consider
Pittsburg, Tennessee, Colgate, North Carolina, Georgia Tech, and Wake
Forrest as pipes. It is true that they play Maryland and Davidson, not
' the two most powerful teams in the country, but those teams are confer
j ence rivals, and even the high and mighty Pacific Coast and Big Ten
leagues have had trouble with weak sister teams.
The Blue Devils have not been near defeat so far this season, and if
they get by North Carolina and North Carolina State, they will be one of
the few undefeated and untied outfits left in the country when hostilities
are at an end in December.

d OBSERVATIONS while sitting in the press box (said he in an egotistical
manner): During the Santa Clara game Phil Bengtson and Marchie
Schwartz sat in the glassed-in booth taking in at least five times as much
as the average fan would.. .also, they are hereby nominated as the two
smoothest looking assistant football coaches extant.. .slight squabble be
tween Harry Borba, former Farmite, now of a local Hearstsheet, and Ted
Schroeder, former ballboy, now of tennis fame...Harry indicated that Ted
made a better door than he did a window, although he didn't put it in
those exact words, and Ted indicated that he didn't need to shout about it.

W/HERE are so many of those tremendous pre-season all-Americans that
" were picked in August and September? Bruce Smith and Urban
Odson of Minnesota aren't even in the starting line-ups. Same goes for
Harvey McCollum, Tulane tackle. Pete Layden is playing second fiddle
I to Jack Crain for the U. of T. Longhorns.
Frankie Albert, a quarterback on Stanford's football team out on the
West Coast, is still playing pretty fair ball, though.

4 NOTHER plug for the Dukes: They feature two of 4 he most colorful
backs in the country, Moffat Storer and Steve Lach. T ch does every
thing and he does it well. He's a big boy too, over 200 lbs. Storer ran the
100-yard dash in 9.6 last spring. He runs well in a football suit t00...
| speaking of colorful backs, have you ever heard of Bill Dudley or Owen
Price. Dudley goes to Maryland and was the nation's leading scorer last
year. This season he has piled up a total offense record that is making
Tom Harmon look like the third-string guard on the Blackwell's Corner
High School team after Atherton went through. Price comes from Texas
Tech, or some place in that vicinity. He, after leading the nation's punters
last season, is leading in both punting and passing this year. We want them
i on our side.
