# Delta Kappa Epsilon Downs Hard-Fighting Encina 4W, 12-7
## 
### 
Delta Kappa Lpsilon's intramural football game is still in the r'i*»«in w
'or the frown iu intramural grid race, but c:nly because Jim Pollard
is u little more elongated than seven lighting freshmen from Encina 4W
The Dekes moved into the semi-finals of the circuit when they topned
the freslimeii 12 to 7 in their playoff tilt yesterday. The pass combination

of "Killer" Clark to lanky Pollard
got the Dekes off to a fine start with |
a touchdown pass in the first half.
Then for two quarters they got no- |
where against Chuck Hopper's squad
as Hopper started some passing on j
his own hook and collected six points j
on a pass to Irv Beckman.
With one minute left the frosh
were still holding the Dekes, when
the Dekes Pollardized the opposition
| by throwing a pass about two feet
! too high for any ordinary person, to
I him over the goal. Pollard stretched,
! engulfed, relaxed, and the Dekes
I were in possession of the winning
i score.

I
Alpha Delt vs. Kappa Sigma at
4:15 today on the intramural field.

Next on their list will be the 1
| Firehouse, the winner moving into
the championship clash.
ALPHA DELT WINS
In the other game, Alpha Delt
knocked the Cuadro septet out of
j the picture by a 9 to 0 victory. A
safety added the first two points to
the Alpha Delt total when Dave
Johnson spilled a Cuadro back be
hind his goal. Then Pete Gadd col
lected a pass and ran for another six
i points, followed by Dee Rowe's con
| version boot which ended the scor
ing.
The black hue of an eight-ball
(slightly beclouds the Alpha Delt
j status. All they have to do to get
into the finals is to beat the Kappa
Sigs. It still looks like a duel be
tween Monte Pfyl and Frank Wells
in the finals.
Stan Owen and Thor Peterson i
have been named referees for the
final game.
