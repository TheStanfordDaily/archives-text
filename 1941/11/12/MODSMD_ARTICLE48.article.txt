# After the War--- Not This Time, Mars
## 
### 
WHAT slake does the Uniled States have in
the peace that v/ill follow the war?
When this war is over, our world will be in
the worst mess it's known since the descent
of the barbarians. The difference will be that
every civilized person in the world will be
affected, not just a small section of one conti
nent.
And to straighten out this mess is going to be
the toughest problem ever to confront the lead
ers and diplomats of nations. They will not be
able to wrestle with it for a while over a con
ference table, draw up a pact, and go home to
start the whole senseless cycle over again.
Peace.
What is it?
Periods to which we have tacked the fateful
epithet, "peacetime," have always turned out to
be merely intermissions for Mars. The God of
War pulls the silver lining over our eyes for a
few years.
This is what the peacemakers have to face.
Some form of democracy seems to be the
type of government best adapted to working
with peace. Totalitarianism implies continual
expansion—war.

Then grant a win by the Anglo-American
alliance. It is natural to feel that a revitaliza
tion of democracy (with liberty and equality as
attendant corollaries) will be the theme of
world reorganization.
The United States, leader in democracy,
should have a good bit to say in determining
the roads a war-exhausted world should follow
in its stumbling, its blind groping for some
thing it has never really known—peace.

The integration and inter-dependence of na
tions has progressed a long way in the last 20
years. No longer can nations ignore one another.
.In the light of this change, our ultimate goal
must be a world federation based on demo
cratic ideals. Each of our present national en
tities must sacrifice its power to deal with in
ternational problems. Must sacrifice it to an all
embracing world state. Just like our 48 states
sacrifice their power to deal with interstate
problems.
Idealistic, you say.
Yes. But the only way.

Such an organization cannot spring full
blown from the peace conference following this
war. It must come by evolution. The treaty
must provide for its eventual achievement, for
adjustments to promote it. It cannot come by
revolution—a few men setting it up around a
conference table, a few men driven by a mush
room-like hatred, nurtured into blossom by
wartime propaganda.
This is the ultimate goal.
Before this goal can be attained there must
be a period, maybe many years, of transition,
of preparation. During these years the ultimate
goal must not be forgotten.
The biggest stake of the United States will
not be in "the peace that will follow the war,"
but in the transition period which must come be
fore that peace.

13y swinging Iho total of its mighty weight
behind such a program, as completely as it has
swung into the total defense program, by lead
ing the way for the world—only thus can the
United States jerk the nationalistic props from
under a selfish world and get it started on the
road toward real peace.
