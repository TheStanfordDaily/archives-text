7V T THE beginning of his fourth year, the
Ix Stanford student finds himself dwelling, in
retrospect, on the close class associations of his
early, first college days. The three years have
gone by —quickly. And the last one proceeds
apace. The retrospections were vague and they
are forgotten.
Senior Week. Suddenly the class is doing
just so many things together in one short week
and everybody is realizing how much they've
missed this activity as a class. In one short
week much of the solidarity which started in
Roble and Encina Halls four years back is re
vived. Comparatively, it's only an apertif. But
it's too late then, and before they know it they've
filed by Dr. Wilbur in the Amphitheater and
it's all over.
Tonight the Class of '42 is sponsoring a senior
sing and it's only November.
Not June, but November.
It's in Toyon.
It starts at 7:4s.—Rosemaric Mullany
