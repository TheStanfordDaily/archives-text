# Record Breakers
## 
### 
THE campus opened its heart and its pockets
to the Red Cross during the past week's
drive for funds to the record-breaking extent of
Sl2BO, which bested the goal of SI 150 and also
surpassed last year's total by $270.
Overwhelming success of the appeal is due
to the generous work of over 100 committee
members, whose dedication to this compassion
ate cause made the 1941 drive what is it today.
Space prohibits us from printing their names by
way of thanks and recognition for a job well
done. But the record is particularly due to the
energetic leadership of General Chairman Bess
Paulson and her committee chairmen.
The unselfish work of these people and the
many other canvassers deserves high praise.â€”
