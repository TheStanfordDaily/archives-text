### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
\ SMALL STORY
was the intellectual type. She was the kind of
girl that had a favorite century and could give
you a bunch of reasons why she liked that particular
century more than any other. She was the kind of a
girl that liked to talk about symphonies, about Mozart
and Shubert and Brahms. She liked to compare her
ideas about music with other people. She was the kind
of a girl who liked literature. She liked to discuss
writers, and what they had done. She was the kind of
a girl that was interested in politics. She liked to sit
and discuss Hitler's moves, and why Japan was doing
this or that and the reason why the Senate was acting
so busy. She was the kind of girl who went to all
the plays that came to town. She liked to sit and talk
about actors and characters in different plays. She
was the kind of girl who liked to sit in bars, and drink
scotch-and sodas and smoke cigarettes and talk about
all these important things.

seemed to like all these things, but for some rea
k son, I always had the impression that she really
didn t. She looked too affected, too bored, too conscious
of every little action she made. It looked like she
was always acting. It seemed to me that she talked
and liked and associated herself with all these things,
not for the pleasure she received from them, but for
the impression it made on those around. Her real pleas
ure came not from these things themselves, but from
the thought that she was impressive. She was very
concerned with what people thought of her.
And she fitted in well with a number of students,
for there were always a number around who liked
these things and they were amazed to see this young
girl who was so well versed in so many difTerent fields.
But most of her friends were not freshmen as she was,
but were seniors. She liked this because it made her
feel older, more mature than the other kids in her
class. She liked the idea of going out wilh the men
who knew all the best places and knew the names of
drinks she had never heard of and could call most of
Ihe bartenders by their first names. She liked this, not
particularly because she enjoyed the company of these
men, but because she felt she was being impressive,
and that she was showing herself to be apart and above
the other girls in Roble.

SHE drifted into this group of older, more expe
k rienced, intellectual and pseudo-intellectual crowd.
And in going with those men, she tried to do tho
things that they wanted to do, so that they wouldn't
think she was young or naive or a girl with a bunch
of silly ideas. For they always talked about such
things, and laughed about them, and when they laughed
she laughed and the ideals really seemed silly to her.
And so when they put their arms around her, she
would act like nothing was wrong, and when they
would kiss her, she would act like it was the natural
thing to do with everyone she went out with, and
when they all decided to go to a cabin party in the
mountains, she laughed and said of course, because
she was always conscious of what people thought and
she didn't want to seem young, and loved to be so
phisticated.
And one day she left school and never returned,
and no one knew what had happened until it said in
the paper that she had died from an appendicitis
operation.

would act like nothing was wrong, and when they
would kiss her, she would act like it was the natural
thing to do with everyone she went out with, and
when they all decided to go to a cabin party in the
mountains, she laughed and said of course, because
she was always conscious of what people thought and
she didn't want to seem young, and loved to be so
phisticated.
And one day she left school and never returned,
and no one knew what had happened until it said in
the paper that she had died from an appendicitis
operation.
\ SMALL STORY
was the intellectual type. She was the kind of
girl that had a favorite century and could give
you a bunch of reasons why she liked that particular
century more than any other. She was the kind of a
girl that liked to talk about symphonies, about Mozart
and Shubert and Brahms. She liked to compare her
ideas about music with other people. She was the kind
of a girl who liked literature. She liked to discuss
writers, and what they had done. She was the kind of
a girl that was interested in politics. She liked to sit
and discuss Hitler's moves, and why Japan was doing
this or that and the reason why the Senate was acting
so busy. She was the kind of girl who went to all
the plays that came to town. She liked to sit and talk
about actors and characters in different plays. She
was the kind of girl who liked to sit in bars, and drink
scotch-and sodas and smoke cigarettes and talk about
all these important things.

seemed to like all these things, but for some rea
k son, I always had the impression that she really
didn t. She looked too affected, too bored, too conscious
of every little action she made. It looked like she
was always acting. It seemed to me that she talked
and liked and associated herself with all these things,
not for the pleasure she received from them, but for
the impression it made on those around. Her real pleas
ure came not from these things themselves, but from
the thought that she was impressive. She was very
concerned with what people thought of her.
And she fitted in well with a number of students,
for there were always a number around who liked
these things and they were amazed to see this young
girl who was so well versed in so many difTerent fields.
But most of her friends were not freshmen as she was,
but were seniors. She liked this because it made her
feel older, more mature than the other kids in her
class. She liked the idea of going out wilh the men
who knew all the best places and knew the names of
drinks she had never heard of and could call most of
Ihe bartenders by their first names. She liked this, not
particularly because she enjoyed the company of these
men, but because she felt she was being impressive,
and that she was showing herself to be apart and above
the other girls in Roble.

SHE drifted into this group of older, more expe
k rienced, intellectual and pseudo-intellectual crowd.
And in going with those men, she tried to do tho
things that they wanted to do, so that they wouldn't
think she was young or naive or a girl with a bunch
of silly ideas. For they always talked about such
things, and laughed about them, and when they laughed
she laughed and the ideals really seemed silly to her.
