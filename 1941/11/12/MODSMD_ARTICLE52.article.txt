### 
PLEASE SIGN VOI R NAME

We have received a particularly interesting letter
which comments upon the column, "History, 1941,"
and which is signed, "Disgusted. '44," but unfortunately
are unable to run it because the writer neglected to
sign his name. It. is The Daily policy to run no let
ters in Campus Opinion unless they are signed by the
writer; however, the name will be omitted at the
author's request.
