# Subtle Humor Portrayed In 'Soap Behind the Ears'
## 
### 
SOAP It;;ilINI» THE CAKS, i>y Cornelia Otis Skinner, with drawings by
Alajalov. I ><xlrl Mead and Company.
'ihe latest collcction of wacky thought to come from the versatile M» : ss
Skinner is titled "Snap Behind the Ears" for no particular reason at }*31.
\ collcction of the author's riotous sketches for the "New Yorker," "New

York Times," and "The Theater
Arts Monthly," the book is the high
of the year in subtle humor.
With the range of a department
store, the book delves into every
subject that is possible for one to
imagine. Most of them are about the
author as she tries to cope with the
daily happenings that are so common
to us all, but which she turns into
side-splitting experiences.
PARODIES GOOD
One of the best chapters is one of
two parodies on current best-sellers.
This one is on Hemingway's "For
Whom the Bell Tolls," which is cut
down to "For Whom the Gong
Sounds" and is a magnificent take
off on Robert Jordan and his ar
mory in Spain.
Other items and situations taken
up by Miss Skinner range from how
to keep warm in a duck blind to di
rections on how to pick out chil
dren's clothing. Included are bits
of the summer theater, reducing, and
the defense of Long Island.
Stanford students will find a warm
spot in their hearts for Miss Skin
ner when they read that she prefers
acting in front of co-educational col
lege audiences. These audiences,
says she, are alert and discriminat
ing with just enough of the aca
demic that challenges an actor to do
her best.
NEW YORKISH STYLE
The stories are decidedly New
Yorkish, but are written with a
broader outlook than that possessed
by the average hide-bound Eastern
er. Miss Skinner is'fible to laugh at
all, and especially at her own home
town.
