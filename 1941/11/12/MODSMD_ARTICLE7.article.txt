# Injuns to Rally Outside Cellar
## Band to Head March Down Row to Union 
### 
Thursday night's rally for the
Washington State-Stanford football
game will not be held in thfe Pavil
ion. Such was the decision reached
last night by the Rally Committee.
New location for the rally will be
the corner of the Union Cellar. "This
isn't as fantastic as it sounds," re
ported Vernice Hines, co-chairman
for the affair.
"The balcony outside the A.S.S.U.
office will serve as our stage," she
added, "and the rail about it is so
low that everyone can sec without
trouble. If we keep cars out of the
Union parking area tomorrow night,
there will be plenty of space for
everyone."
IDEAL LOCATION
"This seems to be the ideal location
for a short, fun rally of this type.
We'd like all students to check up
on this location and sec if they don't
agree with us," she concluded.
In order not to interfere with dec
orators for the Sophomore Cotillion
in the Pavilion, the new site was
selected.
Not only will the site be new, but
a new method of gathering students
will be tried. Starting from the Fiji
house at 7:15, the band will march
down the Row picking up followers
as it goes until it reaches the Cellar
corner.
Originally, it was planned to send
part of the tend to other living
groups, but in the interest of music
this move was dropped. Residents
of Encina, Roble, Sequoia, Toyon,
Branner, and other residences off the
Row are asked to join the parade at
the Fiji house or any place along
the way.
TOPPINCi TO SPEAK
Featured speaker will be Keith
Topping, one of Stanford's greatest
ends and member of the 1935 "Vow
Boys" Rose Bowl champions. Men
tioned on many All-American teams,

the finest end game in Rose Bowl
history against Southern Methodist
in 193(5.

lisher in Hanford, will make the
200-mile trip for the sole purpose of
speaking at the rally.
Marchie Schwartz, assistant foot
ball coach, will also speak, and the
team, the band, and the yell leaders

Marchie Schwartz, assistant foot
ball coach, will also speak, and the
team, the band, and the yell leaders
will be on hand for the short rally.
Thursday night's rally for the
Washington State-Stanford football
game will not be held in thfe Pavil
ion. Such was the decision reached
last night by the Rally Committee.
New location for the rally will be
the corner of the Union Cellar. "This
isn't as fantastic as it sounds," re
ported Vernice Hines, co-chairman
for the affair.
"The balcony outside the A.S.S.U.
office will serve as our stage," she
added, "and the rail about it is so
low that everyone can sec without
trouble. If we keep cars out of the
Union parking area tomorrow night,
there will be plenty of space for
everyone."
IDEAL LOCATION
"This seems to be the ideal location
for a short, fun rally of this type.
We'd like all students to check up
on this location and sec if they don't
agree with us," she concluded.
In order not to interfere with dec
orators for the Sophomore Cotillion
in the Pavilion, the new site was
selected.
Not only will the site be new, but
a new method of gathering students
will be tried. Starting from the Fiji
house at 7:15, the band will march
down the Row picking up followers
as it goes until it reaches the Cellar
corner.
Originally, it was planned to send
part of the tend to other living
groups, but in the interest of music
this move was dropped. Residents
of Encina, Roble, Sequoia, Toyon,
Branner, and other residences off the
Row are asked to join the parade at
the Fiji house or any place along
the way.
