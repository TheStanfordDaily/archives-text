### AMIE REICHERT 
SOME guys are good guys, and
other guys won t support the
President's foreign policy.
Some guys arc really in favor of
the President's foreign policy, but
they won't vote for it because they
don't like his labor policy. (Neatest
non sequitur of the week.)
This last is a pretty sad com
mentary mi the mental caliber of
some of the guys the American
people elect to Congress.
Yesterday several members of the
House of Representatives had a
change of heart. They pulled a band
wagon onto the middle of the floor
of the House, and before the day's
debate was over, the bandwagon was
getting topheavy, people were piling
on so fast.

A, LL the shouting, wailing, tear
jerking, hair-pulling, back-bit
ing that ensued was the result of the
return of the neutrality revision
program to the Hquse in slightly
altered, one might say, improved
form.
The alteration, improvement,
what-have-you, provided that
armed merchantmen he permitted
to enter combat zones and bellig
erent ports. The Senate likes the
idea, passed the measure last Fri
day by a 50-157 vote. It is becom
ing increasingly apparent that the
House does not.
Six heretofore staunch support
ers of the President's foreign policy
decided yesterday that enough was
too much, and came out flatly op
posed to the additional measure.
And it looked as though yesterday
was change-of-heart time, for the
Administration supporters got pan
icky, the loyal opposition got cocky
and announced that it would have
weaned away 75 more loyal Demo
crats by the time voting was called
for.
Majority Leader Sam Rayburn,
no little alarmed as the President
faced his first possible defeat in
foreign policy, hopped a taxi to
the White House for a pep talk.
Things haven't been this hot for
the Administration since the draft
extension legislation squeaked
through last summer by a 203-202
vote.
Sit £ ±

six representatives declared
that their decision was based on
a belief that permitting armed mer
chantmen to enter combat zones
would plunge the U.S. into all-out
war.
Well, if they believe that, all right
and God bless them this is still a
free country.
But take the case of Representa
tive Howard W. Smith of Virginia.
Mr. Smith went to Washington a
stout supporter of the President's
foreign policy. A good man. Until
yesterday.
Yesterday was definitely not a
good day for Mr. Smith, in fact Mr.
Smith looked pretty poor yester
day. He was one of the six dis
senters, but he made a statement
that would lead one to believe he
didn't just change his mind over
the week-end; he lost it.
Mr. Smith said that he was voting
against this measure, suh, and he
would continue to vote against the
Administration until the President
decided to take a "firm stand on the
labor issue."
Mr. Smith is sulking in his pew
and he isn't going to budge an inch
in favor of anything or anybody
connected with the Administration
until F.D.R. goes into labor.

/ 1 RANTED that the labor situa- ;
' tion needs adjustment, it is also j
obvious that the foreign policy and j
the domestic policy involve sepa
rate legislation, separate issues, and \
separate thinking.
Mr. Smith is getting confused by |
all the excitement—and there is j
certainly plenty of it in Washing
ton today. Prospedts for the pass
age of the neutrality revisions are
paling in this new, unexpected
swing away from the Adminis
tration.
Should the program fail to be
passed in the House, it will inevi
tably return to the Senate for ad
justment. What will happen to it
there is almost unpredictable in the ;
light of today's development.

Yesterday several members of the
House of Representatives had a
change of heart. They pulled a band
wagon onto the middle of the floor
of the House, and before the day's
debate was over, the bandwagon was
getting topheavy, people were piling
on so fast.

A, LL the shouting, wailing, tear
jerking, hair-pulling, back-bit
ing that ensued was the result of the
return of the neutrality revision
program to the Hquse in slightly
altered, one might say, improved
form.
The alteration, improvement,
what-have-you, provided that
armed merchantmen he permitted
to enter combat zones and bellig
erent ports. The Senate likes the
idea, passed the measure last Fri
day by a 50-157 vote. It is becom
ing increasingly apparent that the
House does not.
Six heretofore staunch support
ers of the President's foreign policy
decided yesterday that enough was
too much, and came out flatly op
posed to the additional measure.
And it looked as though yesterday
was change-of-heart time, for the
Administration supporters got pan
icky, the loyal opposition got cocky
and announced that it would have
weaned away 75 more loyal Demo
crats by the time voting was called
for.
Majority Leader Sam Rayburn,
no little alarmed as the President
faced his first possible defeat in
foreign policy, hopped a taxi to
the White House for a pep talk.
Things haven't been this hot for
the Administration since the draft
extension legislation squeaked
through last summer by a 203-202
vote.
Sit £ ±

six representatives declared
that their decision was based on
a belief that permitting armed mer
chantmen to enter combat zones
would plunge the U.S. into all-out
war.
Well, if they believe that, all right
and God bless them this is still a
free country.
But take the case of Representa
tive Howard W. Smith of Virginia.
Mr. Smith went to Washington a
stout supporter of the President's
foreign policy. A good man. Until
yesterday.
Yesterday was definitely not a
good day for Mr. Smith, in fact Mr.
Smith looked pretty poor yester
day. He was one of the six dis
senters, but he made a statement
that would lead one to believe he
didn't just change his mind over
the week-end; he lost it.
Mr. Smith said that he was voting
against this measure, suh, and he
would continue to vote against the
Administration until the President
decided to take a "firm stand on the
labor issue."
Mr. Smith is sulking in his pew
and he isn't going to budge an inch
in favor of anything or anybody
connected with the Administration
until F.D.R. goes into labor.

/ 1 RANTED that the labor situa- ;
' tion needs adjustment, it is also j
obvious that the foreign policy and j
the domestic policy involve sepa
rate legislation, separate issues, and \
separate thinking.
Mr. Smith is getting confused by |
all the excitement—and there is j
certainly plenty of it in Washing
ton today. Prospedts for the pass
age of the neutrality revisions are
paling in this new, unexpected
swing away from the Adminis
tration.
Should the program fail to be
passed in the House, it will inevi
tably return to the Senate for ad
justment. What will happen to it
there is almost unpredictable in the ;
light of today's development.
SOME guys are good guys, and
other guys won t support the
President's foreign policy.
Some guys arc really in favor of
the President's foreign policy, but
they won't vote for it because they
don't like his labor policy. (Neatest
non sequitur of the week.)
This last is a pretty sad com

program to the Hquse in slightly
altered, one might say, improved
form.
The alteration, improvement,
what-have-you, provided that
armed merchantmen he permitted
to enter combat zones and bellig
erent ports. The Senate likes the
idea, passed the measure last Fri
day by a 50-157 vote. It is becom
ing increasingly apparent that the
House does not.
Six heretofore staunch support
ers of the President's foreign policy
decided yesterday that enough was
too much, and came out flatly op
posed to the additional measure.
And it looked as though yesterday
was change-of-heart time, for the
Administration supporters got pan
icky, the loyal opposition got cocky
and announced that it would have
weaned away 75 more loyal Demo
crats by the time voting was called
for.
Majority Leader Sam Rayburn,
no little alarmed as the President
faced his first possible defeat in
foreign policy, hopped a taxi to
the White House for a pep talk.
Things haven't been this hot for
the Administration since the draft
extension legislation squeaked
through last summer by a 203-202
vote.
Sit £ ±

six representatives declared
that their decision was based on
a belief that permitting armed mer
chantmen to enter combat zones
would plunge the U.S. into all-out
war.
Well, if they believe that, all right
and God bless them this is still a
free country.
But take the case of Representa
tive Howard W. Smith of Virginia.
Mr. Smith went to Washington a
stout supporter of the President's
foreign policy. A good man. Until
yesterday.
Yesterday was definitely not a
good day for Mr. Smith, in fact Mr.
Smith looked pretty poor yester
day. He was one of the six dis
senters, but he made a statement
that would lead one to believe he
didn't just change his mind over
the week-end; he lost it.
Mr. Smith said that he was voting
against this measure, suh, and he
would continue to vote against the
Administration until the President
decided to take a "firm stand on the
labor issue."
Mr. Smith is sulking in his pew
and he isn't going to budge an inch
in favor of anything or anybody
connected with the Administration
until F.D.R. goes into labor.

/ 1 RANTED that the labor situa- ;
' tion needs adjustment, it is also j
obvious that the foreign policy and j
the domestic policy involve sepa
rate legislation, separate issues, and \
separate thinking.
Mr. Smith is getting confused by |
all the excitement—and there is j
certainly plenty of it in Washing
ton today. Prospedts for the pass
age of the neutrality revisions are
paling in this new, unexpected
swing away from the Adminis
tration.
Should the program fail to be
passed in the House, it will inevi
tably return to the Senate for ad
justment. What will happen to it
there is almost unpredictable in the ;
light of today's development.
SOME guys are good guys, and
other guys won t support the
President's foreign policy.
Some guys arc really in favor of
the President's foreign policy, but
they won't vote for it because they
don't like his labor policy. (Neatest
non sequitur of the week.)
This last is a pretty sad com
mentary mi the mental caliber of
some of the guys the American
people elect to Congress.
Yesterday several members of the
House of Representatives had a
change of heart. They pulled a band
wagon onto the middle of the floor
of the House, and before the day's
debate was over, the bandwagon was
getting topheavy, people were piling
on so fast.

A, LL the shouting, wailing, tear
jerking, hair-pulling, back-bit
ing that ensued was the result of the
return of the neutrality revision
program to the Hquse in slightly
altered, one might say, improved
form.
