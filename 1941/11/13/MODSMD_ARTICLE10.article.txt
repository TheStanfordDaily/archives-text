# Japanese 'Hope' For Agreements
## 
### 
TOKYO, Wed., Nov. 13 (UP). â€”
Despite a new and violent press
campaign against the United States
and Britain, informed quarters said
today the government "still has
very great hopes" that a basis for a
Japanese - American understanding
can be reached during next week's
conversations in Washington between
Japan's special envoy, Saburo Ku
rusu, and the State Department.
The informants said "it may be
taken for granted" that Kurusu and
Ambassador Admiral Kichisaburo
Nomura will advance "extremely
reasonable" proposals.
Equally, it was said, this country
insists and will continue to insist
that it is capable of bringing the un
declared war with China to a suc
cessful conclusion if Britain and the
United States will abandon their
"interventionism."
