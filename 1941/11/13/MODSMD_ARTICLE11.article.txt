ABOARD THE ARGONAUT
BOUND FOR NEW ORLEANS (Ex
i elusive to The: Stanford Daily). —
This is the first day out, and every
| where I look in this Pullman I see
young faces. I am bunking in a car
| with about 15 draftees, part of a
i band of almost 100 who are en route
I to Kelly Field, Texas, and four years
in the Air Corps.
Most of them have been dragged
from colleges such as Stanford. I've
chatted with fellows from Occident
al, San Jose State, University of
California, Santa Ana J.C., and many
more schools. They are just like
Stanford students — except they
think differently regarding the pres
ent world crisis.
It's one thing to live in the secur
ity of the Farm's halls and houses
and discuss what our stand should
be regarding this war. And it's an
other thing to be bound for the air
! corps — and possible fighting in the
near future.
DRAFTEES POLLED
In that recent poll conducted by
The Daily, 37 per cent of you stu
dents voted for alternative No. 3.
j Using the same poll ballots (which
I I brought along on this trip for just

such a purpose), L!ve just finished
polling 20 of these 90 air corps draft
ees, and only 1, or 5 per cent,
checked No. 3, which read, "While
at first it looked as though this was
not our war, it now looks as though
we should back England until Hitler
is beaten."
Faced with actual fighting — and
the majority of those I have talked
with do feel that we are going in

very soon—these air corps men pre
ponderantly favor alternative No. 2,
which reads "A lot of mistakes have
brought us close to a war that isn't
ours, but now that it's done we
should support in full the govern
ment's program."
Fifty per ccnt of them voted that
way, an extremely high percentage
in view of the fact that 25 per cent
of the balloters marked their slip as
"Undecided,"
10 PER CENT ISOLATION
Rounding out. the poll, 10 per cent
voted that "Those who think this Is
our war are wrong, and that the
people of this country should resist
to the last ditch any move which
would lead u.s further toward war."
And 10 per cent voted that. "It is
our war as well as England's and
we should have been in there fight
ing with her before this."
What they want is not what these
draftees feel they are going to get.
Most of them firmly believe that
they see the handwriting on the wall
—and it isn't Mene Menc Tckel
Upharsin.
FORESEE FIGHTING
Most of them foresee actual fight
ing, either in Europe or Japan, in
the near future.
"I think it'll comc by April," com
mented one.
"Don't kid yourself; we are goin&
in damn soon," said another.
Such are the thoughts of the col
lege draftee as he moves closer to
four years in the Air Corps.
