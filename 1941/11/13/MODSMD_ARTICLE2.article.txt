# North Polar Maritime Air Settles On Farm---It's Fog
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Northern polar maritime air, a
cold frost type of occlusion, has fixed
itself firmly in the present great basin
meteorological region surrounding
the campus, and no relief is seen un
til southerly gradiant winds with
southern polar maritime air arrive
to push the situation back into
normal air channels.
In short, we are in a fog for a
while.
The Moffett Field weather station
reports that the heavy fog in the
Farm area is due to this northern
maritime air which has settled like a
wet sponge on Stanford.
As taffy on a thumb protects this
digit from feeling a licking tongue,
so the fog blanket is keeping normal

air currents from getting underneath
to dislodge it.
In about a week, however, the par
ticular southern wind necessary will
arrive at an altitude of 2000 feet.
It will get under the fog, just as a
knife will get under taffy, and the
fog will be shoveled out into normal
air channels.
When that time arrives, the Roble
girl who mistook the fireplug for
her Latin professor, and the Encina
boy who thought he was in love be
cause he couldn't see through any
thing, will be well again. People will
be able to sec who they arc walking
with to eight o'clock classes, old
friendships will be re-established,
and Farm students will be ready for
the fog of finals.
