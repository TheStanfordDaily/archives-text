# Ship-Arming Bill Faces House Defeat
## Congressmen Desert War-Zone' Proposal; Close Vote Predicted 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. VI (UP).—
House Democrats deserted Presi
dent Roosevelt's neutrality revision
program iu such alarming numbers
tonight that passage of the measure
was gravely imperiled.
The incipient revolt began explod
ing as the House opened eight hours
of debate on the Senate-approved
bill.
Defections resulted from the Ad
ministration's drive to send the
ships into war zones, rather than
from its attempt to arm them—a
move which already has been en
dorsed by the House.
Before debate on the Senate
amendments (to send ships into war
zones) was half over, six Demo
crats who previously had stood sol
idly behind Mr. Roosevelt on for
eign policies had bolted to the op
position. There were mounting in
dications that more would follow.
Panicky leaders, aware of the stag
gering foreign policy implications of
a defeat, struggled desperately to
stem the tide.
Democratic bolters included: Reps.
Howard W. Smith of Virginia, James
P. Richards of South Carolina,
Charles L. South of Texas, Harry P.
Beam of Illinois, Lansdale G. Sassger
of Maryland, and Walter A. Lynch
of New York.
