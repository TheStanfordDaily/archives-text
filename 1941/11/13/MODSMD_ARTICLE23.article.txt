# F.D.R. MOVES TO AVERT COAL MINE STRIKE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt today invited
steel exectuives and leaders of the
United States Mine Workers of
America to meet with him Friday
in an effort to avert a threatened
strike of 53,000 Capitve coal miners
this week-end.
He intervened personally in the
controversy, stemming from the Na
tional Defense Mediation Board's
rejection of the miners' demand for
a union ship, as growing ramifica
tion of the dispute imperiled the gov
ernment's entire machinery to set
tle defense labor quarrels through
conciliation.
Those asked to the conference
were John L. Lewis, president of
the mine union; Philip Murray, vice
president of the union and head of
the CIO; Thomas Kennedy, secre
tary-treasurer of the UMW; Eugene
G. Grace of Bethlehem Steel Corp.;
Benjamin F. Fairless, president of
U.S. Steel Corp.; and Frank Pumell
of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube
Corp.
