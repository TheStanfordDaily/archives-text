The German war machine has
been stopped everywhere on the
eastern front except in the Crimea,
although heavy fighting continues in
various "local" actions, front dis
patches indicated Wednesday.
Attacking German forces were
thrown back five miles from Tula,
110 miles south of Moscow, and were
repulsed with heavy losses at Kali -
nin, 95 miles north of the capital,
Soviet reports said. But in the Cri
mea the Germans claimed, without
Russian denial, to have reached the
eastern coast 20 miles from Kerch
and the narrow strait leading to the
Caucasus.
A German military spokesman
admitted that with the exception o(
the Crimea and another Russian at
tempt to break out of Leningrad, all
was comparatively quiet on other
I sections of the eastern front.
