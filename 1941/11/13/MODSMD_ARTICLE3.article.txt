# 'Knickerbocker' Cast Frolics At Dress Rehearsal Preview
## 
### TED NORTON 
With scenery moving on and off, impromptu chords from the two pianos,
and the usual screams, thumps and shouts for quiet, the final rehearsal for
"Knickerbocker Holiday" got under way last night. All this confusion
presaged the opening of the hit musical show tonight at 8:15 in Memorial
.Hall.

Maxwell Anderson, Stanford
alumnus and famed playwright,
wrote the script for "Knickerbocker
Holiday," making a crackling polit
ical satire out of Washington Irv
ing's old tale, and Kurt Wiel's lilt
ing tunes blend in to make a musical
comedy that deserved its long run
on Broadway.
POLITICAL ANGLE
The political angle of the play
comes in the conflict between the
hero, poor but honest Brom Broek,
who "can't take orders," and Gov
ernor Stuyvesant the villain, who
has a very modern New Order pre
pared for Nieuw Amsterdam. In
best musical-comedy fashion, how
ever, love and democracy triumph.
The show is laid in old Nieuw Am
sterdam in the 1600's. Around the
town square are the steep-roofed
Dutch houses, the stockade and gal
lows, and the wharves and ware
house, and in the background are
two towering windmills. The gal
lows are solidly constructed for
their important part in the dra
matic action. The second set is the
interior of the log jail, complete
with a hole in the wall; it is in
climbing through this that Tina, the
heroine, loses all six of her skirts.
LIVELY COSTUMES
The costumes of the women are in
lively tulip colors, appropriate to the
musical-comedy spirit, with wooden
shoes and white Dutch bonnets.
Governor Stuyvesant, with his sil
ver peg-leg, swaggers forth in the
costume of a 17th century cavalier,
while the Town Council wears
broad homespun breeches.
Tickets can still be obtained for all
three performances of "Knicker
bocker Holiday," in Room 2Q2, Me
morial Hall, or at the box office. The
show will run tonight, Friday, and
Saturday.

ing tunes blend in to make a musical
comedy that deserved its long run
on Broadway.
POLITICAL ANGLE
The political angle of the play
comes in the conflict between the
hero, poor but honest Brom Broek,
who "can't take orders," and Gov
ernor Stuyvesant the villain, who
has a very modern New Order pre
pared for Nieuw Amsterdam. In
best musical-comedy fashion, how
ever, love and democracy triumph.
The show is laid in old Nieuw Am
sterdam in the 1600's. Around the
town square are the steep-roofed
Dutch houses, the stockade and gal
lows, and the wharves and ware
house, and in the background are
two towering windmills. The gal
lows are solidly constructed for
their important part in the dra
matic action. The second set is the
interior of the log jail, complete
with a hole in the wall; it is in
climbing through this that Tina, the
heroine, loses all six of her skirts.
LIVELY COSTUMES
The costumes of the women are in
lively tulip colors, appropriate to the
musical-comedy spirit, with wooden
shoes and white Dutch bonnets.
Governor Stuyvesant, with his sil
ver peg-leg, swaggers forth in the
costume of a 17th century cavalier,
while the Town Council wears
broad homespun breeches.
Tickets can still be obtained for all
three performances of "Knicker
bocker Holiday," in Room 2Q2, Me
morial Hall, or at the box office. The
show will run tonight, Friday, and
Saturday.
With scenery moving on and off, impromptu chords from the two pianos,
and the usual screams, thumps and shouts for quiet, the final rehearsal for
"Knickerbocker Holiday" got under way last night. All this confusion
presaged the opening of the hit musical show tonight at 8:15 in Memorial
.Hall.

Maxwell Anderson, Stanford
alumnus and famed playwright,
wrote the script for "Knickerbocker
Holiday," making a crackling polit
ical satire out of Washington Irv
ing's old tale, and Kurt Wiel's lilt
ing tunes blend in to make a musical
comedy that deserved its long run
on Broadway.
