government, industry, collective ag
riculture, the significance of the
Moscow trials, and of Russia's new
foreign policy. He also made a study
of the outlook for war or peace in
the leading countries of Europe, and
was there at the outbreak of the
war.

the students of India. He was then
called to be Y.M.C.A. secretary for
Asia and for many years was en
gaged with Dr. John R. Mott in work
for students throughout that conti
nent.
In Berlin in 1933 he challenged
the Nazis for their treatment of the
Jews, liberals, and radicals and in
June, 1934, he saw Hitler and heard
him make his address to the Reich
stag.
