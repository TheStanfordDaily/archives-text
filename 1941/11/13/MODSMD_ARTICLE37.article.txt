# Cougars Worry Card Coach
## Indians Are Dull In Workouts; 'Hoot' Returns 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy isn't too
pleased with the prospects for this
week-end.
The Indian mentor not only has a
healthy respect for the explosive
Washington State Cougars but has
not had much reason to get excited
over his own team in practice this
week. For what is supposed to be
their peak week, the Indians haven't
loked too sharp the past couple of
sessions. It may be the cold, it may
be that some of the boys are a little
sick of the game.
This early-in-the-week pace seems
to be characteristic of the Cards,
though, and usually they pull out of
it on Thursday.
HOOT WILL TEST ANKLE
Hoot Armstrong will turn out to
night and test his ankle, which he
injured Tuesday night. Eric has
been the tough-luck kid this year,
with a series of injuries that have
kept him down a good part of the
time.
One of the most encouraging per
formances lately in practice has been
the showing of A1 Cole, who seems
to be fitting into the T nicely. He is
getting some helpful hints on how to
be a fine quarterback from frater
nity brother Frankie Albert. Li'l A1
hasn't had ample opportunity yet to
really show his stuff. If he does take
over the quarterback post when
Frankie leaves he will fit into the
recent trend toward tiny backs that
have been hogging headlines, not
ably Bud Higgins of Minnesota,
Navy's Clark, two players who are
smaller even than Cole.
PASSES FILL Alfi
Passes filled the air yesterday in
practice. There were some nice
catches by Stamm on a tackle-eligi
ble play and by Meiners over his
sholder on the dead run.
