# Burness, Cowden Captain '42 Squad
## 
### 
Don Burness and Bill Cowden, the
only returning first-stringers from
last year's title-holding Stanford
basketball team, yesterday were
elected to co-captain the Indian
quintet for the coming campaign.
And an unusual election it was,
too, with the only voters being Bur
ness and Cowden. And, since each
voted for the other, it was decided
that they will be co-captains.
As a rule the election is held at
the close of the preceding season,
but the procedure was changed this
year. This marks the third consecu
tive year that the Indians have been
headed by co-captains, Don Williams
and Ken Davidson having shared
the honors during each the 1939-40
and the 1940-41 seasons.
