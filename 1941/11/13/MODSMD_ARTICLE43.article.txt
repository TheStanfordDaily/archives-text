JVVER SINCE the gun ended the
| game up north Tuesday after
! noon, we've been trying to figure out
just what significance was attached
to the University oJJ Oregon's 21-19
i victory over Santa Clara.
And it seems to prove only that
! Alyn Heals. Santa Clara's great
left end, is the most consistent
, hero-in-defeat on the Coast. He
was good when the Broncs dropped
j one to Oklahoma; he was marvel
ous when he caught a touchdown
pass and generally performed like
! an all-something-or-other as the
Santa Clarans lost to Stanford; and
! he was sensational in catching two
touchdown passes while the
Broncos lost to the U. of O. Tues
day.
If he isn't one of the top wingmen
I out here in the wilds of the Pacific
Coast slope, something's out of
I kilter.
All of which reminds us that it
would be fun to pick a tentative
all-Coast team, one that can be re
vised after the season comes to a
close. So here it is:
Ends—Alyn Seals (SC) and Fred
Meyer (S).
Tackles—Boh Reinliard (Cal)
and Bruno Banducci (S).
Guards —Chuck Taylor (S) and
liay Frankowski (Wash.)
Center—Hick Greenough (OSC).
Backs—Frank Albert (S), Pete
Kmctovic (S), Curt Mecham
(Ore.), and Boh Robertson (USC).
There they are. Take 'em or leave
'em.
Just because there seem to be
some other outstanding backs on this
slope, we'll give you Johnny Podesta
of St. Mary's, Ernie Steele of Wash
ington, Jack McQuary of Cal, and
Bill Sewell of Washington State as
a second quartet.
To make this interesting, we here
with announce that this column will
conduct a poll for an all-Coast team.
Name two full teams, composed of
the boys in intercollegiate football
whom you think are tops, and send
your selections to Slants in care of
The Daily.
Selections must be in by Wednes
day of next week, and we will print
on Thursday the consensus all-Coast
eleven.

ous when he caught a touchdown
pass and generally performed like
! an all-something-or-other as the
Santa Clarans lost to Stanford; and
! he was sensational in catching two
touchdown passes while the
Broncos lost to the U. of O. Tues
day.
If he isn't one of the top wingmen
I out here in the wilds of the Pacific
Coast slope, something's out of
I kilter.
All of which reminds us that it
would be fun to pick a tentative
all-Coast team, one that can be re
vised after the season comes to a
close. So here it is:
Ends—Alyn Seals (SC) and Fred
Meyer (S).
Tackles—Boh Reinliard (Cal)
and Bruno Banducci (S).
Guards —Chuck Taylor (S) and
liay Frankowski (Wash.)
Center—Hick Greenough (OSC).
Backs—Frank Albert (S), Pete
Kmctovic (S), Curt Mecham
(Ore.), and Boh Robertson (USC).
There they are. Take 'em or leave
'em.
Just because there seem to be
some other outstanding backs on this
slope, we'll give you Johnny Podesta
of St. Mary's, Ernie Steele of Wash
ington, Jack McQuary of Cal, and
Bill Sewell of Washington State as
a second quartet.
To make this interesting, we here
with announce that this column will
conduct a poll for an all-Coast team.
Name two full teams, composed of
the boys in intercollegiate football
whom you think are tops, and send
your selections to Slants in care of
The Daily.
Selections must be in by Wednes
day of next week, and we will print
on Thursday the consensus all-Coast
eleven.
JVVER SINCE the gun ended the
| game up north Tuesday after
! noon, we've been trying to figure out
just what significance was attached
to the University oJJ Oregon's 21-19
i victory over Santa Clara.
And it seems to prove only that
! Alyn Heals. Santa Clara's great
left end, is the most consistent
, hero-in-defeat on the Coast. He
was good when the Broncs dropped
j one to Oklahoma; he was marvel
ous when he caught a touchdown
pass and generally performed like
! an all-something-or-other as the
Santa Clarans lost to Stanford; and
! he was sensational in catching two
touchdown passes while the
Broncos lost to the U. of O. Tues
