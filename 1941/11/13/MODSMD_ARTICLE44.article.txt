! terday afternoon.
The Kappa Sig opponent in the
: final, played as a preliminary to the

! meets Delta Kappa Epsilon this

KAPPA SIG VICTORY
Hampered by the leg-injury loss
of Dee Rowe, a key backfield player,
Alpha Delt was no match for Frank
Wells' Kappa Sigma team. The sixth
straight win for the purple-shirted
warriors came as no great surprise
: to most of the circuit's followers
| who have watched the man-in-mo
; tion boys play heads-up ball through
the entire season.
Wells skirted his left end for the
first touchdown, and caught a pass
from teammate Jack Harris for the
second six points. George Henzie
booted the extra point.
Reese sparked his Alpha Delt
teammates in their drive, the out
come being their first defeat in six
starts. The Alpha Delts won a right
to the semi-finals by topping El
Cuadro 9 to 0.
FIREHOUSE VS. DEKE
The Firehouse should move into
the finals by defeating the Dekes
this afternoon. On the basis of past
records, the style of play, and
Pfyl in particular, the blaze chasers
are logical favorites.
But they will be faced with the
problem that no other team this year
has solved. How can one Jim Pol
lard with his extra height and pass
receiving capabilities be kept on the
ground, preferably flat on the
ground? If Pfyl can't answer that
one, he may be watching from the
stands Saturday beside the five
teams that he and his mates have
reduced thus far.

The greatest distance ever walked
in one hour was eight miles, 172
yards by W. Griffin in 1881.
