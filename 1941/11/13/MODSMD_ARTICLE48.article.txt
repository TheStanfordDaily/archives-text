# Time and Tide ... They Just Won't Wait

### 
CONSIDER the dizzy whirlpool. There you
have the United States and nearly every
social or productive citizen, who, through more
or less common purpose, have been caught by a
current and are being used toward the realiza
tion of an ideal. This has come about in the last
two years, the last six months, the last four
months. Time and circumstances have hurried
us into drastically altered ways of life; even
youth (that which has not yet reached its ma
jority) has not escaped altogether, and it will
be counted upon heavily from now on. Nor has
age escaped, for it, too, has been commandeered
for service.
While maintaining the guaranties of the Bill
of Rights, the Government has exercised the
right of eminent domain over citizen and prop
erty to further its immense, concentrated effort.

The whirlpool?
Consider how much money we have donated
in Lend-Lease aid to the Allies in the last year
alone. Thirteen billion dollars! The Neutrality
Zone has been extended and Iceland occupied.
Neutrality Act revision has been passed by the
Senate to permit arming of merchant ships
and their entry into belligerent ports; however,
this morning it seems probable the House will
defeat the revision. The invasion of Russia
caused the United States to abandon its vilifi
cation of that country and actively become its
ally. There was the interesting about-face of
the Communist Daily Worker of New York City
last summer when Russia was invaded.
There is a mass re-creation and re-forming of
social classes in the United States. These classes
are in flux. Perhaps a relatively poor family,
economically, sees its son become an ensign in
the Navy and live, by contrast to earlier expe
riences, luxuriously, and absorb invaluable ex
perience in leadership and responsibility that
might never have been his before; the pampered
son is drafted into the Army and eats dirt as a
bootblack and potato-peeler; the man recently
without a dime in his jeans becomes a shipyard
worker and earns as much as $100 in a week-end
in regular pay and overtime.
Prices, rents and profits skyrocket; people
whose capital is invested in industries adversely
affected by the priorities program are suffering
from diminishing returns and increasing tax
burdens; conversely, those whose capital is in
vested in defense industries find their profits
rising compensatory to tax burdens.
It can be demonstrated statistically (last week
end's college debates in the southland, in which
Stanford participated) that labor strikes are de
creasing, yet the effectiveness of these thou
sands of men failing to do their part in the na
tional defense program is more ominous than
at any other time in the history of the Republic.
Will labor use this war as a weapon for extorting
its demands from the public?

Two years ago, it would have been hard to
imagine these phenomena and, furthermore,
their resulting from or becoming future public
policy. We review these developments as in
teresting sidelights on the process of consum
mation of this Democracy's immediate purpose.
That purpose is to destroy Hitlerian philosophy.
For we are not fighting to kill men and destroy
materials and gain geographic possessions, but
to annihilate a menace to our way of life, and
to supplant that thought with our own ideal.

So we are going to shove Hitler's teeth down
his throat? How best to do it? We're in a naval
war at this moment, but it will take more than
that. It seems illogical that even a combined
B.E.F. and A.E.F. could successfully disembark
on, invade, and capture the European continent
via Atlantic approaches.
We believe the answer may evolve thus:
The commencement of hostilities with Japan
is a possibility which might result from present
strained relations. If such came about, we might
crack the Japanese naval Maginot Line by grab
bing strategic operating bases. We would have
to beat the Nipponese to the draw, taking pos
session of, among others. Borneo, Sumatra, For
mosa, Thailand, and Hainan Island, and obtain

ing co-operation from Singapore. This would
probably result in necessary elimination of the
Japanese navy.
If the Japanese were reduced to ineffective
ness, U.S. forces would inevitably proceed
through Vladivostok and across Siberia to re
inforce Russian resistance against Nazi invasion,
which by that time might conceivably have
reached as far east as the Urals. At the same
time, expeditionary forces might simultaneously
be transported through the Persian Gulf and
landed in Iran, and other forces might be ferried
through the Mediterranean to Turkey (if the
Germans had not pushed too far east in Russia),
and the British might move up through northern
India and Afghanistan.

This portends to be no panacea; certainly
there are military and other practical faults to
be found in this prognostication.
Nor do we propose declaration of war on
Japan—it is merely advanced as a posibility
which circumstances may bring about, and we
believe thst it is at the least a possibility.

Surely, it's easy to philosophize from an arm
chair and talk about going to war and fighting
brother men. It's easy objectively to relegate
the blood and gore to immateriality and irrele
vancy, and cold-bloodedly to map a plan that
is strategically calculated to preserve democ
racy.
We can hope that we, and every American
youth, will have the courage to stand before a
gun and take what can be expected if we
commit ourselves to war. But we mean to get
the other guy first. We pray that we men at
Stanford who have worked and played under
the beneficence of "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht,"
the University's motto, will have the guts to
fight, if need be, to guarantee to our sons that
the winds of freedom will continue to blow.—
