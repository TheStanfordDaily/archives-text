### CHESLIE SAROYAN HIS NAME ISN'T ARAM 
| DON'T just like to come out and say things like
I m about to say, but I can't help it. Every time
Armistice Day rolls around, I get tempted to tell all I
know. For all these years I have held out, but I can't
keep quiet any longer, even if it ruins the annual
program at the Arlington National Cemetery. It's just
that I know the Unknown Soldier.

It was a black, foggy night, and a plting rain made the
ground slushy mud, and my uniform was heavy with
water. Our company had been sent to destroy a Ger
man machine gun nest, but in some way, I had strayed
from my company. I remember that the sign to charge
was given, and that I didn't think it was quite the
time, and the first thing I knew I was alone, lost from
my company.
I was feeling soaked and tired and there was noth
ing to do and nowhere to go because the North star
was covered with fog, so I found a shell hole and lay
down to sleep. The crashing of the big guns hurt my
ears, and the ground that I was sleeping on moved
with each big blast. It was noisy and uncomfortable
but we had walked far that day, and I was soon in a
dead sleep. It seemed only a few seconds after I had
dozed off, that someone started shaking me and push
ing me around, so I turned over and looked up. "What
the hell is it?" I asked. "Can't you see I'm sleepy?"
"I'm lost and don't know what to do," said a sol
dier dressed as I was, with mud and a bewildered
expression on his face.
"Throw a bomb or shoot somebody. There's lots
to do around here," I said and rolled back to sleep.
But he started pushing me around again.
"Who the hell arc you, anyway?" I hollered.
"Oh no you don't. You can't get it out of me that
way."
"Get what out of you?"
"My name."
"I don't give a damn what your name is."
"You would if you knew that I was the Unknown
Soldier," he said softly, triumphantly. I grabbed him
and pulled him down into the shell hole.
"Are you really?" I asked.
"Sure," he said.
"What's your name?"
"I won't tell."
"I'll giv6 you a cigarctte. A Chesterfield. Look."
He eyed the cigarette closely, but held out. "No,"
he said.
"I'll give you two cigarettes."
"No."
"I'll give you two for your first name, and three
for your last name."
"All right," he said and hurriedly grabbed the pack.
He lit a cigarette, carefully put the other four in his
pocket and then leaned over and whispered his name
in my ear, his first name, his last name, and a middle
name thrown in for nothing.
"That isn't such a good name," I said, a little dis
appointed.
"I know it. That's why I don't let it get around."
We smoked and talked for a while, and then we
both fell asleep. The big guns were still crashing, and
I could feel the ground move, beneath me. And then
the morning light opened my eyes, and I looked around
and saw that the sky had cleared, the rain had stopped
and all the noise was gone, except for a little artillery
fire in the distance. Then I remembered my friends
of the night before, but he was gone. And then I re
membered his name and laughed and laughed and was
happy because I was the only one who knew the Un
known Soldier.

"All right," he said and hurriedly grabbed the pack.
He lit a cigarette, carefully put the other four in his
pocket and then leaned over and whispered his name
in my ear, his first name, his last name, and a middle
name thrown in for nothing.
"That isn't such a good name," I said, a little dis
appointed.
"I know it. That's why I don't let it get around."
We smoked and talked for a while, and then we
both fell asleep. The big guns were still crashing, and
I could feel the ground move, beneath me. And then
the morning light opened my eyes, and I looked around
and saw that the sky had cleared, the rain had stopped
and all the noise was gone, except for a little artillery
fire in the distance. Then I remembered my friends
of the night before, but he was gone. And then I re
membered his name and laughed and laughed and was
happy because I was the only one who knew the Un
known Soldier.

Armistice Day rolls around, I get tempted to tell all I
know. For all these years I have held out, but I can't
keep quiet any longer, even if it ruins the annual
program at the Arlington National Cemetery. It's just

It was a black, foggy night, and a plting rain made the
ground slushy mud, and my uniform was heavy with
water. Our company had been sent to destroy a Ger
man machine gun nest, but in some way, I had strayed
from my company. I remember that the sign to charge
was given, and that I didn't think it was quite the
time, and the first thing I knew I was alone, lost from
my company.
I was feeling soaked and tired and there was noth
ing to do and nowhere to go because the North star
was covered with fog, so I found a shell hole and lay
down to sleep. The crashing of the big guns hurt my
ears, and the ground that I was sleeping on moved
with each big blast. It was noisy and uncomfortable
but we had walked far that day, and I was soon in a
dead sleep. It seemed only a few seconds after I had
dozed off, that someone started shaking me and push
ing me around, so I turned over and looked up. "What
the hell is it?" I asked. "Can't you see I'm sleepy?"
"I'm lost and don't know what to do," said a sol
dier dressed as I was, with mud and a bewildered
expression on his face.
"Throw a bomb or shoot somebody. There's lots
to do around here," I said and rolled back to sleep.
But he started pushing me around again.
"Who the hell arc you, anyway?" I hollered.
"Oh no you don't. You can't get it out of me that
way."
"Get what out of you?"
"My name."
"I don't give a damn what your name is."
"You would if you knew that I was the Unknown
Soldier," he said softly, triumphantly. I grabbed him
and pulled him down into the shell hole.
"Are you really?" I asked.
"Sure," he said.
"What's your name?"
"I won't tell."
"I'll giv6 you a cigarctte. A Chesterfield. Look."
He eyed the cigarette closely, but held out. "No,"
he said.
"I'll give you two cigarettes."
"No."
"I'll give you two for your first name, and three
for your last name."

But he started pushing me around again.
"Who the hell arc you, anyway?" I hollered.
"Oh no you don't. You can't get it out of me that
way."
"Get what out of you?"
"My name."
"I don't give a damn what your name is."
"You would if you knew that I was the Unknown
Soldier," he said softly, triumphantly. I grabbed him
and pulled him down into the shell hole.
"Are you really?" I asked.
"Sure," he said.
"What's your name?"
"I won't tell."
"I'll giv6 you a cigarctte. A Chesterfield. Look."
He eyed the cigarette closely, but held out. "No,"
he said.
"I'll give you two cigarettes."
"No."
"I'll give you two for your first name, and three
for your last name."
"All right," he said and hurriedly grabbed the pack.
He lit a cigarette, carefully put the other four in his
pocket and then leaned over and whispered his name
in my ear, his first name, his last name, and a middle
name thrown in for nothing.
"That isn't such a good name," I said, a little dis
appointed.
"I know it. That's why I don't let it get around."
We smoked and talked for a while, and then we
both fell asleep. The big guns were still crashing, and
I could feel the ground move, beneath me. And then
the morning light opened my eyes, and I looked around
and saw that the sky had cleared, the rain had stopped
and all the noise was gone, except for a little artillery
fire in the distance. Then I remembered my friends
of the night before, but he was gone. And then I re
membered his name and laughed and laughed and was
happy because I was the only one who knew the Un
known Soldier.
