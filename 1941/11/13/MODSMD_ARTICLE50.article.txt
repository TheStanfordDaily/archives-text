## HEY, CHES! 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
The following is a personal communication to Mr.
Saroyan. / f
Dear Cheslie:
I don't know you. so I don't know if I want to be
with you. But I have read that you would like to be
dated. I feel sorry for you. If you will pay for half
of the evening, I will go out with you. Maybe we are
equals. I don't think anybody is equal to anybody.
But I am willing to let you prove me wrong.
Lee O'Leary
(Bosom pal of Hortcnse Figgins)
P.S.—What about necking? »
How tall are you?—Saroyan
