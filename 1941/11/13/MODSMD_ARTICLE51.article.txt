# FLYING FULLER TAKES C.P.T
## 
### HARVA SPRAGER 
You just can't keep a good man
down!
That Robert Fuller should decidc
to fly is far from astounding, but
the fact that the urge to get up in
the air was delayed so many years
is unusual.
Bob, who is one of the famous
Flying Fuller family, enrolled in
the civilian pilot training course
this fall. As a family, the Fullers
have probably covered more miles
by air than any other group in the
United States.
FIRST FLIGHT AT SIX
Bob took his? first flight when he
was about six years old. His cousin,
Frank, piloted one of the earliest
open Fairchild planes.
"I just never got around to learn
ing till now," he remarked.
Though he may not have learned
how to fly, he has travelled by air
halfway around the world. A trip
across country is only thought of in
terms of air speed in the Fuller
family.
His European air travel consists
of a trip from Haifa, Palestine, to
Paris in an Italian plane. The plane
travelled at an altitude twice that
of American transports.
"They provided oxygen for ev
eryone. It was comfortable but you
couldn't see anything," he laughed.
GRADUATED IN 1940
Bob graduated from Stanford in
1940, majoring in economics. He
planned to enter the Graduate
School of Business this fall, but since
he has completed the first semester's
requirements he decided to take the
CPT course. Now he is going to
continue with flying and is planning
to take the secondary course offered
by the government. It consists of
six weeks in acrobatic training, four
in cross country and in instructor's
training.
The American University of Beirut
in Syria was his alma mater for his
junior year. He returned from Eu
rope in 1939 at the end of the sum
mer.
He plans to get his commercial li
cense at the end of his advanced
training. Because he's married, he
can't qualify as a cadet in any of the
air corps, but may become an in
structor.
*'I hope there is as little math in
the advanced courses as there is in
| the ground school," he said.
ONLY TAKING 8 UNITS
The eight units of ground school
i all in one quarter doesn't bother
| him, because as a graduate student
; that's all he's taking. But he added
j he probably would have taken the
I course sooner if they had given it
in two quarters of four units each
jas is planned for the rest of the
J year.
Tall and blonde, he can just fold
j it into the Interstate trainer at the
Palo Alto Airport. When he isn't
flying, or waiting for the weather to
clear so he can fly, Bob's thoughts
turn to hunting and golf.

family.
His European air travel consists
of a trip from Haifa, Palestine, to
Paris in an Italian plane. The plane
travelled at an altitude twice that
of American transports.
"They provided oxygen for ev
eryone. It was comfortable but you
couldn't see anything," he laughed.
GRADUATED IN 1940
Bob graduated from Stanford in
1940, majoring in economics. He
planned to enter the Graduate
School of Business this fall, but since
he has completed the first semester's
requirements he decided to take the
CPT course. Now he is going to
continue with flying and is planning
to take the secondary course offered
by the government. It consists of
six weeks in acrobatic training, four
in cross country and in instructor's
training.
The American University of Beirut
in Syria was his alma mater for his
junior year. He returned from Eu
rope in 1939 at the end of the sum
mer.
He plans to get his commercial li
cense at the end of his advanced
training. Because he's married, he
can't qualify as a cadet in any of the
air corps, but may become an in
structor.
*'I hope there is as little math in
the advanced courses as there is in
| the ground school," he said.
ONLY TAKING 8 UNITS
The eight units of ground school
i all in one quarter doesn't bother
| him, because as a graduate student
; that's all he's taking. But he added
j he probably would have taken the
I course sooner if they had given it
in two quarters of four units each
jas is planned for the rest of the
J year.
Tall and blonde, he can just fold
j it into the Interstate trainer at the
Palo Alto Airport. When he isn't
flying, or waiting for the weather to
clear so he can fly, Bob's thoughts
turn to hunting and golf.


ROBERT FULLER
You just can't keep a good man
down!
That Robert Fuller should decidc
to fly is far from astounding, but
the fact that the urge to get up in
the air was delayed so many years
is unusual.
Bob, who is one of the famous
Flying Fuller family, enrolled in
the civilian pilot training course
this fall. As a family, the Fullers
have probably covered more miles
by air than any other group in the
United States.
FIRST FLIGHT AT SIX
Bob took his? first flight when he
was about six years old. His cousin,
Frank, piloted one of the earliest
open Fairchild planes.
"I just never got around to learn
ing till now," he remarked.
Though he may not have learned
how to fly, he has travelled by air
halfway around the world. A trip
across country is only thought of in
terms of air speed in the Fuller
family.
His European air travel consists
of a trip from Haifa, Palestine, to

travelled at an altitude twice that
