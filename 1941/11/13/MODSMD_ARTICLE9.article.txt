## 
### 
With Keith Topping, one of Stan
ford's all-time grid greats, as prin
eipal speaker, the Stanford-Wash
ington State football game rally will
he held tonight at 7:30 on the corner
of the Union Cellar.
"This will be the first time this
location has ever been used," re
ports Verniece Hines, co-chairman
of the rally. "From our investiga
tions, it seems to be an excellent
place."
"The balcony outside the A.S.-
S.U. office will serve c.s the stage,"
she continued, "and the rail about it
is so low that everyone can see
without difficulty."
Cars will be kept out of that sec
tion of Union parking space so there
will be plenty of room for all men
and women attending.
PARADE DOWN ROW
Starting from the Fiji house at
7:15, the Stanford band will start
things going with a parade down
the Row. Picking up students as it
goes, the band will march down the
Row, swing in front of the Union,
and the rally will begin.
Members of living groups off the
Row are asked to fall in behind the
band at the Fiji house if possible or
join the parade at any point along
the way.
Rally Committee members as well
as Gordy Davis, campus policeman,
ask that students leave their cars
home and walk behind the band to
the short rally.
TOPPING VOW HOY'
Member of the famous 1935 "Vow
Boys" Rose Bowl eleven, Topping
teamed with Monk Moscrip to form
one of the finest end combinations
in Stanford history. Only the bril
liant playing of Moscrip kept Top
ping off first string All-American
elevens although he was mentioned
on several all-star teams.
In the 1936 Rose Bowl game
against Southern Methodist, Top
ping turned in what is considered to
be one of the greatest individual
performances in Rose Bowl history.
Now a newspaper publisher in Han
ford, he will make the 200-mile trip
to Stanford for the sole purpose of
speaking at tonight's rally.
Marchy Schwartz, assistant foot
ball coach, will speak, and the team,
the band, and the yell leaders will
all be on hand.
