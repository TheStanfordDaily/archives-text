### AMIE REICHERT 
r JMIE time was later than you think
and somebody had started a
stampede in the House and it looked
bad for the Administration support
ers. They stood around for a while
chewing their nails and then some
body said let's phone the President
and that's just what they did.
And up at the White House it
was later than you think and the
man up there heard all about the
stampede and he knew it looked
bad too. lie drummed on his desk
for a minute and then he said let's
phone "my friends" and that's just
what he did.
So they started a lot of midnight
conferences, and they phoned pretty
nearly every one they could think of,
and they talked very fast and very
hard, and the next day lo and be
hold, the stampede was stopped and
the vote was all right, they won by
a margin of 18.
And this, my child, is how they
passed the neutrality revision pro
gram.

r jpHE President proved Wednesday
night that he had not lost the
old touch—he is still a shrewd poli
tician — although his opponents
would not describe it in those eu
phemistic terms.
Some of the loyal opposition got
very righteous about the Adminis
tration's pressure tactics. Some of
them even got morbid, melodra
matic, and eloquently martyrish.
Senator Bonnet Champ Clark
was fuming. He charged that the
opponents of neutrality revision
had a 20-vote majority at mid
night, and that the measure was
approved only after a series of
secret White House messages to
representatives.
"One Congressman told me he
was called from the White House as
late as 1 o'clock this morning (i.e.,
yesterday morning) and urged to
come down for a conference," the
senator said.
The vote showed, he said, that
"the 194 men and women who voted
against our entry into war were not
actuated by fear or favor or hope
of reward."
"At least those of us who have
opposed this legislation will have
the satisfaction of remembering
that we have not repudiated the
platforms upon which we as well
as the President were elected.
When the day of reckoning comes
we will not he among those who
have the blood of millions of
American hoys on our hands.
"The vision of broken promises
will not haunt our sleep," he de
clared.

JF BROKEN promises have haunt
ing powers, there is probably not
a politician alive who does not have
insomnia. That will not be worry
ing the Administration supporters
any more than it will their oppo
nents.
The big question how is how
much support the President can
still count on from a Congress that
had all the earmarks of revolt
about it Tuesday.
Administration supporters said
last week that they expected a fairly
easy victory in the House on the
neutrality issue. They were fooled—
and it. might have been much
closer.

'JTIE passage of the revision pro
gram cannot be called a tri
umph for the President's foreign
policy. It is a personal and political
tiiumph. Whether other triumphs
can be gained in this same way re
mains to be seen.
However, one bright spot illu
mines the picture for the Admin
istration, and that is the fact that
many of those who opposed pas
sage of the measure did so on the
ground that they would not sup
port the President further until he
dealt with labor more firmly.
And the President is rolling up his
sleeves to tackle the job, now that
this other is out of the way. Today
he will meet with Lewis, Murray,
and the heads of the steel industry
to discuss the Captive mine strike.
