# "THE DUKE IS DANCEABLE"
## 
### DICK ARNOLD 
If anyone tries to tell you that you j
can't dance to Duke Ellington's mu
sic, just latch on and don't pay no i
'tention. Ellington is as marvelous
for dancing now as he was when he 1
started way back in 1926.
The Duke is making a return ap-
I pearance here tonight at the Sopho
j more Cotillion in the Pavilion at 9.
i A tremendous success two years ago
at the "Black and Tan" Junior -
Prom, Ellington returns for the
"Mood Indigo" Cotillion.
It's not often that you have the
chance to dance to the inimitable
Ellington treatment of popular
songs, as well as to the easy rhythm
of things like "In a Mellotone,"
j "Slippery Horn," or Riding on a
| Blue Note." Ellington's band has a
j music all its own, and once you've
j danced to the Duke, you'll never
j want to dance to anyone else.
MOOD INDIGO
That Ellington knows his popular
j music is clearly shown by the beau
tiful songs he has written. His I
"Mood Indigo," "Sophisticated I
\ Lady." and "I Let a Song Go Out of I
I My Heart" rank with the great pop- i
I ular songs of all time.
There are a lot of reasons that

account for the greatness of this <
band.
First, in Duke Ellington, the boys
in the band have the greatest ar- |
ranger and composer in the business. [
The Ellington musical mind is amaz- j

ingly fertile I lie "prolific" Duke,
he's called. He has written hundreds
of tunes and made hundreds of ar
rangements, and the ability of his
musicians to play them in the best
possible manner is not only a credit
to them but to the Duke as well.
'LICORICE STICK'
So when the lush, full notes start
bouncing around the Pavilion to
night, you'll hear and see Barney
Bigard's clarinet, magic on "Clarinet
Lament." Barney is so lazy he sel
dom stands up for his solos, but
the stuff is there and it's mellow.
Rex Stewart will undoubtedly dis
play his hot half-valve trumpet on
the famous "Boy Meets Horn." Al
though Benny Goodman's band cop
ied the arrangement note for note,
there was one thing missing. That
was the remarkable fullness and
power Rex Stewart can impart in
his playing.
Johnny Hodges is a little man, but
big notes come out of his alto and
soprano saxes. He plays the alto
out of the side of his mouth. His
specialties are "I Let a Song Go Out
of My Heart" and "Whispering
Grass."
In addition to being the best bari-


DUKE ELLINGTON
. . the greatest arranger"
Harry Carney is almost the only one.
There's one in Ozzie Nelson's band
and one plays with Count Basic, but
they just don't come close to Carney.
He doesn't stand up for his solos.
He can't. That sax of his is too heavy
to lift all the time, and, as Harry
himself will admit, is a lot of trouble
to carry around.
Juan Tizol plays a valve trombone
â€”a smooth, mysterious trombone,
you know, if you've ever heard
"Caravan" or "Pyramid." Joseph
"Tricky Sam" Nanton plays the
wa-wa mute trombone and plays it
the way it never was or will be
played.
The only thing left for you to do
is to go see the Duke tonight. You'll
never regret having seen the King of
Sweet, the King of 110 l -the Duke
of Ellington.
