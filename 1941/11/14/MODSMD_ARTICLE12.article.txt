# 'Knickerbocker' Rollicks Onto Farm For 3-Day Run
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Charm, more than a modicum of the risque, a complete quota of hilarity,
an excellent cast, and delightful music last night hit the Memorial Hall
audience squarely in the eye, when they saw the premier Farm perform
ance of the Stanford Players' production of Maxwell Anderson's "Knick
erbocker Holiday" with music by Kurt Weill.

All this—and a message, too. +
Not a hysterical message—just a I
good message which was no trouble
to take and worth remembering j
anyway.
"Knickerbocker Holiday" comes
out of the head of Maxwell Ander
son—who is more famous for his
blank verse dramas — through a
spokesman who has gained *a certain
amount of fame under the name of
Washington Irving.
MARCUSES FIELD DAY
In last night's performance Ted
Marcuse had a field day as he
bounded about the stage on a silver
leg, lashing out cynically at the
world and dictators in general, and
roaring Kurt Weill's pungent lyrics.
You'll particularly remember the
song which concerns a "maiden who,
unless she is particularly stupid, will
naturally accumulate experimental
scars in serving her apprenticeship
to Cupid . . ."
Up with Marcuse in the top ranks |
was Dr. Bayard Q. Morgan, who
played Tienhoven, the "Indispensable
Man" (the man who handles the
hush money in any political set-up).
Ted Uppman had the best singing
voice in the cast and played Wash
ington Irving with proper spirit, and
the right amused quality. Johnny
High's early-day Roosevelt was
quite a character, too.
COMICAL LOVERS
The love interest, supplied by Hal
Millen and Betsy Durkee, was prop
erly delightful, beset, and funny as
the dickens. Their voices comple
mented each other well, particularly
in the jail scene, in which Miss Dur
kee, according to the script, did a
starched early-American strip- !
tease.
Opinion: Under no circumstances
miss it. It crackles with topical,
double-edged wit; the sets and cos
tumes are magnificent; and the mu
sic and'acting arc superb.
