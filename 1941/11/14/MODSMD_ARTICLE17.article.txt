# Indians Face Cougars Tomorrow Minus Hoot
## Redskins Fear Sewell Passes 
### H. D. THOREAU 
The Pacific Coast's two most po
tent offenses will meet at 2 p.m.
tomorrow when Washington State's
Cougars attempt to detour the Pasa

The Cards' last heavy practice
yesterday afternoon and evening
was punctuated by the announce

due to a wrenched ankle, will prob

A1 Cole was in the driver's seat of
the T during the entire workout,

team this week when he told his
charges that they would have to
score 27 points to finish ahead of
the northerners. He called them the
most dangerous team in the league
and expected them to score two or
three touchdowns.
After losing to U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
and Washington, Coach Babe Hol
lingbery's men staged a reversal of
form and have defeated both tough
Oregon teams and a tricky Idaho
squad. An early season win over
Cal gives them four victories, three
defeats, and fourth place in the
Piose Bowl Derby, formally called
the P.C.C. race.
SUSOEFI CATCHES
Most of Sewell's pitching is done
to Nick Susoeff and Dale Gentry,
sterling end combination. Only
Freddie Meyer, Indian flankman,
leads Susoeff in the Coast's pass
receiving department. When not
catching Sewell's passes, Gentry
spends his time blocking punts in
