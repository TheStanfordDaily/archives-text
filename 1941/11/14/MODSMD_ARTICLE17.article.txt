# Indians Face Cougars Tomorrow Minus Hoot
## Redskins Fear Sewell Passes 
### H. D. THOREAU 
The Pacific Coast's two most po
tent offenses will meet at 2 p.m.
tomorrow when Washington State's
Cougars attempt to detour the Pasa
dena-hound Indians in a thrill-a
minute gridiron classic.
The Cards' last heavy practice
yesterday afternoon and evening
was punctuated by the announce
ment that Eric "Hoot" Armstrong,
due to a wrenched ankle, will prob
ably not play tomorrow.
A1 Cole was in the driver's seat of
the T during the entire workout,
with Frankie Albert sitting on the
sidelines with two sore legs. He
will start against the Staters, how
ever, probably playing most of the
game.
SEWELL vs. ALBERT
Billy Sewell, the Frankie Albert,
of the Northwest, and Felix Fletcher,
the Pete Kmetovic of the same re
gion, will pit their passing and
running prowess against the ability
of the real Albert and Kmetovic.
Coach Clark Shauglinessy, local
wonder man, sounded the keynote
for the game at a pep talk to the
team this week when he told his
charges that they would have to
score 27 points to finish ahead of
the northerners. He called them the
most dangerous team in the league
and expected them to score two or
three touchdowns.
After losing to U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
and Washington, Coach Babe Hol
lingbery's men staged a reversal of
form and have defeated both tough
Oregon teams and a tricky Idaho
squad. An early season win over
Cal gives them four victories, three
defeats, and fourth place in the
Piose Bowl Derby, formally called
the P.C.C. race.
SUSOEFI CATCHES
Most of Sewell's pitching is done
to Nick Susoeff and Dale Gentry,
sterling end combination. Only
Freddie Meyer, Indian flankman,
leads Susoeff in the Coast's pass
receiving department. When not
catching Sewell's passes, Gentry
spends his time blocking punts in
the opponents' backfield.
Completely crossing up the de
fenses of most of the teams he has
played this year, Hollingbery has
depended more on the running of
Fletcher, Billy Holmes, and Boh
Kennedy than he has on the left
half's throws.
Although he did not take part
in the Cougars' triumph over Idaho
last week, Fletcher will be ready to
go tomorrow. Holmes, his sub, func
tions with little less efficiency when
he is in the ball game.
BECKMAN HURT
Indications from the North are
that W.S.C. will start a line com
posed of Susoelf, Wooddy, Ward,
Remington, Doepke, Beckman, and
Gentry, from left end to right end.
Beckman, team captain, has been
bothered by a knee injury, but is
expected to play a large portion of
the game.
Washington State has won two of
the live games played between the
two schools and hopes to even the
count down of ihe stadium turf to
morrow. They almost stopped the
Farm team's Rose Bowl march early
last season when they piled up a
seven-point lead in the first period
at Pullman. However, just as the
Indian rooters were about to believe
in the "jinx of the Palouse," which
haunts all visiting teams in South
western Washington, the T began to
function. It functioned four touch
downs' worth, before letting the
Staters have another score.
FAWCETT STARTS
Shaughnessy will probably stick
with the starting lineup he has used
most of the season tomorrow, with
the exception of the right halfback
and left guard spots. With Arm
strong a very doubtful starter, Buck
Fawcett may open at the position he
has occupied all week in practice.
II the Cards are on the kicking end
wheh the whistle blows, Co-captain
Ken Robesky will start at left guard,
otherwise Chuck Taylor will be in
there. Sharing captain honors with
Robesky will be Bob Crane, reserve
back. Both are seniors.
The other starters include Fred
die Meyer at right end, Bruno Ban
ducci at right tackle, Loren La-
Prade at right guard, Vic Lindskog
at center, Ed Stamm, left tackle, Ar
nie Meiners, left end, and Milt Vu
cinich, powering his way from the
lull back position.
If there isn't enough excitement
on Ihe field tomorrow, watch Hol
lingbery perform on the sidelines.
He is a show by himself.

of the real Albert and Kmetovic.
Coach Clark Shauglinessy, local
wonder man, sounded the keynote
for the game at a pep talk to the
team this week when he told his
charges that they would have to
score 27 points to finish ahead of
the northerners. He called them the
most dangerous team in the league
and expected them to score two or
three touchdowns.
After losing to U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
and Washington, Coach Babe Hol
lingbery's men staged a reversal of
form and have defeated both tough
Oregon teams and a tricky Idaho
squad. An early season win over
Cal gives them four victories, three
defeats, and fourth place in the
Piose Bowl Derby, formally called
the P.C.C. race.
SUSOEFI CATCHES
Most of Sewell's pitching is done
to Nick Susoeff and Dale Gentry,
sterling end combination. Only
Freddie Meyer, Indian flankman,
leads Susoeff in the Coast's pass
receiving department. When not
catching Sewell's passes, Gentry
spends his time blocking punts in
the opponents' backfield.
Completely crossing up the de
fenses of most of the teams he has
played this year, Hollingbery has
depended more on the running of
Fletcher, Billy Holmes, and Boh
Kennedy than he has on the left
half's throws.
Although he did not take part
in the Cougars' triumph over Idaho
last week, Fletcher will be ready to
go tomorrow. Holmes, his sub, func
tions with little less efficiency when
he is in the ball game.
BECKMAN HURT
Indications from the North are
that W.S.C. will start a line com
posed of Susoelf, Wooddy, Ward,
Remington, Doepke, Beckman, and
Gentry, from left end to right end.
Beckman, team captain, has been
bothered by a knee injury, but is
expected to play a large portion of
the game.
Washington State has won two of
the live games played between the
two schools and hopes to even the
count down of ihe stadium turf to
morrow. They almost stopped the
Farm team's Rose Bowl march early
last season when they piled up a
seven-point lead in the first period
at Pullman. However, just as the
Indian rooters were about to believe
in the "jinx of the Palouse," which
haunts all visiting teams in South
western Washington, the T began to
function. It functioned four touch
downs' worth, before letting the
Staters have another score.
FAWCETT STARTS
Shaughnessy will probably stick
with the starting lineup he has used
most of the season tomorrow, with
the exception of the right halfback
and left guard spots. With Arm
strong a very doubtful starter, Buck
Fawcett may open at the position he
has occupied all week in practice.
II the Cards are on the kicking end
wheh the whistle blows, Co-captain
Ken Robesky will start at left guard,
otherwise Chuck Taylor will be in
there. Sharing captain honors with
Robesky will be Bob Crane, reserve
back. Both are seniors.
The other starters include Fred
die Meyer at right end, Bruno Ban
ducci at right tackle, Loren La-
Prade at right guard, Vic Lindskog
at center, Ed Stamm, left tackle, Ar
nie Meiners, left end, and Milt Vu
cinich, powering his way from the
lull back position.
If there isn't enough excitement
on Ihe field tomorrow, watch Hol
lingbery perform on the sidelines.
He is a show by himself.
The Pacific Coast's two most po
tent offenses will meet at 2 p.m.
tomorrow when Washington State's
Cougars attempt to detour the Pasa
dena-hound Indians in a thrill-a
minute gridiron classic.
The Cards' last heavy practice
yesterday afternoon and evening
was punctuated by the announce
ment that Eric "Hoot" Armstrong,
due to a wrenched ankle, will prob
ably not play tomorrow.
A1 Cole was in the driver's seat of
the T during the entire workout,
with Frankie Albert sitting on the
sidelines with two sore legs. He
will start against the Staters, how
ever, probably playing most of the
game.

Billy Sewell, the Frankie Albert,
of the Northwest, and Felix Fletcher,
the Pete Kmetovic of the same re
gion, will pit their passing and

Freddie Meyer, Indian flankman,
leads Susoeff in the Coast's pass
receiving department. When not
catching Sewell's passes, Gentry
spends his time blocking punts in
the opponents' backfield.
Completely crossing up the de
fenses of most of the teams he has
played this year, Hollingbery has
depended more on the running of
Fletcher, Billy Holmes, and Boh
Kennedy than he has on the left
half's throws.
Although he did not take part
in the Cougars' triumph over Idaho
last week, Fletcher will be ready to
go tomorrow. Holmes, his sub, func
tions with little less efficiency when
he is in the ball game.
BECKMAN HURT
Indications from the North are
that W.S.C. will start a line com
posed of Susoelf, Wooddy, Ward,
Remington, Doepke, Beckman, and
Gentry, from left end to right end.
Beckman, team captain, has been
bothered by a knee injury, but is
expected to play a large portion of
the game.
Washington State has won two of
the live games played between the
two schools and hopes to even the
count down of ihe stadium turf to
morrow. They almost stopped the
Farm team's Rose Bowl march early
last season when they piled up a
seven-point lead in the first period
at Pullman. However, just as the
Indian rooters were about to believe
in the "jinx of the Palouse," which
haunts all visiting teams in South
western Washington, the T began to
function. It functioned four touch
downs' worth, before letting the
Staters have another score.
FAWCETT STARTS
Shaughnessy will probably stick
with the starting lineup he has used
most of the season tomorrow, with
the exception of the right halfback
and left guard spots. With Arm
strong a very doubtful starter, Buck
Fawcett may open at the position he
has occupied all week in practice.
II the Cards are on the kicking end
wheh the whistle blows, Co-captain
Ken Robesky will start at left guard,
otherwise Chuck Taylor will be in
there. Sharing captain honors with
Robesky will be Bob Crane, reserve
back. Both are seniors.
The other starters include Fred
die Meyer at right end, Bruno Ban
ducci at right tackle, Loren La-
Prade at right guard, Vic Lindskog
at center, Ed Stamm, left tackle, Ar
nie Meiners, left end, and Milt Vu
cinich, powering his way from the
lull back position.
If there isn't enough excitement
on Ihe field tomorrow, watch Hol
lingbery perform on the sidelines.
He is a show by himself.
The Pacific Coast's two most po
tent offenses will meet at 2 p.m.
tomorrow when Washington State's
Cougars attempt to detour the Pasa
dena-hound Indians in a thrill-a
minute gridiron classic.
The Cards' last heavy practice
yesterday afternoon and evening
was punctuated by the announce
ment that Eric "Hoot" Armstrong,
due to a wrenched ankle, will prob
ably not play tomorrow.
A1 Cole was in the driver's seat of
the T during the entire workout,
with Frankie Albert sitting on the
sidelines with two sore legs. He
will start against the Staters, how
ever, probably playing most of the
game.
SEWELL vs. ALBERT
Billy Sewell, the Frankie Albert,
of the Northwest, and Felix Fletcher,
the Pete Kmetovic of the same re
gion, will pit their passing and
running prowess against the ability
of the real Albert and Kmetovic.
Coach Clark Shauglinessy, local
wonder man, sounded the keynote
for the game at a pep talk to the
team this week when he told his
charges that they would have to
score 27 points to finish ahead of
the northerners. He called them the
most dangerous team in the league
and expected them to score two or
three touchdowns.
After losing to U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
and Washington, Coach Babe Hol
lingbery's men staged a reversal of
form and have defeated both tough
Oregon teams and a tricky Idaho
squad. An early season win over
Cal gives them four victories, three
defeats, and fourth place in the
Piose Bowl Derby, formally called
the P.C.C. race.
SUSOEFI CATCHES
Most of Sewell's pitching is done
to Nick Susoeff and Dale Gentry,
