# Firehouse, Kappa Sigma Clash Tomorrow at 12:15 For Mural Grid Crown
## 
### 
Firehouse decisively defeated Delta Kappa Epsilon, 20-7. in their semi
final intramural football game yesterday t<â€¢ enter the finals of the 1941
race against Kappa Sigma in Stanford Stadium at 12:15 tomorrow.
Although the Dekes were visibly handicapped by the loss of Jim Pol
lard until late in the first half, there was no doubt in the minds of specta
tors that Firehouse deserved the 4

victory. The spot passing of back
Monte Pfyl was at the highest point
of the season, and the blocking and
defense of Tom Kruger, George
Kaufman, Bill Berreyssa, Frank
Pfyl, Frank Farreil, and Wyland
Cripe was tops.
The winners had things their way
in the first quarter. While the Dekes
were still trying to organize their
defense without Pollard, the fire
eaters swept to two touchdowns
early in the first half. Both came on
passes by Pfyl, one to brother Frank
and another to Farreil.
SAFETY SCORED
A Deke back was caught behind
his own goal for a safety and an
other two points were added onto
the Firehouse total.
Pollard joined the Dekes near the
end of the half, and they tightened
to hold the Firehouse for the rest of
the first frame. Again utilizing their
passing attack built upon Pollard's
height, the Dekes scored in the first
moments of the second period, Jack
Clark passing to Pollard for the goal.
Firehouse snapped back into form
toward the end of the game when j
Ply 1 pitched another touchdown pass
to George Kaufman for the final ;
points.
TOMORROW'S TILT
The final tomorrow between Frank j
Wells' gang and the Firemen should
be a preliminary worth the effort j
involved in turning out a trifle early.
Most people would miss some lunch
to see the duel that is bound to |
occur when Pfyl is pitched against
Wells and the pass fireworks start
to fly.
Early in the season it might have
been a lead pipe cinch for Firehouse.
But the Row men have been getting
better and better with their inan
in-motion, flat passing attack, and
ihere are many supporters for a [
Kappa Sig victory developing as
game lime nears.
Immediately after the game the
members of the two teams will be
introduced through the loud-speak
er system, and Dr. Oswald Anderson,
general director of the School of
Health, will present the trophy to
ihe champions.
In case of a Firehouse victory,
they also become permanent hold
ers of the traditional three-year cup
which will not be used after this
year.
