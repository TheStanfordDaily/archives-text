# Splashers Vie With California
## 
### 
Fighting to save their season,
Stanford's varsity water polo team
will tangle wtih the California
Bears tomorrow morning at 11 at
| Berkeley in the first of a two-game
1 series.
1
Now tied with the Bears for third
place in the conference race, the
Card mermen must take both games
to move up to .second place. A
double loss will put them in last
place.
That the Farm swimmers are gun
| ning for the Bears was shown by an
11-to-0 score rolled up against the
second team in scrimmage Wednes
day. Only team member not in top
i shape is Captain Frank Mitchell,
J who was bothered by a cold at the
1 start of the week, but he will be
j ready to go tomorrow.
CARDS LEAD BEARS
Stanford and California have play
|ed 41 water polo games, Stanford
; winning 32 and California 9. But
j since A1 Dowden has taken over the
Bear coaching duties, the count
j stands at 10 to 9 in favor of Stan
ford, typifying the close rivalry be
i tween the two teams in the past few
years. They have split the series in
the last three years.
Off the basis of comparative scores,
the Indians are slight underdogs for
tomorrow's contest. California lost,
12-2, to U.S.C. and then won, 9-8,
while Stanford first beat the Tro
jans, 8-6, and then lost, 10 to 7.
California dropped a pair to
J U.C.L.A., 5-4 and 11-7, as did Stan
ford, 10-G and 10-7.
SCORES MEAN LITTLE
But comparative scores mean lit
tle when Stanford and California
renew their ancient rivalry in any
sport. A double win is particularly
desired by the Indians to make up
for an already somewhat shattered
season.
Still experimenting to find his best
forward combination, Thornton plans
to start Bill Mapel at center, and
j Hadley Bacon and either Fred Man-
Waring or Grant Culley at the two
forward positions.
II this doesn't work, Thornton may
shift Bacon to sprint so he can use
both Culley and Man waring. First -
1 stringer at the start of the season,
| Manwaring was overshadowed by
I the brilliant play of sophomore Cul
ley, but he has come back to make a !
j real fight for the forward job.
BACKS SET
Stanford's backfield is set with
Mitchell and Bob Jones, guards; and
Jack Bleecker, center back. Thorn
ton's backfield is generally consid
-1 ered to be the equal of any on the
! Coast.
The goalie position is still in doubt
among Pete Lee, Bob Breckner. and
1 Ed Smith. Lee looked good in prac
tice this week and may get the call,
but the starter won't be definitely
known until game time.

1 stringer at the start of the season,
| Manwaring was overshadowed by
I the brilliant play of sophomore Cul
ley, but he has come back to make a !
j real fight for the forward job.
BACKS SET
Stanford's backfield is set with
Mitchell and Bob Jones, guards; and
Jack Bleecker, center back. Thorn
ton's backfield is generally consid
-1 ered to be the equal of any on the
! Coast.
The goalie position is still in doubt
among Pete Lee, Bob Breckner. and
1 Ed Smith. Lee looked good in prac
tice this week and may get the call,
but the starter won't be definitely
known until game time.
Fighting to save their season,
Stanford's varsity water polo team
will tangle wtih the California
Bears tomorrow morning at 11 at
| Berkeley in the first of a two-game
1 series.

Now tied with the Bears for third
place in the conference race, the
Card mermen must take both games
to move up to .second place. A
double loss will put them in last
place.
That the Farm swimmers are gun
| ning for the Bears was shown by an
11-to-0 score rolled up against the
second team in scrimmage Wednes
day. Only team member not in top
i shape is Captain Frank Mitchell,
J who was bothered by a cold at the
1 start of the week, but he will be
j ready to go tomorrow.
CARDS LEAD BEARS
Stanford and California have play
|ed 41 water polo games, Stanford
; winning 32 and California 9. But
j since A1 Dowden has taken over the
Bear coaching duties, the count
j stands at 10 to 9 in favor of Stan
ford, typifying the close rivalry be
i tween the two teams in the past few
years. They have split the series in
the last three years.
Off the basis of comparative scores,
the Indians are slight underdogs for
tomorrow's contest. California lost,
12-2, to U.S.C. and then won, 9-8,
while Stanford first beat the Tro
jans, 8-6, and then lost, 10 to 7.
California dropped a pair to
J U.C.L.A., 5-4 and 11-7, as did Stan
ford, 10-G and 10-7.
SCORES MEAN LITTLE
But comparative scores mean lit
tle when Stanford and California
renew their ancient rivalry in any
sport. A double win is particularly
desired by the Indians to make up
for an already somewhat shattered
season.
Still experimenting to find his best
forward combination, Thornton plans
to start Bill Mapel at center, and
j Hadley Bacon and either Fred Man-
Waring or Grant Culley at the two
forward positions.
