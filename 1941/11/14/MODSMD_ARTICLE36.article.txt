# Light Heavyweights Battle Tomorrow
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 13 (UP). â€”They
scorn the light heavyweight crown,
but Gus Lesnevich and Young Tami
Mauriello will be in the Garden
ring tomorrow night battling again
for the virtually worthless bauble.
Neither Champion Lesnevich nor
the 21-year-old Bronx Italian cares
what happens to the 175-pound
diadem, but each will be striving for
an impressive victory that may boost
his box-office appeal.
