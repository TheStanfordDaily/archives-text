HAVE nn doubt heard of the great "Wednesday" football players,
the k-.ds who shine like all get-out during the week-day practice ses
sions but who spend most of their time on the bench come Saturday's big
contest.
Well, that may he just the spot that little Al Cole is in. the former
running threat at left half who lias been shifted to quarter to spell
All-American Frankie Albert. That is. he's there to spell Albert IF
Stanford's great quarterback ever needs a rest. And that's just the
point, lor very seldom does Albert ever conic out of the fra.v when the
Indians are on offense.
Yesterday s drill, the last heavy one before tomorrow's important game
with Washington State, found Albert sitting" on the sidelines, watching the
workout in street clothes. He was just resting a pair of sore calves and
will be ready for the game.
In his place was Cole, ran on offense with both the first and second
teams and looked plenty good in so doing. Of course, Cole's running tal-

ents do not get much of a chance to
show from that spot, but his ball
handling and passing were out
standing.
Sure, Cole looked great. But it's
very doubtful that he will see a great
deal of action against the Cougars,
unless the game is a pushover and
that isn't likely. Anyway, Scooter
will know that he was Thursday's
star.

r CHANCES are that you will
get to the Stadium tomorrow just
in lijne to get a good seat in the
rooting section for the varsity bat
tle. However, if you really like to
watch an exciting brand of football,
get there by 12:15 to see Monte Pfyl
and his Firehou.se seven go to it
hammer and tongs with the Kappa
Sigs, sparked by Frank Wells.
If you have any idea that intra
mural football is a soft, easy game
just because (hey plav tag ball

instead of tackle, you have another think coining. Those hoys play hall
for keeps, blocking on offense and crashing through interference on de
fense as if their lives depended on it. We'll pick the Firehouse to win.

J UCKIE LOUIE cnmo striding into the Shack again yesterday and gave
forth with the following predictions: Oregon State over Cal; Stanford
over W.S.C.; Mnotana over Idaho; Santa Clara over St. Mary's (Sun.);
and San Jose State over Fresno (tonight).

will be ready for the game.
In his place was Cole, ran on offense with both the first and second
teams and looked plenty good in so doing. Of course, Cole's running tal-

ents do not get much of a chance to
show from that spot, but his ball
handling and passing were out
standing.
Sure, Cole looked great. But it's
very doubtful that he will see a great
deal of action against the Cougars,
unless the game is a pushover and
that isn't likely. Anyway, Scooter
will know that he was Thursday's
star.

r CHANCES are that you will
get to the Stadium tomorrow just
in lijne to get a good seat in the
rooting section for the varsity bat
tle. However, if you really like to
watch an exciting brand of football,
get there by 12:15 to see Monte Pfyl
and his Firehou.se seven go to it
hammer and tongs with the Kappa
Sigs, sparked by Frank Wells.
If you have any idea that intra
mural football is a soft, easy game
just because (hey plav tag ball

instead of tackle, you have another think coining. Those hoys play hall
for keeps, blocking on offense and crashing through interference on de
fense as if their lives depended on it. We'll pick the Firehouse to win.

forth with the following predictions: Oregon State over Cal; Stanford
over W.S.C.; Mnotana over Idaho; Santa Clara over St. Mary's (Sun.);
and San Jose State over Fresno (tonight).


AL COLE
HAVE nn doubt heard of the great "Wednesday" football players,
the k-.ds who shine like all get-out during the week-day practice ses
sions but who spend most of their time on the bench come Saturday's big
contest.
Well, that may he just the spot that little Al Cole is in. the former
running threat at left half who lias been shifted to quarter to spell
All-American Frankie Albert. That is. he's there to spell Albert IF
Stanford's great quarterback ever needs a rest. And that's just the
point, lor very seldom does Albert ever conic out of the fra.v when the
Indians are on offense.
Yesterday s drill, the last heavy one before tomorrow's important game
with Washington State, found Albert sitting" on the sidelines, watching the
workout in street clothes. He was just resting a pair of sore calves and
will be ready for the game.
