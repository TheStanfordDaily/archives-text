# Irish to Defend Perfect Record
## 
### 
CHICAGO. Nov. 13 (UP).—Twin
worires—the weather and injuries—
hit Frank Leahy of Notre Dame to
day as he gingerly prepared the bat
tered Irish for defense of an unde
feated record at North western Sat
urday.
Navy's two-team system caused
considerable more damage last
week than Leahy first believed and
the Irish took such a pounding that
four of the 11 starters still are far
below par.
Threat of week-end showers was
even more depressing, for the Irish
definitely are poor mudders. Twice
they've been rained on and each
time their high speed attack and the
deadly passing of Angelo Bertelli
loked like kindergarten stuff.
