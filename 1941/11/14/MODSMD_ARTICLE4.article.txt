# House Passes Neutrality Revision by 18 Votes After President's Appeal
## Navy to Begin Arming Merchantmen Immediately; Roosevelt to Seize Captive Mines if Mediation Fails 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (LP).—The House passed the Administration's
Neutrality Revision Hill by a margin of IS votes today after President
Roosevelt intervened personally to stem a Democratic revolt which threat
ened a disastrous foreign policy defeat. #
The vote —212 to 194—completed Congressional action on the historic

measure and brought the President
perhaps the most momentous foreign
policy triumph in his nearly nine
years at the nation's helm.
But the hard-won victory came
only after the Administration had
been compelled to use every resource
at its command to put across the
legislation which removes the three
cornerstones of the Neutrality Act—
2 and 3, which barred
American merchantmen from combat
zones and belligerent ports, and
Section 6, which forbade arming the
ships.
BILL SIGNED MONDAY
As soon as Mr. Roosevelt signs the
resolution — probably Monday be
cause of an unforeseen Senate de
lay—armed American flagships will
be free to sail anywhere in the
world with war cargoes for nations
fighting Hitlerism.
The Navy is expected to begin
arming and manning the merchant
men immediately, and one of the
President's first actions, when the
measure becomes law, will be to
remove the combat zone restrictions
which have kept American vessels
out of proscribed waters.
F.D.R. INTERVENES
The President, himself, was forced
to go to the firing line before he
could win.
In a dramatic, last-minute letter
to the chamber, he warned that de
feat of the measure would be evi
dence to Hitler that "the United
States is disunited" and would make
it more difficult to halt defense
strikes.
He dispatched the letter after a
bloc of Democrats bolted to the op
position during the two days of de
bate.
