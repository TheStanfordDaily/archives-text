## 
### 
A team of six Stanford poloists
will leave today to encounter teams
from the Universities of Utah, Ari
zona. and the New Mexico Military j
Institute. With Ben Snure out of the
hospital, the Farm men will leave j
with high hopes of overcoming the
j Arizonans in the first encounter
! next Thursday.
Bill Dirker, Denny Green, Mike
Gates, Ben Snure, Bob Klummer
and Ralph Grana, will leave this j
morning with Lieut. Ranzoni.
Lieut. Ranzoni's poloists should be
in top shape for the games, as a
week of scrimmage has shown re-
I suits that will make the Redskins a i
i team to be reckoned with.
