# "Let There Be Light"

### 
ROBLE women will wander into the land of
legislated mystery again today.
The rules which govern these wanderings
up the Row are apparently necessary to a fair
system of rushing at Stanford, but they create an
artificial tension, both in the sororities and in
Roble, which works to the detriment of both.
For the second time, new women will visit
the only part of Stanford they have not been at
full liberty to explore. The legislated mystery
which surrounds the sororities cultivates within
the freshmen a high degree of curiosity, which
is conditioned by excitement. They will scrub
and powder and brush and manicure before
they walk up the picturesque, shaded street.
And worry.
And, for the second time, sororities have the
opportunity of seeing the "better half of 1945."
They, too, suffer from the effects of necessary,
legislated mystery. With the freshman visits
strictly limited, each house must present the
best possible "spot" appearance. They, like
the freshmen, will scrub and powder and brush
and manicure. And worry.
While each of the two parties to the process
of rushing concentrates wholeheartedly on ap
pearing at its best, the element of deception
unconsciously enters on both sides. Each fresh
man woman is looking for a suitable place to
live for the next three years. Each house is
looking for suitable additions to its particular
group.
Let both parties to today's, and subsequent,
rushing keep their eyes open—wide.—Rose
