To rally, or not to rally, that is the question;
Whether 'tis nobler tor Rallycom to suffer
The slings and Campus Opinions of outraged
students,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And, by having a good rally, end them . . .
RALLY COMMITTEE last night got out of its
monotonous rut of conventionality and did
something different for a change.
They took the rally out of the old bugaboo
Pavilion. They had a good speaker, though he
might have pared his remarks a little closer to
the ten-minute limit. They drew a good crowd.
They had a good rally.
We hope that Rally Committee bigwigs in
their individual soliloquizing during the next
few days try to decide 'twas better to have a
rally—which turned out very well—which gave
those interested students a chance to yell if
they wanted, which saved them from the slings,
etc., that would have greeted "No Rally This
Week" headlines.
It showed Stanford that Rallycom has not lost
interest, that they can "take" a little griping
without staying sore about it.
The only thing that is not good about the
whole thing is that they waited until the end of
the season to show some real originality.
