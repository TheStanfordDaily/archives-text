THAT weatherman is here again.
He's hitting the front pages, including those
of the Southern California papers, with those
little forecasts of "rain in the offing."
Stanford students don't mind the rain, par
ticularly. It gives the girls a chance to wear
those black boots they love so much.
But as for the men—they are not very much
in favor of adopting those boots as an article of
male attire. In fact, they would be very much
against it, if for no other reason than that they
don't have them and would have to buy them.
That would pinch pocketbooks as well as toes.
But some local merchant is going to create
for himself a rushing business in selling boots
for men (plus all women who don't now have
them) if something concrete (or just plain oiled
and rolled) isn't done about what used to be the
libe parking lot, the Toyon parking lot, the Row
sidewalk, and a few of the other places whose
drainage facilities ought to get a little attention.
