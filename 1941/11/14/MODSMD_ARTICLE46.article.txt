TRADITIONS these days are pretty easy to
break. We find them falling by the wayside
in many phases of college life.
In many cases, there are no new traditions
rising to take the place of the old ones.

But Wednesday night the Class of '42 hurdied
the moss-covered walls and dropped the mak
ings of a solid new tradition right into the lap of
Stanford undergraduate life.
The first Senior Sing was a success.
The two hundred '42-ers present in the Toyon
Lobby definitely put their stamp of approval
on Senior Sings when asked whether there
should be another one early in winter quarter.
Mark Edwards, senior class president from
Berkeley, added to the chorus of approbation.
In fact, he said that they would like to exchange
intermission talent with us next quarter.
A lot of lessons have been learned. The next
Sing will be much better. It also should draw,
with the right publicity and promotion, double
the attendance.
The next time, there'll be more songs, new
songs, new specialty numbers, added talent
from Cal, and more people.
Congratulations to the Senior Class officers
and committeemen who put over the Senior
Sing. Best luck for the next one.
