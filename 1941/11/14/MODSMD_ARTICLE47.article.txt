WE LIKE OUR BOYS
JT SEEMS that no matter what a football coach docs,
it is impossible to please everyone. At least it is
impossible to please Bud Spencer, former Stanford
athlete and at present a writer on the sports stall of
the San Francisco News. Everyone knows that Clark
Shaughnessy stepped into Stanford football when it
was in one of its worst slumps. And everyone who sat
in the stadium two years ago and watched the team
go down to defeat one Saturday after another appre
ciates what Mr. Shaughnessy has done.
But Mr. Spencer still thinks there are a lot of
things wrong. Here is what he says about Mr. Shaugh
nessy: "Saturday he proved himself to be just another
amateur football coach who goes along taking money
away from suckers who fall for a big build-up. In the
prize fight racket or any other professional sport, Mr.
Shaughnessy and his body would have been booed.
More than that, they would have gotten the old tomato
or grapefruit, because it was stalling of the worst kind
after the first period."
I personally don't understand Mr. Spencer. I don't
think football fans are suckers, and I think it illogical
to compare football to prize-fighting and other pro
fessional sports. Our football players are not paid to
thrill anyone. They play football for the school and
try to beat another school and if anyone wants to come
and watch they can.
And if our team loked dull in the last three quarters
of the S.C. game, they can't be blamed for that. They
have played four quarters of chilling football every
time since Mr. Shaughnessy took over. I should think
they would be entitled to win one Saturday without a
last-minute pass without provoking Mr. Spencer to
make such a fool of himself. Mr. Shaughnessy has
won 16 out of the last 17 games in a tough round-robin
conference, and I personally think he's a good coach
and would like him to stay around a while longer.

A ND Mr. Spencer still thinks that Frankie Albert is
essentially a clown, despite the unfavorable com
ment his Saturday Evening Post story raised. He says,
"Albert ran out of bounds with a pack of tacklers chas
ing him in the second period, but suddenly the kid
jerked himself back to a formal deportment, remem
bering that one of his Stanford advisers told him, 'Don't
clown, Frankie. Stanford men are gentlemen and are
expected to hold their emotions in check at all times'."
Everyone that knows anything at all about Albert
knows that he isn't a clown on the football field.
And none of us want him to be a clown. We like
instead to watch his football brain work, we like to
watch him kick and pass and run the team like few
quarterbacks have ever done. And wc don't care if he
makes us laugh or not. If Mr. Spencer can't find
enough enjoyment from watching football, I suggest
he cover circuses, or carnivals, or burlesque shows.
