# CAMPUS OPINION
## KRUPP. THE KOP, SPEAKS 
### 
r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
I realize this message will arrive a good many days
after the storm has blown over on Bull Sessioner's
"I Don't Like it," of November G. I also write ihis to
you, and not to Bull Sessioner, because I would like
you to read it. to him, since I doubt his ability to do
this. (If he could read he would know that the words
NOT TRANSFERABLE arc not put on the Student
Body Cards for decoration.)
For as many years as I can remember, the old cry
of "Why should the B.A.C. take up my Student Body
Card if I let someone else use it to go to a game?"
has arisen. Likewise in all those years no good answer
to that question was ever given to the students. The
reason for this lack of an answer lies in the fact that
those students who know the inside of the situation are
students working for the Board. Because of their work
with the Board they are requested to let these crics
go unanswered rather than try to answer them and
get nothing but abuse thrown back at them. You see,
any sane study of the situation shows that the Board
is right and the handful of "wronged" students are
simply looking for sympathy. For many years I have
wanted to say these words. Now that I am far enough
from the Farm to insure my health, and no longer in
the employee of the 8.A.C., I feel free to do so.
First a little history on these "growling, glaring
bulls," of whom Bull Sessioner writes. Next time you
go to a game take a good look at one of them, you
might see that one of them is the chap that sits next
to you in Econ, or perhaps he's that fellow in Calc 42
who is good enough to set you on the right track on
that third problem in today's assignment. Yes, most
of them arc just Stanford students. If you think that
these fellows enjoy checking on Student Body Cards
you have another think coming, and if you think that
the B.A.C. likes the job of checking up you have an
other free one on the house. You see there are still
a few around the Farm who like to see the Stanford
Rooting Section composed of Stanford students. You
should see what the Midwestern students get in the
way of student tickets. They have a couple of sections
reserved for them, but these sections are not on the
fifty-yard line, oh, no, these sections arc on the cor
ners of the stadium at the goal posts. Also the stu
dents pay for each and every game that they wish to
attend. There arc no free games on the Student Cards.
If Bull Sessioner will take a little time out some day
and thumb through a financial report for the school,
he will find that the Board of Athletic Control does
more than its share in support of the campus. The
little the student pays for his game privileges would
not even approach the cost of the special student gate
and the reserving of the student sections.
As a closing remark let me warn Mr. Bull Sessioner
to watch his word selection. Perhaps one of his so
called "goats" will turn and get him in the end!

is right and the handful of "wronged" students are
simply looking for sympathy. For many years I have
wanted to say these words. Now that I am far enough
from the Farm to insure my health, and no longer in
the employee of the 8.A.C., I feel free to do so.
First a little history on these "growling, glaring
bulls," of whom Bull Sessioner writes. Next time you
go to a game take a good look at one of them, you
might see that one of them is the chap that sits next
to you in Econ, or perhaps he's that fellow in Calc 42
who is good enough to set you on the right track on
that third problem in today's assignment. Yes, most
of them arc just Stanford students. If you think that
these fellows enjoy checking on Student Body Cards
you have another think coming, and if you think that
the B.A.C. likes the job of checking up you have an
other free one on the house. You see there are still
a few around the Farm who like to see the Stanford
Rooting Section composed of Stanford students. You
should see what the Midwestern students get in the
way of student tickets. They have a couple of sections
reserved for them, but these sections are not on the
fifty-yard line, oh, no, these sections arc on the cor
ners of the stadium at the goal posts. Also the stu
dents pay for each and every game that they wish to
attend. There arc no free games on the Student Cards.
If Bull Sessioner will take a little time out some day
and thumb through a financial report for the school,
he will find that the Board of Athletic Control does
more than its share in support of the campus. The
little the student pays for his game privileges would
not even approach the cost of the special student gate
and the reserving of the student sections.
As a closing remark let me warn Mr. Bull Sessioner
to watch his word selection. Perhaps one of his so
called "goats" will turn and get him in the end!

r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
I realize this message will arrive a good many days
after the storm has blown over on Bull Sessioner's
"I Don't Like it," of November G. I also write ihis to
you, and not to Bull Sessioner, because I would like
you to read it. to him, since I doubt his ability to do
this. (If he could read he would know that the words
NOT TRANSFERABLE arc not put on the Student
Body Cards for decoration.)
For as many years as I can remember, the old cry
of "Why should the B.A.C. take up my Student Body
Card if I let someone else use it to go to a game?"
has arisen. Likewise in all those years no good answer
to that question was ever given to the students. The
reason for this lack of an answer lies in the fact that
those students who know the inside of the situation are
students working for the Board. Because of their work
with the Board they are requested to let these crics
go unanswered rather than try to answer them and
get nothing but abuse thrown back at them. You see,
any sane study of the situation shows that the Board
is right and the handful of "wronged" students are
simply looking for sympathy. For many years I have
wanted to say these words. Now that I am far enough
