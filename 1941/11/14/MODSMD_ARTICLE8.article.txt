# War Issue Splits Nation Wilbur Finds
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
The South is for war, the Middle
West has the "Missouri Attitude,"
find New York is scared by what
has been done, President Wilbur
observed yesterday on returning
from a two weeks' trip through the
United Slates.
Dr. Wilbur spoke and attended
meetings in Lawrence, Kans., Lin
coln, Neb., Clvieago, Washington,
D.C., and Atlanta.
"The people wanting war do not
agree when we should enter it," he
said.
WE'D CUT BRITAIN OFF
"They do not realize,' however,
that if we went to war now we'd
cut Britain's throat, for we'd use
the goods now being sent to them,"
the President explained.
"And war with Japan would be
mass insanity," declared Dr. Wilbur.
"It would force us to fight on a
double front and would be eco
nomic suicide, especially for this
part of the country," he added.
"It is most astounding that the
Big Game is now more important to
the people in San Francisco than
the fate of their city," Dr. Wilbur
said, shaking his head.
He pointed out that much of San
Francisco?s business is dependent on
trade with the Far East.
ATTENDED CONVENTION
At Lincoln, Neb., Dr. Wilbur and
Dr. Ralph H. Lutz attended the an
nual conference of the Association
of American Universities where an
entire day was devoted to "The Role
of the Universities in the National
Defense Program."
General Hershey, national direc
tor of the selective service system,
addressed the convention.
"General! Hershey expressed a
willingness to listen, but it seems it
is his business to procure soldiers,"
Dr. Wilbur reported.
"There will be a real battle to clear
up the draft policy," he continued.
With an industrial war, "trained
brains" will be needed from uni
versities, but now there is no na
tional policy to determine who
should be allowed to be trained and
where. This is the difficulty, Dr.
Wilbur explained.
STUDENTS AND DRAFT
"Will our other students be al
lowed to graduate? Nobody knows,"
he said. "We are doing our best to
see what can be done."
Dr. Wilbur talked of the situation
in the last war.
"Stanford men were in the Stu
dent Army Training Corps, studying
(i 4 per cent of the time, and devot
ing 40 per cent to army training.
We were on a four-quarter basis
and the men continued their educa
tion up until the time when I hey
went overseas,'' he said.

Dr. Ralph H. Lutz attended the an
nual conference of the Association
of American Universities where an
entire day was devoted to "The Role
of the Universities in the National
Defense Program."
General Hershey, national direc
tor of the selective service system,
addressed the convention.
"General! Hershey expressed a
willingness to listen, but it seems it
is his business to procure soldiers,"
Dr. Wilbur reported.
"There will be a real battle to clear
up the draft policy," he continued.
With an industrial war, "trained
brains" will be needed from uni
versities, but now there is no na
tional policy to determine who
should be allowed to be trained and
where. This is the difficulty, Dr.
Wilbur explained.
STUDENTS AND DRAFT
"Will our other students be al
lowed to graduate? Nobody knows,"
he said. "We are doing our best to
see what can be done."
Dr. Wilbur talked of the situation
in the last war.
"Stanford men were in the Stu
dent Army Training Corps, studying
(i 4 per cent of the time, and devot
ing 40 per cent to army training.
We were on a four-quarter basis
and the men continued their educa
tion up until the time when I hey
went overseas,'' he said.
The South is for war, the Middle
West has the "Missouri Attitude,"
find New York is scared by what
has been done, President Wilbur
observed yesterday on returning
from a two weeks' trip through the
United Slates.
Dr. Wilbur spoke and attended
meetings in Lawrence, Kans., Lin
coln, Neb., Clvieago, Washington,
D.C., and Atlanta.
"The people wanting war do not
agree when we should enter it," he
said.
WE'D CUT BRITAIN OFF
"They do not realize,' however,
that if we went to war now we'd
cut Britain's throat, for we'd use
the goods now being sent to them,"
the President explained.
"And war with Japan would be
mass insanity," declared Dr. Wilbur.
"It would force us to fight on a
double front and would be eco
nomic suicide, especially for this
part of the country," he added.
"It is most astounding that the
Big Game is now more important to
the people in San Francisco than
the fate of their city," Dr. Wilbur
said, shaking his head.
He pointed out that much of San
Francisco?s business is dependent on
trade with the Far East.
