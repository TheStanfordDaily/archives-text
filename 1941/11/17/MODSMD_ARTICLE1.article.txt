### AMIE REICHERT 
JN TIIE Battle of Russia today there
are four main fighting fronts.
They are Moscow, the Crimea, Len
ingrad, and Rostov-on-Don. On one
(the Crimea) the N;izis are making
slow, painful headway. On another
(Rostov-on-Don) they are attacking
but without decisive results. And on
two (Moscow and Leningrad) they
are being hurled back by fierce Rus
sian counterblows.
Simple arithmetic would indi
cate that all is not well with the
blitz IJ err Hitler used to dream
about as "the greatest German
victory" of the year.
No. The Russians have amazed
the world, and they continually re
peat the performance.

J what may well be the prologue
to the Nazi death rattle. "The Axis
powers," he said, "are really fighting
for bare existence, and the worries
and distress which we all must bear
in the war would pale in the face of
the inferno which would await us if
we were to lose."
II was the first time that a Nazi
bigwig had admitted the possibil
ity of a German defeat, and coin
ciding as it did with, continual re
ports from Moscow of Soviet vic
tories, it was a doubly significant
statement.
When Hitler first marched against
the Russians on June 22, the move
was hailed by news analysts, states
men and commentators as a signifi
cant turning point in the war. Many
believed that it was the beginning
of the end for Hitler and the Nazi
success.
Events since then have only
served to strengthen that belief. The
tide of World War II has turned at
last but it will take a long time to
wash back and flood the Nazis.

YESTERDAY'S reports from Rus
sia told of fierce and successful
counter-attacking in the Leningrad
and Moscow sectors, but conceded
that the situation around Kerch and
Sevastopol in the Crimea was "crit
ical."
The German reports admitted the
Russian thrusts in six places on the
Moscow front, and counter-blows
from besieged Leningrad.
The increasingly powerful Rus
sian attacks which have forced the
Germans on the defensive on two
fronts and made them retreat and
dig in, retreat and dig in.
A report received yesterday from
Wallace Carroll, veteran United
States correspondent who has been
in Russia for five months, gives a
number of important reasons to sup
port the belief that Russia can ancl
will hold out.

/ I ARF*OLL, who flew to Manila to
4 send his story so that it would
be uncensorcd, drew the following
conclusions:
(I) The German general stafT so
far has failed to achieve its avowed
objective — the complete destruc
tion of the Red Army. (2) Despite
heavy losses of men and materiel
the Russian Army remains a strong
defensive force, probably the sec
ond best in the world. (3) The
Red Air Force still remains a pow
erful fighting organization.
(4) Stalin is determined to de
feat Hitler and his country is sol
idly behind him. (5) The Germans
will probably have to spend this
winter on the frozen Russian
plains, ((>) The fact that the Red
Army continues to exist as an ef
fective fighting force interferes
with any plans the Germans may
have had to strike southward dur
ing this winter.
Add to this the report in last
week's Time which stated that the
93 per cent of the U.S.S.R. which
the Russians still hold is rich in
natural resources and industrial
plants, and the fact that aid to the
Red Army from Britain and the
U.S. increases daily and you have a
pretty hopeful picture, despite the
heavy losses Russia has already
sustained.

A report received yesterday from

/ I ARF*OLL, who flew to Manila to
4 send his story so that it would
be uncensorcd, drew the following
conclusions:
(I) The German general stafT so
far has failed to achieve its avowed
objective — the complete destruc
tion of the Red Army. (2) Despite
heavy losses of men and materiel
the Russian Army remains a strong
defensive force, probably the sec
ond best in the world. (3) The
Red Air Force still remains a pow
erful fighting organization.
(4) Stalin is determined to de
feat Hitler and his country is sol
idly behind him. (5) The Germans
will probably have to spend this
winter on the frozen Russian
plains, ((>) The fact that the Red
Army continues to exist as an ef
fective fighting force interferes
with any plans the Germans may
have had to strike southward dur
ing this winter.
Add to this the report in last
week's Time which stated that the
93 per cent of the U.S.S.R. which
the Russians still hold is rich in
natural resources and industrial
plants, and the fact that aid to the
Red Army from Britain and the
U.S. increases daily and you have a
pretty hopeful picture, despite the
heavy losses Russia has already
sustained.
JN TIIE Battle of Russia today there
are four main fighting fronts.
They are Moscow, the Crimea, Len
ingrad, and Rostov-on-Don. On one
(the Crimea) the N;izis are making
slow, painful headway. On another
(Rostov-on-Don) they are attacking
but without decisive results. And on
two (Moscow and Leningrad) they
are being hurled back by fierce Rus
sian counterblows.
Simple arithmetic would indi
cate that all is not well with the
blitz IJ err Hitler used to dream
about as "the greatest German
victory" of the year.
No. The Russians have amazed
the world, and they continually re
peat the performance.

ing this winter.
Add to this the report in last
week's Time which stated that the
93 per cent of the U.S.S.R. which
the Russians still hold is rich in
natural resources and industrial
plants, and the fact that aid to the
Red Army from Britain and the
U.S. increases daily and you have a
pretty hopeful picture, despite the
heavy losses Russia has already
sustained.
JN TIIE Battle of Russia today there
are four main fighting fronts.
They are Moscow, the Crimea, Len
ingrad, and Rostov-on-Don. On one
(the Crimea) the N;izis are making
slow, painful headway. On another
(Rostov-on-Don) they are attacking
but without decisive results. And on
two (Moscow and Leningrad) they
are being hurled back by fierce Rus
sian counterblows.
Simple arithmetic would indi
cate that all is not well with the
blitz IJ err Hitler used to dream
about as "the greatest German
victory" of the year.
No. The Russians have amazed
the world, and they continually re
peat the performance.

I AST week Dr. ooebbcis voiced
J what may well be the prologue
to the Nazi death rattle. "The Axis
powers," he said, "are really fighting
for bare existence, and the worries
and distress which we all must bear
in the war would pale in the face of
the inferno which would await us if
we were to lose."
II was the first time that a Nazi
bigwig had admitted the possibil
ity of a German defeat, and coin
ciding as it did with, continual re
ports from Moscow of Soviet vic
tories, it was a doubly significant
statement.
When Hitler first marched against
the Russians on June 22, the move
was hailed by news analysts, states
men and commentators as a signifi
cant turning point in the war. Many
believed that it was the beginning
of the end for Hitler and the Nazi
success.
Events since then have only
served to strengthen that belief. The
tide of World War II has turned at
last but it will take a long time to
wash back and flood the Nazis.

YESTERDAY'S reports from Rus
sia told of fierce and successful
counter-attacking in the Leningrad
and Moscow sectors, but conceded
that the situation around Kerch and
Sevastopol in the Crimea was "crit
ical."
The German reports admitted the
Russian thrusts in six places on the
Moscow front, and counter-blows
from besieged Leningrad.
The increasingly powerful Rus
sian attacks which have forced the
Germans on the defensive on two
fronts and made them retreat and
dig in, retreat and dig in.
A report received yesterday from
Wallace Carroll, veteran United
States correspondent who has been
in Russia for five months, gives a
number of important reasons to sup
port the belief that Russia can ancl
will hold out.

/ I ARF*OLL, who flew to Manila to
4 send his story so that it would
be uncensorcd, drew the following
conclusions:
(I) The German general stafT so
far has failed to achieve its avowed
objective — the complete destruc
tion of the Red Army. (2) Despite
heavy losses of men and materiel
the Russian Army remains a strong
defensive force, probably the sec
ond best in the world. (3) The
Red Air Force still remains a pow
erful fighting organization.
(4) Stalin is determined to de
feat Hitler and his country is sol
idly behind him. (5) The Germans
will probably have to spend this
winter on the frozen Russian
plains, ((>) The fact that the Red
Army continues to exist as an ef
fective fighting force interferes
with any plans the Germans may
have had to strike southward dur
ing this winter.
Add to this the report in last
week's Time which stated that the
93 per cent of the U.S.S.R. which
the Russians still hold is rich in
natural resources and industrial
plants, and the fact that aid to the
Red Army from Britain and the
U.S. increases daily and you have a
pretty hopeful picture, despite the
heavy losses Russia has already
sustained.
