# Navy Reveals Capture Of Axis Merchantman In Atlantic on Nov. 6
## Ship Flying American Flag Seized As Her Captain Ignites Explosions In Attempt to Scuttle Own Vessel 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. lf» (UP). —An Axis-owned merchant ship flying
the United States Hag was captured hy a U.S. cruiser on Nov. 6 In equa
torial waters of the Atlantic after two explosions had been touched off on
the vessel, the Navy Department announced tonight.
Fate of the vessel's crew was not disclosed, but it was assumed they

were prisoners.
Members of the cruiser's crew are
bringing the unidentified merchant
man to a port within jurisdiction of
a United States court where it will
be turned over to a U.S. marshal and
held for Justice Department action
on charges of sailing under false
colors.
The navy did not reveal the names
of the cruiser or the merchant ship,
but did say that the latter was owned
by "subjects of one of the Axiii
powers."
SECOND SUCCESS
So far as public disclosure is con
cerned, this is the navy's second suc
cess in the "Battle of the Atlantic"
since President Roosevelt issued his
"shoot first" orders to the Atlantic
patrol. On Oct. 11 the navy an
nounced that a "U.S. naval vessel"
seized a Nazi-operated radio sta
tion on the coast of Greenland, its
supply steamer and 22 Norwegian
personnel. The 22, including one
woman, are now in Boston awaiting
government action.
The President has announced a
policy of not revealing Axis subma
rine and raider victims of the patrol.
In comparison, one U.S. destroyer
has been sunk; a naval tanker and
another destroyer have been crip
pled by U-boats; a destroyer has en
gaged in a bloodless clash with a
German submarine; and 11 Ameri
can-owned merchant ships have been
sunk and one damaged.
SIGHTED AT DAWN
The unidentified cruiser, the navy
said, sighted the merchantman about
dawn and was "suspicious of its
appearance." The cargo boat was
ordered to "heave ty," and the cruis
er lowered a boat and sent an offi
cer to investigate.
The merchant ship immediately
hoisted a signal saying:
"Send boats for passengers. I am
sinking."
Two explosions then rocked the
ship.
"The cruiser put a salvage party
aboard and after some hours suc
ceeded in stopping the leaks caused
by the explosions and in getting the
engines running," the announcement
said.
YATES COMMENTS
In a statement issued late last,
night, Rear Admiral Yates Stirling,
Jr., U.S.N., retired, said: "It should
be emphasized that there was noth
ing illegal or irregular, from a naval
war-time viewpoint, in the Axis
skipper's act. It is recognized that in
war-time a belligerent has the right
to use such efforts at deception pro
vided he lowers his false flag and
hoists his own before opening fire.
In this case the Axis ship did not
open fire and hence was not required
to hoist its own flag.
"The fact the effort to destroy the
captured ship failed would indicate
Italian rather than German teaman
ship. A German skipper, in my opin
ion, would have made more careful
preparations.
"Our own navy is greatly to b«.»
commended for the capture. It shows
our naval patrol really is effective
that it is on the job and able to spot
what might have been a clever job."
The Navy's official description of
the incident did not disclose the
fate of the crew of the ship or its
size.

"shoot first" orders to the Atlantic
patrol. On Oct. 11 the navy an
nounced that a "U.S. naval vessel"
seized a Nazi-operated radio sta
tion on the coast of Greenland, its
supply steamer and 22 Norwegian
personnel. The 22, including one
woman, are now in Boston awaiting
government action.
The President has announced a
policy of not revealing Axis subma
rine and raider victims of the patrol.
In comparison, one U.S. destroyer
has been sunk; a naval tanker and
another destroyer have been crip
pled by U-boats; a destroyer has en
gaged in a bloodless clash with a
German submarine; and 11 Ameri
can-owned merchant ships have been
sunk and one damaged.
SIGHTED AT DAWN
The unidentified cruiser, the navy
said, sighted the merchantman about
dawn and was "suspicious of its
appearance." The cargo boat was
ordered to "heave ty," and the cruis
er lowered a boat and sent an offi
cer to investigate.
The merchant ship immediately
hoisted a signal saying:
"Send boats for passengers. I am
sinking."
Two explosions then rocked the
ship.
"The cruiser put a salvage party
aboard and after some hours suc
ceeded in stopping the leaks caused
by the explosions and in getting the
engines running," the announcement
said.
YATES COMMENTS
In a statement issued late last,
night, Rear Admiral Yates Stirling,
Jr., U.S.N., retired, said: "It should
be emphasized that there was noth
ing illegal or irregular, from a naval
war-time viewpoint, in the Axis
skipper's act. It is recognized that in
war-time a belligerent has the right
to use such efforts at deception pro
vided he lowers his false flag and
hoists his own before opening fire.
In this case the Axis ship did not
open fire and hence was not required
to hoist its own flag.
"The fact the effort to destroy the
captured ship failed would indicate
Italian rather than German teaman
ship. A German skipper, in my opin
ion, would have made more careful
preparations.
"Our own navy is greatly to b«.»
commended for the capture. It shows

that it is on the job and able to spot
what might have been a clever job."

WASHINGTON, Nov. lf» (UP). —An Axis-owned merchant ship flying
the United States Hag was captured hy a U.S. cruiser on Nov. 6 In equa
torial waters of the Atlantic after two explosions had been touched off on
the vessel, the Navy Department announced tonight.
Fate of the vessel's crew was not disclosed, but it was assumed they

were prisoners.
Members of the cruiser's crew are
bringing the unidentified merchant
man to a port within jurisdiction of
a United States court where it will
be turned over to a U.S. marshal and
held for Justice Department action
on charges of sailing under false
colors.
