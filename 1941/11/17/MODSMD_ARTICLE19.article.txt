# Winter, CBS News Analyst, declares Hitler Will Lose
## Commentator Says U.S.-Japanese War Inevitable at Talk in Palo Alto 
### JULIE FREASE 
William Winter, CBS news analyst,
i not an optimist but a realist when
he comments nightly over the air on
the present international scene.
"I've been criticized for having
what appears an optimistic tone, but
it's really realistic. I say Hitler will
lose the war," he declared a few
minutes before addressing a large
audience of Palo Altans last Thurs
day evening at the local high school.

For six years, Mr. Winter has
studied wire reports as CBS news
< ditor. Previously, he studied law
for several years and passed the bar
examination. According to him, "the
valuf of college is that it teaches
you to learn."
His tone of optimism, or rather of j
realism, is brought out when he de- j
clared that even if Russia wins, we j
> till have nothing to fear as "Rus- j
sia has never been an economic i
threat, but if Hitler wins we would- j
n't have a chance."
J>l.l ENDING AN IDEAL
Hi* answered the questioning title
of his address, "What Are We De
fending?" when he said, "We are
defending a way of life —an ideal."
"Compare the German cry of
'Tleil Hitler' (which means just Heil
Hitler) with our cry of government
of the people, by the people and for
the people," said Mr. Winter.
His realistic optimism branched
out when he explained that at least
Hitler has lost a gamble with Rus

sia for the Russians aren't amateur
foes and understand the German
blitz, for they learned the system of
the blitz when the Germans devel
oped it during the 'twenties. The
Russians also benefit from the lack
of a fifth column, guerilla warfare,
and splendid morale.
U.S. WOKE UP IN TIME
He went on to say that democra
cies woke up too late to defend their
liberty but that the United States
has fortunately awakened in time.
Since then, the U.S. has pledged aid
to the British and has stopped sell
ing airplanes and fuel to Japan.
Concerning Japan, he emphatically
stated: "War with Japan is inevi
table. The only difference in opin
ion is where we are going to fight.
We've built up the Japanese air
force and now we'll have to destroy
| it!"
In conclusion he pointed out "our
I cause is not ours alone but of all the
little peoples of the world. What
happened to them can happen to us."

We've built up the Japanese air
force and now we'll have to destroy

I cause is not ours alone but of all the
little peoples of the world. What

William Winter, CBS news analyst,
i not an optimist but a realist when
he comments nightly over the air on
the present international scene.
"I've been criticized for having
what appears an optimistic tone, but
it's really realistic. I say Hitler will
lose the war," he declared a few
minutes before addressing a large
audience of Palo Altans last Thurs
day evening at the local high school.

For six years, Mr. Winter has
studied wire reports as CBS news
< ditor. Previously, he studied law
for several years and passed the bar
examination. According to him, "the
valuf of college is that it teaches
you to learn."
His tone of optimism, or rather of j
realism, is brought out when he de- j
clared that even if Russia wins, we j
> till have nothing to fear as "Rus- j
sia has never been an economic i
threat, but if Hitler wins we would- j
n't have a chance."
J>l.l ENDING AN IDEAL
Hi* answered the questioning title
of his address, "What Are We De
fending?" when he said, "We are
defending a way of life —an ideal."
"Compare the German cry of
'Tleil Hitler' (which means just Heil
Hitler) with our cry of government
of the people, by the people and for
the people," said Mr. Winter.
His realistic optimism branched
out when he explained that at least
Hitler has lost a gamble with Rus

sia for the Russians aren't amateur
foes and understand the German
blitz, for they learned the system of
the blitz when the Germans devel
oped it during the 'twenties. The
Russians also benefit from the lack
of a fifth column, guerilla warfare,
and splendid morale.
U.S. WOKE UP IN TIME
He went on to say that democra
cies woke up too late to defend their
liberty but that the United States
has fortunately awakened in time.
Since then, the U.S. has pledged aid
to the British and has stopped sell
ing airplanes and fuel to Japan.
Concerning Japan, he emphatically
stated: "War with Japan is inevi
table. The only difference in opin
ion is where we are going to fight.

force and now we'll have to destroy
| it!"
