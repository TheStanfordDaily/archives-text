(old everyone else
j that the Washington State Cou
gars were going to be a very hard
team to beat. Yes, but, truthfully,
, most everyone failed to believe
those words. So everybody was sur-
I prised.
Stanford's Rose Bowl hopes drop
| pod to gloomy depths, because now
I the standings in the Pacific Coast
| Conference look like this:
Won Lost
Stanford ".."..... ..... .. 4 2
Oregon State 4 2
Washington State 4 .'5
| Washington :] 2
Oregon :{ 3
U.C.L.A :{ 4

1 U.S.C 2 3
[ California 2 4
The team that shares Ihe top spot
in the loop with the Indians is none
other than the Lon Steiner-eoached
eleven that gave the Big Red Ma
chine its first defeat in two years
just five weeks ago at Corvallis.
which, of course, gives the Beavers
Â» moral edge.
The Beavers have a pushover next
week in their game with Montana,
although you never can tell just
what will happen in football games
this year. The big chance for the
j Indians to remain on the path to
Pasadena comes on Nov. 29, when
Stanford plays California here and
Oregon State takes on Tex Oliver's
Oregon Ducks at Eugene.
If the Ducks win and Stanford
beats Cal. Clark Shaughnessy's out
fit is in, with five wins and two
j losses as against O.S.C.'s five wins
{ ind three losses (and one of those
Beaver victories will be over lowly
i Montana), since only Washington
I could rate high, and the Indians de
feated the Huskies. If the Ducks
win and the Bears down the Indians,
the thing will look ljjte this, provided
Washington defeats Oregon and
U.S.C.:
Won Lost
Washington (5 2
Stanford 4 3
Oregon Slate 4 3
Oregon 4 4
So (he whole thing boils down to
this: Stanford has to defeat the Uni
versity of California Bears in the
Big Game and Oregon has to knock
over Oregon State if the Indians are
to go Bowling again.
