# Frosh to Cast Ballots For Class Officers
## 14 Men, 21 Women Vie for President, Secretary-Treasurer 
### 
Freshmen will trek to (lie polls to
morrow to elect their class president
and their secretary-treasurer for this
school year, Jim White, chairman of
the Board of Elections, announced
yesterday. Ballots and ballot boxes
will be in both Encina and Roble
Halls, and the time of voting will be
announced in tomorrow's Daily.
Fourteen freshmen will vie for the
position of presidency and 21 women
will be running for secretary
treasurer.
PREFERENTIAL SYSTEM
White asks that voters remember
and consider the fact that this is a
"preference" type of balloting.
"The man you name as second
choice and so on down the list
should not be considered as a vote
against the first man, as these votes
will not be counted unless no first
choice man shows a majority in the
tabulations," he explained.
"In other words," he added, "in
place of voting 'for' or 'against' a
man as in one type of election, you
list them according to your prefer
ence."
In a caucus held at the end of
last week, Roblc women cut down
the number of secretary-treasurer
candidates from 19 to 4. But since
the caucus was held after the dead
line of declinations, all original 19
Roble names will appear on the bal
lot, with two non-Roble candidates
increasing the total to 21.
Aspirants for the presidency are
Bill Allen, Dick Arnold, Bill Dodd.
Bill Eberlo, Jerry Fine, Gerald
Frank, Clark Hunter, Neele John
ston, Ham de Jong, Bill Reeder, Bob
Sears, Bill Spragins, John Thayer,
j and Robert Ullman.
ROBLE CANDIDATES
Four candidates for secretary
, treasurer chosen by the Roble cau
cus are Luana Forkner, Barbara Hill,
Sue Price, and Anne Wcndling. Two
j from other halls include Margie
! Duhig, Union, and Jo Sawyer,
! Casita.
The candidates will be introduced
| to the voters at general meetings to
j night at both Roble and Encina.
Previous plans to honor the candi
dates at a dinner at Roble Hall were
cancelled, according to President
| Sylvia Berry, because of the
large number of candidates. Instead,
the presidential candidates will go
I to the women's dormitory after din
: ner to attend the general meeting.
Then they will drive the secretary
treasurer hopefuls to Encina to be
! introduced there.
