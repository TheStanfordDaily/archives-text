# Field Goal Beats Kappa Sigs; Firemen Win Cup for Keeps
## 
### DON SELBY 
The fact that they were not allowed to play in the Stanford Stadium as
scheduled didn't keep the contestants for the intramural football crown
for 1941 from turning in one of the most spectacular, thrill-a-minutc foot
ball games in mural annals Saturday afternoon, as Monte Pfyl and his
Firehouse hoys rode over Kappa Sigma, !)-7, by virtue of My land tripe's

field goal from the 28-yard line in
the closing minutes of play.
The victory pulled the Blaze Chas
ers through their third straight un
defeated season, giving them their
third grid trophy and a permanent
hold on the perpetual cup.
PFYL SCORES
Alter the kick-off it took only ten
plays for the Pfyl outfit to tally, with
Monte starting the fireworks with a
pass for a 20-yard gain to Frank.
Monte's four-yard run down the
middle, a penalty against the Row
men, an incomplete pass, and another
drive through the center by Monte
gave the Firemen a first down on
the Kappa Sig 27-yard line.
Monte then ran left end for two
gained and Came back on the next
play to ramble around the other
flank for 15 yards and a first down
on the Kappa Sig ten. But on the
following play, the Firehouse was
found guilty of holding and penalized
back to the 2G. Again it was Monte
Pfyl, this lime running on an in
tended pass play, sneaking right
down the slot as the blockers moved
the rushers to the outside, and go
ing to the two-yard line. He lost
one at center but passed complete to
Frank Pfyl in the end zone after
faking a run.
KAPPA SIGS SCORE
After the ensuing kick-ofT, Jack
Harris, the fullback in Kappa Sig's
"T formation, tossed an incomplete
pass, but Wells took over and passed
to Ken Casey for eight gained to the
Kappa Sig 32 and followed with a
pitch to Henzie for 12 yards and a
first down. The Rowmen were on
the march.
It was Wells to Casey, an incom
plete forward, and another pass
from Wells to Henzie, who lateraled
to Casey, the play finally being
brought to a halt on the Firehouse
•10. After two incomplete passes,
Wells hit his mark, Henzie, for sev
en gained. And then the "T" forma
tion exploded. From his close-up
position behind center Wells took
the ball from center, flipped a little
lateral out to Casey as the latter

moved forward from his left half
post and, aided by a devastating
block on Monte Pfyl by John
Brooke, Casey rambled to the Fire
house two-and-a-half-yard line.
ROWMEN TIE ITPl T P GAME
Wells started an end run, straight
ened up, pitched to Brooke right
over center in the end zone, and the
Kappa Sigs had tied up the ball
game. With Harris holding, Henzie
kicked true for the extra point,
leaving the score Kappa Sig 7, Fire
house 6. And you knew that those
boys were really playing a ball
game.
But the Firemen still had an
other card up their collective sleeve.
With Monte holding on the 28-yard
line, Cripe calmly booted a perfect
field goal with minutes left to play.
And that was the ball game.
For, although the Rowmen came
back strong with a kick-oft" run
back to the Firehouse 38, time ran
out before they could do much. Be
sides, Frank intercepted a third
down pass as the whistle blew to
end the fray.

Firehouse hoys rode over Kappa Sigma, !)-7, by virtue of My land tripe's

field goal from the 28-yard line in

Alter the kick-off it took only ten
plays for the Pfyl outfit to tally, with
Monte starting the fireworks with a
pass for a 20-yard gain to Frank.
Monte's four-yard run down the
middle, a penalty against the Row
men, an incomplete pass, and another
drive through the center by Monte
gave the Firemen a first down on
the Kappa Sig 27-yard line.
Monte then ran left end for two
gained and Came back on the next
play to ramble around the other
flank for 15 yards and a first down
on the Kappa Sig ten. But on the
following play, the Firehouse was
found guilty of holding and penalized
back to the 2G. Again it was Monte
Pfyl, this lime running on an in
tended pass play, sneaking right
down the slot as the blockers moved
the rushers to the outside, and go

one at center but passed complete to
Frank Pfyl in the end zone after
faking a run.

Brooke, Casey rambled to the Fire
house two-and-a-half-yard line.
ROWMEN TIE ITPl T P GAME
Wells started an end run, straight
ened up, pitched to Brooke right
over center in the end zone, and the
Kappa Sigs had tied up the ball
game. With Harris holding, Henzie
kicked true for the extra point,
leaving the score Kappa Sig 7, Fire
house 6. And you knew that those
boys were really playing a ball
game.
But the Firemen still had an
other card up their collective sleeve.
With Monte holding on the 28-yard
line, Cripe calmly booted a perfect
field goal with minutes left to play.
And that was the ball game.
For, although the Rowmen came
back strong with a kick-oft" run
back to the Firehouse 38, time ran
out before they could do much. Be
sides, Frank intercepted a third
down pass as the whistle blew to
end the fray.
