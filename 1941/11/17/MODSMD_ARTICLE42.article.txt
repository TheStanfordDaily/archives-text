Editor's Note: The following address was
delivered late last month by John N. Brooks,
Jr., Chairman, The Daily Princetonian, Prince
ton University.)

I AM not a member of the Fight for Freedom
Committee, and I do not attempt to speak
for American youth. I can only give you an idea
of what goes on in the minds of a small repre
sentation of American youth at Princeton Uni
versity; and I can offer my own thoughts as
those of one young American ignorant as youth
must be, realistic in my hopes for my own
future and idealistic in my hopes for the future
of a nation and a world . . .

. . . the problem facing America is far from
simple. I and many of my associates demand
a more positive goal than merely keeping Hitler
from our shores. I am firm in my conviction
that the primary goal of American policy must
be not the defeat of Hitler in itself, but the
establishment of an orderly international so
ciety living in accordance with the democratic
way of life, a society in which the cataclysm of
world war will never be permitted to recur. The
defeat of Hitler is a necessary condition to the
attainment of this ideal; as long as he and his
legions are on the loose, durable peace is an
idle dream.

There are those who cry, "One thing at a
time! Let's win this war, and worry about world
order afterward!" Haven't we learned the dis
aster of that line of reasoning? Woodrow Wil
son went to war in 1917 wanting lasting peace;
but the American people were clamoring for
victory. They got the victory; they failed to
get the peace. That is why we have to fight
today.

Now, rather than only after the victory has
been won, is the time for emphasis on peace
aims. We must study the tragic lesson of Ver
sailles and after; we must discover how to profit
from the mistakes made then. And though the
machinery of world peace cannot be exactly de
cided until after the victory, the determination
and will of America to accept its post-war inter
national responsibilities must be built up before
it is too late.
This is a fight not only for freedom, but for its
corollaries, peace and security. America lost its
chance for them once; we must not fail again.
