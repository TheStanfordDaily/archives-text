RESIDENTS of Roble and Encina Halls found
a slim, fire-hued magazine under their doors
yesterday morning, and when they inspected it,
it proved to be the long-promised frosh picture
book. The title page said, "Know Your Fresh
men."
Last spring the publication was just a line on
Ex Committee's agenda, put there by the bound
lessly enthusiastic Norm Ross. It was Norm's
baby. Ex Committee looked the infant over care
fully, chucked it under the chin, and decided
to adopt it.
And, under the continued guidance of Editor
Norm Ross, it has proved to be a respectable
child.
The first issue, however, is indicative of nor
mal growing pains. As it stands, the book con
tains valuable clues to the identities of frosh.

The pictures will have to be sharpened up con
siderably, however, before a similar book will
be an effective instrument for unquestionably
establishing frosh identities.
This fact should not detract from the credit due
Editor Norm Ross and his able assistants for pub
lication of the book. Rounding up the frosh to
have their pictures taken, and assembling the
photographs in an order suitable for publication
are not tasks to be dismissed lightly.
The frosh picture book is valuable in its
present form. It is potentially even more val
uable.
For the idea and for its creditable execution,
bouquets to the editor and staff of "Know Your
Freshmen."—Rosemarie Mullany
