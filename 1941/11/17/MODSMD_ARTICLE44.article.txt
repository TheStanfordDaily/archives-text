HERE are the interesting, but very much
doubtful, German statistics on British and
Nazi plane losses over Germany and occupied
Europe during the first 10 months of 1941.
Berlin, alias Goebbels, claims the British lost
2,501 planes, including 1,309 bombers, while
Germany lost only 602.
Uh huh.
Over the English Channel alone, the aggres
sors add, 1,590 British planes and only 228 Ger
man planes have been shot down since the
British launched their "non-stop offensive"
June 22.
Yep, sure thing. Of these, 820 British fight
ers and 77 German fighters were said to have
been destroyed in air battles. You bet.
It was William L. Shirer who, in his famous
Berlin Diary, said that German claims of plane
losses are absohate fiction.â€”Harold Shafer
