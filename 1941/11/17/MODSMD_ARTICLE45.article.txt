# BULL SESSION

### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
LAST SATURDAY AFTERNOON

j ''HE Indians have been temporarily knockcd out of
the Rose Bowl again, but it took the Curse of the
Palouse, about fifteen inspired iron men from Wash
ington State, and three or four bad breaks in the
second half to do it. But don't cancel all those New
Year's parties yet. For some reason, I still think we
are going to end up in Pasadena. All we have to do
is pray that Oregon beats Oregon State. It wouldn't
be a bad idea if we sent part of our rooters up there
to pull the Ducks through. Anyway we still have a
chance.
One encouraging thing about the game was the way
little A1 Cole stepped into the driver's seat and engi
neered our second touchdown. He took over with the
ball on the Cougar 21, and three plays later lie had
run and passed and steered the Indians over the goal.
The little Scooter has been waiting a long time for
his chance and he took it and came through. Next
year we may be losing Prince Albert, but King Cole
will be back.

pOR years Stanford rooters have been chided for
their complacency in the stands. It was always said
that Stanford is all right when they are winning, but
when the team is behind, they lose interest and start
playing bridge or talking about dates. Last Saturday's
spirit should stop all such talk. When the team came
on the field in the second half trailing 7-0, there was a
sudden, magnetic surge of spirit, that swept the en
tire section. No one told the rooters to stamp and
holler on every play, there was just a spontaneous
burst of spirit that grew louder and louder. And with
one minute to go, no one had given up hope, no one
had quit the team. Everyone was standing and
cheering.

J SUPPOSE that a lot of people think it silly to got
so excited over "just a game." I think so because
there are always a few who sit in the stands and
look at mad hollerers like myself, as if they thought
we were crazy. I can't help thinking that they arc
missing a lot. Of course it's just a game, and of course
it really isn't important. But there are few things in
this world that are important. I think it best to act
like things are important, to attach importance and sig
nificance to trivial things, so that the whole thing
will be more interesting and worth while. For if we
didn't do that, if we didn't think anything was im
portant, there wouldn't be anything to live for, and
when there isn't anything to live for, the best thing is
to be dead. I think that almost everything should be
considered as being important, because the more im
portant things there are, the more fun it is, the more
there is to think about, the more there is to hope for,
the more there is to cheer for and the less reason there
is to die. So don't think it below your dignity to get
excited and holler over just a football game. It's
important.

r jpHE band is always in line for a lot of criticism as
is everyone and everything. I don't think it par
ticularly inspirational or appropriate to play "Way
Down Upon the Swanee River" on a day like last Sat
urday, but I did think that the little stunt they put
on during the half was fine, snappy and, as far as I
know, original. And everyone wants to know who
the round guy in the red jacket is. He seemed to be
the best of the yell leaders who tried out.
