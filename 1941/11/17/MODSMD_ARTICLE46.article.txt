they mean business

r JHHE EDITOR, SIR:
If the prof who plays the tintinabulating bells on
Sunday afternoons thought that the students were kid
ding about the ecstatic notes of the bells bothering a
study session, they are bound to get a surprise in the
near future. The whole group of Library students
will climb to the top of the War Libe and throw the
melodic pest to his doom.
Just a warning!

THANK VOl

r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
I would like to thank the Stanford student body
for (heir generous support of the Red Cross Drive this
year. My sincerest thanks to Nancy Haskins. Harry
Morgan, Emily Franks. Jack Euphrat. Ann Brokaw,
Bob Crary. Margaret Huston and Joe McKeliar. who
did a marvelous job as subchairmen, to the workers,
and to the Daily for the excellent articles.
Our collections this year totaled over $1400, which
was beyond all expectations, the goal being $1150. It
is a pleasure to know that the student body realizes
the potency of the Red Cross in all relief work both
at home and abroad.
Bess Paulsen,
Chairman Red Cross Drive
