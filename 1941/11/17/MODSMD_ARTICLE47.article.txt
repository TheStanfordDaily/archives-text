# Bette Davis, Superb Cast Play 'Foxes'
## 
### 
TIIK LITTLE FOXES, now play
ing at the Fox-Stanford Theater in
Palo Alto.
Mr. Samuel Goldwyn may murder
the English language, but he does
know a good thing when he sees it.
And it is he whom we have to thank
for the screen version of Lillian
Hellman's fine play "The Little
Foxes."
Superbly directed by able William
Wyler, magnificently mounted by
Art Director Stephen Goosen, and
performed by an excellent cast, the
picture though a bit slow in spots
may easily be ranked among the
year's best.
BETTE DAVIS AGAIN GOOD
In the role of ruthless, grasping
Regina Giddens, Bette Davis does a
splendid job. She manages to make
Regina's hardness convincing, and
very nicely works in the essential
coarseness of the character without
overdoing it.
However, the fact that Miss Davis
is obviously imitating Tallulah
Bankhead, who created the part on
the stage, and not doing it half so
well, rather dims her glory.
N.Y. CAST GETS HONORS
Top acting honors go to Patricia
Collinge of the original New York
cast in the role of Birdie, one of the
victims of the "little foxes." In her
hands Birdie is touchingly pathetic;
she never allows her to become tire
some, which would be only too easy.
Regina's rapacious brothers, the
other two foxes, are excellently
played by Charles Dingle and Jesse
Reid, also of the original cast. The
rest of the actors, Herbert Marshall,
Teresa Wright, and Richard Carlson,
are also very fine. —Livingston
