# Cards Need Oregon's Help To Climb Back on Bowl Path
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Stanford will not go to the Rose Bowl without the help of Montana or Oregon, if Stan
ford goes to the Rose Bowl at all. This is the situation after Washington State's 14-to-13
victory Saturday. The 1940 Indians earned their way to Pasadena with help from no one,
but they were a v/onder team. No wonder team was Saturday's Card aggregation.
There were factors, many factors. No breaks, poor tackling, two terrific ends, Susoeff

Gentry, a shifting defense,
I loss of Kmetovic, seven previous
weeks of hard football, not to men
tion a superb Cougar team, they
all ganged up on the poor li'l Indian. I
COACH CLARK PREDICTS
Coach Clark Shaughnessy said
that he did not have a push-button
team this year —a team which could ■
score at will against anyone. He;
was right. He said that the Indians
would have to score 27 points Sat
urday, or get beaten. They didn't,
so they were, so he was light again.
He said Friday that the team would
j have to come out of its lethargy, or
they would lose the game. They
didn't, so they did, so he was right
again.
The contest for top honors in the
Pacific Coast Conference football
race is now a tie between Oregon
State and Stanford with Washing
ton close behind. The Beavers have
won four conference games against
two losses, and have only to defeat
Montana and Oregon in the next
two week-ends to win the cham
pionship and the Rose Bowl bid.
Stanford also has four league wins
to two defeats. However, one of
their defeats was at the hands of
Oregon Stale, so, in ease of a tie in
the final conference standings, the
vote would go to the Beavers. Only
one game remains on the Stanford
schedule—the Big Game, as it is
called, or the California game.
Washington has three conference
wins to two losses with Oregon and
U.S.C. still unplayed; but. like Stan
ford, Washington was defeated by
O.S.C. in the game between the
two schools, so the Huskies have
slim hopes.
SEWELL MAKES DIFFERENCE
Although Billy Sewell, who has
received much mention for Ail-
American honors, aid not look like
the greatest football player ever to
grace the Stanford stadium, in fact
he barely outshone his own substi
tute, Jay Stoves, in the final reck
oning, it was Sewell who made the
difference between the two teams, at
least the scoreboard difference.
It was Sewell who had the pres
ence of mind to pick up the loose
ball, which was rolling around the
W.S.C. backfield after Milt Vucinich
had blocked Captain Joe Beckman's
try for point following the first Cou
gar touchdown, and run it over the
goal for the point.
The Indian team and rooters alike,
remembering that the Cougars had
piled up a touchdown lead in the
last year's game also, were not too
worried, since it was only the first
quarter, and everybody knows that
you can't keep Kmetovic, Arm
strong, Faweett, and Albert's passes
bottled up for long.
Duiing the second quarter W.S.C.
didn't bottle up one of Albert's
passes, a long one to Kmetovic for
a score. The conversion was just
wide, but what did it matter with
three or four more Indian touch
downs in the offing.
THE BREAKS
A few bad breaks, plus a leg in
jury to Kmetovic, postponed those
three or four touchdowns until it
was 100 late. Only one of them was
scored during the time allotted for
the game. A1 Cole was quarter
backing the team during their score,
while Albert was regaining his
breath on the bench.
That final touchdown was inade
quate since a fumble, a penalty, and
hard driving by Bob Kennedy, Cou
gar fullback, had already netted the
visitors from the Palouse another
score.

Coach Clark Shaughnessy said
that he did not have a push-button
team this year —a team which could ■
score at will against anyone. He;
was right. He said that the Indians
would have to score 27 points Sat

The contest for top honors in the
Pacific Coast Conference football
race is now a tie between Oregon
State and Stanford with Washing
ton close behind. The Beavers have
won four conference games against
two losses, and have only to defeat
Montana and Oregon in the next
two week-ends to win the cham
pionship and the Rose Bowl bid.
Stanford also has four league wins
to two defeats. However, one of
their defeats was at the hands of
Oregon Stale, so, in ease of a tie in
the final conference standings, the
vote would go to the Beavers. Only
one game remains on the Stanford
schedule—the Big Game, as it is
called, or the California game.
Washington has three conference
wins to two losses with Oregon and
U.S.C. still unplayed; but. like Stan
ford, Washington was defeated by
O.S.C. in the game between the
two schools, so the Huskies have
slim hopes.
SEWELL MAKES DIFFERENCE
Although Billy Sewell, who has
received much mention for Ail-
American honors, aid not look like
the greatest football player ever to
grace the Stanford stadium, in fact
he barely outshone his own substi
tute, Jay Stoves, in the final reck
oning, it was Sewell who made the
difference between the two teams, at
least the scoreboard difference.
It was Sewell who had the pres
ence of mind to pick up the loose
ball, which was rolling around the
W.S.C. backfield after Milt Vucinich
had blocked Captain Joe Beckman's
try for point following the first Cou
gar touchdown, and run it over the
goal for the point.
The Indian team and rooters alike,
remembering that the Cougars had
piled up a touchdown lead in the
last year's game also, were not too
worried, since it was only the first
quarter, and everybody knows that
you can't keep Kmetovic, Arm
strong, Faweett, and Albert's passes
bottled up for long.
Duiing the second quarter W.S.C.
didn't bottle up one of Albert's
passes, a long one to Kmetovic for
a score. The conversion was just
wide, but what did it matter with
three or four more Indian touch
downs in the offing.
THE BREAKS
A few bad breaks, plus a leg in
jury to Kmetovic, postponed those
three or four touchdowns until it
was 100 late. Only one of them was
scored during the time allotted for
the game. A1 Cole was quarter
backing the team during their score,
while Albert was regaining his
breath on the bench.
That final touchdown was inade

was 100 late. Only one of them was
scored during the time allotted for
the game. A1 Cole was quarter
backing the team during their score,
while Albert was regaining his
breath on the bench.
That final touchdown was inade
quate since a fumble, a penalty, and
hard driving by Bob Kennedy, Cou
gar fullback, had already netted the
visitors from the Palouse another
score.
Stanford will not go to the Rose Bowl without the help of Montana or Oregon, if Stan
ford goes to the Rose Bowl at all. This is the situation after Washington State's 14-to-13
victory Saturday. The 1940 Indians earned their way to Pasadena with help from no one,
but they were a v/onder team. No wonder team was Saturday's Card aggregation.
There were factors, many factors. No breaks, poor tackling, two terrific ends, Susoeff

weeks of hard football, not to men

COACH CLARK PREDICTS
Coach Clark Shaughnessy said
that he did not have a push-button
team this year —a team which could ■
score at will against anyone. He;
was right. He said that the Indians
would have to score 27 points Sat
urday, or get beaten. They didn't,
so they were, so he was light again.
He said Friday that the team would
j have to come out of its lethargy, or
they would lose the game. They
didn't, so they did, so he was right
again.
The contest for top honors in the
Pacific Coast Conference football
race is now a tie between Oregon
State and Stanford with Washing
ton close behind. The Beavers have
won four conference games against
two losses, and have only to defeat
Montana and Oregon in the next
two week-ends to win the cham
pionship and the Rose Bowl bid.
Stanford also has four league wins
to two defeats. However, one of
their defeats was at the hands of
Oregon Stale, so, in ease of a tie in
the final conference standings, the
vote would go to the Beavers. Only
one game remains on the Stanford
schedule—the Big Game, as it is
called, or the California game.
Washington has three conference
wins to two losses with Oregon and
U.S.C. still unplayed; but. like Stan
ford, Washington was defeated by
O.S.C. in the game between the
two schools, so the Huskies have
slim hopes.
SEWELL MAKES DIFFERENCE
Although Billy Sewell, who has
received much mention for Ail-
American honors, aid not look like
the greatest football player ever to
grace the Stanford stadium, in fact
he barely outshone his own substi
tute, Jay Stoves, in the final reck
oning, it was Sewell who made the
difference between the two teams, at
least the scoreboard difference.
It was Sewell who had the pres
ence of mind to pick up the loose
ball, which was rolling around the
W.S.C. backfield after Milt Vucinich
had blocked Captain Joe Beckman's
try for point following the first Cou
gar touchdown, and run it over the
goal for the point.
The Indian team and rooters alike,
remembering that the Cougars had
piled up a touchdown lead in the
last year's game also, were not too
worried, since it was only the first
quarter, and everybody knows that
you can't keep Kmetovic, Arm
strong, Faweett, and Albert's passes
bottled up for long.
Duiing the second quarter W.S.C.
didn't bottle up one of Albert's
passes, a long one to Kmetovic for
a score. The conversion was just
wide, but what did it matter with
three or four more Indian touch
downs in the offing.
THE BREAKS
A few bad breaks, plus a leg in
jury to Kmetovic, postponed those
three or four touchdowns until it
was 100 late. Only one of them was
scored during the time allotted for
the game. A1 Cole was quarter
backing the team during their score,
while Albert was regaining his
breath on the bench.
That final touchdown was inade
quate since a fumble, a penalty, and
hard driving by Bob Kennedy, Cou
gar fullback, had already netted the
