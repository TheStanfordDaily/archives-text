# Cards Need Oregon's Help To Climb Back on Bowl Path
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Stanford will not go to the Rose Bowl without the help of Montana or Oregon, if Stan
ford goes to the Rose Bowl at all. This is the situation after Washington State's 14-to-13
victory Saturday. The 1940 Indians earned their way to Pasadena with help from no one,
but they were a v/onder team. No wonder team was Saturday's Card aggregation.
There were factors, many factors. No breaks, poor tackling, two terrific ends, Susoeff

Gentry, a shifting defense,
I loss of Kmetovic, seven previous
weeks of hard football, not to men
tion a superb Cougar team, they
all ganged up on the poor li'l Indian. I
COACH CLARK PREDICTS
Coach Clark Shaughnessy said
that he did not have a push-button
team this year —a team which could ■
score at will against anyone. He;
was right. He said that the Indians
would have to score 27 points Sat
urday, or get beaten. They didn't,
so they were, so he was light again.
He said Friday that the team would
j have to come out of its lethargy, or
they would lose the game. They
didn't, so they did, so he was right
again.
The contest for top honors in the
Pacific Coast Conference football
race is now a tie between Oregon
State and Stanford with Washing
ton close behind. The Beavers have
won four conference games against
two losses, and have only to defeat
Montana and Oregon in the next
two week-ends to win the cham
pionship and the Rose Bowl bid.
Stanford also has four league wins
