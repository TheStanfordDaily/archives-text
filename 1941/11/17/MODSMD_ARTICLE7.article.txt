## 
### 
"We were sunk by a great pair
of ends, Nick Susoeff and Dale
Gentry," was Clark Shaughncssy's
explanation of Stanford's 14-13
defeat at the hands of Washington
State Saturday. "They cut us oil
at the hip pockets."
The statement was made to Bill
Lciscr on the Second Gucsscrs
broadcast Sunday.
"Do you think Texas \ & IVT will
play in the Rose Bowl now?" Lci
scr asked.
"I'd say you'd better ask Ore
gen State about that," answered
the coach.
"Well," Lciscr concluded, "when
January 1 rolls around, we may
still see a team from Texas and a
team from Stanford in the Rose
Bowl."
