# Thousand Dance To Duke's Music
## 
### 
Dancing to the sometimes sweet,
sometimes hot music of Duke El
lington and his orchestra, some
thousand Stanford students attended
the Sophomore Cotillion Saturday
night in the Pavilion.
Judging from popular comment,
Ellington and the "Mood Indigo" Co- '
till ion were a distinct success. Add
ing to the entertainment was an
almost two-hour program of "An
notations to the Dance," in which
Ellington introduced members of
the hand in solo numbers.
