### AMIE REICHERT 
JAPAN'S "wolf-wolf' foreign pol
icy has lead to an erratic war of
nerves between that country and the
U.S. for the past year. Threat has
followed threat, ultimatums have
tumbled on top of one another, and
still the Japanese have not moved.
When and if they do move, the
world will be both surprised and
not surprised; not surprised be
cause everyone has been vaguely
expecting the shooting and be
cause the Japanese have commit
ted themselves to an aggressive
foreign policy; and surprised that
at last the new offensive has come,
and perhaps at the direction it will
take.
The question of war or peace is be
ing discussed at length in Washing
ton today by Ambassadors Kuru.su
and Nomura, and President Roose
velt, and Secretary Hull. This ques
tion has been discussed for almost
live months now. It has been ac
companied by the usual threats and
saber-rattlings from Tokyo, and an
ominous cabinet shake-up which put
government reins in the hands of
the Army "hotheads."
The "hotheads" vaulted into the
saddle some four weeks ago, and the
only apparent change in foreign
policy since then has been a little
for the better as far as Japanese-
U.S. relations go.

r rHE .improvement lies in tho fact
that thus far "hothead" Pre
mier General Hideki Tojo has not
once officially referred to Japan's
Axis alliance; that when Hitler gave
the green light signal to the Japa
nese last week by his reference to
the Tripartite Pact they looked the
other way and then sent another
ambassador to the U.S.; that all the
recent ultimatums have emphasized
one demand above all others, and
that is a "successful" conclusion of
the war with China.
The possibilities for a Japanese
move at this time against Russia
or to the South have decreased
for several reasons. Despite the
fact that the main body of the Red
Army is pretty busy at the mo
ment with Herr Hitler and Co.. a
Soviet fighting unit of consider
able si/.e, functioning independent
ly, remains to guard Siberia.
It has been estimated that this
army numbers at least 680,000
men, that it is far better mecha
nized than the Japanese army, and
that—unless too much equipment
has been sent to the West—it is
far better equipped with planes.
Furthermore, the Japanese could
count on having trouble with 100,000
Manchukuoan guerrilla fighters
who could raise havoc with their
communications. There is also the
disadvantage that Russian long
range bombers based at Vladivos
tock could splinter Tokyo, 600 miles
jiway. Russia claims her Siberian
industry is productive enough to
support the Far Eastern armies for
two years even if Trans-Siberian
communications were cut.

WHAT about the South then? It
is better than an even bet that
the U.S. and Britain would move to
check the Japanese should they
threaten southward. There will be
the U.S. Pacific and Asiatic fleets,
and as much of the British navy as
Churchill can spare, waiting open
armed for the Japanese navy.
Furthermore, defenses in the
Dutch East Indies arc being
strengthened rapidly, as well as
U.S. naval and air preparations in
1 lie Pacific.
These are probably the reasons
behind Tojo's emphasis on cleaning
up in China, for that is Japan's best
military bet at this moment. To
knock China out can never be done
as long as the U.S. keeps picking her
up and dusting her off and putting
guns in her hands, planes in her
hangars.
All (his restorative is adminis
tered through the famous Burma
Road. The Japanese will have to
cut that line — or blackmail the
U.S. into stopping Lend-Loase aid.
Which is what they arc trying to
do now.
The U.S. might make a deal with
Japan but it would certainly not be
one which would hand over China to
her. Any other kind of a deal would
be unacceptable.

knock China out can never be done
as long as the U.S. keeps picking her
up and dusting her off and putting
guns in her hands, planes in her
hangars.

JAPAN'S "wolf-wolf' foreign pol
icy has lead to an erratic war of
nerves between that country and the
U.S. for the past year. Threat has
followed threat, ultimatums have
tumbled on top of one another, and
still the Japanese have not moved.
When and if they do move, the
world will be both surprised and
not surprised; not surprised be
cause everyone has been vaguely
expecting the shooting and be
cause the Japanese have commit
ted themselves to an aggressive
foreign policy; and surprised that
at last the new offensive has come,
and perhaps at the direction it will
take.
The question of war or peace is be
ing discussed at length in Washing
ton today by Ambassadors Kuru.su
and Nomura, and President Roose
velt, and Secretary Hull. This ques
tion has been discussed for almost
live months now. It has been ac
companied by the usual threats and
saber-rattlings from Tokyo, and an
ominous cabinet shake-up which put
government reins in the hands of
the Army "hotheads."
The "hotheads" vaulted into the
saddle some four weeks ago, and the
only apparent change in foreign
policy since then has been a little
for the better as far as Japanese-
U.S. relations go.

r rHE .improvement lies in tho fact
that thus far "hothead" Pre
mier General Hideki Tojo has not
once officially referred to Japan's
Axis alliance; that when Hitler gave
the green light signal to the Japa
nese last week by his reference to
the Tripartite Pact they looked the
other way and then sent another
ambassador to the U.S.; that all the
recent ultimatums have emphasized
one demand above all others, and
that is a "successful" conclusion of
the war with China.
The possibilities for a Japanese
move at this time against Russia
or to the South have decreased
for several reasons. Despite the
fact that the main body of the Red
Army is pretty busy at the mo
ment with Herr Hitler and Co.. a
Soviet fighting unit of consider
able si/.e, functioning independent
ly, remains to guard Siberia.
It has been estimated that this
army numbers at least 680,000
men, that it is far better mecha
nized than the Japanese army, and
that—unless too much equipment
has been sent to the West—it is
far better equipped with planes.
Furthermore, the Japanese could
count on having trouble with 100,000
Manchukuoan guerrilla fighters
who could raise havoc with their
communications. There is also the
disadvantage that Russian long
range bombers based at Vladivos
tock could splinter Tokyo, 600 miles
jiway. Russia claims her Siberian
industry is productive enough to
support the Far Eastern armies for
two years even if Trans-Siberian
communications were cut.

WHAT about the South then? It
is better than an even bet that
the U.S. and Britain would move to
check the Japanese should they
threaten southward. There will be
the U.S. Pacific and Asiatic fleets,
and as much of the British navy as
Churchill can spare, waiting open
armed for the Japanese navy.
Furthermore, defenses in the
Dutch East Indies arc being
strengthened rapidly, as well as
U.S. naval and air preparations in
1 lie Pacific.
These are probably the reasons
behind Tojo's emphasis on cleaning
up in China, for that is Japan's best

is better than an even bet that
the U.S. and Britain would move to
check the Japanese should they
threaten southward. There will be
the U.S. Pacific and Asiatic fleets,
and as much of the British navy as
Churchill can spare, waiting open
armed for the Japanese navy.
Furthermore, defenses in the
Dutch East Indies arc being
strengthened rapidly, as well as
U.S. naval and air preparations in
1 lie Pacific.
These are probably the reasons
behind Tojo's emphasis on cleaning
up in China, for that is Japan's best
military bet at this moment. To
knock China out can never be done
as long as the U.S. keeps picking her
up and dusting her off and putting
guns in her hands, planes in her
hangars.
All (his restorative is adminis
tered through the famous Burma
Road. The Japanese will have to
cut that line — or blackmail the
U.S. into stopping Lend-Loase aid.
Which is what they arc trying to
do now.
The U.S. might make a deal with
Japan but it would certainly not be
one which would hand over China to
her. Any other kind of a deal would
be unacceptable.
JAPAN'S "wolf-wolf' foreign pol
icy has lead to an erratic war of
nerves between that country and the
U.S. for the past year. Threat has
followed threat, ultimatums have
tumbled on top of one another, and
still the Japanese have not moved.
When and if they do move, the
world will be both surprised and
not surprised; not surprised be
cause everyone has been vaguely
expecting the shooting and be
cause the Japanese have commit
ted themselves to an aggressive
foreign policy; and surprised that
at last the new offensive has come,
and perhaps at the direction it will
take.
The question of war or peace is be
ing discussed at length in Washing
ton today by Ambassadors Kuru.su
and Nomura, and President Roose
velt, and Secretary Hull. This ques
tion has been discussed for almost
live months now. It has been ac
companied by the usual threats and
saber-rattlings from Tokyo, and an
ominous cabinet shake-up which put
government reins in the hands of
the Army "hotheads."
The "hotheads" vaulted into the
saddle some four weeks ago, and the
only apparent change in foreign
policy since then has been a little
for the better as far as Japanese-
U.S. relations go.

r rHE .improvement lies in tho fact
that thus far "hothead" Pre
mier General Hideki Tojo has not
once officially referred to Japan's
Axis alliance; that when Hitler gave
the green light signal to the Japa
nese last week by his reference to
the Tripartite Pact they looked the
other way and then sent another
ambassador to the U.S.; that all the
recent ultimatums have emphasized
one demand above all others, and
that is a "successful" conclusion of
the war with China.
The possibilities for a Japanese
move at this time against Russia
or to the South have decreased
for several reasons. Despite the
fact that the main body of the Red
Army is pretty busy at the mo
ment with Herr Hitler and Co.. a
Soviet fighting unit of consider
able si/.e, functioning independent
ly, remains to guard Siberia.
It has been estimated that this
army numbers at least 680,000
men, that it is far better mecha
nized than the Japanese army, and
that—unless too much equipment
has been sent to the West—it is
far better equipped with planes.
Furthermore, the Japanese could
count on having trouble with 100,000
Manchukuoan guerrilla fighters
who could raise havoc with their
communications. There is also the
disadvantage that Russian long
range bombers based at Vladivos
tock could splinter Tokyo, 600 miles
jiway. Russia claims her Siberian
industry is productive enough to
support the Far Eastern armies for
two years even if Trans-Siberian
communications were cut.

WHAT about the South then? It
is better than an even bet that
the U.S. and Britain would move to
check the Japanese should they
threaten southward. There will be
