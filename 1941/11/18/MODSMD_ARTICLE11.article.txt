# Gifts of Million And Half Top 50- Year Mark
## 
### 
Gifts to Stanford University during the school year 11)40-41 were the
greatest in the 50-year history of the school, it was revealed yesterday in
figures released by the Stanford Associates. A total of individuals
combined to give a total of $1,572,251.76 to the University between

Sept. 1. 1940, and Aug. 31, 1941.
This total of more than one and
a half millions broke the standing
record which was set in 1938-39.
To the many students, faculty
members, alumni and friends who
contributed to the fund, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur expressed deep
gratitude.
"The generous interest in Stan
ford's welfare has been most heart
ening," he stated. "I wish to ex
press deep thanks and appreciation
to each individual donor, to the As
sociated Students, and other organi
zations who have made possible this
birthday gift to Stanford on the oc
casion of its 50th anniversary."
In the past 50 years, Stanford has
trained more than 40,000 men and
women, giving the world the benefit
of outstanding scholastic achieve
ment, the president went on.
"Since student fees today pay only
half the expenses of the University,
the remaining 50 per cent must
come from income from endowment
and voluntary contributions," he
explained. "It is through such gifts
as these that Stanford may hope not
only to maintain the high standards
of its first half century, but to in
crease its educational service during
the next 50 years."
A large section of the total gifts
was made up of the money collected
by the Stanford Family Council in
the Stanford Annual Appeal. This
collection totalled $150,000 last year.
The Associated Students played a
major role in this work, the students
personally contacting friends and
alumni to enlist their help.
The annual appeal was also pre
sented on behalf of the various
schools of the University, volunteer
committees from the schools solicit
ing gifts designated for school use.
Leading in this activity was the Med
ical School, followed by the Schools
of Engineering and Law.
Over 3000 gifts made up the $150,-
000 collected in the Annual Appeal,
2000 of them gifts of $10 or less.
Contributions to Stanford are used
directly by the University for what
ever approved University purpose
donor desires. Those unrestricted as
to use are employed to meet the
most pressing needs of the year.
