# News Editor To Comment On History
## Series Will Present Howard Davis, Noted Correspondent, at 7:30 
### 
"History or Hysteria" will be
Howard Pierce Davis' topic when
he speaks tonight at 7:30 in the Me
morial Auditorium for the Tuesday
Evening Series. He has spent part
of each of the last nine years in
Europe studying the international
situation.
Davis, who was for a time foreign
editor of the Boston Transcript, had
the opportunity to interview such
men as Hitler, Goering, Count Ciano,
Blum and Herbert Morrison during
his travels in Europe, and he will
base many of his comments of "His-

Tory or Hysteria" on his conversa
tions with them.
In 1931, he was told by Hitler that
within 18 months he, Hitler, would
be called upon to take over the Ber
lin government.
Later, he watched Dei* Fuehrer
invade Poland and take over that
government. Immediately before
Hitler's invasion of France, Davis
was the last man to cross the Franco-
German frontier.
After several years spent in fol
lowing the political moves in Eu
rope and keeping one jump ahead of
Hitler's invading armies, Davis last
summer decided to get a broader
picture of the international situation
and traveled extensively in lsÂ»tin
America, studying the foreign in
roads in the Western Hemisphere.
While in Havana, he attended the
conference of Foreign Ministers and
had the opportunity for discussion
with important figures of all of Latin
America.
Later he visited Mexico to study
the post-election situation and po
litical upheaval in that country.
