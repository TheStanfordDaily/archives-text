# ICHIHASHI PREDICTS TRUCE
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
"I believe that Saburo Kuru.su is
bringing Japanese terms of compro
mise to Washington, and that the
United Stales will accept these com
promises and avert war in the Pa
cific," declared Dr. Yamato Ichi
haslii, professor of Japanese history
and government, at an International
Relations Club meeting yesterday.
"There could be no other reason j
for Kurusu's trip to Washington at i
this time," said Professor Ichihashi. I
who is a personal friend of Kuru.su
and Ambassador Nomura.
In any compromise, Dr. Ichihashi
said, Japan would have to agree to
halt her armies and guarantee
against further attack on China,
Thailand, and Russia, and would
have to reject the Tri-Partite Pact
with Germany and Italy. The United
States would have to agree to pro
mote a peace between Japan atid
China, and restore normal economic
relations with Japan.
WOULD BREAK PACT
"The United States is not going
to ask for the restoration of Man
chukuo," he commented.
Dr. Ichihashi observed that Japan
had consistently shown her desire to
break away from the Tri-Partite
Pact.
"Japan has not attacked Russia to
aid Germany, or declared war on
the United States to aid Germany,"
he pointed out.
