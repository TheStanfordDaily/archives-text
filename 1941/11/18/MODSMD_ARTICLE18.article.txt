# Miniature Peace Conference Moulds World Organization
## 
### 
A miniature Peace Congress hashed over the late of the post-war
world at the Hoover Library last night.
Stanford scholars of 11 nationalities sat around an oblong table for
the weekly meeting of the Peace Seminar. The pensive face of Her-

Bert Hoover looked down upon the 4.
group from a gold-framed oil por- j
trait.
A rap of the gavel hushed in- 1
formal conversations among Rus- ;
sians and Finns, Germans and Brit- j
ishers.
Manipulation of public opinion to j
support a post-war international or- .
ganization was stated as a major j
problem by Chairman H. H. Fisher, i
history professor.
Seminar members accused Ameri
cans of failure to understand other
nations. Radio, movies, and the
press were discussed as mediums to
promote public opinion.
Principal proposition for educating
an internationally minded public
was an international league of re
porters. Under this scheme report
ers from every nation would be
trained in internationalism by travel
and contact with leaders of other
nations. Then they would be sent
back to their own nations to intei - -
pret the world's news.
Objections to this scheme were
that the advertising-subsidized press
would not permit its reporters to dis
play an anti-national viewpoint.
In the field of economic organiza
tion, the experts agreed that people
have more confidence in a gold
standard than in a managed or other
type of standard.
Any barriers to exchange of goods
after the war will encourage migra
tion, according to members of the
panel. Migration can be reduced by
increased industrialization in the
heavily populated nations such as
China and Japan.
Among the speakers at the semi- j
nar were: Dr. Rudolph Ilolsti, of the
political science department; Dr.
Thomas Bailey of the history de
partment; Dr. Irwin Abrahms, of the
history department, and Dr. Fisher.
