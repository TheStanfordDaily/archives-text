# Daily Opens Ad Contest Tonight, 7:30
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily's 1941 adver
tising contest will open tonight at
7:30 with a meeting in the business
office of the Daily Shack. All stu
dents interested in trying out for the
business staff are eligible to enter the
contest and compete for the cash
prizes.
No previous experience is neces
sary, and the winner will be chosen
solely on the basis of the amount of
advertising sold. Members of the
business staff will aid students.
The experience gained from work
in the contest will be valuable for
those interested in sales or advertis
ing work of any kind, according to
Dan Lewis, business manager of The
Daily. Freshmen and sophomores
seeking permanent positions on the
staff are urged particularly to enter.
Seven salaried positions are of
fered yearly to promising tryoutecs,
the lop one paying $1200 a year. It
is not necessary to win the contest
i to get one of these positions, but the
opportunity is greater for contest
winners. Lewis was a winner of
this contest.
