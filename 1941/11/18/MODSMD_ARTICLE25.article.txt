# Strike Laws Pledged By Legislators
## Coal Dispute Angers Congress; Violence Flares at 4 Mines 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP).â€”
Speaker Sam Rayburn tonight prom
ised Congressional action u at the
earliest possible moment" on anti
strike legislation as legislators bit
terly denounced mine chieftain John
L. Lewis for calling a walkout in the
captive coal mines.
Rayburn told the membership last,
week during debate on the Neutral
ity bill that he would lead or follow
a movement to clamp restrictions on
labor's right to strike in defense
industries. He said at a press con
ference today he would not have
made that statement if he had not
believed the House would be given
an opportunity soon to legislate on
the problem.
(Reports from the strike areas
told of rebellion by an estimated
7000 workers in captive mines who
went to the pits in defiance of
John L. Lewis' strike call, vio
lence at four West Virginia mines
and spread of the walkout to some
10,000 employeos of noncaptivo
mines.)
LAWS MAY BE DRASTIC
Rayburn did not reveal what
form the legislation would take, but
the Congressional tide is running so
strong against defense strikes that
the restrictions are likely to be ex
ceedingly drastic.
House leaders said tonight .that the
situation had proceeded beyond the
point of whether legislation should
be enacted, and declared the ques
tion now is how sweeping it should
be. They will discuss the subject
with the President tomorrow and
they predicted tonight that legis
lation in some form would start
through the chamber next week.
THE CONNALLY BILL
Bills aimed against such strikes
drop into the Congressional hopper
almost every day. Senator Tom Con
nally, D., Tex., introduced a meas
ure today extending to coal mines
the President's authority to seize de
fense plants during the emergency.
His bill would freeze wages and
working conditions in the union and
open shops at their present status
and set up a board to arbitrate dis
putes in commandeered plant*.
President Roosevelt, faced with
the crucial task of devising means to
reopen the mines, received forma!
reports from union and management
officials on collate of their nego
tiations.
