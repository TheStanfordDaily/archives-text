## 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
Blitzkriegs may he the thing in
countries where fashion also dictates
I lie gftoseslep and "Ilcil Hitler," hut
it! America, from Maine to Califor
nia, "Knitzkrieg" names (he trend
(hat should eventually entangle the
Fuehrer.
In the United States women, riot
to l>e outdone by their British sis
ters overseas, are uniting under the
Red Cross to "Knitzkrieg" the world.
Knitzkrieg is the term applied to a
movement of the Red Cross to havo
a million sweaters knitted by Christ
mas, though the enthusiasm of those
taking part has extended the limit to
include socks, shawls, and afghans.
Because the Red Cross feels
that the most urgent needs for
warm clothing are not all to lie
found iti war-torn Europe, thai
many of them are right here in the
I nited States, (he quota of a mil
lion sweaters is also to lie divided
between camp service men, needy
people on government relief lists,
and people who have recently snf
fi red in national disasters.
Stanford's knitzkrieg goal is "fifty
sweaters before Christmas," accord
ing to Patricia Davidson, secretary
ol the campus Y.W.C.A., which rep-

I resents the Red Cross locally. Four
i hundred thirty-six women are now
j knitting on garments ranging from
children's sweaters and beanies, to
heavy, man-sized sweaters, and
| socks. Instruction is provided
through the Y for those who, though
(actually fired with enthusiasm, are
hampered by not knowing much
about the art of knitting.
Children's sweaters and caps
seem to be popular with Stanford
women at present. Socks are run
f iling a close second.
Last year 84 sweaters and socks
| were finished, and nearly 100 af
ghans were completed. Under (he
present knitzkrieg stimulus, there
are already half as many girls
knitting as there were all
I of last year. However, IVrss Dav
i idson sends out the plea for "as
! many as can to come. We would
like («» have 200 more knitters,"
Yarn is unlimited. There is no
cost; just f>o to the "Y" and sign for
J yarn and bring back the finished
j product. Take your knitting to com
| mittee meetings, to lectures, to the
| movies, ff there is one thing the
j knitzkrieg can learn from the blitz
kriegs, it is that it takes the co
operation of everyone to make an
Impressive success.
