# College Demand for Defense Training Shows 2% Increase
## 
### Student Opinion Surveys 
AUSTIN. Texas, Nov. 17.â€”The nation's defense program and the em
phasis the war is placing on scientific advancement seem to have had little
effect on what students believe college education should offer.
A national poll of Student Opinion Surveys of America reveals that
during the last two years there has been only a very slight increase in the

number of collegians who believe,
higher education should stress tech
nical and professional training. Col
lege newspapers, including The
Stanford Daily, assigned interview
ers to ask the following question of
a carefully-derived cross section of
students:
"Do you believe college education
should be mainly technical and pro
fessional training, or should it em
phasize a wide cultural back
ground?"
Here are the results, compared
with those compiled by Student
Opinion Surveys in November, 1939,
on the identical question:
1939 1941
Pet. Pet.
Technical and professional 17 19
Cultural background .... 4(5 42
Both 37 39
Less than 1 per cent were unde-
Icided; so these no-opinion answers
were not included in the tabulations.
Men students, nearly one-fourth
of them, want technical and profes
sional training favored, while only
16 per cent of the women do.
From the comments made by many
students contacted, the reason for the
small number who want the tech
nical side stressed is that undergrad
uates do not want the arts and so
cial sciences overshadowed during
this period of strife.
