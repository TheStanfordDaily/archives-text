# Vacation Late Leaves Given By Council
## 
### 
Automatic late leaves have been
granted by Women's Council for
Thanksgiving vacation from Wednes
day night through Saturday night,
according to Rosemarie Mullany,
Council chairman. The houses will
remain open until 12 each night, but
will close as usual at 10:30 Sunday
night.
At a meeting of Women's Confer
once yesterday afternoon, President
Irma Jean Hannibal announced that
Exeom and President Wilbur had
confirmed the new social regulation
allowing houses on campus to stay
open until 1:30 after Saturday night
dances just as is done regularly for
Friday night dances.
Formerly Saturday dances have
closed at 12, but because of the con
fusion in giving houses the preferred
Friday night dates, the new law was
introduced and will go into effect
starting today. Automatic 1:30 late
leaves are given girls when their
own living group is giving a dance.
