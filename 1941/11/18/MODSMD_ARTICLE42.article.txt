jJF THE opposition that has faced
the Galloping Gaels of St. Mary's
this fall has known as much about
what, the Moragans were going to
use in the way of attack as did the
fellow sitting near us in the press
coop at Kezar Sunday, it's no won
der that the Red Strader-coached
! eleven has had a tough time win
! ning ball games this fall.
The Gaels would go back in the
hmddle. the Broncos of Santa Clara
would move up to the line of scrim
mage on defense, and the afore
mentioned observer would say:
'"On this one, now. Podesto will
pass to the left end down and
out."
And, by jimmy, that's just what
would happen. In fact, if the guy
missed calling the play that the St.
. Mary's team would use, he was
downright put out about it.
We don't know how he did it;
we just know that he kept his
eyes on the St. Mary's bench while
the Gaels were in the huddle. And
Strader was going through a lot of
antics on the sidelines, too.

o ne of the great troubles with
last Saturday's game is that, even
though they all say that Washing
ton State was definitely the better
team, the fracas left so many "ifs"
in Ihe mind of Stanford fans.
IF the crazy football hadn't bound
ed in just the manner it did, it
wouldn't have hit Hoot Armstrong
when his back was turned and Stan
ford would have had possession.
That was one turning point.
IF Frankie Albert hadn't fumbled—
which Ihe best of them often do—
and IF W.S.C. hadn't recovered, ihe
Cougars wouldn't have had the
chance to score the second time.
We could go on for lines and lines
about all the IFs that wore con
nected with the defeat.
As long as the Cards had to get
licked, it would have been easier to
take had the breaks of the game just
failed to appear.
At it was, they did appear, the
Cougars took them, and made the
very best of them—which is just say
ing that Babe Hollingberry's lads
from the Palouse played darn good
football.
Lacross was originated among the
! North American Indians.

That was one turning point.
IF Frankie Albert hadn't fumbled—
which Ihe best of them often do—
and IF W.S.C. hadn't recovered, ihe
Cougars wouldn't have had the
chance to score the second time.
We could go on for lines and lines
about all the IFs that wore con
nected with the defeat.
As long as the Cards had to get
licked, it would have been easier to
take had the breaks of the game just
failed to appear.
At it was, they did appear, the
Cougars took them, and made the
very best of them—which is just say
ing that Babe Hollingberry's lads
from the Palouse played darn good
football.
Lacross was originated among the
! North American Indians.
jJF THE opposition that has faced
the Galloping Gaels of St. Mary's
this fall has known as much about
what, the Moragans were going to
use in the way of attack as did the
fellow sitting near us in the press
coop at Kezar Sunday, it's no won
der that the Red Strader-coached
! eleven has had a tough time win
! ning ball games this fall.
The Gaels would go back in the
hmddle. the Broncos of Santa Clara
would move up to the line of scrim
mage on defense, and the afore
mentioned observer would say:
'"On this one, now. Podesto will
pass to the left end down and
out."
And, by jimmy, that's just what
would happen. In fact, if the guy
missed calling the play that the St.
. Mary's team would use, he was
downright put out about it.
We don't know how he did it;
we just know that he kept his
eyes on the St. Mary's bench while
the Gaels were in the huddle. And
Strader was going through a lot of
antics on the sidelines, too.

o ne of the great troubles with
last Saturday's game is that, even
though they all say that Washing
ton State was definitely the better
team, the fracas left so many "ifs"
in Ihe mind of Stanford fans.
IF the crazy football hadn't bound
ed in just the manner it did, it
wouldn't have hit Hoot Armstrong
when his back was turned and Stan
ford would have had possession.
That was one turning point.
