and to Stanford, 10-4, this year.
Star of the San Jose squad is Doug
Bacon, brother of Hadley Bacon,
Cardinal forward.
SMITH OUT
Stanford will be weakened by the
loss of Don Smith, first replacement
at either forward or sprint, who
went to the hospital Sunday with an
infected ear. Captain Frank Mitch

ered by a cold the last few weeks
but should be ready to go.

Jack Bleecker, center back; Frank
Mitchell and Bob Jones, guards: and
Pete Lee, goalie.
