Dr. Helen Mitchell, principal nu
tritionist for the Office of Defense
j Health and Welfare Services, stated
! on a recent flying trip through Cali
fornia, that nutrition is a growing
! field for college women.
"The draft and other defense ac
-1 tivities have brought home to many
communities need for further knowl
edge of the principles of nutrition,"
j she said.
"Community nutritionists are the
: logical answer to this need and pro
gressive communities will soon
consider them as necessary to the
health of the community as public
health nurses."
