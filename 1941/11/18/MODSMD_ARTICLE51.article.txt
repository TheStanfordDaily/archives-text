# To The Polls, Frosh
## 
### 
TODAY members of the freshman class will
go to the polls in their own halls to elect
their class officers for the rest of the year.
Today they will have their first real contact
with the preferential system.
The preferential system, which does away
with primary balloting by voters showing their
choices of candidates, will theoretically elect
the most popular choice from as many candi
dates as are on the ballot.
The one factor which can invalidate prefer
ential returns is unintelligent voting. If the
voter allows himself to be confused by the little
squares, if he makes pretty designs with his
check-marks, the preferential system will prob
ably fail to elect the most popular candidate.
The freshman women of Roble belatedly got
a little worried about the number of women
running. Their intentions were probably good
and seemingly they were not doing any smooth
political maneuvering.
Declinations closed last Wednesday at 5. The
ballots went to the printers Thursday. But Roble
huddled together for a caucus Thursday night.
There they unofficially pared the list of nomi
nees from nineteen to six. They dropped from
what they choose to call their "official list" all
those who are prominent on Rally Committee
or in other activities.
This action was taken, without prompting from
their sponsors who are inured with the schem
ings of Women's Nominating Committee, sup
posedly with an eye to spreading the activity
plums around, etc.
The end is admirable, but the means . . .
However, they were a little late to be com
pletely "official" in the eyes of Election Board.
The names of the "other thirteen" women will
still be on the ballots.
But these women have been put on their
honor to decline the job if they happen to buck
the advantage given the "official" candidates
and win the election. However, this seems pretty
improbable.
And the action of the women of Roble seems
a little more "officious" than "official" when you
consider that they were playing around with a
class office, not just a women's office. There
are almost twice as many Encina men in the
frosh class as Roble women. They might not
have approved the action.
But the women didn't give them a chance.
They, a minority, attempted to take over the
function of democracy to themselves. Usually
it is not until the sophomore year that Stanford
students learn the evils and machinations of
caucuses.
The "chosen six" have been the ones intro
duced at hall assemblies, had their pictures in
The Daily. The "other thirteen" are still on
the ballot.
But Roble says you're not supposed to vote
for them.

There they unofficially pared the list of nomi
nees from nineteen to six. They dropped from
what they choose to call their "official list" all
those who are prominent on Rally Committee
or in other activities.
This action was taken, without prompting from
their sponsors who are inured with the schem
ings of Women's Nominating Committee, sup
posedly with an eye to spreading the activity
plums around, etc.
The end is admirable, but the means . . .
However, they were a little late to be com
pletely "official" in the eyes of Election Board.
The names of the "other thirteen" women will
still be on the ballots.
But these women have been put on their
honor to decline the job if they happen to buck
the advantage given the "official" candidates
and win the election. However, this seems pretty
improbable.
And the action of the women of Roble seems
a little more "officious" than "official" when you
consider that they were playing around with a
class office, not just a women's office. There
are almost twice as many Encina men in the
frosh class as Roble women. They might not
have approved the action.
But the women didn't give them a chance.
They, a minority, attempted to take over the
function of democracy to themselves. Usually
it is not until the sophomore year that Stanford
students learn the evils and machinations of
caucuses.
The "chosen six" have been the ones intro
duced at hall assemblies, had their pictures in
The Daily. The "other thirteen" are still on
the ballot.
But Roble says you're not supposed to vote
for them.
TODAY members of the freshman class will
go to the polls in their own halls to elect
their class officers for the rest of the year.
Today they will have their first real contact
with the preferential system.
The preferential system, which does away
with primary balloting by voters showing their
choices of candidates, will theoretically elect
the most popular choice from as many candi
dates as are on the ballot.
The one factor which can invalidate prefer
ential returns is unintelligent voting. If the
voter allows himself to be confused by the little
squares, if he makes pretty designs with his
check-marks, the preferential system will prob
ably fail to elect the most popular candidate.
The freshman women of Roble belatedly got
a little worried about the number of women
running. Their intentions were probably good
and seemingly they were not doing any smooth
political maneuvering.
Declinations closed last Wednesday at 5. The
ballots went to the printers Thursday. But Roble
huddled together for a caucus Thursday night.
