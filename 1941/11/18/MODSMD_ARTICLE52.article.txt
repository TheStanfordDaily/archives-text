SECRETARY of the Navy Frank Knox recently
predicted that America's two-ocean navy
will be in operation "long before" its scheduled

completion in 1946. He would not "guess" the
exact date of completion of the present program
for the "greatest navy in world history," but
said that progress is far ahead of schedule.
He conveyed heartening statistical news. In
1941 alone, he said, 126 ships have been placed
in operation, including 35 of the combatant class.
The remainder are auxiliary craft, which in
many respects "are just as important."
He said the last of the first six super battle
ships of the 35,000-ton class, the "Alabama"—
will be ready by February and that the first
45,000-ton battlewagon will be completed some
time next year.
The Secretary reiterated his recent statement
that the Navy Department will not release in
formation concerning Axis submarine losses.
The news will be withheld, he said, because "we
think it is the best policy in our fight to free the
seas of modern pirates. It's just one of our
methods of impairing and breaking down their
morale."
Commenting on Panama Canal defenses, he
said the canal had the longest-range guns in the
world and "God help any ship that gets within
their range . . . nothing has been left undone
to make the canal impregnable."
At a time when strikes, such as the captive
coal stalemate, threaten to sink national effi
ciency into a production quagmire, Secretary
Knox' report comes as a reassurance of the fast
growing strength of the arsenal of democracy.
When the time comes, aggressors will find
America's magazine fully loaded. — Harold
