### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
WATER
the rain starts to fall and there are
puddles around the campus, I think back to the
time when I was a freshman in Encina. And in think
ing back to that year, I always think of Sherman Mel
linkofl, who happened to write this column that year,
and also was sponsor of the corridor in which I lived.
I remember one night in particular. We were all in
our pajamas, engaged in a water fight. There was
water all over the room, on our books, on the tables,
everywhere. I was standing in the middle of the room
with a cup full of water, with my hand raised ready to
throw, when the door opened and a man in an impres
sive black overcoat, with two piercing eyes stood in
the doorway, looking at the condition of the room, and
then at me, and at the room and then finally settling
those two eyes directly on me. It was my sponsor,
Sherman MellinkofT, just back from a debate tourna
ment, his mind sharpened and ready to attack any lie
that I might tell.
"What arc you doing, Cheslie?" he asked quietly.
"Water," I said, and pushed the cup that I was
hiding forward so that he could see it. "I always drink
a cup before going to bed."
"Water?"
"Yes Shcrm. I always drink a little water."
"Well, go ahead and drink it," he said, and he
watched me as I slowly drank it down. "Now swim to
bed and be at sponsors' meeting tomorrow night."

J ALWAYS remember that night and when I think
of water and MellinkofT, I think of the campaigns
he used to make about the parking lot next to the
library. The problem then was that the lot was all
dirt and when the rains came, the place was a big
mud hole and very inconvenient to parkers. The sug
gestion was to tar it or in some other way give it a
surface that would withstand the rains.
Now we don't have that problem of a sloppy, muddy
parking lot. They have eliminated that difficulty. They
have closed the thing altogether. Everyone appre
ciates the parking lot that has been fixed behind the
library. It is fixed up swell, but it is such a long way
from the front of the library when the rain is pouring
down, and you have a load of books and papers and a
binder and have to run through the slush.
If there isn't any hidden reason for keeping this
other lot closed, let's open it so that my mother won't
worry about me running around in the rain.
