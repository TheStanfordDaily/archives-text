GANDIII NOT DRUNK

r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
When Sherwood Eddy spoke to the Luncheon Club
of Stanford last year, he made the statement that
Gandhi had abandoned his complete pacifist position,
purporting to give an account of a personal conversa
tion with the great leader of India. It would be in
teresting to know whether Mr. Eddy has seen Gandhi's
refutation originally published in "Harijan" and quoted
in the January 1941 issue of "Fellowship," journal of the
Fellowship of Reconciliation, 2929 Broadway, New York
City:
"I can only say that I have no recollection of my
having ever made such a statement. I know Dr. Sher
wood Eddy well. I remember 100 his visit. The astound
ing statement put into my mouth belies all I have ever
written or said about the defence of India... If, there
fore, Dr. Eddy sees these lines, and instead of correcting
himself persists in his statement, I can only say that I
must have been absent-minded when I made the state
ment imputed to me. I cannot say I must have been
drunk, because I do not drink."
