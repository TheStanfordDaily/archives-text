# Contented-Looking Cows Parade at Livestock Show
## 
### 
PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL LIVESTOCK EXHIBITION and Ilorsc
Sliow, nightly including Saturday, Nov. 22, Cow Palace, South San
Francisco.
With the dedication of the two and a half million dollar Cow Palace.
San Francisco makes its hid to become the livestock center of the West,
and with the type of show they now are putting on, there should be no
serious competition.

Presenting three shows in one, the
four and a Half hour program gives
more thrills for the admission price
than any other circus, auto show
and speedboat race combined. There
is a big rodeo, for which all the best
ropers, steer throwers and riders are
here from Texas, Montana, and Ari
zona; a Livestock Exposition with all
sorts of tremendous, contented look
ing cows, and a regular blue rib
bon Horse Show.
Alternating a rodeo event with a
horse shoe class, the program moves
rapidly and the unexpected thrills
which happen right and left only
keep you clutching and unclutching
your hand and nervously tearing
your program to bits.
Cowboys vieing for the big cash
prizes risk life and limb to rope and
throw a calf, ride a Brahma cow and
get thrown off buck-crazy horses.
In the competition one rider roped
a calf from his horse, got off, threw
the 'dogie' and tied up the feet for
branding in the amazing time of nine
seconds flat. He modestly got up and
dusted himself off to the cheers of
the crowd.
To the accompaniment of Freddie

; Martin's "Concerto" the five-gaited
j single hackneys made a pretty show
ing. These little four-wheel brightly
lacquered buggies with their shining
; leather harness have no other use
than to be shown in horse shows,
but the high-stepping horses made
every one applaud. Silver Deaux
was the winner in this class, driven
by his attractive formally dressed
owner.
There was a showing of racing
trotters and a large class of beauti
ful palominos, all of which deserved
prizes. Shetland ponies and a big
class of jumpers were also shown.
For some unstated reasons a trap
ese artist suddenly goes through his
; act high up in the rafters, culmi
| nating with a 90-foot jump with a
| rope around his neck which catches
j him, throws him up, down, and up
j again, all to the screams and hushed
| silences of the crowd.
The Brahma bull riding was about
the most dangerous thing you could
expect to see. After the rider is
j finally hauled off or thrown, more
likely, there is the difficulty of get
ting the animal out of the ring, with

the bull charging up against the
walls half a dozen times before they
finally get him out. Lots of blood
when one of the bulls finally did
charge over the side into a group of
people by the exit.
The best thing to do is get your
tickets in advance as the Cow Pal
ace is drawing capacity crowds.
Prices are from 55 cents to 1.65, and
it starts promptly at 7:30. Lots of
parking space.â€”Wuenschel
