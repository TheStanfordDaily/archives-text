country hasn't got enough to
worry about. The President
hasn't got enough headaches. Adolf
Hitler, Saburu Kuru.su, John L.
Lewis, Charles A. Lindbergh and
buddies aren't making things hoi
enough.
No. Now were going to have a
civil war.
Siskiyou and Del Norte counties
of California, and Curry county of
Oregon, yesterday threatened to se
cede from their present states and
form a 49th one.
They complained that they had
been neglected.
They drew up a fat list of
grievances—a pint-size declaration
of independence. They called on
mighty Modoc county (pop. 8.774)
of California, and their Oregon
cousin counties of Josephine and
Jackson to join in the revolt, and
they even started thinking about
a name for their new state.
"Our roads are poor," they said,
"and our bridges inadequate. We
have large deposits of chrome, man
ganese and copper ore which the
states have never helped us devel
op." So it's secession, suh!
That is 100 bad. Can't you see
what a lot of trouble you will be
causing, Siskiyou, Del Norte, Curry,
Modoc, Jackson, and Josephine?
Everywhere people aie going to have
to start sewing a 49th star on their
flags—and there will probably be a
cotton shortage.
Can't you see that it's bad
enough in Congress these days?
Now we'll he having two more
Senators and a few more Repre
sentatives and they'll probably all
he isolationists or Townsenditcs
and it'll take iust that much longer
to get things done.
But the worst of all is that at
every convention now there'll be
just that many more delegates.
Delegates from the state of Siskiyou
delnortecurrymodocjosephinejackson.
No, no. Please don't secede. Any
thing but that. We have enough
troubles already.

is Thanksgiving and
nobody wants to go home for the
vacation with such serious thoughts
preying on his mind. So let's forget
about the war (the civil war, we
mean and hold a happy thought.
Let us hold a happy thought for
Thomas Frederick Manvillc, fam
ous connoisseur of the blonde,
who yesterday added a fifth to his
collection.
Tommy, who is cafe society's gift
to whomever will have him, met his
new wife, Bonnie Edwards, Sunday
night on a blind date, and when he
found out that their horoscopes fore
told a happy, happy combination, he
decided to marry her. He an
nounced the engagement that night
at the Stork Club.
But the next day, he had a
little doubt in his mind so he
went to talk to his friend Jack
Eigcn who introduced the couple.
He wanted to knew if he should
really marry her.
"Why not?" said Eigcn.
That was enough for Tommy.
Thus encouraged, he bought'a ring
and trotted off to Connecticut, where
Justice of the Peace Thomas J.
Breen, feeling that the couple had
waited so long already, bless their
hearts, waived the five-day law, and
married them on the spot..
