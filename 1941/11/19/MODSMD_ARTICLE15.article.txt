# 'Army Unable To Run Mines,' Says Expert
## Professor Hopkins Sees Possibility Of Union Switch 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Successful operation of the cap
tive coal mines by the army is an
impossibility, according to Dr. Wil
liam Hopkins, labor problems pro
fessor.
"It's easy to ask why doesn't the
President do something about this
defense strike, but actually there is
little that can be done without cre
ating new and more difficult prob
lems," Hopkins said.
Most obvious reason for the gov
ernment's inaction, according to
Hopkins, is the acute shortage of
non-union miners.
HIGHLY UNIONIZED
"Coal miners are among the most
highly unionized groups of labor in
the United States," Hopkins said.
"And the United Mine Workers ii
the largest union-in the world."
Consequently Hopkins concluded
that the federal government will not
be able to hire enough highly skilled
miners to operate the strategic cap
tive mines, if it should take up John
L. dare to "call out the
troops."
SHIFT TO A. F. of L.?
"There is one possible exception
to this defense dilemma," Hopkins
said. "Hie captive coal mine work
ers might desert the C.1.0. to join the
A. F. of L. miners' union. On the
basis of the A. F. of L. approval of
the Defense Mediation Board's de
cision, I presume that the A. F. of L.
union would operate the mines on
company terms."
Another imminent risk that the
government would incur by defying
the C.1.0. is a strike in consumer's
coal industries, Hopkins said. Union
strength supplemented by a large
union treasury would practically
guarantee the success of such a
strike.
"If such a strike lasted long
enough, it could freeze the entire
populations of the East and Middle
West," Hopkins stated. • "It would
also force severe hardships on both
consumer's goods and heavy goods
industries."
NO TROOP DISCIPLINE
Discipline of these strikers by
federal troops would be virtually im
possible in Hopkins' opinion.
"Nominally the Defense Mediation
Board decided against the C.1.0. de
mand for a closed shop in the cap
tive mines because it didn't want to
make such an important concession
to organized labor. Actually the
Board feared that permission for a
closed coal shop would precipitate a
demand for a closed shop in the steel
industries. A steel strike would cer
tainly be the result of such a de
mand because steel companies have
never granted a union shop," Hop
kins said.
Lewis' reasons for demanding a
closed shop in the captive coal mines
is that these miners should act with
the union because they get full
benefit of union wages, according to
Hopkins.

Successful operation of the cap
tive coal mines by the army is an
impossibility, according to Dr. Wil
liam Hopkins, labor problems pro
fessor.
"It's easy to ask why doesn't the
President do something about this
defense strike, but actually there is
little that can be done without cre
ating new and more difficult prob
lems," Hopkins said.
Most obvious reason for the gov
ernment's inaction, according to
Hopkins, is the acute shortage of
non-union miners.
HIGHLY UNIONIZED
"Coal miners are among the most
highly unionized groups of labor in
the United States," Hopkins said.
"And the United Mine Workers ii
the largest union-in the world."
Consequently Hopkins concluded
that the federal government will not
be able to hire enough highly skilled
miners to operate the strategic cap
tive mines, if it should take up John
L. dare to "call out the
troops."
SHIFT TO A. F. of L.?
"There is one possible exception
to this defense dilemma," Hopkins
said. "Hie captive coal mine work
ers might desert the C.1.0. to join the
A. F. of L. miners' union. On the
basis of the A. F. of L. approval of
the Defense Mediation Board's de
cision, I presume that the A. F. of L.
union would operate the mines on
company terms."
Another imminent risk that the
government would incur by defying
the C.1.0. is a strike in consumer's
coal industries, Hopkins said. Union
strength supplemented by a large
union treasury would practically
guarantee the success of such a
strike.
"If such a strike lasted long
enough, it could freeze the entire
populations of the East and Middle
West," Hopkins stated. • "It would
also force severe hardships on both
consumer's goods and heavy goods
industries."
NO TROOP DISCIPLINE
Discipline of these strikers by
federal troops would be virtually im
possible in Hopkins' opinion.
"Nominally the Defense Mediation
Board decided against the C.1.0. de
mand for a closed shop in the cap
tive mines because it didn't want to
make such an important concession
to organized labor. Actually the
Board feared that permission for a
closed coal shop would precipitate a
demand for a closed shop in the steel
industries. A steel strike would cer
tainly be the result of such a de
mand because steel companies have
never granted a union shop," Hop
kins said.
Lewis' reasons for demanding a
closed shop in the captive coal mines
is that these miners should act with
the union because they get full
benefit of union wages, according to
Hopkins.
