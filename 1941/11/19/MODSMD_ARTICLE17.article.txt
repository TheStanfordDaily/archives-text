# Roosevelt Blames Lewis For Coal Mine Strike; Labor Violence Grows
## U.M.W. Head Asserts Open Shop Menaces Commercial Agreements; 21,000 More Workers Walk Out 
### United Press 
President Roosevelt Tuesday night placed the blame directly upon
John 1,. Lewis for the captive mine walkout which spread during the day
to include an additional 21,000 miners and brought to a head moves inr
Congress for administration-hacked anti-strike legislation.
The President said Lewis, head of the striking United Mine Workers

(C.1.0.), had not given a "valid"
reason for continued demands for a
closed shop in the captive mines of
the big steel companies.
In direct reference to the Presi
dent's statement, Lewis said "any
suggestion" that the miners dishonor
their agreement providing a union
shop in commercial mines by giving
"more favorable conditions to the
great steel companies cannot be se
riously considered."
SO THEY LOCK HORNS
The President and Lewis thus
clashed head-on over the union shop
issue which is the sole point in the
dispute which has kept approxi
mately 4,3,000 out of 53,000
out of the captive pits for the second
day, brought one shooting scrape
and other violence and spread by the
hour to the commercial mines.
The first indication that the cap
tive mine shutdown was striking at
the heart of the defense program
came in an announcement from the
Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation
at Pittsburgh that six blast furnaces
would be made idle within 48 hours
for lack of fuel.
THREE-WEEK SUPPLY
The company said cutting out of
the furnaces would reduce steel
ingot production by 10 per cent.
Other large steel companies sup
plied by captive mines generally
wore believed to have sufficient
stocks of coal to operate for three
weeks.
President Roosevelt's concern with
the defense labor situation other
wise was demonstrated during the
i<jy by conferences with Congres
sional lieutenants on the general
strike situation and the captive coal
mine strike and with railroad man
agement and labor leaders concern
ing the scheduled nationwide rail
strike Dec. 7.
STRIKE CURBS PLANNED
In the first conference the Presi
dent. was understood to have given
a tacit -"go-ahead" to consideration
of legislative strike curbs. After tho
meeting, Chairman Mary T. Norton,
D., N.Jof the House Labor Com
mittee announced the group would
meet tomorrow to begin hearings on
a bill to revamp the Defense Me
diation Board.
Mrs. Norton said her bill was a
substitute for several pending anti
strike measures. Chiefly, it would
give mediation board decisions the
force of law.

STRIKE CURBS PLANNED
In the first conference the Presi
dent. was understood to have given
a tacit -"go-ahead" to consideration
of legislative strike curbs. After tho
meeting, Chairman Mary T. Norton,
D., N.Jof the House Labor Com
mittee announced the group would
meet tomorrow to begin hearings on
a bill to revamp the Defense Me
diation Board.
Mrs. Norton said her bill was a
substitute for several pending anti
strike measures. Chiefly, it would
give mediation board decisions the
force of law.
President Roosevelt Tuesday night placed the blame directly upon
John 1,. Lewis for the captive mine walkout which spread during the day
to include an additional 21,000 miners and brought to a head moves inr
Congress for administration-hacked anti-strike legislation.
The President said Lewis, head of the striking United Mine Workers

(C.1.0.), had not given a "valid"
reason for continued demands for a
closed shop in the captive mines of
the big steel companies.
In direct reference to the Presi
dent's statement, Lewis said "any
suggestion" that the miners dishonor
their agreement providing a union
shop in commercial mines by giving
"more favorable conditions to the
great steel companies cannot be se
riously considered."
SO THEY LOCK HORNS
The President and Lewis thus
clashed head-on over the union shop
issue which is the sole point in the
dispute which has kept approxi
mately 4,3,000 out of 53,000
out of the captive pits for the second
day, brought one shooting scrape
and other violence and spread by the
hour to the commercial mines.
The first indication that the cap
tive mine shutdown was striking at
the heart of the defense program
came in an announcement from the
Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation
at Pittsburgh that six blast furnaces
would be made idle within 48 hours
for lack of fuel.
THREE-WEEK SUPPLY
The company said cutting out of
the furnaces would reduce steel
ingot production by 10 per cent.
Other large steel companies sup
plied by captive mines generally
wore believed to have sufficient
stocks of coal to operate for three
weeks.
President Roosevelt's concern with
the defense labor situation other
wise was demonstrated during the
i<jy by conferences with Congres
sional lieutenants on the general
strike situation and the captive coal
mine strike and with railroad man
agement and labor leaders concern
ing the scheduled nationwide rail
strike Dec. 7.
