"What Stanford needs are more (ire plugs on Palm Drive." This opin
io) was offered hy Mike, a cinamon-colercd Irisli setter, as he trotted up
the aforementioned street on one of his daily walks.
Mike is the property of Dorothy Waite, a Stanford sophomore, and has
the distinction (if being the only d<tg owned hy a student right here on (he

campus. But it's all very legal,
mistress hastened to add, since .she
bo iids him at the Animal Shelter in
Palo Alto and brings him out to (he
campus each day.
ll was in that same Animal Shel
t •!• that Doltie found Mike and Mike
iound Dottie. "He rolled his eyes at
me as I was passing by the place one
day about five weeks ago and f sud
denly found myself minus five dol
lars and plus one Irish setter," his
mistress admitted.
Now Mike and Dot are bosom pals,
and each afternoon the latter walks
into Paly, collects Mike at the Ani
mal Shelter, takes him on an educa
tional tour of the campus, and brings
him back to his boarding school in
time for supper.
Mike's mistress is his greatest ad
mirer and assures everyone that he
is the friendliest, most agreeable dog
that ever lived. "He's only 13 months
old and has a lot to learn, but his
potentialities are great," she added.
There are a lot of advantages in
owning a dog at Stanford according
to this sophomore dog-lover. It's
wonderful relaxation from studying
to get out in the country and take
long walks with a dog, and (hough I
there is a certain expense in keeping
one, (he money one ordinarily
spends unwisely is usually enough
to keep the hungriest dog in bones.
