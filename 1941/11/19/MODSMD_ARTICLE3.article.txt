QUITE SURPRISED
"This is quite a surprise," said
Spragins when first told of his elec
tion, then added, "You're not kid
ding me?"
Bill Spragins attended Los An
geles High School and was student
body president in his senior year.
Before occupying this position he
was class president of the low
seniors.
He first got an idea about coming
to Stanford while he was in the
eighth grade. "I played quite a bit
of basketball and one time I watched
Stanford's Hank Luisetti play. I
suppose it sounds silly," he said,
"but it was then that I began to
think about coming to the Farm."
INTERESTED IN LAW
"Later in high school I became
interested in law. That and many
other things finally made my deci
sion definite," he added.
The new frosh president is on the
freshman basketball team at Stan
ford. For a career he is interested
in the diplomatic service, although
he has not yet come to a definite
conclusion.
Sue Price comes from Palo Alto,
and is one of the four chosen by the
Encina caucus to run for the office
of secretary-treasurer.
FATHER A STANFORD MAN
"Feels good," said Price when
asked how it felt to know she had
won. The secretary-treasurer held
the office of Commissioner of Social
Activities while in high school. Her
father is a Stanford m&n, but she
states that the main reason she
came was that she "likes it." She
first began to plan to come to the
Farm about five years ago.
Both she and Spragins stated they
wished to thank the voters for
their support.
Out of a possible 700, 472 stu
dents of the freshman class voted,
