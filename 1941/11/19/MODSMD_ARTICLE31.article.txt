# Pan-Hell Warns Sorority Women
## 
### 
Sorority women are reminded to
check up on Pan-Hellenic rushing
regulations concerning their activi
ties during Thanksgiving vacation by
Barbara Rapp, president of Pan-
Hellenic Council. She stressed that
any illegal contact with new women
will result in strict penalties.
With a throe-day period of enter
taining lor the new women last
week-end, the nine campus sorori
ties closed their rushing activities
until next quarter. Several hundred
women went up the Row for in
formal teas on Friday afternoon,
Saturday night, and Sunday after
noon.
Rushing will be resumed in Jan
uary when the formal rushing pe
riod opens. A series of dinners
starting January 8 will culminate in
pledging on the night of Jan. 17.
