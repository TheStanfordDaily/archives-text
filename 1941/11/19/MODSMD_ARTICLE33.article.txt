# Professors Do Defense Work
## Ross Develops Navy Achievement Tests 
### 
Four members of the psychology
department are now on leaves of
absence in order to work on defense
projects for the government, accord-
ing to Dr. Lewis M. Terman, head
of the department. They are Dr.
Robert T. Ross, Dr. Joseph Miller,
Dr. Quinn McNemar, and Richard
Miller.
Dr. Ross, assistant professor last
year, is on active duty as a lieu
tenant in the Naval Reserve, and is
working on problems of selection
and training of aviators. He has de
veloped special achievement tests
for use in the Navy, and has syste
matized the pilot instruction pro
gram. Dr. Ross is being assisted in
this work by Richard Miller, who
was a teaching assistant last year,
and was awarded a fellowship
which he resigned to enter the
Naval Reserve.
Doing confidential work in rela
tion to the measurement of physical
and mental conditions of pilots is Dr.
Joseph Miller, an instructor in the
department. His work is part of a
military research project at Harvard
University.
Also on leave, Dr. McNemar is
working on a special project of the
Social Science Research Council in
New York, and is spending part of
his time on a planning and research
division of the morale branch of the
Army.
One of the most important defense
jobs in the country, that of Co-ordi
nator of Pilot Research, is held by
Jack Dunlap, former research as
sistant to Dr. Terman. According to
Dr. Terman, about half of the
former psychology students at Stan
ford are now doing war work.
