## Emotional Hysteria Here, Warns Speaker In Tuesday Series 
### 
Howard Pierce Davis, in an ad
dress to the Tuesday Series au<li
cncc last night, warned against a
hysterical approach to the back
ground or foreground of the present
world crisis. His subject, "History
or Hysteria," stressed ten points of
warning to the United States in deal
ing with the international situation.
Mr. Davis started by reducing the
troubles of the world to four basic
sources: the spiritual, economic, po
litical and psychological.
"As a civilization we arc victims
of a spiritual poverty," he said. "We
have become guilty of a type of
practical atheism for which we are
paying roundly."
EMOTIONAL FACTOR
"We are the victims of an emo
tional instability to which two fac
tors are contributory: the new ex
posure to mass news, and the skill
ful use of the art of propaganda," he
declared.
Quoting President Wilson, Mr.
Davis added, "If this civilization is
to be materially redeemed, it must
be spiritually redeemed."
Speaking of the post-war period,
he stated that "because democracy
sabotaged the 14 points, the Hitler
regime was spawned in an atmos
phere of disillusionment."
RUB OUT ADOLPH'
"Rub out Adolph, dispose of Mus
solini, find something to do with
Stalin, and then go back to business
as usual," was his advice. "Pri
marily, however, not Hitler, but what
he stands for should be destroyed—
that is, the repudiation of the con
cepts of democracy and the brother
hood of man."
In conclusion Mr. Davis offered a
ten-point program to deal with the
three current crises: the Hitler war,
crisis in the Pacific, and the labor
trouble at home.
TEN-POINT PROGRAM
(1) Dispose of Japan which, has
great nuisance value to Hitler and
the European war; (2) Expose pos
sibilities of peace in Europe and (3)
if there are no possibilities for a
negotiated peace, the U.S. must pre
pare for an all-out military effort
which would involve an A.E.F. (4)
Pin Britain down to concrete pro
posals for a post-war set-up. (5)
American people must not go off on
an emotional bender concerning the
question of labor. (6) Maintain vigi
lant watch over the institutions of
democracy at home. (7) Do not ex
pect that the victory will solve all
problems. (8) Prepare to be very
stern in post-war deliberation. (9)
Develop good-neighbor policy with
unabated zeal. (10) Prepare to feed
and police the world for a long time
to come.

ground or foreground of the present
world crisis. His subject, "History
or Hysteria," stressed ten points of
warning to the United States in deal
ing with the international situation.
Mr. Davis started by reducing the
troubles of the world to four basic
sources: the spiritual, economic, po
litical and psychological.
"As a civilization we arc victims
of a spiritual poverty," he said. "We
have become guilty of a type of
practical atheism for which we are
paying roundly."
EMOTIONAL FACTOR
"We are the victims of an emo
tional instability to which two fac
tors are contributory: the new ex
posure to mass news, and the skill
ful use of the art of propaganda," he
declared.
Quoting President Wilson, Mr.
Davis added, "If this civilization is
to be materially redeemed, it must
be spiritually redeemed."
Speaking of the post-war period,
he stated that "because democracy
sabotaged the 14 points, the Hitler
regime was spawned in an atmos
phere of disillusionment."
RUB OUT ADOLPH'
"Rub out Adolph, dispose of Mus
solini, find something to do with
Stalin, and then go back to business
as usual," was his advice. "Pri
marily, however, not Hitler, but what
he stands for should be destroyed—
that is, the repudiation of the con
cepts of democracy and the brother
hood of man."
In conclusion Mr. Davis offered a
ten-point program to deal with the
three current crises: the Hitler war,
crisis in the Pacific, and the labor
trouble at home.
TEN-POINT PROGRAM
(1) Dispose of Japan which, has
great nuisance value to Hitler and
the European war; (2) Expose pos
sibilities of peace in Europe and (3)
if there are no possibilities for a
negotiated peace, the U.S. must pre
pare for an all-out military effort
which would involve an A.E.F. (4)
Pin Britain down to concrete pro
posals for a post-war set-up. (5)
American people must not go off on
an emotional bender concerning the
question of labor. (6) Maintain vigi
lant watch over the institutions of
democracy at home. (7) Do not ex
pect that the victory will solve all
problems. (8) Prepare to be very
stern in post-war deliberation. (9)
Develop good-neighbor policy with
unabated zeal. (10) Prepare to feed
and police the world for a long time
to come.
