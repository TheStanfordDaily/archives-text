# Campus Queens Throw Hips; Gaieties Provokes Hysteria
## 
### 
II il were possible to whistle on paper, a whistle would follow this
statement. The reason for the non-existent whistle involves a peek into
the Ham's Head room any evening in th near future.
One dozen C.Q.'s —campus queens—are throwing their hips all over
the room. This is not just a reducing exercise or a divertissement, hut it

is practice for a little background.,
work in the coming Big Game Gaie
ties, although how they can be kept
in the background is a problem
even Asher Bolden Wilson, director
of the show, has yet to adequately
cope with.
CRANE DIRECTS C.Q.'S
Margo Crane from her vantage I
point on a chair on a table directs
the actions of these C.Q.'s. Two other
terpsichorean phantasies directed by
blonde Miss Crane, two by Adolfo
Alias, and one by Jackie Foley give
the show an abundance of sylph
like movement.
Moving on to another part of the
Stanford Memorial Theater's cata
combs, the green room to be exact, !
an observer would come upon a
scene of tranquil hysteria. Only
persons in the room splitting their
sides wider and more often lhan
Wilson are Charley Bulotti and Har
ry Muheim, '39 and '40 Gaities heads, i
respectively.
MUHEIM AND BULOTTI
Muheim, now being funny pro
fessionally along with Al Zelver and
Jaypee Cahn down in Hollywood,
came all the way back to the Farm
to get a quick look at the 1941 BGG
before it takes the boards, a term
which means absolutely nothing to
the layman. Bulotti, now taking a
graduate business course at the Al
pha Phi house, pops in frequently
to lend his experience to the al
ready over-experienced of
Big Shots.
When B. G. Miller, Wilson's first
assistant, was asked whether or not
it was true that the show was to
have a sneak preview at Mountain
View a few nights before it opens
here, he replied, "Mene, mene, tekel,
upharsin," in typical theatrical
fashion.
HANSEN NEEDS CREVV
Technical work on the show has
gotten under way with Art Hansen
leading a crew of about half enough
men in the set-building.
F. Marion Scott, who handles the
musical end of the show, has ex
erted his tremendous personality to
the extent that every beautiful girl
on campus with a voice, and some
without, have given their services
to the show. *
In answer to a question concern
ing the remaining factor of a good
Gaieties, the humor, Wilson said,
"We've got enough gags to choke a
horse. Get it?—gag—chokle. W>.'
wouldn't be giving out killers like
that if we were short on humor,
would we?"
