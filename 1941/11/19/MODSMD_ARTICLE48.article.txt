# Roble Women Hear Medical Serenade
## 
### 
The women of Roble got out of
bed at midnight Monday and made
a mad dash to the front windowsâ€”
the Med Student Chorus was honor
ing them with a serenade.
Since the serenade had come as a
surprise, the girls had not prepared
for "window hanging out," and from
the ground they looked like three
rows of glorified cold cream and
curlers, according to the young
"docs."

An odd double piay occurred in a
game between Oakland and Tacoma
in 1905 when six players partici
pated in u double play, both put
outs being made by the centerfielder.
