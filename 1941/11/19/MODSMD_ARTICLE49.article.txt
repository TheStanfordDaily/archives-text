# Varsity Soccer Eleven Plays UCLA Today in Return Meet
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's Stanford varsity soccer eleven bumps up
against the first of its opponents on a week-end three-game schedule at
this afternoon, when it takes on the Bruins of U.C.L.A. in a return game.
Two weeks ago the Maloneymen lost a 2-to-l decision to the U.C.L.A.
outfit, but that was not the relative strength of the two teams since Stan-

ford went into the fray without a.
single substitute. Many of the In
dians had to play positions they had
never played before.
MALONEY OPTIMISTIC
Today, Maloney has his team at
full strength and is optimistic as to
the outcome.
"This ought to be a fine game,"
said Coach Maloney. "I will be able
to put two full teams on the field."
Last Saturday Stanford fought
the San Mateo kickers to a 1-1
standstill. San Mateo is one of the
strongest and the smoothest teams
in the Bay Region.
REVISED LINE-UP
Coach Maloney named the line-up
for today's game as follows: Jack
Burns, goal; Hank Peters, right full;
Oliver Hamlin, left lull; Howard
Vose, right half; John Pagen, center
half; Ray Chapot, left half; Fer
nando Eleta, outside right; Johnny
Gertridge, inside right; A1 Wool,
center forward; Fred Carnie, inside
lelt; and Tony Gunterman, outside
left.
Since the U.CJj.A. defeat, Coach
Maloney has shifted the soccer line
up. The new combination that
worked well against San Mateo
finds Eleta moved to right wing,
Gertridge at inside right, Wool in
the center forward position, Carnie
filling the inside right spot and
Gunterman at left wing.
