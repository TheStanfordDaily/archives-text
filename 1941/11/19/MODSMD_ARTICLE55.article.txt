TJULBERT H. EVERETT'S Eastern All-Stars will engage the Walden
Western All-Stars in a mythical game to be played in the Los Altos
Stadium Thanksgiving Day. The H.H.E.E.A.S. team, composed of col
legiate players from the other side of the Mississippi, was chosen by Hul
bert "Just-Call-Me-Hap," local authority on such matters. The W.WA.S.
team, as you might expect, was gathered together by The Daily assistant
sports editor.
Here are the teams that will be on the field when the ball is kickoffed:
H.H.E.E.A.S. Pos. W.W.A.S.
Jap Davis (Ala.) LLR Nick SusoefT (W.S.C.)
Stubby Pearson (Dart.) LIE Dick Wildung (Minn.)
Endicott Peabody (Harv.) LGR Chuck Taylor Itali (Stan.)
Don Suavely (Corn.) C Ray Jenkins (Mo.)
Pete Houston (Ohio St.) RGL Ray Frankovvski (Wash.)
Gene Flathman (Navy) RTL Joe Pasqua (S.M.U.)
Charley Anderson (Ohio St.) REL Freddie Meyer Rah (Stan.)
Paul Governali (Col.) Q Frankie Albert Rah (Stan.)
Edgar Jones (Pitt.) LIIR Pete Kmetovic Rah (Stan.)
Frank Sinkwich (Ga.) RHL Owen Price (Texas Mines)
Dippy Evans (N.D. F Bob Robertson (U.S.C.)

We did not include Huts! Ralle of Tulane, because we couldn't decide
which side of the Mississippi he belonged on.

Tickets for the game will go on
j sale at the B.A.C. tomorrow eve
ning. Four tickets will be allotted to
j each person with a student body
j card who cannot answer any ques
] tions from the bailout.
For those poor unbeknighted souls
I who are going home for the next
few days, the results of the game will
j be posted in Monday's Daily.

jp'VEN thought "Escalator Sam"
Barry is still struggling with the
complexities of devising some type
j of football offense which can 'make
yards against high school or college
teams, the word comes up from
God's country that casaba prospects
on Univeristy Avenue are much bet
ter than average.
Eddie Oram, former All-American
guard for the Trojans and now act
ing mentor, greeted 30 prospects
several weeks ago at their first
workout. After the first week of
work the following quintet has

emerged as the starting line-up: Bob Ormsby and Alex Omalev, forwards;
Len Berg, center; John Luber and Ted Gossard, guards.
After only three games of Southern California's conference schedule
have been played, Luber, one of the best defensive guards on the Coast
this year, will go into a branch of Uncle Sam's great armed forces. None
of the three league games are with L.S.J.U. Steve Miletich will be his
likely successor.
Particularly disheartening to Trojan opponents was the news that
Sig Jacobson and Bob Dewitt, the two high-scoring forwards on the
15)40 Modesto Jaysee state championship hoop team, have enrolled in
L'.S.C. and will be very eligible for the coming season.

VV/HILE on the early-bird subject of basketball, a mention of the north
ern picture alonp this line is quite in order, considering that it was
the Northern Division P.C.C. champs last year, Washington State (we seem
to be having a lot of trouble with them), which put the damper on the
flashy Farm team of a year ago.

TJULBERT H. EVERETT'S Eastern All-Stars will engage the Walden
Western All-Stars in a mythical game to be played in the Los Altos
Stadium Thanksgiving Day. The H.H.E.E.A.S. team, composed of col
legiate players from the other side of the Mississippi, was chosen by Hul
bert "Just-Call-Me-Hap," local authority on such matters. The W.WA.S.
team, as you might expect, was gathered together by The Daily assistant
sports editor.
Here are the teams that will be on the field when the ball is kickoffed:
H.H.E.E.A.S. Pos. W.W.A.S.
Jap Davis (Ala.) LLR Nick SusoefT (W.S.C.)
Stubby Pearson (Dart.) LIE Dick Wildung (Minn.)
Endicott Peabody (Harv.) LGR Chuck Taylor Itali (Stan.)
Don Suavely (Corn.) C Ray Jenkins (Mo.)
Pete Houston (Ohio St.) RGL Ray Frankovvski (Wash.)
Gene Flathman (Navy) RTL Joe Pasqua (S.M.U.)
Charley Anderson (Ohio St.) REL Freddie Meyer Rah (Stan.)
Paul Governali (Col.) Q Frankie Albert Rah (Stan.)
Edgar Jones (Pitt.) LIIR Pete Kmetovic Rah (Stan.)
Frank Sinkwich (Ga.) RHL Owen Price (Texas Mines)
Dippy Evans (N.D. F Bob Robertson (U.S.C.)

We did not include Huts! Ralle of Tulane, because we couldn't decide
which side of the Mississippi he belonged on.

Tickets for the game will go on
j sale at the B.A.C. tomorrow eve
ning. Four tickets will be allotted to
j each person with a student body
j card who cannot answer any ques
] tions from the bailout.
For those poor unbeknighted souls
I who are going home for the next
few days, the results of the game will
j be posted in Monday's Daily.

Barry is still struggling with the
complexities of devising some type
j of football offense which can 'make
yards against high school or college
teams, the word comes up from
God's country that casaba prospects
on Univeristy Avenue are much bet
ter than average.
Eddie Oram, former All-American
guard for the Trojans and now act
ing mentor, greeted 30 prospects
several weeks ago at their first
workout. After the first week of
work the following quintet has

emerged as the starting line-up: Bob Ormsby and Alex Omalev, forwards;
Len Berg, center; John Luber and Ted Gossard, guards.
After only three games of Southern California's conference schedule
have been played, Luber, one of the best defensive guards on the Coast
this year, will go into a branch of Uncle Sam's great armed forces. None
of the three league games are with L.S.J.U. Steve Miletich will be his
likely successor.
Particularly disheartening to Trojan opponents was the news that
Sig Jacobson and Bob Dewitt, the two high-scoring forwards on the
15)40 Modesto Jaysee state championship hoop team, have enrolled in
L'.S.C. and will be very eligible for the coming season.

VV/HILE on the early-bird subject of basketball, a mention of the north
ern picture alonp this line is quite in order, considering that it was
the Northern Division P.C.C. champs last year, Washington State (we seem
to be having a lot of trouble with them), which put the damper on the
flashy Farm team of a year ago.
