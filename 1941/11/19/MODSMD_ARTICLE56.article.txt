# Doug Mills Out As 'Zup' Successor
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 18 (UP).—Uni
versity of Illinois trustees recovered
quickly today from the shock of Bob
Zuppke's resignation as head foot
ball coach and cleared the way for
naming his successor by elevating
youthful Doug Mills to a full ath
letic directorship.
At the same time, they cut the
list of candidates for the job Zup
held for 29 years by eliminating
Mills, Zuppke's own choice.
Mills, acting athletic director dur
ing the year's leave of absence forced
on Wendell S. Wilson after another
Zuppke squabble last spring, is head
basketball coach and football as
sistant. When he becomes the per
manent athletic director at the ex
piration of Wilson's term in Septem
ber, 1942, he must drop his football
duties.
BURT INGWERSEN
Wilh Mills out of the running, the
outstanding candidate appeared to
be Burt Ingwersen, now line coach
at Northwestern, who once was
aid and later head coach at lowa.
Mills often has commented favorably
on Ingwersen.
Also mentioned were Don Peden
of Ohio University and Carl Voyles
of William and Mary, both former
Illinois players. A surprise choice
of many alumni was Charles
(Chuck) Palmer, one-time North
western fullback, who has turned in
an amazing record at Chicago's Fen
ger High School. Fenger has domi
nated the city championships for
three years, much in the manner of
Paul Brown's teams at Massillon, O.
Zuppke went directly to Illinois
in 1913 after successes at a high
school in Oak Park, 111.
MILLS RECOMMENDED
Members of the athletic board re
vealed today they had decided sev
eral days ago to recommend Mills
for the full-time position and indi
cated that led Zuppke to spring his
surprise resignation Monday night
altSiough Illinois still must play
Northwestern this week.
In Zup's statement, he said he had
been ready to leave Illinois any time
he felt its athletic future was in
good hands. He meant that as an
endorsement of Mills.
The trustees still haven't an offi
cial signed statement from the little
Dutchman and suggested his resig
nation be sent through the regular
channels —to the athletic board,
thence to President Arthur Cutts
Willard and then to the trustees for
final action.
VOTE FOR MILLS
Despite this careful course, the
quick vote cast for Mills indicated
the trustees are anxious to have a
man in full authority to direct a
search for a new coach.
Zuppke, meanwhile, maintained
his silence at Champaign as he pre
pared his scrapping little team for
his 223 rd game of his college coach
ing career. The Illini are definite
underdogs—at least by two touch
downs—for the Northwestern game.

on Wendell S. Wilson after another
Zuppke squabble last spring, is head
basketball coach and football as
sistant. When he becomes the per
manent athletic director at the ex
piration of Wilson's term in Septem
ber, 1942, he must drop his football
duties.
BURT INGWERSEN
Wilh Mills out of the running, the
outstanding candidate appeared to
be Burt Ingwersen, now line coach
at Northwestern, who once was
aid and later head coach at lowa.
Mills often has commented favorably
on Ingwersen.
Also mentioned were Don Peden
of Ohio University and Carl Voyles
of William and Mary, both former
Illinois players. A surprise choice
of many alumni was Charles
(Chuck) Palmer, one-time North
western fullback, who has turned in
an amazing record at Chicago's Fen
ger High School. Fenger has domi
nated the city championships for
three years, much in the manner of
Paul Brown's teams at Massillon, O.
Zuppke went directly to Illinois
in 1913 after successes at a high
school in Oak Park, 111.
MILLS RECOMMENDED
Members of the athletic board re
vealed today they had decided sev
eral days ago to recommend Mills
for the full-time position and indi
cated that led Zuppke to spring his
surprise resignation Monday night
altSiough Illinois still must play
Northwestern this week.
In Zup's statement, he said he had
been ready to leave Illinois any time
he felt its athletic future was in
good hands. He meant that as an
endorsement of Mills.
The trustees still haven't an offi
cial signed statement from the little
Dutchman and suggested his resig
nation be sent through the regular
channels —to the athletic board,
thence to President Arthur Cutts
Willard and then to the trustees for
final action.
VOTE FOR MILLS
Despite this careful course, the
quick vote cast for Mills indicated
the trustees are anxious to have a
man in full authority to direct a
search for a new coach.
Zuppke, meanwhile, maintained
his silence at Champaign as he pre
pared his scrapping little team for
his 223 rd game of his college coach
ing career. The Illini are definite
underdogs—at least by two touch
downs—for the Northwestern game.
CHICAGO, Nov. 18 (UP).—Uni
versity of Illinois trustees recovered
quickly today from the shock of Bob
Zuppke's resignation as head foot
ball coach and cleared the way for
naming his successor by elevating
youthful Doug Mills to a full ath
letic directorship.
At the same time, they cut the
list of candidates for the job Zup
held for 29 years by eliminating
Mills, Zuppke's own choice.
Mills, acting athletic director dur
ing the year's leave of absence forced
on Wendell S. Wilson after another
