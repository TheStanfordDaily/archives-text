## 
### 
After being held almost even for three quarters by a stubborn San
Jose State water polo team, Stanford's varsity mermen broke loose in the
final period, to win. S to .'{, in a game held here yesterday afternoon.
Tying for scoring honors with two points each were Bill Mapel, Iladley
Bacon and Bob Mind of Stanford and Marty Taylor, San Jose State forward.

Breaking the ice for the Indians,
Bill Mapel, Farm sprint man, scored
first to put Stanford into a l-to-0
lead. Teammate Bob Jones followed
closely behind, scoring on a tip-in
assist by Grant Culley.
The Spartans did little in the first
quartet, making no goals and only
being allowed two scoring attempts
by the alert Stanford defense.
But the second quarter saw San
Jose knot up the tally after Taylor
scored on a long dribble, followed a
few minutes later by teammate Cor
coran. Just before the end of the
half. Bacon scored from directly in
front of the goalie's cage, putting
Stanford ahead, 3 to 2.
SPARTANS THREATEN
The third quarter saw San Jose
State still threatening. Taylor again
tied up the score, but Mitchell fol
lowed later in the quarter with an
other score and Stanford once more

j went in the lead. Bob Hind, who
replaced Captain Frank Mitchell,
scored again for Stanford as the
quarter ended.
The final quarter saw Stanford in
complete control over the Spartans,
champion of the Bay Cities League.
Hadley Bacon broke away from
brother Doug, San Jose swimmer, to
score, followed by Mapel, who
made the score 7 to 3.
HIND MAKES LAST ONE
A split second before the gun
went off to end the game, Hind
pushed in the final goal directly in
front of the goalie's cage.
Coach Norton Thornton liked the
play of his entire team and particu
larly praised the work of Goalie Ed
Smith, who filled in for Pete Lee.
who was out with a cold. Smith
played consistently, making some
good stops.
