# Induction Method For Army Changed
## 
### 
California s 284 local Selective
Service Boards were today advised
by state headquarters of exact pro
cedure to be followed under the
revised induction plan for physical
examination and induction of reg
istrants.
The Stale Director of Selective
Service advised that the customary
procedure will be followed for reg
istrants selected for the 18th and
19th calls, but that those coming up
after December 5 will be physically
examined and inducted according
to the revised induction plan. This
plan is to furnish registrants with
reasonable notice prior to induction
as to acceptability by the Army and
to decrease last-minute rejections at
induction stations.
