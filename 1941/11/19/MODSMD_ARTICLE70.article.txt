### DON SELBY 
THE Stanford Indians and the California Bears take time out
Saturday for the first time sinre their seasons began on Sept. 27, play
carries on in the Pacific Coast Conference with just two slight, chances of
the standings being radically changed.
Those two chances are in the Oregon-Washington game and in the
| Oregon State-Montana fracas. Upsets by Oregon and Montana, respec
| lively, would cross up the experts no end and definitely help what chances
| Stanford has of still getting the Rose Bowl bid. However, such outcomes
i just aren't to be expected, and Luckie Louie agrees in his following picks
for the week-end in Coast football. He chooses:
Santa Clara over Ucla—despite Waterfield's passing.
Notre Dame over U.S.C.—Robertson can't do it by himself.
WASHINGTON OVER OREGON—close but Huskies are more sound.
OREGON STATE OVER MONTANA—just a breather for the Beavers.
Fordham over St. Mary's—Gaels outclassed badly.
U.S.F. over S.F. State—Dons improving all the time.
Washington State over Gonzaga—non-conference, Cougars too strong.

jy/jAYBE IT'S because they were the favored team to play in the Rose
Bowl from the beginning; but it seems that Stanford is the only in
stitution not involved in the hollering for the bid.
Some might say that the Indians have no right to holler for it, and they
might be right. But Stanford would have just as much as the Washington
State team, despite the fact that the Cougars defeated the Indians last
Saturday. Rccords show that.
Evidently, Babe Hollingbery, the W.S.C. mentor, doesn't feel that way
about it, for he's screaming his head off up in Pullman about why his team
j should be in the Pasadena canyon come New Year's Day. This despite the
fact that the Cougars dropped games to Ucla, U.S.C., and Washington.
Washington State has a game scheduled with Texas A. &M. for
Tacoma on Dec. (i, but the Italic-thinks the contest should lie played in
the Bowl on Jan. 1.
There's another subject that Hollingbery is running off at the mouth
about. He says that sports writers and coaches in this sector are blaming
Stanford's loss Saturday to wet weather. The weather really wasn't wet,
true, but neither have we heard or read of anyone saying it was. And, as
for only one ball being used, that's so much hokum, because we definitely
saw the officials trade footballs during the encounter.
It's doubtful if his cries, pleas, moans, etc., will have very much influ
ence when it comes to the Rose Bowl vote being taken, however. Perhaps
his motive is an attempt to get the public on the side of Washington State,
for he can't be blamed very much.
AND THE BOWL FEVER IS SPREADING RAPIDLY, EAST AND
WEST. NORTH AND SOUTH.

LONG BEACH comes the following letter in regard to the All-
Coast eleven we picked in this column last week (before we saw W.S.C. '
play):
"Really, how funny you are. Only five Indians on the All-Coast
team. One from 0.5.C.; no W.S.C. players. Yet: Oregon State 1(1,
Indians 0; Washington State 14. Indians 13—lucky W.S.C. not 27.
"Try picking another team, you couldn't be worse."
"Ex 0.5.C."

If it weren't that we think Nick Susoeff, the great W.S.C. end, deserves
a place on the eleven we picked, we wouldn't bother to answer this, since
the writer doesn't offer anyone to replace the five Stanford gridders.
After seeing the Cougars lick Stanford, we would changc the team only
in one spot, putting Susoeff at end instead of Santa Clara's Alyn Beals,
who didn't look at all good defensively against St. Mary's. Which still
leaves us with five Stanford men. Convince us that there are better men
at the same positions, and the team will be revised again.
Speaking of All-Something teams, Jack Mahon starts the ball rolling
with his All-American team in the December issue of SWANK MAGA
ZINE. He includes Freddie Meyer and Frank Albert of Stanford and Ray
Frankowski of Washington on the first team. No other Westerners are
mentioned anywhere on the selections.

LONG BEACH comes the following letter in regard to the All-
Coast eleven we picked in this column last week (before we saw W.S.C. '
play):
"Really, how funny you are. Only five Indians on the All-Coast
team. One from 0.5.C.; no W.S.C. players. Yet: Oregon State 1(1,
Indians 0; Washington State 14. Indians 13—lucky W.S.C. not 27.
"Try picking another team, you couldn't be worse."
"Ex 0.5.C."

If it weren't that we think Nick Susoeff, the great W.S.C. end, deserves
a place on the eleven we picked, we wouldn't bother to answer this, since
the writer doesn't offer anyone to replace the five Stanford gridders.
After seeing the Cougars lick Stanford, we would changc the team only
in one spot, putting Susoeff at end instead of Santa Clara's Alyn Beals,
who didn't look at all good defensively against St. Mary's. Which still
leaves us with five Stanford men. Convince us that there are better men
at the same positions, and the team will be revised again.
Speaking of All-Something teams, Jack Mahon starts the ball rolling
with his All-American team in the December issue of SWANK MAGA
ZINE. He includes Freddie Meyer and Frank Albert of Stanford and Ray
Frankowski of Washington on the first team. No other Westerners are
mentioned anywhere on the selections.
THE Stanford Indians and the California Bears take time out
Saturday for the first time sinre their seasons began on Sept. 27, play
carries on in the Pacific Coast Conference with just two slight, chances of
the standings being radically changed.
Those two chances are in the Oregon-Washington game and in the
| Oregon State-Montana fracas. Upsets by Oregon and Montana, respec
| lively, would cross up the experts no end and definitely help what chances
| Stanford has of still getting the Rose Bowl bid. However, such outcomes
i just aren't to be expected, and Luckie Louie agrees in his following picks
for the week-end in Coast football. He chooses:
Santa Clara over Ucla—despite Waterfield's passing.
Notre Dame over U.S.C.—Robertson can't do it by himself.
WASHINGTON OVER OREGON—close but Huskies are more sound.
OREGON STATE OVER MONTANA—just a breather for the Beavers.
Fordham over St. Mary's—Gaels outclassed badly.
U.S.F. over S.F. State—Dons improving all the time.
Washington State over Gonzaga—non-conference, Cougars too strong.

jy/jAYBE IT'S because they were the favored team to play in the Rose
Bowl from the beginning; but it seems that Stanford is the only in
stitution not involved in the hollering for the bid.
Some might say that the Indians have no right to holler for it, and they
might be right. But Stanford would have just as much as the Washington
State team, despite the fact that the Cougars defeated the Indians last
Saturday. Rccords show that.
Evidently, Babe Hollingbery, the W.S.C. mentor, doesn't feel that way
about it, for he's screaming his head off up in Pullman about why his team
j should be in the Pasadena canyon come New Year's Day. This despite the
fact that the Cougars dropped games to Ucla, U.S.C., and Washington.
Washington State has a game scheduled with Texas A. &M. for
Tacoma on Dec. (i, but the Italic-thinks the contest should lie played in

carries on in the Pacific Coast Conference with just two slight, chances of
the standings being radically changed.
Those two chances are in the Oregon-Washington game and in the
| Oregon State-Montana fracas. Upsets by Oregon and Montana, respec
| lively, would cross up the experts no end and definitely help what chances
| Stanford has of still getting the Rose Bowl bid. However, such outcomes
i just aren't to be expected, and Luckie Louie agrees in his following picks
for the week-end in Coast football. He chooses:
Santa Clara over Ucla—despite Waterfield's passing.
Notre Dame over U.S.C.—Robertson can't do it by himself.
WASHINGTON OVER OREGON—close but Huskies are more sound.
OREGON STATE OVER MONTANA—just a breather for the Beavers.
Fordham over St. Mary's—Gaels outclassed badly.
U.S.F. over S.F. State—Dons improving all the time.
Washington State over Gonzaga—non-conference, Cougars too strong.

jy/jAYBE IT'S because they were the favored team to play in the Rose
Bowl from the beginning; but it seems that Stanford is the only in
stitution not involved in the hollering for the bid.
Some might say that the Indians have no right to holler for it, and they
might be right. But Stanford would have just as much as the Washington
State team, despite the fact that the Cougars defeated the Indians last
Saturday. Rccords show that.
Evidently, Babe Hollingbery, the W.S.C. mentor, doesn't feel that way
about it, for he's screaming his head off up in Pullman about why his team
j should be in the Pasadena canyon come New Year's Day. This despite the
fact that the Cougars dropped games to Ucla, U.S.C., and Washington.
Washington State has a game scheduled with Texas A. &M. for
Tacoma on Dec. (i, but the Italic-thinks the contest should lie played in
the Bowl on Jan. 1.
There's another subject that Hollingbery is running off at the mouth
about. He says that sports writers and coaches in this sector are blaming
Stanford's loss Saturday to wet weather. The weather really wasn't wet,
true, but neither have we heard or read of anyone saying it was. And, as
for only one ball being used, that's so much hokum, because we definitely
saw the officials trade footballs during the encounter.
It's doubtful if his cries, pleas, moans, etc., will have very much influ
ence when it comes to the Rose Bowl vote being taken, however. Perhaps
his motive is an attempt to get the public on the side of Washington State,
for he can't be blamed very much.
AND THE BOWL FEVER IS SPREADING RAPIDLY, EAST AND
WEST. NORTH AND SOUTH.

LONG BEACH comes the following letter in regard to the All-
Coast eleven we picked in this column last week (before we saw W.S.C. '
play):
"Really, how funny you are. Only five Indians on the All-Coast
team. One from 0.5.C.; no W.S.C. players. Yet: Oregon State 1(1,
Indians 0; Washington State 14. Indians 13—lucky W.S.C. not 27.
"Try picking another team, you couldn't be worse."
"Ex 0.5.C."

If it weren't that we think Nick Susoeff, the great W.S.C. end, deserves
a place on the eleven we picked, we wouldn't bother to answer this, since
the writer doesn't offer anyone to replace the five Stanford gridders.
After seeing the Cougars lick Stanford, we would changc the team only
in one spot, putting Susoeff at end instead of Santa Clara's Alyn Beals,
who didn't look at all good defensively against St. Mary's. Which still
leaves us with five Stanford men. Convince us that there are better men
at the same positions, and the team will be revised again.
Speaking of All-Something teams, Jack Mahon starts the ball rolling
with his All-American team in the December issue of SWANK MAGA
ZINE. He includes Freddie Meyer and Frank Albert of Stanford and Ray
Frankowski of Washington on the first team. No other Westerners are
mentioned anywhere on the selections.
