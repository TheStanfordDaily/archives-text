BIG GAME WEEK means a lot of things to
Stanford. One of the most colorful and
prominent parts of the pre-game celebrations
in the past has been the Big Game parade.
Practically every living and eating organiza
tion on the campus gets together a float. They
all parade down the Row each hoping to win
one of the many prizes, all ending at the Pavilion
for the biggest rally of the year.
Yes, the Big Game Parade is an absolutely
essential part of the celebrations.
We would not like to see it dropped.
But it may be dropped if some of the organiza
tions can't think up some better ideas for floats
than were exhibited last year.
Because floats which are coarse, vulgar, or
in other ways in bad taste are going to be
weeded out by a committee of three students
at the top of the Row. If they have to weed
out very many, you can see how much parade
will be left.
But it is either keep it clean this year, or not
have one next year.
Some of us might not have thought, when
looking over many of last year's floats, that
there was anything coarse or obscene or vulgar
about them. We might have even thought they
were pretty funny. But our sense of humor is a
little different from the general public's.
The public has a pretty good opinion of our
rooting section, of our general deportment. A
rather small number of the public comes in
contact with the float parade. But they still
come and they don't want to be offended.
Some might say that we should keep all
outsiders out —just so we can have some risque
floats. This is a pretty poor argument. Palo
Alto likes to feel that it is a college town. They
like the atmosphere. Their merchants donate
trucks for the floats and for the bonfire.
Owners of firms who generously donate their
equipment don't particularly like to see their
truck running around with a pretty stinking dis
play on it.
It is too bad that Ex Committee had to go as
far as providing "float censors." It's too bad
that they couldn't have just told the houses
that floats should not include this or that, that
they should be in good taste, and let it go at that.
But Ex Committee wants to have the parade
next year.

were pretty funny. But our sense of humor is a
little different from the general public's.
The public has a pretty good opinion of our
rooting section, of our general deportment. A
rather small number of the public comes in
contact with the float parade. But they still
come and they don't want to be offended.
Some might say that we should keep all
outsiders out —just so we can have some risque
floats. This is a pretty poor argument. Palo
Alto likes to feel that it is a college town. They
like the atmosphere. Their merchants donate
trucks for the floats and for the bonfire.
Owners of firms who generously donate their
equipment don't particularly like to see their
truck running around with a pretty stinking dis
play on it.
It is too bad that Ex Committee had to go as
far as providing "float censors." It's too bad
that they couldn't have just told the houses
that floats should not include this or that, that
they should be in good taste, and let it go at that.
But Ex Committee wants to have the parade
next year.
BIG GAME WEEK means a lot of things to
Stanford. One of the most colorful and
prominent parts of the pre-game celebrations
in the past has been the Big Game parade.
Practically every living and eating organiza
tion on the campus gets together a float. They
all parade down the Row each hoping to win
one of the many prizes, all ending at the Pavilion
for the biggest rally of the year.
Yes, the Big Game Parade is an absolutely
essential part of the celebrations.
We would not like to see it dropped.
But it may be dropped if some of the organiza
tions can't think up some better ideas for floats
than were exhibited last year.
Because floats which are coarse, vulgar, or
in other ways in bad taste are going to be
weeded out by a committee of three students
at the top of the Row. If they have to weed
out very many, you can see how much parade
will be left.
But it is either keep it clean this year, or not
have one next year.
Some of us might not have thought, when
looking over many of last year's floats, that
there was anything coarse or obscene or vulgar
about them. We might have even thought they
were pretty funny. But our sense of humor is a
little different from the general public's.
