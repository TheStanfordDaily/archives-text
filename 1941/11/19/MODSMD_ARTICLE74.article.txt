THAT students are living more intensely and
at a faster tempo and that since last spring
undergraduate opinion on the war has veered
sharply toward intervention is the contention
of a writer, class of '42, in the November Yale
Alumni Magazine.
Because we believe it is a pertinent com
mentary on the typical American undergraduate
of November, 1941, we quote excerpts:
"Before the war all of us studying here at
Yale were like a bunch ot molecules floating
placidly about in a jar. The impact of war
has been akin to applying intense heat to that
jar, causing each molecule to vibrate, to zig
zag about at a breakneck pace.
"Students are living more intensely and at
a faster tempo, doing more things, draining
college life to the lees. . . . There is height
ened interest in sports, in outside activities,
in fine music. Many a man is carrying extra
courses because he believes this may be his
last chance to gorge himself on Lux et Veritas.
. . . No one wants to miss out on anything
from Beethoven to the Einstein Theory to
week ends at Vassar.
". . . You have the feeling that students
are more alive, more aware. Apathy and
cynicism, with a few exceptions, are as dead
as pacifism. There is an atmosphere of great
intellectual ferment. Undergraduates are
scrapping old ideas and acquiring new ones.
Men who yesterday were devotees of Afri
can dominoes have felt the electric current of
the v/orld crisis and evolved a thoughtful
new outlook.
". . . by way of conclusion . . . there is no
question, and never has been, of Yale men's
performing whatever service to their country
is asked of them."
