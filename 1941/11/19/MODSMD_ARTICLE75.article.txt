### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
THREE DAYS FOR THANKSGIVING

r it will be Thanksgiving again. When
ever I think of that word or that name, I always
see the same hazy, colorful picture. I always see a
little clearing with trees all, around it and sturdy, neat
log cabins in the background. Everything is always
green and brown. In the middle of the clearing is a
long table with a clean white table cloth spread over it.
The table is covered with turkeys and cranberry sauce
and bread and all kinds of fresh vegetables. Around
the tables are pilgrims, dressed in stiff, starched brown
and white clothes. The men are big and have black
beards on their faces. They are quiet, strong, rugged
men. They are also hungry and are eyeing the tur
keys a little impatiently.

The ladies are all very busy rushing around the
table, running in find out of the cabins, doing last
minute things and whispering orders to their children.
The children look exactly like their parents, only they
are smaller and not as somber. They are very obe
dient children.

COMEWIIERE near the table is the Plymouth Rock,
k strong, silent like the men. And just a little far
ther down, in some blue water, is a boat with May
flower written on it. And running through the whole
picture, running through the whole thing are Indians
with bows and arrows, their faces colored with red
and green paints. This is what I sec when I think
of Thanksgiving. These things and praying. I always
see these people, the rough men, their wives and their
children, and even the Indians, all quietly, sincerely on
their knees, their heads and hands raised in prayer.

But now I think of other things also. I think of
two days without school and a half of Wednesday
thrown in. I think of not having to do the things we
have been doing over and over again since the middle
of September. There will be a three-day break. No
Quad to not smoke on, no professors to listen to, no
notes to take, no binders to carry, no library to go to,
no bells to hear, no mail not to get, no nothing for
three days.

Three days to lay and relax and do nothing, three
days to spend at home. Touch football games and lots
of food and soft beds to sleep on and lots of sleep with
no alarms at seven in the morning. Three days of
rest, or of unrest in a relaxing way. This also do I
think of when I think of Thanksgiving. And I am
very thankful for everything, but right now most
thankful for those three free days, and so I would
like to say "thanks."
