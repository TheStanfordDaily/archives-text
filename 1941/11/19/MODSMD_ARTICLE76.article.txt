WOLF IN SIIEEI'S DISGUISE

r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
Yes, you, Charlie, because I'm assuming you wrote
the editorial concerning Roble's meeting that appeared
in the Daily yesterday morning. I didn't realize when
you called me up to get the "straight goods" on what
had occurred and the reasons for it, that you were
acting one of those "wolf-in-sheep's-disguise" men that
The Daily is constantly sending out in search of some
thing to pan. I wondered why you seemed to delib
erately misunderstand what I said over the phone.
Now I know. For a boy who got the "straight goods"
you sure made something crooked out of it!

The freshman women are plenty indignant, but
they can speak for themselves; frankly, the sponsors
are indignant, too. You spoke of the sponsors in a
tone which led readers to believe they did not ap
prove of it. We do approve of it; in fact, we're proud
of the Roble women. This meeting was one of the
most democratic meetings I have ever heard of at
Stanford. A caucus is not democratic. This was not a
caucus; it was not organized by the few with the ad
mittedly unworthy purpose of pulling a political move
and keeping girls from running who wanted to run.
It was organized by ALL the girls running, many of
whom felt they already had their share, and many of
whom were put up by friends without their knowledge
or desire, and all of whom were sincere in their wish
that the final decisions, no matter what, came from the
group of people who really knew them. To me this
seems as democratic as a New England Town Meeting.

With Roble, then, don't feci the meeting needs justi
fication against charges of being undemocratic. You
still would say, Charlie, that it was an undemocratic
action because a minority attempted to "play around"
with a class office. If they had attempted to dictate
the selection of the MEN, then I agree with you.
But please remember that the "minority" you speak of
happens to be the portion of the Class of '45 lhat
KNOWS the girls. It is a well known fact that the
freshman boys, having no other way to judge, elcct
a pretty face. That being true, they have no kick
coming, bccause there were six pretty faces still left
running!
I agree that it's too bad the lfl girls running didn't
get the idea sooner and push it through sooner. But
I'm glad they DID push it through.
Well, Charlie, what I really think is that you, as a
typical member of the Class of '42, are so hardened to
the "evils" and "machinations" of the Stanford political
system that you arc blind to anything really sincere
and democratic that appears on the horizon. I'll put
my faith in '45; you seem determined to stay blind.

(Yes, you, Sylvia, because I am indebted to you
for supplying the information which made it pos
sible to print the news story on frosh elections
correctly. Without your help it would have been
printed incorrectly. As far as the sponsors go. I
wanted to make sure no one got the impression
the sponsors were guilty of any political dabbling
in frosh afTairs. I said the end (spreading jobs) was
admirable, merely criticizing the time and methods.
If I were a fresh man, I would resent the charge
that they use no other means of discrimination
than "pretty faces." As for my blindness, I have
always opposed caucuses as they arc run at Stan
ford. If you can give inc one good thread to hang
an argument on. I'm for fighting caucuses (as they
are now) until they are eliminated (impossible) or
cleaned up.—The Editor. Yes, me.)

caucus; it was not organized by the few with the ad
mittedly unworthy purpose of pulling a political move
and keeping girls from running who wanted to run.
It was organized by ALL the girls running, many of
whom felt they already had their share, and many of
whom were put up by friends without their knowledge
or desire, and all of whom were sincere in their wish
that the final decisions, no matter what, came from the
group of people who really knew them. To me this
seems as democratic as a New England Town Meeting.

With Roble, then, don't feci the meeting needs justi
fication against charges of being undemocratic. You
still would say, Charlie, that it was an undemocratic
action because a minority attempted to "play around"
with a class office. If they had attempted to dictate
the selection of the MEN, then I agree with you.
But please remember that the "minority" you speak of
happens to be the portion of the Class of '45 lhat
KNOWS the girls. It is a well known fact that the
freshman boys, having no other way to judge, elcct
a pretty face. That being true, they have no kick
coming, bccause there were six pretty faces still left
running!
I agree that it's too bad the lfl girls running didn't
get the idea sooner and push it through sooner. But
I'm glad they DID push it through.
Well, Charlie, what I really think is that you, as a
typical member of the Class of '42, are so hardened to
the "evils" and "machinations" of the Stanford political
system that you arc blind to anything really sincere
and democratic that appears on the horizon. I'll put
my faith in '45; you seem determined to stay blind.

r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
Yes, you, Charlie, because I'm assuming you wrote
the editorial concerning Roble's meeting that appeared
in the Daily yesterday morning. I didn't realize when
you called me up to get the "straight goods" on what
had occurred and the reasons for it, that you were
acting one of those "wolf-in-sheep's-disguise" men that
The Daily is constantly sending out in search of some
thing to pan. I wondered why you seemed to delib
erately misunderstand what I said over the phone.
Now I know. For a boy who got the "straight goods"
you sure made something crooked out of it!

The freshman women are plenty indignant, but
they can speak for themselves; frankly, the sponsors
are indignant, too. You spoke of the sponsors in a
tone which led readers to believe they did not ap
prove of it. We do approve of it; in fact, we're proud
of the Roble women. This meeting was one of the
most democratic meetings I have ever heard of at

a pretty face. That being true, they have no kick
coming, bccause there were six pretty faces still left
running!
I agree that it's too bad the lfl girls running didn't
get the idea sooner and push it through sooner. But
I'm glad they DID push it through.
Well, Charlie, what I really think is that you, as a
typical member of the Class of '42, are so hardened to
the "evils" and "machinations" of the Stanford political
system that you arc blind to anything really sincere
and democratic that appears on the horizon. I'll put
my faith in '45; you seem determined to stay blind.
Sylvia Berry,
President of Roble

(Dear Itohlc President

(Yes, you, Sylvia, because I am indebted to you
for supplying the information which made it pos
sible to print the news story on frosh elections
correctly. Without your help it would have been
printed incorrectly. As far as the sponsors go. I
wanted to make sure no one got the impression
the sponsors were guilty of any political dabbling
in frosh afTairs. I said the end (spreading jobs) was
admirable, merely criticizing the time and methods.
If I were a fresh man, I would resent the charge
that they use no other means of discrimination
than "pretty faces." As for my blindness, I have
always opposed caucuses as they arc run at Stan
ford. If you can give inc one good thread to hang
an argument on. I'm for fighting caucuses (as they
are now) until they are eliminated (impossible) or
cleaned up.—The Editor. Yes, me.)

WOLF IN SIIEEI'S DISGUISE

r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
Yes, you, Charlie, because I'm assuming you wrote
the editorial concerning Roble's meeting that appeared
in the Daily yesterday morning. I didn't realize when
you called me up to get the "straight goods" on what
had occurred and the reasons for it, that you were
acting one of those "wolf-in-sheep's-disguise" men that
The Daily is constantly sending out in search of some
thing to pan. I wondered why you seemed to delib
erately misunderstand what I said over the phone.
Now I know. For a boy who got the "straight goods"
you sure made something crooked out of it!

The freshman women are plenty indignant, but
they can speak for themselves; frankly, the sponsors
are indignant, too. You spoke of the sponsors in a
tone which led readers to believe they did not ap
prove of it. We do approve of it; in fact, we're proud
of the Roble women. This meeting was one of the
most democratic meetings I have ever heard of at
Stanford. A caucus is not democratic. This was not a
caucus; it was not organized by the few with the ad
mittedly unworthy purpose of pulling a political move
and keeping girls from running who wanted to run.
It was organized by ALL the girls running, many of
whom felt they already had their share, and many of
whom were put up by friends without their knowledge
or desire, and all of whom were sincere in their wish
that the final decisions, no matter what, came from the
group of people who really knew them. To me this
seems as democratic as a New England Town Meeting.

With Roble, then, don't feci the meeting needs justi
fication against charges of being undemocratic. You
still would say, Charlie, that it was an undemocratic
action because a minority attempted to "play around"
with a class office. If they had attempted to dictate
the selection of the MEN, then I agree with you.
But please remember that the "minority" you speak of
happens to be the portion of the Class of '45 lhat
KNOWS the girls. It is a well known fact that the
freshman boys, having no other way to judge, elcct
a pretty face. That being true, they have no kick
coming, bccause there were six pretty faces still left
