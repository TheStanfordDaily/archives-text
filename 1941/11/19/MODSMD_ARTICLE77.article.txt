# Clinton Olson, Stanford Man, Meets Stalin at Kremlin Party
## 
### WALLACE CARROLL 
MANILA, I*.l. (Unccnsored), Nov. IK (Cl®). —The night Premier Josef V.
Stalin, the leader of godless Russia, invoked God's blessing on President
Roosevelt was a night such as the Kremlin never had seen before and may
never see again.
A hundred American and British delegates had gathered at the old

fortress with their Soviet
to celebrate the successful conclu
sion of a conference at which they
hud worked out a long-term pro
gram for the delivery of war sup
plies to the Soviets.
They had heard of Stalin as a man
of steel, the ogre of the Kremlin, a
ruthless dictator. For seven and a
half hours they saw another side of
Stalin—Stalin the human being, or
as one American put it, "a nice old
gentleman with a very kind face."
ATTH ALL THE TRIMMINGS
Great crystal chandeliers were
blazing and the crimson-gold ban
queting hall was filled with gener
als, admirals and lesser officers in
uniforms weighed down with medals
and medal ribbons.
Then, in walked Stalin in that
semi-military costume he has worn
ever since he was a political com
missar in the revolutionary army 23
years ago—grey tunic and grey
trousers tucked into the kind of
boots a Red Army private wears.
lIE SAW A STANFORD MAN
Ho didn't seem very much inter
ested in the generals and admirals, j
He just strolled around until he saw
a fade which interested him, then 1
stopped and talked.
In this way he came upon Lieut, j
Clinton L. Olson, 25-ycar-old United
States Army officer of Stanford Uni
versity, who still is with the supply
mission in Kuibyshev.
MARSHAL OLSON'
Stalin looked at a star on the j
sleeve of Olson's uniform, a twinkle |
came into his eye and he remarked:
"You look very young to be a J
marshal. In the Red Army," you
know, a star like that stands for a
marshal."
Olson, who has not been out of
Stanford University for many years, i
replied that the star was a regi- !
mental insignia.
Stalin took his place at the head |
of the table and the banquet and
toasts began. There were 31 toasts
—some delegates said 37 and this j
confusion was understandable be- !
cause the Russians drink their toasts
to the bottom of the glass.
