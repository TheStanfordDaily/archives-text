its more luxurious forms, betake
yourself to the Cow Palace in South
San Francisco, where you will find
a magnificent horse show with all
the trimmings, and various members
of the bovine family, all guaranteed
contented.
WHITEMAN AT PALACE
As for the more frivolous side of
life, there is always Paul White

are, of course, the various night
clubs about town. In the Interna
tional Settlement you will find Gay
Nineties, which features a so-called
Barbary Coast atmosphere and a lot
of rowdy entertainment.
At the Bal Tabarin is Bill Clif

Hclene Hughes dancers. Chinatown

Skvroom, et al. If you go for Span
