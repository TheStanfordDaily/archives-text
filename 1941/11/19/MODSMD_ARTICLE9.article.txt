# Excom Votes Censorship Of Floats
## 
### 
Whether the Big Game parade,
top-flight fun fest and cherished
tradition of Big Game week activi
ties, will be scratched off the calen
dar in the future is to be determined
by the moral tone of this year's
floats, it was agreed by Executive
Committee last night.
Reflecting, ruefully, upon the ad
mittedly questionable presentation of
last* year, Cardinals Chairman Jess
Hazlctt told Excom that Stanford
must "guard against the obscenity of
floats so the public doesn't go away
with a bad taste in its mouth."
Censorship prior to presentation
will be imposed this year by a com
mittee of three persons composed of
representatives from Cardinals, Axe
Society and Ex Committee, who
will point a moral finger at float
chairmen before entries move to the
starting line.
Hazlett and Mickey Levee, Rally
Committee chairman, explained it is
hoped the event will become more
of a pageant than a parade and an
nounced the theme for this year is,
"The first 50 years of the Big Game."
Float chairmen from each campus
group will meet with the checking
committee Monday, and Levee ex
plained last night that each house
will be held responsible for its float.
Big Game week chairmen are
Chuck Smith, Big Game bonfire;
Shelly Parker, post-Gaieties jolly
up; Doris "Dodie" Dollan, food sup
ply corps for frosh men working on
the bonfire; and Hays Busch, Big
Game dance. Other business follows:
DANCE RULE: New ruling per
mitting Saturday night on-campu';
dances to last until 1 a.m., instead
of the previous 12 midnight closing
hour, has been approved by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur, it was re
ported.
FROSH ELECTION: Results were
approved.
RED CROSS: This year's recently
completed drive amassed $1,465,
smashing all previous records, it
was stated.
BOOKSTORE PROFITS: Jim Mc-
Kellar, student manager, reported
Bookstore profits this year provided
$5,000 for scholarships. Ruling for
disbursement of these funds was
changed from the requirement that
they be entirely allotted during the
year 1941-42, to read that, they may
be held over in part until 1943 to
maintain a balance in appropriations
by the University Scholarship Com
mittee. Application of these funds
under the new rule is up to the dis
cretion of the committee. A complete
financial statement of the Book

with a bad taste in its mouth."
Censorship prior to presentation

mittee of three persons composed of
representatives from Cardinals, Axe
Society and Ex Committee, who
will point a moral finger at float
chairmen before entries move to the
starting line.
Hazlett and Mickey Levee, Rally

hoped the event will become more
of a pageant than a parade and an
nounced the theme for this year is,
"The first 50 years of the Big Game."
Float chairmen from each campus
group will meet with the checking
committee Monday, and Levee ex
plained last night that each house

EUREKA, Nov. 18 (UP).—The Eu
reka Navy Section Base, northern
most base of the Twelfth Naval Dis
trict patrol force, was commissioned
today and placed under command of
Lieutenant Commander Harry W.
Shawk.
Whether the Big Game parade,
top-flight fun fest and cherished
tradition of Big Game week activi
ties, will be scratched off the calen
dar in the future is to be determined
by the moral tone of this year's
floats, it was agreed by Executive
Committee last night.
Reflecting, ruefully, upon the ad
mittedly questionable presentation of
last* year, Cardinals Chairman Jess
Hazlctt told Excom that Stanford
must "guard against the obscenity of
floats so the public doesn't go away
with a bad taste in its mouth."
Censorship prior to presentation
will be imposed this year by a com
mittee of three persons composed of
representatives from Cardinals, Axe
Society and Ex Committee, who
will point a moral finger at float
chairmen before entries move to the
starting line.
Hazlett and Mickey Levee, Rally
Committee chairman, explained it is
hoped the event will become more
of a pageant than a parade and an
nounced the theme for this year is,
"The first 50 years of the Big Game."
Float chairmen from each campus
group will meet with the checking
committee Monday, and Levee ex
plained last night that each house
will be held responsible for its float.
Big Game week chairmen are
Chuck Smith, Big Game bonfire;
Shelly Parker, post-Gaieties jolly
up; Doris "Dodie" Dollan, food sup
ply corps for frosh men working on
the bonfire; and Hays Busch, Big
Game dance. Other business follows:
