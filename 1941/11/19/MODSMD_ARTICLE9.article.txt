# Excom Votes Censorship Of Floats
## 
### 
Whether the Big Game parade,
top-flight fun fest and cherished
tradition of Big Game week activi
ties, will be scratched off the calen
dar in the future is to be determined
by the moral tone of this year's
floats, it was agreed by Executive
Committee last night.
Reflecting, ruefully, upon the ad
mittedly questionable presentation of
last* year, Cardinals Chairman Jess
Hazlctt told Excom that Stanford
must "guard against the obscenity of
floats so the public doesn't go away
with a bad taste in its mouth."

will be imposed this year by a com
mittee of three persons composed of
representatives from Cardinals, Axe
Society and Ex Committee, who
will point a moral finger at float

starting line.
Hazlett and Mickey Levee, Rally
Committee chairman, explained it is
hoped the event will become more
of a pageant than a parade and an

"The first 50 years of the Big Game."
Float chairmen from each campus
group will meet with the checking
committee Monday, and Levee ex
plained last night that each house
will be held responsible for its float.
Big Game week chairmen are
Chuck Smith, Big Game bonfire;
Shelly Parker, post-Gaieties jolly
up; Doris "Dodie" Dollan, food sup
ply corps for frosh men working on
the bonfire; and Hays Busch, Big
Game dance. Other business follows:
