### AMIE REICHERT 
W/HILE everyone was busy giving
thanks, Great Britain pulled a
blitz and sent one, two, three, four,
five, then six spearheads crashing
across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
The second front was at long last
opened—and successfully.
Mediterranean units of the Royal
Navy, and planes of the li.A.F.
pounded the Axis-held coast,
thereby cutting off retreat from
the north. Meanwhile British tank
divisions struck from the south
and converged in a drive at To
bruk where for seven months a
British fighting force has been he
sieged.
Thus far the result of this light
ning movement has been to flank
and encircle much of the German
fortified line, and release the de
fenders of Tobruk who, it is re
ported, have joined the assault and
already captured 1,000 Axis soldiers.

'T'HE British have waited for five
months to open an offensive. But
in that time they have been laying
the groundwork for the Libyan at
tack.
The British navy has continually
harrassed Italian convoys in the
Mediterranean which carry supplies
to Libya and thence to Axis forces
in the Western Desert. The sinkings
have increased considerably in the
past few months, and the British
claim that they have sunk 108 ships
since August—damaging or destroy
ing half the ships in convoy service.
Last week these sinkings hit a new
high.
United Press' Syrian corre
spondent reports that for the past
five months strong reinforce
ments have been pouring into
Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon,
dwarfing the troops and equipment
which General Wilson had at his
disposal in driving the Vichy
French out of Syria.
There has been a steady flow of
tanks of all sizes, Bren gun car
riers, armored cars, anti-aircraft
guns, artillery, and munitions, all
moving northward.
This factor, coupled with the
strategy the British are employing,
helps to explain the swiftness of their
initial advance.

r J\HE British scattered their troops
and camouflaged their tanks so
successfully, and moved them only
in small lots and at night, so that
Nnzi General Rommel was caught
napping. He mistook the general
advance for a run-of-the-mill bor
der flurry.
Apparently the Germans have
caught their breath now. It was re
ported last night that they were fe
verishly rushing reinforcements by
transport airplanes from Tripoli,
Crete, and Italy.
Co-incidental with the British
thrust last week came news from
Vichyfrancc that General Maximc
Wcygand, commander of the
French North African forces, was
given his walking papers by Pe
tain, who at the same time, made
an engagement for a tete-a-tete *
with Dcr Fuehrer.
Wcygand was probably asked to
resign because, although he is no
Anglophile, he believes in strict ad
herence to the terms of the French -
Nazi armistice, which did not call
for German infiltration and control
of the French Empire.
But with the new offensive in
Libya putting considerable pressure
on the Axis, the Nazis will be need
ing air bases, routes of supply, and
reinforcements to withstand the
drive. French Northwest Africa is
the answer to this one, and Der
Fuehrer means to have it.

Recent reports from Ankara
seem to indicate that Turkey is
now moving closer to an alliance
with (ireat Britain. Dispatches
last week told of German pressure
in Turkey. The Nazis are said to
have offered Turkey peace in ex
change for "certain transit facili
ties" for an attack on Britain's
Middle East domain.
If that is the case, the chances are
that Turkey will at last give the
British the come-on signal. Hitler
will do what British dollars and
diplomacy have been unable to do—
that is, put the Turks on the Allied
.side of the fence.

months to open an offensive. But
in that time they have been laying
the groundwork for the Libyan at

The British navy has continually
harrassed Italian convoys in the
Mediterranean which carry supplies
to Libya and thence to Axis forces
in the Western Desert. The sinkings
have increased considerably in the
past few months, and the British
claim that they have sunk 108 ships
since August—damaging or destroy
ing half the ships in convoy service.
Last week these sinkings hit a new
high.
United Press' Syrian corre
spondent reports that for the past
five months strong reinforce
ments have been pouring into
Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon,
dwarfing the troops and equipment
which General Wilson had at his
disposal in driving the Vichy
French out of Syria.
There has been a steady flow of
tanks of all sizes, Bren gun car
riers, armored cars, anti-aircraft
guns, artillery, and munitions, all
moving northward.
This factor, coupled with the
strategy the British are employing,
helps to explain the swiftness of their
initial advance.

r J\HE British scattered their troops
and camouflaged their tanks so
successfully, and moved them only
in small lots and at night, so that
Nnzi General Rommel was caught
napping. He mistook the general
advance for a run-of-the-mill bor
der flurry.
Apparently the Germans have
caught their breath now. It was re
ported last night that they were fe
verishly rushing reinforcements by
transport airplanes from Tripoli,
Crete, and Italy.
Co-incidental with the British

Vichyfrancc that General Maximc
Wcygand, commander of the
French North African forces, was
given his walking papers by Pe
tain, who at the same time, made
an engagement for a tete-a-tete *
with Dcr Fuehrer.
Wcygand was probably asked to
resign because, although he is no
Anglophile, he believes in strict ad
herence to the terms of the French -
Nazi armistice, which did not call
for German infiltration and control
of the French Empire.
But with the new offensive in
Libya putting considerable pressure
on the Axis, the Nazis will be need
ing air bases, routes of supply, and
reinforcements to withstand the
drive. French Northwest Africa is
the answer to this one, and Der

Recent reports from Ankara
seem to indicate that Turkey is
now moving closer to an alliance

have offered Turkey peace in ex

ties" for an attack on Britain's
Middle East domain.
If that is the case, the chances are
that Turkey will at last give the
British the come-on signal. Hitler
will do what British dollars and
diplomacy have been unable to do—
that is, put the Turks on the Allied

riers, armored cars, anti-aircraft
guns, artillery, and munitions, all
moving northward.
This factor, coupled with the
strategy the British are employing,
helps to explain the swiftness of their
initial advance.

r J\HE British scattered their troops
and camouflaged their tanks so
successfully, and moved them only
in small lots and at night, so that
Nnzi General Rommel was caught
napping. He mistook the general
advance for a run-of-the-mill bor
der flurry.
Apparently the Germans have
caught their breath now. It was re
ported last night that they were fe
verishly rushing reinforcements by
transport airplanes from Tripoli,
Crete, and Italy.
Co-incidental with the British
thrust last week came news from
Vichyfrancc that General Maximc
Wcygand, commander of the
French North African forces, was
given his walking papers by Pe
tain, who at the same time, made
an engagement for a tete-a-tete *
with Dcr Fuehrer.
Wcygand was probably asked to
resign because, although he is no
Anglophile, he believes in strict ad
herence to the terms of the French -
Nazi armistice, which did not call
for German infiltration and control
of the French Empire.
But with the new offensive in
Libya putting considerable pressure
on the Axis, the Nazis will be need
ing air bases, routes of supply, and
reinforcements to withstand the
drive. French Northwest Africa is
the answer to this one, and Der
Fuehrer means to have it.

Recent reports from Ankara
seem to indicate that Turkey is
now moving closer to an alliance
with (ireat Britain. Dispatches
last week told of German pressure
in Turkey. The Nazis are said to
have offered Turkey peace in ex
change for "certain transit facili
ties" for an attack on Britain's
Middle East domain.
If that is the case, the chances are
that Turkey will at last give the
British the come-on signal. Hitler
will do what British dollars and
diplomacy have been unable to do—
that is, put the Turks on the Allied
.side of the fence.
W/HILE everyone was busy giving
thanks, Great Britain pulled a
blitz and sent one, two, three, four,
five, then six spearheads crashing
across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
The second front was at long last
opened—and successfully.
Mediterranean units of the Royal
Navy, and planes of the li.A.F.
pounded the Axis-held coast,
thereby cutting off retreat from
the north. Meanwhile British tank
divisions struck from the south
and converged in a drive at To
bruk where for seven months a
British fighting force has been he
sieged.
Thus far the result of this light
ning movement has been to flank
and encircle much of the German
fortified line, and release the de
fenders of Tobruk who, it is re
ported, have joined the assault and
already captured 1,000 Axis soldiers.

'T'HE British have waited for five
months to open an offensive. But
in that time they have been laying
the groundwork for the Libyan at
tack.
The British navy has continually
harrassed Italian convoys in the
Mediterranean which carry supplies
to Libya and thence to Axis forces
in the Western Desert. The sinkings
have increased considerably in the
past few months, and the British
claim that they have sunk 108 ships
since August—damaging or destroy
ing half the ships in convoy service.
Last week these sinkings hit a new
high.
United Press' Syrian corre
spondent reports that for the past
five months strong reinforce
ments have been pouring into
Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon,
dwarfing the troops and equipment
which General Wilson had at his
disposal in driving the Vichy
French out of Syria.
