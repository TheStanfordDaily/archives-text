LONDON, Nov. 23 (UP). — W.
Averell Harriman, United States
lend-lease representative in Britain,
said tonight that the U. S. Navy now
is "shooting Germans—German sub
marines and aircraft at sea."
This "shooting," he said in a
broadcast, still was designed to "keep
the United States out of the war."
