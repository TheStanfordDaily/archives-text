# Jackson Will Warn Frosh On Raiding
## 
### 
Frosh men will gather in the En
cina lobby at 7 o'clock this evening
to discuss Ihe problems which an
nually arise during Big Game week.
Student Body President George
Jackson and the chairmen of Men's
Council, Stan Owen, will be the main
speakers on the program arranged
for the smoker, said Ralph Thomp
son, head sponsor of Encina.
The chief problem under discus
sion will be the question of inter
campus raids during Big Game
week. The student body presidents
of Stanford and the University of
California, representing their re
spective student bodies, have in the
last several years made agreements
that no raids either upon the Farm
or upon the Berkeley campus would
be made and have both agreed tliat
students from either school caught
raiding will be expelled from their
respective universites. This will be
clarified at the smoker this evening.
Other Big Game problems will also
be discussed and any questions that
the freshmen may have about the
week and their part in it will be an
swered. Jackson and Owen will also
briefly review the week's complete
schedule.
The smoker will last from 7 to 8
o'clock tonight. Further information
concerning the get-together may be
gotten from frosh sponsors.
