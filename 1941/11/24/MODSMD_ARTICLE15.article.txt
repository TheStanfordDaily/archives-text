ONE CHECK FOR BLOCKS

those who buy big blocks of tickets
for living groups collect all money
or checks for these ducats and try to
pay in either one large check or all
cash.
Meanwhile, at the theater, Asher
Wilson and his crew are working
like dynamos to get the production
into shape for the show's Friday
afternoon bow. Practices were held
straight through Thanksgiving va
cation, and by Saturday afternoon
Director Wilson observed that
"things seem to be going pretty
well," though he quickly hastened to
add. "but we still need plenty of
work.. .there's a lot of polishing to
be done yet."
RUMORS BUZZING
Several observers who have man
aged to sneak by the guards watch
ing the entrances to the theater in
which all the Gaieties secret re
hearsals have been held, sent ru
mors buzzing around campus yester
day that the 1941 Gaieties are going
to be nothing less than terrific.
Tabbed for special mention were
Jeanne Smith, the Theta quarter,
Dick Swan, and the Four Jacks and
Queen. And then, of course, there are
such old and honored stand-bys as
Joe Young, Norm Ross, and "Beej"
Miller who, according to our ob
servers, will put on performances
Friday that will probably leave you
and you and you gasping with laugh
ter in the aisles and sobbing, "Mene,
mene..."
