# Detectives Check 'Saboteur's' Story
## 
### 
ELKO, Nov., Nov. 23 (UP). â€”In
strict secrecy, railroad detectives to
day took Clarence Alexander, 24,
over the scene of the wreck of the
train "City of San Francisco" to
doublecheck Alexander's "confes
sion" that he sabotaged the stream
liner Aug. 12, 1939, killing 24 per
sons.
Frankly doubting some of the
phases of Alexander's detailed "con
fession," Sheriff Johnson and O'Con
nell wanted Alexander to re-enact
his version of the sabotaging of the
S.P. flier.
