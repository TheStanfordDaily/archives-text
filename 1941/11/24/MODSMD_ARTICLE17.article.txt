# Coke-Daters Jive in Union This Afternoon
## 
### 
Mixing Poli Sei, Western Civ,
books in general, a few cokes, and
an urge to dance off the famed Mon
day-after-any-Sunday dumps, Stan
fordites celebrate the opening of
"Cellar Heaven," the Farm's new
dance spot, in the Union Cellar this
afternoon and this evening.
Featuring the juke-box jive of
Goodman, Dorsey, Martin, Ink Spots,
etc., the new policy of dancing in
the Cellar is designed to relieve the
anguish of floor-lacking coke-date
dancers. Previous to the new set-up,
some 4,000 Stanford social lights
usually haven't done any campus
dancing for less than some $2. Those
who tried to dance among the tables
of the Union on between-class
dates have discovered that under
I normal conditions tables cannot be
danced through, on, or under. So,
instead of removing the dancers,
removable tables have been installed
by the Stanford Union manage
ment, and Miss Christine Ricker,
Union director, has set 2 to 5 in the
afternoon and 7:30 to 10:30 in the
evening as dance hours.
Thus, for the $2 that an on-cam-
I pus dance date normally requires,
any hoofer can collect his opponent
and participate in some 40 struggles,
plus small talk and carbonated
water.
