BIG GAME APPROACHES
As the number of days of calm be
fore the storm of Big Game week
end events diminishes, campus com
mitteemen are busy completing plans
for the four-day program which
will include the parade, rally, bon
fire, Gaieties, jolly-up, game, and
dance. Members of Cardinals are
directing the various activities.
Festivities will open Thursday
evening at 7:15 with the parade down
the Row of nearly 50 floats depict
ing half a century of Big Games.
Representing the somewhat censored
ingenuity of the student body, they
will vie for the prizes offered by
Palo Alto merchants.
RAISE THE ROOF
Following the parade, everyone
will trek to the Pavilion to raise the
roof with a roaring rally, topped off
by a rendition of the Axe Yell as
only a Big Game rally can inspire it.
Further entertainment will be pro
vided by Alan Hale, well known
movie star, and Bill Leiser, Chron
icle sports editor. These activities
will be aided and abetted by the
yell leaders and the band.
Lagunita lakebed and the bonfire
will be the next stop for Stanford
supporters Thursday night. The re
sult of a long day's labor by the men
of the Class of '45, fed and inspired
by their female classmates, the bon
fire will roast the Berkeley bear in
effigy while thousands cheer and
fireworks explode.
GAIETIES
Friday will be Gaieties day as two
performances of Ash Wilson's colos
sal student production take the spot
light. The afternoon performance,
which opens at 2:30 p.m., will be
followed by a jolly-up in the Wom
en's Gym from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.
Curtain time is 8:30 for the evening
performance.
Along with some ninety thousand
other spectators. Stanfordifes will
devote Saturday afternoon to watch
ing the T formation give California
the axe and thereby keep the axe on
the Farm for another year. Alumni
will gather before and after the
game at open houses held by most
campus living groups.
BIG GAME DANCING
After the rooters have sung the
last song to a dejected California
section, many will travel to the San
Francisco Country Club for the offi
cial Big Game dance. There, from
10 until 2, they will dance to the
music of Gene Englander and Lu
Watters.
Big Game week-end will come to
an inevitable close for many stu
dent celebrants Sunday morning at
3:30 a.m., for that is the deadline of
the special late leave granted to
women by Women's Council. And
there won't be another until next
November, for Big Game week-end,
like Christmas, comes but once a
year.
