# British Tighten Pincer Around Trapped Axis Legions in Libyan War
## English Claim 15,000 Captured, Cruisers Sunk 
### 
CAIRO, IVIon., Nov. 24 (IP). —
British troops battling south from
Tobruk, besieged for seven months,
have smashed to within four miles
of imperial forces striking up from
the southeast in the all-out effort to
close a trap of annihilation on Axis
men and machines in northeastern
Libya, front dispatches said today.
In co-ordination land and sea bat
tles designed to annihilate Axis
forces in Africa and perhaps drive
Italy out of the war, have driven the
enemy tank army into four pockets
of extermination and sunk or dam
aged seven more Axis ship*, it was
announced today.
Two of the Axis ship 3 were Italian
cruisers, at least one of which was
sunk, it was said.
BRITISH CLAIM
The number of Axis prisoners
rounded up in the 500-square mile
"Battle of Libya" zone was esti
mated at 15,000, including 8,000 Ital
ians captured by imperial Indian
troops at Sidi Omar. The Indians
captured Sidi Omar but met fierce
resistance from Germans at Libyan
Omar, four and a half miles west.

In a desperate move to avert dis
aster, the German and Italian air
forces were rushing in reinforce
ments from Tripoli, Crete end the
Italian mainland.
THE AIR YVAK
Giant German Junkers-52 trans
port planes, heavily laden with
ground reinforcements, and Ger
many's newest, fastest Messer
schmitt-109F fighting planes were re
ported roaring in from the Mediter
ranean, along with Italian bombers
and fighters, in the face of British
domination of the skies. The tempo
of air fighting had reached a new
high pitch on a 140-mile stretch of
the Egyptian-Libyan frontier, with
us many as 50 planes participating
in a single dog-fight.
A military spokesman said the
great tank battle might culminate
today.

CAIRO, IVIon., Nov. 24 (IP). —
British troops battling south from
Tobruk, besieged for seven months,
have smashed to within four miles
of imperial forces striking up from
the southeast in the all-out effort to
close a trap of annihilation on Axis
men and machines in northeastern
Libya, front dispatches said today.
In co-ordination land and sea bat
tles designed to annihilate Axis
forces in Africa and perhaps drive
Italy out of the war, have driven the
enemy tank army into four pockets
of extermination and sunk or dam
aged seven more Axis ship*, it was
announced today.
Two of the Axis ship 3 were Italian
cruisers, at least one of which was
sunk, it was said.
BRITISH CLAIM
The number of Axis prisoners
rounded up in the 500-square mile
"Battle of Libya" zone was esti
mated at 15,000, including 8,000 Ital
ians captured by imperial Indian
troops at Sidi Omar. The Indians
captured Sidi Omar but met fierce
resistance from Germans at Libyan
Omar, four and a half miles west.

In a desperate move to avert dis
aster, the German and Italian air
forces were rushing in reinforce
ments from Tripoli, Crete end the
Italian mainland.
THE AIR YVAK
Giant German Junkers-52 trans
port planes, heavily laden with
ground reinforcements, and Ger
many's newest, fastest Messer
schmitt-109F fighting planes were re
ported roaring in from the Mediter
ranean, along with Italian bombers
and fighters, in the face of British
domination of the skies. The tempo
of air fighting had reached a new
high pitch on a 140-mile stretch of
the Egyptian-Libyan frontier, with
us many as 50 planes participating
in a single dog-fight.
A military spokesman said the
great tank battle might culminate
today.
