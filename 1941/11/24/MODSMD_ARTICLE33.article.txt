# Coach Predicts O.S.C. Victory
## 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy, intro
duced on the Second Guessers
broadcast yesterday as unbeaten and
untied over the week-end, was nev
ertheless considerably worried about
jthe coming Big Game.
"We could all use about 70 hours
jof practice for every conference
I game," he lamented, "and we have
only seven. We need scrimmage
badly this week. But we don't dare
J scrimmage; because we picked up a
j couple more injuries last week, and
don't want any more."
HOW IS PETE?
"How is Pete Kmctovic?" asked
Bill Leiser.
"Honestly, I won't know till Mon
day." replied Shaughnessy. "We
| hope to find out then."
"I'll bet you ten bucks Kmctovic
: plays at his best Saturday."
"I'll take that bet right now," said
the coach, "and I hope I lose."
Centering attention on the Rose
I Bowl race, Leiser figured that if both
j Oregon State and Stanford lose Sat
urday, there will be five teams tied
for the conference championship,
j "Who goes to the Rose Bowl then?"
: he asked.
TWO BOWLS
"Why then we would still have
two bowl games without a bowl,"
Shaughnessy answered, referring to
the coming W.S.C.-Texas A. & M.
j and Oregon-Texas games.
"Last year," Leiser commented,
"Stanford won nine games and lost
none, and yet one representative
voted for Washington, and it wasn't
a Washington representative either."
"What I want to know is, what
j shape did the Oregon boys come
j through in?"
OREGON BRUISEI)
To which Leiser replied by quot
| ing Bruce Hamby, Oregon press
j agent, saying, "The team is badly
bruised, and cannot possibly be in
; top condition for Oregon State. And
; that is the straight goods."
"Then I rather suspect Oregon
State will beat Oregon Saturday,"
said the coach.

Lester Cummins, former high
school tackle, tackled a wolf and
drowned it after dogs had cornered
it.
