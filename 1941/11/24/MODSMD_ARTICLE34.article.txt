# Tuesday Series Will Present Color Movie, 'Five Miles High'
## 
### 
Tuesday Evening Series will feature ''Five Miles High," colored motion
pictures taken on the second highest mountain in the world by Paul K.
Petzoldt, tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in tin- auditorium of Memorial Theater.
These pictures were taken at 20.000 feet above sea level, the highest
point on the earth's surface ever reached by a camera. They show the gla-

,cier-covered ranges of K2 in the
Himalayas and were taken on the
American Karakoram Expedition,
which broke all previous records in
climbing this peak. Mr. Petzoldt
will tell the experiences of his party
of five during the trip as he shows
the film.
NATIVE OF IDAHO
Mr. Petzoldt, born of Swiss par
entage on a ranch near the Snake
River Canyon in Idaho, began
climbing before he was in his teens.
At 15 he led an ascent of Grand
Teton in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
In 1934 while in Switzerland, he
led a searching party for six Ital
ians, who were lost in a storm on
the Matterhorn. During this trip he
made a double traverse of the
Matterhorn in 14 hours; two years
later he led a winter ascent of the
Grand Teton in a temperature that
ranged as low as 40 degrees below
zero.
SELECTION NO SURPRISE
He has climbed Popocatepetl in
Mexico and some of the highest
ranges in the South American sier
ras; thus his selection by the Ameri
can Alpine Club as a member of the
first American Karakoran Expedi
tion of 1938 was no surprise.
