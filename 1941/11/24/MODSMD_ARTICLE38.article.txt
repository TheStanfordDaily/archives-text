# TEAM LAUNCHES BIG GAME WORK
## 
### 
n's Big Game time again. No
one realized this more than the
Farm's football team as it took its
last day of rest yesterday before
the final week of hard work pre
paratory to meeting the Berkeley
Bears in the local stadium next
Saturday.
Saturday the team had a full
day of football with a picture
session in the morning and their
regular workout in the afternoon.
Forty of the squad members,
decked in their flashy red and
white game uniforms, posed for
the press for over an hour in the
morning, while Coach Shaugh
nessy alternated the first three
strings in offensive and defensive
work in the afternoon.
TWO QUARTERBACKS
Frankie Albert and Al Cole
quarterbacked the offensive ma
neuvers under Shaughnessy's all -
seeing eye, while Assistant Coach
es Lawson, Schwartz, Bengtson,
and Hunt directed the "blacks'"
running of California plays. Out
standing for the "blacks" was
Frosh Coach Harry Shipkey, who
filled in at end for a while. Al
though it was at tackle that Ship
key made his name 15 years ago,
he looked pretty lively in going
down the field after passes.
The news of Oregon's great
showing in defeating Washington

bolstered the team's hopes of go
ing to the Rose Bowl next Janu
ary. Even though the Cards do
win over the Bears, a fact that

Shaughnessy concede, Ore
gon must trim their traditional
rivals, the Oregon State Beavers,
in ordel- to give the Indians their
second straight trip to Pasadena.
The team returned to work

Thursday, after taking a four-day
rest following their defeat at the
hands of Washington State. Even
in the absence of Pete Kmetovic,
they had more spirit than at any
workout since the early part of
the season, a spirit which they
have kept in their succeeding
drills.
Although Kmet didn't suit up
for either Thursday's or Friday's
workouts, he did show up in his
game uniform for the press pho
tographers with the rest of the
team Saturday morning, and again
in the afternoon for the regular
practice, this time, however, in
sweat clothes.
PETE MAY NOT IM AV
His appearance, however, does
not insure that he will play against
the Golden Bear, since Neither
Shaughnessy nor Team Physician
Dr. Fritz Roth will make a posi
tive statement concerning the leg
injury which took him out of the
Cougar game.
The only other men on the squad
not ready to go at full speed in
today's practice are Ken Robesky,
who is still attending his sick
father in Southern California, and
Ray Hammett, who is still favor
ing an ankle, injured in early sea
son.
The California team that lined
up for practice at Berkeley Satur

day was far from the Pose Bowl
bound outfit that started the sea
son with a five-touchdown win
over St. Mary's over two months
a SÂ°-
Coach Stub Allison will prob
ably open with Leidholt and Fer
guson at ends, Bob Reinhard and
Stan Cox at tackles, Stu Cox and
Witter at guards, Christiansen at
center, and a backfield of Merlo,
Derian, Graves, and McQuary.
This team worked in scrimmage
against the second team, after the
latter had defeated the third string,
G to 3, in a short workout. Dis
heartening to Stanford rooters was
the manner that A1 Derian ran
and passed after being out for
several weeks,
LAST BIG GAME
For Albert, Kmetovic, Bob
Crane, Vic Lindskog, Arnie Mei
ners, Freddie Meyer, Robesky,
Doug Stable, Ray Durham, and
Bob Mastin, this v/ill be the last
Big Game, the last home game,
and probably the last game any
where for Stanford.
During their time Stanford has
won one and lost one to the
villains from across the Bay, so
this is the game that they need
to establish their superiority, a
superiority that was sorely tried
in 1939, and even challenged in
1940.
