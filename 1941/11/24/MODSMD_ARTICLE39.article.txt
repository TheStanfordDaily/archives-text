# Polo Squad Prepares For Utah Riders
## 
### 
Utah University's hard-riding polo
team is the next on the list for Coach
Robert Ranzoni's Stanford varsity in
games to be played on Wednesday
and Friday here.
The Farm polo team gained plenty
of experience but few wins on their
recent sweep through the southern
United States. The locals dropped
two to the University of Arizona in
Tucson on November 21 and 22, the
first by a score of 11 to 4 and the
second 8 to 3.
Bob Klummer was badly shaken
up but not injured in the final mix
with the Arizona Wildcats when he
took a bad spill in the second tilt,
but otherwise the team is reported
in good condition.
Probable riders for the Stanford
teams, in the Utah games will be Ben
Snure, Bill Dirker, Denny Green,
Mike Gates, and possibly Bob Klum
mer and Ralph Grana. There is a
possibility of a return jaunt to the
Utah campus in early December, but
Coach Ranzoni stresses that most
polo schedules must be tentative
because of the possibility of early
rain.

C. B. Chandler of Lowell is re
ported to have picked 3,000 four
leaf clovers last summer —just for
luck.
