i record.
NEW YORK. Nov. 23 (UP).—As
the curtain slowly descends upon the
1941 football season, ovations al
ready are in order for the men and
coaches of four fine teams who suc
cessfully carried championship ban
ners through one of the stormiest
campaigns in gridiron history, Min
nesota. Texas Aggies, Utah and Penn
sylvania.
This quartet has repeated for the
titles in their leagues, after weather
ing a'wave of upsets that swept from
coast to coast as the level!ing-ofl
process-worked overtime.
Minnesota's Golden Gophers again
took the Big Ten crown, by wal
; loping Wisconsin, 41-6.
AGS REMARKABLE
'Homer Norton's Texas Aggies, who
| shared the Southwest Conference
crown with Southern Methodist last
J year, have achieved a feat that will
be long remembered by pounding
through to sole possession of the
| title with an outfit that had nine
! vacant pairs of first-string shoes
when the season opened, after the
graduation of Jarrin' Jawn Kim
brough and Company.
Pennsylvania repeated for the
eastern Ivy League diadem by blank
ing Cornell, 16-0, before 74,000 fans
at Philadelphia, in a game that saw
Cornell's big Reds threaten but
| once. Pennsylvania lost only to
! Navy during the season.
UTES AGAIN
Utah, pride of the Rocky Moun
! tains, finished its schedule last
| Thursday with a 33-21 victory over
j Utah State.
Meanwhile, Missouri should not
be overlooked, because the black
and gold Tigers clinched the Big Six
j championship.
Duke clinched at least a tic for the
Southern Conference crown by com
pleting its schedule with a 55-6 romp
over North Carolina State. This vic
tory left Duke with a perfect
i record.
