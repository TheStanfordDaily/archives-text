# Water Polo Squad Preps For Cal Tilt
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
With the two-fold goal of cinching
a runner-up spot in the 1941 coast
conference race and winning their
first straight series over Cal in eight
years. Coach Nor! Thornton and the
Stanford water polo varsity are
pointing for their final game against
California in Stanford pool at 4
Thursday.
If the Farm splashers tip the Ber
keley mermen, they will move into
undisputed command of second
place in coast standings. A defeat
would toss the Thorntonmen into a
three-way tie for the runner-up
spot with U.S.C. and Cal claiming
part of the glory.
NEVER WON CAL SERIES
In seven years of play, Stanford
has never been able to win both
halves of the annual two-game se
ries. Five times swimmers from the
East Bay institution have split even
with the locals, and twice the Cal
team has won both tilts of a par
ticular season.
Stanford thoroughly ducked Cali
fornia. 7 to 4, in the Berkeley pool
on November 15 for the first of their
3941 series. Both teams have pre
viously defeated such strong teams
as San Jose State, and a close tilt
is forecast.
LINE-CP ON PRACTICES
Although actual starting line-ups
await the outcome of intensive prac
tice sessions this week, Stanford
hopes in aquatic "Big Game" rest
upon Grant Culley and Hadley Ba
con, forwards, Goalie Pete Lee and
Ed Smith, Sprint. Bill Mapel, Center
back Jack Bleeker, and Guard Bob
Jones and Captain Frank Mitchell.
Don Smith may be ready to return
to action as a replacement at either
sprint n',' —f-QDyard after a week's
lay-off with a tliri^ll-ipfection.
As a preliminary to {fcc-~VBr§Uy
game, the Stanford frosh will meet
the California first-year squad at
2:15. The freshmen, who have de
veloped into one of the smoothest
frosh squads in Farm annals, will
rely upon the efforts of Bob Mapel,
Jim Noble, Sandy Wilkinson, Phil
Lee, Bud Carpenter, and others.
