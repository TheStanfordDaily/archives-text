# Doubt in Our Minds? Not This Year
## 
### 
YOU'VE all heard about it. Sophs, juniors
and seniors have been through it before.
For the rest of the year it's either something
to look forward to or to look back upon, but
right now it's on us, the biggest week in a Stan
ford year, and right on top of a vacation when
we didn't quite get all the studying done we
had planned.
It's Big Game Week.
This afternoon and this evening, two meetings
are being held which will vitally affect this and
succeeding Big Game Weeks.
At 5 o'clock in the Nitery all float chairmen
from every living group will meet to get the
"cold dope" on what can appear on floats, and
what will qualify a float for exclusion from the
parade by the censoring committee.
It is hoped that none will have to be excluded.
And tonight in Encina at 7 o'clock some 400
frosh will gather in the lobby after dinner to
hear a few words from A.S.S.U. President
George Jackson and Men's Council Chairman
Stan Owen.
What these fellows have to say won't take
very much time, but if their warnings go un
heeded, the consequences will be pretty se :
rious.
If the members of the Class of '45 during the
next few days proceed to lose their lose
their emotional balance, lose the common sense
they were born with, if they qet caught in
Berkeley on a raidincr party,' those freshmen
will be fiYjPfAed from Stanford.
Ceu student body President Ralph Fisher told
The Daily last night that every possible effort
has been made on the Berkeley campus' to
eliminate Cal raids, both on Stanford and the
City of Berkeley, and that a spirit of fair play
and sportsmanship has been stressed by cam
pus leaders and the Daily Californian.
However, he added that Big "C" guards will
be strengthened for the coming week. We trust
their nightly vigils will be interrupted only by
marauding high school pranksters.
Cal is doing its share in helping to eliminate
the senseless, dangerous, and unsportsman
like practice of pre-game raiding.
Last year the excuse given to Men's Council
by wayward raiders nabbed by Berkeley police
or fraternity men was that they "didn't know"
they were subject to punishment if they went
up to Cal.
This year the sponsors put the situation
squarely up to the freshmen in corridor meet
ings last week. The frosh seem to be adopting
a pretty sensible viewpoint.
There is only one question in their minds—
will the student government stick to its guns,
will Men's Council actually go so far as to kick
a frosh out of Stanford for raiding Cal?
The answer is an emphatic "yes."
We are sure there will be no doubt in any
freshman's mind as to the unqualified position
the A.S.S.U. is taking in this matter after the
talks in Encina tonight.

succeeding Big Game Weeks.
At 5 o'clock in the Nitery all float chairmen
from every living group will meet to get the
"cold dope" on what can appear on floats, and
what will qualify a float for exclusion from the
parade by the censoring committee.
It is hoped that none will have to be excluded.
And tonight in Encina at 7 o'clock some 400
frosh will gather in the lobby after dinner to
hear a few words from A.S.S.U. President
George Jackson and Men's Council Chairman
Stan Owen.
What these fellows have to say won't take
very much time, but if their warnings go un
heeded, the consequences will be pretty se :
rious.
If the members of the Class of '45 during the
next few days proceed to lose their lose
their emotional balance, lose the common sense
they were born with, if they qet caught in
Berkeley on a raidincr party,' those freshmen
will be fiYjPfAed from Stanford.
Ceu student body President Ralph Fisher told
The Daily last night that every possible effort
has been made on the Berkeley campus' to
eliminate Cal raids, both on Stanford and the
City of Berkeley, and that a spirit of fair play
and sportsmanship has been stressed by cam
pus leaders and the Daily Californian.
However, he added that Big "C" guards will
be strengthened for the coming week. We trust
their nightly vigils will be interrupted only by
marauding high school pranksters.
Cal is doing its share in helping to eliminate
the senseless, dangerous, and unsportsman
like practice of pre-game raiding.
Last year the excuse given to Men's Council
by wayward raiders nabbed by Berkeley police
or fraternity men was that they "didn't know"
they were subject to punishment if they went
up to Cal.
This year the sponsors put the situation
squarely up to the freshmen in corridor meet
ings last week. The frosh seem to be adopting
a pretty sensible viewpoint.
There is only one question in their minds—
will the student government stick to its guns,
will Men's Council actually go so far as to kick
a frosh out of Stanford for raiding Cal?
The answer is an emphatic "yes."
We are sure there will be no doubt in any
freshman's mind as to the unqualified position
the A.S.S.U. is taking in this matter after the
talks in Encina tonight.
YOU'VE all heard about it. Sophs, juniors
and seniors have been through it before.
For the rest of the year it's either something
to look forward to or to look back upon, but
right now it's on us, the biggest week in a Stan
ford year, and right on top of a vacation when
we didn't quite get all the studying done we
had planned.
It's Big Game Week.
This afternoon and this evening, two meetings
are being held which will vitally affect this and
succeeding Big Game Weeks.
At 5 o'clock in the Nitery all float chairmen
from every living group will meet to get the
"cold dope" on what can appear on floats, and
