# More Deadly Than War
## 
### 
IT is not too much to hope that by 1951 the
mass-murder of men in this world will have
ceased, replaced by a new and better civiliza
tion. But one conflict that will still be raging
ten years from now will be the war on tuber
culosis.
Guns and gas are horrible enough instru
ments of death, but, numerically, tuberculosis
is even more deadly to young people. Tuber
culosis is preventable and curable, yet it still
takes the greatest death toll among young
people.
The tuberculin armies of death, however, do
not go unchallenged. For 34 years the National
Tuberculin Association has led the war on tu
berculosis, financed solely by its annual Christ
mas Seal sale.
This morning Stanford students will receive
a sheet of Christmas Seals. And- the enclosed
letter from Student Body President George
Jackson is worthy of full consideration. Stu
dents receiving the seals are urged to buy and
use them as generously as possible.
Remember, each seal purchased helps in the
fight against the tuberculin germ which may
strike at you or your friends with little warning.
Tuberculosis can and will be eradicated.
Perhaps not by 1951 or '55, but this year's cam
paign slogan is significant:
"NO MORE TUBERCULOSIS BY 1960." —
