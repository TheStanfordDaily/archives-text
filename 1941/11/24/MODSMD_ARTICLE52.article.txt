DISPLAYING the same initiative which
brought the Stanford Carillon into being,
the editors of that literary magazine are now
looking beyond the confines of their immediate
services to the University community.
Hereafter, the Carillon will be acting as an
agent, as well as a publisher, for its contributors.
Contact has been established with several na
tional magazine editors, who have indicated
their willingness to consider articles, fiction and
poetry which Carillon editors publish.
This service will bring mutual benefits to the
Carillon and to its contributors. Assuming that
wise recommendations are made to the national
editors, the Carillon will assume considerable
prestige as a "literary clearing house" for Stan
ford. Contributors, whose pieces are recom
mended, will have the benefit of a semi-official
boost into the hallowed precincts of an editor's
office.
The fact that Carillon powers-that-be started
out with a good idea and whipped it up into a
feasible practice indicates that the magazine and
its personnel are still determined to become
part of that local realm which is serviceable and
well established.
And, that they're getting there. Rosemarie
