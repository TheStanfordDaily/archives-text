### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
A WEEK OF CONFUSION
JJARELY finishing our turkeys and all that goes
with the holidays and vaeations, we are back at
school staring the biggest week of autumn quarter in
the eye. For it is Big Game week. This is the week
when things happen, when the regular quiet, organized
life becomes confused and exciting.
Our freshmen will stick telephone poles into the
ground and pile wood until they have a bonfire. And
they will swear and give you statistics proving that
there's the biggest bonfire that has ever been. And
they will be all keyed up, and any little rumour that
'"Cal is around" will sweep through Encina in a flash
and have all our boys out in their pajamas, ready to
battle any foe.
The Gaieties people and all their crew wilj.bf
buzzing arouTru\jaervously, holding rehearsals and
"Vi'rtoki'ng'ancl arranging Tffcjngs. .Fveryone at the Daily
will be busy closing its quarter's activity with the
regular Big Game edition. The Carillon will even be
coming out. The football team will be growing more
nervous and more excited every day, while the root
ers are already thinking of the ovation they are
going to give Frankie, Pete. Freddie and Vic, when
they leave the field after their last Big Game. And
every once in a while, in some secluded spot, you
should see some few, taking a few minutes off to pray
for an Oregon victory over Oregon State.
And all week there will be stories thrown back
and forth about the Big Game weeks of old. The way
animals kept popping up in classes and about the raids
they used to have back and forth, and about the heads
that were shaved by our California enemies and about
how tame things are now in comparison. Every story
will be a little more fantastic and a little more interest
ing, but it will be fun telling and hearing the stories,
but we hope non-inspiring.
All this will be happening in the next few days,
along with tests and papers and so forth. But by Sun
day morning it. will all be over, the whole thing will
have ended and we won't have anything to do or think
about except finals.

regular Big Game edition. The Carillon will even be

nervous and more excited every day, while the root

animals kept popping up in classes and about the raids
they used to have back and forth, and about the heads

All this will be happening in the next few days,
along with tests and papers and so forth. But by Sun

have ended and we won't have anything to do or think
about except finals.
A WEEK OF CONFUSION
JJARELY finishing our turkeys and all that goes
with the holidays and vaeations, we are back at
school staring the biggest week of autumn quarter in
the eye. For it is Big Game week. This is the week
when things happen, when the regular quiet, organized
life becomes confused and exciting.
Our freshmen will stick telephone poles into the
ground and pile wood until they have a bonfire. And
they will swear and give you statistics proving that
there's the biggest bonfire that has ever been. And
they will be all keyed up, and any little rumour that
'"Cal is around" will sweep through Encina in a flash
and have all our boys out in their pajamas, ready to
battle any foe.
