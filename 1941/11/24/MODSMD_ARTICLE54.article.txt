JUST TOSS IN TIIE TOWEL

r JW EDITOR, SIR:
So we are in the war! There's nothing that ean
be done about it because we are in the war. To you
who have any qualms or strenuous objections, no
longer raise your voices in loud or angry protest
against acts that may involve us in war, because this
unwanted eventuality already exists.
It was all very subtle, wasn't it! The President
hates war, the Republicans and Democrats hate war,
yet we are at war all the same.
Apparently our hates are overruled by our ideals
of democracy or such. Rational teasing and milking of
our gullible American senses of responsibility brought
us to our present brink of hysterical desperation and
status of war.
Therefore, damn not because our American forces
have encamped in Iceland; or because our neutrality
bill no longer exists; or because we sink German ships;
or because we stick our necks out so the sun will
always shine over England—inasmuch as we are al
ready at war.
Don't even damn yourself for letting this thing hap
pen because it would have always been "too late" for
individual or concerted counter-action. Why? We
have always been "already at war" from the standpoint
of the present day gigantic, superman-struggle for
world dominion.

THOSE STANFORD WOMEN

r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
This is my fourth and last year at Stanford, and
I can no longer restrain this letter. One of the things
which I have learned here, and I learned it early,
was why only about half of all Stanford women marry,
and why the minority of these marry Stanford men.
For over three years I have been giving a neutral
glance to every woman I met, doing my best to keep
my expression from betraying my curiosity as to how
long it would take this particular frosh to become a
typical wit —Stanford woman.
Almost always I found that my curiosity was un
founded; she already was one. Without fail, now, for
three long years my neutral and passive glance has
been met by one which is so cold and level that it
has made me shrink into my oiled moccasins, accused,
if I am to believe their eyes, of mentally undressing
them or of contemplating The Fate Worse than Death.
Believe me, there are notably few Stanford women
whom I would care to see at all undressed; most of
them would be more attractive in seven veils—worn
over their usual clothes. The small number of Stan
ford women married by Stanford men is explained by
the small number of men who have the courage,
patience, determination, and/or thronic alcoholism to
a degree which enables them to live with a woman
who is insincere, coldly and smugly superior, and in
sincere.
After I graduate, I do not know when I shall meet
with any number of Stanford women again, but I am
sure that it will not be in Heaven or in Hell. They
are too superior to condescend to Heaven, and they
haven't sufficient qualifications to get into Hell.
Lovingly.
