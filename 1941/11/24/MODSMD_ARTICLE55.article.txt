# Gay, Naughty Show Laughs At Jealousy

### 
"THE FEMININE TOUCH," now
playing at the Fox-Stanford Theater
in Palo Alto.
"The Feminine Touch" doesn't
prove very much, except that Don
Ameche is just as"unattractive with
his hair mussed as with his hair
glued down with the stickum he has
been using recently. But it is a
very gay and witty opus and a mas
terpiece of innuendo, thanks to Mr.
Ogden Nash, who had something to
do with the scenario. The movies
seem to be doing quite a bit of this
sort of thing lately; Will Hays, stay
'way from my door.
The general point of the whole
thing seems to lie that women like,
one, to be made jealous of their men,
and, two, to have their men jealous
of them. Mr. Ameche, as the psy
chology professor who has written
a book on jealously and thinks that
his home life is safe from such petty
intrusions, seems to be the crux of
the matter. He is, speaking from a
frankly biased point of view, so
smug as to be completely nauseat
ing.
In the role of his wife, Rosalind
Russell again turns in one of her
expert performances. Here is one
girl whose ability as a clothes-horse
is unquestioned, and whose flair for
comedy is superb. She almost makes
up for Ameche.
Van Heflin, an importation from
the New York stage does some very
pretty things with the part of a
philandering and utterly charming
publisher who cherishes a ridicu
lous goatee and wishes he could do
the same with Miss Russell.
Although the lady is still minus
her "r's," Kay Fwancis is very at
tractive, very stylish, and very good
as the publisher's assistant, another
woman with her own ideas on the
subject of jealousy.
Major W. S. Van Dyke's direction
(MGM is so proud of that "Major")
is very able. The picture moves
there is never a dull mo
ment, and there are a few that ap
proach the hysterical.
The companion feature is "Men
at Large," starring Marjorie Weaver.
She's awful.â€”Livingston
