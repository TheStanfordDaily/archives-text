# Debater Blitz Lays Utah Low
## 
### 
Some three train carloads of army
and navy men thought they were
crazy when six college gentlemen
conducted a miniature Gallup poll
on "What Do You Think about Labor
and Why?"
Several of the good citizens of
Ogden, Utah, were slightly taken
back when some of the same six
sat out in the heavy snow and just
let it trickle down their necks be
cause they had never seen snow
before.
The janitor of the Mormon church
was equally upset when one of the
members played "Come Join the
Band" on the Sunday school organ
to taunt heckling W.S.C. students.
The hotel manager didn't ex
actly mind making two quarts of
ice cream by mixing vanilla and
snow at midnight, but some of the
people invited to the party were
sick the next day.
The new style of dancing acquired
at a Utah formal which is a T for
mation cheek-to-check with only
the man in motion, several anecdotes
relating the fact that Utah women
are not exactly as religious as Brig
ham Young, the story of the vanilla
added to the orange juice in a soda
fountain which caused two apo
plectic soda jerkers . . . mix all of
these together and you get the idea
why it is not necessary but dis
tinctly helpful to be cracked when
one goes on a debate trip, especially
to Utah.
