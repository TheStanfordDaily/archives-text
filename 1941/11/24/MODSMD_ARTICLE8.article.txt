# Firemen Refill Old Extinguishers
## 
### 
Fire extinguishers on the campus
living houses were completely re
filled during the three-day Thanks
giving holidays, according to Fire
Chief Dugan.
During the summer extinguishers
all over the university are checked
and refilled. Living houses are left
to the school term because of the
difficulty of getting into the locked
houses during the summer.
