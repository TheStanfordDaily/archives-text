# History ... 1941

### AMIE REICHERT 
IJERMANN GOERING is going to
wear a new fancy-dress suit to
day, and he stayed up all night pol
ishing his medals, because there is
going to be a great pageant in Ber
lin.
Yes, the blitz has sort of bogged
down, and the German people are
wondering what happened to what
Der Fuehrer promised would be the
greatest victory of the year, and
they are asking, "How 'bout that,
Adolf?" So Showman Hitler is giv
ing them a show—one might say bur
lesque.
The original tough guys of the
National Socialist Party rode into
office on a wave of Communist
hatred and a red-baiting platform.
They were helped along by the
conservative elements, the custo
dians of privilege and property in
Germany, who were looking nerv
ously toward the ponderous but
inevitable rise in the East of the
Bear That Walks Like a Man.
They had no qualms about Nazi
ism; they were only squeamish
about the pinkos, but Hitler and his
thugs laid all fears at rest by beating
up on several hundred old women
and children, and then pointing
with pride to the extermination of
the Bolshevist vermin.
* * *
yi ND then, the master stroke, Der
Fuehrer put the pledge in writ
ing. That was in 1936, and the pledge
was the anti-comintern pact, de
scribed by the German authors as a
"world demonstration against Bol
shevism."
Hitler conveniently forgot all
about that pact, forgot about the
Reds, the Bolsheviks, the vermin,
even started calling them "our
Russian friends" several years
back when it was to his advantage.
He wanted to make sure that he
wouldn't he stabbed in the back
by Friend Stalin —at least not
yet—while he was busy with Brit
ain and the rest of the Western
Continent, and he wanted food for
his army, oil for his tanks.
But Uncle Joe is a sly fox, as Hen-
Hitler is only now finding out to his
eternal and sincere regret. He never
trusted the Nazis, and when time
came to fight them, he was prepared,
armed to the teeth, in fact.
Hitler can't forgive that, he can't
forget that the man who fooled ev
eryone for eight years, himself got
fooled. And by a vermin Bolshevik
at that.

NOW in Berlin they are re
k newing the anti-comintern pact.
Representatives from at least twelve
of the satellite states of Greater Ger
many are packing their portman
teaus and traveling to Berlin, where
they will sign a five-year renewal
of the pledge and incidentally do a
little horse trading on the side. (You
may be sure that Hitler will get the
horses, his friends the jackasses.)
Countries represented at the
conference include Japan. Italy,
Manchukuo, Hungary, Spain (the
original six signers) and the new
nations: Finland, Denmark, Bul
garia, Rumania, Slovakia, Croatia,
and the Japanese-sponsored Wang
Ching Wei Nanking government.
But Marshal Petain is having a
secret rendezvous with Gocring to
morrow at Fountainbleau.
* a|t *

r J , HERE is considerable speculation
as to what sort of a deal Hitler
will, offer the marshal. The New
York Times correspondent from An
kara reported yesterday that Ger
many will serve an ultimatum on
the Vichy government demanding
the French fleet for convoy service
in the Mediterranean, and the es
tablishment of German bases in
French Tunis.
The alternative is reported (o
he total occupation of France,
overthrow of the Vicliy govern
ment, and seizure and imprison
ment of the Vichy government
leaders.
Whatever the case may be, it
seems apparent since the removal
of Weygand, that Vichyfrance is
moving closer and closer into the
Axis orb. Who knows, if Petain
and Darlan are real good boys, they
might even be made junior partners,
and have their names put up on
the door of the firm which deals in
"new and -old puppets, bought and
sold." Step right up, boys.
