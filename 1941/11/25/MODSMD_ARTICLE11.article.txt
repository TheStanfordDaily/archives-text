# Ocean Current Shift Causes Freak Weather
## Dr. Mears Explains Atmospheric Change Over South America 
### 
A change of course in the Hum
boldt current in the Pacific Ocean
within the last year is causing
freakish weather conditions in sev
eral coastal regions of Latin Amer
ica, according to Dr. Eliot G. Mears,
Stanford geographer.
Dr. Mear's description of the ef
fects of this current was the subject
of yesterday's short-wave broadcast
to Latin America from the Hoover
Library.
Better knowledge of atmospheric
circulation in the south Pacific area
is necessary to plan reliable plane
routes, Dr. Mears pointed out.
Dirigibles have been torn to pieces
in attempts to straddle opposing air
currents in the lower Pacific ix?gion.
The Humboldt current also inter
rupts the route followed by ships in
transit between Panama and Aus
tralia, according to Dr. Mears.
CHANGES SEVERE
"Climatic changes during the last
year are without parallel in our his
tory," Dr. Mears said. "Panama has
experienced very abnormal rains; in
Guayaquil and in the northern part
of Peru there has been excessive
heat...there is vegetation in Talara
such as no one remembers seeing
in that arid region."
Radical changes in the climate of
the Galapagos Islands resulting
from the new direction of the Hum
boldt current foretell changes in
Pan-American economy, according
to Dr. Mears.
Increased . rehabilitation of arid
regions will enable Latin America to
feed more of her own people.
RAINFALL HEAVY
"The rainfall in the Galapagos
Islands has been so heavy that the
bleak coast is covered with lush fo
liage," Dr. Mears said. "There are
millions of flics and mosquitoes; dol
phins play in the lagoons that, have
formed, while thousands of birds are
dying because they canot, find the
customary food that the sea used to
wash up on the beaches."
