## Parade of 50 Floats Honors Past Tilts 
### 
With Stanford's newspaper friend, |
Bill Leiser, lined up as principal j
rally speaker, preparations for l
Thursday night's Big Game parade
and rally went forward yesterday
under the combined leadership of
Rally Committee, Cardinals, and
Axe Society.
Leiser, sports editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, is generally
conceded to he the first sports writer
of prominence to see signs of some
thing besides rags in Stanford's fam
ous 1039 "Rags to Riches" Rose Bowl
champions.
Handling the duties as master of
ceremonies will be Dana Winters,
'40, former Gaieties star and Ram's
Head member, and one of the top
"funnymen" on the campus.
IVIED SCHOOL CHORUS
Also included in the tentative rally
program is the now famous Med
School Chorus, winners of last
spring's Singfest and perhaps the
most popular informal singing group
on campus, in their rendition of the
Whiffenpoof Song.
Unforeseen production schedule
difficulties will prevent Alan Hale,
movie star, who originally had con-'
sen ted to appear, from speaking at
the rally.
Plans for the parade were formu
lated in yesferday afternoon's
meeting of representatives from al
most all the 55 campus living groups.
KEEP 'EM CLEAN
Rally Committee Co-chairmen Pi
Thornton and Mickey Levee out
lined the restrictions placed upon
floats this year. "Keep 'em clean"
was emphasized at the meeting. |

Cardinals, and Ex Committee will
judge the floats before they are al
' lowed to enter the parade. Repre
