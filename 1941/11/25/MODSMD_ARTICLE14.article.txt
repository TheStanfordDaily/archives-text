"Five Miles High," colored mo- ]
lion pictures taken on the second J
highest mountain in the world and
at the highest point on the earth's
surface ever reached by camera,
will be shown tonight by Paul K.
Petzoldt, alpinist and explorer, at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium for the
Tuesday Evening Series.
During the film Mr. Petzoldt. will
tell the experiences of his party of
five, members of the American
Karakoram Expedition, who broke
all previous records in climbing the
glacier-covered ranges of the K2,
regarded by alpinists as the most
difficult mountains in the world to
climb, in the Himalayas.
The is 28,250 feet high, and
Mr. Petzoldt and his camera
reached an altitude of 26,500 feet.
FILM SHOWS JOURNEY
The film shows the journey of 350
miles from the end of the last auto
road to the foot of K2, through the
Vale of Kashmir, over the top of
the Himalayan ranges, and across
the vast deserts. Much of that ter
ritory is wild and unmapped, and
for the last 35 miles of the trip,
j which took a month, the party trav
j eled over a glacier.
The pictures also show the actual
j climbing of K2 at. an elevation of
26,000 feet and the life of the alpin
ists during the two months they
spent on that peak.
2000 FEET FROM TOP
Mr. Petzoldt and Dr. Charles S.
| Houston, his only companion on the
] final stage of the climb, reached a
! small plateau less than 2,000 feet
j from the still unconquered crest
j when, exhausted, they were forced
to turn back, since their supply of
food, matchcs, and fuel was almost
gone.
According to Mr. Petzoldt, when
you are 26.000 feet above sea level
|on some snow-covered crag, your
thoughts are more likely to dwell
, on such immediate matters of sur
j vial as food, freezing, and avalanches
1 of hurtling ice, rather than on the
! grandeur of the scenery.

for the last 35 miles of the trip,
j which took a month, the party trav
j eled over a glacier.
The pictures also show the actual
j climbing of K2 at. an elevation of
26,000 feet and the life of the alpin
ists during the two months they
spent on that peak.
2000 FEET FROM TOP
Mr. Petzoldt and Dr. Charles S.
| Houston, his only companion on the
] final stage of the climb, reached a
! small plateau less than 2,000 feet
j from the still unconquered crest
j when, exhausted, they were forced
to turn back, since their supply of
food, matchcs, and fuel was almost
gone.
According to Mr. Petzoldt, when
you are 26.000 feet above sea level
|on some snow-covered crag, your
thoughts are more likely to dwell
, on such immediate matters of sur
j vial as food, freezing, and avalanches
1 of hurtling ice, rather than on the
! grandeur of the scenery.
"Five Miles High," colored mo- ]
lion pictures taken on the second J
highest mountain in the world and
at the highest point on the earth's
surface ever reached by camera,
will be shown tonight by Paul K.
Petzoldt, alpinist and explorer, at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium for the
Tuesday Evening Series.
During the film Mr. Petzoldt. will
tell the experiences of his party of
five, members of the American
Karakoram Expedition, who broke
all previous records in climbing the
glacier-covered ranges of the K2,
regarded by alpinists as the most
difficult mountains in the world to
climb, in the Himalayas.
The is 28,250 feet high, and
Mr. Petzoldt and his camera
reached an altitude of 26,500 feet.
FILM SHOWS JOURNEY
The film shows the journey of 350
miles from the end of the last auto
road to the foot of K2, through the
Vale of Kashmir, over the top of
the Himalayan ranges, and across
the vast deserts. Much of that ter
ritory is wild and unmapped, and
for the last 35 miles of the trip,
j which took a month, the party trav
j eled over a glacier.
