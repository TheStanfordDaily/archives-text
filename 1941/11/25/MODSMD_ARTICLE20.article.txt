## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 (UP).â€”
California's famed "Okie" law, used
during the depression years to piv
vent Midwestern dust bowl migrants
and other indigents from pouring
into the state, was declared uncon
stitutional by the Supreme Court
today in a far-reaching decision af
fecting 27 other states.
The court's unanimous decision,
written by Justice James F. Byrnes,
struck vigorously at. "attempts on
the part of any single state to iso
late itself from difficulties common
to all of them by restraining the
transportation of persons and prop
erty across its borders."
