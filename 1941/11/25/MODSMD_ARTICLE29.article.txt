# Photographer 'Nick' Remarks On Stanford Coed Subjects

"'! don't want (his picture to (hitter me; I want it to look just like me.
Now where do I sit?"
And with this typical observation, another Stanford coed sat down to
have her picture taken for the 1942 Quad. "But she took a good picture,"
remarked Nicholas Johnston, who is taking all the individual pictures for
the Stanford Yearbook.

Often taking as many as a hun
dred pictures in an afternoon, John
ston, known as "Nick" to everybody
who has had his picture taken by
him, is getting to know a lot about
what goes into making up the Stan
ford student, even though a regular
20 minutes setting is condensed down
to an average 15 minutes.
MAKE ME GLAMOROUS
"Then there is the obviously hon
est soul who comes in and says,
'How about Mattering me? Can't you
make me glamorous?' Of course I
do my best on all the pictures, ft is
inevitable that retakes have to be
made, although this year only about
1 out of 50 has to be retaken. We
want every student to be perfectly
satisfied with his picture."
In conjunction with this, Johnston
will hold proof sessions every eve
ning this week from 8 until 10 p.m.
at his studio on University Avenue.
The proofs will be gone over per
sonally and the student can discuss
changes or retakes, if necessary.
Surrounded by bright lights, miles
of electric cord and piles of nega
tives, Johnston starts a little conver
sation with the student, meanwhile
busily getting his camera ready.
MOISTEN TIIE LIPS
"Now then. Come on, let 'er
break (at which a big smile comes
over the sitter's face). Moisten the
lips. Eyes up here. Head up. All
rightâ€”a little happier, eh?"
This particular Stanford man just
looked at Johnston. "What? After
last week-end?" he finally said.
GIRLS ATTRACTIVE
Nick thinks the reason there is the
rumor that Stanford women are so
unattractive goes back to the time
when the "500" were at Stanford and
the ratio was so great between the
men and women thiit there were too
many boys who couldn't get dates,
and so began the talk in self-defense.
"I think the Stanford women are
on the whole particularly attrac
tive. From my contacts at schools
in the East and at Southern Califor
nia universities, there are as many
attractive students at Stanford a.s
there are at any of the other schools.
The girls here have the nice, healthy
complexions that photograph so
well."
