### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt and House lead
ers tonight reached 3 general under
standing on a drastic legislative
program which would vest the chief
executive with authority to outlaw
defense-crippling strikes.
The legislation, stronger by far
than most of the labor proposals now
before the House or Senate, will be
presented to Congress next week.
The understanding was reached at
a 2 J /2-hour White House conference
at which Mr. Roosevelt told nine
Democratic and two Republican
legislators he believed that labor
legislation now is required.
