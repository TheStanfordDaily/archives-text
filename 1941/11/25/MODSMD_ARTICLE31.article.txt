# Concert Ticket Deadline Set
## Students Must Get Ducats by Tomorrow 
### 
Students who have concert series
tickets waiting for them at the series
office must pick them up before 5
p.m. tomorrow, Manager Helen
Peterson warned yesterday.
The office, in the Old Union, will
be open from 1 to 5 this afternoon
and tomorrow afternoon. Both sea
son tickets and single ducats for
next Tuesday's Paul Robeson con
cert are ready to be picked up.
There are a few season tickets
left, as well as seats on the stage for
the Robeson concert. Because of a
misunderstanding of the new tax
law on theater tickets, season tick
ets sold after Oct. 1 were sold at 15
cents below the proper price, and
students who bought them will be
charged the extra 15 cents when
they pick them up.
