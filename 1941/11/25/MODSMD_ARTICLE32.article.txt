# Canadians Blast Nazi Submarine
## 
### 
OTTAWA, Nov. 24 (UP). â€”Two
Canadian corvettes recently sank a
German submarine in the North At
lantic and took prisoner 47 members
of its crew, the British Admiralty
informed Canadian Navy Minister
Angus L. Mac Donald tonight.
The vessels, H.M.C.S. Chambly and
H.M.C.S. Moose Jaw, were on con
voy duty, but whether the convoy
was that which carried the Fifth
Canadian (armored) Division could
not be learned. Announcement of
the Fifth Division's safe arrival in
Britain was made in London today.
The Admiralty's message read:
"H.M.C.S. Chambly, with H.M.C.S.
Moose Jaw in company, recently sank
: a German U-boat in the North At
lantic. "This successful action
fought by two Canadian-built cor
vettes is a splendid demonstration of
the protection given to convoys by
ships of the Royal Canadian Navy."
