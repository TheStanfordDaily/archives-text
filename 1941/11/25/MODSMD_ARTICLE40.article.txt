played five games, of which it has
won two and tied three. Cal has
lost one and tied one. These two
teams are tied since the league
gives one point for a tie and two

practice for the Cal game and the
Cal game is going to be tough. They
beat U.C.L.A. 4-1," said Maloney.
"The games must start at 3
promptly since it gets dark so early,"
he emphasized.
