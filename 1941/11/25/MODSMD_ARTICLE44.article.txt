i r J' , UESDAY morning roundup on the Stanford sports front:
FOOTBALL—If Pete Kinetovic is not in shape to plav a lot of foot
j ball in Saturday's Big Game, it might not be a bad guess that the Indians
will attack from their power sqt-up. . . . Details of the way the revised
T may work against the Bears are being kept pretty quiet. A quote
from ace lineman* "Charlie Chuck' Taylor: ''Tell everyone to pray for
that Oregon team to whip Oregon State." Answer: Most everyone has
been praying for that for a week already. Stanford will just have'to let
j the chips fall where they may next Saturday at Eugene* and concentrate
\ on the Cards coming through with a victory here.
GOLF—An exhibition of very good golf should be the result tomorrow
afternoon when Stanford's Bud Brownell and Warren Berl team up to

play Denny Shutc, twice P.G.A.
champ, and another pro. Shute is
now traveling for a national de
partment store. Just how the game
played by the Stanford pair stacks
up with the hrand of golf turned
in by the pro duo will he seen,
although that isn't the real idea
of the match.
WATER POLO—When the season
started, it appeared that Nort
Thornton's charges had a good
chance to cod the P.C.C. title, but
the U.C.L.A. tea m upset any plans
the Indians were making by turning
back the Farm men twice. But the
fight keeps up right to the* season
finale, for when the Cards clash with
California Thursday, undisputed pos
session of second position in the final
standings will be at stake. Further
more, Thornton's outfit will be try
ing to turn a trick which Stanford
water polo teams have found im
possible for the last seven years.
That is. they'll be trying to make it
a clean sweep in the California-
Stanford series for the year. A set
up like that should fill the bleachers.

SOCCER—After today's double duty, Harry Maloney's eleven h;is only
two days of practice before its Big Game Friday afternoon. The Indians
will be trying to break out of the tie column and into the win column in
the standings of the Northern California Soccer League. Friday is their
last chance, and a victory over the Bears will make the season a success.

jF, BY CHANCE, both Stanford and Oregon State drop into the ranks
of the thrice defeated Saturday and Washington defeats U.S.C., result
ing in Stanford, Oregon. Oregon State, Washington, and Washington State
all being tied for first place in the conference, the vote for the Rose Bowl
host will be a tough one.
YOU HEAR a lot of peculiar filings in barber shop bull sessions,
but yesterday wc heard a spicy hit that bears repeating. The fellow
in the next chair offered the suggestion that should the season end in
the aforementioned tie. the conference should choose the eastern rep
resentative and let that outfit select the western team.
Incidentally, if that were done—which it won't be—we'd be willing to
bet that the eastern team would pick Stanford, for there is no doubt but
what the Indians put on the most interesting show on the field of any out
fit in this loop, even in defeat.
The way the public has turned out to see the Indians this season is
proof enough of that. Few teams in the nation have drawn more to the
stadia this fall than has Clark Shaughnessy's latest grid creation.
