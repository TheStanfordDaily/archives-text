# 'Kmetovic Becomes Coach Clark's Unknown Quantity As Bear-Card Tilt Nears
## 
### 
Pete Kmetovic, nimble-footed
halfback, is an unknown quantity in
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's plans for
the Big Game with Cal Saturday.
Pete was out in sweat clothes at
yesterday afternoon's practice, but
, Shaughnessy did not work him very
hard. The team's other cripple, Full
back Milt Vucinieh, was in suit, but
was still limping noticeably on his
lame ankle.
The Cards' first three teams work
ed alternately on defense against
the "blocks,' and on offense against
the frosh, who were called out of
j their post-Little-Big-Game hiber-
I nation. Over at Berkeley Stub Alii—
I son put red and white jerseys on
1 his Rambler backs and ran off a T-
I formation attack, remarkably similar
to Mr. Shaughnessy's version.
BEARS IN TOP SHAPE
The Bears appeared in top shape
with A1 Derian, Bill Reinhard, Gene
Pickett, and Armand Swisher, their
main invalid previously, back in
suit. Looking particularly fit was
Bob Reinhard, the All-American
tackle, who was out with influenza
during last season's Big Game.
Reinhard and Jack McQuary,
booming fullback, were elected
team co-captains for the game by
the squad members. Jim Jurkovich
| has been made honorary captain,
! even though he is out of football.
Ken Robesky returned to Stanford
; yesterday after an absence of two
weeks. Ken was at the bedside of
his father, who passed away last
i week.
ROBESKY FO r TAYLOR

| rific submarining. Chuck needs a
•substitute, for few men can play 60
! minutes of his brand of ball.
With the conference title and the
; Rose Bowl bid depending on this
game (and an Oregon victory over
Oregon State), the 90,000 seats in
the stadium will be nearly filled, if
the 75,000 pre-game ticket sale is

I son put red and white jerseys on
1 his Rambler backs and ran off a T-
I formation attack, remarkably similar
to Mr. Shaughnessy's version.
BEARS IN TOP SHAPE
The Bears appeared in top shape
with A1 Derian, Bill Reinhard, Gene
Pickett, and Armand Swisher, their
main invalid previously, back in
suit. Looking particularly fit was
Bob Reinhard, the All-American
tackle, who was out with influenza
during last season's Big Game.
Reinhard and Jack McQuary,
booming fullback, were elected
team co-captains for the game by
the squad members. Jim Jurkovich
| has been made honorary captain,
! even though he is out of football.
Ken Robesky returned to Stanford
; yesterday after an absence of two
weeks. Ken was at the bedside of
his father, who passed away last
i week.

With the conference title and the
; Rose Bowl bid depending on this
game (and an Oregon victory over
Oregon State), the 90,000 seats in
the stadium will be nearly filled, if
the 75,000 pre-game ticket sale is
! any indication.
Pete Kmetovic, nimble-footed
halfback, is an unknown quantity in
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's plans for
the Big Game with Cal Saturday.
Pete was out in sweat clothes at
yesterday afternoon's practice, but
, Shaughnessy did not work him very
hard. The team's other cripple, Full
back Milt Vucinieh, was in suit, but
was still limping noticeably on his
lame ankle.
The Cards' first three teams work
ed alternately on defense against
the "blocks,' and on offense against
the frosh, who were called out of
