! —As Western football's wackiest
I year draws toward its close, there
: aren't many followers of the fall
frenzy who would be much sur
prised if next Saturday Oregon beats
Oregon State and California takes
Stanford in their climax games.
If that happens, the scramble for
the Rose Bowl bid will be so wild
any school in the conference, no
matter how its season went, would
be fully justified in voting for itself
for the Pasadena junket and the
$(>O,OOO clear which goes with it.
For it would mean Oregon State,
Stanford, Washington, Washington
State, and Oregon would be in a vir
tual tie with three defeats each and
the task of finding the most repre
sentative team from among the five
J would be as easy as looking for a
needle in the proverbial haystack.
