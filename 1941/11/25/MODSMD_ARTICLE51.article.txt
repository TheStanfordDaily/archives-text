### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 24 (UP).—Hey, :
boy, bring over a copy of Burke's
Peerage, because there may be noth- 1
ing but dukes in the Sugar Bowl.
A game between Duquesne of j
Pittsburgh and DuTce of Durham, j
N.C., would be a natural since they J
are two of the three major un- !
beaten, untied teams available to the I
big bowl moguls. New Orleans is
the logical site because the Rose
Bowl is committed to the Pacific
Coast champion for half its show ;
and everybody out there has been J
beaten at least twice.
Michigan State College is giving I
turkey carving demonstrations.

NEW YORK, Nov. 24 (UP). —In
