\\ 7Y VEZ-VOUS une cigarette?"
xx Under tobacco rationing in France and
most other European countries, this plaintive cry
is voiced many times a day in many different
tongues.
And the 50 per cent of us on the Stanford
campus who smoke can all appreciate what it
is like to be without a cigarette when you want
one. And we don't even have rationing.
In Paris the situation is terrible. Not only have
the gay Parisiens had practically everything
that was Paris taken away from them, they have
almost no cigarettes. And the common people
have been the hardest hit.
The shortage is so critical that some of the
more enterprising Frenchmen have taken up
the practice of gathering cigarette stubs. Au
thentic last reports claim that little bundles of
a hundred "grade A" cigarette butts are bring
ing prices of approximately $1.00 in American
money.
That's equivalent to what we pay for "ex
pensive" cigarettes over here. And whole ones
too.
Now people have debated the Hoover plan
for feeding Europeans backwards and forwards.
Some say feed them, starvation won't break their
morale. Others say don't break the English
blockade.
Without breaking into either line of reasoning
concerning this plan, The Daily has just sent
a letter to Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty,
with copies to Churchill and King George,
pleading with them to let just one little shipload
of American cigarette butts through to the poor
Parisiens.
LeLt's give the cigarette butt scavengers of the
Rue de la Paix and the Champs-Elysees a couple
of days' holiday from their arduous task.
And we could make Stanford famous in old
Paris by starting the campaign right here. We
could fill a good part of that ship we're going
to get through the blockade with bales of butts
marked "To Paris from Stanford."
"Where would we find so many cigarette
butts?" you ask.
Why, the Inner Quad, of course.

Why, the Inner Quad, of course.
\\ 7Y VEZ-VOUS une cigarette?"
xx Under tobacco rationing in France and
most other European countries, this plaintive cry
is voiced many times a day in many different
tongues.
And the 50 per cent of us on the Stanford
campus who smoke can all appreciate what it
is like to be without a cigarette when you want
one. And we don't even have rationing.
In Paris the situation is terrible. Not only have
the gay Parisiens had practically everything
that was Paris taken away from them, they have
almost no cigarettes. And the common people
have been the hardest hit.
The shortage is so critical that some of the
more enterprising Frenchmen have taken up
the practice of gathering cigarette stubs. Au

a hundred "grade A" cigarette butts are bring
ing prices of approximately $1.00 in American

Now people have debated the Hoover plan
for feeding Europeans backwards and forwards.
Some say feed them, starvation won't break their

Without breaking into either line of reasoning
concerning this plan, The Daily has just sent
a letter to Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty,
with copies to Churchill and King George,
pleading with them to let just one little shipload
of American cigarette butts through to the poor
Parisiens.
