# How It Is with the War
## 
### 
IT may be that we won't be called upon very
much longer to send Bundles of Butts to
Europe or a Book to Tobruk if British successes,
implemented by American munitions and sup
plies, continue in Libya and the Mediterranean.
Within one week, British forces operating in
the Mediterranean sank or crippled more than
20 Axis troop transports or supply ships carry
ing reinforcements to Axis forces in North Af
rica, according to Rear Admiral Yates Stirling,
Jr., U.S.N. (Ret.), United Press naval critic.
"American tanks and planes are being re
ceived in large numbers by the considerable
British forces massed in Egypt, Palestine, Syria,
Iraq and Iran," he writes.
But if and when Germany succeeds in reduc
ing Russia to impotency, the next Nazi attack
probably would be against Iraq and Iran—ei
ther through the Caucasus or through Turkey,
whichever seems easier at the moment, accord
ing to this authority. And it is in anticipation of
such a German move that the British are mass
ing large forces in the Near East and that a
huge amount of American weapons and muni
tions is being rushed to this potential war front.
But to get down to cases, he asks where our
army and navy would most likely fight in the
event America is forced into the war. If a
second A.E.F. sails, he picks the Near East as
the point of debarkation.
This brings us to the Battle of the Atlantic
which is, of course, the present danger spot.
Encouraging news of the war at sea comes from
Prime Minister Churchill's report to Commons.
In the last four months, he said, only 180,000
tons of shipping a month have been sunk, com
pared to 500,000 tons a month during the pre
ceding four months.
Rear Admiral Stirling believes that Germany
probably has at least 150 submarines now in
active service and is building no less than five
a month, possibly more. It follows that a prac
tical point to be aimed at is to sink at least 10
U-boats a month, if they are to be eliminated in
a relatively short time. If Germany is building
five a month, and 10 are sunk, then the 150 now
in action would require 30 months to be reduced
to zero.
Figuring the marked decrease in shipping
losses in the last four months, we can reasonably
believe there has been a heavier toll taken of
German submarines by British and American
warships in the Atlantic.
Rear Admiral Stirling claims that within 12
months American shipyards should be produc
ing enough ships to supply an ample number

of vessels to carry defense materials across the
Atlantic. Coupled with progressive sinkings
of German submarines, if this can be achieved
and maintained, victory in the Battle of the
Atlantic then will be in sight.—Harold Shafer

IT may be that we won't be called upon very
much longer to send Bundles of Butts to
Europe or a Book to Tobruk if British successes,
implemented by American munitions and sup
plies, continue in Libya and the Mediterranean.
Within one week, British forces operating in
the Mediterranean sank or crippled more than
20 Axis troop transports or supply ships carry
ing reinforcements to Axis forces in North Af
rica, according to Rear Admiral Yates Stirling,
Jr., U.S.N. (Ret.), United Press naval critic.
"American tanks and planes are being re
ceived in large numbers by the considerable
British forces massed in Egypt, Palestine, Syria,
Iraq and Iran," he writes.
But if and when Germany succeeds in reduc
ing Russia to impotency, the next Nazi attack
probably would be against Iraq and Iran—ei
ther through the Caucasus or through Turkey,
whichever seems easier at the moment, accord
ing to this authority. And it is in anticipation of
such a German move that the British are mass
ing large forces in the Near East and that a
huge amount of American weapons and muni
tions is being rushed to this potential war front.
But to get down to cases, he asks where our
army and navy would most likely fight in the
event America is forced into the war. If a
second A.E.F. sails, he picks the Near East as
the point of debarkation.
This brings us to the Battle of the Atlantic
which is, of course, the present danger spot.
Encouraging news of the war at sea comes from
Prime Minister Churchill's report to Commons.
In the last four months, he said, only 180,000
tons of shipping a month have been sunk, com
pared to 500,000 tons a month during the pre
ceding four months.
Rear Admiral Stirling believes that Germany
probably has at least 150 submarines now in
active service and is building no less than five
a month, possibly more. It follows that a prac
tical point to be aimed at is to sink at least 10
U-boats a month, if they are to be eliminated in
a relatively short time. If Germany is building
five a month, and 10 are sunk, then the 150 now
in action would require 30 months to be reduced
to zero.
Figuring the marked decrease in shipping
losses in the last four months, we can reasonably
believe there has been a heavier toll taken of
German submarines by British and American
warships in the Atlantic.
Rear Admiral Stirling claims that within 12
months American shipyards should be produc
ing enough ships to supply an ample number

of vessels to carry defense materials across the
Atlantic. Coupled with progressive sinkings
of German submarines, if this can be achieved
and maintained, victory in the Battle of the
Atlantic then will be in sight.—Harold Shafer
