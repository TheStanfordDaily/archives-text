### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
SKID AROUND, PARTNER
VS7E WERE sitting in a bar in Madera, listening to
Duke Ellington's "I've Got It Bad and That Ain't
Good," listening to the music and talking about little
things, about the war, about John L. Lewis, about
football and girls, when the door flew open and a
little man with a sharp face breezed in. He was wear
ing a black suit, with a sweater under the coat. He
shook himself and blew on his hands because it was
so cold outside, and then he moved straight to the
bar and started pouring himself a beer. He drank
one swallow and immediately took up a conversation
with a big man in a lumber jacket, who wore jeans
and boots, with mud all over his clothes. The big
man was always saying that he had graduated from
Santa Clara, and that he was making a lot of money,
even though he happened to be wearing rough, dirty
clothes.
They talked for a while and were seemingly be
coming great friends, and the little man in the black
suit offered to buy the big guy from Santa Clara a
drink. "Anything you want," he said. Just then the
phone rang, and no one paid any attention to it for a
while, and then the bartender went over, listened and
then hollered, "Anybody here named Fitzpatrick?"
There was no answer. "No one here named Fitz
patrick?" he asked again.
The little man in the black suit, who was busy
with his beer and talking fast, suddenly jerked around.
"What'd you say?" he spit through his teeth.
"Anyone hex - e named Fitzpatrick?" the bartender
repeated.
"You God damn right there's someone hex-e named
Fitzpatrick."
"Who?"
"Me. That's my name. My last name. Fitzpatrick."
"Well, you're wanted on the phone," said the bar
tender.
"Phone. What the hell's wrong now. I dropped in
here for an Alka Seltzer and there's trouble already."
He walked to the phone and from what we could
hear there was some trouble with a car. Someone
had stqlen his friend's car from the middle of town.
We could tell that Fitzpatrick had been suffering
from a series of setbacks because all he did was
laugh. He didn't get mad, but all he did was laugh
and swear.

I_|E PUT down the phone and got ready to leave,
when he remembered that he had offered to buy
the big guy a drink. "I'm going to buy you that drink
now," he hollered out, and they sat down together,
talking, the best of friends. We forgot about them for
a few minutes when we heard a loud commotion
coming from our friend Fitzpatrick and his friend
from Santa Clara.
"Skid around, partner," "Fitzpatrick was saying.
"I've been around and you're not so hot."
"I make more money in a week than you make in
a month," the big guy was insisting.
"Skid around, partner," said Fitzpatrick, and he got
up to leave.
"Skipping out," said the big guy tauntingly.
Fitzpatrick spun around and stuck his face close
to that of the big guy's. "I'm crowded for time, part
ner," he said slowly.
"Skipping out," teased the big guy.
"I'm crowded for time, partner. I'm crowded, aren't
I partner?" he asked of the bartender who was stand
ing between the two. "Didn't I get a call that's been
crowding me for time?"
"He's crowded, all right," agreed the bartender.
And Fitzpatrick turned and wheeled out of the bar,
saying over and over again, "You God damn right
I'm crowded for time. You God damn right."
The big guy in the lumber jacket, the guy from
Santa Clara who was making big money, turned and
said to the bartender and the men around the bar,
"Those arc bad kind of guys. Small, aren't they? They
get me, those small guys. But I sure told him off,
didn't I? He won't be coming around here for quite
a while. I sure made him skip out, didn't I." And he
turned and offered his cigarettes around and asked
everyone to have one on him. By this time it was
getting late so we left and went to bed.
