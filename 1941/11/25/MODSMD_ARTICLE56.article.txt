# CAMPUS OPINION
## LOOK AROUND, HORACE 
### 
HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
" No, I'm not an enraged female, and I'm not seeth
ing indignantly at Figgins' generalizations on Stanford
women. I'm not going to deny or attempt to disprove
those disappointing results you say your neutral and
passive glances have brought you, Horace. But look
here, old boy. I think there are a few observations of
which you are either innocently unaware, or have un
fairly ignored.
Obviously, you have never attended any other col
lege. Well, Horace, it is time you knew the sad truth:
University of Oregon co-eds strangely enough dis
appoint their "neutral observers" with those same rigid
stares! Wash. U.? No warmer. U.C.L.A.? Oh Horace,
worse! Oregon State? Brrrr. And Eastern co-eds?
Sorry, we're getting even colder. Horace, honey,
didn'tcha know? Ain'tcha never been around? You
find 'em like that everywhere; and it's becoming a
darn disgusting habit of illusioned fellas like you—who
think the gals are always greener on the other side of
the fence—to never allude to the cool Miss American
Sophisticate without dubbing her ''Stanford Woman."
That's the catch. That's what we rightfully resent.
This exaggerate association of only Stanford fems
with "cold level stares" may be blamed partly on an
unattractive five hundred 'way back when... (darn em
anyway) but mostly on Stanford men who haven't
seen enough of the world yet to learn how much colder
and more defiant the stares are on the other side of
that fence.
I'm sorry, Horace. I suppose you feel now like you
did when they told you there wasn't any Santa Claus.
I'll admit it's disappointing. Of course there are ex
ceptions which you undoubtedly de-emphasized, and
you've misinterpreted some of the responsive stares
just as much as they misinterpreted yours. We needn't
argue about that, but we do deny that your criticism
applies exclusively to Stanford girls. The complaints
are as rightly deserved and more so by co-eds of
dozens of other colleges.
If you're not too incredulous, let me assure you
there are plenty of Stanford women minus insincerity
and superiority complexes. But I can't guarantee that
they will smile broadly and lovingly as they pass each
Horace Figgins on the Quad.
Reproachfully,
One of Them
