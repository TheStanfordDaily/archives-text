# 'Black Lamb and Grey Falcon' Reveals Story of Jugoslavia
## 
### 
"BLACK LAMB AND GREY FALCON," by Rebecca West, in two vol
umes. The Viking Press.
The story of the European continent and its peoples is such an arresting
tale of gigantic struggles between great powers, of mammoth armies and
rampaging nationalism, that the history of its little nations and peo-

pies not powerful enough to be na-.
tions is sometimes lost in the shuffle.
Miss West has taken it upon her
self to tell the story of one of the
most oppressed, ignored, and at the
same time most belligerent and na
tionalistic peoples in Europe. Known
generally as the South Slavs, these
semi-related racial groups were
thrown together in 1919 into what
seemed to its creators the logical
state of Yugoslavia.
RECOUNTS TRIP
In form these books are the re
counting of a trip through Yugo
slavia by Miss West and her hus
band in 1937. By going off on long
and intriguing tangents, however,
the author manages to make the
story less of a travel book and more
of a sympathetic, but nevertheless
piercing and highly intelligent
analysis of the South Slavs, their
problems, prejudices, hates, fears,
loves.
Although admittedly the "Balkan
problem" is one of the most tangled
and seemingly unsolvable riddles in
modern history, Miss West sticks to
her subject faithfully, keeps a liter
ary calm throughout, and leaves
her reader with the impression that
if he has not read a final solution
to the collective problem of these
peoples, he has at least read one of
the most intelligent analyses of
them and their history which has
yet been written.
INFORMAL AND CHARMING
The book is written in the in
formal and charming style that
Miss West used to make her novels
so popular in England and this
country —a style which is disai-m
-ingly natural, yet gives the reader an
alarming multitude of facts, opin
ions, subtleties, and erudition.
It would be helpful if more authors
wrote on past and contemporary
history with as pleasing a proportion
of facts, opinion and personality as
Rebecca West.—Minahan
