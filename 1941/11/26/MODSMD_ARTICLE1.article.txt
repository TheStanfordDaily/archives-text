### AMIE REICHERT 
| CAN stand just so much and then j
there comes a time when I am j
forced to drop the protective edi- ;
torial "we" and come out and fight j
all alone.
I didn't mind when that irate j
grad student, writing in Campi/;
Opinion told me to miss all my \
meals for a week; I didn't mind
when Mr. Hoovers' secretary, Miss
Dare Stark MacMullin, told me I
was a very superficial, very posi
tive young lady; I didn't mind
when every time I walked down
the Quad Colin McClintock
pointed an accusing finger at me
and roared, "You interventionist!'' ,
and I didn't even mind when the
linotypcr in the hack shop told me
I had the blood of a million Bel
gian hahies on my hands.
No, all those things were all right,
because I could always console my
self by remembering that my mother
thinks I am better than H. V. Kal
tenborn, and that the janitor at
Branner says I am keen.
But this today is the last straw. I |
can't stand this blow—the America
First Committee has written to me
from Chicago asking me to (I quote)
"assume the leadership of an Amer
ica First chapter in your college."
** . *
J AM frankly insulted, and I am
very unhappy that the America J
Firsters have not been reading my
column as religiously as I would |
wish or with the proper attitude of j
mind. Maybe they think I am a great
kidder. I don't know. But it is ob
vious that Mr. James L. Fallon,
who boars the lugubrious title of Di
rector of Colleges for America First, j
and who is the author of the letter I
received, is a little mixed up.
I think I had better sfet him j
straight lest he pass my name
along to the Bund for their mail
ing list, too.
My dear Mr Fallon:
I don't like the America First
Committee, I don't like everything
it stands for, I don't like all its
members and friends and relatives,
and I especially don't like its gold
en hoy, Charles A. Lindbergh.
And, my dear Mr. Fallon, I don't
like you too for writing me that let
ter, although you point out that if I
were to organize "an independent
America First in your college.. .from
that point forward you will have a
vital part in the future of yourself j
and America."
My dear Mr. Fallon, I might add
that if the future of myself and the
futurd of America is to rest with
America First and its executive
committee and its congressional
stooges and its braying journalist
mouthpieces, I think I shall pack my |
typewriter and take an extended
journey to Tibet.
* * *
FALLON, your letter was
most illuminating to me and I
don't like to be selfish, so I am go
ing to throw out a little light to tl.<»
rest of Stanford ;uid quote a trench
ant. paragraph
"We ar<?Hold tftat we must im
pose—impose mind you, the 'four
freedoms' on the entire world. We
must die if necessary to impose
freedom of speech in India, even
though we are not free to speak
against our mad administration
here at home. We must die to im
pose freedom of religion in Rus
sia but must submit our own
churches to the unbelievable dis
grace of 'canned sermons' and 'out
of bounds' restrictions. We must
die to impose freedom from fear
in France, when on all sides we
see our friends afraid to speak for
what they know to be right and
reasonable . .
Mr. Fallon, I don't want to be un
kind. I will just leave that glorious
blaze of light shining in the eyes of
Stanford—l hope the glare won't be
too much for us.
But I would like to ask you a
few questions, Mr. Fallon. If "wc
are not free to speak against our
mad administration here at home"
then those must he orchids, not
brickbats, that you boys arc sling
ing at Mr. Roosevelt, yes?
If our churches are fettered b;
"canned sermons" and "out of boun<
restrictions," who let Father Cough
lin in? And if you, who know wha
is "right and reasonable," are afraii
to speak, why arc you so articulaU
and why don't you hush up?

from Chicago asking me to (I quote)
"assume the leadership of an Amer

J AM frankly insulted, and I am
very unhappy that the America J
Firsters have not been reading my
column as religiously as I would |
wish or with the proper attitude of j
mind. Maybe they think I am a great
kidder. I don't know. But it is ob
vious that Mr. James L. Fallon,
who boars the lugubrious title of Di
rector of Colleges for America First, j
and who is the author of the letter I
received, is a little mixed up.
I think I had better sfet him j
straight lest he pass my name

ing list, too.
My dear Mr Fallon:
I don't like the America First
Committee, I don't like everything
it stands for, I don't like all its
members and friends and relatives,
and I especially don't like its gold
en hoy, Charles A. Lindbergh.
And, my dear Mr. Fallon, I don't
like you too for writing me that let
ter, although you point out that if I
were to organize "an independent
America First in your college.. .from
that point forward you will have a
vital part in the future of yourself j
and America."
My dear Mr. Fallon, I might add
that if the future of myself and the
futurd of America is to rest with
America First and its executive
committee and its congressional
stooges and its braying journalist
mouthpieces, I think I shall pack my |
typewriter and take an extended

tenborn, and that the janitor at
Branner says I am keen.
But this today is the last straw. I |
can't stand this blow—the America
First Committee has written to me
from Chicago asking me to (I quote)
"assume the leadership of an Amer
ica First chapter in your college."
** . *
J AM frankly insulted, and I am
very unhappy that the America J
Firsters have not been reading my
column as religiously as I would |
wish or with the proper attitude of j
mind. Maybe they think I am a great
kidder. I don't know. But it is ob
vious that Mr. James L. Fallon,
who boars the lugubrious title of Di
rector of Colleges for America First, j
and who is the author of the letter I
received, is a little mixed up.
I think I had better sfet him j
straight lest he pass my name
along to the Bund for their mail
ing list, too.
My dear Mr Fallon:
I don't like the America First
Committee, I don't like everything
it stands for, I don't like all its
members and friends and relatives,
and I especially don't like its gold
en hoy, Charles A. Lindbergh.
And, my dear Mr. Fallon, I don't
like you too for writing me that let
ter, although you point out that if I
were to organize "an independent
America First in your college.. .from
that point forward you will have a
vital part in the future of yourself j
and America."
My dear Mr. Fallon, I might add
that if the future of myself and the
futurd of America is to rest with
America First and its executive
committee and its congressional
stooges and its braying journalist
mouthpieces, I think I shall pack my |
typewriter and take an extended
journey to Tibet.
* * *
FALLON, your letter was
most illuminating to me and I
don't like to be selfish, so I am go
ing to throw out a little light to tl.<»
rest of Stanford ;uid quote a trench
ant. paragraph
"We ar<?Hold tftat we must im
pose—impose mind you, the 'four
freedoms' on the entire world. We
must die if necessary to impose
freedom of speech in India, even
though we are not free to speak
against our mad administration
here at home. We must die to im
pose freedom of religion in Rus
sia but must submit our own
churches to the unbelievable dis
grace of 'canned sermons' and 'out
of bounds' restrictions. We must
die to impose freedom from fear
in France, when on all sides we
see our friends afraid to speak for
what they know to be right and
reasonable . .
Mr. Fallon, I don't want to be un
kind. I will just leave that glorious
blaze of light shining in the eyes of
Stanford—l hope the glare won't be
too much for us.
But I would like to ask you a
few questions, Mr. Fallon. If "wc
are not free to speak against our
mad administration here at home"
then those must he orchids, not
brickbats, that you boys arc sling
ing at Mr. Roosevelt, yes?
If our churches are fettered b;
"canned sermons" and "out of boun<
restrictions," who let Father Cough
lin in? And if you, who know wha
is "right and reasonable," are afraii
to speak, why arc you so articulaU
and why don't you hush up?
| CAN stand just so much and then j
there comes a time when I am j
forced to drop the protective edi- ;
torial "we" and come out and fight j
all alone.
I didn't mind when that irate j
grad student, writing in Campi/;
Opinion told me to miss all my \
meals for a week; I didn't mind
when Mr. Hoovers' secretary, Miss
Dare Stark MacMullin, told me I
was a very superficial, very posi
tive young lady; I didn't mind
when every time I walked down
the Quad Colin McClintock
pointed an accusing finger at me
and roared, "You interventionist!'' ,
and I didn't even mind when the
linotypcr in the hack shop told me
I had the blood of a million Bel
gian hahies on my hands.
No, all those things were all right,
because I could always console my
self by remembering that my mother
thinks I am better than H. V. Kal
