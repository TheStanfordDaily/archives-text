to the waiting multitudes.
"Since not everyone wiil be lucky enough to get one of the free tickets,

will purvey smooth music for
dancing.
Collaborating with Englander in
supplying entertainment will be Lu
Walters and his Yerba Buena band.
Walters, who appears at the Dawn

Club in San Francisco, is famous for
his Dixieland rhythms. The latest
issue of Downbeat devotes several
pages to the work of his band.

i formal affair, which will last from 10
Ito 2 o'clock. All of its faciilties, in-
