# Farm Queens, Horse Big Guns in Gaieties
## 
### 
"Migawd, Tm having awful cards
tonight." This whs the statement
made by F. C. Burt, associate di
rector of the 11)41 Gaieties, when in
terviewee] last night on the condi
: tion of the show.
A. B. Wilson, director of the re
view and "the his boss' as his under
lings so fondly put it, was not
available for comment since he was
already putting last minute touches
on the show at four different places,
! simultaneously.
BURT RAVES ON
Having just been set five tricks,
I redoubled and vulnerable, Burt went
I on to discuss the show. "Immediate-

| ly after Friday night's performance
i A. B. will be open to offers for book
j elsewhere, and niter several
| m\embcr.s of tlie troupe see an ath
letic contest. Saturday afternoon, the
| entiire east will probably fly back to
j|' 1 Sti in, that's show talk for New
; \ .t, City, New York, f»»r a several
year.- engagement."
Bus t uave himself another hypo of
i opiun! before continuing. "VVc will
presei'vt the Farm audience with a
i review, that combines the extrava
ganzatlvity of Cahn with the whim
sicalit; of Bulotti with the subtle
. kom >l\ Muheim."
The acorn from which this gigantic I
oak of a show sprang was first de- ,
veloped in an artistic garret hidden
away in tho recesses of the basement
of one of the fraternity houses this
summer, where Wilson lived while
attending summer school.
Wilson and his roommate, a re
tiring little soul who has subse
quently disappeared, burned the
candles late in formulating the entire
show. Although none of their plans
are to be found in the show that is
now being rehearsed, it can be
truthfully said that there were the
beginnings of this great production.
Most recent addition to the al
ready packed-with-talent show is a
short bit by Lome Stanley, former
Gaieties star, now a graduate stu
dent. Stanley, accompanied by a
horse, will undoubtedly be very
funny.
An outstanding feature of the
show will be the songs, written en
tirely by budding campus Irving
Berlins. F. M. Seott-the-Third, mu
sical director for the show, stated
that if you had the intestinal forti
tude to sit through the opener, the
rest of the show would be well
worth your wasted three hours, not
to mention the 55-cent price of ad
mission.
B. G. Miller, another guy that
does a lot of work around the re
hearsals, as well as playing 15 dif
ferent parts, stated, between gags,
that 8<!.7 per cent of all the queens
on the campus would be seen in
the Gaieties.

"Migawd, Tm having awful cards
tonight." This whs the statement
made by F. C. Burt, associate di
rector of the 11)41 Gaieties, when in
terviewee] last night on the condi
: tion of the show.
A. B. Wilson, director of the re
view and "the his boss' as his under
lings so fondly put it, was not
available for comment since he was
already putting last minute touches
on the show at four different places,
! simultaneously.
BURT RAVES ON
Having just been set five tricks,
I redoubled and vulnerable, Burt went
I on to discuss the show. "Immediate-

| ly after Friday night's performance
i A. B. will be open to offers for book
j elsewhere, and niter several
| m\embcr.s of tlie troupe see an ath
letic contest. Saturday afternoon, the
| entiire east will probably fly back to
j|' 1 Sti in, that's show talk for New
; \ .t, City, New York, f»»r a several
year.- engagement."
Bus t uave himself another hypo of
i opiun! before continuing. "VVc will
presei'vt the Farm audience with a
i review, that combines the extrava
ganzatlvity of Cahn with the whim
sicalit; of Bulotti with the subtle
. kom >l\ Muheim."
The acorn from which this gigantic I
oak of a show sprang was first de- ,
veloped in an artistic garret hidden
away in tho recesses of the basement
of one of the fraternity houses this
summer, where Wilson lived while
attending summer school.
Wilson and his roommate, a re
tiring little soul who has subse
quently disappeared, burned the
candles late in formulating the entire
show. Although none of their plans
are to be found in the show that is
now being rehearsed, it can be
truthfully said that there were the
beginnings of this great production.
Most recent addition to the al
ready packed-with-talent show is a
short bit by Lome Stanley, former
Gaieties star, now a graduate stu
dent. Stanley, accompanied by a
horse, will undoubtedly be very
funny.
An outstanding feature of the
show will be the songs, written en
tirely by budding campus Irving
Berlins. F. M. Seott-the-Third, mu
sical director for the show, stated
that if you had the intestinal forti
tude to sit through the opener, the
rest of the show would be well
worth your wasted three hours, not
to mention the 55-cent price of ad
mission.
B. G. Miller, another guy that
does a lot of work around the re
hearsals, as well as playing 15 dif
ferent parts, stated, between gags,
that 8<!.7 per cent of all the queens
on the campus would be seen in
the Gaieties.
