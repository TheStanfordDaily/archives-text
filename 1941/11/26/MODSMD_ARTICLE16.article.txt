# Monteux To Speak At Forum
## 
### 
Pierre Monteux, conductor of the
San Francisco Symphony orchestra,
will be the guest of Stanford next
Wednesday evening, Dec. 3, at 7:30
o'clock when the Stanford Sym
phony Forum holds its initial meet
ing at the Delta Gamma house.
Mr. Monteux is the first in a series
of artists and critics who have con
sented to give of their time and en
ergies in addressing the students of
Stanford at meetings of the Sym- !
phony Forum. These meetings are
open to the campus as a whole, and
380 students who purchased season
tickets to the symphony are espe
cially invited.
The Forum meetings are sched- ,
uled for Wednesday or Thursday
evening before almost all of the 12 j
concerts, and they are to be held in
a fraternity or sorority house. The
meetings will last no later than 9
p.m., and they will regularly pre
sent the artists who will appear
with the symphony the following
Saturday. In addition, noted critics
will discuss the music to be played
or related topics which the Forum
will decide upon.
The idea of a Symphony Forum is
entirely Stanford's and was first
advanced by Bill Balkan, '38. The
idea has become an actuality through
the enthusiasm and co-operation of
the San Francisco Symphony Asso
ciation under Mrs. Leonora Armsby,
president, and Howard Skinner,
manager.
Knowing that a considerable finan
cial loss would result, they never
theless offered to the students the
finest tickets available for a little
more than one-half the popular
i price. The result is that 700 Stanford
and California students have taken
seats for the season —Stanford in the
j majority.
The Stanford Symphony Forum is
strictly an academic organization,
the main object being to bring the
| best in music to Stanford without
1 restrictions and limitations.

Mr. Monteux is the first in a series
of artists and critics who have con
sented to give of their time and en
ergies in addressing the students of
Stanford at meetings of the Sym- !
phony Forum. These meetings are
open to the campus as a whole, and
380 students who purchased season
tickets to the symphony are espe
cially invited.
The Forum meetings are sched- ,
uled for Wednesday or Thursday
evening before almost all of the 12 j
concerts, and they are to be held in
a fraternity or sorority house. The
meetings will last no later than 9
p.m., and they will regularly pre
sent the artists who will appear
with the symphony the following
Saturday. In addition, noted critics
will discuss the music to be played
or related topics which the Forum
will decide upon.
The idea of a Symphony Forum is
entirely Stanford's and was first
advanced by Bill Balkan, '38. The
idea has become an actuality through
the enthusiasm and co-operation of
the San Francisco Symphony Asso
ciation under Mrs. Leonora Armsby,
president, and Howard Skinner,
manager.
Knowing that a considerable finan
cial loss would result, they never
theless offered to the students the
finest tickets available for a little
more than one-half the popular
i price. The result is that 700 Stanford
and California students have taken
seats for the season —Stanford in the
j majority.
The Stanford Symphony Forum is
strictly an academic organization,
the main object being to bring the
| best in music to Stanford without
1 restrictions and limitations.
