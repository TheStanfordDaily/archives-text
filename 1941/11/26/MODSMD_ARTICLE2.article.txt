# Nazis Imperil Moscow As Libyan Drive Slows
## Blitz 18 Miles Away, Germans Say; U.S. Attacks Finland as Axis Tool 
### United Press 
Moscow faced its greatest peril Tuesday since its capture by Napoleon
12!) years ago. Far south of Moscow a big Soviet offensive routed the Ger
inans and advanced 5)3 miles in the war on the Eastern front.
In Libya, British imperial forccs and Axis armies were locked in
furious battle, with the issue still in doubt.

One Nazi report, broadcast by the.,
Ankara radio, claimed the Germans
were within 18% miles of Moscow
northwest of the city. The Kremlin
itself broadcast that the battle for
Moscow had reached a decisive
stage, with German advances south
and northwest of the city continu
ing through a storm of Soviet fire.
FROM THE FRONTS:
Developments in brief on the two
war fronts included:
1. German spearheads smashed
deeper into Moscow's defenses
around Klin, 51 miles northwest,
and Tula, 110 miles south, the Rus
sians admitted. (The Germans al
ready had claimed Solnechnogorsk,
31 miles northwest of Moscow.)
The big Soviet advance reported
was northwest of Rostov. Tass said
the advance approximated 37 miles
on a broad front and in some sectors
reached 93 miles.
AXIS CHECKS BRITAIN
2. It begain to appear that in
Lybia Axis resistance had definitely
checked the momentum of the Brit
ish attack â€” except for an Indian
"phantom column" knifing westward
through the desert far south of the
main armies. The main foi'ces were
almost stationary. North of this
fateful battlefield, along the coast,
another British column fought its
way westward against considerable
opposition. There was a possibility
it might reach Tobruk in time to
join forces with the garrison there
and exert a decisive effect on the
main battle.
