Going from the "Rumba Cardi" j
to the "Blue Danube" to "The. Waltz
You Saved for Me," the juke box
in the Union Cellar has been kept
busy playing one after the other for
the happy Stanford couples who are
' now able to mix their daily cokes !
and potato chips with a little danc- j
ing on the side,
"The success of the idea seems to
be assured," Miss Atkinson, director j
of the Cellar, said happily, "'the stu- '
dents are enjoying it, although they
still are a little surprised about the
j whole plan."
"Stanford is one of the last colleges
to allow dancing in the Union. Most
| of them have a regular space and
time set aside for dancing, and many
; of them have orchestras for certain
j days."
But "Cellar Heaven," as the Un
ion is now renamed, has hit one
snag. An old University regulation
; states that there is to be no dancing
on the campus after 8 o'clock on
| week nights.
And so, unfortunately, the danc
i ing will have to be confined to after
noon hours. But even this to the
students is a big step in the right
| direction, according to several who
| were interviewed.
The dancing begins every after
noon at 2 o'clock and lasts until 5
; o'clock. Sorry, nothing stronger
than coca cola or orange frosts are
I served.
See you at the dance this after
!noon!
