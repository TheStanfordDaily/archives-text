WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 (UP).—
The United States today intensified |
efforts to induce Finland to end her
war against Russia with a twin-bar- j
relied blast accusing the small Baltic
nation of jeopardizing American I
war air by serving as a tool for the
German military machine.
The renewed attack was voiced by
Secretary of War Henry L. Stim
son and Maj. Gen. James H. Burns,
lend-lease official and member of j
the U.S. mission to Moscow, as Adolf i
Hitler marshalled representatives of j
VA Axis and Axis-dominated states
in Bei'.in to sign a new anti-comin- ;
tern agreement. Trnland was one of
the signatories.
Stimson charged thai* F\..».iish
army co-operation with German |
troops in the northern theater of the
Russian war was enabling the Gcr- j
mans to concentrate their forces in |
that sector on constant attacks on ■
the Mursmansk-Moscow supply line !
over which American lend-lease and !
British war aid is moving to the be- ,
lcaguered Russian capital.
