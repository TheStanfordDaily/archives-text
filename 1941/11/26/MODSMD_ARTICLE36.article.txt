IF WHAT appears in the San Francisco newspapers is any indication,
Stanford is indeed in a bad way for the Big Game.
Pete Kmetovic, the boy who is said to be the cog that makes the Model
T function, isn't in the best of condition. That has been known since the
Washington State game. It was believed up until this week, however,
that the speed merchant with the here-it-is-now-it-ain't leg movement
would be able to go against the Bears. Bjut now it is beginning to appear
doubtful that Kmet will be of great value Saturday.
The new angles that caused the sudden furor are: (1) Milt Vucinich's
sprained ankle, which, although it was not thought serious at the time
cf injury last Saturday, has failed to respond to treatment; and (2) the
general team attitude.
An ankle sprain is something material and understandable. But the
team attitude is something else again. It may be understandable, but it
certainly isn't material. Speaking to the press in San Francisco Monday,

Marchie Schwartz said that the Stan
ford players are not "high" for the
Big Game.
That is something that is much
tougher to combat than an ankle
injury. Yet we have a feeling that
Stanford will not trot out onto the
turf in the Stanford Stadium Sat
urday without that surging spirit
that makes the Big Game what it
is—the titanic football contest of
the Pacific Coast.
Reports emanating from Berkeley
are to the effect that the Golden
Bears are in tip-top shape, both
physically and mentally. Contrasting
this from (he reports on Stanford,
it is hard to figure out why, if ev
erything said about (he teams is
true, why the belting odds are quot
ed at 2'a to 1.
As a matter of fact, the odds are
a little off key, but that can be said
almost every week during the foot
ball season.
As we see it, however, the team
altitude is NOT poor. Fellows like

P rankie Albert, Milt Vucinich, Eric Armstrong, Chuck Taylor and all the
rest who have been around Stanford for a few years couldn't go into the
Big Game ieeling that it was just another football game and probably
not too touch a game at that. It just isn't human nature.
Maybe Peter (I. Kmctovic isn't his old self. Maybe Milton C. Vuci
nich is bothered a lot by the ankle injury. But we're counting on see
ing a Stanford team with a world of spirit, a Stanford team in pretty
fair physical shape, show up to play California Saturday.

From Vincent J. Akrop at Camp Roberts comes a postal telling us
that we were all wet in picking Freddie Meyer over Alyn Beals as an
cilf-coast end, basing his opinion on the fact that Santa Clara's great end
scored so many points this season. For him it's Susoeff and Beals. For us
it's still Susoeff and Meyer, although we'll say again that Beals is far
and away the most sensational of the three.

As a matter of fact, the odds are

As we see it, however, the team
altitude is NOT poor. Fellows like

P rankie Albert, Milt Vucinich, Eric Armstrong, Chuck Taylor and all the
rest who have been around Stanford for a few years couldn't go into the
Big Game ieeling that it was just another football game and probably
not too touch a game at that. It just isn't human nature.
Maybe Peter (I. Kmctovic isn't his old self. Maybe Milton C. Vuci

From Vincent J. Akrop at Camp Roberts comes a postal telling us
that we were all wet in picking Freddie Meyer over Alyn Beals as an
cilf-coast end, basing his opinion on the fact that Santa Clara's great end
scored so many points this season. For him it's Susoeff and Beals. For us
it's still Susoeff and Meyer, although we'll say again that Beals is far
and away the most sensational of the three.


MILT VUCINICH
IF WHAT appears in the San Francisco newspapers is any indication,
Stanford is indeed in a bad way for the Big Game.
Pete Kmetovic, the boy who is said to be the cog that makes the Model
T function, isn't in the best of condition. That has been known since the
Washington State game. It was believed up until this week, however,
that the speed merchant with the here-it-is-now-it-ain't leg movement
would be able to go against the Bears. Bjut now it is beginning to appear
doubtful that Kmet will be of great value Saturday.
The new angles that caused the sudden furor are: (1) Milt Vucinich's
sprained ankle, which, although it was not thought serious at the time
cf injury last Saturday, has failed to respond to treatment; and (2) the
general team attitude.
An ankle sprain is something material and understandable. But the
team attitude is something else again. It may be understandable, but it
certainly isn't material. Speaking to the press in San Francisco Monday,

Marchie Schwartz said that the Stan
ford players are not "high" for the
Big Game.
That is something that is much
tougher to combat than an ankle
injury. Yet we have a feeling that
Stanford will not trot out onto the
turf in the Stanford Stadium Sat
urday without that surging spirit
that makes the Big Game what it
is—the titanic football contest of
the Pacific Coast.
Reports emanating from Berkeley
are to the effect that the Golden
Bears are in tip-top shape, both
physically and mentally. Contrasting
this from (he reports on Stanford,
it is hard to figure out why, if ev
erything said about (he teams is
