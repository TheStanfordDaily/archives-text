# Rough Scrimmage Points Toward Big Game Fracas
## 
### 
The boys got rough yesterday afternoon for the first time since mid-
September.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy in an effort to perfect the Indians' timing
kdternatcd the first two teams against a team made up of reserves and
freshmen in a body-contact drill.

Missing from a large part of this
I workout were four men who are
considered first stringers. Pete
Kmetovic was still nursing a groin
injury, Milt Vucinich, although in
suit, was limping on a sore ankle,
Bruno Banducci suffered a minor
recurrence of an old leg injury, and
Freddie Meyer rested a stone
bruised heel.
Working with Frankie Albert in
the backfield as the regulars poured
the power on Ihe frosh, were Buck
Fawcett, Bob Crane, and Willard
Sheller. The second-string outfit
under Al Cole's quarterbacking had
Bob Mitchell, Ben Morrison, and
Hoot Armstrong behind the line.
McCain steps in
Ed McCain took up where Ban
ducci left off at right tackle, and
Bob Mastin filled in for Meyer at
right end. Chuck Taylor, Loren La-
Prade, Vic Lindskog, Ed Stamm, and
Arnie Meiners were in their regu
lar places. Hank Norberg alternated
with Meiners, who has a broken
finger.
Ken Robesky returned to the line
up at left guard on the second team,
after his father passed away last
week-end in the South. With him in
the second-string line were Jack
Francis, Doug Stahle, Jim Cox, and
Bill Mannon. Bill Symes, Jack
Smith, Rog Laverty, and Henry Hege
alternated at the ends.
Sad tidings from across the Bay
announce that the entire Bear team
will be rarin' to go when they in
vade the stadium Saturday. How
ever, Stanfordites won't forget the
32 to 14 score the last time they
played here.

September.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy in an effort to perfect the Indians' timing
kdternatcd the first two teams against a team made up of reserves and
freshmen in a body-contact drill.

Missing from a large part of this
I workout were four men who are
considered first stringers. Pete
Kmetovic was still nursing a groin
injury, Milt Vucinich, although in
suit, was limping on a sore ankle,
Bruno Banducci suffered a minor
recurrence of an old leg injury, and
Freddie Meyer rested a stone
bruised heel.
Working with Frankie Albert in
the backfield as the regulars poured
the power on Ihe frosh, were Buck
Fawcett, Bob Crane, and Willard
Sheller. The second-string outfit
under Al Cole's quarterbacking had
Bob Mitchell, Ben Morrison, and
Hoot Armstrong behind the line.
McCain steps in
Ed McCain took up where Ban
ducci left off at right tackle, and
Bob Mastin filled in for Meyer at
right end. Chuck Taylor, Loren La-
Prade, Vic Lindskog, Ed Stamm, and
Arnie Meiners were in their regu
lar places. Hank Norberg alternated
with Meiners, who has a broken
finger.
Ken Robesky returned to the line
up at left guard on the second team,
after his father passed away last
week-end in the South. With him in
the second-string line were Jack
Francis, Doug Stahle, Jim Cox, and
Bill Mannon. Bill Symes, Jack
Smith, Rog Laverty, and Henry Hege
alternated at the ends.
Sad tidings from across the Bay
announce that the entire Bear team
will be rarin' to go when they in
vade the stadium Saturday. How
ever, Stanfordites won't forget the
32 to 14 score the last time they
played here.
