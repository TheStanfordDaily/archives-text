## 
### 
Denny Shute, traveling represen
tative of a national department
store, plays an exhibition match here
this afternoon with Stanford's Bud
Brownell and Warren Berl.
The match will start at
Brownell, runner-up in the col
legiates, and Berl, who accomplished
the same feat three years ago, will
get a taste of the quality of golf
played by the big-time profession
als, which should help determine
just how good Stanford's two top
golfers are.
Brownell ir probably the top ama
teur in the state now with the ex
ception of Ernie Pieper. Berl, no
longer eligible for Eddie Twiggs'
team, is still one of ihc top men on
the famous Stanford course.
Shute is the veteran campaigner
who has played for years with the
best players in the game, Cooper,
Snead, Smith and many others.
