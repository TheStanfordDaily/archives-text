# Water Poloists, Minus Mitchell, Prep for Cal
## 
### 
With Captain Frank Mitchell still
somewhat of an unknown quantity,
Coach Norton Thornton's varsity
water polo team scrimmaged yes
terday in preparation for their all -
important game Thursday after
noon against California.
Mitchell, all-conference guard last
year, has been bothered with a cold
for the last two weeks and hasn't
been able to practice for almost a
week. He is still listed in the start
ing line-up, however.
Stanford has everything to gain
Thursday against their traditional
rivals from across the bay. A win
not only would give them their first
sweep of the series in seven years
but also undisputed possession of
second place in conference stand
ings. They are deadlocked with
U.S.C. for second position at the
present time.
The Indians' previous 7 to 4 win
over the Bears has already been be
littled in The Daily Californian with
Al Dowden, California coach, quoted
as saying that California deserved t;i
win the initial fracas.
' The tying up of the boys in cru
cial moments, and the lack of
ability to shoot" lost the game for
California, according to Coach
Dowden. Stanford's vigilant back
field of Bob Jones, Jack Bleecker,
Mitchell and Goalie Ed Smith held
John Norris, ace Bear forward,
scoreless throughout most of the
affair.
Calvin Davis of Sheridan, Wyo.,
won his first law case at the age
of 14.
