# Stand Up and Cheer
## 
### 
"P)EOPLE in other parts of the country have
IT always thought that Stanford has an inde
scribable something that makes it a good school.
When you ask them what it is they don't know.
It isn't just the scholastic standing, the brilliant
athletic history, the fine educators connected
with the institution, or the research that is car
ried on. It is just some vague spirit associated
with the name Stanford.
It has something to do with the way Stanford
fought its way out of early hardships, everything
from lawsuits to earthguakes, to its high position
in such a short time. It came to be accepted that
Stanford men had great spirit.
And when some people in the East and
Middle West heard that the student body was
losing interest in football two years ago just
because they were given only three Rose Bowl
teams in six years, they began to wonder.
But these people still believe that Stanford is
true to its fighting heritage. It takes a while for
things to get back there and the people don't
know yet that a person who stands up to cheer
his team is pulled down from behind and threat
ened.
Old-timers tell us of the old days of the Big
Game with Santa Clara. The boys used to stand
most of the game in those days even when there
was nothing like a Bowl depending on the out
come. If everyone in Stanford could talk to one
of these alumni about what the Big Game means
a tear would come to many an eye.
They are not sloppy with sentimentality; they
merely tell you that in the old days the school
meant more to the boys in it. Many of them
lived in what was known as the Camp, a col
lection of shacks in the heart of the campus.
They were the fightingest bunch of men on the
Peninsula (the Mission district included), and
they loved the school. When a team left for
Cal once in a horse-drawn vehicle, one of the
players said, "Let's take a turn around the
Quad."
In two decades this wonderful attitude turned
to that typified by the brother of a prominent
campus politician, who, when asked calmly last
year to put out his cigarette or to step off the
Quad, said, "Don't be childish." This person is
"modern," "progressive," and "democratic."
When he goes to a football game he pulls down
the man in front of him who is standing up to
cheer, he puts his fingers in his ears to protect
himself from the man in back of him, and saves
himself for the Axe yell, if it ever comes.
It is a wonderful thing that 100 per cent of the
section responds to the Axe yell. It is the one
thing that saves the Stanford spirit. ludging
from that opening of the second half of the
Washington State game, Stanford is coming out
of the spirit doldrums. This trend must be con
tinued. If the person next to you in the rooting
section is standing or making too much noise,
the solution is in trying to outdo him.

"P)EOPLE in other parts of the country have
IT always thought that Stanford has an inde
scribable something that makes it a good school.
When you ask them what it is they don't know.
It isn't just the scholastic standing, the brilliant
athletic history, the fine educators connected
with the institution, or the research that is car
ried on. It is just some vague spirit associated
with the name Stanford.
It has something to do with the way Stanford
fought its way out of early hardships, everything
from lawsuits to earthguakes, to its high position
in such a short time. It came to be accepted that
Stanford men had great spirit.
And when some people in the East and
Middle West heard that the student body was
losing interest in football two years ago just
because they were given only three Rose Bowl
teams in six years, they began to wonder.
But these people still believe that Stanford is
true to its fighting heritage. It takes a while for
things to get back there and the people don't
know yet that a person who stands up to cheer
his team is pulled down from behind and threat
ened.
Old-timers tell us of the old days of the Big
Game with Santa Clara. The boys used to stand
most of the game in those days even when there
was nothing like a Bowl depending on the out
come. If everyone in Stanford could talk to one
of these alumni about what the Big Game means
a tear would come to many an eye.
They are not sloppy with sentimentality; they
merely tell you that in the old days the school
meant more to the boys in it. Many of them
lived in what was known as the Camp, a col
lection of shacks in the heart of the campus.
They were the fightingest bunch of men on the
Peninsula (the Mission district included), and
they loved the school. When a team left for
Cal once in a horse-drawn vehicle, one of the
players said, "Let's take a turn around the
Quad."
In two decades this wonderful attitude turned
to that typified by the brother of a prominent
campus politician, who, when asked calmly last
year to put out his cigarette or to step off the
Quad, said, "Don't be childish." This person is
"modern," "progressive," and "democratic."
When he goes to a football game he pulls down
the man in front of him who is standing up to
cheer, he puts his fingers in his ears to protect
himself from the man in back of him, and saves
himself for the Axe yell, if it ever comes.
It is a wonderful thing that 100 per cent of the
section responds to the Axe yell. It is the one
thing that saves the Stanford spirit. ludging
