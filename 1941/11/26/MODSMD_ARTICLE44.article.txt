SEVERAL weeks ago Executive Committee
drew a gentle protective covering over the
dozing dog of the caucus system. Previously
they had attempted a thorough and systematic
inspection of the animal. It had been suggested
that primaries might alleviate the recognized
evils of the caucus. But Excom's sub-committee
decided that the cure would be worse than the
disease, and the whole matter was dropped.
Although tfyey found no panacea for faults in
the election system and, therefore, could take
no constructive action, Committee members rec
ognized the need for improvements.
At last night's meeting a suggestion was made
which shows promise of bettering the system.
It was proposed that the nomination and elec
tion procedures, which now spread out over
seven days, be telescoped into a three day pe
riod. This compression would leave no time

for the leisurely political swappings which have
so often confused the swappers, the candidates
and, worst of all, the campus.
The proposal schedules nominations on Mon
day, assembly and declinations on Tuesday,
actual voting on Wednesday. This procedure,
clipped as it is, would make an A.S.S.U. elec
tion a business-like matter, instead of the ex
tended, often politically odorous, caucus festi
val which it has been in the past.
Ex Committee's sub-committee on elections
will function again this week. At next Tuesday's
meeting the Committee will take definite action
on the new proposal.
It may be that the time has come for the rous
