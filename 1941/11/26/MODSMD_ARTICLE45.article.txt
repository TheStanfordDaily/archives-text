THE RAIDS ARE OUT
JJT IS just about this time every year that students
from Stanford and California get so excited about
the Big Game that they temporarily lose control of
themselves and act like little, spoiled, destructive
children. They think it time to start breaking things,
time to start painting things up, time to call each other
names and fight and in general to act quite like idiots.
It is usually the freshmen who do the raiding, but
only because they have been taught that such action
during Big Game week is traditional and in line with
school spirit and completely tolerated. It seems that
every year the frosh are just full of stories of what
dad and big brother and cousin Tom did when they
were freshmen. We strongly suspect that most of such
stories are lies. Older people don't like to think that
anyone can do the things they did in their childhood
and are inclined to pour it on in telling of their youth.
But whatever the cause may be, every year freshmen
cpme in with these distorted ideas of what is tradi
tional and what is right and what is expected during
Big Game week.

r STRAIGHTEN this matter of inter-school raids
once and for all, a meeting was held in Encina
the other evening. Ralph Thompson and his brother
sponsors herded the frosh into the lobby and they were
told by no less a dignitary than our own popular
president, Stonewall Jackson. Stonewall told them that
we neither expected nor wanted them to go to Cali
forina and be traditional by fighting and breaking and
painting and so forth. And Stonewall added that any
one caught at California would be expelled for the
quarter. Stonewall told them and they understood.
And as if Stonewall's words weren't impressive
enough, the serious, dignified head of Men's Council,
Stanley Owen, was called on and he told them that it
was the duty of Men's Council to expel anyone found
raiding around California.

A ND so the frosh were told. They have no alibi if
j they persist in raiding. If they are caugfit there
won't even be an argument. And they will have no
! right to hang their heads and curse the administra
tion and act like martyrs, who were sacrificed for a
worthy cause. They know there can't be any raids.
All this may sound like the administration is rul
ing out the romance, the school spirit that is usually
attendant during this week. I don't think so. There's
no school spirit connected with destroying property.
Just think of pushing over the Campanile and then
saying, "I guess that proves I'm for Stanford and
against California." Such wild action has nothing to
do with school spirit. And there is nothing romantic
about the injuries that are always the result of such
emotional, animal action. For we have had one lesson
already this year of what can happen when students
are turned loose in gangs.
We don't, need such spirit. We don't need such costly
romance. We can have enough fun during Big Game
week without such nonsense. So frosh, stay away
from Cal and start a new, sensible tradition of your
own.
