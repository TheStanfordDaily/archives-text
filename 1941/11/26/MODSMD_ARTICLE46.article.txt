## POOR HORACE 
### 
TPHE EDITOR, SIR:
If you think my answer might, in some way, help
to save poor Horace Figgins from the torment of the
damned, please print it.
Horace, my dear, dear Horace:
You poor misguided boy. I wish I could call you
a man, for you are a senior and are soon going to be
thrust out into the cold, cruel world. But alas, man
hood has passed you by. This is shown by your lack,
yes, dear boy, your absolute lack, of insight.
Now, Horace, I want you to try and look at this
situation objectively, though I realize it will be hard,
as this sad disillusionment which you have been la
boring under for the unbelievably long time of over
three years, has undoubtedly affected your person
ality. Please try, though, because I don't want you to
face this world with a perverted impression of the
Stanford woman.
First, I want to thank you for saying that Stan
ford women are witty, even the freshmen. I'll admit
it is trying at times; it takes a lot of clear and fast
thinking to keep a conversation with a Stanford
"rough" impersonal. We pride ourselves on our ability
to do this. It's our greatest defense weapon.
I have never known a Stanford woman to shrink
from a casual friendly glance. On the contrary, it
encourages her. You know, we're inately shy, and it
takes a good healthy platonic look to entice us out
of our shells. We're still slightly Victorian, too (you
may not believe it, but think it over) and for this
reason we are wary of any action which might infer
the qucstionability of our character. Perhaps this ex
plains why your "neutral and passive" glances were
not accepted in the spirit in which you "obviously"
sent them. Dear Horace, I fear your crusade to have
Stanford women wear seven veils over their usual
clothes will be one which will not gain much support
from other Stanford men. Do you ever study at the
boathouse during Spring Quarter? Oh, even you don't
study.!
Twice you said we were insincere. Maybe it was
a misprint. Nevertheless, one would have been enough
to make me condemn you as a pessimist. Can you
truly believe that all Stanford women are always
playing a game, always willing to throw over old ideals
and friends as soon as something new and more prom
ising appears on the horizon? For your sake, I hope
not, for such pessimism would materially hinder you
in later life.
I cannot refute your statis'ics on marriages between
Stanford men and women, f(*r I don't know, but did
it. ever occur to you that maybe the girl shook her
head the wrong way?
Though I doubt if I'll ever get to Heaven, you
probably will, for outside of this one misapprehen
sion, I can sense that you are truly a noble "charac
ter." Dear boy, don't disappoint rue, I'd hate to meet
you in Purgatory.
Hopefully,^
Hope Fully
