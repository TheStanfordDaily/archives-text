# Shaughnessy Paints Gloomy Picture of Big Game Chances
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
'"We're really up against it," de
clared Coach Clark Shaughnessy,
"the team is not in good shape and
we've got a bruising game to play
against California this Saturday."
Coach Shaughnessy spoke to more
than 200 students at the Branner
Big Game Smoker last night in
Branner dining hall.
"I've never seen so many injur- j
ies," complained Shaughnessy. "I !
don't think we've scrimmaged since j
September and yet we've had many
more injuries than last year."
VOOS IN BAD SHAPE
Shaughnessy said that Kmetovic
was only a probable starter in the
Big Game, and Milt Vucinich, hard
driving fullback, had a badly sprain
ed ankle and was probably out of
the game.
"And we were counting upon Vu
cinich to carry the main load," said
Shaughnessy.
Comparing this years' team to the
undefeated 1940 Rose Bowl cham
pions, Shaughnessy said the 1941
eleven had turned in a better job
considering the handicaps under
which it had played.
INJURIES TO KEY MEN
"We wouldn't have lost any games
this year if we had not suffered in
juries to key players," said Shaugh
nessy.
Asked about Oregon's chances of
beating Oregon State in their game
Saturday, Shaughnessy said Oregon I
should win if the Ducks had come |
out of last week's Washington game
in good condition.
"And I don't know what condition
they are in," commented Shaugh- j
nessy, "but Washington plays a l
hard bruising game."
MORRISON TALKS
Morey Morrison, sports columnist
and illustrator for the San Francisco !
Chronicle, followed Shaughnessy on j
the program. Morrison sketched
players and diagrams of the Califor
nia and Stanford defenses for the j
audience.
"Stanford has a hell of a better :
ball team than the days when I went
here," said Morrison, who graduated
in 1926.
Ernie Smith, sports broadcaster
and editor of "The Sports Page of
the Air," kept the crowd amused :
with humorous anecdotes of the ra
dio profession.
GOOD LUCK'—SMITH
"Good luck to you on Saturday," |
shouted Smith as Coach Shaugh- |
nessy left early amid applause.
Smith forecast the Big Game with
a breathless imaginary broadcast '
which ended "with Fred Meyer tak
ing Albert's perfect pass in the end
zone to break a 7-7 tie in the last
30 seconds of play."
Patty Bouchard, vocal star of the
Gaieties, previewed "Body by
Fisher," one of the musical show's j
leading songs.
Charles Bull, editor of The Stan- ,
ford Daily, acted as master of cere
monies and introduced the speakers, j
Jerry Stoner, Branner Hall presi- j
dent, was in charge of the smoker, j
Refreshments were served in j
Branner lobby after the entertain
ment.

nessy, "but Washington plays a l
hard bruising game."
MORRISON TALKS
Morey Morrison, sports columnist
and illustrator for the San Francisco !
Chronicle, followed Shaughnessy on j
the program. Morrison sketched
players and diagrams of the Califor
nia and Stanford defenses for the j
audience.
"Stanford has a hell of a better :
ball team than the days when I went
here," said Morrison, who graduated
in 1926.
Ernie Smith, sports broadcaster
and editor of "The Sports Page of
the Air," kept the crowd amused :
with humorous anecdotes of the ra
dio profession.
GOOD LUCK'—SMITH
"Good luck to you on Saturday," |
shouted Smith as Coach Shaugh- |
nessy left early amid applause.
Smith forecast the Big Game with
a breathless imaginary broadcast '
which ended "with Fred Meyer tak
ing Albert's perfect pass in the end
zone to break a 7-7 tie in the last
30 seconds of play."
Patty Bouchard, vocal star of the
Gaieties, previewed "Body by
Fisher," one of the musical show's j
leading songs.
Charles Bull, editor of The Stan- ,
ford Daily, acted as master of cere
monies and introduced the speakers, j
Jerry Stoner, Branner Hall presi- j
dent, was in charge of the smoker, j
Refreshments were served in j
Branner lobby after the entertain
ment.
'"We're really up against it," de
clared Coach Clark Shaughnessy,
"the team is not in good shape and
we've got a bruising game to play
against California this Saturday."
Coach Shaughnessy spoke to more
than 200 students at the Branner
Big Game Smoker last night in
Branner dining hall.
"I've never seen so many injur- j
ies," complained Shaughnessy. "I !
don't think we've scrimmaged since j
September and yet we've had many
more injuries than last year."
VOOS IN BAD SHAPE
Shaughnessy said that Kmetovic
was only a probable starter in the
Big Game, and Milt Vucinich, hard
driving fullback, had a badly sprain
ed ankle and was probably out of
the game.
"And we were counting upon Vu
cinich to carry the main load," said
Shaughnessy.
Comparing this years' team to the
undefeated 1940 Rose Bowl cham
pions, Shaughnessy said the 1941
eleven had turned in a better job
considering the handicaps under
which it had played.
INJURIES TO KEY MEN
"We wouldn't have lost any games
this year if we had not suffered in
juries to key players," said Shaugh
nessy.
Asked about Oregon's chances of
beating Oregon State in their game
Saturday, Shaughnessy said Oregon I
should win if the Ducks had come |
out of last week's Washington game
in good condition.
"And I don't know what condition
they are in," commented Shaugh- j
nessy, "but Washington plays a l
hard bruising game."
