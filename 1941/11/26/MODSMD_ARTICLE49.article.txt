# Largest Crowd Attends Series
## Petzoldt Film Shows Record Peak Ascent By JANE GLASSON 
### 
Paul Petzoldt's colored motion pic
ture, "Five Miles High," last night
took the season's largest Tuesday
Series audience from the fabled Vale
of Kashmir across deep gorges, arid
deserts and snowy mountain ranges
on to the glacier-crested K2, deep
in the Himalayas, second highest
mountain in the world.
At temperatures below zero and
at an altitude of 20,000 feet, high
est point on the earth's surface ever
reached by man, Mr. Petzoldt's cam
era recorded the perilous ascent of
five intrepid young American Al
pinists up the ice-coated sides of the
most difficult of all mountains to
climb and caught appealing side
lights of camp life as well as the
awe-inspiring grandeur of the tow
ering Himalayas.
ACROBATIC CLIMBING
Tlie party was forced to do acro
batic climbing at an altitude which
is almost impossible to live in, since
an average person faints from lack
of oxygen at 14,000 feet.
They made the ascent 1,000 feet
at a time, camping for almost a week
between climbs to accustom their
bodies to the change in air pressure,
which was, at the highest point they
reached, only 4 pounds a square inch
instead of the average 14,
"Before we started we knew the
chances of coming out alive were
50-50," Mr. Petzoldt said, "and the
details of preparation meant life or
death."
He showed some of the equipment
they used on the climb, which in
cluded shoes permeated with whale
oil to keep them from freezing, and
lined with asbestos.
PURE WHITE RACE
On the 350-mile trek from the last
automobile road to the 50-mile-wide
Baltoro glacier at the foot of K2,
Mr. Petzoldt photographed the civili
zation of the last pure white race
in the world, untouched by invasions.
In the rock-filled canyons, void of
any vegetation, these people built
terraces, by leveling out rocks and
carrying soil several miles from
river beds, on which grow barley and
apricot tiees, their only food.
Mr. Petzoldt said that when asked
why he continually risked his life,
his only answer was "the Anglo-
Saxon spirit of wanting to know
what's on the other side of the
mountain."
This was the final program of the
Tuesday Series for autumn quarter.
They will be resumed on Jan. 6.

any vegetation, these people built
terraces, by leveling out rocks and
carrying soil several miles from
river beds, on which grow barley and
apricot tiees, their only food.
Mr. Petzoldt said that when asked
why he continually risked his life,
his only answer was "the Anglo-
Saxon spirit of wanting to know
what's on the other side of the
mountain."
This was the final program of the
Tuesday Series for autumn quarter.
They will be resumed on Jan. 6.
Paul Petzoldt's colored motion pic
ture, "Five Miles High," last night
took the season's largest Tuesday
Series audience from the fabled Vale
of Kashmir across deep gorges, arid
deserts and snowy mountain ranges
on to the glacier-crested K2, deep
in the Himalayas, second highest
mountain in the world.
At temperatures below zero and
at an altitude of 20,000 feet, high
est point on the earth's surface ever
reached by man, Mr. Petzoldt's cam
era recorded the perilous ascent of
five intrepid young American Al
pinists up the ice-coated sides of the
most difficult of all mountains to
climb and caught appealing side
lights of camp life as well as the
awe-inspiring grandeur of the tow
ering Himalayas.
ACROBATIC CLIMBING
Tlie party was forced to do acro
batic climbing at an altitude which
is almost impossible to live in, since
an average person faints from lack
of oxygen at 14,000 feet.
They made the ascent 1,000 feet
at a time, camping for almost a week
between climbs to accustom their
bodies to the change in air pressure,
which was, at the highest point they
reached, only 4 pounds a square inch
instead of the average 14,
"Before we started we knew the
chances of coming out alive were
50-50," Mr. Petzoldt said, "and the
details of preparation meant life or
death."
He showed some of the equipment
they used on the climb, which in
cluded shoes permeated with whale
oil to keep them from freezing, and
lined with asbestos.
PURE WHITE RACE
On the 350-mile trek from the last
automobile road to the 50-mile-wide
Baltoro glacier at the foot of K2,
Mr. Petzoldt photographed the civili
zation of the last pure white race
in the world, untouched by invasions.
In the rock-filled canyons, void of
any vegetation, these people built
terraces, by leveling out rocks and
carrying soil several miles from
river beds, on which grow barley and
apricot tiees, their only food.
