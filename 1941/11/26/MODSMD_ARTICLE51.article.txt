"INSIDE LATIN AMERICA," by
John Gunthcr. (Harper & Brothers.)
John Gunther is a newspaper man. |
As such he realizes that people want j
to know something about the world,
at least most people do. And he
knows that they don't want to wade
through a stack of statistics on wheat
exports, numbers of men killed in
each revolution, etc., in order to get
an idea of what is going on.
A couple of years ago, Gunther's
"Inside Europe" started of! a series
of remarkable journalistic exploits
that led him to all the countries of
Europe and Asia, where he talked
to rulers and subjects alike. Now he
has taken an extended, though
somewhat hurried, circuit of Latin !
America.
TIMELY, EASY TO READ
With his apparently solid back
ground of history, and his keen in
sight, Gunther has written his latest
book, "Inside Latin America," in a
style that is very pleasant, to a busy
American trying to catch up on
what is happening around him. "In
side Latin America," which went to
press in September, is up-to-the
minute, easy-to-read, and wonder
fully informal.
Gunther picks out the events that
mean something, pictures the per
sonalities and powers that he thinks
are pertinent, and brings in just
enough history and statistics to show
you what the situation is.
U.S. RELATIONSHIPS
What is even more important he
takes each country in its relation to
our own; he shows just how each fits
into the world and the hemisphere
by discussing the activity of each in
connection with anti-Fifth Column
measures and moves toward hem
ispheric solidarity.
With these three books of his, John
Gunther has all but educated his
American readers on affairs of the
world. Unlike the ordinary reporter
or investigator, Gunther offers
plausible solutions to the problems
of the Americas in his latest books.
His very definite stand on what
should be done by the United States
gives the book added force ' and
meaning.â€”Everett
