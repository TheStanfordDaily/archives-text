# Finns Desire Soviet Peace, Says Holsti
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Finland is anxious to conclude a i
peace with Soviet Russia as soon as j
it has adequate guarantees that Rus- i
sian armies will not invade it for a
fourth time, stated Dr. Rudolf Holsti,
former Finnish foreign minister, and
at present, political science lecturer
at Stanford, in an interview last
night.
In commenting upon the "jeopard
izing of American war aims" accu- j
sations which Secretary of State !
Cordell Hull and Maj. Gen. James H. j
Burns yesterday hurled at the little I
j Baltic state (see column to left) Dr. J
; Holsti emphasized the fact that he |
( was not on a diplomatic mission, and
I did not have "access to government !
I information."
FINN DIET TO MEET
Dr. Holsti said that the Finnish j
Diet will aieet in open session to j
j discuss the <jp»>Qrnment's foreign i
policy this week, a.id hat perhaps .
some clarification of t>.. tangled \
| U.S.-Russ-Finn relations might j
i come from the meeting. He c-|^ cc j |
| that "it is the attitude of the i->t j
! which counts."
Turning to a discussion of military
j operations, the Finnish statesman
1 pointed out that the Soviets still
occupy Haanko, Finland s most stra
tegic naval base, and several strate
gic islands in the Gulf of Finland, I
Leningrad lies at the narrow end of J
this gulf.
Finnish occupation of Russian
territory along the Murmansk-Mos
cow railroad has been made neces- I
sary as a counter-action, he ex- I
plained, because since the Winter ;
War of 1939-40, the Russian govern
ment has constructed six railroads ;
leading from the Murmansk - Mos
cow trunk-line to the Finnish bor- |
der.
"As I understand it," Dr. Holsti ,
commented, "the Finnish govern- j
ment would be most anxious to '
conclude a peace when it is ado- '
quately assured that those railroads
will not be used for the purposes of
another invasion." The Finnish i
armies, he noted, have made no ef
fort to cross the old Finn-Russ bol -
der on the Karelian Isthmus.

"Assuming that we were to cap- 1
ture Leningrad, which I don't think
we want to do," he said, "we cer- >
lainly do not want the problem of
feeding the three million Russians ]
now under siege in the Moscow >
j sector."
Dr. Holsti said that he could haz
ard no guesses on what effect the in
creased American pressure for a !
j Russo-Finn peace would have upon
the future policy of the Finnish |
■government. By the same token, he
j could make no statement on Fin- ;
land's inclusion in Adolf Hitler's new
I anti-Commintern agreement.
HOPES FOR RESUMES
"I hope," he stated, "that the I
American press will publish resumes
of what takes place in the Finnish !
Diet this week, f think much will be
j explained at that time.
"I can assure you," he concluded,
[ "that Finland is, in no sense, co
operating with the general war ;
aims of the Axis powers. We are
! fighting for our national integrity."

territory along the Murmansk-Mos
cow railroad has been made neces- I
sary as a counter-action, he ex- I
plained, because since the Winter ;
War of 1939-40, the Russian govern
ment has constructed six railroads ;
leading from the Murmansk - Mos
cow trunk-line to the Finnish bor- |
der.
"As I understand it," Dr. Holsti ,
commented, "the Finnish govern- j
ment would be most anxious to '
conclude a peace when it is ado- '
quately assured that those railroads
will not be used for the purposes of
another invasion." The Finnish i
armies, he noted, have made no ef
fort to cross the old Finn-Russ bol -
der on the Karelian Isthmus.
LENINGRAD SIEGE
"Assuming that we were to cap- 1
ture Leningrad, which I don't think
we want to do," he said, "we cer- >
lainly do not want the problem of
feeding the three million Russians ]
now under siege in the Moscow >
j sector."
Dr. Holsti said that he could haz
ard no guesses on what effect the in
creased American pressure for a !
j Russo-Finn peace would have upon
the future policy of the Finnish |
■government. By the same token, he
j could make no statement on Fin- ;
land's inclusion in Adolf Hitler's new
I anti-Commintern agreement.
HOPES FOR RESUMES
"I hope," he stated, "that the I
American press will publish resumes
of what takes place in the Finnish !
Diet this week, f think much will be
j explained at that time.
"I can assure you," he concluded,
[ "that Finland is, in no sense, co
operating with the general war ;
aims of the Axis powers. We are
! fighting for our national integrity."
