## Charles Bull Suggests Plan for Speeded-up Nomination, Election 
### BUD AMES 
With background music softly J
playing "Here Wc Go Again," Ex- :
ecutive Committee last night re- (
opened discussion of that bouncing- j
ball subject, student elections.
Father of this week's plan,
Charlie Bull, explained his propos
als as "a step to clean up the system
a little, but not to act as a panacea."
The proposed plan, which has now
gone to an Excom subcommittee for
rehash of a rehash and recommenda
tions at the next meeting, hinges on
the speeding up of election week
proceedings by:
(1) Opening nominations on a
Monday and closing them at 5 the
same day.
(2) Holding the student assembly
Tuesday morning, and leaving dec
linations open until 3 of that day. !
(3) By holding the election that
Wednesday.

be instructed to place a limitation
on the number of tickets which will
be sold at the pre-public and public j
sales.

movies. Discussion was made re
garding the moving of these movies j
from the Education to the Memorial
Theater, a suggestion finally ap
proved.
But Pat Adams wasn't so sure.
"The expense might be more," she
volunteered. "After all, it costs five i
dollars more for a man on Sunday." j
