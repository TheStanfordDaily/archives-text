### AMIE REICHERT 
weeks ago there was a
vague but exciting story going
the journalistic rounds about a dar
ing band of British phantom troops
who made a lightning raid on the
French coast, raised a general ruckus
in one of the Channel cities, and
then headed for a hotel where they
were set to pounce on paunchy Her
mann Goering.
But Hermann wasn't there. He
had left only an hour or so be
fore.
The next report was that these
men were quite well organized,
Commandos, they were called, and
that they did this sort of thing
regularly and wtih some degree of
success.
The day before yesterday, the
Commandos hit the headlines as for
the first time British officials re
leased a report on their activities,
and even the Germans acknowledged
that they had made a midnight at
tack on the Nazi-held Normandy
coast.

we know a little more about
them. They work in small (up
to 50) groups and they specialize in
(his sort of hit-and-run raid. Re
ports say that they wear weird black
battle outfits, and that they blacken
their faces to match. They are armed
with tommy guns, grenades, knives,
sticks of dynamite, and British cour
age.
These men are organized to re
connoiter German defenses, to
sabotage, and generally make the
Nazis' night as uncomfortable as
possible. The first official report
of the recent raid was made by
t lie German High Command,
which claimed that the attack was
repulsed, the small ships carrying
the men turned back.
Then followed the British version
which claimed that the Commandos
had completed their mission and re
turned with only one casualty—a
man who was wounded in the arm.
The fact that the Germans an
nounced the raid officially would
seem to indicate that these attacks
are increasing to the point where
they are proving a little more than
just annoying to the Nazis.
The British refused to give de
tails of the attack, saying that the
Germans were just fishing for in
formation.

A T THE same time that the Brit
ish released the scant bit of in
formation they did, Admiral Sir
Roger J. B. Keyes, organizer of the
Commandos, bitterly accused the
British "brass hats" for over-riding
the wishes of even Winston Church
ill, in refusing to allow these shock
troops to strike a year ago when
they might have launched an inva
sion.
Keyes said that at that time the
troops were "ready and eager to
act." He was relieved of com
mand of the Commandos a little
over a month ago because of his
age (fif)) but he told the House of
Commons that during his 15
months of leadership he was re
fused permission for every val
uable offensive which he wanted
to undertake.
He charged that a year ago
Churchill was as anxious as he for
a major offensive, but "unfortu
nately, the prime minister was
handicapped not only by the same
machinery that Whitehall enforced
in the last war, but now an appar
ently greater force, a constitutional
power."

to elucidate as to just
whom he meant, Keyes cited
Churchill's outline of those bodies
responsible for the conduct of the
war, made in the House of Com
mons May 7.
This outline included the three
chiefs of staff, the three service min
isters, and members of the war
cabinet—Churchill, Anthony Eden,
and Lord Beaverbrook.
"Until the staff system is thor
oughly overhauled," Keyes said,
we shall always be too lale in ev
erything we undertake."
The only answer that the govern
ment would make to Keyes came
from Arthur Greenwood of the
Cabinet. He said that he could not
reply to Keyes because to do so
might disclose "information of great
strategic importance."

Then followed the British version
which claimed that the Commandos
had completed their mission and re
turned with only one casualty—a
man who was wounded in the arm.
The fact that the Germans an
nounced the raid officially would
seem to indicate that these attacks
are increasing to the point where
they are proving a little more than
just annoying to the Nazis.
The British refused to give de
tails of the attack, saying that the
Germans were just fishing for in
formation.

A T THE same time that the Brit
ish released the scant bit of in
formation they did, Admiral Sir
Roger J. B. Keyes, organizer of the
Commandos, bitterly accused the
British "brass hats" for over-riding
the wishes of even Winston Church
ill, in refusing to allow these shock
troops to strike a year ago when
they might have launched an inva
sion.
Keyes said that at that time the
troops were "ready and eager to
act." He was relieved of com
mand of the Commandos a little
over a month ago because of his
age (fif)) but he told the House of
Commons that during his 15
months of leadership he was re
fused permission for every val
uable offensive which he wanted
to undertake.
He charged that a year ago
Churchill was as anxious as he for
a major offensive, but "unfortu
nately, the prime minister was
handicapped not only by the same
machinery that Whitehall enforced
in the last war, but now an appar
ently greater force, a constitutional
power."

to elucidate as to just
whom he meant, Keyes cited
Churchill's outline of those bodies
responsible for the conduct of the
war, made in the House of Com
mons May 7.
This outline included the three
chiefs of staff, the three service min
isters, and members of the war
cabinet—Churchill, Anthony Eden,
and Lord Beaverbrook.
"Until the staff system is thor
oughly overhauled," Keyes said,
we shall always be too lale in ev
erything we undertake."
The only answer that the govern
ment would make to Keyes came
from Arthur Greenwood of the
Cabinet. He said that he could not
reply to Keyes because to do so
might disclose "information of great
strategic importance."

vague but exciting story going

Churchill's outline of those bodies
responsible for the conduct of the
war, made in the House of Com

This outline included the three
chiefs of staff, the three service min
isters, and members of the war
cabinet—Churchill, Anthony Eden,
and Lord Beaverbrook.
"Until the staff system is thor
oughly overhauled," Keyes said,
we shall always be too lale in ev

The only answer that the govern

from Arthur Greenwood of the

weeks ago there was a
vague but exciting story going
the journalistic rounds about a dar
ing band of British phantom troops
who made a lightning raid on the
French coast, raised a general ruckus
in one of the Channel cities, and
then headed for a hotel where they
were set to pounce on paunchy Her
mann Goering.
But Hermann wasn't there. He
had left only an hour or so be
fore.
The next report was that these
men were quite well organized,
Commandos, they were called, and
that they did this sort of thing
regularly and wtih some degree of
success.
The day before yesterday, the
Commandos hit the headlines as for
the first time British officials re
leased a report on their activities,
and even the Germans acknowledged
that they had made a midnight at
tack on the Nazi-held Normandy
coast.

we know a little more about
them. They work in small (up
to 50) groups and they specialize in
(his sort of hit-and-run raid. Re
ports say that they wear weird black
battle outfits, and that they blacken
their faces to match. They are armed
with tommy guns, grenades, knives,
sticks of dynamite, and British cour
age.
These men are organized to re
connoiter German defenses, to
sabotage, and generally make the
Nazis' night as uncomfortable as
possible. The first official report
of the recent raid was made by
t lie German High Command,
which claimed that the attack was
repulsed, the small ships carrying
the men turned back.
Then followed the British version
which claimed that the Commandos
had completed their mission and re
turned with only one casualty—a
man who was wounded in the arm.
The fact that the Germans an
nounced the raid officially would
seem to indicate that these attacks
are increasing to the point where
they are proving a little more than
just annoying to the Nazis.
The British refused to give de
tails of the attack, saying that the
Germans were just fishing for in
formation.

A T THE same time that the Brit
ish released the scant bit of in
formation they did, Admiral Sir
Roger J. B. Keyes, organizer of the
Commandos, bitterly accused the
British "brass hats" for over-riding
the wishes of even Winston Church
ill, in refusing to allow these shock
troops to strike a year ago when
they might have launched an inva
sion.
Keyes said that at that time the
troops were "ready and eager to
act." He was relieved of com
mand of the Commandos a little
over a month ago because of his
age (fif)) but he told the House of
Commons that during his 15
months of leadership he was re
fused permission for every val
uable offensive which he wanted
to undertake.
He charged that a year ago
Churchill was as anxious as he for
a major offensive, but "unfortu
nately, the prime minister was
handicapped not only by the same
machinery that Whitehall enforced
in the last war, but now an appar
ently greater force, a constitutional
power."
