"Seniors will get a chance to see
what the Libe looks like from the
inside," Cowden stated. "It should
be lots of fun. They can go up in
the elevator and come down the
steps, or go up the steps and come
down in the elevator, or go up in the
elevator and come down in it, or
go up and down the steps."
The Class of '42 will be able to go
through the stacks, and visit all the
offices. Seniors will be stationed at
different points throughout the
building to act as ushers and to
"keep people from falling off the
top," Cowden stated.
