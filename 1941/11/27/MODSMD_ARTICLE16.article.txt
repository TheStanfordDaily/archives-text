# BAND, BEAR TEAM UP
## 
### NEWTON WISE 
"Yes the big white shako is
actually from a polar bear. The
band keeps a bunch of them; they
act as our mascots when they're
not doing duly as headgear." Dick
Hartman, drum major of the Stan
ford Band, went on, "But. se
riously the big shako is the near
est thing to a good drum major
ette here at Stanford."
Hartman, his shako, and new
$. r )0 uniform, will lead the Band
Saturday when it climaxes its
fullest quarter of activities at the
half-time of the Big Game. Al
though the half-time stunt is be
ing kept secret, it is known that it
will be based on the songs of
California and Stanford and will be
centered around the bell lyre play
ers.
BAND TO BE ENTERTAINED
Friday night the Band will be
the guest of the Stanford Club of
San Francisco in the grill room
of the Palace, and later in the eve
ning the guest of the Med School
alumni at rallies of Farm alumni
being held that evening in the City.

Members will travel to San Fran
cisco by bus, and will be dined
and entertained by the alumni.
Promising that the band will be
in good shape in spite of Friday
night, Hartman said that Satur
day's half-time show would sur
pass by far the S.C. show put on
down South by the Farm band
which received a great deal of
praise from Los Angeles papers.
The band formed a clock with
moving hands, after which they
spelled out "T" Time. Special cars
took the 65 members south. Each
student was allotted his ticket and
five dollars spending money.
Chartered buses took them around
Los Angeles.
The hand marched at all home
games, beginning its activities at
tlie Oregon game. At the U.S.F.
game they spelled out a hvfe
Hello, and introduced a new piece,
"Bells and Chimes." written for
the band by a friend sick in the
hospital. Band members have
written words to the piece, and
plan to present them to the stu
dent body. Stunts for the past

season have been arranged by
Hartman and Emmet I^aidlaw.
Frank Elssas, formerly of San
Jose Stale, is the new director. He
is assisted by la-w Dorscy, stu
dent director, who is chosen by
members of the Band. Assisting
Hartman as drum majors are Ted
Kberle and Henry Lew. Emmet t.
Laidlaw belps think up the half
time stunts.
In addition to practicing the
stunt this week, the band has been
perfecting the new fast cadence
w.hich it adopted three weeks ago.
The new gait is difficult to be
come accustomed too, but im
proves the marching appearance
considerably.
The Band Club, social organiza
tion for Band members, was es
tablished last year under the di
rection of Jack Hedden. and func
tions mainly for the improvement
of the band, and the fellowship of
its members. Officers include Lew
Dorsey, president, Ed Carpentar,
vice president, and Rene Zentner,
secretary-treasurer. All the offi
cers are elected bv the club.
