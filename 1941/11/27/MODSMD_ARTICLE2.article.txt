# U.S. Refuses Appeasement Of Japan
## Negotiations Expected To Break Down; Hull Reiterates 1937 Policy 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 (CP).—
'Hie United States tonight handed
Japan a blunt statement of |>olicy
which informed quarters said vir
tually ended all chance of an agree
ment between the two countries on
explosive Far Eastern issues.
A last-minute switch, reportedly
resulting from a Chinese appeal to
the White House, swung the United
States from an anticipated program
of conciliation toward Japan to one
of firm reiteration of long-standing
American policies.
In effect, the statement said that
Japan must withdraw all her troops
from China and cease support of the
Wang Chin-Wei regime in Nanking
as an essential preliminary to any
agreement with the United States.
HULL RESTATEMENT
The statement—tendered to Japa
nese Ambassadors Saburo Kurusu
and Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura
by Secretary of State Cordell Hull
was in the nature of a settlement
formula but, instead of meeting
Japanese demands for American con
cessions, it restated Hull's historic

BERLIN, Nov. 2<i (UP).—For
eign Minister Joachim von Ribhen
trop said today that United States
entry into the war would not pre
vent an Axis victory, that "Eu
rope" was prepared, if necessary,
to fight "a 150 years war,' 'and that
the British Isles will be destroyed
—"on land, on the sea, and in the
air."
The speech, broadcast through
out Germany, enunciated these
ther principal points:
1. Russia already is beaten and
broken.
2. Germany has not extended
any recent peace offers and will
not do so.
There will be no revolt in
Europe and Germany will never
capitulate.
4. Japan is creating a new or
der in the Asiatic sphere.
5. It is nonsense that Germany
is planning a world religion or that
she has planned to carve up South
America into Axis - dominated
states.

1937 declaration of principles sup
porting the following policies:
1. Inviolability of territorial in
tegrity and sovereignty.
2. Equality of commercial oppor
tunity.
3. Non-interference in the internal
affairs of other nations.
4. Non-interference with the stat
us quo except as it might be altered
through peaceful means. .
ACEPTANCE IMPOSSIBLE
Well-informed opinion here was
that the Japanese will find these
conditions impossible of acceptance
unless they make a complete about
face in policy, which is not antici
pated.
Until midafternoon, Hull reported
ly was prepared to offer the Japa
nese a 80-day "breathing spell" dur
ing which it was hoped some basis
for agreement on the Far Eastern
crisis might be developed. But well
informed sources said that China, ac
quainted with this decision last
night, objected vigorously and the
State Department altered its plans.
