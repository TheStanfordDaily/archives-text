battalions next quarter. Spring quarter will iim! the unit organized into
a regiment for the first time in Stanford 1i.0.T.C. history.
This new organization, which will have over 100 more men than last
year, will provide additional opportunity for cadet officers to exercise

command and leadership.
Concluding this quarter, the five
R.O.T.C. batteries are participating
in field exercises, known as "Hoops."
(Reconnaisance, Organization, and
Occupation of Position) These exer
cises are designed to give the basic
student a comprehensive picture of
the battery operating as a unit in
the field. They will serve as a back
ground for more extensive exercises
in the winter and spring.
The present organization of the
batteries will continue throughout

the rest of the year. A group of two
or three batteries will form each
battalion, and the two battalions
will form the regiment.
Starting next quarter there will
be interbattery competition, based
on inspection, drill, etc. A review is
scheduled winter quarter to supple
ment the regular spring quarter final
review.
Freshmen R.O.T.C. students are
warned that the course MS 1 (Mili
tary Fundamentals) must be com
pleted this academic year.
