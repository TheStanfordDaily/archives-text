## 
### 
Graduates of Che Civilian Pilot Training- Program are now given ad
vanced standing at both Army and Navy air training centers. Releasing
this information. Dr. David L. Webster, head of the CPTP at Stanford, an
nounced that it would be advisable to prc-register now for the winter
and spring quarter flight training and ground school courses.

Pre-registration is advisable,
Webster explained, because the CAA
sets quotas for the number of stu
dents permitted to take the course
at each school. Early sign-ups make
a larger quota possible, and give the
student a better chance of being
admitted to the course.
The ground-school work totals
eight units, five units in winter
quarter and three in spring. Classes
meet at 8 a.m. Flight training, at
the Palo Alto Airport, will begin
about February 1 and continue
through spring quarter. Students en-,
nflled in the CPTP should be will
ing to stay at school during spring
vacation, if necessary. There is a
course fee of $10, a medical fee of
$2, and insurance premiums of $7, a
total of $29.
The War Department's revision of
its regulations permits credit for a
maximum of 30 hours flying time for
cadets who have completed the
CPTP course. Navy regulations
permit graduates of the secondary
course to pass over the usual elimi
nation training.
Men successfully completing the
course receive a private pilot's li
cense. Over ten thousand CPTP
graduates are now enrolled in the
Army and Navy air services.
All those interested in enrolling in
the course should see Dr. Webster,
Room 385 in the Physics Corner.
Provisional limit for preregistration
is Dec. 6. Only men are eligible.
