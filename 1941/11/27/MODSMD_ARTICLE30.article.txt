# Vucinich Stays in Hospital, Will Probably Play at Game
## 
### 
As the present draws to within 54 hours of the Big Game, the follow- |
ing facts stand out:
Stanford's Pete Kmetovic and Milt Vucinicli will probably play, but
there's no telling how. long they'll last. Kmetovic practiced in a sweat suit
yesterday, while Vucinicli obeyed Dr. Fritz lloth's orders to remain in
the hospital.

The odds are still in Stanford's
favor and are quoted at 2 i -> to 1 at
present, although it is expected that
they might drop.
California is still in good shape,
with A1 Dorian, Bear tailback who
was laid up for about 10 days be
fore this week with a head injury,
ready to go at top speed.
bkars high
Cal is psychologically "high."
Stanford's men, while not in a
frenzy, are working hard. They're
serious; they know it'll be a tough
game. They're in the mood.
Most encouraging news on (he
Stanford front yesterday was the
comparative ease with which Pete
Kmetovic was running, for, although
he didn't do any sharp cutting or
speed running, the Ilashy left half
who makes the T ground attack
function appeared to be improving.
Alternating with Kmetovic while the
backs were running their plays was

Bobby Ditlevsen, quite a tricky back j
himself who has had little chance to j
show this season.
CRANK FOR VOOS
In the absence of Vucinich, Bob
Crane took over the first-string du
ties, working with Hoot Armstrong,
Frankie Albert, and Kmetovic. The
second quartet was composed of A1
Cole, Bill Sheller, Bob Mitchell, and
Buck Fawcett. Bruno Banducci,
bothered by a knee bruise yesterday,
is in good shape.
Meanwhile, reports from Berkeley
say that, while Stub Allison believes
his boys are working into good con
dition lor the Big. Game, the Top
Surge is having some difficulty with
the quarterback situation, where
first-stringer Joe Merlo is still
bruised from the Oregon State game
and Cal Ellis, the third-string man,
is out with tonsiiltis. This leaves
Glen Whelan as the only able-bod
ied quarterback. But the Bears will
be ready, and in no uncertain man
ner.
Marchie Schwartz, who coached
tennis at Stanford in 1940, hadn't
played a single set of the game for j
17 years.

Marchie Schwartz, who coached
tennis at Stanford in 1940, hadn't
played a single set of the game for j
17 years.
As the present draws to within 54 hours of the Big Game, the follow- |
ing facts stand out:
Stanford's Pete Kmetovic and Milt Vucinicli will probably play, but
there's no telling how. long they'll last. Kmetovic practiced in a sweat suit
yesterday, while Vucinicli obeyed Dr. Fritz lloth's orders to remain in
the hospital.

The odds are still in Stanford's
favor and are quoted at 2 i -> to 1 at
present, although it is expected that
they might drop.
California is still in good shape,
with A1 Dorian, Bear tailback who
was laid up for about 10 days be
fore this week with a head injury,
ready to go at top speed.
bkars high
Cal is psychologically "high."
Stanford's men, while not in a
frenzy, are working hard. They're
serious; they know it'll be a tough
game. They're in the mood.
Most encouraging news on (he
Stanford front yesterday was the
comparative ease with which Pete
Kmetovic was running, for, although
he didn't do any sharp cutting or
speed running, the Ilashy left half
who makes the T ground attack
function appeared to be improving.
Alternating with Kmetovic while the
backs were running their plays was

Bobby Ditlevsen, quite a tricky back j
himself who has had little chance to j
show this season.
CRANK FOR VOOS
In the absence of Vucinich, Bob
Crane took over the first-string du
ties, working with Hoot Armstrong,
Frankie Albert, and Kmetovic. The
second quartet was composed of A1
Cole, Bill Sheller, Bob Mitchell, and
Buck Fawcett. Bruno Banducci,
bothered by a knee bruise yesterday,
is in good shape.
Meanwhile, reports from Berkeley
say that, while Stub Allison believes
his boys are working into good con
dition lor the Big. Game, the Top
Surge is having some difficulty with
the quarterback situation, where
first-stringer Joe Merlo is still
bruised from the Oregon State game
and Cal Ellis, the third-string man,
is out with tonsiiltis. This leaves
Glen Whelan as the only able-bod
ied quarterback. But the Bears will
be ready, and in no uncertain man
ner.
