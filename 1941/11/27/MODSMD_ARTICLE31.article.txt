# Water Poloists Try for Sweep
## 
### 
Trying for their first series sweep
in seven years and for a second place
conference berth, three senior and
four junior members of the Stanford
varsity water polo team tangle with
California this afternoon at 4 o'clock
in the Encina pools.
Seniors starting their last water
polo game for Stanford include Fred
| Man waring, forward; Captain Frank
Mitchell, guard; and Ed Smith, goal
ie. Other seniors due to see action
against their traditional foes from
across the Bay are Johnny Pollock
and Bob Breckner.
Not since 1934, when the Bears
snapped a 22-year Stanford winning
streak, have the Indians copped both
ends of the series against California.
The Bears won both games in 1935
J and 1937, and the remaining five
were even.
Stanford's 7 to 4 victory over Cali
fornia earlier this season has already
been disregarded as somewhat of a
fluke by the Bear coach, A1 Dowden, :
; so the Indians, according to Coach
Norton Thornton, are out to show
that they can stop Johnny Norris,
ace Bear forward, again.
Completing the Stanford starting !
line-up will be Bill Mapel, sprint;
Hadley Bacon, forward; Jack Bleec
ker, center back; and Bob Jones,
! guard.
Admission to the varsity and •
freshmen preliminary will be 25 I
cents for students and 55 cents for
outsiders.

mages will probably start Friday for
the Bruins.
