for the last time, j
we'll repeat the situation in the j
Pacific Coast Athletic Conference
and the current Rose Bowl race.
Discounting Idaho and Montana
games played by the Beavers, Ore
gon State and Stanford are tied for j
the top spot with four wins and two
losses apiece. Should both win Sat- |
urday, the chances age that O.S.C.
will get the bid, although tied for
the loop title, because of the victory
over Stanford. For Stanford to go to
the Pasadena game, it will be neces
sary for the Indians to defeat Cali
fornia in the Big Game and for Ore
gon to knock over Oregon State at
Ejagene.
Okay.

jVOW let's see what Stanford and [
California, respectively, have to
offer in the forty-seventh renewal i
of the Big Game.
Stanford, to date, has scored 91 j
points; Cal, (>O.
Stanford has been icked for 46
points; Cal for 58.
Stanford has averaged 305.3 yards
per game; Cal, 175.8.
Stanford has given up an average !
of 179.6 yards per game; California,
183.8.
It doesn't take an expert to con
clude that, statistically speaking,
Stanford has a definite edge over the i

Bears, especially from an offensive
point of view.
However, there are two primary
reasons why you can't count on sta
tistics to too great an extent in Sat
urday's game.
1. It's the game a team plays on a
particular day that wins ball games,
not how the contesting teams have
done over a series of games.
2. Stanford had its team intact for
MOST of the games this year, but it
is NOT CERTAIN whether or not
they'll all be ready to go Saturday.
This is especially true in the case of
Pete Kmetovic, the boy who has
gained 433 yards from rushing this
fall.
As far as individual backs are
concerned, Stanford is far ahead of
the Bears, what with Kmet's run
ning—if he can run tomorrow—and
Albert's running and passing, which
have put the All-American quarter
back ahead of all other conference
backs in total offense with 798 yards.
Albert's passes have accounted for
674 yards, more than any other con
ference player.

have put the All-American quarter
back ahead of all other conference
backs in total offense with 798 yards.
Albert's passes have accounted for
674 yards, more than any other con
ference player.
for the last time, j
we'll repeat the situation in the j
Pacific Coast Athletic Conference
and the current Rose Bowl race.
Discounting Idaho and Montana
games played by the Beavers, Ore
gon State and Stanford are tied for j
the top spot with four wins and two
losses apiece. Should both win Sat- |
urday, the chances age that O.S.C.
will get the bid, although tied for
the loop title, because of the victory
over Stanford. For Stanford to go to
the Pasadena game, it will be neces
sary for the Indians to defeat Cali
fornia in the Big Game and for Ore
gon to knock over Oregon State at
Ejagene.
Okay.

jVOW let's see what Stanford and [
California, respectively, have to
offer in the forty-seventh renewal i
of the Big Game.
Stanford, to date, has scored 91 j
points; Cal, (>O.
Stanford has been icked for 46
points; Cal for 58.
Stanford has averaged 305.3 yards
per game; Cal, 175.8.
Stanford has given up an average !
of 179.6 yards per game; California,
183.8.
It doesn't take an expert to con
clude that, statistically speaking,
Stanford has a definite edge over the i

Bears, especially from an offensive
point of view.
However, there are two primary
reasons why you can't count on sta
tistics to too great an extent in Sat
urday's game.
1. It's the game a team plays on a
particular day that wins ball games,
not how the contesting teams have
done over a series of games.
2. Stanford had its team intact for
MOST of the games this year, but it
is NOT CERTAIN whether or not
they'll all be ready to go Saturday.
This is especially true in the case of
Pete Kmetovic, the boy who has
gained 433 yards from rushing this
fall.
As far as individual backs are
concerned, Stanford is far ahead of
the Bears, what with Kmet's run
ning—if he can run tomorrow—and
Albert's running and passing, which
have put the All-American quarter
back ahead of all other conference
backs in total offense with 798 yards.
Albert's passes have accounted for
674 yards, more than any other con
ference player.
