# Brownell Tops Course Record, Beating Shute
## 
### DON SELBY 
Dropping a .'{s-foot putt for a
birdie on the final hole, Bud Brown
ell, number one man on the Stanford
golf team, shot a brilliant (i!> over
the tricky Stanford course yesterday
to break I In- course record by two
strokes.
Art Doering, former Card links
ace who knocked Brownell out of
match play in the National Amateur
last summer, held the former rec
ord of 65.
IIAS EIGHT BIRDIES
Playing with Warren Berl of Stan
fold and Denny Shute, the pro pub
licized as the feature player of the
exhibition, Brownell started out with
the right loot forward holing out in
four on the long par five first hole.
By the time the match' was over,
Brownell had repeated the perform
ance seven times, foj* a total of eight
birdies. He didn't have a bad hole
all afternoon, failing to turn in a
single bogie.
BERL SHOOTS 72
Berl, too, played good golf, com
ing through with a one-over-par 72,
while Shute turned in a 75. Making
Brownell's performance even more
outstanding was the fact that the
back tees were used, making the
Stanford course every bit as tough
as the famed Pebble Beach layout
on which the State Amateur tourney
is annually played.
Brownell, who went to the finals
of the National Intercollegiates last
summer before going down before
Earl Stewart of Louisiana State, has
two more years of eligibility for
Stanford, although he is now a
senior. The tall, lanky youth from
Carmel transferred to Stanford from
Salinas Junior College in the fall of
1940. He went to the quarter-finals
of the State Amateur last summer
and is the defending Stanford In
vitational tourney champ.
