# Indian Harriers To Race Cal Here
## 
### 
Looking for Indian blood, the
California varsity cross country
learn will invade the Farm this af
ternoon to do battle with the Stan
ford harriers over the Stanford Goll'
Course.
That the Bears are sending down
a fast, capable squad is evidenced by
that they beat their cousins
fi'om Westwood, the Uclans, by a j
19-36 score. This same U.C.L.A.
team defeated Stanford earlier in the \
year.
At the present time the chief
worry of the Indianmen is whether
or not Francis Olsen, varsity ace, j
will recover from his cold quickly
enough to be in top shape.
