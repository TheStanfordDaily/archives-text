# 1941 Big Game Gaieties Hits Farm Tomorrow
## 
### BILL STEIF 
Primed by a dress rehearsal last night ami the prospect of another
dress rehearsal tonight, the Big Game Gaieties, Stanford's annual song,
gag, and dance riot, takes the stage of the Memorial Theater tomorrow
afternoon at 2:.'M) o'clock for the first performance of the show's 1941
edition. 4

Over at the theater the annual
"nervous tension" 4hat precedes each
production of a Gaieties is coming
to the fore and as one prominent
female cog in the show remarked,
"everybody's in a hub-bub."
This, however, does not mean that
the show will not be good. On the
contrary, Asher Wilson takes this
"nervousness" as a sign that every
one in the show —cast and crew—is
anxious to do his or her best for the
production, and. as a result, each
has just a slight case of excitement.
In fact, even the optimistic Asher
admits that "mother and child are
doing beautifully but...Papa Wilson
is still a little bit shaky." Where
upon one of the Gaieties underlings
salaamed by muttering "Hallelujah,
Father Wilson."
DRESS REHEARSAL
The first dress rehearsal was held
at 7 o'clock last night and, though
Director Wilson and his assistant
"Beej" Miller noticed a few rough
edges on the production, they be
lieve that these can be easily
smoothed out by the time that the
Gaieties lifts its first curtain to to
morrow afternoon's audience.
One of the reasons for this slight
roughness, on the music at least, was
the fact that yesterday evening's re
hearsal was the first which had tak
en place with a full orchestra, ac
cording to F. Marion Scott, head of
the Gaieties' musical portion. This
band, incidentally, is directed by
Art McCue, a Stanford graduate,
who also arranged the show's music.
This, said Scott, will undoubtedly
add to the production's quality, since
it is the first time that a Gaieties'
band has been able to play music
arranged by the band's leader.
SEATS AVAILABLE
So far, according to Dramatic
Manager Bill Moran, about half of
the tickets for the matinee are gone,
