# The 						Responsibility Is Ours

STANFORD'S famed Honor Code is some
thing which most students take for granted.
They don't think much about it when they sign
that pledge at the end of exams. It becomes a
matter of habit.
But something as living, vital, as the Honor
Code should not be taken for granted.
Last spring, Dr. Wilbur called about thirty
student leaders up to his house to have a real
"down-to-earth" bull session on the Honor Code.
The Honor Code was set up in 1921. In twenty
years it has undergone a lot of changes. Dur
ing each college generation of four years the
implications attached to the Honor Code tend
to change under the interpretation of an entirely
new group of students.
A little more than three years ago, the Class
of '42 took its first exam. Since that day, the
tendency has been to broaden the implications
of the Honor Code, to take it for granted that
this unwritten code will let them do a lot more
than it was originally intended to do.
These changes in student attitude toward the
Honor Code were what Dr. Wilbur wanted to
talk about. The conclusion was that some form
of student committee should be set up to study
these changes, to discuss ways and means of
strengthening the Honor Code, insuring its com
plete understanding by both students and fac
ulty.
This year a member of the Executive Com
mittee has been appointed to do just this.
This committee is not going to attempt to
freeze the Code as it is now, nor it is going to
try to take it back to the 1921 stage.
The vitality of the Honor Code, the complete
belief in it by every student, the faith of the
faculty in it, must be upheld at any cost. With
out these, the Honor Code becomes an empty
shell.
It is perfectly natural that after 20 years of
operation, of acceptance of responsibility by
students and faculty, the Honor Code should
work. But if either of these acceptances of re
sponsibility breaks down, becomes stagnant
and passive, the Honor Code must fail.
This committee will attempt to keep in the
mind of every student the true concept of the
Code, to keep a positive, active attitude toward
one of the great privileges accorded Stanford
students.
In its broadness and active acceptance lies its
strength.

new group of students.
A little more than three years ago, the Class
of '42 took its first exam. Since that day, the
tendency has been to broaden the implications
of the Honor Code, to take it for granted that
this unwritten code will let them do a lot more
than it was originally intended to do.
These changes in student attitude toward the
Honor Code were what Dr. Wilbur wanted to
talk about. The conclusion was that some form
of student committee should be set up to study
these changes, to discuss ways and means of
strengthening the Honor Code, insuring its com
plete understanding by both students and fac
ulty.
This year a member of the Executive Com
mittee has been appointed to do just this.
This committee is not going to attempt to
freeze the Code as it is now, nor it is going to
try to take it back to the 1921 stage.
The vitality of the Honor Code, the complete
belief in it by every student, the faith of the
faculty in it, must be upheld at any cost. With
out these, the Honor Code becomes an empty
shell.
It is perfectly natural that after 20 years of
operation, of acceptance of responsibility by
students and faculty, the Honor Code should
work. But if either of these acceptances of re
sponsibility breaks down, becomes stagnant
and passive, the Honor Code must fail.
This committee will attempt to keep in the
mind of every student the true concept of the
Code, to keep a positive, active attitude toward
one of the great privileges accorded Stanford
students.
In its broadness and active acceptance lies its
strength.
STANFORD'S famed Honor Code is some
thing which most students take for granted.
They don't think much about it when they sign
that pledge at the end of exams. It becomes a
matter of habit.
But something as living, vital, as the Honor
Code should not be taken for granted.
Last spring, Dr. Wilbur called about thirty
student leaders up to his house to have a real
"down-to-earth" bull session on the Honor Code.
The Honor Code was set up in 1921. In twenty
years it has undergone a lot of changes. Dur
ing each college generation of four years the
implications attached to the Honor Code tend
to change under the interpretation of an entirely
new group of students.
