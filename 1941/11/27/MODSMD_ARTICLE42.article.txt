STANFORD'S stepchild has at last found a
permanent home.
For years, Stanford has faced a difficult lost
and found problem. No organization, student or j
administration, was solely responsible for han
dling lost and found articles. Semi-official lost
and found bureaus were located in the Library,
Cashier's office, 8.A.C., Union Cellar, and A.S.- j

S.U. office. In addition, each school department
served as an agency.
Strength, courage, and perseverance were
essential to the seeker of a lost pen or note
book. Most students gave up in the face of the
campus tour.
Last spring, however, The Daily proposed to
the administration and student body that a
central lost and found department be estab
lished. With Administration approval, Ex
Committee established a student-administered
agency.
This agency proved unsuccessful for lack of
volunteer aid to collect, record, and distribute
found articles. Hence, the stepchild was sent
back to the Administration a month ago by Ex
com.
And now, after years of being kicked around,
the stepchild has high hopes of at last finding a
permanent abode. The Administration has as
sumed full responsibility for handling the lost
and found.
The effort expended by The Daily, Excom,
and student lost-and-found administrators to es
tablish a central agency, although at first not
succesful, has certainly proved worth while
as evidenced by today's announcement from the
Administration.—Herman Silverman
