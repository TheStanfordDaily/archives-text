# BULL SESSION

### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
A NIGHT AT THE GAIETIES
'y A KING three hours off the other evening, your old
Bull Sessioner roamed around the Memorial The
ater to see what was happening to the big show they
have been working on since the beginning of the
quarter. And after three hours of walking and look
ing and asking, your old friend knows very little more
than he did, except that putting out shows looks like
a lot of fun and hard work, and that the Memorial
Theater is an awfully big place, and that it is very
easy to get lost there.
I first stepped onto the main stage where a huge
palm tree was hanging, and where a bunch of girls
in white overalls, their faces smeared with something
black, were walking around and talking. I asked if it
was one of the main skits, and was amazed to leam
that it was only a technical rehearsal, and that the
girls were only a part of the stage crew, and their
make-up wasn't make-up but the result of hard work.
Just at that moment a di'op with Indians painted all
over it dropped, barely missing me, so I left.
Through doors and rooms I went to the Little
Theater where a skit called '"Arsenic and Old Faces"
was being run off. It was all run by tapping, Ash
Wilson doing the tapping with a pencil. The girls
who weren't in the skit sat around knitting and they
too kind of kept time with Ash's tapping. It was all
rather confused, but funny.
In another room, I stumbled into the "Conga Num
ber." Under the eye of Adolfo Arias, sultry looking
ladies and oily men jumped and dipped and shook
themselves, and it all looked nice even without music.

nPHE next thing I knew there was a stampede for
the Ram's Head room, where "The Opener" was
going to be run off. I followed the crowd down and
watched. They had a chorus lined up in a V, and they
all sang a song called "V for Victory or Varsity" or
something like that, and in one part of the routine,
the girls all jumped on the boys' knees. They just
couldn't seem to get that knee part right last night, and
had to keep practicing it over and over again. When
I left, the piano had quit playing, the singing had
stopped, the director had given up, and the girls were
comfortably seated on the boys' knees.
From there I stuck my face in a room where one
handsome man was dancing with twelve lovely girls.
I tapped him on the shoulder and asked if I could
cut in, but he said it wasn't a tag dance, so I left.
And in every room that I looked in, it was the same
thing. Singers, dancers, gag-men, prompters, come
dians, straight-men, technicians, all busy working.
By this time I began to get worried. Things looked
too confused and mixed up. I knew that the show was
sold out, but I couldn't see how all these different
skits, all these singers and dancers and comedians,
could be brought out from all these various rooms
and placed onto one stage to present the 1941 Gaieties
with any kind of orderly fashion. I was beginning to
think there would be no Gaieties, so I went up to see
the head man.
"Ash," I asked, "is there going to be a show Friday?"
"Yes," he said. I turned, avoided the drop of the
Indians which they were still pulling up and down
and left the place, still a little confused, but certain
that things would be worked out by Friday.
