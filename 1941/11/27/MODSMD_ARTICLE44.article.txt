# CAMPUS OPINION
## YEA AMBROSE 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
Noting that the last Daily for the quarter comes
out Friday, I felt that I should get something out of
my system that's been bothering me for some time.
When I first came to this school there was much
talk about the democracy of the school, about the
great and individualistic Stanford rough, and much
glory credited to the tradition of the school. Ever
since I entered this University, there has been more
and more control exercised over the Stanford student
body. There has been a loss in the freedom of the
students. Two recent and notable examples are the
"no-fight-back" policy, with the threat of expulsion,
and censorship of the floats. One of the most enjoyable
occasions of my freshman year was my trip to Cal.
Perhaps we were "vandals" in the light of some
campus figures, but we had a hell of a lot of fun
and there was no great amount of harm done to
property or persons. And now they're going to expel
anyone carrying out one of Stanford's best traditions!
And then there is the censorship of the floats. Are
Stanford students degenerating and becoming more
vile as time goes on? I can't remember any floats
last year that caused any embarrassment. Besides, it
is a parade of Stanford students, not for the elderly
citizens of Palo Alto. Give it back to them and have a
Big Game Parade, not a continuation of the pageantry
of the water carnival. What kind of spirit can be dis
played in a pageant?
An alumnus told me the other day that he was
under the impression that Stanford was breeding a
bunch of "sissies," politely called gentlemen, and that
the glory of the Stanford rough has faded away.
Come on, Stanford, let's prevent this. Let's keep
up the traditions. Let's make this our school.
