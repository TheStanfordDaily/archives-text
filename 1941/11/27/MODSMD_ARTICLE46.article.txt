"YOUNG MAN OF CARACAS,'' )>y T. R. Ybarra, published by Ives
Washburn, Inc., New York.
The story of Tom Ybarra, son of a famous Venezuelan general, is the
colorful and exciting tale of a young man with a dual heritage. Drawn
back and forth between his mother's native city, staid, puritanical Boston,

and his father's balmy, gay,
tionary Caracas, Tom Ybarra's his- i
toiy is a delightful one indeed.
The love of the fiery young Latin,
raised amidst the exotic life and in
trigue of Venezuela for a girl im- j
bued with New England's stern effi- j
ciency is the crux of the book. The j
author has captured both tempera
ments and set them one against the
other in excellent contrast; this
might perhaps be indicative of our
present problem of hemispheric co- i
operation.
VENEZUELA HISTORY
The life of Ybarra ans his charm- 1
ing family is interwoven with the
history of Venezuela when it was a ;
militaristic state, almost continually :
crowded with soldiers fighting for ,
the cause of an ambitious general, j
striving to seize power for the sake
of personal glory.
The book is filled with graphic ac
counts of nightly street brawls and ]
dim, ominous battles, in sharp con
trast to the cool calm of the author's ]
native Boston.
VASOLIGATION
Adding great charm and a very j
human quality to the story are the
various amusing and typically do
mestic anecdotes which Ybarra
tells, that come from his continual i
vascillation between North America j
and Venezuela, every time the Gen

eral could enter Caracas in reason
able safety.
The author's descriptions of 18th
century Caracas, his personal com
' mentaries on historical develop
' ments, the story of his father's dif
fiulties with the English language,
| and the struggles of the family's
Irish maid with her ardent Latin
American suitors all add sparkle to
; 'he book and merit its being called
i the South American "Life with
1 Father."—Craig

tionary Caracas, Tom Ybarra's his- i
toiy is a delightful one indeed.
The love of the fiery young Latin,
raised amidst the exotic life and in
trigue of Venezuela for a girl im- j
bued with New England's stern effi- j
ciency is the crux of the book. The j
author has captured both tempera
ments and set them one against the
other in excellent contrast; this
might perhaps be indicative of our
present problem of hemispheric co- i
operation.
VENEZUELA HISTORY
The life of Ybarra ans his charm- 1
ing family is interwoven with the
history of Venezuela when it was a ;
militaristic state, almost continually :
crowded with soldiers fighting for ,
the cause of an ambitious general, j
striving to seize power for the sake
of personal glory.
The book is filled with graphic ac
counts of nightly street brawls and ]
dim, ominous battles, in sharp con
trast to the cool calm of the author's ]
native Boston.
VASOLIGATION
Adding great charm and a very j
human quality to the story are the
various amusing and typically do
mestic anecdotes which Ybarra
tells, that come from his continual i
vascillation between North America j
and Venezuela, every time the Gen

eral could enter Caracas in reason
able safety.
The author's descriptions of 18th
century Caracas, his personal com
' mentaries on historical develop
' ments, the story of his father's dif
fiulties with the English language,
| and the struggles of the family's
Irish maid with her ardent Latin
American suitors all add sparkle to
; 'he book and merit its being called
i the South American "Life with
1 Father."—Craig

The story of Tom Ybarra, son of a famous Venezuelan general, is the
colorful and exciting tale of a young man with a dual heritage. Drawn
back and forth between his mother's native city, staid, puritanical Boston,

and his father's balmy, gay,
tionary Caracas, Tom Ybarra's his- i
toiy is a delightful one indeed.
