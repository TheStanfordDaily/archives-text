# Ski Cards Go On Sale Today
## 
### 
Membership cards for the Stan- |
ford Ski Club go on sale for $1.50 j
this morning at the A.S.S.U. office. |
Cards will entitle members to spe- I
cially reduced rates at Yosemite |
National Park, mecca of all Stan- ;
ford slat riders.
A membership of 500 has been set 1
as the goal by Walt Smith, ski club j
president. Last year interest in ski- j
ing reached a new high when the I
ski club had the largest member- i
ship of any organized club on the j
campus.
Saving for one w(eek-end will I
amount to more than the cost of the
cards. Rates in the dorms are re
duced to $1.25 a night and upski
tickets may be bought for half-price,
at two rides for a quarter. Free les
sons will be awarded to the first 40
members to sign up for each week
end. These have been paid for by
the club. Reduced rates will not go
into effect until winter quarter.
A Ski Ball sponsored by the Cali
fornia Ski Association is being held
at the Fairmont oHtel on Decem
ber 19. The movie, "The Art of Ski
ing," produced by Walt Disney, will !
be premiered. Bids may be pur
chased from Betty Boardman, secre
tary of the club, for $1.25.
Anyone interested in obtaining in
formation about Sun Valley for
Christmas vacation should call Wall i
Smith at the Alpha Delt house.
