THi; STANFORD BOOKSTORE: A REPORT TO STANFORD STUDENTS ON TIIK YEAR 1940-11
To Stanford Students:
The members of ifie Stanford Bookstore, whose names appear below, wish l<> report to von on the business done by the Bookstore during the year
which ended August 31. In addition you will be no doubt interested in comparing the results of this past year v\ith those of the year before, so we
are giving you both sets oi figures in the two columns to the right.
The Bookstore lias two main sources of income: (1) the sale of books, stationery, binders, instruments, typewriters, and a thousand other items
of merchandise; and (2) the rental of books and equipment (such as typewriters) and the repair of such things as fountain pens, electric razors, and
typewriters.
✓ . 1910 it 1939 40
1. During the year, the Bookstore sold to its customers. ,"'mainly yourselves) merely for which it received in
return ... v $174,794 .68 $ 165,979.36
You will note that there was an increase,ii/sales of nearly $9,000. 00 over the year before. This irt
creased patronage made possible Lrw-ite economical operation of the store, and contributed considerably • «
to the increase iu profit which later on iu this report (sec No. 7).
2. In order to obtain these we sold, we had to pay out to publishers, manufacturers, and dealers. ... 119,808.46 I 15,390.26
I his item represents the.-rost, to us. of the total volume of goods sold to our customers, shown iu item
No. 1.
3. Hence, after paying for the goods which we sold, we had left the sum of $ 54,986.22 $ 50,589. 10
Ibis gross.profit from the sale of goods was available for payment of the expenses ol running the Book
store. (iifit remember that we also had a second source ol income:
4. Income from rentals, repairs, etc 4,979.36 4,176.34
So actually we should add together items 3 and 1 in order to determine the total amount available lor
paying our expenses of operation:
i
J. Available for expenses of operation $ 59,965.5" $ 54,765.11
Now these expenses of operating the Bookstore include a great many different items: wages and salaries,
taxes, electricity, insurance, fuel oil, and so on. We shall not attempt to list them all here; any member
of the Board of Directors would be glad to explain them more fully if you are interested.
I'y far the most important item in the list was salaries and wages, v\ll i<*li amounted to $31,265.96 this
past year, as compared with $32,231.75 the year before. Note lh;il we did nearly $9.000.00 more
business this past year with about $ 1,000.00 less out lay for wages and salaries. There is a second reason
for the good profit showing for the year.
But on the other hand, another important item, taxes, increased this past year to $4,220.<>5, as compared
with $3,212.40 the year before. Even so, there was sufficient reduction iu the numerous smaller items of
expense so that the total expense of doing business was actually less this p;ist year than the year before,
though the volume of business was greater.
6. Total expenses of operation 45,543.27 46,359.45
7. This left a balance (net profit on operations) of $ 14,422.31 $ 8, 405.99
Now you will recall that last June we paid a rebate of 6 per cent on sales slips turned in during the pre
ceding year. This amounted altogether to $5.603.<>7 $4,170.90
Then in September we made a gilt to the University ol $5,000.00 to be used as follows:
Commission for Student Aid $2,000.00
Bookstore Loan Fund 1,500.00
Scholarships 1.500.00 5,000.00 3,500.00
There then remained a balance of $3,818.44 to lie added to the capital of the Bookstore. For by in
creasing our capital somewhat in good years, we hope to be able to maintain our rebate and gift poli
cies in poorer years. Transferred to capital reserve 3,818.44 735.09
We also received a small income during the year from such sources as the sale of old store equipment
and interest on securities held as a reserve. This additional income amounted to $891 .61, and was also $14,422.31 $8,405.99
transferred to our capital reserve.

business this past year with about $ 1,000.00 less out lay for wages and salaries. There is a second reason
for the good profit showing for the year.
But on the other hand, another important item, taxes, increased this past year to $4,220.<>5, as compared

The Bookstore lias two main sources of income: (1) the sale of books, stationery, binders, instruments, typewriters, and a thousand other items

THi; STANFORD BOOKSTORE: A REPORT TO STANFORD STUDENTS ON TIIK YEAR 1940-11
To Stanford Students:
The members of ifie Stanford Bookstore, whose names appear below, wish l<> report to von on the business done by the Bookstore during the year
which ended August 31. In addition you will be no doubt interested in comparing the results of this past year v\ith those of the year before, so we
are giving you both sets oi figures in the two columns to the right.
The Bookstore lias two main sources of income: (1) the sale of books, stationery, binders, instruments, typewriters, and a thousand other items
of merchandise; and (2) the rental of books and equipment (such as typewriters) and the repair of such things as fountain pens, electric razors, and
typewriters.
✓ . 1910 it 1939 40
1. During the year, the Bookstore sold to its customers. ,"'mainly yourselves) merely for which it received in
return ... v $174,794 .68 $ 165,979.36
You will note that there was an increase,ii/sales of nearly $9,000. 00 over the year before. This irt
creased patronage made possible Lrw-ite economical operation of the store, and contributed considerably • «
to the increase iu profit which later on iu this report (sec No. 7).
2. In order to obtain these we sold, we had to pay out to publishers, manufacturers, and dealers. ... 119,808.46 I 15,390.26
I his item represents the.-rost, to us. of the total volume of goods sold to our customers, shown iu item
No. 1.
3. Hence, after paying for the goods which we sold, we had left the sum of $ 54,986.22 $ 50,589. 10
Ibis gross.profit from the sale of goods was available for payment of the expenses ol running the Book
store. (iifit remember that we also had a second source ol income:
4. Income from rentals, repairs, etc 4,979.36 4,176.34
So actually we should add together items 3 and 1 in order to determine the total amount available lor
paying our expenses of operation:
i
J. Available for expenses of operation $ 59,965.5" $ 54,765.11
Now these expenses of operating the Bookstore include a great many different items: wages and salaries,
taxes, electricity, insurance, fuel oil, and so on. We shall not attempt to list them all here; any member
of the Board of Directors would be glad to explain them more fully if you are interested.
I'y far the most important item in the list was salaries and wages, v\ll i<*li amounted to $31,265.96 this
past year, as compared with $32,231.75 the year before. Note lh;il we did nearly $9.000.00 more
business this past year with about $ 1,000.00 less out lay for wages and salaries. There is a second reason
for the good profit showing for the year.
But on the other hand, another important item, taxes, increased this past year to $4,220.<>5, as compared
with $3,212.40 the year before. Even so, there was sufficient reduction iu the numerous smaller items of
expense so that the total expense of doing business was actually less this p;ist year than the year before,
though the volume of business was greater.
6. Total expenses of operation 45,543.27 46,359.45
7. This left a balance (net profit on operations) of $ 14,422.31 $ 8, 405.99
Now you will recall that last June we paid a rebate of 6 per cent on sales slips turned in during the pre
ceding year. This amounted altogether to $5.603.<>7 $4,170.90
Then in September we made a gilt to the University ol $5,000.00 to be used as follows:
Commission for Student Aid $2,000.00
Bookstore Loan Fund 1,500.00
Scholarships 1.500.00 5,000.00 3,500.00
There then remained a balance of $3,818.44 to lie added to the capital of the Bookstore. For by in
creasing our capital somewhat in good years, we hope to be able to maintain our rebate and gift poli
cies in poorer years. Transferred to capital reserve 3,818.44 735.09
We also received a small income during the year from such sources as the sale of old store equipment
and interest on securities held as a reserve. This additional income amounted to $891 .61, and was also $14,422.31 $8,405.99
