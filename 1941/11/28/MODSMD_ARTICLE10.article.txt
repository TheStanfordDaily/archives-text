## 
### 
"Seniors, please don't forget to put this one in your date hooks," said
Bill Cowden, class president, last night by way of a final warning. "We
are going to tour the Hoover War Libe together on December 5."
This tour, the second get-together of the active senior class this year,
will begin at 2 and extend until 5 p.m., according to Ollie Hamlin, who

is chairmaning the affair. And it.,
will be open only to seniors.
"What I said yesterday still goes,"
Cowden stated. "Seniors will get a
chance to see what the Libe looks
like from the inside. It should be
lots of fun. They can go up in the
elevator and come down the steps, or
yo up the steps and come down in
the elevator, or go up in the ele
vator and come down in it, or oh,
you know the rest."
LOOK IN STACKS
As part of the tour, seniors will
be permitted to nose through the
stacks and all the offices. Seniors,
acting as ushers and guides, will be
posted throughout the Libe to di
rect traffic and prevent accidents.
Special stop on the tour will be
at the chimes, where Carillonneur
James R. Lawson will demonstrate
| how the chimes are played and the
I mechanism of the carillon.
LOOK DOWN
"Tliis trip will give the seniors a
! chance to get a bird's-eye view of
I the campus."
Though not definite ;it present, it
is hoped that grad students may
| also be admitted to the tour.
"Please don't forget this tour,"
Cowden concluded. "Since The
Dai'[/ now ceases publication, it
| will be difficult to keep you in touch
; with last-minute developments. That
will be up to you seniors."
