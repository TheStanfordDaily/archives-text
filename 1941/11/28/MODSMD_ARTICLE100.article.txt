¥>ANDOM thoughts in the middle of a busy Bigame Week that have
nothing to do with Bigame: Perfect Pete Kmet won a spot on the
U.S.F. all-opponent team just by sitting in the press box watching the
Card-Don fracas. I guess the Rilltoppers figured that an injured Kmet in
the stands did them more harm than most other halfbacks on the field in
good health .... Bill Leiser reminds me of Fred Allen, or vice versa . . . .
24-year-old Lou Boudreau's appointment as Cleveland's manager makes
one wonder why a girl on the second floor of Roble shouldn't take over
when Dr. Bailey steps out .... San Jose State's frosh track team next
spring will be able to give the Indian varsity a terrific battle. The Little
Spartans have enrolled this year the men who were the best performers
in six events in California high school circles last year .... Southland
sports fans will be overjoyed to hear lhat Braven Dyer, longtime grid ex
pert for the L.A. Times, is back on that paper's payrolls, after having been
exiled for several years due to his acceptance of a small piece of change
from Lou Daro for publicizing the rasslers .... this could go on indefi
nitely .... my nomination for the best hop-scotch played in school—
Kenny Davidson.

17 VERY man has his all-American ideas, but most of them don't have any
space to put it in. I've got some ideas and I've got space:
Left end—Charley Anderson (Ohio State)
Left tackle—Dick Wildung (Minnesota)
Left guard—Chuck Taylor (Stanford)
Center—Ray Jankins (Missouri)
Right guard—Ray Frankowski (Washington)
Right tackle—Alf Bauman (Northwestern)
Right end—Jap Davis (Alabama) ■ -
Quarterback —Bill Dudley (Virginia)
Left half—Special Delivery Jones (Pittsburgh)
Right half—Broken Jaw Sinkwich
Fullbaek—Steve Lach (Duke)
For coach on my team I'd have Frankie Albert of Stanford.

J AST year Stanford had the smoothest basketball team seen in these
u parts in many a long year. When they met the Giants of the Palouse
(W.S.C.) on a strange court last season this smoothness did them little
good. All year long they struggled with inferior teams which had only a
height advantage.
This season Kenny Davidson, Fordy Anderson, and Hon Williams, the
smooth boys, are gone. In llieir place have come big men who can't go
around and through their opponents like the '41 Cards, but who will he
able to go over the heads of their opposition.
Ed Voss at center reaches G feet 6 inches above the ground. Jim Pollard,
last year's frosh sensation, combs his hear 6 feet 5 inches up. Howie Dall
mar, Menlo transfer, scales 6-4. Bill Cowden and Don Burness, the co-cap
tains and returning all-southern division veterans, were the big men on
last year's team, rising well above 6 even, but now they are the stubs.
These shorties open against the Olympic Club next week in a pre-holi
day preview of the coming hoop season.

IJOING a complete about-face from the all-American team, I just se
lected a few lines up, my idea of the true all-American aggregation
would be to take the first man drafted at each position of the National Pro
grid moguls at their annual meeting next month. Of course this excludes
juniors and sophomores and guys that have definitely stated that they want
no part of pro ball, but, on the whole, it is quite comprehensive.

D°77 forget to go to the ball game tomorrow. We play the University
of California in the stadium at 2:00 p.m.

These shorties open against the Olympic Club next week in a pre-holi
day preview of the coming hoop season.

IJOING a complete about-face from the all-American team, I just se
lected a few lines up, my idea of the true all-American aggregation
would be to take the first man drafted at each position of the National Pro
grid moguls at their annual meeting next month. Of course this excludes
juniors and sophomores and guys that have definitely stated that they want
no part of pro ball, but, on the whole, it is quite comprehensive.

¥>ANDOM thoughts in the middle of a busy Bigame Week that have
nothing to do with Bigame: Perfect Pete Kmet won a spot on the
U.S.F. all-opponent team just by sitting in the press box watching the
Card-Don fracas. I guess the Rilltoppers figured that an injured Kmet in
the stands did them more harm than most other halfbacks on the field in
good health .... Bill Leiser reminds me of Fred Allen, or vice versa . . . .
24-year-old Lou Boudreau's appointment as Cleveland's manager makes
one wonder why a girl on the second floor of Roble shouldn't take over
when Dr. Bailey steps out .... San Jose State's frosh track team next
spring will be able to give the Indian varsity a terrific battle. The Little
Spartans have enrolled this year the men who were the best performers
in six events in California high school circles last year .... Southland
sports fans will be overjoyed to hear lhat Braven Dyer, longtime grid ex
pert for the L.A. Times, is back on that paper's payrolls, after having been
exiled for several years due to his acceptance of a small piece of change
from Lou Daro for publicizing the rasslers .... this could go on indefi
nitely .... my nomination for the best hop-scotch played in school—
Kenny Davidson.

17 VERY man has his all-American ideas, but most of them don't have any
space to put it in. I've got some ideas and I've got space:
Left end—Charley Anderson (Ohio State)
Left tackle—Dick Wildung (Minnesota)
Left guard—Chuck Taylor (Stanford)
Center—Ray Jankins (Missouri)
Right guard—Ray Frankowski (Washington)
Right tackle—Alf Bauman (Northwestern)
Right end—Jap Davis (Alabama) ■ -
Quarterback —Bill Dudley (Virginia)
Left half—Special Delivery Jones (Pittsburgh)
Right half—Broken Jaw Sinkwich
Fullbaek—Steve Lach (Duke)
For coach on my team I'd have Frankie Albert of Stanford.

J AST year Stanford had the smoothest basketball team seen in these
u parts in many a long year. When they met the Giants of the Palouse
(W.S.C.) on a strange court last season this smoothness did them little
good. All year long they struggled with inferior teams which had only a
height advantage.
This season Kenny Davidson, Fordy Anderson, and Hon Williams, the
smooth boys, are gone. In llieir place have come big men who can't go
around and through their opponents like the '41 Cards, but who will he
able to go over the heads of their opposition.
Ed Voss at center reaches G feet 6 inches above the ground. Jim Pollard,
last year's frosh sensation, combs his hear 6 feet 5 inches up. Howie Dall
mar, Menlo transfer, scales 6-4. Bill Cowden and Don Burness, the co-cap
tains and returning all-southern division veterans, were the big men on
last year's team, rising well above 6 even, but now they are the stubs.

smooth boys, are gone. In llieir place have come big men who can't go
around and through their opponents like the '41 Cards, but who will he
able to go over the heads of their opposition.
Ed Voss at center reaches G feet 6 inches above the ground. Jim Pollard,
last year's frosh sensation, combs his hear 6 feet 5 inches up. Howie Dall
mar, Menlo transfer, scales 6-4. Bill Cowden and Don Burness, the co-cap
tains and returning all-southern division veterans, were the big men on
last year's team, rising well above 6 even, but now they are the stubs.
These shorties open against the Olympic Club next week in a pre-holi
day preview of the coming hoop season.

IJOING a complete about-face from the all-American team, I just se
lected a few lines up, my idea of the true all-American aggregation
would be to take the first man drafted at each position of the National Pro
grid moguls at their annual meeting next month. Of course this excludes
juniors and sophomores and guys that have definitely stated that they want
no part of pro ball, but, on the whole, it is quite comprehensive.
