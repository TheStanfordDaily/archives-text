# Fireboys Top Kappa Sigs For Third Straight Title
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
When Firehouse's "Wee Wyland" Cripe kicked a thirty-yard field goal
in the final game of the I!M1 intramural football season to win the title from
Kappa Sigma. 9 to 7, lie not only handed tin* blaze chasers their third
.straight crown but lie also wrote finis to one of the most successful mural
seasons in Farm history.

Fifty teams answered Manager
Bob Burnett's initial call early in
October, and until the final on No
vember 15, some 400 Stanfordites
played in th touch tackle race.
At that there was never much
doubt that the Firehouse would re
peat. From the beginning of the
season it was evident that the com
bination of the Ply 1 brothers, Kauf
man, Cripe, Kruger, Farrell and the
rest were probably set for the final
tilt.
The only game during the regular
season which had the Firehouse in
any kind of trouble was that first
tilt with the Fiji bunch. That 7 to 0
win was the smallest margin that the
Fireboys won by, except in the hair
raising final.
KAPPA SIGS SECOND
Kappa Sigma was the team that
almost turned the trick. Frank Wells
brought his knowledge of football
fresh from the position of frosh line
coach. Instilling some hard blocking
and nice pass receiving in his team
mates, Wells led the Rowmen to
four straight wins in the regular
playoffs.
During that time, the 'T' that the
Kappa Sigs used balked but once,
against a fighting Delt team that held
it to a scoreless deadlock in their
first tilt. In the next shot the Kappa
Sigs were better by two touchdowns.
One other team, Business school,
sparked by passer Bill Tweedie and
general-all-around-general George
Jedenoff, was a standout this year.
The dopesters had it. figured out that
the Businessmen would only be
around to let the Zetes and Delta
Chis breathe on them in breathers.
Biz School H, Zetes 7. Biz School G,
Delta Chi 0. That was the sorrowful
story for the Selby and Hanlon
crews. It was also the story of a
money team that was in the race
throughout until Kappa Sigma fin
ally beat them 12 to 7 in the best
game of the playoffs, excepting the |
final, naturally.
LEAGUE OUTCOMES
League I
Firehouse won the title with four
straight, the Fijis hanging around in
second spot for the slip that didn't
come. Firehouse represented the
league in the finals, and Monte Pfyl
and Tom Kruger won places on the
AII-Intramural first team.
League 2
The Toros, sparked by Bob Mont
gomery and Bob Morton, came
through to the finals, only to get
bounced by the? Pollardi/.ed team
from from Delta Kappa Epsilon, 7
to (5. Montgomery was placed at
halfback on the first all-intramural
team for his outstanding play.
League 3
Sequoia, sparked by Bill Desser,
and El Cuadro with Emmett Laid- |
low, produced the only league tie of j
the season. Both entered with three I
wins and one loss, and the playoff j
sent the Cuadros into the champion- j
ship, (5 to 0.
The Alpha Delts sent them right |
back again, 9 to 0.
League 1
It. was all Kappa Sigma in this !

circuit, with Wells and Jack Harris
leading the team into the final tilt
where they outplayed the Firehouse
for three quarters. The aforemen
tioned players won spots on the all
intramural first string for their ef
forts, and John Brooke landed a
center spot on the second squad.
League 5
Business school reduced the efforts
of some fine ball players to beat
them here. The Zete and Delta Chi
quints were both capable of doing
well in the finals and this league
was the toughest race of the year.
George Jedenoff rated first string
honors from this bracket.
League (Â»
Delta Kappa Epsilon and lanky Jim
Pollard coasted to the crown in this
race. Pollard got plenty of support
from Jack Clark's spot passing. The
combination ran the Dekes into the
play-offs, where they had the misfor
tune to draw the Firehouse bracket.
If they hadn't drawn this way, the
Dekes were capable (perhaps) of
tripping either the Business School or
Kappa Sig outfits. Pollard rated first
string end on the star list for his ef
forts.
League 7
Breakers, with the perambulating
of stocky, swift Bruce Clark were
too much for their colleagues from
Beta, D.U., and Chi Psi. Clark landed
on the second string honor list after
he and his teammates were eradi
cated in the first playoff tilt. 20 to 0.
by the siren-winding machine from j
Firehouse.
League 8
Alpha Delts with Dee Howe and j
a good passing attack got through
this league unscathed, but after top
ping the Cuadros, they met Kappa [
Sigma and went home on the short
end of a 13 to 0 count.
Eneina Leagues
In the frosh tangles, teams from
4W and 2E were standouts. The 2E's !
took the cake in bracket No. 9, and
Chuck Hopper and his team won the
honors in No. 10. Eneina Basement
was the other strong team in the
lodge, but not good enough to stop
the 4W squad. Hopper led his 4W
mates to the Eneina title by beating 1
the 2E septet by a touchdown in the
playoffs.
Referees for the season were Jack
Randall, Bill Joslyn, Leo McCaffrey,
Thor Peterson, and Stan Owen.
