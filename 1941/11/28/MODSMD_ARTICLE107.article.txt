# Indian Cross Country Squad Loses to Cal
## Bears' Dewey Takes First Place in Race On Farm Golf Course 
### 
California's cross-country squad
nvaded the Farm yesterday, and
mtran the Indians over their own
*olf course to lake the annual meet.
Dewey of the Bears took first
place, with Francis Olscn of the
Cards second.
With the Big meet over, there only
â€¢emains the* encounter with San Jose
next Tuesday before the 1941 varsity
iross-country season becomes ;
thing of the past. Although the rec
>rd of the varsity is not particularly
Impressive, if judged in the win anc
o.ss column, i! cannot be said tha
he season has been a failute.
CONDITION KLNNFRK
The purpo:;r> of cross country i:
primarily to condition the runners
or tie track meets to be held in tht
sprin r. In this r spect, then, the pas
season must be looked upon as a suc
cess.
In the first meet of this year wit!
U.C.L.A., the Indianmcn placed the
first three men well up in the toj
positions and only failure of the last
two men to finish higher, cost them
the meet.
With Francis Olsen leading them,
the Cardinals could never be count
ed out of the picture. Behind him
were Russ Collier and Wyland Cripe
FROSH LOOK GOOD
From the performance on this
I year's freshman squad, the varsity
j next year should be much stronger
with replacements such as Larry
Gray and John Fulton. These two
men commanded the first two places
J in all of the four meets that the frosh
participated in.
In the first two events, with Lowell
and Santa Maria High Schools, the
Papeese emerged victorious, but
j Santa Maria, in a return match, car
i ried off a close decision, and the San
Jose State freshmen barely nosed
! out the Papoose team to climax the
season.
