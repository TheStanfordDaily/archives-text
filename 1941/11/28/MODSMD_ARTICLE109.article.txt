# Net Squad Called 'Best In History'
## Coach Lamb Predicts Successful Season; Schroeder Is Star 
### 
With the statement that this year's
Stanford tenuis team is "the lines!
in the school's historj Coach Johnny
Lanil) of the Farm net squad yester
day summed up the outlook on the
Stanford tennis horizon for the com
ing season.
The big gun on this year's team
as L imb pointed out, is, of course
Ted Schrocder. Schroeder is prob
ably one of tlie two or three best
amateur tennis players in the coun
try and this summer in the semi
finals of the nationals took Bobby
I>ii4gs, the man who whipped Frank
Kovacs in four sots to win the title
the next day, to five sets before
finally yielding the match.
Schroeder and Jack Kramer, hi. l
doubles partner, have swept all dou
bles opposition throughout the coun
try iuring the last two years. Thb
fact seems to indicate that the tenta
tive doubles team of Schroeder ant
Charley Hutchison should not do toe
badly for the Farm netsters.
Number two man on the Cardinal
squad at the present time is Emery
Neale, bin lanky junior who eleanee
up in the Pacific Northwest thi:
summer.
DEE. WADE GOOD
Neale, however, will undoubtedly
be hard pressed for that second spot
by Larry Dee and Jim Wade. Det
has been the stellar man on the Stan
ford team for the last two seasons
and has often proved that he is best
under pressure. This was amply
demonstrated by the way in whicl
he whipped Don McNeill, 1940 na
tional champ, in the Southwest tour
nament last September.
Wade is the "dark horse" of the
squad, and though his qualities as ;
doubles player teamed with Dee art
well known, he has never quite livec
up to expectations. Coach Lamb
however, says that Wade is possibly
the most improved man on the squac
and may well turn out to be tht
surprise package of the year.

In addition to these four men
there are a half dozen more capable
men on the team whom Coach Lamb
says are capable of being "top men
on almost any conference team in
the nation." These include Andy
Roberts. Tom Kruger, Chuck Hop
per, Ben Olsen, Jack Gurley, and
Emery Rogers. It might be noted
that three of last year's letter-win
ners. Tom Kruger, Charley Hutch
ison, and Jack Gurley, are not even
cimong the team's first six players
in early season rankings.
CHANCE FOR STUDENTS
Coach Lamb also emphasized the
fact that with a team of the caliber
of this year's squad students can
sec some of the best tennis in the
world merely for the price of coming
out and rooting for the team. He
further stated that "like any other
major sport, tennis needs as much
support as Stanford can give it.
The prospects of the frosh squad,
Coach Lamb continued, are just as
good as those of the varsity. With
three topflight players, Ted Myers,
Dick Thomas, and Bob Rutledge, all
vying for the number one position
tlie Farm freshmen tennists should
have little trouble in establishing
their supremacy in their own circle.
In relation to team tennis, the an
nual Hahn tennis tournament will
again be run this year. It is open to
all players who have not earned a
letter or numeral in the sport and
will begin after the first of the year.
All those interested can sign up
either with Bob Preble or in the
gym.
