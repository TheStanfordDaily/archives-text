eague games the Indian kickers
have not fared so well. They lost
two of the three nonschedule games

the British sailors 1-0. The Indians
defeated the Bruins on the home
ground 3-1.

U.S.F. The Indians broke this tXj in
the second league game with San
Francisco State by beating them 2-1.
In the third game, which was
played with Cal Aggies. Stanford put
on the pressure and came out with
a 4-1 victory.
TOUGHEST GAME
In the toughest game of the sea
son. with San Jose State, last year's
champions, the Cardinals emerged in
another tie. This 1-1 deadlock will
not be replayed unless San Jose
and Stanford are tied for the league
lead. The Indians played to a 1-1
tie in the San Mateo game.
On Tuesday Coach Harry Maloney
fielded two teams in two league
games. Team A beat the visiting San
Francisco J.C. 3-0 but team B again
drew a 0-0 tie.
The game played last Tuesday
against S.F.J,C. was the best exhibi
tion of soccer the varsity has giver 1
this season. They played as a team
and that mutual understanding and
coordination, especially among the i
forwards, which is so necessary for
victory was very noticeable.
