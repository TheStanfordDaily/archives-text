### DON SELBY 
JjT WOULD certainly make this whole Big Game situation much simpler
if we knew who was going to play for Stanford.
Cal, they say, is all leady for its best game of the season. Yell, hut
what about Stanford? Going into the final day before the "big push."
the ability of Pete Kmetovic and Milt Vucinich to play as long as they
are needed was still undetermined, although it appeared fairly definite
that both boys would he in shape to see some action.
You just cannot figure what the Indians will do tomorrow. You don'l
know who will man the posts, and on this Model T that makes a creat differ
ence. If it's Frankie Albert, Kmetovic, Eric Armstrong, and Vucinich
behind the regular Stanford line, you can expect the regular speed and
fancy passing attack that the Cards have used in the majority of their
games this year.
But, on the other hand, if the Indians go to the post without the services
of injured Kmetovic and Vucinich, the chances are it will be a power attack,
along with the regular passing pattern. For Bob Crane and Bill Sheller, the

likely replacements, definitely aren t
breakaway backs.
Even WITH Kmetovic and Vuci
nich, no one knows—that is, no one
besides the coaches and the team—
whether the Indians will use the tail
back set-up with the speed back,
Kmet, Armstrong, or Fawcett in the
middle position and the power backs
at the halfback spots, or whether it'll
be the orthodox set-up. Stub Allison
doesn't know either. Maybe Clark
Shaughnessy doesn't even know.
So, you see, there are any number
of ways the Indians might appear for
the start of the game, and any num
ber of ways their formation might
change after the game gets under
way. It's all so uncertain.

•" Allison's up-and-coming charges
must use to down a Stanford team
that was a 2 , '2-to-l favorite last
night has been a subject of great
controversy for the past two weeks.
Seme have said that passes, early
in the game when the Stanford de
fense is loose, will turn the trick.
Others have come to the conclusion
that the California power attack
the cut-backs inside and and
the straight-ahead drives down the
middle—will do the greatest good
for (he Blue and Gold.

We're not going to put in our two-bits worth on that score for the
simple reason that we do not think it will be any one phase of the game
that decides the winner. It can't be in this game of football.
Billy Reinhard, who probably won't start at left half tomorrow because
A1 Derian is ready to go, pitched live complete passes in seven attempts
while the Bears were going down to a G-0 defeat at the hands of Oregon
State two weeks ago. He may be able to do as well against Stanford, for
the Indians' pass defense has not been the most outstanding part of Stan
ford's game.

On the other hand, it was primarily offensive power on the part of
Oregon State and Washington State that gave the Big Red Machine its
two set-backs this season. And Cal has a certain amount of power.
Yet, when you figure it out, you just about have to agree that the
aerial and the ground games have to work together before either is ef
fective. Perhaps the Golden Bears will be able to put their passing and
running attacks together in such a way as to get the most out of it.
Then, will they be able to score fast enough to wind up with more
points than a Stanford eleven that will go into the game with the repu
tation of having the ability to tally from any place on the field more
often than any other outfit on the Pacific Coast?
If you can rely at all on past performances, Stanford should be able to
score more touchdowns than California.

Granted that California has a tough defensive forward wall. The Indian
offense, for the most part, has not gone for huge chunks of yardage inside
the tackles this season. It's the wide stuff and the passing that has made
the Model T roll.

Stanford has a great passer. There's no denying that. Frankie Albert,
playing his last Big Game, is as gcod as they come, far superior to the Cal
pitchers, A1 Derian, Hank Zacharias, and Reinhard. In Freddie Meyer and
Amie Meiners, in Bob Mastin and Hank Norberg, in Pete Kmetovic, Hoot
Armstrong, and Buck Fawcett, Stanford has some better-than-average pass
receivers. The Albert-to-Meyer and Albert-to-Kmetovic combinations
have been functioning for four years, having started when those three boys
played freshman football together.

We've already mentioned how, if Kmet's okay, Stanford will go wide of
Cal's strong forward wall. Fawcett and Armstrong could do it, too. If,
however, Cal goes into that four-man line we've heard so much about,
those power backs may come in mighty handy. Stanford certainly has the
plays to hit at any weak spot the Cal defense might have, and Albert can
detect those weaknesses well.

I* ET'S TALK about this Stanford line. Everyone, or nearly everyone says
1 it's underrated, but in so saying probably gives it enough publicity to
let all the rest of the grid fans know that it is a pretty good forward wall.
To put it in black and white, and briefly, senior ends Arnie Meiners and
Freddie Meyer are great! So are junior tackles Ed Stamm and Bruno
Banducci, junior guard Chuck Taylor, sophomore guard Loren LaPrade,
and senior Vic Lindskog. And you almost have to count Hank Norberg,
junior, end. as a first stringer. We think they're all okay.
That's the Stanford line that will go against the Berkeley Hears come
2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

We think that line and the great Stanfrd hackfield can and will take
care of Cal tomorrow. Score: 20-7.
Come on .Oregon!
