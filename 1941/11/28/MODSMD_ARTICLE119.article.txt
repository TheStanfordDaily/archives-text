HOOT ARMSTRONG, shown above on his (59-yard .'aunt to a touch
down against U.S.C. as Doug Stahle block*, g< es into tomorrow's game
with a slnghtly weak ankle but shculd be at top speed nevertheless.
California Iks pes nnt to see any of this, but Hoot wouldn't mind giving
a lepeat performance. Will he get the chance?
