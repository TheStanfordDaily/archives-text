### JACK CUDDY 
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.—(UP)—The'
football season makes an end run to
a grand finale this week, with plenty
of dynamite sprinkled on four fronts
in a quartet of encounters that may
be listed as follows:
(1) The annual clash between the
service academies, Army and Navy,
will be staged before the season's
largest crowd, 98,497 fans at Phila
delphia's Municipal Stadium Satur
day. The reason the attendance will
be under 100,000 is because service
officials requested that temporary
stands at the open end of the stadium
not be erected this year. Navy will
be a heavy favorite, since it was
beaten only by Notre Dame and tied
by Harvard, whereas Army was tied
by Harvard, lost to Notre Dame and
Pennsylvania and barely beat West
Virginia. In this 42nd meeting be
tween the two schools. Navy will be
trying to win its third straight vic
tory.
BRAWL IN OREGON
(2) Oregon State engages Oregon
in a neighborhood brawl that will
decide the Pacific Coast Conference
championship and western repre
sentation in the Rose Bowl. The
game will be played at Eugene,
Ore., before a capacity crowd. If
Oregon State wins this last game of
its season it will be recognized as
Pacific Coast champ and Rose Bowl
defender, even if Stanford—the lone
contender—beats California. The
reason being Oregon State's previous
victory over Stanford, last year's
champ and Rose Bowl victor.
(3) Championship of the South
eastern Conference — the strongest
league in Dixie—will be 'decided by
the clash between Mississippi State
and Mississippi at Oxford, Miss. The
Maroons and Rebels are tied for the
lead.

♦ Navy clash will be (he traditional
i 'Big Game" between Stanford and
California at Palo Alto, Calif., which
would enable the Stanford Indians
to repeat for the conference crown
and the Rose Bowl if they licked the
Golden Bears while Oregon State
lost to Orgon.
SOUTHERN CONFERENCE
A game in Dixie's Southern Con
ference also requires some spot
lighting as William and Mary tries
to beat North Carolina State, know
ing that victory will give W. and M.
a tie for the conference title with
Duke which already has finished its
i season. Should W. and M. lose, Duke
will be the lone ruler.
In addition to the Army-Navy
classic, the east offers four other ma
[ jot* contests: Boston College-Holy
Cross, Fordham-New York U.,
Pittsburgh-Carnegie Tech., and West
Virginia-Michigan State.
Competition in the Miawest peters
out, with the Big Ten season ended,
and with Missouri having clinched
the Big Six Title. However in the
latter conference, second-place Okla
homa meets Nebraska, last year's
champion.

(2) Oregon State engages Oregon
in a neighborhood brawl that will
decide the Pacific Coast Conference
championship and western repre
sentation in the Rose Bowl. The
game will be played at Eugene,
Ore., before a capacity crowd. If
Oregon State wins this last game of
its season it will be recognized as
Pacific Coast champ and Rose Bowl
defender, even if Stanford—the lone
contender—beats California. The
reason being Oregon State's previous
victory over Stanford, last year's
champ and Rose Bowl victor.
(3) Championship of the South
