# SMART FISH

### 
Who said fish are suckers? With
all his follow fish dying in a raging,
muddy torrent, "Junior," a healthy
fourteen-pound catfish, found in a
puddle in a corn field, apparently
thought the going was too tough, and
as a result of his migration is now
"doing nicely," thank you, according
to Charles Hager, who found the fish.
