# Prospects Good For '45 Casaha

If you could pick the ten men
'most likely to succeed in frosh
hoop competition this year as rc
gaivls their showings in the first
practice sessions, you list would read
almost like the first string frosh
grid line-up.
Conditioning his frosh squad for
the opening till against Piedmont
High School on January til, Coach
Bob Burnett was especially pleased
with the showing of five griddcrs
who reported for the casaba sport
early this week.
Jack Heald, Papoose end and for-'
mcr all-state hoop center from Bil
lings, Montana. Dave Brown, an
other sterling frosh wingman from
Piedmont High, Back Fred Parsons
who started his basketball career at
Oakland High, Bob Hall, lineman
from Oakland, and Dave Brown,
lineman and former hoop star at
South Pasadena, are the five foot
ball men who are making string bids
for hoop squad spots.
Heald and Brown both played in
the National AAU tournament in
the early part of the year, reportedly
the only two high school hoopsters
to enter Ihe tournament.
Then you can't neglect other loop
men like frosh president Bill Spra
gins from Los Angeles High; Fred
Ferroggiaro from Oakland; Bob Bar
soechini, Washington High, San
Francisco; Bob Vayssie, Lowell
High, San Francisco; and Chuck
Fultz, Osawatomie, Kansas.
The above players probably round
out the first ten on Burnett's sched
ule thus far. The squad appears to
their coach to be "a pretty average
Stanford frosh team. They are a
good bunch and will play good ball.
They lack only a smooth player like
Jim Pollard ot last year's team."
The Piedmont tilt in January
opens a fifteen-game schedule that
will allow plenty of opportunity for
these and others to develop into the
material for future Stanford quints.

who reported for the casaba sport
early this week.
Jack Heald, Papoose end and for-'
mcr all-state hoop center from Bil
lings, Montana. Dave Brown, an
other sterling frosh wingman from
Piedmont High, Back Fred Parsons
who started his basketball career at
Oakland High, Bob Hall, lineman
from Oakland, and Dave Brown,
lineman and former hoop star at
South Pasadena, are the five foot
ball men who are making string bids
for hoop squad spots.
Heald and Brown both played in
the National AAU tournament in
the early part of the year, reportedly
the only two high school hoopsters
to enter Ihe tournament.
Then you can't neglect other loop
men like frosh president Bill Spra
gins from Los Angeles High; Fred
Ferroggiaro from Oakland; Bob Bar
soechini, Washington High, San
Francisco; Bob Vayssie, Lowell
High, San Francisco; and Chuck
Fultz, Osawatomie, Kansas.
The above players probably round
out the first ten on Burnett's sched
ule thus far. The squad appears to
their coach to be "a pretty average
Stanford frosh team. They are a
good bunch and will play good ball.
They lack only a smooth player like
Jim Pollard ot last year's team."
The Piedmont tilt in January
opens a fifteen-game schedule that
will allow plenty of opportunity for
these and others to develop into the
material for future Stanford quints.
