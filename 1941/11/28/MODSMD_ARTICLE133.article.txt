# Baseball Team Loses Veterans
## 
### 
Hope springs eternal at sometime
: for most coaches, but the well will
have to bo mighty deep to produce
i the goods for Harry Wolter, Redskin
j varsity baseball coach, The veteran
Stanford mentor lost almost a whole
! club through graduation and the
; Armyâ€”only three regulars return
next spring: Ace Hanlon, catcher.
! Boch Caruso, second base, and Ray
! Hammett, first baseman.
Remaining from the varsity also
are Harry and Jack Parsons, Clark
J Graham, and Carl Kellenberger, due
to report at school in the spring,
j Kellenberger was out last year, but
Wolter expects the hard-hitting
i fielder to do plenty at the plate this
I season.
Look at this list of lettermcn that
Wolter lost, and you'll see why the
| r ndian coac'n is looking for some new
blood: pitchers Claude Purkitt and
j Cootie Thompson, fielders Hal Cos
j ello and Alec Cereshino, shortstop
; Monte Pfyl, and catcher Jack Ran
i dall.
But we've got frosh coming up,
| thousands of 'cm.
