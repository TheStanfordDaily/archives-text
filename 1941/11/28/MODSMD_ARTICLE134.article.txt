## 
### 
Although he a (en in every game on their extended eastern tour, the
Stanford Polo Team, under the coaching t>f Lieutenant Robert A. Itnn/oni.
will climax a fairly successful season this afternoon when they meet a
j University of Utah outfit.
The Cards played the Utah outfit Wednesday and won to the score of

I ?.~2. Ben Snure, number lour man
j for the winners, was high man with
j five goals.
Today at Ihllft sharp on the high
way polo field the Indians again
meet the Utes. This being the last
game of the current quarter sea
son Lieutenant Kan/.oni promises
I a wide open game. Lineups:
STANFORD L'TAII
Green I Glas'man
Dirker 2 Smith
Gates :$ Morte.sen
Snure 4 Flandro
Starting to roll early in the season
wi*h victories over the Pogonip Polo
Club and the Cal Aggies teams, the
I Redskins showed better form as the
season progressed. Aside from the
! Universities of Arizona and the New
I Mexico Military Institute, the Pogo-
I nip Club is one of the toughest out
! fits the Cards have met. The Stan
j ords defeated them twice in as mam
| starts.
PROVE THEY'RE GOOD
The team personnel, including
Denny Green at the number one po-
I sition, Bill Dirker at number two.
Mike Gates at the number three
spot and Ben Snure at back, proved
lhat they could play real polo when
I hey wanted to. A couple of second
team men, Bob Kumler filling in for
Green at the number one spot, and
Ralph Grana who worked at the
number four position in placc of Ben
Snure, proved that next quarter
they will give the first team men a
tough battle for their positions.
The Hayward Club, made up of
business and professional men from
;he Bay District, always showed the
Ranzonimen a hard riding game. The
j hree Aldarette brothers and Dr.
! Cambell who ride for the Hayward
| bunch have been playing polo to
| gether for quite some time.
In collegiate games, however, Lt.
j Ranzoni's team only met one other
j western college, the Cal Aggies team
from Davis. Playing inspired hall
whenever they met the Redskins, the
Aggie mallet wielders usually went
out in front of the Stanfords in the
openings chukkers. Led by "Killer
Bill" Dirker, however, the Farm
! boys were usually able to come back
in later chukkers to close the lead
■ and tic up the game. Nasty weather
and a wet field handicapped the polo
| players during their second series
; with the Cal Aggies team and nu
, merous spills led almost to a Stan
' ford defeat.
UPSET SAN MATEO
In their series with the San Mateo
team, Lt. Ranzoni's players pulled
j an upset when they sank the favor
ites on their home field. A bunch of
oolished polo players, the San Mateo
| bunch weren't as tough as they
looked when they went up against
j the Cards.
The only piiiful part of the season
was the Indians' travels over the
■ Thanksgiving holidays. Losing every
; game of the series, Stanford poloists
I seemed to miss their plays on strange
fields. Meeting Arizona twice, once
on Turkey-Pay and then two days
later, the men from Palo Alto just

weren't anything against the cowboy
team.
BLINDED BY DUST
In their second series with the New
Mexico Military Institute, the In
dians were blinded by the dust as
•he gentlemen from Roswell rode by
scoring goal after goal. The N.M.M.I. I
team is perhaps one of the best col- '
legiate teams of the country and
with every player asleep in the sad- i
die, or so it seemed, Stanford didn't
:ven get in a prayer to win.

will climax a fairly successful season this afternoon when they meet a
j University of Utah outfit.
The Cards played the Utah outfit Wednesday and won to the score of

I ?.~2. Ben Snure, number lour man
j for the winners, was high man with
j five goals.
Today at Ihllft sharp on the high
way polo field the Indians again
meet the Utes. This being the last
game of the current quarter sea
son Lieutenant Kan/.oni promises
I a wide open game. Lineups:
STANFORD L'TAII
Green I Glas'man
Dirker 2 Smith
Gates :$ Morte.sen
Snure 4 Flandro
Starting to roll early in the season
wi*h victories over the Pogonip Polo
Club and the Cal Aggies teams, the
I Redskins showed better form as the
season progressed. Aside from the
! Universities of Arizona and the New
I Mexico Military Institute, the Pogo-
I nip Club is one of the toughest out
! fits the Cards have met. The Stan
j ords defeated them twice in as mam
| starts.
PROVE THEY'RE GOOD
The team personnel, including
Denny Green at the number one po-
I sition, Bill Dirker at number two.
Mike Gates at the number three
spot and Ben Snure at back, proved
lhat they could play real polo when
I hey wanted to. A couple of second
team men, Bob Kumler filling in for
Green at the number one spot, and
Ralph Grana who worked at the
number four position in placc of Ben
Snure, proved that next quarter
they will give the first team men a
tough battle for their positions.
The Hayward Club, made up of
business and professional men from
;he Bay District, always showed the
Ranzonimen a hard riding game. The
j hree Aldarette brothers and Dr.
! Cambell who ride for the Hayward
| bunch have been playing polo to
| gether for quite some time.
In collegiate games, however, Lt.
j Ranzoni's team only met one other
j western college, the Cal Aggies team
from Davis. Playing inspired hall
whenever they met the Redskins, the
Aggie mallet wielders usually went
out in front of the Stanfords in the
openings chukkers. Led by "Killer
Bill" Dirker, however, the Farm
! boys were usually able to come back
in later chukkers to close the lead
■ and tic up the game. Nasty weather
and a wet field handicapped the polo
| players during their second series
; with the Cal Aggies team and nu
, merous spills led almost to a Stan
' ford defeat.
UPSET SAN MATEO
In their series with the San Mateo
team, Lt. Ranzoni's players pulled
j an upset when they sank the favor
ites on their home field. A bunch of
oolished polo players, the San Mateo
| bunch weren't as tough as they
looked when they went up against
j the Cards.
The only piiiful part of the season
was the Indians' travels over the
■ Thanksgiving holidays. Losing every
; game of the series, Stanford poloists
I seemed to miss their plays on strange
fields. Meeting Arizona twice, once
on Turkey-Pay and then two days
later, the men from Palo Alto just

weren't anything against the cowboy
team.
BLINDED BY DUST
In their second series with the New
Mexico Military Institute, the In
dians were blinded by the dust as
•he gentlemen from Roswell rode by
scoring goal after goal. The N.M.M.I. I
team is perhaps one of the best col- '
legiate teams of the country and
with every player asleep in the sad- i
die, or so it seemed, Stanford didn't
:ven get in a prayer to win.
The Stanford R.0.T.C., however. 1
provides Farm polomen with one ol I
ihe best coaches in the country and
some of the best horses to play on.
