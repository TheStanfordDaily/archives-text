# Will Jurkovitch Play in Big Game?
## 
### 
A startling possibility was set |
forth in bay area football circles j
yesterday, when the rumor that j
California's ox-star, jolting Jim J
Jurkovitch, might play in the Big i
Game popped up again. It was j
learned that the Bears' team physi- j
cian. Dr. James Harkness, has found
the star to be in perfect condition
and able to play.
The rumor says lhat both the doc
tor and Coach Stub Allison said the
boy could play. This news carried
along with it the revelation that the i
original order to remove "Jolting
Jim" from gridiron competition per
manently came from some higher
source than the coaching staff. This j
higher source is presumably Presi
dent Sproul's office, but Dr. Sproul i
is in the East so no further evidence 1
in the matter could be uncovered.
Coach Allison said that there j
would be no further attempts to
have the original order rescinded. I
However, the rumor still persists,
and there is no definite proof that i
it is not true.
