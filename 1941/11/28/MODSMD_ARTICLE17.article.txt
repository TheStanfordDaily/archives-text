Your Pals, The Dance Committee

Some 1000 Stauford students are
expected to answer this invitation
pasted on their car windshields and
trek to the San Francisco Golf and
Country Club tomorrow night for a
gala post-game celebration lasting
from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.

Located on the outskirts of San
Francisco, the club is situated on
Junipero Serra Boulevard at the
San Mateo-San Francisco county
line. The adjoining map supplies

DIXIELAND SWING
Offering sharp contrast will be
the Dixieland rhythms of Lu Wat

perts. This sensational group, who

issue of Downbeat magazine. They
are now appearing at the Dawn
Club in San Francisco.
With the famed Stanford Axe as
the principal item of interest, deco
rations will also include such acces
sories of the gridiron as footballs
and goal posts. Refreshments will
be available to the dancers through
out the evening, but there is a club
rule against serving them free.
THREE BALLROOMS
To accommodate the large crowd,
three large ballrooms and an out
door patio will be used for dancing.
The facilities of two lounge rooms
will be available to guests who wish
to change to semi-formal dress at
the club. Ample free parking space
is also promised to patrons.
The Big Game Dance is a compar

activities, having been started a few
years ago, but its popularity has as
sured its being an annual event. The
dartce, sponsored by Cardinals, is
the only official, all-Stanford cele
bration held after the Big Game.
