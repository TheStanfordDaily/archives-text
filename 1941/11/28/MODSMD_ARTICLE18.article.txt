Lock your door and put the key
in your pocket during the Big Game
week-end, warned Gordy Davis,
campus policeman.
Precautions should be taken by
all living groups against possible
burglars and housebreakers, Davis
said. He requests that each frater
nity and sorority arrange to have
the cook or some member of the
house remain at home to answer all
doorbells. There have been cases
where houses were entered and
clothing taken because no one was
in the house, Davis said.
Keep personal valuables in a safe
and secure place, since there will be
thousands of people in this commun
ity even before Saturday, Davis
warned.
Commenting on the traffic situa
tion, Davis stated that student resi
dents should park their cars off
Lasuen Street to give friends, rela
tives, and visitors a place to park.
