# Speech Service Serves Vicinity
## Requests Forecast Busy Speech Season 
### 
The true answer lo a program
chairman's prayer, the Stanford
Speakers Service, sends out men
and women students to talk to over
100 organizations all over the Bay
Area. The speakers address a po
tential audience of one and one-half
millions, in individual audiences
varying in number from 100 to over
500.

With the new roster printed and
distributed, a booming season is in
evitable for the Speakers Service,
judging by the number of requests
pouring in for student speakers.
Student turn-out and interest is the
highest in years, according to the
club's faculfy adviser, Professor
Claire Loftus. Mrs. Loftus deserves
the credit for insisting on the very
highest standards of speaker per
formance, according to Frank Bau
man, student manager.
NEW NAME
At present the Speakers Service,
formerly known as the Speakers'
Bureau, boasts some 35 members
who speak on subjects varying from
"The Lost Island of Mu" to "Sports
Freaks of 1940.''
George Jackson; A.S.S.U. presi
dent, in his speech on "A Senior's
Reverie," evaluates the opportuni
ties one should expect to receive
from a college education. Activities
of the Speakers Service, according
to the student body president, are
among the most valuable in which
he has participated.
MANY SUBJECTS
"Model T" on the Stanford Lawn"
is the title of a speech in which
Colin McClintock, former football
star and past secretary of the In
terfraternity Council, analyzes the
groundwork of a football renais
sance.
Frank Bauman, student manager
of the Speakers Service, is always
willing to talk over the club's ac
tivities with those interested.
GOOD CONTACTS MADE
"The Speakers Service," accord
ing to Bauman, "enables the stu
dent to build valuable contacts
which are often useful after he
leaves school. I know of no better
way, excluding athletics, for a Stan
ford student to obtain off-campus
recognition."

The immense popularity of stu
dent speakers illustrates the genuine
interest people in the Bay area have
in Stanford. Hie demand for speak
ers has always exceeded the supply.

Through the co-operation of the
Stanford debate squad the Speakers
Service also offers special forum and
debate programs.
