# Figgins' Fooling, Chappie Proves
## 
### 
The final Chappie of the fall quar
ter will go on sale next Wednesday
morning at 8 and under the care
and efficient salesmanship of the
Roble queens.

"It is the last bit of humor that
will have nerve enough to present
itself on the Stanford campus in
face of the coming exams," said
Barney McClure.

The two-color cover by Bob
Reiser shows what Santa is apt to !
bring with the help of the war and !
the new excise tax.

While many indignant women on
the Stanford campus have been
rather vainly trying to refute the
letter in Campus Opinion which
was written by a somewhat bitter
Horace Figgins, the Chappie in its
regular feature "Queens of the
Month" shows proof that Higgins
is in error.

In 1939 H. F. Wolf won the Na
tional Squash Singles championship
for the tenth annual time.
