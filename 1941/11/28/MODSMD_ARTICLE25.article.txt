# General Calls Japan's New Move Fatal
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Japanese expansion in the South
Sea area may well be the death
knell of Nipponese aggression, de
clared Major General Pei-Lan
Chiang, Army of the Republic of
China, yesterday in an exclusive in
terview to The Daily while visiting
friends in Palo Alto and on a tour
of the Stanford campus.
He was accompanied by Mr. Wu,
Chinese ambassador to Denmark,
and Mr. Shoo, president of the
Bank of China in New York.
As the fateful question of war or
peace in the Pacific hourly grew
more acute, accentuated by massing
of Japanese troops on the Thailand
border, General Chiang reiterated
statements made by him in the
China Monthly:
SOUTHWARD THRUST
"In case of a southward (Japanese)
thrust, any strong obstacles en
countered by her will immediately
place her in an embarrassing posi
tion, and might well lead to her
detriment. For then, China would
be in a position to muster her main
forces and block the retreat of the
invading Japanese forces. Even if
Japan should gain some initial suc
cess in the South Sea area, she would
have to lose whatever she had
gained in the l'our-year struggle
with China."
He added that a favorable turn in
the international situation will mean
that China will launch a total of
fense that may well be the death
knell of Japanese aggression.
"Japan now considers the spread
ing of the European war as rw op
portunity to expand her own sphere
of conquest."
WAR OR PEACE
Ambassador Wu, asked if war or
peace will result from eleventh
hour conferences of President Roo
sevelt and Secretary of State Hull
with Ambassadors Kurusu. and No
mura in Washington, said:
"Now it's up to Japan. We will
adopt the (Japanese) policy of 'wait
and see'."
General Chiang, who recently flew
here by clipper from Chungking,
will proceed to New York on a mili
tary mission. Ambasr.ador Wu, re
called to Chungking because of the
war, will sail in "about three weeks."
The three luminaries, accompanied
by their wives, visited the Leung
family, proprietors of the Mandarin
Grill, Palo Alto.

Japanese expansion in the South
Sea area may well be the death
knell of Nipponese aggression, de
clared Major General Pei-Lan
Chiang, Army of the Republic of
China, yesterday in an exclusive in
terview to The Daily while visiting
friends in Palo Alto and on a tour
of the Stanford campus.
He was accompanied by Mr. Wu,
Chinese ambassador to Denmark,
and Mr. Shoo, president of the
Bank of China in New York.
As the fateful question of war or
peace in the Pacific hourly grew
more acute, accentuated by massing
of Japanese troops on the Thailand
border, General Chiang reiterated
statements made by him in the
China Monthly:
SOUTHWARD THRUST
"In case of a southward (Japanese)
thrust, any strong obstacles en
countered by her will immediately
place her in an embarrassing posi
tion, and might well lead to her
detriment. For then, China would
be in a position to muster her main
forces and block the retreat of the
invading Japanese forces. Even if
Japan should gain some initial suc
cess in the South Sea area, she would
have to lose whatever she had
gained in the l'our-year struggle
with China."
He added that a favorable turn in
the international situation will mean
that China will launch a total of
fense that may well be the death
knell of Japanese aggression.
"Japan now considers the spread
ing of the European war as rw op
portunity to expand her own sphere
of conquest."
WAR OR PEACE
Ambassador Wu, asked if war or
peace will result from eleventh
hour conferences of President Roo
sevelt and Secretary of State Hull
with Ambassadors Kurusu. and No
mura in Washington, said:
"Now it's up to Japan. We will
adopt the (Japanese) policy of 'wait
and see'."
