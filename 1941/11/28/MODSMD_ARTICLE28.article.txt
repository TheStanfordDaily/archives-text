# Axe, California Rivalry Have Colorful History
## Gridders Now Vie For Traditional Farm Symbol 
### HAP EVERETT 
For fifty years the two greatest schools in the West have been at each
other's throats.
Stanford and California have battled it out in a dozen different sports
for half a century and a great tradition has grown up around the rivalry,
not <;nly statistical but legendary.

Old-timers have a hard time
agreeing on the details of the first
two decades but out of the dim nine
ties the fantastic tale of the Stan
ford Axe unfolds, probably the most
picturesque symbol of rivalry any
where in U.S. college life.

Stanford still has an edge on the
Bears in total Big Game competi
tion. The boys from the Farm got
off to a good start in winning the
very first football game between the
Iwo schools in 1892 but everything
except the outcome seemed to go
wrong that day. At first Roble girls
doubted the propriety of attending
the game, but the Cal women as
sured- the 500 that it was the thing
to do.

This was on a cold day at the old
Haight Street grounds in the city.
Seven thousand fans, at four-bits
apiece, filled the park and had to
wait until 4:15 for someone to hunt
up a ball, for neither team had both
ered to bring along a pigskin!
In the very first few years of Stan
ford's existence, the Indians held
their own in competition with the
bigger, older California. The Cardi
nal baseball team, for instance, lost
only one series until 1899.
CAL EYES STANFORD
AS BUNCH OF HICKS
It didn't take long for a good
hatred to be worked up between the
two student bodies. Cal looked down

on the new upstarts from the Farm,
considered the Cards a bunch of
hicks, and were confident of Berke
ley's great preponderance of num
bers. But just to make sure we
wouldn't give too much trouble in
1804, a disgruntled Cal man shot
three Stanford players with a re
volver. The three were Whitehouse,
varsity tackle, McMillan, a guard,
and Rosenfeld.
"Since there were no deaths the
affair was hushed up and settled
out of court," Archie Rice, '95, tells
us.
In 1899 came the turning point of
the great Stanford-Cal rivalry. In
that year, a tragedy struck the Farm
when George Beckett, captain and
star pitcher on the baseball team,
died before the season started. A
symbol of some kind was needed
desperately to rekindle the spirit
and on April 13, 1899, the Axe was
born.
Three years before, Will Irwin and
Chris Bradley had introduced the
Axe yell which inspired the intro
duction of the massive hatchet. On
the eve of the Cal series, this new
symbol of Stanford spirit was sharp
ened to a razor edge on a huge grind
stone and then used to chop off the
head of the Golden Bear effigy, while
the wild-eyed student body went
crazy with revamped enthusiasm.

AXF, TRAVELS TO
1899 BIG GAME
The great red Axe went with Stan
ford to the game, guarded by a group
of four strong men to whom it had
been entrusted by Billy Erb and
Frank English, who had originated
the idea. Stanford lost the game
but a far greater tragedy was to
befall the Cardinals.
California stole the Axe and a fight
began which raged over San Fran
cisco for seven hours. The last Stan
ford man to be torn from the blade
was Tom McFadden, 200-pound
tackle. Cal men started relaying the
Axe through Chinatown and across
town to the ferry. Once a Stanford
hurdler named Stout, who had been
biding his time, was handed the Axe
unwittingly by Bill Drumm of Cal;
but the wonder quarterback of
Berkeley, Jimmy Hopper, caught
Stout from behind with a flying
tackle in the middle of San Fran
cisco. "Crazy Joe" Hamilton made
Stanford's last bid when he took on
a whole streetcar load of Cal men
who had just chopped off the handle
of the Axe in a Chinatown butcher
shop.
In the next few days in Berkeley,
Harry Dutton had his hands on it
twice only to succumb to the huge
weight of numbers. A raid was
staged on the Chi Psi house where

Charlie Pringle, football captain
and first custodian of the Axe, lived
and the house was actually torn
apart in vain. The Axe was lodged
firmly in the vaults of the Berkeley
American Trust.
Will Irwin's famous battle of the
Senior Fence was a fruitless Stan
ford victory. It was Will's idea to
capture this trophy of Cal's and hold
it as hostage, but for some strange
reason the men of Berkeley allowed
Stanford tcr keep and burn the fence,
and the Axe continued to reside in
the vaults. For years ingenious
schemes were put into effect and
brute force raids were carried out,
but to no avail.
RIVALRY CONTINUES
IN ALL SPORTS
Meanwhile the two schools were
battling it out on the gridiron, dia
mond, track, field, courts, course, in
the pool and gym. One year Cali
fornia students attacked the new
Stanford scoreboard and tore it
down. Another fall, Locomotive
Smith, Cal's backfield ace, was
found coaching Oregon on the side
and was declared out of the Big
Game; whereupon the Bear rooters
went on strike and almost broke up
the game.
Stanford has had many great
coaches in the last half century. One
early coach was Walter Camp of

Yale who originated many common
things in football including the idea
of Ail-American. He has often been
called the father of modern football
and was considered the official Ail-
American selector until his death
when he gave the right to Grantland
Rice.
Then Stanford was coached by
Fielding Yost who also mentored
San Jose where he dug up Willie
Heston, the greatest center of all
time with the possible exception of
Mel Hein. Willie was the Michigan
sensation in the old days and was
taken back to the Middle West by-
Yost when he left the coast.
WARNER DEVISES
THE "DOUBLE WING"
Later on Stanford had the services
of Andy Kerr, who now tutors Col
gate in his famous wide-open game.
Andy paved the way for Pop War
ner. 'Ol Glenn Scobey was probably
the greatest of them all. He and
Knute Rockne developed the two
main systems of the time, the double
wing and the box respectively. Stan
ford came to be associated with the
double reverse while Santa Clara
under Clipper Smith used the Notre
Dame system.
And Santa Clara was once our
biggest rival. California just before
the first World War was playing
American football while Stanford
stuck to rugby. Therefore, gridiron
relations were severed for a few
years and the Cardinals concentrated
on Santa Clara, a natural rival lo
cated only 16 miles away. Oldtimers
claim that Stanford fans used to
stand for the entire game when we
played Santa Clara.
When we resumed our Cal scries
after the war, the Bears had pow
erful teams with such men as Archie
Nesbit and Brick Muller and Duke
Morrison and Charley Erb. They
walloped Stanford in '22. But about
this time interest in football rose to
great heights. Owen Merfrick of the
old San Francisco Journal describes
the increasing interest in the Cal-
Stanford game as the big tussle west
of the Rockies. People naturally
wondered how a little school like
Stanford could beat huge California
in their first year and win every
football game up until 1898. The
"Big Four," Yost, Stagg, Warner,
and Camp all were vitally interested
in Stanford.
BIG GAME RIVALRY
ALWAYS "RED HOT"
When Camp headed the coaching
staff in 1894, Captain Downing, Stan
ford right tackle, blocked one of
"Wolf" Ransom's kicks when things
looked bad for the Red team. Coch
ran, the other tackle recovered, and
Kennedy converted for a Stanford
victory. That was the year Stagg
brought his Chicago team out for
the first East-West intersectional
battle featuring Hirschbergcr, the
star of the Maroon.
Right from the start Big Game
rivalry was red hot. One account
says "there wasn't more than the
usual amount of slugging, gouging,
and choking," something the old
timers arc inclined to doubt.
Hurry-Up Yost brought great
Michigan teams, including the point
a-minute Wolverines, to the coast
and played Stanford. Warner, who
on the eve of the '22 Big Game, was
rejoicing over his Pittsburgh boys'
defeat of mighty Washington and
Jefferson, awaited the word on Stan
ford's strength for he was to come
and join his lieutenants the follow
ing year at the Indian helm.
INDIAN BRINGS
HIDDEN BALL PLAYS
In 1922 one of Pop's boys at Car
lisle came to Stanford as trainer.
He was Wallace Denny, an Oneida,
who remembered the old hidden
ball days at Indian school. Bud
Woodward was the fighting quarter
back that year, Art Wilcox did the
kicking, and Murray Cuddeback did
the fullback chores.
These were strictly Cal years. In
1921 the Bears inaugurated our now
Stadium for us with a 42-7 win and
followed it up the next year with a
four-touchdown triumj Vi.
Then all of a sudden Stanford
started turning out teams that
couldn't lose to Cal. In 1924 the
greatest game ever played anywhere
ended the Bear streak which had
dominated the Big Game since the
war.
Stanford went into that game
without the services of the great
Norm Cleaveland. An inspired team
led by Murray Cuddeback battled
the Bears to a 20-20 tie, coming from
behind with an aerial attack which
was climaxed when Cuddcback
added the decisive extra point in the
waning minutes. Without exaggera
tion, old timers tell you people act
ually fainted.
"THE GAME" STARTS
CARD SUPREMACY ERA
That was THE game of history.
Babe Horrell was played off his feet
by Stanford's Baker. Tod and Harry
Shipkey played side by side and
were sensational. Jim Lawson played
about the best game of hris career.
And Cal s tiny "Tut" Imlay was far
overshadowed by the brilliant Cud
dcback.
From this game Stanford was su
preme until 1931. Hank Schaldach
led Cal to victory that year with
Phil Moffatt riding the Stanford
bench.
Then came a rugged band known
as the "Immortal 21," Sequoia
roughs who recovered the Axe for
Stanford after 33 years of imprison
ment. They were organized by Don
Kropp in 1927 and were really a
bunch of die-hards. Twice thev had

been within an ace of recovering the
weapon. Moroni Jameson actually
carried the Axe into the bank but
was so surrounded that he could not
escape. A second raid was almost
successful but a body of Berkeley
reserves arrived in time to beat off
the attackers.
At one time the Berkeley cops had
taken the side of the Stanford raid
ers for they preferred anyone to the
rampaging Cal men who turned over
and burned streetcars in the beloved
city of Berkeley.
FATEFUL THURSDAY;
THE "21" START OUT
Tli en on the fateful Thursday
morning the "21" slipped quietly,
away from the campus in three cars.
They rented a fourth car in Oakland.
Occupants of one car went directly
to the Greek Theater, the second
group joined the Cal frosh in their
march to the bank, the third parked
two blocks from the bank, and the
fourth was stationed right at the
bank.
All but live of the men at the rally
edged their way to positions close to
the ceremonies. Ten minutes before
the rally closed, the remaining five
left the Theater to take up posts
near the armored car. These were
the fake cameramen, who delayed
proceedings so that the other con
spirators could join the frosh guards
on the car's running boards. As soon
as the car pulled away, the "camera
men" raced back to the bank.
When the car arrived at the bank
they started asking for pictures
again and as the custodian stepped
out of the armored car onto the
sidewalk, a flash-bulb exploded right
in his face. A Stanford man jumped
down ofT the top of the car, wrenched
the Axe from the custodian's hands
and passed it through several hands.
The last Stanford man to get it
calmly tucked it under his sweater
and walked to his car and drove
away.
NATION HEARS OF
AXE RETRIEVAL
At Stanford people went crazy.
City papers carried banners on the
front page and the whole nation
knew about it. The Indians played
way over their heads that year and
fought off the valiant Schaldach for
a scox-eless tie.
The Axe then became a trophy to
be retained by the winner of the Big
Game each year.
And these are the men that
brought the Axe back to Stanford.
Sequoia's Immortal 21: Howard
Avery, Gerald Bettman, Robert
Loofbourow, Matt Lehmann, Eric
Hill, Louis Ferrino, Gordon Snod
grass, Warren Gage, Abe Jensen,
Raymond Walsh, Donald Kropp,
William Everwine, Robson Taylor,
John Coons, George Kikens, Glen
ford Brunson, Arthur Miller, Jim
Trimmingham, Henry Powell, Ed
ward Soares, Robert Gordon.
As soon as football alone became
the way to determine possession of
the Axe, Stanford came up with the
greatest group of natural athletes
the coast has seen. They didn't need
coaching and would fool around until
the last minute or coast along on a
few-point lead.
VOW BOYS WIN
ON FEW POINTS
Stanford was favored one year to
beat S.C. by at least three touch
downs and in the last thirty seconds
Moscrip cooly kicked a field goal for
a close u-0 win. That's the way the
Vow Boys were in every game, never
winning by more than a few points.

But they beat Cal and kept the
Axe at Stanford for three years. A1
Norgard, an end who caught a Big
Game touchdown pass from Alustiza,
was declared ineligible in 1933, but
Cal did not contest the result of the
Big Game that year.
In 1934 Carl Schott kicked what
proved the winning field goal as
Moscrip sat on the bench. Bones
Hamilton, who was awarded the title
of most valuable player in the coun
try, smashed across for the only
touchdown in this game.
EXPLOITS OF GRAYSON
COFFIS AND CO.
In the last regular game for the
Vow Boys, Grayson crunched ovei
on fourth down to climax a tre
mendous drive of 75 yards, and
Jimmy Coffis sailed through Larry
Lutz, Cal's All-American tackle, on
a reverse to score standing up. That
was about as big a score as the boys
ever ran up in their three years,
13-0.
Between the Vow Boys and the
Wow Boys, Cal reigned for four
years with the Thunder Team of
Meek, Bottari, Chapman, Herwig,
Schwartz, and the other fine Bear
players of '37 and '38.
The low point of Stanford's re
cent football fortunes came two
years ago when the Bears trounced
the Indians 32-14 with people
streaming on the field with a minute
and a half to go and Stanford get
ting hot. Albert, who in those days
traded off with Pete Kmetovic at
left half, tossed two beauties to Fred
Meyer in the waning minutes while
frosh Chuck Taylor policing the goal
posts, battled furiously to keep Cal
rooters out of the end zone.
Everyone knows the story of last
year's "rags-to-riches" deal and
everyone realizes how Stanford
needs this game tomorx-ow.
