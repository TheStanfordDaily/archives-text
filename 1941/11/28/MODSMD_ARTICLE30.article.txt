# Ex-Farm Men To Fly to Game
## 
### 
Nut satisfied with the week-end
vacations their companies allowed
them, twenty young executives of
Southern California's aircraft firms
will attend the Big Game in style.
They have chartered a plane for the
occasion and will be viewing the
Gaieties only a few hours after they
leave work this afternoon.

Their air limousine will be
awaiting them after the Big Game
to deliver them to Del Monte and
will stay there until they are ready
to return south Sunday afternoon.

Those on board the huge Douglas
transport will be Ernie Clark, Deke,
captain of the 1941 Stanford track
team; Bob Mallet, Chi Psi, star of
several Gaieties of the past; John
Shallenberger, Phi Delt, former
sports editor of The Daily and the
Stanford Quad; Bill Lee, Zete; Stan
Smith, Kappa Alpha; Sid Hayes,
Zete, star hurdler of recent Stan
ford track teams; Lee Champion,
Beta, varsity soccer man of 1940;
Howes Grady, Chi Psi, and Harry
Elmond.

The southern guests have re
quested Gaieties performers by tele
gram to withhold the best acts for
the last and to excuse them if they
do not arrive for the opening cur
tain.
