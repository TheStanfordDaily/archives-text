# Students Urged To Walk to Game
## 
### 
Along with 90,000 persons who are
expected to scream in the Stanford
stadium tomorrow will be a galaxy
of other screamliners to fire up the
Big Game spirit.

Twenty-five thousand Stanford-
Cal programs, dressed in the color
ful Fiftieth Anniversary theme, will
be on sale for 25 cents each, said
Don Litbendorfer, publicity direc
tor for the Board of Athletic Con
trol.

"Students living on campus should
leave their cars at home and walk
to the stadium," urges Liebendorfer.

"Students will benefit very little
from driving cars to the game, as
entrances to the stadium area will
be blocked."
