# Card Stunts for Big Game!
## 
### 
"You can just say 'Konko thiH
Rally Coinmiltcc' at (his stage of
the game, I guess," Mickey Levee
bluntly came out and said.
"But we have really got some
good card stunts figured out for to
morrow's game and the band has
arranged a nifty half-time program.
But then all you have to do is look
outside at this puzzling weather
and remember the Santa Clara
game."

The Rally Committee members
were all working like beavers. Be
cause of a . shortage of the black
cards which are necessary in the
card stunts for eyes and ears and
noses, part of the group were paint
ing up some white cards with some
thing that looked Like black axle
grease.
DRY SATURDAY
"But don't worry; they'll all be
dry by Saturday. Besides it washes
right off," said several committee
people, looking like end men in a
minsti'el show.
The Rally Committee is supported
by funds from the Associated Stu
dents. Like all other committees,
they were forced to take a 15 per
cent cut in their appropriations. In
addition the difficulty in getting
cards has curtailed their activities
somewhat.
LITTLE WHITE CARDS
More people were busy marking
the little white cards that you
fasten under the collar of the person
sitting below you. With incredible
rapidity they went through pile
after pile, one card for each Stan
ford Rough. Since there are about
ten to fifteen stunts, they have to be
gone through time after time.
"The percentage of errors is very
small. You see we work out each
stunt on a piece of graph paper. Each
little square represents a rooter,
so it's fairly easy to keep track of
what color for what stunt belongs
to which person sitting where."

"The rally committee was not the
author of that little gem: The In
dians Threw Rocks at Columbus,'
contrary to what the public thinks
about us." Levee emphasized this
point by banging on the A.S.S.U.
conference table with the butt of his
six-shooter, which he carries in or
der to keep things under control.
IMENE, MENE . . .
"And as for 'Mcne, Mene, Tekel,
Upharsin,' well, that's some more
of this anonymous, pseudo - rally
committee stuff. We wouldn't touch
the idea!"
Asked how one of the younger
committee members received a rath
er large, blue bruise around his right
eye, somebody answered, "Oh, him?

â–ºHe got in the way of the paste pot."
"But seriously," Levee concluded,
"the rally committee has been work
ing very hard on the stunts for Sat
urday, and we think th# students
will like them. If it only doesn't
rain!"
