# Capital Weighs Strike Action
## Congress Overlooks Bright Labor Scene 
### 
Congressional action for anti
strike legislation moved apace on
Thursday despite the brightest over
all defense-labor scene in many
weeks.
From the White House came the
surprising announcement that Pres
ident Roosevelt considers the Na
tional Defense Mediation Board in
tact and operating. He refused to
accept resignations of CIO President
Philip Murray and his colleague,
Thomas Kennedy, secretary-treas
urer of the United Mine Workers,
who bolted the N.D.M.8., when it
ruled adversely on the U.M.W.
closed shop demands at captive coal
mines.
Meantime, the presidential arbi
-1 tration board of three members sped
I through deliberations designed to
j settle the captive coal mine dispute
I once and for all. The board in
j vited "Little Steel" firms to submit
I arguments opposing the miners'
closed shop request. There was no
announcement of progress.
J SPEED ESSENTIAL
The House Labor Committee, tak
i ing testimony on proposed strike
restricting lesgislation, received a
warning from administration lead
ers that speed was essential, else
the job might be assigned to another
House committee.
Senator Tom Connally, D., Tex.,
urged support of his measure ex
tending executive authority to seize
plants harassed by strikes or lock
outs. The National Manufacturers'
Association recommended action
outlawing mass picketing, strikes
for closed shop or jurisdictional pur
poses, and permitting bargaining
elections by secret ballot only.
Representative Robert Ramspeck,
D., Ga., claimed administration sup
port of his proposal fixing mutual
negotiation, conciliation and media
tion as proper settlement procedures,
which upon exhaustion would pro-

cccd to a presidential board whose
findings would be binding. If the
workers refused this decision tHey
would lose their rights under the
National Labor Relations Act, and
other labor-protecting legislation.
AFL President Willi;,|i Green
appeared in opposition to all such
proposals, as had CIO officials Wcd-
I nesday.
| Major strike threat remained at
Pacific Coast shipyards, where 25,000
I independent welders threatened to
I strike more than $1,250,000,000 of dc
j fensc ship construction if alleged
, AFL discriminations and "abuses"
