# Stanford Hits Warpath at Rally, Burns Bear on Pyre
## 5,000 Chant as High Flames Light Card Victory Spirit 
### BILL HORNBY 
Leaping llames and Iho chanting of 5,000 of the
faithful tolled the death knell of (lie (.iolden Bear as
the traditional Big (Jaine flame ritual, the Bon Fire
of !<)tJ. passed into history last night in Lagnniln
♦lakehed.

High Priest Bill Spragins of the
freshman firemakers lit the fuse of
the very adequate collection of |
wood, privies, tailors' dummies, gate
posts, fences, etc., at 9:15 a.m. to
complete a day of activity for the
Class of 1943 which began at G
o'clock yesterday morning. As the
fire swept to its height and the cof
fin of the skulking Berkeley bear
was engulfed, a night of continuous
support of Stanford's T grid ma
chine concluded with yells, fire
works, and music by the Stanford
band.
Prior to the lighting of the fire,
the annual guard was posted. A
wavering searchlight kept illuminat
ing the surrounding bushes for
signs of organisms from East Bay,
seemingly not too impressed by re
peated promises of the titular heads
of both schools that all raids were
out. And from most of the frosh
guards down to the various moppets
on the fringes trying to stir up ex
i citement by yelling "Cal MEN," a
slight of air of nostalgia was detected
| for the good old days when there
: really were Cal men behind the
bushes.
But nary a one of the varmints ap
peared to mar the Class of 1945 from
! completing successfully their hered-
I itary debt to Stanford.
Lacking the social connections of
their immediate predecessors which
produced 10,()00 beer cases for last
j year's fire and hampered by defense
I priorities, the freshmen, under the
general chairmanship of Chuck
j Smith, Phi Delt, produced a just
! anything - that - will-burn-fire that
met Farm standards for what a darn
good blaze should be.
FIRE BEGINS
First step for the combustion col
lectors un(4t-r Ben Parkinson yester
day morning was the flume ditching
I and pole planting to the tune of
j Roble doughnuts at 7 a.m. Com
bining steel and hands, the struc
ture was dug, pushed up, and be
ginning to be filled when the fe
! males produced -sandwiches and
dilute (very dilute) coffee for the
noon meal. Main engineering feat
of the day was the Egyptian pyra
mid method used to hoist the best
| sanitary facility available to its
I doom.
By 6 o'clock when the guard was
| posted, the events were under con
| trol with most of the wood fleet
commanded by Ralph Bjorkland and
Ralph Kewitt. done with their Pen
' insula wood winning trips.
Head hasher for the fest was Doris
! Dolan of Delta Gamma, and A1 Haas
' and John Cull took care of details
[ like oil for the burning spirits and
! road beds for the sinking trucks.
The manna for the workers came
j from Stanford sororities and A.S.S.U.
i bonfire funds. Associated Oil gave
the sound truck that boogied and
| woogied for the laborers in the early
hours and mouthpieced for Messina
at the gathering, and Shell Oil chip
pod in with the fireworks. Horabin
Oil Company of Palo Alto again gave
the fire oil, and P. G. & E. gave
the pole framework and the ditch
digger, which only arrived about
! two hours too late.
