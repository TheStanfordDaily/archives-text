# Floats Roll Down Row Before 6,000
## Lagunita Spectacle Takes Sweepstakes; SAE Wins for Men 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Even the rain couldn't drench the
spirit of 6,000 Farm students and
Paly citizens as a half-hundred floats
rolled down the Row last night in
the Fifth Annual Big Game Float
Parade.
From the beautiful to the hilarious,
the floats depicted "Stanford's Fifty
Years," and of course, the "Beat- I
kill Cal" theme, finally degenerat
ing to a play on being censored.
Judged unofficially the entire
length of Lasuen, the parade was
appraised officially from the steps
of the Post Office where Professors j
Elmer Fagan, Tom Barkley, and Rix
Snyder named the winners.

nita women in a "T" formation fol
lowed the float and chanted. "Keep
the Axe,"
The Delmar T. Israel loving cup
