### AMIE REICHERT 
FSTERDAY it appeared that
Japanese - American relations
were strained almost to the breaking
];( int. There have been a dozen
J; , e alarms ever since the confer
e -s between Roosevelt, Hull, No
; .ira, and Kurusu started. One day
they say it will be war, the next
d..y they are sure it will be peace—it
,i > most disconcerting to say the
least.
Official Washington has hereto
fore done little to dispel the mys
tery which has surrounded the
«enferences, but in view of the
most recent developments in the
situation the general Washington
opinion seems to be that the war
< r peace issue is now in the bal
ance ami will be decided within
tlw next few days.
Night before last Secretary Hull
. .• the Japanese an outline of
America's demands — Nipponese
withdrawal from the Axis, and from
China. These, it is reported, are to
b the only conceivable basis for
si t.tlement of the Far East crisis.
* * *
tT.VERAL days ago word came
k from the nation's capitol of a
ti uce proposal which the U.S. was
t( offer Japan. The plan would have
meant ;i three-month breathing spell
in which normal trade relations be
tween the two countries was to be
resumed, and Japan was to refrain
from any further aggression.
But this proposal was abandoned
at the last minute partly because
Doctor lln Shih, Chinese Ambas
sador, conferred with the Presi
dent. and he made it clear that the
Chinese regarded the proposal as a
betrayal of their cause.
'the ultimatum which Hull de
livered to the Japanese—and which
has not as yet been answered—
forces a show-down on the issue,
v. hich is probably much the hest
way.
The three-month truce, while it
ild probably work advantageously
both sides, would in the long run
1. a measure of appeasement for
pan. It would give her time to
:isify her preparations, build up
1 r economic reserves (with U.S.
1- < ) and watch which way the
\ i I is blowing in Russia.
* $ *
o IT IS now, unless the Japa
.( se are skillful enough to hedge
; uid this one, all the questions
nt <t be answered within a day or so.
V ther the answers will be the
) it ones or not is the big mystery
now.
' me quarters in Washington
f '-ve that the Japanese answer
v be an attack on Thailand, and
fv■. in there a drive to cut the
orma Road which is the arterial
f :t !.end-Lease aid to China.
I' ident. Roosevelt's meeting with
1 n u and Nomura last night fol
-1 shortly after a new disclosure
ii. it the Japanese have massed troops
North and South Indo-China —
■J poised for the jump on Thailand
, the Burma Road.
'i he assumption in Washington
s lhat these troops would be
• vtn the go-ahead signal if and
wven the war-peace talks col
litj'sed. It seems obvious that this
•••■ •;> concentration must have
! d a good deal (o do with the
Vn stiffening of the U.S. at
titude.
•»:ilarly, the new Nazi advances
<> > Moscow must have had some
■{ to do with the intensified
.1 ! mese war preparations.
* * *
*''! IS not at all out of the ques
■>ii that the Japanese govern
-•■•I ' at home will order their am-
I ridors to attempt some sort of
< 1 ; omise—at least a truce in or
to keep the talks going while
Japanese can watch and wait.
'I'ii I is, of course, what they have
be'.-ii doing for months now.
» it they will have to be pretty
< • ver to word their proposal in
' !> a way as to make it accept
. !i'e for the U.S. For Hull has
ii a made the position of this na
-I<on quite clear and our demands
d > net in the least sound like the
kind thai can be met half-way or
iidtd over with compromises.
