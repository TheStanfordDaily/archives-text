# GAIETIES CREW PERKS UP
## 
### 
Last night they rehearsed the
Gaieties for the last time.
They—Ash Wilson, Frank Hurt. F.
Marion Scott, Art Hansen ami a host
of other people who have worked
like automatons I' >r most of this
quarter—didn't seem too happy lie
fore last night's final rehearsal. As
one of the Gaieties' moving forces
Frank Burt remarked about 7:15
o'clock yesterday evening, "Well, you
know rehearsals, some parts good,
some parts had." There was d'ouht,
plenty of doubt, in Burt's voice.
And that was just about how most
of the rest of the Gaieties' crew fell.
The rehearsal Wednesday night hud
not been too good. Things were
doubtful.
This was before last night's re
hearsal. At about 11:30 yesterday
svening a vast change had come
across the Gaieties' bosses. A con
fident belief in the show had sud
denly sprung up. There was no
doubt. Every person in the cast from
Asher Wilson down felt that this
year's Gaieties is terrific. "And,"

as one of the feminine stage crew
members blurted out, "it is."
Everyone was serious last night.
There wasn't any "horsing around."
Offstage, voices were subdued, faces
were straight. It was obvious that
this was the "perfection or bust" re
hearsal. Wilson was playing it close
—and Wilson was playing it neat.
For that is exactly the way the
rehearsal turned out. It was neat.
That was the opinion of those who
had fingers and a lot more in the
show and that was the opinion of the
half dozen or so impartial observ
ers who were scattered around the
theater yesterday evening.
Barbara Moore's "Love in Our
Time," Bob Breckner's "Dozen
I Woman Man," Dori Redmon's "Body
by Fisher," Dolph Arias's Latin
dancing, the Kite and Key Quartet's
[ close harmony, the stunning sets,
and about a hundred ana one oiner
smoothly integrated features of the
I show seem to substantiate the con
: lidence on the Gaieties' front which
I bubbled forth late last night.


"AND I'LL lIAUNT YOU if you aren't coming to (he Biff Game Gaieties, and I'm pretty horrible," so John
High, the Gaieties Quasimodo, warns the campus. Ilal Leavitt did the make-up. "Quasi" points to the "V—
for Victory and for Varsity" number which will open this year's show.

hearsal. Wilson was playing it close
—and Wilson was playing it neat.
For that is exactly the way the
rehearsal turned out. It was neat.
That was the opinion of those who
had fingers and a lot more in the
show and that was the opinion of the
half dozen or so impartial observ
ers who were scattered around the
theater yesterday evening.
Barbara Moore's "Love in Our
Time," Bob Breckner's "Dozen
I Woman Man," Dori Redmon's "Body
by Fisher," Dolph Arias's Latin
dancing, the Kite and Key Quartet's
[ close harmony, the stunning sets,
and about a hundred ana one oiner
smoothly integrated features of the
I show seem to substantiate the con
: lidence on the Gaieties' front which
I bubbled forth late last night.


"AND I'LL lIAUNT YOU if you aren't coming to (he Biff Game Gaieties, and I'm pretty horrible," so John
High, the Gaieties Quasimodo, warns the campus. Ilal Leavitt did the make-up. "Quasi" points to the "V—
for Victory and for Varsity" number which will open this year's show.
Last night they rehearsed the
Gaieties for the last time.
They—Ash Wilson, Frank Hurt. F.
Marion Scott, Art Hansen ami a host
of other people who have worked
like automatons I' >r most of this
quarter—didn't seem too happy lie
fore last night's final rehearsal. As
one of the Gaieties' moving forces
Frank Burt remarked about 7:15
o'clock yesterday evening, "Well, you
know rehearsals, some parts good,
some parts had." There was d'ouht,
plenty of doubt, in Burt's voice.
And that was just about how most
of the rest of the Gaieties' crew fell.
The rehearsal Wednesday night hud
not been too good. Things were
doubtful.
This was before last night's re
hearsal. At about 11:30 yesterday
svening a vast change had come
across the Gaieties' bosses. A con
fident belief in the show had sud
denly sprung up. There was no
doubt. Every person in the cast from
Asher Wilson down felt that this
year's Gaieties is terrific. "And,"

as one of the feminine stage crew
members blurted out, "it is."
Everyone was serious last night.
There wasn't any "horsing around."
Offstage, voices were subdued, faces
were straight. It was obvious that
this was the "perfection or bust" re
hearsal. Wilson was playing it close
—and Wilson was playing it neat.
