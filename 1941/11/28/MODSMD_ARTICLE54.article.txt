AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 28.—While a
plurality of college students favor
voluntary class attendance, the latest
Student Opinion Surveys of America j
poll discovers that nearly as many
would rather be required to sit
through lectures and attend labs.
Some colleger and universities
have followed the lead of such
schools as the University of Chicago,
allowing students to report for class
work; at their discretion. Chicago's i
President Robert M. Hutchins re
ports that the plan works. But it has
not been adopted in the majority of
/higher learning institutions. The
idea, the figures below indicate, is
approved by nearly half of the col
legians. but it certainly does not
have the wholehearted approval of
student opinion:
"Do you think students should be
required to attend classes a minimum
number of times, or do you think
class attendance should be volun
tary?"
Require minimum 41$' j
Voluntary 4X% j
Require only some students. 11%
(Less than 1 per cent failed to ex
press an opinion.)
Interesting differences of opinion
are brought to the .surface when the I
ballots are cross-tabulated by year !
in college. Sophomores and juniors—
a majority of them—are the most 1
eager to have complete freedom:
