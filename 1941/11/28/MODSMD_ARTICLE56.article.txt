### 
United Press Summary-:
New German advances in heavy
[fighting both north and south of
Moscow increased the Red capital's
peril yesterday while in Libya the
deseil battlefield became an "every
j man's-land" as fighting swirled back
and forth on a shifting front
'stretching from Egypt to Tobruk,
i The bright spot of still indecisive
I fighting in Libya was a dramatic
dawn meeting 17 miles southeast of
Tobruk between the British garri
-1 <on of that besieged city and New
Zealand imperial forces which had
fought their way from E-jypt along
the coast and then veered into the
desert where the main battle was
being fought.
The juncture of the Tobruk and
imperial forces was across the nar
| row gap running east and west be
tween Tobruk and Sidi Rezegh,
through which Axis forces in eastern
Libya had been receiving supplies
and which was the only avenue of
escape for these Axis forces unless
they broke through the British lines.
