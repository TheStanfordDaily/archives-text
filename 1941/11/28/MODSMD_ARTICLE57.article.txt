# PACIFIC CRISIS HANGS IN AIR

WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (UP).—I
j Japanese - American "pence" talks, i
reportedly on Lhe verge of collapse, !
shiited to the White House today
when President Roosevelt and Sec
retary of State Cordell Hull met with j
' Japanese envoys Saboru Kurusu and '
! Kichisaburo Nomura.
When the 45-minute parley broke ,
, up there still was no answer to the ,
j fateful issue of peace or war in the
Pacific.
That answer may come in Tokyo's
| reply to American demands, lodged i
| last night, that Japan withdraw front ;
the Axis and get out of China as j
a basis for dealing with the Far East i
j crisis.
Authoritative quarters believed j
Japan's answer may be an attack on '
Thailand and a subsequent attempt j
to cut off the Burma Road—feed
line of American war supplies to ,
embattled China.
r This view was based on advices
that Japan is concentrating troops |
land ships in Indo-China on the'
; fringe of Thailand. But whether
this was Japanese saber-rattling or;
j an actual threat no one could fore- i
tell.
