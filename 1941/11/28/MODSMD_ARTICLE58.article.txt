### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 27 (UP).
I â€”Writer Vincent Sheean returned
from the Orient today and described j
transportation conditions on fabled
Burma Road as "outrageous," with i
j movements of war supplies bogged
down by delays, taxation and red
j tape.
Sheean was pessimistic regarding j
U.S.-Japanese relations. He said j
Saboru Kurusu regarded his mis
sion actually as intended to break
j off negotiations between the United
I States and Japan.
Sheean predicted a break would
occur between the U.S. and Japan
| next week, and the next move "will
I be up to Japan."
