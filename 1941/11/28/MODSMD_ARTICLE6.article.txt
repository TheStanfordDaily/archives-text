TIMES CORRESPONDENT
Duranty, who was correspondent
for the New York Times during
World War I, went to Russia during
the early days of the Lenin gov
ernment, and through the last 20
years has become the most authori- j
tative news writer on Russian af- I
fairs in the world.
When the present Russ-German i
hostilities broke out last June, Du
ranty, in the face of almost unani
mous military and political opinion,
slated that the Russians would stem 1
the onslaught of the Nazi legions,
through the winter, and had an ex- '
eel lent chance of being first to beat j
them.
FIRST PREDICTION
With his first prediction now close
to proved fact, Duranty will speak j
on the war between the Nazis and 1
the Soviets as it stands at 8 o'clock
on Jan. 14. At the conclusion of the
lecture he will allot time for a ques
tion period by members of the audi- 1
ence.
Author of the hest-selling auto- \
biography, "I Write As I Please,"
and the equally well-known fiction
work, "One Life, One Kopek," he I
has gained the reputation for out
spoken honesty, even under censor
ship, and brilliant analytical news
coverage. He was awarded the Pu- i
litzer prize for journalism for his
coverage of the Moscow Treason
Trials.
The lecture will not only be open
to students, but to Peninsula resi- ;
dents as well, and tickets will be on j
sale at the various Peninsula
