# An Emphatic "No"

### 
WTS the Stanford spirit a myth?" A distraught
1 Rally Committee asked this question a few
weeks ago.
At that time our answer was an emphatic
"no."
Yesterday at eleven o'clock, when there were ,
about thirty frosh out just starting to build the
Bonfire, we wondered whether there was going
to be any Bonfire or any spirit at all. Maybe j
we are just getting old and the spirit of the
Bonfires of four years ago has grown in our
minds like a legend—hundreds of frosh out
working, extra-length telephone poles not being
long enough, and all the other things that seem
to have been in the "good old days."
Maybe this superficial lack of spirit was just
the effect of growing pains—growing away
from the old practices of inter-campus raiding,
vandalism, and all that went with such useless
exertions of misdirected "spirit."
We are sure these growing pains will be gone
v/hen the next Big Game week rolls around.
Even at seven o'clock last night any difficul
ties there might have been were overcome.
Many people may have thought that the so
called censorship of the floats in the Big Game |
parade, would make the event less appealing
to students though it might not now offend the
general public. As a matter of fact, the way it
worked out, the parade this year showed more
originality of thought and more unique floats
than any parade in the past.
Who said anything about the "good old
days"?
And the rally.
Last night's rally in the Pavilion was a top- !
notch Big Game rally. Hundreds were refused
admittance. The Pavilion was filled to capacity.
The yells must have been heard on the Berkeley
campus. Bill Leiser, Sergeant Casey, Dana Win- j
ters —they all helped to make this one of the
best among Big Game rallies.
There is no reason to say the spirit of the I
campus as a whole was not one of the best of :
Big Game history.
Rally Committee asks, "Is the Stanford spirit
a myth?"
After last night the answer is still an emphatic !
"no."
And after tomorrow, win or lose, the answer
will still be an emphatic "no."
