WHILE Big Game spirit continues to mount
toward the skies, even higher than last
night's Bonfire in Lagunita lakebed, and while
the outcome of tomorrow's classic forty-seventh
Big Game is a crucial mystery, one thing is
certain.

Stanford has already surpassed California in
interest and support evidenced in the second
year of University participation in the San
Francisco Symphony season.
Already Stanford purchases of season tickets
have reached 100 more than those of California

— this after only one year of traveling to the
city, by invitation, to hear Pierre Monteux and
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.

Farm enthusiasm, in fact, has blossomed to
the extent that Mr. Monteux has graciously con
sented to appear on the Stanford campus in the
inaugural symphony forum to be held Wednes
day night at the Delta Gamma house. This will
be the first time any such forum has ever been
held here. The nature of it will be to present
pre-symphony program notes and, if the forum
is attended in numbers, the authorities will no
doubt continue the forums during the entire
season.
Particular thanks for including Stanford in
symphony circles are due the San Francisco
Symphony Association, Mr. Monteux and Dick
Lyon, grad student in the Stanford Medical
School and campus chairman.
As this is the last Daily of the quarter, there
will be no further reminder to students of Wed
nesday night's forum, or of the inaugural sym
phony Dec. 5. But there won't need to be a
reminder because Stanford's all for it—and
we've already got the jump on the roly-poly
lowly Golden Roar. Harold Shafor
