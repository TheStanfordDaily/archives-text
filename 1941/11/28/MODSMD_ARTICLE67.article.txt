# Or Hold Your Peace

ADS never tell you anything. You've heard
that cry go up before. It's one of those
cliches which lend a certain tone of savoir
faire to those who speak the words.
Actually ads do tell something once in a
while. An important and large-sized advertise
ment in the Sports Section of this Daily tells the
Farm students what has been going on in the
financial ledgers of their Bookstore.

Take a moment and take a look. The Book
store, with this open-faced declaration of fi
nances, has just about reached the apex in a
campaign of campus education in the ways of
this co-operative organization—a campaign
which incidentally was first suggested many
times in Daily editorials. The Bookstore has
been going to extremes to tell you what you
have so long cried to know. No longer can
students moan, "Something must be fishy at
the Bookstore; they're always working behind
closed doors."

The facts are there in that advertisement. You
asked for them. Now look at them, or forever
hold your peace.—Bud Ames
