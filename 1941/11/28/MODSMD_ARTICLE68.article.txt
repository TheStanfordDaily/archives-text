chines, covers up the grut board, nails down the
typewriters and closes its doors for the rest of the
year. That leaves Bull Session nothing to do but to
quit, so we too will leave you for a while. But before
wc leave, there are a few last-minute things that we
would like to say.
In the first place, I would like to ask the B.A.C. not
to check student body cards this Saturday because
I'm going to try to sneak my little brother into the
rooting section. He loves football and it would thrill
him to sit in the Stanford section, so don't check.
Next a word to the California rooters. The a\e yell
belongs to Stanford, it is our yell and not yours, so
please let us give it. We're asking you.
To our football team I would like to wish a lot of
luck. Whatever happens Saturday, everyone in the
school knows that you are one of the best and most
interesting teams ever developed around this school.
Pour it on tomorrow and "bite 'em Bruno."
To our own rooters, holler and holler loud. This
may be the last game for the Wow Boys and our last
chance to show our appreciation. Holler and holler
loud, even though we're sitting on ihc sunny side.
To those who are going to be driving around after
the game and well into Sunday morning, drive care
fully.
One word to those who worry about finals. I mean
two words. Don't worry.
And one thing to my mother. Hurry up with my
laundiy. please.
And Santa Claus, send up a little more money in a
hurry because I'm out.
And so goodbye. I hope you all have luck during
your finals, I hope you have a fine vacation, a merry
Christmas and a happy New Year and that we'll ail
be back to stall the new year out right, together.

your finals, I hope you have a fine vacation, a merry
Christmas and a happy New Year and that we'll ail
be back to stall the new year out right, together.
this issue, The Daily silenccs the U.P. ma
chines, covers up the grut board, nails down the
typewriters and closes its doors for the rest of the
year. That leaves Bull Session nothing to do but to
quit, so we too will leave you for a while. But before
wc leave, there are a few last-minute things that we
would like to say.
In the first place, I would like to ask the B.A.C. not
to check student body cards this Saturday because
I'm going to try to sneak my little brother into the
rooting section. He loves football and it would thrill
him to sit in the Stanford section, so don't check.
Next a word to the California rooters. The a\e yell
belongs to Stanford, it is our yell and not yours, so
please let us give it. We're asking you.
To our football team I would like to wish a lot of
luck. Whatever happens Saturday, everyone in the
school knows that you are one of the best and most
interesting teams ever developed around this school.
Pour it on tomorrow and "bite 'em Bruno."
To our own rooters, holler and holler loud. This
may be the last game for the Wow Boys and our last
chance to show our appreciation. Holler and holler
loud, even though we're sitting on ihc sunny side.
To those who are going to be driving around after
the game and well into Sunday morning, drive care
fully.
One word to those who worry about finals. I mean
two words. Don't worry.
And one thing to my mother. Hurry up with my
laundiy. please.
And Santa Claus, send up a little more money in a
hurry because I'm out.
And so goodbye. I hope you all have luck during
your finals, I hope you have a fine vacation, a merry
Christmas and a happy New Year and that we'll ail
be back to stall the new year out right, together.
