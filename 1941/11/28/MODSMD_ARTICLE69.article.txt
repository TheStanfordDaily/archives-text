# CAMPUS OPINION
## SIN ANSWERS 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
Judging by "Campus Opinion" for the past couple
of issues of The Daily, Horace Figgins let himself in
tor something. Although one of the Stanford women
whom he maligned, I have known him for years, and
I'm proud to be a friend of his.

Tuesday and Wednesday you printed a couple of
verbose answers to his straightforward letter. Know
ing Horace, I doubt if they convinccd him at all. Both
letters gave evidence that the truth hurts. In each
case, the woman who attempted to prove that she
didn't have a superior attitude began with "you
poor misguided boy." Some proof. The remainder of
the letters was just as illogical; if you doubt me, say
so—l shall be only too glad to prove rny contention.

But what every Stanford woman seems to have
missed in her proud attempt, to vindicate herself is
that Horace made no claims at all for Stanford men.
To me, a Stanford woman who has had just as much
experience with Stanford as has Horace, it appears
that he did well to keep quiet.

We women have been eternally accused of being
snobbish because the ratio was in our favor. Is it in
our favor or not? Probably between a half and two
thirds of all Stanford men date Stanford women
rather infrequently. For many of the men that isn't
on account of the women; it is merely because they
are here for an education—one which they hope to
use to earn a living. Frankly, I'm sorry that I don't
see more of those fellows. There arc a few, of course,
who arc too mousy to have courage to ask for a date,
but they are so few that we can forget about them.
We do anyway.
But what is left to us after the better 50 per cent
of the men have eliminated themselves? By and
large, it is a great number of moronic lounge-lizards
who drive noisy convertibles, fancy themselves roues,
and have no purpose in attending Stanford, other than
to obtain a diploma in Social Sciences or Economics,
so that all loafing done after graduation will be done
in a cultured and worldly way. Some Stanford women
may well be insincere, but most of these flashy and
fancy fellows are rotten to the core.

Horace, I'm afraid that you wore quite right in sug
gesting that most Stanford women would look better
in seven veils—over their usual clothes. But one could
hardly call Stanford men a bunch of roses. A seedier,
sorrier lot would be hard to find. I don't suppose,
Horace, that I could lend you a veil to conceal your
sloppy pants, your buttonless shirt, your bearded chin,
and your mussed hair? It would improve you no end.
It is obvious that the appeal is greatest when all
faults are eliminated—in other words, when both man
and woman are so swathed in clothes as to lose all
resemblance to form, thus leaving it to the romantic
imagination of the other sex to complete the idealiza
tion. However, we have reached an age of function
alism and a period of national emergency; cloth can
not be wasted, even for such a worthy end.
Contrary to the opinion of Miss Fully, I have every
reason to believe that Horace and I will enjoy Purga
tory together. Have a cup of devil's broth, Miss
Fuily?
Sincerely,
Sin Cerely

Judging by "Campus Opinion" for the past couple
of issues of The Daily, Horace Figgins let himself in
tor something. Although one of the Stanford women
whom he maligned, I have known him for years, and
I'm proud to be a friend of his.

Tuesday and Wednesday you printed a couple of
verbose answers to his straightforward letter. Know
ing Horace, I doubt if they convinccd him at all. Both
letters gave evidence that the truth hurts. In each
case, the woman who attempted to prove that she
didn't have a superior attitude began with "you
poor misguided boy." Some proof. The remainder of
the letters was just as illogical; if you doubt me, say
so—l shall be only too glad to prove rny contention.

But what every Stanford woman seems to have
missed in her proud attempt, to vindicate herself is
that Horace made no claims at all for Stanford men.
To me, a Stanford woman who has had just as much
experience with Stanford as has Horace, it appears
that he did well to keep quiet.

We women have been eternally accused of being
snobbish because the ratio was in our favor. Is it in
our favor or not? Probably between a half and two
thirds of all Stanford men date Stanford women
rather infrequently. For many of the men that isn't
on account of the women; it is merely because they
are here for an education—one which they hope to
use to earn a living. Frankly, I'm sorry that I don't
see more of those fellows. There arc a few, of course,
who arc too mousy to have courage to ask for a date,
but they are so few that we can forget about them.
We do anyway.
But what is left to us after the better 50 per cent
of the men have eliminated themselves? By and
large, it is a great number of moronic lounge-lizards
who drive noisy convertibles, fancy themselves roues,
and have no purpose in attending Stanford, other than
to obtain a diploma in Social Sciences or Economics,
so that all loafing done after graduation will be done
in a cultured and worldly way. Some Stanford women
may well be insincere, but most of these flashy and
fancy fellows are rotten to the core.

Horace, I'm afraid that you wore quite right in sug
gesting that most Stanford women would look better
in seven veils—over their usual clothes. But one could
hardly call Stanford men a bunch of roses. A seedier,
sorrier lot would be hard to find. I don't suppose,
Horace, that I could lend you a veil to conceal your
sloppy pants, your buttonless shirt, your bearded chin,
and your mussed hair? It would improve you no end.
It is obvious that the appeal is greatest when all
faults are eliminated—in other words, when both man
and woman are so swathed in clothes as to lose all
resemblance to form, thus leaving it to the romantic
imagination of the other sex to complete the idealiza
tion. However, we have reached an age of function
alism and a period of national emergency; cloth can
not be wasted, even for such a worthy end.
