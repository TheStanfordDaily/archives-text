### VASHTI O'DONNELL 
To stir the hearts and imagina
tions of Stanford students, Paul
Robeson, who opens the 1941-42
Concert Series Monday, Dec. 1, at
8:15 in Memorial Theater, will sing,
with all his individuality, many of
the well-loved familiar Negro spir
ituals.
Opening the program with "Wa
ter Boy," he will make the audience
feel the thirst of the chain-gang
convict: he will follow that famous
spiritual with "Oh, No, John!"' an
English folk-song; "Night." a Rus
sian folk-song; and the Hebrew
"Chassidic Chant."
American BALLAI)
Before intermission, Mr. Robeson
will sing the inspiring patriotic "Bal
lad for Americans," which opens in
1776 with OF Sam putting on his
three-cornered hat and Patrick
Henry with his liberty or death ul
timatum. It is divided into four dra
matic episodes, the Revolution, the
growth of the Union, the Civil War,
and the Machine Age. Robeson will
chant the emotional words against
the choral background of the Stan
ford University Choir, which is di
rected by Dr. Warren D. Allen.
The next selections of the famous
bass-baritone will be Moussorgsky's
"Mountain of Nettles," "Pride,"'
"Wilihin Four Walls," and "Ihe
Flea." In conclusion, in the Negro
melodies of America, "I'm Goin' to
Tell God All of My Troubles," "Eze
