A battered California varsity,
needing a victory to st«>|> the howl
of the wolves and keep out of the
conference cellar, tomorrow meets
a twice beaten Stanford eleven,
which itself needs a convincing
win to gain the Kose Howl hid.
( )(T the record, the two teams
are a far cry from the outfits
which met in Memorial Stadium
last year, yet the game has all. if
not more, the importance the 1 Jig
(lame has ever had.
In every department — kicking,
passing, running, line play, decep
tion, and speed—the Big Red ma
chine earns the nod over the slightly
worn Be&r. But there are those,
perhaps too optimistic, who can en
visage a California triumph.
SIX SENIORS
To win, the Blue and Gold must
first go out and get some points.
Taking the offensive and defensive
phases one at a time we'll see just
what are the Bear's chances.
In the first place, Coach Stub Al
lison can nominate a starting line
composed of six seniors without
weakening his combination one iota.
This, then, is the most experienced
squad on the Coast about which the
metropolitan scribes were raving
two months ago.
Leading the line, of course, is Ail-
American Bob Reinhard who did not
get to play in the Big Game last year.
The 220-pound tackle has three years
of experience bohi -d him ,i'ud will
be hoping to make this the greatest
of many good performances.
LINK i'RIMARY FACTOR
Then there are ends Stew Lewis
; nd Ray Dunn, right tackle George
Herraro or Stan Cox and Bob Hon
gola, all of whom were on the Var
sity a year ago.
Under the Allison style of power
attack, it is primarily the line which
creates the yardage gaining plays.
Thus if the above veterans can fight
off the despair of a losing season and
play as they have in a few brilliant
moments in the past, there will be
some holes opening through which
the Blue and Gold backs can pour.
As far as the ground attack goes,
California is noticeably strengthened
by the return of veteran A1 Derian,
the only consistent tailback on the
squad. The 165 pounder made Max
well Stile's All-American off his
UCLA performance but was injured
early in the Washington game and
hasn't played since. Now he's back
in a suit, ready to go.
IS McQUARY READY?
Should co-captain Jack McQuary
suddenly return to the form which
made him one of the Coast's leading
ground gainers last year, California
will have a double-pronged power
attack. With Derian hitting from the
tailback and McQuary from fullback
it is conceivable the Bear might roll
as it did with Orv Hatcher and Mc-
Quary in the iast half of last year's
Big Game.
At right half is Johnnie Graves,
the best running threat from that
position the Varsity has had in the
last two years, with the exception
