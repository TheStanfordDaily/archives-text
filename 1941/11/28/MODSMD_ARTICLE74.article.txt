# INDIANS FAVORED IN 47TH BIG GAME
## Bear Scribe Admits Card Superiority Cal Supporters Place Hopes on 'Bottle-Up' Theory of Beating T 
### BERT NELSON

A battered California varsity,
needing a victory to st«>|> the howl
of the wolves and keep out of the
conference cellar, tomorrow meets
a twice beaten Stanford eleven,
which itself needs a convincing
win to gain the Kose Howl hid.
( )(T the record, the two teams
are a far cry from the outfits
which met in Memorial Stadium
last year, yet the game has all. if
not more, the importance the 1 Jig
(lame has ever had.
In every department — kicking,
passing, running, line play, decep
tion, and speed—the Big Red ma
chine earns the nod over the slightly
worn Be&r. But there are those,
perhaps too optimistic, who can en
visage a California triumph.
SIX SENIORS
To win, the Blue and Gold must
first go out and get some points.
Taking the offensive and defensive
phases one at a time we'll see just
what are the Bear's chances.
In the first place, Coach Stub Al
lison can nominate a starting line
composed of six seniors without
weakening his combination one iota.
This, then, is the most experienced
squad on the Coast about which the
metropolitan scribes were raving
two months ago.
Leading the line, of course, is Ail-
American Bob Reinhard who did not
get to play in the Big Game last year.
The 220-pound tackle has three years
of experience bohi -d him ,i'ud will
be hoping to make this the greatest
of many good performances.
LINK i'RIMARY FACTOR
Then there are ends Stew Lewis
; nd Ray Dunn, right tackle George
Herraro or Stan Cox and Bob Hon
gola, all of whom were on the Var
sity a year ago.
Under the Allison style of power
attack, it is primarily the line which
creates the yardage gaining plays.
Thus if the above veterans can fight
off the despair of a losing season and
play as they have in a few brilliant
moments in the past, there will be
some holes opening through which
the Blue and Gold backs can pour.
As far as the ground attack goes,
California is noticeably strengthened
by the return of veteran A1 Derian,
the only consistent tailback on the
squad. The 165 pounder made Max
well Stile's All-American off his
UCLA performance but was injured
early in the Washington game and
hasn't played since. Now he's back
in a suit, ready to go.
IS McQUARY READY?
Should co-captain Jack McQuary
suddenly return to the form which
made him one of the Coast's leading
ground gainers last year, California
will have a double-pronged power
attack. With Derian hitting from the
tailback and McQuary from fullback
it is conceivable the Bear might roll
as it did with Orv Hatcher and Mc-
Quary in the iast half of last year's
Big Game.
At right half is Johnnie Graves,
the best running threat from that
position the Varsity has had in the
last two years, with the exception
of seldom healthy Jim Jurkovich.
The roly-poly soph came into his
own against Oregon Slate two weeks
ago.
Even the quarterback situation
can lend cheer to an outwardly dis
mal Berkeley picture. Joe Merlo,
while not the rugged, terrific hitting
type, is a dependable blocker and
the best field judge since Vic Bot
tari. Thus the Bear may not be far
behind Frankie Albert on offensive
strategy.
There is an ever increasing indi
cation that the Cal gridders may
take to the air in quest of victory.
The last three games have produced
an attack which is brilliant if not
consistent. Little Billy Reinhard
could be just the boy to pitch to
victory.
It is no secret that Allison has in
corporated some very unusual, for
California, plays into the Bear rou
tine. The flanker has been used to
good extent for weeks while both
the end around and tackle-eligible
play were exhibited. Maybe the
Stubber has come up with the per
fect play.
So much for California's offense—
now. how are the Bears to stop
Stanford?
The same Bear line that may make

the Berkeley power attack function
may be just the bunch to crack down
on the Card running plays. Should
the boys; do that, and it is not en
tirely improbable, another problem
arises.
What is to be done about Albert's
passing? Washington State ganged
upon the center, thus rushing Al
bert. and used the Cougar ends ef
fectively. If Lewis, Dunn, Johnnie
Ferguson, who lias been mentioned
for All-Coast, or Jack Leidhoit, who
is a demon on defense, can hot her
little Frankie enough, there's half
your pass defense in the bag.
Then, too, there is the possibility
that Allison will dream up another
shifting defense such as that which
pretty well bottled up the undefeated
T last season—and without Reinhard.
Sure, we've been talking about a
lot of ifs. But football is the game
where anything can and does hap
pen and where ifs are important.
Should a couple of these ifs mate
rialize California will win a close
one. If they don't, well, hail the
champion.

last year, yet the game has all. if
not more, the importance the 1 Jig
(lame has ever had.
In every department — kicking,
passing, running, line play, decep
tion, and speed—the Big Red ma
chine earns the nod over the slightly
worn Be&r. But there are those,
perhaps too optimistic, who can en
visage a California triumph.
SIX SENIORS
To win, the Blue and Gold must
first go out and get some points.
Taking the offensive and defensive
phases one at a time we'll see just
what are the Bear's chances.
In the first place, Coach Stub Al
lison can nominate a starting line
composed of six seniors without
weakening his combination one iota.
This, then, is the most experienced
squad on the Coast about which the
metropolitan scribes were raving
two months ago.
Leading the line, of course, is Ail-
American Bob Reinhard who did not
get to play in the Big Game last year.
The 220-pound tackle has three years
of experience bohi -d him ,i'ud will
be hoping to make this the greatest
of many good performances.
LINK i'RIMARY FACTOR
Then there are ends Stew Lewis
; nd Ray Dunn, right tackle George
Herraro or Stan Cox and Bob Hon
gola, all of whom were on the Var
sity a year ago.
Under the Allison style of power
attack, it is primarily the line which
creates the yardage gaining plays.
Thus if the above veterans can fight
off the despair of a losing season and
play as they have in a few brilliant
moments in the past, there will be
some holes opening through which
the Blue and Gold backs can pour.
As far as the ground attack goes,
California is noticeably strengthened
by the return of veteran A1 Derian,
the only consistent tailback on the
squad. The 165 pounder made Max
well Stile's All-American off his
UCLA performance but was injured
early in the Washington game and
hasn't played since. Now he's back
in a suit, ready to go.
IS McQUARY READY?
Should co-captain Jack McQuary
suddenly return to the form which
made him one of the Coast's leading
ground gainers last year, California
will have a double-pronged power
attack. With Derian hitting from the
tailback and McQuary from fullback
it is conceivable the Bear might roll
as it did with Orv Hatcher and Mc-
Quary in the iast half of last year's
Big Game.
At right half is Johnnie Graves,
the best running threat from that
position the Varsity has had in the
last two years, with the exception
of seldom healthy Jim Jurkovich.
The roly-poly soph came into his
own against Oregon Slate two weeks
ago.
Even the quarterback situation
can lend cheer to an outwardly dis
mal Berkeley picture. Joe Merlo,
while not the rugged, terrific hitting
type, is a dependable blocker and
the best field judge since Vic Bot
tari. Thus the Bear may not be far
behind Frankie Albert on offensive
strategy.
There is an ever increasing indi
cation that the Cal gridders may
take to the air in quest of victory.
The last three games have produced
an attack which is brilliant if not
consistent. Little Billy Reinhard
could be just the boy to pitch to
victory.
It is no secret that Allison has in
corporated some very unusual, for
California, plays into the Bear rou
tine. The flanker has been used to
good extent for weeks while both
the end around and tackle-eligible
play were exhibited. Maybe the
Stubber has come up with the per
fect play.
So much for California's offense—
now. how are the Bears to stop
Stanford?
The same Bear line that may make

the Berkeley power attack function
may be just the bunch to crack down
on the Card running plays. Should
the boys; do that, and it is not en
tirely improbable, another problem
arises.
What is to be done about Albert's
passing? Washington State ganged
upon the center, thus rushing Al
bert. and used the Cougar ends ef
fectively. If Lewis, Dunn, Johnnie
Ferguson, who lias been mentioned
for All-Coast, or Jack Leidhoit, who
is a demon on defense, can hot her
little Frankie enough, there's half
your pass defense in the bag.
Then, too, there is the possibility
that Allison will dream up another
shifting defense such as that which
pretty well bottled up the undefeated
T last season—and without Reinhard.
Sure, we've been talking about a
lot of ifs. But football is the game
where anything can and does hap
pen and where ifs are important.
Should a couple of these ifs mate
rialize California will win a close
one. If they don't, well, hail the
champion.

phases one at a time we'll see just
what are the Bear's chances.
In the first place, Coach Stub Al
lison can nominate a starting line
composed of six seniors without
weakening his combination one iota.
This, then, is the most experienced
squad on the Coast about which the
metropolitan scribes were raving
two months ago.
Leading the line, of course, is Ail-
American Bob Reinhard who did not
get to play in the Big Game last year.

of experience bohi -d him ,i'ud will
be hoping to make this the greatest
of many good performances.

Herraro or Stan Cox and Bob Hon
gola, all of whom were on the Var
sity a year ago.
Under the Allison style of power
attack, it is primarily the line which
creates the yardage gaining plays.
Thus if the above veterans can fight
off the despair of a losing season and
play as they have in a few brilliant
moments in the past, there will be
some holes opening through which
the Blue and Gold backs can pour.
As far as the ground attack goes,
California is noticeably strengthened
by the return of veteran A1 Derian,
the only consistent tailback on the
squad. The 165 pounder made Max
well Stile's All-American off his
UCLA performance but was injured
early in the Washington game and
hasn't played since. Now he's back
in a suit, ready to go.

Should co-captain Jack McQuary
suddenly return to the form which
made him one of the Coast's leading
ground gainers last year, California
will have a double-pronged power
attack. With Derian hitting from the
tailback and McQuary from fullback
