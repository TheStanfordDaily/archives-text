### BOB SONTAG 
If (lie football men arc hight, the man behind the fountain, <lie man on
the street, and the man on the faculty, then man, oh man, Stanford will
wallop California come tomorrow afternoon in the Stadium.
Following in quick review are thumbnail sketches on the Redskins'
chances against the Golden Bear from everybody I<> everybody.

Come around, boys, listen to my
tale, and you'll see Stanford win
ning (he Big Game.
SAM FAIA, Encina barber: "Any
thing can happen between now and
game time. I think we'll take them
all right. Cal hasn't done a lot so
far, and I don't think they'll do a
lot now."
HOPES FOR HEALTH
DOROTHY DAVIS, reception
nurse, Men's Health Service: "We
have very good possibilities for win
ning, providing it doesn't rain, and
there is no serious illness among the
players."
STAN SHARP, assistant dean of
men: "I'm always sure that Stanford
will win the Big Game, and this year
is no exception."
BILL GUNTHER, Union Store
manager: "As far as the press is con
cerned, it has belittled Stanford's
ability. I don't think they can be
stopped. Some of the criticism in
their direction may do more to make
them win than anything else."
CAL IN TOP SHAPE
"SLIM TROXELL, Encina Store:
"I think Cal is in top shape; our
boys seem to be worn down. But
they may have picked up during the
week. If Kmetovic is in, I don't see
how we'll lose; I think we'll win
anyway, but it may be close."
GUS. Encina shoe shine man: "We
should win, but watch for an upset
with Pete Kmetovic ailing and Vuc
inich in uncertain condition. I think
Cal will be gunning to get Pete."

KEN ROBESKY, guard: "I think
we'll win. Our defeat by Washing
ton State won't help Cal at all. And
our morale is way up."
FREDDY MEYER, end: "We'll
play our best game of the year."
PREDICTS TOUGH BATTLE
HANK NORBERG, end: "We'll
win, but it'll be tough. For a hunch
bet, Paly High won their league, so
we should win ours."
FRANKIE ALBERT, quarter:
"She's gonna be tough."
ROGER LAVERTY, end: "I think
we'll take 'em. Charles Taylor and
the boys are showing a lot of fire out
there these days."
ED STAMM, tackle: "The spirit i.s
way up, and we all want to fight
with the seniors to put on a good
show for this last game."
BRUNO BANDUCCI, tackle: "It's
going to be our toughest game, but
1 think we'll play our best for the
year."
"WE RE ALL SET"
DOUG STAHLE, center: "The boys
are in the best spirits of the season.
And I think we're set for a great
day."
LOREN LAPRADE, guard: "We're
in. We've lost all we're going to."
JACK FRANCIS, guard: "We're
really taking this game seriously.
It'll be tough though. They're gun
ning for u.s."
BUCK FAWCETT, half: "We've
