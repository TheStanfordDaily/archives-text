# Stanford's Grandstand Quarterbacks Confident of Indian Victory Tomorrow
## Farm's Man-on-the-Street Doubtful Of Cal's Ability to Hold Cardinals 
### BOB SONTAG 
If (lie football men arc hight, the man behind the fountain, <lie man on
the street, and the man on the faculty, then man, oh man, Stanford will
wallop California come tomorrow afternoon in the Stadium.
Following in quick review are thumbnail sketches on the Redskins'
chances against the Golden Bear from everybody I<> everybody.

Come around, boys, listen to my
tale, and you'll see Stanford win
ning (he Big Game.
SAM FAIA, Encina barber: "Any
thing can happen between now and
game time. I think we'll take them
all right. Cal hasn't done a lot so
far, and I don't think they'll do a
lot now."
HOPES FOR HEALTH
DOROTHY DAVIS, reception
nurse, Men's Health Service: "We
have very good possibilities for win
ning, providing it doesn't rain, and
there is no serious illness among the
players."
STAN SHARP, assistant dean of
men: "I'm always sure that Stanford
will win the Big Game, and this year
is no exception."
BILL GUNTHER, Union Store
manager: "As far as the press is con
cerned, it has belittled Stanford's
ability. I don't think they can be
stopped. Some of the criticism in
their direction may do more to make
them win than anything else."
CAL IN TOP SHAPE
"SLIM TROXELL, Encina Store:
"I think Cal is in top shape; our
boys seem to be worn down. But
they may have picked up during the
week. If Kmetovic is in, I don't see
how we'll lose; I think we'll win
anyway, but it may be close."
GUS. Encina shoe shine man: "We
should win, but watch for an upset
with Pete Kmetovic ailing and Vuc
inich in uncertain condition. I think
Cal will be gunning to get Pete."

KEN ROBESKY, guard: "I think
we'll win. Our defeat by Washing
ton State won't help Cal at all. And
our morale is way up."
FREDDY MEYER, end: "We'll
play our best game of the year."
PREDICTS TOUGH BATTLE
HANK NORBERG, end: "We'll
win, but it'll be tough. For a hunch
bet, Paly High won their league, so
we should win ours."
FRANKIE ALBERT, quarter:
"She's gonna be tough."
ROGER LAVERTY, end: "I think
we'll take 'em. Charles Taylor and
the boys are showing a lot of fire out
there these days."
ED STAMM, tackle: "The spirit i.s
way up, and we all want to fight
with the seniors to put on a good
show for this last game."
BRUNO BANDUCCI, tackle: "It's
going to be our toughest game, but
1 think we'll play our best for the
year."
"WE RE ALL SET"
DOUG STAHLE, center: "The boys
are in the best spirits of the season.
And I think we're set for a great
day."
LOREN LAPRADE, guard: "We're
in. We've lost all we're going to."
JACK FRANCIS, guard: "We're
really taking this game seriously.
It'll be tough though. They're gun
ning for u.s."
BUCK FAWCETT, half: "We've

still got roses on our minds, and
we'll keen "oin o ."
CCCKIE SOUTH, trainer: "I think
: t's going to be a tough one. God
bless Oregon."
VIC LINDSKOG, center: "Our
spirit is better than it has been for
weeks. We ah (This was
■vith southern accent).
BILL BKbbAj\jiu, end: "I doubt
if I'll get in, but wait till next year."
lIOOT'S OPINION
HOOT ARMSTRONG, half: "No
doubt it'll be the toughest game of
the season. But we're gonna do 'er,
'cause it's our turn to win."
808 MITCHELL, half: "We'll
have to watch that whole fcaekfield."
PETF KMETOVIC, half: "I think
we'll win, but it will be very close.
Stanfoid should win on the ground."
ED M'CAIN, tackle: "The most in -
teresting thing in the whole game
will be Banducci vs. Reinhard, prob
ably the coast's two best tackles.
We ought to win by two touch
downs."
MILT VUCINICH, full: "Tough
game, but the boys are really fired
up for it."
ARNIE MEINERS, end: "Tough
game but we'll really play for this
one. It's the last for me and five
other boys. We'll really try." (Maybe
it won't be the last one, Arnie. Al
ways chance of the Rose Bowl, you
know.)
ONE POINT ENOUGH
EVERETT DEAN, basketball
coach: "We'll settle lor a winning
margin of one point. Any more than
that, o.k. too."
JAKE IRWIN, gym store: "We're
not gonna let 'George' do it this
time." (If you don't know "George,"
.see Jake. He'll give you the dope.)
"BLACKIE," Eneina store: "Re
gardless of whether Kmetovic or
Vucinich are out, I still think we
have 11 or 12 Ail-Americans. And
the score will be about 13-6, rain or
shine."
BACK TO THE "SHACK"
CHARLEY WEGNER, Daily com
positor: "Stanford will win. They're
just playing the league's fourth team.
It's a cinch."
MIKE KRESGE, Branner Hall
analyst: "With Kmetovic we're in."
VIC MINAHAN, Daily bank boy:
"I've been reading about this Big
Game backwards and forwards. Gad,
men, we're in."

Stanfoid should win on the ground."

doubt it'll be the toughest game of
the season. But we're gonna do 'er,
'cause it's our turn to win."
808 MITCHELL, half: "We'll
have to watch that whole fcaekfield."
PETF KMETOVIC, half: "I think
we'll win, but it will be very close.
Stanfoid should win on the ground."
ED M'CAIN, tackle: "The most in -
teresting thing in the whole game
will be Banducci vs. Reinhard, prob
ably the coast's two best tackles.
We ought to win by two touch
downs."
MILT VUCINICH, full: "Tough
game, but the boys are really fired
up for it."
ARNIE MEINERS, end: "Tough
game but we'll really play for this
one. It's the last for me and five
other boys. We'll really try." (Maybe
it won't be the last one, Arnie. Al
ways chance of the Rose Bowl, you
know.)
ONE POINT ENOUGH
EVERETT DEAN, basketball
coach: "We'll settle lor a winning
margin of one point. Any more than
that, o.k. too."
JAKE IRWIN, gym store: "We're
not gonna let 'George' do it this
time." (If you don't know "George,"
.see Jake. He'll give you the dope.)
"BLACKIE," Eneina store: "Re
gardless of whether Kmetovic or
Vucinich are out, I still think we
have 11 or 12 Ail-Americans. And
the score will be about 13-6, rain or
shine."
BACK TO THE "SHACK"
CHARLEY WEGNER, Daily com
positor: "Stanford will win. They're
just playing the league's fourth team.
It's a cinch."
MIKE KRESGE, Branner Hall
analyst: "With Kmetovic we're in."
VIC MINAHAN, Daily bank boy:
"I've been reading about this Big
Game backwards and forwards. Gad,
men, we're in."
If (lie football men arc hight, the man behind the fountain, <lie man on
the street, and the man on the faculty, then man, oh man, Stanford will
wallop California come tomorrow afternoon in the Stadium.
Following in quick review are thumbnail sketches on the Redskins'
chances against the Golden Bear from everybody I<> everybody.

Come around, boys, listen to my
tale, and you'll see Stanford win
ning (he Big Game.
SAM FAIA, Encina barber: "Any
thing can happen between now and
game time. I think we'll take them
all right. Cal hasn't done a lot so
far, and I don't think they'll do a
lot now."
HOPES FOR HEALTH
DOROTHY DAVIS, reception
nurse, Men's Health Service: "We
have very good possibilities for win
ning, providing it doesn't rain, and
there is no serious illness among the
players."
STAN SHARP, assistant dean of
men: "I'm always sure that Stanford
will win the Big Game, and this year
is no exception."
BILL GUNTHER, Union Store
manager: "As far as the press is con
cerned, it has belittled Stanford's
ability. I don't think they can be
stopped. Some of the criticism in
their direction may do more to make
them win than anything else."
CAL IN TOP SHAPE
"SLIM TROXELL, Encina Store:
"I think Cal is in top shape; our
boys seem to be worn down. But
they may have picked up during the
week. If Kmetovic is in, I don't see
how we'll lose; I think we'll win
anyway, but it may be close."
GUS. Encina shoe shine man: "We
should win, but watch for an upset
with Pete Kmetovic ailing and Vuc
inich in uncertain condition. I think
Cal will be gunning to get Pete."

KEN ROBESKY, guard: "I think
we'll win. Our defeat by Washing
ton State won't help Cal at all. And
our morale is way up."
FREDDY MEYER, end: "We'll
play our best game of the year."
PREDICTS TOUGH BATTLE
HANK NORBERG, end: "We'll
win, but it'll be tough. For a hunch
bet, Paly High won their league, so
we should win ours."
FRANKIE ALBERT, quarter:
"She's gonna be tough."
ROGER LAVERTY, end: "I think
we'll take 'em. Charles Taylor and
the boys are showing a lot of fire out
there these days."
ED STAMM, tackle: "The spirit i.s
way up, and we all want to fight
with the seniors to put on a good
show for this last game."
BRUNO BANDUCCI, tackle: "It's
going to be our toughest game, but
1 think we'll play our best for the
year."
"WE RE ALL SET"
DOUG STAHLE, center: "The boys
are in the best spirits of the season.
And I think we're set for a great
day."
LOREN LAPRADE, guard: "We're
in. We've lost all we're going to."
JACK FRANCIS, guard: "We're
really taking this game seriously.
It'll be tough though. They're gun
ning for u.s."
BUCK FAWCETT, half: "We've

still got roses on our minds, and
we'll keen "oin o ."
CCCKIE SOUTH, trainer: "I think
: t's going to be a tough one. God
bless Oregon."
VIC LINDSKOG, center: "Our
spirit is better than it has been for
weeks. We ah (This was
■vith southern accent).
BILL BKbbAj\jiu, end: "I doubt
if I'll get in, but wait till next year."
