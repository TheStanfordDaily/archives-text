### LI'L INJUN 
I can see it all now.
It's halftime tomorrow. Stanford
leads California, 6-0. Buck Fawcctt
just now turned himself on full blast
j and ran through Al Derian and Jack
McQuary to score standing up.
Frankie Albert's place kick was
blocked by some unknown, Bob \
Reinhard.
Sports observers around us are
: labeling the impending landslide "In
j Re Beam Samborombon (1941), L.S.
! J.U. 20,U.0f Cal. 13."
Course, our guys are just sit tin' on
i the backs of their stomachs, waitin'
| for the announcer to give the Ore
] gon-Oregon State score.
QUIET, PLEASE!
"Ladies and gentlemen, your at
tention, please. A score from up
north,"' drones through the loul
i speaker.
Redskin rooters calm.
Joe Messina turns three c'aiing
preliminary cartwheels, then grabs
Clary and Colyear, and asks them
I what yell we should give Oregon.
B A.C. ticket takers harken, too,
thinking, Gad, what a tiine we'll
1 have cheeking student body cards at
j the Rose Bowl.
Four thousand Redmen rabid, riot
ous, rambunctious, roll ( king, for
once open their ears and shut their
mouths.
Hie lady with the I hr hat keeps
it on, and nobody care.-
A million of B1 • >d Gold across
the field st;r:d by, ready with
"P-fl (> R TA-N-F-O-R-D .. ."
pot I OK SHOUT?
The ->th< i people in the stands,
not knowing quite how to take the
! set-up, just sit back and wish they
• ,vere in college again. When the
score comes, half pout, half shout.
Up in the press box you can hear
H. D. Thoreau slowly chanting un
der his breath the famous words:
"Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin the
Beavers . . . (c'mon, Mecham. Hit
'em, man)."
The announcer, having sensed
the drama-packed situation two
weeks ahead, has prepared 4,567 dif
ferent ways of giving the score. He
wants to foozle the entire 90,000 by
various intonations of his voice,
(probably learned in Speech IX) so
he either pauses, raises, or lowers
the pitch. And splendid results are
forthcoming.
This first one'U getcha, because it's

the old A-No. 1 Oregon build-up.
"Oregon S-T-A-a-a-a-ate (way
up on the 'Sti*,' then way down on
the 'ate,' leading you to believe the
Wehloots arc out in front): SEV
EN!
"OREgon (way up on 'Ore'):
sev—veil."
Not bad, not good. You breathe a
sigh of relief. But there he goes
again with a later score:
"Oregon State (majestically,
forcefully, with great foreboding
of impending tragedy): TIIIR

"Oregon (sorrowfully, despond
| enlly endless pause, then, all
of a sudden): TWENTY."
Course, our section just ties right
up.
Hooters go wild, Messina barely
makes it after completing a triple
somersault-quarter gainer, half-toss
with a seven-point landing and a
full twist, we roll the lady with the
blue hat, and Bud Ames, Alpha Stig
ma Enigma, wires his mom that he's
going to have a cocktail party before
Ihe Rose Bowl game Jan. 1.

i speaker.
Redskin rooters calm.
Joe Messina turns three c'aiing
preliminary cartwheels, then grabs
Clary and Colyear, and asks them
I what yell we should give Oregon.
B A.C. ticket takers harken, too,
thinking, Gad, what a tiine we'll
1 have cheeking student body cards at
j the Rose Bowl.
Four thousand Redmen rabid, riot
ous, rambunctious, roll ( king, for
once open their ears and shut their
mouths.
Hie lady with the I hr hat keeps
it on, and nobody care.-
A million of B1 • >d Gold across
the field st;r:d by, ready with
"P-fl (> R TA-N-F-O-R-D .. ."
pot I OK SHOUT?
The ->th< i people in the stands,
not knowing quite how to take the
! set-up, just sit back and wish they
• ,vere in college again. When the
score comes, half pout, half shout.
Up in the press box you can hear
H. D. Thoreau slowly chanting un
der his breath the famous words:
"Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin the
Beavers . . . (c'mon, Mecham. Hit
'em, man)."
The announcer, having sensed
the drama-packed situation two
weeks ahead, has prepared 4,567 dif
ferent ways of giving the score. He
wants to foozle the entire 90,000 by
various intonations of his voice,
(probably learned in Speech IX) so
he either pauses, raises, or lowers
the pitch. And splendid results are
forthcoming.
This first one'U getcha, because it's

the old A-No. 1 Oregon build-up.
"Oregon S-T-A-a-a-a-ate (way
up on the 'Sti*,' then way down on
the 'ate,' leading you to believe the
Wehloots arc out in front): SEV
EN!
"OREgon (way up on 'Ore'):
sev—veil."
Not bad, not good. You breathe a
sigh of relief. But there he goes
again with a later score:
"Oregon State (majestically,
forcefully, with great foreboding
of impending tragedy): TIIIR

"Oregon (sorrowfully, despond
| enlly endless pause, then, all
of a sudden): TWENTY."
Course, our section just ties right
up.
Hooters go wild, Messina barely
makes it after completing a triple
somersault-quarter gainer, half-toss
with a seven-point landing and a
full twist, we roll the lady with the
blue hat, and Bud Ames, Alpha Stig
ma Enigma, wires his mom that he's
going to have a cocktail party before
Ihe Rose Bowl game Jan. 1.
