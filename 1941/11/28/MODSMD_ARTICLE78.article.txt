# Will Connolly Picks Cal, But Other Scribes Faithful to T
## 
### DICK KEUSINK 
Indians crawl under the bench if Kemet doesn't play. That's the opinion
of the "experts" who tell us how we won or lost in Sunday's paper. The
Sunda morning, or mourning if you prefer, men all pick Pete Keliietovic
and the "T" to scalp the Bears in tomorrow afternoon's fracas, with one
excepti >n.

Will Connolly, bad man of the
! Chronicle, says: "It's Cal, 13-7."
Well that's sumpin', but the "key
I man" of Stanford's unpaid press
i agents, Bill Leiser, quotes himself
| here and now by saying "If Pete
Kemetovic plays the score will be
18 I.'!, believe me. If the shifty Stan
ford left half doesn't play, the game
| will be a wide open affair,"
Told that everybody on the Farm
was sure of the Indians victory in
the Stanford Stadium, Dick Freind
i lich, also of the Chronicle claim.s
! "Somebody must have been reading
my mail, yeah. I think the score will
j be Stanford 2(1, California (pause)
j 7."

Curley G'.-ive of the San Francisco
Examiner goes the fore for Stanford
and predicts the score will be 13-7,
Stanford's favor. Jim Sullivan, of
the United Press, also calls the score
13-7.
"The game's really a toss-up but
lon paper Stanford will win. I saw
| Stanford play in the Cougar game;
the Indians looked tired but if they
] pull out of the slump they ought to
1 dump Cal," says Jim.
San Francisco News newsmen,
[ Tom Laird and Bud Spencer, both
forsee a victory for the Indians, pro
viding "Skeeter Peter" plays.
"A toss-up if Pete doesn't play,
but if he does the score will be 21-7
when the gun goes off at the end of
the Big Game." So spoke Laird.
HAVE TO PLAY BEST
"Anyway you look at it the boys
from Palo Alto will have to play
I their best game of the year to win
| this one," .says Bud Spencer. "Stan
ford's trouble right now is mostly
i mental, but if they can shift into a
| spirit of high gear for the game they
I ought to win 14-7 with Pete Kmet
ovic's help."
Jack McDonald, Call-Bulletin
sports writer, tells just how and
why the Redskins will win.
"They've got a faster team than
the Bears, and Cal lacks the speed
and deception of the T. Stanford
ought to score at least two touch
downs by running plays and one
via Ail-American Frankie Albert's
southpaw throwing arm. Even if
Kmetovic doesn't play Buck Faw
cett ought to fill in quite nicely in
the Indian backficld. Score? 20-13."
"SPEED AND DECEPTION"
United Press sport columnist Jack
Cuddy of New York doesn't put the
score down on paper but claims
Stanford would win via "speed and
deception."
Four thousand Stanford students
and the rest of the paid admission
will keep a close watch on the score
board Saturday to sec how close the
"grey-haired quiz kids" come to
picking the score. Everybody around
on the Stanford campus is sure the
T will bring home Bear-bacon.
However, the 10,000 Cal rooters who
sit, on the shady side of the Stadium
have a funny idea about the game,
along with Will Connolly.

on the Stanford campus is sure the

However, the 10,000 Cal rooters who
sit, on the shady side of the Stadium
have a funny idea about the game,
along with Will Connolly.
Indians crawl under the bench if Kemet doesn't play. That's the opinion
of the "experts" who tell us how we won or lost in Sunday's paper. The
Sunda morning, or mourning if you prefer, men all pick Pete Keliietovic
and the "T" to scalp the Bears in tomorrow afternoon's fracas, with one
excepti >n.

Will Connolly, bad man of the

i agents, Bill Leiser, quotes himself

Curley G'.-ive of the San Francisco

13-7.

San Francisco News newsmen,

Jack McDonald, Call-Bulletin
sports writer, tells just how and
why the Redskins will win.
"They've got a faster team than
the Bears, and Cal lacks the speed
and deception of the T. Stanford
ought to score at least two touch
downs by running plays and one
via Ail-American Frankie Albert's
southpaw throwing arm. Even if
Kmetovic doesn't play Buck Faw
cett ought to fill in quite nicely in
the Indian backficld. Score? 20-13."

"SPEED AND DECEPTION"
United Press sport columnist Jack
Cuddy of New York doesn't put the
score down on paper but claims
Stanford would win via "speed and
deception."
Four thousand Stanford students
and the rest of the paid admission
will keep a close watch on the score
board Saturday to sec how close the
"grey-haired quiz kids" come to
picking the score. Everybody around
on the Stanford campus is sure the
T will bring home Bear-bacon.
However, the 10,000 Cal rooters who
sit, on the shady side of the Stadium
have a funny idea about the game,
along with Will Connolly.
