Set t<> battle to the last ditch
for its second consecutive Big
' lame victory, Pacific Coast Con
ference crown, and Rose Bowl
bid, Clark Shaughtiessy's Stan
ford Indians clash with Leonard
1». "Stub" Allison's 1 niversity
of Calilornia (lolden Bears in the
forty-seventh renewal of the I
(iame in the Stanford Stadium
tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock.
Seventy-five thousand rabid grid
fans are expected to jam the Stadium
for the fray.
Best news to hit the Farm last
night was the announcement by
Shaughnessy that Pete Kmetovic,
Stanford's brilliant left half and
leading ground-gainer in the confer
ence, will start tomorrow's fracas,
which will be the last Big Game
for Kmetovic and five of the other
Indians who will be on the field for
the kick-off. In the event that the
Cards kick off, Ken Robcsky will
start at left guard, increasing the
number of seniors to seven.
Meanwhile, however, Milt Vuci
nich's sprained ankle has not come
along well enough to allow him to
carry his regular fullback duties,
necessitating the substitution of
Bob "Cruncher" Crane. The remain
der of the line-up will be the same,
with Arnie Meiners and Freddie
Meyers at ends, Bruno Banducei and
Ed Stamm at tackles, Loren La-
Prade and Chuck Taylor at guards,
Vic Lindskog at center, Frankie Al
bert, chosen to captain Stanford, at
quarterback, and Eric Armstrong at
right halfback.
ODDS FAVOR CARDS
If you choose to ride with the
Stanford Indians, two and a half
will get. you one in return, odds
that definitely fail to signify the ex
treme closeness of the two teams as
they move into the final day before
Big Game.
California is in good shape and
psychologically "high," indicating
j that the Bears will probably turn in
a better brand of football here to
morrow than they ever have in win
ning two and losing four conference
contests this season.
Stanford is in better shape than it.
appeared the Indians would be ear
lier in the week, for, while the ab
sence of hard-driving Vucinich in
the starting line-up hurts, the re
turn of Kmetovic to his starting
berth means a very great deal to the
! Stanford at tack.
FAST HALFBACKS
With Kmetovic in the ball game,
1 Stanford has the addf'd threat of
two exceptionally fast halfbacks,
sawed-off Eric "Hoot" Armstrong
being the other one, to shoot wide on
end runs and to scoot downfield as
I decoys or as pass receivers. Cali
; fornia's secondary, be it two, three,
| or four men, will have to keep close
to those two boys, which would
spread the defense for the power
shots by Crane or Sheller inside the
| tackles.
Vucinich may see action before
the game is over, although he was
limping badly and was unable to
| run in yesterday's practice session,
in which the Indians worked lightly
both on offensive maneuvers and
against California plays. They will
ease through another workout this
afternoon before quitting the cam
pus until just before game time to
morrow.
Rumors that Jim Jurkovich, stellar
Bear tailback who was declared out
for the season after a reoccurrence
of a head injury in the Washington
State game, will play against the
Indians were spiked last night by
Coach Allison.
NO CHANGE OF MIND
"If the higher-ups were going to
change their minds, they would
have done it by now," he said.
All of which leaves the game on
pretty much of an even keel, with
whatever deserved edge the Indians
have being due to the return of
Kmetovic.
The chances of tomorrow's game
developing into a wide open aerial
battle is fine from the Stanford side,
what with the pitching of the deadly
Frankie Albert, Stanford's Ail-
American quarterback. From the
other side of the picture, however,
the same story may not be true, for
the old 'Z" right and short punt
formations that the Bears have em
ployed since long before Allison took
over are not particularly adaptive to
a deceptive passing attack. Further
more, it is extremely doubtful if
the Berkeleymen have a passer who
can trade pitch for pitch with Al
bert. Their best is probably A1
Derian, who will be playing his first
game in three weeks.
ONE LONG PASS
Yet, one long pass can often make
the difference between a victory and
a defeat. And there is nothing that
says the Bears cannot complete that
ONE. As a team with an all-around
consistent attack, the Bears have
the stuff to score touchdowns; and
touchdowns are what can beat a
Stanford eleven that has been de
feated twice this season, once by
Oregon State and again by Washing
ton State, in eight starts.
Stanford has the will and the
method to win. It appears that the
Bears have, too. No matter what
angle you take on it, it looks like a
close game, the odds notwithstand
ing.
Nothing is certain in a football
game, especially when it's the Big
Game.

1». "Stub" Allison's 1 niversity
of Calilornia (lolden Bears in the
forty-seventh renewal of the I
(iame in the Stanford Stadium
tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock.
Seventy-five thousand rabid grid
fans are expected to jam the Stadium
for the fray.
Best news to hit the Farm last
night was the announcement by
Shaughnessy that Pete Kmetovic,
Stanford's brilliant left half and
leading ground-gainer in the confer
ence, will start tomorrow's fracas,
which will be the last Big Game
for Kmetovic and five of the other
Indians who will be on the field for
the kick-off. In the event that the
Cards kick off, Ken Robcsky will
start at left guard, increasing the
number of seniors to seven.
Meanwhile, however, Milt Vuci
nich's sprained ankle has not come
along well enough to allow him to
carry his regular fullback duties,
necessitating the substitution of
Bob "Cruncher" Crane. The remain
der of the line-up will be the same,
with Arnie Meiners and Freddie
Meyers at ends, Bruno Banducei and
Ed Stamm at tackles, Loren La-
Prade and Chuck Taylor at guards,
Vic Lindskog at center, Frankie Al
bert, chosen to captain Stanford, at
quarterback, and Eric Armstrong at
right halfback.
ODDS FAVOR CARDS
If you choose to ride with the
Stanford Indians, two and a half
will get. you one in return, odds
that definitely fail to signify the ex
treme closeness of the two teams as
they move into the final day before
Big Game.
California is in good shape and
psychologically "high," indicating
j that the Bears will probably turn in
a better brand of football here to
morrow than they ever have in win
ning two and losing four conference
contests this season.
Stanford is in better shape than it.
appeared the Indians would be ear
lier in the week, for, while the ab
sence of hard-driving Vucinich in
the starting line-up hurts, the re
turn of Kmetovic to his starting
berth means a very great deal to the
! Stanford at tack.
FAST HALFBACKS
With Kmetovic in the ball game,
1 Stanford has the addf'd threat of
two exceptionally fast halfbacks,
sawed-off Eric "Hoot" Armstrong
being the other one, to shoot wide on
end runs and to scoot downfield as
I decoys or as pass receivers. Cali
; fornia's secondary, be it two, three,
| or four men, will have to keep close
to those two boys, which would
spread the defense for the power
shots by Crane or Sheller inside the
| tackles.
Vucinich may see action before
the game is over, although he was
limping badly and was unable to
| run in yesterday's practice session,
in which the Indians worked lightly
both on offensive maneuvers and
against California plays. They will
ease through another workout this
afternoon before quitting the cam
pus until just before game time to
morrow.
Rumors that Jim Jurkovich, stellar
Bear tailback who was declared out
for the season after a reoccurrence
of a head injury in the Washington
State game, will play against the
Indians were spiked last night by
Coach Allison.
NO CHANGE OF MIND
"If the higher-ups were going to
change their minds, they would
have done it by now," he said.
All of which leaves the game on
pretty much of an even keel, with
whatever deserved edge the Indians
have being due to the return of
Kmetovic.
The chances of tomorrow's game
developing into a wide open aerial
battle is fine from the Stanford side,
what with the pitching of the deadly
Frankie Albert, Stanford's Ail-
American quarterback. From the
other side of the picture, however,
the same story may not be true, for
the old 'Z" right and short punt
formations that the Bears have em
ployed since long before Allison took
over are not particularly adaptive to
a deceptive passing attack. Further
more, it is extremely doubtful if
the Berkeleymen have a passer who
can trade pitch for pitch with Al
bert. Their best is probably A1
Derian, who will be playing his first
game in three weeks.
ONE LONG PASS
Yet, one long pass can often make
the difference between a victory and
a defeat. And there is nothing that
says the Bears cannot complete that
ONE. As a team with an all-around
consistent attack, the Bears have
the stuff to score touchdowns; and
touchdowns are what can beat a
Stanford eleven that has been de
feated twice this season, once by
Oregon State and again by Washing
ton State, in eight starts.
Stanford has the will and the
method to win. It appears that the
Bears have, too. No matter what
angle you take on it, it looks like a
close game, the odds notwithstand
ing.
Nothing is certain in a football
game, especially when it's the Big
Game.

Seventy-five thousand rabid grid
fans are expected to jam the Stadium
for the fray.
Best news to hit the Farm last
night was the announcement by
Shaughnessy that Pete Kmetovic,
Stanford's brilliant left half and
leading ground-gainer in the confer
ence, will start tomorrow's fracas,
which will be the last Big Game
for Kmetovic and five of the other
Indians who will be on the field for
the kick-off. In the event that the
Cards kick off, Ken Robcsky will
start at left guard, increasing the
number of seniors to seven.
Meanwhile, however, Milt Vuci
nich's sprained ankle has not come
along well enough to allow him to
carry his regular fullback duties,
necessitating the substitution of
Bob "Cruncher" Crane. The remain
der of the line-up will be the same,

change their minds, they would
have done it by now," he said.
All of which leaves the game on
pretty much of an even keel, with
whatever deserved edge the Indians
have being due to the return of
Kmetovic.
The chances of tomorrow's game
developing into a wide open aerial
battle is fine from the Stanford side,
what with the pitching of the deadly
Frankie Albert, Stanford's Ail-
American quarterback. From the
other side of the picture, however,
the same story may not be true, for
the old 'Z" right and short punt
formations that the Bears have em
ployed since long before Allison took
over are not particularly adaptive to
a deceptive passing attack. Further
more, it is extremely doubtful if
the Berkeleymen have a passer who
can trade pitch for pitch with Al
bert. Their best is probably A1
Derian, who will be playing his first
game in three weeks.
ONE LONG PASS
Yet, one long pass can often make
the difference between a victory and
a defeat. And there is nothing that
says the Bears cannot complete that
ONE. As a team with an all-around
consistent attack, the Bears have
the stuff to score touchdowns; and
touchdowns are what can beat a
Stanford eleven that has been de
feated twice this season, once by
Oregon State and again by Washing
