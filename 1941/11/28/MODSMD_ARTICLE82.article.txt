# Stub Praises T, But Promises Cal Will Play 'Best of Season'

### JOHN HORRALL 
T man they call Stub walked
the big A.S.U.C. locker room
C tl. He opened the door to the
h dressing room, turned the
i.ination on his locker, pulled
practice suit out, and sat down
' . nearby bench.
'!! see what I can tell you about
< team," he said as he pulled out
; Chelsea. "You know that rest
week-end did us a whale of a
'if good—and 1 know it helped
hoys, too."
id t a shuffling oX his not-too
i! feet, he smiled and continued,
I have the answer to the "P?
I! I can say is that Clark (an ob
reference to Coach, Coach
Shaughnessy) has devised
•I' the hardest offenses to defend
n: ' on the coast.
\mford has a strong offense,"
i linued, "combined with a big,
d line. We get set to watch
tovic around end or Vucinich
!•' ii h center; then you send Al
i el; to pass or kick. That man
li in is tricky."
.'ison liked Gallerneau and
■ ■' last year; in fact about
•••''( e he said, "You know he was
f ill of fire when he played for
Beach Poly. I sure wanted him
t ) f >mt to Cal."
ii k to the condition of the Bears,
! nil ted "Derian has been Hat
< i l ack for it) days, but he will
ly Saturday, don't work. His

; legs have bothered him a little,'
[ though."
"One thing I can say definitely,
1 however, is that our team will play
| its best ball of the season Saturday."
About that time Big Bjob Herwig,
former Ail-American of a few years
back and now assistant to Stub on
the gridiron, walked in to put on his
uniform. Introductions were made,
and Allison continued.
He didn't have the winner of the
0.5.C.-Oregon game on the tip of
his tongue; in fact he .said that he
never really saw Oregon play. "When
we played the Ducks in Multnomah
Stadium all I could see was mud
and halfbacks taking nosedives on
end runs. We really outplayed O.S.C.
but didn't have that scoring punch."
Washington, in his opinion, was
[ the best team the Bears played all
season. Bobby Robertson, U.S.C.'s
great back, was his choice for the
i individual standout on the coast.
While on the subject of individual
performances, he added, "Stan An
derson, in the 1934 or 19.35 Big Game,
when he kicked 73 yards from be
j hind his own goal just as we were
, about to score was a heart-breaking
j performance from our viewpoint."
"Good luck in everything except
j next Saturday," was his parting re
j mark.

For nine years (he Rig Game be
, tween Stanford and Cal was rugby
! instead of football.
