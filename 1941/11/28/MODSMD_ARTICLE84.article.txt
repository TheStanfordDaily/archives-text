# Minnesota Rated as Nation's Top Team After Turbulent, Upset-Filled Season
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
The 1941 football season comes to
a close this week-end with only
three teams of any importance
throughout the country still unde
feated and untied, and with no ma
jor team in the Far West with less
than two losses.
Minnesota's powerful Golden Go
phers have captured the mythical
national championship in the eyes
of most of the experts. The Gophers
went through an eight-game sched
ule without loss or a tie to mar their
record, although in four of their
games they won by the slim margin.'
of 1, 7, 8, and 9 points.
Duke and Duquesne are the other
two all-victorious teams. The Blue
Devils in nine games have scored 311
points to their opponents' 41, which
ranks them as the nation's highest
scoring major team. Their entire
schedule is not up to the high stand
ard of Minnesota; nevertheless, they
hold victories over Pittsburgh, Tenn
essee, Georgia Tech, Colgate, and
North Carolina.
DUQUESNE UNBEATEN
Duquesne, one of the smaller in
dependents of the East, had included
wins over Marquette, St. Mary's of
California, Villanova, and Mississippi
State. Both Duquesne and Duke will
be excellent prospects when the
"bowls" start looking around.
Notre Dame, tied only by Army
is considered otherwise untarnished.
However, it's last two wins over
Northwestern by one point, and
Southern California by two, are not
too impressive. Like the Gophers,
the Irish prefer to stay home Now
Year's.
Taking the country by sections, go
ing from East to West, the Ivy league
comes first. Pennsylvania with only
one loss, to Navy, has taken care of
the rest of the Ivy Leaguers without
much trouble. Harvard dropped
games to Penn and Cornell before
she really got going full speed to tie

Navy and win the rest.
The two service teams from West
Point and Annapolis meet in their
traditional thriller this week-end.
Both teams enter the game with good
records, Army losing only to Har
vard and Penn, and Navy losing to
Notre Dame and tying Harvard.
Fordham, with only a defeat by
Pitt against their record, is another
team in line for post season bids.
They still have N.Y.U. to play, but
they shouldn't have much trouble
with the Violets.
Swinging South, we find Duke
head and shoulders above all other
teams in the Southern Conference,
but in the Southeastern circuit,
Vanderbilt, Mississippi, Mississippi
State, Tennessee, Alabama, and
Georgia are all fighting for the lead.
The final games between Vandy and
I he Crimson Tide, Ole Miss and Miss.
St., and Georgia and the Engineers
will settle the controversy. Any one
of these teams will be ready and
willing for a Bowl engagement.
viichigan Second
Going north again, behind the Go
phers in the Big Ten comes Michi
gan and Ohio State in a tie. The
Northwestern Wildcats are close be
hind in the fourth spot. Those four
teams comprise the class of the
league with very little separating
them.
Missouri, after losing her opener
to the Buckeyes, swept through all
Big Six competition without a loss.
They are very much in the running
for the Rose Bowl game, also.
Utah is the class of the Rocky
Mountain region with only a score
less deadlock with Denver against
its record. Arizona plays the Utes
this week, however, and has a good
chance of ruining an unbeaten rec
ord.
Nothing can be decided in the Pa
cific Coast Conference race until the
results of the Stanford-Cal and Ore
gon-O.S.C. games tomorrow are in.

At present the Indians and Beavers !
are tied, but since the latter won j
the game played between the two,
they will receive the Pasadena invi
tation in case of a final tie.
