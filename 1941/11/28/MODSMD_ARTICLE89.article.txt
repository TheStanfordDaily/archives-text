# COACH CLARK HAS FINGERS CROSSED
## Indian Mentor Expects 'Great Football Game' 
### BILL HORNBY 
One mail in all Stanford land really
knows what makes the T maehine
run, and that man, Clark Daniel
Shaughnessy, has his fingers crossed.

Coach Clark has never been an
optimistic soul. When things are
good he holds his peace and waits.
When things are had he admits it
and goes hack to fundamentals.
When things are in the neighborhood
of a toss-up he seems to be in about
the mmul he is in as 1941 Big Game
approaches.

"You are going to see a great foot
ball game. Players always come to a
Big Game in a keyed-up condition.
The spirit of Big Game as a tradi
tional battle rivals and is probably
even greater than that behind east
ern battles like Army-Navy and the
Michigan-Minnesota tilt for the Lit
tle Brown Jug."
How about CALIFORNIA?
CAL WILL BE GOOD
The man who brought Stanford to
the Rose Bowl last season and has
them hoping for another Pasadena
vacation this New Year's, thinks
that the Golden Bear from Berkeley
will be at its peak tomorrow.
"Cal ha.s been steadily improving.
They have looked better in every
game. They will shoot the works
against us."
How about OUR TEAM?
Shaughnessy is again the personi
fication of the crossed finger. "Foot
ball is a game of breaks," he re
marked. "Remember that you only
have eleven men on the field at one
time, and when a key man gets in
jured, it hurts!"
NOT AS WELL PREPARED
Shaughnessy feels that his 1940
Rose Bowl "miracle men" were bet
ter prepared on Big Game eve than
this year's squad, but popping over
to the sunny side he reminds us that
the team this year is just as ready to
keep that axe on the Farm as any
team in Stanford history.
"You bet they will be playing ball.
Your seniors like Albert, Meyers,
Lindskog, Stahle, Meiners, and the
others are playing their last games.
They are out to show their best, and
that means a ball game."
Playing their last game, coach?
HOW ABOUT PASADENA?
"No comment. That's taboo!"
READY IF AND WHEN
Shaughnessy will be ready for
Pasadena if and when. Until then he
isn't telling anybody anything. Ore
gon State will get the nod if it wins
Saturday. That's the only sure
thing.
Leaving this year's tilt to settle it
self, we embarked on a look at Big
Games of the future.
Many times traditional battles lose
their punch after fifty years or so
and gravitate into a glorified alumni
convention. Not so for Stanford and
California.
"Big Games will always be top
football. More men will come up to
fill the shoes of departing players.
They will always be great." That's
what, the top Model T machinist in
the business sees for next year's Big
Game and on down the line.
START NEW SERIES
Stanford plays Notre Dame at
South Bend next year, starting a
new series of grid tilts with a school
that is jersey-deep in tradition. This
series may well develop into a great
traditional clash also, Shaughnessy
thinks.
The coach feels, however, that
Stanford will have to develop more
reserves and bigger squads if they
are definitely heading for big fool
ball with big schools.
That's what Stanford's man of foot
ball is feeling like on Big Game
eventide. Not overly despondent,
he still knows that the Cardinal will
have to wave at full speed to keep at
the top of the mast. We left the
room with our fingers crossed, too.

"Big Games will always be top
football. More men will come up to
fill the shoes of departing players.
They will always be great." That's
what, the top Model T machinist in
the business sees for next year's Big
Game and on down the line.
START NEW SERIES
Stanford plays Notre Dame at
South Bend next year, starting a
new series of grid tilts with a school
that is jersey-deep in tradition. This
series may well develop into a great
traditional clash also, Shaughnessy
thinks.
The coach feels, however, that
Stanford will have to develop more
reserves and bigger squads if they
are definitely heading for big fool
ball with big schools.
That's what Stanford's man of foot
ball is feeling like on Big Game
eventide. Not overly despondent,
he still knows that the Cardinal will
have to wave at full speed to keep at
the top of the mast. We left the
room with our fingers crossed, too.
One mail in all Stanford land really
knows what makes the T maehine
run, and that man, Clark Daniel
Shaughnessy, has his fingers crossed.

Coach Clark has never been an
optimistic soul. When things are
good he holds his peace and waits.
When things are had he admits it
and goes hack to fundamentals.
When things are in the neighborhood
of a toss-up he seems to be in about
the mmul he is in as 1941 Big Game
approaches.

"You are going to see a great foot
ball game. Players always come to a
Big Game in a keyed-up condition.
The spirit of Big Game as a tradi
tional battle rivals and is probably
even greater than that behind east
ern battles like Army-Navy and the
Michigan-Minnesota tilt for the Lit
tle Brown Jug."
How about CALIFORNIA?
CAL WILL BE GOOD
The man who brought Stanford to
the Rose Bowl last season and has
them hoping for another Pasadena
vacation this New Year's, thinks
that the Golden Bear from Berkeley
will be at its peak tomorrow.
"Cal ha.s been steadily improving.
They have looked better in every
game. They will shoot the works
against us."
How about OUR TEAM?
Shaughnessy is again the personi
fication of the crossed finger. "Foot
ball is a game of breaks," he re
marked. "Remember that you only
have eleven men on the field at one
time, and when a key man gets in
jured, it hurts!"
NOT AS WELL PREPARED
Shaughnessy feels that his 1940
Rose Bowl "miracle men" were bet
ter prepared on Big Game eve than
this year's squad, but popping over
to the sunny side he reminds us that
the team this year is just as ready to
keep that axe on the Farm as any
team in Stanford history.
"You bet they will be playing ball.
Your seniors like Albert, Meyers,
Lindskog, Stahle, Meiners, and the
others are playing their last games.
They are out to show their best, and
that means a ball game."
Playing their last game, coach?
HOW ABOUT PASADENA?
"No comment. That's taboo!"
READY IF AND WHEN
Shaughnessy will be ready for
Pasadena if and when. Until then he
isn't telling anybody anything. Ore
gon State will get the nod if it wins
Saturday. That's the only sure
thing.
Leaving this year's tilt to settle it
self, we embarked on a look at Big
Games of the future.
Many times traditional battles lose
their punch after fifty years or so
and gravitate into a glorified alumni
convention. Not so for Stanford and
California.

"You bet they will be playing ball.
Your seniors like Albert, Meyers,
Lindskog, Stahle, Meiners, and the
others are playing their last games.
They are out to show their best, and
that means a ball game."
Playing their last game, coach?
HOW ABOUT PASADENA?
"No comment. That's taboo!"
READY IF AND WHEN
Shaughnessy will be ready for
Pasadena if and when. Until then he
isn't telling anybody anything. Ore
gon State will get the nod if it wins
Saturday. That's the only sure
thing.
Leaving this year's tilt to settle it
self, we embarked on a look at Big
Games of the future.
Many times traditional battles lose
their punch after fifty years or so
and gravitate into a glorified alumni
convention. Not so for Stanford and
California.
"Big Games will always be top
football. More men will come up to
fill the shoes of departing players.
They will always be great." That's
what, the top Model T machinist in
the business sees for next year's Big
Game and on down the line.
START NEW SERIES
Stanford plays Notre Dame at
South Bend next year, starting a
new series of grid tilts with a school
that is jersey-deep in tradition. This
series may well develop into a great
traditional clash also, Shaughnessy
thinks.
The coach feels, however, that
Stanford will have to develop more
reserves and bigger squads if they
are definitely heading for big fool
ball with big schools.
That's what Stanford's man of foot
ball is feeling like on Big Game
eventide. Not overly despondent,
he still knows that the Cardinal will
have to wave at full speed to keep at
the top of the mast. We left the
room with our fingers crossed, too.
