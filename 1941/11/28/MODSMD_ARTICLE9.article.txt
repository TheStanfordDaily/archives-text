# Publicity Questions to Ask? Just Phone Don Liebendorfer
## 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
"Mr. Liebendorfer, Prescott Sullivan is on the phone; have you any
thing for him? Mr. Liebendorfer, Bill Leiser wants you to call him please."
And between worrying about the weather for Saturday's game and
Kmetovic's leg and the San Francisco sports editors, Don Liehendorfer is

trying to arrange for tickets and•
accommodations for all the news
papermen who will be in attend
ance in the press box for the game.
Liebendorfer, an old Daily editor,
became one of the first full-Hedged
college publicity directors for ath
letics alone, shortly alter his gradu
ation from Stanford in 1924.
DIFFERENT SYSTEM
"I work on a different system than
most publicity directors, probably
sending out less 'canned' publicity
than any of the others. I think that
the sports editors won't get tired of
it if they don't see an envelope full
of it every day.
"Probably the best publicity is
that which is done by personal
contacts, interviews and phone calls.
This way, you can help the sports
writer figure out some sort of a dif
ferent 'angle' that will interest the
reader in Stanford (my job) and
make him buy the paper (the
writer's job).
NEED FOR PUBLICITY'
"There are three reasons for the
University having a publicity direc
tor. First, to give the University
publicity, the kind that is good for
its welfare—none of this flashy stuff.
Then there is the welfare of the
team to consider and finally there
are the gate receipts that you can't
ever forget.
Football is the only self-sustaining
sport, and so the team and the
players must always be kept before
the public.

"But of course, when we have a
! year like last year was, we don't
| have anything to do but try to keep
j the interest down. After all, too
| much publicity is as unfortunate for
! the team and for the school as too
1 little publicity during the lean
I years."
A WEEK BEFORE
Liebendorfer, when Stanford plays
| away from here, usually leaves a
J week before the team does. In this
| time, he aids the sports editors for
i their papers, helps arrange radio
I publicity and takes care of the con
i tacts with the alumni of that par-
I ticular city.
Adding further to Mr. Lieben
| dorfer's worries are all the programs
| which have to be written and print
jed up and then distributed. And
j when game time actually rolls
{ around, it's Don Liebendorfer on the
public address system who keeps
j you informed as to who knocked
whose pass out of somebody else's
hands.
KIDS' INTEREST
"One of the most important jobs
jis keeping all the kids interested.
That's why we let them all in free
(in that section down by the goal
post. Who knows—one of those boys
i might be a potentially great full
back. And watching our games, he
might decide that Stanford is the
place he wants to come to college.
