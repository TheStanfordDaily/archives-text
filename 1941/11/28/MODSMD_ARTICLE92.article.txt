## 
### 
As the 2-t- dds favoring Stanford that the bookies have quoted sub
stantiated by the figures? Following is a man-for-man comparison of the
first strings of both teams for each position.
STANFORD POS. CALIFORNIA
MFINERS LER DUNN
Dunn and his alternate, Johnny Ferguson, have a vicious charge that
will worry Albert. Meiners, with an injured hand, has not looked as good
in the last two weeks as he did earlier in the season. EDGE—CAL.
STAMM LTIt HERRERO
Herrero must outshine Stan Cox to gain (he starting position. He has
considerable experience. Stamm is iron man of Card team. Hard man to
move on tackle power plays. EDGE—STANFORD.
TAYLOR LGR STU COX
Cox' size is to his disadvantage. Taylor has been mentioned for All-
American honors. In on almost every play. EDGE—STANFORD.
LINDSKOG C CHRISTIANSEN
Christiansen has been injured and is doubtful starter. I jndskog, backed
by Stahle, makes best center combination on coast. They roam all over on
defense. EDGE—STANFORD.
LAPRADE RGL lIONGOLA
Hongola looked good in last year's Big Game. Witter might get starling
assignment for Bears. LaPrade, although only a sophomore, calls excellent
defensive signals, as well as pushing big hhles in opposing lines. EDGE—
STANFORD.
BANDUCCI RTL RUIN HARD
Reinhard, the Golden Boy of the Golden Bears, has no equal, so they
say. Also punts and catches passes. Banducci goes about his work with a
quiet efficiency. Has been bothered by knee. LDGE—CAL.
MEYER REL LEWIS
Liedholt may start in place of Lewis. Both are good on defense. Meyer,
leading pass catcher in conference, is a definite all-coast, choice. EDGE—
STANFORD.
ALBERT Q MERLO
Merle is a clean blocker and a good signal caller, but has,been bothered
by injuries. Not too experienced either. Albert 'nuff said. LDGE—STAN
FORD.
KMETOVIC LIIR GRAVES
Graves, a chubby soph, gives the Bears a three-man running threat in
the backfield. Kmet, although bothered by an injury, is .still the most
potent single offensive weapon on the coast. LDGE—STANFORD.
ARMSTRONG RIIL DERIAN
Derian, who has shown brilliant flashes this season, is back in shape
after a several-week layoff. Hoot may be superceded at this spot by
Fawcett or Sheller. He's a hard man to stop when he's lugging the ball.
EDGE—CAL.
VUCINICII F M'QUARY
McQuary was a thorn in Indians' side last year. Good passer as well as
runner. Lame Voos is better than no Voos. LDGL—CAL.

leading pass catcher in conference, is a definite all-coast, choice. EDGE—
STANFORD.
ALBERT Q MERLO
Merle is a clean blocker and a good signal caller, but has,been bothered
by injuries. Not too experienced either. Albert 'nuff said. LDGE—STAN
FORD.
KMETOVIC LIIR GRAVES
Graves, a chubby soph, gives the Bears a three-man running threat in
the backfield. Kmet, although bothered by an injury, is .still the most
potent single offensive weapon on the coast. LDGE—STANFORD.
ARMSTRONG RIIL DERIAN
Derian, who has shown brilliant flashes this season, is back in shape
after a several-week layoff. Hoot may be superceded at this spot by
Fawcett or Sheller. He's a hard man to stop when he's lugging the ball.
EDGE—CAL.
VUCINICII F M'QUARY
McQuary was a thorn in Indians' side last year. Good passer as well as
runner. Lame Voos is better than no Voos. LDGL—CAL.
TEAM EDGE—STANFORD 7; CALIFORNIA 4.
As the 2-t- dds favoring Stanford that the bookies have quoted sub
stantiated by the figures? Following is a man-for-man comparison of the
first strings of both teams for each position.
STANFORD POS. CALIFORNIA
MFINERS LER DUNN
Dunn and his alternate, Johnny Ferguson, have a vicious charge that
will worry Albert. Meiners, with an injured hand, has not looked as good
in the last two weeks as he did earlier in the season. EDGE—CAL.
STAMM LTIt HERRERO
Herrero must outshine Stan Cox to gain (he starting position. He has
considerable experience. Stamm is iron man of Card team. Hard man to
move on tackle power plays. EDGE—STANFORD.
TAYLOR LGR STU COX
Cox' size is to his disadvantage. Taylor has been mentioned for All-
American honors. In on almost every play. EDGE—STANFORD.
LINDSKOG C CHRISTIANSEN
Christiansen has been injured and is doubtful starter. I jndskog, backed
by Stahle, makes best center combination on coast. They roam all over on
defense. EDGE—STANFORD.
LAPRADE RGL lIONGOLA
Hongola looked good in last year's Big Game. Witter might get starling
assignment for Bears. LaPrade, although only a sophomore, calls excellent
defensive signals, as well as pushing big hhles in opposing lines. EDGE—
STANFORD.
BANDUCCI RTL RUIN HARD
Reinhard, the Golden Boy of the Golden Bears, has no equal, so they
say. Also punts and catches passes. Banducci goes about his work with a
quiet efficiency. Has been bothered by knee. LDGE—CAL.
MEYER REL LEWIS
Liedholt may start in place of Lewis. Both are good on defense. Meyer,
leading pass catcher in conference, is a definite all-coast, choice. EDGE—
STANFORD.
