# Guenther Sums Up Week-end's Sports Picture
## Games This Saturday Will Decide 'Bowling' Favorites for Season 
### JACK GUENTHER 
NEW YORK, Nov. 27—(UP)—
Gathering up a few loose threads:
College football—The personal rat
ings, and step right up gentlemen,
who'll be the first to yell "bum" this
week —Minnesota, Notre Dame,
Duke, Missouri, Navy, Fordham,
Vanderbilt, Pennsylvania, and Du
quesne. With iust a bit of juggling
places may also be found for Oregon
State, Georgia, Mississippi, and
Clemson. The first four teams have a
fairly solid hold on their positions,
but from there on down its every
man for himself. This week's sched
ule should clarify the standings of
the Navy, Fordham, and Vanderbilt,
as well as the last four named.

Bowling (the football kind)— The
Texas Aggies are definitely not com
mitted to the Cotton Bowl and can
play wherever they want on New
Year's Day providing they get the
invitation. The information comes
directly from Coach Homer Norton,
who can well duplicate the feat of
Tennessee's Bob Neyland in taking
his team to a post-season game three
straight years. The Aggies played in
the Sugar Bowl in 1939 and the Cot
ton Bowl in 1940. This year they ap
pear a cinch to wind up somewhere
again. Norton isn't to be overlooked
for coach of the year honors, either.
He has lost only one game in 33.

Horseracing—Although he won't
come close to Max Hirsch in. the
number of winners saddler, Ben
Jones will lead all thoroughbred
trainers in earnings this year. The
ruddy Kansan collects approximately
$15,000 a season as a» retainer and
this year picked up another $47,499
as his 10 per cent of the Calumet
winnings. Whiqh is another item
that cuts heavily into a stable's earn
ings Although Calumet piled up
$474,991, around $120,000 of the sum
was paid Jones and Wendall Eads
and the other jockeys in salaries and
fees.

Golf—The winter tour mapped
out by Freddie Corcoran will net
the nation's professionals $85,000,
which isn't just tee and tip money
even in these days. The swing
through Florida, Texas, Louisiana,
California, Arizona, the Carolinas,
and Georgia is dotted with 15 tour
naments, topped by the Miami and
Los Angeles affairs at $10,000 each
and none of them worth less than
$5,000. The swing will be touched
off at Miami on December 11 and
will close with the masters at Au
gusta on April 12. This year the
players will break precedent by com
peting in a number of exhibitions,
but the proceeds will go to the
health division of the civilian defense
set-up.

Professional Football—The New
York Giants, who clinched the east
ern division title of the National
league, must be nominated as the
most fearless gents of the year. The
Giants in defeating Washington on
Sunday earned the highly dubious
right to meet either the Chicago
Bears or the Green Bay Packers for
the league championship. In the
last two such divisional play-offs the
west has won by a score of 100-0.
Green Bay whipped the Giants, 27-0
in 1939, and the Bears turned in that
73-0 rout of Washington last year.

Horseracing—Although he won't
come close to Max Hirsch in. the
number of winners saddler, Ben
Jones will lead all thoroughbred
trainers in earnings this year. The
ruddy Kansan collects approximately
$15,000 a season as a» retainer and
this year picked up another $47,499
as his 10 per cent of the Calumet
winnings. Whiqh is another item
that cuts heavily into a stable's earn

$474,991, around $120,000 of the sum
was paid Jones and Wendall Eads
and the other jockeys in salaries and
fees.

Golf—The winter tour mapped
out by Freddie Corcoran will net
the nation's professionals $85,000,
which isn't just tee and tip money
even in these days. The swing
through Florida, Texas, Louisiana,
California, Arizona, the Carolinas,
and Georgia is dotted with 15 tour
naments, topped by the Miami and
Los Angeles affairs at $10,000 each
and none of them worth less than
$5,000. The swing will be touched
off at Miami on December 11 and
will close with the masters at Au
gusta on April 12. This year the
players will break precedent by com
peting in a number of exhibitions,

set-up.

Professional Football—The New
York Giants, who clinched the east
ern division title of the National
league, must be nominated as the
most fearless gents of the year. The
Giants in defeating Washington on
Sunday earned the highly dubious
right to meet either the Chicago
Bears or the Green Bay Packers for
the league championship. In the
last two such divisional play-offs the
west has won by a score of 100-0.
Green Bay whipped the Giants, 27-0

73-0 rout of Washington last year.
NEW YORK, Nov. 27—(UP)—
Gathering up a few loose threads:
College football—The personal rat

who'll be the first to yell "bum" this
week —Minnesota, Notre Dame,
Duke, Missouri, Navy, Fordham,
Vanderbilt, Pennsylvania, and Du

Clemson. The first four teams have a
fairly solid hold on their positions,
