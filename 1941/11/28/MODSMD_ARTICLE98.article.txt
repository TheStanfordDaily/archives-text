# Water Poloists Smash Bears, Clinch Second Spot in League
## 
### 
lii a typical Stanford-California contest, Stanford's varsity water polo
team yesterday copped its scries from the Bears for the first time in seven
years and cinched second place tie in league standings by edging Cal,
7 to ft, in a thriller.
"Everyone was outstanding," said Coach Norton Thornton upon emerg-

from the swimming pool after
| his traditional ducking by his vic
torious team.
Fred Manwaring, senior, and Bob
I Jones paced the Farm scorers with
I two points followed by Frank Mitch
ell, Bill Mapel, and Bert Singer
with one each. High scorer for the
game was Johnny Norris, standout
Be|r forward, who chalkfcd up
four goals.

The game was a see-saw battle all
j the way. A quick 2 to 0 Stanford
lead in the first quarter was wiped
out almost immediately by the Bears
and the period ended with the score
tied, 2 to 2.
With Jones leading the way, the
Indians once more came to the front,
5 to 3, at half time, but the stub
born Berkeleyites came back to
inch their way up to a 6 to 6 dead
lock at the beginning of the fourth
period.

A terrific fourth quarter struggle,
featuring frenzied attempts to score
and excellent stops by goalies Ed
Smith of Stanford and Don Ward of
Cal, was ended when Bert Singer,
reserve forward, took a pass from
Bleecker directly in front of the
cage and slammed in the winning
goal.
Stanford's win gave them a sea
son record of six wins and five losses
and a tie for second place with U.S.C.
in the conference race.

Portland's Harry Kent chalked up
another important mat victory in
San Francisco Tuesday night when
he floored Ivan (Gorilla Man) Ras
putin of Russia. The Russian con
ceded defeat from a stepover toe
hold after 11 Vz minutes of grap
pling.
