# Frosh Mermen Lose to Cubs
## 
### 
A free-scoring second half proved
to be disastrous for Stanford's fresh
man water polo team yesterday as
the California frosh made it two
straight over the Indian babes, 9 to 6.

The Papeese held high scoring
Stan Morketter, Bear forward, to
just three points, but allowed his
teammate, Dick Shott, to break away
for five tallies. Leading the En
cina scorers was Dick Narver with
three points, followed by Alan
Weeden with two and Hank Salton
stall with one.

Spotting California a 2 to 1 first
quarter lead, Narver, Saltonstall,
and Weeden each scored to tie the
contest up, 4 to 4, at halftime. But
the forward combination of Shott
Morketter soon regained its po
tency, pitching the visitors from
Berkeley into a 7 to 5 third quarter
margin and eventually the game.
Stanford's starting lineup included
Bob Mapel and Saltonstall, forwards;
Narver, goalie; Phil Lee, centerback;
Pete Hatch and Alan Weeden,
guards; and Jim Noble, goalie.
