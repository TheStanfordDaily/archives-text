## 'We Face Guns,' Wilbur Warns Student Body 
### 
"We're right up against the guns,"
President Ray Lyman Wilbur told a
sober audience of 3,500 students and
faculty members which overflowed
the Memorial Auditorium yester
day. It was the largest crowd ever
to hear a speech in the auditorium.
Speaking on "The Stanford Stu
dent in the War Crisis," Dr. Wilbur
asserted, "We've got to eliminate the
Japanese as a major power in the
Pacific. There is no safety for Cali
fornia or for the United States until
they are eliminated."
"You can well realize we have had
a very heavy blow in the Pacific,"
said Dr. Wilbur. "We are in a hole.
The British are in a hole, and our
difficulties are going to increase in
stead of decrease."
VALUE OF BRAINS
Dr. Wilbur, who had just returned
from a State Defense Council meet
ing in Los Angeles, stressed the
value of using brains intelligently
and wisely.
"An engineering student who can
get a new idea that will make an
airplane go twenty miles faster per
hour is worth a hundred thousand
men in uniform," said Dr. Wilbur.
He advised students to "be very
reluctant to drop out of the Uni
versity. The government will pull
you out if it wants you. You don't
have to volunteer."
TOLERANCE ASKED
In a plea for tolerance toward Jap
anese students, Dr. Wilbur said,
"They are just as good Stanford
people as we are."
In conclusion, Dr. Wilbur stressed
the necessity of complete co-opera
tion, particularly in enforcing black
outs. "Remember," he said, "in war
we don't pay much attention to ex
cuses. Either you do it or you don't
do it. If you don't do it you get
knocked on the head and that's all
there is to it."

and wisely.
"An engineering student who can
get a new idea that will make an
airplane go twenty miles faster per
hour is worth a hundred thousand
men in uniform," said Dr. Wilbur.
He advised students to "be very
reluctant to drop out of the Uni
versity. The government will pull
you out if it wants you. You don't
have to volunteer."
TOLERANCE ASKED
In a plea for tolerance toward Jap
anese students, Dr. Wilbur said,
"They are just as good Stanford
people as we are."
In conclusion, Dr. Wilbur stressed
the necessity of complete co-opera
tion, particularly in enforcing black
outs. "Remember," he said, "in war
we don't pay much attention to ex
cuses. Either you do it or you don't
do it. If you don't do it you get
knocked on the head and that's all
there is to it."
