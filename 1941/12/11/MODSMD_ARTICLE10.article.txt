### 
"The campus deserves a pat a»*
the back," said Frank F. Walker, co
chairman of the Stanford Civilian
Defense Committee, as he watched
the 1500-acre campus blot out las<
night at 7:0.» in a practice blackout-
Three minutes after the power
house whistle sounded four series of
two blasts most of the campus was
completely dark. So effective was
the blackout that Walker ordered
the all-clear sounded 10 minutes
early at 7:10 p.m.
FROM ATOP THE IJBE
Officially observing the blackout
from the top of the Hoover Library,
Walker, Ernest S. Erwin, and Col,
Harry D. Allen were exceptionally
pleased with the excellent co-opera
tion of the students and residents
living on the campus.
Even though the blackout was al
most perfect, several bad spots
showed up distinctly. Encina corri
dor and kitchen lights remained on
for about five minutes before finally
extinguished. A few automobile and
bicycle lights and some cigarette
lights flickered on and off during tho
blackout period.

"We'll probably have to paint the
Encina corridor windows black s»
that hall lights may remain on with
out ruining the blackout," said
Walker.
He pointed out that corridor light?
in all living groups should remain
on, but invisible from outside, dur
ing blackouts. Keeping these vital,
arteries open is essential in casa
buildings should have to be evacu
ated.

A powerful 10-inch whistle will
