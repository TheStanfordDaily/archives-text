## Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses Nippon Loses Three Transports in Action 
### United Press 
A powerful Japanese force,
supported by heavy naval
strength, has attacked the
Philippines and landed an in
vasion party on the northern
end of Luzon island but has
been repulsed with apparently
heavy losses on the island's
west coast.
The U.S. War Department's sec
ond communique of the war told of
the assault, aimed at an approach on

Manila from the back door of the
Philippine capital, situated on the
southern end of the Luzon island.
The Japanese landing was made
at Aparri, on the mouth of the
Cagayan River, and appeared al
most useless from an invasion stand
point since the country inland from
Aparri is largely trackless mountain
wilderness.
A landing on the west coast would
be more available to the Japs, since
some railroad facilities are available
there. These attacks, north of San
Fernando, were repulsed, accord
ing to the communique, which de
scribed day-long intermittent air at
tacks against Luzon's military and
naval installations, with those at the
naval base in Cavite "particularly
heavy."
The Japs made their landing at
tempts at points along a 150-mile
stretch of Luzon's northwest and
north coasts and succeeded at Apar
ri on the north coast, "and perhaps
other points."
