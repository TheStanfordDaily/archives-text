### 
LONDON, Dec. 10 (UP).—Britain
acknowledged today that the new
35,000 - ton battleship Prince of
Wales and the battle cruiser Repulse
had been sunk in action against the
Japanese off Malaya, raising the
questions of whether airplanes had
won mastery over battleships or
whether some hitherto unreported
Axis super-dreadnaught was oper
ating in Asiatic waters.
A third possibility was discussed
here — the often-rumored Japanese
"human torpedoes." Several ex
perts said it was possible that Japa
nese pilots had loaded their planes
with high explosives and dived them
into both ships, and that they might
have done the same thing agairjst
United States ships at Pearl Harbor.
This theory, they said, was sup
ported by the well-known fatalism
of the Japanese.
The losses, announced by Prime
Minister Churchill in a grave ses
sion of Commons, left Britain with
20 capital ships afloat or building,
including four 40.000-ton dread
naughts not yet completed.
Churchill said only th;it, accord
ing to word from Singapore, the
Prince of Wales and Repulse were
sunk "whilst carrying out operations
against the Japanese in attacks on
Malaya."

ficials revealed for the first time that
Singapore had been made available
as a base for United States warships.
