# Six Lessons For Fun In A Blackout
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Following is a guide of conduct be
coming to a Stanford man and/or
woman during the time they are in
the dark officially in a blackout.
1. Rise from the table. Count ten
to make sure that the noise isn't
the carillon playing "The Slant-
Eyed Strutters' Ball." Tie your
hasher under the table so that you
can find him when digestion re
sumes. (By special arrangement
with Nippon agents, air raids at
Stanford must occur at dinner. Thus
bombing doesn't leave a taste in
one's mouth.)
2. Retire to a living group, prefer
ably your own. Make sure that it
is your living group by becoming
acquainted with the first person you
find under your bed. If it is your
roommate file him where you can
find him if you need him. If not,
remember that the Stanford tradi
tion of friendliness must live on de
spite the emergency.
3. Strap on your blackout kit. The
blackout kit for the average Stan
fordite should contain the following
essentials.
COMPLETE KIT
One pair of tweezers good either
for stamp collecting or cactus pull
ing depending on the individual.
Lipstick and Kleenex.
Bags, paper or otherwise.
A Bawlout to determine authen
ticity of suspicious persons.
A pair of brass knuckles or a
Junior G Man badge to enforce your
decision if you hit the jackpot in
your investigations.
A Prayer Book or a pair of dice.
All types mingle in a blackout.
Some band-aids and a bottle of
iodine for the frequent discussions
with trees, fire plugs, fenders, and
for arguments in general.
During the remainder of the
blackout proper, the individual may
suit his own tastes. If you wish to
study forget it. If you don't wish
to study don't think about it.
BLACKOUT HIGH LIFE
The blackout date is growing in
popularity. Requisites for such a
social excursion include a dark per
sonality, a dark outlook, and a 15-
cent map of the campus. It has been :
suggested that a licorice coke be !
invented to match the colo*' vchonie. j
Other possible equipment would in
iÂ«ie a portable phonograph with
records of "Mood Indigo," "Deep !
Purple," "Lights Out," etc.
If the person wishes to take ad- [
vantage of the dark hours for medi- j
tation, a Ouija board is great sport
because it can be played in the dark :
and keeps one in the dark.
HELPFUL HINTS
You could also spend your spare
time thinking of new slogans for j
stickers such as "Honk Hirohito," or i
"Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin the j
Japanese."
You will recognize the all clear
by another siren. If you want to
leave what you are doing you may
return to your dinner, take your
hasher from under the table, and i
continue. Always repack your!
Blackout Kit to be ready for the
next raid. Please return all silver
ware.
