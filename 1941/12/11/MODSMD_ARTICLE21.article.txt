## 
### 
Highlights from President Ray Ly
man Wilbur's address yesterday on
"The Stanford Student in the War
Crisis" are listed below:
"Force lias become the important
thing in many parts of the world.
By a process which we have
watched in Europe and now see in
Japan, the very worst elements
have come to the top. We call it
gangsterism. . . . We're down to
plain deceit and plain murder."
"We're Americans. We're in a j
democracy. Democracy is slow to
anger, but the kind of blow that we
have had has only one answer.
We've got to eliminate the Japanese
as a major power in the Pacific.
There is no safety for California or
for the United States until they are
eliminated."
BLOW IN PACIFIC
"You can well realize we have
had a very heavy blow in the Pacific.
We are in a hole. The British are in
a hole, and our difficulties are going
to increase instead of decrease.
Whether we have any mastery at all
in the Pacific is yet to be shown.
The outstanding thing is that the air
plane has become the most powerful
of all weapons."

. . the thing that wins these
wars is not brutality but brutality
plus the product of brains ... be
very reluctant to drop out of the
University. The government will
pull you out if it wants you. You
don't have to volunteer."
"You may not think it is important
to graduate. You may get hysterical
and think you've got to do this or
that, or your parents may, but be
careful not to get dislocated or let
somebody dislocate you."
REAL BLACKOUTS
"To protect ourselves we've got to
do the right thing and do it prompt
ly! If a blackout is ordered, it must
be a real blackout. And there's no
time for horseplay or monkey busi
ness. This is reality. We're right up
against the guns! And when we're
up against the guns we act accord
ingly."
"We've got to so organize that
we don't get heated and hyster
ical or we'll find we can't meet the
situation."
"The experience of last night in
dicates that we must enforce strict
compliance with our regulations by
users of automobiles. The lights on
cars might defeat our blackout."

do the right thing and do it prompt
ly! If a blackout is ordered, it must
be a real blackout. And there's no
time for horseplay or monkey busi
ness. This is reality. We're right up
against the guns! And when we're
up against the guns we act accord
ingly."
"We've got to so organize that
we don't get heated and hyster
ical or we'll find we can't meet the
situation."
"The experience of last night in
dicates that we must enforce strict
compliance with our regulations by
users of automobiles. The lights on
cars might defeat our blackout."
Highlights from President Ray Ly
man Wilbur's address yesterday on
"The Stanford Student in the War
Crisis" are listed below:
"Force lias become the important
thing in many parts of the world.
By a process which we have
watched in Europe and now see in
Japan, the very worst elements
have come to the top. We call it
gangsterism. . . . We're down to
plain deceit and plain murder."
"We're Americans. We're in a j
democracy. Democracy is slow to
anger, but the kind of blow that we
have had has only one answer.
We've got to eliminate the Japanese
as a major power in the Pacific.
There is no safety for California or
for the United States until they are
eliminated."
BLOW IN PACIFIC
"You can well realize we have
had a very heavy blow in the Pacific.
We are in a hole. The British are in
a hole, and our difficulties are going
to increase instead of decrease.
Whether we have any mastery at all
in the Pacific is yet to be shown.
The outstanding thing is that the air
plane has become the most powerful
of all weapons."

. . the thing that wins these
wars is not brutality but brutality
plus the product of brains ... be
very reluctant to drop out of the
University. The government will
pull you out if it wants you. You
don't have to volunteer."
"You may not think it is important
to graduate. You may get hysterical
and think you've got to do this or
that, or your parents may, but be
careful not to get dislocated or let
somebody dislocate you."
REAL BLACKOUTS
"To protect ourselves we've got to
do the right thing and do it prompt
ly! If a blackout is ordered, it must
be a real blackout. And there's no
time for horseplay or monkey busi
ness. This is reality. We're right up
against the guns! And when we're
