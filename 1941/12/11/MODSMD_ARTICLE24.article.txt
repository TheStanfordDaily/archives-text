### AMIE REICHERT 
most terrible and terrifying thing about Japan's
lightning attack on the U.S. is the fact that every
one was surprised; the fact that while we all should
have expected it to come someday, and that we all
really did expect it to come someday, we regarded
hat someday as a thing in the distant, hazy, never-to
be realized future.
When it did come, even our Naval Intel
ligence department was surprised; even our see
all, know-alls of the Philippines and Hawaii and
Washington were caught vacationing for the week
end. And so the Japanese bombers got through.
America was, in that moment, dangerously unpre
pared. That is the terrifying part.
The reaction of the people of this country indicates
clearly that we have deluded ourselves with a false
notion of security, a security that exists no more for
us in these days of the long-range bomber and the
nfth-column, than it did for France with her "impreg
nable ' line of defense. We have pitifully underesti
nated the Japanese, that much is obvious, and we have
dl of us labored under a paralyzing M;iginot delusion.

f AST month an anonymous Admiral in Washington
was asked how long it would take to sink the en
ire Japanese Navy. "Oh," he replied blithely, "we
could take care of them easily some morning between
breakfast and lunch."
There have of course been a few weak voices
eying in the wilderness that a war with Japan
would be no push-over, that it might take a long
time, that it would mean a blockade of the island
empire which ..uu'.d b no swift simple strategy.
They were drowned out. silenced by the flag
wavers, the blow-hards, and the well-meaning but
uninformed. If the Naval and War Departments*
brass hats of this nation have as little and as
misleading information at their disposal about the
strength of the Japanese and their German friends
as has been dished out to the general citizenry in
'he past few years, we will really be in a sorry
state.
The suddenness, and what is more important, the
nitial success of the Japanese attack has had an in
valuable effect, on the mass mind of America. It has
awakened the nation to the gravity of the international
threat, to the complete fallibility of the isolationists
who pooh-poohed the idea of an attack on this country
from overseas, who pointed reassuringly to our oceans
and lulled the gullible populace almost to sleep with
it hypnotic and deadly song of the waves,
« * * in
|>LANES over San Francisco, air raid alarms, black
outs —these have brought home more clearly, more
norribly the reality of war. the unreality of isolation
ism, than anything the so-called alarmists were able
to say.
We are just now starting to do many of the
things the "alarmists" and "war mongers" pleaded
with us to do years ago. We are losing our letli
*u"gy> our indifference, our smugness—for that,
thank you, Japan. We are putting our aircraft
production on a 24-hour basis, we are organizing
home guard and civilian defense units. Above all,
we are realizing the danger, recognizing the threat,
knowing .just cno-gh fear to call forth the best,
most courageous effort. That is good.
We must not make the final, fatal mistake of dis
associating the intentions or machinations of the Japa
nese irom their German and Italian allies. We must
•ealize the tremendous stake Adolf. Hitler has in all
i this. We must understand now that it can be done,
'hat the trip by plane from the west coast of Na?.i
lominated French North Africa is nothing compared
,o the distances the Japanese have apparently come.
The President has said we shall be victorious.

but it will not be ail easily-purchased or a quick
triumph. Japan U only the first line of offense.
America's victory too will he wrought i>f the hlootl.
sweat, and tears of her people.
