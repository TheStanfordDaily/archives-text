### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
FOR THE FUTURE
WOKE up and they told us that Japanese planes
had attacked Hawaii. That Pearl Harbor had
been bombed and that soon the United States would
declare war ou the Japanese. All that day we went
through the motions of studying and listened to the
radio for news from the East. We heard that England
had declared war, that Canada had declared war, that
Australia had declared war, that the Dutch East Indies
had declared war, that Free France had declared war,
that a lot of countries had declared war on the sur
prising Japanese. That night We slept, thinking about
the coming day, thinking about what Congress and the
President would do, not thinking very much about,
books and classes even though it was fast coming time
for finals.
We woke up agnin the next morning and heard fur
ther news of the raids the Japanese were carrying on
against the islands. Bombing, with amazing accuracy
and we were all surprised because we thought the Japa
nese were impotent. We were all very surprised at the
speed and power of the Japanese and we couldn't un
derstand how the islands were left unprotected like
they were and how it was possible for the Japanese to
get their ships so close.
â™¦ * * *
then the President spoke and declared that war
was already in existence and everyone in Con
gress agreed with the President, except Jeanette Rankin
from Montana who courageously, with tears in her
eyes, voted against a war that already was, and thus
maintained her consistent stand against war, and even
against living, if it meant fighting back.
And so we were at war, and we tried to think that
books and classes were important and we kept right
on with our work, only stopping now and then to listen
to the news reports. And then that night the lights
went out. Palo Alto was in a blackout. We were in a
blackout. We quit studying again and bought candles
and learned that enemy planes were flying over San
Francisco. Everyone became scared and nervous, but
more than that everyone began rushing around, laugh
ing and joking about being dead in a year and on the
whole acting like it was all a carnival. And all that
night we kept thinking about big bombers with bombs
that could drop and kill and how funny it was to think
that where we were was the main spot of the war,
that we were now in the middle of the whole thing.
* * * #
then the next day came and we listened to the
radio and heard them say that San Francisco
came through its first blackout in fine style, and that
the people weren't nervous and that talk in the restau
rants and on street corners showed a grim determina
tion to wipe out the Japanese for what they had done.
It sounded like .they were talking about London, but
it wasn't the London street corners and restaurants they
were talking about, but the ones in a city thirty miles
away from us.
And froru now that is the wa> it's going to be. For
at least the next tour years that is the way it's going
to be. for that is how long the military experts predict
it will take before we can completely rid the world of
its latest menace. For lour years we will hear sirens
and hear bombers and live in blackouts and we will
come close to death and we will all suffer and our
lives will never be the same, never will it be like it
is now. But we must forget about ourselves and our
troubles and we must work, and work hard and suffer
even as other peoples have done before us, so that
some time in the future people can live again, be
born, go to school, play, go to movies, drink chocolate
sodas, fall in love, marry, and-work, so that people can
live again sometime in the future, even if it be for only
a little while.
