## AMERICAN-JAPANESE THANKS

(Editors Note: The following was addressed
to Dr. Wilbur by the Japanese Student Association
of Stanford.)
JJEAR DR. WILBUR:
It has been with increasing concern that we have
noted the developments in international relationship
which have finally culminated in the declaration of
war between our country and Japan.
As American citizens of Japanese ancestry, we have
been prepared to assume and discharge our duties and
responsibilities which have been placed upon us. Yet
little did we dream that we would be called upon to
prove our loyalty under the circumstances in which
we now find ourselves.
Realizing the necessity of unity in the critical period
ahead, we, the members of the Japanese Student As
sociation, pledge our full vsupport in the present emer
gency.
If we can be of service in any manner you deem
necessary, please feel free to call upon us at any time.
Very sincerely yours,
The Japanese Student Association
of Stanford University
Yoshiro Oishi, President
Peter Ida, Secretary
