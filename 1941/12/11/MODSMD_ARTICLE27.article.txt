# How to Aid in Crisis- Save, Knit, Buy Bonds
## 
### 
''What can I do to help?"
That's the question on- everybody's- lips today. It is a question with s
million answers. Here are a few of them—a few ways in which you csu*
help in this emergency.
Volunteer for Civilian Defense. There is afr-office in Palo Alto, anil,

according to Frank Walker,- finan-
cial vice-president, a similar office
will soon be set up on the campus.
Go down and sign up.- There are a
hundred jobs you can fill.
SAVERS' NEEDED
Become a "saver." Collect string,
paper, rags, tinfoil, and all such
products which the government
needs desperately, and which you
may soon need yourself due to prior
ities. If you collect such materials,
contact the proper agency so that
they may put it into use.
Save gasoline. Don't drive as
much as you have been. The gaso
line is needed elsewhere. Take bet
ter care of your clothes, your auto
mobile, all your belongings. It will
help if your demand for such prod
ucts is diminished.
WOMEN MUST KNIT
And you women, knit. Knit like
mad. Or sew clothes. Or wrap
bandages. Or take first-aid courses.
Spend your time constructively, as
was suggested by President Wilbur.
Don't throw away those magazines
and newspapers. They are valuable.
Don't spread rumors. Things
spread and grow too rapidly. If you
hear others blabbing, tell them to do
less talking and more thinking. Be
lieve one-tenth of what you hear.
DON'T TELEPHONE
Don't telephone as much. Keep
the lines cleared for more important
work. Write less. Keep the mails
cleared of clutterings. And when I
you write, don't spread hearsay ru
mors.
Buy practical gifts at Christmas.
Buy necessities rather than luxuries.
Buy Defense Bonds and stamps.
They will help the government
greatly to do the job it must.
SAVE BOBBIE-PINS
Women—take care of those bob
bie-pins, hairpins, safety pins, curl
ers and the like. They are going to
become very scarce. Don't tax your
government by continuing crying for
more.
Place your name on the waiting
lists of all the defense organizations
you can find. Be ready tQ serve at
a moment's notice. Orient yourself
and help the defense organizations to
orient themselves.
DO YOUR PART
Listen only to those who have au
thority to speak.
Do your part. It is your responsi
bility.
Sacrifice.
And most important, as Mrs. Roo
sevelt said in a very recent radio
address, "Keep L«ughing."

And most important, as Mrs. Roo
sevelt said in a very recent radio
address, "Keep L«ughing."
''What can I do to help?"
That's the question on- everybody's- lips today. It is a question with s
million answers. Here are a few of them—a few ways in which you csu*
help in this emergency.
Volunteer for Civilian Defense. There is afr-office in Palo Alto, anil,

according to Frank Walker,- finan-
cial vice-president, a similar office
will soon be set up on the campus.
Go down and sign up.- There are a
hundred jobs you can fill.
SAVERS' NEEDED
Become a "saver." Collect string,
paper, rags, tinfoil, and all such
products which the government
needs desperately, and which you
may soon need yourself due to prior
ities. If you collect such materials,
contact the proper agency so that
they may put it into use.
Save gasoline. Don't drive as
much as you have been. The gaso
line is needed elsewhere. Take bet
ter care of your clothes, your auto
mobile, all your belongings. It will
help if your demand for such prod
ucts is diminished.
WOMEN MUST KNIT
And you women, knit. Knit like
mad. Or sew clothes. Or wrap
bandages. Or take first-aid courses.
Spend your time constructively, as
was suggested by President Wilbur.
Don't throw away those magazines
and newspapers. They are valuable.
Don't spread rumors. Things
spread and grow too rapidly. If you
hear others blabbing, tell them to do
less talking and more thinking. Be
lieve one-tenth of what you hear.
DON'T TELEPHONE
Don't telephone as much. Keep
the lines cleared for more important
work. Write less. Keep the mails
cleared of clutterings. And when I
you write, don't spread hearsay ru
mors.
Buy practical gifts at Christmas.
Buy necessities rather than luxuries.
Buy Defense Bonds and stamps.
They will help the government
greatly to do the job it must.
SAVE BOBBIE-PINS
Women—take care of those bob
bie-pins, hairpins, safety pins, curl
ers and the like. They are going to
become very scarce. Don't tax your
government by continuing crying for
more.
Place your name on the waiting
lists of all the defense organizations
you can find. Be ready tQ serve at
a moment's notice. Orient yourself
and help the defense organizations to
orient themselves.
DO YOUR PART
Listen only to those who have au
thority to speak.
Do your part. It is your responsi
bility.
