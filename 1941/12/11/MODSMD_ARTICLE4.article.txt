# Stanford Men Enlist Slowly
## 
### 
Steadied by President Wilbur's
"wait-until-you-are-called" speech,
Stanford men apparently will con
tinue carrying books rather than
guns for the present.
Survey of the campus last night
revealed very few men on campus
have actually enlisted, although a
sizeable number are investigating
the various branches of service.
Ensign George Vaughn inter
viewed 50 Stanford men Tuesday
applying for the Naval Air Corps.
Preliminary applications were made
by 19 men.
Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovic,
Ken Robesky, and hTor Peterson
sent applications to Lieutenant Com
mander Gene Tunney in charge of
physical instruction personnel for
the navy.
Army, navy, and Marine Corps re
cusing offices in San Francisco re
port Stanford men are inquiring
about opportunities in the various
branches: engineering, public rela
tions, intelligence, communication,
ordnance, air corps, and the various
others.
Already, however, a few Stanford
men have been called up by the
Naval Reserve. Three of these are
Carter Barber, Colgate Dorr, and
Dick Lyon.
The army has claimed the major
ity of Stanford alumni now serving
in the fighting services, with the
Marine Corps and the navy rating
in that order. Because the stations

changed since the actual declaration
of war, it is not possible to state ac
curately the posts where Stanford
men are serving. The most recent
