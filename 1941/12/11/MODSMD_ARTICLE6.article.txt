# Blackout Instructions
## 
### 
TWO blasts of the whistle on the Power House repeated FOUR times is a
signal for an air raid approach and a blackout.
FIVE BLASTS repeated FOUR times is the signal for the auxiliary squad.
FOUR blasts repeated FOUR times is the All Clear signal.
In case of an Air Raid warning and Blackout:
(1) Be calm and do not phone. It is imperative that all telephone
lines be kept clear.
(2) Automobile drivers pull over to the curb and put out lights.
If you are not sure whether a blackout is in effect, check the street
lights.
(3) Keep all bicycles off of the street and walk bicycles home on
sidewalk. Go to your living quarters and stay there.
(4) Point flashlights at ceiling or floor, not toward windows.
Candles are to be concealed, shades drawn.
(5) If a warning occurs when you are in your quarters, either
during the day or night, remain there.
(6) If a warning occurs at night when you are in the Library, a
classroom, or other public building, leave immediately and walk to
your living quarters. Public buildings will be blacked out at night
five minutes after warning (or sooner if necessary) in order to make
the campus completely dark.
(7) If warning occurs when you are in a classroom, Library, or
other public building during the day, remain there.
(8) If warning occurs at night and you are in a dormitory, remain
in your room. All dormitories which are not adequately equipped
with shades to conceal lights, will be blacked out by turning off all
of the lights in the building. Emergency lights will be available in
dormitories during blackouts.
(9) All living groups must co-operate in making the blackout a
success. If the shades of your windows are not satisfactory, turn
out all lights in the rooms involved. This is a matter of mutual co
operation and protection.
Everyone is cautioned to do nothing which might add to the confusion,
such as shouting, blowing of automobile horns, and other unnecessary
noises.
