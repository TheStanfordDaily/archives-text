# Stanford Civilian Defense Discusses Blackout Problems
## 
### 
Stanford's Civilian Defense Committee shifted into high gear yesterday
afternoon in a two-hour session dealing principally with the immediate
problem of blacking out Stanford in event of air raid alarms.
Plans were laid for the practice blackout of last night described in an

4.adjoining column.
The main problem discussed by
the committee in discussing the im
perfections in Tuesday night's
blackout concerned lights of class
rooms and offices on the Quad. The
main lighting circuit for the Quad
and other academic buildings cannot
be cut since vital research and ex
periments being carried on in these
buildings are dependent on an un
broken 24-hour supply of current.
Locking of either classrooms or
entire buildings at nightfall was dis
cussed. A definite ruling will be
issued in a day or two.
Presidents and managers in all
living groups, including halls, were
instructed through the Dean of Men
to be responsible for their quarters
in event of a blackout warning.
NEW WARNING WHISTLE
It was determined that present
! warning whistles are not satisfac
tory and E. S. Erwin reported that
| a double-tone 10-inch steam whistle
j was being secured and would prob
i ably be installed in the power house
j by tonight.
It was reported that arrangements
are being worked out to get direct
wire connections with the Fourth
Interceptor Command in San Fran
cisco to eliminate confusion in veri
fying reported air raid warnings.
At present the reports come from
i both Palo Alto and Moffett Field. A
direct wire was installed yesterday
from University headquarters to the
power house so that warnings may
be sounded as soon as received.
In discussing phone communica
tion, Frank F. Walker urged all stu
dents to refrain from using phones
during blackouts. "The lines are
needed for urgent communications,"
he said.
He added that the University ex
change was completely clogged
Tuesday night with people asking
foolish questions, thus holding up
necessary calls.
Miss Yost reminded that if there
is doubt whether a blackout has
been ordered to look at the street
lights; if they are out, then the
blackout order is official.
It was decided not to keep the
University switchboard open all
night permanently.
Police are going to enforce the
rule stating that all cars must turn
off all lights during a blackout and
stop immediately on hearing the
signal. Cars will not be permitted to
move in blackouts until some form
of headlight shielding has been
tested and approved.
Paul Davis added that it is essen
tial Stanford blackout completely,
not only for her own protection but
to keep from acting as a guide for
enemy planes to military objectives
like Permanente and MofTett.
Subcommittees were appointed to
report today on appointing voluntary
auxiliary committees to aid fire and
police departments, to aid in care of
injured, and to act as "watch offi
cers."
