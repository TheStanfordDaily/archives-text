# Stanford Civilian Defense Discusses Blackout Problems

### 
Stanford's Civilian Defense Committee shifted into high gear yesterday
afternoon in a two-hour session dealing principally with the immediate
problem of blacking out Stanford in event of air raid alarms.
Plans were laid for the practice blackout of last night described in an

The main problem discussed by
the committee in discussing the im

blackout concerned lights of class
rooms and offices on the Quad. The
main lighting circuit for the Quad

periments being carried on in these

Presidents and managers in all
living groups, including halls, were
instructed through the Dean of Men
to be responsible for their quarters
in event of a blackout warning.
