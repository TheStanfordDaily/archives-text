A Message to AH the Students:
After Dr. Wilbur's talk today,
there is little left for anyone else
to say. He showed us the serious
ness of the situation in concrete,
realistic terms. He emphasized the
patriotic duty of each student to
do his work as a student until he
or she has a clear summons to
service somewhere else. . . .
Those of us who have been close
to the students these last days
realize how justified is this confi
dence. We understand the strain
the students are under, the temp
tation to live for the minute, the
temptation to lot the disruption of
war relax self-discipline, but we
have seen very few instances of
students who have gone to pieces
under the strain or who have
yielded to the temptation.
Will you let me say that in the
years I have been here at Stan
ford I have never been so proud
of the student body, nor more
hopeful of its future than I am to
night? Whatever comes, I know
the vast majority will meet it as
men and women should. For the
next few days focus on your aca
demic work. Not only is this nec
essary in order to finish this quar
ter with satisfaction to yourself
and to the University, but also
you will find that work can be a
great force to steady and calm you
in times of excitement and uncer
tainty My best wishes to each of
you.
