# History ... 1942

### AMIE REICHERT 
JT'S "History's 1942" now. The
New Year has begun with the
U.S. on the defensive, and it will
probably end that way. Our Brit
ish, Russian, Chinese, and Dutch
allies meanwhile hold the enemy at
arms' length on all the far-flung
battle-lines of this world conflict.
1942. It is America's year to
get going. To produce planes and
tanks and guns and ships in num
bers undreamed of before. To
train men for the battle-line and
the assembly-line. To ring our
coasts with steel and set our
guards about watching the skies
for the planes which will one day
come to fire our cities.
We thought everybody knew this.
At least we thought everybody knew
that the U.S. is at war (the papers
have mentioned that fact now and
again the past few weeks) and all
this activity would seem to prove
that it isn't just an idle rumor.

B UT , we know one man who isn't
taking any chances. No siree,
Bob. Mayor Angelo J. Rossi, of our
sister-community San Francisco, is
not being swept along in any tide of
war hysteria or alarmist propaganda.
He's just sitting tight.
Several weeks ago New York's
effervescent, efficient, ebullient
KHtle Flower flew into San Fran
cisco in a whirlwind to organize
a much-needed Civilian Defense
for the city. He bustled and raged
and roared. And when he left a
day later Ik? had handed Mayor
Rossi a carefully-planned outline
of civilian defense organization.
It would appear that the San
Francisco mayor, hard pressed by
his numerous other duties, has not
had time to study and act on La-
Guardia's instructions, because Sat
urday night San Francisco had its
fourth or fifth blackout and nobody
in the whole city was more confused
than its Honorable Mayor.

the lights went out, as it hap
pened, but that wasn't the May
or's fault—he was just as surprised
as everyone else. All the various
heads of the many branches of the
Civilian Defense organization were
supposed to meet in the Mayor's of
fice as soon as the blackout started.
None of them were there. The
Mayor was, hut, as lie told re
porters later, lie just happened
along by accident. Dr. J. C. Geiger,
head of the city's Department of
Health, and Civilian Defense Di
rector Charles Dullca were wan
dering around in the dark, appar
ently. Anyway, they were no
where to lie found.
Several weeks ago San Francisco
got a brand new set of air raid sirens,
but the Mayor never thought of hav
ing them tested, with the result that
Saturday night, when they were
called upon to warn the presence of
two squadrons of unidentified planes
only 80 miles out, half the city never
heard them, and the other half
thought they were fog horns or the
wail of hysterical women.
On our block, one of the Civilian
Defense hig shots was so drunk
lie couldn't stand, and the cop on
the beat couldn't decide whether
he had the right to break in the
doors of the vacant Japanese em
bassy, where all the lights were
blazing.

B UT the neatest quips of the week
were the remarks of Rossi and
Dullea when reporters asked them
what in God's name they would have
done if bombs had been dropped.
Rossi said airily, "What arc you
worrying ahout—no bombs fell,
did they?" And Dullea countered,
"We'd have turned on the lights
and gone to work."
Rossi finished this memorable
press conference with a self-made
round of applause for himself and
his associates. "The Civilian De
fense program is in good shape," he
said confidently. "There is absolute
ly no question about that."

Itut apparently there were quite
a few questions about it, because
yesterday Dullea announced a
shake-up in the organization which
will realign defense responsibili
ties. From here on in wc can only
keep our fingers crossed. Anyway,
Rossi is confident.
