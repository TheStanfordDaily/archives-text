Air Raid Signals are as follows:

Disaster: Series of live blasts repeated for five minutes.
All Clear: Steady blast on the siren for approximately two minute?.
1. Day or night, be calm and do not telephone. It is imperative ibat all telephone lines be
kept clear.
2. Avoid doing anything which adds to confusion such as shouting, blowing automobile
horns, and making other unnecessary noises.
3. Automobile drivers must pull over to the curb, turn oil the motor, and at night put
out the lights. Campus police have been instructed strictly to enforce this regulation.
4. When an air raid warning sounds after dark, all student residences and dormitories
must be blacked out immediately.
Arrangements with regard to materials for the physical black-out and tlie organi
zation of the members of the living groups to meet emergency needs must be approved
by the person designated by the Dean of Men and Dean of Women. Until such ap
proval lias been secured, all lights must be extinguished when an air raid warning
sounds after dark.
\
5. Keep all bicycles off the street and walk bicycles home on sidewalk.
6. Use no flashlights in the open, if used inside llic house, flashlights must be shielded
so that no light is visible through openings.
7. Do not smoke or strike matches in the open.
Jj. On account of reflection from the lop of chimneys, fires in open fireplaces must be
extinguished during the black-out period.
9. II a warning occurs during either day or night when you are in your house, remain
there.
10. If a warning occurs at night when you are in the Library, a classroom, or other Uni
versity building, leave immediately, take your possessions with you, and walk to your
house or to other places specifically provided for occupancy during black-outs. On
account of limitation of space for study we regret that all women's living groups will
be closed to guests during black-out periods.
11. If a warning occurs during the day when you are in the Library, a classroom, or Uni
versity building, remain there.
Check to see that all lights are out in your room when leaving it unattended. Since
rooms on the Quad can no longer be used as study rooms at night (too great danger of
lights being left on and also the necessity of conserving electricity) it is urged that all living
groups keep quiet hours strictly after eight o'clock so that students may study profitably in
their own rooms or in seminar rooms designed for this purpose.
The full co-operation of each resident is necessary in carrying out these regulations for
the protection of all as well as for the protection of property and for national defense.
We are living in serious and dangerous times. Non-compliance is not only subject to
severe penalties but it will necessitate a complete black-out of residences by pulling the
main light switches.
Outlines of procedure in case ol disaster are being carefully worked out ami will be is
sued by the Council at the first possible moment.
The instructions above, issued January 2. 1912, are effective until rescinded.
