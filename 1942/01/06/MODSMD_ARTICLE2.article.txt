# Defense Committee Picks Wardens, Installs Siren; Blackout Rules Tighten
## Night Studying on the Quad Is Now Forbidden as 26 Campus Districts For Blackout Patrol Are Organized 
### 
Stanford University is now completely organized for air raid defense
with the campus divided into 2(5 civilian defense districts, each governed
by an air raid warden and his staff, according to Professor Edgar Eugeno
Robinson, co-chairman of the Stanford Civilian Defense Committee.
The Committee has issued new air raid warning instructions to stu-

dents (see bottom of page),
posted emergency regulations for |
the use of classrooms, libraries, of- I
fices and laboratories.
These regulations are:
1. Classrooms will not be avail
able for study purposes after (i p.m.
2. No access to laboratories will
be permitted after 6 p.m. except
by special permit.
3. All students who use libraries
after dark, or are permitted access \
to laboratories, and all members
of the faculty who use their offices
at night shall be required to ex- •
tinguish lights when they leave j
and to extinguish lights on a I
blackout signal unless approved
blackout equipment has been in- '
stalled.
The regulations were signed by
Frank F. Walker, co-chairman of the
Civilian Defense Committee.
AIR RAID WARDENS
These new regulations will be en
forced by the air raid warden and
his staff within each defense dis
trict. Working with each air raid
warden will be an alternate and a
district air raid committee. The war
den will be responsible for patrol
ling his district to make sure the
blackout is complete.
The air raid wardens met with J
members of the Civilian Defense |
Committee in the Women's Club- j
house last night and discussed plans
for perfecting blackouts. Another
meeting is scheduled for Wednesday
night.
NEW SIREN
During the holidays a new warn
ing siren has been installed on top
of the Hoover War Library. The
new siren is powered by an electric
motor, and can easily be heard
throughout the entire campus.
The new air raid warning will be
a fluctuating blast on the siren for
approximately two minutes. And the
all clear will be a two-minute steady
blast. In case of disaster, a series of
five blasts will be repeated for five
minutes. These signals supersede
the old signals of two blasts for a
blackout and four blasts for an all
clear.
CAMPUS NERVE CENTER
A 24-hour-per-day nerve center
for the campus has been established
in the Corporation Yard, with a di
rect wire from the Fourth Inter
ceptor Command's offices in San
Francisco.
Professor Robinson said that the
Stanford warning blast sounded
while radio station KPO was sign
ing off the air at the beginning of
last Saturday's blackout.
Last Saturday's blackout, which
began at 6:45 p.m. and lasted for
