# CPT Offers Ground Course
## 
### 
The Stanford Civilian Pilot Train
ing program for the winter and
spring quarters will be limited to
ground school courses, according to
Dr. David L. Webster, head of the
Stanford CPTP. At present, all
plans including ground school course
plans, are tentative, and are being
i changed from day to day, according
to instructions from the War Depart
ment.
The flight training part of the pro
gram was eliminated after the War
Department prohibited private flying
J within 200 miles of the coast.
GROUND-SCHOOL WOKK
The ground-school work which
may be given, totals eight units; five
units in winter and three in spring
quarter. Dr. Webster will direct the
ground course and will personally
give the 2-unit navigation course in
volving wind conditions, magnetic
| variation, and government charts.
Dr. Webster spent last spring quar
ter in Washington, D.C., working on
the CPT Manual and the Flight In
structors Manual.
Changes in the second edition of
the CPT Manual consisted primarily
in the addition of further explana
tions of some maneuvers without
changing the maneuvers themselves.
Dr. Webster, who has 1000 flying
hours to his credit, flew to Wash
ington in his 65-horsepower Piper
Cub. During the last war he was
stationed at Langley Field where he
worked on airplanes.
AIRCRAFT COURSES
The Aircraft operations course, 2
units, will also be given by Dr. Web
ster. It will include the theory of
flight and all maneuvers and the de
tails of plane structure.
Dr. Seville Chapman. Ph.D. from
California, will teach the 2-unit class
in meteorology, and the Civil Air
Regulations course, 2 units, will be
given by Miss Isabell M. Steiner.
John Martin, head of the mainte
nance of the Palo Alto airport, will
offer the course in general service of
the aircraft.
Students interested in enrolling in
the course should keep in contact
with Miss Steiner, whose office is
located in the Physics Building, for
changes as they are made by the
War Department. Only men are eli
gible to take the instruction. Al
though all the courses are under the
same program, each course is graded
separately. Men who successfully
complete both the ground course and
the flight training receive a private
pilot's license. Advance courses may
be taken after the student has com
pleted the present courses.

units in winter and three in spring
quarter. Dr. Webster will direct the
ground course and will personally
give the 2-unit navigation course in
volving wind conditions, magnetic
| variation, and government charts.
Dr. Webster spent last spring quar
ter in Washington, D.C., working on
the CPT Manual and the Flight In
structors Manual.
Changes in the second edition of
the CPT Manual consisted primarily
in the addition of further explana
tions of some maneuvers without
changing the maneuvers themselves.
Dr. Webster, who has 1000 flying
hours to his credit, flew to Wash
ington in his 65-horsepower Piper
Cub. During the last war he was
stationed at Langley Field where he
worked on airplanes.
AIRCRAFT COURSES
The Aircraft operations course, 2
units, will also be given by Dr. Web
ster. It will include the theory of
flight and all maneuvers and the de
tails of plane structure.
Dr. Seville Chapman. Ph.D. from
California, will teach the 2-unit class
in meteorology, and the Civil Air
Regulations course, 2 units, will be
given by Miss Isabell M. Steiner.
John Martin, head of the mainte
nance of the Palo Alto airport, will
offer the course in general service of
the aircraft.
Students interested in enrolling in
the course should keep in contact
with Miss Steiner, whose office is
located in the Physics Building, for
changes as they are made by the
War Department. Only men are eli
gible to take the instruction. Al
though all the courses are under the
same program, each course is graded
separately. Men who successfully
complete both the ground course and
the flight training receive a private
pilot's license. Advance courses may
be taken after the student has com
pleted the present courses.
The Stanford Civilian Pilot Train
ing program for the winter and
spring quarters will be limited to
ground school courses, according to
Dr. David L. Webster, head of the
Stanford CPTP. At present, all
plans including ground school course
plans, are tentative, and are being
i changed from day to day, according
to instructions from the War Depart
ment.
The flight training part of the pro
gram was eliminated after the War
Department prohibited private flying
J within 200 miles of the coast.
GROUND-SCHOOL WOKK
The ground-school work which
may be given, totals eight units; five
units in winter and three in spring
quarter. Dr. Webster will direct the
ground course and will personally
