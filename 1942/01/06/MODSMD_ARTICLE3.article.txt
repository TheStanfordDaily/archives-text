# Wartime Social Rules Restrict Farm Activities
## Excom Will Consider Regulations Advised By Student Leaders 
### 
How the Stanford man and woman
will alter their social and academic
lives for the duration of the war
was provisionally decided by a group
of 27 student leaders who met last
Friday and concurred on recommen
dations to Executive Committee,
which will consider them tonight.
Recommendations are based on
need for increased attention to aca
demic life, prevention of minor ill-

nesses which result from fatigue,
and provisions for safety in event of
blackouts or disaster. They follow.
1. While women's late leaves
should not be restricted at pres
ent, women will sign out after
dinner when going off campus,
stating where and with whom they
are going. This was decided upon
because of University responsi
bility to parents not only during
blackouts but in event of dis
aster.
2. Restriction on expense of
dances; do away with off-campus
dances and big name bands on
campus. A central committee
should be appointed for such so
cial responsibilities as blacking
out campus dances.
3. No mid-week function to last
later than 8 p.m., except by spe
cial permission from Ex Commit-
