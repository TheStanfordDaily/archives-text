# Wartime Social Rules Restrict Farm Activities
## Excom Will Consider Regulations Advised By Student Leaders 
### 
How the Stanford man and woman
will alter their social and academic
lives for the duration of the war
was provisionally decided by a group
of 27 student leaders who met last
Friday and concurred on recommen
dations to Executive Committee,
which will consider them tonight.
Recommendations are based on
need for increased attention to aca
demic life, prevention of minor ill-

nesses which result from fatigue,
and provisions for safety in event of
blackouts or disaster. They follow.
1. While women's late leaves
should not be restricted at pres
ent, women will sign out after
dinner when going off campus,
stating where and with whom they
are going. This was decided upon
because of University responsi
bility to parents not only during
blackouts but in event of dis
aster.
2. Restriction on expense of
dances; do away with off-campus
dances and big name bands on
campus. A central committee
should be appointed for such so
cial responsibilities as blacking
out campus dances.
3. No mid-week function to last
later than 8 p.m., except by spe
cial permission from Ex Commit-
tee, as per present arrangement. I
4. Encourage co-operation with
provisional new (J - day -a - week
curriculum by (aking IS units or
more in order to graduate sooner.
5. Women will make arrange
ments for staying in the City in
case of blackouts when there. Cal
women used to stay at the Stew
art Hotel when they missed the j
last ferry across the bay.
BLACKOUT REGULATIONS
Dean of Women Mary Yost slated '
it will necessary to close women's j
living groups to men during black
outs, and said, "It isn't that we
are inhospitable or unsociable —
sometimes 1 think we're too hos
pitable and sociable."
Also in attendance from the Ad
ministration were Frank F. Walker,
financial vice-president, who out
lined work of the Stanford Civilian
Defense Council, stating that senior
air raid wardens will be chosen for
the 2(5 Stanford civilian defense
I areas; Dean of Men John Bunn and
Mr. Dave Jacobson, Stanford Asso
ciates.

to the student leaders, "Open your
eyes to the novelties of our campus,
such as picnic hikes."
While the leaders discussed the
problem of sign-outs for women.
Sylvia Berry, president of Roble,
said students "shouldn't be here if
they can't be trusted." Dean Yost
pointed out in reply that families of
] those women from the East and Mid
! West "feel we are dabbling our feet
j in the Pacific."
JUNIOR CLASS WEEK-END
Don Dillon, junior president, out
lined plans for an extensive on
cjtmpus "junior class week-end,"
with a de-emphasis on the customary
| big name band at the Junior Prom.
Mr. Walker voiced the opinion
that the University "can and will j
be the safest spot in Northern Cali- j
fornia if each one of us does his
job." He outlined activities of the
Defense Council and Changes in
University curriculum, mentioning
first-aid courses and secretarial
training.

JUNIOR CLASS WEEK-END
Don Dillon, junior president, out
lined plans for an extensive on
cjtmpus "junior class week-end,"
with a de-emphasis on the customary
| big name band at the Junior Prom.
Mr. Walker voiced the opinion
that the University "can and will j
be the safest spot in Northern Cali- j
fornia if each one of us does his
job." He outlined activities of the
Defense Council and Changes in
University curriculum, mentioning
first-aid courses and secretarial
training.
How the Stanford man and woman
will alter their social and academic
lives for the duration of the war
was provisionally decided by a group
of 27 student leaders who met last
Friday and concurred on recommen
dations to Executive Committee,
which will consider them tonight.
Recommendations are based on
need for increased attention to aca
demic life, prevention of minor ill-

nesses which result from fatigue,
and provisions for safety in event of
blackouts or disaster. They follow.
1. While women's late leaves
should not be restricted at pres
ent, women will sign out after
dinner when going off campus,
stating where and with whom they
are going. This was decided upon
because of University responsi
bility to parents not only during
blackouts but in event of dis
aster.
2. Restriction on expense of
dances; do away with off-campus
dances and big name bands on
campus. A central committee
should be appointed for such so
cial responsibilities as blacking
out campus dances.
3. No mid-week function to last
later than 8 p.m., except by spe
cial permission from Ex Commit-
tee, as per present arrangement. I
4. Encourage co-operation with
provisional new (J - day -a - week
curriculum by (aking IS units or
more in order to graduate sooner.
5. Women will make arrange
ments for staying in the City in
case of blackouts when there. Cal
women used to stay at the Stew
art Hotel when they missed the j
last ferry across the bay.

it will necessary to close women's j
living groups to men during black
