Unlike the situation a year ago,
we cannot come back to our type
writer with wonderful things to
write about the Big Game and Stan
lord in the Rose Bowl. Simply be
cause it's rather hard to find any
thing very wonderful about the Big
Game from a Stanford point of view
and because it was Oregon State
and not Stanford in the Bowl this
year.

However, the boys from Corvallis
did themselves and the Pacific Coast
Conference right proud by whip
ping the number two team in the
nation, Duke, on New Year's Day
in Durham, N.C. Just like most of
the other grid enthusiasts in the
country, we didn't give the Beavers
a ghost of a chance, before the sea
son gut underway, to cop the con
ference title. Then, when they did,
it didn't seem possible that they
could knock over the Dukes. Their
efforts certainly did a great deal
toward erasing the mud splattered
on Coast football during the regular
season because of our poor showing
in intersectional clashes.

Last Saturday two Stanford grid
dors were in action in the annual
East-West Shrine game, transplant
ed in New Orleans, the home of the
Sugar Bowl, when army authorities
deemed it advisable to remove the
90 ntest from the vulnerable Pacific
Coast. They were Frankie Albert,
lhe Ail-American quarterback, 'and
Vic Lindskog, the center. Although
the Indian field general did not get
much of an opportunity to show his
full bag of tricks, since he was play
ing third team tailback behind Bill
Sewell of VV.S.C. and Jack Jacobs
of Oklahoma, he did turn in a bril
liant punt return, packing the ball
some 42 yards and into East ter
ritory.

Lindskog, some of the report from
New Orleans said, was one of the
best linemen on the field for the
West. From the radio report of the
game it was obvious that the big
Card center was making a large
percentage of the tackles from his
line-backing position.

]^ T OW THAT we've put the grid
game in mothballs for a while,
we can get down to the basketball
situation, which presents a bright
picture at this time.

It appears that Everett Dean has
the makings of another great club,
and already the San Francisco boys
are favoring the Indians to sweep
the southern division in a repeat
performance of last year's show, in
which Davidson, William & Co. cop
ped the loop crown.
It's rather early to pick the boys
to do that again, but the Reds do
appear to be ready to turn in a
good season.

good season.
'n such on the sports front.
Unlike the situation a year ago,
we cannot come back to our type
writer with wonderful things to
write about the Big Game and Stan
lord in the Rose Bowl. Simply be
cause it's rather hard to find any
thing very wonderful about the Big
Game from a Stanford point of view
and because it was Oregon State
and not Stanford in the Bowl this
year.

However, the boys from Corvallis
did themselves and the Pacific Coast
Conference right proud by whip
ping the number two team in the
nation, Duke, on New Year's Day
in Durham, N.C. Just like most of
the other grid enthusiasts in the
country, we didn't give the Beavers
a ghost of a chance, before the sea
son gut underway, to cop the con
ference title. Then, when they did,
it didn't seem possible that they
could knock over the Dukes. Their
efforts certainly did a great deal
toward erasing the mud splattered
on Coast football during the regular
season because of our poor showing
in intersectional clashes.

Last Saturday two Stanford grid
dors were in action in the annual
East-West Shrine game, transplant
ed in New Orleans, the home of the
Sugar Bowl, when army authorities
deemed it advisable to remove the
90 ntest from the vulnerable Pacific
Coast. They were Frankie Albert,
lhe Ail-American quarterback, 'and
Vic Lindskog, the center. Although
the Indian field general did not get
much of an opportunity to show his
full bag of tricks, since he was play
ing third team tailback behind Bill
Sewell of VV.S.C. and Jack Jacobs
of Oklahoma, he did turn in a bril
liant punt return, packing the ball
some 42 yards and into East ter
ritory.

Lindskog, some of the report from
New Orleans said, was one of the
best linemen on the field for the
West. From the radio report of the
game it was obvious that the big
Card center was making a large
percentage of the tackles from his
line-backing position.

]^ T OW THAT we've put the grid
game in mothballs for a while,
we can get down to the basketball
situation, which presents a bright
picture at this time.

It appears that Everett Dean has
the makings of another great club,
and already the San Francisco boys
are favoring the Indians to sweep
the southern division in a repeat
performance of last year's show, in
which Davidson, William & Co. cop
ped the loop crown.
It's rather early to pick the boys
to do that again, but the Reds do
appear to be ready to turn in a
good season.
