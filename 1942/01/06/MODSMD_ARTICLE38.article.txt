# Cagers Conquer Six Foes During Winter Vacation; Lose Only to Broncos
## 
### 
Stanford, southern division basketball winner last year, dumped six out
of seven opponents in a whirlwind practice season during winter vaca
tion, and is now favored by many Hay area sports scribes to cop its
second straight championship.
To make matters even rosier, Jim Pollard is now eligible, and his addi-

tion to the squad should give the
rest of the league coaches a very
long headache.
Pollard, you may remember, was
the outstanding player on Beeb Lee's
frosh, and is probably one of the
best hoop prospects ever to turn up
at Leland Junior. With Pollard in
the line-up, Coach Everett Dean's
cagers will average 6-4 in height.
THREE HUNDRED POINTS
Amassing 311 points to their op
ponents' 226, the Indians trounced
the Olympic Club, 36-25; U.S.F., 43-
35, 41-31; Ohio State, 60-45; Ari
zona, 56-26, 54-33, losing only to
Santa Clara, 21-31.
The '42 hoop season promises to
be a good old see-saw affair. Figure
this one out.
Ucla, after dropping five out of
seven games on its barnstorming
eastern tour, bounces back and
bridles the Bronc, 67-52, setting a
new Bruin scoring record. The
Uclans didn't figure to do that off
the form, but neither did Oregon
State, so here's to a wild and woolly
one in basketball.
BURNESS HIGH MAN
Don Burness tops the up-to-date
scoring (unofficial tabulation) with
73 points. Ed Voss is next with 60,
Howard Dallmar follows with 47, and
Bill Cowden has 46.
A short recap of the games:
Olympic 36-25 —Never press
ed after 10 minutes of slow-motion
antics, Stanford opened the season
with an easy win over the inexpe
rienced clubmen. Burness scored 8,
and Dallmar, playing his first col
legiate game, had 7.
U.S.F.. 43-35, 41-31—Both victo
ries came in the "never pressed"
fashion. Burness topped scoring
wilh 16 in the first game, and Voss
tallied 19 in the second.
Santa Clara. 21-31—Stanford was
defeated in a very slow game, mark
ed by complete Indian lethargy, and
almost completely stopped by Bronco
stalling tactics in the final 10 min
utes. Santa Clara led 21-13 at the
half.
Ohio State, (>O-45—Leading 28-17
at the half, the Redskins stepped up
the pace in the second half to win by
a wide margin. The Buckeyes came
within 3 points once at 27-30, but
that was taken care of as Voss hit
the bucket for 19. Burness for 14.
Arizona. 54-33 : —The Indians
walked off with a pair of easy victo
ries in Phoenix. Burness and Cow
den lived up to all advance notices,
and every man on the traveling
squad got into the game.
Friday night the varsity cagers
tangle with College of the Pacific in
the Pavilion, and Saturday travel to
San Francisco to take on St. Mary's.

Arizona. 54-33 : —The Indians
walked off with a pair of easy victo
ries in Phoenix. Burness and Cow
den lived up to all advance notices,
and every man on the traveling
squad got into the game.

SEATTLE, Jan. 5 (UP).—AI Hos
tak. former world middleweight
boxing champion, was notified to
day to report for active army duty.
Stanford, southern division basketball winner last year, dumped six out
of seven opponents in a whirlwind practice season during winter vaca
tion, and is now favored by many Hay area sports scribes to cop its
second straight championship.
To make matters even rosier, Jim Pollard is now eligible, and his addi-

tion to the squad should give the
rest of the league coaches a very
long headache.
Pollard, you may remember, was
the outstanding player on Beeb Lee's
frosh, and is probably one of the
best hoop prospects ever to turn up
at Leland Junior. With Pollard in
the line-up, Coach Everett Dean's
cagers will average 6-4 in height.
THREE HUNDRED POINTS
Amassing 311 points to their op
ponents' 226, the Indians trounced
the Olympic Club, 36-25; U.S.F., 43-
35, 41-31; Ohio State, 60-45; Ari
zona, 56-26, 54-33, losing only to
Santa Clara, 21-31.
The '42 hoop season promises to
be a good old see-saw affair. Figure
this one out.
Ucla, after dropping five out of
seven games on its barnstorming
eastern tour, bounces back and
bridles the Bronc, 67-52, setting a
new Bruin scoring record. The
Uclans didn't figure to do that off
the form, but neither did Oregon
State, so here's to a wild and woolly
one in basketball.
BURNESS HIGH MAN
Don Burness tops the up-to-date
scoring (unofficial tabulation) with
73 points. Ed Voss is next with 60,
Howard Dallmar follows with 47, and
Bill Cowden has 46.
A short recap of the games:
Olympic 36-25 —Never press
ed after 10 minutes of slow-motion
antics, Stanford opened the season
with an easy win over the inexpe
rienced clubmen. Burness scored 8,
and Dallmar, playing his first col
legiate game, had 7.
U.S.F.. 43-35, 41-31—Both victo
ries came in the "never pressed"
fashion. Burness topped scoring
wilh 16 in the first game, and Voss
tallied 19 in the second.
Santa Clara. 21-31—Stanford was
defeated in a very slow game, mark
ed by complete Indian lethargy, and
almost completely stopped by Bronco
stalling tactics in the final 10 min
utes. Santa Clara led 21-13 at the
half.
Ohio State, (>O-45—Leading 28-17
at the half, the Redskins stepped up
the pace in the second half to win by
a wide margin. The Buckeyes came
within 3 points once at 27-30, but
that was taken care of as Voss hit
the bucket for 19. Burness for 14.
