### 
Stanford 1942 freshman hoop
quintet is gunning for Piedmont High
in their opening tilt Friday night |
and behind the trigger is 190 pounds
and 6 feet of new basketball coach, 1
Woodrow "Woodie" Weir, termed by !
Stanford's varsity mentor, Everett j
Dean, as one of the best tossers he
has ever coached.
Replacing Bob Burnett, who takes j
over as head coach at Utah State, I
Weir comes to Stanford from In- !
diana, where since graduation from
the University of Indiana in 1934 he
has been an outstanding high school
mentor.
PLAYED FOR DEAN
Weir played on Dean's Indiana
teams in 1932, '33, and '34. and was
twice placed on the All Big-Ten
conference team at guard. Also for
his hoop work in the Hoosier state,
Weir received the Balfour award for
the outstanding college casaba man
in Indiana two years straight, as well
as honorable mention on All-Amer
ican listings for 1934.
At Indiana Weir played guard and
center, acquiring at both posts the
all-around view of the hoop sport
which contributed to his success as
high school director of various In
diana schools for 7 years. While at
Stanford, Weir will combine his
frosh coaching with graduate work
toward a master's degree in educa
tion,
MATERIAL A MYSTERY
Just what Weir has found to work
with is still unknown. In co-opera
tion with assistant varsity coach
Phil Bengtson, "Woodie" ran
through a partial workout yesterday
with more today as his squad finally
collects after vacation.
Featuring high school hoopsters
Jack Heald. Dave Brown, Fred Par
| sons, Bob Hall, Dave Porter — all
! conditioned on Harry Shipkey's
Papoose grid squad—Bill Spragins,
I Fred Ferroggiaro, Bob Barsocehini,
Bob Vayssie, Chuck Fultz, and oth
ers, the present yearling squad has
a record of 16 wins and 2 losses hung
up by the last year's team to shoot
at.
PIEDMONT TOUGH
Piedmont, sparked by center Hig
gins, is always tough, especially in
openers, and an interesting prelimi
nary to the C.O.P. tilt is in the off
ing. Last year the Piedmonters fell
in a 34 to 28 scoring spree to a
Farm beginning team that had a Jim
Pollard, which this one doesn't.
What that loss means will be dis
covered Friday.
Reports from Utah State reveal
that Burnett, former frosh coach and
intramural football director, is al
ready building up an impressive
record, his teams winning 3 out of
4 on a recent road jaunt.
