coach Jim Wylie will run Stanford's
rugby team through their first drill
next Monday. With such returning
veterans from the '41 football squad

I Cole, Mannon, et al, this year's squad
shows promise of being one of the
i best.

announces that this season's sched
ule of games is only tentatively
planned because of the war, but
; games with U.S.F., Petaluma Ath
letic Club, Olympic Club, and Cali

The news that games can be sched
uled with the Britishers from the
: warships undergoing repair in San
! Francisco will mean that the Stan

training in Southern California at
| Lancaster have been invited to meet
the Stanfords in some early season
; games.
