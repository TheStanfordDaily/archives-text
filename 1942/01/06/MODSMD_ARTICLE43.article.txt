# Overtones
## 
### 
THOSE somber, sobering overtones we spoke
of in September have hit the Farm; they have
hit Stanford and the rest of the country.
Stanford is now a part of a nation at war
against those who would abolish the type of
civilization we are now fighting to preserve.
Though the war, in the form of preying Japa
nese submarines, has come close to our Pa
cific shores, it is our duty, here at Stanford,
to keep our college life and activities going
along on a normal plane, at the same time pre
paring ourselves for any form of attack or dis
aster.
Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor that fateful
Sunday morning of Dec. 7 dealt the final blow
to Stanford's tottering but tenacious "ivory
tower" attitude toward the war, toward inter
vention, toward anything which did not directly
affect our little orbit of college life.
War is making changes in Stanford which
were unthinkable during last fall's mere "na
tional emergency"—an air raid siren screeches
from its perch atop the tower dedicated to world
peace, blacked-out windows and doors are omni
present, relatives, close friends, alumni, and
classmates are in the service .... or on the
casualty lists, almost all of Stanford's decreas
ing male population will soon be registered.
Our job in all this period of "war flux" is to
maintain a stable emotional balance, get as
much as we possibly can out of our university
education, and to live as normal a life as pos
sible under the changed circumstances.
However, that little phrase "as possible" is
probably going to mean several distinct changes
from what we have become used to in the past.
We won't be seeing many 1942 model automo
biles batting around the campus. Students
aren't going to get much sympathy from the
tire-rationing boards "because thef need the
car to get to class." And it won't be long before
gasoline joins the rationing lists. There won't
be any more $1,500 checks made out by the
A.S.S.U. for "big name bands" either. That big
off-campus dance your house was planning for
spring guarter is going to go by the boards, too.
Just as the British have been doing for the
past couple of years and just as the rest of the
United States will be doing for the next couple
of years, Stanford is going to be giving up a
lot of things formerly thought of as "necessary."
And Stanford is going to find that our 8,800
acres of campus offers a lot more than we have
been able to see in the past.

probably going to mean several distinct changes
from what we have become used to in the past.
We won't be seeing many 1942 model automo
biles batting around the campus. Students
aren't going to get much sympathy from the
tire-rationing boards "because thef need the
car to get to class." And it won't be long before
gasoline joins the rationing lists. There won't
be any more $1,500 checks made out by the
A.S.S.U. for "big name bands" either. That big
off-campus dance your house was planning for
spring guarter is going to go by the boards, too.
Just as the British have been doing for the
past couple of years and just as the rest of the
United States will be doing for the next couple
of years, Stanford is going to be giving up a
lot of things formerly thought of as "necessary."
And Stanford is going to find that our 8,800
acres of campus offers a lot more than we have
been able to see in the past.
THOSE somber, sobering overtones we spoke
of in September have hit the Farm; they have
hit Stanford and the rest of the country.
Stanford is now a part of a nation at war
against those who would abolish the type of
civilization we are now fighting to preserve.
Though the war, in the form of preying Japa
nese submarines, has come close to our Pa
cific shores, it is our duty, here at Stanford,
to keep our college life and activities going
along on a normal plane, at the same time pre
paring ourselves for any form of attack or dis
aster.
Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor that fateful
Sunday morning of Dec. 7 dealt the final blow
to Stanford's tottering but tenacious "ivory
tower" attitude toward the war, toward inter
vention, toward anything which did not directly
affect our little orbit of college life.
War is making changes in Stanford which
were unthinkable during last fall's mere "na
tional emergency"—an air raid siren screeches
from its perch atop the tower dedicated to world
peace, blacked-out windows and doors are omni
present, relatives, close friends, alumni, and
classmates are in the service .... or on the
casualty lists, almost all of Stanford's decreas
ing male population will soon be registered.
Our job in all this period of "war flux" is to
maintain a stable emotional balance, get as
much as we possibly can out of our university
education, and to live as normal a life as pos
sible under the changed circumstances.
However, that little phrase "as possible" is
probably going to mean several distinct changes
from what we have become used to in the past.
