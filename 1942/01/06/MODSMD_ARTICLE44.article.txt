STANFORD has a pretty well-established rep
utation for making new students feel at
home during their first few days on the Farm.
The ever-widening fall Pre-Reg program is evi
dence of this.
But in winter quarter, 100, many new students
arrive at Stanford and have to take their places
beside those of us who are already very famil
iar with the scheme of things around here.
And they are not being forgotten.
Just because there's a war going on and Stan
ford is forging ahead on its Civilian Defense
program there is no reason to believe that these
new winter quarter additions to the Stanford
Family are being forgotten. In fact, since the
war is going to make Stanford a more closely
knit community, there is all the more reason for
these new students to know each other, to know
something about their new home, and to know
the returning students with whom they will
have classes and engage in activities.
This afternoon at 4:30 all new students, sev
eral members of the administration, and stu
dent leaders will have an informal get-together
in the Nitery.
New students should not miss this stream
lined edition of the more extensive fall quarter
orientation programs.
