# Peaceâ€”Now's the Time
## 
### 
THE United States and 25 other nations and
governments-in-exile are now pledged offi
cially to final and complete defeat of the Axis
powers.
Everyono in this country is goinq to havo fo

help in one way or another to win this war.
The winning of the war should be uppermost
in everyone's mind.

But in doing everything possible to aid in
winning the war, we should not for a moment
lose sight of the fact that this world is going
to be in rather a bad state of affairs when the
final shot is fired.

Then it will be too late to start thinking about
devising some plan to patch up a battered
world civilization .... then, when propaganda
inspired hatreds rather than common sense can
not fail to play a great part in planning for world
peace.
Right now, in places like Stanford where
some measure of free thought and discussion is
still possible, right now is the time to start
thinking and working toward some feasible
plan of international reorganization. We should
not think merely in terms of "war aims" of each
individual member of the anti-Axis allies. A
peace based on petty nationalistic desires will
only lay the seeds for another war.
International democracy and collective se
curity must be the ultimate goal to be sought
by those men who sit around the peace table
at the end of this war. This solution won't be
achieved in their lifetimes, but they must lay
the foundations for it. This is going to take fore
sight and planning on a grand scale never be
fore seen in what we know as international
diplomacy.
To accomplish this result, we must not go on
waging a war for which we have no peace solu
tion. We must not leave the settlement to selfish
diplomats. We must not go into the peace
conference "blind."

We must know what we want and be able
to offer concrete plans for achieving such ends.
It is hardly possible to think we could do
this unless we lay the groundwork now, be
fore it is too late.

FOLLOWING last night's practice drill, Daily
men and Dailywomen will officially report
for duty at the Shack to learn how The Daily
has been reorganized on a war basis. They
will grope their way through blacked-out doors
and windows for staff meeting at 2, to hear war
time pearls of wisdom from the Commandant.
