lIAPPY NEW YEAR
IS now 1942. It is 1,942 years after the birth of
Christ. The world is the oldest it has ever been,
far older than it was a century ago, and older than it
was 5000 years ago. The world is very old and it is
round and it is turning, continually turning and con
tinually circling around the red sun. On the turning
world you can see mountains that are high places in
the world. Some of the mountains are very tall and
jagged and rough, and others are smaller and smoother.
Next to the mountains there are valleys, which are the
low places in the world. These are flat and here the
soil is rich and many types of plants grow in abun
dance. Running through the soil of the world are riv
ers that are made of water. The rivers lead to bays
and lakes and gulfs and seas and into oceans. The
oceans are the biggest of these bodies of water. And
scattered over this world, on the high places and on
the low places and even on the wet places, are people
who walk and talk. The people have worked hard
and have built themselves houses to liveUn, to protect
themselves from the cold and from the animals. They
have made clothes for themselves, which they wear to
cover the body. They have planted and harvested
food to supply the body with needed energy. For
many years these people have lived in the world, in
the high places, in the low places and even on the
wet places, working, eating, keeping warm and sleep
ing. And in this 1942, the people are still on the
world, doing the same things.

R ut as has happened before, there is a nervous activ
ity everywhere. The people are rushing about.
They are scared and are rushing about. They are
working harder than ever, they are sleeping less, they
are eating less, and they aren't keeping as warm as in
the past. There is some big trouble in the world that
is causing everyone to move and to move fast and with
a serious earnestness that comes whenever the world
is in trouble. They are building and making and fix
ing, but they aren't making anything to eat or any
thing to keep them warm. They are making some other
things, and they are rushing them and men from one
side of the world to the other. One group of the
people is hurting another group, which in turn is work
ing hard and trying to hurt the other group. But both
groups are being hurt, the people are being wasted,
the earth is being ruined, nothing is being gained and
everything is being lost and everyone is the loser and
everyone must suffer and everyone must cry. But the
world keeps continually turning and continually cir
cling around the sun, that always stays red and hot.
This is the way it is with the world at the start of
1942. It is a hard year to start, especially when you
have a cold.
