## "ENGLISH" CORNER—OUT 
### 
THHE EDITOR, SIR:
In spite of the name "History" in large letters
deeply incised in the sandstone of the building and .i
map under glass in the arcade showing the location
and name of the building in its relation to the rest of
the quad, the obvious inaccuracy of referring to the
northeast angle of the outer quad as the "English
Corner" persists. This error is rendered even more
egregious when it is recalled that the Department of
English was removed from this building in September
1988.
If there is any good reason why this should not be
"History Corner" I fail to perceive it.
Sincerely yours,
A. L. Trowbridge
