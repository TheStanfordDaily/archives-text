# Fine Acting Highlights Pulham Film
## 
### 
11. INI. PULIIAM, ESQ., now play
ing at the Fox-Stanford Theater in
Palo Alto.

Once in a great long while a good
book is transcribed for the screen
faithfully and well; this is the sort
of thing that warms the cockles of
the reviewer's heart. Such is "H. M.
Pulham, Esq." Taken from the novel
by J. P. Marquand, the film presents
a fine picture of Boston, and of a
man who cannot break away from
the hidebound traditionalism of his
brahmin background.

Robert Young, surprisingly enough,
turns in a distinguished perform
ance as Pulham, especially in the
later scenes that feature a Pulham
grown middle-aged and stuffy. But
the real surprise of the show is Hedy
Lamarr, who in spite of bad miscast
ing forsakes her langorous glamour
girl attitude to do a very good piece
of work as Marvin Myles. Ruth
Hussey gives her usual capable per
formance as Mrs. Pulham.

MGM, King Vidor, the director,
and everyone else who is responsible
for "H. M. Pulham, Esq.," are to be
congratulated for turning out a very
splendid picture.â€”Livingston
