Formal sorority rushing season
will swing into action next Thurs
day night according to an announce
ment released last night by Coun
cil in its first meeting of the quarter.
The invitations for the first period of
rushing, which consists of four din
ners, are to be picked up by the
rushees tomorrow at the Council of
j fice in the Women's Clubhouse, Pan
I Hell President Barbara Rapp an-
I nounced.
Several changes in the rushing
system were reported in the Pan
Hell meeting last night because of
the possibility of wartime blackouts.
No rushees are to be permitted to
remain in the sorority houses where
they are being entertained if an air
raid warning sounds, according to
Council. The rushees are to leave
immediately for their living groups
in an orderly fashion escorted by
two hashers from the sorority house.
flushing will consist of three pe
riods, four dinners in the first
rushing period, three dinners in the
| second period and two dinners in
; the third. In the first period which
begins Thursday rushees may go to
four houses but only once to a given
house, the Council warned.
Simplicity is being stressed
throughout the rushing season, 'Miss
! Rapp said, and each house has been
pledged to co-operate fully with (he
! administration in all matters con
|ceruing air raid precautions.
