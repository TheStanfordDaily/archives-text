### AMIE REICHERT 
J)RESIDENT Roosevelt yesterday
tossed a set of statistics at Con
gress that would make even an as
tronomer's head swim. When the
general dizziness had subsided, the
open-mouthed House and Senate
realized that they had just been pre
sented with the blueprints for vic
tory in World War II —and the bill.
Fifty-six billion dollars ($56,-
000,000,000) is 5G thousand million
dollars—a billion dollars is a thou
sand million—a million dollars is
a thousand thousand. . . . Any way
you look at it, that's an awful lot
of money.
An energetic amateur economist
on the radio last night was estimat
ing that that sum —which is over
half of the national income — will,
only theoretically, of course —call for
lour hundred and some odd dollars
from every man, woman, and child
in the country. (We are counting
on Mr. Rockefeller to take care of
our share.)

r I TRANSLATED into the tools of
war, I hat 56 billion will mean the
following by the end of this year:
00,000 planes, 45,000 tanks, 20,000
anti-aircraft guns, and 8 million tons
of shipping for the armed forces of
the U.S.
That is, provided we can hurdle
the two formidable production
problems which still bog the na
tion's industry: raw material short
ages, and Washington red tape.
Mr. Roosevelt's speech was a
lighting speech. It moved former
world's heavyweight champion
Jack Dempsey to enlist in the
Army, and it called forth whole
sale pledges from industrial and
labor leaders throughout the
country.
This is an ambitious undertaking
which the President has assigned the
men and women of the nation, but it
is a job that can and will be done,
according to the experts. Even
arch-conservative industrialist Hen
ry Ford declared that the mammoth
production Mr. Roosevelt called for
is "assured."

"X!EWS from the fighting areas of
the Pacific was scarce last night.
General Mac Arthur's valiant Amer
ican and Filipino forces were still
fighting doggedly, and, apparently
holding their own, against the in
vaders on Bataan peninsula.
Corregidor. Philippine naval
base, sustained successfully an
other aerial attack, and damaged
seven out of the 50 Japanese
bombers that made the assault.
That makes 15 bombers brought
down and 11 damaged since the
attacks on the naval base began
several days ago. Anti-aircraft
guns were responsible for this
success.
Off Mindanao Island, the War De
partment reports that our bombers
scored three damaging hits on a
Japanese battleship, sunk definitely
one destroyer, probably more. The
communique reported "extensive
damage" to the enemy formation
which included 36 ships.

r JPHE bad news is that the Japa
nese have intensified their drive
on the mighty British fortress of
Singapore and they are now within
easy bombing range of the naval
base. The invaders captured Kuan
tan, fortified town and air base on
the east coast of Malay, only 175
miles from Singapore.
The capture of the Kuantan Air
field will enable Japanese fighter
planes to accompany the bombers
as escorts, and will probably re
sult in heavy raids on Singapore
within the next day or so.
All attempts by the Japanese to
land yesterday along the west coast
of Malaya were repulsed with tre
mendous losses to the invader, ac
cording to the British, but further
efforts are to be expected very soon.
In China, Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-Shek's armies continued to
crash against Japanese forces in
Ilunan province where it is re
ported that 40,000 of the enemy
face annihilation.
There were rumors that China
would send troops to aid Singapore,
which now lies threatened in the
Japanese war path. Any aid which
Chiang might send could only come
through the back door—Thailand—
however, and it is doubtful how ef
fective it would be there.
