# 'KEYS TO THE CONFLICT'
## Duranty to Discuss War Here on Jan. 14 Newsman Predicted Red Win Over Nazis 
### 
Russia's role in the Far Eastern
war theater. British strategy in the 1
defense of Malaya and vital Singa
pore. The long-term results of a
complete Japanese victory in the
Philippines—if and when. Future '
Soviet foreign policy in the event of
an Allied victory.
These questions and many more
will be discussed by Walter Duranty,
famed war correspondent, when he
speaks to a Stanford audience next
Wednesday night at 8 o'clock in Me
morial Hall.
Rated by fellow newspapermen as
one of the greatest living foreign
correspondents, Duranty won his
reporting spurs as a World War I
correspondent for the New York
Times. From the early days of the
Soviets under Lenin, until he
was Moscow correspondent for the
New York Times, and since then has
been special correspondent for the |
Times and the North American !
Newspaper Alliance. Under this
system, he covered Europe and ;
Asia us hr» pleased following the

hottest news.
The newsman returned to this
country from Russia in the last
months of 1941, after covering the
German advance into the Balkans.
Stopping off in Japan, he wrote sev
eral articles on the struggle between
the war lords and the civilians in
Japan.
Though he won the Pulitzer Pri7e

in 1032, he did not gain his greatest
fame from the public at large until
his autobiography, "I Write as I
Please," became an international
best-seller. He is also the author of
"One Life, One Kopek," "Duranty
Reports Russia," "Curious Lottery,"
and "The Gold Train."
His new book tentatively titled
"Keys to the Conflict" will be pub
lished by Simon and Schuster soon.
When Hitler unleashed his pan
zers on the Soviet last June, Duranty
was alone among the experts in his
opinion that the Russians could stem
the Nazi tide.
Though he is recognized as the
best non-Russian authority on the
Russian political and social set-up,
he continued alone in his opinion
through the summer in his belief
that the Russians could stand.
In November when it became evi
dent that the Russians not only could
but would hold, the rest of the ex
perts climbed onto the Duranty
bandwagon.
Tickets for the lecture are priced
at 55 cents (tax included). They are
on at the A.S.SU office now
