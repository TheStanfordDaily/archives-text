## Reds Batter Nazi Legions On Four Fronts; British Victory in Libya Imminent 
### United Press 
Soviet offensives battered wavering German forces
on four sectors of the eastern front Tuesday, with
imminent disaster threatening large groups of discour
aged Nazis beset by the terrible Russian winter as well
as powerful Soviet armies (lushed with victory.

A spccial "victory" communique
announced by the Moscow radio
Tuesday night said the ever-growing
Russian offensive, in the five days
ending at midnight Monday, had
swept the Germans out of 572 towns
and villages and killed 10,000 Nazis.
In the desert wastes of Libya, Brit
ish imperial troops massed for
knockout blows against the besieged
garrisons of Solium and Halfaya and
the remnants of Axis armored forces
in western Cyrenaica, in the Age
da bia area.
Artillery and bombers bore the
brunt of the British offensive, how
ever, as heavy rains impeded ground
movement.
ON THE BATTLE FRONTS
These were the main develop
ments in the war across the Atlantic:
1. Powerful Russian offensives
against faltering German forces ill
equipped for bitter winter cold
steadily pushed the Nazis back on
the Leningrad, Moscow and Crimea
sectors and were developing a
threat to Kharkov, great German
held industrial and transportation
center in the Donets Basin.
2. Final and complete success for
the British campaign in Libya ap
peared in sight, although there were
unconfirmed reports that Axis forces
partially encircled in western Cyre
niaca may have received reinforce
ments from Tripolitania.
3. RAF bombers shuttling across
the English Channel made their
100 th attack of the war on German
held Brest, France, where two Nazi
battleships and a heavy cruiser have
been battered by British bombs time
and again.
4. In Europe generally, suffering
from bitter cold which aggravated
food and fuel shortages, tension and
unrest increased. Bad feeling grew
between Germany and unoccupied
France, with French collaboration
ists in Paris opening a new attack
on the United States and demanding
that Vichy give Nazi Germany full
co-operation.
MORE EUROPEAN UNREST
In Denmark King Christian was
reported resisting a Nazi demand for
anti-Semitic laws. In Rumania de
featism and anger against Germany
were rife, instigating a new Nazi
propaganda campaign. Reports from
Norway said the Geramns were
rushing in troops to guard against
further British Commando raids and
anti-Nazi outbreaks by the populace.
In Russia —most important Euro
pean front — the Soviet southern
army opened a major offensive de
signed to oust the Germans from
Kharkov. Heavy fighting was re
ported within 30 miles of the city
and Stockholm reports said there
were indications that Germans were
preparing to evacuate the stronghold
taken at great cost last year.
