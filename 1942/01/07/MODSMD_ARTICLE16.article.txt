DROP LESS THAN 1941
Registrar J. P. Mitchell points out
that the current decreased total,
less than last quarter by 128, is miti
gated by the fact that last year there
were 201 fewer students registered
in winter than in autumn quarter.
The largest drop between the .1941
figures and 1942 total was in men
students, whose absence due to the
war resulted in a hack of 364. There
are now 2.472 men, while in 1941
there were 2,836. There are three
more women now, with 1,276 as
compared with 1,273 in 1941.
172 SIGNED YESTERDAY
r One hundred seventy-two more
| students signed up in the Admin
istration Building in yesterday's sec
ond day of check writing, and the
prolonged registration was believed
due to late trains from the East.
Fee for late registration is $2 per
day, according to Dr. Mitchell.
