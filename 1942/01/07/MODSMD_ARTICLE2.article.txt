# Rushing Opens As Fraternities Welcome Frosh
## Row Puts Best Foot Forward for Their Prospective Pledges 
### 
With the 1942 rushing season offi- j
cially opened, 400 Encinamen invade
ihe Row again tonight from 7:30 to j
in the seeond night of fraternity
open house, initial event of the new
winter rushing program.
As in last night's visits, no cards >
will be sent out. All freshmen and
transfers are invited to attend any
house they wish the length and
breadth of the Row.
ROW CLEANS HOUSE
After frenziedly cleaning out all
the accumulated debris from vaca
tion, tossing their books in the cor
ner, putting out the welcome mat,
polishing the floors, and dusting off
the furniture yesterday afternoon,
busy Row men climbed into their
''smooth" clothes for any evening of
handshaking with prospective rush
ees visiting the Row for the first
time.
Just as all freshmen on their first
visit to the Row, the Class of '45 felt
rather uncertain at Erst, but after
shaking scores of hands, drinking
dozens of glasses of punch, and meet
ing scores of friendly people, they
felt very much at home and allowed
themselves to be very impressed by
the fast-talking rushers.
ICE BROKEN EASILY
Starting with home towns, high
schools, mutual friends, athletics and
other standard conversational leads,
Row men and Encinamen quickly
became old friends until they meet
on the Quad today and both "tie
up" on their greetings. As usual,
comparison with Encina was the
main fraternity talking point with
Encina naturally suffering by com
parison.
The sororities received their usual
quota of freshmen but they gra
ciously steered their blushing visi
tors to the Phi Delt house or the
Fiji house across the street. But
generally speaking, the open house
went off smoothly. Supposedly end
ing at 9:30, few houses were emptied
of freshman visitors before 10.
FROSH TALK IT OVER
With open house over, everyone
went back for "bull sessions" with
their fellows—the freshmen on fa
vorite fraternities, and Row men
planning big campaigns on prospec
tive "nuggets."
The second period — a regular
rushing period—will be held this
week-end with five times named
for freshman engagements. Cards
may still be purchased by rushing
chairmen in llhe A.S.Sj.U. office.
Freshmen are asked to fill out the
cards they receive and mail them
as soon as possible.
SECOND OPEN HOUSE
A second open house period—an
innovation this year—will be held
from 7 to 9:30 next Wednesday and
Thursday. As in the first period, no
cards will be sent out and freshmen
are free to visit any house they
wish.
The remainder of the rushing
schedule follows:
Jan. 23, 24—Regular rushing period
Jan. 30, 31—Regular rushing period

With open house over, everyone
went back for "bull sessions" with
their fellows—the freshmen on fa
vorite fraternities, and Row men
planning big campaigns on prospec
tive "nuggets."
The second period — a regular
rushing period—will be held this
week-end with five times named
for freshman engagements. Cards
may still be purchased by rushing
chairmen in llhe A.S.Sj.U. office.
Freshmen are asked to fill out the
cards they receive and mail them
as soon as possible.
SECOND OPEN HOUSE
A second open house period—an
innovation this year—will be held
from 7 to 9:30 next Wednesday and
Thursday. As in the first period, no
cards will be sent out and freshmen
are free to visit any house they
wish.
The remainder of the rushing
schedule follows:
Jan. 23, 24—Regular rushing period
Jan. 30, 31—Regular rushing period
Feb. 2, 3—Regular rushing period
Feb. s—Preference dinner
Feb. 6 —Pledging and Pledge Prom
With the 1942 rushing season offi- j
cially opened, 400 Encinamen invade
ihe Row again tonight from 7:30 to j
in the seeond night of fraternity
open house, initial event of the new
winter rushing program.
As in last night's visits, no cards >
will be sent out. All freshmen and
transfers are invited to attend any
house they wish the length and
breadth of the Row.
ROW CLEANS HOUSE
After frenziedly cleaning out all
the accumulated debris from vaca
tion, tossing their books in the cor
ner, putting out the welcome mat,
polishing the floors, and dusting off
the furniture yesterday afternoon,
busy Row men climbed into their
''smooth" clothes for any evening of
handshaking with prospective rush
ees visiting the Row for the first
time.
Just as all freshmen on their first
visit to the Row, the Class of '45 felt
rather uncertain at Erst, but after
shaking scores of hands, drinking
dozens of glasses of punch, and meet
ing scores of friendly people, they
felt very much at home and allowed
themselves to be very impressed by
the fast-talking rushers.
ICE BROKEN EASILY
Starting with home towns, high
schools, mutual friends, athletics and
other standard conversational leads,
Row men and Encinamen quickly
became old friends until they meet
on the Quad today and both "tie
up" on their greetings. As usual,
comparison with Encina was the
main fraternity talking point with
Encina naturally suffering by com
parison.
The sororities received their usual
quota of freshmen but they gra
ciously steered their blushing visi
tors to the Phi Delt house or the
Fiji house across the street. But
generally speaking, the open house
went off smoothly. Supposedly end
ing at 9:30, few houses were emptied
of freshman visitors before 10.
