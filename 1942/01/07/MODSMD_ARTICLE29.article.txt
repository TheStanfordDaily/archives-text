# Pacific Clipper Circles Globe To Evade War
## Unexpected Flight Lasts Five Weeks, Covers 31,500 Miles 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 6 (UP). —Pan
American Airway's clipper landed at
LaGuardia Field today after a .'51.500
mile flight around the "middle" of
the world to escape the Pacific war
zone.
The unscheduled "hop" started
Dec. 2 as the clipper's 73rd flighl
from San Francisco to Auckland.
New Zealand. It ended in the first
flight around the wonu at the Equa
tor when Capt. Robert Ford of Ber
keley, Cal., advised to bring the clip
per home over any route he thought
best, took the westward passage.
The entire trip—from San Fran
cisco to New York—took 36 days
with the clipper traveling half of the
way by night to avoid Japanese at
tacks, touching the continents of
Australia, Asia, Africa, and North
and South America, and crossing the
Equator six times.
When the 42 1 2-ton flying boat
came down at LaGuardia Field, it
was without any identifying marks
on its hull or wings. It had travelled
without the aid or any radio beams.
It made 18 stops under 12 different
flags, flew over most of the world's
major bodies of water and its long
est flight was 3,583 miles.
Capt. Ford and his bronzed crew
of ten described the trip as "routine
—we just flew by the book."
Some of the flight was made over
the same water through which
Magellan plowed on the first trip
around the world in 1519-22 which
took 1.083 days. It could not be
compared, however, to the record
established by Howard Hughes in
1938 when he flew the "northern
route" of 14,824 miles in three days,
19 hours.
The clipper landed at Auckland,
N.Z., Dec. 7, the day the Japanese
made their "sneak attack" on Ha
waii.
Then word crackled over the radio
to Capt. Ford to proceed to New

York by the most practical route. In
utmost secrecy, the boat left Auck
land on the morning of Dec. 16.
The trip was so secret that when
the plane arrived in New York only
a few authorities here knew it was
due.
Army and Navy intelligence offi
cers, it was learned, interviewed the
crew for more than two hours im
mediately after they landed.
The members of the crew were:
John Henry Mack, first officer,
Rexbury, Idaho; Roderick N. Brown,
second officer, Oakland, Cal.; James
G. Henriksen, third officer, San
Francisco; Homans K. Rothe, first
engineering officer, San Francisco;
John Delmer Steers, fourth officer,
Palo Alto, Cal.; John Bertrand Par
ish, second engineering officer,
Richmond, Va.; John D. Poindexter,
first radio officer, Alameda, Cal.

In 1923 Robert McLean ice-skated
50 yards in five seconds.

Stanford has a st;iff of 18 coaches
at the present.
