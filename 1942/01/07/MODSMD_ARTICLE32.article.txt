# F.D.R. Asks 56 Billion for War in '42
## President Pledges A.E.F. to Allies On World-Wide Front 
### 
WASIINtiTON 1 , Jan. <i (UP).—
President Roosevelt, pledging the
nation to the mightiest war effort
the world has ever seen, today set
the cost for the next year at $5(»,000,-
000,000 and promised grimly that the
war will he carried to the enemy
"wherever and whenever we can
reach him" until victory is won.
American forces, lie said, will be
on duty along the entire world front.,
including stations in the British
Isles "which constitute an essential
fortress in this world .struggle."
The war will end, he said grimly,
"just as soon as we make it end—by
our combined efforts, our combined
determination to fight through and
work through until the end—the end
of militarism in Germany and Italy
and Japan."
JOINT SESSION
Appearing in person before a joint
session of Congress to deliver his
annual state of the Union message,
he outlined an all-out war program
of blood—a breath-taking effort that
will cost more than half the antici
pated national income in the fiscal
year beginning July 1.
He disclosed—along with his plans
for a world-wide anti-Axis offensive
—that he had ordered a staggering
increase in the production of planes,
tanks, anti-aircraft guns and ships
during the next 24 months. He broke
the program down into four segments
as follows:
1. Build 60,000 airplanes, including
45,000 combat aircraft, in 1942 and
125,000, including 100,000 combat
units, in 1943. Production in 1941
totaled about 18,000.
2. Produce 45,000 tanks in 1!)42 and
75,000 in 1943.
3. Produce 20,000 anti-aircraft guns
in 1942; 35,000 in 1943.
4. Launch 8,000,000 deadweight
tons of merchant shipping in 1942;
10.000,000 tons in 1943. A total of
1,100,000 deadweight tons was
launched in 1941.
WARNS OF COST
"War costs money," he added. "So
far we have hardly even begun to
pay for it. This means taxes and
bonds and bonds and taxes. The
superiority of the united nations in
munitions and ships must be over
whelming—so overwhelming that the
Axis nations can never hope to catch
up with us."
The assembled legislators gasped
and applauded in turn as the Presi
dent unfolded his figures and plans—
figures which he hoped would "be
come common knowledge in Ger
many and Japan."
"These figures and similar figures
for a multitude of other implements
of war will give the Japanese and
Nazis a little idea of just what they
accomplished in the attack on Pearl
Harbor," he said.
"We must raise our sights all along
the production line. Let no man say
it cannot be done.
"It must be done—and we have
undertaken to do it."
OFFENSIVE ACTION
He promised that powerful atid
offensive action will be taken against
the Axis "in proper time"; that con
solidation of the war effort of the
20 nations united against the ag
gressors is being achieved.
"We cannot wage this war in a
defensive spirit," he said. "As our
power and our resources are fully
mobilized, we shall carry the attack
against the enemy—we shall hit him
and hit him again wherever and
whenever we can reach him.
"We must keep him far from our
shores, for we intend to bring this
battle to him on his own ground."
American armed forces, he said,
will be used in defensive and offen
sive operations along the entire world
front—in Britain, in the Far East
find on all oceans to guard essential
communications.
PROTECT HEMISPHERE
Likewise, he declared, our fighting
men will protect thks hemisphere
and bases outside it which could be
used for an attack on the Americas.
He warned that "suicide squad
rons" of Axis bombers may attempt
long-range raids in the hope of ter
rorizing the people and disrupting
their morale.
"Our people are not afraid of
that," he said. "We know that we
may have to pay ;i heavy price for
freedom. We will pay that price with
a will . . . No matter what our
enemies in their desperation may
attempt to do to us—we will say,
as the people of London have said,
'We can take it.'"
Then, with his jaw thrust out, he
added:
"And what's more, we can give it
back —and we will give it back—
with compound interest!"
REPORTS ON CONFERENCES
He said great strides had been
made in war council conferences in
Washington, Moscow and Chung
king to co-ordinate Allied military
and economic action for death thrusts
at the Axis.
The united nations will not fight
isolated Wat's —cVich nation going
his own way, he continued. They
are agreed not in spirit and deter
mination alone, but in the broad
conduct of the war in all its phases.
"For the first time since the Japa
nese and Fascists and the Nazis
Started along their blood-stained

course of conquest they now face
the fact that superior forces are as
sembling against them," he said.
"Gone forever are the days when
the aggressors could attack and de
stroy their victims one by one with
out unity of resistance. We of the
united nations will so dispose our
forces that we can strike at the com
mon enemy wherever the greatest
damage can be done."
He radiated confidence in an Al
lied victory.
He cautioned the people to guard
against complacency and defeatism
and not to underrate the "powerful
and cunning enemy."
The Axis will stop at nothing
which gives them the chance to "kill

and destroy," he declared.
It will be a long, bloody war, a
war in which this country must steel
itself to accept reversals, the Presi
dent went on.
"We already have tasted defeat.
We may suffer further setbacks. We
must face the fact of a hard war, a
long war, a bloody war, a costly
war."
He said the nation faces the need
of accomplishing an unprecedented
production task in a short time and
that everybody will be required to
make sacrifices to that end.
Workers will be required to spend
longer hours at their benches and
to produce more; greater quantities
of strategic and raw materials will

be diverted from civilian uses to war
products; higher taxes will be im
posed and luxuries and non-essen
tials must be cut—"only this all-out
scale of production will hasten the
ultimate all-out victory."
Guns from the American arsenal
ol democracy are to go not only to
the nations actually fighting the
Axis but to the peoples conquered
by Germany and Japan, Mr. Roose
velt revealed.
"As we get guns to the patriots in
tliose lands they too will fire shots
heard 'round the world," he said.
The objectives of the Allied powers
are clear, he continued.
They comprise "smashing the mili
tarism imposed by war lords upon

their enslaved peoples—the objective
of liberating subjugated nations—
the objective of establishing and se
curing freedom of speech, freedom
of religion, freedom from want and
freedom from fear everywhere in
the world."
He charged that Japan plotted for
half a century the subjugation of all
people in the Far East and in the
islands of the Pacific; the domination
of that ocean by the Japanese mili
tary and naval control of the west
ern coasts of North, Central and
South America.
Italy, he said, adopted a similar
policy of "criminal conquest." It
goal, he declared, was domination
of all North Africa, Egypt, parts of

France, and the entire Mediterra
nean world.
"But the* dreams of empire of the
Japanese and fascist leaders were
modest in comparison with the gar
gantuan aspirations ol Hitler and the
Nazis," he said.
Japan's sneak attack on Pearl
Harbor was intended to stun the
United States—to terrify the gov
ernment to such an extent that it
would divert its industrial and mili
tary strength to the Pacific area, or
even to our continental defense, he
said.
"The plan failed in its purpose,"
he declared, and the legislators
cheered. "We have not been stunned,
we have not been terrified or con

fused."
Proof of this, he observed, is the
assembling of the second session
of the Seventy-seventh Congress,
and the mood of "quiet, grim reso
lution which prevails bodes ill for
those who have conspired and col
laborated to murder world peace."
He said it was bitter not to be
able to relieve the heroic defenders
of Wake Island. It was bitter, too,
not to be able to send a thousand
ships and a million men to the de
fense of the Philippines.
"But this only adds to our deter
mination to see to it that the Stars
and Stripes will fly again over Wake
J and Guam; and that the brave peo
| pie of the Philippines will be rid

of Japanese imperialism, and will
live in freedom, security and inde
pendence," he pledged.

the Axis "in proper time"; that con
solidation of the war effort of the
20 nations united against the ag
gressors is being achieved.
"We cannot wage this war in a
defensive spirit," he said. "As our
power and our resources are fully
mobilized, we shall carry the attack
against the enemy—we shall hit him
and hit him again wherever and
whenever we can reach him.
"We must keep him far from our
shores, for we intend to bring this
battle to him on his own ground."
American armed forces, he said,
will be used in defensive and offen
sive operations along the entire world
front—in Britain, in the Far East
find on all oceans to guard essential
communications.
PROTECT HEMISPHERE
Likewise, he declared, our fighting
men will protect thks hemisphere
and bases outside it which could be
used for an attack on the Americas.
He warned that "suicide squad
rons" of Axis bombers may attempt
long-range raids in the hope of ter
rorizing the people and disrupting
their morale.
"Our people are not afraid of
that," he said. "We know that we
may have to pay ;i heavy price for
freedom. We will pay that price with
a will . . . No matter what our
enemies in their desperation may
attempt to do to us—we will say,
as the people of London have said,
'We can take it.'"
Then, with his jaw thrust out, he
added:
"And what's more, we can give it
back —and we will give it back—
with compound interest!"
REPORTS ON CONFERENCES
He said great strides had been
made in war council conferences in
Washington, Moscow and Chung
king to co-ordinate Allied military
and economic action for death thrusts
at the Axis.
The united nations will not fight
isolated Wat's —cVich nation going
his own way, he continued. They
are agreed not in spirit and deter
mination alone, but in the broad
conduct of the war in all its phases.
"For the first time since the Japa
nese and Fascists and the Nazis
Started along their blood-stained

course of conquest they now face
the fact that superior forces are as
sembling against them," he said.
"Gone forever are the days when
the aggressors could attack and de
stroy their victims one by one with
out unity of resistance. We of the
united nations will so dispose our
forces that we can strike at the com
mon enemy wherever the greatest
damage can be done."
He radiated confidence in an Al
lied victory.
He cautioned the people to guard
against complacency and defeatism
and not to underrate the "powerful
and cunning enemy."
The Axis will stop at nothing
which gives them the chance to "kill

and destroy," he declared.
It will be a long, bloody war, a
war in which this country must steel
itself to accept reversals, the Presi
dent went on.
"We already have tasted defeat.
We may suffer further setbacks. We
must face the fact of a hard war, a
long war, a bloody war, a costly
war."
He said the nation faces the need
of accomplishing an unprecedented
production task in a short time and
that everybody will be required to
make sacrifices to that end.
Workers will be required to spend
longer hours at their benches and
to produce more; greater quantities
of strategic and raw materials will

be diverted from civilian uses to war
products; higher taxes will be im
posed and luxuries and non-essen
tials must be cut—"only this all-out
scale of production will hasten the
ultimate all-out victory."
Guns from the American arsenal
ol democracy are to go not only to
the nations actually fighting the
Axis but to the peoples conquered
by Germany and Japan, Mr. Roose
velt revealed.
"As we get guns to the patriots in
tliose lands they too will fire shots
heard 'round the world," he said.
The objectives of the Allied powers
are clear, he continued.
They comprise "smashing the mili
tarism imposed by war lords upon

their enslaved peoples—the objective
of liberating subjugated nations—
the objective of establishing and se
curing freedom of speech, freedom
of religion, freedom from want and
freedom from fear everywhere in
the world."
He charged that Japan plotted for
half a century the subjugation of all
people in the Far East and in the
islands of the Pacific; the domination
of that ocean by the Japanese mili
tary and naval control of the west
ern coasts of North, Central and
South America.
Italy, he said, adopted a similar
policy of "criminal conquest." It
goal, he declared, was domination
of all North Africa, Egypt, parts of

France, and the entire Mediterra
nean world.
"But the* dreams of empire of the
Japanese and fascist leaders were
modest in comparison with the gar
gantuan aspirations ol Hitler and the
Nazis," he said.
Japan's sneak attack on Pearl
Harbor was intended to stun the
United States—to terrify the gov
ernment to such an extent that it
would divert its industrial and mili
tary strength to the Pacific area, or
even to our continental defense, he
said.
"The plan failed in its purpose,"
he declared, and the legislators
cheered. "We have not been stunned,
we have not been terrified or con

fused."
Proof of this, he observed, is the
assembling of the second session
of the Seventy-seventh Congress,
and the mood of "quiet, grim reso
lution which prevails bodes ill for
those who have conspired and col
laborated to murder world peace."
He said it was bitter not to be
able to relieve the heroic defenders
of Wake Island. It was bitter, too,
not to be able to send a thousand
ships and a million men to the de
fense of the Philippines.
"But this only adds to our deter
mination to see to it that the Stars
and Stripes will fly again over Wake
J and Guam; and that the brave peo
| pie of the Philippines will be rid

of Japanese imperialism, and will
live in freedom, security and inde
pendence," he pledged.
WASIINtiTON 1 , Jan. <i (UP).—
President Roosevelt, pledging the
nation to the mightiest war effort
the world has ever seen, today set
the cost for the next year at $5(»,000,-
000,000 and promised grimly that the
war will he carried to the enemy
"wherever and whenever we can
reach him" until victory is won.
American forces, lie said, will be
on duty along the entire world front.,
including stations in the British
Isles "which constitute an essential
fortress in this world .struggle."
The war will end, he said grimly,
"just as soon as we make it end—by
our combined efforts, our combined
determination to fight through and
work through until the end—the end
of militarism in Germany and Italy
and Japan."
JOINT SESSION
Appearing in person before a joint
session of Congress to deliver his
annual state of the Union message,
he outlined an all-out war program
of blood—a breath-taking effort that
will cost more than half the antici
pated national income in the fiscal
year beginning July 1.
He disclosed—along with his plans
for a world-wide anti-Axis offensive
—that he had ordered a staggering
increase in the production of planes,
tanks, anti-aircraft guns and ships
during the next 24 months. He broke
the program down into four segments
as follows:
1. Build 60,000 airplanes, including
45,000 combat aircraft, in 1942 and
125,000, including 100,000 combat
units, in 1943. Production in 1941
totaled about 18,000.
2. Produce 45,000 tanks in 1!)42 and
75,000 in 1943.
3. Produce 20,000 anti-aircraft guns
in 1942; 35,000 in 1943.
4. Launch 8,000,000 deadweight
tons of merchant shipping in 1942;
10.000,000 tons in 1943. A total of
1,100,000 deadweight tons was
launched in 1941.
WARNS OF COST
"War costs money," he added. "So
far we have hardly even begun to
pay for it. This means taxes and
bonds and bonds and taxes. The
superiority of the united nations in
munitions and ships must be over
whelming—so overwhelming that the
Axis nations can never hope to catch
up with us."
The assembled legislators gasped
and applauded in turn as the Presi
dent unfolded his figures and plans—
figures which he hoped would "be
come common knowledge in Ger
many and Japan."
"These figures and similar figures
for a multitude of other implements
of war will give the Japanese and
Nazis a little idea of just what they
accomplished in the attack on Pearl
Harbor," he said.
"We must raise our sights all along
the production line. Let no man say
it cannot be done.
"It must be done—and we have
undertaken to do it."
OFFENSIVE ACTION
He promised that powerful atid
offensive action will be taken against
the Axis "in proper time"; that con

20 nations united against the ag

tials must be cut—"only this all-out
scale of production will hasten the
ultimate all-out victory."
Guns from the American arsenal
ol democracy are to go not only to
the nations actually fighting the
Axis but to the peoples conquered
by Germany and Japan, Mr. Roose
velt revealed.
"As we get guns to the patriots in
tliose lands they too will fire shots
heard 'round the world," he said.
The objectives of the Allied powers
are clear, he continued.
They comprise "smashing the mili
tarism imposed by war lords upon

their enslaved peoples—the objective
of liberating subjugated nations—
the objective of establishing and se
curing freedom of speech, freedom
of religion, freedom from want and
freedom from fear everywhere in
the world."
He charged that Japan plotted for
half a century the subjugation of all
people in the Far East and in the
islands of the Pacific; the domination
of that ocean by the Japanese mili
tary and naval control of the west
ern coasts of North, Central and
South America.
Italy, he said, adopted a similar
policy of "criminal conquest." It
goal, he declared, was domination
of all North Africa, Egypt, parts of

France, and the entire Mediterra
nean world.
"But the* dreams of empire of the
Japanese and fascist leaders were
modest in comparison with the gar
gantuan aspirations ol Hitler and the
Nazis," he said.
Japan's sneak attack on Pearl
Harbor was intended to stun the
United States—to terrify the gov
ernment to such an extent that it
would divert its industrial and mili
tary strength to the Pacific area, or
even to our continental defense, he
said.
"The plan failed in its purpose,"
he declared, and the legislators
cheered. "We have not been stunned,
we have not been terrified or con

fused."
Proof of this, he observed, is the
assembling of the second session
of the Seventy-seventh Congress,
and the mood of "quiet, grim reso
lution which prevails bodes ill for
those who have conspired and col
laborated to murder world peace."
He said it was bitter not to be
able to relieve the heroic defenders
of Wake Island. It was bitter, too,
not to be able to send a thousand
ships and a million men to the de
fense of the Philippines.
"But this only adds to our deter
mination to see to it that the Stars
and Stripes will fly again over Wake
J and Guam; and that the brave peo
| pie of the Philippines will be rid

of Japanese imperialism, and will
live in freedom, security and inde
pendence," he pledged.
WASIINtiTON 1 , Jan. <i (UP).—
President Roosevelt, pledging the
nation to the mightiest war effort
the world has ever seen, today set
the cost for the next year at $5(»,000,-
000,000 and promised grimly that the
war will he carried to the enemy
"wherever and whenever we can
reach him" until victory is won.
American forces, lie said, will be
on duty along the entire world front.,
including stations in the British
Isles "which constitute an essential
fortress in this world .struggle."
The war will end, he said grimly,
"just as soon as we make it end—by
our combined efforts, our combined
determination to fight through and
work through until the end—the end
of militarism in Germany and Italy
and Japan."
JOINT SESSION
Appearing in person before a joint
session of Congress to deliver his
annual state of the Union message,
he outlined an all-out war program
of blood—a breath-taking effort that
will cost more than half the antici
pated national income in the fiscal
year beginning July 1.
He disclosed—along with his plans
for a world-wide anti-Axis offensive
—that he had ordered a staggering
increase in the production of planes,
tanks, anti-aircraft guns and ships
during the next 24 months. He broke
the program down into four segments
as follows:
1. Build 60,000 airplanes, including
45,000 combat aircraft, in 1942 and
125,000, including 100,000 combat
units, in 1943. Production in 1941
totaled about 18,000.
2. Produce 45,000 tanks in 1!)42 and
75,000 in 1943.
3. Produce 20,000 anti-aircraft guns
in 1942; 35,000 in 1943.
4. Launch 8,000,000 deadweight
tons of merchant shipping in 1942;
10.000,000 tons in 1943. A total of
1,100,000 deadweight tons was
launched in 1941.
WARNS OF COST
"War costs money," he added. "So
far we have hardly even begun to
pay for it. This means taxes and
bonds and bonds and taxes. The
superiority of the united nations in
munitions and ships must be over
whelming—so overwhelming that the
Axis nations can never hope to catch
up with us."
The assembled legislators gasped
and applauded in turn as the Presi
dent unfolded his figures and plans—
figures which he hoped would "be
come common knowledge in Ger
many and Japan."
"These figures and similar figures
for a multitude of other implements
of war will give the Japanese and
Nazis a little idea of just what they
accomplished in the attack on Pearl
Harbor," he said.
"We must raise our sights all along
the production line. Let no man say
it cannot be done.
"It must be done—and we have
undertaken to do it."
OFFENSIVE ACTION
He promised that powerful atid
offensive action will be taken against
the Axis "in proper time"; that con
solidation of the war effort of the
20 nations united against the ag
gressors is being achieved.
"We cannot wage this war in a
defensive spirit," he said. "As our
power and our resources are fully
mobilized, we shall carry the attack
against the enemy—we shall hit him
and hit him again wherever and
whenever we can reach him.
"We must keep him far from our
shores, for we intend to bring this
battle to him on his own ground."
American armed forces, he said,
will be used in defensive and offen
sive operations along the entire world
front—in Britain, in the Far East
find on all oceans to guard essential
communications.
PROTECT HEMISPHERE
Likewise, he declared, our fighting
men will protect thks hemisphere
and bases outside it which could be
used for an attack on the Americas.
He warned that "suicide squad
rons" of Axis bombers may attempt
long-range raids in the hope of ter
rorizing the people and disrupting
their morale.
"Our people are not afraid of
that," he said. "We know that we
may have to pay ;i heavy price for
freedom. We will pay that price with
a will . . . No matter what our
enemies in their desperation may
attempt to do to us—we will say,
as the people of London have said,
'We can take it.'"
Then, with his jaw thrust out, he
added:
"And what's more, we can give it
back —and we will give it back—
with compound interest!"
REPORTS ON CONFERENCES
He said great strides had been
made in war council conferences in
Washington, Moscow and Chung
king to co-ordinate Allied military
and economic action for death thrusts
at the Axis.
The united nations will not fight
isolated Wat's —cVich nation going
his own way, he continued. They
are agreed not in spirit and deter
mination alone, but in the broad
conduct of the war in all its phases.
"For the first time since the Japa
nese and Fascists and the Nazis
Started along their blood-stained

course of conquest they now face
the fact that superior forces are as
sembling against them," he said.
"Gone forever are the days when
the aggressors could attack and de
stroy their victims one by one with
out unity of resistance. We of the
united nations will so dispose our
forces that we can strike at the com
mon enemy wherever the greatest
damage can be done."
He radiated confidence in an Al
lied victory.
He cautioned the people to guard
against complacency and defeatism
and not to underrate the "powerful
and cunning enemy."
The Axis will stop at nothing
which gives them the chance to "kill

and destroy," he declared.
It will be a long, bloody war, a
war in which this country must steel
itself to accept reversals, the Presi
dent went on.
"We already have tasted defeat.
We may suffer further setbacks. We
must face the fact of a hard war, a
long war, a bloody war, a costly
war."
He said the nation faces the need
of accomplishing an unprecedented
production task in a short time and
that everybody will be required to
make sacrifices to that end.
Workers will be required to spend
longer hours at their benches and
to produce more; greater quantities
of strategic and raw materials will

be diverted from civilian uses to war
products; higher taxes will be im
posed and luxuries and non-essen
tials must be cut—"only this all-out
scale of production will hasten the
ultimate all-out victory."
Guns from the American arsenal

Appearing in person before a joint
session of Congress to deliver his
annual state of the Union message,
he outlined an all-out war program
of blood—a breath-taking effort that
will cost more than half the antici
pated national income in the fiscal
year beginning July 1.
He disclosed—along with his plans
for a world-wide anti-Axis offensive
—that he had ordered a staggering
increase in the production of planes,
tanks, anti-aircraft guns and ships
during the next 24 months. He broke
the program down into four segments
as follows:
1. Build 60,000 airplanes, including
45,000 combat aircraft, in 1942 and
125,000, including 100,000 combat
units, in 1943. Production in 1941
totaled about 18,000.
2. Produce 45,000 tanks in 1!)42 and
75,000 in 1943.
3. Produce 20,000 anti-aircraft guns
in 1942; 35,000 in 1943.
4. Launch 8,000,000 deadweight
tons of merchant shipping in 1942;
10.000,000 tons in 1943. A total of
1,100,000 deadweight tons was
launched in 1941.
WARNS OF COST
"War costs money," he added. "So
far we have hardly even begun to
pay for it. This means taxes and
bonds and bonds and taxes. The
superiority of the united nations in
munitions and ships must be over
whelming—so overwhelming that the
Axis nations can never hope to catch
up with us."
The assembled legislators gasped
and applauded in turn as the Presi
dent unfolded his figures and plans—
figures which he hoped would "be
come common knowledge in Ger
many and Japan."
"These figures and similar figures
for a multitude of other implements
of war will give the Japanese and
Nazis a little idea of just what they
accomplished in the attack on Pearl
Harbor," he said.
"We must raise our sights all along
the production line. Let no man say
it cannot be done.
"It must be done—and we have
undertaken to do it."
OFFENSIVE ACTION
He promised that powerful atid
offensive action will be taken against
the Axis "in proper time"; that con
solidation of the war effort of the
20 nations united against the ag
gressors is being achieved.
"We cannot wage this war in a
defensive spirit," he said. "As our
power and our resources are fully
mobilized, we shall carry the attack
against the enemy—we shall hit him
and hit him again wherever and
whenever we can reach him.
"We must keep him far from our
shores, for we intend to bring this
battle to him on his own ground."
American armed forces, he said,
will be used in defensive and offen
sive operations along the entire world
front—in Britain, in the Far East
find on all oceans to guard essential
communications.
PROTECT HEMISPHERE
Likewise, he declared, our fighting
men will protect thks hemisphere
and bases outside it which could be
used for an attack on the Americas.
He warned that "suicide squad
rons" of Axis bombers may attempt
long-range raids in the hope of ter
rorizing the people and disrupting
their morale.
"Our people are not afraid of
that," he said. "We know that we
may have to pay ;i heavy price for
freedom. We will pay that price with
a will . . . No matter what our
enemies in their desperation may
attempt to do to us—we will say,
as the people of London have said,
'We can take it.'"
Then, with his jaw thrust out, he
added:
"And what's more, we can give it
back —and we will give it back—
with compound interest!"
REPORTS ON CONFERENCES
He said great strides had been
made in war council conferences in
Washington, Moscow and Chung
king to co-ordinate Allied military
and economic action for death thrusts
at the Axis.
The united nations will not fight
isolated Wat's —cVich nation going
his own way, he continued. They
are agreed not in spirit and deter
mination alone, but in the broad
conduct of the war in all its phases.
"For the first time since the Japa
nese and Fascists and the Nazis
Started along their blood-stained

course of conquest they now face
the fact that superior forces are as
sembling against them," he said.
"Gone forever are the days when
the aggressors could attack and de
stroy their victims one by one with
out unity of resistance. We of the
united nations will so dispose our
forces that we can strike at the com
mon enemy wherever the greatest
damage can be done."
He radiated confidence in an Al
lied victory.
He cautioned the people to guard
against complacency and defeatism
and not to underrate the "powerful
and cunning enemy."
The Axis will stop at nothing
which gives them the chance to "kill

and destroy," he declared.
It will be a long, bloody war, a
war in which this country must steel
itself to accept reversals, the Presi
dent went on.
"We already have tasted defeat.
We may suffer further setbacks. We
must face the fact of a hard war, a
long war, a bloody war, a costly
war."
He said the nation faces the need
of accomplishing an unprecedented
production task in a short time and
that everybody will be required to
make sacrifices to that end.
Workers will be required to spend
longer hours at their benches and
to produce more; greater quantities
of strategic and raw materials will

be diverted from civilian uses to war
products; higher taxes will be im
posed and luxuries and non-essen
tials must be cut—"only this all-out
scale of production will hasten the
ultimate all-out victory."
Guns from the American arsenal
ol democracy are to go not only to
the nations actually fighting the
Axis but to the peoples conquered
by Germany and Japan, Mr. Roose
velt revealed.
"As we get guns to the patriots in
tliose lands they too will fire shots
heard 'round the world," he said.
The objectives of the Allied powers
are clear, he continued.
They comprise "smashing the mili
tarism imposed by war lords upon

their enslaved peoples—the objective
of liberating subjugated nations—
the objective of establishing and se
curing freedom of speech, freedom
of religion, freedom from want and
freedom from fear everywhere in
the world."
He charged that Japan plotted for
half a century the subjugation of all
people in the Far East and in the
islands of the Pacific; the domination
of that ocean by the Japanese mili
tary and naval control of the west
ern coasts of North, Central and
South America.
Italy, he said, adopted a similar
policy of "criminal conquest." It
goal, he declared, was domination
of all North Africa, Egypt, parts of

France, and the entire Mediterra
nean world.
"But the* dreams of empire of the
Japanese and fascist leaders were
modest in comparison with the gar
gantuan aspirations ol Hitler and the
Nazis," he said.
Japan's sneak attack on Pearl
Harbor was intended to stun the
United States—to terrify the gov
ernment to such an extent that it
would divert its industrial and mili
tary strength to the Pacific area, or
even to our continental defense, he
said.
"The plan failed in its purpose,"
he declared, and the legislators
cheered. "We have not been stunned,
we have not been terrified or con

fused."
Proof of this, he observed, is the
assembling of the second session
of the Seventy-seventh Congress,
and the mood of "quiet, grim reso
lution which prevails bodes ill for
those who have conspired and col
laborated to murder world peace."
He said it was bitter not to be
able to relieve the heroic defenders
of Wake Island. It was bitter, too,
not to be able to send a thousand
ships and a million men to the de
fense of the Philippines.
"But this only adds to our deter
mination to see to it that the Stars
and Stripes will fly again over Wake
J and Guam; and that the brave peo
| pie of the Philippines will be rid

of Japanese imperialism, and will
live in freedom, security and inde
pendence," he pledged.
WASIINtiTON 1 , Jan. <i (UP).—
President Roosevelt, pledging the
nation to the mightiest war effort
the world has ever seen, today set
the cost for the next year at $5(»,000,-
000,000 and promised grimly that the
war will he carried to the enemy
"wherever and whenever we can
reach him" until victory is won.
American forces, lie said, will be
on duty along the entire world front.,
including stations in the British
Isles "which constitute an essential
fortress in this world .struggle."
The war will end, he said grimly,
"just as soon as we make it end—by
our combined efforts, our combined
determination to fight through and
work through until the end—the end
of militarism in Germany and Italy
and Japan."

their morale.
"Our people are not afraid of
that," he said. "We know that we
may have to pay ;i heavy price for
freedom. We will pay that price with
a will . . . No matter what our
enemies in their desperation may
attempt to do to us—we will say,
as the people of London have said,
'We can take it.'"
Then, with his jaw thrust out, he
added:
"And what's more, we can give it
back —and we will give it back—
with compound interest!"
REPORTS ON CONFERENCES
He said great strides had been
made in war council conferences in
Washington, Moscow and Chung
king to co-ordinate Allied military
and economic action for death thrusts
at the Axis.
The united nations will not fight
isolated Wat's —cVich nation going
his own way, he continued. They
are agreed not in spirit and deter
mination alone, but in the broad
conduct of the war in all its phases.
"For the first time since the Japa
nese and Fascists and the Nazis
Started along their blood-stained

course of conquest they now face
the fact that superior forces are as
sembling against them," he said.
"Gone forever are the days when
the aggressors could attack and de
stroy their victims one by one with
out unity of resistance. We of the
united nations will so dispose our
forces that we can strike at the com
mon enemy wherever the greatest
damage can be done."
He radiated confidence in an Al
lied victory.
He cautioned the people to guard
against complacency and defeatism
and not to underrate the "powerful
and cunning enemy."
The Axis will stop at nothing
which gives them the chance to "kill

and destroy," he declared.
It will be a long, bloody war, a
war in which this country must steel
itself to accept reversals, the Presi
dent went on.
"We already have tasted defeat.
We may suffer further setbacks. We
must face the fact of a hard war, a
long war, a bloody war, a costly
war."
He said the nation faces the need
of accomplishing an unprecedented
production task in a short time and
that everybody will be required to
make sacrifices to that end.
Workers will be required to spend
longer hours at their benches and
to produce more; greater quantities
of strategic and raw materials will

be diverted from civilian uses to war
products; higher taxes will be im
posed and luxuries and non-essen
tials must be cut—"only this all-out
scale of production will hasten the
ultimate all-out victory."
Guns from the American arsenal
ol democracy are to go not only to
the nations actually fighting the
Axis but to the peoples conquered
by Germany and Japan, Mr. Roose
velt revealed.
"As we get guns to the patriots in
tliose lands they too will fire shots
heard 'round the world," he said.
The objectives of the Allied powers
are clear, he continued.
They comprise "smashing the mili
tarism imposed by war lords upon

their enslaved peoples—the objective
of liberating subjugated nations—
the objective of establishing and se
curing freedom of speech, freedom
of religion, freedom from want and
freedom from fear everywhere in
the world."
He charged that Japan plotted for
half a century the subjugation of all
people in the Far East and in the
islands of the Pacific; the domination
of that ocean by the Japanese mili
tary and naval control of the west
ern coasts of North, Central and
South America.
Italy, he said, adopted a similar
policy of "criminal conquest." It
goal, he declared, was domination
of all North Africa, Egypt, parts of

France, and the entire Mediterra
nean world.
"But the* dreams of empire of the
Japanese and fascist leaders were
modest in comparison with the gar
gantuan aspirations ol Hitler and the
Nazis," he said.
Japan's sneak attack on Pearl
Harbor was intended to stun the
United States—to terrify the gov
ernment to such an extent that it
would divert its industrial and mili
tary strength to the Pacific area, or
even to our continental defense, he
said.
"The plan failed in its purpose,"
he declared, and the legislators
cheered. "We have not been stunned,
we have not been terrified or con

fused."
Proof of this, he observed, is the
assembling of the second session
of the Seventy-seventh Congress,
and the mood of "quiet, grim reso
lution which prevails bodes ill for
those who have conspired and col
laborated to murder world peace."
He said it was bitter not to be
able to relieve the heroic defenders
of Wake Island. It was bitter, too,
not to be able to send a thousand
ships and a million men to the de
fense of the Philippines.
"But this only adds to our deter
mination to see to it that the Stars
and Stripes will fly again over Wake
J and Guam; and that the brave peo
| pie of the Philippines will be rid

of Japanese imperialism, and will
live in freedom, security and inde
pendence," he pledged.
WASIINtiTON 1 , Jan. <i (UP).—
President Roosevelt, pledging the
nation to the mightiest war effort
the world has ever seen, today set
the cost for the next year at $5(»,000,-
000,000 and promised grimly that the
war will he carried to the enemy
"wherever and whenever we can
reach him" until victory is won.
American forces, lie said, will be
on duty along the entire world front.,
including stations in the British
Isles "which constitute an essential
fortress in this world .struggle."
The war will end, he said grimly,
"just as soon as we make it end—by
our combined efforts, our combined
determination to fight through and
work through until the end—the end
of militarism in Germany and Italy
and Japan."
JOINT SESSION
Appearing in person before a joint
session of Congress to deliver his
annual state of the Union message,
he outlined an all-out war program
of blood—a breath-taking effort that
will cost more than half the antici
pated national income in the fiscal
year beginning July 1.
He disclosed—along with his plans
for a world-wide anti-Axis offensive
—that he had ordered a staggering
increase in the production of planes,
tanks, anti-aircraft guns and ships
during the next 24 months. He broke
the program down into four segments
as follows:
1. Build 60,000 airplanes, including
45,000 combat aircraft, in 1942 and
125,000, including 100,000 combat
units, in 1943. Production in 1941
totaled about 18,000.
2. Produce 45,000 tanks in 1!)42 and
75,000 in 1943.
3. Produce 20,000 anti-aircraft guns
in 1942; 35,000 in 1943.
4. Launch 8,000,000 deadweight
tons of merchant shipping in 1942;
10.000,000 tons in 1943. A total of
1,100,000 deadweight tons was
launched in 1941.
WARNS OF COST
"War costs money," he added. "So
far we have hardly even begun to
pay for it. This means taxes and
bonds and bonds and taxes. The
superiority of the united nations in
munitions and ships must be over
whelming—so overwhelming that the
Axis nations can never hope to catch
up with us."
The assembled legislators gasped
and applauded in turn as the Presi
dent unfolded his figures and plans—
figures which he hoped would "be
come common knowledge in Ger
many and Japan."
"These figures and similar figures
for a multitude of other implements
of war will give the Japanese and
Nazis a little idea of just what they
accomplished in the attack on Pearl
Harbor," he said.
"We must raise our sights all along
the production line. Let no man say
it cannot be done.
"It must be done—and we have
undertaken to do it."
OFFENSIVE ACTION
He promised that powerful atid
offensive action will be taken against
the Axis "in proper time"; that con
solidation of the war effort of the
20 nations united against the ag
gressors is being achieved.
"We cannot wage this war in a
defensive spirit," he said. "As our
power and our resources are fully
mobilized, we shall carry the attack
against the enemy—we shall hit him
and hit him again wherever and
whenever we can reach him.
"We must keep him far from our
shores, for we intend to bring this
battle to him on his own ground."
American armed forces, he said,
will be used in defensive and offen
sive operations along the entire world
front—in Britain, in the Far East
find on all oceans to guard essential
communications.
PROTECT HEMISPHERE
Likewise, he declared, our fighting
men will protect thks hemisphere
and bases outside it which could be
used for an attack on the Americas.
He warned that "suicide squad
rons" of Axis bombers may attempt
long-range raids in the hope of ter
rorizing the people and disrupting
their morale.
"Our people are not afraid of
that," he said. "We know that we
may have to pay ;i heavy price for
freedom. We will pay that price with
a will . . . No matter what our
enemies in their desperation may
attempt to do to us—we will say,

ern coasts of North, Central and
South America.
Italy, he said, adopted a similar
policy of "criminal conquest." It
goal, he declared, was domination
of all North Africa, Egypt, parts of

France, and the entire Mediterra
nean world.
"But the* dreams of empire of the
Japanese and fascist leaders were
modest in comparison with the gar
gantuan aspirations ol Hitler and the
Nazis," he said.
Japan's sneak attack on Pearl
Harbor was intended to stun the
United States—to terrify the gov
ernment to such an extent that it
would divert its industrial and mili
tary strength to the Pacific area, or
even to our continental defense, he
said.
"The plan failed in its purpose,"
he declared, and the legislators
cheered. "We have not been stunned,
we have not been terrified or con

fused."
Proof of this, he observed, is the
assembling of the second session
of the Seventy-seventh Congress,
and the mood of "quiet, grim reso
lution which prevails bodes ill for
those who have conspired and col
laborated to murder world peace."
He said it was bitter not to be
able to relieve the heroic defenders
of Wake Island. It was bitter, too,
not to be able to send a thousand
ships and a million men to the de
fense of the Philippines.
"But this only adds to our deter
mination to see to it that the Stars
and Stripes will fly again over Wake
J and Guam; and that the brave peo
| pie of the Philippines will be rid

of Japanese imperialism, and will
live in freedom, security and inde
pendence," he pledged.
WASIINtiTON 1 , Jan. <i (UP).—
President Roosevelt, pledging the
nation to the mightiest war effort
the world has ever seen, today set
the cost for the next year at $5(»,000,-
000,000 and promised grimly that the
war will he carried to the enemy
"wherever and whenever we can
reach him" until victory is won.
American forces, lie said, will be
on duty along the entire world front.,
including stations in the British
Isles "which constitute an essential
fortress in this world .struggle."
The war will end, he said grimly,
"just as soon as we make it end—by
our combined efforts, our combined
determination to fight through and
work through until the end—the end
of militarism in Germany and Italy
and Japan."
JOINT SESSION
Appearing in person before a joint
session of Congress to deliver his
annual state of the Union message,
he outlined an all-out war program
of blood—a breath-taking effort that
will cost more than half the antici
pated national income in the fiscal
year beginning July 1.
He disclosed—along with his plans
for a world-wide anti-Axis offensive
—that he had ordered a staggering
increase in the production of planes,
tanks, anti-aircraft guns and ships
during the next 24 months. He broke
the program down into four segments
as follows:
1. Build 60,000 airplanes, including
45,000 combat aircraft, in 1942 and
125,000, including 100,000 combat
units, in 1943. Production in 1941
totaled about 18,000.
2. Produce 45,000 tanks in 1!)42 and
75,000 in 1943.
3. Produce 20,000 anti-aircraft guns
in 1942; 35,000 in 1943.
4. Launch 8,000,000 deadweight
tons of merchant shipping in 1942;
10.000,000 tons in 1943. A total of
1,100,000 deadweight tons was
launched in 1941.
WARNS OF COST
"War costs money," he added. "So
far we have hardly even begun to
pay for it. This means taxes and
bonds and bonds and taxes. The
superiority of the united nations in
munitions and ships must be over
whelming—so overwhelming that the
Axis nations can never hope to catch
up with us."
The assembled legislators gasped
and applauded in turn as the Presi
dent unfolded his figures and plans—
figures which he hoped would "be
come common knowledge in Ger
many and Japan."
"These figures and similar figures
for a multitude of other implements
of war will give the Japanese and
Nazis a little idea of just what they
accomplished in the attack on Pearl
Harbor," he said.
"We must raise our sights all along
the production line. Let no man say
it cannot be done.
"It must be done—and we have
undertaken to do it."
OFFENSIVE ACTION
He promised that powerful atid
offensive action will be taken against
the Axis "in proper time"; that con
solidation of the war effort of the
20 nations united against the ag
gressors is being achieved.
"We cannot wage this war in a
defensive spirit," he said. "As our
power and our resources are fully
mobilized, we shall carry the attack
against the enemy—we shall hit him
and hit him again wherever and
whenever we can reach him.
"We must keep him far from our
shores, for we intend to bring this
battle to him on his own ground."
American armed forces, he said,
will be used in defensive and offen
sive operations along the entire world
front—in Britain, in the Far East
find on all oceans to guard essential
communications.
PROTECT HEMISPHERE
Likewise, he declared, our fighting
men will protect thks hemisphere
and bases outside it which could be
used for an attack on the Americas.
He warned that "suicide squad
rons" of Axis bombers may attempt
long-range raids in the hope of ter
rorizing the people and disrupting
their morale.
"Our people are not afraid of
that," he said. "We know that we
may have to pay ;i heavy price for
freedom. We will pay that price with
a will . . . No matter what our
enemies in their desperation may
attempt to do to us—we will say,
as the people of London have said,
'We can take it.'"
Then, with his jaw thrust out, he
added:
"And what's more, we can give it
back —and we will give it back—
with compound interest!"
REPORTS ON CONFERENCES
He said great strides had been
made in war council conferences in
Washington, Moscow and Chung
king to co-ordinate Allied military
and economic action for death thrusts
at the Axis.
The united nations will not fight
isolated Wat's —cVich nation going
his own way, he continued. They
are agreed not in spirit and deter
mination alone, but in the broad
conduct of the war in all its phases.
"For the first time since the Japa
nese and Fascists and the Nazis
Started along their blood-stained

course of conquest they now face
the fact that superior forces are as
sembling against them," he said.
"Gone forever are the days when
the aggressors could attack and de
stroy their victims one by one with
out unity of resistance. We of the
united nations will so dispose our
forces that we can strike at the com
mon enemy wherever the greatest
damage can be done."
He radiated confidence in an Al
lied victory.
He cautioned the people to guard
against complacency and defeatism
and not to underrate the "powerful
and cunning enemy."
The Axis will stop at nothing
which gives them the chance to "kill

and destroy," he declared.
It will be a long, bloody war, a
war in which this country must steel
itself to accept reversals, the Presi
dent went on.
"We already have tasted defeat.
We may suffer further setbacks. We
must face the fact of a hard war, a
long war, a bloody war, a costly
war."
He said the nation faces the need
of accomplishing an unprecedented
production task in a short time and
that everybody will be required to
make sacrifices to that end.
Workers will be required to spend
longer hours at their benches and
to produce more; greater quantities
of strategic and raw materials will

be diverted from civilian uses to war
products; higher taxes will be im
posed and luxuries and non-essen
tials must be cut—"only this all-out
scale of production will hasten the
ultimate all-out victory."
Guns from the American arsenal
ol democracy are to go not only to
the nations actually fighting the
Axis but to the peoples conquered
by Germany and Japan, Mr. Roose
velt revealed.
"As we get guns to the patriots in
tliose lands they too will fire shots
heard 'round the world," he said.
The objectives of the Allied powers
are clear, he continued.
They comprise "smashing the mili
tarism imposed by war lords upon

their enslaved peoples—the objective
of liberating subjugated nations—
the objective of establishing and se
curing freedom of speech, freedom
of religion, freedom from want and
freedom from fear everywhere in
the world."
He charged that Japan plotted for
half a century the subjugation of all
people in the Far East and in the
islands of the Pacific; the domination
of that ocean by the Japanese mili
tary and naval control of the west
ern coasts of North, Central and
South America.
Italy, he said, adopted a similar
policy of "criminal conquest." It
goal, he declared, was domination
of all North Africa, Egypt, parts of

France, and the entire Mediterra
nean world.
"But the* dreams of empire of the
Japanese and fascist leaders were
modest in comparison with the gar
gantuan aspirations ol Hitler and the
