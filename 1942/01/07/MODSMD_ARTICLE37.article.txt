# Dutch Commander

### 

VICE ADMIRAL E. E. L. Helfrirh,
in command of the Netherlands
East Indies sea and air forces. The
Dutch have given an excellent ac
count of themselves thus far in the
Pacific war; their airmen have
sunk many Japanese transports
and other ships, and tlu-ir gunners
have taken a good toll of enemy
aircraft.
