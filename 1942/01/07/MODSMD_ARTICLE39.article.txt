cussed in Executive Committee

ing will be based primarily on Ex
Committee's decisions regarding
these suggestions.
PROPOSALS LISTED
These proposals include:
1. While women's late leaves
should not be restricted at present,

ing. This was decided upon because

ents not only during blackouts but
in event of disaster.

ing. This was decided upon because
of University responsibility to par
ents not only during blackouts but
in event of disaster.

ities.
