# Excom Grants '42 Plea For Tom Dorsey's Band To Play at Senior Prom
## Social Life Refocused as Action Undertaken to Enforce Blackout And Emergency Rules in Council 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Executive Committee last night modified the recommendation of a
committee of student leaders that there be no more "big name band"
dances by voting to allow the Senior class to engage Tcmmy Dorsey, if
possible, for its prom. The recommendation was made in view of the na
tional emergency.

The action was taken following a
long discussion started by the open
ing plea of Senior Class Plesident
Bill Cowden who said that a class
committee had practically completed
plans for having a big name band at
the dance, that the class was badly
in need of the money which would
be raised at such an affair, and that
the plan seemed congruous with the
explicit policy, national and local,
of normalcy during the emergency.
The recommending committee of
27 student leaders had previously
come out as opposed to big name
bands on campus because it was be
lieved they constituted an unwar
ranted expense in view of the grav
ity of the times and because such a
display would be in slightly bad
taste.
The final motion granted the sen
iors the exception, but Isabel Faw
cett's motion stated that this should
be the last such affair of the school
year.
Other business of the committee
was as follows:
Other Emergency Recommenda
tions: Excom adopted other recom
mendations made by the larger
group. A resolution was passed ap
proving a refocusing of social life on
campus and it was recommended
that a by-law be adopted stating that
all social functions sponsored by or
ganizations are to be held on
campus.
Another resolution reads, '"Execu
tive Committee favors the Adminis
tration's effort to intensify academic
activity on the campus and urges
that the student body support this
effort wholeheartedly." The Com
mittee also agreed that "quiet hours*>
should be rigidly enfoiced within
living groups.
Blackout Violations: Chairman
Jackson appointed a subcommittee to
define violations of blackouts and to
outline a system of penalties to be
imposed by the student councils.
Tiff Denton, Stanley Owen and
Rosemarie Mullany were named to
the subcommittee.
Defense Appointments: Harry
Morgan was confirmed as head of
the selective service information
bureau; Stanley Owen was appoint
ed to co-operate with the office of
Civilian Defense, and Ralph Schaf-
