## 
### 
The United Slates government is
keenly interested in instruction in
modern foreign languages, according
to speakers at a convention of the
Modern Language Association of
America at Indianapolis in Decem
ber.
It was pointed out that each army
division operating in a foreign terri
tory should have at least forty men
in it who are able to speak the lan
guage of the region, yet the army
has nowhere near enough qualified
linguists to fill the demand. The
assembled teachers were urged to
keep on with their work, and to do
it even better, if possible.
Professor Bayard Morgan, chair
man of the Stanford Department of
Germanic Languages, suggested that
"what we need for the fullest effi
ciency is an 'army' of language
I teachers." He also recalled that over
! a year ago, President Wilbur had
i urged that students not discontinue
the study of German just because
: Germany might be regarded as an
enemy country, but rather to in
crease their attention to it as a
means of understanding the people
of that nation. This statement, ac
cording to Professor Morgan, was
expressing, far in advance, the pres
ent attitude of the government.
