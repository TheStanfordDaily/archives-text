r | I HE WAY everyone is pouncing on Jim Pollard to be the caging sensa
tion of the Pacific Coast this season brings back memories of the huge
gobs of copy written about Bill DeCorrevont, the terrific Chicago high
school gridder, before he matriculated at Northwestern.
We only hope that Pollard doesn't have the same ill fate that the Chi
cago lad did. Not that '"Bullet Bill" wasn't a pretty darn good footballer,
but he just had such an out-of-range reputation to live up to that he
was somewhat of a disappointment in his collegiate grid career.
To get back to the tall, angular Indian basketball player. Pollard has
yet to play a minute as a member of the Stanford varsity. He did not
play either in the one fall quarter game or during the vacation schedule.
But he is still being viewed as the big man on the Indian squad.
True, Pollard is much further up the basketball ladder than most

sophomore. Still there are a few oth
er boys on the club who can play a
bit of basketball, not the least among
whom are the two-year veterans
Bill Cowden and Don Burness. They
shouldn't be overlooked while the
sophomore is getting the praise which
he deserves.
As we see it, Burness is the last of
the super-smooth cagers on the Card
quintet. For, while it was smooth
ness and fancy ball-handling that
featured the Indian attack last sea
son, it is height and ball control
that is the outstanding point in
Stanford's offense now. Don's shoot
ing, easy ball handling, and general
floor game should play an important
part in Stanford's defense of her
southern division hoop crown.
Because they are so much taller
as a team, the Indian hoopsters will
not have to play as smooth a game
of basketball as last year's gang did.
Maybe they will anyway, although
we can't quite visualize them
handling that apple with the same

deftness that Kenny Davidson, Don Williams, Fordy Anderson, Burness,
and Cowden did as a team.

TN TAKING over where Bob Burnett 'left off Darrell "Red" Holman, new
mural head, has a terrific job on his hands. Burnett, during his short
tenure, turned in one of the best jobs ever of handling the sport that has
more competitors than all the rest of the university's sports put together.
But there is no doubt in our mind but what Holman will carry on in
fine style. Having served as an assistant coach at Santa Clara high school
for two years, Red is well acquainted with the problems ol athletic or
ganization and should be able to handle the intramural program with
ease.
Before graduating in 1937, Red was a three-year letterman in baseball
and was team captain in his senior year.
Now that we've given the big redhead a build-up, he'll have to come
through. He can count on the help of The Daily sports department.

d iNE ALL-AMERICAN football team that received little publicity in
these parts was the one selected by the National Intercollegiate Sports
Writers Association, the votes of which were compiled by Bob Kunkel of
St. Louis, Mo.
Although the sports editors of the only ten schools in or near the
Pacific Coast Conference voted (and our vote for him didn't count),
Stanford's Frankie Albert got more first team votes than any other foot
baller in the United States. He was the only coast player on the first
team. Cal's Bob Reinhard and Washington's Ray Frankowski were on the
second team, while Nick Susoeff of W.S.C. and Chuck Taylor of Stanford
were selected on team number five. Freddie Meyer and Pete Knietovic
of Stanford were on the seventh team, along with Bill Sewell of W.S.C.
and Curt Mecham of Oregon. Vic Lindskog was named ninth team center.
The first team was as follows:
Holt Rast (Alabama) and Joe Blalock (Clemson), ends; Alf Bauman
(Northwestern) and Dick Wildung (Minnesota), tackles; Endicott Peabody
(Harvard) and Chal Daniel (Texas), guards; Darold Jenkins (Missouri),
center; Frank Albert, captain (Stanford), Bruce Smith (Minnesota), Frank
Sinkwich (Georgia), and Bob Westfall (Michigan), backs.
An interesting note is the fact that although he wasn't even in school,
Dick Palmer, number one Indian guard on the championship team of
1940, was nominated. Guess they thought he slipped a little this year, for
he wasn't even given honorable mention.

TN TAKING over where Bob Burnett 'left off Darrell "Red" Holman, new

tenure, turned in one of the best jobs ever of handling the sport that has
more competitors than all the rest of the university's sports put together.
But there is no doubt in our mind but what Holman will carry on in
fine style. Having served as an assistant coach at Santa Clara high school
for two years, Red is well acquainted with the problems ol athletic or
ganization and should be able to handle the intramural program with
ease.
Before graduating in 1937, Red was a three-year letterman in baseball
and was team captain in his senior year.

d iNE ALL-AMERICAN football team that received little publicity in
these parts was the one selected by the National Intercollegiate Sports
Writers Association, the votes of which were compiled by Bob Kunkel of
St. Louis, Mo.
Although the sports editors of the only ten schools in or near the
Pacific Coast Conference voted (and our vote for him didn't count),
Stanford's Frankie Albert got more first team votes than any other foot
baller in the United States. He was the only coast player on the first
team. Cal's Bob Reinhard and Washington's Ray Frankowski were on the
second team, while Nick Susoeff of W.S.C. and Chuck Taylor of Stanford
were selected on team number five. Freddie Meyer and Pete Knietovic
of Stanford were on the seventh team, along with Bill Sewell of W.S.C.
and Curt Mecham of Oregon. Vic Lindskog was named ninth team center.
The first team was as follows:
Holt Rast (Alabama) and Joe Blalock (Clemson), ends; Alf Bauman
(Northwestern) and Dick Wildung (Minnesota), tackles; Endicott Peabody
(Harvard) and Chal Daniel (Texas), guards; Darold Jenkins (Missouri),
center; Frank Albert, captain (Stanford), Bruce Smith (Minnesota), Frank
Sinkwich (Georgia), and Bob Westfall (Michigan), backs.
An interesting note is the fact that although he wasn't even in school,
Dick Palmer, number one Indian guard on the championship team of
1940, was nominated. Guess they thought he slipped a little this year, for
he wasn't even given honorable mention.


DON BURNESS
r | I HE WAY everyone is pouncing on Jim Pollard to be the caging sensa
tion of the Pacific Coast this season brings back memories of the huge
gobs of copy written about Bill DeCorrevont, the terrific Chicago high
school gridder, before he matriculated at Northwestern.
We only hope that Pollard doesn't have the same ill fate that the Chi
cago lad did. Not that '"Bullet Bill" wasn't a pretty darn good footballer,
but he just had such an out-of-range reputation to live up to that he
was somewhat of a disappointment in his collegiate grid career.
To get back to the tall, angular Indian basketball player. Pollard has
yet to play a minute as a member of the Stanford varsity. He did not
play either in the one fall quarter game or during the vacation schedule.
But he is still being viewed as the big man on the Indian squad.
True, Pollard is much further up the basketball ladder than most

sophomore. Still there are a few oth
er boys on the club who can play a
bit of basketball, not the least among
whom are the two-year veterans
Bill Cowden and Don Burness. They
shouldn't be overlooked while the
sophomore is getting the praise which
he deserves.
As we see it, Burness is the last of
the super-smooth cagers on the Card
quintet. For, while it was smooth
ness and fancy ball-handling that
featured the Indian attack last sea
son, it is height and ball control
that is the outstanding point in
Stanford's offense now. Don's shoot

d iNE ALL-AMERICAN football team that received little publicity in
these parts was the one selected by the National Intercollegiate Sports
Writers Association, the votes of which were compiled by Bob Kunkel of
St. Louis, Mo.
Although the sports editors of the only ten schools in or near the
Pacific Coast Conference voted (and our vote for him didn't count),
Stanford's Frankie Albert got more first team votes than any other foot
baller in the United States. He was the only coast player on the first
team. Cal's Bob Reinhard and Washington's Ray Frankowski were on the
second team, while Nick Susoeff of W.S.C. and Chuck Taylor of Stanford
were selected on team number five. Freddie Meyer and Pete Knietovic
of Stanford were on the seventh team, along with Bill Sewell of W.S.C.
and Curt Mecham of Oregon. Vic Lindskog was named ninth team center.
The first team was as follows:
Holt Rast (Alabama) and Joe Blalock (Clemson), ends; Alf Bauman
(Northwestern) and Dick Wildung (Minnesota), tackles; Endicott Peabody
(Harvard) and Chal Daniel (Texas), guards; Darold Jenkins (Missouri),
center; Frank Albert, captain (Stanford), Bruce Smith (Minnesota), Frank
Sinkwich (Georgia), and Bob Westfall (Michigan), backs.
An interesting note is the fact that although he wasn't even in school,
Dick Palmer, number one Indian guard on the championship team of
1940, was nominated. Guess they thought he slipped a little this year, for
he wasn't even given honorable mention.


DON BURNESS
r | I HE WAY everyone is pouncing on Jim Pollard to be the caging sensa
tion of the Pacific Coast this season brings back memories of the huge
gobs of copy written about Bill DeCorrevont, the terrific Chicago high
school gridder, before he matriculated at Northwestern.
We only hope that Pollard doesn't have the same ill fate that the Chi
cago lad did. Not that '"Bullet Bill" wasn't a pretty darn good footballer,
but he just had such an out-of-range reputation to live up to that he
was somewhat of a disappointment in his collegiate grid career.
To get back to the tall, angular Indian basketball player. Pollard has
yet to play a minute as a member of the Stanford varsity. He did not
play either in the one fall quarter game or during the vacation schedule.
But he is still being viewed as the big man on the Indian squad.
True, Pollard is much further up the basketball ladder than most

sophomore. Still there are a few oth
er boys on the club who can play a
bit of basketball, not the least among
whom are the two-year veterans
Bill Cowden and Don Burness. They
shouldn't be overlooked while the
sophomore is getting the praise which
he deserves.
As we see it, Burness is the last of
the super-smooth cagers on the Card
quintet. For, while it was smooth
ness and fancy ball-handling that
featured the Indian attack last sea
son, it is height and ball control
that is the outstanding point in
Stanford's offense now. Don's shoot
ing, easy ball handling, and general
floor game should play an important
part in Stanford's defense of her
southern division hoop crown.
Because they are so much taller
as a team, the Indian hoopsters will
not have to play as smooth a game
of basketball as last year's gang did.
Maybe they will anyway, although
we can't quite visualize them
handling that apple with the same

deftness that Kenny Davidson, Don Williams, Fordy Anderson, Burness,
and Cowden did as a team.

TN TAKING over where Bob Burnett 'left off Darrell "Red" Holman, new
mural head, has a terrific job on his hands. Burnett, during his short
tenure, turned in one of the best jobs ever of handling the sport that has
more competitors than all the rest of the university's sports put together.
But there is no doubt in our mind but what Holman will carry on in
fine style. Having served as an assistant coach at Santa Clara high school
for two years, Red is well acquainted with the problems ol athletic or
ganization and should be able to handle the intramural program with
ease.
Before graduating in 1937, Red was a three-year letterman in baseball
and was team captain in his senior year.
Now that we've given the big redhead a build-up, he'll have to come
through. He can count on the help of The Daily sports department.
