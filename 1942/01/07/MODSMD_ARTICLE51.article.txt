# Here's New Track Prospectâ€”-- 'Cy' Cripe of the Firehouse
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
Their bag of tricks apparently ex- I
hausted, the Firehouse boys fought
desperately to overcome a one-point !
lead on a damp November day last I
year. The Blazechasers, with two
legs on the trophy, were trailing the j
Kappa Sigs 6-7 in the crucial play
off with less than two minutes to go, j
when one more trick popped out of j
the bag in the person of Wyland I
"Wy" Cripe, '43.
Heralded as a speed burner for
McCloud's old spot at halfback early
in the season, Wy turned out to be
a place-kicker extraordinaire, calm
ly dropping back behind the 30-
yard line to boot the ball squarely
between the uprights for a 9-7
win and the perpetual trophy.
NICKNAMEI) 'MOUSE'
Wy reminds you right away of a
mouse and was appropriately nick
named by his coach, Monte Pfyl, at
the first practice session last fall. His
snapping blue eyes take in every
thing with a darting glance and, like
other athletes that take their sports
seriously, he is always on the alert. I

Although he does a lot of skiing in
! the winter and plans to turn out for
! varsity football if he is still in school
next fall, Wy's first love is track and
j this year Pitch Johnson is counting
j on him to carry a good share of the
I load in the middle distance races. At
the Coast cross-country meet at
Portland in November, Cripe was the
| first Stanford man to cross the line.
GOOD HALF-MILER
Cripe ran the half in 1:58 at Mo
desto J.C. but he may run any
thing from the 440 up this spring
when Johnson gets to juggling his
runners, which include Bob Comp
ton, Francis Olson, and Russ Col
lier. Wy always wanted to come to
Stanford, but he had some tempting
offers from Wyoming, Colorado, and
other universities. Right now, he
and some of his friends at the Fire
house are planning to make up a
squadron in the naval air force.
When he was asked about the
lack of track talent at Stanford,
Wy forecast:
"With hard work, we'll give Cal
I a fight for every point."

Kappa Sigs 6-7 in the crucial play
off with less than two minutes to go, j
when one more trick popped out of j
the bag in the person of Wyland I
"Wy" Cripe, '43.
Heralded as a speed burner for
McCloud's old spot at halfback early
in the season, Wy turned out to be
a place-kicker extraordinaire, calm
ly dropping back behind the 30-
yard line to boot the ball squarely
between the uprights for a 9-7
win and the perpetual trophy.
NICKNAMEI) 'MOUSE'
Wy reminds you right away of a
mouse and was appropriately nick
named by his coach, Monte Pfyl, at
the first practice session last fall. His
snapping blue eyes take in every
thing with a darting glance and, like
other athletes that take their sports
seriously, he is always on the alert. I

Although he does a lot of skiing in
! the winter and plans to turn out for
! varsity football if he is still in school
next fall, Wy's first love is track and
j this year Pitch Johnson is counting
j on him to carry a good share of the
I load in the middle distance races. At
the Coast cross-country meet at
Portland in November, Cripe was the
| first Stanford man to cross the line.
GOOD HALF-MILER
Cripe ran the half in 1:58 at Mo
desto J.C. but he may run any
thing from the 440 up this spring
when Johnson gets to juggling his
runners, which include Bob Comp
ton, Francis Olson, and Russ Col
lier. Wy always wanted to come to
Stanford, but he had some tempting
offers from Wyoming, Colorado, and
other universities. Right now, he
and some of his friends at the Fire
house are planning to make up a
squadron in the naval air force.
When he was asked about the
lack of track talent at Stanford,
Wy forecast:
"With hard work, we'll give Cal
I a fight for every point."
Their bag of tricks apparently ex- I
hausted, the Firehouse boys fought
desperately to overcome a one-point !
lead on a damp November day last I
year. The Blazechasers, with two
