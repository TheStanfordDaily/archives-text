Bob Allan, with Bill Smith crew
ing, grabbed high-point individual
honors in the first annual Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate small boat
sailing races held on Newport Bay
Decmber 2!). Two other Stanford
teams, Howard Wright-Joe Welsh
and Sonny Simonds-Bob Hampton,
took ninth and sixteenth places.
Stanford's G-man team finished in
third place behind Cal Tech and
j Oregon.
Allan and Smith captured two
firsts for a total of 72'/> points.
The Redskins bounced into an
i early lead, still holding the high
j team total, but Cal Tech notched a
| series of seconds and thirds, while
; the Indians fell back when Wright
; was involved in a collision at the
start of the fifth race.
Collision and all, Stanford gar
nered 142 Mi points, a scant point and
one-half behind Oregon. Cal Tech
won with 181%. Pomona was third
with 114, Ucla followed with 108, and
U.S.C. tallied 72.
Eighteen Dyer dinghies competed
in the five-race series off the New
port Yacht Club, and the skippers
drew lots for boats. Beautiful weath
er prevailed, aided by a 10-mile
breeze, which gave entrants the best
possible sailing conditions.
Cal Tech will receive a perpetual
plaque for its victory, and Stanford
will receive the third-place plaque

and IND, the high-point plaque.
Plans for future racing, including
the California matches and next
spring's school championships, will

be made despite the war.
