# Pollard Stands Out as Varsity Cagers Resume Practice after Arizona Invasion
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity cagers, frcsli oir the Mcmclay Daylight, stepped onto
the Pavilion's waxy, newly polished floor yesterday for their first practice
of the new year. As expected, Jimmy Pollard was in suti and looking
great after a long lay-off.
After four victories in the Bay area and a successful Arizona invasion.

.Coach Everett Dean sends his squad
against College of the Pacific here
Friday night and St. Mary's Satur
day night.
One week from Friday the Indians
are slated for a rematch with Santa
Clara at the home roost.
TROJANS LOOM STRONG
Looking over the conference situa
tion a short two weeks before the
season opens, U.S.C. looks to be the
most formidable opponent the Red
skins must face in their quest of a
second straight southern division
championship.
The Trojans almost outscored
Long Island U. in Madison Square
Garden, and any team that comes
within one point of L.I.U. is playing
good basketball.
At the Bear lair, the same old griz
zlies are toeing the mark for Coach
Nibs Price: Roy Tamm, Merv La
faille, Bob Biles, Bob Alameida, and
Jim Bailey. Bill McGee, last year'*;
captain and high scorer, was grad
uated. Possibly the difference be
tween a winning and losing combina
tion, McGee's absence leaves a big
hole to fill in the Bear team.
U.C.L.A. UPSETS BRONCOS
Ucla, always the unpredictable in
any sport, seemed destined to handle
the cellar spot in the league until
last week, when they blasted the
Santa Clara Broncos, 67-52.
On paper, Stanford has one of the
greatest potential squads in the his
tory of the sport. Burness, Voss,
Cowden, Dallmar, and Pollard
should combine to form one of the
speediest,i dead-eye-Dick, aggrega
tions in a long time.
GOOD RESERVES
Right behind the front lines are
enough capable second stringers to
keep pouring a steady stream of first
rate players into the game.
Non-lettermen from the '41 squad
going strong on the Pavilion hard
wood are Jack Dana, Fred Linari,
Larry Dee, John Eikelman, Leo Mc-
Caffrey, Tom Fuller, and Ross
Meyer.
Leading candidates up from the
frosh are John Leddy, Bob Halstead,
Bill Hooper, Bud Madden, Bob
Wreisner, and Dick McDonough.

Bill Hooper, Bud Madden, Bob
Wreisner, and Dick McDonough.
Stanford's varsity cagers, frcsli oir the Mcmclay Daylight, stepped onto
the Pavilion's waxy, newly polished floor yesterday for their first practice
of the new year. As expected, Jimmy Pollard was in suti and looking
great after a long lay-off.
After four victories in the Bay area and a successful Arizona invasion.

.Coach Everett Dean sends his squad
against College of the Pacific here
Friday night and St. Mary's Satur
day night.
One week from Friday the Indians
are slated for a rematch with Santa
Clara at the home roost.
TROJANS LOOM STRONG
Looking over the conference situa
tion a short two weeks before the
season opens, U.S.C. looks to be the
most formidable opponent the Red
skins must face in their quest of a
second straight southern division
championship.
The Trojans almost outscored
Long Island U. in Madison Square
Garden, and any team that comes
within one point of L.I.U. is playing
good basketball.
At the Bear lair, the same old griz
zlies are toeing the mark for Coach
Nibs Price: Roy Tamm, Merv La
faille, Bob Biles, Bob Alameida, and
Jim Bailey. Bill McGee, last year'*;
captain and high scorer, was grad
uated. Possibly the difference be
tween a winning and losing combina
tion, McGee's absence leaves a big
hole to fill in the Bear team.
U.C.L.A. UPSETS BRONCOS
Ucla, always the unpredictable in
any sport, seemed destined to handle
the cellar spot in the league until
last week, when they blasted the
Santa Clara Broncos, 67-52.
On paper, Stanford has one of the
greatest potential squads in the his
tory of the sport. Burness, Voss,
Cowden, Dallmar, and Pollard
should combine to form one of the
speediest,i dead-eye-Dick, aggrega
tions in a long time.
GOOD RESERVES
Right behind the front lines are
enough capable second stringers to
keep pouring a steady stream of first
rate players into the game.
Non-lettermen from the '41 squad
going strong on the Pavilion hard
wood are Jack Dana, Fred Linari,
Larry Dee, John Eikelman, Leo Mc-
Caffrey, Tom Fuller, and Ross
Meyer.
Leading candidates up from the
frosh are John Leddy, Bob Halstead,
Bill Hooper, Bud Madden, Bob
Wreisner, and Dick McDonough.
