# Gridders Ban 'Y' Formation

### 
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 6 (UP). -
Syracuse Univei'sity's revolutionary
football formation, in which the cen
, ter faced the backfield when he
; passed the ball, was banned tonight
l by the rules committee of the Na
| tional Collegiate Athletic Association
at its final session.
j Less than half a dozen changes
were made in football rules by the
committee, which announced prior to
| going into its first session Sunday
that it hoped to "freeze" the rules
for the benefit of men called up for
military duty who would be playing
the game at army camps and navy
1 bases.
The "backward facing center"
tactic was devised during the past
season by Coach Ossie Solem of
Syracuse, who claimed it was legal
' under the existing rules and added
speed and deception to the game.
The rules committee announced
| that hereafter in order for players
j to be considered on the line of scrim-
I mage they must face their oppo
nents.
Although the liberal substitution
i rule was not altered, the rules com
; mittee clarified it by giving the ref
'â–  eree authority to start the clock
during the last two minutes of each
half if he thought substitutions were
being made to delay the game.
The third major change was a
i clarification of the ruling under
! which both teams are called offside.
Under the revised rule, referees
must decide which team was offside
first and drew its opponent into be
ing offside also. The rules commit
tee held that only in rare cases
could both teams be considered off
i side and on those infrequent occa
sions the referee can rule both off
side.
