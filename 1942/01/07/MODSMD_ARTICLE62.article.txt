lor two years, and was a three-year
letterman in baseball. He was cho
sen team captain in his senior year.
Holman announced today that mu
ral basketball sign-ups will begin
immediately. Team managers should
sign up their teams so that play can
get under way the first of next
week.
Golf and horseshoe play-offs will
be held the first two weeks of the
quarter, according to Holman. There
are only a few games left to be
played so that play-offs should be
completed easily in the two-week
period. Game brackets are posted
on the mural bulletin board in the
gym. Managers should consult the
list and arrange games as soon as
possible so that winter mural ac
tivities can begin.
