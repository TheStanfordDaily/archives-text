# Louis Offers Help For Army Relief
## 
### 
GREENWOOD LAKE, N.Y., Jan.
6 (UP). —Joe Louis would like to
defend his heavyweight title for the
benefit of army relief organizations
within 60 days after Friday night's
tilt with Buddy Baer, if he doesn't
lose the crown to big Buddy.
That's what Jolting Joe said today
after four rounds of sparring with
four mates, in his next-to-last work
out—a session that saw him con
centrate on new bobbing and weav
ing technique, indicating he will try
to make Friday's brawl a Dempsey-
Willard affair.
Joe, who is in Class 1-A of the
draft, said he desired to make an
army benefit fight before entering
the service, because many people—
particularly among his own race —
thought he had shown preference
among the services when he agreed
to fight Baer for the benefit of the
Navy Relief Society.

LAKEWOOD, N.J., Jan. 6 (UP).—
Buddy Baer took an eight-mile jog
on the road and boxed three fast
rounds with sparring mate Danny
Cox today in preparation for his
heavyweight title bout with Joe
Louis at Madison Square Garden
Friday night. After his workout
Baer weighed 243, the weight at
which he'll probably enter the ring.
