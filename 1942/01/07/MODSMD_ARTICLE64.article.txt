## Top-Notch Piedmont Quintet To Face '45 Hoopsters Friday 
### 
Piedmont High's highly-rated prep basketcers come (o Stanford Friday
night with all the ability needed to start the freshman hoop schedule with
a defeat for the Farm yearlings.
Basing their attack around forward "Babe" Iliggins, the Piedmonters
have already beaten Oakland Tcch, considered by most critics as the top
.'earn in the Oakland Athletic League 1

basketball race. Therefore a frosh
squad that is just getting itself
thoroughly collected after a vaca
tion layoff which did not hamper the !
coming opposition is in for a tough
evening.
iVVO FROSII TEAMS
However, you'll find no one sell
ing the frosh short. The Stanfordites
have at least two quintets that ap
pear in practice to be pretty well
balanced with a good assortment of
high-school trained boys that turn
in some sharp passing and good floor
work. The squad lacks the services
of any outstanding marksman.
Although still in the theory stage,
a starting frosh line-up might find
Fred Parsons, an exceptionally
speedy boy and clean passer from
Oakland, and Dave Brown, former
Piedmont High man, at the forward
posts; Jack Heald, all-state center
from Billings, Mnotana, at center;
and Oakland's Fred Ferroggiaro and
Bob Hall at guard posts.
SECOND QUINT
Against this set-up in practice I
last night was another quint with I
Bob Barsocchini from Washington j
High, San Francisco and Clarence j
Woodard of Fairfield at forward; !
John Hartwell from San Leandro at
the pivot spot; and Dave Pate, Den
ver, and Bob Hagopian, Hemet, at
guards. Alternating in the practice
set-up were Bill Spragins, Los An
gels, Dave Porter, South Pasadena.
Any and all of the above may see
action Friday, with the first five
perhaps having an inside look. After
the Piedmont struggle the frosh will
have another week of practice ses
sions before a January 16 game
against the Santa Clara yearlings.
The next night on January 17 the
frosh face San Jose High, and the
following week-end they play Gali
leo High in the first of a series of
games against San Francisco prep
squads, which will include tilts with
Lowell and Poly on January 31 and
February 14, respectively.

Philip Neer of Stanford was in
tercollegiate tennis champion in
1921.
