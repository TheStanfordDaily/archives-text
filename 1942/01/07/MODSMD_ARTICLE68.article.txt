WHILE the students' part in Stanford Civilian
Defense got under way wiih Ex Committee
action last night, Stanford's Civilian Defense
Council deserves a hearty round of applause
for their prompt and efficient handling of emer
gency preparations.
War struck when the Farm was in the midst
of that quaint old quarterly custom of final ex
aminations. Student participation in the hastily
drawn-up plans was necessarily limited, but
members of the faculty and Administration
formed a Civilian Defense Council which didn't
waste a minute in seeing that this community
did not lag behind others in this Bay area.
Students went home for the holidays, but the
Civilian Defense Council kept right on the job
at hand, meeting every day or so, preparing an
efficient, smoothly operating plan for protecting
Stanford against possible air raids or disasters.
Two powerful new sirens were installed, air
raid wardens were appointed for the newly
formed districts, blackout protection was in
stalled in dormitories and University buildings,
direct wire communications were made with
the Fourth Interceptor Command, the police
force was expanded, many other necessary
actions were taken promptly, without delay or
mismanagement.
Heading the Stanford Civilian Defense Coun
cil are Frank F. Walker, financial vice-president,
and Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson. To
them and the rest of the council, a sincere vote
of thanks from the students.
They saw the problem and attacked it with
a vengeance. It is too bad that San Francisco
could not have done the same. We hereby
extend to Mayor Rossi a cordial invitation to
drop down to the Farm and take Stanford's so
lution for air raid defense as a general miniature
working model. It would be as valuable an
experience, we are sure, as the same time spent
in making foolish statements to the San Fran
cisco press.
