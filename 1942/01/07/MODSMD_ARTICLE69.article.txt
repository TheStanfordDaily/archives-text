# To the Rushee:
## 
### 
FRESHMEN and sophomore transfer men:
Last night you made your first visit to
Stanford fraternities in the initial open house
rush period of the year. Many of you have
associated previously with fraternity men in
athletics, campus activities and at rush parties
during Christmas vacation.
You may know definitely already which fra
ternity you would like to join. Or you may
think you know. Frankly, it seems rather im
probable that you can be sure after only one
visit to the houses.
The point is this. It was rumored last night
that some of you have accepted pledge pins
which have been offered so far by at least one
and possibly three fraternities. That perhaps
seems okay, but can you be sure you want to
join that fraternity? Sure, you may want to give
that pin back and accept one from some other
house later in the season.
There s the catch. Legally, you have every
right to do so. But, if a house likes you well
enough to pledge you, the pressure will be on
to keep you pledged. It's not easy to return that
pledge button to potential brothers. You'll find
there are a million reasons the fraternity man
can advance why you should not return that
pin. Not even a varsity debater can equal a
rush chairman in the fine art of bombast and
in leveling a barrage of bull.
We do not question their sincerity in many
instances —they may seriously want you in their
house and that will be all the more reason why
they earnestly will try to keep you pinned. If
not pledged officially, you will be pledged psy
chologically. And it's a tough job to break that
unofficial pledge.
May we suggest you take the time to be sure
of a house hpfore you allow yourself to hp

pinned? You will be respected lor acting
wisely.
There's also the thought that a house which
offers you a pin at such an early date as this
may be shaky—in quality of membership and,
sometimes even more important, financially.
Remember, "no pledge is binding until for
mal pledge day," Feb. 6.—Harold Shafer

offers you a pin at such an early date as this
may be shaky—in quality of membership and,
sometimes even more important, financially.

FRESHMEN and sophomore transfer men:
Last night you made your first visit to
Stanford fraternities in the initial open house
rush period of the year. Many of you have
associated previously with fraternity men in
athletics, campus activities and at rush parties
during Christmas vacation.
You may know definitely already which fra
ternity you would like to join. Or you may
think you know. Frankly, it seems rather im
probable that you can be sure after only one
visit to the houses.
The point is this. It was rumored last night
that some of you have accepted pledge pins
which have been offered so far by at least one
and possibly three fraternities. That perhaps
seems okay, but can you be sure you want to
join that fraternity? Sure, you may want to give
that pin back and accept one from some other
house later in the season.
There s the catch. Legally, you have every
right to do so. But, if a house likes you well
enough to pledge you, the pressure will be on
to keep you pledged. It's not easy to return that
pledge button to potential brothers. You'll find
there are a million reasons the fraternity man
can advance why you should not return that
pin. Not even a varsity debater can equal a
rush chairman in the fine art of bombast and
in leveling a barrage of bull.
We do not question their sincerity in many
instances —they may seriously want you in their
house and that will be all the more reason why
they earnestly will try to keep you pinned. If
not pledged officially, you will be pledged psy
chologically. And it's a tough job to break that
unofficial pledge.
May we suggest you take the time to be sure
of a house hpfore you allow yourself to hp

pinned? You will be respected lor acting
wisely.
There's also the thought that a house which
offers you a pin at such an early date as this
may be shaky—in quality of membership and,
sometimes even more important, financially.
