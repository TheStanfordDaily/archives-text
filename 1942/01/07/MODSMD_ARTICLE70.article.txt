EVERY once in a while at some A.S.S.U. elec
tion, there is a constitutional amendment to
be voted on by the entire student body. Nor
mally they don't mean very much to the voters.
They are usually long and many just stick a
check in the "Yes" square figuring that if it is
a question which has gone through the process
of being put on the ballot, it must be O.K.
There will be, as ruled by Ex Committee last
night, one of these constitutional amendments
on the winter quarter election ballot coming up
on Feb. 9.
The proposal to be voted on will embody
changes in our constitutional provisions for
election of student officers.
They are the first concrete proposals to be
passed by Ex Committee in an effort to clean
up our election system.
The change is not a radical one.
It will not mean primaries or departure from
the preferential system of voting, which seems
best suited to our needs.
It v/ill involve, however, a reduction of the
time consumed under the present system for
the whole election cycle—nominations, decli
nations, and actual balloting. This cycle now
takes eight full days. The new proposal, sanely
considered and heartily approved by Ex Com
mittee, v/ould cut the time consumed by this
cycle to three full days.
It has been agreed by Ex Committee and
students in general from time immemorial that
something should be done about caucuses and
their attendant evils. But, heretofore, nothing
had been accomplished because the caucus was
unofficial already and the legislators could not
touch it.
But, by eliminating five days in which the
caucuses had time to get in their work, the
end sought for years will be accomplished.
The end is not to eliminate caucuses. They
are a very essential and integral part of the
two-party democratic system as it has grown
up in this country.
The end is to eliminate the bad features of
caucus horse-trading which in so many cases
results in the best man not being nominated in
the final selection "because his house already
has one nominee, and we want to run so
and-so."
This system of nominations on Monday, decli
nations and introducing assembly on Tuesday,
and election on Wednesday will allow time for
a caucus but since the opposition will not be
known, the result achieved will be that the best
man will be nominated for each position.
This proposal will be explained and debated
much more fully before the Feb. 9 elections.
The essential factor is that everyone understand,
this time, why they will be putting a check in
one of two squares on that white piece of paper
come Feb. 9.
