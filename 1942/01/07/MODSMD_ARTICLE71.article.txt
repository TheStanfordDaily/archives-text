ADJUSTMENTS
STANFORD is now moving through its regular period
of readjustment for the new quarter. It is always
a period of mild confusion. There are so many little
matters that must he handled; new courses, new books
to buy, new professors to look at and listen to and
understand and new rooms to find. All these little
things have to be done before we can gradually slip
into our regular routine pattern of activity. In a
week or so. all we'll have to do is get out of bed,
and everything will take care of itself by habit. The
beginning of the quarter is always a period of confu
sion, but this year it is particularly disconcerting be
cause there is a war going on. and there are a lot of
new things that we'll have to get used to.
In the first place, half of the boys (I suppose we're
almost men now) half of the men aren't sure if they
even belong at school, or if they should be joining the
air corps or the naval reserve or the marines or some
thing to help the nation in the big light. This of course
helps to mix things up.
And then there are the air raids to get adjusted to.
They are liable to happen at any time and you should
know what to do. In case you haven't learned the six
big Blackout Rules, I'll repeat them for you:
One, turn off the light.
Two, keep calm.
Three, turn off the moon.
Four, shut the door.
Five, keep smiling.
Six, pick up sticks.
These, il you will memorize them, will keep you per
fectly safe and you will have nothing to fear.

then there are other changes like not being able
to study on the Quacl after (S p.m., girls having to
write down who they are going out with and where,
and dancing to phonographs instead of to big orches
tras and many other little things like that which will
take time to get accustomed to.
But probably the biggest change that the war has
caused, is the reduction in the number of men stu
dents. As it stands now. there are only a little less
than two men to every girl. In one of my classes yes
terday there were at least 50 girls, and only five, timid,
frightened boys. And before the class ended one of
the boys left. And the number of men students prom
ises to decrease even more in the coming few months,
now that the new draft bill has made all men over
20 years of age available for military service. And all
of this should produce a profound change in the atti
tudes of our Stanford women, and that will really be
something to become adjusted to.
And to top everything else, at the start of this
quarter the weather persists in having itself a cold
wave. If there is anything that is hard to do, it is
getting readjusted during a cold wave, especially
when von have n cold
