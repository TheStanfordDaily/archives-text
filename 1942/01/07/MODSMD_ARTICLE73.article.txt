AUSTIN. Tex., Jan. (i.—Before Pearl Harbor, many Student Opinion
Surveys of America polls had indicated collegians, although sympathetic
with the British and the Russians, were unmoved by any call to join
the embattled Europeans. Even more than the average American adult.
; students had failed to mobilize their spirit.

But the change that has come
about since the U.S. went to war is
staggering. New surveys completed
since hostilities in the Pacific began,
register the enormous effect the
Japanese attack has had on the un
dergraduate mind. These results
leave no doubt that college students
—long criticized for their peacetime
isolationist leanings—have immedi
ately united and are ready for the
personal sacrifices war will de
mand:
POLL RESULTS:
1. Most college men wcu!d have
i preferred to have the draft age
Icwercd to IS—affecting most of
them personally—than have it
raised to 45. and Congress last
month made men 20 to 41 subject
to military service.
2. Nearly nine in every ten are
willing to give some of their time
daily on local defense committees.
3. Almost as many want men
not in the armed forces drafted
fcr non-military duty.
4. More than three-fourths of
the co-eds approve of drafting
women for non-military tasks.
Here are the questions asked, and
! the percentages received in this sur
vey covering every section of the
United States, with, students of all
types proportionately represented:
"If the armed forces need more
men, would you rather have the draft
age for military service lowered to
18 or raised to 45?"
