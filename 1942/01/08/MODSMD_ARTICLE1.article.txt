### AMIE REICHERT 
British troops are fight
ing two battles today in the
jungles of Malaya. The Imperials,
outnumbered by the Japanese five
to-one, are fighting the Battle of
Time, and the first phases of the
Battle of Singapore.
The situation last night was cru
cial. There was little news of the
fighting on the east coast of the
Malayan peninsula, but it was as
sumed that the British are in se
rious trouble there as well as on
the west coast, where the invaders
pushed on relentlessly wtih arm
ored divisions and a powerful air
arm.
Time was all the Imperials asked.
Time for the gigantic British naval
stronghold to gird itself for the on
coming attack, time for the Allied
forces—British, Indian, and Chinese
—under General Wavell to launch
an attack on the invaders from
Burma in order to relieve the hard
pressed 'Malayan peninsula.

YV/IIETHER such a blow was pos
sible was the big question last
night. Has Wavell enough equip
ment and enough of an army to har
rass the Japanese suffiicently from
the rear so that they will be stalled
in their assault on Singapore?
No one knows. Information of
that sort is a military secret, and
even conjecture is not permittee'. In
the light of today's developments, it
becomes increasingly clear why
Wavell was sent to the Far East
from Libya.
Wavell's job in the Far East to
day is a big one, perhaps the big
gest in the present Allied strategy.
Singapore, (he last and greatest of
Allied strongholds in the Pacific,
is gravely imperiled, and will,
within the next week probably, be
fighting for her life. The oidy
possible offensive action the Brit
ish could take at this time would
be through Burma into Japanese
held Thailand, where they could
rupture the enemy's land com
munications.
But this is only half the job.
Wavell also has to see to it that
China's vital arterial, the Burma
Itoad, is kept open. lie cannot
therefore draw off too many of his
men to launch the southward move
lest the Japanese take advantage
of the unprotected area to attack
from Indo-China.
Latest reports indicate that Chi
nese troops are pouring into Burma
in order to defend the strategic
highway, and are also massing on
the border of the Yunan province in
southern China. If these forces are
strong enough, they might be able
to guard that area while Wavell
makes the desperate southward
drive.

makes the situation espe
cially grave for Singapore today
is that the Japanese have undoubted
aerial superiority over the ABCD
powers. The crucial need is for
fighter planes, and apparently the
distances are too great for signifi
cant air reinforcements to get
there to turn the tide.
Singapore could probably be
held indefinitely and the attack
turned back upon the invaders, if
we bad the planes to do the job.
As it is, we must start considering
just what the loss of Singapore
would mean to the Allies. This is a
possibility which is likely to become
an actuality in the very near future.

loss of Singapore would un
questionably be a body blow to
the Allies .and would probably push
the final victory date up one, two,
possibly three years. This, at least, is
the opinion of the so-called "ex
perts."
It is clearly a fairly logical
opinion, and one which must be
faced realistically. If the Japa
nese fell heir to Singapore it
would give them virtually un
questioned domination of East
Asia, and would set them up for a
comparatively simple attack on the
rich Dutch Indies. With the oil.
mineral, rubber, and food re
sources of the East Indies, the
Japanese could fatten up for a
long war, and thereby render the
blockade and economic strangle
hold of the AISCI) powers com
pletely useless.
