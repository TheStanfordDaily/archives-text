# Stanford Men Join U.S. In World War II
## 
### 
In the army, navy, or marines, in
every position from officer down to
the ordinary college draftee, Stan
ford men are playing their parts in
the nation's war program.
Remembering the days when they
studied instead of fought for the
"winds of freedom," hundreds of
former students have changed the j
cardinal for the khaki or navy blue
and x'eports of their success in the
adjustment are constantly brought
back from military camps.
While the air corps seems by far
to be the desire of most Stanford
enlistees, in every branch of the
service from duty on submarines to
signal corps service, in the infantry,
artillery, or cavalry, on the bridge
or in a hangar, the campus is fit
tingly represented.
Public relations counsels of the
army and navy have reported to
The Daily during the past few weeks
on the activities and advancements
of many Stanford graduates.
John Kerman, former Card grid
der, recently received his second
lieutenant's commission in the ma- |
rine corps from Secretary of the
Navy Knox.
