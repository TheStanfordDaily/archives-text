# '42 Rushing For Women Starts Today
## Simplicity Keynotes New Pan Hell Rules For Sorority Pledging 
### 
1942's crop of. sorority rushees step
on the treadmill of formal rushing
tonight when they attend the first
series of dinners given in their honor
by Stanford's nine sororities.
Tonight's dinners held from G to 8
will be marked by simplicity as will
the other rushing functions, Pan-
Hellenic Council announced. Street
clothes will be worn throughout the
first period of rushing, which con
sists of four dinners, according to
Barbara Rapp, Pan-Hell president.
In the second period, she added,
rushees will wear the same type of
clothes while sorority women will
don dinner dresses. During the third
and final period of rushing both
guests and hostesses are to wear
long dresses.
BIDS OBTAINED
Rushees obtained their bids for
tonight's festivities at the offices of
Pan-Hellenic Council yesterday be
tween 1 and 5, the Council president
stated. These bids, answered by the
rushees in standard form, were re
turned to the Council office before
10 last nieht.
Pan Hellenic working in co-opera
tion with the administration has de
vised a plan of action in the event
there are air raid warnings during
rushing, Miss Rapp announced. The
moment the siren sounds each soror
ity will ask the rushees they are en
tertaining to return to their living
groups accompanied by two hashers
from the house. Also a list of the
rushees being entertained each night
is to be prepared by the sororities
and handed in to Pan-Hellenic Coun
cil prior to the time of the rushing
function, she added.
SYSTEM CHANGED
The rushing system devised for
this year contains several changes
from the system in operation last
year, according to sorority officials.
This year exchange of invitations
and rushing bids, will take place
through the offices of the Pan-Hel
lenic Council president in the Wom
en's Clubhouse. Also the rushing
functions will consist entirely of din
ners.
At the end of an intensive ten days
of dinner parties a part of 1942's
crop of rushees will become 1942's
pledges on the fateful night of Jan
uary 17, when the sorority bids are
released.
