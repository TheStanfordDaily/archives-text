# War to Cut Into Normal Social Life
## Jackson Condemns Waste of Funds At Defense Meeting 
### 
More than 125 campus leaders lust
night heard A.S.S.U. President
George Jackson explain Tuesday
night's actions of Ex Committee re
garding campus social changes
brought about by the war emer
gency.
Approval of most of the measures
was registered by a majority of the
group after discussion.
The one recommendation for
change was made wltTi regard to big
name bands. It was urged that no
definite ruling be made until after
the Senior Prom with Tommy Dor
sey and his band.
Jackson pleaded for "good taste"
and said "big name bunds" consti
tuted an unwarranted expense. If
we've got $1500 lying around the
campus, we should put it into de
fense bonds or stamps, not give it to
a band," concluded Jackson.
DISAGREEMENT
Spirited disagreement arose from
all parts of the group as some stu
dents contended they were being
asked to sacrifice needlessly by giv
ing up "big name band" dances.
Jack Randall, president of Inter
club Council, asserted "we shouldn't
curtail social activities immediately
but if the United States is bombed,
then we could modify social life at
once. After all, he concluded,
"who's going to stay here if you take
all our privileges away?"
MOTION PASSED
After much dispute, a motion to
use the Senior Prom's presentation
of Tommy Dorsey as a barometer
for future discussion was unani
mously passed.
A.S.S.U. vice-president Pat Ad
ams asked for a true interpretation
of Dr. Wilbur's reference to "nor
malcy during the emergency."
"Our life isn't the same, for we
are at war," she said. "And we
! should adhere to public opinion and
requests of our parents that social
life be modified for safety's sake."
DECISION SUPPORTED
Ex Committee's decision to center
social life on the campus received
the support of the group. Under this
new ruling no campus organization
can hold any social function off the
campus.
Rosemarie Mullany, chairman of
Women's Council, explained the new
sign-out rulings * affecting all girls
who go off campus and all girls with
late leaves. These rulings are:
RULINGS:
1. Women must record their des
tination when going off campus be
tween the hours of 6:30 to 10:30 p.m.
2. Women taking 2:30 a.m. late
leaves must record their destination,
and emergency address, in case a
blackout should prevent them from
returning by 2:30 a.m.
These new rulings will not go into
efTect until official announcement by
Women's Council is made some time
next week.
"No change in the present system
of late leave privileges will be
made immediately," said Rosemarie
Mullany, "as such a change might be
harmful to general morale on the
campus."
Jackson also anouneed the forma
tion of a Student Defense Council to
co-operate with the Stanford Civilian
Defense Committee.
