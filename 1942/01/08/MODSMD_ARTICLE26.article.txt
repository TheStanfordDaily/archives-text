# Military Purposes Divert Texas Oil
## 
### 
AUSTIN, Tex., Jan .7 (UP).â€”The
crude output of 63 Texas oil fields
was ordered tonight to be turned
over exclusively to production for
military purposes.
The Texas Railroad Commission,
state oil regulatory body, ordered
the fields designated as "for military
use only" and directed that their
output be allocated entirely to that
purpose.
