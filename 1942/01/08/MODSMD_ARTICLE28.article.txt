# Dancers Sponsor Camera Exhibit
## 
### 
As a preliminary to their concert
to be given on Jan. 20, members of
Orchesis are sponsoring an exhibit,
of Barbara Morgan's photographs of
well-known dance artists, including
Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey
and Charles Weidman, and their
groups, in the Memorial Theater
from Wednesday, Jan. 7, to Wednes
day, Jan. 12.

According to Miss Margaret Jew
ell, director of dance, Miss Morgan's
work is noted for capturing the emo
tion, meaning, and form of a subject
in motion. Each picture arrests time
and movement and captures the
dance at its visual peak.

Of special interest are the photo
graphs of Martha Graham, whose
compositions can find no rivals for
spirit, dramatic intensity and imagi
nation, says Miss Jewell. Pictures
from Miss Morgan's recently pub
lished book on this artist are in
cluded in the exhibit, besides many
others as yet unpublished.

"Much tongue and much judgment
are seldom together."
