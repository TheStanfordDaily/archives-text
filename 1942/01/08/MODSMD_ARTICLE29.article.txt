# Corp Yard, War Libe Sirens To Warn Farm of Air Raids
## 
### JIM WUENSCHEL 
A fluctuating blast on the siren for approximately two minutes . . .
Blackout! \
All this about two seconds after the operators on duty at the short
wave station in the Corp Yard have intercepted the warning radioed by

the San Francisco main station.
Almost as soon as the Stanford
station gets word of the enemy planes
in the offing, the confirming; order
comes through from the Palo Alto
station and the siren switches are
thrown on by one of the operators,
while the other phones each of the
eight air raid warden centers on the
campus.
Operating on DC current, the two
Stanford air raid sirens are located
on the 14th story of the Hoover Li
brary and on top of the Corporation
Yard office building. The sirens
were manufactured by a firm in
San Jose.
The siren on the roof of the Corpo
ration Building has a two horsepower
motor, while the one on the Library
operates on a three horse-power mo-
I tor. The one on the Corporation
Building is equipped to run regard
less of power failure on the campus.
All classroom bells are now tied in
with the sirens and are operated on
the same switch, fluctuating their
tones in cadence with the sirens. A
single handle on the control boxes
worked up and down by operator at
two-second intervals grinds out. the
terrifying tones.
Precariously perched up on the
Corp office roof, the siren is painted
a bright red. To be reached, it is
necessary to climb several ladders.
On closer inspection, the siren was
found to be composed of several
horns on top of the generator.
One of the Corporation Yard men
said, ''All it does is take the air in
and chop it up a little and blow it
j out again." But the change that has
I taken place in the air!
