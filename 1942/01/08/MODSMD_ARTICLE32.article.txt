Cellars may be bomb proof, bul
even the Stanford Cellar is not na
tional defense proof, students learn
ed this week when they walked into
[ the cellar for a drink.
Ha, ha, they said at first as they
! saw the sign on the counter, "Lack of
! glasses; please drink out of bottles."
| Another one of those Cellar jokes,
i This will make campus opinion ma
terial.
But it was no joke for the young
man who ordered a pint of milk and
had to feed directly from the bottle
—he who had never done such a
thing ever since he was a baby.
But it was somewhat consoling to
see others doing the same thing, and
| even girls trying to run coke down
j the throat without swallowing the
I bottle.
"It's just a part of national de
: fense," explained Miss Christine
I P»icker, director of the university
| dining halls.
