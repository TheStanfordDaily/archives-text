# Visions of P.C.C. Crown Seen During Card Hoop Practice
## 
### 
We actually got tired watching Everett Dean's basketball team yester
day in the Pavilion, so frequently did the boys drop the ball through the
bucket. !l was a gentle, swishing sound, and conjured up visions of PCC
victories in the offing. «•
All the first-stringers save Ed Voss were on hand. Voss is in the Rest

Home, but will be ready to go to
morrow night against College of the
Pacific, if Dean starts his top squad.
Yesterday John Eikleman stood in
for Voss with Jimmy Pollard, Howie
Dallmar, Don Burness, and Bill
Cowden.
Fred Linari and Larry Dee are the
Iwo scrappiest guys that ever lived
on floor as evidenced from their play
yesterday. Against the first team,
which averaged 6-3, the Linari-Dee
duo worked the ball around like
lightning and got into every tie ball
that came up.
As to tomorrow's tussle, Pacific
hasn't won a game from Stanford
since Coach Ralph Francis of the
Tigers took over the reins at the
Stockton school, but Pacific's quintet
has already rolled up 218 points this
season, winning four and dropping
fine.
MEN IN MOTION
Francis features what he calls
"continuity basketball." It calls for
five men in motion on the offensive
with all men becoming potential
basket shooters as their actual play
ing positions rotate in the continuity
of the attack.
This is nothing new to Stanford's
type of play, since under Dean's of
fense system any man may take a
shot, and shooting is not limited to
any particular positions.
Francis has a small but veteran
squad for his '41 debut here. The
starting line-up finds Ken Rogers
and Clare Slaughter at the forwards,
Joe Johns and Bob Monogan at the
guards, and Bob Nikkei at center.
The Tigers' starting team averages
6-1, but Jack Toomey, sub center, is
up in there at 6-5, while George
Miller, lan Hutcheon, and John
Camicia, sub forwards, are the
shortest men on the squad at 5-9.
NIKKEL TOP MAN
Nikkei, 6-3, is one of the classiest
tossers on the Stockton quint. He is
the leading scorer to date and exe
cutes his favorite shot from under
the basket with amazing quickness.
Monogan, 6-2, a senior veteran, is
president of the Pacific student
body association, and one of the
flossiest basketball players the
Tigers have ever claimed. A very
clover ball handler, dribbler and
passer, he holds up a much better
than average scoring record.
Johns, 5-11, appears to be the
strongest defensive man on the club.

the leading scorer to date and exe
cutes his favorite shot from under
the basket with amazing quickness.
Monogan, 6-2, a senior veteran, is
president of the Pacific student
body association, and one of the
flossiest basketball players the
Tigers have ever claimed. A very
clover ball handler, dribbler and
passer, he holds up a much better
than average scoring record.
Johns, 5-11, appears to be the
strongest defensive man on the club.
We actually got tired watching Everett Dean's basketball team yester
day in the Pavilion, so frequently did the boys drop the ball through the
bucket. !l was a gentle, swishing sound, and conjured up visions of PCC
victories in the offing. «•
All the first-stringers save Ed Voss were on hand. Voss is in the Rest

Home, but will be ready to go to
morrow night against College of the
Pacific, if Dean starts his top squad.
Yesterday John Eikleman stood in
for Voss with Jimmy Pollard, Howie
Dallmar, Don Burness, and Bill
Cowden.
Fred Linari and Larry Dee are the
Iwo scrappiest guys that ever lived
on floor as evidenced from their play
yesterday. Against the first team,
which averaged 6-3, the Linari-Dee
duo worked the ball around like
lightning and got into every tie ball
that came up.
As to tomorrow's tussle, Pacific
hasn't won a game from Stanford
since Coach Ralph Francis of the
Tigers took over the reins at the
Stockton school, but Pacific's quintet
has already rolled up 218 points this
season, winning four and dropping
fine.
MEN IN MOTION
Francis features what he calls
"continuity basketball." It calls for
five men in motion on the offensive
with all men becoming potential
basket shooters as their actual play
ing positions rotate in the continuity
of the attack.
This is nothing new to Stanford's
type of play, since under Dean's of
fense system any man may take a
shot, and shooting is not limited to
any particular positions.
Francis has a small but veteran
squad for his '41 debut here. The
starting line-up finds Ken Rogers
and Clare Slaughter at the forwards,
Joe Johns and Bob Monogan at the
guards, and Bob Nikkei at center.
The Tigers' starting team averages
6-1, but Jack Toomey, sub center, is
up in there at 6-5, while George
Miller, lan Hutcheon, and John
Camicia, sub forwards, are the
shortest men on the squad at 5-9.
NIKKEL TOP MAN
Nikkei, 6-3, is one of the classiest
tossers on the Stockton quint. He is
the leading scorer to date and exe
cutes his favorite shot from under
the basket with amazing quickness.
