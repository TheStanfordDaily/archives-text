# Writer Laments Bowl Predictions

NEW YORK, Jan. 7 (UP).—Foot
ball has ended but the memory lin
gers on—especially the memory of
having picked five losers in the six
bowl games over the New Year's
week-end. But since we're on the
subject of picking bowl winners, I
might as well let you in on how it's
done in New Orleans on New Year's
eve.
Before the Rose Bowl game the
dope on Duke was that Wallace
Wade had had his boys working all
week against George McAfee's left
handed passes and would be more
than ready for Oregon tSate's south
paw aerial attack. But the dope
didn't say that Oregon State would
bring its own weather — rain and
slick going—with it.
