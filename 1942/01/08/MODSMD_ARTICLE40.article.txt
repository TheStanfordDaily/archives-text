J>OST-RECESS grumblings . . . It's nice that the seats at the Pavilion
are raised from the court. If they weren't, many stiff necks would
result in the ensuing few months from watching Ed Voss, Jim Pollard,
Howie Dallmar, Don Burness, and Bill Cowden maneuver the basketball
around in the substratosphere. . . . Hugh "The man who gets the starting
call over the National pro football league's best running back at halfback
for the Chi Bears" Gallarneau is back on the Farm for a spell after com
pleting a very successful frosh year in the no-pay, no-play circles. ... I
wonder if the Mole has dug his way out of the pokey yet. Pokey is shop
talk for a place of criminal detention. . . . Clem Tomerlin, end on the
'40 T, according to rumor is now attending Santa Barbara State Teachers
College, the real country club college. He refrained from re-entering
L.S.J.U. last fall quarter since Mr. Atherton had politely informed him
that he had no more varsity football eligibility left. It seems that Tomer
lin did not play ball his first year at junior college, but did play the next
two years for the Pasadena school, thereby using up his sophomore and
junior years of eligibility. One year here and he was through, so sayeth
Uncle Edwin. Of course he still had a year of frosh ball left, but since he
already participated in varsity games that too was out of the question.
Alter unselectively-servicing himself due to color-blindness, Clem located
himself at S.B. with TWO years of eligibility left. The Gaucho league, the
C.C.A.A., has a rule that only one year's playing can be used at a jaysee.
That year, plus one here still leaves two seasons down thar. Do you
follow me?

IT SEEMS good to get back to the asterisks. During the Sugar Bowl
festival in New Orleans, Ted Schroeder, senior netman, overcame a
five-foot, two-fisted, Ecuadorean slugger named Francisco "Pancho" Se
gura to win the sportfest's tennis tourney. Ted in his usual manner
dropped the first two sets before settling down to his task at hand. Some
day ho might dawdle away three sets before going to work. That would
be sad.
Coach John "Legguv" Lamb lost one of his better tennismen when
Jack Gurley, the Sacramento terror, did not return to school this quarter,
preferring a job at Hamilton Field. Due apologies to you, Mr. Lamb, for
that home-made nickname.

jl/IY NOMINATION for the good sport of the year 1941: Lieut. General
Ben Lear for not letting all the publicity he got for chastizing his
'yoo-hoo" soldiers go to his head. It hardly seems time for more asterisks,
but I can't think of anything else to say regarding Gen. Lear so here goes.

A S THIS opus is being impressed orf a sheet of copy paper by the keys
of Underwood Portable typewriter number G733441, it is nice weather
for ducks. Speaking of ducks, I wonder how many of next years varsity
gridders wont' be able to duck a steady job with the government in the
next few months, or is that unpatriotic?
Here's an item that has absolutely nothing to do with ducks. Guess who
the last man to enter last Sunday's pro bowl game wr.s? None other than
Hampton Pool, former quarterback, fullback, guard under Tiny Thornhill.
who used to coach the football teams at this school. Hamp now desports
himself as an end.

if the Card hoop team can get by the Trojans, Bears, and Bruins
in the coming southern division race, they will meet rugged compe
tition in the northern winner, either Washington or Oregon State, both of
whom appear to beat last winter's almost national champion Washington
Staters. The Huskies went undefeated in their recent tour of the East.
On their way they set a new scoring record in Gotham's Garden against
the Violets of N.Y.U. Maybe they were shrinking violets and they shrank
at Ihe wrong times, on rebounds, etc. The Beaver basketeers, with all five
of their starting team last year returning, hope to follow the path of glory
trod by their pigskin brethren.
The end.
