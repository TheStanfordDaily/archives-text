# Joe Louis, Baer Finish Training
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 7 (UP). â€”Joe
Louis and big Buddy Baer completed
training today for Friday night's
! heavyweight title fight, both pack
-1 ing peak weight and both predicting
an early knockout.
Champion Louis, at his Green
wood Lake, N.Y., camp, predicted
that he would belt out Buddy in
faster time than the six rounds re
quired in their first bout at Wash
ington, D.C., May 23.
Giant Buddy, at Lakewood, N.J.,
declared, "I'll knock him out within
five rounds, this time. I almost put
him away in the first round at Wash
ington, but I was so surprised when
he went through the ropes I stood
| back and gave him a chance to re
cuperate, instead of finishing him."
Louis wound up with four rounds
of sparring and, although coasting
under trainer Jack Blackburn's in
structions, gashed Dee Amos' lower
lip so badly with a sharp right up
percut that his sparmate was hur
ried to the first-aid room. He again
concentrated on bobbing and weav
ing.
