# Coaches Shape Frosh Quintet
## 
### 
Building around a trio of fast
breaking forwards and several
smooth ball-handlers at the guard
and forward positions, Coaches Phil
Bengston and Woodie Weir are rap
idly shaping another first class frosh
basketball quint for their opening
tilt against Piedmont High Friday
night.
Sparked particularly by the quick
breaks and speed of forward Fred
Parsons, last night's practice scrim
mage was used to polish set-up strat
egy and to plan offensive strategy.
At the other forward spot Dave
Brown and Bob Barsocchini are
about a toss-up choice for the start
ing spot Friday, with a bevy of
guards including Fred Ferroggiaro,
Dave Pate, Bob Hall, Bob Hagopian,
and others due to see action.
PIVOT MKN LABOR
At the pivot spot Jack Heald and
Johnny Hartwell have been doing
the heaviest labor in the practice
sessions.
The Class of '45 squad is working
on a screen offense that springs the
forwards for one-handed push shots
from the corners and on fast-break
set-up plays, again utilizing the
burning speed of some of their for
wards, especially Parsons who used
his lightning abilities to good advan
tage for the frosh grid team this fall.
The new Farm mentor, Woodie
Weir, seems to think that the fresh
men are working into a "pretty fair
ball club," which is just what they
will have to be to equal the records
of former years' teams.
PAST RECORD GOOD
Last season Jim Pollard captained
the yearlings to a 16 win-2 loss sea
son, the latter to George Washington
High and the Cal freshmen. In 1940
the Papeese won 15 and dropped 2,
again to the Cal frosh and to Menlo
J. C.
In the year before that Bill Cow
den led another sterling beginners'
quint to a 12-straight winning
streak; Lowell High of San Francisco
and the ever-present Cal frosh win
ning one each to mar a perfect year.

night.
Sparked particularly by the quick
breaks and speed of forward Fred
Parsons, last night's practice scrim
mage was used to polish set-up strat
egy and to plan offensive strategy.
At the other forward spot Dave
Brown and Bob Barsocchini are
about a toss-up choice for the start
ing spot Friday, with a bevy of
guards including Fred Ferroggiaro,
Dave Pate, Bob Hall, Bob Hagopian,
and others due to see action.
PIVOT MKN LABOR
At the pivot spot Jack Heald and
Johnny Hartwell have been doing
the heaviest labor in the practice
sessions.
The Class of '45 squad is working
on a screen offense that springs the
forwards for one-handed push shots
from the corners and on fast-break
set-up plays, again utilizing the
burning speed of some of their for
wards, especially Parsons who used
his lightning abilities to good advan
tage for the frosh grid team this fall.
The new Farm mentor, Woodie
Weir, seems to think that the fresh
men are working into a "pretty fair
ball club," which is just what they
will have to be to equal the records
of former years' teams.
PAST RECORD GOOD
Last season Jim Pollard captained
the yearlings to a 16 win-2 loss sea
son, the latter to George Washington
High and the Cal freshmen. In 1940
the Papeese won 15 and dropped 2,
again to the Cal frosh and to Menlo
J. C.
In the year before that Bill Cow
den led another sterling beginners'
quint to a 12-straight winning
streak; Lowell High of San Francisco
and the ever-present Cal frosh win
ning one each to mar a perfect year.
Building around a trio of fast
breaking forwards and several
smooth ball-handlers at the guard
and forward positions, Coaches Phil
Bengston and Woodie Weir are rap
idly shaping another first class frosh
basketball quint for their opening
tilt against Piedmont High Friday
night.
