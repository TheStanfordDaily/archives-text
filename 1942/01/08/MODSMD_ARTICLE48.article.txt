# Men in Uniform

### 
WAR has brought about a drastic and far
reaching change in the lives of most of
the men who are now serving in the armed
forces of the United States.
And every day more and more young men
are leaving their normal pursuits to take ac
tive part in the defense of their country. Many
others are serving eguaily well in the plants
producing war supplies for America and the
other allies.
A large number of Stanford men are engaged
in all branches of the service. The Daily prints
today on page 1 a partial list of Stanford men,
what they are doing, where they are, what
branch of service they are in.
We realize that our facilities for gathering this
information are limited. Army and navy pub
lic relations offices are overburdened. We are
certain that this list is far from complete. As
a service to Stanford, we would like to be able
to publish a full list of Stanford men in the
service, as well as those working in defense
plants.
If fraternities, eating clubs, relatives, and all
other students having definite information on
former Stanford men—women, too, for that
matter—whose names should appear in such a
round-up would let us have this information,
we will publish the entire list in the near fu
ture.
It is impossible in many cases to reveal defi
nitely the precise location, but we would ap
preciate as complete information as possible.
A complete report would include the fol
lowing:
Name, class, campus affiliation, branch of
service, rank, location (as close as possible or
where last heard from); if in a defense indus
try, name of company, location, and type of
work.
Don't hesitate if you haven't all of these. Give
us all you know. Just drop us a letter or post
card.
