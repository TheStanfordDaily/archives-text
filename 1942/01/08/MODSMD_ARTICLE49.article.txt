THE shriek of the air raid siren rends the air.
Lights out. Roar of powerful engines power
ing winged machines of destruction is heard
approaching from the west. Bombers thunder
over Stanford. And hell breaks loose. Bombs
smash into campus buildings.
Not a horror story by H. G. Wells or Orson
Welles, the possibility of a Japanese air raid is
not beyond conception. True, the enemy is not
intentionally going to waste valuable tons of
bombs on Stanford when there are so many
objectives vital to our defense effort within a
few miles of the campus.
However, who can predict what will happen
in this war-maddened world? Permanente, the
huge magnesium-producing plant near Los
Altos, is a most logical target for enemy bombs;
as is Moffett Field. Is it beyond belief that
a Japanese bombardier should mistake Stanford
for Permanente? Or a Japanese bomber on de
fense could loose its .load in an attempt to
escape. Or—well, any of a million things could
occur.
The purpose of this is not to spread fear; it
is to answer the undercurrents of grumbling
resulting from Stanford's defense preparations.
"Why can't we study on the Quad at night?
What difference will it make?"
In the past, students have left lights burning
in Quad rooms all night when they've finished
studying. In event of an air raid, there is no
method of darkening the Quad without pulling
the master switch, and this is impossible be
cause of important experiments and research
dependent upon 24-hour current.
"Why go to such stupid extremes as to place
buckets oi sand in living groups?"

This is just one of the many essential precau
tions against fires from incendiary bombs. The
cost is slight and little if any discomfort results
from such minor precautions.
Is it not better to be fully prepared for any
eventuality, no matter how distant, than to be
confused as is San Francisco today or perhaps
regret the lack of preparation after a disaster? —
