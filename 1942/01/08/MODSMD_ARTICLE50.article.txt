# "The Inside Track"
## 
### 
SO-CALLED "war commentators" are a dime
a dozen these days.
Most of them get only the same news that
you or I get. Then they comment on it, "inter
pret" it, make conjectures and predictions
on it. Some are no more qualified than you or I
to do this to the news. They have a radio or
newspaper deadline to meet, and they meet it
each day whether or not they have anything
really worth saying.
There are a few, however, who truly "know
whereof they speak."
One of these latter is a man who for the past
25 years has been gathering at first hand the
material which qualifies him to speak today
with authority on the present war, particularly
its latest phaseâ€”the Pacific.
That man is coming to Stanford to do a little
high-class interpreting, explaining, and discuss
ing of the topic "When East Meets West in
Battle."
That man is Walter Duranty.
He is famed as foreign correspondent, author,
and lecturer.
He spent thirteen years in Russia watching
the Communist state develop. He just barely
got out of Japan before they kicked the slats
out of their cradle and decided to take on Brit
ain and America. His last four years have been
spent in constant travel throughout Europe and
Asia.
He is one man who can give us something
really solid to grind through the mill of con
stant bull sessions on "the war."
He will put Stanford on the "inside track"
next Wednesday in Memorial Theater.
