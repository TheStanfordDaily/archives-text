### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
RUSHING
VF/HEN I was a sophomore in high school, there used
to be a girl living next dor to us. She was a very
nice girl, rather pretty, fairly intelligent, she received
good marks in high school, and in the fall of that year
she decided to go to college. She bought all sorts of
dresses and coats and hats, and a binder and left for
college. It was only about a month later that she
came back. I noticed that she was continually grum
bling and nervous and seemed unhappy although she
didn't look sick. One day I was talking to her and
after a whil I asked her why she had quit college. At
first she made various little excuses but then she con
fessed that she had quit school because she hadn't
made a sorority. At that time I don't think I knew
what a sorority was so that I couldn't understand
why she had quit school. But I supposed that it was
something very important. And I remember always
feeling sorry for this girl because all she ever did
after she left college was sit around th house and
read magazines, eat candy, and go to shows and dances.
And about a year later, I would say from sheer bore
dom, she married a young man who worked in a
garage, a young man with whom she had gone to high
school. I remember not ever liking the marriage and
always blaming it on her not making a sorority, and so
on coming here 1 decided to find out what it was all
about.

I PERSONALLY haven't anything against sororities
' and would have joined one myself but for the fact
that at the last minute one of the girls found a clause
in their charter which said that it was against the
law to have men in sororities. So as I say, I don't
think there is anything wrong with sororities. But
what I do think wrong is the distorted amount of
importance the women, and many of the men, place
on making a house. Asking and listening around this
school for the past two years, I've found out that fra
ternities and sororities are the most important aspect
of college life for more than a small number of stu
dents. Success or failure in college depends on noth
ing more than making a house. And so if they don't
make a house, many a student suffers a severe, and
very unreasonable .slap in the face right at the begin
ning of his college career, and often the student either
quits school or spends the rest of his years in moping
around rind arguing with everyone about how terrible
fraternities and sororities are.

We are now going through rushing at Stanford.
Boys and girls, don't get hysterical. It isn't that im
portant. If you want to make a house, more than
likely you will. If you don't, you are not all through.
There are still many good reasons for living. There
are other good things at Stanford besides the houses.
Stick around and learn something while you've got
the chance to learn, and it doesn't make much differ
ence where you live as long as it is warm—especially if
you have a cold.

on making a house. Asking and listening around this
school for the past two years, I've found out that fra
ternities and sororities are the most important aspect
of college life for more than a small number of stu
dents. Success or failure in college depends on noth
ing more than making a house. And so if they don't
make a house, many a student suffers a severe, and
very unreasonable .slap in the face right at the begin
ning of his college career, and often the student either
quits school or spends the rest of his years in moping
around rind arguing with everyone about how terrible
fraternities and sororities are.

We are now going through rushing at Stanford.
Boys and girls, don't get hysterical. It isn't that im
portant. If you want to make a house, more than
likely you will. If you don't, you are not all through.
There are still many good reasons for living. There
are other good things at Stanford besides the houses.
Stick around and learn something while you've got
the chance to learn, and it doesn't make much differ
ence where you live as long as it is warm—especially if
you have a cold.

VF/HEN I was a sophomore in high school, there used
to be a girl living next dor to us. She was a very
nice girl, rather pretty, fairly intelligent, she received
good marks in high school, and in the fall of that year
she decided to go to college. She bought all sorts of
dresses and coats and hats, and a binder and left for
college. It was only about a month later that she
came back. I noticed that she was continually grum
bling and nervous and seemed unhappy although she
didn't look sick. One day I was talking to her and
after a whil I asked her why she had quit college. At
first she made various little excuses but then she con
fessed that she had quit school because she hadn't
made a sorority. At that time I don't think I knew
what a sorority was so that I couldn't understand
why she had quit school. But I supposed that it was
something very important. And I remember always
feeling sorry for this girl because all she ever did
after she left college was sit around th house and
read magazines, eat candy, and go to shows and dances.
And about a year later, I would say from sheer bore
dom, she married a young man who worked in a
garage, a young man with whom she had gone to high
school. I remember not ever liking the marriage and
always blaming it on her not making a sorority, and so
on coming here 1 decided to find out what it was all
about.

I PERSONALLY haven't anything against sororities
' and would have joined one myself but for the fact
that at the last minute one of the girls found a clause
in their charter which said that it was against the
law to have men in sororities. So as I say, I don't
think there is anything wrong with sororities. But
what I do think wrong is the distorted amount of
importance the women, and many of the men, place
on making a house. Asking and listening around this
school for the past two years, I've found out that fra
