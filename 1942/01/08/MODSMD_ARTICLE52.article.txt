## PLEA FOR TOLERANCE 
### 
r THE EDITOR. SIR:
I was glad to see the editorial entitled "Peace—
Now's the Time" in this morning's Daily. My purpose
in writing this letter is the statement below:
"The United States is at war with Japan; these are
my sentiments concerning this war. (1) We can ac
knowledge our part of our world sins; one, for exam
ple. the Japanese Exclusion Acts. (2) We can live
above hate. (3) We can be especially kind to aliens.
(4) We can strengthen now the forces which make for
righteousness. A Laguna Beach minister, in a letter
to his congregation in the week of December 7, 1941,
said: 'As Christians we shall fight for our Faith and
the Faith of the world; we will do this more effectively
if we remember that we are commanded always to
hate EVIL, but are quite explicitly forbidden to hate
MEN.' Ponder these words of Harry Emerson Fosdick,
minister of the Riverside Church in New York City: 'It
makes little difference who wins the War unless
Christ wins the peace.'"
Thank you for reading this letter.
Yours very truly,
Tyrus Harmsen
