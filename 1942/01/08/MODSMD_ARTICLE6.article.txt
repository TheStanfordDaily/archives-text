# Singapore Facing New Threat; Japs Claim Sea Battle Raging
## British Forces Check Nippon In Fierce Fight BULLETIN 
### 
CANBERRA, Jan. 7 (CP). —
Long-range Japanese Hying boats
blasted Rabaul Airdrome in Aus
tralian New Guinea for the fourth
time today as Dutch officials here
called on the Allies to immediately
"establish a line which the Japa
nese will be unable to cross" in
their southward push.

SINGAPORE, Jan. 7 (UP).— Japa
nese sea-borne forces were believed
tonight to be preparing for landing
attempts at Port Swettenbam. in the
vital Kuala Lumpur sector 200 miles
northwest, and at Mersing, only 75
miles northeast of Singapore.
Swarms of Japanese planes were
reported scouting the Port Swetten
ham area, 25 miles southwest of
Kuala Lumpur, capital of the fed
erated Malay States, presumably for
a landing attempt.
MERSING VULNERABLE
Mersing is the only important port
on the east coast between Kuantan,
which the Japanese seized earlier in
the week, and Singapore. It has a
wide stretch of flat sand which would
provide both an easy landing place
and a ready-made airbase for the
Japanese. British officials admitted
they were worried over the possibil
ity of landing attempt at Mersing,
although they believed any attempt
to land at Port Swettenham could be
beaten off.
In today's fighting British impe
rials, outnumbered five-to-one, held
Japanese invaders in check in fierce,
hand-to-hand battles in the Malayan
jungles, gaining valuable time for
the Allies to organize their counter
offensive to save Singapore.
JAP GAINS SLIGHT
A strong force of Japanese tanks
pierced the lower Perak River de
fense line some 260 miles north of
here at dawn today, but the Japa
nese did not pursue their advantage
and their gain was confined to one
small locality. No new Japanese
landings were attempted in the
Kuala Selangor sector, scene of their
most recent invasion efforts, and the
rest of the battle zone was compara
tively quiet.
The imperials were making a su
preme effort to hold a battle line
north of Kuala Lumpur and the sit
uation in western Malaya was re
ported improving. Japanese casual
ties mounted sharply, indicating an
increased fire power by the defend
ers, and possibly reinforcements,
front dispatches said.
CONDITIONS SERIOUS
There were no official reports
from the east coast sector but con
ditions there were believed serious.
(The Rome radio broadcast a
Tokyo dispatch saying that Japa
nese motorized troops had reached
the frontier of Johore Province,
which extends to within 15 miles of
Mersing and within 80 of Singapore.
It said the British were still re
treating.)

CONDITIONS SERIOUS
There were no official reports
from the east coast sector but con
ditions there were believed serious.
(The Rome radio broadcast a
Tokyo dispatch saying that Japa
nese motorized troops had reached
the frontier of Johore Province,
which extends to within 15 miles of
Mersing and within 80 of Singapore.

CANBERRA, Jan. 7 (CP). —
Long-range Japanese Hying boats
blasted Rabaul Airdrome in Aus
tralian New Guinea for the fourth
time today as Dutch officials here
called on the Allies to immediately
"establish a line which the Japa
nese will be unable to cross" in
their southward push.

SINGAPORE, Jan. 7 (UP).— Japa
nese sea-borne forces were believed
tonight to be preparing for landing
attempts at Port Swettenbam. in the
vital Kuala Lumpur sector 200 miles
northwest, and at Mersing, only 75
miles northeast of Singapore.
Swarms of Japanese planes were
reported scouting the Port Swetten
ham area, 25 miles southwest of
Kuala Lumpur, capital of the fed
erated Malay States, presumably for
a landing attempt.
MERSING VULNERABLE
Mersing is the only important port
on the east coast between Kuantan,
which the Japanese seized earlier in
the week, and Singapore. It has a
wide stretch of flat sand which would
provide both an easy landing place
and a ready-made airbase for the
Japanese. British officials admitted
they were worried over the possibil
ity of landing attempt at Mersing,
although they believed any attempt
to land at Port Swettenham could be
beaten off.
In today's fighting British impe
rials, outnumbered five-to-one, held
Japanese invaders in check in fierce,
hand-to-hand battles in the Malayan
jungles, gaining valuable time for
the Allies to organize their counter
offensive to save Singapore.
JAP GAINS SLIGHT
A strong force of Japanese tanks
pierced the lower Perak River de
fense line some 260 miles north of
here at dawn today, but the Japa
nese did not pursue their advantage
and their gain was confined to one
small locality. No new Japanese
landings were attempted in the
Kuala Selangor sector, scene of their
most recent invasion efforts, and the
rest of the battle zone was compara
tively quiet.
The imperials were making a su
preme effort to hold a battle line
north of Kuala Lumpur and the sit
uation in western Malaya was re
ported improving. Japanese casual
ties mounted sharply, indicating an
increased fire power by the defend
ers, and possibly reinforcements,
front dispatches said.
