### AMIE REICHERT 
r PHERE was a neat little story in
yesterday's "Washington Merry-
Go-Round" that will cause many an
arch-exponent of National Unity to
raise an outraged eyebrow.
Pearson and Allen reported that
Charles Lindbergh spoke on De
cember 17 at a secret meeting in
New York of the America First
Committee—which it would ap
pear has not risen Phocnix-likc
from the ashes to which General
Wood cremated it several weeks
ago—because it never died at all.
According to the Washington re
porters, Lindbergh told his asso
ciates that Britain was responsible
for the war; also that Britain should
have joined with Germany in de
stroying Soviet Russia.

" r ex-Colonel also counseled
his listeners to keep in the
background for the present. He in
dicated the belief that there would
be plenty of opportunity for renewed
activity and criticism of the America
First type."
The column closes with a note
to the effect that a Detroit isola
tionist leader "is quietly trying to
line up former America First
leaders to help him petition Con
gress to demand that ex-hero
Lindbergh be made head of the
U.S. air forces, and Senators
Wheeler and Nye be appointed
members of the Cabinet."
This is sensational news. Trou
ble-shooting Columnists Pearson
and Allen are not the most reli
able sources in the nation, nor are
they by a long shot the most con
servative newspapermen. But it
seems to this writer that they
have raised a point which will go
a long way to clarifying our pres
ent conception of "national unity."
Whether the story is true is
something we can not prove. Cer
tainly it is plausible enough in view
of the flyer's record and his polit
ical statements of the past few years
which have always smacked strongly
of the Quisling-Petain flavor.

fact that the ex-hero so nobly
ofTered his services in the flying
corps of the U.S. armed forces does
not for one moment convince this
writer that he has had a change of
heart where appeasement of the
Axis is concerned.
Because he has not made any
public statements of the type for
which he is now so famous and
clear to the hearts of the American
people, since the outbreak of the
war, is not a credit to his patriot
ism or a sign that he had had
some miraculous revelation which
would lead him to believe that he
has been wrong and the President
right all these years.
No. It is simply that the ex
hero is nobody's fool and he does
n't particularly relish the thought
of being branded a traitor or a
scditionist or an undcrmincr of
morale at a time when the Amer
ican people arc overwhelmingly
determined to wage and win this
war.
That he should be rewarded for
the devotion and patriotism which
he so peculiarly exhibited in the
long months leading up to Pearl
Harbor, by being dubbed com
mander-in-chief of the nation's air
forces would be a folly too great
even to be dreamed of.

'JPHE gigantic flood of war feeling
and national unity which has
.swept the country since Dec. 7 car
ries with it a good deal of scum;
the torrent has been cataclysmic,
hiding in its depths the threats and
dangers to our war effort which we
have chosen to forget about, to ig
nore, now that the war is upon us.
This is not national unity, it is
the grossest and most dangerous
kind of stupidity. Not to recog
nize that the fifth column and the
disciples of the Umbrella Man are
still among us is in itself appease
ment, compromise, blindness.
H. R. Knickerbocker has recently
published a brilliant and enlighten
ing book called "Is Tomorrow Hit
ler's?" The section on Mr. Lind
bergh is particularly interesting. It
is subtitled "Fifth-Columnists."
