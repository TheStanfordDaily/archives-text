# MacArthur Entrenches For Last Ditch Stand; House Ousts LaGuardia
## 187 to 168 Vote Rejects 'Flower' As Defense Head 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP).—The
House today voted 187 to 188 to oust
Mayor Fiorcllo 11. LaGuardia of New
York as director of civilian defense
and to place administration of the
program under the War Department.
The action—rejecting administra
tion desires and overruling a state
ment by Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson that his department did not
want the job—came on approval of a
bill authorizing $100,000,000 for the
program but with the stipulation
that supervision should be placed in
the hands of the War Department.
The bill now goes to conference
with the Senate, which passed a
measure providing an unlimited ap
propriation for civilian defense to be
administered by LaGuardia's O.C.D.
House debate was spirited, with
much criticism of LaGuardia for
holding two important jobs—O.C.D.
director and mayor of the nation's
largest city. Several pi oponents of
army supervision voiced the opinion
that directorship of the program was
a "full-time job" and that the ad
ministrator should not divide his
time.
