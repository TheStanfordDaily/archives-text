# Navy Air Corps Sign-Ups High
## Farm Campus Heads Applying for Training 
### 
Two enlistment days on the Stan
ford campus came to a close yester
day afternoon with scores of Stan
ford men turning in applications for
the Naval Reserve Air Corps to En
sign George Vaughan, Stanford '39,
of the Naval Aviation Cadet Selec
tion Board of San Francisco.
Leading football and basketball
players and campus leaders may
leave college for the Air Corps if
preliminary applications are accept
ed. The exact number and names of
applicants will not be released un
til the applicants have been given
their physical examination, accord
ing to Ensign Vaughan.
Ensign Vaughan was on the
campus Wednesday and Thursday in
the Union Cellar Store answering
inquiries of Stanford men about
service in the Naval Reserve Air
Corps, and accepting preliminary ap
plications from graduates, seniors,
juniors, and sophomores who will
have completed two years of college
by this June.
AIR TRAINING
The enlistment also culminated in
the organization of a Stanford unit
of Stanford enlistees who will go
through their air training together.
This group met yesterday in the Nit
ery at 1 p.m.
Because of the demand for Navy
flying officers, training programs are
being speeded up, and students ac
cepted will be allowed to finish their
current school year before going into
actual training.
Enlistment in the Reserve branch
of the Navy, class V-5, exempts the
student from the draft while he is
completing the present school year.
Physical examinations for those
who wish to enlist are given at the
Naval Aviation Cadet Selection
Board in the Ferry Building, San
Francisco. Appointments were ar
ranged by Ensign Vaughan.
ENSIGN COMMISSION
On successful completion of the
flight training of class V-5 of the
Naval Reserve, cadets are given a
commission as either ensigns in the
U.S. Naval Reserve or Second Lieu
tenants in the Marine Corps Re
serve. Students interested in en
listing in the Navy's V-7 program
for training engineers and deck of
ficers must go to the headquarters
in the Federal Building, San Fran
cisco.
College juniors and seniors who
have completed one full year of
college mathematics arc accepted for
this training. In this classification
both juniors and seniors will be al
lowed to graduate before going into
the three months' training at either
Northwestern or the training ship
Prairie State.
