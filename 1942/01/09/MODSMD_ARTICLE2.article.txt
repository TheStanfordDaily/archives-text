# Row Dinners To Continue This Evening
## Second Rush Period To Begin Monday; Simplicity Stressed 
### 
Sorority rushing goes into the
second round tonight as rushces go
up the Row for dinner at the various
houses.
Tonight marks the second in a
series of four functions given in
honor of this year's rushees which
constitutes the first period of rush
ing, according to sorority officials.
The second period, they added, im
mediately follows this first one with
out the customary day of silence
when sorority women may have no
contact with rushees.
The second rushing period, which
begins Monday night, will include
three dinners and rushees may at
tend two of these at the same house;
whereas during the first period they
may go only once to a given house,
Pan Hellenic Council announced.
STREET CARD O.K.
Street clothes are being worn by
both rushees and sorority women
during this first period of rushing,
but in the coming week Row women
will be required to wear formals at
each function, Barbara Rapp, Pan
Hell president stated.
The third and final period of
rushing for the 1942 season will con
sist of dinners next Thursday and
Friday nights, and formal pledging
will take place on Saturday night
after each sorority has released its
bids, according to the Council presi
dent. This year all transactions of
this kind will be carried on through
Miss Rapp's office in the Women's
Clubhouse, while in past, years they
were dealt with directly to Roble
and other living groups, she stated.
In the first meeting of the quar
ter last Monday, Pan Hellenic
Council was requested to urge the
various houses to plan their rushing
functions as simply as possible.
''Because of the trying times
through which we are living," the
Council president warned, "we must
keep our life here at Stanford as
much the same as possible, and the
spirit of rushing should bo as digni
fied and friendly as in the past but
extravagance and display are now
more than ever in poor tasted'
