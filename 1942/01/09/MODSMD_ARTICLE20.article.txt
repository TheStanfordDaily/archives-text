# Sweaters Immoral? No—Patriotic!
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. S (UP).—
Margaret Landry believes "Mr.
Hays is just silly to think sweaters
are immoral"—and 5.000 Ameri
can soldiers agree with her.
Likewise, some dozen or so hard
boiled New York photographers
who in less than an hour today
i took more pictures of Margaret in
her sweater than have been taken
of Winston Churchill on his entire
American visit.
Margaret, I!), brunette and defi

nitely cuddlesome, won the title*
"America's ofTicial sweater girl"
over 5.00(1 contestants in a nation
wide competition held by a knit
wear association. Her reward, be
sides honor and glory, was a $500
defense bond and a 10-day Broad
way whirl.
"Wearing a sweater is really
patriotic/' Margaret said in a heavy
Southern drawl—she comes from
Baton Rouge. La. — '•because it
pleases the soldiers."
