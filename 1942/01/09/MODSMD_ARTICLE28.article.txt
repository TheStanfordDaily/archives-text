### 
Plans for the Stanford Civilian
Pilot Training Program for the win
ter and spring quarter are at present
tentative, according to Dr. David L.
Webster, head of Ihe Stanford CPTP.
All current plans, including ground
school course plans, are temporary,
and pending decision awaiting in
structions received here from the
War Department.
The flight training part of the
program was definitely eliminated
after the War Department prohibited
unrestricted Hying within 150 miles of
the coast.
Students who are interested in en
rolling in the program should leave
their names with Miss Isabel I M.
Steiner, CPTP secretary, whose of
fice is located in the Physics Build
ing, so that the department will have
the information for the CAA, Dr.
Webster announced.
He also urges those students who
have already indicated their desire
to the take the course to contact
Miss Steiner again as additional in
formation is needed.
The ground school work which
may be offered totals eight units;
five units in winter and three in
spring quarter. This includes a two
unit navigation course involving
wind conditions, magnetic variation,
and government charts; the aircraft
operations course, two units, includes
the theory of flight and all maneu
vers and the details of plane struc
ture; a two-unit class in meteor
ology.
