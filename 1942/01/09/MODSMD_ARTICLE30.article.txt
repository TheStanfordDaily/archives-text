# 'Russ Education Phenomenal,' Says Authority on U.S.S.R.
## 
### 
Speaking yesterday afternoon on "Cultural Developments in the Soviet
Union Since 1917." Corliss Lamont, noted authority on Russia since the
Revolution, said that the education of the Russian people over the past
23 years has been phenomenal.
Lamont gave as proof of this statement an account of how Russia has

fought in the present war. He said
that Russia had to have trained
people to operate the modern mech
anized machinery necessary to com
bat German fighting methods. The
fact that they have been able to
hold off the Germans and to drive
them back amply proves that the
UIS.S.R. did have these people, he
added.
In addition to training, the Rus
sians had a reason for winning
which has been one of the main
causes for their miraculous fight, La
mont continued. He gave as this
reason a basic humanist philosophy
which the Soviet educational sys
tem has put in the heart of every
Russian.
This philosophy, which "holds out
the aim of the greatest welfare of all
peoples as the greatest goal of hu
man effort" denotes a fundamental
similarity in the ideals of Soviet
Russia and the United States, La
mont remarked.
In connection with this similarity
in ideals Mr. Lamont said that
America must develop a better un
derstanding of the people of the
Soviet Republic, and that we must
make co-operation with the U.S.S.R.
a permanent thing which will con
tinue after the war.
