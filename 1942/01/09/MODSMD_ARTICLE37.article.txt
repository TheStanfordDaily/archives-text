# Cagers Vie With Pacific, St. Mary's
## 
### 
My mama dun tol' me, son: don't
talk about your championship be
fore it's won, so let's give Stanford's
12 cagers a chance to prove them
selves tonight against College of the
Pacific before we shout about how
good they are or how many PCC
titles they will win. Game time is
K p.m. in the Pavilion. Tomorrow at
p.m. the Redskins take on St.
Mary's at the San Francisco Civic
Auditorium.
Eddie Voss, suffering from a bad
head cold, is out at center, and John
Eikelman replaces him. Voss may
get into the game, but at any rate
Eikelman will start.
Without Voss at center the squad
loses only a Utile of its height ad
vantage, however, averaging 6-3V2.
NEVER ISEAT INDIANS
Ralph Francis, Pacific mentor, will
be trying to prove tonight that his
Tigers deserve to become a "big
name" in the Coast cage loop. Stan
lord and Pacific have had off and on
basketball relations, but Francis has
never yet been able to defeat the
Indians.
Tomorrow night Everett Dean's
eagers get a crack at the Gaels, who
cored a stunning upset over Cali
fornia Tuesday, 38-34.
GI XESEY lIOT TOO
St. Mary's, full of fast, short stuff,
out-maneuvered the Bears after
coming back for the second half
with a seven-point deficit. Billy
Burke slammed home three succes
sive baskets on drive-ins to the
bole, and the Gaels pulled away.
Vern Genesey dittoed Burke's trio
in the second half too, and the pair
will be tough to watch.
Jimmy Pollard, last year's frosh
wow, will be making his first ap
pearance in a varsity suit as run
ning mate with Don Burness at for
ward. Burness is acting captain to
night. Bill Cowden and Howie Dall
mar complete the starting quintet
at the guard positions.
GAME WILL TELL
Pollard, tall, fast, possessed of a
• (I shooting eye, should mold into
the Everett Dean system as the
: ame progresses, while Eikelman for
the first time is being called on to
do a starting job.
Tonight's first team has never
played together as a unit except
against its own teammates, and
what comes out of five men meeting
for the first time under pressure
will be seen only after the game
gets under way.
Any untimely blackout tonight
will force cancellation of the game
as the Pavilion cannot be "lighted
in" by blackout paper or anything
else.
The line-ups:
Pacific Stanford
Rogers F Burness
Slaughter F Pollard
Nikkei C Eikelman
Monogan G Dallmar

with a seven-point deficit. Billy
Burke slammed home three succes
sive baskets on drive-ins to the
bole, and the Gaels pulled away.
Vern Genesey dittoed Burke's trio
in the second half too, and the pair
will be tough to watch.
Jimmy Pollard, last year's frosh
wow, will be making his first ap
pearance in a varsity suit as run
ning mate with Don Burness at for
ward. Burness is acting captain to
night. Bill Cowden and Howie Dall
mar complete the starting quintet
at the guard positions.
GAME WILL TELL
Pollard, tall, fast, possessed of a
• (I shooting eye, should mold into
the Everett Dean system as the
: ame progresses, while Eikelman for
the first time is being called on to
do a starting job.
Tonight's first team has never
played together as a unit except
against its own teammates, and
what comes out of five men meeting
for the first time under pressure
will be seen only after the game
gets under way.
Any untimely blackout tonight
will force cancellation of the game
as the Pavilion cannot be "lighted
in" by blackout paper or anything
else.
The line-ups:
Pacific Stanford
Rogers F Burness
Slaughter F Pollard
Nikkei C Eikelman
Monogan G Dallmar
Johns G Cowden
My mama dun tol' me, son: don't
talk about your championship be
fore it's won, so let's give Stanford's
12 cagers a chance to prove them
selves tonight against College of the
Pacific before we shout about how
good they are or how many PCC
titles they will win. Game time is
K p.m. in the Pavilion. Tomorrow at
p.m. the Redskins take on St.
Mary's at the San Francisco Civic
Auditorium.
Eddie Voss, suffering from a bad
head cold, is out at center, and John
Eikelman replaces him. Voss may
get into the game, but at any rate
Eikelman will start.
Without Voss at center the squad
loses only a Utile of its height ad
vantage, however, averaging 6-3V2.
NEVER ISEAT INDIANS
Ralph Francis, Pacific mentor, will
be trying to prove tonight that his
Tigers deserve to become a "big
name" in the Coast cage loop. Stan
lord and Pacific have had off and on
basketball relations, but Francis has
never yet been able to defeat the
Indians.
Tomorrow night Everett Dean's
eagers get a crack at the Gaels, who
cored a stunning upset over Cali
fornia Tuesday, 38-34.

St. Mary's, full of fast, short stuff,
