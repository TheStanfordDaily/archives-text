# 'I'll Knock Him Out in a Hurry'—Louis
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 8 (UP).—The
stormiest ring dispute in 15 years
will be settled tomorrow night at
Madison Square Garden when Joe
Louis and Buddy Baer battle again
for the world heavyweight cham
pionship—and the only sure winner
is the Navy.
Not since the Dempsey-Tunney
"long count" in 1927 did any title
fight have such a turbulent after
math as the hurly-burly that fol
lowed the first meeting of brown
skinned Louis and the California
giant at Washington last May.
That night Buddy electrified the
boxing world by knocking the Negro
champion through the ropes in the
first round, only to be stunned later
by a blow after the bell ending the
sixth round. Buddy was disqualified
in the seventh when his seconds
claimed "foul" and refused to leave
his corner.
The violent dispute that followed
led to tomorrow night's return 15-
round match—a brawl that is ex
pected to attract more than 20.000
fans and a record indoor gate of
about $202,000.

Louis, defending his crown for the
20th time, will be fighting for noth
ing but personal satisfaction, since
his purse and all profits go to the
Navy Relief Society. Baer, trying to
recapture the diadem once worn by
brother Maxie. receives11 1 ii per cent
of the net gate.
To achieve his satisfaction, Louis
has vowed to knock out Buddy "in
a hurry," thus clearing his record of
the only smudges remaining — that
first-round trip to the ring apron
and later charges of foul.
Preparing for this quick knock
out, Louis has carefully conserved

his poundage so that he will scale
about 205 at the Garden weigh-in
tomorrow noon.
This will he his heaviest fighting
weight since he won the title from
Jim Braddock in 1937. The extra
avoirdupois is expected to add dyna
mite to his blows.
GOSHEN, N.Y., Jan. 8 (UP).—
Forty standard-bred colts and fillies
have been nominated for the 17th
renewal of the classic Hambletonian
Stake, at $40,000 the richest trotting
race in America, the U.S. Trotting
Association announced today.

mite to his blows.
GOSHEN, N.Y., Jan. 8 (UP).—
Forty standard-bred colts and fillies
have been nominated for the 17th
renewal of the classic Hambletonian
Stake, at $40,000 the richest trotting
race in America, the U.S. Trotting
Association announced today.
NEW YORK, Jan. 8 (UP).—The
stormiest ring dispute in 15 years
will be settled tomorrow night at
Madison Square Garden when Joe
Louis and Buddy Baer battle again
for the world heavyweight cham
pionship—and the only sure winner
is the Navy.
Not since the Dempsey-Tunney
"long count" in 1927 did any title
fight have such a turbulent after
math as the hurly-burly that fol
lowed the first meeting of brown
skinned Louis and the California
giant at Washington last May.
That night Buddy electrified the
boxing world by knocking the Negro
champion through the ropes in the
first round, only to be stunned later
by a blow after the bell ending the
sixth round. Buddy was disqualified
in the seventh when his seconds
claimed "foul" and refused to leave
his corner.
The violent dispute that followed
led to tomorrow night's return 15-
round match—a brawl that is ex
pected to attract more than 20.000
fans and a record indoor gate of
about $202,000.

Louis, defending his crown for the
20th time, will be fighting for noth
ing but personal satisfaction, since
his purse and all profits go to the
Navy Relief Society. Baer, trying to
recapture the diadem once worn by
brother Maxie. receives11 1 ii per cent
of the net gate.
To achieve his satisfaction, Louis
has vowed to knock out Buddy "in
a hurry," thus clearing his record of
the only smudges remaining — that
first-round trip to the ring apron
and later charges of foul.
Preparing for this quick knock
out, Louis has carefully conserved

his poundage so that he will scale
about 205 at the Garden weigh-in
tomorrow noon.
This will he his heaviest fighting
weight since he won the title from
Jim Braddock in 1937. The extra
avoirdupois is expected to add dyna
mite to his blows.
