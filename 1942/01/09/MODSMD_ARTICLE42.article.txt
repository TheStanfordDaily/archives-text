# '45 Hoopmen Open Against Highlanders
## 
### 
Final polish has been thoroughly
applied to the 1941 frosh hoop ma
chine and at 0:15 tonight the year
ling basketeers take the floor against
an excellent Piedmont High squad
for thvir iirst trial.
The five men chosen by Frosh
Coach Phil Bengtson to start the tilt
for the Class of 1945 have the speed
and stamina to equal and even to
better the excellent records of
former years, and from the looks of
their practice workouts more out
standing Stanford hoop careers are
at the verge of birth.
Freddy Parsons, special collection
of speed from Oakland, is probably
destined to spark the squad in the
game tonight, matched at the other
forward position by the slippery
strategy of Bob Barsocchini, former
San Francisco High School player.
HEA!,D AT CENTER
Only out-of-stater is rugged Jack
Heald, Montanan named on the
st; rting squad at center. The guard
posts fall to Dave Brown, for
whom it's old home night with his
Piedmont High teammates of former
years, and Bob Hall, product of Oak
land High athletics.
Reserves that can aid the starting
hoopmen are available in quality if
not in quantity. Two other full
quints will be in suit, including Fer
rogiaro. Hagopian, and Dave Pate,
guard replacements, Harwood and
Hart well to back up the pivot spot,
and Flammer, Porter, Vayssie, Wood
aid, and Herrick complete the sqaud.
Opposed to these boys will be a
strong Piedmont quint, previous vic
tors over such tough teams as Oak
land Tech and paced by forward
"Babe" Higgins, the man to watch on
the visitors' offensive plays tonight.
The Piedmonters are coached by
Greg Englehard, former Cal hoop
star.
The Stanford freshmen will be
using a lot of corner push shots to
night. The system employed is
shaping the freshmen for future
play under Everett Dean, so look for
plenty of fast-break plays.

chine and at 0:15 tonight the year
ling basketeers take the floor against
an excellent Piedmont High squad
for thvir iirst trial.
The five men chosen by Frosh
Coach Phil Bengtson to start the tilt
for the Class of 1945 have the speed
and stamina to equal and even to
better the excellent records of
former years, and from the looks of
their practice workouts more out
standing Stanford hoop careers are
at the verge of birth.
Freddy Parsons, special collection
of speed from Oakland, is probably
destined to spark the squad in the
game tonight, matched at the other
forward position by the slippery
strategy of Bob Barsocchini, former
San Francisco High School player.
HEA!,D AT CENTER
Only out-of-stater is rugged Jack
Heald, Montanan named on the
st; rting squad at center. The guard
posts fall to Dave Brown, for
whom it's old home night with his
Piedmont High teammates of former
years, and Bob Hall, product of Oak
land High athletics.
Reserves that can aid the starting
hoopmen are available in quality if
not in quantity. Two other full
quints will be in suit, including Fer
rogiaro. Hagopian, and Dave Pate,
guard replacements, Harwood and
Hart well to back up the pivot spot,
and Flammer, Porter, Vayssie, Wood
aid, and Herrick complete the sqaud.
Opposed to these boys will be a
strong Piedmont quint, previous vic
tors over such tough teams as Oak
land Tech and paced by forward
"Babe" Higgins, the man to watch on
the visitors' offensive plays tonight.
The Piedmonters are coached by
Greg Englehard, former Cal hoop
star.
The Stanford freshmen will be
using a lot of corner push shots to
night. The system employed is
shaping the freshmen for future
play under Everett Dean, so look for
plenty of fast-break plays.
