$110,000,000,000. One hundred ten billion
dollars.
1 That is what the national debt will be at the
end of the coming fiscal year on June 30, 1943.
The federal government will spend 56 billions
during this year.
During the heaviest year of the last war we
spent 18 billion in one year, and in two years
the national debt rose from 3 to 25 billion.
From this it must be obvious that the costs,
as well as the strategies, of modern war have
changed drastically.
To most of us these staggering sums and how
they are going to be paid are completely out
of our realm of conception. We don't even
flinch when we read that there will be 9 billions
collected during the coming year in NEW
taxes —brand new ones, over and above all that
are being paid this year.
Though they do not understand where the
money is coming from, most people in America
are ready and willing to do their part, heartily
seconding President Roosevelt's statement in
the budget message, "I can say only that we
are determined to pay whatever price we must
to preserve our way of life."
We are assuming this terrific burden during
this, our first year in the war. Mr. Churchill
says we will be ready to really swing into a
mass final offensive at the beginning of 1943,
just a year from now. And President Roosevelt
will also at that time be outlining another war
budget to Congress.
That one is going to be heavier and broader
than any we have seen until now. We haven't
seen anything yet. We are only in our first year
of war.
England has been at war since September
1939. She has gone through bombing, rationing,
unheard-of taxes, forced saving. Taxation and
the financial situation in England right now is
so drastically changed from the days before
the war that there are less than 25 men in
England whose usable income reaches $15,000.
And they have very little to spend it on.
We don't face the possibilities of such heavy
food and product rationing as undergone by
England, but with federal government expendi
tures reaching 56 billions of dollars for one
year, it is very probable that our taxation and
forced savings will accomplish the same gen
eral result in this country.
To face this staggering problem of financing
our war against the Axis, we are facing just
such a leveling-out of wealth distribution. And
a great many of the moneyed people of this
country are shaking in their custom-made shoes,
afraid that the fate of England's wealthy will
soon be theirs, scared that their fortunes will
be reduced to mere "pittances."
New York, a financial center rather than a
production center, is not profiting from the
defense spending and is the center of this
fear phobia.
Is this the much-hailed "national unity" which
Pearl Harbor supposedly achieved for us?
Now that Congress has the problem of col
lecting 9 billions in brand new taxes, these
money moguls had better quit their quivering,
resign themselves to a greatly slashed income,
and start helping rather than hindering the
war effort and morale of their country.

During the heaviest year of the last war we
spent 18 billion in one year, and in two years
the national debt rose from 3 to 25 billion.
From this it must be obvious that the costs,
as well as the strategies, of modern war have
changed drastically.
To most of us these staggering sums and how
they are going to be paid are completely out
of our realm of conception. We don't even
flinch when we read that there will be 9 billions
collected during the coming year in NEW
taxes —brand new ones, over and above all that
are being paid this year.
Though they do not understand where the
money is coming from, most people in America
are ready and willing to do their part, heartily
seconding President Roosevelt's statement in
the budget message, "I can say only that we
are determined to pay whatever price we must
to preserve our way of life."
We are assuming this terrific burden during
this, our first year in the war. Mr. Churchill
says we will be ready to really swing into a
mass final offensive at the beginning of 1943,
just a year from now. And President Roosevelt
will also at that time be outlining another war
budget to Congress.
That one is going to be heavier and broader
than any we have seen until now. We haven't
seen anything yet. We are only in our first year
of war.
England has been at war since September
1939. She has gone through bombing, rationing,
unheard-of taxes, forced saving. Taxation and
the financial situation in England right now is
so drastically changed from the days before
the war that there are less than 25 men in
England whose usable income reaches $15,000.
And they have very little to spend it on.
We don't face the possibilities of such heavy
food and product rationing as undergone by
England, but with federal government expendi
tures reaching 56 billions of dollars for one
year, it is very probable that our taxation and
forced savings will accomplish the same gen
eral result in this country.
To face this staggering problem of financing
our war against the Axis, we are facing just
such a leveling-out of wealth distribution. And
a great many of the moneyed people of this
country are shaking in their custom-made shoes,
afraid that the fate of England's wealthy will
soon be theirs, scared that their fortunes will
be reduced to mere "pittances."
New York, a financial center rather than a
production center, is not profiting from the
defense spending and is the center of this
fear phobia.
Is this the much-hailed "national unity" which
Pearl Harbor supposedly achieved for us?
Now that Congress has the problem of col
lecting 9 billions in brand new taxes, these
money moguls had better quit their quivering,
resign themselves to a greatly slashed income,
and start helping rather than hindering the
war effort and morale of their country.
