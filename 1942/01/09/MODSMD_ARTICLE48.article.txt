# . . . Or Else!

T-iERE are three things which every Stanford
raternity must do to avoid the threatening
war time financial dangers.
These dangers arise from sharply decreasing
active membership because of men entering the
services. In proportion, financial support de
clines.
The solution is to keep each house as full
as possible with members "living in." The
means to this end, which fraternities might well
adopt, are these:
1. Pledge a full class of 14 freshmen and as
many sophomores and juniors as it is necessary
or possible to pledge

2. Encourage members in the graduate
schools, who have almost always lived else
where than in the house after graduation, to
move into the house. What they need is quiet
and plenty of it for study, and for that reason,
more than any other, they don't live in the
houses. Make such provisions as blacked-out
study rooms and quiet hours to entice them
back into the houses, and then enforce these
provisions—rigidly.
3. Contact brothers who have transferred
into Stanford from other universities, have them
up to the house, and make an honest effort to
affiliate them.
These suggestions have already been prof
fered by a forward-looking Interfraternity Board
of Control. Dean of Men John Bunn and Mr.
Warren Turner, Interfraternity auditor, have
warned of the consequences if precautionary
steps are not taken.
To prove the imminent danger, consider the
fact that one house is in such precarious finan
cial shape that it was faced with the alternative
of losing its charter or merging with the Stan
ford chapter of another fraternity, at the start
of the school year. Maybe it was an act of God
that still keeps its doors open and its dinner
bell ringing.—Harold Shafer
