# BULL SESSION
## OUR LEADERS 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
a while it looked like we had campus leaders
who had a little sense and could be expected to act
fairly intelligently. For a while it seemed that they
were going to modify school life so that it would fit
in with the nation's big problem of winning a war.
It looked as if our leaders were aware that a war was
going on and that we were not living in normal times
and that it wasn't too much to ask students to make
trifling sacrifices when the rest of the nation was giv
ing so much more. Everyone thought it sane when
the student leaders agreed that during these times
when money is so valuable in helping win the war,
that all unwarranted, really unnecessary expenses
should be done away with. And when on Registra
tion Day the campus danced to phonographs, at the
price of 25 cents and a package of cigarettes, everyone
felt it to be the least bit of a sacrifice that the stu
dents could make, and really a very intelligent policy
and one that should be continued throughout the rest
of the war time.
In short, things were going along too smoothly, too
thoughtfully, and the problem was being faced with too
much understanding to expect it to continue that way.
And then it happened. Someone mentioned Tommy
Dorsey. The toes of our student leaders began to
tingle. They could hear the soft, mellow tones of the
famous trombone, and could hear the tender voice of
Frank Sinatra, and they forgot about the war, they
forgot about their policy of inexpensiveness, they
forgot they were intelligent student leaders, and acted
very much like little children.

A ND it didn't matter to them if our country was fight
ing for its life. It didn't matter if some of our
own students had already given their lives in the fight.
It didn't seem possible to them to try to save as much
money as possible. They were interested in other
things. "We shouldn't curtail social activities imme
diately but if the United States is bombed, then we
could modify social life all at once," they were say
ing. "Who's going to stay here if you take all our
privileges away?" they were asking. Those words
from our student leaders. From students whom we
have elected. Go ahead and have your war if you
want it, but don't ask us to do our share, is what they
were really saying. Fight for us, but don't bother us
unless there's some actual bombing. Have your war,
but let us dance, no not to any old phonograph, but to
a big name band. We can't give up everything we
cherish and hold dear. And a big name band is one
thing we won't give up unless there is some actual
bombing on this campus. That is what our student
leaders were actually saying. I know now why I have
always thought elections, student officers and student
government about the silliest and most unprofitable
ways of wasting time.
