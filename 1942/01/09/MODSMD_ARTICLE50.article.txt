# FROM the FACULTY
## MODERN LANGUAGES IN WARTIME 
### 
keen interest which the United States govern
ment takes in the continued and even intensified
instruction of nearly all the living languages of the
world was clearly shown at a special meeting held at
the close of the annual convention of the Modern
Language Association of America in the Claypool
Hotel, Indianapolis, December 31, 1941. Arranged un
der the auspices of the National Federation of Modern
Language Teachers, this gathering was addressed by
Richard Patt.ee of the Department of State and by
Mortimer Graves of the American Council of Learned
Societies.
It was Dr. Graves who was largely instrumental in
preparing the recent questionnaire which was intended
to establish the language competences available in
the United States, and it was he who chiefly stressed
at this meeting the increased importance of foreign
language teaching and learning as a vital phase of na
tional defense. It will be new to many persons, I
think, that an army division operating in a foreign
territory should have at least forty men in it who
are masters of the language of the region; nobody
thinks, he added, that our army commands at pres
ent anywhere near such a staff of linguists as would
be required to meet this demand.
The message of both government representatives
and all the other speakers to the assembled language
teachers was that we should keep on with what we
are doing, do more of it, and do it better, if possible;
for we could not possibly do enough for the country's
needs. In debate, the present writer urged that what
we need for fullest efficiency is an "army" of language
teachers, with a commanding "general" at the head
of it; this suggestion met with widespread approval
and some hope of corresponding action was expressed
by Dr. Graves.
I could not but remember the address made to
Stanford students over a year ago by President Wil
bur, in which he urged that it would be a fatal mis
take to discontinue or curtail the study of German
because Germany might be regarded as, or might be
come, an enemy country. On the contrary, this should
call for an increased attention to the language of the
German people, as the indispensable portal to their
thought, their military tactics, and their technical
progress. It is evident that Dr. Wilbur was voicing,
far in advance of the event, the considered attitude of
our government in war-time.
