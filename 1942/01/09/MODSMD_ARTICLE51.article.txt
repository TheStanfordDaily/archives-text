### 
"WILD IS THE RIVER," by Louis Bromfield, published by Harper &
Brothers, New York.
This is a colorful lale of wild, undisciplined New Orleans under the in
expert handling of the Union Army of Occupation during the Civil War.
It catches the air of luxurious decadence and devil-may-care attitude of

a city released from all sense of.
convention.
The central figure is a handsome,
domineering young Yankee officer,
Tom Bedloe, who loses himself in
the heady atmosphere, and becomes
involved with two adventuresses,
one a French prostitute, La Lionne,
and the other the scheming fascinat
ing Baroness de Leche.
UGLY HEAD REARS
From Boston comes his prim
fiancee, Agnes Wicks, to save him
from the wickedness which threat
ens him. She and her adventurous
old maid aunt, Tam, finally reach
New Orleans after a trip on a filthy
trading vessel, protected only by a
faithful negro ex-slave.
Before reaching their goal, they
become involved in a number of
startling coincidences. They are
forced to take shelter in the swamps
when the ship is wrecked, and fi
nally are taken to shelter at the
manor of the Baroness by her young
Scotch lieutenant, McTavish. Un
known to them, Tom is in the same
house, and interesting consequences
result.
WITCHCRAFT
The action is enhanced by the
dark intrigues of witchcraft and the
ravages of yellow fever, marauding
renegade soldiers, and slaves, drunk
with the power of their new free
dom. It is an exuberant chronicle of
one of the most dramatic episodes in
national history, enlivened by the
warm personalities which it in
volves.
The setting is a rich background
of the author's talent for exotic de
scription and breath-taking narra
tive. Especially fine is the sharp
contrast which he makes between the
langorous South and the cold, brisk,
straight-laced New England.
Every character is a study in it
self, as each is changed and molded
by the subtle influence of the sin
ister city. It is a constantly moving
saga of murder, suicide, and adven
ture, which enmeshes the characters
and brings them all to an unexpected
climax.â€”Craig
