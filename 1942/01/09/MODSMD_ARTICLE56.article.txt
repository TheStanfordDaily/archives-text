PITTSBURGH, Jan. 8 (UP).-An
army pilot's attempt to bring help
to a fellow officer tonight caused him
to crash into an open field in a
Pittsburgh suburb, only 12 miles
short of safety at Allegheny County
Airport.

About 50,000 tons of waste paper
are being salvaged in England each
week, according to the Department
of commerce.
