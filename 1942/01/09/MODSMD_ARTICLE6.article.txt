# Men to Resume Row Visits As Second Rush Period Opens
## 
### 
With their initial introduction to fraternity life behind them, freshmen
and lower division transfers begin more prolonged visits to the Row
today and tomorrow in the second regular rushing period.
Rushees received cards yesterday from the various houses showing five
possible visiting times—three Friday and two Saturday. These were
checked by the rushees according to+ —

their preference and mailed back. |
Quad clothes, according to Jim i
Haugh, Interfraternity president,
are perfectly acceptable for the
luncheon engagements today and to
morrow as well as this afternoon's
visiting period from 3 to 5. Informal
dress —coat and tie—is in order for
dinner dates.
OPEN HOUSE
Following the regular rushing pe
riod today and tomorrow, a second
Open House will be held next Wed
nesday and Thursday, January 14
and 15.
Stanford's Interfraternity Board,
according to Haugh, will meet Tues
day, and Interfraternity Council will
meet Thursday night to discuss
rushing progress thus far and con
sider any violations of rushing rules.
Before rushing goes into its more
advanced stages, Haugh asks that
both fraternity members and rush
ees familiarize themselves with the
rushing rules printed below.
NO OFF-CAMPUS RUSHING
There shall be no off-campus
rushing.
No fraternity man shall enter En
cina except with the permission of a
sponsor not of his own house. Fresh
men must keep out of fraternity
houses except during regular rush
periods.
After the rushing period opens,
contact of an informal nature be
tween new lower division men and
fraternity men shall be permitted;
however, there shall be no group
meetings composed of more than
eight men, with four fraternity men
to one frosh to be the maximum
ratio.
Informal contact will be limited to
a specific time. (Not a rule but a
strong suggestion.)
There shall be no group meetings
in such places as Quad buildings,
private or campus residences.
No pledge is binding until formal
pledge day (February 6).
No house may pledge more than
14 freshmen.
No student on probation may be
allowed to pledge.
Any contact between fraternity
men and rushees is strictly prohib
ited in the period following prefer
ence dinner through formal pledg
ing. Pledging will be held in the
basement of the Women's Club
house.
IMPORTANT: Each house will
be held fully responsible for any
violation by an individual mem
ber. whether his action was sanc
tioned by house authorities or not.
The penalty for any infraction of
these rules is to be applied at the
impartial discretion of the Interfra
ternity Board of Control. Both
rushee and fraternity are equally
subject to the action of the board
in case of an infraction. Any infrac- I
tion of the above rules must be re
ported to a member of the Interfra
ternity Board within 15 days after
its occurrence.
