i
Men's Council brought its gun
sights to bear on two Stanford fra
ternities and fired punitive dis
charges for "conduct unbecoming
Stanford gentlemen" at two succes
sive meetings, Dec. 1 and Dec. 8,
1941, as revealed yesterday by a
statement from Chairman Stan
Owen.
At the Dec. 1 meeting, "the Zeta
Psi fraternity was found guilty of
conduct unbecoming Stanford gen
tlemen on the day and night of the
Big Game bonfire and parade,"
[ Owen said. "The penalty was im
posed as follows. Each active must
have completed five hours of work
at the Convalescent Home by Feb.
1, 1942. If ALL such work is not
completed at that time, rushing
privileges for the YEAR will be
cancelled. Also, the Zeta Psi frater
nity is to be on Social Probation un
til the end of Winter Quarter, 1942."
Describing action taken against
the second house, Dec. 8, Owen said,
"Beta Theta Pi fraternity was found
guilty of conduct unbecoming Stan
ford gentlemen during the Big Game
parade, and the fraternity was placed
on Social Probation until the end of
Winter Quarter, 1942."
Aside from these formal stale
j ments, Owen made no comment on
action taken.
