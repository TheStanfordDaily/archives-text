### AMIE REICHERT 
r JpHE strategy behind Japan's at
tack on the Netherlands Indies
seems to be an attempt to encircle
and isolate Singapore by cutting off
her supply lines.
Japanese control of the Indies
would be a tremendous and dan
gerous victory for the Axis, for it
would not only make the invaders
heir to the vital raw materials of
those islands, but would also put
them in an excellent position to
harrass the supply lines from Aus
tralia to Java, Sumatra, and
Singapore, and those from the
United States to Australia.
If the Japanese strategy is suc
cessful, the Battle of the Pacific may
be over at least for the time being.
A Singapore that is completely en
circled by the enemy, isolated and
cut ofl from reinforcements and
supplies, would be of little value to
the Allied war effort in the Pacific.
♦ * *
hphe initial speed and power of the
Japanese drive down the Malay
peninsula in the opening days of the
war seemed to indicate at first that
they were going to concentrate all
their effort on capturing Singapore,
and then turn to the Netherlands
Indies, whose position would be
greatly weakened by the loss of the
naval base.
But now the Japanese assault
on Borneo and Celebes leads one
to suspect that the invaders arc
synchronising the two movements,
in order to weaken Singapore, and
at the same time capture the sat
ellite islands which lie around it.
Gobbling up all of the Netherlands
Indies is a fairly big operation, and
it is not a job that could be done
ordinarily with any case. But two
factors are working in favor of the
enemy: first, the fact that Singapore
is under fire and the British have
their hands pretty full there; and
second, that the Japanese still have
both naval and air superiority.
The factors of air superiority is
an especially significant one. It is,
in great measure, the key to
Japan's success thus far in the
war.

it might not be
at all necessary for the Japs to
subdue all the island of the Dutch.
The main thing would be to estab
lish and hold adequate air and naval
bases for attack on the Allied sup
ply lines.
Military and naval observers in
this country arc now predicting
that the next major battleground
in the Asiatic war theater will be
the Dutch island of Java, and that
the forces of the ABCD powers
which will defend that island must
be reinforced quickly — probably
from Australia.
If that is the case, it is even more
imperative than ever to keep those
supply channels open. It is highly
probable that this shift in battle
ground will occur shortly, and when
it does, that American troops will be
sent to Australia in great numbers.
Dutch sources last night said that
U.S. warships were operating in East
Indies waters and that "it is assumed
that they will join in fighting off the
invasion." The Dutch also reported
that British warships were in the
vicinity.

JAVA, it will be remembered, is
the headquarters of the Allied
Supreme Command under General
Wavell. U.S. convoys to that island
have in the past used the Molucca
Passage, between Celebes and the
Molucca Island Group. Disruption of
that route is one of the Japanese
objectives.
An attack on the Dutch island
of Sumatra may also be imminent.
Such a move would be designed to
establish a pinecrs around Java.
The outlook is bad, very bad for
the Allies. The chances for success
in this new movement are perhaps a
little better than in the case of a
simple frontal attack on Singapore.
If this strategy is successful the Japa
nese will have complete if temporary
control, of Exist Asia, which is ex
actly what they have been demand
ing for the last ten years.

have in the past used the Molucca

would not only make the invaders

those islands, but would also put
them in an excellent position to

Such a move would be designed to
establish a pinecrs around Java.
The outlook is bad, very bad for
the Allies. The chances for success
in this new movement are perhaps a
little better than in the case of a
simple frontal attack on Singapore.
If this strategy is successful the Japa
nese will have complete if temporary
control, of Exist Asia, which is ex
actly what they have been demand
ing for the last ten years.
r JpHE strategy behind Japan's at
tack on the Netherlands Indies
seems to be an attempt to encircle
and isolate Singapore by cutting off
her supply lines.
Japanese control of the Indies
would be a tremendous and dan
gerous victory for the Axis, for it
would not only make the invaders
heir to the vital raw materials of
those islands, but would also put
them in an excellent position to
harrass the supply lines from Aus
tralia to Java, Sumatra, and
Singapore, and those from the
United States to Australia.
If the Japanese strategy is suc
cessful, the Battle of the Pacific may
be over at least for the time being.
A Singapore that is completely en
circled by the enemy, isolated and
cut ofl from reinforcements and
supplies, would be of little value to
the Allied war effort in the Pacific.

hphe initial speed and power of the
Japanese drive down the Malay
peninsula in the opening days of the
war seemed to indicate at first that
they were going to concentrate all
their effort on capturing Singapore,
and then turn to the Netherlands
Indies, whose position would be
greatly weakened by the loss of the
naval base.
But now the Japanese assault
on Borneo and Celebes leads one
to suspect that the invaders arc
synchronising the two movements,
in order to weaken Singapore, and
at the same time capture the sat
ellite islands which lie around it.
Gobbling up all of the Netherlands
Indies is a fairly big operation, and
it is not a job that could be done
ordinarily with any case. But two
factors are working in favor of the
enemy: first, the fact that Singapore
is under fire and the British have
their hands pretty full there; and
second, that the Japanese still have
both naval and air superiority.
The factors of air superiority is
an especially significant one. It is,
in great measure, the key to
Japan's success thus far in the
war.

it might not be
at all necessary for the Japs to
subdue all the island of the Dutch.
The main thing would be to estab
lish and hold adequate air and naval
bases for attack on the Allied sup
ply lines.
Military and naval observers in
this country arc now predicting
that the next major battleground
in the Asiatic war theater will be
the Dutch island of Java, and that
the forces of the ABCD powers
which will defend that island must
be reinforced quickly — probably
from Australia.
If that is the case, it is even more
imperative than ever to keep those
supply channels open. It is highly
probable that this shift in battle
ground will occur shortly, and when
it does, that American troops will be
sent to Australia in great numbers.
Dutch sources last night said that
U.S. warships were operating in East
Indies waters and that "it is assumed
that they will join in fighting off the
invasion." The Dutch also reported
that British warships were in the
vicinity.

JAVA, it will be remembered, is
the headquarters of the Allied
Supreme Command under General
Wavell. U.S. convoys to that island
have in the past used the Molucca
Passage, between Celebes and the
Molucca Island Group. Disruption of
that route is one of the Japanese
objectives.
An attack on the Dutch island
of Sumatra may also be imminent.
Such a move would be designed to
establish a pinecrs around Java.
The outlook is bad, very bad for
the Allies. The chances for success
in this new movement are perhaps a
little better than in the case of a
simple frontal attack on Singapore.
If this strategy is successful the Japa
nese will have complete if temporary
control, of Exist Asia, which is ex
actly what they have been demand
