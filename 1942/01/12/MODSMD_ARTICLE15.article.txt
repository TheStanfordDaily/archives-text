# Row to Rush Robleites Again
## Dress to Be Informal For Dinner Tonight 
### 
Bids for the second period of wom
en's rushing were picked up last
night by the rushees at the office of
Pan-Hellenic Council, Barbara Rapp,
Council president, announced. Rush
ees then stated their preferences and
returned the bids to the Council of
fice by 10 last night, the Pan-Hell
president added.
With the beginning of the second
period at dinner tonight women's
lushing goes into the some stretch.
This period will include three din
ners on successive nights, according
to rushing offices, and rushees will
be permitted to attend functions
twice at a given house.
The rule of informal street clothes
still applies to rushees throughout
the second period, but sorority
women will wear formal dinner
dresses, Pan-Hellenic Council re
ported. Only during the third pe
riod of rushing do both rushees and
Row women don formal attire, the
Council decided.
Rushing reaches its climax next
Saturday night when formal pledg
ing bids are released by Stanfrord's
nine sororities. As in past years this
is followed by formal pledging at
the various houses and various forms
of entertainment in honor of the
new pledge class.
Blackouts have not as yet marred
the smoothly running mechanism of
rushing, but precautions have been
taken in the event the air raid signal
sounds. The Council announced that
the sororities have been instructed
to require rushees they are enter
taining to return to their living
groups if a blackout occurs.
