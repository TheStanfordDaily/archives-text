# Stanford Revises Curriculum To Meet Demands of War
## 
### MIKE KRESGE 
Tlie Stanford Academic Council Saturday approved measures for a
reorganization of the Summer Quarter and other means of meeting war
requirements.
By this action the summer quarter's work will become intensified
principally in the schools of engineering, medicine, biological sciences,

physical sciences and the
school of business. The tempo in the
other departments will also be
speeded up.
To accomplish and further the re
organization, the council affirmed the
following measures:
(1) To urge high school graduates
to apply for admission and enter
immediately rather than wait until
the autumn quarter.
(2) To increase the offerings for
graduate students and teachers.
(3) To request the government to
provide K.O.T.C. training throughout
the summer.
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE
(4) To provide more vocational
guidance so that students may be
come more cognizant of their abili
ties and thus ascertain where their
possibilities may be utilized to the
fullest.
(5) To offer more courses, particu
larly those dealing with technical and
professional subjects. Language
courses will also lie stepped up.
(6) To provide short courses in
subjects pertaining to specific war
utility. A variety will be given so
that every student may prepare for
some phase of national service. For
those courses of a collegiate level,
credit will be given.
REQUIREMENTS REVISED
In the School of Engineering the
council approved faculty action by
which a sharp revision in graduation
requirements was made last week.
The changes will be for the duration
of the war and are as follows:
(1) The four quarter program, in
stigated last summer, will be con
tinued and the actual program will
be expanded.
(2) Lower division requirements
for engineering majors have been
cut, Henceforth they will include
six units of English composition, one
year of history and one year of a
laboratory science. To promote faster
technical training the broad educa
tional background formerly de
manded by engineers will be sliced
in the- omission of the foreign lan
guage requirement, one year of bio
logical science, 10 units of social sci
ence, and nine units in the School of
Letters.
(3) Undergraduates may begin
specializing in fields such as aero
nautics, radio communication, sani
tation, and metallurgy. This work
will lead to the bachelor of arts de
gree.
By reason of these changes and
omissions it will be possible to com
plete the five years of engineering
training in three years following the
four quarters per year system.
CHANGES APPROVED
The action of the School of Medi
cine's four quarter basis as an
nounced recently by Dean Chandler,
was also approved by the Academic
Council.
The School of Biological Sciences
will aid the program by repeating all
basic courses to expedite the en
trance of students into medical
school. Research will be directed
with emphasis on war problems.
The Graduate School of Business
revised program will offer courses
in secretarial training and will con
tinue to accept first-year graduate
students in the summer quarter.

guage requirement, one year of bio
logical science, 10 units of social sci
ence, and nine units in the School of
Letters.
(3) Undergraduates may begin
specializing in fields such as aero
nautics, radio communication, sani
tation, and metallurgy. This work
will lead to the bachelor of arts de
gree.
By reason of these changes and
omissions it will be possible to com
plete the five years of engineering
training in three years following the
four quarters per year system.
CHANGES APPROVED
The action of the School of Medi
cine's four quarter basis as an
nounced recently by Dean Chandler,
was also approved by the Academic
Council.
The School of Biological Sciences
will aid the program by repeating all
basic courses to expedite the en
trance of students into medical
school. Research will be directed
with emphasis on war problems.
The Graduate School of Business
revised program will offer courses
in secretarial training and will con
tinue to accept first-year graduate
students in the summer quarter.
Tlie Stanford Academic Council Saturday approved measures for a
reorganization of the Summer Quarter and other means of meeting war
requirements.
By this action the summer quarter's work will become intensified
principally in the schools of engineering, medicine, biological sciences,

physical sciences and the
school of business. The tempo in the
other departments will also be
speeded up.
To accomplish and further the re
organization, the council affirmed the
following measures:
(1) To urge high school graduates
to apply for admission and enter
immediately rather than wait until
the autumn quarter.
(2) To increase the offerings for
graduate students and teachers.
(3) To request the government to
provide K.O.T.C. training throughout
the summer.
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE
(4) To provide more vocational
guidance so that students may be
come more cognizant of their abili
ties and thus ascertain where their
possibilities may be utilized to the
fullest.
(5) To offer more courses, particu
larly those dealing with technical and
professional subjects. Language
courses will also lie stepped up.
(6) To provide short courses in
subjects pertaining to specific war
utility. A variety will be given so
that every student may prepare for
some phase of national service. For
those courses of a collegiate level,
credit will be given.
REQUIREMENTS REVISED
In the School of Engineering the
council approved faculty action by
which a sharp revision in graduation
requirements was made last week.
The changes will be for the duration
of the war and are as follows:
(1) The four quarter program, in
stigated last summer, will be con
tinued and the actual program will
be expanded.
(2) Lower division requirements
for engineering majors have been
cut, Henceforth they will include
six units of English composition, one
year of history and one year of a
laboratory science. To promote faster
technical training the broad educa
tional background formerly de
manded by engineers will be sliced
in the- omission of the foreign lan
guage requirement, one year of bio
logical science, 10 units of social sci
ence, and nine units in the School of
Letters.
