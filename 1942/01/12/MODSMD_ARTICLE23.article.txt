# Co-ordinator To Help Stanford Students Fit Into U.S. War Effort
## Consultations Will Be Held In Old Union 
### BILL STEIF 
Harry Morgan, Stanford's Student
Defense Co-ordinator, tomorrow af
ternoon will begin advising Farm
men on how they can best be of
use to the nation during the present
war, it was announced yesterday.
Morgan, appointed by Excom late
last quarter to handle the job that
Bill Turner held last year, has been
collecting material during the last
several months in order to prepare
himself for the task of giving out full
information on any branch of the
service on which Stanford men wish
to consult him.
Most Stanford men during the
next year or so will find themselves
called upon to aid in the country's
all-out war effort and in order to
give all male students a chance to
discover for exactly which branch
of the service they are best fitted.
IN OLI) UNION
Morgan has been given Room l.'J
in the Old Union to receive all in
quiries. Tomorrow afternoon from 1
to 4 o'clock Morgan will be there to
speak to all men who have ques
tions concerning their service prob
lems and he will again be in Room
13 Thursday afternoon for the same
purpose. Thereafter Morgan will
probably be in his office regularly
between those times on Mondays,
Tuesdays, and Thursdays.
In this position Morgan will more
or less act as a one-man information
bureau and liaison between Stan
ford students and the army, navy,
and marines, though it should be
noted that Colonel Allen, head of
the Farm R.0.T.C., is still handling
most information concerning Uni
versity students and their relation
ships to the army.
UTILIZE TRAINING
Morgan, when questioned about
his work, stated that university men
ought to utilize the training that
they have received in school in ways
which will help the country to the
greatest degree and added that "the
services don't want college men to
be just buck privates."
The Student Defense Co-ordinator
continued by pointing out that it
was his job to show college men
how they can fit into the service po
sitions for which they are most
qualified. Morgan is thus greatly
simplifying the Stanford man's prob
lem of getting accurate information
and well-founded advice on what
branch of the service one should get
into, and, once having given a lead,
Morgan can easily tell embryo
service men the best way in which
to go about getting into the chosen
type of war work.
Morgan is willing at any time to
make appointments to speak to
Stanford men with service problems
and can be reached at his office in
the Old Union. His number is 248
on the Stanford Exchange. He can
also be reached at the Phi Psi
house.

Bill Turner held last year, has been
collecting material during the last
several months in order to prepare
himself for the task of giving out full
information on any branch of the
service on which Stanford men wish
to consult him.
Most Stanford men during the
next year or so will find themselves
called upon to aid in the country's
all-out war effort and in order to
give all male students a chance to
discover for exactly which branch
of the service they are best fitted.
IN OLI) UNION
Morgan has been given Room l.'J
in the Old Union to receive all in
quiries. Tomorrow afternoon from 1
to 4 o'clock Morgan will be there to
speak to all men who have ques
tions concerning their service prob
lems and he will again be in Room
13 Thursday afternoon for the same
purpose. Thereafter Morgan will
probably be in his office regularly
between those times on Mondays,
Tuesdays, and Thursdays.
In this position Morgan will more
or less act as a one-man information
bureau and liaison between Stan
ford students and the army, navy,
and marines, though it should be
noted that Colonel Allen, head of
the Farm R.0.T.C., is still handling
most information concerning Uni
versity students and their relation
ships to the army.
UTILIZE TRAINING
Morgan, when questioned about
his work, stated that university men
ought to utilize the training that
they have received in school in ways
which will help the country to the
greatest degree and added that "the
services don't want college men to
be just buck privates."
The Student Defense Co-ordinator
continued by pointing out that it
was his job to show college men
how they can fit into the service po
sitions for which they are most
qualified. Morgan is thus greatly
simplifying the Stanford man's prob
lem of getting accurate information
and well-founded advice on what
branch of the service one should get
into, and, once having given a lead,
Morgan can easily tell embryo
service men the best way in which
to go about getting into the chosen
type of war work.
Morgan is willing at any time to
make appointments to speak to
Stanford men with service problems
and can be reached at his office in
the Old Union. His number is 248
on the Stanford Exchange. He can
also be reached at the Phi Psi
house.
Harry Morgan, Stanford's Student
Defense Co-ordinator, tomorrow af

men on how they can best be of
use to the nation during the present
war, it was announced yesterday.
