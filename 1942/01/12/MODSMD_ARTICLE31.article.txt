"Yes, I sec (hat article, that one and that one. All this on the page.
| Yes, on the next page, too. Every article."
"Well, now just a minute," said the perspiring Stanford School of
| Journalism student, conducting a readership poll for the Redwood City
I Tiibune. "Can you tell me what this article was about?"

"Oh, no. You see, I cannot read.,
the English language." The little
French barber smiled pleasantly to
the incredulous interviewer.
"Well, why did you tell me that
you h;icl read all these news stories
that I noted, when you hadn't at
all?"
"Oh," the Frenchman said, "I just
wanted you to be happy, that's all.
My wife, she reads the paper; I cut
the hair."
"Well, thanks anyway," and
breathing hard, the Stanford jour
nalist backed out clutching his Red
wood City Tribunes, his copy of
"How to Interview for a Readership
Poll" and his badly shaken self
composure.
*EVKRYONE INTERVIEWED
But this was only typical of what
went on in many parts of Redwood
| City Friday morning and afternoon,
i Housewives, delivery men, clerks,
laborers, and retired storekeepers
, were among those who were visited
during the day by a member of the
Stanford School of Journalism.
The poll, being conducted for the I
Redwood City Tribune by the Stan- j
ford students, covered the reader- '
ship of every article in the news- ]
paper from the front headlines to
the smallest classified ad and inci
dental news item back on the last
! page.
THREE CLASSES
The people interested were divided i
. into three classes: poor, average, and [
average plus with the income range ;
beginning at less than twenty-five
a week, from twenty-five to fifty a i
week and from fifty on up a week. '

The people were again divided into
three age groups from twenty to
thirty, thirty to fifty, and from fifty
on. Each interviewer carried a black
crayon and noted on the newspaper
each article that the person said that
he had read. Occasionally the inter
viewer asked the person what a par
ticular story or advertisement was
about to be sure the person was not
just "wanting that the interviewer
should be happy" about the whole
thing.
REDWOOD CITY TRIBUNE
In all, the Stanford journalists in
terviewed :J2(> readers of the Trib
une. Working with a key newspaper
on which each story and ad was
numbered, the readership of each ar
ticle was tabulated and then the
averages, as compared to the read
ership of the paper as a whole, was
taken. The results will be used in
the journalism classes here as well
as at Ihe Tribune office as help in

increasing circulation.
But the significant fact that came
out of all the interviewing was that
most people enjoy reading the edi
torial cartoons, the comics and the
classified ads; and one elderly man,
retired, who does nothing but read
newspapers, after reading every sin
gle headline, news story, and article
in this edition of the Tribune, except
ing a picture caption and a few small
ads, suggested that the paper get a
few more comic strips because he
liked them best of all.

leadership."
