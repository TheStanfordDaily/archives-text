# Cardinals Win Pair
## Gaels Bow 36-35; Santa Clara Next 
### 
Those Galloping Gaels, shot in the
arm with a whirlwind fast break in
Ihe second half, came within one
point of upsetting Stanford Saturday
night in the San Francisco Civic Au
ditorium, luil their two last-second
prayer shots from mid-court failed
to connect as the Redskins barely
won out, 36-35.
Friday Coach Everett Dean's quin
tet thumped CoJlege of the Pacific,
42-32.
Jimmy Pollard, making his S.F.
varsity debut, fired the Saturday
clincher from 20 out after St. Mary's
had inched up to within one point
of the Indians three successive times.
The first half was Don Burness,
particularly effective from the side
with a left-handed push shot. Bur
ness scored 10 points in the first
period, and Stanford left the floor
with a 25-13 lead.
ZONE WORKS WELL
The Gaels had tried pressing in
use, then moving out to bring Stan
ford's tightly knit zone away from
the basket to leave an opening at the
keyhole, but nothing worked. Pol
lard and Howie Dallmar used their
height to great advantage off the
defensive backboard, and St. Mary's
never had a chance to rebound.
Came the second half and the
Gaels turned on their fast break to
the limit and pushed the zone for
22 points while holding the Indians
to 11. Angelo Metistri of St. Mary's
was all over the defensive backboard
every time Stanford shot.
Things were getting too close for
comfort, and Billy Burke sank a 35-
footer, bringing the Gaels up to 35-
36. Pollard had previously scored
what proved to be the winning buck
et and the Indians were trying hard
for ball control.
IIURKE, LOOMIS FAIL
In the last-minute flurry Burke
could do no better than hit the rim
from 30 feet and Ed Loomis did like
wise as the gun went off.
Burness topped the scoring with
13, and Pollard tied Maistri with
11.
Stanford seemed tired in the final
period. The addition of Ed Voss,
who has been out with a severe
cold, should give the club the added
punch that it will need to battle
Santa Clara next Friday night.
FRIDAY, 12-32
If it hadn't been for infrequent
flashes of real basketball brilliancy
by Messrs. Burness, Dallmar, and
Cowden, Friday night's 42-32 win
over College of the Pacific would
have to be written off as below par
and duller than what the team is
capable of putting out.
When the full first team was on
the floor, however, the Indians at
times were tops. The crowd stood
up once to applaud Dallmar's back
ward pass which landed smack in
Burness' arms as he tore for the
basket on a lightning break.
The regulars were on the bench
in the latter part of the second pe
riod. Taking their places were Tom
Fuller, Leo McCaffrey, Fred Oliver,
Freddie Linari, Bill Hooper, John
Leddy, and Bud Madden.
POLLARD FOULS OUT
Pollard fouled himself out of Fri
day's game before he had much of a
chance to show anything, but Sat
urday night Jimmy played a stead
ier brand of ball.
Burness took high-point honors
against the Tigers with 15 digits,
while Pollard countered 10 and Dall
mar 7.
Next week-end's bill in the Pa
vilion. especially Friday's, should
prove to be one of the best of the
season.
The Broncos and Stan Patrick in
vade the Farm Friday and San Jose
State Saturday. After defeating Cal
two weeks ago, 57-55, Santa Clara
bowed Saturday to the Bears in
overtime, 44-3(5.
Larry Dee, member of the varsity
squad, sprined his ankle Thursday
and wiil be out of uniform for a
'ouple of weeks.
