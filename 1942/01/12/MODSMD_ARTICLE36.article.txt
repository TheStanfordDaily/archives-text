# Frosh Win Basketball Opener Over Piedmont High, 37-23
## 
### 
Five freshman boys, playing Stanford basketball for the first time in
what should prove brilliant college athletic careers, shot their way to an
easy 37-23 defeat of Piedmont High Friday evening in the Pavilion.
The quintet which played all of the first half and much of the third
frame without a substitution was made up of forwards Bob Barsocchini

and Fred Parsons, center Jack,
Heald, and guards Bob Hall and
Dave Brown. All but Barsocchini
were outstanding members of the
frosh grid machine this fall, defi
nite proof that some great all
around athletes are in the making.
NOT SO TOUCH
The Piedmont victory in itself was
not particularly hard. Brown broke
the ice with a fast break play from
the corner for the opening bucket,
and after that the frosh were never
headed. Twice more in the first half
Brown, rugged product of Piedmont
High itself, hit the cords with easy
set-up shots, the Highlander's de
fense seemingly unable to cope with
the tall guard who converted himself
into a speedy forward at will.
Bob Hall put in two push shots
from the ring and tipped in another
goal after a beneath-basket scrap to
collect six points in the first half,
and Heald, Parsons, and Barsocchini
all got on the beam with a basket
apiece to put Stanford in front 19 to
12 at the half.
GAME ON ICE
In the second frame Barsocchini
caught on fire and dumped the first
goal, Brown again faked the oppos
ing guards and collected two more
goals, Heald got a free throw, and
then Barsocchini, former Washington
High flash from San Francisco flip
ped six straight points to put the
tilt on ice.
Parsons, heralded flash of the
squad, collected only one goal, but
his speed as a decoy and general ball
handling still mark him as a boy to
watch. Heald's height was invalu
able for backboard retrieving and
for feeding plays from the pivot spot.
Barsocchini's general floor, work was
outstanding.
The new combination of coaches
Phil Bengtson and Woodie Weir will
meet the Bronco freshman from
Santa Clara Friday night, and the
San Jose squad Saturday.
Practice sessions will resume to
day with probably more emphasis
on defensive strategy.
