The Stanford Rifle Team, one of
J the forgotten sports of the campus,
I is about to stage a comeback under
' the guidance and coaching of Harry
| Maloney, director of minor sports at
Stanford, and Wpsley Nowell, presi
dent of the Stanford Rifle and Pistol
| Club.
Several years ago, this sport was
j a very prominent one on the cam-
I pus, but it has been disintegrating
j during the past years until it is now
simply a practically unknown and
unheard-of minor sport.
The team was formed at the be
ginning of the fall quarter, 1941, and
to date it has received numerous
challenges for postal matches from
other universities throughout the
country, including the Universities of
Florida, Hawaii, and Wisconsin.
These challenges have not been ac
j cepted as yet because the Stanford
Club has not quite enough men as
j yet to take them all on.
The final match of the season will
j be the annual traditional match with
j Cal in the first week of March.
Due to the decided lack of men on
j the team at present, any male stu
! dent is eligible for the team and the
! Circle S award if he has had some
I previous experience on a high school
j team or any other team of repute,
i All those who can qualify are re
quested to sign up in the basement
i of the Administration Building this
j Tuesday night between 7:30 and 9.
