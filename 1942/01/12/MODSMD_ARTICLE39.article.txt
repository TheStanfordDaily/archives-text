### DON SELBY 
r United States Golf Associa
tion put an end to the argument
between George May, Tarn O'Shan
ter Golf Club prexy, and S. F. B.
Morse, president of the Del Monte
Properties Company, very simply
Saturday.
As yen know, the National
Amateur tourney was slated this
year for the scenic Pebble Beach
course hard by Carmel Bay. May
get the idea (hat. since the Rose
J Bowl and Shrine grid games had to
| be cancelled because of the war in
j the Pacific, perhaps the ocean
bound Pebble Beach layout was
n't too good a place for the big
tourney. Besides, he rather liked
the idea of Inning it on his own
course.
The result was that May requested
j the U.S.G.A, to move the tourney to
the Tam O'Shanter club, Chicago.
■ Morse, who, incidentally, was one of
Yale's greatest All-Americans, chal
lenged Tam O'Shanter's right to the
tourney inasmuch as it had already
been awarded to Del Monte. A brief
j long-distance verbal battle ensued
with neither gentleman gaining the
, advantage.

Saturday the U.S.G.A. abandoned
not only the National Amateur but
its three other tournaments as well,
ending the argument quite easily.
Tlie other three tourneys were the
National Open, the Women's Ama
teur, and the National Publie Links
tourney. The executive committee
s;iid that they abandoned the tour
naments this year in order that the
association might "focus its entire
attention on the nation's war effort."
In place of the cancelled tourna
ments ,the U.S.G.A. plans to have
exhibitions and other golf competi
tion for the benefit of war charities.
Thus far Congress lias urged
that sports be carried on as usual
to the greatest degree possible, with
which the U.S.G.A. decision does
n't seem to tie in at all. Just when
ether sports moguls are doing their
best to keep up the nation's mor
ale with as complete a sports pro
grain as possible, this body does
just the opposite.
Although the substitute exhibi
tions may be okay, there is no doubt
but what they will fall far short of
the four big tourneys, as far as na
tionwide interest is concerned. Then,
too, since most of the exhibitions
will be promoted independently, the
chances are that no one tourney will
draw the cream of the crop, as the
abandoned tourneys have done an
nually.
The decision conies a little
closer to home than most Stanford
students realize, because the Peb
ble Beach course is the home lay
rut of Bud Brownell, Stanford's
chief hope for golfing fame since
Lawson Little and Art Docring
quit the Farm.
The California Amateur is annually
played on the Pebble Beach links,
and, although he has participated al
most every year, Brownell has yet
to cop the duke. Yet that is no real
reason why he couldn't win the Na
tional Amateur, especially if it were
played on his home course.
But it won't be now!

VS7HEN the Stanford rooters at the
College of the Pacific-Stanford
basketball game Friday night put the
saddle on Joe Johns, an unidentified
woman said:
"My these kids are getting as
bad as the California rooting sec
tion!"
Of course, the fact that the con
test was no contest at all gave the
hooters and rooters little to do but
make it lough for Johns. But the
woman still came close to being
right.

"Hasn't Jack Dana the cutest
eyes?" This from an unescorted
girl near the press row.
Dana's teammates got that idea
quite some time ago and nick-named
him "Spook."

tourney. The executive committee

Thus far Congress lias urged
that sports be carried on as usual
to the greatest degree possible, with

best to keep up the nation's mor
ale with as complete a sports pro
grain as possible, this body does
just the opposite.
Although the substitute exhibi
tions may be okay, there is no doubt
but what they will fall far short of
the four big tourneys, as far as na
tionwide interest is concerned. Then,
too, since most of the exhibitions
will be promoted independently, the
chances are that no one tourney will
draw the cream of the crop, as the
abandoned tourneys have done an
nually.
The decision conies a little
closer to home than most Stanford
students realize, because the Peb
ble Beach course is the home lay
rut of Bud Brownell, Stanford's
chief hope for golfing fame since
Lawson Little and Art Docring
quit the Farm.
The California Amateur is annually
played on the Pebble Beach links,
and, although he has participated al
most every year, Brownell has yet
to cop the duke. Yet that is no real
reason why he couldn't win the Na
tional Amateur, especially if it were
played on his home course.
But it won't be now!

between George May, Tarn O'Shan

Amateur tourney was slated this
year for the scenic Pebble Beach
course hard by Carmel Bay. May

J Bowl and Shrine grid games had to

j the Pacific, perhaps the ocean
bound Pebble Beach layout was

tourney. Besides, he rather liked
the idea of Inning it on his own

the Tam O'Shanter club, Chicago.

r United States Golf Associa
tion put an end to the argument
between George May, Tarn O'Shan
ter Golf Club prexy, and S. F. B.
Morse, president of the Del Monte
Properties Company, very simply
Saturday.
As yen know, the National
Amateur tourney was slated this
year for the scenic Pebble Beach
course hard by Carmel Bay. May
get the idea (hat. since the Rose
J Bowl and Shrine grid games had to
| be cancelled because of the war in
j the Pacific, perhaps the ocean
bound Pebble Beach layout was
n't too good a place for the big
tourney. Besides, he rather liked
the idea of Inning it on his own
course.
The result was that May requested
j the U.S.G.A, to move the tourney to
the Tam O'Shanter club, Chicago.
■ Morse, who, incidentally, was one of
Yale's greatest All-Americans, chal
lenged Tam O'Shanter's right to the
tourney inasmuch as it had already
been awarded to Del Monte. A brief
j long-distance verbal battle ensued
with neither gentleman gaining the
, advantage.

Saturday the U.S.G.A. abandoned
not only the National Amateur but
its three other tournaments as well,
ending the argument quite easily.
Tlie other three tourneys were the
National Open, the Women's Ama
teur, and the National Publie Links
tourney. The executive committee
s;iid that they abandoned the tour
naments this year in order that the
association might "focus its entire
attention on the nation's war effort."
In place of the cancelled tourna
ments ,the U.S.G.A. plans to have
exhibitions and other golf competi
tion for the benefit of war charities.
Thus far Congress lias urged
that sports be carried on as usual
to the greatest degree possible, with
which the U.S.G.A. decision does
n't seem to tie in at all. Just when
ether sports moguls are doing their
best to keep up the nation's mor
ale with as complete a sports pro
grain as possible, this body does
just the opposite.
Although the substitute exhibi
tions may be okay, there is no doubt
but what they will fall far short of
the four big tourneys, as far as na
tionwide interest is concerned. Then,
too, since most of the exhibitions
will be promoted independently, the
chances are that no one tourney will
draw the cream of the crop, as the
abandoned tourneys have done an
nually.
The decision conies a little
closer to home than most Stanford
students realize, because the Peb
ble Beach course is the home lay
rut of Bud Brownell, Stanford's
chief hope for golfing fame since
Lawson Little and Art Docring
quit the Farm.
