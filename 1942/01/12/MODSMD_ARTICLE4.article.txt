# KUALA LUMPUR FATE IN DOUBT

### 
SINGAPORE, Jan. II (UP).—Up
country reports of savage fighting
above Kuala Lumpur and a com
munique announcing "no further
change in the situation" kindled
hope today that the main Japanese
drive on Singapore had lost some of
its momentum 200 miles or more to
the northwest.
The focal point of the sprawling
battle appeared to be frozen miles
northwest of Kuala Lumpur in the
Rawang area where the thinning
jungle gives way to coal and tin
mines linked with roads.
