# Your Right Place
## 
### 
YOU are a Stanford man. You're wondering
what to do about the draft. Uncle Sam is
going to dip into the cream of his crop again
Feb. 16. "R" Day once again is just a little over
a month away.
This time the registration will take a healthy
swipe at Stanford—even reaching into the fresh
man class for a goodly quota. Like other young
Americans, you realize the time has come to go
to war—either in the laboratories of the Uni
versity or in the machine shops of industry or
. . . behind a gun.
You know that if you are training to become
a technician or an engineer or a chemist or a
doctor your place is right here until you grad
uate.
You have a pretty good idea that your knowl
edge of blue prints or welding and any of a
thousand trades means that you should forfeit
school for an aircraft factory or a shipyard. To
make the question more pressing, the pay in
such work is an excellent inducement to the
individual. (The draftee and many economists
will argue that the pay for such work is out
rageous by comparison with twenty-one dollars
a day—once a month.)
If you find yourself in neither of the above
groups, you find yourself in a quandary. You
don't know what to do. You are physically fit
and a natural plum for the draft board. You
reason that the time, effort and expense re
quired to put you through as many years of
college as you have been here was meant to
pay off in dividends to your family and to
yourself.
But, on second thought, perhaps things are a
lot different now. You had the chance to go
to college because you live in a democracy.
Now, you reason, the time has come for that
training to pay off—by applying it, shoulder to
shoulder with the other college men, in the
defense of that democracy.
So, if it looks like you are going to be drafted
within a few months after registration, you
figure, now, that you can put that college edu
cation to better advantage, both for Uncle Sam
and for yourself, by seeking a commission.
There are all sorts of possibilities. The Army
Air Corps will be represented on the campus
this week, through Saturday. The Naval Air
Corps, Class V-5, has aready signed up over
half a hundred Stanford men. The Navy V-7
Class is taking even more; there is a large
number of Stanford undergraduate engineers
on the Navy roster. If you know geology or
geography or architecture there is an opening
waiting for you in the Navy's AVS. Most of
these different branches will permit you to grad
uate before taking you into the service or into
further intensive training.
If you have not exhausted all the possibili
ties along these lines, you will be interested to
know that Stanford's student co-ordinator of
defense will be waiting for you in Room 13,
Old Union, starting tomorrow, to answer ques
tions and present you with literature detailing
opportunities and requirements.
You will find there is a place in the service
for a man of your particular training and in
terests. —Harold Shafer

to college because you live in a democracy.
Now, you reason, the time has come for that
training to pay off—by applying it, shoulder to
shoulder with the other college men, in the
defense of that democracy.
So, if it looks like you are going to be drafted
within a few months after registration, you
figure, now, that you can put that college edu
cation to better advantage, both for Uncle Sam
and for yourself, by seeking a commission.
There are all sorts of possibilities. The Army
Air Corps will be represented on the campus
this week, through Saturday. The Naval Air
Corps, Class V-5, has aready signed up over
half a hundred Stanford men. The Navy V-7
Class is taking even more; there is a large
number of Stanford undergraduate engineers
on the Navy roster. If you know geology or
geography or architecture there is an opening
waiting for you in the Navy's AVS. Most of
these different branches will permit you to grad
uate before taking you into the service or into
further intensive training.
If you have not exhausted all the possibili
ties along these lines, you will be interested to
know that Stanford's student co-ordinator of
defense will be waiting for you in Room 13,
Old Union, starting tomorrow, to answer ques
tions and present you with literature detailing
opportunities and requirements.
You will find there is a place in the service
for a man of your particular training and in
terests. —Harold Shafer
YOU are a Stanford man. You're wondering
what to do about the draft. Uncle Sam is
going to dip into the cream of his crop again
Feb. 16. "R" Day once again is just a little over
a month away.
This time the registration will take a healthy
swipe at Stanford—even reaching into the fresh
man class for a goodly quota. Like other young
Americans, you realize the time has come to go
to war—either in the laboratories of the Uni
versity or in the machine shops of industry or
. . . behind a gun.
You know that if you are training to become
a technician or an engineer or a chemist or a
doctor your place is right here until you grad
uate.
You have a pretty good idea that your knowl
edge of blue prints or welding and any of a
thousand trades means that you should forfeit
school for an aircraft factory or a shipyard. To
make the question more pressing, the pay in
such work is an excellent inducement to the
individual. (The draftee and many economists
will argue that the pay for such work is out
rageous by comparison with twenty-one dollars
a day—once a month.)
If you find yourself in neither of the above
groups, you find yourself in a quandary. You
don't know what to do. You are physically fit
and a natural plum for the draft board. You
reason that the time, effort and expense re
quired to put you through as many years of
college as you have been here was meant to
pay off in dividends to your family and to
yourself.
But, on second thought, perhaps things are a
lot different now. You had the chance to go
to college because you live in a democracy.
