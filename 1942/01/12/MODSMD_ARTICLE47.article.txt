# The 						Human Element
## 
### 
THE all-pervading effects of modern total war
are vitally affecting in one way or another
every person in the country.
At Stanford there are not only the visible ef
fects of blackouts, name bands, student enlist
ment and the like, but the war will be felt in
many little ways not noticeable to most stu
dents. •

Activities are being hit hard and will suffer
more as things get tighter. They can operate
on reduced budgets, but it is the drop in student
participation which will hurt the most.
With heavier programs of study, proposed
six-day school week, three-year graduation, and
probable further enrollment drops, it would
seem on the surface that students just wouldn't
have time to spare for extra-curricular activities.
However, there are certain factors which
should be taken into consideration before you
drop out of an activity or decide against enter
ing one.
Most of us in college are preparing for some
form of service to the country during the emer
gency, whether it be as soldier, nurse, or any
of the many jobs to be done in civilian defense.
Concentrated study of our academic subjects
will better prepare us for entrance into any of
these fields. But studying, in most cases, is
principally an individual task, in which the
student attempts to exclude all outside factors
to the better accomplishment of his purpose.
But you cannot learn from a book how to deal
with other people, how to.assume your place
as an integral part of an organization, how to
take orders, and how to give them.

The value of academic training is recognized
in the present emergency. The ability to deal
with the human element is perhaps under
estimated.
Activities at Stanford provide you with an
opportunity to obtain that ability.
Instead of a dropping off of student interest
in activities because of the emergency, there
should be a definite up-swing. If more of you
turn out for publications, managerial posts,
committee work, the time taken away (not
lost) from academic work v/ill be lessened, but
you will still have the advantage to be gained
from taking part in these necessary broadening
adjuncts to college education.
The emphasis, too, on intramural sports
should not be allowed to lessen. Playing harder
is an inseparable corollary to studying harder.
In these ways can we get more out of college
and be of more value to our country when our
time comes to serve.

The emphasis, too, on intramural sports
should not be allowed to lessen. Playing harder
is an inseparable corollary to studying harder.
In these ways can we get more out of college
and be of more value to our country when our
time comes to serve.
THE all-pervading effects of modern total war
are vitally affecting in one way or another
every person in the country.
At Stanford there are not only the visible ef
fects of blackouts, name bands, student enlist
ment and the like, but the war will be felt in
many little ways not noticeable to most stu
dents. •

Activities are being hit hard and will suffer
more as things get tighter. They can operate
on reduced budgets, but it is the drop in student
participation which will hurt the most.
With heavier programs of study, proposed
six-day school week, three-year graduation, and
probable further enrollment drops, it would
seem on the surface that students just wouldn't
have time to spare for extra-curricular activities.
However, there are certain factors which
should be taken into consideration before you
drop out of an activity or decide against enter
ing one.
Most of us in college are preparing for some
form of service to the country during the emer
gency, whether it be as soldier, nurse, or any
of the many jobs to be done in civilian defense.
Concentrated study of our academic subjects
will better prepare us for entrance into any of
these fields. But studying, in most cases, is
principally an individual task, in which the
student attempts to exclude all outside factors
to the better accomplishment of his purpose.
But you cannot learn from a book how to deal
with other people, how to.assume your place
as an integral part of an organization, how to
take orders, and how to give them.

The value of academic training is recognized
in the present emergency. The ability to deal
with the human element is perhaps under
estimated.
Activities at Stanford provide you with an
opportunity to obtain that ability.
Instead of a dropping off of student interest
in activities because of the emergency, there
should be a definite up-swing. If more of you
turn out for publications, managerial posts,
committee work, the time taken away (not
lost) from academic work v/ill be lessened, but
you will still have the advantage to be gained
from taking part in these necessary broadening
adjuncts to college education.
