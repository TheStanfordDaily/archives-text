# War Wooing
## 
### 
THE University of Idaho Argonaut has aptly
expressed a general sentiment on war-time
popular songs. The Daily reprints the following
from their issue of January 6:
"There'll be Blue Birds Over the White
Cliffs of Dover." Bosh.
Continental and American composers have
sacrificed a noble profession on the altar of
sentiment. The above is a striking example
of evading an issue. True love can be ex
pressed in something besides tender lyric,
so why not bring popular songs up to the
tempo of the times?
For example, "You Look Cute in a Gas
Mask," "It's Harder to Dodge Love than
Bombs," "They Can Ration Tires, but Not My
Love for You," "Let's Make It a Blackout for
Two."
An American soldier on leave would feel
more romantic crooning "Tanks for the Mem
ory" than the age-old June-moon-spoon rou
tine, while bombs crashed about him. A
Modern Miss would feel more recipient to
ward "Let's Hold Hands in an Air Raid Shel
ter" than the haunting strains of "By the Light
of the Silvery Moon."
"My Love for You Is Hotter than an Incen
diary Bomb" would probably speed up
youth's emotional palpitations more than any
of the sentimental ballads now making the
rounds.
With a little co-operation from song plug
gers air men could soon wing their way
across the Far East chanting "She's the Sweet
heart of Pursuit Squadron Number Seven,"
in tune with the rattle of a machine gun.
What's the matter with substituting "When I
Go A-Bombing" for "When I Go A-Dream
ing"?
There are a thousand and one ways of im
proving this situation which has arisen, and
time should do it.
"Make Mine Manila."
Hold everything, Idaho; we'll send you our
Rally Committee.
