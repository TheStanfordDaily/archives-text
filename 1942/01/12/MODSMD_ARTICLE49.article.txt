# BULL SESSION
## HALF NOTES AND WHOLE NOTES 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
A NYONE who was in San Francisco last Saturday
and heard the music of the noted contemporary
composer Igor Stravinsky, is undoubtedly aware of
the confusion that exists in the world today, for his
music is a good expression of that confusion. Of course
his music includes some excellent parts, little sec
tions of real beauty that move the musical mind even
on the first hearing, but it is hard to deny that his
compositions have only the minimum amount of form
and order when compared to the classic composers.
And probably because of this comparative lack of
order, when one finishes hearing Stravinsky for a few
hours, there is no one definite feeling toward the
music. The listeners themselves become a little con
fused, like the music. They like it, and then they
aren't sure, and yet there is something good about it,
but they don't know what it is they like.
It is easier to have reasons for liking Beethoven
or Brahms and the other composers who seem to have
form and pattern. If you don't like anything else, you
can like the form itself, or you can hum one of the
themes and say, "I like that part right there." There
is often something definite that you yourself can
know about, even though it is often hard to put your
reasons into sensible words. But it is hard for me
to know even for myself why I like composers like
Stravinsky, without trying to put the reasons into
words. Maybe it's because we, or just because I,
haven't heard enough of the moderns, and yet maybe
Stravinsky himself doesn't know why his work has
musical value.

r |" , HERE was a goodly scattering of Stanford students
throughout the War Memorial Auditorium, show
ing that students around here aren't totally deaf to
one of the most interesting of the beauties. Some of
them were perched up in the boxes, I suppose because
they like to look down on people's heads, or because
they like the high altitude. Maybe it's because you
can hear better from up there, but not having ever
been up there, I don't know all the adavntages. Most
of the students, however, sat downstairs in the or
chestra.
Some of them seemed to always be saying by their
facial expressions, "What am I doing here, in a place
like this?" Others of course carried themselves like
their birth was performed to the accompaniment of a
concert by the Philadelphia Philharmonic, and these
mingled just the right amount of interest, with under
standing boredom, to give exactly the right effect. But
on the whole most of the Stanford students seemed to
have enjoyed the evening immensely. On the whole
there was something in Stravinsky for them. They
liked him and I liked him. But maybe it's just be
cause we are the children of a confused age, and have
something in common with the music. At any
rate, it will be interesting to see if such modern musical
compositions, and also the modern work in the other
fields of artistic expression, will stand the passage of
time and will be enjoyed in the future as they are
enjoyed today.
