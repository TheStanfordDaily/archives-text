# Bob Hope, Victor Moore Score In Lavish Musical
## 
### 
"LOUISIANA PURCHASE," now playing at the Fox-Stanford Theater
in Palo Alto.
When two such superb comedians as Bol> Mope and Victor Moore get
together in one show, it is hound to be good. And when they are both
given a field day, as they are in "Louisiana Purchase," it can't help hut

be funny.
Probably the first thing that hits
you about the picture is the lavish
ness of setting and costume, designed
by ace New York scenic artist Raoul
Pene du Bois. Unhampered by the
limits of stage space, he goes to town
and turns out some of the most gor
geous mountings seen in any Holly
wood musical. Natalie Kalmus' tech
nicolor direction is, of course, mag
nificent, and adds greatly to the gen
eral effect. Wait until you see the
New Orleans Mardi Gras sequence.
STAGE STARS
Imported from the New York pro
duction, besides Victor Moore, are
Zorina and Irene Bordoni. It is cer
tainly good to see the latter back in
the movies again, and she is still as
good a comedienne as ever. Zorina
does not have much chance to dance
—perhaps that is just as well, for
her one ballet number is pretty bad.
Not that she isn't a beautiful dancer,
but the movies still don't seem to
be able to do justice to ballet.
A new young lady makes her de
but in "Louisiana Purchase," taking
the part Carol Bruce had in the
original production. She is Dona
Drake, and she seems to be endowed
with a rubber body, no less. Not that
it isn't very nice rubber.
The show is full of catchy tunes,
written by the incomparable Irving
Berlin. Our favorite is "It's a Lovely
Day Tomorrow," which is, unfor
tunately, given a rather summary
treatment.
Although it is rather slow in spots,
perhaps owing to a too faithful ad
herence to the original script, "Lou
isiana Purchase" is an amusing show
with some hysterical moments. Wait
until you see Bob Hope's imitation of
a woman putting on a girdle, and
his filibuster in the state legislature,
when he reads all of "Gone With the
Wind." And of course the part of
Senator Oliver P. Loganberry was
made for Victor Moore who, as
usual, steals the show, even from
under suave Mr. Hope's ski-jump
nose.
Rounding out the program are
some good short subjects, including
a Mickey Mouse cartoon and the
current March of Time.—Livingston
