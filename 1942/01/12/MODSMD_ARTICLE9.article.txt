# Architecture Course To Consider Air Raids
## 
### 
Stanford University will offer, as one of its projects in the national de
fense program, a special defense course designed for architects and struc
tural engineers in air raid shelter construction.
This course will be given in San Francisco in the Ituss Building be
ginning next week for five Mondays from 7 to 9 p.m., according to Pro-

fessor Eugene L. Grant. Professor
Grant is in charge of Stanford's par
ticipation in the defends training
program of the United States Oifi/ce
of Education.
Conducted by Professor James B.
Wells of the School of Engineering,
the first lecture will deal with the
general details of air raid shelters.
Mr. Wells, who has made a study of
British experience with air raid shel
ters, has organized this five-week
course in such a way as to present
all the problems of construction to
the engineers.
The effects of bombs on large
buildings and the use of such build
ings for protection, the features of
small shelters for families or apart
ment houses, protection against in
cendiary bomb attacks, and protec
tion in the industrial ai'eas will be
the topics discussed in the lectures.
Assisting Professor Wells will be
three San Francisco consulting struc
tural engineers and two members of
the Board of Fire Underwriters of
the Pacific. Advance enrollment is
not necessary, he said.
