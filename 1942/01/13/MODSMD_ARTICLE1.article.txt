# History ... 1942
## 
### AMIE REICHERT 
'juns being a columnist is a sad
life in war time, not at all con
ducive to a nice disposition or a long,
happy life. Nowadays there is noth
ing at all to write about, at least
nothing that is fun to write about,
and still, every day there are those
15 inches waiting to be filled with
all sorts of pearls of wit and wis
dom, and, incidentally, history.
Well, history is being made
right and left, that is true, but it
is almost all of three kinds: (1)
the kind we don't know about be
cause the government doesn't
want to tell; (2) the kind (hat is
so discouraging that drawing ex
tra attention to it makes you feel
like an underminer of national
morale; and (3) rumors—like the
story about the 50,000 Japs invad
ing South America — which arc
fun, but not very solid either.
Before the U.S. got into this war,
I used to have an awfully good time
in this column. I cat-called and
name-called and behaved in a gen
erally undignified and obnoxious
manner to my little heart's desire,
and the displeasux*e of my readers
(2). I had a fine time with the
America First Committee and John
L. Lewis for a while, and the Sena
torial board of inquiry into the
movies, and a prominent statesman
and his secretary.

B UT those were the fat years, the
years in the fear tree, and ev
erything has changed now. This is
National Unity Year, in case you
didn't know it. And as a result no
body is acting up, or if they are it
is being hushed and you aren't sup
posed to talk about it because that
is unpatriotic.
And I say it is awfully hard to
be a columnist if you haven't any
thing to gripe about or to make
fun of, or at least be obnoxiously
dogmatic about.
But the worst tiling of all is that
I can't tell all I know. Military
secrets, you know. Naval secrets
too. Why, I venture to say I am
one of the ten people in the U.S.
that really knows where our fleet
is and what it is doing, but I am
under strict orders not to tell for
(hat would be giving aid and com
fort to the enemy.
I could analyze this whole situa
tion for you in a nutshell if the
government would only let me. I
could look into my short-wave set
and tell you exactly what is going to
happen in the next six months, if
the government would only let me.
My lips are sealed, as the saying
goes.

each of us has our cross
to bear, and I suppose that is
mine. This is National Emergency
Year and National Unity Year, and
I, along with the Senior Class, am
glad to make my little sacrifice.
The only thing I mind is losing
my readers (1 now). My little
sister was swell while she lasted.
I caught her listening to Kaltcn
foorn the other night. That's all
right, though- 1 don't mind. He
says the same thing 1 say (or vice
versa) but he isn't one of the ten
who know where the fleet is. On
the other hand, he gets paid. All
in all, I think I would rather be
him.
The linotyper around here is like
a father to me. He worries, you
know. He just looked over my shoul
der and shook his head in a sym
pathetic way. "When a columnist
turns inward," he said, "that's
really terrible."

B UT I can not help feeling justi
fied in this temporary lapse be
cause tomorrow night Walter Du
ranty, who knows almost as much
about the foreign situation as I do,
is coming to speak here at Stanford,
so he will be able to tell you all that
I could if my lips weren't sealed, as
the saying goes.
Mr. Duranty is one of the most
expert experts in the game today.
I remember that he predicted the
current Russian rout of the Nazi
forces way hack last July.
If you want to find out more about
him read today's "Bull Session" be
cause I have to go now and help
him write his speech.

be a columnist if you haven't any

But the worst tiling of all is that
I can't tell all I know. Military
secrets, you know. Naval secrets
too. Why, I venture to say I am

is and what it is doing, but I am
under strict orders not to tell for

The only thing I mind is losing
my readers (1 now). My little
sister was swell while she lasted.
I caught her listening to Kaltcn
foorn the other night. That's all
right, though- 1 don't mind. He
says the same thing 1 say (or vice
versa) but he isn't one of the ten
who know where the fleet is. On
the other hand, he gets paid. All
in all, I think I would rather be
him.
The linotyper around here is like
a father to me. He worries, you
know. He just looked over my shoul
der and shook his head in a sym
pathetic way. "When a columnist
turns inward," he said, "that's
really terrible."

B UT I can not help feeling justi

about the foreign situation as I do,
is coming to speak here at Stanford,

I could if my lips weren't sealed, as

Mr. Duranty is one of the most

'juns being a columnist is a sad
life in war time, not at all con

happy life. Nowadays there is noth
ing at all to write about, at least
nothing that is fun to write about,
and still, every day there are those
15 inches waiting to be filled with
all sorts of pearls of wit and wis
dom, and, incidentally, history.
Well, history is being made
right and left, that is true, but it
is almost all of three kinds: (1)
the kind we don't know about be
cause the government doesn't
want to tell; (2) the kind (hat is
so discouraging that drawing ex
tra attention to it makes you feel
like an underminer of national
morale; and (3) rumors—like the
story about the 50,000 Japs invad

fun, but not very solid either.

versa) but he isn't one of the ten
who know where the fleet is. On
the other hand, he gets paid. All
in all, I think I would rather be
him.
The linotyper around here is like
a father to me. He worries, you
know. He just looked over my shoul
der and shook his head in a sym
pathetic way. "When a columnist
turns inward," he said, "that's
really terrible."

B UT I can not help feeling justi
fied in this temporary lapse be
cause tomorrow night Walter Du
ranty, who knows almost as much
about the foreign situation as I do,
is coming to speak here at Stanford,
so he will be able to tell you all that
I could if my lips weren't sealed, as
the saying goes.
Mr. Duranty is one of the most
expert experts in the game today.
I remember that he predicted the
current Russian rout of the Nazi
forces way hack last July.
If you want to find out more about
him read today's "Bull Session" be
cause I have to go now and help
him write his speech.
'juns being a columnist is a sad
life in war time, not at all con
ducive to a nice disposition or a long,
happy life. Nowadays there is noth
ing at all to write about, at least
nothing that is fun to write about,
and still, every day there are those
15 inches waiting to be filled with
all sorts of pearls of wit and wis
dom, and, incidentally, history.
Well, history is being made
right and left, that is true, but it
is almost all of three kinds: (1)
the kind we don't know about be
cause the government doesn't
want to tell; (2) the kind (hat is
so discouraging that drawing ex
tra attention to it makes you feel
like an underminer of national
morale; and (3) rumors—like the
story about the 50,000 Japs invad
ing South America — which arc
fun, but not very solid either.
Before the U.S. got into this war,
I used to have an awfully good time
in this column. I cat-called and
name-called and behaved in a gen
erally undignified and obnoxious
manner to my little heart's desire,
and the displeasux*e of my readers
(2). I had a fine time with the
America First Committee and John
L. Lewis for a while, and the Sena
torial board of inquiry into the
movies, and a prominent statesman
and his secretary.

B UT those were the fat years, the
years in the fear tree, and ev
erything has changed now. This is
National Unity Year, in case you
didn't know it. And as a result no
body is acting up, or if they are it
is being hushed and you aren't sup
posed to talk about it because that
is unpatriotic.
And I say it is awfully hard to
be a columnist if you haven't any
thing to gripe about or to make
fun of, or at least be obnoxiously
dogmatic about.
But the worst tiling of all is that
I can't tell all I know. Military
secrets, you know. Naval secrets
too. Why, I venture to say I am
one of the ten people in the U.S.
that really knows where our fleet
is and what it is doing, but I am
under strict orders not to tell for
(hat would be giving aid and com
fort to the enemy.
I could analyze this whole situa
tion for you in a nutshell if the
government would only let me. I
could look into my short-wave set
and tell you exactly what is going to
happen in the next six months, if
the government would only let me.
My lips are sealed, as the saying
goes.

each of us has our cross
to bear, and I suppose that is
mine. This is National Emergency
Year and National Unity Year, and
I, along with the Senior Class, am
glad to make my little sacrifice.
The only thing I mind is losing
my readers (1 now). My little
sister was swell while she lasted.
I caught her listening to Kaltcn
foorn the other night. That's all
right, though- 1 don't mind. He
says the same thing 1 say (or vice
versa) but he isn't one of the ten
who know where the fleet is. On
