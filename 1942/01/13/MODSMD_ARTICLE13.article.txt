JOURNALISM SPONSORS
Sponsored by Theta Sigma Phi
and Sigma Delta Chi, women's and
men's journalism fraternities, Dui*-
anty, one of the greatest living for
eign correspondents, comes to Stan
ford directly from Tokio, which he
left just prior to the outbi'eak of the
Pacific war.
"All the world is now at war, and
the issues are to be seen clearly," he
stated recently. "The forces of Nazi-
Fascism, and of Japan have taken
their stand against our democi'atic
countiies, the United States and
Great Britain and China and the
Dutch Indies.
"With Bi'itain stand her empire,
the Dominion of Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, South Africa, and, last
but not least, India. Then, too, there
are Bx'itain's colonies, Malaya,
Malta, and the Afx'ican possessions."
THE ISSUE IS CLEAR'
"The issue," he contixxued, "is
clear, the fight for freedom and dem
ocracy against the hateful forces
which strive for world domination.
By strange irony of fate, our demo
cratic nations have with them a
mighty ally whose system is not like
ours. I x-efer to the U.S.S.R., whose
Constitution has no flaw fx*om the
democratic viewpoint, but whose
ways are not our way."
Priced at 55 cents, tax included,
tickets may also be purchased at the
Peninsula Box Office in Palo Alto.
