# CPTP Cancels Stanford Ground School as CAA Moves Inland 150 Miles
## Air Administration Cancels Pilot Program as Possibility of Ground Unit Is Dropped by University 
### 
Stanford Civilian Pilot Training Program plans were cancelled late
yesterday afternoon when Dr. David L. Webster, head of the Stanford
CPTP, received word from the Civil Aeronautics Administration "that it
is adopting a plan for having all ground school instruction, as well as
flight instruction more than 150 miles from the coast."

This definitely eliminates the pos-<
sibility of this type of instruction
here during the winter and spring
quarters. Students who had indi
cated a desire to take the course if
it were offered are being advised to
drop plans altogether or to enroll in
some university 150 miles from the
coast where the program is being
given. Most of the colleges operate
on the semester system and their
programs will begin February 1.
TRAINING SUCCESSFUL
The possibility of Stanford estab
lishing an extension unit away from
the coast was dismissed as imprac
ticable. The ground and flight train
ing courses were given during the
last summer quarter and proved very
successful, according to Dr. Web
ster. m
A few California schools will es
tablish extension units. A list of
these will be released January 14 by
the CAA and will be obtainable
from the CPTP secretary, Room 386,
Physics Building.
The text of the letter by Dr. Web
ster that is being sent to students
who had signed for the course
follows:
"Word has just been received
from the Civil Aeronautics Admin
istration that it is adopting a plan
for having all ground school in
struction, as well as flight instruc
tion more than 150 miles from the
coast. It is definitely more efficient
to give the flight and ground instruc
tion concurrently rather than at sep
arate times, so it must be agreed
this is the logical thing to do even
though we do x*egx*et the absence of
this instruction here.
EXTENSION UNIT OUT
JlSimui it- is impracticable for this ,
University to establish an extension
unit at that distance, it must be an
nounced that there will be no pilot
training program under the auspices
of the University this winter or
spring.
"Universities and colleges more
than 150 miles inland will carry on
as heretofore. Most of them will be
on the semester system, beginning
their spx*ing semester around Feb
ruary 1. Thei'e will also be a few
extension units established by some
other Califox*nia institutions. A list
of these will be made available to
us by the Civil Aeronautics Admin
istration on the afternoon of Wed
nesday. Januax*y 14, and may be ob
tained thereafter from the Civilian
Pilot Tx*aining .:ecretary, Room 386,
Physics Building."
