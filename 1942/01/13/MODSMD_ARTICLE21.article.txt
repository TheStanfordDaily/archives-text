BATAVIA, N.E.1., Jan. 12 (UP). â€”Allied air and naval forces, battling
to heat back the Japanese invasion tide from the Netherlands East Indies,
today ran up a 48-hour score of five Japanese warships damaged, six
transports sunk or damaged, and 10 airplanes shot down in the Malasia area.
Throwing open a string of 50 secret air bases in Borneo, one of the few

.surprises sprung on the Japanese in
this war, United States, Dutch and
Australian air forces fanned out 700
miles northwest to the Philippines
and 600 miles northwest to Singapore
to engage the Japanese in air bat
tles and blast their supply lines.
Meanwhile, Netherlands ground
forces fought desperately to hold oft
Japanese sea-borne and parachute
troops which landed Sunday on
Tarakan Island, an oil center oft
northeast Borneo, and at three places
in Minahassa, the northern finger of
the island of Celebes. The only in
formation reaching here was that
the Dutch were putting up "strong
resistance" and there was no indica
tion that they were giving ground.
