Addressing the house presidents of
all women's living groups at Wom

phase of the preparations made by
the University for defense and air

was left to each individual house.
Each house will have its deputy

made to fit the particular need of

several suggestions which the war

one be directly resi'jr.nsible to the
residence assistant or house mother.
