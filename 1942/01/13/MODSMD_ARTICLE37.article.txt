# Solons, Alpha Sigs Clash To Open Farm's Largest Intramural Hoop Season
## 
### NEWT WISE 
Alpha Sig will clash with the Legal Kagles. law school team, today at 'I
p.m. in the gym to touch oIT the mural fight for the basketball cham
pionship. The game will begin competition between 53 campus organi
zation teams, the largest number to ever clash in the mural hoop league.

Phi Psi I, last year's league win- 4
Tiers, will have back three of last
year's winning combination in the
trio of Denton, Demoss, and Ditlev
son. The Delt squad, last year's run-

ners-up, will have Joe Messina, Ed
Johnson, and Bob Kennedy back,
but have lost Thor Peterson, grad,
and Bob Scharbach, who's in the
Army.
Because of the unprecedented
number of teams signed up, it will
be necessary to play games at 4 and
5 p.m. in the gym, and at night at 7,
8, 9 p.m. in both the gym and the
Pavilion, it was announced by Red
Holman, intramural manager. This
i. l - the only way in which league
play-offs can be finished before
finals, Holman continued, urging
teams to be present when their games
are scheduled, and, if possible, not
to postpone games.
Schedule of play and the league
divisions will be posted on the mural
bulletin board in the Encina Gym,
and the schedule will be printed
each day in The Daily.
The teams have been divided up
into 10 leagues of 5 each and will
play a total of 32 games a week for
8 weeks before the final winner is
decided. Games will be played Mon
day through Thursday. No games
have been scheduled for Friday be
cause of varsity matches.
All teams must wear rubber-soled
shoes when on the gym floor, al
though gym clothes are optional.
League 3 promises to be the
roughest league of the season with
Phi Psi I, a strong squad, battling
it out with the Firehouse, a fast El
Capitan team led by Smiley Cam
eron, the Deke squad, and Phi
Kaps.
