# Coach Wolter Has Troubles
## 
### 
"From having what seemed to be
one of our best pitching staffs in
years, we're down to just one man
with any playing experience." So
does Harry Wolter, Farm baseball
mentor, sum up his 1942 diamond
prospects.
Not only is Wolter down to his
last twirler, Don Pendergrass, 1941
soph standout, but he has lost two
of his four starting veterans, Ace
Hanlon and Botch Caruso, via
| the scholastic route.
TWO GRADUATE
Wolter lost Claude Purkitt and
I Cootie Thompson, who played for
Hollywood Stars during the latter
part of last season, through gradua
tion.
Even then, Wolter thought he still
had Phil Wolf, righthander, and Russ
Smith, ace portsider, as well as Pen
dergrass and Larry Wolf, brother of
Phil, from the frosh.
Now Hanlon, Caruso, and Larry
Wolf are ineligible, Smith has joined
the Air Corps, and Phil Wolf is
classified 1-A and subject to imme
i diate call.
TWO REGULARS
This leaves but two regulars re
| turning from last year's club, Ray
Hammett, first base, and Carl Kellen
bergor, outfielder. Kellenberger
stayed out of school last quarter
and is now eligible.
About the only encouraging base
ball news now, according to Wolter.
is the prospect of a fairly strong
yearling outfit.
"We'll know more about that
later," he added.

Empty beer bottles will be granted
free entry into Argentina under a
ruling by the minister of finance.
