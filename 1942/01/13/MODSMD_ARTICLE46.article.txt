VOU KNOW, perhaps the Stanford baseball team will do something
j (his year.
VVe say this at the risk of being called a radical.
The thing is this: In the past Harry Wolter, who has been handling
Stanford hasehallers since way back "when," has had good teams before
the season started. That is. on paper they appeared to have all the requi
sites of championship clubs. But somehow or other they always managed

to end the season OUT of lirst place
in the California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association.
Now Wolter says he hasn't a thing.
So maybe the outfit will do okay.
See?
It certainly appears that Wolter
speaks fords of truth, though, for
j gone are Cootie Thompson, Claude
1 Purkitt, and Russ Smith, pitchers;
! Elton Bpone and Monte Pfyl, in
fielders; and Hal Costello, Alec Cere
ghino, and Glenn South, outfielders.
Those fellows aren't coming back.
Catcher Ace Hanlon and Infielder
Boch Caruso may be eligible by next
quarter, but they" will not be able
to play in the league game at the
end of winter quarter and the quar
tet of contests with Ucla and U.S.C.
during spring vacation.
The Wolf brothers, Larry and
Phil, both iptchers, are doubtful
quantities at the moment. Larry is
ineligible until spring quarter.
Phil, both pitchers, are doubtful
plication for the Naval Reserve is
accepted, he'll be around to do
some throwing for the Indians all
season.
Among the standouts, if there are
such on the Stanford club, are Clark
Kellenberger, outfielder; Clark Gra
ham, infielder; Ray Hammettj first
sacker; and Don Pendergrass, pitch
er. Harry Parsons played second
base two years ago, before Boch Ca
ruso won the job, and may take over
again this season. Twin brother Jack
Parsons is likely to get in playing
time also.
The catching spot, one of the
weak points of the Indian club for
the past couple of years, seems to
be poorly manned again, with
Ward Walkup the only experi
enced receiver, unless Herb At
kinson, a letterman two years ago,
stays in school and turns out.
Pendergrass is a plenty able
chucker, as his frosh record last year
attests; but he's a left-hander and a
team should have a few orthodox
flingers to keep its southpaw pitch
ers effective. To date Phil Wolf is
the only one who can fill that cate
gory. Bill Wilson, a sophomore who
has yet to play a bit of baseball in a
Stanford uniform, may be eligible
come spring quarter. And if he lives
up to his reputation as a strong right
handed pitcher, the Indian team
should improve rapidly in the last
two-thirds of the loop season.

WE'VE HEARD (he theory that
the injury sustained in bas
ketball last week by Larry Dee,
one of Stanford's leading tennis
players, is an example of what
happens when a top-notch athlete
in one sport goes out for another
sport.
Could be. But it seems to us that
Dee could have sprained his ankle
almost as easily walking down the j
Quad steps as the way he did.

WE'VE HEARD (he theory that
the injury sustained in bas
ketball last week by Larry Dee,
one of Stanford's leading tennis
players, is an example of what
happens when a top-notch athlete
in one sport goes out for another
sport.
Could be. But it seems to us that
Dee could have sprained his ankle
almost as easily walking down the j
Quad steps as the way he did.
VOU KNOW, perhaps the Stanford baseball team will do something
j (his year.
VVe say this at the risk of being called a radical.
The thing is this: In the past Harry Wolter, who has been handling
Stanford hasehallers since way back "when," has had good teams before
the season started. That is. on paper they appeared to have all the requi
sites of championship clubs. But somehow or other they always managed

to end the season OUT of lirst place
in the California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association.
Now Wolter says he hasn't a thing.
So maybe the outfit will do okay.
See?
It certainly appears that Wolter
speaks fords of truth, though, for
j gone are Cootie Thompson, Claude
1 Purkitt, and Russ Smith, pitchers;
! Elton Bpone and Monte Pfyl, in
fielders; and Hal Costello, Alec Cere
ghino, and Glenn South, outfielders.
Those fellows aren't coming back.
Catcher Ace Hanlon and Infielder
Boch Caruso may be eligible by next
quarter, but they" will not be able
to play in the league game at the
end of winter quarter and the quar
tet of contests with Ucla and U.S.C.
during spring vacation.
The Wolf brothers, Larry and
Phil, both iptchers, are doubtful
quantities at the moment. Larry is
ineligible until spring quarter.
Phil, both pitchers, are doubtful
plication for the Naval Reserve is
accepted, he'll be around to do
some throwing for the Indians all
season.
Among the standouts, if there are
such on the Stanford club, are Clark
Kellenberger, outfielder; Clark Gra
ham, infielder; Ray Hammettj first
sacker; and Don Pendergrass, pitch
er. Harry Parsons played second
base two years ago, before Boch Ca
ruso won the job, and may take over
again this season. Twin brother Jack
Parsons is likely to get in playing
time also.
The catching spot, one of the
weak points of the Indian club for
the past couple of years, seems to
be poorly manned again, with
Ward Walkup the only experi
enced receiver, unless Herb At
kinson, a letterman two years ago,
stays in school and turns out.
Pendergrass is a plenty able
chucker, as his frosh record last year
attests; but he's a left-hander and a
team should have a few orthodox
flingers to keep its southpaw pitch
ers effective. To date Phil Wolf is
the only one who can fill that cate
gory. Bill Wilson, a sophomore who
has yet to play a bit of baseball in a
Stanford uniform, may be eligible
come spring quarter. And if he lives
up to his reputation as a strong right
handed pitcher, the Indian team
should improve rapidly in the last
two-thirds of the loop season.
