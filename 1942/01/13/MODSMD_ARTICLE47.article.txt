# Cards Prepare For Broncos, Blackouts
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball pavilion will j
be ready for any and all blackouts j
by Friday night, when the Indians
tackle Santa Clara. Windows will |
be painted black and the home gym I
will be light-proof throughout.
Eddie Voss was back in harness
yesterday after a week's absence.
His addition will put the club at full
strength for Friday's game.
DEFENSE SLIPS
Something happened to the great
defensive game that the Indians put
up for the first half last week against
St. Mary's.
Coming off the floor at the half
with a 12-point lead, the Redskins
looked all over a winner with 20
minutes to go. But that smoothly
functioning zone went haywire "for
the duration" of the latter period,
and Stanford was hard pressed to
hold its advantage to the final gun.
Coach Everett Dean worked on the
defense yesterday, and Friday we'll
set a zone defense as tight as human
arms and legs can make it.
PATRICK TERRIFIC
Local fans are due for an eyeful
of real basketball in the Broncs' field
goaling sensation, Stan Patrick. This
Irish lad consistently runs up high
scores and Bay area sports writers
have lately been booming him to top
Hank Luisetti's all-time scoring rec
ord.
We'll hardly pick the amazing Pat
rick to do just that, but at any rate
he'll be in our hair Friday.
Earlier in the practice season dur
ing winter vacation Stanford bowed
to Santa Clara 21-31. Jimmy Pollard
was not eligible at the time, but Fri
day Stanford will have an "all-out
attack ready to advance on all fronts.
