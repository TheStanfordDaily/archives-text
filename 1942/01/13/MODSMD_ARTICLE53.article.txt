# On the State of the Nation, 1942, With Apologies to Mr. Roosevelt
## 
### 
MOST Americans have come to realize that
we are at war, that the time has come lor
swift, decisive action. They are willing to bear
linancial sacrifice and temporary curtailment
of many personal rights and liberties to aid the
war effort.

In the armed forces a man does what his su
perior orders ... or else; and that man was
ordered to give those orders by his superior
officer. That is the only accepted way to gov
ern an army or a navy. When fighting a war
it would seem rather absurd if the general
called in a representative from each outfit to
ask them whether they thought his plan of
action was all right.

But in civil life under the democratic way,
this country has perfected a system where the
common people, you and I, through our popu
larly elected representatives, do the govern
ing.

We are fighting this war against three coun
tries which say they don't like our system. They
like the army plan for governing their peoples.
And they want to impress that system on us.
Politely it is called dictatorship, but actually it
just about amounts to slavery.
That is why we are fighting this war, to keep
this system which we have grown up with,
which has made us one of the greatest countries
in the world.

This democratic system isn't made for waging
war. It is a peaceful system.
But when it becomes necessary to fight a
war, we will show them that we can fight too.
We have already seen that some of these lib
erties we have grown accustomed to have been
put on the shelf "for the duration." More will
undoubtedly soon be added to the list.
The people know that this wider assumption
of power by their government is enabling it to

put up a much stronger fight against the Axis
powers. The good thing about a democracy is
that these people know, when they relinquish
rights and liberties in the common cause of win
ning the war, that these are only on the shelf.
They know they can trust their democratic gov
ernment to return these powers to the people
when it is safe to do this.

With so many more powers being vested in
the government in the past couple of years,
there has, of course, been a great deal of ineffi
ciency. Much of this is to be expected, and the
people realize that it cannot be helped.
There are some things the government is
doing, however, which do not exactly meet with
the approval of the people. Americans have
rallied patriotically behind the call for national
unity. But when they read about their leaders,
legislators they have chosen to represent them,
executives, delaying the war and defense effort
by still dabbling in petty politics, they wonder
a little about all this power.
They would never want to see the two-party
system junked for mere rubber-stamp legislative
activity. A minority is essential to democracy.
But the people still do not like to see speed
and efficiency in government sacrificed to per
sonal jealousies, political self-seeking, unneces
sary bickering. It is hoped that they will check
up on the records of their representatives when
elections come up this fall.

Our democratic way of life is at stake. Na
tional Unity should not be allowed to become a
deceiving catch phrase. It should be all-inclu
siveâ€”the people, the government, capital, labor,
and the armed forces.
