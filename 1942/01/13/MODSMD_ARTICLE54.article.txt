# "Don't Get Married," He Says
## 
### 
A MILLS COLLEGE professor specializing
in "Marriage and the Family" courses ad
vises college and high school women to stay
in school and not to get married during the
war emergency.
Marriages of people under 21 are twice as
likely to be unhappy as those of people over
that age, he claims. And he added—hitting an
optimistic low — that women should stay in
school because they may need the training to
support themselves after they become "war
widows."

But marriages in San Francisco, for instance,
are up 150 per cent over last year and are fast
approaching the all-time highs of 1917-18.
And at the rate the engagement and wedding
announcements have been pouring in to The
Daily this year, there are not very many Stan
fordites heeding these warnings.
