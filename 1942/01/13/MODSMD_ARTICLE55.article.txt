# Seeing-Eye Special
## 
### 
THOSE Daily staff members not at Fort What
chamajiggy or at Red Cross nursing school—
well, both of us—will meet at 2 this drafternoon
to discuss dirtier ways of spelling Hitler and
Japan. The Seeing-Eye Foundation and the
Knotty Pine Artificial Limb Company have gra
ciously contributed dogs and wooden legs so
that we can make the Cellar for the usual
rounds of adrenalin.
Or, as they say in England: "Bums show up."
