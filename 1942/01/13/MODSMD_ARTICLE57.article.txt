far-sighted international observers, the question
of what Russia will do if the Allies are successful
in winning the war has been and still is very puzzling.
No doubt if the Hitler movement is stopped, the Rus
sians under the leadership of Joseph Stalin must be
given a great amount of credit, and they will be in a
position to make all sorts of demands. Some people
think that the Russians will be perfectly willing to
merely keep the territory that she now owns, and do
everything possible to co-operate with the rest of the
world in preserving peace. But others maintain that
according to the Communistic doctrine, and Russia is
still Communistic, the Russians have the one main
purpose of spreading their teachings throughout the
world.

According to definition, Communism is an interna
tional project, and before it can be worked with com
plete success, the whole world must be using that
system. And so many observers feel that the Russians
will take advantage of their strong position when the
time comes, and that they will do everything they can
to push their Communistic doctrines on to all the
other countries. Some observers are pessimistic or
realistic enough to maintain that after Hitler and the
Japanese and that gang are done away with, the Allies
will have to turn around and fight the Russians unless
they are ready to accept Bolshevism. Of course no one
really knows what the Russians will do, what they
are planning and thinking about. But if you are inter
ested and would like some hints on that subject and
many other subjects, I suggest you go hear the famous
war correspondent, Walter Duranty.

OIGHT now of course is the time when everyone
with a loud voice starts screaming. There is talk,
advice, suggestions, inside information, and such float
ing around everywhere. Most of it has no factual basis.
That is why a man like Mr. Duranty, who has a back
ground on the situations he is going to discuss, is so
valuable. Mr. Duranty is an expert on the Far East
and on Russia, and if there is anyone who should be
welcome right now, it should be an expert on the Far
East and Russia. Mr. Duranty has spent a great por
tion of his life in these places, ho knows the people,
he knows many of the governmental leaders and he
knows their policies, and not from hearsay and from
reports, but from actually seeing and talking for him
self. And Mr. Duranty has published several books,
short stories, articles and is a Pulitzer Prize winner.
Add to this the fact that he has a pleasing voice and
is very easy to understand, and you have enough
reasons for visiting the Memorial Auditorium tomor
row evening.
There is a slight charge, of course, 55 cents includ
ing tax. Mr. Duranty is being sponsored by the Men's
and Women's Journalism Fraternities, and they will
receive the money. Tickets can be obtained from the
A.S.S.U. office and my advice is that you buy your
ticket in advance.

According to definition, Communism is an interna
tional project, and before it can be worked with com
plete success, the whole world must be using that
system. And so many observers feel that the Russians
will take advantage of their strong position when the
time comes, and that they will do everything they can
to push their Communistic doctrines on to all the
other countries. Some observers are pessimistic or
realistic enough to maintain that after Hitler and the
Japanese and that gang are done away with, the Allies
will have to turn around and fight the Russians unless
they are ready to accept Bolshevism. Of course no one
really knows what the Russians will do, what they
are planning and thinking about. But if you are inter
ested and would like some hints on that subject and
many other subjects, I suggest you go hear the famous
war correspondent, Walter Duranty.

OIGHT now of course is the time when everyone
with a loud voice starts screaming. There is talk,
advice, suggestions, inside information, and such float
ing around everywhere. Most of it has no factual basis.
That is why a man like Mr. Duranty, who has a back
ground on the situations he is going to discuss, is so
valuable. Mr. Duranty is an expert on the Far East
and on Russia, and if there is anyone who should be
welcome right now, it should be an expert on the Far
East and Russia. Mr. Duranty has spent a great por
tion of his life in these places, ho knows the people,
he knows many of the governmental leaders and he
knows their policies, and not from hearsay and from
reports, but from actually seeing and talking for him
self. And Mr. Duranty has published several books,
short stories, articles and is a Pulitzer Prize winner.
Add to this the fact that he has a pleasing voice and
is very easy to understand, and you have enough
reasons for visiting the Memorial Auditorium tomor
row evening.
There is a slight charge, of course, 55 cents includ
ing tax. Mr. Duranty is being sponsored by the Men's
and Women's Journalism Fraternities, and they will
receive the money. Tickets can be obtained from the
A.S.S.U. office and my advice is that you buy your
ticket in advance.
WALTER DURANTY
far-sighted international observers, the question
of what Russia will do if the Allies are successful
in winning the war has been and still is very puzzling.
No doubt if the Hitler movement is stopped, the Rus
sians under the leadership of Joseph Stalin must be
given a great amount of credit, and they will be in a
position to make all sorts of demands. Some people
think that the Russians will be perfectly willing to
merely keep the territory that she now owns, and do
everything possible to co-operate with the rest of the
world in preserving peace. But others maintain that
according to the Communistic doctrine, and Russia is
still Communistic, the Russians have the one main
purpose of spreading their teachings throughout the
world.
