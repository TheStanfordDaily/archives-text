# CAMPUS OPINION
## ROW RUMORS EXPLODED 
### 
r JpHE EDITOR, SIR:
This year again, as for many years past, a few
misconceptions are being held by Encinamen about
the important, yet altogether too little understood finan
cial aspects of the Row. Unfortunately, the question
has never been dealt with openly by the individual
houses; but this year the University auditor. Mr. War
ren M. Turner, gathered and published the pertinent
data, including the amounts of house bills, initiation
fees, wages to employees, hashers, and house manag
ers, and a few other details. To explode rumors of
exaggerated house bills, here is a summary of the
data gathered by Mr. Turner.
The monthly base-bill, including room, board, and
dues, ranges from a low of $52 to a high of $59.50, with
both the median and average at slightly over $56. There
is an additional charge of about $2 a month for milk
in eight of the houses, and the members' laundry and
cleaning is usually charged to his house-bill. The only
other addition would be a special-assessment to cover
the cost of an off-campus dance or similar event, and
virtually all of these will be eliminated for "the dura
tion." Initiation fees range from $50 to $75, with the
average here at $01.50. There are eleven members in
the smallest and thirty-eight in the largest fraternity,
but this apparently has no significance on the amount
of the house bill.
For those interested, the Dean of Men's Office would
be glad to give a more detailed picture—and they can
mention names.
