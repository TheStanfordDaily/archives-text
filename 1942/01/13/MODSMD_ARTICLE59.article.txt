"MISSION TO MOSCOW," by (he
former Ambassador to the U.S.S.R.,
Joseph E. Davics. Published by
Simon and Schuster. Price $.'5.

The appointment of Mr. Davies, a
man who has made no secret of his
caiptalistic interests, as Ambassador
to the U.S.S.R. may have seemed
strange at the time, but with the
publication of his new book, "Mis
sion to Moscow," all doubts as to
the wisdom of the appointment were
removed. A more accurate and pre
cise evaluation of present-day Rus
sia has probably never before been
presented. This is in most part due
to Mr. Davies' ability as a reporter
and observer, and also due to the
fact that the State Department has
broken all precedents in allowing
confidential material to be released.
Usually the material is rarely re
elased and then only when the news
is stale.
CONFIDENTIAL NEWS
The book is entirely composed of
confidential State Department dis
patches, and excerpts from Mr. Dav

ies' diary and personal and official
letters.
Davies arrived in the U.S.S.R. in
193G and attended the famous spy
trials at that time. His confidential
reports are especially interesting as
he possesses a trained legal mind.
In his opinion most of the people
tried were guilty of the crimes
charged. He justifies the brutality
trials in that they succeeded in
eliminating Hitler's potential fifth
columnists. Russia today has no
fifth column marching on Moscow,
and this Davies attributes to the
weeding out of the Tuture Quislings
before they got a foothold.
RESPECTED RED AKMY
Mr .Davies closely inspected Rus
sias' industrial plants and the vast
Red Army. Unlike Col. Lindbergh
and other observers of the time, he
found the Red Army to be adequate
and capable. In the light of recent
reports, his seem to be the more ac
curate of the reports.
Other predictions, which may turn
out to be equally true, make this
book especially valuable.
