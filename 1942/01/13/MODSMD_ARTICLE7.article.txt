The Palo Alto Selective Service
Board, in order to clarify px*oblems
which may arise in the coming Feb-

ruary 16 registration, issued a state
ment yesterday concerning the status
of Stanford men thx*ough Mrs. Estelle
Wheatley, secretary of the Palo Alto
Selective Service Boai*d.

The Selective Service Board wants
it undex*stood that all men born on
or befox*e December 31, 1921, must
register February 16. This includes
all men who are in the R.O.T.C. or
in the Navy's V-7 class.

This, however, does not mean that
men who have px*eviously registered
should again register. The draft
board also emphasized the fact that,
though it is optional whether one
registers from his home or campus
addi'esses, it will greatly facilitate
matters if all students register ab
sentee at their home addresses.

Up to November, 1941, the Palo
Alto Selective Sex*vice Board had
registex*ed 5,149 men, of which 222
have already been selected. All men
