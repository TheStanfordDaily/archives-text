# Speedy Sign-up Seen for State
## 
### 
Those Californians subject to Se
lective Service sign-up Feb. 16, 1942,
as potential selectee-soldiers in the
armed forces of the nation, can look
forward to a speedy registration and
classification.
Local boards throughout the
state are being geared for unprece
dented acceleration in an all-out ef
j fort to meet the exigencies created
J by the war.
From 1500 to 200 temporary
boards will be located through the
state where registration will be
taken. They are being established
to attain top speed in registration to
prevent unnecessary hardship for
the registrant living long distances
I from established boards.
