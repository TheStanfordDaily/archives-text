### AMIE REICHERT 
r JMIE SIEGE of Leningrad is broken.
After seven months of almost
unrelenting assault which kept the
3 million people of the old Czarist
capital cut off from the rest of the
world, word came yesterday that
the German lines had disintegrated
and food trains from the east were
rolling into the city.
This news is typical of the re
ports which have come out of Rus
sia for the past month. On ail
fronts the Germans are being
hurled back with relentless fury,
their communications are l>eing
cut, their soldiers slaughtered by
the tens of thousands.
The Russian drive to regain what
was lost in the initial stages of Hit
ler's de-blitzed blitzkrieg has gath
ered momentum with each week.
What looked like a German "stra
tegic withdrawal" at first has in
fact become a rout—the first German
defeat of World War 11, a defeat
which is daily laying the foundation
for the disastrous collapse which
will surely overtake the Nazi re
gime.

MP HE principal drives against the
invaders are in the Crimea, the
region southwest of Moscow, and
south of Leningrad. The strategy of
the Red Army has been to form a
pincers in the direction of Vyazma
and Smolensk. Yesterday the Rus
sians l'ecaptured Kirov, 100 miles
southeast of Smolensk on the Mos
cow-Kiev railway line, and also
Vorokhov, GO miles west of Moscow.
United Press reports that "fierce
Mohammedan tribesmen arc
streaming through the Caucasus
mountains to join the Russian
army's midwinter offensive." This
is making things pretty hot for
Dcr Fuehrer, who, it is reported,
moved his headquarters yester
day from Smolensk to an undis
closed place in the South.
Yes, Hitler has had a lot of wor
ries since he assumed command of
his armies and rushed to the front
to read Mein Kampf to them. Be
sides the prospect of a bayonet in
his rear, now he has to worry about
replacing the 25 crack generals he
cashiered when he got his Great
Call, and rushing reserves from
home to fill out the fast-thinning
German ranks.

r JPHE Russians, on the other hand,
still have tremendous reserves
of manpower to throw against the
Nazis who are running so fast one
might mistake them for their Italian
chums.
And Stalin, so far as we know,
lias had no Great Call, no sudden
revelation or insight, which would
lead him to purge his best gen
erals and (jo down to the front to
read Das Capital to the Ilcds. They
don't need it.
The fanaticism of the Russians in
this great battle is a thing which the
democratic states will never cease to
marvel at. H. R. Knickerbocker be
lieves that they are fighting not so
much for something, as against it,
which one might say is equally true
of Britain and the U.S. and—in fact
—all the foes of Naziism today.

B UT Knickerbocker claims that
hatred of Fascism—in all forms
—has become a positive faith with
the Communists. It is not a negative
faith. The sacrifices and deeds of
courage it calls foi'th belie that.
This generation of Communists
in Russia has been weaned 011 a
hatred of Fascism so savage and
so overpowering as to make Dr.
Goebbcls' and Julius Streichcr's
efforts lok like Sunday School les
sons.
And the result, says Knicker
bocker, is that they hate Fascism far
more than Americans love liberty.
That sort of faith is almost incred
ible to us. It could only be instilled
through fear and terror and propa
ganda of the sort that totalitarian
states know how to dish out.
To say that the Russian soldier to
day is fighting for land or love of
country or preservation of the Com
munist way of life does not. begin to
answer the question of "What makes
Russia run?" (or would it be closer
to fact at this moment to ask "What
makes Hitler run?"). Whether Stalin
intends to run this faith through
Europe we shall see.

After seven months of almost
unrelenting assault which kept the
3 million people of the old Czarist
capital cut off from the rest of the
world, word came yesterday that
the German lines had disintegrated
and food trains from the east were
rolling into the city.
This news is typical of the re
ports which have come out of Rus
sia for the past month. On ail
fronts the Germans are being
hurled back with relentless fury,
their communications are l>eing

was lost in the initial stages of Hit
ler's de-blitzed blitzkrieg has gath

What looked like a German "stra
tegic withdrawal" at first has in

defeat of World War 11, a defeat
which is daily laying the foundation
for the disastrous collapse which
will surely overtake the Nazi re

MP HE principal drives against the

Yes, Hitler has had a lot of wor

cashiered when he got his Great

revelation or insight, which would

The fanaticism of the Russians in
this great battle is a thing which the
democratic states will never cease to
marvel at. H. R. Knickerbocker be
lieves that they are fighting not so
much for something, as against it,

of Britain and the U.S. and—in fact

B UT Knickerbocker claims that
hatred of Fascism—in all forms
—has become a positive faith with
the Communists. It is not a negative
faith. The sacrifices and deeds of

This generation of Communists
in Russia has been weaned 011 a
hatred of Fascism so savage and
so overpowering as to make Dr.
Goebbcls' and Julius Streichcr's
efforts lok like Sunday School les
sons.
And the result, says Knicker
bocker, is that they hate Fascism far
more than Americans love liberty.
That sort of faith is almost incred
ible to us. It could only be instilled
through fear and terror and propa
ganda of the sort that totalitarian
states know how to dish out.
To say that the Russian soldier to

makes Hitler run?"). Whether Stalin

r JMIE SIEGE of Leningrad is broken.
After seven months of almost
unrelenting assault which kept the
3 million people of the old Czarist
capital cut off from the rest of the
world, word came yesterday that
the German lines had disintegrated
and food trains from the east were
rolling into the city.
This news is typical of the re
ports which have come out of Rus
sia for the past month. On ail
fronts the Germans are being
hurled back with relentless fury,
their communications are l>eing
cut, their soldiers slaughtered by
the tens of thousands.
The Russian drive to regain what
was lost in the initial stages of Hit
ler's de-blitzed blitzkrieg has gath
ered momentum with each week.
What looked like a German "stra
tegic withdrawal" at first has in
fact become a rout—the first German
defeat of World War 11, a defeat
which is daily laying the foundation
for the disastrous collapse which
will surely overtake the Nazi re
gime.

MP HE principal drives against the
invaders are in the Crimea, the
region southwest of Moscow, and
south of Leningrad. The strategy of
the Red Army has been to form a
pincers in the direction of Vyazma
and Smolensk. Yesterday the Rus
sians l'ecaptured Kirov, 100 miles
southeast of Smolensk on the Mos
cow-Kiev railway line, and also
Vorokhov, GO miles west of Moscow.
United Press reports that "fierce
Mohammedan tribesmen arc
streaming through the Caucasus
mountains to join the Russian
army's midwinter offensive." This
is making things pretty hot for
Dcr Fuehrer, who, it is reported,
moved his headquarters yester
day from Smolensk to an undis
closed place in the South.
Yes, Hitler has had a lot of wor
ries since he assumed command of
his armies and rushed to the front
to read Mein Kampf to them. Be
sides the prospect of a bayonet in
his rear, now he has to worry about
replacing the 25 crack generals he
cashiered when he got his Great
Call, and rushing reserves from
home to fill out the fast-thinning
German ranks.
