# Farm Checks Today On Bawlout Proofs
## 
### 
If you want to make dead sure
that your grades came out like
they did or didn't, if you want the
folks back home to get an accu
rate idea of your Stanford ad
dress, spelling, and scholastic rat
ing, or if you are just a wee bit
curious, bawl-out proofs await you
in front of the Ad Building today.
From 8 to 5 students can check
their vital statistics as they will
appear in the "Directory of Offi
cers and Students," and office offi
cials urge every Stanfordite to ex
amine the list to correct any er
rors. Listed will be the name, home
town, grade average, address, and
mailing address. For some 700
freshmen the terse LD for new
students will be replaced for the
first time with the magical "plus"
or the mistifying "minus."
