# Excom Bans Dorsey Prom
## Branner Gets Go-ahead On Charity Ball Financial Reasons Plus Campus Opinion Alter Dorsey Ruling 
### BUD AMES 
In the most confused meeting of
the year, Excom last night red
lighted Senior Class plans to have
Tommy Dorsey at their Prom, and
in the next moment gave the go
ahead to a Stanford Charity Ball on
Friday, Pfcb. 13, as proposed by
Jerry Stoner, president of Branner.
Stoner's Hollywoodish extravagan
za presentation, which even included
playing records of bands in order to
sell Excom on the proposed Charity
Ball, followed Isabelle Fawcett's
lengthy five-minute motion, which
when passed by the Executive Com-

mittee and pared down, rescinded
last week's motion which okayed
Tommy Dox*sey, "a big name band,"
for the Senior Prom. Henceforth, for
the duration, thei'e shall be no more
"big name bands" at campus func
tions.
BALL FOR RED CROSS
Purpose of the Charity Ball,
though sponsored and fostei'ed by
the Bijanner Club, will be to swell
the coffers of the Red Cross.
At the same time as Excom heat
edly threw Tommy Dorsey and fu
ture big name bands into the "for
uiture-refex'ence" pigeon hole, the
Senior Class Executive Committee
working in a nearby room, but to
tally unaware of Executive Commit
tee's about-face throat-cutting,
passed a similar motion; namely,
that the Senioi's no longer favored a
big-name band for their Prom â€”still
scheduled for Feb. 27.
PERRING COMMENTS
Said Peggy Perring. vice-president
of the Senior Class last night: "It
was felt, we should have the Senior
Prom, but not with Tommy Dorsey.
We will probably have some type of
affair this quax'ter."
Bill Cowden, class president, could
not be reached for comment.
Commenting on the reason for the
about-face ashcanning of Tommy
Dorsey in the face of last week's
okay, Student Manager Jim McKel
lar stated:
PICTURE CHANGED
"Since last week, recent develop
ments, both financial and otherwise,
have entix*ely changed the picture.
We no longer feel that the dance
would make money. Since the Senior
Class based their plea last week on
their financial need, their ai'gument
has now been swept away.
"Besides, I now leai'n the Seniors
have decided against Tommy Dorsey
anyway."
CONFUSION REIGNED
Confusion ruled the entire Excom
meeting. Closed dates wei"e re
opened, then reelosed again as Bill
Moran, dramatic manager, added his
protests to the overlapping of the
Charity Ball with his department's
One-Act Plays, scheduled for the
same week-end. The one-acts will
be presented on the original dates,
