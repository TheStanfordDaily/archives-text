the last that counts most in war.
Specifically Duranty states:
"The U.S.S.R. was attacked by
Germany without warning or provo

iantly. I have no shadow of doubt
that the U.S.S.R. will co-operate
with the United States, Great Brit
ain, China, and Holland, in the war
against Japan.
"I regard Japan's war against us
as a suicidal venture, intended per
haps to disguise the failure of
Japan's attack upon China.
"Japan has gained some initial
successes by its treacherous stab in
the back but, as Secretary Stimson
said, the blow which counts most in
war is not the first but the last."
Duranty's new book, "The Kremlin
and the People," is just off the press
