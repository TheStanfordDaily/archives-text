# Hills Named Pledge Prom Chairman
## 
### 
Appointment of Bud Hills to
chairman of the annual Pledge Prom,
Feb. 6, was about the only final ac
tion taken by the Interfraternity
Council in its meeting at the Delta
Upsilon house last night.
Meanwhile, rushing continues with
a second open house period tonight
and tomorrow night. Just as in the
last period, no cards will be sent out
and visiting will last from 7 to 9:30.
Fi-eshmen are cordially invited to
attend any house they wish.
Leading in ultimate importance at
the meeting was a recommendation
moved by Sandy Tatum, Zete, to
the Interfraternity Board that bars
be lowered on students on proba
tion living outside the house.
QUIET HOURS IMPROVE
With the enforcement of quiet
hours in fraternities, Tatum argued
that study conditions will be as good
or better than they would be for
students eating meals at the house
but living outside. The recom
mendation was passed almost unani
mously.
Enforcement of quiet hours was
strongly recommended by the coun
cil not only to encourage students on
probation and grad students to live
in the house but mainly because of
restrictions on studying on the
Quad.
SUGGESTION DROPPED
A suggestion that the number of
fraternity members in one class be
raised from 14 to 15 or 16 was tenta
tively dropped after some discus
sion.
Blackout and air raid organization
within the houses was discussed. "We
want to be prepared for anything if
it happens," stated President Jim
Haugh, and he requested all house
presidents to set up an organization
within each house to deal with any
eventualities.
