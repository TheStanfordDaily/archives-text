BATAVIA, N.E.1., Jan. 13 (UP).â€”
Japanese invaders today captured
the oil-rich island of Taraan, domi
nating the northeastern tip of Dutch
Borneo, and began heavy air attacks
on the islands of Celebes and Ter
nate, commanding both sides of the
vital Molucca passage on the ship
route between the Netherlands East
Indies and the United States.
The small Dutch garrison at Tara
kan was overwhelmed by a Japanese
force estimated at 20,000 men, but
not before it had "completely de
stroyed" the island's oil fields and
plants which have produced 80,000
tons of high grade oil a month, it
was announced.
