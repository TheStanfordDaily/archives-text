"Able to (ell fortunes. I>id this in the last war, and everybody was
wild about it."
So one campus resident filled out (he blank lef( open for o(her quali
fications on one of (he 1500 defense registration cards which have been
received and are now being classified, under the direction of Professor
John Dodds. +

Another card simply stated: "Rel- I
atively intelligent. Able to take and j
give orders," while other cards were
more specific, stating that in addition ;
to more prosaic duties, such as tech- I
nical, medical and R.0.T.C., they 1
could carry on with athletics, horse- !
back riding, sailing and skiing.
READY AND WAITING
But the general tone of the cards
was one of eager assistance. '"Ready
and waiting" summed vip many of
the students' attitudes.
Several old Boy Scouts men- j
tioned their previous work. A piano
player, several people able to trans
late Spanish and one who can trans
late Czechoslovakian, and one who
can handle any kind of a boat noted j
these qualifications, as well as one j
who has done a great deal of work in 1
mosquito abatement.
Over (>OO people signified their
willingness to donate cars and drive j
them for any sort of defense work. I
Many of them have been put in use j
already to deliver defense bulletins
and information to living groups and
residents on the campus.
BICYCLE ERRANDS
One girl, in addition to noting
that knitting was another of her
qualifications, said she would be
glad to do errands on her bicycle.
The office work has been under the 1
direction of Miss Mildred Worswick
and John Allen. Harry Morgan is |
the Student Civilian Defense Co
ordinator and is available at his office
in the Old Union, Room 113.
