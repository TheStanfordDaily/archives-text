(Continued from page 1)
I Friday and Saturday nights, Feb. 13
and 14, but now only the Saturday
! night will be a closed date.
Regarding the forthcoming Charity
Ball, Branner President Jerry Stoner,
i who with only the best of intentions
nevertheless threw Excom into con
fused discussion on everything from
"What is a big name band?" to "How
many people go to the One-Acts?",
had this to say:
"This seemed the logical time to
J propose the Charity Ball. It is go
ing to be Stanford University's char
itable contribution to the Red Cross
Fund, although it is best to add that
the Branner Cub is handing the
dance. The band will be good, but
not a big-namer.
"This is not the first suggestion of
a charity ball," injected Excom
Chairman George Jackson, "Branner
Club is merely the first organization
to come forward with a concrete
plan. It looks good."
Concluded Stoner, "We've got
| some extremely good ideas worked
! up despite the fact that we will use
I a low priced band. But more about
the plans in a few days."
