# Orchesis Concert to Feature Composition by Accompanist

### HELEN LIVINGSTON 
The difficult task of composing; the music for the Orthosis concert, to
be presented in Memorial Mail, Tuesday. January 20. at 7:.'JO, falls to
Josephine Haskell, accompanist of the group. Miss Haskell's jolt is to
write music that will lit each dance in feeling as well as in tempo and
measures. ±

Speaking of the negro dance of
the American Suite, she says, "It was
the hardest to compose music for
because of the problem of capturing
the quality without using a definite
melody. Dance accompaniment
should not have a well-defined tune
because the dancers are the tune,
! and two melodies would be dis
j tracting."
The piano is used as accompani
ment for all the numbers except
J Primitive Dance. For the first part
I of this number Miss Haskell uses a
; large Tibetan prayer drum; in the
second half the character of the
dance changes, and smaller Chinese
1 drums are used instead of the larger,
; deeper prayer drum.
The kaleidoscopic impressions of
city life which are portrayed in a
section of the American suite give

great opportunity for clever and
pertinent accompaniment. The re
sult is an exciting montage of city
life with a trend toward the comic.
