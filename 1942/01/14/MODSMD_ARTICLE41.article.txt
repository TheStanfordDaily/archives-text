# Frosh Favored In Class Swim
## 
### 
Forming what may be "one of the
greatest freshman swimming teams
in Stanford history," according to
Coach Norton Thornton, 22 frosh
mermen receive their first real test
this week-end in the annual inter
class swimming meet.
No freshman team has ever been
able to win in the history of the
event, and if the Encinamen can
turn the trick, they will have es
tablished themselves as real cham
pionship material.
Eoasting of four swimmers already
stars, the frosh are well balanced in
every event.
Pacific Association champion in
the breast stroke, Alan Weeden,
brother of Bill Weeden, former Card
star, is the top dorsal swimmer on
the coast. He holds a slim advantage
over three other top backstrokers—
Bob Mapel, Pete Hatch, and Herb
Cooper.
Jim Gamble, Southern California
Interscholastic 50-yard free style
champion, made the Ail-American
Prop School team last year in this
event, and Dick Narver is Southern
California Interscholastic 220-yard
free style titlist.
Hank Saltonstall placed second in
the Honolulu breast stroke cham
pionships in the days before Pearl
Harbor. Jim Noble and Fred Dick
son add strength to this event.
Backing up Gamble in the sprints
are Bob Mapel. Wes Nowell, Bill
8011, Bob Reynolds. Locke Turner,
and Phil Welch, while Jack Rainal
ter. Bob Henry, and Doug Goodan
help out Narver in the distance
events.
Carter Schreiber is the top fresh
man diver.
