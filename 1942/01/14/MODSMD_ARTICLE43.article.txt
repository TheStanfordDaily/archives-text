## 
### 
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 13 (UP).â€”
j Ben Hogan, a good little man from
Heishey, Pa., tonight proved he
could whip the good big man, Jimmy
Thomson of Del Monte, Calif., by
capturing the playoff of the $10,000
Los Angeles open golf championship
with a par 72 and a one-stroke ad
vantage over his husky rival.
Hogan shot the first nine in even
par, getting a birdie on the second
hole and going one over on the fifth,
to make the turn with a score of 3(J.
Thomson ran into difficulties with
his approach shots and made the
[ turn with 38.
But the long-driving Del Monte
j pro regained his advantage by over
: taking Hogan a stroke on the 11th
and 14th holes when the Hershey
professional two-putted the 11th and
three-putted the 14th for a bogey
six while Thomson .shot a par five.
