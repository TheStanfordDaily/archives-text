# Burness, Free From Draft, To Finish Season
## 
### 
Coach Everett Dean was assured
yesterday that the draft would not
wreck his varsity squad when Don
Burness passed his physical exami
nation for the U.S. Naval Air Corps.
In accordance with Navy regulations.
Burness is entitled to remain in
school until he is graduated in June.
Co-captain and rated in an all
southern division spot last year, Bur
ness is the season's high scorer to
date, having scored 15 points against
College of the Pacific and 13 against
St. Mary's.
The Redskins will aid in national
defense by meeting U.S.F. next
Tuesday evening in a tripleheader
billed at the San Francisco Civic
Auditorium.
Friday Stan Patrick brings the
luck o' the Irish to the Pavilion for
the first real acid test the Indians
will have to swallow all season.
Aside from St. Mary's, the Bron
cos have the most powerful non
conference outfit in the Bay area.
One out of two over California, yes
terday picked by a northern sports
writer to cop the P.C.C. duke, and
an early season victory over Stan
lord put the Clarans on at least even
terms with the Indians.
Watch out Friday for an encircling
movement by the Bronc defense that
"grinds" in a circle, getting smaller
and smaller with big Sam Aliamo
finally shooting from just outside
the slot.
Besides Patrick, the Broncs have
Dick Mangan who, until he fouled
out Saturday against the Bears, had
them running all over the place
watching him. From the opinion of
those who saw the game, Santa Clara
might have won had Mangan stayed
in the game.
