lUST IN CASE anyone was worrying about (he whereabouts of Johnny

An ■••If> Luisetti, who used to do a little basketballing in these parts is seen
on the cover of a recent issue of The Amateur Athlete, house organ for
. the A.A.U.
ft wasn't so many months ago that another Stanfordite, Marj
Oestring, reposed on front of this sheet. ... In the same way I
learned that you can rent 15(10 feet of film showing the Compulsory
1 xeuises of the 1!)3(> Women's Olympic Oyninastic Championships for
only 52..")(1. If anyone would like to grab this magnificent offer I will
he glad to give you the address of this magnanimous establishment.
Fecenth the sports dept. of the Stanford Daily, bless its heart, was the
recipient of the complete list of official batting, fielding, and pitching
figures for the American League for 1941. While gleaning these figures
I came upon something that will shock every baseball fan to the depths
of his soul. Did you know that Pete Slider of the A's had 23 G.D.P.'s,
while Joe "We want him on our side" DiMaggio only had 6. Anyone who
can identify G.D.P.'s will be given three automatic grade points in the
: Bawlout.

AT TIIE SAME time that it was learned that Don Burness passed his
physical for the Naval Air Corps, thus enabling him to finish out bis
college year, it was also made known that Quentin "Cootie" Thompson,
former Indian fire-baller, who spent last summer with the Hollywood
Stars, will report into the Naval Air Service May 28. . . . Lawson Little,
another former athlete in this section, received $32.50 for his work in the
L.A. Open. If he could have pushed the pelota into the 18 holes that
decorate the Hillcrest Country Club with one dozen fewer pushes he
would have been in line for $3500. C'est la vie, as they say in Free French.

AFTER a lough struggle Monday night California's potent cage team
' was nosed out by San Diego State Teachers College. The Uer
kclcyiU's played their usual clean game, having only 15 fouls called
against them. . . . "Slats" Oil!, O.S.C. basketball mentor, comes out
with a quote to the effect that Washington State's hoop squad is bet
ter ibis year than they were last year when they won the I'.C.C. title
and got to the finals of the National Collegiate championships. The
n< \t night (".ill's Beavers proceed to wax the Cougars. What does that
add ii)) to. Slats?

I ET me apologize to anyone whom I may have called a bum for missing
a tackle on Bill Sheller in the course of the last football campaign, if
he was as good then as he was in rugby practice Monday night. It is
not as easy as falling off a log, but it is as easy as falling off Bill Sheller, or
rather bouncing off, at least that is the experience of one skinny sophomore.
If it hasn't been said before, I would like to herewith state that the 90
men who turned out for the British football were a tribute to Coaches
Harry Maloney, Jim Wylie, and Willard Classen, three gentlemen sports
men with a capital G.
