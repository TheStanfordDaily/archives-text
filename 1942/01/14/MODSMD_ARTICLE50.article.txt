# Talented Frosh Basketballers Show Good Offensive Game
## 
### 
Although on the hoop court as well as in war the best defense is a
good ollense, the Army never neglects its defensive machinery, and the
freshman haskt'thall team is profiting by the example.
The Papeese have some amazing casaba talent this year—tall, rugged,
fast-shooting lads that know the game and love to play it. But at times

their efforts seem to relax on the»
defense. That's the way it looked i
last night as Palo Alto High School j
effectively kept on a par with the
yearlings in a scrimmage tilt.
The first string frosh popped plen
ty of baskets, Fred Parsons hooping
eight points in four tries with siz
zling push shots, and Bob Hall col
lecting some nice out-court goals,
but that didn't keep the Paly men
from coming right back with plenty
of the same.
M-KET SANTA CLARA
Friday night the freshmen meet
the first-year men from Santa Clara
in a preliminary to the varsity tilt.
Paced by Chuck Larabel, San Fran
cisco school guard who now
holds the San Francisco high school
scoring record formerly held by Don
Burness, the Broncbabes will be only
the first of a long string of tough
games ahead of the Card frosh. Lar
abel and his side-kick, center Dick
O'Keefe, will take plenty of ad
vantage of any defensive loop-holes
that the Parsons-Barsoeehini-Heald-
Brown-Hall set-up allows.
But taking into consideration the
power shown by the frosh in the
opener against Piedmont Friday, the
fact that Parsons will be out to make
up for his slow night of the first tilt,
and the increasing smoothness shown
in the reserve ranks of the squad, it
looks like another frosh win.
SHAPING RAPIDLY
Dave Porter, burly former South
Pasadenan, has 200 pounds plus on
the court, and he knows where to use
it. He was used for a few minutes
in the first game and may break into
the game for a longer period Friday.
Hartwell, tall center reserve, is an
other likely to see action.
Incidentally, Bengtson, assistant
varsity coach, is head frosh coach
for the season, with Woodie Weir,
Indiana newcomer, assisting Dean
on the varsity and Bengtson with
1 the frosh.
