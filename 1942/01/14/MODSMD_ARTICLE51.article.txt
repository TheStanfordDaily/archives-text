# Ringmen Prep For All-U Card
## 
### 
The Circle S Society met with
Coach Clayton Frye and his new
assistant, Vie Lindskog, yesterday
afternoon in the Phi Delt house and
arranged plans for the second an
nual combined All-University and
Novice boxing matches. Tentative
plans call for the matches to be held
in the blacked-out pavilion on the
evening of January 29.
The matches this year will follow
the same plan as last year's highly
successful bouts. The combination
of the Novice and All-University
bouts, which was tried out for the
first time last year, produced such a
full card of hard-punching ringmen
that the plan was adopted again for
this year.
With the prospects of a return to
the squared-cirele of such university
sluggers as heavyweight Don Grant,
middleweight Jim Thurmond, and
Ihe flashy pair of Frank Hewitt and
Johnson Chinn promise the fans a
show of veteran talent. In addition
the new arrivals on the scene in the
boxing room of the gym show such
promise that a well-rounded pro
gram is sure to result.
The plan of holding the two cards
together allows plenty of room for
those aspirants who wish to try out
for the eliminating rounds. Yester
day afternoon Frye announced that
it is even possible for a man to en
ter both tourneys. If he is good
enough he may end up fighting six
rounds in the finals, however, Frye
warned.
Hugh Gallarneau gained 730 yards
from scrimmage last season.
