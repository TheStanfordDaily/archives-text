# How to Win a War
## 
### 
YESTERDAY was a day of victory for the
United States. Even late last night reports
were still piling on top of each other on The
Daily's United Press teletypes of heroic de
fense on the Bataan Peninsula, Luzon Island, of
British air resistance above the Malay Penin
sula, and perhaps even more important vic
tories in American management and production
at home. These latter announcements were
heralded to a heretofore slightly skeptical na
tion from its capital, Washington.
Yesterday the United States graduated from
the training camp of experience and was com
missioned in the army of victory, for it was a
day of glory not only on the battlefields and in
the air of the Far East, but on the vital home
front.
All of the following, due directly or indirectly
to U.S. action, happened in one day, yesterday,
the turning point from preparation to all-out
assault:
Outnumbered United States forces under
General Douglas Mac Arthur gained a second
victory in three days by inflicting a severe set
back in the battle for the Bataan Peninsula. A
24-hour artillery duel definitely established the
superiority of American arms.
A great sky battle over Malaya indicated pos
session of the peninsula will be determined in
the air, as British flyers heavily bombed enemy
bases in the north.
Chinese troops valiantly defended Changsha,
key to Chungking, by annihilating a possible
Japanese force of 7,000.
Only battle-front setback was Japanese cap
ture of the oil-rich island of Tarakan, which dom
inates the northeastern tip of Dutch Borneo.
President Roosevelt almost completely re
vised the nation's war effort by centralizing in
Donald M. Nelson, key figure in OPM, final
authority over procurement and production of
all armaments.
President Roosevelt opened fire on the stub
born congressional farm bloc by denouncing
the Senate version of price control legislation
as a bill to compel inflation and saddle heavy
debts on this and future generations.
It was understood President Roosevelt has
decided to ask Charles Evans Hughes, Wen
dell L. Willkie and James A. Farley to serve with
other public leaders on a body of "super-arbi
ters" under the newly created National War
Labor Board.
The OPM announced it has extended until
Feb. 2 the ban on sales of new passenger auto
mobiles, light, medium and heavy trucks and
truck trailers pending formulation of a govern
ment rationing program.
Representatives of labor, management and
government agencies in San Francisco agreed
to accept President Roosevelt's request for a
24-hour day, seven-day week in West Coast
shipyards as a means of achieving maximum
all-out production.
All this in one day—successes on Allied bat
tle fronts, centralization of war production au
thority, scathing criticism of a selfish Senate
bloc, organization of an apparently needed ra
tioning system, and assurance of smooth sail
ing in historically turbulent San Francisco ship
yards.
See you in Tokyo!— Harold Shafer
