# It's an Order Now
## 
### 
LAST quarter the Administration requested
students to turn out lights upon leaving their
rooms or when finished studying in classrooms
on the Quad. It was an economy measure.
Now, however, "turn out the lights when leav
ing your room unattended" is no longer a re
quest. It is an order.
The reason for this order is easily under
stood. In case of a blackout, burning lights in
unattended rooms piesent a danqerous prob

lem. How are these lights to be extinguished?
It would necessitate checking of all rooms,
making keys available for all rooms, and hav
ing a relatively large force of men to turn out the
lights as they are discovered. Further, this
would have to be done in a very short time,
if a blackout is to be successful. Such a task
would be extremely difficult in large halls such
as Encina.
Perhaps the students who still leave lights
burning do not realize that during future black
outs the main University switches will not be
pulled. This is to allow important experiments
and research to continue uninterrupted, as well
as to allow lighting in blackout rooms and cor
ridors. Each student on campus is responsible
for his room, whether he is present in it or not.
Non-compliance with this wise regulation will
be subject to severe penalties. At present it is
a violation of a Santa Clara County ordinance,
subject to a maximum of $300 fine and three
months imprisonment, to disregard air raid reg
ulations. And yesterday the Stanford Judicial
Committee met to consider enforcement of reg
ulations. This committee will, in the next few
days, determine the method of enforcing regu
lations and the penalties in event of violation.
Policing and punishing violators, however,
seem almost unnecessary in these trying times.
We realize that this is war. We should realize
that all regulations are for our own protection
and are not arbitrarily established. And we
should realize that, if we are to win this war, the
fullest co-operation of each of us is absolutely
necessary —whether at school, at home, or on
the battlefield.
Then, to turn off our lights when we leave our
rooms is surely not very much to ask of us.—

would be extremely difficult in large halls such
as Encina.
Perhaps the students who still leave lights
burning do not realize that during future black
outs the main University switches will not be
pulled. This is to allow important experiments
and research to continue uninterrupted, as well
as to allow lighting in blackout rooms and cor
ridors. Each student on campus is responsible
for his room, whether he is present in it or not.
Non-compliance with this wise regulation will
be subject to severe penalties. At present it is
a violation of a Santa Clara County ordinance,
subject to a maximum of $300 fine and three
months imprisonment, to disregard air raid reg
ulations. And yesterday the Stanford Judicial
Committee met to consider enforcement of reg
ulations. This committee will, in the next few
days, determine the method of enforcing regu
lations and the penalties in event of violation.
Policing and punishing violators, however,
seem almost unnecessary in these trying times.
We realize that this is war. We should realize
that all regulations are for our own protection
and are not arbitrarily established. And we
should realize that, if we are to win this war, the
fullest co-operation of each of us is absolutely
necessary —whether at school, at home, or on
the battlefield.
Then, to turn off our lights when we leave our
rooms is surely not very much to ask of us.—

LAST quarter the Administration requested
students to turn out lights upon leaving their
rooms or when finished studying in classrooms
on the Quad. It was an economy measure.
Now, however, "turn out the lights when leav
ing your room unattended" is no longer a re
quest. It is an order.
The reason for this order is easily under
stood. In case of a blackout, burning lights in
unattended rooms piesent a danqerous prob

lem. How are these lights to be extinguished?
It would necessitate checking of all rooms,
making keys available for all rooms, and hav
ing a relatively large force of men to turn out the
lights as they are discovered. Further, this
would have to be done in a very short time,
if a blackout is to be successful. Such a task
would be extremely difficult in large halls such
as Encina.
