# How About a Show?
## 
### 
SUNDAY night movies on the campus have
been in and out several times during the
past few years.
Once again this winter quarter they are "in."
Four shows have been planned, for alternate
Sundays during the coming eight weeks, each
consisting of a full-length feature, a cartoon, and
a couple of installments of a wild and woolly
Western serial.
Objections were voiced last year to holding
the movies in the Education Auditorium. This
year these have been overcome. The shows
will be screened in Memorial Hall with its top
notch sound and projection equipment, and
room enough for everybody.
The price, too, is within reach of everybodyâ€”
20 cents.
And it all ties in beautifully and painlessly
with all this new re-emphasis of "let's grow
back to the campus."
