# BULL SESSION
## MORE THAN JUST A SLOGAN 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
"YOU mean you'd rather be in an airplane than on
the ground?" asked the small one.
"Of course," said the tall one.
"Why you guys won't have a chance. You'll be the
first ones they'll take," said the small one.
"At least we'll be living well while we're living,"
said the tall one. "Two hundred and forty-five bucks
a month, good food, a good place to sleep and a nice
uniform. I'll take the air corps."
"You guys will be shot down like flies," said the
small one.
"Well, you guys aren't getting anything good," said
the tall one. "They'll send you to Africa and you'll
have to fight tigers and snakes, along with the Nazis."
"Well, at least we'll be on the ground," said the
small one.
"You mean the mud," said the tall one. "You're no
safer than we are, only you have to crawl around and
keep saluting all the time."
"What difference does it make where you go?" said
the fat one who had been listening carefully. "We'll
all be dead before it's over."
"Yeah, but I'd rather die in the air. It's cleaner,"
said the tall one.
"I'll stay on the ground," said the small one.
"Then I'll take the navy. You just fall in the water.
It's like taking a long bath," said the fat one.
And they talked this way until someone suggested
that the only thing to do was to get married, and as I
left them they were gathered around the phone, trying
to get hold of Roble.

there you have our generation reconciled to
1 death. They are ready to die and it doesn't scare
them very much and all they are interested in is dy
ing in the least troublesome way. They regard their
death as something inevitable, something that has to
happen. They aren't sure why it must be so, but
they arc sure that it is so, and all they want to do is
find the least troublesome way of doing their duty.
They don't know the reasons for their death, they
don't know the purpose for it, the end for which the
sacrifice is being made. Most of them don't understand
anything beyond, "Remember Pearl Harbor." And
many of them are no longer interested in trying to
find out the reasons for their going to war. They have
been taught by history that it has always happened,
they have been taught by a study of the past that
some years are "peace" years and some years are
"war" years. They know that during "peace" years
there is more chance of living until you are old and
are a grandfather. They know that "war" years arc
years of trouble and death. They know these things,
they call it life and they are willing to continue living
on these terms, even if it means dying.
But that kind of an attitude is one of the reasons
why we are in trouble again. That is not an attitude
that brings progress, and we must not slip into it. We
must try to understand why we are going to war, not
merely the obvious reasons, but the more underlying
ones. We must not give our lives without understand
ing why we are giving them. We must not fight merely
because our hatreds have suddenly been aroused. We
must realize that we are fighting for, an ideal, some
thing deeper and worthier than "Remember Pearl Har
bor." For without such a realization on our parts,
with only a blind anger and a thoughtless use of power,
we will not be prepared for the really big and im
portant work that must b<> done after the war has

"YOU mean you'd rather be in an airplane than on
the ground?" asked the small one.
"Of course," said the tall one.
"Why you guys won't have a chance. You'll be the
first ones they'll take," said the small one.
"At least we'll be living well while we're living,"
said the tall one. "Two hundred and forty-five bucks
a month, good food, a good place to sleep and a nice
uniform. I'll take the air corps."
"You guys will be shot down like flies," said the
small one.
"Well, you guys aren't getting anything good," said
the tall one. "They'll send you to Africa and you'll
have to fight tigers and snakes, along with the Nazis."
"Well, at least we'll be on the ground," said the
small one.
"You mean the mud," said the tall one. "You're no
safer than we are, only you have to crawl around and
keep saluting all the time."
"What difference does it make where you go?" said
the fat one who had been listening carefully. "We'll
all be dead before it's over."
"Yeah, but I'd rather die in the air. It's cleaner,"
said the tall one.
"I'll stay on the ground," said the small one.
"Then I'll take the navy. You just fall in the water.
It's like taking a long bath," said the fat one.
And they talked this way until someone suggested
that the only thing to do was to get married, and as I
left them they were gathered around the phone, trying
to get hold of Roble.

there you have our generation reconciled to
1 death. They are ready to die and it doesn't scare
them very much and all they are interested in is dy
ing in the least troublesome way. They regard their
death as something inevitable, something that has to
happen. They aren't sure why it must be so, but
they arc sure that it is so, and all they want to do is
find the least troublesome way of doing their duty.
They don't know the reasons for their death, they
don't know the purpose for it, the end for which the
sacrifice is being made. Most of them don't understand
anything beyond, "Remember Pearl Harbor." And
many of them are no longer interested in trying to
find out the reasons for their going to war. They have
been taught by history that it has always happened,
they have been taught by a study of the past that
some years are "peace" years and some years are
"war" years. They know that during "peace" years
there is more chance of living until you are old and
are a grandfather. They know that "war" years arc
years of trouble and death. They know these things,
they call it life and they are willing to continue living
on these terms, even if it means dying.
But that kind of an attitude is one of the reasons
why we are in trouble again. That is not an attitude
that brings progress, and we must not slip into it. We
must try to understand why we are going to war, not
merely the obvious reasons, but the more underlying
ones. We must not give our lives without understand
ing why we are giving them. We must not fight merely
because our hatreds have suddenly been aroused. We
must realize that we are fighting for, an ideal, some
thing deeper and worthier than "Remember Pearl Har
bor." For without such a realization on our parts,
with only a blind anger and a thoughtless use of power,
