# Search and 'Cello Score In Recital
## 
### 
Stanford's new band director,
Frederick Preston Search, made his
Stanford debut on the Tuesday Eve
ning Series last night as solo 'cellist
in a joint concert with Lawrence
Strauss.
Mr. Search, playing a Grieg sonata
and a concerto of his own, was at all
times the seasoned virtuoso, ren
dering both melodic and technical
passages with fine musicianship. And
his own composition established him
as a highly commendable composer
as well.
The concert's other attraction,
Lawrence Strauss, the "great inter
pretive tenor" with "beauty of voice
and flawless diction," fell a little
short of his billing, with his baritone
register lacking melodiousness and
his contrast with a light quasi-tenor
lacking in variety from number to
number. He, however, accomplished
the feat of singing in four languages,
with a gamut from Schubert to
Grieg; and he was enjoyable because
he tried so hard.â€”Covey
