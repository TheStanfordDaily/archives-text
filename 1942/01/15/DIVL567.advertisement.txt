The telephone plays a vital role in army communications.
So the Bell System is helping to school Signal Corps
men in practically every phase of telephone construc
tion, operation and maintenance.
This training job is but a small part of the tremen
dous task Hell System people are doing in this national
crisis. They're selling up telephone systems for new
camps, basesand factories—handling an enormous volume
of calls needed to coordinate the Nation's war effort.
Throughout the country, Hell System people arc
wholeheartedly cooperating in the drive for victory. To
men and women of their high caliber, there
is real satisfaction in a difficult job well done. //
