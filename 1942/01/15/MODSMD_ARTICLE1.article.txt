### AMIE REICHERT 
J>RESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S crea
tion of a one-man control over
the nation's war production is the
biggest and best step yet taken
toward fulfillment of the Victory
program. The President has at last
caught up with the country, which
has been urging action of this sort
for many months now.
Whether the appointment of
Nelson to do the job is the wisest
choicc remains to be seen. lie has
bad considerable experience: be
was formerly executive vice-presi
dent of Sears-Roebuck and Com
pany; he came to Washington in
the earliest days of the OPM as
purchasing agent, and since its re
organization he has been executive
director of SPAB.
In any event, the creation of the
job is in itself a tremendous boon
to the production set-up in Wash
ington which had a precarious child
hood and has come now to adoles
cency despite the suffocating red
tape, inefliceincy, and mismanage
ment which has bogged it all the
way.

has probably been
pushed into this move, which he
has always been most reluctant to
make, as much as anything by the
growing sentiment in newspapers
and magazines all over the country
and among the people, big (Wendell
Willkie for one) and little for a
strong, all-powerful one-man con
trol of the sprawling defense or
ganization.
Nelson, next to the President,
now has the biggest, toughest job
in the nation today. Last week
Roosevelt added to the already
drafted X and Y programs, the
new Z program or War Program.
This i.s the plan which will call
for half the national income by
the middle of 1943.
"To achieve this staggering rate of
spending," says Time, "the U.S.
must also treble its pace within a
few months. In December, $1,800,-
000,000 was spent on defense. By
next June the nation must spend a
billion dollars a week. To do that,
the U.S. must really convert its
peacetime plant to war uses."
And that, boys and girls, is Don
ald Nelson's job.

| AST week Britain's bustling Lord
Beaverbrook, Minister of Sup
ply, was in Washington with Winston
Churchill. He talked at length with
ites, et cetera. It is probable that
ites, et cetera. It is prbable tha*
Beaverbrook had a great deal to do
with the President's creation of the
new post. In any event, he must have
given the production strategists a
good deal of valuable information.
Mr. Kmidsen was especially im
pressed by Beaverbrook's state
ment that Britain had achieved
100 per cent auto-conversion to
war production. Knudscn has al
ways believed this impossible.
A year ago he squashed the pro
posed Reuther plan which called for
just such conversion. Since then
much criticism has been leveled at
the OPM on this score, and recently
the United Automobile Workers ran
a full page advertisement in the
newspapers to the efTect that auto
plane conversion can be done, and
successfully.

B U T this sort of thing is only one
of the butches which the pro
duction heads in Washington pulled
and have been pulling all along.
Root of much of the trouble has been
divided authorityâ€”and at least on
that score, the matter is now settled.
Nelson's word will be final, and he
is under no one except the Presi
dent.
He will make all decisions. He
will have full authority to hire and
fire. This latter, apparently, has
been one of the President's weak
est points. He seldom, if ever,
fires one of his chiefs. In the past
he has always preferred to juggle
them around (as in the case of
SI'AIJ and OPIYI) or else appoint
new heads over the inefficient
ones.
The only thing we have to wony
about now is, if Nelson doesn't suc
ceed, who will be appointed to top
