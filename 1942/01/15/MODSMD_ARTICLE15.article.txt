# Duranty Predicts Final Victory For Allies Within 18 Months
## 
### 
Victory for the Allies within a year and a half was foreseen last night
by the man who predicted the Russian rout of the Nazis at the outbreak of
Soviet-German hostilities.
"The forces of aggression will get what they deserve within a year and
a half foi* the simple reason that we (the Allies) will be doing what they

.have been doing," Walter Duranty,
war correspondent and author, told
900 listeners in Memorial Hall.
NOW OR NEVER'
Discussing at length the Far East
ern war, he stated the main reason
for the Japanese attack on United
States possessions was a feeling in
the military of "now or never," to
gether with German influence.
"The Germans no doubt offered
them heaven in a bucket," said the
affable correspondent, who punctu
ated his lecture with numerous an
ecdotes drawn from observations
during 25 years as a newsman.
Turning his attention to the Phil
ippines, he said, "I must say that to
me it doesn't look very cheerful, al
though General Mac Arthur is prob
ably the best soldier alive today and
certainly the best in the Far East."
He said the Japanese felt they
could not get along very much long
er without larger quantities of nec
essary raw materials, and added that
in his opinion the Japs reasoned
that by capturing the Philippines,
Borneo, Dutch Indies and Malaya
they could bargain for resources.
'GOOD FAITH'
"The Japanese leaders in Tokyo
were busy as bird dogs, but I be
lieve neither Nomura 01* Kurusu
knew the attack was coming. I
doubt that more than a half-dozen
people in Tokyo knew it, and I am
convinced the Japanese emissaries in
Washington were acting in good
faith."
Drawing on his many years as
correspondent in Russia, Mr. Duranty
emphasized that any feeling of doubt
in this country that the Rusisans will
not attack the Japs "is not worth the
paper it is written on."
RUSS OUTLOOK
Asked in a question period follow
ing his lecture if there will be bet
ter understanding between Russia
and the democracies after the war,
he said:
"Well, to begin with, they couldn't
be worse. The Russians are playing
their own hand, and they play poker.
They don't play any bridge or part
nerships."
Mr. Duranty was sponsored by the
Stanford chapters of Theta Sigma
Phi and Sigma Delta Chi, women's
and men's professional journalism
fraternities, and was introduced by
Dr. Harold Fisher of the Hoover
Library.
