NO OPERATING PERIOD
"There is no period of two minutes
or five minutes or any other time
during which they may be operated,
as is erroneously supposed in some
quarters. This applies to alarms both
during the day and at night."

should, and surely will take a posi

In a statement issued yesterday by
Stanford defense officials it was re
vealed that the power to penalize
infraction of air raid regulations has
been allocated to the President of the
University, who will be advised by
two boards:
1. In cases of campus residents
other than students, penalties will be
imposed by the President upon rec
ommendation of the judicial com
mittee consisting of Dean Mary Yost,
Dean John Bunn, Professor E. A.
Cottrell, Professor John Dodds and
Dean M. R. Kirkwood.
2. In cases of students, penalties
will be imposed by the President
upon recommendation of the Men's
and Women's Student Councils; ex
cept in cases which the councils may
refer to the Judicial Committee.
$.'lOO OR .'! MONTHS
Residents of Stanford are also
subject to the ordinance of Santa
Clara County which is similar to
that of the campus regulation. This
ordinance provides that violations
shall constitute a misdemeanor pun
ishable by fine not exceeding $300,
or by imprisonment in the county
jail not exceeding three months, or
both.
The joint statement, issued by Stan
Owen, chairman of Men's Council,
Rosemarie Mullany, chairman of
Women's Council, and Dean Kirk
wood, chairman of the Judicial
Committee, stressed the danger to
the entire community in case of
faulty blackout and called attention
to the fact that automobiles are to
be parked at the side of the street
immediately upon the sounding of
an air raid warning.
