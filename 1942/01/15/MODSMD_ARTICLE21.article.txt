# Imperials Dig In for Main Defense of Singapore as Japs Close In; Wavell Lands in Java
## Japs to Be Fought 'With Their Own Methods' in South Malaya Battling; Dutch Strike Back Hard at Invaders 
### 
SINGAPORE, Jan. 14 (UP). —Imperial troops strove today to fend off a
Japanese threat to block the Strait of Malacca while the Imperial Command
under cover of a tropical deluge revamped tactics and regrouped man
power for the impending hattle of South Malaya.
Amid persistent hints of momentous events calculated to give the Japa-

a man-sized headache, the Im
perials prepared to try out the Aus
tralian theory that the invaders can
be countered best with their own
weapons — infiltration, penetration,
an elusive war of movement.
All signs added up to the conclu
sion that the British, after a long
and discouraging withdrawal step
by step down two-thirds of the pen
insula, were getting ready for the
main defense of Singapore along the
northern border of Johore Sultanate
j some 100 miles to the northwest.
For the moment the point of con
tact on the coast appeared to be
above Port Dickson, 20 miles south
west of Seremban, below which lies
! Malacca Province. The Strait of
Malacca, sea route northwest of
Singapore, is a bare 30 miles wide at
that point. Japanese command of
the coast would gravely imperil
shipping in the narrow lane.
