## 
### 
BATAVIA, N.E.1., Jan. 14 (UP).—
Dutch air and land forces struck
back sharply at the spreading Japa
nese invasion tide today, bombing a
ship off Borneo, an airport in the
Philippines, and killing 18 Japanese
in a clash on the Sarawak border,
as they confidently awaited Allied
aid for a counter-offensive.
It was revealed that Gen. Sir
Archibald Wavell, supreme com
mander of Allied forces in the South
west Pacific, had arrived in Java a
few days ago, along with United
States Lieut. Gen. George H. Brett,
his second in command, and his
staff, and had set up headquarters to
direct the crucial struggle ahead.
United States Admiral Thomas C.
Hart, commander of the Allied fleets
in this area, reached Java a vreek ago
in a submarine. It was believed that
Allied counteraction, backed by
strong reinforcements, would come
soon, possibly both in the Indies
and Malaya.
