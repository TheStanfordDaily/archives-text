MrKollar. Remember the "Angus" part, for it is the key to the whole story.
As a fushman. McKellar took Western "Civ." and all the usual subjects

the Charles Atlas plan. Finully he
became so proficient on the dumb
bells that Charles Atlas let him
.start up a little body building school
of 1 ji.s own. Eneina took it up en
thusiastically, and this is the reason
the men of '42 are so proficient in
oihlelies today.
'l he next year was McKellar's bad
y ar. Being a sophomore he of course
was in the famed "sophomore slump."
lie had no money to keep track of,
other than what was in his pocket,
