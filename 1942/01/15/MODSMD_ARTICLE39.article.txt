# Classes Battle In Swim Meet
## 
### 
Judging from pro-season indica
tions, it's going to be an underclass
men's holiday in the annual Stan
ford interclass swimming meet to
day, Friday, and Monday afternoons.
No freshman squad has ever won
the event, but this year's frosh
squad of 22, including four boys
already stars in their own right, has
better than an outside chance to
turn the trick.
Their main opposition will come
from a powerful sophomore group.
Champions as freshmen last year
and holding a 56 to 15 trouncing of
the Cal frosh to their credit, the
second year men are back in force
bolstered by three outstanding
transfersâ€”Bill Mapel, Emmett Cash
in, and Bill Beamer.
UPPERCLASS STARS
The juniors and seniors have their
own quota of standouts but don't
seem to have the all-around strength
of the underclass mermen.
On tap this afternoon are the med
ley relay, the 220-yard freestyle, and
the 50-yard freestyle races.
The furlong swim puts Doc Col
year, junior standout, against Ted
Munroe, sophomore powerhouse, and
Dick Narver, freshman. Colyear
won lots of races last year but has
just come out for practice and is
something of an unknown quantity.
GAMBLE OUTSTANDING
Narver is the Southern California
Tnterscholastic 220-yard freestyle
champion.
The sprint race finds Brad Young
and Bob Regnolds, a pair of senior
veterans, against Bill Mapel and Rey
Rule, sophomores, and Stan Gamble,
Bob Mapel, Wes Nowell, Bill Bell,
and Bob Reynolds from the Encina
squad. Gamble, one of the frosh
standouts, made the All-America
Prop School team last year.
