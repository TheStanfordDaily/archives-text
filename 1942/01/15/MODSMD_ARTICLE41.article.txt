Publicity Director, San Jose State [
SAN JOSE, Jan. 14 (Special to The j
Daily).—Having lost the opener in
defense of its co-California Colle
giate Conference title to Santa Bar
| bara State, Coach Walt McPherson's i
Spartans go up against a Pacific
Coast Conference power in Stan- !
| ford Saturday night.
Before the Santa Barbara loss j
i Monday night, the San Joseans look- j
jed good in beating San Francisco
| State, 59-44, and Oakland Athens
Club, 50-39.
Most of the Spartans are small and
fast which may or may not be able
to overcome Stanford height.
HELBUSII STARS
Bill Helbush, lean forward who
gave Stanford some worry last year j
with deadly accuracy on long over- J
hand shots from midcourt, will start I
in a guard spot. Other guardian is i
Bert Robinson, right half on the
football team recently stranded in
Honolulu during the Jap raid. His
return to the mainland was plenty j
good news to McPherson.
Stu Carter, little barrel-chested
forward, is the fireball who makes
the Spartans go. Carter has a trick
knee and hasn't been able to see
as much action as he would like.
Dutch Boysen is the other forward
and high scorer on the club. He has
an average of better than 10 in 5
games for 1942.
CENTER LOST
When McPherson lost his 6 foot
7 inch sky-scraping center, Menno
Siebert, last year he appeared at a j
loss to fill that spot. But 6 foot 3 |
inch Dick Clark from Placer J.C.
came along this season and has
taken over Siebert's spot. He isn't
the high-scorer Siebert was, but his
fire and backboard play are better.
Against Santa Barbara, San Jose
was better than the 41-31 score in
dicated. The Spartans led until the
start of the final 10 minutes when |
the visitors- took command with j
their height.
And height may tell the story in
the Stanford game.

giate Conference title to Santa Bar
| bara State, Coach Walt McPherson's i
Spartans go up against a Pacific
Coast Conference power in Stan- !
| ford Saturday night.
Before the Santa Barbara loss j
i Monday night, the San Joseans look- j
jed good in beating San Francisco
| State, 59-44, and Oakland Athens
Club, 50-39.
Most of the Spartans are small and
fast which may or may not be able
to overcome Stanford height.
HELBUSII STARS
Bill Helbush, lean forward who
gave Stanford some worry last year j
with deadly accuracy on long over- J
hand shots from midcourt, will start I
in a guard spot. Other guardian is i
Bert Robinson, right half on the
football team recently stranded in
Honolulu during the Jap raid. His
return to the mainland was plenty j
good news to McPherson.
Stu Carter, little barrel-chested
forward, is the fireball who makes
the Spartans go. Carter has a trick
knee and hasn't been able to see
as much action as he would like.
Dutch Boysen is the other forward
and high scorer on the club. He has
an average of better than 10 in 5
games for 1942.
CENTER LOST
When McPherson lost his 6 foot
7 inch sky-scraping center, Menno
Siebert, last year he appeared at a j
loss to fill that spot. But 6 foot 3 |
inch Dick Clark from Placer J.C.
came along this season and has
taken over Siebert's spot. He isn't
the high-scorer Siebert was, but his
fire and backboard play are better.
Against Santa Barbara, San Jose
was better than the 41-31 score in
dicated. The Spartans led until the
start of the final 10 minutes when |
the visitors- took command with j
their height.
And height may tell the story in
the Stanford game.
