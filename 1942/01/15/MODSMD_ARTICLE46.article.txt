### DON SELBY 
PROM ALL the publicity that this Stan Patrick is getting, the spectators
at the Stanford-Santa Clara hoop game Friday night should get an
eyeful of plain and fancy basket shooting.
Patrick, the classy sophomore on the Bronc quint, has amassed 178
points in 11 games for an average of better than 16 points per game. Which
isn't bad at all.
Having been termed by some basketball experts as "a better shot
maker than Hank Luisetti," who represents the peak of basketball ability
in these United States, Patrick will have a great reputation to live up to
when he takes to the hardwood in the Pavilion.
One of the things that makes Patrick extraordinary is that, like
Luisetti, he doesn't have to be on balance to shoot accurately. He has
a one-hand push shot which he uses to advantage anywhere within
40 feet of the basket. However, whereas the great Hank could shoot
with either hand while moving in any direction, Patrick almost always
has to be traveling to his right to get oIT a good shot.
lliiMkctiiiiif enthusiasts in and around the bay area are awaiting
the game eagerly to settle the argument as to whether Patrick is a
better ball player than Stanford's sophomore ace. Jim Pollard, or vice
versa. When the Broncos, the only team to have licked Stanford this
season, last played the Indians, Pollard saw no action, being ineligible
at the time.
So tomorrow night the boys will play on opposing teams for the first
time, which should add an extra bit of interest in a game which is already
rated as a "goodie."

r piIROUGH the courtesy of Don Driscoll of Santa Clara, we have a little
more information concerning the Broncs, which we will let Driscoll,
Bronc publicity man tell in his own words.
"The team lender and the only senior on the Bronco starting five is Dick
"Skippy" Mangan. Dick, who knows his basketball from A to Z, frequently
calis time out to diagram plays on the floor for his teammates, using a
piece of chalk that he carries as a part of his standard equipment.
Dick fouled himself out of the game in the Broncos' last contest with
California. At the time he went out, Santa Clara held a five-point lead
with eight minutes to go. Without the guiding hand of Dick, the Broncs
blew up and scored only three more points and dropped the overtime
decision.
"Besides Stan Patrick, three other sophs have found places on the
Santa ( lara starting line-up. Sam Alaimo, who has been high scorer
in the last two contests, teams with Patrick for Coach George Barsi's
"double trouble" forward combination. Six foot, five inch Mike Schro
ven holds down the pivot post, and Boh Gren teams with Mangan to
give the Broncos two clever hall handlers in the back court.
"Thus far the Broncs have been an in and out team—good enough to
top the best of opposition on some nights and bad enough to lose to the
most mediocre of opponents on other occasions. They hold victories over
the Athens Club. Moffett Field. Stanford, California, and U.S.F.
They have lost to Fort Ord, U.S.C., Loyola of Chicago, U.C.L.A., and
California."

Dick fouled himself out of the game in the Broncos' last contest with
California. At the time he went out, Santa Clara held a five-point lead
with eight minutes to go. Without the guiding hand of Dick, the Broncs
blew up and scored only three more points and dropped the overtime
decision.
"Besides Stan Patrick, three other sophs have found places on the
Santa ( lara starting line-up. Sam Alaimo, who has been high scorer
in the last two contests, teams with Patrick for Coach George Barsi's
"double trouble" forward combination. Six foot, five inch Mike Schro
ven holds down the pivot post, and Boh Gren teams with Mangan to
give the Broncos two clever hall handlers in the back court.
"Thus far the Broncs have been an in and out team—good enough to
top the best of opposition on some nights and bad enough to lose to the
most mediocre of opponents on other occasions. They hold victories over
the Athens Club. Moffett Field. Stanford, California, and U.S.F.
They have lost to Fort Ord, U.S.C., Loyola of Chicago, U.C.L.A., and
California."
PROM ALL the publicity that this Stan Patrick is getting, the spectators
at the Stanford-Santa Clara hoop game Friday night should get an
eyeful of plain and fancy basket shooting.
Patrick, the classy sophomore on the Bronc quint, has amassed 178
points in 11 games for an average of better than 16 points per game. Which
isn't bad at all.
Having been termed by some basketball experts as "a better shot
maker than Hank Luisetti," who represents the peak of basketball ability
in these United States, Patrick will have a great reputation to live up to
when he takes to the hardwood in the Pavilion.
One of the things that makes Patrick extraordinary is that, like
Luisetti, he doesn't have to be on balance to shoot accurately. He has
a one-hand push shot which he uses to advantage anywhere within
40 feet of the basket. However, whereas the great Hank could shoot
with either hand while moving in any direction, Patrick almost always
has to be traveling to his right to get oIT a good shot.
lliiMkctiiiiif enthusiasts in and around the bay area are awaiting
the game eagerly to settle the argument as to whether Patrick is a
better ball player than Stanford's sophomore ace. Jim Pollard, or vice
versa. When the Broncos, the only team to have licked Stanford this
season, last played the Indians, Pollard saw no action, being ineligible
at the time.
So tomorrow night the boys will play on opposing teams for the first
time, which should add an extra bit of interest in a game which is already
rated as a "goodie."
