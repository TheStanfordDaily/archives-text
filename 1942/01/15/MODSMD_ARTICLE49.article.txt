# Biz Grads Win In Mural Hoop
## 
### 
Alpha Delt will clash with Kappa
Alpha II tonight in one of the lead
ing mural basketball games, and El
Toro I will take on El Cuadro.
The results of last night's games
spotted the Business School as the
possible dark horse of the season
with their trouncing of El Campo,
32-12. The Biz School squad is
coached by Ken Davidson, Stan-

| ford's All-Coast guard of last year,
j and with the shooting of Ollie Wooll
cott, the team may upset last year's
winner and this year's favorites, the
Phi Psi's.
Sequoia downed the Japanese
Club, 21-20, with Shunke and
Mosher leading the winners scoring,
j and Dairiki taking the high-point
! honors. Both teams looked good, but
j the excessive height of the Sequoia
team spelled defeat for the Japanese.
The Chem Department beat the
Phi Delt team, 32-26, and Kappa Sig
j I won its game from Theta Xi, 23-15,
in a fast game that closed the eve
! ning competition. The Zetes for
feited to Kappa Alpha, and the
A.T.O. squad forfeited to the Chi
| Psis.
There will be no games Friday be
j cause of the varsity match with
I Santa Clara.
