# Frosh To Face Broncbabes In Second Tryout Friday
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
And it has came to pass that doubters and unbelievers have appeared at
our door, saying that the freshman basketball team lias not the speed, power,
and deception to which we allege. But to those of you who don't believe,
c(tme ye to the Pavilion on Friday eventide and watch the Enema clan
against the Santa Clara innocents and ye shall scoff no longer.

For verily, verily I say unto you
that during the last week much
work has been done on the sagging
yearling defense, and many of the
first-string brethren appear to be
hitting on all cylinders. With Broth
ers Parsons and Barsocchini at top
shooting form in practice, and
Brother Heald his rugged self at
center, and those heavenly bolts of
brawn, Hall and Brown, at the
guardian spots, what infidel gainsays
to prophesy other than victory for
the frosh?
JUST ENOUGH TO WIN
The scoffing proletariat have jus
tice in their remarks in that they
miss any standout star. This squad is
not Pollardized. It is one of those
all-around squads that can play just
as good ball as it has to to win.
j When it is against tough competi
tion like the Broncbabes or the Ber
keley youth, it will be at top form.
When against the representatives of
the International Keg and Spigot
Tappers, Local 107's sterling squad,
it will play on an according scale,
(We haven't seen them lately, either,
but they used to be very good.)
Santa Clara's hope falls on Chuck
Larabel. Mr. Larabel as a player at
i Commerce High School in San Fran
cisco was so handy at the sport that
he tossed the pill through the cords
more times than any previous player
in San Francisco High School his
tory. In the process he broke into
many pieces the record of Stanford's
Don Burness. So watch that laddy.
PROPHETS FLEE
About the San Jose frosh, Satur
day's foe, we know less than noth
ing and will say no more. But the
boys from the town at the other end
of the bay have made many fellow
prophets tuck in their halos and go
back to farming in general.
Speaking of halos, did you know
that Dave Brown and Jack Heald
were the only two high school toss
ers in the country to play in the
National A.A.U. Tournament last
year? Brown for the Athens Ath
letic Club and Heald for a Billings,
Mont., outfit. Brown's outfit hit
third place, and the Piedmont High
guard-forward held Hank Luisetti
to only 14 points in play there.
And it has came to pass that doubters and unbelievers have appeared at

c(tme ye to the Pavilion on Friday eventide and watch the Enema clan
against the Santa Clara innocents and ye shall scoff no longer.

For verily, verily I say unto you
that during the last week much
work has been done on the sagging
yearling defense, and many of the
first-string brethren appear to be
hitting on all cylinders. With Broth
ers Parsons and Barsocchini at top
shooting form in practice, and
Brother Heald his rugged self at
center, and those heavenly bolts of
brawn, Hall and Brown, at the
guardian spots, what infidel gainsays
to prophesy other than victory for
the frosh?
JUST ENOUGH TO WIN
The scoffing proletariat have jus
tice in their remarks in that they
miss any standout star. This squad is
not Pollardized. It is one of those
all-around squads that can play just
as good ball as it has to to win.
j When it is against tough competi
tion like the Broncbabes or the Ber
keley youth, it will be at top form.
When against the representatives of
the International Keg and Spigot
Tappers, Local 107's sterling squad,
it will play on an according scale,
(We haven't seen them lately, either,
but they used to be very good.)
Santa Clara's hope falls on Chuck
Larabel. Mr. Larabel as a player at
i Commerce High School in San Fran
cisco was so handy at the sport that
he tossed the pill through the cords
more times than any previous player
in San Francisco High School his
tory. In the process he broke into
many pieces the record of Stanford's
Don Burness. So watch that laddy.
PROPHETS FLEE
About the San Jose frosh, Satur
day's foe, we know less than noth
ing and will say no more. But the
boys from the town at the other end
of the bay have made many fellow
prophets tuck in their halos and go
back to farming in general.
Speaking of halos, did you know
that Dave Brown and Jack Heald
were the only two high school toss
ers in the country to play in the
National A.A.U. Tournament last
year? Brown for the Athens Ath
letic Club and Heald for a Billings,
Mont., outfit. Brown's outfit hit
third place, and the Piedmont High
guard-forward held Hank Luisetti
to only 14 points in play there.
And it has came to pass that doubters and unbelievers have appeared at
our door, saying that the freshman basketball team lias not the speed, power,
and deception to which we allege. But to those of you who don't believe,
c(tme ye to the Pavilion on Friday eventide and watch the Enema clan
against the Santa Clara innocents and ye shall scoff no longer.
