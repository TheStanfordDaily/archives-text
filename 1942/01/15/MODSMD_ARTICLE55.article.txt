# Joe Louis Trades Gloves for Gun
## 
### 
CAMP UPTON. N.Y.. Jan. 14 (UP)

—Joe Louis joined the army today,
and any doubts as to his military
ability were immediately dispelled
by his sterling victory over a plate
of pork chops in the company "L"
mess hall.
Discipline descended upon the
dusky dynamiter in such a hurry
that a gang of newspaper men and
photographers, who had come to
record today's ceremonies for pos
terity, were completely flabber
gasted. No interviews and no pic
tures were permitted.
Easy-goin' Joe got a kick out of
the discipline and the press gang's
chagrin. As he was marching away—
near the end of a long line of negro
inductees—a reporter yelled at him:
"How do you feel, Joe?"
The champion grinned and shot
back, "You better watch out, boy—
or they'll get you next."
