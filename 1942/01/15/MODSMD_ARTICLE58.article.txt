IN the months since Dunkirk and the fall of
France we in America have been transposed
from a complacent "Maginot Line" attitude to
a pessimistic, finger-crossing attitude. From the
successful campaigns in the Balkans and North
Africa until the seemingly near-successful in
vasion of Russia, the news and future of "our"
world have been far from cheerful. This con
ditioning has progressed so far that even the few
Allied victories against Japan are taken pessi
mistically in the face of Japanese successes.
But last night when a recognized world ob
server reported to Stanford his views of the
world situation, he did not paint a pessimistic
picture. If the speaker were a flag-waving offi
cial or super-patriot and not Walter Duranty, the
audience would have surely crossed its fingers
at his optimism.
Mr. Duranty believes:
1. The Allies will win this war within 18
months.
2. Russia will attack Japan when she is able
to do so with telling effect.
3. The outlook in Russia is bright. The army,
the people, the resources are all in good condi
tion. And Russia will fight to the finish against
Germany—no deals will be made with the
Nazis.
4. Germany's condition is far from bright.
Hitler faces dire food, morale, political, and
military problems.
5. A rapprochement of the democracies and
Russia after the war, with a peace satisfying to
all, is extremely possible. (He did, however,
point out that Stalin and Russia are not playing
"partners at bridge, but poker" for their own
benefit.
6. The Japanese attack on the United States
could be a face-saving measure for the Jap
military clique. Unable to defeat China, the
Jap militarists took to higher stakes, feeling a
defeat by the Allies would be far from dis
graceful.
7. Singapore will withstand attack.

newspaper Pollyanna but a thorough observer

IN the months since Dunkirk and the fall of
France we in America have been transposed
from a complacent "Maginot Line" attitude to
a pessimistic, finger-crossing attitude. From the
successful campaigns in the Balkans and North
Africa until the seemingly near-successful in
vasion of Russia, the news and future of "our"
world have been far from cheerful. This con
ditioning has progressed so far that even the few
Allied victories against Japan are taken pessi
mistically in the face of Japanese successes.
But last night when a recognized world ob
server reported to Stanford his views of the
world situation, he did not paint a pessimistic
picture. If the speaker were a flag-waving offi
cial or super-patriot and not Walter Duranty, the
audience would have surely crossed its fingers
at his optimism.
Mr. Duranty believes:
1. The Allies will win this war within 18
months.
2. Russia will attack Japan when she is able
to do so with telling effect.
3. The outlook in Russia is bright. The army,
the people, the resources are all in good condi
tion. And Russia will fight to the finish against
Germany—no deals will be made with the
Nazis.
4. Germany's condition is far from bright.
Hitler faces dire food, morale, political, and
military problems.
5. A rapprochement of the democracies and
Russia after the war, with a peace satisfying to
all, is extremely possible. (He did, however,
point out that Stalin and Russia are not playing
"partners at bridge, but poker" for their own
benefit.
6. The Japanese attack on the United States
could be a face-saving measure for the Jap
military clique. Unable to defeat China, the
Jap militarists took to higher stakes, feeling a
defeat by the Allies would be far from dis
graceful.
7. Singapore will withstand attack.
Thus prophesied Mr. Duranty, who is not a
newspaper Pollyanna but a thorough observer
and a proved reporter of world events.—Her
