# Unanimity
## 
### 
BY its action Tuesday night Executive Com
mittee brought itself and the Stanford cam
pus into focus with the fact that the country
is at war. The executive group in one breath
voted against big name bands, taking in the
Dorsey group, and in the next voted its approval
of Branner's plan to sponsor a Stanford charity
ball.
At the same time that Executive Committee
was casting its vote against a big-name senior
prom, the Senior Class executive committee
was passing a similar motion. The fact that the
Iwo groups passed the action simultaneously
certainly reveals a striking shift of opinion. This
shift was brought on, not only by widespread
general feeling against big name bands, but also
on the word of Student Manager McKellar that
in his mind the dance would fail financially.â€”
