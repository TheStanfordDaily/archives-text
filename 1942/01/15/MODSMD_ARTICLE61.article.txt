### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
THE LIFE OF A DETECTIVE
Executive Committee is to be commended for
their action the other evening ruling Tommy Dor
sey out of the Senior Prom, and thereby holding to
their original policy of inexpensiveness and simplicity
in our social activities. It was the only thing to do,
and it shows that the committee is not afraid to change
its decisions, and is conscious of sentiment around the
school. We are hoping that the matter will not have
to be discussed again.
For some reason or other people have been writing
me suggesting that we start having dances on the
campus every week-end, to phonograph bands. The
purpose of course is to keep everyone around the cam
pus in case of a blackout, and to reduce our social
costs this year. I can see nothing wrong with such
a plan and I think that Ex Committee has taken a
step in that direction by passing a proposal for a
Charity Ball. This shows that it is possible to have a
dance that everyone will enjoy, and still have the
money go to a cause that needs money more than a
band needs money. The Ball will be held on the night
of February 13, and the money will go to the Red Cross.
To me the idea sounds great, something that has some
sense in back of it.
The man in back of the Charity Ball idea is Jerry
Stoner, president of Branner Hall. Mr. Stoner has amaz
ing energy and a capacity for arranging and organ
izing. If this first Ball is successful, and it should be
under his leadership, there is no reason why such
dances could not be held more often. Anything that
Ex Committee can do like this, to adjust our social
life to the general war effort, should be heartily backed
by the whole school.

I F YOU are a man and still don't know where you fit
in this war program and are conscious of the fact
that registration day is fast approaching, I suggest you
visit Harry Morgan, our new defense co-ordinator. Mr.
Morgan has a nice little office, a charming secretary
and all sorts of facts, pamphlets and other literature
that will help you to find your place.

If you follow the career of the eminent dctcctive
Dick Tracy you arc worried enough, so I won't bother
you further.
