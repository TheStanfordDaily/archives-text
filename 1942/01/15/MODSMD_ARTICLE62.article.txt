## PHONE SERVICE 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
I live in Toyon Hall. I pay a sizable rent each
month. I don't ask much for my money, only to have
my bed made in the morning and get a clean towel
every few days. Therefore I do not think I am speak
ing out of turn when I criticize the phone system in
the hall.
Unless you are lucky enough to have a private
telephone in your room, you are practically incom
municado while in the hall. For the phone service is
so terrible that most people after trying to get you a
few times give up in despair and trust on seeing you if
they want to speak to you. Many is the time I have
stood at the phone for five or ten minutes after an
swering my buzzer, only to have the operator tell me
that the party which was calling had hung up.
The same is true of outgoing calls. It takes so long
to get any answer after you lift up the receiver that I
usually make my calls outside the hall. Of course, this
is an inconvenience, and I do not see why we hall
residents should have to put up with it.
Can something be done?
