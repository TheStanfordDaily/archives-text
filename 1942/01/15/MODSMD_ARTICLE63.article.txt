# TANGERINES

### 
r jpHE EDITOR, SIR:
No one knows who can pick the campus tanger
ines. Every morning when I pass through the Quad's
orange grove I almost pick a tangerine. Tangerines
are my favorite fruit. They're ripening now.
But someone is always around with an eagle eye.
Twice such eagles have warned me, "No, no, mustn't
touch." These eagles seem to have the inside dope that
you can't pick the Stanford tangerines.
"Why?" I ask. "I pay my $143 like everybody else,
don't I?" But nobody knows why—or who. Yet, the
tangerines are disappearing. Someone is picking those
tangerines.
And so I am asking you, Mr. Editor, who is picking
our tangerines? And can I pick them too? And is it
true that Stanford is the farthest point north where
lemons are found?
