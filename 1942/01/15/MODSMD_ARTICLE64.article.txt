# THE
						TOMMY DORSEY ISSUE
## 
### 
r jTHE EDITOR, SIR:
I believe there is no doubt that Ex Committee and
the "student leaders" of our beloved University de
serve a hearty pat on the back for their action in
practically eliminating the consistently successful Sen
ior Prom, but it seems that there are quite a number
of students that feel the pat should be delivered nearer
the base of the spine and with a size twelve boot.
To be sure all of us want to do our part in na
tional defense and ultimate victory in the present war,
but aren't our "student leaders" losing their heads a
wee bit when they put their foot down on a $3.50
dance? After all, for the "cause" why don't they go
all out and be spending a larger sum? Certainly these
coming week-ends at Yosemite must cost slightly more
than $3.50, what with cost of transportation, meals,
lodging, cigarettes, and liquor. And if a person can
get through a date in San Francisco for less than
$3.50 I would like to learn his formula.
Of course, none of this will be done. You see, we
are all supposed to go to a Charity Ball and dance to
twenty records on a nickelodeon, or, if we are extra
lucky, to the scintillating capers of Herbert Sagebrush
and His Windjammers.
But just what about this Charity Ball? How much
do they figure to net for the "cause"? Right here is
where these advocates eliminate their own argument.
The thing to do is to contact Tommy Dorsey, make an
arrangement whereby both he and the Senior Class
donates a large percentage of the gate to the Red
Cross, or some other worthy organization. If the
Stanford student body wouldn't sacrifice and turn out
for that kind of a dance, then Dorsey's popularity must
certainly have dropped in the last six months or less.
Besides, the publicity wouldn't hurt Dorsey.
It seems with a dance outlined on that order you
would please the group that has plenty to spend in
spite of the war, and the group that doesn't have quite
so much but would still like to dance to a big-name
band once in a while.
Come on—if we actually have the democratic stu
dent government we are supposed to have at Stan
fodr, let's do something about this Senior Prom deal.
Sincerely,
W.H. S., Jr.
