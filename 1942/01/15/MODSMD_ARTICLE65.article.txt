# Russians Still Battering Nazis
## Vital German Bases Threatened by Reds 
### United Press 
The great Russian counter-offen
sive, which in 40 days has driven the
Germans from nearly 33,000 square
miles of the U.S.S.R., battered ahead
Wednesday against crumbling Nazi
defenses from the Baltic to the Black
Sea.
A half-dozen positions on the
bending German "winter defense
line" were in imminent danger, in
cluding Orel, Kharkov, Kursk and
Mozhaisk, and with each new Soviet
advance such Nazi rear bases as
Smolensk, Vyazma and Bryansk
were nearer to the fighting front.
In Libya, the British reported
"further satisfactory progress" in at
tacks on German and Italian armored
forces attempting to make a stand
along the Tripolitania border near
El Agheila. At the same time, bom
bardment of Halfaya, the sole re
maining Axis position in eastern
Cyrenaica, was continued and a
land assault appeared imminent.
Dispatches from Russia indicated
that the Red army not only was
pushing the Germans back but was
cutting dangerously between Nazi
armies. A Soviet spokesman said the
entire Moscow front was in move
ment and that the position of some
100,000 Germans in by-passed Moz
haisk was "unenviable." In that sec
tor Dorokhovo was taken by the
Russians.
