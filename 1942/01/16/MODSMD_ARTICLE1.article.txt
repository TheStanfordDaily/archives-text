### AMIE REICHERT 
YESTERDAY Sumner Welles start
ed playing a colossal game of
Information Piease with the Latin
American republics, and the big
question of the day was, "Is you or
ain't you with us?"
Since Pearl Harbor most of the
small Central American
have answered that question—the
right way. But the important re
publics, Argentina, Brazil. and
Chile, have been conspicuous by
their silence.
The Rio de Janeiro conference
which opened yesterday brought to
gether representatives from the 21
republics and Undersecretary of
State Welles, who is going to take
inventory. And there are signs of
trouble already with Argentina for
one.

I AST week Argentina's Foreign
J Minister Enrique Ruiz-Guinazu
threw a somewhat premature mon
key-wrench into the works, and at
the same time gave Mr. Welles an
idea of what was ahead, when he
declared that Argentina would not
agree to any alliances or "measures
of pre-belligerency" that might come
out of the Rio conference.
At the same time United Press
reported the unverified story that
Ruiz-Guinazu would walk out of
the conference if the other repub
lics insisted on breaking with the
Axis nations.
This is no surprise, for it has been
known for some time now that Ger
man, Italian, and Spanish Falangist
groups are considerably important
and powerful in Argentina.
Pro-'Axis sympathy in the top
three countries and their simulta
neous hesitancy to collaborate
with the U.S. has been the main
threat to hemispheric solidarity
which the State Department has
had to fight.
And without the unstinted co-op
eration of Argentina, Brazil, and
Chile, it is hard to see how any sort
of effective defense of the Westei'n
Hemisphere can be achieved.

'JTIE U.S. has dangled fat recipro
cal trade agreements, Good
Neighbor policies (something like
insurance policies) and even irre
pressible Mickey Rooney, before the
shifty eyes of the Argentinians. They
haven't ceased shifting their glances,
though, and far too many of them
turn in the direction of the Axis to
make things comfortable for us.
Apparently these inducements
haven't been enough—at least they
ha vent' been enough for the gov
ernment of Argentina which main
tains its benevolent neutrality
toward the Axis while the people
of that state are overwhelmingly
pro-U.S. and pro-Roosevelt (who
is almost a national hero there.)
The record of Ruiz-Guianzu's po
litical sentiments is a fair index to
those of his government as a whole,
lie is married to a German, is sym
pathetic to Franco, and believes that
Argentina's best bet is to play ball
with Europe's politics ,not the U.S.'s.

JpALANGISTS, Bundists, other
pro-Axis groups are powerful
and well-organized in this country.
Furthermore, not only the govern
ment is Axis-dominated, but much
of the press ana the airlines.
The government has made sev
eral superficial half-hearted shows
a( putting down "subversive activ
ities," hut it is well known (hat
these have been the barest of
gestures.
In short, a very dangerous, very
powerful threat to hemispheric soli
darity exists in South America today
in the form of fifth columns in the
major republics.

jYI R. WELLES' problem now is to
convince these republics that
the wave of the future is not rolling
from Nazified Europe today but
from North Amrica and her allies,
the United Nations.
And to sccure tangible evidence
of Latin America's good faith, he
will probably ask for unanimous
severance of relations with the
Axis.
This will require a clean-up of
anti-American activities among Axis
agents and sympathizers and tour
ists, and will insure the continued
flow of vital raw materials to this
country from South America.
