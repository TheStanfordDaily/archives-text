WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP).—A
crack Japanese liner—possibly oper
ating as an aircraft carrier—and at
least two enemy bombers were de
stroyed by American forces today in
the Far East fighting.
At the same time, the Navy warned
that the German U-boat menace
along the east coast remains "sub
stantial."
Biggest catch of the day was the
17,000-ton liner of the Yawata class.
It was blasted to the bottom some
where in the far Pacific by a sub
marine from Admiral Thomas C.
Hart's Asiatic fleet. It was the larg
est enemy merchant craft known to
have been sunk by U.S. naval units.
Sinking of the liner was an
nounced in Navy Communique No.
28, less than two hours after the
Army revealed the Japanese had re
newed their aerial bombardment of
Corregidor foi'tress — Manila Bay
anchor of Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's
Luzon lines—but were driven off by
anti-aircraft fire which bagged two
and possibly more bombers.
The Army also reported Mac A
rthur's out-numbered Bataan de
fenders were continuing to with
stand renewed attacks by large Jap
ground contingents.
