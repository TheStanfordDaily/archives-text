# One-Act Play Winners Named
## 
### 
"And Then the Dusk" by Adolfo
Arias, "Great. Grandfather Marquis"
by Ted Marcuse, and "Harvest Time"
by Charles Trieschmann, were se
lected yesterday by Rani's Head as
the winners of its annual one-act
play competition.
The plays will be presented to
Stanford audiences on Friday, Feb.
13, and Saturday, Feb. 14, in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall.
At yesterday's meeting Bob Libott
was appointed to direct "Harvest
Time"; Lyle Mayer, "And Then the
Dusk"; and Lenneth Spenker, "Great
Grandfather Marquis." Hal Levitt
was awarded the technical director
ship.
Tryouts for the three plays will
be held Monday from 3 to 6 p.m.
in the round table room of Memorial
Hall, according to Libott. He em
phasized that the tryouts are open
to any student in the University.
"We want to emphasize the open
tryouts particularly," he said last
night, "because there seems to be a
fairly prevalent idea that only Ram's
Head members can try out.
"The plays arc open to anyone
who can act well enough to get a
part, and everyone working on the
show, either acting or on crew, is
given points toward Ram's Head
membership."
