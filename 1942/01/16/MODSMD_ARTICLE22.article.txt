# War Blueprint Calls for Twice Present Force
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP). —
The nation' tonight was given a
glimpse of a gigantic military blue
print including expeditionary forces
and which will douhcl the war
strength of the Army to 3,600,000
men this year and include vast ex
pansion of mechanized ground farces
and an air corps second to none.
The far-reaching plan—already
approved by President Roosevelt
was disclosed by Secretary of War
Henry L. Stimson. He indicated it
contemplates expeditionary forces.
He said there will be adequate fa
cilities for the big Army because
many men now under training will
be sent overseas.
HERSHEY EXPLAINS
Brig. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Na
tional Selective Service director,
said meanwhile that the plan can be
achieved without calling up men
who have dependents.
He said he has "something over
1,000,000" Class 1-A selectees in re
serve and that the 900,000 additional
men required could be obtained
through reclassification — with no
change in present; regulations—from
the 20 to 44 age group who will reg
ister Feb. 16.
He estimated that new registrants
in the 20-21 group would total
2,000,000 and that from 50 to 60 per
cent of them would be eligible for
immediate service, while 5 per cent
probably will be drawn from the .6-
44 class.
NO BROKEN HOMES!
He reiterated that the Selective
Service will follow the rules about
men with dependents as closely as
possible so as not to disrupt families.
Stimson told a press conference
the Army's program will doubt the
armored forces, more than double
air combat strength, and add 32 new
triangular divisions to the present 27.
The strength of the Army — now
standing at 1,700,000 men—thus will
be raised to 3,600,000 by the end of
the year.

said meanwhile that the plan can be
achieved without calling up men
who have dependents.
He said he has "something over
1,000,000" Class 1-A selectees in re
serve and that the 900,000 additional
men required could be obtained
through reclassification — with no
change in present; regulations—from
the 20 to 44 age group who will reg
ister Feb. 16.
He estimated that new registrants
in the 20-21 group would total
2,000,000 and that from 50 to 60 per
cent of them would be eligible for
immediate service, while 5 per cent
probably will be drawn from the .6-
44 class.
NO BROKEN HOMES!
He reiterated that the Selective
Service will follow the rules about
men with dependents as closely as
possible so as not to disrupt families.
Stimson told a press conference
the Army's program will doubt the
armored forces, more than double
air combat strength, and add 32 new
triangular divisions to the present 27.
The strength of the Army — now
standing at 1,700,000 men—thus will
be raised to 3,600,000 by the end of
the year.
