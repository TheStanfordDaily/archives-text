### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Busiest member of the Army Air
Corps examining staff at the B.A.C.
building is curly-headed Secretary
Janet Goodier.
"Married or unmarried? Previous
experience or C.A.A. training? Pre
vious physical examinations?" Miss
Goodier shoots the questions to Air-
Corps applicants while she pounds
out the answers on her typewriter.
As soon as she finishes interview
ing an applicant, he is turned over
to an army officer for his physical
exam. This includes testing ol
eyes, ears, posture, cardiovascular
system, respiratory system, nervous
system, and X-rays ol chest, bones,
and muscles.
CONDITIONED ALSO
"I'm afraid I'm in for some of this
physical conditionig too," Miss Good
ier said. "You see all United Slates
government employes are required
to take anti-tetanus shots, smallpox
vaccinations, and typhoid innocula
tions."
Just then a major beckoned to
her to come into the examining
room.
,"Oh me, here goes my first anti
tetanus shot," she moaned. Laughs
and consolations arose from the other
army officers in the room. Two
sharp shrieks followed. Miss Goodier
emerged smiling but slightly pale.
A helpful officer pounded and exer
cised the sore arm to "get it in shape
again."
"Life in the army is really great
sport," Miss Goodier continued, "al
though I've just been in since the
first of Januaryâ€”officially, that is.
Actually we're an army family from
way back. My father is a major in
the Army Air Corps at Fort Scott
now."
TRANSIENT WIVES
Because Fort Scott is a combat
zone, all of its occupants are re
quired to carry gas masks at all
times while in the fort. Most of the
army wives have packed their sil
verware and other transportable
valuables so they can move them im
mediately in case of an air raid.
The Southern Traveling Aviation
Cadet Examining Board official
name of the organization for which
Miss Goodier is secretary came to
Stanford from Reno. The Board
will leave here Saturday for San
Jose State. From San Jose it will go
south as far as Pasadena, and then
inland. The Board also covers uni
versities and colleges in Utah.
