# Santa Clara's Patrick Headlines Varsity, Larabel Steads Frosh
## 
### BOB SONTAG BILL HORNBY 
Out of a pile of press clippings and booming publicity tom-toms comes
Stan Patrick, Santa Clara's high-scoring sensation, to lead the Broncos
against Stanford in a return cage battle in the Pavilion at S p.m. The
Redskins meet San Jose State here tomorrow night.
Santa Clara, most powerful non-conference club in the Bay area, is

after its second victory, having over-t
come the Indians during winter va
cation, 31-21.
Pet trick Patrick has already
bombed the hoop for 178 points in
11 games, an average of better than
16 per game.
FROM 40 FEET
The classy forward hits the hoop
regularly with a push shot anywhere
within 40 feet. Stanford's Don Bur- !
ness uses the push variety almost
exclusively, but the Indian co-cap
tain doesn't very often shoot from
40 feet.
Then there's Dick "Skippy"
Mangan, Santa Clara chalk wield- ,
er. Mangan may have a little
trouble tonight trying to draw
plays for bis teammates with his
chalk on (he Pavilion floor. It's
mighty slick and waxy, and Man
gan's remote control coaching an- |
tics may slide right out of his I
lingers.
With the Indians' defense set for
Patrick, Coach George Barsi of
Santa Clara may pull a pseudo-coup
and let Patrick feed to his forward
partner, Sam Alaimo.
VOSS STARTS
With Stanford's six-foot-five cen
ter Ed Voss back in the starting
line-up, the Indians will present a
skyscraping quintet, averaging six
four. Remainder of the squad is as
usual, Burness and Jim Pollard, for
wards, and Bill Cowden and Howard
Da 11 mar, guards.
The first time Stanford and
Santa Clara met, Pollard was in
eligible. Tonight it's an "all-out"
attack against a veteran club.
Watch the Bronc figure-eight
movement clashing with Stanford's
giant zone defense. That defending
set-up kept St. Mary's out of the
foul circle throughout the first half
when the Indians shaded the Gaels
last week. 36-35.
POISON BOYSEN
Tomorrow night's Patrick of San
Jose should turn up in the guise of
Don Boysen, top-scoring forward of
the Spartans. Boysen has tallied 95
points in 8 encounters.
Bert Robinson, home from Hono
lulu after being stranded on the
island when Japanese attacked Pearl
Harbor, is back in the Spartan fold i
and has bolstered the guard spot [
tremendously.
Stu Carter, Robinson's mate at
forward, is a little barrel-chested
mite, sparkplug of the outfit, a great
floor player and dribbler,
F|VE OUT OF EIGHT
Bill Helbush, guard, worried the
Indians last year with push shots
and when "hot." can score with
"pogo-pass" attempts from far out.
At the pivot position the Spartans
present Bill Clark, former star
eager at Placer J.C.
That gives Coach Walt McPherson's
boys five out of eight, and they're
improving with every game.
Tonight's line-up:
, STANFORD SANTA CLARA
Burness F Patrick
Pollard F Aliamo
oss C Sohroven
Dallmar G Mangan
Cowden G Green

Paced by sharp-shooting Chuck Lara he I. high-scoring record holder of
San Francisco High School hoop realms, the Santa Clara freshmen tangle
with the Farm yearlings tonight at 6: 15.
Underneath the newly blacked-out Pavilion. Fred Parsons, Bob Bar
socchini. Jack llcald, Dave Brown, and Bob Hall will take the court in a

â™¦ try for their second win of the year.
Saturday night a repeat performance
will be given against the San Jose
j lreshmen.
Two difficulties face Coaches Phil
Bengtson and Woodie Weir as the
freshman season rolls into full
swing. First, the sometimes-quite
bad-and-often-mediocre defense of
their offensive minded charges, and.
secondly, a lack of reserve material
for sudden emergencies. On these
two problems the frosh squad has
been working during the week. The
; amount of success will be recorded
J tonight and tomorrow night.
RESERVES LISTED
Reserves likely to play in tonight's
clash, unless it is such a close spree
that the first five must stay in, are
Dave Porter, Dave Pate, Fred Per-*
riagaro, and Bob Hagopian at guasds,
Hart well at center, and Brown and
i Herrick at forwards.
Carlos Brown, freshman speed
ster from Panama, lias been fitting
into the forward position with in
creasing frequency during (his
week's practice, and may develop
into the forward (hat could re
place Parsons or Barsocchini.
Such a gentleman is most sorely
i needed.
TALL PIVOT MAN
The Santa Clarans build their at
| tack around Larabel, with forward
' Dick O'Keefe, formerly of St. Johns,
the second spot boy in the Bronc set
i up. Heald's 6 feet 2 inches at center
will be matched by a reported 6 feet
five inches on the part of the Bronc
pivot man, and rumors of the in
vading squad promise that at least
they will equal if not exceed the
Stanfordites in length.
Three of the five Card starters
played against Larabel and several
of his mates last year.
