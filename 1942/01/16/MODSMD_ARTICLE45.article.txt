r |nV() STANFORD football players who were considered good phiytv
! when working for the Indians, but who were GREATS when playing
for (!>e championship Chicago Bears (his past fall, returned to (he campus
j (his week.
Of course, Norm Standlee and Hugh Gallarneau were recognized as
very important cogs in the Clark Shaughnessy-coached Indian team that
went through the 1940 season undefeated. Standlee was so good when he
was in good health that the opposition was afraid of him even when he
was injured. Gallarneau was the boy who did the heavy work in the baek
j field, especially when Standlee was on the injured list.
Their real value, however, was never fully realized until they were
gone and the people could see how much Stanford missed them and how
much use the Bears made of them. It is a good bet that, had it been pos
sible in 1040 for the sport scribes throughout the nation to loresee how

much good football Standlee and
| Gallarneau would play in 1941, one
or both of the boys would have made
a great many more of the All-Amer
: ica selections than they did.
i 11' they hadn't been in pro football
| this past season or if they hadn't
: turned in such marvelous perform
; ances, it would have been much
, more difficult than it is to explain
: Stanford's losing three games this
I year.
* * *
W/HEN the National Professional
| Football League meeting was
held and it was announced that the
Chicago Bears had priority rights on
Stanford's All-American, Frankie
Albert, we had great visions of
three-quarters of the 1940 Stanford
J backfield rolling over, through, and
| around all opposition in the Western
I division.
It was a beautiful picture and
would have been even better if it
had been possible for the Bears to
nab Pete Kmetovic, too. But now it
doesn't appear likely that any,such

thing will take place, with the probability that any or all of the ex-Card j
backs will be in the armed forces before another grid season rolls around, j
When Hap Everett asked Gallarneau about the advertised weight of '
Standlee this year, 230 pounds, Hugh .said that the Chief was really carry
ing a lot more weight this year than he did while playing college ball.
From the moving pictures of Standlee we saw, it was very evident that
the Chief was really bowling 'em over. One shot showed him being hit by
at least three potential tacklers; yet he kept right on moving. He didn't
drag the tacklers with him; he just boomed right through them and left ,
them lying on the turf with armfuls of nothing.
Gallarneau also reported the following items:
1. The lack of spectators at the Bear-Giant fracas was not a waning
of interest in the game but rather a seige of terrible weather. They
couldn't report the weather conditions over the radio.
2. Almost all of the Pacific Coast footballers in the professional
ranks are making good showings.

JN THE last few weeks, with the opening basketball game of the Southern
Division of the Pacific Coast Conference still a couple of weeks off,
Stanford has been nominated to wind up the regular season in from any
where from first to third place.
The Indians, the defending division champs, are recognized as an out
standing outfit, but the experts appear dubious as to whether or not Coach
Everett Dean's boys will be able to hold together throughout the season.
Which is a very good point.
For ihe past several seasons —since Hank Luisetti and the "Laughing
Boys" left the Farm—Stanford hoop combines have had a hard time play- j
ing outstanding ball for two nights in a row. Friday night has almost al
ways been the night that the Indians looked their best. On Saturday
nights they look like a different team, which is understandable in view of i
the strenuousness of the game, especially Stanford's type of game.
However, it seems to us that due to the height of this year's outfit, the !
boys will be able to play an easier, sometimes slower, basketball game, thus
being in shape to play two good games on successive nights.
But this isn't saying that the Indians are a shoo-in for the title, for
only Ucla seems to be out of the picture.
Cal and U.S.C. should be good.

When Hap Everett asked Gallarneau about the advertised weight of '
Standlee this year, 230 pounds, Hugh .said that the Chief was really carry
ing a lot more weight this year than he did while playing college ball.
From the moving pictures of Standlee we saw, it was very evident that
the Chief was really bowling 'em over. One shot showed him being hit by
at least three potential tacklers; yet he kept right on moving. He didn't
drag the tacklers with him; he just boomed right through them and left ,
them lying on the turf with armfuls of nothing.
Gallarneau also reported the following items:
1. The lack of spectators at the Bear-Giant fracas was not a waning
of interest in the game but rather a seige of terrible weather. They
couldn't report the weather conditions over the radio.
2. Almost all of the Pacific Coast footballers in the professional
ranks are making good showings.

JN THE last few weeks, with the opening basketball game of the Southern
Division of the Pacific Coast Conference still a couple of weeks off,
Stanford has been nominated to wind up the regular season in from any
where from first to third place.
The Indians, the defending division champs, are recognized as an out
standing outfit, but the experts appear dubious as to whether or not Coach
Everett Dean's boys will be able to hold together throughout the season.
Which is a very good point.
For ihe past several seasons —since Hank Luisetti and the "Laughing
Boys" left the Farm—Stanford hoop combines have had a hard time play- j
ing outstanding ball for two nights in a row. Friday night has almost al
ways been the night that the Indians looked their best. On Saturday
nights they look like a different team, which is understandable in view of i
the strenuousness of the game, especially Stanford's type of game.
However, it seems to us that due to the height of this year's outfit, the !
boys will be able to play an easier, sometimes slower, basketball game, thus
being in shape to play two good games on successive nights.
But this isn't saying that the Indians are a shoo-in for the title, for
only Ucla seems to be out of the picture.
Cal and U.S.C. should be good.

r |nV() STANFORD football players who were considered good phiytv
! when working for the Indians, but who were GREATS when playing
for (!>e championship Chicago Bears (his past fall, returned to (he campus
j (his week.
Of course, Norm Standlee and Hugh Gallarneau were recognized as
very important cogs in the Clark Shaughnessy-coached Indian team that
went through the 1940 season undefeated. Standlee was so good when he
was in good health that the opposition was afraid of him even when he
was injured. Gallarneau was the boy who did the heavy work in the baek
j field, especially when Standlee was on the injured list.
Their real value, however, was never fully realized until they were
gone and the people could see how much Stanford missed them and how
much use the Bears made of them. It is a good bet that, had it been pos
sible in 1040 for the sport scribes throughout the nation to loresee how

much good football Standlee and
| Gallarneau would play in 1941, one
or both of the boys would have made
a great many more of the All-Amer
: ica selections than they did.
i 11' they hadn't been in pro football
| this past season or if they hadn't
: turned in such marvelous perform
; ances, it would have been much
, more difficult than it is to explain
: Stanford's losing three games this
I year.
* * *
W/HEN the National Professional
| Football League meeting was
held and it was announced that the
Chicago Bears had priority rights on
Stanford's All-American, Frankie
Albert, we had great visions of
three-quarters of the 1940 Stanford
J backfield rolling over, through, and
| around all opposition in the Western
I division.
It was a beautiful picture and
would have been even better if it
had been possible for the Bears to
nab Pete Kmetovic, too. But now it
doesn't appear likely that any,such

thing will take place, with the probability that any or all of the ex-Card j
backs will be in the armed forces before another grid season rolls around, j
When Hap Everett asked Gallarneau about the advertised weight of '
Standlee this year, 230 pounds, Hugh .said that the Chief was really carry
ing a lot more weight this year than he did while playing college ball.
From the moving pictures of Standlee we saw, it was very evident that
the Chief was really bowling 'em over. One shot showed him being hit by
at least three potential tacklers; yet he kept right on moving. He didn't
drag the tacklers with him; he just boomed right through them and left ,
them lying on the turf with armfuls of nothing.
Gallarneau also reported the following items:
1. The lack of spectators at the Bear-Giant fracas was not a waning
of interest in the game but rather a seige of terrible weather. They
couldn't report the weather conditions over the radio.
2. Almost all of the Pacific Coast footballers in the professional
ranks are making good showings.

JN THE last few weeks, with the opening basketball game of the Southern
Division of the Pacific Coast Conference still a couple of weeks off,
Stanford has been nominated to wind up the regular season in from any
where from first to third place.
The Indians, the defending division champs, are recognized as an out
standing outfit, but the experts appear dubious as to whether or not Coach
Everett Dean's boys will be able to hold together throughout the season.
Which is a very good point.
For ihe past several seasons —since Hank Luisetti and the "Laughing
Boys" left the Farm—Stanford hoop combines have had a hard time play- j
ing outstanding ball for two nights in a row. Friday night has almost al
ways been the night that the Indians looked their best. On Saturday
nights they look like a different team, which is understandable in view of i
the strenuousness of the game, especially Stanford's type of game.
However, it seems to us that due to the height of this year's outfit, the !
boys will be able to play an easier, sometimes slower, basketball game, thus
being in shape to play two good games on successive nights.
But this isn't saying that the Indians are a shoo-in for the title, for
only Ucla seems to be out of the picture.
Cal and U.S.C. should be good.
