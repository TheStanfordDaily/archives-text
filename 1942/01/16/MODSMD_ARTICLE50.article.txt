# Case for the Councils
## 
### 
pi today's front page is a siory about Men's
(J Council and the action it took in cases in
lvjng three separate violations of the Honor
Code.
The penalties are stiff. They could have been
eV en stiffer.
It takes a story like this to make us all sit up
and take note. Most of us go on from day to day
and the Honor Code is really second nature to
as. No thought of breaking it enters our mind.
But at times it is broken. These penalties show
what happens.
Contrary to what some of the student body
may think, these penalties were imposed by
fellow-students, not the Administration. The
Councils do not like to have to take such action.
But it is their responsibility to do so.
The rest of us have a responsibility too, in
addition to observing the Code ourselves. Some
violations go unnoticed and never reach the
Councils. Others are noticed by students and
never reach the Councils.
If we would continue to live at Stanford
under the Honor Code—and who would like
to see it abolished?—it is our responsibility to
report violations as well as it is the Councils'
responsibility to assess penalties for them.
