WEDNESDAY night a famous, top - notch
world analyst, writer, and newspaperman
came to Stanford not to lecture but to chat with
his audience, to let them in on his tremendous
store of knowledge gained from covering wars
since 1913.
We are at Stanford to study and to learn as
much as we can. Some of our knowledge we
get first-hand from experiments. The rest we
get second- and third-hand from professors and
books. Teachers, for instance in history, pre
sent the long-range, correlated viewpoint of the
world's happenings. They can't be on the
spot all the time to gather first-hand information.
But there are some men who are always on
the spot. The type of information they have to
offer is a very valuable and necessary supple
ment to what we can gain from lectures and
books.
But when one of these men comes to Stan
ford, his student audience is practically nil.
Wednesday night rushing interfered, but it is
so not only this time, but all the rest of the
time. This student association, even in these
days when competent information is at a pre
mium cannot support a lecture series They

Wednesday night le* than 10 per cent c

faculty.
