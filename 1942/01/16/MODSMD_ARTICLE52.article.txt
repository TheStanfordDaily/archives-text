OUR (JIANTS
>r snappy basketball team takes the
£ floor again tonight, this time to avenge the defeat
3r .suffered at hands of the Santa Clara Broncos dur
'j nJ r the Chn- inas vacation games. The Indians are the
defending Wampions of the southern division of the
Conference and this year they seem to have a better
team than they had last year. But as yet the team
, r . hasn't minded, out into quite the powerful machine
that they appear to be on paper. In tonight's game I
think yoit will find the giants more co-ordinated, and
! theysiiuldd be able to bottle up the touted sophomore
or I sensation* Stan Patrick, and thump the Broncos.
- This year's team is an exceptional team because of
I their size. I think the average of the starting line-up
. lowers somewhere to 6.4, and besides this, all five of
| the starters, maybe with the possible exception of Ed
liss, are very fast and springy. Despite their big size,
, boys like Cowden, Dallmar, Burness and the sopho
aore Pollard have an amazing ability to the
court and backboard, and all of them can handle the
ball with speed, accuracy and finesse. If Voss is a
little slow, he can easily be excused because he is G-5 ] /2
and anyone that tall doesn't have to have exceptional
speed. I went out to practice the other day, and I have
been feeling tex-rible and smaller ever since.
Now when you have such height and speed and
from these two factors, game control, you don't have to
have exceptionally brilliant shots on your team to win
games. But this team again isn't lacking in "dead"
shooters. Probably the most consistent shot on the
team at the present time is Burness. Burness can throw
a shot from almost any position, and if his knee doesn't
bother him, he should this year fulfill all the promises
that he gave in his earlier years. Pollard is only a
sophomore but he is another brilliant shooter. The
pressure has been on him to some extent because of
syndicated stories and such which compared him to
Luisetti, but even so, he has made a fine start, and
promises to be one of the finest basketball players
developed at Stanford before he is through. Dallmar is
another boy that has a very impressive record. I
haven't seen him play as much as I have watched the
other boys, but he seems very aggressive and he seems
the type that learns and improves with every game.
# * * $

of the surprises to me was the improvement
made by Voss. Voss is much smoother this year
than he was last year, and his shooting eye is much
sharper. Coach Everett Dean seems to have the knack
for developing these giant centers, if you will remem
ber the remarkable improvements that Dick Taylor
made last year. Cowden is the other starter, and though
his shots from 30 feet out, when he is set, aren't so
good, he can be counted on for points when closer in
to the basket, and he can also be counted on to get
very hot on occasions. Behind these boys are others
who can play ball, boys like Jack Dana, Freddy Linari,
Tom Fuller, John Eikleman, Leo McCaffery and Fred
Oliver, all with some experience, and any one of whom
has possibilities for improvement.
One thing about the team that I don't think has ever
been mentioned is that almost everyone of the boys is
a glamour boy. They are the best looking basketball
team that I have ever seen anywhere. That should be
a tremendous drawing card, and it is too bad the boys
couldn't have shown themselves in the Madison Square
Garden, as they sometimes do.
With their speed, size, shooting ability and good
looks, this team is liable to explode at any time, and
I really pity their opponents on the nights they do.

Luisetti, but even so, he has made a fine start, and
promises to be one of the finest basketball players
developed at Stanford before he is through. Dallmar is
another boy that has a very impressive record. I
haven't seen him play as much as I have watched the
other boys, but he seems very aggressive and he seems
the type that learns and improves with every game.
# * * $

of the surprises to me was the improvement
made by Voss. Voss is much smoother this year
than he was last year, and his shooting eye is much
sharper. Coach Everett Dean seems to have the knack
for developing these giant centers, if you will remem
ber the remarkable improvements that Dick Taylor
made last year. Cowden is the other starter, and though
his shots from 30 feet out, when he is set, aren't so
good, he can be counted on for points when closer in
to the basket, and he can also be counted on to get
very hot on occasions. Behind these boys are others
who can play ball, boys like Jack Dana, Freddy Linari,
Tom Fuller, John Eikleman, Leo McCaffery and Fred
Oliver, all with some experience, and any one of whom
has possibilities for improvement.
One thing about the team that I don't think has ever
been mentioned is that almost everyone of the boys is
a glamour boy. They are the best looking basketball
team that I have ever seen anywhere. That should be
a tremendous drawing card, and it is too bad the boys
couldn't have shown themselves in the Madison Square
Garden, as they sometimes do.
With their speed, size, shooting ability and good
looks, this team is liable to explode at any time, and
I really pity their opponents on the nights they do.
OUR (JIANTS
>r snappy basketball team takes the
£ floor again tonight, this time to avenge the defeat
3r .suffered at hands of the Santa Clara Broncos dur
'j nJ r the Chn- inas vacation games. The Indians are the
defending Wampions of the southern division of the
Conference and this year they seem to have a better
team than they had last year. But as yet the team
, r . hasn't minded, out into quite the powerful machine
that they appear to be on paper. In tonight's game I
think yoit will find the giants more co-ordinated, and
! theysiiuldd be able to bottle up the touted sophomore
or I sensation* Stan Patrick, and thump the Broncos.
- This year's team is an exceptional team because of
I their size. I think the average of the starting line-up
. lowers somewhere to 6.4, and besides this, all five of
| the starters, maybe with the possible exception of Ed
liss, are very fast and springy. Despite their big size,
, boys like Cowden, Dallmar, Burness and the sopho
aore Pollard have an amazing ability to the
court and backboard, and all of them can handle the
ball with speed, accuracy and finesse. If Voss is a
little slow, he can easily be excused because he is G-5 ] /2
and anyone that tall doesn't have to have exceptional
speed. I went out to practice the other day, and I have
been feeling tex-rible and smaller ever since.
Now when you have such height and speed and
from these two factors, game control, you don't have to
have exceptionally brilliant shots on your team to win
games. But this team again isn't lacking in "dead"
shooters. Probably the most consistent shot on the
team at the present time is Burness. Burness can throw
a shot from almost any position, and if his knee doesn't
bother him, he should this year fulfill all the promises
that he gave in his earlier years. Pollard is only a
sophomore but he is another brilliant shooter. The
pressure has been on him to some extent because of
syndicated stories and such which compared him to
Luisetti, but even so, he has made a fine start, and

team than they had last year. But as yet the team
, r . hasn't minded, out into quite the powerful machine
that they appear to be on paper. In tonight's game I
think yoit will find the giants more co-ordinated, and
! theysiiuldd be able to bottle up the touted sophomore
or I sensation* Stan Patrick, and thump the Broncos.
- This year's team is an exceptional team because of
I their size. I think the average of the starting line-up
. lowers somewhere to 6.4, and besides this, all five of
| the starters, maybe with the possible exception of Ed
liss, are very fast and springy. Despite their big size,
, boys like Cowden, Dallmar, Burness and the sopho
aore Pollard have an amazing ability to the
court and backboard, and all of them can handle the
ball with speed, accuracy and finesse. If Voss is a
little slow, he can easily be excused because he is G-5 ] /2
and anyone that tall doesn't have to have exceptional
speed. I went out to practice the other day, and I have
been feeling tex-rible and smaller ever since.
Now when you have such height and speed and
from these two factors, game control, you don't have to
have exceptionally brilliant shots on your team to win
games. But this team again isn't lacking in "dead"
shooters. Probably the most consistent shot on the
team at the present time is Burness. Burness can throw
a shot from almost any position, and if his knee doesn't
bother him, he should this year fulfill all the promises
that he gave in his earlier years. Pollard is only a
sophomore but he is another brilliant shooter. The
pressure has been on him to some extent because of
syndicated stories and such which compared him to
Luisetti, but even so, he has made a fine start, and
promises to be one of the finest basketball players
developed at Stanford before he is through. Dallmar is
another boy that has a very impressive record. I
haven't seen him play as much as I have watched the
other boys, but he seems very aggressive and he seems
the type that learns and improves with every game.

of the surprises to me was the improvement
made by Voss. Voss is much smoother this year
than he was last year, and his shooting eye is much
sharper. Coach Everett Dean seems to have the knack
for developing these giant centers, if you will remem
ber the remarkable improvements that Dick Taylor
made last year. Cowden is the other starter, and though
his shots from 30 feet out, when he is set, aren't so
good, he can be counted on for points when closer in
to the basket, and he can also be counted on to get
very hot on occasions. Behind these boys are others
who can play ball, boys like Jack Dana, Freddy Linari,
Tom Fuller, John Eikleman, Leo McCaffery and Fred
Oliver, all with some experience, and any one of whom
has possibilities for improvement.
One thing about the team that I don't think has ever
been mentioned is that almost everyone of the boys is
a glamour boy. They are the best looking basketball
team that I have ever seen anywhere. That should be
a tremendous drawing card, and it is too bad the boys
couldn't have shown themselves in the Madison Square
Garden, as they sometimes do.
With their speed, size, shooting ability and good
looks, this team is liable to explode at any time, and
I really pity their opponents on the nights they do.
