# CAMPUS OPINION
## NO AFFAIR 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
It is all very well, though a trifle indiscreet, for
Peggy Perring to announce that she will have "some
type of affair" this quarter. I am a senior, and I
haven't had one yet—not one in four years.
Excom agreed a week ago to let their policy on big
name bands be governed by the popular reception of
the Senior Prom. Now they have solved that problem
very neatly by relegating the prom to the ashcan. I do
not believe the arguments of Isabel Fawcett or Jim
McKellar to be either factual or representative. If
any "recent developments" have occurred within the
last week which have made a white elephant of the
second most popular band in the country and have
made the senior class desire to dance to a harmonica
band instead, then I haven't heard of them. After all,
this hypocritical argument of Excom's is not concerned
about whether it is unpatriotic or poor taste to dance
and be frivolous while the country is at war, but
merely with the inadvisability of having good music at
the dance.
The Excom has recently avowed its intention of re
focusing social activity onto the campus. Yet their
name band ruling will focus social activity a mile and
a half from the campus, where students will be able
to get Dorsey from a juke box and name their poisons.
I must protest their ruling; I don't give a damn about
dancing, but I like to drink in peace.
As ever,

(Dear Arby: Just don't forget that you can just
cram (>OO couples into the Pavilion. Estimated ex
penses, $1800 (band $1700 and everything else
$100). At $:J per bid, total intake, $1800. That isn't
going to help build up our treasury very much.
And don't forget all the new noisy slot machines
being installed around here. They're pretty dis
turbing to peaceful drinking.—The Editor)
