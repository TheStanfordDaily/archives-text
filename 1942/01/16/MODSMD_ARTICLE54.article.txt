r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
I am planning to go into the aviation industry
when I finish Stanford. I have been told that a promi
nent authority on aviation will speak Monday night
on the Men's Vocational Problems series. Naturally I
am anxious to hear this man; but I am looking forward
to his talk with rather dismal expectations, because the
talk will be given in Encina lobby.
Doubtless there will be a large crowd to hear a
speech of such importance to so many students. The
small seating capacity and unsuitability of that room
for such programs is evident. I know many people
will miss the full value of this meeting, and some will
probably even be kept from attending for just this
reason.
The whole campus is waking up to the importance of
these Vocom talks. Why can't they be given in some
larger and more suitable auditorium so that all those
interested may attend and receive the full benefit of
them?
