"THE GERMANS: DOUBLE HISTORY OF A NATION," by Emil Lud
wig. Little, Hidwii and Company. $1.
It is unfortunate tliat as erudite and intelligent a man and as important
a figure in contemporary literature as Emil Ludwig should pick his
greatest subject at a time when in all men's minds that subicct has become

a monster of unreasonable propor-'
lions and malevolence.
In fact, it would be safe to say
that no writer, unless he is excep
tionally independent of popular em
otions, should attempt to treat the
Germans historically or in any other
way at this time if he wishes his
work to be viewed by posterity as
intelligent, impartial and worth
while. For at a time when all civ
ilized peoples look on the German
nation with hatred in their hearts,
one cannot expect them to produce
literature in which that nation is
viewed with the calm, critical eye
which is so necessary to all good his
torical, political and biographical
writers.
VIOLENT ACTIONS
As the name of the book suggests,
Ludwig takes as his theme a theory
which many people have adopted to
explain the violent actions of the
German nation in the last century
and a half and at the same time to
pay tribute to the genius of German
individuals such as Goethe and
Beethoven. This paradox is possible
because of the "double" character of
the Germans, according to Ludwig,
which makes them individually
great and politically impotent. Goethe
summed up the idea when he wrote
"Germany is nothing, but every in
dividual is much, and yet the Ger
mans imagine the reverse to be
true."
Ludwig attempts to prove this
theme by telling the whole history
of the Germans since Ariovistus
flaunted Julius Caesar on the plains
of Gaul. Every event, every person
ality which appears in the story is
used by the author to illustrate his
thesis.
POINT PROOF
This is, of course, nothing less than
historical prostitution. It is the tell
ing of history for the purpose of
proving a controversial point, which
is not only petty but undeserving of
the name history.
The book itself is the usual liter
ary masterpiece which we have be
come accustomed to expect from
Ludwig. It contains all his usual
characteristics: excellent, readable
style; an emphasis on personalities
and psychoanalytical treatment of
them; constant reference to Goethe
(the book is filled with exquisite
quotations); unbounded praise and
admiration for heroic characters and
unabated scorn for those who incur
the author's dislike.
AXE TO GRIND
If Ludwig felt it necessary to
write his history of the Germans
with an axe to grind (though it is
hard to see how such a motive
could be other than a detracting
factor) there is contained in "The
Germans" the germ of a much more
interesting, more intelligent and cer
tainly more tenable thesis. It is to

be found in the following paragraph,
which follows the author's descrip
tion of how a bullet that, if it had
found its mark, would have prevent
ed the war of 18(57 and probably the
war of 1870 had been miraculously
stopped by one of Bismark's ribs:
"While the lib in Bismark's
chest snapped back into place . . .
Karl Marx . . . was writing that
history was purely a consequence
of economic factors."
Here, then, is a theme worthy of
the great Ludwig. It is unique in a
world saturated by thinking along
lines of economic determinism; it
may be supported by simple recita
tion of historical events; the enemy
is definite and easy to see and under
stand; and Ludwig above all through
his biographical treatment of history
has already done more than any
other man to advance the theory.
But to the exiled Ludwig the state
of mind of the anti-German peoples
—natural enough—combined with his
own resentment — also understand
able —to drive him to one of the
worst of intellectual crimes—the per
version of history. It is a step which
all his many admirers of the pres
ent and future will regret.—Minahan

of mind of the anti-German peoples
—natural enough—combined with his

"THE GERMANS: DOUBLE HISTORY OF A NATION," by Emil Lud

It is unfortunate tliat as erudite and intelligent a man and as important
a figure in contemporary literature as Emil Ludwig should pick his
greatest subject at a time when in all men's minds that subicct has become

a monster of unreasonable propor-'
lions and malevolence.
In fact, it would be safe to say
that no writer, unless he is excep
tionally independent of popular em
otions, should attempt to treat the
Germans historically or in any other
way at this time if he wishes his
work to be viewed by posterity as
intelligent, impartial and worth
while. For at a time when all civ
ilized peoples look on the German
nation with hatred in their hearts,
one cannot expect them to produce
literature in which that nation is
viewed with the calm, critical eye
which is so necessary to all good his
torical, political and biographical
writers.
VIOLENT ACTIONS
As the name of the book suggests,
Ludwig takes as his theme a theory
which many people have adopted to
explain the violent actions of the
German nation in the last century
and a half and at the same time to
pay tribute to the genius of German
individuals such as Goethe and
Beethoven. This paradox is possible
because of the "double" character of
the Germans, according to Ludwig,
which makes them individually
great and politically impotent. Goethe
summed up the idea when he wrote
"Germany is nothing, but every in
dividual is much, and yet the Ger
mans imagine the reverse to be
true."
Ludwig attempts to prove this
theme by telling the whole history
of the Germans since Ariovistus
flaunted Julius Caesar on the plains
of Gaul. Every event, every person
ality which appears in the story is
used by the author to illustrate his
thesis.
POINT PROOF
This is, of course, nothing less than
historical prostitution. It is the tell
ing of history for the purpose of
proving a controversial point, which
is not only petty but undeserving of
the name history.
The book itself is the usual liter
ary masterpiece which we have be
come accustomed to expect from
Ludwig. It contains all his usual
characteristics: excellent, readable
style; an emphasis on personalities
and psychoanalytical treatment of
them; constant reference to Goethe
(the book is filled with exquisite
quotations); unbounded praise and
admiration for heroic characters and
unabated scorn for those who incur
the author's dislike.
AXE TO GRIND
If Ludwig felt it necessary to
write his history of the Germans
with an axe to grind (though it is
hard to see how such a motive
could be other than a detracting
factor) there is contained in "The
Germans" the germ of a much more
interesting, more intelligent and cer
tainly more tenable thesis. It is to

be found in the following paragraph,
which follows the author's descrip
tion of how a bullet that, if it had
found its mark, would have prevent
ed the war of 18(57 and probably the
war of 1870 had been miraculously
stopped by one of Bismark's ribs:
"While the lib in Bismark's
chest snapped back into place . . .
Karl Marx . . . was writing that
history was purely a consequence
of economic factors."
Here, then, is a theme worthy of
the great Ludwig. It is unique in a
world saturated by thinking along
lines of economic determinism; it
may be supported by simple recita
tion of historical events; the enemy
is definite and easy to see and under
stand; and Ludwig above all through
his biographical treatment of history
has already done more than any
other man to advance the theory.
But to the exiled Ludwig the state
of mind of the anti-German peoples
—natural enough—combined with his
own resentment — also understand

world saturated by thinking along
lines of economic determinism; it
may be supported by simple recita
tion of historical events; the enemy
is definite and easy to see and under
stand; and Ludwig above all through
his biographical treatment of history
has already done more than any
other man to advance the theory.
But to the exiled Ludwig the state
of mind of the anti-German peoples
—natural enough—combined with his
own resentment — also understand
able —to drive him to one of the
worst of intellectual crimes—the per
version of history. It is a step which
all his many admirers of the pres

"THE GERMANS: DOUBLE HISTORY OF A NATION," by Emil Lud
wig. Little, Hidwii and Company. $1.
It is unfortunate tliat as erudite and intelligent a man and as important
a figure in contemporary literature as Emil Ludwig should pick his
greatest subject at a time when in all men's minds that subicct has become

a monster of unreasonable propor-'
lions and malevolence.
In fact, it would be safe to say
that no writer, unless he is excep
tionally independent of popular em
otions, should attempt to treat the
Germans historically or in any other
way at this time if he wishes his
work to be viewed by posterity as
intelligent, impartial and worth
while. For at a time when all civ
ilized peoples look on the German
nation with hatred in their hearts,
one cannot expect them to produce
literature in which that nation is
viewed with the calm, critical eye
which is so necessary to all good his
torical, political and biographical
writers.
VIOLENT ACTIONS
As the name of the book suggests,
Ludwig takes as his theme a theory
which many people have adopted to
explain the violent actions of the
German nation in the last century
and a half and at the same time to
pay tribute to the genius of German
individuals such as Goethe and
Beethoven. This paradox is possible
because of the "double" character of
the Germans, according to Ludwig,
which makes them individually
great and politically impotent. Goethe
summed up the idea when he wrote
"Germany is nothing, but every in
dividual is much, and yet the Ger
mans imagine the reverse to be
true."
Ludwig attempts to prove this
theme by telling the whole history
of the Germans since Ariovistus
flaunted Julius Caesar on the plains
of Gaul. Every event, every person
ality which appears in the story is
used by the author to illustrate his
thesis.
POINT PROOF
This is, of course, nothing less than
historical prostitution. It is the tell
ing of history for the purpose of
proving a controversial point, which
is not only petty but undeserving of
the name history.
The book itself is the usual liter
ary masterpiece which we have be
come accustomed to expect from
Ludwig. It contains all his usual
characteristics: excellent, readable
style; an emphasis on personalities
and psychoanalytical treatment of
them; constant reference to Goethe
(the book is filled with exquisite
quotations); unbounded praise and
admiration for heroic characters and
unabated scorn for those who incur
the author's dislike.
AXE TO GRIND
If Ludwig felt it necessary to
write his history of the Germans
with an axe to grind (though it is
hard to see how such a motive
could be other than a detracting
factor) there is contained in "The
Germans" the germ of a much more
interesting, more intelligent and cer
tainly more tenable thesis. It is to

be found in the following paragraph,
which follows the author's descrip
tion of how a bullet that, if it had
found its mark, would have prevent
ed the war of 18(57 and probably the
war of 1870 had been miraculously
stopped by one of Bismark's ribs:
"While the lib in Bismark's
chest snapped back into place . . .
Karl Marx . . . was writing that
history was purely a consequence
of economic factors."
Here, then, is a theme worthy of
the great Ludwig. It is unique in a
world saturated by thinking along
lines of economic determinism; it
may be supported by simple recita
tion of historical events; the enemy
is definite and easy to see and under
stand; and Ludwig above all through
his biographical treatment of history
has already done more than any
other man to advance the theory.
But to the exiled Ludwig the state
of mind of the anti-German peoples
