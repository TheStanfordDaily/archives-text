# Vocom Quota Club To Meet Monday
## 
### 
For senior women, who would like
the practical experience employers
require, Women's Vocational Guid
ance Committee is again sponsoring
the Quota Club which will meet in
the Nitery this Monday at 5 o'clock.
Under the Quota Club system, each
girl works one afternoon a week
without pay during the quarter for
Palo Alto employers. At this meet
ing, Jeane Chambers, chairman of
Women's Vocom, will give the re
ports from the employers and from
the girls who participated in the
Quota Club last quarter, and arrange
work for all those interested.
Several of the places open for this
quarter's work experiment are: the
Clothes Closet, Maxine Kellogg Stu
dio, Shirley Cobb Bookstore, Palo
Alto Hospital laboratory, and the
Elizabeth Alexander Gift Shop. Any
girl who would like to participate
and cannot attend Monday's meeting
should contact Jeane Chambers.
There is no capital punishment in
Sweden, but a life sentence for es
pionage was recently imposed.
