# Sadie Hawkins Dance Scheduled for Jan. 24
## 
### 
The Farm's annual Sadie Hawkins
Dance will rock the Pavilion to the
throbbing rhythm of the square
dance a week from tomorrow night,
Saturday, January 24, it was an
nounced yesterday. Bids, at 99 cents,
will go on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
Monday morning.
This affair is the only campus
dance to which Stanford women can
drag the men, and is patterned after
Sadie Hawkins Day, created by car
toonist A1 Cap of Li'l Abner fame.
This is the third time that Farm
women have had the opportunity to
OFFICIALLY ask the men to go to
a dance with them. The first Sadie
Hawkins Jig was sponsored two years
ago by the class of '43. It is now
under the sponsorship of Cardinals.
JUKE BOX JIG
This year Daisy Maes and their
Li'l Abners will jig to music from a
juke box so that there will be more
room for dancing. This move will
make room for 100 more people than
purchased bids for last year's affair.
"You girls had better line up your
men quickly," advised Pat Adams,
A.S.S.U. vice-president. "There will
be a shortage of both males and bids.
Remember, last year the 500 bids
were sold within three days."
Dress for the dance ,which will
last from 9:30 until 1 a.m., will be
rustic. Costumes should be as "rug

ged" as possible, with jeans and loud,
loud shirts for all Li'l Abners, and
short, ragged skirts recommended for
the domineering Daisy Maes.
Refreshments will be served, and
favors, corncob pipes, balloons, and
whistles will be distributed.
WISHING, WAITING
Last year, Farm men spent the
days before the dance sitting hope
fully next to a telephone, waiting,
wishing. They even went no far as
to offer the use of their cherished
cars if a woman, any woman, would
only ask them to go. But with the
army helping to drag the ratio down
toward the zero hour, this year's
crop of Daisy Macs will find that
Uncle Sam has a priority on Li'l
Abners.
When A1 Capp first planned the
continuity in which Sadie Hawkins'
old man decided that Sadie (age 35)
should be a-marrying, and went
wooing with his shotgun, he had
little idea of the enormous turmoil
he was to cause. But when the
women of the nation saw old Pop
Hawkins give all of Dogpatch's bach
elors a head start with the threat
that the one she caught would be
her bridegroom, they sensed a ter
rific idea.
Sadie Hawkins Day and Sadie
Hawkins dances swept the country
until last year the event was hon
ored at over 200 universities.
