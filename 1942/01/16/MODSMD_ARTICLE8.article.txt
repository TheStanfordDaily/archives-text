## Lamarr in 'Algiers' Highlights Program 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
Hedy Lamarr became a sensation
overnight when the Austrian film,
"Ecstasy," with Hedy Lamarr as
ecstasy, was released in Europe.
Even though the film was recorded
in German, it was an instant success
in the United States â€” wherever it
was not banned by censorship.
So Walter Wanger moved heaven
and earth to sign up the Viennese
actress. He provided an appro
priately exotic setting, teamed her
with Charles Boyer, and the result
was "Algiers'' and an unparalleled
American triumph for Hedy Lamarr.
"Algiers" is the movie selected by
Barbara Sadler to be shown first in
the bi-weekly scries, which begins
Sunday night at 7:15 in Memorial
Hall, admission 20 cents.
LAMARR ENHANCING
Aside from its historical signifi
cance in skyrocketing Hedy Lamarr
to something of a national institu
tion, "Algiers" is the most vivid and
authentic portrayal of the intriguing
oriental city from which it takes it,s
name ever to come out of Holly
wood.
Although Lamarr's acting has not
received the acclaim of her beauty
since her first picture, she is in "Al
giers" greatly enhancing to the
drama, which develops in the lan
guor and intrigue always associated
with the ancient seaport of the
French empire.
BOYER VS. LAMARR
Charles Boyer is a perfect cast as
the jewel thief, who is safe from the
French police as long as he remains
in the city. Then Hedy Lamarr vis
its Algiers, from Paris, and Boyer
goes after her. You will have to
the picture yourself to appreciate
the action and suspense that fol
lows from this point.
An animated cartoon and the first
chapter of the palpitating epic,
"Law of the Wild," will precede the
feature. The next attraction to play
in the campus series will be "Anna
Christie," with Greta Garbo.
