# Farm Dunce Instructor Bows Out
## 
### 
Everybody likes Miss Margaret
Jewell; besides being a beautiful
dancer, she has such pretty legs. But
now that she has become Mrs. James
Mullen, she is going to use those legs
to walk away from Stanford and
from her position as director of mod
ern dance.
The Orchesis concert next Tuesday
evening will culminate four emi
nently successful years on the Farm,
during which such well-known per
sonalities of the dance as Doris Hum
phries and Charles Weidman, Mar
ian Van Tuil, and Hanya Holm (Miss
Jewell's former teacher) came here
to dance and to give master lessons,
and Orchesis membership swelled
from three to fourteen people.
Miss Jewell can laugh now as she
recalls how frightened she was when
she first came here for the purpose
of starting a course for dance majors.
To make matters worse, five weeks
after she arrived she broke her an
kle, which laid her up for more
than a quarter.
But even with such a set-back as
a beginning, Miss Jewell has been
able to turn modern dance into a
popular and enjoyable activity on the
campus. At the concert Orchesis
gave on the Tuesday Scries two
years ago, the house was filled almost
to capacity. This year Orchesis ex
pects to do even better.
Next Tuesday evening the Series is
presenting what will be MLss Jewell's
swan song. "But," she says, "I'll
never stop dancing."
