# Height Tells Tale As Indians Thump Broncs
## 
### Bob Sontag 
Superior height told the Pavilion tale last night as Stanford's sky
scraper quintet thumped Santa Clara, 37-27. Tonight San Jose State
invades the local gym at 8.
For the first time this season the Indians put their "all out" squad
on the floor at once, and its 6-4 average found center Ed Voss high man

with 10 points, 8 of them tip-ins. l
Jimmy Pollard's defensive game
was enough to ask for, even though
the soph sensation's shooting eye
was a little dimmed.
Stanford led at halftime, 17-10.
Howie Dallmar, who hadn't con
nected for a point in the first half,
suddenly came to life and bounced
in 8 points at the start of the period.
Midway in the half the Redskins
swelled their total to 33-19.
Stan Patrick's Farm debut fizzled
out completely. He attempted many
of his pet trick push shots, but only
two were good all evening.
The Indians played a hard floor
game, as evidenced by Pollard, Dall
inar, Voss, and Bill Cowden playing
through the latter part of second
half with three fouls apiece. Voss
finally went out with four.
Tonight Coach Everett Dean will
probably start his second team of
Freddie Linari and Jack Dana, for
wards, John Eikelman, center, and
Tom Fuller and Leo McCafTffrey,
guards.
