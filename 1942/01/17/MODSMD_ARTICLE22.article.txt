# PAN-HELL HEAD COMMENTS

Row women chalked up a new
high in clean rushing as the current
season closed today, declared Bar
bara Rapp, Pan-Hellenic president,
late this afternoon.
There was not one smudge on
this year's records in the Pan-Hel
lenic office, and this announcement
came in sharp contrast to last year's
eleventh-hour charges and counter
charges of "illegal contact with
rushees," which precipitated penal
ties involving five out of the nine
sorority houses.
"Faults discovered in last year's
rushing system resulted in changes
which this year have made the new
system completely satisfactory so
far," beamed Miss Rapp this after
noon.
Last year Peg Stanfield, Pan-
Hell president, expressed her views
on the sorority situation at the close
of rushing, saying, "It's well known
that this year the sororities were
trying out a new system. Faults
in it were not noticable when
merely written down in black and
white and became obvious only
the plan was put into effect."
It was these faults in the pre
vious rushing plan which formed
the basis for the present system,
said Miss Rapp today, who added,
"It now seems to be as near as pos
sible to perfect, so far as we can
tell today."

The plan has been telescoped in
to a 10-day period, with refinements
in the bidding process and other
procedures which will be reviewed
editorially in The Daily early next
week.
