LOS ANGELES, Jan. 16—(UP)
—Accurate shooting and tricky hall
handling enabled the U.S.C. basket
ball team to trim the University of

California, 58-46, here tonight. Seem
ingly tossing shots at will, the Tro
jans outplayed a ragged Bear quin
tet for three-quarters of the time.
The California squad stepped out
in front during the first few min
utes of the half to lead, 9-8, but the
Trojans put on an amazing display
that made the halftime score read
33-19 in favor of U.S.C.
