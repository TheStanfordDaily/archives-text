# Santa Clara Yearlings Scalp Bengtson's Papeese, 36-26
## 
### Bill Hornby 
Using their superior altitude to monopolize backboard play in the
second half and capitalizing on a sudden "hot" spell of forward Dick
O'Keefe, the Santa Clara University freshman thoroughly scalped Phil
Bengtson's Card yearling hoopsters 36 to 26 last night in the Pavilion.
Tonight the Papeese seek revenge against the San Jose frosh quint,

the game called at 6:15. Probablei
elude Parsons, Brown, Barsoelhini,
starting line-up for Stanford will in
clude Parsons, Brown, Barsocchni,
Hall, and either Heald or Hartwell.
Last night's game was close and
Stanford was still very much in
tilings as the second half opened
with the Farm squad trailing by a
single point, 11-10. Lundy and Lar
abel laid the stage with a bucket
each that had Stanford tottering.
Then O'Kcefe flashed his lanky
form through a bewildered Papeese
defense for three straight goals to
deliver the K. O. for the invaders.
Later O'Kcefe netted three more
goals, cinching high scoring honors
with 14 points in a tilt which was
the second start and first loss for
the Stanfordites.
Dave Brown, who led Stanford's

scorers with 10 points, was magni
ficent in his direction of the last
minute fight to bring the Cards
hack into the fray. His guarding
anil floor play were the standout
features of the evening, and his four
buckets in the second half kept a
flicker of Encina hope alive, aided
by two sharp goals by Bob Bar
socchini in the closing minutes.
The loss of tall Jack Heald at cen
ter in the first half was felt dis
tinctly by the Cards, then still more
unable to handle the height of the
opposition. Extent of Heald's knee
injury is as yet unknown.
