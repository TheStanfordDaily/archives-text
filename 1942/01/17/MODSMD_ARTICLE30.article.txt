# Attractive Farm Facilities Offered By Women's Halls
## 
### Rosemarie Mullany 
The woman who elects or accepts
residence in a Stanford hall finds
available to her a large and attrac
tive variety of types from which to
choose shelter for the remainder
of her college days.
The variety cuts a wide swath—
from the modern ideal of Lagunita
Court to the older cloisters of small,
scattered houses.
in approximate order of size and
exclusive of Roble, the women's
halls on the campus are Elm, Haw
thorne, Oaks, Mariposa, Manzanita,
Madrono, Union and Lagunita.
ELM is one of the two "baby"
hall residences on campus and ac
commodates twelve women. It is
located at 520 Salvatierra Street,
and, like most of the smaller houses,
is in the Union unit. Meals are
taken in the Union dining hall.
HAWTHORNE has the same
capacity as Elm and is also on Sal
vatierra.
THE OAKS can accommodate
fifteen women. It is on Santa
Teresa, near the Tost Office. It
was formerly the home of the Al
mon E. Roths and only recently
joined the hall family.
MANZANITA squats neatly on
Lasuen and has a capacity of fifteen.
It was formerly known as the
"French House".
MARIPOSA, with room for
twenty-two, is farther down on Sal
vatierra and has the general appear
ance of an old-fashioned private
home. Residents find the trek over
to a Union breakfast forbidding
but are otherwise enthusiastic about
their temporary home.
MADRONO accomodates thirty
two women. The house is just op
posite the Union on Salvatierra and,
in spite of the building's decrepit
appearance, maintains a steady pop
ularity.
UNION is the central residence
of the Union group. Its residents
like being able to weave to an eight
o'clock without waking up. It ac
commodates sixty-seven.
LAGUNITA COURT—heralded
at its opening in 1935 as the world's
most modern college dormitory, is
the one spot on campus which
conies closest to confirming the
"countryclub" myth about Stanford.
Built around a picturesque court, it
at once attains, through the casa
system, all the benefits of both
large and small living groups. It
affords the hall woman an oppor
tunity to know a great number of
her fellows, at the same time pro
viding for fairly intimate friend
ships within the casa. One of the
casas, Ventura, is a separate build
ing, about two blocks away as the
crow flies. Ventura girls cat their
meals at Lagunita.
Although the records show that

once a girl lias chosen a hall resi
dence she seldom changes, a change
can be made. There are many wo

men who have afforded themselves
the experience of living in botl
large and small groups.

ELM is one of the two "baby"
hall residences on campus and ac
commodates twelve women. It is
located at 520 Salvatierra Street,
and, like most of the smaller houses,
is in the Union unit. Meals are
taken in the Union dining hall.
HAWTHORNE has the same
capacity as Elm and is also on Sal
vatierra.
THE OAKS can accommodate
fifteen women. It is on Santa
Teresa, near the Tost Office. It
was formerly the home of the Al
mon E. Roths and only recently
joined the hall family.
MANZANITA squats neatly on
Lasuen and has a capacity of fifteen.
It was formerly known as the
"French House".
MARIPOSA, with room for
twenty-two, is farther down on Sal
vatierra and has the general appear
ance of an old-fashioned private
home. Residents find the trek over
to a Union breakfast forbidding
but are otherwise enthusiastic about
their temporary home.
MADRONO accomodates thirty
two women. The house is just op
posite the Union on Salvatierra and,
in spite of the building's decrepit
appearance, maintains a steady pop
ularity.
UNION is the central residence
of the Union group. Its residents
like being able to weave to an eight
o'clock without waking up. It ac
commodates sixty-seven.
LAGUNITA COURT—heralded
at its opening in 1935 as the world's
most modern college dormitory, is
the one spot on campus which
conies closest to confirming the
"countryclub" myth about Stanford.
Built around a picturesque court, it
at once attains, through the casa
system, all the benefits of both
large and small living groups. It
affords the hall woman an oppor
tunity to know a great number of
her fellows, at the same time pro
viding for fairly intimate friend
ships within the casa. One of the
casas, Ventura, is a separate build
ing, about two blocks away as the
crow flies. Ventura girls cat their
meals at Lagunita.
Although the records show that

once a girl lias chosen a hall resi
dence she seldom changes, a change
can be made. There are many wo

men who have afforded themselves
the experience of living in botl
large and small groups.
The woman who elects or accepts
residence in a Stanford hall finds
available to her a large and attrac
tive variety of types from which to
choose shelter for the remainder
of her college days.
The variety cuts a wide swath—
from the modern ideal of Lagunita
Court to the older cloisters of small,
scattered houses.
in approximate order of size and
exclusive of Roble, the women's
halls on the campus are Elm, Haw
thorne, Oaks, Mariposa, Manzanita,
Madrono, Union and Lagunita.
