# War Puts Rushing In Proper Place, Claims Roble Head
## 
### Bill Steif 
The girl was blonde and slender
and had a nose that tilted up just a
little. You would have almost call
ed her unassuming if you hadn't
paused a second to look at her eyes
again. Those eyes, blue, told you
what to do. As the president of
Roble, she talks about the Robic
reaction to sorority rushing.
She says that she thinks "the War
has had an excellent effect upon
rushing ... it has put it into its
proper place, de-emphasized :t."
She talks about the saneness with
which Roble girls have approached
the whole sorority problem this
year and says that rushing has not
disturbed Roble routine excessive
ly, that the frosh women have been
taking the whole thing in stride and
that studying has continued much
as it should.
NEW SYSTEM
And this blonde with the deter
mined eyes goes on to say that per
haps one of the reasons for the
lessening of excitement about rush
ing at Roble is the fact that dark
eyed Barbara Rapp, President of
Pan-Hellenic Council, inaugurated
a new system of giving out bids this
year by which those girls getting
bids pick them up at the Pan-Hel
lenic Office and do not open them
up until they are securely alone, a
system which, in the Roble Presi
dent's opinion, is a great improve
ment upon the old method of giving
the 'bids out to the frosh in the
Roble lobby.
But the main point is that some
how the Stanford Robleites have
grown up, "Have become more re
sponsible, more mature," to use
their president's words, "than ever
before." And this makes Sylvia
Berry very happy.
FROSH TALKS
Then there was a girl that was
dark and had deep eyes, a long,
handsome face, and wore a bandana.
She was a frosh. She was a little
bit worried about this rushing. Yes,
she was going up to the house she
liked, things semed to be running
well, but . . . well, you know, every
body worries a little. She said she
did not think that the girls "had
had enough chance to mix about
and to meet the girls in all the
houses . . . that rushing ought to be
more informal . . . and that those
girls who had received disappoint
ments during rushing were taking
it like troopers." The red initials
on her white blouse collar jiggled
a little as she said that studying had
been pretty hard to do during rush
ing and that "there have been lots
of bull sessions after each rush per
iod."
ANOTHER BLONDE
And there were lots more that
had something to say. There was
a girl from the mid-west with burn
ished golden blonde hair that was
doing all right for herself but still
thought it was unfair. It hurt her
because it hurt her friends. There
were girls who had had a tough
time and girls who had oozed right
into whatever they wanted. Some—
those who did not have much to

vorry about —enjoyed it in an ex
ited way and some . . . didn't feci
oo gay about it.
While over on the other side of
tie fence the sororities got dressed
tp too. They worried: "Will we
j_et this nugget? will we get that
itiggct?" And you would meet the
sstcrs on the street and shyly in
(|iire about this or that individual
aid the young women would reply,
jist a little superciliously, "Yes,
sie's been up."
And Sylvia Berry said that "the
Var has put rushing . . . into its
poper place."
