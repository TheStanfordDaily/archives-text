# Sororities Pledge 125
## A.O. Pi Leads with Class of 19 Followed by Kappa, Tri-Delt 
### 
With a pledge class of nineteen women, Alpha Omicron Pi leads
the Row in the biggest all-sorority sweep since 1934. A total of 125
Farm women tonight took the formal pledge vows climaxing the new
ten-day rushing season.
The Kappas were strong seconds with a class of seventeen and the

â–º Tri-Delts and Alpha Phis followed
closcly behind in that order.
The complete list of pledges for
each house is published on page
two of this issue, and will be re
peated with any changes or addi
tions in Monday morning's Daily.
The A.O. Pi take of nineteen is
the largest individual class since
1935 when the Gamma Phis took in
the same number. Only once in
the last ten years, the banner year
of 1934 when a total of 138 women
came into the Greek letter fold, has
this individual house record been
broken. That year the Alpha Phis
got a class of twenty-four members.
With rushing operating on a new
and revised schedule, drawn up as
a result of last year's illegal rushing
charges involving five houses, for
mal pledging comes as a grand
finale to ten solid days of rushing
dinners, house meetings and worry.
Neophyte sorority women were
given their bids at Roble between
7 and 7:30 o'clock this evening and
then were escorted up to the house
of their choice by alumni members
of Cap and Gown, honorary society
for senior women,
On reaching their houses, pledges
took the formal vows and then went
on dress parade for the annual
pledge-night open houses.
Stealing the 1942 record was
something in the way of an anni
versary for Alpha Omicron Pi. This
is the first time for them in ten
years.
During the intervening years the
annual record has ben copped twice
each by Kappa, Gamma Phi, Dee
gee, and Alpha Phi. once each by
Tri-Delt and Chi O.
The average annual pledge class
for the past ten years is 100.
