### AMIE REICHERT 
'pHIS week the British have an ap
pointment at el-Agheila. Gen
eral Ervvin Rommel will be there
with what is left of his Africa Corps,
and with whatever units of the Luft
waffe are sent. Also some Italians.
The British will not fail that
rendezvous, and a great, perhaps
decisive battle will be fought
there. If Itomincl is defeated once
more, it may be the final, shat
tering blow that will knock the
Axis out of North Africa once and
for all.
But to do this will not be easy, for
Adolf Hitler is determined to re
tain a foothold in North Africa at all
costs.

I AST week Rommel snatched a
Dunkirk victory from what
seemed imminent and unmitigated
defeat: he got away. At Agedabia
the shrewd Nazi tactician had waited
tense and dangerous days for rein
forcements which never came.
Finally, under cover of an
obliging sandstorm, he pulled out
and with his decimated troops re
treated 100 miles safely to cl-
Agheila near the Tripolitania
border. There Rommel is closer
to his base and to his reinforce
ments, but, with the British cap
ture of Halfaya Pass, it is becom
ing increasingly difficult, if not
impossible, for the Axis to keep
any sort of communication line
clear.
The capture of that now-famous
pass yielded the British some 6,000
war prisoners and large war stores.
But more impox-tant, it will release
thousands of Imperial troops which
are needed in western Cyrenaica.
The prolonged battle for Ilalfaya
had forced the British to detour
far to the south, and thus had
greatly lengthened supply lines to
Imperial troops which are engag
ing the main Axis force far to the
west.
Now that that is out of the way,
the British can concentrate all their
strength and efforts on exterminating
what is left of the Nazis at el-
Agheila.
The Germans are going to be
concentrating quite a bit of
strength and effort there too—if
they can get through. Dispatches
from Turkey last night told of
large Nazi forces, especially units
of the Luftwaffe gathering in
southern Italy and in Sicily for a
jump to Tripolitania. The report
indicated that German planes fly
ing from Greece by way of south
ern Italy were already challenging
British air superiority in North
Africa.
Developments in this theater of
war will bear watching this week.
There will be plenty of fireworks.

/ iNE of Der Fuehrer's pet mottos
seems to be, Let's Work in
Groups (with apologies to Isabelle
Fawcett). Strains of
Worms do it
Sperms do it
All the better class of germs do it
Let's do it
Let's work in groups . . .
lloated from Berlin yesterday as
Germany, Italy, and Japan signed
another agreement. This time it's
for "common operations against
common enemies." Really, one
would think the Axis partners
weren't sure of their devotion and
therefore find it necessary to reiter
ate their undying love and friend
ship for one another every six
months.
The truth of the matter probably
is that the psychological value—for
themselves and their people—is the
important factor. Every time things
aren't going so well for Der Fuehrer
he gets the urge to sign things. This
shoves another paper mache prop un
der the quivering home populace and
stiffens the dictatox-s' collective
upper-lip.
So they whistle in the dark, and
the tunc is
Worms do it
Sperms do it... etc.
