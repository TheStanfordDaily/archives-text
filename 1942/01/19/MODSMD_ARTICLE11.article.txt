### BILL COUGHLIN 
Line forms to the right this
morning at the A.S.S.U. office as
Daisy Macs lay their 99 shiny cop
pers on the counter for their bids to
the Sadie Hawkins Dance, slated for
next Saturday night in the Pavilion.
Any male attempting to purchase a
hid will be bounced unceremoniously
down the steps.
Bx-eakdown of the price reveals
that 87 of the 99 pennies are re
quired to get a woxrxan into the
Pavilion between the houx*s of 9:30
and 1 a.m. next Saturday, 9 of the
coppei's go to Uncle Samuel for tax,
and that 3 cents, a mere tres pesos,
is the price set upon the head of the
almighty Stanford male.

"You gixls had better get your
bids as soon as possible," urged
Dodie Dolan, dance chairman. "Re
member, last year the demand far
exceeded the supply. This dance is
your chance to x-epay the fellows
for the money they've spent on you.
Get a man befox-e the Army beats
you to it."
Anything goes and sky's the limit
on costumes for the jig. Circulation
on A1 Capp's comic strip, Li'l Abner,
in which the Sadie Hawkins idea
originated, has risen as the campus
begins an avid pex-usal of the con
tinuity to find out how to dx-ess Sat
urday night. Jeans and loud shirts
are recommended for the men for
tunate enough to attend, while
short, x'agged skirts and blonde
tresses are suggested for the Daisy
Maes.
JUKEBOX
Music for the affair /ill be pro
vided by a jukebox. In this man
ner, it will be possible to accom
modate more people in the Pavilion.
Last year the 500 bids sold out in
thi'ee days, and an extra 100 put on
sale were snatched up immediately.
An informal Daily poll taken late
last night disclosed that resentment
is growing deep in the sturdy chest
of the Stanfox-d male. Fann men,
irked at the 3-cent value placed
upon them, are growing stubborn.
"Fooey," said one bronzed Adonis,
"we don't have to go to this Hawkins
bi'awl. Mills girls consider us
worth more than 3 cents. We'll go
out with them Satui'day night."
"Gee," said another, "you'd think
we were a worthless commodity
flooding the market. Man, there's a
priority on us."
"We'll strike," wax-ned the ma
jority. "What do you think this is, a
one-cent sale?"

thi'ee days, and an extra 100 put on
sale were snatched up immediately.
An informal Daily poll taken late
last night disclosed that resentment
is growing deep in the sturdy chest
of the Stanfox-d male. Fann men,
irked at the 3-cent value placed
upon them, are growing stubborn.
"Fooey," said one bronzed Adonis,
"we don't have to go to this Hawkins
bi'awl. Mills girls consider us
worth more than 3 cents. We'll go
out with them Satui'day night."
"Gee," said another, "you'd think
we were a worthless commodity
flooding the market. Man, there's a
priority on us."
"We'll strike," wax-ned the ma
jority. "What do you think this is, a
one-cent sale?"
Line forms to the right this
morning at the A.S.S.U. office as
Daisy Macs lay their 99 shiny cop
pers on the counter for their bids to
the Sadie Hawkins Dance, slated for
next Saturday night in the Pavilion.
Any male attempting to purchase a
hid will be bounced unceremoniously
down the steps.
Bx-eakdown of the price reveals
that 87 of the 99 pennies are re
quired to get a woxrxan into the
Pavilion between the houx*s of 9:30
and 1 a.m. next Saturday, 9 of the
coppei's go to Uncle Samuel for tax,
and that 3 cents, a mere tres pesos,
is the price set upon the head of the
almighty Stanford male.
GET BIDS
"You gixls had better get your
bids as soon as possible," urged
Dodie Dolan, dance chairman. "Re
member, last year the demand far
exceeded the supply. This dance is
your chance to x-epay the fellows
for the money they've spent on you.
Get a man befox-e the Army beats
you to it."
Anything goes and sky's the limit
on costumes for the jig. Circulation
on A1 Capp's comic strip, Li'l Abner,
in which the Sadie Hawkins idea
originated, has risen as the campus
begins an avid pex-usal of the con
tinuity to find out how to dx-ess Sat
urday night. Jeans and loud shirts
are recommended for the men for
tunate enough to attend, while
short, x'agged skirts and blonde
tresses are suggested for the Daisy
Maes.
JUKEBOX
Music for the affair /ill be pro
vided by a jukebox. In this man
ner, it will be possible to accom
modate more people in the Pavilion.
Last year the 500 bids sold out in
thi'ee days, and an extra 100 put on
