# Toyon Formal Set For February 20
## 
### 
The Toyon cabinet, meeting under
the gavel of Bob Hinzie, president,
last week designated February 20 as
the date of the annual Toyon formal.

Jim Atkinson, appointed chairman
of the dance committee, explained
that the lobby will be blacked out,

so that in case of air raid the dance
will continue without interruption.
The dance is for members of Toyon
Club and their guests.
