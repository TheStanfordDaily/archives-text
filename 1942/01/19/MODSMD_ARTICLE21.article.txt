# SINGAPORE FIGHTS NEW BOMBINGS
## 
### 
SINGAPORE, Jan. 18 (UP). â€”
Waves of Japanese planes attacked
the Singapore naval base today, kin
dling fires that burned for hours,
while British imperial planes rained
devastating blows on Japanese boats,
railway cars, troop concentrations
and transport columns groping
through the jungle country some
100 miles north of here.
