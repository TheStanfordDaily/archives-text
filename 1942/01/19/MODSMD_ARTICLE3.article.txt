# Haugh Says Rush Events Break Rules
## Rushees Invited To Off-Campus Parties Yesterday and Today 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
With men's rushing just beginning
its final and hectic stages, rumors of
rushing parties and possible viola
tions of rushing rules ran wild
through Encina yesterday, causing a
great deal of disturbance among
freshman men, according to Jim
Ilaugh, Interfraternity president.
Many rushees had been ixivited to
rushing parties which were to take
place off-campus yesterday and to
day. These are not x-egularly sched
uled rushing periods and conse
quently are illegal. Among these
parties was an off-campus party
among pledges and rushees without
fratex-nity members pxesent, Haugh
said.
NEW RUSHING
Since the Interfraternity Board
has not passed on such pax-ties, there
is as yet no precedent set for such
affaix-s.
Howevei', Haugh stated yesterday,
"There is very little doubt in my
mind that if such a case were
brought befoi'e the Board it would
be found to be a violation of off
campus rushixig. Even if there were
no fraternity mexx present, they
would be footing the bill and it
would be off-campus rushing—a di
rect violation of xoxshing rules."
PROBABLE PENALTY
The pi*obable penalty, he added, if
a house were caught in such an act,
would be withdi'awal of rushing and
pledging privileges this year for the
house involved. Rushees px-esent at
such a party would pi'obably lose
their pledging privileges.
The pui'pose of rushing rules, ac
cording to the Row head, is to put
all houses on an equal footing. Any
rushing parties violate this rule of
equality. Violations thus far prob
ably have resulted from lack of
precedent in such a situation. This
is explainable and perhaps under
standable, Haugh continued.
"Let the precedent be set that
there shall be no off-campus x-ushing
nor off-campus pax*ties whether fra
ternity members pai-ticipate or not.
Let's clean up this situation and
place the houses on an equal footing
for the x-emainder of the period,"
Haugh concluded.

"Let the precedent be set that
there shall be no off-campus x-ushing
nor off-campus pax*ties whether fra
ternity members pai-ticipate or not.
Let's clean up this situation and
place the houses on an equal footing
for the x-emainder of the period,"
Haugh concluded.
With men's rushing just beginning
its final and hectic stages, rumors of
rushing parties and possible viola
tions of rushing rules ran wild
through Encina yesterday, causing a
great deal of disturbance among
freshman men, according to Jim
Ilaugh, Interfraternity president.
Many rushees had been ixivited to
rushing parties which were to take
place off-campus yesterday and to
day. These are not x-egularly sched
uled rushing periods and conse
quently are illegal. Among these
parties was an off-campus party
among pledges and rushees without
fratex-nity members pxesent, Haugh
said.
NEW RUSHING
Since the Interfraternity Board
has not passed on such pax-ties, there
is as yet no precedent set for such
affaix-s.
Howevei', Haugh stated yesterday,
"There is very little doubt in my
mind that if such a case were
brought befoi'e the Board it would
be found to be a violation of off
campus rushixig. Even if there were
no fraternity mexx present, they
would be footing the bill and it
would be off-campus rushing—a di
rect violation of xoxshing rules."
PROBABLE PENALTY
The pi*obable penalty, he added, if
a house were caught in such an act,
would be withdi'awal of rushing and
pledging privileges this year for the
house involved. Rushees px-esent at
such a party would pi'obably lose
their pledging privileges.
The pui'pose of rushing rules, ac
cording to the Row head, is to put
all houses on an equal footing. Any
rushing parties violate this rule of
equality. Violations thus far prob
ably have resulted from lack of
precedent in such a situation. This
is explainable and perhaps under
standable, Haugh continued.
