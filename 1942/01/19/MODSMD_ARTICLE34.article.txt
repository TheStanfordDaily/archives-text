# Dr. Wilbur Says Production Vital
## 
### 
Presenting a grave view of the
present situation in America, Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur last Fri
day night told alumni of the School
of Education that everything must
be sacrificed to the vast need of
production â€” and that includes the
production of trained brains.
Speaking at a dinner meeting of
the two-day conference conducted
by the School of Education, Dr. Wil
bur declared that the United States
is in a worse hole than many people
think. America took such a severe
blow on Dec. 7 that it will take a
mighty effort to overcome the effects,
he said.
Saturday morning a panel on how
the Stanford School of Education can
best serve the teaching profession
was conducted under the chairman
ship of Professor Alvin C. Eurich.
The need for more actual contact by
education students with practice in
teaching through internship in public
schools was stressed.

"Don't use the telephone for se
crets."
