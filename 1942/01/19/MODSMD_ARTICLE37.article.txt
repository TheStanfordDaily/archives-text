### 
Of more immediate importance to Redskin cage followers than Stan
ford's doulde week-end v ictories over Santa Clara and San Jose State was
California's squaring its first series with H.S.C. at Los Angeles.
Routed Friday. 58-40. the Bears bounced hack Saturday after trailing
in the first half to even the count, 41-3<>. Merv I.afaille bombed the bucket

for a high score of 12 points, while
Bob Ormsby of the Trojans and Roy
Tamm of Cal each tallied 11.
Stanford and California open the
northern half of the P.C.C. next
Friday in the Pavilion.

U.S.F. tomorrow night in the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium to help

lIRONCOS BOW, 37-27
A little rehash of the week-end
wins:
Friday the Indians whipped Santa
Clara, 37-27, stymied Stan Patrick,
and squared accounts for its early
season loss to the Broncs. Except
for a 5-5 tie the Indians were in
front all the way and led at half
time, 17-10.
Howie Dallmar sent the Redskins
booming when the second half
opened with three quick field goals,
Ed Voss and Jimmy Pollard made
good on tip-ins, and Stanford's lead
jumped to 20-14. Patrick and Sum
Alaimo scored for Santa Clara.
On its skyrocket break the Broncs
crept to within 10 points of the
leaders but could get no closer.
POLLARD DEFENSE STAR
Pollard's defensive play made up
for his mediocre shooting game. He
was all over the backboard, broke
up several Bronc plays, intercepted
passes, and once knocked down
Patrick's field goal try without
touching him.
Voss, in his initial apeparancc
after a week's cold, tipped in S
points and tallied once from the
slot for 10 points. Dallmar was
second with S, and Don Burness
had 7. Pollard and Bill Cowden,
also a defensive sparkler, each
scored 5, and Jack Dana 2.
As for Saturday's 57-38 scalping,
San Jose can lick Stanford's second
string, but when the regulars go on
the floor it's murder in midcourt.
REGULARS ON BENCH
Mentor Dean started Dana, Fred
Oliver, John Eikelman, Tom Fuller,
and Leo McCaffrey against the
Spartans, who proceeded to snag a
15-9 lead midway in the first half.
Pollard and Voss came in at that
point and Cowden a moment later.
They fed Oliver, and behind Voss'
screening "Ollie" rang up three
baskets.
Voss tipped one in, followed with
another from the circle, then Dana
from the side. Meanwhile Don
Iloysen, who was high man of the
evening with 13, scored three
times, and the half ended with
the Spartans ahead, 25-21.
Voss, Dallmar, Pollard, Cowden,
and Linari took over in the second
half and caught the fading San
Joseans at 28-27, Linari scoring with
a push shot from 12 feet out. The
Spartans tied it up at 28-28 and
30-30, but from then on the Indians
rolled home in front easily.
TEN FOR JIMMY
Pollard looked as if he were back
in a frosh game. After missing shots
through the first period he sank five
field goals in the last half. Voss
made three more, and substitutions
were thick as flies.
Little Freddie Linari played the
entire second half. He spanked
the club along and ran around,
under, and over the top of his tall
opponents.
Shortest man on the squad at 5-9,
Linari still is the fightingest floor
man we've ever seen. Despite his
disadvantage in height he scored two
field goals and a free throw.

TEN FOR JIMMY
Pollard looked as if he were back
in a frosh game. After missing shots
through the first period he sank five
field goals in the last half. Voss
made three more, and substitutions
were thick as flies.
Little Freddie Linari played the
entire second half. He spanked
the club along and ran around,
under, and over the top of his tall
opponents.
Shortest man on the squad at 5-9,
Linari still is the fightingest floor
man we've ever seen. Despite his
disadvantage in height he scored two
field goals and a free throw.
Of more immediate importance to Redskin cage followers than Stan
ford's doulde week-end v ictories over Santa Clara and San Jose State was
California's squaring its first series with H.S.C. at Los Angeles.
Routed Friday. 58-40. the Bears bounced hack Saturday after trailing
in the first half to even the count, 41-3<>. Merv I.afaille bombed the bucket

for a high score of 12 points, while
Bob Ormsby of the Trojans and Roy
Tamm of Cal each tallied 11.
Stanford and California open the

lIRONCOS BOW, 37-27
A little rehash of the week-end
wins:
Friday the Indians whipped Santa
Clara, 37-27, stymied Stan Patrick,
and squared accounts for its early
season loss to the Broncs. Except
for a 5-5 tie the Indians were in
front all the way and led at half
time, 17-10.
Howie Dallmar sent the Redskins
booming when the second half
opened with three quick field goals,
Ed Voss and Jimmy Pollard made
good on tip-ins, and Stanford's lead
jumped to 20-14. Patrick and Sum
Alaimo scored for Santa Clara.
On its skyrocket break the Broncs
crept to within 10 points of the
leaders but could get no closer.
POLLARD DEFENSE STAR
Pollard's defensive play made up
for his mediocre shooting game. He
was all over the backboard, broke
up several Bronc plays, intercepted
passes, and once knocked down
Patrick's field goal try without
touching him.
Voss, in his initial apeparancc
after a week's cold, tipped in S
points and tallied once from the
slot for 10 points. Dallmar was
second with S, and Don Burness
had 7. Pollard and Bill Cowden,
also a defensive sparkler, each
scored 5, and Jack Dana 2.
As for Saturday's 57-38 scalping,
San Jose can lick Stanford's second
string, but when the regulars go on
the floor it's murder in midcourt.

evening with 13, scored three
times, and the half ended with
the Spartans ahead, 25-21.
Voss, Dallmar, Pollard, Cowden,
and Linari took over in the second
half and caught the fading San
Joseans at 28-27, Linari scoring with
a push shot from 12 feet out. The
Spartans tied it up at 28-28 and
30-30, but from then on the Indians
rolled home in front easily.
TEN FOR JIMMY
Pollard looked as if he were back
in a frosh game. After missing shots
through the first period he sank five
field goals in the last half. Voss
made three more, and substitutions
were thick as flies.
Little Freddie Linari played the
entire second half. He spanked
the club along and ran around,
under, and over the top of his tall
opponents.
Shortest man on the squad at 5-9,
Linari still is the fightingest floor
man we've ever seen. Despite his
disadvantage in height he scored two
field goals and a free throw.
Of more immediate importance to Redskin cage followers than Stan
ford's doulde week-end v ictories over Santa Clara and San Jose State was
California's squaring its first series with H.S.C. at Los Angeles.
Routed Friday. 58-40. the Bears bounced hack Saturday after trailing
in the first half to even the count, 41-3<>. Merv I.afaille bombed the bucket

for a high score of 12 points, while
Bob Ormsby of the Trojans and Roy
Tamm of Cal each tallied 11.
Stanford and California open the
northern half of the P.C.C. next
Friday in the Pavilion.
Coach Everett Dean sends his '41
southern division champs against
U.S.F. tomorrow night in the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium to help
the "Buy a Bomber" fund of one of
the Bay area newspapers.
lIRONCOS BOW, 37-27
A little rehash of the week-end
wins:
Friday the Indians whipped Santa
Clara, 37-27, stymied Stan Patrick,
and squared accounts for its early
season loss to the Broncs. Except
for a 5-5 tie the Indians were in
front all the way and led at half
time, 17-10.
Howie Dallmar sent the Redskins
booming when the second half
opened with three quick field goals,
Ed Voss and Jimmy Pollard made
good on tip-ins, and Stanford's lead
jumped to 20-14. Patrick and Sum
Alaimo scored for Santa Clara.
On its skyrocket break the Broncs
crept to within 10 points of the
leaders but could get no closer.
POLLARD DEFENSE STAR
Pollard's defensive play made up
for his mediocre shooting game. He
was all over the backboard, broke
up several Bronc plays, intercepted
passes, and once knocked down
Patrick's field goal try without
touching him.
Voss, in his initial apeparancc
after a week's cold, tipped in S
points and tallied once from the
slot for 10 points. Dallmar was
second with S, and Don Burness
had 7. Pollard and Bill Cowden,
also a defensive sparkler, each
scored 5, and Jack Dana 2.
As for Saturday's 57-38 scalping,
San Jose can lick Stanford's second
string, but when the regulars go on
the floor it's murder in midcourt.
REGULARS ON BENCH
Mentor Dean started Dana, Fred
Oliver, John Eikelman, Tom Fuller,
and Leo McCaffrey against the
Spartans, who proceeded to snag a
15-9 lead midway in the first half.
Pollard and Voss came in at that
point and Cowden a moment later.
They fed Oliver, and behind Voss'
screening "Ollie" rang up three
baskets.
Voss tipped one in, followed with
another from the circle, then Dana
from the side. Meanwhile Don
Iloysen, who was high man of the
evening with 13, scored three
times, and the half ended with
the Spartans ahead, 25-21.
Voss, Dallmar, Pollard, Cowden,
and Linari took over in the second
