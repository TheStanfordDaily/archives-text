### 
America, having passed through
the period of terror, is now united
and ready to respond to the threat
from abroad. This is the message to
be presented in dance form at the
Orchesis concert on the Tuesday
Evening Series, January 20, at 7:30
in Memorial Hall.

The visionary spirit of the pioneer,
the irrepressible gaiety of the Negro,
the discipline of the Puritan, and
the bravely of the refugee, all com
bine to create a united and coura
geous America in the face of the
present crisis. These ideas are ex
pressed in the "American Scene,"
which makes up the greater part of
the program. Added to this is a satire
on the city, including a burlesque
queen, a strip-tease artist, a glamour
girl ,and other representative types,
which promise to be amusing and
highly entertaining.
According to Margaret Jewell, di
rector of tiie modern dance group,
this program will be the best that
Orchesis has yet presented. Some
thing new is being attempted in the
narration, written and interpreted by-
Jean Nowell, that will accompany
the dances in order that the audience
may always understand the ideas
that the dancers are representing.
Settings for the concert have been
designed by Charels Vance, and
costumes and choreography by Or
chesis members. As this event is a
presentation by the Committee of
Public Events on the Tuesday Eve
ning Series, there will be no admis
sion charge.
