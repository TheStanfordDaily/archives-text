its second win, 40 to 30, Saturday
night.
The first-string set-up, minus Jack
Heald out with a knee injury, dump

tinge, and then the reserves took
over and some smooth play by
guard Freddy Ferriagaro brought the
outcome into the realm of certainty.

erally acceptable with some espe
cially special dribbling maneuvers

tipped in two goals and pushed an
other for six points in the closing
minutes, center replacement Hart
well who hooked two counters, and
