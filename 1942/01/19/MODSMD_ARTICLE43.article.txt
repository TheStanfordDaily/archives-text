### H. D. THOREAU Assistant Sports Editor 
r | I ED SCHROEDER now rates, in my humble opinion, as the number one
amateur tennis player in the country. At the end of the year 1941 Ted
was ranked No. 5 nationally by the mossbacks of the U.S.L.T.A. Speaking
in the vernacular, that means that they though four guys were better
than he. This is where 1 disagree with them, although it is not by far
the only time 1 take exception to them.
I'll admit that Bobby Riggs and Frank Kovacs should be placed above
our boy Schroeder, but they are now in the ranks of the "filthy pros" so
we can cast them from mind. The other two men in front of Ted are
Frankie Parker and Don McNeil. Parker won the U.S. Clay Courts title
last summer and from then on he didn't win anything or come close to it.
When he got on grass his forehand broke down as usual.
It seems a little incongruous to me for the U.S.L.T.A. to put Parker so
high when he did so poorly on grass, since the "L" in U.S.L.TA. doesn't
stand for victory or a type of formation but it does stand for lawn, which
is just a two-bit word for grass.
McNeil evidently got his ranking on the basis of his play the year be
fore when he won the National Championship. The big-wigs not only
overlooked the fact that Schroeder beat McNeil both times they played in
the late summer, but they also waived their usual practice of rating the
players mainly on their showing in the Nationals, where Schroeder fought
Riggs to five sets in the semifinals.
Of course this is just one man's opinion.

|T SPEAKS very well for the Farm cage team which they can win from
a team of Santa Clara's caliber, a team which has already beaten them,
on a night when only one of their men was "hot" and for less than half
the game. It wasn't a lucky win either. The margin of victory was a
solid ten points.
Howie Dallmar tanked a few long ones at the beginning of the second
half Friday night, but aside from that the boys weren't finding the basket
on their long ones. The credit for their victory goes to their tight defense
and to the fact that they finally took advantage of their height on re
bounds and tip-ins.
Desipte his terrific floor-play many of the wise-boys were starting to
get worried about Jim Pollard's relatively poor shooting this year until
the post-intermission period against the Spartans Saturday evening when he
scored six baskets in rapid succession.
After U.S.C. trips the Golden Bear handily Friday night the latter re
turns the next evening to turn the table around completely. Maybe they're
fixin' the games to up attendance. I'm just kidding, Mr. Masters.

Desipte his terrific floor-play many of the wise-boys were starting to
get worried about Jim Pollard's relatively poor shooting this year until
the post-intermission period against the Spartans Saturday evening when he
scored six baskets in rapid succession.
After U.S.C. trips the Golden Bear handily Friday night the latter re
turns the next evening to turn the table around completely. Maybe they're
fixin' the games to up attendance. I'm just kidding, Mr. Masters.
r | I ED SCHROEDER now rates, in my humble opinion, as the number one
amateur tennis player in the country. At the end of the year 1941 Ted
was ranked No. 5 nationally by the mossbacks of the U.S.L.T.A. Speaking
in the vernacular, that means that they though four guys were better
than he. This is where 1 disagree with them, although it is not by far
the only time 1 take exception to them.
I'll admit that Bobby Riggs and Frank Kovacs should be placed above
our boy Schroeder, but they are now in the ranks of the "filthy pros" so
we can cast them from mind. The other two men in front of Ted are
Frankie Parker and Don McNeil. Parker won the U.S. Clay Courts title
last summer and from then on he didn't win anything or come close to it.
When he got on grass his forehand broke down as usual.
It seems a little incongruous to me for the U.S.L.T.A. to put Parker so
high when he did so poorly on grass, since the "L" in U.S.L.TA. doesn't
stand for victory or a type of formation but it does stand for lawn, which
is just a two-bit word for grass.
McNeil evidently got his ranking on the basis of his play the year be
fore when he won the National Championship. The big-wigs not only
overlooked the fact that Schroeder beat McNeil both times they played in
the late summer, but they also waived their usual practice of rating the
players mainly on their showing in the Nationals, where Schroeder fought
Riggs to five sets in the semifinals.
Of course this is just one man's opinion.

|T SPEAKS very well for the Farm cage team which they can win from
a team of Santa Clara's caliber, a team which has already beaten them,
on a night when only one of their men was "hot" and for less than half
the game. It wasn't a lucky win either. The margin of victory was a
solid ten points.
Howie Dallmar tanked a few long ones at the beginning of the second
half Friday night, but aside from that the boys weren't finding the basket
on their long ones. The credit for their victory goes to their tight defense
and to the fact that they finally took advantage of their height on re
bounds and tip-ins.
