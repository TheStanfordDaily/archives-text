# On the Social Front
## 
### 
NOW that the "yes—no—yes—no" debate
over whether to sign Tommy Dorsey for
the Senior Prom has been settled, it may be well
to look objectively at Stanford's future social
program. Official frowns from student govern
ing bodies indicate that expensive entertain
ments are gone with the peace.
What then remains of the campus social pro
gram? Aside from the registration dances and
a few other affairs, the class dances—Soph Co
tillion, Senior Prom—which feature big name
bands comprise the lion's share of the all-cam
pus social program.

And yet the need arising from the emergency
for an even larger program is obvious with the
policy being "study as usual," plus the sug
gestion that students remain closer to campus.
Student leaders are apparently cognizant of
the need. Already the Sunday night movie pro
gram is under way, although high attendance
may warrant having them more than once every
two weeks. Also, the Sadie Hawkins Hop is in
the offing. Planned originally for later in the
year, this dance was stepped up to help fill
the winter quarter program.
Why not, in addition, sport dances after bas
ketball games, not only for all of Stanford, but
also visiting rooters as well? Why not have
more class events, such as the Senior Sings?
Why not have a mixer dance for an hour or
two during the midweek?
Means of inexpensive yet enjoyable enter
tainment are almost inexhaustible.
Our student social planners are probably con
sidering such suggestions as these as well as
others.
We trust they recognize the need for speed
in organization to replace, here on the campus,
the social activities both on and off campus
which have been curtailed.
Another suggestion worth serious considera
tion is presented in the editorial below.—Her
