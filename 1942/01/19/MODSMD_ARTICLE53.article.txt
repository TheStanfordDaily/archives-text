the most thoroughly wholesome
u. and savory activity sponsored by Stanford
sororities during the annual rushing and pledg
ing season is the open house period, the eve
ning of pledging each year.
Net result of the newly telescoped sorority
rushing system, which was contracted to a 10-
day period for the first time this year, will be
computed as accurately as possible and re
viewed this week in this column. Some would
assert this system is not yet quite wholesome
and savory.
But one thing is certain, and the pleasant cer
tainty of it is gratifying. Every pledge night
all nine sororities "see things the same way,"
for once, and graciously welcome all male
comers to open houses.
The beauty of the idea is that no driving is
necessary, the evening is entirely on-campus,
it's free to the men and expense to the women
for refreshments and records is negligible. Not
only that, but you meet a lot of cute women.
Remember the old wheeze that goes some
thing like this?
"Lives there a man with soul so dead, who
never has turned his head, and said, 'Hmm, not
bad!' "
Only tough part about the whole thing is the
workout the poor women get. They have to
dance with the fast-talking shorty and the slim
smoothie, the interesting good guy and the
boring twirp, till they're dead on their feet.
And that's a big order in anybody's sorority
house! Maybe they ought to work in shifts.
Then there is the man who's going steady
with a sorority woman—he might not be too
happy about having to share the girl he loves
with a bunch of wolves. Wait a minute, mister,
the visitors were Stanford gentlemen last Sat
urday night, and they will continue to be. If
you want to be alone with her, you can always
talk to her in a quiet corner.
But any way you look at it, the men have a
swell time, and maybe it wouldn't be asking too
much of the sororities, and the women's halls,
too, to throw more open houses—scatter them
through the quarter. Maybe have two or three
a week-end.
You've done it for the Army and you can do
it for us. How about it, girls?— Harold Shafer

tainty of it is gratifying. Every pledge night
all nine sororities "see things the same way,"
for once, and graciously welcome all male
comers to open houses.
The beauty of the idea is that no driving is
necessary, the evening is entirely on-campus,
it's free to the men and expense to the women
for refreshments and records is negligible. Not
only that, but you meet a lot of cute women.
Remember the old wheeze that goes some
thing like this?
"Lives there a man with soul so dead, who
never has turned his head, and said, 'Hmm, not
bad!' "
Only tough part about the whole thing is the
workout the poor women get. They have to
dance with the fast-talking shorty and the slim
smoothie, the interesting good guy and the
boring twirp, till they're dead on their feet.
And that's a big order in anybody's sorority
house! Maybe they ought to work in shifts.
Then there is the man who's going steady
with a sorority woman—he might not be too
happy about having to share the girl he loves
with a bunch of wolves. Wait a minute, mister,
the visitors were Stanford gentlemen last Sat
urday night, and they will continue to be. If
you want to be alone with her, you can always
talk to her in a quiet corner.
But any way you look at it, the men have a
swell time, and maybe it wouldn't be asking too
much of the sororities, and the women's halls,
too, to throw more open houses—scatter them
through the quarter. Maybe have two or three
a week-end.
You've done it for the Army and you can do
it for us. How about it, girls?— Harold Shafer
the most thoroughly wholesome

sororities during the annual rushing and pledg
ing season is the open house period, the eve

Net result of the newly telescoped sorority
rushing system, which was contracted to a 10-
day period for the first time this year, will be
computed as accurately as possible and re
viewed this week in this column. Some would
