# "The Days of a Man"
## 
### 
THE scope and durability of a man's ideas
and achievements is history's standard of
value In a lonq-ranqe reckoning, what a man

achieves during his lifetime is of little note if
his achievements or ideas contribute nothing to
succeeding generations.
In an editorial which appeared in these col
umns ten years ago today, on the occasion of
Dr. David Starr Jordan's birthday, the writer la
mented the difficulty of registering in true per
spective the greatness of Stanford's first Presi
dent because "We are still too close to him;
we are only beginning to know the value, to
recognize the impression of the man."
And ten years later is historically only a mo
ment later.
Perhaps we do lack "true perspective." But
if we pass on to history the whole burden of
judgment we condemn ourselves as blind.
Knowing the standards of the Muse, we have
a few clues to help us.
Dr. Jordan contributed mightily to world
peace efforts in his day and was accordingly
honored by the Carnegie Institute. His con
tributions in the fields of science and education
have not gone unhonored or unrecognized. Un
less the standards of Western civilization topple
—and that is what we are now struggling to
prevent—we must surely recognize in this man
the hallmarks of greatness.
Stanford students, together with citizens of
the world, recognized then, as they do now,
that Dr. Jordan was the stuff of which history
weaves its fabric of the famous.
As we pause to honor the ninety-first anni
versary of Dr. Jordan's birth, we can see that he
left us much that is of value. No greater proof
could be cited today than the following quo
tation from his address to the graduating class
of 1913 when the world hovered over the
chasm of a great war:
"The only permanent conquest is that of
ideas. America stands, has always stood, for
two ideals from which she cannot escape, for
they are fundamental in her origin and in her
growth. These are internationalism and democ
racy, and these ideals being invincible must
conquer America, and through her, reconquer
Europe."—Rosemarie Mullany

Knowing the standards of the Muse, we have
a few clues to help us.
Dr. Jordan contributed mightily to world
peace efforts in his day and was accordingly
honored by the Carnegie Institute. His con
tributions in the fields of science and education
have not gone unhonored or unrecognized. Un
less the standards of Western civilization topple
—and that is what we are now struggling to
prevent—we must surely recognize in this man
the hallmarks of greatness.
Stanford students, together with citizens of
the world, recognized then, as they do now,
that Dr. Jordan was the stuff of which history
weaves its fabric of the famous.
As we pause to honor the ninety-first anni
versary of Dr. Jordan's birth, we can see that he
left us much that is of value. No greater proof
could be cited today than the following quo
tation from his address to the graduating class
of 1913 when the world hovered over the
chasm of a great war:
"The only permanent conquest is that of
ideas. America stands, has always stood, for
two ideals from which she cannot escape, for
they are fundamental in her origin and in her
growth. These are internationalism and democ
racy, and these ideals being invincible must
conquer America, and through her, reconquer
Europe."—Rosemarie Mullany
THE scope and durability of a man's ideas
and achievements is history's standard of
value In a lonq-ranqe reckoning, what a man

achieves during his lifetime is of little note if
his achievements or ideas contribute nothing to
succeeding generations.
In an editorial which appeared in these col
umns ten years ago today, on the occasion of
Dr. David Starr Jordan's birthday, the writer la
mented the difficulty of registering in true per
spective the greatness of Stanford's first Presi
dent because "We are still too close to him;
we are only beginning to know the value, to
recognize the impression of the man."
And ten years later is historically only a mo
ment later.
Perhaps we do lack "true perspective." But
if we pass on to history the whole burden of
judgment we condemn ourselves as blind.
