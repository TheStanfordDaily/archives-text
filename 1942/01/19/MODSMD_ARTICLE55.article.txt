## OUR THEATER IS SAVED 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
pOR some time I have thought that the theater at
Stanford was growing effete. That last is a new
word that I learned the other day. It means barren,
unproductive, sterile, exhausted. I like that word be
cause it is so small and means so much, and because
it describes so adequately with those six letters ex
actly the condition that the theater has assumed. Not
that the production of plays has been particularly bad
on the campus, but what has been almost intolerable
is the original material that the students have been
able to produce.
This feeling of disgust started last spring when cam
pus authors wrote and presented a show. And then this
fall when I watched the Gaieties, I felt that it was
almost a disgrace that Stanford could not produce a
more interesting, more inspiring three hours than
was produced. I decided that something should be
done, something to give more freshness, more life,
more original humor and real character instead of
the old routine theater situations, gags and characters
that we have had to suffer through for so many years.

A ND I then saw my chance to help. I noticed a sign
on the Daily wall saying that one-act plays were
wanted. That there was a contest and that everyone
was eligible to turn one in. On top of that automatic
membership in the select group of Ram's Head was
promised. And so this Christmas vacation instead of
playing football and playing Santa Claus on Fulton
Street like I usually have to do, I stayed in my room
and typed out a one-act play. I don't say that it is
a great play, but it is at least a play that is alive,
real, with some very deep humorous and serious
moments. On the whole I would say that it is worthy
of presentation in a leading University such as
Stanford.

But it seems that my services were not needed.
It seems that the theater group, from talent wilhin its
own members, was able to pull out of its unproductive
stupor. It has of its own accord and without any
help from me become undeserving of the epithet effete,
for the theater group has three one-act plays that arc
different from the past trash. They must be very good
because they were chosen over mine, and that means
that they are better than mine and mine is a good
one. Needless to say I am very happy, because a
healthy productive theater is an indication of a healthy,
productive student body. I hope that such good work
will be continued in the future, and I can assure you
that I am impatiently waiting the night when I can
see and enjoy these three good one-act plays.

pOR some time I have thought that the theater at
Stanford was growing effete. That last is a new
word that I learned the other day. It means barren,
unproductive, sterile, exhausted. I like that word be
cause it is so small and means so much, and because
it describes so adequately with those six letters ex
actly the condition that the theater has assumed. Not
that the production of plays has been particularly bad
on the campus, but what has been almost intolerable
is the original material that the students have been
able to produce.
This feeling of disgust started last spring when cam
pus authors wrote and presented a show. And then this
fall when I watched the Gaieties, I felt that it was
almost a disgrace that Stanford could not produce a
more interesting, more inspiring three hours than
was produced. I decided that something should be
done, something to give more freshness, more life,
more original humor and real character instead of
the old routine theater situations, gags and characters
that we have had to suffer through for so many years.

A ND I then saw my chance to help. I noticed a sign
on the Daily wall saying that one-act plays were
wanted. That there was a contest and that everyone
was eligible to turn one in. On top of that automatic
membership in the select group of Ram's Head was
promised. And so this Christmas vacation instead of
playing football and playing Santa Claus on Fulton
Street like I usually have to do, I stayed in my room
and typed out a one-act play. I don't say that it is
a great play, but it is at least a play that is alive,
real, with some very deep humorous and serious
moments. On the whole I would say that it is worthy
of presentation in a leading University such as
Stanford.

But it seems that my services were not needed.
It seems that the theater group, from talent wilhin its
own members, was able to pull out of its unproductive
stupor. It has of its own accord and without any
help from me become undeserving of the epithet effete,
for the theater group has three one-act plays that arc
different from the past trash. They must be very good
because they were chosen over mine, and that means
that they are better than mine and mine is a good
one. Needless to say I am very happy, because a
healthy productive theater is an indication of a healthy,
productive student body. I hope that such good work
will be continued in the future, and I can assure you
that I am impatiently waiting the night when I can
see and enjoy these three good one-act plays.
