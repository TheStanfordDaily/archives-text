# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						BLACKED OUT P.O. 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
We are aware that you have nothing whatever to
do with the situation about which we wish to com
plain, but we feel that if our complaint together with
our solution to the problem be brought before the
student body, the party concerned may also "take the
hint." We refer to the locking of the doors of the
Post Office at 6 p.m. We are fully aware of the reason
for doing this, but it is really most inconvenient for
many of us, and also makes us feel as if we were
wasting money by renting a post office box, for the
general delivery window is now fully as convenient
as the "privacy of a post office box."
It is true that should there be a blackout when no
one is on duty in the Post Office after dark, the lights
therein would offer a serious problem. There is, how
ever, a solution—and a simple one.
Why could not the lights be connected with the
street lights? It is certain that (he hitter will be turned
off at the first instant of an air raid alarm, and were
the Post Office lights connected with them, then they,
too, would be automatically turned off. This would
necessitate the installation of a separate circuit so
that the P.O. could join the street light wire at night,
and in the daytime revert back to its present electric
hook-up, but we feel as if the department would be
rewarded by the good will attained and the service
rendered by doing so.
We sincerely hope that some solution may be worked
out.
Yours for improvement.
