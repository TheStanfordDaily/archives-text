# Rooney Mugs Way Through 'Babes' Show
## 
### 
BABES ON BROADWAY, now play

in Palo Alto.
"Not rickets hut crickets" might
be the slogan for this little gem
from MGM, as long as everybody
seems to be getting slogan-con
scious. And the slogan for Mickey
Rooney, the star of the show, might
be "Not good, but loud."
The moon-faced mighty mite has
himself a field day, mugging his way
madly across the camera and gen
erally giving the impression of being
afflicted with chronic St. Vitus'
Dance. He runs the gamut from his
impression of Richard Mansfield as
Cyrano (not funny), to his impres
sion of Carmen Miranda (very
funny), to his impression of a min
strel-show guitar player (???).
As for the rickets, Maestro Rooney
devotes his talents to running a show
for the benefit of some settlement
house children to send them to the
country for a short vacation and
thus prevent them from suffering
from this disease for the rest of
their lives. "I'll take care of every
thing," he says. And this he does,
in the most annoying way conceiv
able.

Marriage seems to have done won
ders for Judy Garland, who shares
top billing with Rooney, but not top
honors. As soon as the studio takes
her out of pigtails she ought to go
places. She certainly steals the pic
ture despite the Rooney mugging.
Let us hope that the irrepressible
Mickey's recent marriage will tone
him down a bit and make him fit for
consumption.

If you are an ardent Mickey Roo
ney fan, we take everything back.
We don't like to antagonize our
readers with promotions coming
around so soon.—Livingston

be the slogan for this little gem
from MGM, as long as everybody
seems to be getting slogan-con
scious. And the slogan for Mickey
Rooney, the star of the show, might
be "Not good, but loud."
The moon-faced mighty mite has
himself a field day, mugging his way
madly across the camera and gen
erally giving the impression of being
afflicted with chronic St. Vitus'
Dance. He runs the gamut from his
impression of Richard Mansfield as
Cyrano (not funny), to his impres
sion of Carmen Miranda (very
funny), to his impression of a min
strel-show guitar player (???).
As for the rickets, Maestro Rooney
devotes his talents to running a show
for the benefit of some settlement
house children to send them to the
country for a short vacation and
thus prevent them from suffering
from this disease for the rest of
their lives. "I'll take care of every
thing," he says. And this he does,
in the most annoying way conceiv
able.

Marriage seems to have done won
ders for Judy Garland, who shares
top billing with Rooney, but not top
honors. As soon as the studio takes
her out of pigtails she ought to go
places. She certainly steals the pic
ture despite the Rooney mugging.
Let us hope that the irrepressible
Mickey's recent marriage will tone
him down a bit and make him fit for
consumption.

ney fan, we take everything back.
