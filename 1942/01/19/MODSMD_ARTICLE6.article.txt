# Stanford Remembers Dr. Jordan's Birthday
## 
### VASHTI O'DONNELL 
"The keynote of the modern uni
versity is its usefulness."
Written in 1903 l>.V Dr. David
Starr Jordan, the first President
of the University, these words
have even greater significance
now as the need for trained men
grows every day.
Today, with the alumni ami fac
ulty of every class from 1891 to
1941, the students of Stanford
pause to remember and commemo
rate Dr. Jordan on his birthday.
Ninety-one years ago this creator
of educational opportunity and
contributor to science was born.
In 1851. then, before the Univer
sity itself was conceived, its des
tiny was assured to be gnat. For
to Dr. Jordan, who built half of
his lifetime around the University,
Stanford owes much of its spirit
and many of its traditions.
FORTY YEARS
Forty successive classes of men
and women came directly under
his kindly influence. Today, Stan
ford men and women still fÂ»el his
influence because he left innu
merable writings on varied sub
jects of science, education, war,
and peace.
In his "Voice of the Schola," he

refers to the university as the
greatest need of popular govern
ment, and "the greatest need of
higher education as democracy."
On this, his birthday, which
comes in time of a war, one can
not overlook the importance he
attached to a university education.
He wrote, "The government by
the people needs its trained and
educated men more than any other
kind of government; for while
monarchy seeks far and wide for
strong men and wise to be used as
its tools, strength and wisdom is
the daily life of a successful de
mocracy."
He stressed that the need for
men of high culture and exact
training is extremely necessary in a
democracy because the leaders
must hold the people, and that
nothing can be done for a democ
racy save what the people do for
themselves."
DIED IN 1931
Stanford's David Starr Jordan
served as President for twenty-five
years, and continued to direct its
principles and ideals as Chancel
lor until his death in 1931.
1891 to 1931 ... a record un
surpassed.
