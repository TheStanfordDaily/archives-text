### AMIE REICHERT 
r oh Best Beloved, is the story
of U Saw and his friend U Tin
Tut and the journey they made one
November from far off Burma to
London, and what happened after
ward. *
That was last year, and Great
Britain was fighting the second
World War, when U Saw came to
sec Mr. Churchill. He must have
made a fabulous — which means
amazing, astonishing — picture a.">
he walked the streets of London in
his silken toga and a brightly col
ored skirt, with a handkerchief on
his head. He came to No. 10
Downing Street with a box of
black Burmese cheroots and a re
quest for self-determination.
U Tin Tut was his Oxford-edu
eated secretary, a fine man, and I
am only putting him in the story,
oh Best Beloved, because he has
such a nicc name. But he has noth
ing to do with what happened.

see, U Saw, premier of
Burma, away off in his land of
strange names and stranger placcs,
heard of the meeting in mid-Atlan
tic between Mr. Churchill and Mr.
Roosevelt, and he read of the famous
charter they drew up there.
And the third provision of that
Atlantic Charter was all about self
determination and the right of peo
ples to decide whether they shall
govern or be governed.
So U Saw put on his handker
chief and took U Tin Tut and they
went to London and asked the
Prime Minister please to make
Burma a dominion. But the
Prime Minister was rather busy
waging a war, and he asked U Saw
please to wait until after this was
over and then we'll see.
U Saw was disgruntled. He left
the British Isles and came to the
United States to try to persuade the
President and the State Department
that they should help Burma become
a dominion. But he didn't get very
far in Washington either, so he
stalled for home.

SAW U Saw, Oh Best Beloved,
when he came through San Fran
cisco on his way to take the Pan-
American clipper. He said then that
he had enjoyed meeting Mr. Church
ill very much. "He was blunt in his
words to me and I was blunt with
him," he said.
lie also said, "We would rather
trust the Devil we know (Britain)
than the Devil we don't know
(Japan)."
Well, the next thing that hap
pened was this: The Japanese and
the British went to war with one
another and the British used Burma
as an aerial base for attacks on the
Japanese who were threateningly
close to Singapore. Also the Ameri
cans sent many supplies to their
Chinese ally by way of the Burma
road which has its main port of entry
in U Saw's country.
Fierce air battles raged over
Itangoon where the Japanese
dropped heavy bombs and many
of them. But these raids were
never successful because the
American pilots, based on Bur
mese flying bases, fought off the
enemy each time, and after a few
days of this, carried the war to the
Japanese airfields.

then, oh Best Beloved, came
the news that U saw had been
arrested in London and the reason
was that he was supposed to have
plotted with the Japanese, the Devil
he didn't know, to hand over his
country and his 14 million good peo
ple to the Japanese. And I suppose
he was going to do this because he
was angry at the British and maybe
he even thought the Japanese would
make his people free, but everyone
knows they wouldn't have—l'm sure
I don't know why.
What I do know is that U Saw
was arrested yesterday by sonic
very angry Englishman. And now
everyone is quite angry with him
and he is left like the cat who
walks by himself—and I should say
he deserved it, wouldn't you?
U Saw, like Esau, sold his birth
right, but he didn't even get a mess
of pottage.
I don't know what happened to
U Tin Tut.
