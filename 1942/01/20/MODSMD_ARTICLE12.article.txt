# Council to Show Defense Films
## 
### 
Six war - time films from Great
Britain will be shown in a continu
ous show from 4 to 9 p.m. tomorrow
in the Memorial Auditorium under
arrangements by the Stanford Ci
vilian Defense Council.
The council has arranged a con
tinuous show beginning at 4 p.m.
in order to all stu
dents, faculty members, and campus
residents. Each show will last about
an hour, with the last showing start
ing at 9 p.m.
The films to be shown are "Stop
That Fire," "London Fire Raids,"
"Goofer Trouble," "Coastal Defen.se,"
"War and Order," and "Wartime
Factory." They were chosen because
they particularly illustrate the du
ties of emergency defense organiza
tions during bombings and black
outs.
There is no admission charge, and
all students and campus residents
are urged to see the films in order
to acquaint themselves with the
duties of individual civilians and
squad members under bombing con
ditions.
