NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Jan. 20
(UP). —An enemy sub which at
tacked the tanker Malay with tor
pedo and shell fire Monday killed
at least one and possibly five
crew members.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 19 (UP).—
Axis efforts lo disrupt the Pan-
American conference of foreign min
isters with threats of immediate
military reprisal if the South Ameri
can nations sever relations with
Germany, Italy and Japan caused
proponents of a break to move
swiftly tonigiit for a united anti-
Axis declaration.
It was stated authoritatively that
the political committee of the con
ference—charged with matters con
nected with the defense of the hem
isphere—will approve the resolution
for a break with the Axis Wednes
day or Thursday, with the support
probably of all 21 American repub
lics, except Argentina.
NOT HOPELESS'
The Argentine situation, however,
was described as "not yet hopeless."
In connection with Argentina's
and Chile's opposition, it was re
vealed on the highest authvjrity that
the Axis has warned Argentina,
Brazil, Chile and perhaps other na
tions that a diplomatic break would
be regarded as an act of war and that
they "must bear the consequences."
DEADLINE SET
It was explained that a virtual
deadline had been fixed for acting-
President Ramon S. Castillo of Ar
gentina and his foreign minister, En
rique Ruiz Guinazu, to make up
their minds.
Framers of the severance resolu
tion believed that Chile, the other
doubtful eountry, probably will sup
port it, although Chilean quarters
said tonight they could not back the
measure, due to the uncertain polit
ical situation in Chile and the fact
that the United States is unable to
provide any immediate aid in de
fense of their country's long and ex
posed coast.
