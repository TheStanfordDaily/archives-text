# AFL-CIO PEACE DENIED BY CIO HEAD MURRAY
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (UP). -
Budding hopes for an AFL-CIO
peace were handed stinging blows
tonight by leaders of both organi
zations and informed labor circles
doubted a truce is even remotely
imminent.
The week-end proposal by former
CIO President John L. Lewis that
talks be revived with a view toward
obtaining an "accouplement" of the
rival factions to expedite war pro
duction, appeared to have surprised
Philip Murray, present head of the
organization, and he gave it a frigid
reception.
NO TRUCE IMMINENT
He disclosed in New York that he
had written Lewis stating bluntly
that any move toward resumption of
peace talks would have to be ini
tiated through his (Murray's) office.
He added that he would, however,
present Lewis' suggestion to the CIO
executive board which meets on
Jan. 24.
Belief that no immediate labor
truce is imminent was shared by
AFL officials.
CONSOLIDATION DENIED
The new organization, according to
the dispatch, would be headed by
AFL Secretary-Treasurer George
Meaney, with Murray serving as sec
retary-treasurer. The Times said
Green would retire on a pension of
$20,000 annually and Murray would
be paid $18,000 a year. It said the
plan grew out of conversations be
tween Lewis and Daniel J. Tobin,
iron-fisted boss of the AFL team
sters.
