"Yes," she said, and her voice
was firm.
"Three hearts," said his partner
tentatively.
IVliss Stephenson's eyes got a
desperate gleam.
"It's the last time—the absolute
last time."

"Yeah? Four no."
"We mean it, honest we do.
We've .iust got to have those pic
tures!" Hysteria was evident.
"Five diamonds," said the part
ner, and then turning to Miss Ste
phenson he smiled kindly.
"Run along, little girl; those
Quad deadlines come a dime a
dozen."
"I know." She had the despair
of a man who has cried wolf. "But
we mean it this time. You've got
to tell them, you've just got to."
"Seven spades! Put 'em down
partner. Say, whoinell did she
think she was kiddin'?"
