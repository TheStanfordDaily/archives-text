WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (UP). —Successful U.S. Army bomber attacks
on two Japanese air bases in the Far East were reported tonight by the
War Department which revealed the Americans shot down nine enemy
interceptor planes in a dogught over the Dutch East Indies and set fire
to Jap planes and hangars on the Malayan Peninsula.

y It was the first officially disclosed
time that American Army bombers
had participated in fighting on the
Malay Peninsula.
NINE JAPS DOWNED
The air battle occurred over the
Japanese-held airbase at Menado on
the island of Celebes. An American
formation of five bombers dropped
several bombs on the field with un
determined results, then encountered
a group of Japanese interceptor
planes.
Nine enemy craft were shot down
in the ensuing fight. Two American
bombers are missing, a third was
damaged and four members of its
crew were wounded.
YANKS FIRE AIRDROME
In the other action—against the
Japanese-held Sungei Patani air
drome on Malaya—the Americans set
three large fires among enemy air
craft on the ground and in the
hangar area and returned to their
bases unscathed.
The War Department report that
although the Philippine theater of
conflict was devoid of major action
during the past 24 hours, enemy
ground patrols and aerial reconnais
sance units were active. This seems
to be the tip-ofT that the Japanese
were preparing for still another big
push.
