# Daisy Maes Corner 169 Dance Bids
## Farm Women Mob Office for Hawkins Tickets; Men Rebel 
### BILL COUGHLIN 
A threatened male rebellion rose
to major proportions yesterday as
Stanford men protested the Sadie
Hawkins Dance; but Farm women
mobbed the A.S.S.U. office, buying
160 bids, serene in the belief that the
"stronger sex" would capitulate at
the strategic moment.
"We are worth more than 3 cents,"
howled the outraged and indignant
Li'l Abners. "Nuts," smiled the 169
Daisy Maes. And they plunked their
precious pennies on the counter, 9
for tax, 87 for themselves, and 3, a
mere ties CENTAVOS, not pesos,
for the men they snare.
STORM OFFICE
A crowd of women stormed the
window of the office early yesterday
morning to obtain bids, but the
frustrated male who had the tickets
didn't show up, smirking in a nasty
little way, until 10 o'clock. Un
daunted by this first open sign of
rebellion, The Women surged back
to set a new first-day ticket sales
record.
"At this rate," stated the amazed
dance chairman, Dodie Dolan, "the
tickets will be all gone within the
next few days. Dogpatch never saw
anything like this."
MEN NECESSARY
Nonplussed by the terrific rush for
bids, Farm men nevertheless held
out. "Without us, it'll flop," they
warned. "We demand equality. The
bids must read: women—4s cents,
men—4s cents. Otherwise, there
won't be a male in the Pavilion be
tween the hours of 9:30 and 1 a.m.
Saturday night."
A blonde Chi O summed up the
women's viewpoint of the alleged
strike nicely:
"Frankly, 3 cents is too much."
BURLAP STYLISH
Costumes for the jig will be in the
traditional style of Dogpatch, Ky.
Loud shirts, jeans, corncob pipes,
short, ragged skirts, straw hats,
ginghams were all sighted at last
year's hop. One girl even showed up
in a burlap sack with a jug of "corn
likker" over her shoulder.
Main worry of the Daisy Maes,
who are laughing at the rebellious
conduct of the Li'l Abners, is the
problem of transportation. Last year,
Farm men, desperate for dates, of
fered their cars to the women, but
this year there is no such prospect
in the offing from the peeved male
population.
At the first Sadie Hawkins Hop,
two years ago, the Gamma Phi's
solved the problem by hiring a hay
wagon to transport their dates. Roller
skates and wheel chairs are also
possibilities.
