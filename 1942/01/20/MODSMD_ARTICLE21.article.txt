# Naval Officer To Speak Here
## Commander Aroff Will Answer Queries 
### 
"The Navy Program in Relation to
Colleges" will be the subject of a
talk to be given in the Education
Auditorium at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
evening by Lieutenant Commander
M. N. ArofT of the Navy's personnel
division.
Commander ArofT, who will be ac
companied by a Junior Officer, will
give ample time to a question period
after his talk. There have been
many questions concerning the
Navy's V-7 class, the A.V.S., the
Naval Supply Corps, and the Naval
Intelligence arising of late and it is
expected that Comamnder ArofT will
clear up these questions.
The Commander is bringing a
large number of application blanks
for V-7 and the Naval Supply Corps
to the Farm in order to facilitate the
sign-up of potential Navy men. It
should be emphasized that Com
mander ArofT's talk will not concern
the air aspect of the Navy.
Harry Morgan, student defense
co-ordinator, in announcing that
Commander ArofT would speak on
the Farm, expressed the opinion that
this would benefit not only seniors
and juniors who have scrvice prob
lems already, but. also sophomores
and freshmen who will soon have to
start thinking about how they can
best serve the nation.
Morgan also stated that he believed
the visit of a marine recruiting offi
cer who will be on the Farm in the
next, two or three weeks will also
aid in giving Stanford men an in
sight into what branches of the serv
ice they may enter .
