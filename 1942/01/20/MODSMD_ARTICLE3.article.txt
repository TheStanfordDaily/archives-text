# Gordy Reviews Blackout Rules
## 
### 
"There seems to be a false impres
sion that there is a three-to-fivc
minute period after the blackout
siren sounds before lights must be
turned off," declared Stanford's
police chief Gordon Davis yesterday.
"This is not so," he continued.
"The danger is immediate."
He added that cars should get as
far off the road as possible. Emer
gency cars have to move in black
outs, and they are equipped with
"blackout lights." Chief Davis
warned that pedestrians should keep
on the sidewalks, because the driv
ers of these emergency vehicles can
not see pedestrians in the faint light
of the special headlights. Their
purpose is to warn approaching cars,
not to light the road.
There have been no tire thefts on I
; the Stanford campus yet, Gordy j
said; but students should avoid leav- J
ing their cars in lonely or dark
places at night. It is better when
possible to leave cars at home if
! there is danger of being caught in a
blackout and having to abandon the
| car.
Chief Davis warned that stiff pen
alties will be given to those trying
| to drive that last block or two after
the siren sounds. He said that driv
ing just a short way may not seem
; dangerous, but it may cost some
one's life.
