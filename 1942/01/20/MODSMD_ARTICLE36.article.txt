i "The greatest problem facing (lie airplane industry today is finding
! suHicient capable men and training them for responsible positions," said
R. Randall Irwin, director of industrial relations at Lockheed Aircraft
1 Corporation, last night.
IVIr. Irwin addressed a* group of men students in Encina lobby in the

second of a series of vocational
ance talks sponsored by Men's Vo
com and the Dean's office.
Qualifying the title of his talk,
"Opportunities in Aviation and Ae
ronautical Industries," Mr. Irwin
stated that Lockheed employed only
100 men in 1934 and that today the
corporation includes 51,000 workers.
STAY IN SCHOOL'
The noted industrialist urged st.u
-| dents to remain in college until it is
clear that they should leave. He
cited President Roosevelt's words
that "it is the patriotic duty of stu
dents to continue their normal course
of education and be prepared to be
of greater use to their country."
According to Mr. Irwin, a well
trained engineer is far more import
ant than a riveter in respect to the
time of training period.
PLANE DEMAND
"The need for airplanes will not
cease with the conclusion of the
war," stated Mr. Irwin. "With design
improvements pouring in, and with
modern planes steadily going out of
date, it would be unsubstantial to
: greatly reduce production. Facto-
I ries will need salesmen and business
i men to handle foreign markets.

Mr. Irwin, who recently returned
from Washington, flew north espe
cially for last night's address. He
was introduced by Walt Smith,
Chairman of Men's Vocom.
