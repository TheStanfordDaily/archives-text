SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19 (UP).â€”A
20,000 gallon tank of kerosene burst
into flames tonight, adding new de
struction to the toll of a conflagra
tion that swept an oil storage lot in
the north suburbs of Sacramento
last night and early today.
The 40-hour week of the federal
wage and hour law does not apply
to the railway workers' trades.
