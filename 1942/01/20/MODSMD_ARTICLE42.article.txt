# Card Cagers Tackle U.S.F. Dons Tonight
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford's varsity cagers will help
"Buy a Bomber" tonight.
For U.S. defense Coach Everett
Dean vends his Kedincn against
U.S.F. at 7:45 in the San Francisco
Civic Auditorium in the second
game <>f a triple - headed all-star
hill. California, returned from its
southern invasion after a split with
U.S.C., meets Golden State in the
0:39 curtain raiser, while St. Mary's
and Santa Clara rate the top spot in
the three-ring hoopfest at 9.
The big show is sponsored by the
San Francisco Examiner.
Mitey Mushy Silver, 5-foot-5 and
a half feet of whirlwind basketball,
sparkplugged the Dons to victories
over two of Stanford's conference
foes, U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., and St.
Mary's.
FOUR-INCH DEFICIT
We've figured the Dons' starting
line-up will average six l'eet, spot
ting the Indians four inches per man.
But 1 here's one man on the U.S.F.
squad that won't be spotted any
thing. And that's center Allen
Wells—6-foot-6 and 195 pounds.
"Big" Al, or the "Duster" as
they call him in the Don camp,
should he a BIG help to Coach
Forrest Twogood, if he doesn't hit
his head on the hackboard. Hail
ing from Lindsay, Cal., Wells is
veddy agile for a man of his si/e,
and Stanford's pivot man, Ed Voss,
will he matched inch for inch and
then some.
The Indians hold two victories
over U.S.F., but according to Gene
Sullivan, sports editor of The Daily
Foghorn, U.S.F.'s newspaper, the
Dons are so fast on the floor they
"may outmaneuver the tall but slow
Indians."
CARDS FAST TOO
Wait till Gene sees Jimmy Pol
lard, Don Burness, Voss, Bill Cow
den, and Howie Dallmar in action.
If they look like a herd of turtles he
can send us a hat C.O.D.—and we'll
eat it.
Diminutive Silver's running mate
al guard is Irwin "Biff" Bafigo,
unanimously voted All-City choice
while playing for Commerce High
two years hack.
At one forward the Dons send out \
Jim Porter, 6-foot-2, 192 pounds and j
the only senior on the club. Porter
was one of the high scorers last year j
and can handle equally well either |
center or forward.
BUSSENIUS HIGH MAN
Perhaps the most colorful man on [
the squad, Bill "Tiny" Bussenius, j
handles the other forward post, i
"Tiny" was high scorer on the 1940- ;
■11 team with 141 points in 16 games. '
In these non-conference encoun- '
ters, Stanford's opponents are gun
ning for "upset" victories. And
they're usually playing their best
brand of basketball when up against
non-con teams. The Indians will of
course start as pre-game favorites,
and tonight must plad heads up all
the way to make it three straight.

BERKELEY, Jan. 19 CUP).—For
ty-three men turned out for the
University of California annual
