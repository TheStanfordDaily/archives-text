TOWARD the end of last quarter, Interfrater
nity Council took its rushing rules seriously
and fined one of the houses for some illegal
rushing.
That didn't hurt very much. Pledging was a
long way off. But it gave the rest of the campus
the impression that this year's Interfraternity
Council was pretty progressive and aware of
the problems confronting it. At that time it
was stated that further infractions of the rules
would be stringently dealt with.
Now as the last few weeks of rushing draw
close, there are lots of rumors of illegal, off
campus rushing flying around.
Interfraternity acted again and probably
nipped a lot of it in the bud by warning all
houses against such practices.
But there is pretty definite evidence that this
warning was not as effective as it might have
been.
It is to be hoped that the Interfraternity
Council and Board will have the foresight to
penalize definite violations, set up rules gov
erning something which has heretofore gone un
noticed, and translate into action its pledge of
last quarter that all illegal rushing will be
penalized.
