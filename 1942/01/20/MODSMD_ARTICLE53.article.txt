# America—After the War
## 
### 
LOOK at the world today. It is a world play
ing an insane game and we are the pawns.
Yet if the stakes are worth the sacrifice, we
surely cannot regret the sacrifices.
And if evidence be needed to assure us that
we are now fighting for something, President
Roosevelt's National Resources and Planning
Board supplies us with this evidence.
As Roosevelt and Churchill lock to a post
war world, the National Resources and Planning
Board looks to a post-war United States. The
Board recently proposed the following "nine
freedoms" in a report for post-war America.
1. The right to work, usefully and creatively
through the productive years.
2. The right to fair play, adequate to com
mand the necessities and amenities of life in
exchange for work, ideas, thrift, and other so
cially valuable services.
3. The right to adequate food, clothing, shel
ter, and medical care.
4. The right to security, with freedom from
fear of old age, want, dependency, sickness,
unemployment, and accident.
5. The right to live in a system of free enter
prise, free from compulsory labor, irresponsible
private power, arbitrary public authority and
unregulated monopolies.
6. The right to come and go, to speak or to
be silent, free from the spyings of secret politi
cal police.
7. The right to equality before the law, with
equal access to justice in fact.
8. The right to education for work, for citi
zenship, and for personal growth and happiness.
9. The right to rest, recreation and adventure,
the opportunity to enjoy life and take part in an
advancing civilization.
Little need be said about these "freedoms";
they speak for themselves. The fact, however,
that we are looking beyond the primary task
of annihilating international gangsterism is most
encouraging, particularly at the same time as
we are preparing ourselves for the greatest
battle in our lives.—Herman Silverman
