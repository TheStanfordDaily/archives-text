# In the Mood
## 
### 
SUNDAY night's attendance at the first of the
winter quarter campus movie series showed
decisively that students are "in the mood" for
on-campus activities.
Just about twice as many people as were
expected lined up for tickets in front of Memo
rial Hall before the show.
Needless to say, this type of activity is just
what is necessary to fill out the campus social
calendar in the light of the present emergency.
If the quality of the feature shows can be kept
as high as it has started, the A.S.S.U. may even
be warranted in expanding the program to a
Sunday night movie once a week instead of
once every two weeks.
It might, however, be wise for the A.S.S.U.
to take note of a few of the constructive criti
cisms made by students after the first show;
1. Try, if possible, to secure standard size
35-mm. films instead of the 16-mm. reductions.
The quality of reproduction of both sound and
pictures would be immeasurably improved.
There would be no waiting between each reel
to rethread the projector since there are com
plete facilities for continuous projection of 35-
mm. films in the theater. Tf the attendance holds

up, the possible slight extra cost entailed would
be adequately covered, and the popularity of
the pictures would be strongly increased.
2. The serial is swell, but the quality of
the cartoons could be raised to advantage. The
popularity and goodwill of the series would,
as in the first case, cover any slight increase in
costs.
3. It might be advisable to sell tickets
throughout the week previous to a show in the
A.S.S.U. office for those who wanted to avoid
the wait in line.
These above are minor details and should not
be interpreted as criticism of the A.S.S.U. com
mittee, under Barbara Sadler, which is respon
sible for all the work done in planning and
bringing back to reality this quarter a good
Stanford custom.
