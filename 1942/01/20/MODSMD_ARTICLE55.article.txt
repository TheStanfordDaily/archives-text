# A 						Different Show
## 
### 
THE powerful projectors of Memorial Hall
will throw another kind of movie from that
mentioned above on the screen tomorrow af
ternoon and evening.
No admittance will be charged. The subject
matter will be stark, real, instructive rather than
entertaining.
There will be pictures of bombings in London
and other parts of England. There will be other
instructive pictures showing just what to do
to counter the effects of incendiary bombs and
other forms of disaster which may come to the
Pacific Coast at any time during the war.
These films will be run in a continuous show
ing tomorrow afternoon and then again in the
evening. All students and other campus resi
dents are urged by the Stanford Civilian De
fense Council to drop in to the theater for an
hour tomorrow. It is essential that as many
civilians as possible know what to do and
how to do it in case an actual air raid hits close
to us, wherever we may be.
