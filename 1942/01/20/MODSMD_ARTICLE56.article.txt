MOVIES FOR TWENTY CENTS
are always strange days. There is always
so much work to start in on after laying off for the
week-end, that a person gets a little confused and
feels like letting the whole thing go and starting out
Monday morning, bright and early. That's always the
way I feel on Sundays. And about the best thing to
do on Sunday evenings after dinner is to stroll over to
a movie. Therefore you can understand why the huge
Memorial Theater was crowded full last Sunday, when
the first movie of the new series was presented.
Of course the students can go into Palo Alto and to
the other theaters around here, but they are so ex
pensive. Every time I pay 50 cents for the movies that
they make these days I get so mad at myself that I
can't see for about a day. I like to see a show every
once in a while, even as bad as they are, but, not at
the prices that they ask. None of them, or very few of
them, ai'e worth more than 20 cents.
The first picture was "Algiers," one of the better
pictures that Hollywood has turned out. It was thor
oughly enjoyed by everyone, although it didn't seem
that Hedy Lamarr had the same appeal this time as
she had when the picture was first released. The little
shorts could have been better, and the Buck Rogers
serial was fantastic enough to be interesting, and was
good material for the hecklers. Incidentally, heckling
in pictures like that is all right, I suppose, but they
could have been better than they were that night. In
our high school assemblies, we really had some funny
ones.
The one objection that could be made about the
evening was that everyone had to stand out in the
cold for quite a while, waiting to get tickets. I'm sure
that this little difficulty can be straightened. And one
other thing, the movies are going to be presented only
every other week, instead of every Sunday. I think
that the movies on Sundays are good and they should
be given every week, if for no other reason than that
it is such a strain to keep Buck Rogers in a burning
ship for more than one week.

hphis week-end we are having our Sadie Hawkins
dance, and that means that girls are forgetting
their traditional opinions of themselves and are going
to act like human beings and do the things that they
want to do. For further discussion along those lines,
refer to the Bull Sessions on the same subject that
appeared last fall. I only bring the matter up again
because my roommate is getting a little scared. He
asked me if it was possible to mention our phone
number in the column because he feels that we are
living under a handicap in living off the campus. I
know that it means a lot to my roommate to be asked
to the dance, and if he isn't asked he will get mad and
start sulking around and that will mean that all sorts
of little unpleasant difficulties will mar our usual peace
ful living for the next couple of days. And so with
out further apologies the number is 25063. Incidentally,
since I am the roommate of my roommate, I have the
same number as he has.
