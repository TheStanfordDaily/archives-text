# CAMPUS OPINION
## ANSWER TO 'AGITATOR' 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
Last night in Encina lobby Mr. Randall Irwin,
director of industrial relations at Lockheed, talked to
a large and enthusiastic crowd of Stanford men on per
sonnel work in aircraft manufacturing.
In Campus Opinion Friday, "Agitator," in a very
friendly spirit questioned the choice of Encina lobby
as the proper place for the talk. It is true that a
large number of fellows not living in Encina were
present last night, but the lobby did not prove too
small as foreseen by "Agitator." The possibility of
its doing so were foreseen and seriously considered,
and it was decided to have the talks continued in
Encina lobby for the following reasons:
(1) A campus poll taken in the spring two years ago
showed an overwhelming majority in favor of Encina
lobby;
(2) the lobby lends itself to an atmosphere of in
formality which we consider highly desirable;
(3) the acoustics are very satisfactory; and
(4) Encina is the most easily accessible to the ma
jority of fellows who will attend the talk and is just
about as well located for the other fellows as any
other place would be.
Hoping that these reasons answer the criticism, I
am
Walt Smith, Chairman
