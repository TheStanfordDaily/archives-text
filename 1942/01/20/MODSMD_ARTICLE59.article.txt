# Hertzler Analyzes American Home Life in Latest Book
## 
### 
"THE DOCTOR AND HIS PATIENTS," by Arthur E. Herlzlcr.
This latest hook of the horse-and-buggy doctor is a diagnosis of the
ills of American family life, amidst the conflicting forces of the modern
world. Based on chapter eleven of his first hook, it is an outspoken analysis
of what makes success or failure in marriage.

He attributes the majority of di
vorces or broken homes to lack of
education in the meaning of home
making and to lack of tolerance on
the part of those who marry. By
using many of his own case histories,
he presents concrete examples of
the points which he maintains.
The first part of the book deals
with the meaning and import of
courtship and the marriage cere
mony, the second with making a
home a success, and the third with
the causes of divorce and separation.
He bases his convictions upon a faith
in the power of the child and a
deep religious faith.
He departs from purely personal
analysis to the realm of world affairs
and possible solutions to the prob
lem of recurrence of war every 20
years. His commentaries are in
many cases abnormally bitter, but
typical of the feeling of most doctors
who give so much time and effort to
bringing a life into the world, merely
to see it snuffed out thoughtlessly
in the mass murder of war.
The chief merit of the book is in
prodigious use of actual case histories
which the old doctor uses to enliven
the book with interest and signifi
cance. It is not only instructive but
also entertaining because of the au
thor's caustic humor.—Craig
