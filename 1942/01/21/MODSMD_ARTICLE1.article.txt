### AMIE REICHERT 
JOHN L. LEWIS is a man with a
** peculiar kind of a conscience.
"John L.," his conscience says,
"you've been failing me, boy. You
haven't made the headlines since
Pearl Harbor and I'm getting a little
tired of waiting around in the back
ground for something to happen."
"Well," says John L. to his con
science. "what can I do? You have
to admit I tried my damnedest
with the captive mine strike, and I
was going along fine until That
Sunday. When I finally won the
case, nol>ody even noticcd if ex
cept Wcstbrook Pegler and my
mother."
"I know, I know," says the C., "the
trouble with this country now is that
everybody's so hot for National
Unity that trouble-makers like us
don't even get a look-in. But I
have an idea."
"Tell me," says John L., leering at
himself.
"A cinch," says the C. "Hop on
the Unity Boat and start running
things. Give Friend William Green
the sandwich, rub out Pal Phil Mur
ray and take over."

TOHN L. rubs his eyebrows
*' thoughtfully. He likes the idea
.fine so he picks up an olive branch
and heads for Friend GreerT, waving
it in one hand, a white flag in the
other, and concealing a blunt instru
ment in the other.
"Let me call you sweetheart,"
says John L. to Win.
"Sorry," says Wm. craftily.
"Let's go steady," says John L.
"Sorry," says Wm. the Fox.
"Let's work in groups," says
John L.
"Some other time," says Wm.
cagily.
"Just me for you 'n' you for me?"
says John L.
"Uh-huh," says Wm. slyly.
But John L. made sure first that
he would have Wm. on the spot be
cause he told all the newspapers all
over the country that the CIO and
the AFL were going to unite, that
Lewis would be vice-president,
Green would retire, and Murray
would become Secretary or Treas
urer or something.

r pHE result so far has been noth
ing but a lot of hue and cry
and applause and general hubba
hubba, and the picture is very con
fused because the big bulky shadow
of John L. Lewis is clouding the issue
for a lot of sincere, patriotic labor
leaders and plain citizens who ear
nestly desire peace within Labor's
ranks but can't quite stomach the
thought of Lewis being the Czar of
some 10 million union workers.
Mr. Green is among this latter
group. lie has declared to the
press that he is willing to discuss
peace terms, but he has had his
suspicions doubly aroused by the
apparent desire of the CIO has
been to send him to the Old Fol|s
Home.
The idea of forging the two great
labor unions in this country into
one powerful organization and then
depositing this weapon into the all
too-eager hands of a man like Lewis
who is as ruthless and shrewd a
power-seeker as the labor movement
has ever produced is a little terri
fying-
The combined man-power of the
AFL and CIO now numbers ap
proximately 10 million workers.
This figure, however, is constantly
growing with the President's new
war program.
An organization such as Lewis
proposes could easily become the
most powerful political and economic
group in t.he country—which factor
is not in itself necessarily dangerous
except as it's leadership uses that
power.

| EWIS showed no great passion for
national unity or for peace with
in labor's ranks until he saw there
was a chance for him to get some
thing for John L. Lewis out of such
a merger.
Now he is up to his tricks again,
lint there is a very good chance
that he may get the sandwich this
time. It would he a great thing
for this country and for American
labor if the two unions united—

JOHN L. LEWIS is a man with a

"John L.," his conscience says,
"you've been failing me, boy. You
haven't made the headlines since
Pearl Harbor and I'm getting a little
tired of waiting around in the back
ground for something to happen."
"Well," says John L. to his con
science. "what can I do? You have
to admit I tried my damnedest
with the captive mine strike, and I
was going along fine until That
Sunday. When I finally won the
case, nol>ody even noticcd if ex
cept Wcstbrook Pegler and my
mother."
"I know, I know," says the C., "the
trouble with this country now is that
everybody's so hot for National
Unity that trouble-makers like us
don't even get a look-in. But I
have an idea."
"Tell me," says John L., leering at
himself.
"A cinch," says the C. "Hop on
the Unity Boat and start running
things. Give Friend William Green
the sandwich, rub out Pal Phil Mur
ray and take over."

TOHN L. rubs his eyebrows
*' thoughtfully. He likes the idea
.fine so he picks up an olive branch
and heads for Friend GreerT, waving
it in one hand, a white flag in the
other, and concealing a blunt instru
ment in the other.
"Let me call you sweetheart,"
says John L. to Win.
"Sorry," says Wm. craftily.
"Let's go steady," says John L.
"Sorry," says Wm. the Fox.
"Let's work in groups," says
John L.
"Some other time," says Wm.
cagily.
"Just me for you 'n' you for me?"
says John L.
"Uh-huh," says Wm. slyly.
But John L. made sure first that
he would have Wm. on the spot be
cause he told all the newspapers all
over the country that the CIO and
the AFL were going to unite, that
Lewis would be vice-president,
Green would retire, and Murray
