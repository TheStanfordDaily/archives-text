# Dance Series By Orchesis Scores Hit
## 
### HELEN LIVINGSTON 
Dynamic action, exciting rhythms,
and magnificent technique â€” these
qualities keynoted the Orchesis
cenccrt presented last night on the
Tuesday Evening Series.
Undoubtedly the most popular
number of the evening was "Metro
politan Montage," a part of the
"Dances from the American Scene"
which made up the second portion of
the program. A satirical presenta
tion of city life, the dance featured
the idea of a "stop-and-go civiliza
tion with the jitters," a theme treated
with charm and humor. Jacques
Poley and Joyce Glasmann as bur
lesque queens drew much applause,
and Margaret Jewell, dance director
of Orchesis, was little short of sen
sational.
DRUM ACOMPANIMENT
"Primitive Mode" was moving and
exciting, enhanced by its accompani
ment of a beating drum.
Eleanor Judell's solo, "First Jour
ney," was a feelingly presented pic
ture of the awakening adolescent
and served as an excellent transition
piece between the welcoming spirit
of the opening dance and the more
complicated "Primitive Mode."
The remainder of the "Dances
from the American Scene" were im
pressive, not only for the fine
thoughts expressed, but for the
amazing control and admirable tech
nique of the dancers. Jean Now
ell's expressive narrative was well
presented.
WELL INTEGRATED
Actually no individual performers
should be singled out for praise, for
the group as a whole functioned as
a perfectly integrated unit, which is
the final proof of the success of this
type of program.
This ' reviewer's only regret is
that the program was too short, and
that Orchesis concerts are given
only too seldom. Last night's suc
cess proved that modern dance can
be a popular attraction at Stanford.
