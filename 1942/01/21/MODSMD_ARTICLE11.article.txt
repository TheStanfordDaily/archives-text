# Owen Warns Of Blackout Enforcement
## Student Councils To Punish Breach Of Defense Rules 
### BUD AMES 
A warning by Stan Owen, chair
man of Men's Council and member
of the Defense Council, to the effect
that officials of Santa Clara County
1 may override any decisions of either
Student Councils regarding blackout
violations, momentarily held the
wavering spotlight of Excom discus
sion at the very cut-and-dried
| meeting last night.
"Council members have been dis
| cussing blackouts with ihe Admin
istration," Owen explained, "and the
J Administration has left the punish
ment of blackout violations in our
hands. And let me add that every
violation of complete co-operation
will be roughly handled.
"And always remember that Santa
Clara County officials can still go
| over our heads. They are still in
; the driver's seat."
In the next breath, Owen, report
! ing on Civilian Defense, briefly out
j lined the still tentative plans for
| student and faculty disaster areas and
the establishment of central control
j ling nerve centers.
DO AS TOLD
"In this matter, the students arc to
;do as the Administration tells
| them," Owen commented.
Through Chairman George Jack
| son a summary report was given on
the recent B.A.C. meeting in which
it was announced that no budget can
be made out as yet due to the ques
tion mark of next year. No decrease
in Ihe coaching staff is planned un
less coaches are called to service or
volunteer. In such cases, no new
j appointments to their positions are
| planned.
(For editorial comment, see
"The Stanford Athlete.")
Strictly student was Isabelle Faw
cett's approved suggestion that,
j "since the five-man Activities Com
mittee was performing no real
i function," the Committee be dis
! banded, and in its place be appointed
I an Activities Co-ordinator to act as
a centralizing and connecting force
between committee chairmen and
Excom.
EXCOM HAS SAY
In all matters of committee ap
pointments, Excom will have the
final say. Appointment went to Isa
belle Fawcett.
Rounding out the meeting, Bar
bara Sadler told the financial suc
cess of Sunday night movies, and
Charlotte Drea was appointed staff
i officer under Harry Morgan in the
I Office of Service Information.
Other report of the evening was
by Bill Moran, who explained a
new plan to elect directors sooner
to facilitate production schedules.
"And, oh yes," threw in George
Jackson. "The lake is not open.
Swimming is not permitted as yet,
and besides it isn't healthy."

A warning by Stan Owen, chair
man of Men's Council and member
of the Defense Council, to the effect
that officials of Santa Clara County
1 may override any decisions of either
Student Councils regarding blackout
violations, momentarily held the
wavering spotlight of Excom discus
sion at the very cut-and-dried
| meeting last night.
"Council members have been dis
| cussing blackouts with ihe Admin
istration," Owen explained, "and the
J Administration has left the punish
ment of blackout violations in our
hands. And let me add that every
violation of complete co-operation
will be roughly handled.
"And always remember that Santa
Clara County officials can still go
| over our heads. They are still in
; the driver's seat."
In the next breath, Owen, report
! ing on Civilian Defense, briefly out
j lined the still tentative plans for
| student and faculty disaster areas and
the establishment of central control
j ling nerve centers.
DO AS TOLD
"In this matter, the students arc to
;do as the Administration tells
| them," Owen commented.
Through Chairman George Jack
| son a summary report was given on
the recent B.A.C. meeting in which
it was announced that no budget can
be made out as yet due to the ques
tion mark of next year. No decrease
in Ihe coaching staff is planned un
less coaches are called to service or
volunteer. In such cases, no new
j appointments to their positions are
| planned.

Strictly student was Isabelle Faw
cett's approved suggestion that,
j "since the five-man Activities Com
mittee was performing no real
i function," the Committee be dis
! banded, and in its place be appointed
I an Activities Co-ordinator to act as
a centralizing and connecting force
between committee chairmen and
Excom.
EXCOM HAS SAY
In all matters of committee ap
pointments, Excom will have the
final say. Appointment went to Isa
belle Fawcett.
Rounding out the meeting, Bar
bara Sadler told the financial suc
cess of Sunday night movies, and
Charlotte Drea was appointed staff
i officer under Harry Morgan in the
I Office of Service Information.
Other report of the evening was
by Bill Moran, who explained a
new plan to elect directors sooner
to facilitate production schedules.
"And, oh yes," threw in George
Jackson. "The lake is not open.
Swimming is not permitted as yet,
and besides it isn't healthy."
