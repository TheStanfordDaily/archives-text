RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 20 (UP).
â€”Behind-the-scenes maneuvers to
persuade Argentina and Chile to join
the other 19 American republics in a
joint severance of relations with
Axis nations were under way tonight
amid indications that the proposal
will go before the Foreign Minis
ters' Conference tomorrow for de
bate, and possibly a vote.
Authoritative spokesman declined
to go on record as to details of nego
tiations taking place with delegates
of the hold-out countries behind
closed doors, leading to a flood of
rumors and speculation as to de
mands and inducements.
