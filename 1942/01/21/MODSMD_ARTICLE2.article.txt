# Male Pride, S. Hawkins Compromise
## Manly Revolt Falls As Bids to Hillbilly Spree Pass 300 Mark 
### 
The threatened strike of Stanford
males against the Sadie Hawkins
dance crumbled down beside flic
Gallic Wars and Shay's Rebellion
into the dust of oblivion yesterday
as Farm men threw pride to the
winds (north by northeast) and
begged for dates to Saturday's jig
in the Pavilion.
The sale of bids continued to
climb rapidly past the 300 mark as
women dropped on the A.S.S.U. of
fice counter 87 pennies for them
selves, 9 for the Internal Revenue
Bureau of the United States govern
ment, and 3 for the males which they
stoop to bring.
PENNIES SOCKED AWAY
One girl carried in a blue sock
filled with 396 coppers, demanded
four bids, waited patiently while the
pennies were counted, clutched the
pasteboards in her little paws, and
walked calmly out.
This is the sort of thing that, tossed
a wrench into the well-oiled strike
machinery of Farm men who were
protesting the 3-cent-a-head value
placed upon them. Bids were dis
appearing at a record rate, but few
men were to be found who had been
blessed with an invitation.
One desperate character begged,
"Who is buying all these bids, dam
mit? Nobody's asked me." Appar
ently nobody has asked anybody.
SELLOUT IMMINENT
"If this sale continues as it has in
the past two days," authoritative and
reliable sources stated late last night,
"the bids will be sold out by Thurs
day night."
Music for the jig will be provided
by a jukebox in order to leave more
room for dancing in the Pavilion.
Costumes will be in the traditional
Dogpatch style.
