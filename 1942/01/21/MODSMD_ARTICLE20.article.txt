# 'Anna Christie' Slated for Feb. 1
## 
### 
The second movie of Barbara
Sadler's Sunday Series will be
shown February 1. It is "Anna
Christie," starring Greta Garbo. This
is the great Eugene O'Neil drama,
and the movie, made in pre-Hays
days, follows the play closely.
The success of the campus series
was established last Sunday niuhl
when "Algiers," the first picture,
played to a crowd which tripled ex
pectations.
Rounding out the bill with "Anna
Christie" will be two animated car
toons and the second chapter of
j "Buck Rogers." Showings are in
Memorial Hall at 7:15, admission 20
j cents.
