AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 19. â€”Favorite
movie seen by college students dur
ing 1941 was "Sergeant York," the
annual motion picture poll conducted
by Student Opinion Surveys of
America shows. Only slightly more
than one-seventh of the students, 14
per cent, however, could agree on
any one picture as the "best they
had seen."
At that, "Sergeant York" led in
four of the six geographical sections
of the country used in conducting the
survey. Based on a scientifically
representative cross-setcion of the
U.S. college enrollment, the survey
shows that students in the Middle
Atlantic, East Central, West Cen
tral, and Southern states chose "Ser
geant York" as their favorite picture.
The top ten shows, compiled from
the question, "What was the best
picture you have seen during 1941?"
were not necessarily released during
the last year.
In order of their selection, they
are as follows:
1. Sergeant York
2. Citizen aKne
3. One Foot in Heaven
4. Meet John Doe
o. Gone With the Wind
<5. Blossoms in the Dust
7. Honky Took
8. The Little Foxes
9. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
10. I Wanted Wings
In 1940, "Gone With the Wind"
easily ranked best of the year, polled
twice as many ballots as the second
ranking picture, "Rebecca." It is in
teresting to note that "G.W.T.W." is
still fifth among the top ten after
another year.
"Sergeant York" did not show
such a clear-cut plurality as did the
winning David Selznick production
the year before, which polled 27 per
cent, almost twice the percentage
recorded for "Sergeant York." "Citi
zen Kane," with 10 per cent nation
ally, came close to "Sergeant York's"
14 per cent.
