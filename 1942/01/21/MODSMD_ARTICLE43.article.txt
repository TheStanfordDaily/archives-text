# Card Cagers Tackle U.S.F. Dons Tonight
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford's varsity cagers will help
"Buy a Bomber" tonight.
For U.S. defense Coach Everett
Dean sends his Kedmen against
U.S.F. at 7:45 in the San Francisco
Civic Auditorium in the second
game of a triple - headed all-star
hill. California, returned from its
southern invasion after a split with
U.S.C., meets Golden State in the

Mitey Mushy Silver, 5-foot-5 and
a half feet of whirlwind basketball,
sparkplugged the Dons to victories
over two of Stanford's conference
foes, U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., and St.
Mary's.
FOUK-INCII DEFICIT
We've figured the Dons' starting
line-up will average six feet, spot
ting the Indians four inches per man.
But there's one man on the U.S.F.
squad that won't be spotted any
thing. And that's center Allen
Wells—6-foot-6 and 195 pounds.
"Big" Al, or the "Duster" as
they call him in the Don camp,
should he a BIG help to Coach
Forrest Twogood, if he doesn't hit
his head on the hackhoard. Hail
ing from Lindsay, Cal., Wells is
veddy agile for a man of his size,
and Stanford's pivot man. Ed Voss,
will he matched inch for inch and
then some.
The Indians hold two victories
over U.S.F., but according to Gene
Sullivan, sports editor of The Daily
Foghorn, U.S.F.'s newspaper, the
Dons are so fast on the floor they
"may outmanbuver the tall but slow
Indians."
CARDS FAST TOO
Wait till Gene sees Jimmy Pol
laid, Don Burness, Voss, Bill Cow
den, and Howie Dallmar in action.
If they look like a herd of turtles he
can send us a hat C.O.D.—and we'll
eat it.

at guard is Irwin "Biff" Bafigo.

and can handle equally well either
center or forward.
BUSSENIUS HIGH MAN
Perhaps the most colorful man on
the squad. Bill "Tiny"' Bussenius,
handles the other forward post.
"Tiny" was high scorer on the 1940-

In these non-conference encoun
ters, Stanford's opponents are gun
ning for "upset" victories. And
they're usually playing their best
brand of basketball when up against
non-con teams. The Indians will of
course start as pre-game favorites,
and tonight must plad heads up all
the way to make it three straight.

BERKELEY, Jan. 19 (UP).—For
ty-three men turned out for the
University of California annual
spring crew sign-up today. The
number was from 15 to 20 less than
usual, and there were only three
members of last year's varsity, which
was beaten both at the Poughkeepsie
regatta and in its annual race with
the University of Washington Hus
kies on the Oakland Estuary.
