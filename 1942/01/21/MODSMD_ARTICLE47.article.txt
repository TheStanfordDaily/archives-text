# Hammett Appears Behind the Plate
## 
### 
i Harry Wolter has a new angle on
| an old theme.
Duke Hammett, it seems, may be
| the answer to that old catching
problem that has plagued Stanford
since the days of Pop Jameson.
With Ace Hanlon and Custard
j Randall no longer available, and Jim
Pollard and Howie Dallmar both
eyeing Hammett's first base spot, Ray
may be definitely moved behind the
plate. The catching position is now
pitifully undermanned with only
Herb Atkinson and Oscar Holmes
and inexperienced, but promising,
Sophomore Ward Walkup.
Hammett was second in hitting
1 last year with an average of .306.
