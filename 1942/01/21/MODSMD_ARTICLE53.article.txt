THE Hall and Row question is something
which comes up around Stanford just about
three times a year—during rushing and at the
two A.S.S.U. elections.
During the rest of the year it lies almost dor
mant. Each half of Stanford goes on living nor
mal democratic lives, intermingling freely with
members of the other group, forgetting reasons
why, originally, they chose one or the other.
Nor is there any stereotype which can be
applied to either Row or Hall groups. Everyone
has an equal chance to get the utmost out of all
Stanford has to offer students after they move
out of their freshman dormitories.
With rushing coming to a close and formal
pledging only three weeks away, frosh, on the
whole, are pretty much impressed with the show
the fraternities are putting on for them.
Many men who will pledge on Feb. 6 have
not yet made up their minds which house they
will pledge, or whether they will pledge at all.
On Feb. 6 they will decide where they will
live for their next two or three years at Stan
ford. Many of these men will make this deci
sion without having given much thought—or
any at all—to what is offered to them if they do
not pledge.

Realizing this need, Interclub Council last
night planned to hold a smoker in Toyon lobby
a week from tomorrow to acquaint Encinamen
with hall facilities. Following this smoker all
eating clubs will hold open houses.
All frosh will receive a personal invitation to
attend this function.

The men of Encina should not go into this
question blinded—or dazzled.
They should avail themselves before formal
pledging of this opportunity to see the halls and
what they have to offer the prospective soph
or junior.
