# The 						Stanford Athlete
## 
### 
AMONG the men who have made us proud
to be Stanford men and women, and who
have helped to mould that vague thing we call
heritage, are the Stanford athletic great. They
not only have been men to be reckoned with
in intercollegiate athletics, but have carried the
Stanford name to far countries in international
and Olympic competition.
In 50 years we have haled into our athletic
Hall of Fame such immortals as Ben Eastman,
Pete Desjardins, Lawson Little, Bob Reynolds,
Clyde Jeffrey, Norm Standlee, Ernie Nevers,
Bones Hamilton, Bob King, Bobby Grayson, Bill
Miller, Hank Luisetti, Bill Corbus, Eric Krenz,
Hugh Gallarneau, Frank Albert.

It would be difficult to measure what these
men have meant to Stanford. We are proud of
the Stanford athlete—he is a quick thinker who
plays a clean game for the love of it, and to
bring glories to the Stanford Red. We support
no "athletic tramps." Quality of the Stanford
athlete is above average in sportsmanship, abil
ity, and mentality. He is keen and precise.
Because of war we are faced with possible
curtailment of athletics—the Army has ordered
that crowds at next season's football games be
limited to 10,000. If crowds continue to be lim
ited for even a few years, decreased revenue
will force the B.A.C. to cut its athletic program.
But things look good for the present. The
B.A.C. announced yesterday that no major or
minor sports will be discontinued because of
ihe war emergency, and intramural sports will
be stressed. Corners will have to be cut here
and there on the budget, but "no drastic curtail
ments of any sort" will be made.
This is the state of affairs at present, and it
is reassuring. This means the Stanford athlete
will continue to break records, attract crowds
whose money supports minor athletics and,
equally important, to build himself up for serv
ice with Uncle Sam.—Harold Shafer

ited for even a few years, decreased revenue
will force the B.A.C. to cut its athletic program.
But things look good for the present. The
B.A.C. announced yesterday that no major or
minor sports will be discontinued because of
ihe war emergency, and intramural sports will
be stressed. Corners will have to be cut here
and there on the budget, but "no drastic curtail
ments of any sort" will be made.
This is the state of affairs at present, and it
is reassuring. This means the Stanford athlete
will continue to break records, attract crowds
whose money supports minor athletics and,
equally important, to build himself up for serv
ice with Uncle Sam.—Harold Shafer
AMONG the men who have made us proud
to be Stanford men and women, and who
have helped to mould that vague thing we call
heritage, are the Stanford athletic great. They
not only have been men to be reckoned with
in intercollegiate athletics, but have carried the
Stanford name to far countries in international
and Olympic competition.
In 50 years we have haled into our athletic
Hall of Fame such immortals as Ben Eastman,
Pete Desjardins, Lawson Little, Bob Reynolds,
Clyde Jeffrey, Norm Standlee, Ernie Nevers,
Bones Hamilton, Bob King, Bobby Grayson, Bill
Miller, Hank Luisetti, Bill Corbus, Eric Krenz,
Hugh Gallarneau, Frank Albert.

It would be difficult to measure what these
men have meant to Stanford. We are proud of
the Stanford athlete—he is a quick thinker who
plays a clean game for the love of it, and to
bring glories to the Stanford Red. We support
no "athletic tramps." Quality of the Stanford
athlete is above average in sportsmanship, abil
ity, and mentality. He is keen and precise.
Because of war we are faced with possible
curtailment of athletics—the Army has ordered
that crowds at next season's football games be
limited to 10,000. If crowds continue to be lim
ited for even a few years, decreased revenue
will force the B.A.C. to cut its athletic program.
