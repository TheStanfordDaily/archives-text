# A 						Challenge . . .

In view of (he nation-wide emphasis on mental
and physical armament of college students to fill
their role in the present emergency, The Daily re
prints herewith a letter on this matter received hy
I)r. Wilhur from Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs,
U.S. Navy.

[VI Y DEAR PRESIDENT WILBUR:
It is the hope of the Navy Department that the
students of all the Universities and Colleges through
out the country will realize fully the seriousness of
the present war and the sacrifice and toil each must
make in order to fashion a total victory from it. It is
further hoped that the men of the Universities will
institute among themselves a regime of self-discipline
and conditioning in order to better complete the im
mediate job at hand dnd prepare for the greater tasks
to come. It is sincerely urged that the college officials
and faculty members will support and participate in
all such programs.
Today, not tomorrow, the youth of America must
undertake the most colossal task and assume the most
terrible responsibility of any generation in history.
This, our country, must be defended with the last
measure of our strength and the last ounce of our
wealth. Only in democracy and freedom can mankind
exist with faith in the future and confidence in the final
fruition of the valiant efforts of the past. It is our way
of life, our creed and our hope. Democracy has long
protected the rights of individuals and the sacredness
of personality. It is now the duty of each individual,
in turn, to protect and perpetuate that order which has
now being placed under desperate attack and siege by
totalitarianism. No one can avoid his part in this task,
nor retire from his responsibility of American citizen
ship.
AN ERA OF SOFT LIVING
The Nation has passed through an era of soft liv
ing and rampant individualism. Today as a result,
there is a tremendous efTort being made in all the
armed forces of the Nation to correct the results of
this long period of wasteful existence. The rejection
figures for physical defects released by the Selective
Service Commission are staggering. The armed forces
are succeeding slowly with the actual training and
mental and physical conditioning of their men. While
this is being done, other young men of the nation
should be taking time by the forelock so that the job
will be less weighty for the armed forces when they
join the ranks.
The Navy has under way a tremendous program to
make the officers and the men of the Fleet hardened
and physically fit for the fighting job confronting them.
Into every Naval training station pours a cross section
of American youth. The Navy trains them with drills,
military science and physical exercises. The Secretary
of the Navy has directed that every provision should
be taken to guarantee that American Naval Officers
and Bluejackets be second to none in physical fitness.
THE JOB AHEAD FOR STUDENTS
It appears, therefore, that the American college stu
dents, especially, should be keenly conscious of the
job in national defense that lies just ahead of them.
The nation will put its trust in these students as a
natural reservoir of leadership, and officer material.
They, therefore, should be more than anxious to main
tain themselves in the best physical condition possible.
Theirs is truly a rendezvous with destinyâ€”not in a
vague and shadowy future, but tomorrow. They are
preparing themselves mentally for the task ahead and
it would seem inconsistent if this preparedness did not
include physical and spiritual development of a similar
rigorousness, quality and quantity.
The students of all Universities have within their
grasp the opportunity to develop a plan and pattern
of self-discipline, physical fitness ,and preparedness for
eventual service in the armed forces of their country,
or as skilled and hardened workers in civilian defense
that could serve as a model and inspriation for all
Americans.

The challenge to our University men is at hand.
Will they take the initiative as natural leaders and
prepare themselves to "Fight the good fight"? For it is
only by the most strenuous and complete preparation
on the part of all that we can expect ultimate victory
for our way of life. RANDALL JACOBS
Rear Admiral, U.S.N.
