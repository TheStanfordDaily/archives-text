WATCH THE NEAR EAST
IN LOOKING at world situations and world wars it
is too easy to merely study the most powerful na
tions, to analyze the large armies, to evaluate the
strength of the big navies, and to forget about the
little peoples and countries. This is a dangerous meth
od, because you may be overlooking seemingly insig
nificant power, that may in the long run play a very
important part in the shape of things to come. In this
way it is easy to follow the armies of Germany, and
the policy of England and Japan and the United States
and all the other big powers, but I ask you, please don't
forget Armenia's part in this present world crisis.

As you may or may not have known, there is no
longer an Armenia but the people are a part of the
Soviet Union. At the beginning of the World War,
continued massacres by the Turkish peoples almost ex
terminated the entire race. Viscount Bryce, who made
an exhaustive study of these slaughters, reported that
four-fifths of the entire nation had been wiped out and
he called the atrocities "the blackest page of modern
history." But now some 25 years later there still re
main some Armenians. I would say that there are
about a million Armenians scattered around in those
hills somewhere. The Turks weren't successful in
cleaning the race off the earth, for Armenians are still
growing up, all over the world, and they are working
and may play a vital part in this war.

pOR I received a letter from my boy Arshag, who
sells my pencils in the little town of Tiflis. And
Tiflis is a very good spot for selling pencils because it
isn't far from Erivan, and from Erivan you can see
right into Turkey by sitting on the roof of your house.
As you have probably already guessed, we are not in
the pencil business at all. Anyway, Arshag tells me
that the Armenian morale is holding up surprisingly
well. The people seem to be getting stronger and
blacker, and have no ideas at all of perishing from the
earth. He questioned a few of them and they all
seemed to think that they would be around for some
time to come. And they have not been caught short
in this present crisis. Arshag reports that they now
have 27 trained camels and riders, five long-range
rifles, twelve revolvers, and innumerable knives. And
he says they have not forgotten the massacres and will
be ready to move into action at the first opportunity.

The present plan seems to be tf> surprise Constanti
nople by sending the Camel men across the desert at
night. With a little luck most of them feel that they
can take the city and close the Bosporus by morning,
and that will be the start of the revenge. Of course
the plan is a dangerous one, and they are liable 1o lose
some lives, but they are willing to take the chance.
All these plans, Arshag assures me, are not definite and
are subject to change at any time.

And so you see, there are many factors that the less
experienced observer is likely to miss if he doesn't
watch carefully. Armenia is armed to its teeth, and it
remembers the atrocities that were inflicted on it,
atrocities which the world tolerated, and so in the bi >4
shuffle that is likely to come, you may se<- the Republic
of Armenia as the top power in the Near East.

atrocities which the world tolerated, and so in the bi >4

of Armenia as the top power in the Near East.
WATCH THE NEAR EAST
IN LOOKING at world situations and world wars it
is too easy to merely study the most powerful na
tions, to analyze the large armies, to evaluate the
strength of the big navies, and to forget about the
little peoples and countries. This is a dangerous meth
od, because you may be overlooking seemingly insig
nificant power, that may in the long run play a very
important part in the shape of things to come. In this
way it is easy to follow the armies of Germany, and
the policy of England and Japan and the United States
and all the other big powers, but I ask you, please don't
forget Armenia's part in this present world crisis.

As you may or may not have known, there is no
longer an Armenia but the people are a part of the
Soviet Union. At the beginning of the World War,
continued massacres by the Turkish peoples almost ex
terminated the entire race. Viscount Bryce, who made
an exhaustive study of these slaughters, reported that
four-fifths of the entire nation had been wiped out and
he called the atrocities "the blackest page of modern
history." But now some 25 years later there still re
main some Armenians. I would say that there are
about a million Armenians scattered around in those
hills somewhere. The Turks weren't successful in
cleaning the race off the earth, for Armenians are still
growing up, all over the world, and they are working
and may play a vital part in this war.

pOR I received a letter from my boy Arshag, who
sells my pencils in the little town of Tiflis. And
Tiflis is a very good spot for selling pencils because it
isn't far from Erivan, and from Erivan you can see
right into Turkey by sitting on the roof of your house.
As you have probably already guessed, we are not in
the pencil business at all. Anyway, Arshag tells me
that the Armenian morale is holding up surprisingly
well. The people seem to be getting stronger and
blacker, and have no ideas at all of perishing from the
earth. He questioned a few of them and they all
seemed to think that they would be around for some
time to come. And they have not been caught short
in this present crisis. Arshag reports that they now
have 27 trained camels and riders, five long-range
rifles, twelve revolvers, and innumerable knives. And
he says they have not forgotten the massacres and will
be ready to move into action at the first opportunity.

The present plan seems to be tf> surprise Constanti
nople by sending the Camel men across the desert at
night. With a little luck most of them feel that they
can take the city and close the Bosporus by morning,
and that will be the start of the revenge. Of course
the plan is a dangerous one, and they are liable 1o lose
some lives, but they are willing to take the chance.
All these plans, Arshag assures me, are not definite and
are subject to change at any time.

And so you see, there are many factors that the less
experienced observer is likely to miss if he doesn't
watch carefully. Armenia is armed to its teeth, and it
remembers the atrocities that were inflicted on it,
atrocities which the world tolerated, and so in the bi >4
