# CAMPUS OPINION
## LI'L ABNER KICKS

r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
What about the Sadie Hawkins
I lop? What about it! Just that out
of about 25 fellows I've talked to,
not a damn one has been asked to go
to it with a Stanford Scragg. We
offer our cars, our bodies, our hope
fully anxious hearts to any woman
who might, however remotely, be
toying with the idea of spending a
meager 99 cents on us as a slight
token of her appreciation for all the
alcohol, gasoline, and Union cokes
we have wasted on her. The only
thing spectacular about the results
is that there are none! Isn't the Stan
ford Man ever to be given the doubt
ful victory of being asked some
where by the Stanford Woman? Will
all of Cheslie Saroyan's crusading go
for naught? Will only the patrons
and patronesses show up this Sat
urday night? I hope not. May I
make one last request in this colyum
before the draft board gets me under
its heavy thumb? The next time
you exalted campus queens head
out the door for your 8 o'clocks, will
you please take a good look at your
selves in a full-length plateglass
mirror? Then maybe you will un
derstand why I think our(?) women
over exert their superiority com
plexes.
Desolately,

ful victory of being asked some
where by the Stanford Woman? Will
all of Cheslie Saroyan's crusading go
for naught? Will only the patrons
and patronesses show up this Sat
urday night? I hope not. May I
make one last request in this colyum
before the draft board gets me under
its heavy thumb? The next time
you exalted campus queens head
out the door for your 8 o'clocks, will
you please take a good look at your
selves in a full-length plateglass
mirror? Then maybe you will un
derstand why I think our(?) women
over exert their superiority com
plexes.
Desolately,
Mud worm Zeke
