### AMIE REICHERT 
JF YOU have been following the
scraps of information that come
each day from inside Hitler's Eu
rope, you will undoubtedly have
noticed thai generals arc
dying like flies these days—and from
all sorts of queer, non-military ail
ments.
It is apparent now that since
Der Fuehrer took command, al
most all of his more important
brass hat friends have either re
signed, or become suddenly very
ill. (Shades of the Rhoem, Strasscr
ct al purge.)
The other day Berlin radio re
ported that Field Marshall Walt her
von Brauchitsch, who used to be
commander -in - chief of the Nazi
Army, until Hitler removed him,
Dec. 19, had undergone a very se
rious operation which would keep
him laid up "for a long time."
It has been rumored—and with
considerable authority — that von
Brauchitsch was asked to step down
because he opposed Hitler's third
Moscow offensive this winter, which
is currently in its death agony.
* * H.
WEVERAL other German generals
K "' have suddenly developed mala
dies, too. Field Marshall von Reich
cnau died last Saturday of—it is
said—apoplexy. He was to Ger
many what Bernarr McFadden is to
this country. The New York Times
reported that troops and civilians
were "deeply impressed" at the news
of the death of this famous health
addict at the age of 57.
Then there is Marshall von List,
the iron conqueror of the Balkans,
who was reported recovering
from an appendicitis operation in
Salonika the other day.
And another anonymous general,
Berlin reports, has a lung inflama
tion.
And von Kcitel, chief of the
High Command, is said to be un
der the weather. And the three
original leaders of the Russian
campaign, von Rudstedt, von Bock,
and von Lcch.
And General Guderian, the tank
expert who was defeated by the Rus
sians at Tula. And General Haider
and General Kliest who butched in
Rostov.
* * *
A L „ L these men, the cream of the
Prussian military caste, have
been, to put it euphemistically, re
lieved of their commands because, as
the German radio pathetically and
self-consciously explained, these
generals are sick because they "not
only have to bear the physical strain
like their soldiers, but also the re
sponsibility for the fate of their men
and for the outcome of the fighting."
Tch, tch.
These poor men probably had
their heads cracked open l>.v Der
Fuehrer's SS boys in a most un
dignified manner, and it is a shame,
since most of them were good sol
diers and brave generals, that they
could not have been defeated by
the Russians on the march and
died on battlefields where they
belong instead of in their beds or
in concentration camps or at their
dinner tables—or however the
Gestapo chose to liquidate them.
Loss of men like Brauchitsch,
Rundstedt, Bock, Licb, Kcitel—all
of them brilliant military strategists
and specialists—is nothing but clear
profit, of coursc, to the Allies. In
cidentally, it greatly strengthens the
case of those people who have been
saying all along—and especially in
the last few months—that Der Fueh
rer has gone completely mad.
We have seen in the last few
weeks what Commander Hitler
can do when he's all alone—and
the results are even more spec
tacular than anyone, even A('/»lf
Himself, ever imagined they would
be. The German Army has really
been moving since Hitler stepped
in there.
* * *
now, today comes the news
of an apparently legitimate ill
ness—a wholesale one at that, which
is spreading behind the crumbling
German lines in Russia and taking a
dreadful toll. Typhus, the terrible
war-borne scourge which a genera
tion ago killed 8 million Europeans,
has apparently struck the Germans
with a vengeance.

now, today comes the news
of an apparently legitimate ill
ness—a wholesale one at that, which
is spreading behind the crumbling
German lines in Russia and taking a
dreadful toll. Typhus, the terrible
war-borne scourge which a genera
tion ago killed 8 million Europeans,
has apparently struck the Germans
with a vengeance.
JF YOU have been following the
scraps of information that come
each day from inside Hitler's Eu
rope, you will undoubtedly have
noticed thai generals arc
dying like flies these days—and from
all sorts of queer, non-military ail
ments.
It is apparent now that since
Der Fuehrer took command, al
most all of his more important
brass hat friends have either re
signed, or become suddenly very
ill. (Shades of the Rhoem, Strasscr
ct al purge.)
The other day Berlin radio re
ported that Field Marshall Walt her
von Brauchitsch, who used to be
commander -in - chief of the Nazi
Army, until Hitler removed him,
Dec. 19, had undergone a very se
rious operation which would keep
him laid up "for a long time."
It has been rumored—and with
considerable authority — that von
Brauchitsch was asked to step down
because he opposed Hitler's third
Moscow offensive this winter, which
is currently in its death agony.

this country. The New York Times
reported that troops and civilians
were "deeply impressed" at the news
of the death of this famous health
addict at the age of 57.
Then there is Marshall von List,
the iron conqueror of the Balkans,
who was reported recovering
from an appendicitis operation in
Salonika the other day.

* * *
A L „ L these men, the cream of the
Prussian military caste, have
been, to put it euphemistically, re
lieved of their commands because, as
the German radio pathetically and

generals are sick because they "not

the Russians on the march and
died on battlefields where they
belong instead of in their beds or
in concentration camps or at their
dinner tables—or however the
Gestapo chose to liquidate them.
Loss of men like Brauchitsch,
Rundstedt, Bock, Licb, Kcitel—all
of them brilliant military strategists
and specialists—is nothing but clear
profit, of coursc, to the Allies. In

rer has gone completely mad.
We have seen in the last few
weeks what Commander Hitler
can do when he's all alone—and
the results are even more spec
tacular than anyone, even A('/»lf
Himself, ever imagined they would
be. The German Army has really
been moving since Hitler stepped
in there.
* * *
now, today comes the news
of an apparently legitimate ill
ness—a wholesale one at that, which
is spreading behind the crumbling
German lines in Russia and taking a
dreadful toll. Typhus, the terrible
war-borne scourge which a genera
tion ago killed 8 million Europeans,
has apparently struck the Germans
with a vengeance.
JF YOU have been following the
scraps of information that come
each day from inside Hitler's Eu
rope, you will undoubtedly have
noticed thai generals arc
dying like flies these days—and from
all sorts of queer, non-military ail
ments.
It is apparent now that since
Der Fuehrer took command, al
most all of his more important
brass hat friends have either re
signed, or become suddenly very
ill. (Shades of the Rhoem, Strasscr
ct al purge.)
The other day Berlin radio re
ported that Field Marshall Walt her
von Brauchitsch, who used to be
commander -in - chief of the Nazi
Army, until Hitler removed him,
Dec. 19, had undergone a very se
rious operation which would keep
him laid up "for a long time."
It has been rumored—and with
considerable authority — that von
Brauchitsch was asked to step down
because he opposed Hitler's third
Moscow offensive this winter, which
is currently in its death agony.
* * H.
WEVERAL other German generals
K "' have suddenly developed mala
dies, too. Field Marshall von Reich
cnau died last Saturday of—it is
said—apoplexy. He was to Ger
many what Bernarr McFadden is to
this country. The New York Times
reported that troops and civilians
were "deeply impressed" at the news
of the death of this famous health
addict at the age of 57.
Then there is Marshall von List,
the iron conqueror of the Balkans,
who was reported recovering
from an appendicitis operation in
Salonika the other day.
And another anonymous general,
Berlin reports, has a lung inflama
tion.
And von Kcitel, chief of the
High Command, is said to be un
der the weather. And the three
original leaders of the Russian
campaign, von Rudstedt, von Bock,
and von Lcch.
And General Guderian, the tank
expert who was defeated by the Rus
sians at Tula. And General Haider
and General Kliest who butched in
Rostov.
* * *
A L „ L these men, the cream of the
Prussian military caste, have
been, to put it euphemistically, re
lieved of their commands because, as
the German radio pathetically and
self-consciously explained, these
generals are sick because they "not
only have to bear the physical strain
like their soldiers, but also the re
sponsibility for the fate of their men
and for the outcome of the fighting."
Tch, tch.
These poor men probably had
their heads cracked open l>.v Der
Fuehrer's SS boys in a most un
dignified manner, and it is a shame,
since most of them were good sol
diers and brave generals, that they
could not have been defeated by
the Russians on the march and
died on battlefields where they
belong instead of in their beds or
in concentration camps or at their
dinner tables—or however the
Gestapo chose to liquidate them.
Loss of men like Brauchitsch,
Rundstedt, Bock, Licb, Kcitel—all
of them brilliant military strategists
and specialists—is nothing but clear
profit, of coursc, to the Allies. In
cidentally, it greatly strengthens the
case of those people who have been
saying all along—and especially in
the last few months—that Der Fueh
rer has gone completely mad.
