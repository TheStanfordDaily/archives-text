Any college junior or senior is
eligible for the V-7 plan if he has
had three quarters of college mathe
matics, or is at present enrolled in
a college mathematics course. If
the applicant, can pass the physical
examination, he will be sworn in as
an apprentice seaman and allowed to
complete his college work before re
ceiving a four months' training
course. At the completion of this
training course, he will be commis
sioned as an ensign and will go into
active duty, either as a line or engi
neering officer, aboard ship.
Applicants for the V-7 plan may
secure application blanks at Room
558 in the Federal Building in San
Francisco.

graduated in June, 1942. If they will
not be graduated until June, 1943,
they may file a probationary appli

duty when commissioned.
Students who have had geology,
mathematics, or" an engineering
background may apply for the navy's
A.V.S. program. Those who are ac
