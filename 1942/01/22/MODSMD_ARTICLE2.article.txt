# Row Board to Investigate 'Illegal Rushing' Rumors, Meeting Called Tonight
## Haugh Summons Interfraternity Board at Phi Dell House to Air Possible Guilt Involving 7 Houses 
### 
Rumors charging illegal rushing against the names of almost one-third
of Stanford's 24 fraternities were reported yesterday and last night, bring
ing the total number under suspicion to seven and resulting in the calling
of a special Intcrfraternity Board of Control dinner meeting at the Phi
Delt house for 6 o'clock tonight.
Specific complaints will l>e heard and considered at this evening's

meeting, hastily called last night by
Jim Haugh, Intcrfraternity presi
dent, to investigate the rumors and
"take whatever action is necessary."
UNOFFICIAL COMPLAINTS
Unofficial complaints against these
houses charge illegal off-campus
rush parties, attended in possibly
one case by members of a house in
company with rushees and unofficial
pledges, and restricted in other in
stances to just rushees and unoffi
cial pledges. (Formal pledging is
scheduled for Feb. 6.)
"The meeting is being held to
clear the air," Haugh said last night.
He would make no further comment
previous to tonight's investigation.
OFF-CAMPUS PARTIES
Off-campus rushing parties had
been scheduled and then called off
by several houses last week-end, it
was reported reliably by a student
official last night, who is expected
to file at least one complaint for con
sideration at tonight's meeting of
the Board.
Haugh was reported in Monday's
Daily as saying that, although no
punitive precedent exists for off
campus parties among rushees and
unofficial pledges, probable penalty
would be withdrawal of rushing and
pledging privileges this year for the
house involved. Rushees present at
such a party would probably lose
their pledging privileges, according
to this statement.
LAST HOUSE FINED
Last campus fraternity to be con
victed for illegal rushing was the
Chi Psi house, given an immediate
fine on Nov. 4, 1941, of $25 and a
suspended sentence amounting to
jeopardization of rushing privileges
in case of further infractions.
At that time the Board went on
record as stating any infraction of
any nature "will from now on be
dealt with severely."
BOARD TO ATTEND
Haugh said last night only mem
bers of the Board will attend to
night's session, and added that com
plaints may be filed with any mem
ber of the Board previous to the
meeting.
Members, besides Haugh, arc Jim
"Pepper" Sargeant, Intcrfraternity
secretary; Dean of Men John Bunn,
Professors Harold M. Bacon and El
mer D. Fagan, Mr. Harold L. An
derson, Mr. Charles J. Crary, Gene
