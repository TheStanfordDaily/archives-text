# Raid Defense Explained In War Movies
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
About eight hundred people from
Stanford and environs arc a little
grimmer about the reality of World
War II today; they know the kind
of raids that could come to the Pa
cific Coast and they also know what
to do about it.
Last night in a series of motion
pictures dealing with the defense
problems faced in air raids, land in
vasions, and refugee evacuation, the
Stanford Civilian Defense Council
tried to bring home to the Farm ex
actly the type of thing that could
happen here. All of the pictures
were filmed under actual wartime
conditions in Great Britain. They
were shown at the Memorial The
ater in a scries of continuous one
hour shows from 4 until 10 o'clock
last night.
'STOP THAT FIRE'
Perhaps the most striking of the
pictures was "Stop That Fire," a
graphic survey of the problem of
incendiary bombs and the equipment
needed in every home to prepare for
such an emergency. Shots of the
great London fire-blitz of last De
cember 1940 showed the audience
the methods of fire prevention work.
Sand bags, stirrup pumps, reporting
systems —all the details were cov
ered in the story of a great victory
over incendiary attack.
"Coastal Defense," a study of Brit
ain's preparations to meet invasion
from land, sea, and air, provided
instructions for civilian spotters,
home guard squads, and first aid
squads. "Woman in the War" dem
onstrated the myriad of tasks ac
cepted by British women in the war
crisis from factory to farm.
THE STRAIGHT STUFF
Despite some attempts at comedy
dialogue, the serious work of the
police force in time* of emergency
was made clear in the film "War
and Order," which presented the
system of reporting bombardments
and handling casualties in an air
raid. The final reel, "Wartime Fac
tory," illustrated much the same
type of defense factory set-up which
is being used in American plants
today, complete with recreational
facilities, graveyard shifts, etc.
The films, said to be the finest of
the type available to civilian de
fense training committees, were ob
tained for the Stanford audience
through the efforts of Professor
James Wells of Stanford's School of
Engineering. Stan Owen was in
charge of the arrangements.
In addition to the films, members
of the audience were given leaflets
of instructions entitled "Bombs —
What to Do and When to Do It."
And they were written in San Fran
cisco—not London!
