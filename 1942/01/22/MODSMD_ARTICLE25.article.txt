# JAPS INCHING TOWARD SINGAPORE
## 
### 
SINGAPORE, Jan. 21 (UP). --
British defenders destroyed 13 Japa
nese bombers during a heavy raid on
Singapore today and inflicted tre
mendous casualties on the invasion
hordes edging ever closer to this
city along a battle line now assum
ing an arc shape some 50 miles to
the north. The situation in the Batu
Pahat zone 60 miles northwest of
Singapore admittedly was "ex
tremely critical."
