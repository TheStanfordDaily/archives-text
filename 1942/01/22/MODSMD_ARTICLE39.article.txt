# Cal Cagers Are Big, But We're Bigger

U.S.F.'s speedy pursuit ships
(Mushy Silver and Jim Porter)
chased Stanford's skyscraping bomb
ers around the Civic Aud floor so
fast Tuesday that the Redskin side
o! the cage picture is dotted with
gaps to be filled before tomorrow's
PCC opener with California,
Seems as if these short guys (Sil
ver is 5-feet-5) are just as potent
ii not more, than those of the Eiffel
Tower type, such as the Indians
have—averaging (i-feet-(>.
However, Tuesdays near-Water
loo can't slop the Deanmen, for the
Golden Bear will average ti-feet-2,
two inches shy of Stanford's 6-4.
lIEIOHT EVEN
So the height is fairly evenly di
vided, but Cal's pivot man will top
anything seen in the Pavilion in a
long time Bill (awfulfreshMc)Far
ley— 6-teel-7V2\
Farley didn't play much basket
ball before entering Cal, hut he
lias found the game very inter
esting lately, and Coach Nibs Price
of the Bears has found that Far
ley makes a very interesting com
bination with Merv Lafaille, Roy
Tamm, Bob Alameida, and Bob
Biles. With Farley operating as a
postman, Price will be able to use
the other men to a better advan
tage.
The four last named are quick,
sharpshooting players who work
best with the fakes, reverses and i
screens which a good center can set |
up.
BEARS SPLIT
California opened their part of the
season with a split against U.S.C.
last week-end. In the first game the
Trojans put on a terrific shooting
display and knocked off the Bears,
58-4(i. Alameida was high scorer that
night with 13.
Came Saturday and the Bears
were trailing, 18-22, at the half.
They came back strong and pulled
away in the last four minutes to
win, 41-3(5. Lafaille was hot and
rang up 12. while Bob Ormsby of
U.S.C. and Tamm each garnered
11.
Not many persons figured Cal to
ever come near the Trojans after
the licking they took Friday and
subsequent losses to comparatively
dinky teams of the San Diego State
type.
CAL READY
And therefore not many will give
the Bears a chance against Stanford
tomorrow, but don't count it in the
bag until the gun barks. Though no
repercussion of the Big Game turn
about is expected, just guesstimate I
that Cal will be ready to go after!
licking Troy.
Tuesday's encounter with Gold
en State brought forth the Bear
second-stringers until the last
when Biles and Lafaille went in.
But neither could stop the milk
men in the few seconds that re
mained.
After the Redskins shaded U.S.F.
the book showed scoring pretty well
spread out. Howie Dallrnar had 9,
Bill Cowden and Don Burness 6,
Jim Pollard and Ed Voss 4, and Jack
Dana and Freddie Linari 2.
Strangely enough the Indians
usually powerful rebound .game
stubbed its toe even though they
had four inches on the Dons.
