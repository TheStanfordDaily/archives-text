# Take Off Them Shoes, Brother
## Dogpatch Dancers To Conserve Floor 
### 
If a little man squints oddly at
you when you enter the Sadie
Hawkins dance in the Pavilion Sat
urday night, he isn't from the FBI.
But if he asks you to take off your
shoes, brother, take 'em off.
He is a committee of one to keep
people with hard-soled shoes and
hob-nailed boots out of the Pavilion.
NO HARD SHOES
"Five hundred dollars has just
been spent in fixing up the Pavilion
floor," announced Dodie Dolan,
dance chairman, "and hard shoes
would wreck it. Anyone wearing
hard-soled shoes will not be allowed
in the dance."
Tennis and rubber-soled shoes
were suggested as proper footwear.
A perusal of University rules, by
laws, and ultimatums revealed no
regulation against Stanford students
dancing in their bare feet.
An amazing skit entitled "Can
Sadie Be a Lady? or What Do You
Want for 99c, Body Grable? or Sure
I'll Take Her, or Give Me a Puff Oft
That Before You Know It Away"
will be presented at the dance to
which the women arc dragging the
men in traditional Dogpatch style by
Bud Abbott, Brownlee Corrin, and
Joe Young.
SONGS BY BOUCHARD
Also slated on the intermission
program are songs by Bob Breck
ner, Patty Bouchard, and the Kites
and Keys, all from the 1941 Gaieties.
A change in musical plans replaces
the scheduled juke box with a rec
ord player, permitting a greater rec
ord variety. Apple cider, doughnuts,
and apples will be on sale at the
dance. Tickets are on sale at the
A.S.S.U. officc.
