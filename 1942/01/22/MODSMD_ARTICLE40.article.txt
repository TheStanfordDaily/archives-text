the reputation of the house's number
one team by taking the tilt, 4G-8.
Bill Nourse was high-point man
with 12 counts.
In tonight's games the El Capitan
tangle with the Phi Psis looks like a
good contest with the Phi Psis a defi
nite favorite to repeat last year's
championship, and with El Capitan
promising to offer good competition
after a win in their first game last
week.
The S.A.E. vs. Theta Delt game
may be the surprise of the night.
The S.A.E. squad made an excellent
showing their first game, and a re
peat tonight would establish them
as leaders in their league.
