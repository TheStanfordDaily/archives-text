# Galileo Five To Play Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
Galileo High School, the mother
of Hank Luisetti, comes to the Farm
where sonny made good Friday night
| to tangle with the Stanford fresh
man tossers in a preliminary to the
Cal-Card game.
Since the days when Stanford's
greatest hoop star played for the
Lion squad, Galileo fortunes have
been very dim. They haven't even
come within boasting distance of
the prep title that Luisetti handed
them in 1933 and 1934. But after the
beginning of another just average
season—they were dropped by Poly
37 to 16—the Lions may be capable
of showing Stanford a hard time, if
only to make the ghost of the most
; humorous of the "Laughing Boys"
I remembered.
DALLEY MAIN COG
Their effort to do the job will be
; built around forward Ed Dalley, 6-
I feet-5 of lanky ball player that at
least looks something like the caliber
Galileo player of old. Beside Dalley
in the other forward spot the prep
sters can call upon Jack Coppage and
Gordon Jones, these three being the
only three veterans returning to the
Lion's den. Other possibilities at
forward are Carlos Garcia and Coye
O'Neil. Dalley may also be used at
center.
Pete Bourdoures, football tackle of
some note, and Pete Lum fit into the
picture at guard, accompanied by
Louis Pacente and Harold Petracchi.
Last night the Galileans tangled
with George Washington High in
! their second prep league tilt, the
j outcome unknown at press time. But
[ the unimpressive showing they
1 made against Poly, their short size,
and a seemingly lethargic quality
about their play thus far would
mark the Stanfords as favorites
Friday.
lIEALD RETURNS
Jack Heald returned briefly to
practice last night, his knee still
stiff and cumbersome. Coach
Bengtson is trying to make the fast
break offense of the Encinamen
something akin to second nature,
ar not a now-we-have-it-and-now
we-don't affair.
After the Lion hunt, the frosh
have a week's rest before a January
30 tilt with Menlo J. C. The next
night they play a double-header
against Paly High and Lowell High.
