### H. D. THOREAU Assistant Sports Editor 
r pHE Stanford Daily's eastern sports correspondent sends word out that
in this week's release from New York of the national college basket
ball rankings, the Long Indians are esconeed in 19th place. Number one
aggregation is Colorado followed by Rice, Toledo, and Duquesne. Wash
ington, the Coast's highest team, is in sixth position.
Every time I try to imagine Toledo's killer-diller outfit running
over Stanford's team —well, you try imagining it and see what hap
pens. In looking over the list a very coincidental coincident came to
mind. All of the lirst ten teams either are from New York or played
in the Madison Square Garden during the holiday season. Colorado,
the number one team, looked very good in beating St. Johns in the
Garden right after Christmas and since Greeley Teachers or Colo
rado Mines haven't managed to knock them oIT since, the "experts"
rate them as the best in the country.
Washington's Huskies set a new scoring record in overpowering N.Y.U.
back there, but in the last week they have bowed before both Oregon
and Oregon State. Now the point I'm making is that since the Card
quintet got no farther east than the east side of McKinley Street in
Phoenix, Arizona, this year, that automatically disqualifies them from get
ting ranked any higher than fifteenth according to Metropolitan New
i Yorkers.
No matter how badly we beat U.S.C., Cal, U.C.L.A., and even Wash
ington or 0.5.C., or whoever the northern champ will be, Stanford
will have to wait until it mops up on Colorado and Rice in the Western
Division N.C.A.A. tourney and Purdue in the national finals before
the team gets its just acclaim from the East.
Ah well, that's what comes of living in the Golden West. I hear that
most of the citizenry of Boston aren't the least worried about ihe Japanese
J since these bluebloods figure the Japs will never get by the Indians and
bandits on the western plains. Errol Flynn has done il in his last three
j movies. Maybe the Japanese can too.

of the freshman rule in the Pacific Coast conference cer
" tainly would strengthen Stanford's swimming team, if not all the other
squads. In the recent interclass meet every event not won by the Encina
men was a big upset. The sophs took a good second, aided by some
potent transfers. Even with those big rubber webbed feet which they
were given as handicaps, the men of '42 and '43 did well to garner a
single point.
Otto Jaretz, a mountain of muscle from Chicago who can get from
one end of 100 yards of water to the other faster than any other man,
woman, or child, is now enrolled at the University of Southern Cali
fornia, and doing quite well at last report. Until the present affair
in the Pacific broke ou< Rill Smith. Jr.. and several more stars from
the something-or-other Community House in the Islands were also
going to take up their studies at U.S.C. upon completion of their high
school course.
With opposition like that coming up, maybe the biology department
can cook up something with fins and webfeet that can pass the aptitude
test and throw a water bag.

jpOR YEARS now I've been loking for a comprehensive but short guide
to playing badminton. Always in the past it has taken whole books to
explain the intricacies of the game. Yesterday I found the solution in
the Mills College Weekly. In five short rules they summed up the whole
game. To all you budding Dave Freemans I hereby reprint four of the
most salient rules:
1. Sign on blanks which are in each hall and begin to play now.
(Editor's note.—lf you don't own a hall, you can rent one cheap.)
2. Look for your name on the ladder. (Ed. note—lt's over at the
Corp Yard.)
3. One practice includes at least one-half hour of playing. (Ed
note—Don't overdo it.)
4. Re sure and sign up for practices and put them in the box in
the hall. (Ed note—After a half hour's work, don't just put it any
old place.)
If you don't know how to play badminton by now, it isn't my fault.

JJURING the entire game Tuesday night between the Dons and Cards,
Jim Pollard and Ed Voss couldn't perform up to their usual standard
since they had to keep their legs together and their arms down to keep
Mushy Silver from running under them. Silver, when standing up straight,
looked like one of Singer's midgets even next to Fred Linari, or am I
exaggerating again.
The crowd was robbed of its usual cheer or groan at the end of the
game when, after U.S.F. had crept to within four points of Stanford's
lead, a horn blew which sounded like a substitution until the players
walked off the court. Only then did the crowd realize that the play was
over even though no shot had been fired.
