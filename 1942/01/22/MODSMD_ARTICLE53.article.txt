# Rushing Legal and Illegal

### 
"Abuse of the rushing rules does create
unhealthy inequality.
"This year the Interfraternity Council
(composed of the presidents of Stanford fra
ternitiesA resolved to alleviate this condition.
Consequently this body not only approved
of the rushing rules, but also determined to
give them strength by recommending strict
enforcement. The Interfraternity Board of
Control acting on this recommendation de
cided to take immediate and effective action
on any rushing rules violations brought to its
attention.
". . . Fraternity men were unanimously in
favor of this program (deferred rushing) and
all agreed if it was to be a success the rules
must be adhered to. Consequently it is diffi
cult to understand why there should be any
infractions. If there are any, however, the
Board stands ready to penalize the infracting
house and penalize it severely."
These words are excerpts from a public state
ment made last quarter by the Interfraternity
president and Board rushing chairman following
penalty of a house for infraction of rushing
rules.
The air has been thick with rumors these last
few days, rumors of off-campus rushing. Many
of these rumors have been proved false. Some
have not.
The first rule on the 1941-42 rushing rules
list states that "there shall be no off-campus
rushing."
This was one of the rules set down and ap
proved by Interfraternity Council. This coun
cil of house presidents recommended that the
Board enforce this rule strictly.
Maybe this was forgotten when last week
end rolled around and possibly seven houses
planned and prepared for illegal off-campus
rushing parties. Houses were rented, refresh
ments were already purchased in some cases.
All these preparations could hardly have been
made without the knowledge of the house
president who had agreed to the rule that there
should be no off-campus rushing.
It has been definitely proved that, in most
cases, these parties were hastily called off. The
word had gotten around that the rule might be
enforced.
Needless to say, the Board cannot exact pen
alties for something which did not happen. But
it does not speak very well for the fraternities'
ability to abide by their own rules when invi
tations had already been sent to the frosh.
Violations other than the big parties have
also been rumored. The rules permit informal
contact between fraternity men and rushees
provided there are no groups of more than
eight men; that there are not more than four fra
ternity men to one rushee; that rushees do not
enter the fraternity house other than in regular
rush periods; that no meetings be held in Quad
buildings, private or campus residences; and
that they do not go off the campus.
The above conditions apply to all the noc
turnal rendezvous between members and rush
ees, the late dates to meet by the Pavilion or
the tennis courts, cars parked all around Encina
waiting for their cargo of rushees.
This is all informal contact and is sanctioned
under the rules, provided all those conditions
are fulfilled.
It is doubtful whether they are all being ful
filled in all rases, particularly the "off-campus"

restriction. That is the one most cramping to
effective rushing.
So when Interfraternity Board meets tonight,
it will have a thorny problem to deal with. Defi
nite charge will undoubtedly be made against
one house for holding an off-campus party.
The Board will probably take definite action
in this case.
Other violations or suspected violations will
probably go unchallenged since no formal com
plaint would normally be leveled by a man
against his own house. Nor would a rushee
lodge a complaint for something in which he
was implicated since he would probably lose
his pledging privilege.
Consequently, the Board will not be able to
act in these other cases.
