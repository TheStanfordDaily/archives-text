T lEUTENANT COMMANDER AROFF last
J—i night brought home to an audience of Stan
ford men the fact that there is a definite place
for the college man in the rapidly expanding
armed forces of the United States.
The main topic of discussion last night was
the Navy, but the Marines and the Army offer
similar opportunities.
College men, however, have often become
discouraged by the seeming maze of red tape
necessary to find out about all the various
branches of the service which are open to them.
The A.S.S.U.'s re-titled Office of Service In
formation under Harry Morgan is doing every
thing possible to remedy this situation. The
office is now armed to the teeth with informa
tion and for the past week has been supplying
Stanford men with valuable service data.
Stanford men are urged to take full advantage
of this service and make every effort to find
the spot where they will be most useful.
This A.S.S.U. committee, in addition to keep
ing supplied with latest information, will spon
sor more talks throughout the year by men in
the services outlining all available openings.
You can help yourself and help your country
by keeping posted through the Office of Service
Information, Room 13, Old Union.
