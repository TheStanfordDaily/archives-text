### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
THE 'SPIRIT' OF HOLLYWOOD
Stanford men have suddenly crashed the movie
industry, a field that Stanford people don't usually
fall into. Frankie Albert is to be the star of a picture
called "The Spirit of Stanford," and Harry Muheim,
who graduated last year, has been hired as a technical
expert of some sort. It will not be a new thing for
Frankie to be starred, because he has in his last two
years on the football team, and I am also certain that
Muheim can give them some technical advice on the
spirit that floats around the school. The experiment
should be interesting for both boys.
When it was first announced that Frankie was go
ing to make a picture, there were groans and stories
saying that the picture wouldn't be any good, that
they wouldn't give him a good part, and that he would
be made to look silly, like Harmon and Luisetti in
their pictures. There is very little doubt that the pic
ture will be a bad one even with Frankie's charming
personality. There is very little chance that Frankie
will be a natural-born actor, who needs no lessons or
years of study, and is able to become a success over
night. It can happen, and there is no better chance for
it to happen anywhere than in Hollywood. Miracles
happen very easily in that city, and untutored geniuses
like Gene Tierney, Lana Turner and John Payne are
liable to spring up at any time. But the chances aren't
very great that Frankie will make an artistic success.

that doesn't matter. Frankie isn't going clown
there as an actor. He is going down there as a
young man who has a chance to make some money by
working. And no one can blame him for that. As
some said the other day, "Hollywood is more com
mercial than the Department of Commerce." Every
one in Hollywood is doing exactly what Frank is do
ing. They are in Hollywood to make money. To pile
it up high, so that they can eat at Ciro's every night
if they want to. They don't care what kind of movies
they turn out as long as they will make money. Draw
customers. Fill the theaters. Give them what they
want. Give them anything. Just make money. That's
the way Hollywood works. Few of them are con
cerned with the artistic side of their work. They have
no such conscience. But they act like they are actors
and artists and creative people, and it is for this that
they are to be despised. No one cares if people go into
business and make money, just as long as they say
they are doing that. But to go into a business and
make money, and call it art without having any
artistic conscience is too much.
Frankie will not be such a hypocrite. He will not
go in there as an actor. He will be going in there for
the money that he can get out of it, to help him with
his future. He will not be judged by the excellence of
the film or by his acting, but by the way he spends
his money, and by what he does with his life.

go in there as an actor. He will be going in there for
the money that he can get out of it, to help him with
his future. He will not be judged by the excellence of
the film or by his acting, but by the way he spends
his money, and by what he does with his life.
THE 'SPIRIT' OF HOLLYWOOD
Stanford men have suddenly crashed the movie
industry, a field that Stanford people don't usually
fall into. Frankie Albert is to be the star of a picture
called "The Spirit of Stanford," and Harry Muheim,
who graduated last year, has been hired as a technical
expert of some sort. It will not be a new thing for
Frankie to be starred, because he has in his last two
years on the football team, and I am also certain that
Muheim can give them some technical advice on the
spirit that floats around the school. The experiment
should be interesting for both boys.
When it was first announced that Frankie was go
ing to make a picture, there were groans and stories
saying that the picture wouldn't be any good, that
they wouldn't give him a good part, and that he would
be made to look silly, like Harmon and Luisetti in
their pictures. There is very little doubt that the pic
ture will be a bad one even with Frankie's charming
personality. There is very little chance that Frankie
will be a natural-born actor, who needs no lessons or
years of study, and is able to become a success over
night. It can happen, and there is no better chance for
it to happen anywhere than in Hollywood. Miracles
happen very easily in that city, and untutored geniuses
like Gene Tierney, Lana Turner and John Payne are
liable to spring up at any time. But the chances aren't
very great that Frankie will make an artistic success.

that doesn't matter. Frankie isn't going clown
there as an actor. He is going down there as a
young man who has a chance to make some money by
working. And no one can blame him for that. As
some said the other day, "Hollywood is more com
mercial than the Department of Commerce." Every
one in Hollywood is doing exactly what Frank is do
ing. They are in Hollywood to make money. To pile
it up high, so that they can eat at Ciro's every night
if they want to. They don't care what kind of movies
they turn out as long as they will make money. Draw
customers. Fill the theaters. Give them what they
want. Give them anything. Just make money. That's
the way Hollywood works. Few of them are con
cerned with the artistic side of their work. They have
no such conscience. But they act like they are actors
and artists and creative people, and it is for this that
they are to be despised. No one cares if people go into
business and make money, just as long as they say
they are doing that. But to go into a business and
make money, and call it art without having any
artistic conscience is too much.
Frankie will not be such a hypocrite. He will not
go in there as an actor. He will be going in there for
the money that he can get out of it, to help him with
his future. He will not be judged by the excellence of
the film or by his acting, but by the way he spends
