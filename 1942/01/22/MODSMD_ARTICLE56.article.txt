## RAM'S HEAD RETORT 
### 
| r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
j Attention Mr. Saroyan.—As you have heard, for
you handed in a script which you wrote during
Christmas vacation, and you mentioned them in your
"Bull Session" on January 19, some One Act Plays
are going to be given. These plays are sponsored by
Ram's Head. Two of the three plays chosen were writ
ten by Ram's Head members. The other was not. This
suggests, perhaps, as you hinted in your article, that
Ram's Head sticks pretty closely to material written
by members of the organization. However, on the
committee which chose the three scripts were four
people, three of whom arc not in Ram's Head. They
didn t care who wrote the plays—they were inter
ested in content.
To two of the three authors of the plays, theater
means a great deal. They've spent their school years
studying every phase of it. It is quite natural, there
fore, that with this background, they have acquired a
knowledge and technique which the average student
does not possess.
As you presupposed, the plays will he very good.
Donna Millen
P.S. We wish to thank you for your script and hope
that this refusal will not discourage you.
