## 
### 
"ALL THAT MONEY CAN BUY," now playing at (he Varsity Theater.
This vehicle, taken from the short story, "The Devil and Daniel Web
ster" hy Stephen Vincent Bcnct, alVords Walter Huston one of his best
pieces of acting in a long career on stage and screen.
In this allegorical drama Huston plays the part of the Devil or Mr.

Scratch as he is referred to in
show. Edward Arnold, playing the i
role of Daniel Webster, does his job
excellently. However, at no time
does he let you forget that it is Ed
ward Arnold playing the part, but i
then maybe Daniel Webster was
just like Edward Arnold.
Huston calls on all of his many
years of acting experience in por
traying Mr. Scratch, who appears
and disappears in wisps of smoke.
Mugging isn't the least of his tal
ents,
NEWCOMER EXCELLENT
Tlie hero, played by James Craig,
performs his task of changing his '
character from good to bad and back
to good again quite well, consider- -
ing his keen competition. Anne
Shirley and Simone Simon, pro
nounced Simone Simon, play their '
roles of heroine and villainess with ;
the amount of sweetness and sinis
terness that is required of them.
The story deals with a New Eng
land farmer who in the face of ex
treme adversity sells his soul to the
devil for five years. He prospers
under Mr. Scratch's guiding finger,
but nearing the end of his term he
loses his wife and his friends and
finally realizes his folly.
SATAN'S JURY
When the payment of death is
called for by Mr. Scratch, our hero
demands a trial with Daniel Web
ster. his friend, as defense attorney.
The jury is made up of twelve'of
the greatest blackguards of all time,
but in the end good wins out and
the hero is saved. However, there
still remains the ending which
comes as a complete surprise to the
producers as well as the audience.â€”
