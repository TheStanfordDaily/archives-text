STANFORD CIRL
ANNOUNCES
ENGAGEMENT
One of the oldest Stanford
traditions that is still ob
served is the engagement
announcement.
Many years ago when
"Sticky" Wilson's was a
tiny shop on the campus,
a girl selected a five pound
box of "Co-Ed" choco
lates and passed it among
the girls at the dinner
table and announced her
marriage engagement - .
Today Stanford girls are
still having five pound
boxes of Wilson's Co-Ed
chocolates delivered at
the dinner hour for sur
prise announcements of
their engagements.
These beautifully
Engagement Boxes are
now on display in our
window.
