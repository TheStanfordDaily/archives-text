### AMIE REICHERT 
DAYS now General Mac A
rthur and his U.S.-Filipino troops
have waited in their defense lines
on Bataan peninsula for the Riant
Japanese offensive which they knew
was sure to come.
For days the fighting has been
rather desultory, and this factor,
combined with the presence of
enemy scouting planes near the
American lines presaged the big
rush which, if it succeeded, would
surely blast Mac-Arthur from his
strongly-defended position.
Yesterday the big push came. An
entire Japanese army numbering
from 200,000 to 300,000 men hurled
itself violently against Mac Arthur's
forces and intense fighting blazed
along the Bataan peninsula front.

I lORDES of fresh enemy troops
spilled into Luzon through Lin
gayen Gulf and Subic Bay, rolled
down into the mountainous Bataan
province where Mac Arthur's defense
line stretches some 13 miles across
the waist of the peninsula.
The attack seemed to be con
centrated on the defenders' left
flank and center, which would in
dicate that the Japanese arc try
ing to drive diagonally across the
lower half of the peninsula and
thereby cut ofT Mac Arthur's main
avenue of retreat — the highway
along the peninsula's cast coast
which leads to the port of Mari
vilcs in the south.
If this maneuver were to succeed,
Mac Arthur might be forced to with
draw to the fortress of Corregidor
in Manila Bay and wait until he is
blasted out of there.

A news comes a report yesterday
from a government spokesman that
sweeping military steps which caused
the redisposition of some 600,000
American troops within the nation,
and other undisclosed measures
which simultaneously strengthened
the American defenses in Hawaii,
have paved the way for reinforce
ment of the entire Southwest Pacific
area.
The official went on to explain
that coastal defenses from California
to Alaska have been bulwarked;
that large numbers of bombers and
pursuit craft have been dispatched to
Hawaii.
The big question now is, will re
inforcements get to Mac Arthur in
time, if it is true that the way is
paved? It seems apparent now
that IVlacArthur, fighting as he is
against such tremendous and over
whelming odds, cannot be ex
pected to hold out for very much
longer. He is now outnumbered
ten to one. The miracle—which
can he in great measure credited
to his brilliant generalship—is how
he has managed to hold out thus
far.
And there is a great deal of value
in that itself. The American and
Filipino troops have gained precious
time for the Allies to reinforce other
strategic positions in the Southwest
Pacific. As long as they hold out—
and this is now mostly dependent on
whether reinforcements get to them
—the Japanese cannot free their
Philippine armies for action else
where, and they cannot make use
of Manila Bay.
The Japanese troops are in com
mand of Lieut. Gen. Masharu
Ilomma, who is one of Japan's
ablest military leaders. At 54 he
has a long record of important
assignments behind him, has long
served on the Japanese General
StafT and is well known in both
American and British military
circles.

in that itself. The American and
Filipino troops have gained precious
time for the Allies to reinforce other
strategic positions in the Southwest
Pacific. As long as they hold out—
and this is now mostly dependent on
whether reinforcements get to them
—the Japanese cannot free their
Philippine armies for action else
where, and they cannot make use
of Manila Bay.
The Japanese troops are in com
mand of Lieut. Gen. Masharu
Ilomma, who is one of Japan's
ablest military leaders. At 54 he
has a long record of important
assignments behind him, has long
served on the Japanese General
StafT and is well known in both
American and British military
circles.
DAYS now General Mac A
rthur and his U.S.-Filipino troops
have waited in their defense lines
on Bataan peninsula for the Riant
Japanese offensive which they knew
was sure to come.
For days the fighting has been
rather desultory, and this factor,
combined with the presence of
enemy scouting planes near the
American lines presaged the big
rush which, if it succeeded, would
surely blast Mac-Arthur from his
strongly-defended position.
Yesterday the big push came. An
entire Japanese army numbering
from 200,000 to 300,000 men hurled
itself violently against Mac Arthur's
forces and intense fighting blazed
along the Bataan peninsula front.

I lORDES of fresh enemy troops
spilled into Luzon through Lin
gayen Gulf and Subic Bay, rolled
down into the mountainous Bataan
province where Mac Arthur's defense
line stretches some 13 miles across
the waist of the peninsula.
The attack seemed to be con
centrated on the defenders' left
flank and center, which would in
dicate that the Japanese arc try
ing to drive diagonally across the
lower half of the peninsula and
thereby cut ofT Mac Arthur's main
avenue of retreat — the highway
along the peninsula's cast coast
which leads to the port of Mari
vilcs in the south.
If this maneuver were to succeed,
Mac Arthur might be forced to with
draw to the fortress of Corregidor
in Manila Bay and wait until he is
blasted out of there.

A news comes a report yesterday
from a government spokesman that
sweeping military steps which caused
the redisposition of some 600,000
American troops within the nation,
and other undisclosed measures
which simultaneously strengthened
the American defenses in Hawaii,
have paved the way for reinforce
ment of the entire Southwest Pacific
area.
The official went on to explain
that coastal defenses from California
to Alaska have been bulwarked;
that large numbers of bombers and
pursuit craft have been dispatched to
Hawaii.
The big question now is, will re
inforcements get to Mac Arthur in
time, if it is true that the way is
paved? It seems apparent now
that IVlacArthur, fighting as he is
against such tremendous and over
whelming odds, cannot be ex
pected to hold out for very much
longer. He is now outnumbered
ten to one. The miracle—which
can he in great measure credited
to his brilliant generalship—is how
he has managed to hold out thus
far.
And there is a great deal of value
in that itself. The American and
Filipino troops have gained precious
time for the Allies to reinforce other
strategic positions in the Southwest
Pacific. As long as they hold out—
