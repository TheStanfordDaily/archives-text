# Argentina Receives Ultimatum To Join in Axis Break Today
## 
### 
RIO I>E JANEIRO, Jan. 22 (UP). —The Pan-American Conference of
Foreign Ministers was reported authoritatively tonight to have given Ar
gentina until tomorrow afternoon to support the resolution for a joint
hemispheric break with the Axis.
The Buenos Aires government raised a last-minute objection to the

resolution today despite the official,
acceptance of a severance formula
Wednesday by Argentine Foreign
Minister Enrique Ruiz Guinazu,
delegate plenipotentiary to the con
ference.
COMMITTEE TO ACT
The resolution will go before the
conference's defense committee for
formal action at noon tomorrow.
The committee was described as "at
the end of its patience," and it was
indicated that 20 nations, including
Chile, will support the resolution,
driving Argentina into isolation—
unless the Argentine government
alters its position and supports Ruiz
Guinazu.
Argentina's latest objection to the
severance formula as drafted was
based on the transposition of three
words which—if Argentina demands
are accepted—would strip the reso
lution of its purpose of offering the
guarantee of a united hemispheric
anti-Axis front.
CHANGE SOUGHT
The change sought by Argentina
would make the resolution say that,
the American republics "can discon
tinue relations" with the Axis
rather than they "cannot continue
relations."
Foreign Minister Juan B. Rossetti
of Chile today received authoriza
tion from his government to support
the resolution. It was speculated,
however, that a protracted "revolt"
by Argentina might affect Chile's
stand somewhat.
