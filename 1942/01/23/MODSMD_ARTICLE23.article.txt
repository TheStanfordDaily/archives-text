### HELEN LIVINGSTON 
It could be any place, any
where, al any timeâ€”(his is (he
idea William (iirvan is trying (o
get across in his sets for "Marco
Millions," to be presented Feb. 5,
(>, and 7 in (he Memorial Theater.
Since Eugene O'Neill's hero
symbolizes and satirizes (he uni
versal type of business man, (lie
sets must echo (his idea of uni
vcrsatility, according to (iirvan.
The set is composed of huge en
trances 011 either side of (he slage
and up(sage a mass of steps and
levels (hat afford the director a
chance for strikingly effective
groupings.
There arc I!! scenes in (lie play,
each with a different locale, (here
fore a unit set was the only solu
tion. "If we tried (o design dif
fered) sets for each scene, pretty
soon nobody is watching the actors
and (he whole (liing is a flop.
We're just trying to get a good

basic 11 iii( (hat the aiuiicncc can
imagine in Persia, China, or Ven
ire," says Girvan.
He had fun wlili lite designs
for (he various thrones that ap
pear in the show. The Persian
throne lias a camel painted on it
that you would (hink came
straight out of (he New Yorker,
instead of from an antique Per
sian tile. That camel has a per
sonality almost like Ferdinand the
Bull.
The rest of the thrones are dec
orated with various patterns.
There is one with a mean-looking
cobra on it, another with an
equally indignant dragon, and
Kuhlai Khan's features the Chi
nese symbol for long life. The
latter, (iirvan goints ou 4 has
swastikas 011 il, "So (he Nazis
aren't as original as (hey think
(hey are. They (bought that up in
China before there was any surh
place on the map as Germany."
