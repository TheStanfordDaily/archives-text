# Sadie Hawkins Invades Row, Hall Tomorrow
## Li'l Abners Guests At Dogpatch Doin's In Pavilion at 9:30 
### 
If you see a scantily-clad young
female come wandering into your
fraternity or hall tomorrow night
and scream up the stairs for a man,
control yourself, friend, control
yourself.
For she is taking him to the Sadie
Hawkins Dance, scheduled from
9:30 to 1 a.m. in the Pavilion, and
according to true Dogpatch, Ky.,
tradition she has to buy the. bid
(99c), call tor her Li'l Abner, escort
him to the dance, see to it that the
after-dance entertainment is enter
taining, and get her date home safe
and sound before his lockout.
NO lIOBBED BOOTS
"No one wearing hard-soled shoes
will be admitted to the dance,"
Dodie Dolan, dance chairman,
stressed again yesterday. "The Pa
vilion floor has just been refinished
at a cost of $500, and hob-nail boots,
etc., would ruin it." Rubber-soled
and tennis shoes were recommended.
Many couples are planning to dance
barefoot.
Farm men are busy plotting re
venge for the hours they have paced
away, waiting for the girl friend to
"be down in just a minute."
LET 'EM WAIT!
"She'll wait an hour," threatened
one Li'l Abner, "and then I'll come
down, bat my lashes, and say in a
coy way, 'Did I take long?'" Many
cautious males were laying aside a
couple of bucks for "mad money."
Uninvited men were trying all
sorts of desperate ruses to obtain
invitations. Hashers at the Tri-Delt
house appeai-ed with signs around
their necks, reading, "We Want Dates
for the Sadie Hawkins Dance." They
got themâ€”each hasher was present
ed with one large plate, in the cen
ter of which was one small, obscure,
insignificant date. Any resemblance
to ground glass in the Tri-Delt food
is purely coincidental.
