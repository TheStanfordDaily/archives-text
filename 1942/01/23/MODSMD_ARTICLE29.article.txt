# Two Fraternities Found Guilty!
## Sigma Nus, Sigma Chis Lose Social Privileges Houses Fined $6 Per Man, Denied Rushing Periods on Jan. 30 and 31 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Two Stanford fraternity houses—the Sigma Nus and the Sigina Chis—
violated Interfratcrnity rushing rules by holding ofT-campus rush parties
last week-end. Such was the decision reached in a two-hour session of
the eight-man Interfratcrnity Board last night.
Intcrfraternity President Jim Ilaugh declined to reveal the exact nature

of the parties except that they were
"cut-and-dried violations of Inter
fraternity rushing rules."
A three-point penalty was an
nounced by the How Board to apply
equally on both houses. It is a l ,
follows.
(1) No rushing periods on Janu
ary 30 and 31.
(2) Loss of social privileges for
winter and spring quarters, effective
February 7 (the day following the
Pledge Prom).
(3) Assessment of $6 per man on
actives and pledges (as of Formal
Pledging, February 6) living in or
out of the house."
"The meeting was held for the
purpose of clearing up the rushing
situation," Haugh said. "We want to
disassociate campus rumor from
actual fact." Several other cases
were considered, but were dropped
for lack of evidence of any party
actually being held.
LACK OF EVIDENCE
"As regards freshmen, lack of
conclusive evidence prevents more
definite action against rushees in
volved. In the event the names of
freshmen on illegal rush parties
come to light, their pledging privi
leges will be withdrawn," Haugh
added. "Freshmen should not at
tend ofT-campus parties."
In explaining the number one
penalty, Haugh said, "The purpose of
rushing is to put all houses on an
equal footing. Therefore, the board
believed that rushing privileges be
withdrawn since the rush party, in
a sense, constituted a rush period
for the group involved."
"The assessment will not be so
harsh since members will not have
to be assessed for house dances,"
Haugh quixotically commented on
the second and third penalties.
RULE MODIFIED
To clarify existing rush rules, the
main restrictive rule of rushing was
modified by the board to read:
"There shall be no off-campus
rushing in which a fraternity is in
volved financially or otherwise,
whether members are present or
I not."
"This is to spike any attempts to
have parties at which only rushees
are present but at which the bill is
footed by the fraternity," he said.
A DEFINITE STAND
"The houses co-operated well
during fall quarter establishing the
feeling that the deferred winter
quarter system in general has been
a success," Haugli continued. "How
ever, it is on such cases as this thai,
the Interfraternity Board took a defi
nite stand last quarter in trying to
eliminate this thing.
"It appears that the rushing pro
gram is ready to be enforced not by
board action but by intelligent co
operation among the houses and
rushees involved.
"These rushing parties wore
planned with the feeling that, per
haps the other houses, as in previous
years, were holding rush parties and
due also to a lack of confidence of
the houses in the agreement as to
the rules established by them. We've
progressed far enough now to accept
the entire rushing program and
carry it, out effectively according to
the rules," Haugh concluded.

rushing in which a fraternity is in
volved financially or otherwise,
whether members are present or
I not."
"This is to spike any attempts to
have parties at which only rushees
are present but at which the bill is
footed by the fraternity," he said.
A DEFINITE STAND
"The houses co-operated well
during fall quarter establishing the
feeling that the deferred winter
quarter system in general has been
a success," Haugli continued. "How
ever, it is on such cases as this thai,
the Interfraternity Board took a defi
nite stand last quarter in trying to
eliminate this thing.
"It appears that the rushing pro
gram is ready to be enforced not by
board action but by intelligent co
operation among the houses and
rushees involved.
"These rushing parties wore
planned with the feeling that, per
haps the other houses, as in previous
years, were holding rush parties and
due also to a lack of confidence of
the houses in the agreement as to
the rules established by them. We've
progressed far enough now to accept
the entire rushing program and
carry it, out effectively according to
the rules," Haugh concluded.
Two Stanford fraternity houses—the Sigma Nus and the Sigina Chis—
violated Interfratcrnity rushing rules by holding ofT-campus rush parties
last week-end. Such was the decision reached in a two-hour session of
the eight-man Interfratcrnity Board last night.
Intcrfraternity President Jim Ilaugh declined to reveal the exact nature

of the parties except that they were
"cut-and-dried violations of Inter
fraternity rushing rules."
A three-point penalty was an
nounced by the How Board to apply
equally on both houses. It is a l ,
follows.
(1) No rushing periods on Janu
ary 30 and 31.
(2) Loss of social privileges for
winter and spring quarters, effective
February 7 (the day following the
Pledge Prom).
(3) Assessment of $6 per man on
actives and pledges (as of Formal
Pledging, February 6) living in or
out of the house."
"The meeting was held for the
purpose of clearing up the rushing
situation," Haugh said. "We want to
disassociate campus rumor from
actual fact." Several other cases
were considered, but were dropped
for lack of evidence of any party
actually being held.
LACK OF EVIDENCE
"As regards freshmen, lack of
conclusive evidence prevents more
definite action against rushees in
volved. In the event the names of
freshmen on illegal rush parties
come to light, their pledging privi
leges will be withdrawn," Haugh
added. "Freshmen should not at
tend ofT-campus parties."
In explaining the number one
penalty, Haugh said, "The purpose of
rushing is to put all houses on an
equal footing. Therefore, the board
believed that rushing privileges be
withdrawn since the rush party, in
a sense, constituted a rush period
for the group involved."
"The assessment will not be so
harsh since members will not have
to be assessed for house dances,"
Haugh quixotically commented on
the second and third penalties.
RULE MODIFIED
To clarify existing rush rules, the
main restrictive rule of rushing was
modified by the board to read:
"There shall be no off-campus
rushing in which a fraternity is in
volved financially or otherwise,
whether members are present or
I not."
"This is to spike any attempts to
have parties at which only rushees
are present but at which the bill is
