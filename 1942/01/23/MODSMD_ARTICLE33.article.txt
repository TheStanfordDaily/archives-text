### JIM WUENSCHEL 
"Each time a student wants his mail and has forgotten his key or else
can't remember his combination, we put a check by his box. We allow
student three checks and on the fourth one he goes in to see (he
superintendent."
Albert A. Quinn, one of Stanford's post ollice officials, glowered as he

said this. "It's their worst fault." +
Quinn was busy sorting the fra- 1
ternity rushing cards and everyone |
else was rushing around with great j
handfuls of the post cards. "This ;
year it's been doubly worse —first j
everyone was getting Christmas
cards and now they're all getting
rushing cards."
OLD-TIME CLERK
Quinn is one of the old-timers at
Stanford. He attended Stanford for
a while, then in 1904 took over the
job of clerk at Encina. He held this
job until 1916, when he moved over
to the post office, where he has j
worked continuously ever since. All J
told he has put in a total of 39 years
at Stanford.
"In the old days students didn't
seem to get as much mail, especially
the men. Since the post office j
opened the original number of boxes
has increased from 500 to over
1800."
WOMEN GET MORE
"Looking at it, generally, they
seem to get the larger amount of
mail, but the men's mail is always
better addressed, either by their
families or by their girls."
Quinn by this time having fin
ished with the rushing cards, had i
started on the weekly quota of Sat
urday Evening Posts. "This maga
zine and Life and The New Yorker
are the favorites around here. Not I
forgetting the New York Times, of j
course."
Delving into another sack of mail,
Quinn came up and said, "II you
haven't got. your auto vehicle motor |
tax, you'd better get it. And please
don't come to the General Delivery
window and ask to buy one. You i
get, them over at. the regular stamp j
window.

OLD-TIME CLERK
Quinn is one of the old-timers at
Stanford. He attended Stanford for
a while, then in 1904 took over the
job of clerk at Encina. He held this
job until 1916, when he moved over
to the post office, where he has j
worked continuously ever since. All J
told he has put in a total of 39 years
at Stanford.
"In the old days students didn't
seem to get as much mail, especially
the men. Since the post office j
opened the original number of boxes
has increased from 500 to over
1800."
WOMEN GET MORE
"Looking at it, generally, they
seem to get the larger amount of
mail, but the men's mail is always
better addressed, either by their
families or by their girls."
Quinn by this time having fin
ished with the rushing cards, had i
started on the weekly quota of Sat
urday Evening Posts. "This maga
zine and Life and The New Yorker
are the favorites around here. Not I
forgetting the New York Times, of j
course."
Delving into another sack of mail,
Quinn came up and said, "II you
haven't got. your auto vehicle motor |
tax, you'd better get it. And please
don't come to the General Delivery
window and ask to buy one. You i
get, them over at. the regular stamp j
window.
"Each time a student wants his mail and has forgotten his key or else
can't remember his combination, we put a check by his box. We allow
student three checks and on the fourth one he goes in to see (he
superintendent."
Albert A. Quinn, one of Stanford's post ollice officials, glowered as he

said this. "It's their worst fault." +
Quinn was busy sorting the fra- 1
ternity rushing cards and everyone |
else was rushing around with great j
handfuls of the post cards. "This ;
year it's been doubly worse —first j
everyone was getting Christmas
cards and now they're all getting
