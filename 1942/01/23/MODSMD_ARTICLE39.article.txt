### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UP).â€”
Mounting congressional wrath over
"unconscionable profiteering" on war
contracts tonight brought demands
for swift action on corrective legis
lation.
Chairman Carl Vinson, D., Ga., of
the House Naval Affairs Committee,
whose recent revelations of profits
on arms and aircraft contracts
shocked both houses, introduced a
far-reaching bill to compel labor
unions and business and trade or
ganizations to file financial state
ments, rosters of officers and other
pertinent data with the Department
of Commerce.
