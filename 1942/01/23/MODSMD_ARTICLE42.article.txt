# Cal, Injuns Open PCC War Here Tonight at 8
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford's long-awailed rebate for
the Big Game upset is here—tonight
liic Bears and Redskins square oil
in the I'avilion at X p.m. in the Bay
area opening of the P.C.C. southern
division basketball championship.
California invades the Farm with
two conference games already under
its bolt, a win and a loss with the
Trojans. The Indians are still green
as far as blue chip pressure goes,
but the U S.F. encounter last Tues
day was close enough to test Coach
Everett Dean's boys under pressing
conditions.
In their practice season just com
pleted Stanford won 12 out of 13
games, and evened the issue for that
one loss to Santa Clara by defeating
the Broncs, 37-27.
Truly an impressive total, this 12
for 13 percentage, but tonight it's
different.
CURTAIN-RAISER
In its curtain-raiser attempt of
southern division honors for the
second straight year, the Indians are
lip against a spotty but clever aggre
gation manned by Coach Clajence
M. "Nibs" Price, veteran Cal hoop
mentor for the last 17 years.
Last season Stanford won the Cal
opener, 35-31, and the second tilt,
45)- < 42, dropping the finale, 40-29.
Tonight, despite the loss of five
lettermen including Captain Johnny
McGee, the Bears will put a squad
on the floor that is almost as good
as their '41 club, since McGee was
the only first-stringer to be grad
uated.
Bob Biles was supposed to have
taken McGee's position at center,
but Bill Farley, the 6-foot-7'/2 giant,
gets the starting berth. Biles is the
more experienced man, but Farley's
six-inch advantage over Biles makes
the difference.
FOUR VETERANS
The remainder of the Bear start
ers, Bob Alameida, Merv Lafaille,
Jim Bailey, and Hoy Tamm, are all
veterans of the cage wars.
On the veteran side Stanford
boasts co-captains Don Burness and
Bill Cowden with new blood in
Jimmy Pollard, Howie Dallmar and
Ed Voss. The last three have their
experience too, but Burness and
Cowden have the advantage of more
conference competition.
The game should resolve itself
around a steady Cal team and the
Indians' more open, steady, and
flashy type of offensive maneuver
ing.

but Bill Farley, the 6-foot-7'/2 giant,
gets the starting berth. Biles is the
more experienced man, but Farley's
six-inch advantage over Biles makes
the difference.
FOUR VETERANS
The remainder of the Bear start
ers, Bob Alameida, Merv Lafaille,
Jim Bailey, and Hoy Tamm, are all
veterans of the cage wars.
On the veteran side Stanford
boasts co-captains Don Burness and
Bill Cowden with new blood in
Jimmy Pollard, Howie Dallmar and
Ed Voss. The last three have their
experience too, but Burness and
Cowden have the advantage of more
conference competition.
The game should resolve itself
around a steady Cal team and the
Indians' more open, steady, and
flashy type of offensive maneuver
ing.
Stanford's long-awailed rebate for
the Big Game upset is here—tonight
liic Bears and Redskins square oil
in the I'avilion at X p.m. in the Bay
area opening of the P.C.C. southern
division basketball championship.
California invades the Farm with
two conference games already under
its bolt, a win and a loss with the
Trojans. The Indians are still green
as far as blue chip pressure goes,
but the U S.F. encounter last Tues
day was close enough to test Coach
Everett Dean's boys under pressing
conditions.
In their practice season just com
pleted Stanford won 12 out of 13
games, and evened the issue for that
one loss to Santa Clara by defeating
the Broncs, 37-27.
Truly an impressive total, this 12
for 13 percentage, but tonight it's
different.
CURTAIN-RAISER
In its curtain-raiser attempt of
southern division honors for the
second straight year, the Indians are
lip against a spotty but clever aggre
gation manned by Coach Clajence
M. "Nibs" Price, veteran Cal hoop
mentor for the last 17 years.
Last season Stanford won the Cal
opener, 35-31, and the second tilt,
45)- < 42, dropping the finale, 40-29.
Tonight, despite the loss of five
lettermen including Captain Johnny
McGee, the Bears will put a squad
on the floor that is almost as good
as their '41 club, since McGee was
the only first-stringer to be grad
uated.
Bob Biles was supposed to have
taken McGee's position at center,
but Bill Farley, the 6-foot-7'/2 giant,
gets the starting berth. Biles is the
more experienced man, but Farley's
six-inch advantage over Biles makes
the difference.
