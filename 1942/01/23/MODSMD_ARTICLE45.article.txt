### DON SELBY 
STANFORD'S basketball season, which lias been highly successful to
date, goes into high gear tonight, as (lie Indian cagers take the court
for their first game in defense of the southern division crown they copped
last year.
As is the tradition, California's Golden Bears, coached by Nibs Price, is
the first team on the Stanford conference schedule.
Probably due to California's miserable early season showing, the idea
that the Bears will be a push-over for Stanford has been prevalent.
Maybe so, but it's doubtful.
California, with Merv Lafaille, Roy Tamm, Bob Biles, and Bob Ala
meida on the first team, is a veteran outfit. If Fibber McGee, the center,
were back, the Bears would have last year's second-place quintet intact.
That in itself ought to warn Stanford rooters that the Bears should
be a tough team to beat. In addition, Cal garnered a split with Ele
vator Sam Barry's U.S.C. Trojans in the Shrine Auditorium last week
end. giving evidence that they are starting to roll. There is no doubt
but what playing on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in Los An
geles is a definite handicap to the visiting team.
Nibs Price almost always brings his team along slowly, so if the Bears
really aren't good, you can't find that out for sure until the season has
developed to quite an extent.
As much as it hurts to bring up the Big Game, we might mention that
but a few observers believed thiit Cal could win that contest last fall. In
the present ease, however, the Indians aren't nearly as overwhelmingly
favored, more than one San Francisco writer having picked the Bears to
cop the loop title.
All of which adds up to the idea that Stanford and California should
put up a great game of basketball in the Pavilion tonight.
* * * *
IMGIIT NOW Southern California holds the loop lead, having turned in
a win over Cal and another over U.C.L.A. Cal, with the split with
Troy, is in second place; and Ucla trails with one loss and no victories.
Stanford, of course, is nowhere, not having played a conference game as
yet.
A victory tonight would put the Indians on the top of the ladder, while
the rest of the teams would stay in their same places, since the Trojans
and Bruins engage independent outfits this week-end.
A Cal win would send Stanford to a lie for the cellar position with
Ucla and would put the Bears in a tie with Troy for first place.
In all probability, the chances of a Bear victory rest on the shooting
eyes of Lafaille and Tamm, the hot-shot forwards. Bailey is always good—
a steady boy who once in a while turns in a sensational performance. Biles
and Alameida are hot-and-cold players.
But it's doubtful if, even with Bailey sensational and Biles and Ala
meida hotter than usual, the Bears could top the Indians il Lafaille and
Tamm were not peppering the basket in top fashion.
When the Bears knocked over U.S.C. last Saturday night, Lafaille
hit for 12 points and Tamm for 11. If they can do that well tonight,
the Indians arc going to have to he hot to win.
Don Burness is a good shot; so is Jim Pollard, and so is Howie Dallmar.
Voss doesn't 'shoot much from more than 10 feet from the hoop, but he
has turned into a very valuable tip-in man and has taken high-point hon
ors several times. Bill Cowden seems to be a good shot, although he doesn't
take enough shots to give a person a very good idea.

That in itself ought to warn Stanford rooters that the Bears should
be a tough team to beat. In addition, Cal garnered a split with Ele
vator Sam Barry's U.S.C. Trojans in the Shrine Auditorium last week
end. giving evidence that they are starting to roll. There is no doubt
but what playing on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in Los An
geles is a definite handicap to the visiting team.
Nibs Price almost always brings his team along slowly, so if the Bears
really aren't good, you can't find that out for sure until the season has
developed to quite an extent.
As much as it hurts to bring up the Big Game, we might mention that
but a few observers believed thiit Cal could win that contest last fall. In
the present ease, however, the Indians aren't nearly as overwhelmingly
favored, more than one San Francisco writer having picked the Bears to
cop the loop title.
All of which adds up to the idea that Stanford and California should
put up a great game of basketball in the Pavilion tonight.
* * * *
IMGIIT NOW Southern California holds the loop lead, having turned in
a win over Cal and another over U.C.L.A. Cal, with the split with
Troy, is in second place; and Ucla trails with one loss and no victories.
Stanford, of course, is nowhere, not having played a conference game as
yet.
A victory tonight would put the Indians on the top of the ladder, while
the rest of the teams would stay in their same places, since the Trojans
and Bruins engage independent outfits this week-end.
A Cal win would send Stanford to a lie for the cellar position with
Ucla and would put the Bears in a tie with Troy for first place.
In all probability, the chances of a Bear victory rest on the shooting
eyes of Lafaille and Tamm, the hot-shot forwards. Bailey is always good—
a steady boy who once in a while turns in a sensational performance. Biles
and Alameida are hot-and-cold players.
But it's doubtful if, even with Bailey sensational and Biles and Ala
meida hotter than usual, the Bears could top the Indians il Lafaille and
Tamm were not peppering the basket in top fashion.
When the Bears knocked over U.S.C. last Saturday night, Lafaille
hit for 12 points and Tamm for 11. If they can do that well tonight,
the Indians arc going to have to he hot to win.
Don Burness is a good shot; so is Jim Pollard, and so is Howie Dallmar.
Voss doesn't 'shoot much from more than 10 feet from the hoop, but he
has turned into a very valuable tip-in man and has taken high-point hon
ors several times. Bill Cowden seems to be a good shot, although he doesn't
take enough shots to give a person a very good idea.
STANFORD'S basketball season, which lias been highly successful to
date, goes into high gear tonight, as (lie Indian cagers take the court
for their first game in defense of the southern division crown they copped
last year.
As is the tradition, California's Golden Bears, coached by Nibs Price, is
the first team on the Stanford conference schedule.
Probably due to California's miserable early season showing, the idea
that the Bears will be a push-over for Stanford has been prevalent.
Maybe so, but it's doubtful.
California, with Merv Lafaille, Roy Tamm, Bob Biles, and Bob Ala
meida on the first team, is a veteran outfit. If Fibber McGee, the center,
were back, the Bears would have last year's second-place quintet intact.
