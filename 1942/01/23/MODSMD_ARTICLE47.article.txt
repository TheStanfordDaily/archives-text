# Frosh Pitchers Star in Drills
## 
### 
With a turnout of 24 men, Harry
Shipkey, frosh baseball coach, is
faced with the problem of building a
baseball team around the pitching of
two good prospects, a likely air
tight defense, and a minimum of
hitting strength.
The pitching situation looks ex
ceptionally good at the present
time, with Bill Brokaw and Harry
Mason, a pair of right-handers,
battilng for the starting position. On
the basis of the stuff shown by these
two boys, Shipkey thinks that the
pitching staff will be better than the
Don Pendergrass-Larry Wolf duo
which chucked for last year's highly
successful yearling ball club.
LOTS OF SHORTSTOPS
Ross Pendergast, a southpaw, and
Cannon Parkinson, the footballer,
are both out for the mound job.
Parkinson is also the leading candi
date for the shortstop berth, which
was so overburdened with manpower
that Shipkey had to shift several of
the boys to other spots. Both Bob
Curtis and John Eliel were moved to
first base, where there were no
candidates.
Sandy Banks, one of three frosh
gridders fighting for the number one
catching job, has a slight advantage
over Bill Young and Frank Moulton
right now.
INFIELD CANDIDATES
Second-sackers are C. C. Smith
and Ken Harth, while Bill Rainalter
and Jim Boswell are working for the
hot corner job. Partly due to his
hitting prowess. Parkinson leads
Harry Elliot in the battle for short
stop.
In the outfield there is not much
difference in ability among Bob
Boorman, Harry Bubb, Mark Caffal,
Buck Chasnoff, Wyatt Dawson, John
Eshleman. Graves Hudson, Allan
Beck, and Edward Scoyen.
