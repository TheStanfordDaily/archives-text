# Mermen Meet 'Y' Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity and freshman
swimming teams open their season
tomorrow afternoon in a double
dual meet with the powerful San
Francisco Y.M.C.A. mermen at 2:150
in the Encina pools.
As distinguished from a simple
triangular meet, a double dual meet
means that the varsity competes
against the freshmen in one meet
and the "Y" in another, while the
freshmen face the "Y" in a third
separate affair. Points are counted
separately.
VARSITY DOUBTFUL
Surprisingly enough, the war and
injury-riddled varsity stands to lose
both meets while the freshmen and
Golden Gators fight it out for the
top spot.
Co-captain Doc Colyear, ace 200-
yard swimmer, is out of the meet
with an injured knee; Howie Ad
ams, All-American diver, is in the
Naval Air Corps; Bert Singer is in
the Navy; and Hayes Busch. top 440
swimmer, is carrying too many units
to go out for the team.
FROSH BETTER
Without these men, even Coach
Thornton figures his varsity no bet
ter than third but maintains that
his freshman team has a better than
even chance of beating the visitors,
who were barely edged out of the
National "Y" Championship last
year.
"Finger-tip finishes can be ex
pected in at least six of the eight
swimming races," says Thornton.
Diving competition and diving ex
hibitions by Bill Bemaer and Jerry
Greer round out tomorrow's free
aquatic program.
