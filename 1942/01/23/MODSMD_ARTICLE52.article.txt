## Card Frosh to Face Galileo With Heald Probable Starter 
### 
Jack Heald will probably be at his center post when the freshman hoop
squad takes the court against Galileo High of San Francisco tonight at
(5:15 in a preliminary to the Stanford-California game.
Return of the Montana pivot man In the line-up was indicated by Coach
Phil Bcngtson last night after the frosh wound up their last practice

session. It is probable that Head
will get only a quarter or two at
most out of his injured knee, but his
added height will give the Papeese
more advantage over the shorter
Lions.
Galileo looked impotent in losing
a lethargic battle to George Wash
ington High, Wednesday, 31 to 20.
Previously the roarless Lions drop
ped their opener to Poly High, 37 to
1(5. They will provide an interesting
basis for comparing the Card year
lings with City outfits, but no real
trouble should be anticipated by a
Bcngtson set-up that has been stead
ily improving in this week's work
outs.
BROWN TO SPARKLE
In Stanford's starting line-up
will be Fred Parsons and Bob Bar
socchini at forwards, Heald, perhaps
Harwood, at center, and Bob Hall
and Dave Brown at guards. With the
Lion altitude being what it isn't the
added inches of Brown are apt to
sparkle again in his personal guard
to-forward break play that has net
ted him the scoring honors thus far
this year. Parsons, hot for a spell in
the San Jose fracas, is due to hit the
beam, and you can expect to see
plenty of Fred Ferroggiaro, guard
reserve, and Carlos Brown, stocky
forward.
DALLEY FOR GALILEO
Sparking for the invaders will be
lanky center Ed Dal ley, G-2 of bas
ketball player that is seemingly all
Galileo has to offer. "Slick" Jones
at one of the forward berths was
the neatest ball handler against G.
Washington, Wednesday, but his
box-score rating was a zero-flush.
Dalley pushed (5 points, and forward
Pete Lum connected for 8 in the
Wednesday game.
