# Money Talks
## 
### 
NOT very many people are going to doubt
that the Sigma Chi's and the Sigma Nu's got
off plenty easy last night.
They were found guilty of illegal rushing and
the penalties administered by Interfraternity
Board of Control are listed on page 1.
Granted they got off easy, there is a lot more
lo this tale that cannot be reported in a straight
news story, which tells merely what happened
as a result of Interfraternity's consideration of
the case.
It is hard, in the first place, to say what hap
pened and, in the second place, it may not be
within our province to pass judgment on their
actions. Nevertheless, such a light penalty for
the two houses' infractions, in place of the ru
mored action whereby they would literally get
the "book thrown at them," that is, cancellation
of all pledging privileges, is so curious that it
immediately invites speculation.
Why were the penalties not heavier? The
Interfraternity president stated, following last
night's meeting of the Board, that they were
"cut-and-dried violations of Interfraternity rush
rules."
There is a plenty good reason why these
officers handed down the decision of last night,
and this reason, we admit, is justified upon the
basis of rather loose logic, but the end to be con
sidered is the blunt question of whether these
houses are in danger of having their life breath
snuffed out by penalties for one night's indis
cretion.
First, it is no state secret that fraternities are
being thinned out by the war, and that if they
do not pledge as many men as possible (within
their quota of 14 freshmen and an unlimited
number of sophomores, juniors or seniors), they
will become financially marginal houses and
wind up with one foot in the grave and the
other on a banana peel.
Nor is it a sub rosa fact that food prices and
other living expenses have ascended severely.
This makes it tough.
The fact remains that the rules exist, and
while other houses escaped for lack of con
clusive evidence, the two fraternities fined last
night were caught with the jam on their faces.
The only alternative which might be con
sidered is to throw rush regulations in the
wastebasket. Rush rules guarantee a fair break
to the "little houses" in competition with the
"big houses." If rules went out the window,
resulting cut-throat competition to see who was
going to spend the most money for the biggest
bust in the city or out in the country would
cut the arteries of their treasuries.
Regardless of the extent of last night's action,
every fraternity man knov/s now there will be
no more monkey business. While the penalties
may have seemed light, they will do the trick
because money talks, and no house can afford
to pay immediate fines or lose prospective
paying members.—Harold Shafer

other on a banana peel.
Nor is it a sub rosa fact that food prices and
other living expenses have ascended severely.
This makes it tough.
The fact remains that the rules exist, and
while other houses escaped for lack of con
clusive evidence, the two fraternities fined last
night were caught with the jam on their faces.
The only alternative which might be con
sidered is to throw rush regulations in the
wastebasket. Rush rules guarantee a fair break
to the "little houses" in competition with the
"big houses." If rules went out the window,
resulting cut-throat competition to see who was
going to spend the most money for the biggest
bust in the city or out in the country would
cut the arteries of their treasuries.
Regardless of the extent of last night's action,
every fraternity man knov/s now there will be
no more monkey business. While the penalties
may have seemed light, they will do the trick
because money talks, and no house can afford
to pay immediate fines or lose prospective
paying members.—Harold Shafer
NOT very many people are going to doubt
that the Sigma Chi's and the Sigma Nu's got
off plenty easy last night.
They were found guilty of illegal rushing and
the penalties administered by Interfraternity
Board of Control are listed on page 1.
Granted they got off easy, there is a lot more
lo this tale that cannot be reported in a straight
news story, which tells merely what happened
as a result of Interfraternity's consideration of
the case.
It is hard, in the first place, to say what hap
pened and, in the second place, it may not be
within our province to pass judgment on their
actions. Nevertheless, such a light penalty for
the two houses' infractions, in place of the ru
mored action whereby they would literally get
the "book thrown at them," that is, cancellation
of all pledging privileges, is so curious that it
immediately invites speculation.
Why were the penalties not heavier? The
Interfraternity president stated, following last
night's meeting of the Board, that they were
"cut-and-dried violations of Interfraternity rush
rules."
There is a plenty good reason why these
officers handed down the decision of last night,
and this reason, we admit, is justified upon the
basis of rather loose logic, but the end to be con
sidered is the blunt question of whether these
houses are in danger of having their life breath
snuffed out by penalties for one night's indis
cretion.
First, it is no state secret that fraternities are
being thinned out by the war, and that if they
do not pledge as many men as possible (within
their quota of 14 freshmen and an unlimited
number of sophomores, juniors or seniors), they
will become financially marginal houses and
wind up with one foot in the grave and the
other on a banana peel.

other living expenses have ascended severely.
