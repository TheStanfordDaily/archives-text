# Of Bells and Binders
## 
### 
AT the close of each academic hour at Stan
ford a bell rings. Also, the chimes ring.
They are less reliable than the bells.
The bell signifies the fact that one hour is
over, that the next is to begin within ten min
utes. Professors usually understand about how
Jong it takes to walk from Geology corner to
History corner and most of them time their
lectures in such a way that they are through
when or very shortly after the bell sounds.
There is a greatly increasing trend, however,
for the Stanford student to react as though he
is the subject of the Pavlov conditioned re
flex experiment. (You know, the bell rings and
the animal's mouth v/aters.)
The bell rings and the students' automatic
reaction is to start the infernal binder snapping.
The professor could be summing up the entire
course in a few pearls, but it matters not. Some
force compels students to exert the fiendish
pressure which produces a battery of small
sharp noises.
This is a situation which The Daily feels cer
tain each Stanford student can rise above. If

some outsider accused us of being discourteous
and rowdy we would be appalled. Yet, there's
many a professor in this school who'd take the
affirmative . . . and advisedly.â€”Rosemarie Mul
