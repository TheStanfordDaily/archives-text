### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
A LITTLE STORY
r TWO of them had been in the bar for some time.
One was large, almost a giant, with huge, thick
hands, long and husky legs, and a body that was
built like a bear's. The other was also tall, but he
was very thin and wiry, and his legs and fingers were
long and delicate. Both wore overcoats, which they
left on, but neither of them wore hats. From their
faces you could tell that they wece still in their
early twenties.
For some time they had been in the bar. The thin
one merely sat quietly and drank. The big one drank
and swore and threw his arms around all the wait
resses, and kept continually putting nickels in the
music box and was always telling everyone how they
had both joined the navy that morning. "We're going
to go and clean out those Skibs," he kept saying.
"Skinny and me are going to ruin those Skibs, aren't
we, Skin?" And Skinny would always say, "Yes, but
drink your drink and don't make so much noise."
That had been going on for some time.

VOW the big one was standing on a chair, he had
a drink in his hand and he was leading everyone
in singing "America." He made everyone sing, and
he sang very loudly and he waved his arms wildly
and kept telling the people to sing louder. Everyone
sang except Skinny. He sat and drank. After the
song, everyone cheered and then the giant bellowed
out in a loud voice, "Doesn't anyone think that Skinny
and me aren't going to clean out those Skibs?" There
was a loud "No" from everyone. The giant satisfied
got down from the chair. "That's right," he said.
"We're going to get those Skibs." He walked around
and said goodbye to everyone, apologizing for having
to leave and then came back to his own table where
Skinny was still sitting. "Let's go," he said and he
took Skinny by the arm and lead him to the door, all
the while waving goodbye to all his friends. At the
door, he stopped and went over to one of the wait
resses, put his big hands around her waist and lifted
her up in the air and kissed her. "We're going out
to clean out the Skibs for you, darling," he shouted.
"Don't worry, Skinny and me won't let nobody hurt
you. We're going out to clean them Skibs." And he
waved again and the two of them went out the door.
Outside, it was cold and foggy and the cold air hit
them in the face and made them feel better. They
walked with their coats pulled up around their necks.
They walked and all the while the big one kept say
ing that he was going to clean out some Skibs, that
he had signed up that morning and that he was going
to fight for America and beat those Skibs. Then he
stopped talking, and took Skinny by the arm. Ahead
on the corner, standing by the street light, he could
see the shadow of a man. The man was smoking a cig
arette. He watched him for a second and then broke
into a run. "It's a Skib," he shouted crazily. "I'll get
him, I'll get him, Skin. I signed up and I'll get him."

I IE TOOK the little man by the shoulders and spun
him around. The little man's head barely came to
his chest. His eyes wore slanty and his face was yel
low. The cigarette had fallen from his mouth.
"You're a Skib and I'm going to kill you," said the
giant, his eyes dancing wildly, happily.
The little man was terrified. "I'm a Chinaman,"
he said. "Let go. I'm not Jap. I'm a Chinaman."
"You're a God damned lying Skib. I'm going to
kill you. I signed up,' 'he said and he' wrapped his
hands around the yellow neck. The Chinaman squealed.
And then there was a flash of silver, and then a spray
of scarlet red. The giant's throat was slashed and
opened, and the bright blood streamed out, covering
his shoulders and chest. For a second the giant stood
still, then he fell forward with a thump onto the
sidewalk. It was all quiet. The Chinaman hud dis
appeared. Skinny stood leaning on the lamp post, his
whole body shivering, his teeth chattering. The light
shined on the giant's throat, showing a hole, a terrible
opening, all red, and Skinny stood shivering, looking
at the throat. He couldn't take bis eyes off the throat.
Then lie turned and ran down the street, screaming
wildly.

built like a bear's. The other was also tall, but he
was very thin and wiry, and his legs and fingers were
long and delicate. Both wore overcoats, which they
left on, but neither of them wore hats. From their
faces you could tell that they wece still in their
early twenties.
For some time they had been in the bar. The thin
one merely sat quietly and drank. The big one drank
and swore and threw his arms around all the wait
resses, and kept continually putting nickels in the
music box and was always telling everyone how they
had both joined the navy that morning. "We're going
to go and clean out those Skibs," he kept saying.
"Skinny and me are going to ruin those Skibs, aren't
we, Skin?" And Skinny would always say, "Yes, but
drink your drink and don't make so much noise."
That had been going on for some time.

VOW the big one was standing on a chair, he had
a drink in his hand and he was leading everyone
in singing "America." He made everyone sing, and
he sang very loudly and he waved his arms wildly
and kept telling the people to sing louder. Everyone
sang except Skinny. He sat and drank. After the
song, everyone cheered and then the giant bellowed
out in a loud voice, "Doesn't anyone think that Skinny
and me aren't going to clean out those Skibs?" There
was a loud "No" from everyone. The giant satisfied
got down from the chair. "That's right," he said.
"We're going to get those Skibs." He walked around
and said goodbye to everyone, apologizing for having
to leave and then came back to his own table where
Skinny was still sitting. "Let's go," he said and he
took Skinny by the arm and lead him to the door, all
the while waving goodbye to all his friends. At the
door, he stopped and went over to one of the wait
resses, put his big hands around her waist and lifted
her up in the air and kissed her. "We're going out
to clean out the Skibs for you, darling," he shouted.
"Don't worry, Skinny and me won't let nobody hurt
you. We're going out to clean them Skibs." And he
waved again and the two of them went out the door.
Outside, it was cold and foggy and the cold air hit
them in the face and made them feel better. They
walked with their coats pulled up around their necks.
They walked and all the while the big one kept say
ing that he was going to clean out some Skibs, that
he had signed up that morning and that he was going
to fight for America and beat those Skibs. Then he
stopped talking, and took Skinny by the arm. Ahead
on the corner, standing by the street light, he could
see the shadow of a man. The man was smoking a cig
arette. He watched him for a second and then broke
into a run. "It's a Skib," he shouted crazily. "I'll get
him, I'll get him, Skin. I signed up and I'll get him."

I IE TOOK the little man by the shoulders and spun
him around. The little man's head barely came to
his chest. His eyes wore slanty and his face was yel
low. The cigarette had fallen from his mouth.
"You're a Skib and I'm going to kill you," said the
giant, his eyes dancing wildly, happily.
The little man was terrified. "I'm a Chinaman,"
he said. "Let go. I'm not Jap. I'm a Chinaman."
"You're a God damned lying Skib. I'm going to
kill you. I signed up,' 'he said and he' wrapped his
hands around the yellow neck. The Chinaman squealed.
And then there was a flash of silver, and then a spray
of scarlet red. The giant's throat was slashed and
opened, and the bright blood streamed out, covering
his shoulders and chest. For a second the giant stood
still, then he fell forward with a thump onto the
sidewalk. It was all quiet. The Chinaman hud dis
appeared. Skinny stood leaning on the lamp post, his
whole body shivering, his teeth chattering. The light
shined on the giant's throat, showing a hole, a terrible
opening, all red, and Skinny stood shivering, looking
at the throat. He couldn't take bis eyes off the throat.
Then lie turned and ran down the street, screaming
wildly.

left on, but neither of them wore hats. From their
faces you could tell that they wece still in their
early twenties.
For some time they had been in the bar. The thin
one merely sat quietly and drank. The big one drank
and swore and threw his arms around all the wait
resses, and kept continually putting nickels in the
music box and was always telling everyone how they
had both joined the navy that morning. "We're going
to go and clean out those Skibs," he kept saying.
"Skinny and me are going to ruin those Skibs, aren't
we, Skin?" And Skinny would always say, "Yes, but
drink your drink and don't make so much noise."
That had been going on for some time.

VOW the big one was standing on a chair, he had
a drink in his hand and he was leading everyone
in singing "America." He made everyone sing, and
he sang very loudly and he waved his arms wildly
and kept telling the people to sing louder. Everyone
sang except Skinny. He sat and drank. After the
song, everyone cheered and then the giant bellowed
out in a loud voice, "Doesn't anyone think that Skinny
and me aren't going to clean out those Skibs?" There
was a loud "No" from everyone. The giant satisfied
got down from the chair. "That's right," he said.
"We're going to get those Skibs." He walked around
and said goodbye to everyone, apologizing for having
to leave and then came back to his own table where
Skinny was still sitting. "Let's go," he said and he
took Skinny by the arm and lead him to the door, all
the while waving goodbye to all his friends. At the
door, he stopped and went over to one of the wait
resses, put his big hands around her waist and lifted
her up in the air and kissed her. "We're going out
to clean out the Skibs for you, darling," he shouted.
"Don't worry, Skinny and me won't let nobody hurt
you. We're going out to clean them Skibs." And he
waved again and the two of them went out the door.
Outside, it was cold and foggy and the cold air hit
them in the face and made them feel better. They
walked with their coats pulled up around their necks.
They walked and all the while the big one kept say
ing that he was going to clean out some Skibs, that
he had signed up that morning and that he was going
to fight for America and beat those Skibs. Then he
stopped talking, and took Skinny by the arm. Ahead
on the corner, standing by the street light, he could
see the shadow of a man. The man was smoking a cig
arette. He watched him for a second and then broke
into a run. "It's a Skib," he shouted crazily. "I'll get
him, I'll get him, Skin. I signed up and I'll get him."

I IE TOOK the little man by the shoulders and spun
him around. The little man's head barely came to
his chest. His eyes wore slanty and his face was yel
low. The cigarette had fallen from his mouth.
"You're a Skib and I'm going to kill you," said the
giant, his eyes dancing wildly, happily.
The little man was terrified. "I'm a Chinaman,"
he said. "Let go. I'm not Jap. I'm a Chinaman."
"You're a God damned lying Skib. I'm going to
kill you. I signed up,' 'he said and he' wrapped his
hands around the yellow neck. The Chinaman squealed.
And then there was a flash of silver, and then a spray
of scarlet red. The giant's throat was slashed and
opened, and the bright blood streamed out, covering
his shoulders and chest. For a second the giant stood
still, then he fell forward with a thump onto the
sidewalk. It was all quiet. The Chinaman hud dis
appeared. Skinny stood leaning on the lamp post, his
whole body shivering, his teeth chattering. The light
shined on the giant's throat, showing a hole, a terrible
opening, all red, and Skinny stood shivering, looking
at the throat. He couldn't take bis eyes off the throat.
Then lie turned and ran down the street, screaming
wildly.
A LITTLE STORY
r TWO of them had been in the bar for some time.
One was large, almost a giant, with huge, thick
hands, long and husky legs, and a body that was
built like a bear's. The other was also tall, but he
was very thin and wiry, and his legs and fingers were
long and delicate. Both wore overcoats, which they
left on, but neither of them wore hats. From their
