DAILY OFFENDS

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
The Daily has always been the chief exponent for
the conservation of Stanford's traditions. However,
what is the student body supposed to think when
the writers of History, 1942, and Bull Session arc seen
puffing away while walking on the sacred ground of
the Inner Quad?
Puzzled

Members of the Daily staff cannot be held re
sponsible in off hours for adherence to editorial
policy and a half-century of Stanford tradition.
If it were not for the fact that public chastise
ment should not be necessary for continuance of
a cherished tradition, we should like to print the
names of everyone—law students, professors, and
just plain students—who blithely forget every day
a wish expressed by the founders of Stanford.
Modern conditions are gradually gnawing away
at many old traditions. This is one that can be
kept without inconvenience to anyone. — The
Editor.
