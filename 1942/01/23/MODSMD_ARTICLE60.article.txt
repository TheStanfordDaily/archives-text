# Poker-Faced Gene Tierney Stalks Again
## 
### 
"SUNDOWN," now playing at the
Stanford Theater
Gene Tierney has done it again.
She's managed to get through an
other movie—and a pretty harrow
ing movie at that—with exactly one
(1) facial expression. To be sure,
she opens and shuts her mouth from
time to time, but her blank immo
bility never cracks. Amazing.
Incidentally, "Sundown" was sort
of amazing too. It had something to
do with two English army officers of
the stiff-upper-lip school, a civil
service commissioner who loves na
tives, a Nazi spy, an Italian de
serter who doesn't believe in war
(understandably so), and an Ameri
can Trader Horn.
SOME OVERTONES
All these people are milling about
Central Africa trying to save the
Empire from something which will
happen if the Shenzi tribe gets any
more guns from the Skoda works.
Miss Tierney is a halt-breed trader,
beloved of her native camel drivers,
only she really isn't—half-breed, I
mean. Some high-class Arab had
adopted her when she was only a
babe. This is so that she can marry
the commissioner without any over
tones of miscegenation.
No one can deny that Miss Tierney
is pretty (except Saroyan); and she
has never looked prettier than she
does in those pseudo-midriff out
fits of which Hollywood is so fond.
I was glad her step-daddy hadn't
put a diamond in her nose, though.
LOTS OF BLOOD
Everybody ci'awls over rocks, and
shoots at everybody. People die like
flies—the good ones, bravely, and
the bad ones like dogs. sir.
Sir Cedric Hardwicke, a fine ac
tor, is dragged in at the end to give
the goings-on timely significance.
And Joseph Calleia, George San
ders, Bruce Cabot, and Reginald
Gardiner put up a valiant fight al
though they don't seem to know
quite what all the fuss is for.—
