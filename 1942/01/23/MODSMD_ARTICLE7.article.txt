# REDS PUSH WESTWARD; NAZIS ATTACK IN LIBYA
## 
### United Press 
Soviet troops pushed the Germans
steadily westward in Russia Thurs
day and in western Europe the Royal
Air Force blasted both Germany
and Italy with bombs, but in North
Africa the Axis forces "cornered" on
the Tripolitania border turned and
attacked their British "pursuers"
with some success.

Action was general along the east
ern front. Berlin acknowledged
forceful Red attacks in the Crimea
and the Donets Basin. Moscow re
ported new progress on the Lenin
grad sector. But the heaviest fight
ing, and probably the most decisive,
was on the Moscow front west and
northwest of the capital.
