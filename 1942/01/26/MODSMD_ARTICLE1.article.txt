# History ... 1942

### AMIE REICHERT 
(Editor's note: Because Ainie
Rcichert, regular writer of History,
1942, was called home unexpect
edly last night, today's column
is written by Jean Nowell, former
author of the column.)

Dec. 7, 1941, the battle cry
of a nation has been "Remember
Pearl Harbor!" Since last Saturday
night, when the Roberts' report was
made public, that cry must have re
echoed into the brain of every man
who commands a part of the United
States armed forces in the field.
There must be many Kimmels and
many Shorts, who today are thank
ing their lucky stars that they were
not in command in Hawaii on Dec. 7;
and there may be some who are
thanking the gods on their knees
that the attack did not come under
their geographic jurisdiction.
For the facts of the case prove
that, while the Japanese initiated
the "stab in the back," or what
you will, Admiral Husband E.
Kimmcl and Lieut. Gen. Walter C.
Short were responsible for the
"stab" cutting deep and true.
"Dereliction of Duty" it's called.
But the name doesn't matter. It's all
there in Justice Roberts' report, one
damning fact after another.
* * *
\Y/E MAY assume now that the
forces of the nation will not be
caught short again. At least not that
short. But deep in the Roberts' re
port—and there by implication only
—are two facts which will bear vigi
lant observation, now, for the rest
of the war, and for the peace which,
it is hoped, will come.
First, the relationship of Kim
mcl and Short. In a sense it's the
relationship of the whole army
and navy. Short "believed" the
Navy was operating reconnaissance
flights far off shore. And Kimmcl
"thought" (he Army was operat
ing devices which could detect the
approach of planes."
Both of them had "prepared plans
which if adapted to and used for the
existing emergency would have been
adequate." That's all very fine, ex
cept that while the plans were there,
they weren't in effect. That's crim
inal, but you can pass it off as an
error in judgment. But the point is
this. Kimmel "thought" and Short
"believed." Neither of them knew.
There they were—planning away
in what amounted to a vacuum.
Why?
* * *
there's the other point.
"They refund to believe an air
attack possible." Presumably, the
two of them could read. There
had been a Rotterdam and a Dun
kirk, and a Battle of Britain, and
a Greece, and a Crete. But they
"refused to believe an air attack
possible."
And France built a Maginot line
which would have come in mighty
handy in 1914. And France didn't
have a mechanized army which
would have come in very handy in
1940. And the United States had
only one mechanized division in
1940. And we're breaking our necks
to build an air fleet second to none
now.
Gentlemen: The people of the
United States of America have
paid the money which made you
Admirals and Generals. We trust
ed you. Our lives, and more than
that, our whole way of life de
pends on you. Sure, we kicked
you around in peace time. But
you swore an oath to "protect and
defend the United States of
America."
We don't give a hoot in hell
whether the Army or the Navy runs
the show. We want to live. We
want to live the way we please.
And with your "thoughts" and your
"believeds" and you "air attacks
aren't possible" failed us.
REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR.

\Y/E MAY assume now that the

short. But deep in the Roberts' re
port—and there by implication only
—are two facts which will bear vigi
lant observation, now, for the rest
of the war, and for the peace which,
it is hoped, will come.
First, the relationship of Kim
mcl and Short. In a sense it's the
relationship of the whole army
and navy. Short "believed" the
Navy was operating reconnaissance
flights far off shore. And Kimmcl
"thought" (he Army was operat
ing devices which could detect the
approach of planes."
Both of them had "prepared plans
which if adapted to and used for the
existing emergency would have been
adequate." That's all very fine, ex
cept that while the plans were there,
they weren't in effect. That's crim
inal, but you can pass it off as an
error in judgment. But the point is
this. Kimmel "thought" and Short
"believed." Neither of them knew.
There they were—planning away
in what amounted to a vacuum.
Why?
* * *
there's the other point.
"They refund to believe an air
attack possible." Presumably, the
two of them could read. There
had been a Rotterdam and a Dun
kirk, and a Battle of Britain, and
a Greece, and a Crete. But they
"refused to believe an air attack
possible."
And France built a Maginot line
which would have come in mighty
handy in 1914. And France didn't
have a mechanized army which
would have come in very handy in
1940. And the United States had
only one mechanized division in
1940. And we're breaking our necks
to build an air fleet second to none
now.
Gentlemen: The people of the
United States of America have
paid the money which made you
Admirals and Generals. We trust
ed you. Our lives, and more than
that, our whole way of life de
pends on you. Sure, we kicked
you around in peace time. But
you swore an oath to "protect and
defend the United States of
America."
We don't give a hoot in hell
whether the Army or the Navy runs
the show. We want to live. We
want to live the way we please.
And with your "thoughts" and your
"believeds" and you "air attacks
aren't possible" failed us.

Rcichert, regular writer of History,
1942, was called home unexpect
edly last night, today's column

author of the column.)

Dec. 7, 1941, the battle cry
of a nation has been "Remember
Pearl Harbor!" Since last Saturday
night, when the Roberts' report was
made public, that cry must have re
echoed into the brain of every man
who commands a part of the United
States armed forces in the field.
There must be many Kimmels and
many Shorts, who today are thank
ing their lucky stars that they were
not in command in Hawaii on Dec. 7;
and there may be some who are
thanking the gods on their knees
that the attack did not come under
their geographic jurisdiction.
For the facts of the case prove
that, while the Japanese initiated
the "stab in the back," or what
you will, Admiral Husband E.
Kimmcl and Lieut. Gen. Walter C.
Short were responsible for the
"stab" cutting deep and true.
"Dereliction of Duty" it's called.
But the name doesn't matter. It's all
there in Justice Roberts' report, one
damning fact after another.
* * *
\Y/E MAY assume now that the
forces of the nation will not be
caught short again. At least not that
short. But deep in the Roberts' re
port—and there by implication only
—are two facts which will bear vigi
lant observation, now, for the rest
of the war, and for the peace which,
it is hoped, will come.
First, the relationship of Kim
mcl and Short. In a sense it's the
relationship of the whole army
and navy. Short "believed" the
Navy was operating reconnaissance
flights far off shore. And Kimmcl
"thought" (he Army was operat
ing devices which could detect the
approach of planes."
Both of them had "prepared plans
which if adapted to and used for the
existing emergency would have been
adequate." That's all very fine, ex
cept that while the plans were there,
they weren't in effect. That's crim
inal, but you can pass it off as an
