# Econ Men To Speak Tomorrow
## 
### 
Inflation will be examined in all
its aspects by four Stanford faculty
authorities at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow in
Memorial Hall on the Tuesday Series
program.
Serving as chairman for this sym
posium on "Can We Control Infla
tion" will be Professor Bernard F.
Haley, head of the Department of
Economics. Others participating will
be Professor George W. Dowrie, pro
fessor of finance in the Gradaute
School of Business; Prof. Elmer D.
Fagan, professor of economics; and
Prof. Theodore J. Kreps, professor
of business economics in the School
of Business.
The committe on public exercises
emphasized that no subject, except
war itself, is so vital at present to
every citizen and his family, and to
every institution, including univer
sities, for inflation threatens the
financial foundations on which insti
tutions and individual lives rest.
Although inflation is a problem for
experts, the solving of the problem
depends upon the action of citizens
in general. The speakers are ex
perts in these various fields of study,
but they will direct their talks to the
students and laymen tomorrow
night, the committee said.
