# Volunteers Bag Defense Sand In Record Time
## Six 30-Pound Of Sand Go to Each Campus Living Croup 
### 
Showing remarkable speed and
co-ordination, four fraternity sand
bag teams tore into a carload of
"defense" sand last week and filled
two thousand 30-pound bags with
thirty-two tons of sand in a few
hours.
Dr. Bailey Willis, who was in
charge of the man-sized job of han
dling 64,000 pounds of sand, or
ganized volunteer student aid who
put in 84 man hours last Thursday
afternoon.
SPEEDY WORKERS
According to Dr. Willis, the four
volunteer fraternity outfits, S.A.E.'s,
Phi Delts, Betas, and D.U.'s, looked
like competing teams trying to "score
a touchdown." Two leading teams
reached the point of factory-like
precision where they were turning
out 2Vi bags a minute. One team
finally reached a peak of 3 bags per
minute.
And before the other teams could
reach that rate, the job was over.
The sand, brought in from the
Monterey peninsula, will be used
for local defense purposes. Six bags
of 30 pounds each will be distrib
uted to each house on the campus
without charge. The bags were pre
pared by girls under the direction of
Patricia Daniels.
CAMPUS VOLUNTEERS
All over the campus students
turned in volunteer services. A
total of 72 hours was contributed to
the Office of Civilian Dcf>-i e. Miss
Betty Lou Card of Gamma Phi had
charge of student volunteer office
of Civilian Defense. Miss Betty Lou
Card of Gamma Phi had charge of
student volunteer office help. At the
Memorial Theater last week, 36
women volunteers were working to
put over the motion pictures on
Britain's defense.
"This all indicates how well the
community is co-operating in de
fense work," said Frank Walker, de
fense head.
