WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP).—
The United States has concluded
agreements with 16 Latin American
Republics, calling for mutual sus

high government official disclosed
tonight.
The agreements were negotiated at
the current conference of Latin
American Foreign Ministers at Rio
de Janeiro.
Only four republics — Argentina,
Brazil, Chile and Ecuador—have not
yet signed the agreements, to remain
in effect for the duration, but Brazil
and Chile are expected to adhere to
the compact momentarily, it was said.
