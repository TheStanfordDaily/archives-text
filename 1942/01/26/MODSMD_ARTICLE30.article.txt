Thirty-five years of engineering
experience will be recounted tonight
when Mr. li. H. Hall, chief engineer
of Standard Oil of California, speaks
on the subject, "Engineering and
Production," at 7 p.m. in the Encina
lobby. This is the third of a series
of six vocational guidance talks
sponsored by Me n's Voeom and the
Dean's ollice.
Because of his long experience
and his position with the oil com
pany, Mi 1 . Hall is able to speak with
auii'ority on both engineering and
production. His field is not limited
to petroleum engineering, but he can
a!:.o answer questions on chemical,
mechanical, and civil engineering. In
i'"aid to production, Mr, Hall will
discuss and answer questions con
cerning management, accounting, and
personnel departments of the oil
