# 'Independents' Enjoy Everything But Orals
## 
### MARGIE DORRIS 
So you think finals are gruesome, especially finals in five-unit courses?
Hew would you feel if. instead of five units, you had !>t) units of work at
stake? That is what students graduating under the Stanford Independent
Study Plan have to worry about when they are ready for their oral
examination at the end of twfo years' upper division work.

We who are not on the inside
have a vague conception of Inde
pendent Study as a method of study
reserved for privileged intellectuals
or bookworms, where you don't
| have to go to class, and you don't
| have any finals. That isn't the whole
j picture. In the first place, it isn't
i the bookworm that University Plan
attracts.
CAMPUS LEADERS
If you take a list of student lead
ers, you will find a good repre
sentation of them on independent
study. A.S.S.U. President George
Jackson took almost half of his
Lower Division work outside of
class. Then there is Romie Mullany,
president, of Women's Council; Syl
via Berry, president of Roble; Rob
| ert Hammett, debate manager; Jim
Haugh, chairman of Interfraternity;
i Betty Jane Binney, Y.W.C.A. presi
| dent. These are only a few. It al
j most looks as if study and activities
[ can be mixed.
"I always wanted to read some of
those books that are on the supple
mentary reading lists in almost every
course, but never had time until I
thought of taking a special inde
j pendent reading course," said Romie
I Mullany in explaining her interest in
the Independent Study Plan. There
are lists and lists of fascinating
books that we all think would make
excellent reading if we weren't so
busy filling requirements. Accord
ing to Romie, Independent Study
takes care of this problem beauti
fully. You plan your own courses
with your faculty advisor, and pro
ceed to follow it under his little
restricting guidance.
BROWSE IN LIBRARY
"It is really quite thrilling to be
allowed to brouse through the stacks
of books in the library," says Betty
Binns, junior representative on Ex
Committee. "Although you know that
J others have done it, you feel that
' you are somehow pioneering, discov
! crirjg things that other people don't

| know. Instead of being drilled over
and over on things you have already
heard, you can skip over the fa
miliar subjects, and.fill in the gaps
I according to your self interests."
Professors are very stimulating
outside of class, Betty reports. There
is no backsliding, she says, because
the better you do one time, the more
anxious the professor is to have you
do more. Out of old independent
groups, many students have formed
informal discussion groups aside
from school work, in which they
talk about philosophies of life
which they have formed, books they
have read, politics, or the situation
of world affairs.
| COOKING TOO!
When asked what she has found
of special interest to her under the
Stanford Independent Study Plan,
Betty commented, "One thing I've
discovered is that my history pro
fessor's wife is a marvelous cook."
Some have accused the University
Plan of being extravagant, but Pro
fessor Edgar E. Robinson, chairman
| of the history department and of the
j University Committee on Inde
pendent Study, in a recent visit to

eastern institutions found "more
study and less teaching" being ad
vocated as a method of economizing
in the defense era which the col
leges and universities are facing. "Of
course it is also believed that the
student should be forced to do more
for his own intellectual develop
ment," said Mr. Robinson, "and
everywhere there is conspicuous in
crease of interest in teaching of the
individual student.
STANFORD PLAN UNIQUE
This is partly the result of the
stress laid in recent years upon tech
niques of teaching, partly the result
j of the great increases made in our
j body of subject matter. Everywhere
the Stanford Plan now, as always, is
unique in emphasizing the interest of
the student and the special program
worked out by the student and his
faculty adviser, instead of a pre
scribed program leading to so
called 'Comprehensive' examinations.
In the Stanford Plan, the student
takes an oral examination covering
the subject matter of his own proj
ect. Stanford's Plan has been re
ferred to by one of the educational
foundations as 'piece work in a ma
chine age'."

CAMPUS LEADERS
If you take a list of student lead
ers, you will find a good repre
sentation of them on independent
study. A.S.S.U. President George
Jackson took almost half of his
Lower Division work outside of
class. Then there is Romie Mullany,
president, of Women's Council; Syl
via Berry, president of Roble; Rob
| ert Hammett, debate manager; Jim
Haugh, chairman of Interfraternity;
i Betty Jane Binney, Y.W.C.A. presi
| dent. These are only a few. It al
j most looks as if study and activities
[ can be mixed.
"I always wanted to read some of
those books that are on the supple
mentary reading lists in almost every
course, but never had time until I
thought of taking a special inde
j pendent reading course," said Romie
I Mullany in explaining her interest in
the Independent Study Plan. There
are lists and lists of fascinating
books that we all think would make
excellent reading if we weren't so
busy filling requirements. Accord
ing to Romie, Independent Study
takes care of this problem beauti
fully. You plan your own courses
with your faculty advisor, and pro
ceed to follow it under his little
restricting guidance.
BROWSE IN LIBRARY
"It is really quite thrilling to be
allowed to brouse through the stacks
of books in the library," says Betty
Binns, junior representative on Ex
Committee. "Although you know that
J others have done it, you feel that
' you are somehow pioneering, discov
! crirjg things that other people don't

| know. Instead of being drilled over
and over on things you have already
heard, you can skip over the fa
miliar subjects, and.fill in the gaps
I according to your self interests."
Professors are very stimulating
outside of class, Betty reports. There
is no backsliding, she says, because
the better you do one time, the more
anxious the professor is to have you
do more. Out of old independent
groups, many students have formed
informal discussion groups aside
from school work, in which they
talk about philosophies of life
which they have formed, books they
have read, politics, or the situation
of world affairs.
| COOKING TOO!
When asked what she has found
of special interest to her under the
Stanford Independent Study Plan,
Betty commented, "One thing I've
discovered is that my history pro
fessor's wife is a marvelous cook."
Some have accused the University
Plan of being extravagant, but Pro
fessor Edgar E. Robinson, chairman
| of the history department and of the
j University Committee on Inde
pendent Study, in a recent visit to

eastern institutions found "more
study and less teaching" being ad
vocated as a method of economizing
in the defense era which the col
leges and universities are facing. "Of
course it is also believed that the
student should be forced to do more
for his own intellectual develop
ment," said Mr. Robinson, "and
everywhere there is conspicuous in
crease of interest in teaching of the
individual student.
STANFORD PLAN UNIQUE
This is partly the result of the
stress laid in recent years upon tech
niques of teaching, partly the result
j of the great increases made in our
j body of subject matter. Everywhere
the Stanford Plan now, as always, is
unique in emphasizing the interest of
the student and the special program
worked out by the student and his
faculty adviser, instead of a pre
scribed program leading to so
called 'Comprehensive' examinations.
In the Stanford Plan, the student
takes an oral examination covering
the subject matter of his own proj

foundations as 'piece work in a ma

So you think finals are gruesome, especially finals in five-unit courses?
Hew would you feel if. instead of five units, you had !>t) units of work at

Study Plan have to worry about when they are ready for their oral
examination at the end of twfo years' upper division work.

"I always wanted to read some of
those books that are on the supple
mentary reading lists in almost every
course, but never had time until I
thought of taking a special inde
j pendent reading course," said Romie
I Mullany in explaining her interest in
the Independent Study Plan. There
are lists and lists of fascinating
books that we all think would make
excellent reading if we weren't so
busy filling requirements. Accord
ing to Romie, Independent Study
takes care of this problem beauti
fully. You plan your own courses
with your faculty advisor, and pro
ceed to follow it under his little
restricting guidance.
BROWSE IN LIBRARY
"It is really quite thrilling to be
allowed to brouse through the stacks
of books in the library," says Betty
Binns, junior representative on Ex
Committee. "Although you know that
J others have done it, you feel that
' you are somehow pioneering, discov
! crirjg things that other people don't

| know. Instead of being drilled over
and over on things you have already
heard, you can skip over the fa
miliar subjects, and.fill in the gaps
I according to your self interests."
Professors are very stimulating
outside of class, Betty reports. There
is no backsliding, she says, because
the better you do one time, the more
anxious the professor is to have you
do more. Out of old independent
groups, many students have formed
informal discussion groups aside
from school work, in which they
talk about philosophies of life
which they have formed, books they
have read, politics, or the situation
of world affairs.
| COOKING TOO!
When asked what she has found
of special interest to her under the
Stanford Independent Study Plan,
Betty commented, "One thing I've
discovered is that my history pro
fessor's wife is a marvelous cook."
Some have accused the University
Plan of being extravagant, but Pro
fessor Edgar E. Robinson, chairman
| of the history department and of the
j University Committee on Inde
pendent Study, in a recent visit to

eastern institutions found "more
study and less teaching" being ad
vocated as a method of economizing
in the defense era which the col
leges and universities are facing. "Of
course it is also believed that the
student should be forced to do more
for his own intellectual develop
ment," said Mr. Robinson, "and
everywhere there is conspicuous in
crease of interest in teaching of the
individual student.
STANFORD PLAN UNIQUE
This is partly the result of the
stress laid in recent years upon tech
niques of teaching, partly the result
j of the great increases made in our
j body of subject matter. Everywhere
the Stanford Plan now, as always, is
unique in emphasizing the interest of
the student and the special program
worked out by the student and his
faculty adviser, instead of a pre
scribed program leading to so
called 'Comprehensive' examinations.
In the Stanford Plan, the student
takes an oral examination covering
the subject matter of his own proj
ect. Stanford's Plan has been re
ferred to by one of the educational
foundations as 'piece work in a ma
chine age'."
So you think finals are gruesome, especially finals in five-unit courses?
Hew would you feel if. instead of five units, you had !>t) units of work at
stake? That is what students graduating under the Stanford Independent
Study Plan have to worry about when they are ready for their oral
examination at the end of twfo years' upper division work.

We who are not on the inside
have a vague conception of Inde
pendent Study as a method of study
reserved for privileged intellectuals
or bookworms, where you don't
| have to go to class, and you don't
| have any finals. That isn't the whole
j picture. In the first place, it isn't
i the bookworm that University Plan
attracts.
CAMPUS LEADERS
If you take a list of student lead
ers, you will find a good repre
sentation of them on independent
study. A.S.S.U. President George
Jackson took almost half of his
Lower Division work outside of
class. Then there is Romie Mullany,
