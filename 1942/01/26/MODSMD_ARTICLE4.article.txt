# Dispute Over Frosh Athletes' Varsity Eligibility Increases
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 2"> (UP). —A lively dispute in the Pacific Coa vl Con
ference over the question of freshman eligibility for wartime varsity ath
letics was forecast today in a United Press nationwide poll of colleges.
The survey revealed robust differences of opinion among the 10 members
of the Coast Conference, which will attempt to decide the issue at its

meeting in June.
Stanford, Montana, and Idaho
would welcome first-year varsity
participation, and Southern Califor
nia and Oieguii State — the Hose
Bowl victor—though still uncertain,
are expected to jump onto the frosh
bandwagon. However, California,
Washington, U.C.L.A., Oregon, and
Washington State arc opposed, par
ticularly California, whose presi
dent, Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, has
made vigorous statements against it.
U P. POLLS 82
Fuel doubtless will be added to the
Coast dispute before June by the
rapid rise of sentiment favoring the
freshmen in other sections.
The poll of 82 representative col
leges throughout the country showed
41 favoring the frosh, 27 against and
14 uncertain. Virtually all of the 14
on the fcnce indicated that they, too,
were swaying a bit toward the
"Harvard Plan" of freshman partici
pation.
Stanford apparently is leading the
Coast campaign for the freshmen.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur is re
ported backing it heartily, and Grad
uate Manager A1 Masters said: "Yes,
we favor freshman participation in
varsity competition during the em
ergency —but only during the em
ergency."
ONLY TEMPORARY
In accord with Stanford, Athletic
Director George W. Greene of Idaho
said: "The temporary ban on the
freshman rule would be a decided
boost for the smaller schools." Like
wise Coach Doug Fessenden of Mon
tana said: "Many teams, especially
those of smaller schools, will require
freshman players to carry on if
present conditions continued." Both
emphasized that it should be only a
temporary measure.
WASHINGTON FROWNS
However, Washington — strongly
opposed, like California—will "do all
it can to maintain normal condi
tions," according to Athletic Director
Ray Eckman.
"Freshmen have a very definite
place in the University," Eckman
sfiid. "They must go through a dif
ficult adjustment period from high
school to university life. They must
be encouraged to put as much effort
on scholarship in their first year as
possible, without too much em
phasis on athletics."
FOUR TO ONE
The survey indicated clearly that
there will be no frosh participation
in Big Ten varsity athletics, at least
not during 1942. Of five schools
polled in that western conference.
Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin and
Northwestern showed that they were
opposed, while Minnesota, through
its basketball coach—Dave MacMil
lan—favored it.
Herbert O. (Fritz) Crisler, ath
letic director and football coach at
Michigan, said: "I hope we don't
have to play freshmen. It would
lend itself to and invite proselyting
to a degree unknown at the present
time."

Fuel doubtless will be added to the
Coast dispute before June by the
rapid rise of sentiment favoring the
freshmen in other sections.
The poll of 82 representative col
leges throughout the country showed
41 favoring the frosh, 27 against and
14 uncertain. Virtually all of the 14
on the fcnce indicated that they, too,
were swaying a bit toward the
"Harvard Plan" of freshman partici
pation.
Stanford apparently is leading the
Coast campaign for the freshmen.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur is re
ported backing it heartily, and Grad

we favor freshman participation in
varsity competition during the em

ergency."
ONLY TEMPORARY
In accord with Stanford, Athletic
Director George W. Greene of Idaho
said: "The temporary ban on the
freshman rule would be a decided
boost for the smaller schools." Like
wise Coach Doug Fessenden of Mon
tana said: "Many teams, especially
those of smaller schools, will require
freshman players to carry on if
present conditions continued." Both
emphasized that it should be only a
temporary measure.

However, Washington — strongly
opposed, like California—will "do all
it can to maintain normal condi

Ray Eckman.
"Freshmen have a very definite
place in the University," Eckman
sfiid. "They must go through a dif
ficult adjustment period from high
school to university life. They must
be encouraged to put as much effort
on scholarship in their first year as
possible, without too much em
phasis on athletics."

Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin and

NEW YORK, Jan. 2"> (UP). —A lively dispute in the Pacific Coa vl Con

The survey revealed robust differences of opinion among the 10 members
of the Coast Conference, which will attempt to decide the issue at its

Stanford, Montana, and Idaho
