### DON SELBY 
STANFORD'S basket ball team was
great Friday night in defeating
the California (iohlen Bears by a
51-35 count.
But Nibs Price's cagers were just
as poet* as the Indians were good.
Never since we have been witness
ing the Cal-Stanford hoop series
have we seen a California quintet
that played as sloppy ball as the
Bears did Friday night.
II Don Burness had been at all hot
on his shooting, there's no telling
how bad Cal would have been
snowed under. It was bad enough
from their point of view as it was.
Burness, of course, is usually Stan
ford's leading point-maker. Although
the nine points he did mark up
aren't to be sneezed at and have
taken high scoring honors in more
than one game, that figure wasn't
up to Don's par in view of the
number of shots he had.
From where we sit, Stanford can
not figure to roll over the Bears
as easily the next time the Big Game
rivals meel on the hardwood, for
Cal certainly should bo much better.
As a matter of fact, the Bears' vic
tory over Santa Clara Saturday night
gave evidence that they were shak
ing off the doldrums they were in
..gainst Stanford.
Very seldom do you see a Cal
team that lets the opposition set the
pace. But that's just what Everett
Dean's boys did Friday night, and
they had the game under control all
the way through.

AT the beginning of the hoop sen
son we went on record as being
of the opinion that Burness was the
hist of the super-smooth Indian cag
ers of the type that made up last
year's team. However, the playing
of Howie Dallmar and Jim Pollard
in the Cal game is evidence enough
that they are accomplished basket
bailers and a great deal more clever
than you would expect sophomores
to be.
The way they can fake the op
position out of position and the
way they can handle the hall
proves that this year's Stanford
quintet is not just a tall team luit
an extremely smooth-functioning
outfit as well.
Last season there wasn't a team
in the conference that could hold a
candle to the Cards when it came to
hall handling and effortless execu
tion of intricate maneuvers and, al
though we haven't seen Ucla or
U.S.C. play a game yet, we'd be
willing to bet that the situation will
be the same this season. Which isn't
saying that the Cards will cop every
game, for it takes more than clever
ness to accomplish that feat, exam
ples of which fact were the two de
feats handed the Indians by Ucla
and Cal last season.
But if the Indians can continue to
hit the bucket with reasonable regu
larity, they should go a long way;
for the rest of their game is tops.
That single victory over California
makes the southern division stand
ings look like this:
W. L.
Stanford 1 0
U.S.C 2 1
California 1 2
U.C.L.A n 1

from their point of view as it was.
Burness, of course, is usually Stan
ford's leading point-maker. Although
the nine points he did mark up
aren't to be sneezed at and have
taken high scoring honors in more
than one game, that figure wasn't
up to Don's par in view of the
number of shots he had.
From where we sit, Stanford can
not figure to roll over the Bears
as easily the next time the Big Game
rivals meel on the hardwood, for
Cal certainly should bo much better.
As a matter of fact, the Bears' vic
tory over Santa Clara Saturday night
gave evidence that they were shak
ing off the doldrums they were in
..gainst Stanford.
Very seldom do you see a Cal
team that lets the opposition set the
pace. But that's just what Everett
Dean's boys did Friday night, and
they had the game under control all
the way through.

AT the beginning of the hoop sen
son we went on record as being
of the opinion that Burness was the
hist of the super-smooth Indian cag
ers of the type that made up last
year's team. However, the playing
of Howie Dallmar and Jim Pollard
in the Cal game is evidence enough
that they are accomplished basket
bailers and a great deal more clever
than you would expect sophomores
to be.
The way they can fake the op
position out of position and the
way they can handle the hall
proves that this year's Stanford
quintet is not just a tall team luit
an extremely smooth-functioning
outfit as well.
Last season there wasn't a team
in the conference that could hold a
candle to the Cards when it came to
hall handling and effortless execu
tion of intricate maneuvers and, al
though we haven't seen Ucla or
U.S.C. play a game yet, we'd be
willing to bet that the situation will
be the same this season. Which isn't
saying that the Cards will cop every
game, for it takes more than clever
ness to accomplish that feat, exam
ples of which fact were the two de
feats handed the Indians by Ucla
and Cal last season.
But if the Indians can continue to
hit the bucket with reasonable regu
larity, they should go a long way;
for the rest of their game is tops.
That single victory over California
makes the southern division stand
ings look like this:
W. L.
Stanford 1 0
U.S.C 2 1
California 1 2
U.C.L.A n 1
STANFORD'S basket ball team was
great Friday night in defeating
the California (iohlen Bears by a
51-35 count.
But Nibs Price's cagers were just
as poet* as the Indians were good.
Never since we have been witness
ing the Cal-Stanford hoop series
have we seen a California quintet
that played as sloppy ball as the
Bears did Friday night.
II Don Burness had been at all hot
on his shooting, there's no telling
how bad Cal would have been
snowed under. It was bad enough
from their point of view as it was.
