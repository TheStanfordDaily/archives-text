# Millrose Meet Draws Stars
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 25 (UP).-Not
until the Millrose games scheduled
for Madison Square Garden on Fob. 7
will East meet West as far as track
and field champions are concerned,
but if the performances at the an
nual senior metropolitan champion
ship are any indication of what's to
tome, il should be worth waiting two
weeks for.
Normally, the Western contingent
- headed by the cream of the Big
Ten's championship roster — would
meet Eastern titleholders at Boston's
annual Knights of Columbus meet
but this event has been canceled be
cause of the military ban on the
Use of armories.
Campbell Kane, <Roy Wilt and Roy
Cochran and a powerful team for
the two-mile relay head a strong
entry from the University of In
diana. Kane, N.C.A.A. half - mile
champion and Big Ten ruler at 880
yards and a mile, will run in either
Ihe Wanamaker mile or the Mill -
fose BSO. Wilt, the N.C.A.A. two
mile king, will compete against Greg
Rice and his crew in the two-mile
event. Cochran, Big Ten indoor and
outdoor holder at 440 yards, will
attempt to repeat in the Mel Shep
pard fiOO. Kane will also anchor the
crack two-mile relay team.
•Other outstanding entries include
Notre Dame's mile relay team which
will run in the East for the first time,
Keith O'Rourke, Noire Dame's all
time record-holder in the high jump
—six feet 7 7 ,« inches—and Michi
gan's two-mile relay team which won
here a year ago.
The East will contribute its usual
banner crop of stars who—paced by
Leslie MacMitchell, the miler, and
Rice, the thrce-miler—got the sea
son off to a fast start by shattering i
one world record and five champion
ship marks at the Bronx Coliseum
Saturday night.
A capacity crowd of fi.OOO watched |
MacMitchell pare 3 3-10 seconds I
from the title standard with a 4:13.3 I
clocking on the nine-lap oval and !
Rice eome through with a 14:10.7 j
performance in the three miles to j
erase the meet mark of 14:34.
