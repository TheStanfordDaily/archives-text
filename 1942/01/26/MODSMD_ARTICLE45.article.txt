# Indian Hoopsters Rout Cal, Lead Conference
## 
### 
One game and Stanford rides atop the conference cage heap.
Big Game rivalry moved into the Pavilion Friday night and the Indian's rebate paid off
like 10 bookstores as they opened their defense of the southern division title with a spar
kling 51-35 rout over California. But last year's champs will be forced to play the same
game every day of the week if they expect to repeat this season.
From the stands every man on Coach Everett Dean's club did everything that was ex-

pected of him. Those inconsistent
Hashes of floor and shooting bril
liancy which were seen so infre
quently during the practice sched
ule mushroomed into full force.
Center Ed Voss and Jimmy Pol
lard were the heavy bombers of the
evening, scoring 17 points each. Voss
had 14 when the first half ended with
Stanford in front, 29-16. Big Eddie
converted 8 out of 15 tries. Pol
lard notched 4 out of 9 attempts in
the first period and 4 out of 6 in
the finale. Both scored the odd point
on free throws.
Usually high-scoring Don Bur
ness tried 12 shots from the floor
and bucketed only 3. Burness' south
paw push rimmed the basket on sev
eral occasions and with a little
backboard luck would have dropped
through. He had 3 out of 4 at the
free throw line for a 9 total.
COWDEN, DALLMAR FEED
Though Howie Dallmar and Bill
Cowden weren't as potent at the
bucket as their teammates, the two
regular guards played the feeding
part of the contest and the digestion
was terrific.
Unable to remember all the
beautiful scoring setups, this re
porter can only say that they were
steady rather than spotty, and the
same goes for the Redskins' back
board control. The G-foot-4 Dean
men handled SO per cent of the
backboard balls, at both ends of
the court.
Skyscraping the Bears by two
inches per man, Stanford's compact
defense setup kept the Cal sharp
shooters away from the basket, most
of their shots coming from 20 and
30 feet out. Bob Alameida and Merv
Lafaille tallied seven each for the
Gold and Blue.
FARLEY STILL GREEN
Bill Farley, of the awful fresh
Mcis, appeared still green and should
improve as Cal pushes on through
the season. The Bears came back
Saturday night and walloped Santa
Clara by 20 pointsâ€”so they're not
through yet either.
So Stanford leaped its first con
ference hurdle with room to spare.
Oil that win, and rightly so. too
many sportswriters will imme
diately vote the Indians as most
likely to succeed in '42. But sit
fight and wait for Ucla and G.S.C.
The Stanford-Bruin series starts
in the Pavilion next Friday and
Saturday nights.
Doughty Ucla tried to beat a 36-
game jinx tw<s weeks ago when they
met the Trojans.
But down went brother Bruin to
the bottom of Westwood as Troy
won again.
ALSHULER TOPS
Led by fiery Ernie Handelsman
and Bob Alshuler, the steadiest play
er on the squad, the team features a
fast breaking attack with the guards
and center shooting almost as much
as the forwards.
Before the Trojan nemesis the
Bruins had won three and lost six
practice encounters. One of these
victories was over Santa Clara, when
the southerners broke a scoring rec
ord by racking up 67 points.
