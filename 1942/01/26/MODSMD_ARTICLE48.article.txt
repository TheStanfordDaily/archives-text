# Varsity, Frosh Mermen Take Surprise Wins from S.F. 'Y'
## 
### 
In their first meet of the season, the Stanford varsity and frefchman
swimming teams scored a mild surprise here Saturday afternoon by taking
both halves of a double dual meet against the San Francisco Y.M.C.A.
mermen, the freshmen winning 47 to 24, and the varsity 39 to 26.
On the basis of past performances, the freshmen and the "Y" were

slated to fight it out on even terms
while the war-riddled varsity was
losing its engagement. However, it
seemed that the "Y" had its defense
troubles also, and its lack of reserve
strength hurt it somewhat.
Although the "Y" lacked its bal
ance of last year, according to Coach
Nort Thornton, all its best men were
back; and the Farm swimmers
earned their victory. The Encina
men copped six of the nine first
places, the vai'sity two, while the
Golden Gaters had to be content with
a victory in the final relay.
One of the top performances of the
meet was turned in by Dick Narver,
freshman swimmer, who came out of
the rest home to win the 220-yard
free style race from Phil Delano,
Y.M.C.A. swimmer, and Ted Mun
roe, varsity, in 2:21.6, the best time
of his life.
Jerry Greer and Bill Beamer, in

In their first meet of the season, the Stanford varsity and frefchman
swimming teams scored a mild surprise here Saturday afternoon by taking
both halves of a double dual meet against the San Francisco Y.M.C.A.
mermen, the freshmen winning 47 to 24, and the varsity 39 to 26.
On the basis of past performances, the freshmen and the "Y" were

slated to fight it out on even terms
while the war-riddled varsity was
losing its engagement. However, it
seemed that the "Y" had its defense
troubles also, and its lack of reserve
strength hurt it somewhat.
Although the "Y" lacked its bal
ance of last year, according to Coach
Nort Thornton, all its best men were
back; and the Farm swimmers
earned their victory. The Encina
men copped six of the nine first
places, the vai'sity two, while the
Golden Gaters had to be content with
a victory in the final relay.
