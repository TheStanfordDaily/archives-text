## Card Frosh Face Stiff Cage Season 
### 
Plenty of basketball is left in Phil
Bengtson's 1941 freshman hoop team
as it gets further along in a season's
schedule that will bring it increas
ingly better competition.
Despite rest periods like the Gali
leo tea party Friday, the frosh are
capable of meeting and thumping
sterner stud such as the Menlo J.C.
team that comes to the Farm Friday
night, and the Palo Alto High quint
that comes Saturday. The Paly boys
have scrimmaged with the Encina
men twice this year in practice ses
sions, and both times the tall,
stringy lads from the other side of
the underpass have kept the locals
on their respective toes.
GALILEO LION YVEAK
The Galileo Lion turned out to
have very few teeth as anticipated,
the freshmen hooping points almost
at will for their easiest win thus far.
Dave Brown continued his sterling
play at guard spot, dumping four
buckets for scoring honors. Bar
socchini, Hall, Ferroggiaro, and
Woodard all flipped two goals apiece,
Pat Harwood, and Parsons one each,
and assorted frosh flipped a number
of free throws to swell the total.
The Stanfordites led 10 to 14 after
a ragged first half. In the third
quarter and a good part of the
fourth, the Lions couldn't penetrate
the Card defense for a single point,
while the frosh boosted their count
to 150. Then the Lions got one bucket
and a free throw to bring their
count to 17. while the Papeese added
an equal number to collect the final
33.
lIEALD'S KNEE BETTER
It was the third stx-aight defeat for
the Galileans, who were paced by
forward Pete Lum and Guard "Slick"
Jones. Touted center Ed Dalley of
the visitors could not make the trip
at the last moment.
Jack Heald started the game at
center and got about a quarter out
of his injured knee. The pivot man
ought to be ready for full duty
Friday.
