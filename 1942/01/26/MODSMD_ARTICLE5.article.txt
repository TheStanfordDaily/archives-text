outs, might have caused the end of
off-cainpus dances, and might have
caused the farewell to big-name
bands, but when that slovenly crew
of water-baggers from Encina dared
to challenge Robleites to debate on j
the question, "Resolved: That for the j
duration of the war women should
pay half of all date expenses," that's
carrying the national emergency just
a bit too far. The honor of woman
hood must be defended . . . and
their pocketbooks, too!"
The dare has been accepted. The
