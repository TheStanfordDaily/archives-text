# Mural Cagers Fight for Lead
## 
### 
The Zetes will clash with the
Chi Psi squad in tonight's mural
basketball competition in a game
that will decide the leadership in
League 6. Second big game of the
evening will he the Phi Psi I game
with the Dekes.

The frosh hoop squad will play
Menlo J.C. tonight at 7 o'clock in the

soon after 8 p.m. as possible.
