# Rumor and the Fool
## 
### 
SORORITY rushing and pledging brought
with it this year another new system and
also much speculation on how the plan would
work. More than that, during the telescoped
10-day rush period, came a flood of rumor.
Rumor never does much good. In this case,
rumor did its best to defeat the chances of
success for the new rushing system. It was
dangerous and vicious.
There are some iniquities of sorority rushing
which it seems impossible to eliminate. Not
many will deny the houses are guilty of a
"false front," that Roble is always somewhat
upset mentally following a rushing period, that
study is temporarily forgotten, that hashers in
sororities sometimes work overtime, that so
rority women themselves find it hard to hit the
books after a rush period or a turbulent house
meeting.
These things you have to take in stride.
There's not much that can be done about them—
just part ol the game.
This time rumor insisted that at least one
house was encouraging twice the number of
women they would be allowed to pledge un
der quota limitations. Apparently this was not
true.
Eut it is true that only one house filled its
quota. The reason is hazy. Perhaps it is be
cause certain rushees favored house A instead
of house B, which latter house wanted them
and then cut them before they had time to get
back on the list. Here again is rumor. But
let's find the reason now that pledging is fin
ished. Perhaps the houses were reticent in
pledging women fast enough to fill their quota
in 10 days . . . maybe they didn't have enough
time to be sure of the women they wanted.
A good deal of late pledging may result be
cause quotas were not filled. This is probably
all right—at least the bothersome rushing is
over and done with in 10 days.
It is not known definitely whether certain
men busied themselves with the affairs of
sorority pledging this year—that is, promoting
this woman for that house. It happened last
year. The names of these men were recorded
in minutes of the Pan-Hellenic Council. The
fool who thinks it necessary to bother with this
business certainly must have something bet
ter to do with his time. It is none of his busi
ness, the women lose respect for him, and he
cannot be condemned too severely.
Undoubtedly Pan-Hell President Barbara Rapp
will suggest whatever improvements she thinks
necessary to next year's chief. She did a whale
of a job on rushing—one of the most important
contributions was supervision of the improved
bidding plan—and she deserves a load of
thanks.—Harold Shafer

and then cut them before they had time to get
back on the list. Here again is rumor. But
let's find the reason now that pledging is fin
ished. Perhaps the houses were reticent in
pledging women fast enough to fill their quota
in 10 days . . . maybe they didn't have enough
time to be sure of the women they wanted.
A good deal of late pledging may result be
cause quotas were not filled. This is probably
all right—at least the bothersome rushing is
over and done with in 10 days.
It is not known definitely whether certain
men busied themselves with the affairs of
sorority pledging this year—that is, promoting
this woman for that house. It happened last
year. The names of these men were recorded
in minutes of the Pan-Hellenic Council. The
fool who thinks it necessary to bother with this
business certainly must have something bet
ter to do with his time. It is none of his busi
ness, the women lose respect for him, and he
cannot be condemned too severely.
Undoubtedly Pan-Hell President Barbara Rapp
will suggest whatever improvements she thinks
necessary to next year's chief. She did a whale
of a job on rushing—one of the most important
contributions was supervision of the improved
bidding plan—and she deserves a load of
thanks.—Harold Shafer
SORORITY rushing and pledging brought
with it this year another new system and
also much speculation on how the plan would
work. More than that, during the telescoped
10-day rush period, came a flood of rumor.
Rumor never does much good. In this case,
rumor did its best to defeat the chances of
success for the new rushing system. It was
dangerous and vicious.
There are some iniquities of sorority rushing
which it seems impossible to eliminate. Not
many will deny the houses are guilty of a
"false front," that Roble is always somewhat
upset mentally following a rushing period, that
study is temporarily forgotten, that hashers in
sororities sometimes work overtime, that so
rority women themselves find it hard to hit the
books after a rush period or a turbulent house
meeting.
These things you have to take in stride.
There's not much that can be done about them—
just part ol the game.
This time rumor insisted that at least one
house was encouraging twice the number of
women they would be allowed to pledge un
der quota limitations. Apparently this was not
true.
Eut it is true that only one house filled its
quota. The reason is hazy. Perhaps it is be
cause certain rushees favored house A instead
of house B, which latter house wanted them
and then cut them before they had time to get
back on the list. Here again is rumor. But
