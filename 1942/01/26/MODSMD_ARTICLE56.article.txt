# Rolling Down to Rio
## 
### 
THESE last few days, Americans have been
keeping an eagle eye on news from the Far
East, how General Mac Arthur is faring, sub
marine raiders on our coasts, deeds of our
Navy.
These stories have been getting the top ban
ner play.
More inconspicuously displayed, but far
more important to our ultimate victory against
the Axis than a couple of ship sinkings, is the
Latin American conference still going on down
in Rio de Janeiro.
Most of the news out of the conference has
had to do with the total hemisphere diplomatic
break with the Axis. But the diplomats have
been very busy on many other matters too,
though we have not been let in on all of them
yet.
Saturday night U.S. Under-Secretary of State
Sumner Welles made the following statements
to the conference:
"We have already met with the utmost
measure of success in attaining the objectives
we sought.
'We can truly say this has been a meeting
of deeds, not merely words."
These words meant a great deal more to us
last night as news came over the wire from
Waihington of one of the most sweeping ac
tions such a body could have taken in its seek
ing for hemisphere solidarityâ€”agreements be
tween the United States and 16 Latin American
countries for the "mutual suspension of tariffs
and other trade barriers" for the duration.
The situation created by these agreements
is the final and ultimate goal which Cordell Hull
has been seeking since 1934 when he initiated
the Reciprocal Trade Agreements.
These agreements are aply described by
officials as the most important "behind the
scenes" accomplishments of the conference.
With Brazil and Chile expected to sign very
soon, Argentina is the only important "hold
out."
Such a sweeping measure would never pass
through a peace-time United States Congress

because of the selfishness of some commer
cial interests, but now it comes under the head
ing of emergency war needs.
The great hope springing from these agree
ments is that they will prove so successful
during the war, when such co-operation is
sorely needed, that free trade may eventually
become a peacetime policy of the entire West
ern Hemisphere when this war is over.
It is to our advantage when we are at war.
If war proves to this country that it is to our
advantage not to selfishly discriminate against
our Latin friends when we are at peace, it will
have accomplished a superhuman but neces
sary task which otherwise would probably have
gone permanently unaccomplished.
