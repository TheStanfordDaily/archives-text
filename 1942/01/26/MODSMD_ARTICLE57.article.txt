### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
SAGA OF SAItOYAN'S TOE
it's the little tilings. The little things
that you hardly ever think about, that come to play
such an important part in this thing called life. Never
think the little things unimportant, never forget about
them, because they are important. Now I'll tell you
what happened to me.
It was about two weeks ago and 1 was trying to fit
myself in the national defense and offense program
when I noticed a sign on the Daily wall. This time
the sign wasn't asking for one-act plays, but was
asking for volunteers in the Naval Reserve. It said
that it wanted college juniors and seniors to train
and be officers. I added up my units and found that I
was a junior. The sign also said that volunteers had
to be healthy, so I asked the first live persons I saw
whether I was healthy or not. Three of them said I
was, so I confidently went up to the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco.
It was a very big building. It was grey and had
soldiers and sailors and captains and generals all over
the place. I asked the first general I saw where they
were taking V-7 volunteers. After a little argument
about the advantages of the army, he directed me to
Room 42. It was crowded. Five big handsome men
in uniforms sat at desks handling the volunteers. I
was surprised to find the men so gentle and helpful.
Making my application was easier than registering for
13 units.

my application blank, I went in for my
physical examination. My eyes could see, my ears
could hear, my teeth were strong and numerous
enough, my nose breathed sufficiently well, my legs
were able to walk, my heart was beating in the re
quired tempo and I had red blood. Everything seemed
to be going all right. I was ready to take the oath,
and I could see visions of myself on the deck of a ship,
a ship tossing in a wild storm, everyone scaled, but me
standing there in the rain, solid and rigid, shouting
orders like a machine. Then it happened.
"What's that?" said one of the generals.
"That's my little toe," I said.
"It's out of .shape. It sits up on your other toe."
"It's always been that way," I said.
"I'm afraid you can't get in V-7 with your toe like
that."
"Please, general," I said, "it hasn't bothered me. I
haven't thought about it since I was nine."
"I'm sorry. Rules, you know."
I turned to the others. "Please, generals. Can't I
get in the Naval Reserve?"
They looked at me sympathetically,, then formed a
circle and started talking among themselves, while I
stood glaring at my little toe. Two of the examiners
seemed to be on my side. The other four were against
me. But then it looked as if they had agreed favorably,
for they turned and smilingly said, "We're going to let
you do it."
"You are," I said happily and I smiled down at
my toe.
"Yes. We're going to let you cut it off."
"Cut off my toe?" I cried.
"Yes," they all said.

And so at this writing I'm sitting in tho Palo Alio
Hospital. My music box is playing The Blue Danube
again. My bear, that I always take to hospitals with
me, is sitting on the table, reading Time. Miss Crooks,
my nurse, is trying to Ret me to finish and lie down.
And my toes are nine, instead of ten. I hope this won't
make a difference between you and me.
