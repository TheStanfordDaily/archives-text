# CAMPUS OPINION
## BIG PEOPLE 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
Stanford men and women. Wonderful sounding
phrase, isn't it? The male element on the campus be
lieves it; they seem to know how to take care of
themselves. The feminine element must believe it. The
girls couldn't carry out their pseudo-sophisticated act
if they hadn't been told so many times that they were
"big girls now." So that everyone believes it except
the Olympian administration that told us it was true.
They seem to feel that the last haven for righteous
hysteria is the Stanford campus.
Franklin Roosevelt says, "Above all, use your
heads and live on a rational plane." Mrs. Roosevelt
echoes the president. LaGuardia echoes Mrs. Roose
velt, and the rest of the nation accepts the gospel and
does as it is told. But Roble and Stanford have had
their hysteria for years, and we'll be damned if we are
going to relinquish that right for anything as inconse
quential as a world war. So we won't have a good
band, and we won't be allowed to form a group to
go off campus and listen to a good band, and we won't
have senior picnics, and all the lucky leaders will get
ten times the publicity. Gee! Ain't we got fun?
Or am I wrong in thinking that the reason we can't
even fill the Sadie Hawkins dance when the girls are
paying the bills is that there isn't room on the floor
for the students and our new inhibitive policies all at
the same time? Thank God you can't hear a record
player from a Japanese airplane or we'd have out
dances in the underpass.
I would hate to see the campus bombed. America
would undoubtedly lose many future leaders, but on
the other hand, very few of the people that are des
tined to be future leaders ever gather at dance groups
anyway, and the rest of us have already paid our
tuition; further, I have heard recently from reliable
Nipponese sources that the Japs don't consider a
bombing of Stanford a powerful strategic blow at
American morale. Disillusioning, don't you think?
Please, mighty student leaders and all-powerful
faculty heads, let's devote a little of the time we've
dedicated to our heritage of hysteria to thinking. Not
only would you have all kinds of good fun, but out of
the effort might come the conclusion that we students
can be trusted to take out a girl without having to
leave a play by play description of the evening for all
to read. You might even decide, as a great many of
us have, that you are being a little stupid in this last
mental miscarriage that keeps us on our feudal domain
and then turns that feudal domain into n morgue. If I
offend, humble pardon, noble sirs, and just throw a
thunder bolt at me.
Willie
