# Cornell Slurs in Mediocre Bernstein Problem Vehicle
## 
### 
KATIIERINE CORNELL IN ROSE BURKE, now playing at the Curran
in San Francisco.
The great French dramatist, Henri Bernstein, long past his prime, is
nearing four-score and ten. Few San Francisco theatergoers knew that
his new play, "Rose Burke," written especially for (Catherine Cornell, is

his first play in English. More were,
inclined to think it was his first
play.
It may be simply that American
audiences have never been able to
understand French drama. This is
French drama. And, as one specta
tor put it, "It is a 1920 problem play
worked over to drag in the war by
its heels."
EXCEPTIONAL ACTING
The acting, however, is excep
tional. Katherine Cornell is not one
to rest on her laurels, and she does
no such resting in "Rose Burke."
But there are few scenes in the en
tire vehicle that give her opportunity
to show why she is one of the great
actresses of the modern stage.
Her biggest scene comes at the
end of the first act when she breaks
down while playing a Chopin pre
lude. This is what most actresses
make a melodramatic mess of. But
Cornell did it with delicacy, as in
fact, she did every scene. But other
intended climaxes die by the medio
crity of the play's construction. And
the breathless lines, "Take me to
your apartment," were tailspinned by
a low whistle from the gallery.
AUMONT AND MERIVALE
Besides Miss Cornell, Jean-Pierre
Aumont as the bravo Frenchman,
Marcel, and Philip Meriyale as the
self-made statesman, James Forman,
are notable. But all of the cast are
beyond reproach.
Rose Burke is a sculptress, who
fashions a statuary masterpiece.
(The statue steals the show during
most of the second act.) She is in
love with the statesman, and the
Frenchman is in love with her.
Things get not so involved, but the
idea is that the statue is the symbol
of her unhappiness.
All in all, the play is enjoyable,
though seldom impressive. But the
actors make the most of it.â€”Covey
