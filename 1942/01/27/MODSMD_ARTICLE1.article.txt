# History ... 1942

### AMIE REICHERT 
LOOKS like history is repeating
itself with lightning rapidity.
Once more the British are being
hurled back in Libya—yesterday it
was another 40 miles, which makes
all in all some 150 miles that they
have retreated from their farthest
point of westward penetration.
This is too had, because last
week the Libyan war was at a
point where it might conceivably
have been won decisively and
finally by the British—but it seems
that now the tide has once more
turned in favor of the Axis.
This past week-end General Er
win Rommel launched a counter
offensive from el-Agheila which has
steadily gained in momentum, throw
ing the British desert defenders back
daily.
Apparently Rommel received sub
stantial reinforcements last week
because for a while there he was
running toward the wrong goal with
his tail tucked between his legs, and
it looked for a second or two as
though the British might finally be
ready to score decisively.
* * *
r | , JfE past few days, however, have
seen British reverses very much
similar to Wavell's great defeat last
spring—a defeat which Auchinleck
has been trying desperately to
avenge in the past few months.
The battle on the North African
desert has progressed somewhat
like a naval battle with great tank
divisions moving as units against
one another. The opposing forces
have surged back and forth con
tinuously across the sandy bat
tlefields.
In this latest campaign the British
started out fairly well. They recap
tured Tobruck, Bengazi, and Halfaya
Pass, and drove the enemy back al
most to the Tripolitanian border,
where, unfortunately, he was closer
to his source of «upplies and rein
forcements.
* * *
r J I IIIS week those supplies and re
inforcements, long awaited by
Rommel, have apparently come
through, because the Axis has taken
over—at least temporarily.
Vast numbers of tanks, planes,
and armored cars have been
thrown into battle on the Axis
side causing the British to back
track once more.
This is no great surprise. Reports
all last week told of the massing of
units of the Luftwaffe in Southern
Italy and Sicily, and the simultane
ous air attacks on Malta which
seemed to presage a new Axis coun
ter-blow in the Middle East.
Adolf Hitler's desperate attempt
to maintain a foothold—at all costs
—in North Africa is being weighed
in the balance this moment in a
great battle near Agcdahia.
The scales are tipping in favor of
the Axis, for the British, it must be
admitted, are once more losing.
* * *
irony of it is that several days
ago the British faced their big
opportunity to deliver one last
crushing blow that would really
knock the Axis out of North Africa
—if they could only beat the rein
forcements.
They mulTed that chance appar
ently, because the reinforcements
did yet there and once more Rom
mel's Afrika Corps is on the march.
They arc giving as good as they
are getting—and then some.
It is possible that this new Axis
offensive may be the first blow of
Hitler's long-expected winter cam
paign in the Middle East. For de
spite the grave Axis need for tanks
and planes elsewhere, a steady
stream of supplies has gone to
North Africa to bolster the shaky
armies there.
Last spring the world saw VVav
ell set hack on his heels by the
Germans in Libya. If the present
drive succeeds anything like last
year's, it would certainly be a
body blow to the Allied war effort.
