# NEWS OF EXPEDITION STARTLES WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (UP).—
The news that an American expedi
tionary force—the first known to
have crossed the Atlantic since World
War I—had landed in North Ire
land electrified the Capitol tonight,
although it was not unexpected.
United States technicians have
been building powerful military
bases in Northern Ireland for the
past year, and it was assumed the
A.E.F. has been posted in those gen
eral areas.

Details as to the number of troops
landed were a guarded secret but it
was believed a large force was in
volved since the communique spoke
of "ports of embarkation'" and "dates
of sailing"—details of which Stim
son withheld.
President Roosevelt prepared the
nation for the action in his State of
the Union message to Congress on
Jan. 6.
He said American forces would be
sent all over the world and that we
shall hit the enemy "and hit him
again wherever and whenever we
can reach him."
