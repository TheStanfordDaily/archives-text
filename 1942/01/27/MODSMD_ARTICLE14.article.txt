# Row Council May Cancel Pledge Prom
## 
### 
Whether Stanford fraternities will
have their annual Pledge Prom this
year will he decided at a special
meeting of the Intel-fraternity Coun
cil tonight at 6:15 at the Phi Kap
house.
The dance, which was slated to
follow Formal Pledging, Feb. G, is
usually held in the Women's Gym.
However, according to Bud Hills,
dance chairman, the side of the
Women's Gym used by the girls'
esthetic dance group cannot be used
for the dance.
Following every dance, the floor is
sandpapered down, and the floor at
present is sandpapered down so
much that another dance will have
the floor down to the nails. One of
the floors was resurfaced at a cost
of $500 following the 1941 Pledge
Prom.
No other place on campus is large
enough to accommodate the 2,000
Row men and their dates expected
to attend the Prom.
