# You Can Register 'From Stanford'
## 
### 
Men registering on Feb. 16 for
Selective Service who have more
than one place of residence may
choose which one they want re
corded to determine the local board
which will have permanent jurisdic
tion over them, according to the
state director of Selective Service.
Registration cards will contain
spaces for both residence address
and mailing address. If the regis
trant has more than one place, he
is required to list his own choice.
The mailing address will be subject
to change when necessary, but once
the place of residence is recorded
the draft board designated will have
continuous jurisdiction.
