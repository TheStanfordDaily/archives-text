# Men to Take Physical Tests
## 
### 
The third in a series of group
physical fitness tests among college
students will begin next week, ac
cording to Dr. Craig Taylor, assist
ant professor of physiology and hy
giene. The experiments are in the
field of developing tests for assessing
the fitness of aviators.
Piesults of these tests and the
previous ones will have a direct
application to the army and navy
forces, Dr. Taylor said, and will be
tests of respiratory and cardio-vas
cular fitness.
The tests will utilize between 50
and 75 students and will be held in
two sessions of an hour each: one
hour to be spent in the Exercise
Laboratory in the basement of the
Physiology Building, and the other
hour to be spent at the track.
SOUTH ASSISTS
Assisting Dr. Taylor, who will
personally direct the experiments,
will be Glenn South and Charles
Winterburn. The experiments will
include standard exercises and blood
pressure tests, and at the same time
will contribute toward experiments
that have been going on in trying to
find tests of endurance for large
groups.
The first group test, which ended
last September, was conducted
among 100 men from Moffett Field.
The second, using Stanford students,
finished late in December. Results
of the entire series will not be re
leased until after the present emer
gency.
PARTICIPANTS SELECTED
Students who will participate in
the present test have been chosen
and will be notified this week in
time.for the first sessions, which will
begin next week and run until
March 12. Freshmen and junior
transfers who entered school last fall
and were tested at that time will be
used principally during this experi
ment. They will be exempted from
gym the day of the test.
Dr. Taylor also stressed that par
ticipation in the experiment does not
in any way obligate the student to
join the army.

cording to Dr. Craig Taylor, assist
ant professor of physiology and hy
giene. The experiments are in the
field of developing tests for assessing
the fitness of aviators.
Piesults of these tests and the
previous ones will have a direct
application to the army and navy
forces, Dr. Taylor said, and will be
tests of respiratory and cardio-vas
cular fitness.
The tests will utilize between 50
and 75 students and will be held in
two sessions of an hour each: one
hour to be spent in the Exercise
Laboratory in the basement of the
Physiology Building, and the other
hour to be spent at the track.
SOUTH ASSISTS
Assisting Dr. Taylor, who will
personally direct the experiments,
will be Glenn South and Charles
Winterburn. The experiments will
include standard exercises and blood
pressure tests, and at the same time
will contribute toward experiments
that have been going on in trying to
find tests of endurance for large
groups.
The first group test, which ended
last September, was conducted
among 100 men from Moffett Field.
The second, using Stanford students,
finished late in December. Results
of the entire series will not be re
leased until after the present emer
gency.
PARTICIPANTS SELECTED
Students who will participate in
the present test have been chosen
and will be notified this week in
time.for the first sessions, which will
begin next week and run until
March 12. Freshmen and junior
transfers who entered school last fall
and were tested at that time will be
used principally during this experi
ment. They will be exempted from
gym the day of the test.
Dr. Taylor also stressed that par
ticipation in the experiment does not
in any way obligate the student to
join the army.
