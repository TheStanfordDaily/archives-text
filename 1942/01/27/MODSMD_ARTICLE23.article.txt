JAVA (General Headquarters,
Southwest Pacific High Command of
the United Nations), Jan. 2(1 (UP). â€”
Air and sea forces of the United
Nations, in the greatest demonstra
tion of combined might since the be
ginning of the war, were revealed
today to have sunk or damaged at
least 2(5 Jap ships in a running battle
in Macassar Straits, with a toll of
perhaps 0,000 Japanese troops.
Huge American Flying Fortresses,
cruisers and destroyers were partici
pating in the battle, now raging for
more than 72 hours, dropping a wall
of fire and steel across the path of
the sea-borne invader seeking new
footholds in Celebes and Borneo.
A communique issued from Gen.
Sir Archibald Wavell's headquarters
today said that another large Japa
nese transport had been sunk and
direct hits scored on three more
cruisers and a transport in the last
24 hours. A Dutch communique,
meanwhile, said that a Dutch sub-*
marine had sunk a Jap destroyer
and torpedoed a cruiser with undis
closed results.
