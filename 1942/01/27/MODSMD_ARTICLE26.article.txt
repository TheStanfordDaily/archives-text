PHILIPPINES: ALL QUIET
(;-en. Douglas Mac Arthur enjoyed
a re latively quiet birthday, his sixty
second, on Bataan Peninsula, where
the brilliant victory of his men Sun
day in throwing back the Japanese
left wing had gained a respite for
the hard-fighting Americans and
Filipinos while the "completely dis
organized" Japanese re-formed for a
new attack.
Meanwhile, in Europe, new Rus
sian successes were reported Mon
day, with a Soviet column menac
ing Bryansk in a pincers sweep
southwest of Moscow, but in North
Africa the British admitted further
withdrawals before Axis armored
forces which have advanced 150
miles in four days.
RUSSIA: NAZIS RETREAT
The new Soviet advance formed
the southern arm of a gigantic pinc
ers aimed at biting off the whole
central sector of the German lines.
Bryansk is 220 miles southwest of
Moscow. Kholm, which the north
ern arm of the pincers reached last
week, is 260 miles northwest of the
Red capital.
Between the arms of this pincers,
225 miles west-southwest of Moscow,
is Smolensk — main Nazi rear base
toward which the Russian victors of
Mozhaisk are driving almost due
westward.
AFRICA: NAZIS ADVANCE
The latest communique from Brit
ish middle eastern headquarters at
Cairo said that Nazi Gen. Erwin
Rommel's Afrika Korps advanced
another 40 miles Sunday—making
150 miles the British have back
tracked from their point of greatest
penetration westward.
The British were fighting a rear
guard action northwest of Msus, 70
miles east-southwest of Benghazi.
London commentators said it ap
peared from Rommel's route that ho
intended to bypass the port of
Benghazi and make straight for
Mekili, important desert junction.
