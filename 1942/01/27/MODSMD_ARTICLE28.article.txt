# Two Farm Music Students Write 'Marco Millions' Songs
## 
### 
Something new has been added—to the Stanford Department of Speech
ami Drama. For the first time there is someone on the staff responsible for
music in the theater; Herbert Jan Popper. And it is two students in
Popper's Music Writing class who have composed the music for "Marco
Millions," to be presented Feb. 5, 0, and 7 in the Memorial Theater.

Miss Valborg Kjosness and Dix
Brow are the student composers who
have undertaken the difficult job of
writing the music for O'Neill's
drama. Ranging from exotic Tartar
and Hindu themes to a Venetian
love song, to lie sung by Ted Upp
man, the music must not only in
crease the dramatic effect of the
play, but act as a 60-second transi
tion from scene to scene.
The first half of each transition
alludes to (he preceding scene, and
leads into the second part, which
develops the mood into that of the
next scene. In order to tie the var
ious themes together, the composers,
who are also the orchestrators, have
made the transitions end in a single
instrument, with one exception. The
music that leads into the scene in
the court of Kublai Khan acts as a
climax, and uses full orchestra
throughout.
The orchestra will play on the
stage of the Little Theater, and the
music will be piped from there into
the main auditorium.
According to Miss Kjosness and
Dix Brow, this is the chance of a
lifetime to get their music played
before the public.
