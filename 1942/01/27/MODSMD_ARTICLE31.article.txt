# Romie Mullany Expects Grief From DST Bill
## Lockouts Foreseen When Time Changes At Midnight, Feb. 8 
### PEGGY BOOTHE 
When President Roosevelt signed
a certain bill the other day he may
have been saving daylight, but he
wasn't saving Romie Mullany any
gray hairs.
On Feb. 8 at 11 p.m., watches will ;
be advanced to 12 and daylight sav- '
ing will be in—but some unwary
Stanford females may still be out on
12 o'clock late leaves. What horrible !
fate awaits these victims of retarded
watches, those who don't realize
something new has been added?
As chairman of Women's Council,
women's judicial body, Romie Mul
lany is the logical one to answer this
$63.95 question. The chief justice
was located in the Daily Shack,
where she officiates as women's edi
tor.
THEY CAN'T DO THIS
There, buried under Blackstone,
Cushman's Leading Constitutional
Decisions, and numerous copies of
Stanford Social Regulations, Miss
Mullany was in session with herself
on the momentous matter, mutter
ing, "It's unconstitutional — they
can't do this to me." Regaining her
judicial dignity for the press, she j
expounded:
"The women of Leland Stanford j
Junior University may rest assured |
that Women's Council will act so
that they will not be deprived on
the night of Feb. 8 of life, liberty or
an hour of their late leaves."
LITTLE FUROR
Keep tuned to this newspaper for
further details. Elsewhere, on the!
campus, daylight saving seemed to j
be creating some confusion among !
the student body but little conster
nation in the academic and admin
istrative departments.
Miss Christine Ricker, head of the I
University dining halls, said nothing [
in her department will really be al
tered by the change. The switch to !
daylight saving time will make little
difference to employees like the
bakers at Encina who start work at
2 a.m. anyway.
PROTEST FILED
However, she added that one re
sult of the change would be the
elimination of any possibility of
blackouts at dinner. The members J
of Local No. 5171 of the Hashers at !
Women's Residences are expected to i
file a protest with President Roose- !
velt immediately.
For the student, the advent of
daylight saving will mean he goes to i
8 o'clocks at 7 B.D.S.T. (Before Day- |
light Saving Time), eats lunch at 11 j
B.D.S.T. and gets to bed L.A.U.
(Late As Usual).
