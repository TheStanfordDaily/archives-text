# Freshman Basketball Team Wins
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
STANFORD PAVILION, Jan. 26.
—'•A smaller but faster Stanford frosh
basketball team defeated Menlo
Junior College's varsity tonight, 33-
31, before a small but enthusiastic
crowd of 47 persons who braved a
driving storm to witness the contest.
The two teams were never more
than three points apart during the
first half. A one-hand push shot by
Otis Keeler, Menlo guard, and the
game's high scorer, brought the score
up to 14-13 in the Papooses' favor as
the half time gun went off.
Keeler, a smooth floor man as well
as a good shot, accounted for 18 of
Menlo's points, while Jack Heald,
Stanford center, led his team in
scoring with 13 points, due mainly
to his added height. Game Captain
Dave Brown shone as the outstand
ing all-around star for the winners,
scoring 7 points in addition to play
ing an excellent defensive and pass
ing game.
BIG EDGE
With the start of the second half
Coaches Bengtson and Weir's charges
scored eight straight points within
a few minutes' time in a rally that
appeared to give them a substan
tial edge. However, within another
10 minutes the Tigers had narrowed
the Cud lead back down to 3 points.
Willi three minutes left to play,
Freddie Parsons, diminutive Stan
ford forward, sank two long shots
in rapid succession to enable his team
to pull away again. But his team
mates were unable to hold onto the
ball, and Keeler led a five-point
rally that brought the visitors to
within one point of the lead. The
final gun went' off just after Fred
Ferroggiaro sunk a free throw to
bring the score up to 33-31.
REVOLVING OFFENSE
The Tigers employed a revolving
screening-offensive play similar to
that used by Santa Clara which gives
the last man in the formation a
chance for a shot just inside the key
hole, if the play is worked success
fully. However, where the Broncs
work the circle smaller and smaller,
giving their forward a close try at
the basket, the Jaysees wound up
the play without getting any closer
to the hoop, so that finally in des
peration one of the men would shoot
a long one.
The local team was handicapped
by their lack of height, since Bar
socchini, Parsons, and Ferroggiaro
were all considerably under six feet,
although the latter did get more than
his share of the rebounds. Also the
frosh depended too much on their
long shots and did not get in for
many set-ups.
