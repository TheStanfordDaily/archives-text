# Varsity Cagers Gird for Bruins
## 
### 
Coach Everett Dean pushed his
cagers through a workout yesterday
in preparation for Friday's U.C.L.A.-
Indian hoop series. From their 51-
35 win over California the Redskins
meet the Bruins, downed two weeks
ago by the Trojans for the 37th
straight time.
U.C.L.A. is the kind of a team you
dont' expect much from. They'll
lose steadily, then suddenly pop up
and knock off a top team. Up
against Santa Clara after a me
diocre vacation tour, the Bruins
slapped the Broncs around plenty
and rang up 67 points.
The Deanmen will once again be
masters of the height problem Fri
day. That tall, skyseraping defense
set-up cobbed the Bears no end and
kept them out of short range shots
all night. It could and should do
the same against brother Bruin.
Speed will be more noticeable when
the southerners take the floor. Er
nie Handelsman, short, speedy,
should lead the Bruin break from
start to finish.
Jimmy Pollard and Ed Voss
smothered the basket with 17 points
apiece against Cal and if they should
repeat with the same dead-eye ac
; curacy the Indians have a solid
| chance to come of! with a twin
week-end victory.
