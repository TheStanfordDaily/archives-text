# Boxers End Whirlwind All-U Semis
## 
### CHARLES MULL 
Close decisions and fast matches
characterized the semi-final bouts of
the All-University and Novice tour
ney yesterday afternoon in the En
clna boxing room. Coach Frye com
mented on the exceptionally good
sportsmanship and earnestness dis
played by the competitors.
The winners of yesterday's
matches will be added to the names
of the semi-final winners of Sat
urday's bouts to complete the final
card on Wednesday.
Exceptionally fust AU-U welter
weight card was decided Saturday
when Johnson Chinn, speedy veteran
of previous years, decisioned Au
brey Fairfax. This moves Chinn into
the final match to face F. Q. Hewitt,
who decisioned Reggie Vela. Hewitt
vs. Chinn promises to be the fastest
match on the card as both boys fight
in a speedy offensive style.
dickey decisions byrd
In the 165-pound Novice class Jack
Dickey, promising sophomore, de
cisioned Byrd to move into the semi
finals. Yesterday afternoon, his skill
and luck still holding out, Dickey
decisioned Darwin Sheblut and now
faces Johnny Hiskey in the final
round.
The 165-pound class in the All-U
bill holds two returning veterans
from last year, Jim Thurmond and
Ira Fishman. Fishman fought in last
year's tourney and ran into ill luck,
and this year is his final chance to
grab a golden glove. Jim is also due
for graduation and has the same de
signs on the same glove. This fight
is destined to be exceptionally well
matched and hard-fought.
LIGHT-HEAVIES
In the light-heavies is the trim
med-down heavyweight, Don Grant.
Don took the Novice title two years
ago from Bob Leaver, who won the
nod from Pete Gadd last year.
"Pounding Pete" has been trained
into top shape, and the match is
considered a toss-up.
The Novice heavyweight card is
promising. Newcomer Stan Gamel
is slated to stand toe to toe with
hard-punching Bob Dean. Gamel
easily defeated red-headed Vic Mina
ahan in the semi-finals yesterday.
All this is going to be served in
the newly blacked-out Pavilion to
morrow at 7:30 p.m. Admission is
30 cents to students and to service
men, 55 cents to the public.
