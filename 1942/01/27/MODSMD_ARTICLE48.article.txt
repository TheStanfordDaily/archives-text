r | , HE ONLY basketball team I've seen this season that looks nearly as
good as the Farm's varsity aggregation did last Friday night is the
20th Century-Fox quintet, National A.A.U. champs, and I haven't seen
them yet so I guess you know where that puts Coach Everett Dean's boys.
Speaking of the Twentieth-Centuries, after cleaning up on all of
the A.A.U. competition, they have started after the collegiate teams.
Saturday night, since U.C.L.A. had no conference game scheduled, the
Bruins played an exhibition game and lost to the movie quintet about
1)0-45, and let me say that this year's team from Westwood is not the
usual pushover that hails from those hills.
At present the conference high scorer on the basis of average points
per game is Marv Lee, Bruin sophomore center. Lee, scored 19 points
against the .Trojans three weeks ago in his only conference encounter.
Right behind this darkhorse are Jim Pollard and Ed Voss, who play for
Stanford University out near Palo Alto. These two fellas have 17 apiece
in one game also. In the matter of total points scored, Bob Ormsby, U.S.C.
forward, leads with a total slightly surpassing one score and ten, but
since he rolled up this staggering number of tallies in three games, his
average only slightly surpasses a half of a score. What's the score anyway?

/ |NE factor has kept C. Donald Saroyan from giving up in despair these
last few days what with Ram's Head, the Navy, and the Turks
haranguing at him at every turn. This single salvation has been the
thought of writing tennis this spring—not plain tennis, but championship
tennis. Stanford with its Schroeders, Dees, Neales, Wades, etc. was des
tined to smother all opposition, finally wresting the crown from the
Troy men.
But news comes from the Southland that will rock C. Donald to his
very toes, all nine of them. Returning for the Southern Califomians
are their two best men of last year, plus two excellent ex-frosh, plus
one real swell transfer. Ted Olewine and Bill Reedy, Earl Cochell and
Doug Woodbury, and George Richards are the netters in question.
Olewine and Cochell were ranked eleventh and twelfth, respectively,
last year, and now with the depletion due to the pros and the Army
they are the sixth and seventh best amateurs in the country, accord
ing to the moguls. II Richards, Woodbury, and particularly Reedy had
gone east last summer they too would have received high rankings.
All is not lost yet, but from here on in C.D. will have to fight and
fight hard.

eight o'clock.
