WILLIE wrote quite a letter yesterday. He
probably thinks it echoes the sentiments
of most of the campus. Maybe it does. But we
don't think so. Willie is just a little misinformed
and probably a little sorry that he is not a
"mighty student leader" so that he could have
blocked some of the recent actions of student
leaders.
Had he been among the student legislative
bodies which framed the war-necessitated re
visions to our social set-up, he probably would
have been just as much in favor of the changes
as were those who voted unanimously for them.
Willie just doesn't realize the scope of the
problem to be dealt with.
First of all, Willie, the cornerstone of any and
all changes which have been made or are now
contemplated, is the fact that Stanford Univer
sity (not the A.S.S.U. or any fraternity) is re
sponsible to our parents, whether we like it
or not, for our safety v/hile we are attending
the University.
In abandoning all off-campus dances, many
attended by 300 or 400 people, we are comply
ing to the letter with requests of the nation's
leaders to "use our heads and live on a rational
plane." Would it be very sensible for such a
number of students to be on their way to or
from such an affair 40 or 50 miles away from
the campus in the event of a blackout? And,
incidentally, think of the tires we will save.
And who ever said a word about senior pic
nics, Willie? The campus' 8,800 acres provide
numerous places for such affairs.
We don't think there are many of us worry
ing very much about the prospect of Stanford
getting bombed. And a lot of places in England
have not been bombed either, but all of Eng
land has been totally blacked out every night
since September 1939.
As for those new sign-out slips. We don't
think they will cause you much trouble, Willie.
And they will provide an accurate check, so
that the University won't have to tell your date's
mother over the long distance phone that they
have no idea where she was when the blackout
started.
Is it not better to make a few preparations
like this than to be caught flat-footed as Mayor
Rossi would have been that night "if any bombs
had fallen"? The French people thought they
were safe, too.
That morgue question is intriguing, Willie.
Have you ever been in a morgue? They are
pretty quiet, sordid places. If you have a few
minutes some afternoon, why don't you drop
around to Pat Adams' office and take a look at
the rather clogged campus social calendar. Not
very much like a morgue.
You do not need to pardon yourself for writ
ing that letter.
It is partially our fault for not explaining to
you the reasons for recent actions, and par
tially yours for not taking the trouble to find
out why certain things are being done.
We are not throwing a thunderbolt at you,
Willie. We are just trying to show you, and
all the other campus "Willies," why some of
their so-called "country-club privileges" have
been curtailed.

all changes which have been made or are now
contemplated, is the fact that Stanford Univer
sity (not the A.S.S.U. or any fraternity) is re
sponsible to our parents, whether we like it
or not, for our safety v/hile we are attending
the University.
In abandoning all off-campus dances, many
attended by 300 or 400 people, we are comply
ing to the letter with requests of the nation's
leaders to "use our heads and live on a rational
plane." Would it be very sensible for such a
number of students to be on their way to or
from such an affair 40 or 50 miles away from
the campus in the event of a blackout? And,
incidentally, think of the tires we will save.
And who ever said a word about senior pic
nics, Willie? The campus' 8,800 acres provide
numerous places for such affairs.
We don't think there are many of us worry
ing very much about the prospect of Stanford
getting bombed. And a lot of places in England
have not been bombed either, but all of Eng
land has been totally blacked out every night
since September 1939.
As for those new sign-out slips. We don't
think they will cause you much trouble, Willie.
And they will provide an accurate check, so
that the University won't have to tell your date's
mother over the long distance phone that they
have no idea where she was when the blackout
started.
Is it not better to make a few preparations
like this than to be caught flat-footed as Mayor
Rossi would have been that night "if any bombs
had fallen"? The French people thought they
were safe, too.
That morgue question is intriguing, Willie.
Have you ever been in a morgue? They are
pretty quiet, sordid places. If you have a few
minutes some afternoon, why don't you drop
around to Pat Adams' office and take a look at
the rather clogged campus social calendar. Not
very much like a morgue.
You do not need to pardon yourself for writ
ing that letter.
It is partially our fault for not explaining to
you the reasons for recent actions, and par
tially yours for not taking the trouble to find
out why certain things are being done.
We are not throwing a thunderbolt at you,
Willie. We are just trying to show you, and
all the other campus "Willies," why some of
their so-called "country-club privileges" have
been curtailed.
WILLIE wrote quite a letter yesterday. He
probably thinks it echoes the sentiments
of most of the campus. Maybe it does. But we
don't think so. Willie is just a little misinformed
and probably a little sorry that he is not a
"mighty student leader" so that he could have
blocked some of the recent actions of student
leaders.
Had he been among the student legislative
bodies which framed the war-necessitated re
visions to our social set-up, he probably would
have been just as much in favor of the changes
as were those who voted unanimously for them.
Willie just doesn't realize the scope of the
problem to be dealt with.
First of all, Willie, the cornerstone of any and
all changes which have been made or are now
contemplated, is the fact that Stanford Univer
sity (not the A.S.S.U. or any fraternity) is re
