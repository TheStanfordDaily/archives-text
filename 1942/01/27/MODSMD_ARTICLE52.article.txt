# (Last) Minute Men
## 
### 
THERE is a fellow in the Delta Upsilon house
now who, when he left his room in Encina
on formal pledge day in his freshman year,
was solidly in favor of the Phi Psi house.
He is not the only man who has made a simi
lar last-minute change. He decided, as have too
many other Stanford fraternity men, at the last
minute to change his house affiliation to some
other fraternity.
It was his own decision. Fortunately for him,
in his instance, his last-minute change has
proven a happy one.
But multitudinous are the fraternity men who
stood in line on formal pledge day, awaiting
their turn to say "I want to pledge Such-and-
Such," but who listened to those standing
around them. The man ahead in the line tells
him that he has made a rotten decision, or that
the house is filled with "stinkers," or a hundred
other unsavory things.
"Why don't you get on the band wagon and
jump into my house with me?" says the man
ahead.
Or a fraternity man, who the rule says is not
supposed to be anywhere near the pledge line,
sneaks in among the sheep, and bleating loudly
of greener pastures elsewhere, lures the lambs
to their death.
So at the last minute the freshman changes

his mind. He jumps into pledging another
house.
Out the window have gone weeks of careful
consideration of all the houses, weeks of care
ful, thoughtful weighing of the merits of the
many houses, weeks of narrowing his choice
down to the fewer houses which suit him—and,
finally, his evolved selection of the "best"
house for him.
What could the freshman be thinking when
he forgets all this to jump blindfolded into an
other house at the last minute? What does he
consider to be the organizational structure of
a house which has to pledge at the very brink
of the precipice?
Perhaps the words of those fraternity men
near the pledge line are too glib. Take care,
Interfraternity Council, that, in justice to the
freshmen and the fraternities in question, no
such fraternity men are allowed near, do not
get near the pledge line. An extremely effec
tive cordon of hall men, who would be more
than willing to volunteer their services, would
offer just as effective a solution to this problem.
And secondly, Interfraternity Council, if you
hold the formal pledging in the Excom room
as you did last year, it will prove doubly diffi
cult to keep the wolves from the sheep. The
wilds of Union Court offer too uncontrollable a
range for those fraternity soapbox orators—the
last-minute men.
And, freshmen, stick by your logical, time
evolved decision as to your house preference—
even if you have to stand in line with the rest
of your pledge brothers in order to lend you
moral support.—Bud Ames
