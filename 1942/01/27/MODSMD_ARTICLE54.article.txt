## THE 						STRENGTH OF THE WEAK 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
Vt/ r HEN a person is strong and healthy, and able to
move around and do things successfully, he is
apt to get awfully contented with himself. And when
a person is strong and contented, there is a tendency
to be unsympathetic with other people. It is hard for
a strong person to understand the weak, and without
understanding it is hard for him to care for the weak.
And it follows that there is also a tendency to not
care for or support the valuable things that are done
for the weak.
Then when something happens to the person, some
thing that makes him a little weak, less self-sufficient
and more dependent on others, often the person's un
derstanding grows, his perceptions increase, and his
sympathy for others also increases. For when a per
son feels weak, he is conscious of the weaknesses of
the world, conscious of the troubles of the world, and
when a person has such an understanding, then he re
alizes what it is to be a human being, what responsi
bilities and sacrifices are required, if living is to be
made at all easier.

W/HEN I was lying in the hospital with my foot
bandaged, hardly able to move, helpless to do
anything for myself, I gained some of that conscious
ness. Even the little pain that my toe gave me helped
me to understand what it meant to be weak and help
less and dependent on others. Even in the two days
that I lay there, I knew how important it was to have
someone around. And from my tiny bit of trouble, I
was able to see the really terrible suffering that must
be going on all around us all the time. I think I was
able to see the weakness, the pain, the suffering, the
agony, the terror and the loneliness of our humanity,
and to understand the value of the work that lessened
such suffering.
I think I understood what it meant to be looked
after. What it must mean to the soldiers to have
nurses ready to pour cool water through their dry,
feverish lips, to wash their aching, sticky bodies, to
fix their beds, to talk to them, to smile and to always
be there, efficient and white, always ready. I think
I saw how much it must mean to them, to the weak of
the world, to be cared for. And as soon as I get well,
I'm going to a movie so that I can put some money
in the little Red Cross tray.
