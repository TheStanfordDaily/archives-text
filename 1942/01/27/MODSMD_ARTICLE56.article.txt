# THE 						EDITOR, SIR:

### 
In an editorial last, Friday, a possible solution to
the fraternity rushing problem was suggested—that of
scrapping rushing rules. I'm all for it. To be sure, the
problem doesn't concern me directly. I am neither
rushee nor fraternity man, but I think there is reason
for those concerned to consider the policy carefully.
Were I a rushee, I should consider the present sys
tem involving a series of quarantines an insult to my
judgment. Anyone choosing his fraternity on the basis
of an ephemeral display made during rushing de
serves whatever fate befalls him, however unhappy.
I prefer to think that this danger is not grave. I like
to think that there is some correlation between pres
ence at Stanford and common sense.
Making mountains out of molehills seems to be a
common tendency these days. The trait is particularly
frequent among us young. Such minute regulation of
rushing behavior at Stanford seems to me to be a
simple manifestation of the unfortunate trend.
Sincerely,
Buzz Anderson
