# 'How Green Was My Valley' Hailed Picture of the Year
## 
### 
Once again this reviewer is going
to stick her neck out, and with 1!)42
hardly graduated into knee pants,
nominate "How Green Was My
Valley" for the best picture of the
year.
There is probably no director in
Hollywood with the ability to create
a more moving, exciting, and un
theatrical mood as John Ford. And
his direction of this film is one of
the milestones on the moving pic
tures' road to artistic integrity. Ford
has never done a poor job during
his entire Hollywood career, but
"How Green Was My Valley" tops
all his previous work, even "The
Informer." This is a director's pic
ture, and the credit must go to him
for a truly great production of Rich
ard Llewellyn's novel of a Welsh
mining town.
Featured in a superb cast are Wal
ter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, Anna
Lee, Donald Crisp, Barry Fitzgerald,
John Loder, Patric Knowles, and
Master Roddy MacDowell, who gives
a fine and sensitive performance as
Huw Morgan. But it is Sara All -
good, playing Beth Morgan for all
she is worth, who steals the picture,
in the most matter-of-fact way pos
sible.
To most movie-goers this may
come as a surprise, for Miss All
good is comparatively new to films.
But for those who saw her in the
Abbey Theater productions, and in
such New York plays as "Shadow
and Substance" and "Storm Over
Patsy," this was only to be ex
pected. Subtly—ever so subtly—she
goes through her entire bag of tricks
and emerges triumphant, even over
such an old war horse as Donald
Crisp, who is no mean competition
for our Sara.
Much credit is due Alfred New
man for his magnificent background
music, and to Arthur Miller for his

fine camera work. But it is the com
bination and integration of music,
camera, and acting by John Ford
that makes this picture great.—Liv

There is probably no director in
Hollywood with the ability to create
a more moving, exciting, and un
theatrical mood as John Ford. And
his direction of this film is one of
the milestones on the moving pic
tures' road to artistic integrity. Ford
has never done a poor job during
his entire Hollywood career, but
"How Green Was My Valley" tops
all his previous work, even "The
Informer." This is a director's pic
ture, and the credit must go to him
for a truly great production of Rich
ard Llewellyn's novel of a Welsh
mining town.
Featured in a superb cast are Wal
ter Pidgeon, Maureen O'Hara, Anna
Lee, Donald Crisp, Barry Fitzgerald,
John Loder, Patric Knowles, and
Master Roddy MacDowell, who gives
a fine and sensitive performance as
Huw Morgan. But it is Sara All -
good, playing Beth Morgan for all
she is worth, who steals the picture,
in the most matter-of-fact way pos
sible.
To most movie-goers this may
come as a surprise, for Miss All
good is comparatively new to films.
But for those who saw her in the
Abbey Theater productions, and in
such New York plays as "Shadow
and Substance" and "Storm Over
Patsy," this was only to be ex
pected. Subtly—ever so subtly—she
goes through her entire bag of tricks
and emerges triumphant, even over
such an old war horse as Donald
Crisp, who is no mean competition
for our Sara.
Much credit is due Alfred New
man for his magnificent background
music, and to Arthur Miller for his

fine camera work. But it is the com
bination and integration of music,
camera, and acting by John Ford
that makes this picture great.—Liv

Once again this reviewer is going
to stick her neck out, and with 1!)42
hardly graduated into knee pants,
nominate "How Green Was My
Valley" for the best picture of the
year.
