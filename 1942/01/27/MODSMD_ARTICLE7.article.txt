# Hall Outlines Success Angles

### 
Dividing his address into three
phases, H. H. Hall, chief engineer
for the Standard Oil Company of
California, last night in Encina
lobby discussed: the desirability of
engineering as a profession, how a
person can tell if he has the aptitude
to succeed, and what curricular
preparations an engineering major
should make. This was the third in
a series of six vocational guidance
programs sponsored by Men's Vo
com and the Dean of Men's office.
"Engineering is a desirable pro
fession for two reasons," said the
chief engineer. "It is a useful ap
plication of science, and secondly, it
brings satisfaction to see tangible
and worthwhile benefits."
According to Mr. Hall, an en
gineering major can judge his
chances for success by "simple self
analysis." He must be able to solve
problems by thorough reasoning, he
must be able to express himself
orally without any trouble, and he
must be able to write.
Mr. Hall suggested numerous prep
arations future engineers should
make. First, they should learn how
to make friends. Second, the engi
neering department should insist
that all majors take public speak
ing courses, "because they must con
stantly associate with other people."
Third, technical courses should re
quire that students explain the
"why" of problems. Fourth, the
University should require that all
engineering majors take at least a
three-month course in labor prob
lems. Lastly, Mr. Hall stated that no
university should allow students to
take postgraduate work unless they
have demonstrated extraordinary
ability.
