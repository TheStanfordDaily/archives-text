# YANKS REACH IRELAND
## A.E.F., Several Thousand Strong, Lands in Ulster After Uneventful Crossing 
### 
A NORTH IRELAND PORT, Jan. 26 (UP).—A new
A.E.F., several thousand strong and made up mostly of young
men from the farms and towns of lowa and Minnesota, landed
today in Europe and marched with free-swinging but busi
nesslike gait through ancient Irish streets to camps prepared
for them months in advance with lend-lease funds.
They came in transports which crossed the embattled At
lantic without a loss, to drop anchor off this port at dawn. An
old channel steamer shuttled them from the transports to the
pier and they sprang down the gangplank into a bleak old
freight shed, embellished for the occasion with about $2 worth
of bunting.
ULSTERMEN SURPRISED, NOT STIRRED
They took the population of the town by surprise but
caused little stir among the undemonstrative Ulsterman.
A Royal Ulster Rifles band struck up "God Save the King,"
and then "The Stars and Stripes Forever," to sound the first
official greeting. The music was all but drowned out by the
piercing whistles of soldiers lining the ship's rail.
Rifles slung loosely from the shoulders, their free and easy
pace in marked contrast to the exaggerated arm-swinging
march of the British, the Americans moved along on silent
rubber heels, also in contrast to British nailed heels.
'THE YANKS ARE HERE'—I 942 EDITION
The news spread like wildfire and staid Britishers began
streaming out-of-doors, whooping with excitement.
"The Yanks are here!"
The cry of almost a generation ago rang through the
streets again.
There were several thousand troops in the contingent.
Most were infantrymen, but they included artillery, engineer
and medical corps units.
Major General Hartle and Major General James E. Chaney
shared the honors of leading the first A.E.F. to Europe in
World War No. 2.
Across the dock, into the canteen and then out to camps
the khaki-clad columns streamed smoothly.
Most of the infantrymen were typically Middle West
Americans, but there was a sprinkling from North Carolina,
Michigan, Florida, Louisiana and New York. There were
men with Scandinavian, French, German and Irish blood—
even one Sioux Indian.
Ulstermen are not very demonstrative and the landing un
doubtedly caused less stir than it would have in England or

Scotland. But even the Ulstermen •<
showed that they were well aware
of the full import of the moment.
These were not just a few thousand
more men come to take their bases
in an eastern outpost, beside Cock
neys, Highlands, Welshmen and pa
triots escaped from conquered Eu
rope. These newcomers were a sym
bol of a great force which will one
day make the British Isles a base of
operations against Hitlerism and all
its works.
