Stanford University has set $400 as the goal for its
contribution toward the prevention and cure of infantile
paralysis.
This is used to bring children suffering from the
dreadful, crippling infantile paralysis back into healthy,
happy living. Fifty per cent of the money is given to local
charitable organizations, while fifty per cent goes to the
Warm Springs Foundation to help the national fight
against the disease.
Drop your dimes in the wishing wells located through
out the campus.
