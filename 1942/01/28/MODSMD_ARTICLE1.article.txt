### AMIE REICHERT 
/ 1 UESSES about the significance of
9 the transport of an A.E.F. to
Northern Ireland are a dime a dozen
since President Roosevelt revealed
the move Monday.
One theory is that the Ameri
cans have been ordered there pos
sibly to form the advance spear
head of a thrust to Hitler's Conti
nent. Another, advanced yester
day by Professor Stuart, is that
the people of Eire, traditionally
hostile to their British neighbors
and long-time friends of the
United States, would more readily
tolerate an A.E.F. in Northern
Ireland than a B.E.F.
There are vital naval bases now
in Ireland, essential to the security
of the American-British Isles supply
line. Furthermore, there is the
probability that the United Nations
are also garrisoning Northern Ire
land against a Nazi attack—a flove
which h;is been considered by mili
tary experts for many years.

almost a year now there has
been talk of our sending troops
to Ireland. While the talk went on,
American engineers were busy over
there setting the stage for the even
tual entrance of a U.S. force. They
built air and naval bases, strength
ened Northern Ireland's defenses.
Both Great Britain and the U.S.
have pressed the I)e Valera gov
ernment of Eire for use of bases
in Southern Ireland as well from
which to hunt down U-boats, but
a deal thus far has not been ne
gotiated. The presence of Ameri
can troops in Northern Ireland
may eventually lead to such a deal,
but latest reports have it that De
Valera was miffed because neither
the British nor the U.S. had in
formed him of the A.E.F". until
after it arrived.
President Roosevelt yesterday in
his press conference did little to
clarify the mystery. In fact, he in
creased it by nine when he said
that there were a good many expedi
tionary forces—probably ten—oper
ating on the various war fronts of
the world. He couldn't say where,
of course, but a reasonable specula
tion based on former government re
ports would indicate that we have
sent troops to Iceland, Dutch Guiana
in South America, Trinidad, New
foundland, and other bases which we
obtained from Great Britain.

YESTERDAY the War Department
announced the appointment of
Major-General James E. Chaney to
full command of all American forces
in the United Kingdom. Chaney, a
member of the U.S. military mission
to London, is a veteran arch-expo
nent of the importance of air power
in modern warfare.
This appointment is a significant
and encouraging one. Chaney has
had years of valuable air experience,
and each day makes increasingly ap
parent the fact that air power is the
determining force in today's war.

RUSSIAN forces, fighting fiercely
against renewed German re
sistance, moved northwest, west, and
southwest of Moscow, behind the re
treating enemy.
The Russians are destroying
bridges, German munitions trains,
motor vehicles, and equipment as
they go.

IN LIBYA the British say they
have positively stopped Rommel's
150-mile desert sprint of the past
few days which swept the Imperial
troops back in what first looked like
another blitz for the Nazis.
London claims that the tide of
battle has turned incredibly once
more, that Rommel's flurry was a
phony, that the Axis forces arc
now caught in a giant nutcracker
and arc taking a terrific pounding
from British tank and air units.
The dispatch stated that Imperial
Tomahawks and American-made
Kittihawks, flying wing to wing with
Hurricanes, have decimated the
Axis columns in the worst strafing
attack of this campaign.
The British claim the fighters
knocked out 120 vehicles, shattered
an Arab fort which contained
some 200 German officers, and sent
these gentlemen scooting across
the desert.
