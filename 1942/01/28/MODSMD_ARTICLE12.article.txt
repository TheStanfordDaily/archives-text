# BIGGEST ARMS BILLS IN HISTORY ON DECK

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP). —
Paced by the House, Congress to
night neared final action on two of
the biggest arms bills in American
history — appropriations totaling
$32,533,838,948 to give the land, sea
and air forces of the United States
and its allies power to crush the
Axis on every battlefront of the
world.
Grimly aware that time is a most
valuable ally to the United Nations,
the House and Senate virtually raced
each other to remove the last legis
lative obstacles in the path of the
two gigantic appropriations.
