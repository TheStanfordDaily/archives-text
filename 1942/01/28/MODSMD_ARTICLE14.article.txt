# Nipponese Take 'Anchor Posts'

SINGAPORE. Jan. 27 (UP). —
Japanese armies have captured or
bypassed all three anchor posts of
the Imperial defense line across Ma
laya and now are fighting less than
50 miles from Singapore on a 30-
mile front, British General Head
quarters revealed today.
A communique reported bloody
battles raging south of Batu Pahat,
Kluang and Mersing. Those three
strategic towns hinge at either end
and in the center of the main high
way stretching 80 miles across the
peninsula on a rough arc 50 to 60
miles above Singapore.
It was along this road that the
Imperial command had given every
sign of making a do-or-die stand
in the defense of this island fortress
and naval base.
Meantime, Japanese reinforce
ments poured in on the east coast,
intensifying the menace from that
direction. But the enemy paid dearly
for the added strength.
British bombing and fighting
planes swarmed down on the Japa
nese convoy off Endau, 22 miles
above Mersing on the cast coast.
One bomb hit an enemy cruiser, 12
rained on a transport, blasts rocked
other big vessels, and machine gun
ners raked the barges and landing
craft.
Shore-based Japanese fighters
went up to challenge the British
airmen who tangled with them in
furious dogfights which sent 12 en
emy planes spinning down to de
struction and crippled four more.
There was no mention of Imperial
losses.
