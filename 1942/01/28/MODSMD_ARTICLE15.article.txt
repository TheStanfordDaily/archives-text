# ROMMEL'S OFFENSIVE DESCRIBED AS 'BLUFF'
## 
### 
WITH BRITISH IMPERIAL ARMY
IN LIBYA, Jan. 27 (UP).â€”German
Gen. Erwin Rommel's counter-offen
sive, which regained a 150-mile
strip of Libyan desert in four days,
was a bluff which the British Impe
rials callcd, with disastrous results
for Rommel. That much is now ap
parent.
The Axis advance is stopped, and
appraised in the light of newest de
velopments this is what it amounted
to: By scurrying across Ihe desert
trails from the marshy area around
El ARhela, Rommel achieved quick
and spectacular results. His purpose
evidently was to delay the Impe
rials' further ofTensive. He is now
facing the consequences of his fly
ing breakout as the British put nut
cracker pressure on his flanks.
Working down the west side of the
Libyan hump, on the Chemincs-
Agedabia Road, British tank and mo
torized forces are delivering sledge
hammer punches at Axis tanks.
Some British got in behind the
Germans, who are operating some 50
miles inland around Msus, and
caused havoc to their communica
tions before fighting their way back
to the main Imperial Army.
