# Encina Loses Marks Of Old-Day Roughs
## 
### 
The nasty rumor going around
that the men of '15 arc losing their
title of "rough" gained further
credence yesterday when it was
discovered that one of the rooms
in Encina now has not the old
orange color shades that have sat
isfied generations of the Stanford
"roughs" hut has beautiful cream
colored Venetian blinds.
Next we might expect white
polar hear rugs and wine color
drapes in the Encina rooms to help
the freshmen feel at home.
