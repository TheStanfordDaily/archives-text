# Row Dances To Replace Pledge Prom
## Women's Gym Found Unavailable; Separate Houses Plan Parties 
### 
Instead of the annual Pledge
Prom, Stanford fraternities this year
will have individual house parties,
Friday, Feb. G, following formal
pledging. This was the decision
reached by the Intcrfratcrnity Coun
cil at the Phi Kap house last night.
"The present situation is forcing
us into something which may prove
to be much better," said Interfra
ternity President Jim Haugh as he
proposed individual dinners or
dances instead of the customary
Prom.
His proposal was approved by a
large majority of the group, only
two houses being unable to have
parties. President Wilbur has long
favored this type of celebration over
the over-crowded Prom, according
to Haugh.
"It is impossible to hold the Prom
in the Women's Gym this year," said
Haugh.

The floor has to be sandpapered
after every dance, and another dance
on one of the floors, according to
Frank Fish Walker, financial vice
president, would put the floor down
to the nails. This side in question is
now used by an esthetic dance group.
The 1941 Prom required the rc-sur
facing of one of the two floors at a
cost of $500.
Present Pledge Day plans call for
pledging in Encina from 2 to 4:30.
Last year's pledging locale, the stu
dent body offices in the Union, was
declared unsuccessful because of
possible pressure exerted on fresh
men by fraternity members. This is
less likely to happen in Encina,
Haugh declared.
OPEN HOUSES
Following pledging, pledges will go
up the Row to their houses for what
ever type of party the fraternities
wish to have. The private affairs
will probably last until 10:30 or 11,
when fraternity men and pledges
can visit from house to house.
Warren M. Turner, Interfraternity
treasurer, spoke briefly to the Coun
cil on pledge day routine and asked
the houses to keep a standard size
pledge card.
As the meeting drew to a close,
Haugh commented on the intelligent
attitude shown by the freshman
class this year. "They seem to have
taken the pledging rules to heart,"
he said.
Alpha Sig President Franz Gah
rels invited the Council to hold its
next, meeting at his house. It is ten
tatively scheduled for Thursday,
February 12.

pledging in Encina from 2 to 4:30.
Last year's pledging locale, the stu
dent body offices in the Union, was
declared unsuccessful because of
possible pressure exerted on fresh
men by fraternity members. This is
less likely to happen in Encina,
Haugh declared.
OPEN HOUSES
Following pledging, pledges will go
up the Row to their houses for what
ever type of party the fraternities
wish to have. The private affairs
will probably last until 10:30 or 11,
when fraternity men and pledges
can visit from house to house.
Warren M. Turner, Interfraternity
treasurer, spoke briefly to the Coun
cil on pledge day routine and asked
the houses to keep a standard size
pledge card.
As the meeting drew to a close,
Haugh commented on the intelligent
attitude shown by the freshman
class this year. "They seem to have
taken the pledging rules to heart,"
he said.
Alpha Sig President Franz Gah
rels invited the Council to hold its
next, meeting at his house. It is ten
tatively scheduled for Thursday,
February 12.
Instead of the annual Pledge
Prom, Stanford fraternities this year
will have individual house parties,
Friday, Feb. G, following formal
pledging. This was the decision
reached by the Intcrfratcrnity Coun
cil at the Phi Kap house last night.
"The present situation is forcing
us into something which may prove
to be much better," said Interfra
ternity President Jim Haugh as he
proposed individual dinners or
dances instead of the customary
Prom.
His proposal was approved by a
large majority of the group, only
two houses being unable to have
parties. President Wilbur has long
favored this type of celebration over
the over-crowded Prom, according
to Haugh.
"It is impossible to hold the Prom
in the Women's Gym this year," said
Haugh.
WALKER COMMENTS
The floor has to be sandpapered
after every dance, and another dance
on one of the floors, according to
Frank Fish Walker, financial vice
president, would put the floor down
to the nails. This side in question is
now used by an esthetic dance group.
The 1941 Prom required the rc-sur
facing of one of the two floors at a
cost of $500.
