# Stanford Professors Discuss Problems of War Inflation
## 
### 
Speaking on tin* subject "Can We Control Inflation?" three Stanford
professors, with II frnard F. Haley, professor of Economics and head of the
department of economics, serving as chairman, discussed the relative
merits of ways in which we, as people in a community, can prevent in
flation in the prcstiit war at last night's Tuesday Evening Series.
George W. Dowrie, professor of finance, discussing the extent to which

the United States' lai ge proportion 4
of the world's gold may be respon
sible for inflation, declared, "Infla
tion can be checked by preventing
the government from borrowing from
the banks. This would tend to con
trol indiscriminate spending." Pro
fessor Dowrie continued by saying j
that the quality of purchasing power
I would be quite great during the
present emergency.

Discusing methods of financing the
war which may help to check infla
tion and methods that may have the
effect of promoting inflation, Elmer
D. Fagan, professor of economics,
made the statement that higher in
come? taxes will help prevent infla
tion. "Inflation may be checked by
increasing the income taxes and re
ducing available funds which add to
inflation," Professor Fagan said.
He went on to declare that many
taxes are likely to be employed in
trying to prevent inflation and that
the income tax should be most effec
tive. The increasing federal tax pro
gram will place a great burden on
the citizen but we must make the
best of the situation if wo are to win
the war.
Theodore J. Kreps, professor of
business economics in the Graduate
School of Business, considered what
could bo done through the Office of 1
Price Administration to control in
flation and price rise. He also dis
cussed the proposed legislation now
before Congress which is designed
to set up additional machinery for
price control.
KREPS APPROVES
When informed that the price con
trol bill had passed the House, Pro
fessor Kreps hinted that the bill,
virtually controlling the pric« of
everything that the American con
sumer buys, was an excellent meas
ure to prevent inflation. He com
mented that he couldn't understand
why the bill had lagged so long be
fore Congress passed it, declaring
that he thought, that some kind of a
price control bill was necessary in
j the present emergency.
Continuing, Professor Kreps added,
"The cost of war will increase and
post-war costs will increase if we
do not have adequate legislation to I
prevent this inflation."
At the conclusion of the discus- J
sion members of the audience were |
j given the opportunity to question i
! the authorities on the inflation prob
j lem. In this discussion Professor
Kreps declared that along with price
control legislation to prevent infla
tion we must also have a rationing

increasing the income taxes and re
ducing available funds which add to
inflation," Professor Fagan said.
He went on to declare that many
taxes are likely to be employed in
trying to prevent inflation and that
the income tax should be most effec
tive. The increasing federal tax pro
gram will place a great burden on
the citizen but we must make the
best of the situation if wo are to win
the war.
Theodore J. Kreps, professor of
business economics in the Graduate
School of Business, considered what
could bo done through the Office of 1
Price Administration to control in
flation and price rise. He also dis
cussed the proposed legislation now
before Congress which is designed
to set up additional machinery for
price control.
KREPS APPROVES
When informed that the price con
trol bill had passed the House, Pro
fessor Kreps hinted that the bill,
virtually controlling the pric« of
everything that the American con
sumer buys, was an excellent meas
ure to prevent inflation. He com
mented that he couldn't understand
why the bill had lagged so long be
fore Congress passed it, declaring
that he thought, that some kind of a
price control bill was necessary in
j the present emergency.
Continuing, Professor Kreps added,
"The cost of war will increase and
post-war costs will increase if we
do not have adequate legislation to I
prevent this inflation."
At the conclusion of the discus- J
sion members of the audience were |
j given the opportunity to question i
! the authorities on the inflation prob
j lem. In this discussion Professor
Kreps declared that along with price
control legislation to prevent infla
tion we must also have a rationing
system to work hand in hand with
