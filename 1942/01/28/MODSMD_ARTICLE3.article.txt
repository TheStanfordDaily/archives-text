# 'Anna Christie Beats Censor
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
Will Hays, now official censor of
the motion picture industry, had
just recently arrived in Hollywood,
and his first statement, believe it or
not, was: "Any effort to censor and
cut motion pictures is as great an
outrage as to cut the tender lips of
newly sprouting corn."
At about the same time, the Fox
Film Corp., which then held the
monopoly of movie theaters, came
out with the sensational news that
henceforth it would make only talk
ing pictures: (he pronouncement of
doom for the silents.
These two announcements had di
rect bearing on a revival of a suc
cessful silent picture of six years be
fore, one of the greatest plays of
the greatest American playwright,
Eugene O'Neill's "Anna Christie."
While most stars were worrying
if they were finished, Greta Garbo,
already one of the top five favorites
of the screen, became an even big
ger sucecss when this, her first talk
ing picture, was released. Never has
she scored a more superb individual
performance.
It was fortunate that the Hays Of
fice was not yet set up, though this
may have been one of the pictures
that made Mr. Hays change his
mind. For "Anna Christie" could not
be produced today, and faithfully
follow the play, as it was produced
Ihen.
It is the story of a Swedish prosti
tute that depicts its characters from
real life, vividly and accurately. It
is a moving drama that still retains
its place in Hollywood's Hall of
Fame.
"Anna Christie" is the picture that
will play in Memorial Hall as the
second of the Sadler Sunday Series,
at 7:15, admission 20 cents.
