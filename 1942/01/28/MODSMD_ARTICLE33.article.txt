# Senate Passes Price Bill

### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP). -
The Senate tonight completed Con
gressional action on a compromise
price control bill which falls far
short of legislation demanded by
President Roosevelt but gives the
government power to fix prices on
almost everything purchased by the
average American.
The measure was sent to the
White House for signature after six
months of bitter wrangling over the
exact authority to be vested in the
government. The dispute was cli
maxed last week when President
Roosevelt and the powerful farm
bloc clashed over the latter's effort
to obtain preferential treatment for
agriculture.
The legislation is designed pri
marily to curb inflation. Sen. Pren
tiss M. Brown, D., Mich., who acted
as Administration floor manager,
said that, if effectively administered,
it would prevent "gross profiteer
ing" and "excessively high prices"

.and—by halting the upward price
trend—"be a potent factor in pre
venting an after-the-war collapse."
As finally approved, the bill em-
I powers the government to fix maxi
j mum price ceilings, with certain res-
I ervations, over all products in an
I effort to keep them in the same gen
! eral relationship to prices prevailing
from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15, 1941.
Preferential treatment is given for
agricultural products but not to the
extent demanded by the farm bloc.
There is no provision to peg wages.
Administration of the program is
placed in the hands of an executive
to be paid $12,000 a year. The job
is expected to go to Leon Hender
son, present price stabilizer.
A licensing system for business is
i authorized to compel compliance
with established price ceilings. Vio
lators would be subject to a $5,000
fine, two years imprisonment and
loss of licenses necessary for contin
uance in business.
