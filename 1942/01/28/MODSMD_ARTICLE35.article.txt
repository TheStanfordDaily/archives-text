# Fists to Fly Tonight as Farm Boxers Scrap for All-U, Novice Championships
## 
### CHARLES MULL 
Fists will fly tonight, as Farm fight fans troupe to the hlacked-out
pavilion to witness the second annual combined All-U and Novice boxing
matches. Under the sponsorship of the Circle S Society, which awards
golden boxing glove charms to the winners, the fights will he held on the
same plan as the highly successful bouts of last year.

As a result ct the grueling elimina
tion rounds that have been held in
the Encina boxing rooms for the
past two weeks, there has emerged a
card of fast, hard-punching ringmen
to present an uninterrupted 3-hour
final thriller.
Coach Clayton Frye announced
today that the card will include
some of the closest and fastest
matches ever to be run off in the
Stanford ring.
Most looked-forward-to bout is
probably the scrap between return
ing veterans Frank Q. Hewitt and
Johnson Chinn. Hewitt won over
Aubrey Fairfax last year, and
Chinn took his novice bout from Bob
Love. Both winners are in top shape
and are gunning for the golden
glove in the 145-pound class of the
All-U match this year.
lIKBERT VS. HICKS
The All-U matches also feature
a return bout between Bud Hebert
and Harry Hicks. Hebert took the
decision from Hicks in the Novice
bout after getting up from the can
vas in the second round last year.
Surprise of the All-U match is
the appearance of Don Grant, who
won the Novice heavyweight title
two years ago, in the 175-pound
class. The new light heavyweight
is paired off with Peter Gadd, vet
eran of last year's bouts. Grant is
said to be faster and not to have
lost any of his punch, while Pete is
also in top form and ready for the
go.
Km-POI jnders
The fastest leather throwing of
the evening may develop when Jim
Thurmond comes into 'contact with
Ira Fishman in the 165-pound All-U
class. Both are veterans returning to
get a last crack at the golden glove;
the fight promises to be a real
thriller.
Bob McNeil and Bill Nourse in
the heavyweight class and Malcolm
Mynderse vs. Bill Wolcott in the
featherweight class round out the
extreme ends of the All-U card.
The Novice bouts are especially
wide open with all fighters evenly

matched. Newcomer Stan Gamel
I looks especially good and will be
i well able to stand up against husky
Bob Dean.
WELLS VS. PECK
In the light-heavy class Frank
Wells squares off with Russ Peck.
Both boys are promising novices.
Other promising entries include
slender Jack Dickey, who fights at
165 pounds, blond Dave Jesberg at
145 pounds, and cautious Russ
Beardsley, who weighs in at 135. All
boys liave hard fights in front of
them against fighters Ross Peck.
Jack Hiskey, Ken Harris and John
Hart man.
The referees for the bouts have
been announced by Coach Frye. Jake
Irwin, ex-Farm heavyweight, will
referee the Novice matches, and
Jack Rice, captain of the Stanford
squad in 1940, will watch over the
All-U bouts.

B.A.C. all day. At 6:30 they can be
