# Orange Hoops To Make Debut
## 
### 
Hard to say if it'll help or not, but
the Pavilion's basketball rims are
now painted a sandy orange hue, in
accordance with an optional confer
ence ruling. It's just an experiment
though, and the rims may again be
black when the Bruins and Stanford
tie into each other Friday night.
Speaking of tying, the Uclans
could upset the apple cart easier
than you think. In the midst of the
Redmen's unbeaten season last year
up popped the Bruins to coo] off the
winning streak wtih a 45-44 "eked
out" win.
But there really is no such thing
as an upset. You might see those
little Bruins suddenly "hit their
hats" from all angles. But even that
kind of shooting can be stopped.
It's that compact, skyscraping
hunk of man power that Coach Ev
erett Dean puts on the floor that can
do it. Count on the Indians' offensive
maneuvering to set up to ruin Bruin.
