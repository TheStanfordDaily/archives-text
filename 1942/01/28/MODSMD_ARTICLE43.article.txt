# Frosh Prepare for Palo Alto High
## 
### 
Hot from a close but convincing
defeat of Mt.nlo J.C. Monday night,
33 to 31, Phil Bengtson's freshman
basketball squad primes for Palo
Altp High School Friday in the Pa
vilion, which will be followed by a
tilt with Lowell High of San Fran
cisco Saturday.
The Paly High tossers are unde-
I feated this year, and are riding on
1 top of the Peninsula Athletic League

race with three straight wins. Con
siderable interest in the frosh battle
i.s being raised in Paly High circles
and a record crowd for a freshman
game is expected to see tall center
Jim Keeler put on a height-fight
with the freshmen's Jack Heald and
Dave Brown.
The frosh record now stands at
four wins and one loss, with scalps
of Menlo, Galileo, San Jose, and
Piejtlmont at the frosh belt.
