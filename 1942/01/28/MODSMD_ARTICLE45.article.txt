# Dear Jerry:
## 
### 
DURING a volume on The Daily the editor
has a lot of hard jobs. Outside of writing
his farewell, the hardest job of all is writing that
Wednesday morning edit after staff elections,
after one of the fellows with whom he has
worked and come up through the staff has
been defeated.
Twice a year, in a system which few of us
like but which seems to be necessary, one fel
low sees the star to which he has hitched his
journalistic wagon for three years disappear
completely. He has lost.
But this year, Bruck, we have been spared
that job.
There wasn't anybody on the staff who could
take your place. It will be a long time until The
Daily sees as good a pair as you and Shaf
around here.
Maybe we're getting a little sentimental as
the time draws close for us to be the one hun
dredth to pass into the realm of "ex-editors of
The Daily."
But be that as it may, the fact remains that
neither of you lost. We don't have to console
either of you. Shaf won in that he will be the
editor of Volume 101. But you did not lose.
You are already in their pitching, an infini
tesimal by nevertheless intergal part of a great
army, an army that is going to play an im
portant part in licking the Axis.
When you wrote "Hello and Goodbye," your
first and last editorial, you said, ". . . it is only
common sense that as long as there's the
slightest chance that things may turn out Hit
ler's way, we must fight to preserve what we
have, and brother, I mean fight."
That was some time before we went to war.
Today those words mean a lot more than they
did. Today we are at war. We are fighting,
"and brother, I mean fighting."
Some of us do not think it was very smart for
the draft to yank you out of school just at the
beginning of the capping climax to your col
lege career. That's water under the bridge
now. You're in there doing your part, serving
your country. And we will all be in with you
pretty soon, helping to prevent that situation
you talked about way back in September—"a
situation which would have the free men and
women of America kowtowing to Nazi rulers."
So, Jerry, we are sure the Army didn't lose
when they got you, you didn't lose, Shaf didn't
lose. We are the only ones who lost, not having
you around the Shack these past few months.
Good luck, old man, and we'll be seeing you
soon.

tesimal by nevertheless intergal part of a great
army, an army that is going to play an im
portant part in licking the Axis.
When you wrote "Hello and Goodbye," your
first and last editorial, you said, ". . . it is only
common sense that as long as there's the
slightest chance that things may turn out Hit
ler's way, we must fight to preserve what we
have, and brother, I mean fight."
That was some time before we went to war.
Today those words mean a lot more than they
did. Today we are at war. We are fighting,
"and brother, I mean fighting."
Some of us do not think it was very smart for
the draft to yank you out of school just at the
beginning of the capping climax to your col
lege career. That's water under the bridge
now. You're in there doing your part, serving
your country. And we will all be in with you
pretty soon, helping to prevent that situation
you talked about way back in September—"a
situation which would have the free men and
women of America kowtowing to Nazi rulers."
So, Jerry, we are sure the Army didn't lose
when they got you, you didn't lose, Shaf didn't
lose. We are the only ones who lost, not having
you around the Shack these past few months.
Good luck, old man, and we'll be seeing you
soon.

DURING a volume on The Daily the editor
has a lot of hard jobs. Outside of writing
his farewell, the hardest job of all is writing that
Wednesday morning edit after staff elections,
after one of the fellows with whom he has
worked and come up through the staff has
been defeated.
Twice a year, in a system which few of us
like but which seems to be necessary, one fel
low sees the star to which he has hitched his
journalistic wagon for three years disappear
completely. He has lost.
But this year, Bruck, we have been spared
that job.
There wasn't anybody on the staff who could
take your place. It will be a long time until The
Daily sees as good a pair as you and Shaf
around here.
Maybe we're getting a little sentimental as
the time draws close for us to be the one hun
dredth to pass into the realm of "ex-editors of
The Daily."
But be that as it may, the fact remains that
neither of you lost. We don't have to console
either of you. Shaf won in that he will be the
editor of Volume 101. But you did not lose.
You are already in their pitching, an infini
tesimal by nevertheless intergal part of a great
army, an army that is going to play an im
portant part in licking the Axis.
