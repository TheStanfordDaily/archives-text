# Here's That Knock Again
## 
### 
CONTEMPORARY students at Stanford have
occasion these days to wish they were bet
ter acquainted with foreign countries. We all
would like to know how the people in Germany,
Russia, Italy, Japan and many other countries
are thinking these days.
We can discern the attitude of their leaders
fairly clearly—too clearly sometimes. But ul
timate sway in those countries will in large
measure be dictated by the feelings of the
people, by habits which are a part of civiliza
tions too old to kill.
And here at school is an opportunity to bet
ter acquaint ourselves with foreign outlooks
and points of view. Each Wednesday evening
Mrs. Edwin Thomas, a long-time friend of the
University, offers her home to open meetings
of the International Club. Around Mrs. Thomas'

fireside thoughtful young men and women of
many nations gather. They speak of a number
of things—of their homes and what is happen
ing to them or, sadder, what has happened to
them. They speak of friends, of attitudes and
of politics.
Frequently members of foreign consulates
are invited to participate in the discussions.
Surely, no thoughtful Stanfordite can afford
to overlook a chance such as this. On Wednes
day evenings members and guests meet at the
Nitery and then proceed to the meeting. It's
certainly worth looking into. —Rosemarie Mul
