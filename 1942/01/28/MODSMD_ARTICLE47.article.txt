# BULL SESSION
## THE 						NEW STAFF 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
VJt/HILE I am writing this at home, big things are
happening at the Daily Shack. For today is the
day that promotions come out, the day that the old
officers move out and fresh ones take their place. And
that means that after today, you will hear from me
only twice more, and then never again unless you hap
pen to ask me a question on the Quad. I know it's a
hard blow for you all to take, but there is no use
protesting. That's the way it's got to be, and in time
you'll learn to do without me.
This is the first time since I have been on the
stafT that I haven't been present on election after
noon. I'm missing all the noise and excitement this
time. I'm missing that quiet, tense hush that falls over
the Shack when the Edit Board walks in with the
promotion notice and tacks it on the wall. I'm missing
the rush for the wall by the staff members, and the
screams of delight and the congratulations on seeing
the name of the new editor and the names for all the
other positions. And I'm afraid I'm going to miss the
party. But I've gone through it all before, and I know
what happens.
* * * *
r rHE close of this week will find The Daily losing
three of the most valuable workers it has had in
many years, Charlie Bull, Bud Ames, and Rosemary
Mullany. Charlie was one of the hardest working
editors to ever occupy the messy little office and
swivel chair. He was over there every day on an aver
age of about eight hours, pounding out his editorials,
keeping the boys in the back shop happy, looking at
cuts, helping the night editors and the U.P. editors,
and always he was the same happy, smiling boy. It
will be a long time until another loud, hearty laugh
like his turns up at the Shack.
Bud Ames did the hard work this volume. He was
the Managing Editor. He didn't get any glory; his
name wasn't whispered around the campus; his was
all dull, technical work. He handed out assignments
every day; he had to get mad at the reporters when
beats weren't covered'; he was the one that was phoned
up when stories didn't appear in the paper. And he
handled the job without being hated by the staff, as is
the fate of most managing editors. Maybe it's be
cause he is so tall and white and sweet.
And Miss Mullany was about the finest women's
editor that we have ever had. She handled all the
new staff members, fitted them into the Daily system,
and was always there, ready to help anyone with
troubles. She even talked to me and for that I'll al
ways remember her.
These go, but new ones come up. As I say, I don't
know who the new officers are because they are being
decided as I am writing this. But whoever they are,
you can be sure that they will be good in the Daily
tradition, and you can count on getting your pappr
every morning, just as you always have.

every day; he had to get mad at the reporters when
beats weren't covered'; he was the one that was phoned
up when stories didn't appear in the paper. And he
handled the job without being hated by the staff, as is
the fate of most managing editors. Maybe it's be
cause he is so tall and white and sweet.
And Miss Mullany was about the finest women's
editor that we have ever had. She handled all the
new staff members, fitted them into the Daily system,
and was always there, ready to help anyone with
troubles. She even talked to me and for that I'll al
ways remember her.
These go, but new ones come up. As I say, I don't
know who the new officers are because they are being
decided as I am writing this. But whoever they are,
you can be sure that they will be good in the Daily
tradition, and you can count on getting your pappr
every morning, just as you always have.
VJt/HILE I am writing this at home, big things are
happening at the Daily Shack. For today is the
day that promotions come out, the day that the old
officers move out and fresh ones take their place. And
that means that after today, you will hear from me
only twice more, and then never again unless you hap
pen to ask me a question on the Quad. I know it's a
hard blow for you all to take, but there is no use
protesting. That's the way it's got to be, and in time
you'll learn to do without me.
This is the first time since I have been on the
stafT that I haven't been present on election after
noon. I'm missing all the noise and excitement this
time. I'm missing that quiet, tense hush that falls over
the Shack when the Edit Board walks in with the
promotion notice and tacks it on the wall. I'm missing
the rush for the wall by the staff members, and the
screams of delight and the congratulations on seeing
the name of the new editor and the names for all the
other positions. And I'm afraid I'm going to miss the
party. But I've gone through it all before, and I know
what happens.

r rHE close of this week will find The Daily losing
three of the most valuable workers it has had in
many years, Charlie Bull, Bud Ames, and Rosemary
Mullany. Charlie was one of the hardest working
editors to ever occupy the messy little office and
swivel chair. He was over there every day on an aver
age of about eight hours, pounding out his editorials,
keeping the boys in the back shop happy, looking at
cuts, helping the night editors and the U.P. editors,
and always he was the same happy, smiling boy. It
will be a long time until another loud, hearty laugh
like his turns up at the Shack.
Bud Ames did the hard work this volume. He was
the Managing Editor. He didn't get any glory; his
name wasn't whispered around the campus; his was
all dull, technical work. He handed out assignments
every day; he had to get mad at the reporters when
beats weren't covered'; he was the one that was phoned
up when stories didn't appear in the paper. And he
handled the job without being hated by the staff, as is
