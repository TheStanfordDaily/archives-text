r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In re Willie's letter in The Daily of January 26.
All right, Willie. You and Admiral Kimmel and
General Stone and thumbs down on hysteria. Better
check on your Nipponese sources though. Sometimes
they bomb just for fun to catch our little Willies,
and then again they may make mistakes. Instead of
getting an air field or munitions plant they occasion
ally hit a neighboring settlement. Nothing to get
hysterical about to be sure. But I am wrong, Willie.
You arc not responsible for anybody but yourself;
at least I sincerely hope this is true. I should hate to
think otherwise. The Admiral and the General car
ried quite a load of it.
Sincerely yours,
Rose Burke
P.S.: And by the way, Willie, have you heard the
little rumor about your tuition? That you don't really
pay for everything you get and that the University
carries quite a part of it? Maybe you do have some
responsibility after all.

EDITOR, SIR:
We regret to find it necessary to call to the atten
tion of the campus the probable theft of the sacrcd
scrapbook of our fraternity, Zeta Psi. This book con
tains the record of the chapter in newspaper clippings
since the year 1939.
We hope that you will help us in our effort to find
this valuable book by publishing this letter.
Very truly yours,
Frank Tatum
Zeta Psi President

r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
I have never read a more confused statement of
policy than the Daily's defense of its staff members
last Friday in the matter of smoking on the Quad. To
say that "members of the Daily staff cannot be held
responsible in off hours for adherence to editorial
policy and . . . Stanford tradition" is cold bloodedly
admitting that editorial policy is a convention unheard
of outside the columns of the newspaper, and that
Stanford tradition, loved subject of Daily Bull Ses
sions, is entirely unconnected with the reporter's daily
life.
Too, the numerous infractions of the unwritten law
against smoking on Inner Quad by others constitute
no argument on the side of the Daily violators. Isn't it
a bit childish, like protesting "Johnny did it!" to
wish to "print the names of everyone—law students,
professors, and just plain students—who just plain
forget every day a wish expressed by the founders of
Stanford?" And as for modern conditions "gnawing
away at many old traditions"—weren't there habitual
smokers in 1891 as well as 1942?
These are flimsy excuses at best for the conduct of
those who should be most interested in—pardon the
cliche—-practicing what they preach, and they are en
tirely inconsistent wtih your final statement that this
tradition "can be kept without inconveniences to any
one." Do you mean "anyone," which would certainly
include Daily members, or do you mean "anyone else,"
which the whole statement appears to indicate?
In the later case the Daily member is placed in an
exclusive little niche—he may smoke on Quad be
cause he is a Daily member and because other "spe
cial" people do it, while the rest of us should go on
observing a Stanford custom "that can be kept without
inconvenience to anyone."
