# 'Sister Eileen' Fullfills All Expectations
## 
### 
"My Sister Eileen," now playing
at the Geary Theater in San Fran
cisco.
It's every hit the hilarious comedy
its press agents say it is, and then
some; the play isn't sprinkled with
belly-laughs, hut the audience keeps
up a constant rumbling from start to
finish.
There isn't much plot — just the
story of two small town girls come
to the big city to find jobs—for the
story starts and ends haphazardly,
leaving the impression that it could
have begun or finished anywhere
along the line.
What makes it top-notch comedy
are the odd situations that constantly
crop up. The setting of the play—a
Greenwich Village basement apart
ment with a large window opening
flush with the sidewalk—offers great
opportunity for novel stage business.
There is the to-be-expected little
dog who must be shooed away from
the open window-grating, and a very
well done scene of a "pick-up"—two
legs (shapely and feminine) saunter
past the window, then two more legs
(trounsered) stroll by; the silk
stockinged ones come to a casual
halt, the trousered ones approach,
and then all four disappear together.
Eileen Sherwood, the pretty sister
played by Marcy Westcott, and her
more "intellectual" sister, Ruth,
played by Effie Afton, are characters
adapted from real life stories writ
ten by Ruth McKenney about her
sister and herself. Ruth sums up
her romantic troubles when she pines
to Eileen, "Men never bother me;
not after they see you!"
A constant stream of odd charac
ters keeps wandering through their
apartment, due partly to the rather
sudden departure of the previous
tenant, a raucous voiced female
named Violet, who neglected to in
form all her associates that she had
moved. The girls often have to call
on "The Wreck," a professional foot
ball player who does housekeeping,
to help repel invaders.
Their Shylock of a landlord, Mr.
Appopolous, is a misunderstood —
and understandably so—artist whose
brilliant sales talk sells the girls on
the rooms, but which only draws
from a less Easily influenced pros
pect the comment. "What saddist de
signed this place?"
Eileen's fatal attraction ensnares
a ne'er-do-well newspaperman, a
Russian prince, and several other
"nice boys"; among these is Frank,
"the owner of the corner Owl Drug
Store," who brings as gifts the spe
cials from the weeks' sale. Her
crowning achievement comes when
she, together with six members of
the Brazilian navy, two drunks, and
a cop, trail through the room and
past the outside of the window in a
Conga line, chanting, "Uno, dos, tres,
cuatro!"
The play ends as the girls, being
told that the subway blasting under
the house has stopped, sign a new
lease—only to learn that the exca
vators have ceased blasting in order
to start drilling!—Dillinger
