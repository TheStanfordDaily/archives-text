# Adolfo Arias Tops Career In Khan Role
## 
### 
Probably the most all-around the
ater man in Stanford is Adolpho
Arias, soon to be seen as Kublai
Khan in "Marco Millions," to be
produced February 5, 6, and 7 in
the Memorial Theater.
Actor, director, designer, dancer,
and song wirter, Arias had only one
thing in the realm of theater that he
had not done. He had never written
a play for Stanford production. But
that oversight has been taken care
of; his social drama "And Then the
Dusk" was chosen by Ram's Head
to be among the one-act plays to be
put on later in the quarter.
After playing in ten different
shows and starting his dancing ca
reer his freshman year, directing
dances and writing music for the
Gaieties his sophomore year, and
spending a short recuperation period
in the Rest Home, Arias went to
Hollywood for six months. There he
appeared in "Says Youth," produced
by Frank Tuttle, and a short subject
in Spanish at Paramount Studios.
He returned to Stanford to com
plete his education, and since then
has played in practically every show
that has been put on here. His work
in "St. Joan," "Rain from Heaven,"
"Of Thee I Sing," and others last
year drew rave notices.
Arias considers Kubali Khan his
best role to date, for the character
gives him a chance to portray every
conceivable emotion, and to age 20
years during the production â€” the
sort of part that every actor hopes
some day to play.
