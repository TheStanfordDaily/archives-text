# Fawcett, Van Ostrand, Dee Take Burma Road Truck Job
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Three Stanford Phi Delts, Larry
Dee, Mort Van Ostrand, and Randall
"Buck" Fawcett, signed contracts
yesterday afternoon with British
consular officials in San Francisco to
drive trucks during the coming year
on the Burma Road, Far Eastern life
line for shipment of military sup
plies to the Chinese army.
The trio, prominent in Stanford
athletics and campus activities, will
leave for the war zone in about ten
days, but the name of their ship and
embarkation point is being with
held as a military secret. Their
duties will consist mainly of truck
ing lease-lend supplies from Lashio,
Burma, to Kunming, China. The
main desire of the enlistees in ac
cepting the new jobs is to eventu
ally gain admittance to the British
Air Corps.
All three had previously tried to
enter the U.S. Army Air Corps but
they were refused because of faulty
vision. They hope that active serv
ice on the Far Eastern war front will
enable them to squeeze into British
air work of some type.
Pay for the task of piloting mili
tary supplies to the armies of Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek will be
$750 a month —"A good job," to quote
Fawcett.

"The contract is for no definite
; period, but it will be at least a year
1 and perhaps more," Fawcett said.
"We don't know when we leave, al
though the consular agents said to
b c ' ready in ten days, and we don't
know how we are going, except that
we are heading to the Burma Road
to drive a truck."

Besides aiding them in their main
ambition to get into air duty, the
new jobs will give them a chance to
see what "is really going on over
there." "It will let us do what we
can for them," stated Van Ostrand.
"We will get out of a lot of school,
too, for we are definitely out for
the next two or three quarters."
The three are the first Stanford
men to offer service in this par
ticular field, although many Anufli
cans are now in similar service in
maintaining direct passage between
United States and British war ma
terials and the enclosed armies of
China.
Fawcett, a sophomore from Los
Banos, was a key man in the 1941
"T" formation grid baekfield, and
his loss will be a further blow to the
1942 squad. Dee, a senior in the
School of Health, entered from San
Francisco and was president of his
sophomore class. He is one of' the
country's outstanding collcSgiate ten
nis players, being a former National
Collegiate doubles champion with
Jim Wade, Phi Psi. The pair won
the title in 1940, and were runners
up in 1941.

BUCK FAWCETT
Three Stanford Phi Delts, Larry
Dee, Mort Van Ostrand, and Randall
"Buck" Fawcett, signed contracts
yesterday afternoon with British
consular officials in San Francisco to
drive trucks during the coming year
on the Burma Road, Far Eastern life
line for shipment of military sup
plies to the Chinese army.
The trio, prominent in Stanford
athletics and campus activities, will
leave for the war zone in about ten
days, but the name of their ship and
embarkation point is being with
held as a military secret. Their
duties will consist mainly of truck
ing lease-lend supplies from Lashio,
Burma, to Kunming, China. The
main desire of the enlistees in ac
cepting the new jobs is to eventu
ally gain admittance to the British
Air Corps.
All three had previously tried to
enter the U.S. Army Air Corps but
they were refused because of faulty
vision. They hope that active serv
ice on the Far Eastern war front will
enable them to squeeze into British
air work of some type.
Pay for the task of piloting mili
tary supplies to the armies of Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek will be
$750 a month —"A good job," to quote
Fawcett.

"The contract is for no definite
; period, but it will be at least a year
1 and perhaps more," Fawcett said.
"We don't know when we leave, al
though the consular agents said to
b c ' ready in ten days, and we don't
know how we are going, except that
we are heading to the Burma Road
to drive a truck."

Besides aiding them in their main
ambition to get into air duty, the
new jobs will give them a chance to
see what "is really going on over
there." "It will let us do what we
can for them," stated Van Ostrand.
"We will get out of a lot of school,
too, for we are definitely out for
the next two or three quarters."
The three are the first Stanford
men to offer service in this par
ticular field, although many Anufli
cans are now in similar service in
maintaining direct passage between
United States and British war ma
terials and the enclosed armies of
China.
Fawcett, a sophomore from Los
Banos, was a key man in the 1941
"T" formation grid baekfield, and
his loss will be a further blow to the
1942 squad. Dee, a senior in the
School of Health, entered from San
Francisco and was president of his
sophomore class. He is one of' the
country's outstanding collcSgiate ten
nis players, being a former National
Collegiate doubles champion with
Jim Wade, Phi Psi. The pair won
the title in 1940, and were runners
up in 1941.
