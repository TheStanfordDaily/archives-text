# Enemy Subs Sink Two More Tankers Off East Coast; Japs Gain on Singapore
## Sinkings Up American Toll to Ten Since Jan. 14; Brazil, Axis Break 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP). —Two more merchant ships—both of
them American tankers—have been blown to the bottom by enemy sub
marines prowling off the eastern seaboard, the Navy disclosed tonight.
The ships, victims Nos. 9 and 10 since the U-boats began their depre
dations a fortnight ago, were the 7,236-ton Pan-Maine owned by the Pan

American Petroleum and
port Company, and the 7,909-ton ■
Francis E. Powell owned by the At
lantic Refining Company.
Both vessels were torpedoed last
night.
Of the 10 ships attacked since the
submarine warfare broke upon the
United States Atlantic coast Jan. 14,
only one—the American tanker Ma-

lay—has escaped sinking. The Malay
limped to port after surviving a 90-
minute shellfire and torpedo attack.
(New evidence of the scope of
Germany's undersea warfare this
month came from Canada Tuesday
night with announcement that 33
survivors of two vessels—a Norwe
gian tanker and a Greek freighter—
had reached an east coast Canadian
port. Several batches of survivors
from other sunken ships have
reached Canadian ports in recent
days.)
