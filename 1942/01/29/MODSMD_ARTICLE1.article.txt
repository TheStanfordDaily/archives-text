### AMIE REICHERT 
a noisy little bunch
of "rebels" kicked up quite a
row in the British House of Com
mons, and the upshot of the ruckus
will probably be that when Winston
Churchill calls for his vote of con
fidence today there will be a num
ber of "present but not voting"
replies.
Churchill will of course receive
an overwhelmingly confident vote,
that much is certain. You can
credit the British with bungling
almost every step of the way of
World War II as far as battles go
but the fact that Churchill was
bossing the show has coated the
pill.
The bungling British know when
they are well off; they are not so
stupid as to believe for one instant
that there is any other man in the
world than their "Winnie," who can
bring the Empire through to the
victorious conclusion of this war, who
can sustain the morale and the mag
nificent spirit of the British people,
and who can hold on and hold tight
as Churchill has done.
* * *
IF THERE is any juggling around
tb be done it will be done prob
ably within the Prime Minister's
Cabinet, for the rebel gentlemen of
the House were talking sense yes
terday, and good sense, when they
lashed bitterly at Britain's ill-pre
pared stand in the Far East.
Churchill, back from the U.S.
last week, was greeted with a bar
rage of virulent press criticism
from even the most conservative
London papers. The outburst was
the severest the Prime Minister
has yet faced in this war. and was
occasioned mostly by the Malayan
reverses.
The rumbling resentment over
Malaya broke into a fair-sized hur
ricane.
# * *
YESTERDAY the hurricane hit
the House. Three Independent
Laborites, those irrepressibles who
can almost always be counted for
some fireworks, and pretty gener
ally for some good thinking too,
declared dramatically that "this
House has no confidence in the Gov
ernment . . . and only a Socialist
(Labor) government which would
establish social equality in Britain
and grant independence to the occu
pied territories of the Empire can
secure the co-operation of common
peoples of all lands and end the
war with the destruction of Naziism
and Imperialism."
Those boys evidently got a little
excited and went overboard on
the lack of confidcncc issue. And
of course, they took advantage of
the latent dissatisfaction within the
House to heat the drum for a So
cialist government.
This sort of talk is not unfamiliar.
The chant for social equality and co
lonial independence has been the lit
any of the British Labor party in
this war as much as it was in the
last. But they have been pretty well
put in the shade by the eloquence
of their Prime Minister and the cru
cial threats to existence which the
Empire has faced for over two
years now.

YY/HEN the war first bfoke out
Harold L. Laski, British La
bor's most brilliant protagonist, pub
lished a book, "Where Do We Go
from Here?" which set forth clearly
and honestly the practical gains
which British Socialists believed the
whole nation should be fighting for,
among them social and economic ad
justments, and specifically the im
mediate independence of India.
A good many liberals in Britain
and America agreed with Mr. Laski
then and probably would still agree
with him in principle, but no long
er in the matter of the immediacy
of colonial freedom.
Mr. Churchill is one of these lib
erals; he must be if the words of
the Atlantic Charter are not a
complete fraud.
The provision for self-determi
nation is included in that Charter,
and Mr. Churchill has reiterated it
by promising to adjust the India
situation after the war. in return
for abandonment of rebel activity
there for the duration. India has
agreed to wait. The Laborites
had best do likewise.

the House were talking sense yes

lashed bitterly at Britain's ill-pre

Churchill, back from the U.S.
last week, was greeted with a bar
rage of virulent press criticism
from even the most conservative
London papers. The outburst was
the severest the Prime Minister
has yet faced in this war. and was
occasioned mostly by the Malayan
reverses.
The rumbling resentment over
Malaya broke into a fair-sized hur
ricane.

YESTERDAY the hurricane hit
the House. Three Independent
Laborites, those irrepressibles who
can almost always be counted for
some fireworks, and pretty gener
ally for some good thinking too,
declared dramatically that "this
House has no confidence in the Gov
ernment . . . and only a Socialist
(Labor) government which would
establish social equality in Britain
and grant independence to the occu
pied territories of the Empire can
secure the co-operation of common
peoples of all lands and end the
war with the destruction of Naziism
and Imperialism."
Those boys evidently got a little
excited and went overboard on
the lack of confidcncc issue. And
of course, they took advantage of
the latent dissatisfaction within the
House to heat the drum for a So
cialist government.
This sort of talk is not unfamiliar.
The chant for social equality and co
lonial independence has been the lit
any of the British Labor party in
this war as much as it was in the
last. But they have been pretty well
put in the shade by the eloquence
of their Prime Minister and the cru
cial threats to existence which the
Empire has faced for over two
years now.

Harold L. Laski, British La

lished a book, "Where Do We Go
from Here?" which set forth clearly
and honestly the practical gains
which British Socialists believed the
whole nation should be fighting for,
among them social and economic ad
justments, and specifically the im
mediate independence of India.
A good many liberals in Britain
and America agreed with Mr. Laski
then and probably would still agree
with him in principle, but no long
er in the matter of the immediacy
of colonial freedom.
Mr. Churchill is one of these lib
erals; he must be if the words of
the Atlantic Charter are not a
complete fraud.
The provision for self-determi
nation is included in that Charter,
and Mr. Churchill has reiterated it
by promising to adjust the India
situation after the war. in return
for abandonment of rebel activity
there for the duration. India has
agreed to wait. The Laborites
had best do likewise.
a noisy little bunch
of "rebels" kicked up quite a
row in the British House of Com
mons, and the upshot of the ruckus
will probably be that when Winston
Churchill calls for his vote of con
fidence today there will be a num
ber of "present but not voting"
replies.
Churchill will of course receive
an overwhelmingly confident vote,
that much is certain. You can
credit the British with bungling
almost every step of the way of
World War II as far as battles go
but the fact that Churchill was
bossing the show has coated the
pill.

reverses.
The rumbling resentment over
Malaya broke into a fair-sized hur
ricane.

YESTERDAY the hurricane hit
the House. Three Independent
Laborites, those irrepressibles who
can almost always be counted for
some fireworks, and pretty gener
ally for some good thinking too,
declared dramatically that "this
House has no confidence in the Gov
ernment . . . and only a Socialist
(Labor) government which would
establish social equality in Britain
and grant independence to the occu
pied territories of the Empire can
secure the co-operation of common
peoples of all lands and end the
war with the destruction of Naziism
and Imperialism."
Those boys evidently got a little
excited and went overboard on
the lack of confidcncc issue. And
of course, they took advantage of
the latent dissatisfaction within the
House to heat the drum for a So
cialist government.
This sort of talk is not unfamiliar.
The chant for social equality and co
lonial independence has been the lit
any of the British Labor party in
this war as much as it was in the
last. But they have been pretty well
put in the shade by the eloquence
of their Prime Minister and the cru
cial threats to existence which the
Empire has faced for over two
years now.

Harold L. Laski, British La
bor's most brilliant protagonist, pub
lished a book, "Where Do We Go
from Here?" which set forth clearly
and honestly the practical gains
which British Socialists believed the
whole nation should be fighting for,
among them social and economic ad
justments, and specifically the im
mediate independence of India.
A good many liberals in Britain
and America agreed with Mr. Laski
then and probably would still agree
with him in principle, but no long
er in the matter of the immediacy
of colonial freedom.
Mr. Churchill is one of these lib
erals; he must be if the words of
the Atlantic Charter are not a
complete fraud.
The provision for self-determi
nation is included in that Charter,
and Mr. Churchill has reiterated it
by promising to adjust the India
situation after the war. in return
for abandonment of rebel activity
there for the duration. India has
agreed to wait. The Laborites
had best do likewise.
a noisy little bunch
of "rebels" kicked up quite a
row in the British House of Com
mons, and the upshot of the ruckus
will probably be that when Winston
Churchill calls for his vote of con
fidence today there will be a num
ber of "present but not voting"
replies.
Churchill will of course receive
an overwhelmingly confident vote,
that much is certain. You can
credit the British with bungling
almost every step of the way of
World War II as far as battles go
but the fact that Churchill was
bossing the show has coated the
pill.
The bungling British know when
they are well off; they are not so
stupid as to believe for one instant
that there is any other man in the
world than their "Winnie," who can
bring the Empire through to the
victorious conclusion of this war, who
can sustain the morale and the mag
nificent spirit of the British people,
and who can hold on and hold tight
as Churchill has done.

IF THERE is any juggling around
tb be done it will be done prob
ably within the Prime Minister's
Cabinet, for the rebel gentlemen of
the House were talking sense yes
terday, and good sense, when they
lashed bitterly at Britain's ill-pre
pared stand in the Far East.
Churchill, back from the U.S.
last week, was greeted with a bar
rage of virulent press criticism
from even the most conservative
London papers. The outburst was
the severest the Prime Minister
has yet faced in this war. and was
occasioned mostly by the Malayan
reverses.
The rumbling resentment over
Malaya broke into a fair-sized hur
ricane.
