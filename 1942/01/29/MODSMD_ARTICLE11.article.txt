# Polio Drive Results Are 'Generous'
## Goal for Infantile Paralysis Campaign Set at 400 Dollars 
### 
Stanford's "March of Dimes"
campaign enters its second day to
day with Chairman Bill Green re
porting first-day results as "gen
erous." Although no official count
has been made of the money received
yesterday, Chairman Green states, "I
went around and shook the boxes;
results are promising."
Goal set for the drive is $400.
Money taken in will be used for
research, treatment, and rehabili
tation of infantile paralysis victims.
Half the money will be used locally,
while the remainder will be sent to
the Warm Springs Foundation in
Georgia.
ENDS SATURDAY
Containers, in the form of wishing
wells, have been placed on the
Quad, in the Cellar, the Libe, and
other public places. Representatives
have been chosen for all living
groups to aid in the drive. The cam
paign ends on Saturday, President
Roosevelt's birthday.
"If everyooe on campus would
contribute only ten cents," Chair
man Green stated, "we would easily
reach our goal of 4000 dimes. This
means, however, that Stanford must
donate an average of $100 a day dur
ing the four-day campaign."
Slogan for the drive, sponsored by
Alpha Phi Omega, Farm service
organization, is "Keep Them Smil
ing"
RESEARCH GRANT
Stanford has received a grant of
$5,000 from the polio foundation for
work in bacteriology and experi
mental pathology. Dr. Hubert Lor
ing is in charge of this work in col
laboration with the research depart
ment under Dr. E. W. Schultz. Ex
periments are being carried forward
to attempt purification of the virus.
The virus is harvested from the
vocal cords of an infected oriental
monkey. There is only a limited
supply of these monkeys at Stan
ford, and war conditions make it
difficult to obtain more. Certain
strains of polio, however, can be
passed to white mice and cotton
rats. It may become necessary to
use these animals in place of the
monkeys.
The Lane Hospital, Stanford's
Med School, receives;, $9,000 for ex
periment and research in infantile
paralysis.

periments are being carried forward
to attempt purification of the virus.
The virus is harvested from the
vocal cords of an infected oriental
monkey. There is only a limited
supply of these monkeys at Stan
ford, and war conditions make it
difficult to obtain more. Certain
strains of polio, however, can be
passed to white mice and cotton
rats. It may become necessary to
use these animals in place of the
monkeys.
The Lane Hospital, Stanford's
Med School, receives;, $9,000 for ex
periment and research in infantile
paralysis.
Stanford's "March of Dimes"
campaign enters its second day to
day with Chairman Bill Green re
porting first-day results as "gen
erous." Although no official count
has been made of the money received
yesterday, Chairman Green states, "I
went around and shook the boxes;
results are promising."
Goal set for the drive is $400.
Money taken in will be used for
research, treatment, and rehabili
tation of infantile paralysis victims.
Half the money will be used locally,
while the remainder will be sent to
the Warm Springs Foundation in
Georgia.
ENDS SATURDAY
Containers, in the form of wishing
wells, have been placed on the
Quad, in the Cellar, the Libe, and
other public places. Representatives
have been chosen for all living
groups to aid in the drive. The cam
paign ends on Saturday, President
Roosevelt's birthday.
"If everyooe on campus would
contribute only ten cents," Chair
man Green stated, "we would easily
reach our goal of 4000 dimes. This
means, however, that Stanford must
donate an average of $100 a day dur
ing the four-day campaign."
Slogan for the drive, sponsored by
Alpha Phi Omega, Farm service
organization, is "Keep Them Smil
ing"
RESEARCH GRANT
