# 'Christie' Heads Sunday's Show
## Old Picture Recalls Hollywood Hey-day 
### 
It was the hey-day of Clara Bow
and Colleen Moore, and Joan Craw
ford was called "The Venus of Hol
lywood." (This Crawford appella
tion turned out to be purely tenta
tive.) Greta Garbo ranked fifth at
the box office, but had not yet
made a talking picture. One of the
topics of speculation of the day was
how her voice would sound.
Then came "Anna Christie," Ihe
first Garbo "talkie," and her deep
baritone lifted her to the position of
number one at the box office.
And Marie Dressier played her
first motion picture part, that of
an old trull, in "Anna Christie."
Just a year later she won the Acad
emy Award for her performance in
"Min and Bill" with Wallace Beery.
So "Anna Christie" holds a unique
place in Hollywood history. That is
one reason why Barbara Sadler se
lected it for the second program of
the bi-weekly Sadler Sunday Series.
The show starts with a couple of
cartoons and chapter two of "Buck
Rogers," at 7:15 Sunday night in
Memorial Hall. Admission is 20
cents.
