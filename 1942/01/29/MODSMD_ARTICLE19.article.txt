Soviet armies smashed great gaps

cow Wednesday and drove to within
90 miles of the Latvian border west
northwest of the Red capital, Rus
sian dispatches claimed.
British forces stopped the Axis
advance in Libya.
Coinciding with the new Russian
victory claims, the British in North
Africa reported the armored Axis
forces of Gen. Erwin Rommel held
on a line 40 miles south of Benghazi
and under heavy attack—especially

made fighter planes took a promi
nent part in the British air attack,
one of the heaviest of the Libyan
campaign.
In heavy attacks Tuesday near

knocked out 120 Axis vehicles and
killed 200 German officers—many of
them of high rank —at an enemy
headquarters in an old Arab fort.
