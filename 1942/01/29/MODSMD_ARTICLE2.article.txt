# Burma Road Story Hoax, Says Consul
## Daily Lodges Charges With Men's Council Against Phi Delts 
### 
British consular officials in San
Francisco yesterday emphatically de
nied the authenticity of a story
printed in yesterday morning's Daily
stating that three Stanford Phi
Delts were expected to leave in ten
days to drive trucks on the Burma
Road.
British authorities stated that
there are no such positions avail
able as those described to The Daily
by persons claiming to be Buck Faw
cett, Larry Dee, and Mort Van Os
trand.
Last night formal charges were
lodged by The Daily with Stan
Owen, chairman of Men's Council,
against certain undetermined mem
bers of Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
A full investigation is under way.
CONSUL INCONVENIENCED
Information about the pseudo
s7so-per-month jobs available on the
Far Eastern front caused inconven
ience to the British Consulate in San
Francisco and to the many Stan
ford men who applied to the con
sulate on the strength of The Daily's
article. Absolute proof that the in
formation leading to publication of
the account was a hoax came in a
telephone conversation with the con
sulate yesterday, after campus ru
mor during the morning had marked
the story as a fake.
Names of the guilty parties have
not yet been ascertained, but charges
against the unknown practical joke
steij; are based on telephone conver
sations between Daily representa
tives and persons claiming to be Van
Ostrand and Fawcett. At least one
of the calls received at The Daily
is known to have originated at the
Phi Delt house.
First mention of the now - dis
proved entrance of the Stanford men
into the service of the British gov
ernment was received at The Daily
about 3 p.m. Tuesday. The Daily
contacted the Phi Delt house during
the afternoon but could not locate
Fawcett, Dee, or Van Ostrand. A
later call wag made at the dinner
hour when word was left to have any
of the trio contact the paper imme
diately.
FAKE NEWS GIVEN
Shortly after 6 o'clock that night
a person, supposedly Van Ostrand,
called The Daily and gave out the
basis of the printed article in an in
terview with a Daily reporter. La
ter, after the paper had requested
that the other two of the trio call
the office, a phone call was received
by a person claiming to be Fawcett
who corroborated the previous in
formation.
First intimation given The Daily
that the facts were not true did not
come until yesterday morning.
The article which is the basis of
the situation stated that Fawcett,
Dee, and Van Ostrand were to leave
in about 10 da>\j for jobs driving
lend-lease supplies over the Burma
Road.
Attitude of tha Stanford Daily
Ln the matter is explained further in
the adjoining editorial.
