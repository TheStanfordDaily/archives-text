# PHILIPPINE FRONT QUIET FOR SECOND DAY
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (UP). —
The United States air and sea coun
ter-offensive in southwestern Pacific
waters today had raised to 76 the
number of Japanese ships known
sunk or damaged by American
forces as criticism mounted in Con
gressional circles of this nation's ap
parent inability to reinforce the
Philippines.
Army Communique No. 80 con
firmed that American flying fort
resses had sunk another enemy
transport and scored a direct hit on
a Japanese cruiser in the continu
ing battle of Macassar Strait.
Farther north — on the Bataan
front in the Philippines—there was
comparative quiet as Gen. Douglas
Mac-Arthur's defenders enjoyed a
respite for the second successive day.
But the War Department noted,
perhaps ominously, that the enemy
was putting more reinforcements
ashore and conducting aerial recon
naissance probably as the prelude to
another all-out drive.
