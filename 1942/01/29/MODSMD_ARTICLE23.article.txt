# Huge Scale Sub Attacks By Axis on Every Front Threatens U. S. Shipping
## Enemy Presence in Caribbean Sea, Off Texas, Hawaii, Indicates New Thrust at Allied Naval Supremacy 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (UP). —The submarine menace sprang up to
night in virtually all waters touching continental United States and its
territories and possessions.
(The Berlin radio recorded by United Press, New York, claimed that
"within a very short time .'so American and Allied ships totaling 228,000

K tons were sunk by German subma
rines off the American shores. Ger
man U-boats had been "under the
very nose of the statue of liberty in
New York harbor," the radio
claimed.)
The vast geographical magnitude
of the threat was indicated in offi
cially-approved reports from Ha
waii to Puerto Rico and from Texan
to the Pacific Coast.
SUBS APPEAR IN GULF
The east and west coasts already
have seen underseas warfare since
the United States entered the war,
but tonight there came ominous
hints the menace has spread to new
areas—the Gulf Coast and approach
es to Puerto Rico—and that there
has been renewed submarine activ
ity in the Pacific Northwest and in
the waters near Hawaii.
They came in authorized dispatches
) from:
1. Corpus Christi, Texas, where
the commander of the naval air sta
! tion announced the probable pres
ence of two Axis submarines oper
ating off the south Texas coast.
2. San Juan, P.R., where the ar
rival of the S.S. Caomo revealed that
the 7,988-ton Canadian liner Lady
Hawkins had been torpedoed in the
Atlantic with a possible loss of 250
lives. The Coamo put 71 survivors
ashore.
BLACK DOUGLAS SAFE
3. Seatle, Wash., where headquar
ters of the 13th Naval District re
vealed that a small ocean-going
schooner twice encountered enemy
submarine fire en route from Savan
nah, Ga., to Seattle. The ship-—the
Black Douglas — arrived safely at
Seattle, according to the 13th Naval
District.
4. Honolulu, where depth charges
were heard exploding off shore,
Navy officials there admitted an
alert signal had summoned all per
sonnel on shore leave to their sta
tions, but they refused to say
whether enemy submarines had
been detected.
These reports would seem to indi
cate that Germany and Japan arc
trying to confuse United States de
fenses against submarines and at
tempting to force a wide dispersion
of American naval forces.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (UP). —The submarine menace sprang up to
night in virtually all waters touching continental United States and its
territories and possessions.
(The Berlin radio recorded by United Press, New York, claimed that
"within a very short time .'so American and Allied ships totaling 228,000

K tons were sunk by German subma

New York harbor," the radio
claimed.)

has been renewed submarine activ
