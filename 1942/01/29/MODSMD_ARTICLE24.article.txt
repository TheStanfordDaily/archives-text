# 'AMERICA ON MARCH' —KNOX ON WAR SCENE
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 28 (UP).—Secre
tary of Navy Frank Knox, outlining
the nation's war efforts in a calm,
confident voice, told the world today
that "America is on the march" and
that material and men are moving
to the hard-pressed fronts in thp
South Pacific" under protection of
its Navy.
Speaking before the Chicago Asso
ciation of Commerce, Knox denied
that the United States is avoiding
all-out war in the Pacific until the
enemy has been beaten in Europe.
He said the Nazi-coveted prizes of
the East would not fall without
"mighty battles."
"We cannot take them on one at
a time when they are coming two at
a time," Knox said.
"The war in the Pacific, the war
in the Atlantic, the war in China, in
Malaya, in Russia, in Libya—they
are all one war, one world revolu
tion, one bid for world mastery.
"Hitler hatched this ghastly con
spiracy on the whole world, but the
enemy is one enemy—one indivis
ible, total enemy.
