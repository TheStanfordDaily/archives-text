"During the present emergency
and the following period of reor
ganization, the private and public
agencies will need social workers,"
Mrs. Ruth T. Wilson stated as she
gave an overview of the field.
Mrs. Elizabeth Doughty and Miss
Florence McCormack emphasized the
high standards required by the civil
service offices and the Red Cross for
social workers. In answering ques
tions during the informal discussion,
they said that the student planning
to enter this field should take courses

and other yocial sciences.
Various colleges recommended for
their graduate courses were the Uni
versity of California and the Uni
versity of Washington on the Pacific
Coast, and Simmons and Smith in
the East.

this subject are available in Miss
Anastasia Doyle's office.
