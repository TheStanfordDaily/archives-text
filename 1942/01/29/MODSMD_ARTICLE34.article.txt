# Helen Green Designs Colorful, Exotic Costumes for 'Marco'
## 
### 
Venice, Syria, Persia, India, Mongolia, Cathay—these are the cmintries
(hat Marco I'olo visits on his travels in Eugene O'Neill's "Marco Millions,"
to be presented February 5, <i, and 7 in the Memorial Theater. And it is
for the people of these countries that Helen Green has designed over
three hundred costumes for the forthcoming production.

Mrs. Green started her research,
on the costumes last spring, as soon
as it was decided that the Stanford
Players would produce "Marco."
Her material comes from various
sources: National Geographic Maga
zine, chronicles of the period, books
on the history of costume, and fi
nally, Polo's own story, "The Ad
ventures of Marco Polo."
COLORFUL RESULT
From the latter, Mrs. Green took
descriptions of costumes and cus
toms, and then combined them with
O'Neill's satirical comment on the
costumes contained in the script of
his play. The result is a pageant of
colors and materials that will make
"Marco Millions" one of the most
exotic, lavish spectacles ever seen
at Stanford.
In each country that the Polos
visit are found the same representa
tive types: the ruler, the priest, the
warrior, and various members of the
crowd. Thus Mrs. Green has been
able to run the gamut of costum
ing—literally from rags to riches.
VALUABLE COSTUMES
Some of the costumes used in the
play are valuable ancient oriental
robes, donated by Morgan A. Gunst
of San Francisco. Other people have
donated oriental materials and jew
elled dresses to be made into cos
tumes.
In charge of painting and deco
rating the costumes are Dolly Miller
and Betty Nixon; Hal Levitt made
the boots, shoes, and armor. The ad
vanced make-up class is taking care
of the many wigs and masks to be
used in the production.
An exhibit of some of Mrs. Green's
designs and several of the masks
may be seen this week and next in
the window of the Stanford Book
store.
