# Lunch Club Hears Talk On Japanese
## 
### 
Declaring that we must know
j what we stand against in our fight [
; with the Japanese, Dr. Frederick ,
I Spiegelberg, lecturer in religion, 1
j speaking before the Wednesday j
I Luncheon Club, discussed the spir
itual discipline of the Japanese
soldier.
Alter stating that all Japanese of
ficers receive a portion of their
training in Nippon's Buddhist mon
asteries, Dr. Spiegelberg said that
they learned there to fast and un
i dergo other hardships, and are
taught a philosophical detachment j
from the realities of life.
It is such detachment, reinforced
by the supreme patriotism inculcated i
j by modern Shintoism, that enables I
1 these soldiers to order and partici- i
: pate in large-scale atrocities, Dr. ,
j Spiegelberg said.
Dr. Spiegelberg referred to Shinto j
myths as the source of the Japanese J
! "inferiority complex," a feeling that i
they miss something in life by de
| voting themselves to the art and
poetry for which they are renowned. ;
They feel that they must make up j
, for it by military aggression and !
| ruthlessness.
