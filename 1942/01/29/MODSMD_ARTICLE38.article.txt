# Writers' Dinner Will Be a Honey
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 29 (UP). —
Back in 1924 Bill Sloeum, then a
baseball writer, suggested that the
New York scribes toss a party for
Commissioner K. M. Landis as a
token of their appreciation for his
part in saving the fair name of
baseball after the Black Sox scandal.
The affair was attended by about
250 persons and was a tremendous
success. On the afternoon of the day
ol the dinner a bunch of the boys
sat down and wrote a few skits and
rehearsed them.
Out of that modest beginning has
grown baseball's biggest and best
social function—the Baseball Writ
ers' Dinner. It'll be held again Sun
day night at the Hotel Commodore
for the 19th time with an attend
ance list of a thousand, including
all the bigwigs and brass hats in the
game. Tickets are $10 a copy and
all profits from the dinner will be
donated to the American Red Cross.
Arthur Mann. Tom Meany and
the other contributors to the show
have outdone themselves with the
1942 crop of songs and skits. The
boys haven't pulled any punches in
poking fun at the game's heroes and
dignitaries. It promises to be an
evening of fun for all.
