# 'Test' Welch Is New Husky Coach
## 
### 
SEATTLE. Jan. 28 CUP).â€”Ralph
(Pest) Welch, fired as University of
Washington freshman coach barely
six weeks ago, today was named head
football coach in a surprise an
nouncement from the university.
Welch succeeds James Merlin
Phelan, the little Irishman who
brought along the ex-Purdue full
back and backfield coach Chester
(Cotton) Wilcox when he became
the Huskies' head coach 12 years
ago. All three were dismissed Dec.
13 but Welch's name was mentioned
for the head man's spot early in the
quest for candidates, which ranged
far afield.
Ray Eckmann, director of student
activities, said Welch will "ideally
fit the requirements of the univer
sity under present uncertain war
conditions and future program of
the Conference . . . the decision
was reached that under present con
ditions the university should make
as few changes in the athletic pic
ture as possible."
