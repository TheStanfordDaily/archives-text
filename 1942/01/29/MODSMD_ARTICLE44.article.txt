Lee. No wonder. He scored 18 pointy
against Southern California while
taking the place of Fryer, who in
curred a leg infection and was un
able to play.
Lee is a sophomore, O-foot-4, with
plenty on the ball. Apparently the
Bruins' main offensive threat, Lee
is a good rebound artist and floor
man. He learned the cage game at
Torrance High in Los Angeles.
Alshuler, co-captain, is in his third
year at the Bruin camp. Off the
hardwood, Alshuler is president of
the Associated Student.
If these figures don't lie, U.C.L.A.
has averaged the amazing number of
10.54 points per game—.anil brother,
that's a mighty high average for a
team that has won but one encoun
ter in II starts. So maybe you'll spot
the Bruins at least half a chance
tomorrow night when the scries
starts in the Pavilion.

Look at that next to last game:
Trojans 50, Bruins 51. Too close
against a team that every club in the
conference fears. The walls of Troy
came near crumbling in that tete-a
tete.
Look at the Bronco upset: Bruins
07! Stanford could beat Santa Clara
by only 10 points. So take it easy
when you see the Redskins quoted
{js 3-1 favorites to wallop U.C.L.A.
Not that it can't be done. But no
easy task will it be for Coach Ev

Ernie Handelsman, Bruin forward,
has rolled up 104 points in those 11
games, Marv Lee 81, Larry Gitler
