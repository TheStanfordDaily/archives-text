# Swim Outlook Is Not Bright
## 
### 
Faced with the dreary possibility
of not winning a single event, Stan
ford's varsity swimming team tan
gles with the Olympic Club tomor
row night at 8:!J0 in the Post Street
pool.
Stanford's best chances of break
ing into the win column seem to be
in the 50-yard free style with Brad
Young and the 400-yard relay with
Don Smith. Bill Mapel, Ted Munroe,
and Key Rule.
Even these first places are very
doubtful against the power-laden
club group with its roster of P.A.A.,
Junior National, and Pacific Coast
champions.
Included among these stars are
Bill Lucas, American record-holder
in the 200-yard breaststroke and 1300-
yard individual medley, and Junior
National free style champion at all
middle distances; Henry Paris, Pa
cific Coast 220 champion and record
holder; Jim Werson, 19,'!7 American
breaststroke tit list; and Frank Mc-
Guigan, Junior National diving
champion.
Coach Nort Thornton's mermen
will be minus the services of co-
Captain Doc Colyear, still out with
a knee injury, and Bill Dudley,
breaststroke ace, who is still suf
fering from poison oak.
