# Cardinal Nine To Open Season
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team starts the
season this Saturday afternoon
against the Richmond Produce Co.
Yesterday's game against the Ke
neally Seais was cancelled because
of wet grounds. The Cards have
scheduled a game with the Seals
later in the season.
The freshmen's three-game series
with MofYett Field has been post
poned. During the wet weather,
batteries on both squads have been
working out in the practice shed.
