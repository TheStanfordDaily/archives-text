# The 						Hue and Cry

It is recommended the following be read
only after perusing today's Campus Opinion.
i
EX COMMITTEE members and other student
leaders have come in for a great deal of
unwarranted censure because of their actions
on Farm social activities.
Most of this censure is unwarranted because
the censurer does not know what he is talking
about.
As has been said, at Excom and in this col
umn, the University is responsible for us,
whether we like it or not. The University, and
through it the A.S.S.U. and individual campus
organizations, have therefore considered it wise
to restrict off-campus activities. This does not
mean, as Willie II in today's Campus Opinion
would have you believe, that any individual
person cannot on his own hook do whatever
he pleases.
We also urge Willie 11, as we did Willie I,
to go up to the A.S.S.U. office and take a look
at the date calendar. If either of them then
feels that Excom has "blithely canceled all
social activities which tend to keep us here,"
then they are both pretty much out of their
heads.
The Pledge Prom disappeared by decision
of Interfraternity Council since there was no
place to hold such a large dance.
Sure Stanford still "craves" to dance. But
why all the rumpus about name bands? In
years past there have been three dances dur
ing nine months which had big name bands.
One a quarter. If that were the only sacrifice
we were going to have to make in this war, it
would be a cinch. We realize it is a pretty big
sacrifice for the 500 or 600 Stanford couples who
attended these three big dances to give up
ogling their favorite trumpeter or vocalist three
times in a year.
Would a big name dance "help" more people
than the Sadie Hawkins Hop? There is a ca
pacity to the Pavilion, you know.
And if you have got money to waste, go
ahead and waste it.
As for going "crazy from boredom" around
here, if three big name dances and a couple
of off-campus brawls are the only things be
tween you and "going crazy from boredom,"
you can't be getting much out of Stanford. Why
not join the Marines?
And if one dance a year is going to keep fra
ternities closer together, that's a pretty poor
situation too.
There you've got it, Willie.
Our second contributor today is another one
who doesn't seem to be able to have a good
time without dancing to a big name band. Did
he only have a good time three times last year,
too?
His logic in the next paragraph is pretty simi
lar to "lohnny is a good boy, therefore all
Johnnys are good boys." Nobody ever put a
premium on having a good time. We're just too
spoiled. We don't know how to have a good
time any more, unless some big name band is
playing music in person down at the end of
the dance floor.
Had our second contributor been in the Ex
Committee meeting, which decided to let the
Senior Class have Tommy Dorsey, he would
know the only reason was that the seniors
said they had him practically signed, and that
the Senior Class needed the money badly. That
was the only reason. It had already been de
cided that there would be no more name bands
for the rest of the year. This one was going to
be an exception because the dance was all
planned.
But when they found out that they wouldn't
make any money on the dance Â»and that ar
rangements had not been completed, then the
only reason for granting the exception had
vanished. So Excom and the Senior Council
abandoned Dorsey in favor of a local band.
And we would very much like to see you and
a date spend the evening dancing in Peacock
Court without spending a cent during the eve
ning. They don't just operate for fun.
Address all communications to the editor.
