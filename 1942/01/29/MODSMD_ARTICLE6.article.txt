(An Editorial)
THE STANFORD DAILY appears this morning under the stigma
of having presented in its columns false information. Because j
the campus at large has regarded these columns as reliable j
sources in the past, the editorial staff feels compelled to vindicate
its news judgment in some measure on this unfortunate count.
On Tuesday night a phone call to The Daily revealed that
three Stanford men were going to go on duty on the Burma Road. |
The full story, based on this phone call, was printed because the
news it contained was of importance, of interest and of benefit to j
the campus.
The premise was, of course, that no thinking person would
wilfully circulate such important information, were it not true.
And when a fellow calls The Daily and gives as his name the
name of a well-known, prominent Stanford student, there has
been no precedent for doubt.
When that person announces that he is going to Burma to drive
a truck, such a statement is newsworthy. When he says that two
of his fraternity brothers are going along with him, the story
becomes even more important to the rest of the campus.
The stories phoned in by students are appreciated. When
someone calls in to announce the meeting of a group, it has
never, in the past, been considered necessary to contact that
group to check the information.
Stanford students, on the whole, are a sensible and honorable
lot. And when someone phones about himself, there should be
no demand for a more authentic source. This matter of impersona
tion over the phone is a pretty childish business for college stu
dents.
The Daily is a public utility. It renders a service to the student
body and the University by publishing certain information daily.
This service is performed by students in their spare time. If The
Daily were put out by a full-time paid staff who didn't have to
worry about flunking out of school, the paper would undoubt
edly be of a much more professional caliber. Because of these
limiting circumstances, aid and co-operation has been accepted
from all the students. If students don't have the opportunity to
give sincere help, they normally co-operate by silently accepting
the routine efforts of the staff.
In yesterday's unfortunate instance, The Daily received neither
type of co-operation.
It received a contribution on a sub-adolescent plane from some
one who had no thought of social responsibility or of dangerous
consequencesâ€”inconvenience, parental alarm and other factors.
The British Consulate in San Francisco was swamped yester
day with men seeking similar positions because they had seen
the story in The Stanford Daily.
These men were applying for jobs which existed only in the
distorted brains of a couple of Stanford men who thought they
would be "funny" and put one over on The Daily and on their
brothers.
The Daily hopes the satanic glee this little episode furnished a
few Phi Delts has died down and the rest of the student body is
brought to the realization that this is their paper and its quality
varies proportionately with the sincere help and co-operation it
gets from the students.
