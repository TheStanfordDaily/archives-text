### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
IN DEFENSE
TERRIBLY embarrassing thing has happened. A
terrible thing. Just two days before I am to
finish with the column, Jeanette Light has come out
and said that I am a fake, a phony, that I believe
exactly the opposite of what I say in the column,
that the column has all been a base capitalistic plot
to trick the entire Stanford student body, professors
and other scattered readers. I have been exposed and
now you know that I have been lying to you all these
months, so don't believe a single word that I have
said.
All of this happened when a campus opinion was
written saying that contrary to Daily editorial policy I
had been caught smoking on the Quad. The editor's
note, accompanying the campus opinion, has stirred
Miss Light to write her own letter attacking the note
for saying "members of the Daily staff cannot be held
responsible in off hours for adherence to Daily policy."
Maybe the editor's note was confusing but it did not
mean "that editorial policy is a convention unheard
of outside the columns of the newspaper, and that
Stanford tradition, loved subject of Daily Bull Ses
sions, is entirely unconnected with the reporter's
daily life." That is a wrong interpretation, Miss Light.
I'll try to give you the right interpretation.
* * * *
| AM on The Daily and I expect to be held re
sponsible for every single thing that I do. Whatever
I do I am ready to meet the consequences. I don't
want to be placed in "an exclusive little niche," and
I don't want any "special" privileges, and I think that
it is unfair of you to think that I want those privi
leges. When you say that you are not saying the truth
because you don't know me. If I break a rule of a tra
dition, I am ready to face the scorn of anyone that
wants to scorn me. If I think I'm right, the scorn
will not bother me. If I'm wrong, I'll conform. And
that is facing the responsibilities, isn't it Miss Light?
But I don't think it a fair responsibility to have every
personal infraction of the rules that I make, appear
in the newspaper. No one else is held to such public
account for their personal behavior. For my personal
actions. I will take personal responsibility.
Things would get into a terrible state if all per
sonal actions were mentioned in The Daily. There is
never a list in the paper of those who break the Honor
Code, there is never a list in the paper of those who
break the traffic rules, and I'm sure that all of your own
personal action has not been completely in conformity
with the editor's policy and you were never repri
manded in the papers. We on The Daily are no dif
ferent than you. We are personally held responsible
for our action, but not publicly, through the papers.
That is what the editor meant when he said that we
should not be held responsible—responsible in the
paper..
And one other thing. I try to practice what I
preach. If you can quote a column where I upheld the
tradition in question, the tradition that I broke when
I drew on that fateful cigarette, then I will be en
tirely inconsistent, a phony, a faker and a liar.

note, accompanying the campus opinion, has stirred
Miss Light to write her own letter attacking the note
for saying "members of the Daily staff cannot be held
responsible in off hours for adherence to Daily policy."
Maybe the editor's note was confusing but it did not
mean "that editorial policy is a convention unheard
of outside the columns of the newspaper, and that
Stanford tradition, loved subject of Daily Bull Ses
sions, is entirely unconnected with the reporter's
daily life." That is a wrong interpretation, Miss Light.
I'll try to give you the right interpretation.
* * * *
| AM on The Daily and I expect to be held re
sponsible for every single thing that I do. Whatever
I do I am ready to meet the consequences. I don't
want to be placed in "an exclusive little niche," and
I don't want any "special" privileges, and I think that
it is unfair of you to think that I want those privi
leges. When you say that you are not saying the truth
because you don't know me. If I break a rule of a tra
dition, I am ready to face the scorn of anyone that
wants to scorn me. If I think I'm right, the scorn
will not bother me. If I'm wrong, I'll conform. And
that is facing the responsibilities, isn't it Miss Light?
But I don't think it a fair responsibility to have every
personal infraction of the rules that I make, appear
in the newspaper. No one else is held to such public
account for their personal behavior. For my personal
actions. I will take personal responsibility.
Things would get into a terrible state if all per
sonal actions were mentioned in The Daily. There is
never a list in the paper of those who break the Honor
Code, there is never a list in the paper of those who
break the traffic rules, and I'm sure that all of your own
personal action has not been completely in conformity
with the editor's policy and you were never repri
manded in the papers. We on The Daily are no dif
ferent than you. We are personally held responsible
for our action, but not publicly, through the papers.
That is what the editor meant when he said that we
should not be held responsible—responsible in the
paper..
And one other thing. I try to practice what I
preach. If you can quote a column where I upheld the
tradition in question, the tradition that I broke when
I drew on that fateful cigarette, then I will be en
tirely inconsistent, a phony, a faker and a liar.
IN DEFENSE
TERRIBLY embarrassing thing has happened. A
terrible thing. Just two days before I am to
finish with the column, Jeanette Light has come out
and said that I am a fake, a phony, that I believe
exactly the opposite of what I say in the column,
that the column has all been a base capitalistic plot
to trick the entire Stanford student body, professors
and other scattered readers. I have been exposed and
now you know that I have been lying to you all these
months, so don't believe a single word that I have
said.
All of this happened when a campus opinion was
written saying that contrary to Daily editorial policy I
had been caught smoking on the Quad. The editor's
note, accompanying the campus opinion, has stirred
Miss Light to write her own letter attacking the note
for saying "members of the Daily staff cannot be held
responsible in off hours for adherence to Daily policy."
