# CAMPUS OPINION
## POOR WILLIE 
### 
r jPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Yes, regardless of your angry editorial of two days
ago I still sign this Willie 11.
May I ask—Have the Stanford Administrative Bod
ies completely lost their heads? They ask us to please
remain on the campus, and then the next day Ex
Committee blithely cancels all social activities which
would tend to keep us here. They ask us, and God
knows we'd like to comply, to spend less money on
social activities. Yet, the inexpensive Pledge Prom
disappears; the cheap practice of going to your friend's
private off-campus dance is taboo.
Stanford still craves to dance just as the rest of
the world does whether there is a war or not. But
what has there been on the campus to satisfy the
party urge so far this quarter? A Sadie Hawkins
Dance that helped a very few people, and several
dances similar to dancing to the juke box in the
Cellar. That's all. Only San Francisco remains to sat
isfy the urge. But go to San Francisco and poof—the
University's two requests of staying on the campus, and
of spending less money are ignored.
I believe that it is time for Ex Committee to wake
up to the fact that it cannot continue cutting social
activities off the student schedule without putting some
thing back into its place. We'll either all move to
Yosemite or go crazy from boredom around here.
Oh, yes. While I'm on it. The individual fraternity
parties is certainly a mighty poor substitute for the
Pledge Prom—the one function during the year which
tended to bring fraternities closer together. I hope
the esthetic dance group enjoys its floor.
Let me have it, Charlie.
