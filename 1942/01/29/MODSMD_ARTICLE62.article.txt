; r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
i Although the editorial which attempted to answer*
Willie's letter gave reasons (some of them of rather
' dubious value) for some of Ex Committee's new rules,
I it made no attempt to explain the one which ob-
I viously prompted Willie to write the letter—namely,
j the one concerning big name bands. For since it ap
pears that Ex Committee plans to extend the ban to
any band the name of which has ever been mentioned
in public, the campus is indeed in danger of becom
ing a morgue. Cannot Ex Committee see that ban
ning big name bands is not compatible with centering
student social life on campus—that this action merely
induces students to go elsewhere to dance?
The only explanation of this ban which has ever
been given is that to have big name bands would be
"poor taste," which is really no explanation at all
since I am certain that we have not become puritan
nical enough to think that having a good time is "bad
taste."
Perhaps Ex Com supplies the answer itself in the
last sentence of its letter answering that of Willie,
] which reads in part . . and see just how little, if
any, money would have been made from a T. Dorsey
Senior Prom." This statement implies that nothing is
worth while that does not have as its goal the making
of money—that it would, indeed, be inconceivable, j
! perhaps even "bad taste," to have a social function '
solely for the enjoyment of the students. At any rate,
! this "money theory of value" seems to be borne out by ;
\ the fact that while anyone can dance to records for j
nothing in the luxurious Peacock Court, in the Pavilion
(need more be said?) the same privilege cost campus
Daisy Mae's 99 cents each.
