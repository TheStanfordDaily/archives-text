# A.J. Cronin Scores Triumph In 'Keys Of The Kingdom'
## 
### 
"THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM," by A. J. Cronin, published by
Little, Brown, and Company.
Dr. Cronin's first novel in four years is a moving tale of the life trials
of a Catholie missionary in the interior of China. Beginning with the
early life of Francis Chisholm. it traces the development of a deep interest
in people to its ultimate outcome,^

the priesthood, which he entered be- (
cause of the death of Nora, his |
childhood sweetheart.
A complete individualist, he be
lieved that tolerance was the high
est virtue; humility came next. His
superiors at Holywell did not under
stand his nature and branded him
an idealist who could never be a
successful curate.
The Bishop, who becama his sole
friend and confidant, offered him a
Vicariate in China, a thousand miles
from Tientsin. Constantly hindered
by ignorance, hostility, disease,
floods, and famine, he labored to
maintain a Christian mission in a
small Chinese village, with the help
of two Sisters and a loyal Chinese
boy.
The book is filled with exciting ad
venture amidst the battles of two
bandit war lords, struggling for con
trol of the province. The life of
Father Francis is a strange mixture
of triumph and despair. He is con
stantly wondering if, even in his val
iant struggle to convert the Chinese
to the Religion of God, he is not a
failure.
Dr. Cronin's facility for color and
moving drama in his descriptions
and scenes makes this book even
more absorbing than his previous
ones. Beneath it is a deep convic
tion that tenacious faith cannot fail |
to carry the world over even the
most tragic and hearthbreaking
vicissitudes. The chief character
serves as a fine example of the part
that religion has the chance to play
in our world today.—Craig

and scenes makes this book even
more absorbing than his previous
ones. Beneath it is a deep convic

to carry the world over even the
most tragic and hearthbreaking
vicissitudes. The chief character
serves as a fine example of the part
that religion has the chance to play
in our world today.—Craig
