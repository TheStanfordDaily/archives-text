# Albany Given New 'Glimmer of Hope'

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28 (UP).
â€”Plans to abandon reorganization of
the bankrupt Golden Gate Turf Club
at Albany were suspended for 60
days today by Federal Judge A. F.
St. Sure to await developments in
financing problems and the war sit
uation.
The reorganization committee,
however, was given permission to
stop expenditure of $2500 a month
in maintenance costs, and to sell
some furnishings of the track to
bolster the treasury, which has
dropped to $9,000. Groups interested
in reopening the lavish race track
said they still hold a "faint glimmer
of hope" for reviving it.
Free postage on letters of all sol
diers, sailors and others in the armed
forces was voted recently by the
Senate.
