gets -to say goodbye
but me. Everyone gets to write
something sentimental or philo
sophical or whimsical by way of
farewell and then sign off with a
tear-choked and impressive "30."
Except me.
I'm not going anywhere. I shall,
like Freshman Biology, be here
quite inevitably at 8 o'clock Mon
day morning, still achieving, still
pursuing, learning to labor, and to
wait. When you pick up the pa
l>er with a gleam in your eye to
see who's writing History in Vol
ume 101 it won't be Phobia
Thompson or Egnima Buchanan
or even Anonymous.
It'll be me, and I'm sorry that
you're going to be disappointed, but
I like this job, and I asked for it
again, though maybe you didn't, and
I convinced everyone on Edit Board
by threatening to turn them all over
to the Paly Draft Board if they
didn't give in. You see they did.
So, here it is, the last issue of
Volume 100. and everyone gets to
wax literarily maudlin except me,
but I'm going to take advantage of
this special occasion to not write
about the war for a change because
this is as good an excuse as any I
can think of at the moment.

r JpHE DAILY isn't like the Palo Alto
Times or the San Francisco
Chronicle, where the passing of a
volume means nothing more nor less
than a minute change in the Roman
numeral on the masthead, which no
body notices anyhow. Everything is
of great consequence around here,
even the editor, and each volume is
a milestone, and as it passes we all
rise and make appropriate salaams
and huzzas.
And the Last Column is a mile
stone too and a thing of great con
sequence— usually a source of
sadness to its author and of un
bounded joy to its readers. (This
isn't a Last Column, you under
stand. so it's an exception.)
But in a traditional Last Column
you get a unique exhibition almost
always of the inner working of a
columnist's mind. You get the rare
and breathtaking experience of see
ing just how that fabulous and
highly complex mechanism really
works, what makes it tick, and all
that sort of thing.

HPHIS mystical treat is made avail
able to each and every fortu
nate reader because on that last day
the columnist breaks down, over
comes his natural reticence and
modesty, and proceeds to give you
a fair synthesis of his personal
Weltanschauung, or else pat himself
on the back for making so many
brilliant predictions that material
ized, and then winds up with one
final devastating prediction, and in
cidentally a bouquet for his suc
cessor.
I can't do this right now be
cause I am my successor, so I
can't just yet cast my normal reti
cence and modesty to the winds to
tell you how good I was last vol
ume, and how good I am still go
ing to be next volume. We both
know all about that anyway.
And I won't make any predictions
either. I'm not going to stick my
neck out just because it's custo
mary to do so, at least not while
I still have another volume to go. I
may be small, but I am plenty wiry
and cagey.

philosophy of life but I can't do

volume means nothing more nor less
than a minute change in the Roman
numeral on the masthead, which no
body notices anyhow. Everything is
of great consequence around here,
even the editor, and each volume is
a milestone, and as it passes we all
rise and make appropriate salaams
and huzzas.
And the Last Column is a mile
stone too and a thing of great con
sequence— usually a source of
sadness to its author and of un
bounded joy to its readers. (This
isn't a Last Column, you under
stand. so it's an exception.)
But in a traditional Last Column
you get a unique exhibition almost
always of the inner working of a
columnist's mind. You get the rare
and breathtaking experience of see
ing just how that fabulous and
highly complex mechanism really
works, what makes it tick, and all
that sort of thing.

So, here it is, the last issue of
Volume 100. and everyone gets to
wax literarily maudlin except me,
but I'm going to take advantage of
this special occasion to not write
about the war for a change because
this is as good an excuse as any I
can think of at the moment.

r JpHE DAILY isn't like the Palo Alto
Times or the San Francisco
Chronicle, where the passing of a
volume means nothing more nor less
than a minute change in the Roman
numeral on the masthead, which no
body notices anyhow. Everything is
of great consequence around here,
even the editor, and each volume is
a milestone, and as it passes we all
rise and make appropriate salaams
and huzzas.
And the Last Column is a mile
stone too and a thing of great con
sequence— usually a source of
sadness to its author and of un
bounded joy to its readers. (This
isn't a Last Column, you under
stand. so it's an exception.)
But in a traditional Last Column
you get a unique exhibition almost
always of the inner working of a
columnist's mind. You get the rare
and breathtaking experience of see
ing just how that fabulous and
highly complex mechanism really
works, what makes it tick, and all
that sort of thing.

HPHIS mystical treat is made avail
able to each and every fortu
nate reader because on that last day
the columnist breaks down, over
comes his natural reticence and
modesty, and proceeds to give you
a fair synthesis of his personal
Weltanschauung, or else pat himself
on the back for making so many
brilliant predictions that material
ized, and then winds up with one
final devastating prediction, and in
cidentally a bouquet for his suc
cessor.
I can't do this right now be
cause I am my successor, so I
can't just yet cast my normal reti
cence and modesty to the winds to
tell you how good I was last vol
ume, and how good I am still go
ing to be next volume. We both
know all about that anyway.
And I won't make any predictions
either. I'm not going to stick my
neck out just because it's custo
mary to do so, at least not while
I still have another volume to go. I
may be small, but I am plenty wiry
and cagey.

'T'HE only thing left for me to do
here is to tell you about my
philosophy of life but I can't do
that either because if I do then I
wont' have anything to write about
when the honest-to-goodness Last
Column does come around at the
end of Volume 101.
So I'll put an impressive, but not
tear-choked "30' in right now with
a Hail to 101 and a Farewell to 100.
gets -to say goodbye
but me. Everyone gets to write
something sentimental or philo
sophical or whimsical by way of
farewell and then sign off with a
tear-choked and impressive "30."
Except me.
I'm not going anywhere. I shall,
like Freshman Biology, be here
quite inevitably at 8 o'clock Mon
day morning, still achieving, still
pursuing, learning to labor, and to
wait. When you pick up the pa
l>er with a gleam in your eye to
see who's writing History in Vol
ume 101 it won't be Phobia
Thompson or Egnima Buchanan
or even Anonymous.
It'll be me, and I'm sorry that
you're going to be disappointed, but
I like this job, and I asked for it
again, though maybe you didn't, and
I convinced everyone on Edit Board
by threatening to turn them all over
to the Paly Draft Board if they
didn't give in. You see they did.
So, here it is, the last issue of
Volume 100. and everyone gets to
wax literarily maudlin except me,
but I'm going to take advantage of
this special occasion to not write
about the war for a change because
this is as good an excuse as any I
