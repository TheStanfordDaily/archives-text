### 
With Stanford responding "gen
erously" to the request for 4,000
dimes, the "March of Dimes" cam
paign today enters' its thii'd and
next-to-last day. All Farm sorori
ties have contributed 100 per cent,
according to Bill Green, drive
chairman.
Reports were not available on
how fast fraternities were filling
their containers, but Chairman Green
stated that several houses had do
nated 100 per cent and others were
rapidly reaching their quota.
'GOING NICELY'
Statistics were also unavailable for
both men's and women's halls. Cam
paign representatives in the halls
reported that the drive was "going
nicely." El Toro was the first eat
ing club to turn in 100 per cent.
Elm and Hawthorne Cottages of the
Union Unit, were among the first to
contribute 100 per cent.
"If contributions continue at this
rate," Gi'een said, "we may surpass
last year's donation of $400. Let's
give generously today and tomor
row and see if we can't top last
year's mark."
50-50 SPLIT
