## 
### 
Staff members of the Carillon last
night unanimously elected Charles
Bull editor of that literary maga
zine. Bull, who retires from the
Daily editorship today, will suc
ceed Clarence Burley as top man on
the relatively new Farm magazine.
Burley, who planned and plugged
the literary publication for weeks
last spring before Ex Committee
gave him the "go" signal, grad
uates this March. He is a member
of El Cuadro eating club.
"The need for such a publication
at Stanford is clear and it is recog
nized by the students who have sup
ported it," said Bull last night after
his election. "We'll try to see that
it continues to warrant their sup
port."
Bull, an El Toro, has workecfc on
the Daily since he entered Stanford
as a freshman. God and the Naval
Air Corps willing, he plans to grad
uate in June.
The next issue of the Carillon will
appeal - on Feb. 18 and will be the
last under the editorship of Burley.
