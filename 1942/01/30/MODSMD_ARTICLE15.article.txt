# Jap Troops Forge to Within 31 Miles Of Singapore; U.S. Unifies Commands
## Anssies Cinch Battle Lines 
### 
SINGAPORE, Jan. 29 (UP).—A 9
p.m. curfew was proclaimed tonight
as Japanese troops pushed down the
Malaya railway, through the center
of the Imperial defense line, to
within 31 miles of Singapore Island.
Military spokesmen estimated that
from Jive to six Japanese divisions
(75.000 to 90,000 men) were driving
down through the southern end of
the Malay Peninsula, amply sup
ported by tanks and airplanes, and
they tacitly admitted that Singapore
was in for a siege. They gave every
indication that they believed it
would hold.
Australians struggled to hold the
center of the battle line with bay
onets and artillery, and they claimed
to he inflicting 10 casualties on the
Japanese for every one of their own,
but the invasion spearhead had
reachcd Layang-Layang, only 31
miles and four railway stations re
moved from Singapore.

The Imperial right flank was an

Sedili River, 38 miles above Singa
pore on the East Malaya coast, and
the left flank was in the Rcngit sec

Official press conferences were be

stressed the fact that the Japanese
troops have been hardened by years
of fighting in China. He said the
Imperials were unable to compete
with the invaders' ability to subsist
off the land, or to adjust themselves
to the invaders' Simian ability in
the jungles.

However, he said, the Imperials

The Imperial right flank was an
chored at the mouth of the Hula
Sedili River, 38 miles above Singa
pore on the East Malaya coast, and
the left flank was in the Rcngit sec
tor, 40 miles up the west coast. In
the center, the Japanese had ad
vanced 18 miles from Kluang in two
days.
Official press conferences were be
coming briefer daily as the critical
situation became more apparent. A
military spokesman this evening
stressed the fact that the Japanese
troops have been hardened by years
of fighting in China. He said the
Imperials were unable to compete
with the invaders' ability to subsist
off the land, or to adjust themselves
to the invaders' Simian ability in
the jungles.
SAVING 'MEN
However, he said, the Imperials
are fighting as hard as they possibly
can, and are retiring only under
pressure, continuing their policy of
conserving manpower.
The defense strategy, the spokes
man said, is to give ground to the
invaders in exchange for time, since
Prime Minister Churchill has prom
ised that reinforcements arc coming.
SINGAPORE, Jan. 29 (UP).—A 9
p.m. curfew was proclaimed tonight
as Japanese troops pushed down the
Malaya railway, through the center
of the Imperial defense line, to
within 31 miles of Singapore Island.
Military spokesmen estimated that
from Jive to six Japanese divisions
(75.000 to 90,000 men) were driving
down through the southern end of
the Malay Peninsula, amply sup
ported by tanks and airplanes, and
they tacitly admitted that Singapore
was in for a siege. They gave every
indication that they believed it
would hold.
Australians struggled to hold the
center of the battle line with bay
onets and artillery, and they claimed
to he inflicting 10 casualties on the
Japanese for every one of their own,
but the invasion spearhead had
reachcd Layang-Layang, only 31
miles and four railway stations re
moved from Singapore.
