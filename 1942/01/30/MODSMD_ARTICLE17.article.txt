# Movie Series Shows Garbo Epic Sunday
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
The story of an Irish braggart, a j
drunken bargee, an old troll, and a |
Swedish prostitute, against a back
ground of sea, docks, and coal, is
"Anna Christie," Eugene O'Neill's
great drama, and Greta Garbo's first
talking picture.
It is the picture that made Greta
Garbo, Marie Dressier, and the di
rector, Clarence Brown. When
movie audiences first saw it, the re
action was not always good, but
there was always a strong reaction.
And few pictures have had a more
decisive effect on later movie his
tory.
REALISTIC PORTRAYAL
"Anna Christie," which shows
Sunday night as the second of the
Sadler Sunday Series, is a down-to
earth portrayal of a woman who
blames her unfortunate past on an
unsuspecting father, Old Man
Christie, who periodically shakes his
fist and curses the sea. Anna falls
in love with the Irishman, and the
story reaches a climax when she
tells her father and sweetheart why
she cannot marry. This role has
often since been termed Greta Gar
bo's outstanding individual per
formance. (That, you will recall,
was before they tried to make a
comedienne out of her.)
At that time Greta Garbo and
Marie Dressier were the two great
est actresses of the stage. But a
year later Marie Dressier won the
Academy Award and Greta Garbo
rose to the top of the box office, and
this is the only picture in which
they appear together.
AFTER-DINNER DATES
These Sunday movies are sug
gested for after-dinner dates, as a
part of the Back to the Campus
campaign. The crowd was so large
last time that the movie was held
up a quarter of an hour for the long
lines to get seats. It is therefore
recommended that students arrive a
few minutes early so the perform
ance can start on time.
Admission is 20 cents, and the
I cartoons are scheduled to begin at
! 7:15, in Memorial Hall. The program
will also include the second chap- I
ter of the serial, "Buck* Rogers." Two
weeks from Sunday night the fea- ;
ture will be "The Private Life of i
, Henry VIII," starring Charles
i Laughton and Merle Oberon.
