WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (UP).—
Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson
disclosed tonight that unified army
and navy commands have been es
tablished in four vital war zones —
Hawaii, the Panama Canal, the west
cm Caribbean and the Far East—to
provide the co-ordination so tragi
cally lacking when Japan attacked
Pearl Harbor.
Simultaneously, he announced a
four-pronged shift which placed
Brigadier General Carl Spaatz in the
all-important post of chief of the
army air combat forces. Spaatz fills
the vacancy created when Lieuten
ant General Delos C. Emmons be
came chief of the army's Hawaiian
Department succeeding deposed
General Walter C. Short.
LENGTHY PLANS
Stimson told a press conference
that for "many months" prior tr
Pari Harbor the question of unity of
command had been under "earnest
study by the army and navy."
"It has been accentuated since the
war began," he said. "It has been
accomplished in some places already.
"For example, in Hawaii, the com
mand is under the navy; in the Pan
ama area under an air officer of the
army; in the western Caribbean, in
cluding Puerto Rico, under the navy,
and in the Far Ea.st. under (Brit
ish) General Sir Archibald Wavcll."
COMMANDS LISTED
Thus, from the maze of overlap
ping jurisdictions which existed be
fore Dec. 7, there emerged this pic
ture of command unity:
1. Hawaiian area: Supreme com
mand is Admiral Chester W. Nimilz,
commander of the U.S. Pacific fleet,
with Lieutenant General Delos Em
mons, the army commander in Ha
waii, as subordinate.
2. Panama Canal Zone: Supreme
command in Lieutenant General
Frank Andrews of the army, with
navy officials in subordinate posi
tions.
3. Western Caribbean: Supreme
command in a naval officer, Rear Ad
miral J. H. Hoover, with army offi
cials as subordinates.
4. Far East: WavclPs principal
deputy is Lieutenant General George
H. Brett of the U.S. air corps, with
Admiral Thomas C. Hart in charge
of all Allied naval operations.
