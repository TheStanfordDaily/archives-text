WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (UP).—
The sinking of at least one enemy
submarine was revealed tonight si
multaneously with a Navy announce
ment of "increasingly effective"
counter-measures against maraud
ers off the eastern seaboard and dis
closure by the 11th Naval District at
Los Angeles that a hostile underseas
craft in southern California waters
has been attacked by Navy planes.
The announced sinking brings to
20 the total of underseas craft offi
cially revealed to have been de
stroyed by American forces in both
oceans.
The known sinking—in an undis
closed area—was made public when
the Navy released this radio mes
sage from a naval pilot:
"Sighted sub: sank same."
The Navy refused to disclose the
scene or time of the action but in
dicated plainly that it had no con
nection with the Los Angeles an

dropped depth charges on the west
coast marauder.
Further indication that the actions
were not the same was seen in the

when sighted by an Army plane
and that Naval aircraft rushed to the
scene dropped depth charges "in the
area."
