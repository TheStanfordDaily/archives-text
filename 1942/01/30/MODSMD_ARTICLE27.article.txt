# SELBY IS "MODERN MARCO"
## Male Lead Follows In Polo's Footsteps 
### HELEN LIVINGSTON 
A modern Marco Polo—this is the
title one might easily apply to Lisle
Selby, who is playing the leading
role in "Marco Millions," to be pre
sented February 5, (i, and 7 in the
Memorial Theater.
Selby has traveled in almost all of
the countries that Marco visits in the
piny, although, unlike his counter
part, not in the capacity of salesman.
In 19117 he spent nine months in the
Orient, taking in China, Japan, and
the East Indies.
He stayed for a time in Peking, the
city built by Kublai Khan, which
the ruler called Khanbalig. He was
forced to leave the city when the
lighl at the Marco Polo Bridge that
started the Sino-Japanese War broke
out. He went to Japan and enrolled
in tl'e university at Tokyo. There
he saw the Japanese preparing for
their war with China, practicing
blackouts, attending to civilian de
fense, and speeding up all war in
dustries.
His trip to Indo-China followed
practically the same route as the

voyage on which Marco goes to con
duct the Chinese Princess Kukachin
to her new husband, Arghum Khan
of Persia.
To make the picture complete,
Selby spent some time traveling in
Italy, and stayed for a while in
Venice, the home town of Marco
Polo.
