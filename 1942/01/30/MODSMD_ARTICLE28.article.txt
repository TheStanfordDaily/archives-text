## 
### 
SeYny considers the part of Marco
one of the best he has ever had.
"It's a swell part to play, but 1 kind
of feel sorry for the guy. There are
i too many people like him in the
world—selfish, conceited, and com
pletely wrapped up in the almighty
dollar," he says.
Although comparatively new to
the Stanford stage, Selby is by no
means a novice. In Sacramento
Junior College, and at the Univer
sity of California, where he got his
degree, he appeared in such plays as
"Liliom," "Elizabeth the Queen,"
"Mary of Scotland," "The Merchant
of Yonkers," "Daughters of At reus,"
"Anatole," "Family Portrait," and
O'Neill's "All God's Chillun Got
Wings."
The toughest thing he has had to
do yet in "Marco Millions" has
nothing to do with acting, he claims.
For Helen Green's class in costum
ing and make-up he had to create a
red wig that Marco's childhood
sweetheart, Donata, wears in the
play. And he is still bearing the
honorable scars of his battle with an
oversized needle.
