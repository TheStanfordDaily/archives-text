in what city sport scribes termed
one of the biggest farces ever seen
in San Francisco high school hoop
history.

Evidentaly the Eagles' fiery men
tor, Lloyd Leith, a sideshow in him
self, at any man's game, didn't like
the Sacred Heart's man-to-man de
fense set-up, and he told his team
I to freeze the ball. They iced up so
I efficiently that they let the other
team out-bore them and lost their
first start this year. They pre
| viously have topped Galileo 31-20,
i and won their opener from Abra
ham Lincoln High.
The Washingtonians are a group
of individualists, with their offense
! directed by pint-sized Guard Ellis,
I who had a chance for a free throw
to tie the score in the Sacred Heart
( game but refused to shoot until the
; crowd quieted down. He waited so
long that the referee took it away
j from him. Supporting characters in
clude the lanky forwards Gerstner
j and Smith, center Harris, and guard
Dierkes.
Saturday the Palo Alto game
brings the Card frosh to their first
official test against the downtown
I neighbors, the teams having played
| some scrimmage clashes this year.
Starting line-ups tonight:
Stanford Geo. Washington
Parsons RF Gerstner
Barsocehini I.F Smith
Ileald C Harris
Hall L G Ellis
Brown KG Dierkes
