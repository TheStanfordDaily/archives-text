# Ucla- Cards Clash Tonight
## 'Didn't Come To Lose,' Says Bruin Coach 
### BOB SONTAG 
"We didn't come up to lose it."
Thats' the word straight from Wil
bur Johns, U.C.L.A. basketball
coach, yesterday as he stepped off the
train ;it Paly station with 14 players
and a manager in tow. We thought
the Indians were tall, but when
Long John O'Brien, G-feet-8, peered
down from up above, we just tied
right up and decided then and
there that the Bruins' 6-feet-2 aver
age is enough to do plenty tonight
when the two clubs tangle in the
Pavilion at. 8.
SQUAD WORKS OUT
After a workout in the Pavilion
last night, Johns was to bed the
boys down at the President Hotel
and thence take up where California
left off last Friday.
The Uclans' mentor also corrected
us on yesterday's scores. The Bruins
not only licked Loyola of Los An
geles, but also Nebraska University.
And that Trojan game. Johns said
the score was even-steven wyth a
couple of minutes to go, and that
only fatigue on the Bruins' part
kept them from hanging on to the
end. At that the score was only
59-51.
DOUBLE-HEADER
For the first time this season Coach
Everett Dean will ask the Redmeti
to handle a two-night assignment
against a fast club. For the first
time they will be forced to go at
top speed without the regular
week-end respite.
As for the orange colored basket
ball rims, you may see rings before
your eyes before the game is over.
The two squads meet again tomor
row night.

The Uclans' mentor also corrected
us on yesterday's scores. The Bruins
not only licked Loyola of Los An
geles, but also Nebraska University.
And that Trojan game. Johns said
the score was even-steven wyth a
couple of minutes to go, and that
only fatigue on the Bruins' part
kept them from hanging on to the
end. At that the score was only
59-51.
DOUBLE-HEADER
For the first time this season Coach
Everett Dean will ask the Redmeti
to handle a two-night assignment
against a fast club. For the first
time they will be forced to go at
top speed without the regular
week-end respite.
As for the orange colored basket
ball rims, you may see rings before
your eyes before the game is over.
The two squads meet again tomor
row night.
Line-ups:
U.C.L.A. STANFORD
Ilamlelsman F Burness
Lee F Pollard
Panovich C Yoss
Gitler G Cowden
Alshuler G Dallmar
