# Farm Swimmers Face Olympics
## 
### 
With little chance of victory, Stan
ford's varsity swimming team faces
the powerful Olympic Club mermen
tonight at 8:30 in San Francisco.
The Post Streeters, unbeaten in
dual meet competition in four years,
can field one of the strongest swim
teams in the country if all their
men show. Their entry list is studded
with Junior National. Pacific Coast,
and P.A.A. champions such as Jim
Werson, Bill Lucas, Henry Paris, Ray
Taft, and Frank McGurgan.
Stanford's best opportunity for a
first place seems to be in the 50-
yard free style with Brad Young or
the 400-yard free .style with Don
Smith. Bill Mapel, Ted Munroe and
Rev Rule.
