### DON SELBY 
SO the time comes when I have to move and lot the new sports
editor. H. D. Thoreauâ€”a very good man take over.
It really doesnt' seem like it's time to do that yet, for wasnt' it only a
week or two ago that the volume started? It seems that way, but I guess
lhe calendar isn't fibbing.
The job hasn't been hard, chiefly because things have moved along
rather smoothly on the Stanford sports front.

Clark Shaughnessy's gridders <
were :>.n extremely volorful team,
providing plenty to write about de
spite the fact that they didn't cop
tiie championship as expected. The
fresh football outfit was good. too.
Although the water polo team
couldn't quite manage to take the
conference title, Coach Nort Thorn
ton's lads had a successful season
and broke precedent by waxing Cal
twice during the season. The soccer
team was good atlhough hexed by a
number of tie outcomes.
And the Big Red Machine of the
hardwood, Coach Everett Dean's
smooth-functioning basketball team,
has started on what now appears to
be another direct road to the south
ern division championship.
And now a short note to my suc
cessor.

IJEAR H.D.:
There are quite a few people on
this campus woh can make things a
lot easier for you. They've helped
me a lot.
Don Liehendorfer, the friendly
fellow in the cubby-hole in the
main B.A.C. office, knows most of
the answers when it comes to
Stanford sports. Red Holman, di
rector of intramural athletics, will
be of aid many times. So will the
coaches, like Marchie Schwartz,
Everett Dean, Phil Bengtson, John
ny Lamb, Harry Wolter, Harry
Shipkey, Eddie Twiggs, Pitch John
son, Harry Maloney, and a great
many others.
And, H.D., you have a lot of good
men to work with and for you on
the sports staff. Some of them are
old standbys; others are just be
ginning. You certainly could never
get along without them.
808 SONTAG. for instance, has
been one of the most consistent
writers on the staff for the past two
years. And he knows his sports.

BILL HORNBY is moving up rap
idly and has done a great deal
toward improving the caliber of the
sports page during Volume 100. The
same can be said of NEWT WISE,
FERRIS BOOTH E. DICK KEU
SINK. AL HAMPSON. 808 HAN
NAH, 808 WALT, and many others.
Lots of luck. H.D. And this is
really -150- to SLANTS for me.
