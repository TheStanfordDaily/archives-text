# Dear Shaf:
## 
### 
THIS old swivel chair behind the messy
green-top desk has grown to seem just
like home in the past few months. I've been
sitting in it now for two hours just trying to
think of some new way to fill this last column.
And I've been thinking over what the six
other editors during our years here have said
in their wind-ups.
Regardless of how you try to say it, the es
sence is always, "So long—it's been swell —
best of luck, old man."
Any words I might put down here about
The Daily, about Stanford, its students and their
peculiar whims, would be entirely unneces
sary, Shaf.
There are many jobs left undone by Vol. 100
which will be up to you. Voters are going to
have to be convinced that the proposed three
day election system is the best thing which
could happen to student democracy. Carry on
the torch and try to make erring campus opin
ioners aware of Stanford's on-campus social
program which, as you know, is very real. And
don't let anybody else think they can use The
Daily for their so-called "practical jokes." We
could still use a deck on that other useless
half of the Boathouse. And don't worry about
being called a "mossback" for keeping old
Stanford traditions going. I heard a lone law
student whistle at some girl who walked down
their once sacred steps yesterday. The rest of
his cohorts were smoking on the Quad. And
I saw five cars pass up a couple of kids wait
ing for a ride to Paly yesterday, too. Yes,
Shaf, there are a lot of things left to be done
by Volume 101.
101 is going to be a war volume. Those
little clickings out in the M.E.'s office are going
to mean a lot more to you and to Stanford than
they ever have before. But in reporting and
analyzing all the war news and propaganda,
keep Stanford thinking about winning the
peace, too.
And, Hal, you have the staff, which with its
top-notch leadership is going to be able to put
out the best Daily seen around here in a long
time. There are only a few of us who won't
be around the Shack guite as much as we were
this time. The place will seem pretty quiet
without Bud, the guy with the legs and curly
locks who really made an assignment sheet
mean something. But you won't be able to
keep him away. Nobody could put down in
words what it has meant to have a Women's
Editor like Romie. But without Council and
the tryoutees to keep her occupied, you wait
and see how often she'll be around the old
hangout.
You can't realize, until it's almost too late, that
it's the staff that makes the paper. We get the
credit, and the blame, too, but without that
bunch out in the back room always plugging
away, The Daily wouldn't be much.
Fellows like Herm who'll do anything that
comes along—write edits, stories, take over
Bud's job for a couple of weeks—they're few
and far between, Shaf.
And what a crew of N.E.'s we had—Hap and
Vic and Johnny, Claudia and Martha and Jean.
Tops, all of them.
There were a couple of live wires named Don
and H.D. inside that door marked "Sports," too.
You have to sit on those Biz Office bozos
once in a while, but you know they're really
"all wool and a yard wide."
And you know as well as I do what a bang
up job the rest of the gang did, the kids who
wrote the feeches and reviews, who sat in the
slot and around the rim, the ones who edited
reams of UP copy, read proof and copy 'til they
were blue in the face. They are all going to
be back working for you, Shaf. They'll be do
ing different jobs, but whatever it is you want
done, they'll turn it out.

Of course, we all know it's Charley and Bat
who are the original "indispensable men."
Time and space are getting short. That "30"
is getting closer. Best of everything to you, old
man, and drop over to The Carillon office once
in a while.

time. There are only a few of us who won't
be around the Shack guite as much as we were
this time. The place will seem pretty quiet
without Bud, the guy with the legs and curly
locks who really made an assignment sheet
mean something. But you won't be able to
keep him away. Nobody could put down in
words what it has meant to have a Women's
Editor like Romie. But without Council and
the tryoutees to keep her occupied, you wait
and see how often she'll be around the old
hangout.
You can't realize, until it's almost too late, that
it's the staff that makes the paper. We get the
credit, and the blame, too, but without that
bunch out in the back room always plugging
away, The Daily wouldn't be much.
Fellows like Herm who'll do anything that
comes along—write edits, stories, take over
Bud's job for a couple of weeks—they're few
and far between, Shaf.
And what a crew of N.E.'s we had—Hap and
Vic and Johnny, Claudia and Martha and Jean.
Tops, all of them.
There were a couple of live wires named Don
and H.D. inside that door marked "Sports," too.
You have to sit on those Biz Office bozos
once in a while, but you know they're really
"all wool and a yard wide."
And you know as well as I do what a bang
up job the rest of the gang did, the kids who
wrote the feeches and reviews, who sat in the
slot and around the rim, the ones who edited
reams of UP copy, read proof and copy 'til they
were blue in the face. They are all going to
be back working for you, Shaf. They'll be do
ing different jobs, but whatever it is you want
done, they'll turn it out.

Of course, we all know it's Charley and Bat
who are the original "indispensable men."
Time and space are getting short. That "30"
is getting closer. Best of everything to you, old
man, and drop over to The Carillon office once
in a while.
Chas.
THIS old swivel chair behind the messy
green-top desk has grown to seem just
like home in the past few months. I've been
sitting in it now for two hours just trying to
think of some new way to fill this last column.
And I've been thinking over what the six
other editors during our years here have said
in their wind-ups.
Regardless of how you try to say it, the es
sence is always, "So long—it's been swell —
best of luck, old man."
Any words I might put down here about
The Daily, about Stanford, its students and their
peculiar whims, would be entirely unneces
sary, Shaf.
There are many jobs left undone by Vol. 100
which will be up to you. Voters are going to
have to be convinced that the proposed three
day election system is the best thing which
could happen to student democracy. Carry on
the torch and try to make erring campus opin
ioners aware of Stanford's on-campus social
program which, as you know, is very real. And
don't let anybody else think they can use The
Daily for their so-called "practical jokes." We
could still use a deck on that other useless
half of the Boathouse. And don't worry about
being called a "mossback" for keeping old
Stanford traditions going. I heard a lone law
student whistle at some girl who walked down
their once sacred steps yesterday. The rest of
his cohorts were smoking on the Quad. And
I saw five cars pass up a couple of kids wait
ing for a ride to Paly yesterday, too. Yes,
Shaf, there are a lot of things left to be done
by Volume 101.
101 is going to be a war volume. Those
little clickings out in the M.E.'s office are going
to mean a lot more to you and to Stanford than
they ever have before. But in reporting and
analyzing all the war news and propaganda,
keep Stanford thinking about winning the
peace, too.
And, Hal, you have the staff, which with its
top-notch leadership is going to be able to put
out the best Daily seen around here in a long

man, and drop over to The Carillon office once
in a while.
Chas.
THIS old swivel chair behind the messy
green-top desk has grown to seem just
like home in the past few months. I've been
sitting in it now for two hours just trying to
think of some new way to fill this last column.
And I've been thinking over what the six
other editors during our years here have said
in their wind-ups.
Regardless of how you try to say it, the es
sence is always, "So long—it's been swell —
best of luck, old man."
Any words I might put down here about
The Daily, about Stanford, its students and their
peculiar whims, would be entirely unneces
sary, Shaf.
There are many jobs left undone by Vol. 100
which will be up to you. Voters are going to
have to be convinced that the proposed three
day election system is the best thing which
could happen to student democracy. Carry on
the torch and try to make erring campus opin
ioners aware of Stanford's on-campus social
program which, as you know, is very real. And
don't let anybody else think they can use The
Daily for their so-called "practical jokes." We
could still use a deck on that other useless
half of the Boathouse. And don't worry about
being called a "mossback" for keeping old
Stanford traditions going. I heard a lone law
student whistle at some girl who walked down
their once sacred steps yesterday. The rest of
his cohorts were smoking on the Quad. And
I saw five cars pass up a couple of kids wait
ing for a ride to Paly yesterday, too. Yes,
Shaf, there are a lot of things left to be done
by Volume 101.
101 is going to be a war volume. Those
little clickings out in the M.E.'s office are going
to mean a lot more to you and to Stanford than
they ever have before. But in reporting and
analyzing all the war news and propaganda,
keep Stanford thinking about winning the
peace, too.
And, Hal, you have the staff, which with its
top-notch leadership is going to be able to put
out the best Daily seen around here in a long
time. There are only a few of us who won't
be around the Shack guite as much as we were
this time. The place will seem pretty quiet
without Bud, the guy with the legs and curly
locks who really made an assignment sheet
mean something. But you won't be able to
keep him away. Nobody could put down in
words what it has meant to have a Women's
Editor like Romie. But without Council and
the tryoutees to keep her occupied, you wait
and see how often she'll be around the old
hangout.
You can't realize, until it's almost too late, that
it's the staff that makes the paper. We get the
credit, and the blame, too, but without that
bunch out in the back room always plugging
away, The Daily wouldn't be much.
Fellows like Herm who'll do anything that
comes along—write edits, stories, take over
Bud's job for a couple of weeks—they're few
and far between, Shaf.
And what a crew of N.E.'s we had—Hap and
Vic and Johnny, Claudia and Martha and Jean.
Tops, all of them.
There were a couple of live wires named Don
and H.D. inside that door marked "Sports," too.
You have to sit on those Biz Office bozos
once in a while, but you know they're really
"all wool and a yard wide."
And you know as well as I do what a bang
up job the rest of the gang did, the kids who
wrote the feeches and reviews, who sat in the
slot and around the rim, the ones who edited
reams of UP copy, read proof and copy 'til they
were blue in the face. They are all going to
be back working for you, Shaf. They'll be do
ing different jobs, but whatever it is you want
done, they'll turn it out.

Of course, we all know it's Charley and Bat
who are the original "indispensable men."
Time and space are getting short. That "30"
is getting closer. Best of everything to you, old
man, and drop over to The Carillon office once
in a while.
