# BULL SESSION
## SO LONG 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
so the time Has come when I am through. The
time has come fast. It seems no more than a week
ago that I wrote my first column and lost the first
ten friends. The time has come and I am very sad,
even though the sun is shining and there is a brown
squirrel outside my window. I have enjoyed myself
all these months, writing this column. Even though I
had to rush to the shack every afternoon and type
instead of taking a nap, I have enjoyed this more
than anything else that I have ever done. I'm sorry
that it is over.
I hope that you will all get from this life all that
you want and all that you expect. I can only tell you
to try to decide what things you do want and expcct,
what things you would like to have. I ask you to try
to decide so that you will know what you are looking
for, so that you will know what you are going to
school for, sleeping and waking up for, struggling and
working for. Unless you know the things you want
and are able to recognize them when you have them,
you will never be satisfied and never happy. Know
what you are after, so that when you get them, you
will x'ealize you have them and will take time to
enjoy them, instead of tiring with them as soon as
you get them. If you don't, your enjoyment will come
only from the pursuit of the ends, not from the ends
themselves. And an enjoyment of the pursuit means
that you can never be satisfied, and without satisfac
tion there can never be happiness, for you will always
be looking for something else. It is this lack of satis
faction in the world that causes men like Hitler and
the raid on Pearl Harbor and war. Lack of satisfaction.
* * * *
A ND one other thing before I leave you. So that you
will be able to more easily achieve the ends you
are striving for, I suggest that you value the simple
and the inexpensive. Like the fresh air, like the trees,
like the water, like the simple and the inexpensive for
they are the best and the most beautiful and the most
lasting and the easiest to get and enjoy. Like music,
for radios are cheap. Like literature, for libraries are
always open and free. Like to play football and ten
nis and to swim and to climb trees, because these you
can do. Like to think for it costs you absolutely noth
ing. Like to watch animals, because they will charge
you nothing. L'ke to work, for though it won't pay
you much, it doesn't cost you anything. These ends
you can achieve very easily in your life. If you can
learn to like and enjoy and be satisfied with such
things, then you will have a better chance of being
happy.
Just one more thing. Be humble and don't be
afrait to ask questions about anything. Ask and try
to understand yourself and those around you. With
understanding the ugly looks nice, hate turns to love
and the evil in the world is diminished, even if only
slightly.
That's enough. I hope that the columns haven't
been too boring to you. I hope that there has been
one thing in all that I have said that each one of you
will remember. One thing that you will remember me
by. Now if you will excuse me, I would like to say
goodbye and go for a walk. Leaving you is hard,
especially since I have only nine toes to leave on.

you nothing. L'ke to work, for though it won't pay
you much, it doesn't cost you anything. These ends
you can achieve very easily in your life. If you can
learn to like and enjoy and be satisfied with such
things, then you will have a better chance of being
happy.
Just one more thing. Be humble and don't be
afrait to ask questions about anything. Ask and try
to understand yourself and those around you. With
understanding the ugly looks nice, hate turns to love
and the evil in the world is diminished, even if only
slightly.
That's enough. I hope that the columns haven't
been too boring to you. I hope that there has been
one thing in all that I have said that each one of you
will remember. One thing that you will remember me
by. Now if you will excuse me, I would like to say
goodbye and go for a walk. Leaving you is hard,
especially since I have only nine toes to leave on.
so the time Has come when I am through. The
time has come fast. It seems no more than a week
ago that I wrote my first column and lost the first
ten friends. The time has come and I am very sad,
even though the sun is shining and there is a brown
squirrel outside my window. I have enjoyed myself
all these months, writing this column. Even though I
had to rush to the shack every afternoon and type
instead of taking a nap, I have enjoyed this more
than anything else that I have ever done. I'm sorry
that it is over.
I hope that you will all get from this life all that
you want and all that you expect. I can only tell you
to try to decide what things you do want and expcct,
what things you would like to have. I ask you to try
to decide so that you will know what you are looking
for, so that you will know what you are going to
school for, sleeping and waking up for, struggling and
working for. Unless you know the things you want
and are able to recognize them when you have them,
you will never be satisfied and never happy. Know
what you are after, so that when you get them, you
will x'ealize you have them and will take time to
enjoy them, instead of tiring with them as soon as
you get them. If you don't, your enjoyment will come
only from the pursuit of the ends, not from the ends
themselves. And an enjoyment of the pursuit means
that you can never be satisfied, and without satisfac
tion there can never be happiness, for you will always
be looking for something else. It is this lack of satis
faction in the world that causes men like Hitler and
the raid on Pearl Harbor and war. Lack of satisfaction.
* * * *
A ND one other thing before I leave you. So that you
will be able to more easily achieve the ends you
are striving for, I suggest that you value the simple
and the inexpensive. Like the fresh air, like the trees,
like the water, like the simple and the inexpensive for
they are the best and the most beautiful and the most
lasting and the easiest to get and enjoy. Like music,
for radios are cheap. Like literature, for libraries are
always open and free. Like to play football and ten
nis and to swim and to climb trees, because these you
can do. Like to think for it costs you absolutely noth
ing. Like to watch animals, because they will charge
you nothing. L'ke to work, for though it won't pay
you much, it doesn't cost you anything. These ends
you can achieve very easily in your life. If you can
learn to like and enjoy and be satisfied with such
things, then you will have a better chance of being
