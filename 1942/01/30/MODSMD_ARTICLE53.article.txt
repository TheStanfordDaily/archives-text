# CAMPUS OPINION
## INDIAN IN BURMA 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
On January 28, it is alleged, certain Phi Delts
"planted" a conversation where it would be overheard
by an eager Daily reporter. The conversation con
cerned three Phi Delt "activity men" who were sup
posed to have accepted a job driving truck on the
Burma Road. The reporter hastened to the Daily
shack where his superiors, elated by the prospect of a
good feature, phoned the Phi Delt house for con
firmation. They found that the men in question were
in the city, so they left a message, asking them to call
immediately on their return. Some time later, people
called, purporting to be the men in question and con
sented to be interviewed. As a result of these alleged
activities and the phone interview, the first issue of
the new volume of The Daily was badly hoaxed. Its
workers had failed to observe the fundamental pre
caution vital to good journalism: "Get it first, but
get it right."
It is hoped that the editor will admit cheerfully
that he was taken when off "guard, drop the vindic
tive charges against the Phi Delts supposed to have
perpetrated the hoax, and instead devote his own and
the staff's energies to putting out the best Daily yet
seen. With vigilance and hard work The Daily can
regain nationwide recognition as well as the respect
of its owners.
The Phi Delts, if they did the job, and others who
feel the urge to raise a bit of occasional mischief,
will do well to consider wisely the effect. Stanford is
in the midst of trying times. It is expanding from a
small school run largely by personal contact to a
larger, impersonal machine. The machinery of admin
istration is now tentatively working out routine for
handling problems of a disciplinary nature. By conve
nience, as well as a quite natural organizing talent on
the part of administrative officials, the system will
gravitate toward a paternalistic official control of all
matters of student government, discipline, and social
life. If we are to preserve any shreds of student
administration from the double threat of the war situ
ation and the changing administrative set-up, it will
be highly necessary to show that we are capable of
handling our own affairs without constant super
vision. Adolesccnt practical jokes, however enjoyable,
will not contribute to a feeling of confidence on the
part of the faculty and administration.

(Editor's Note: Thank you, Pawnee, for your
constructive criticism. We point out that the Phi
Delts did not "plant" a conversation, they phoned
The Daily and dropped the hint, then, when The
Daily called hack, the person answering the phone
boldly and without conscience claimed to he one
of the three men "going to the Burma Road." and
proceeded to impersonate that person and give
out the interview. He knew lie was speaking for
publication, speaking in the shoes of another man.
We are not accustomed to being deceived in tele
phone interviews.
The story was not printed in the lirst issue of
the new volume of The Dailyâ€”first issue will he
Monday. Feb. 2. StalT changes were merely an
nounced Wednesday, the day the Burma Road
story appeared. The volume officially changes after
the publication of this morning's paper.
The Daily does not wish to cause ill feeling by
"pressing the charges," hut will merely sit tiijlit
and await the outcome of Men's Council's in
vestigation.)
