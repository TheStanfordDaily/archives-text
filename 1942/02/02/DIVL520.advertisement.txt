A FOOTSORE FABLE
Once upon a time there was a man who was lost. He wandered around
for days, trying to find his way home. He would walk five miles down
one road, until he discovered that it didn't lead to where he 'wanted to
go, and then he would walk down another road. He was very unhappy,
and his feet hurt.
After a long time he met another man, and asked for directions.
The second man looked at him and said, "Isn't that a map sticking out
of your pocket?"
"Yes," said the man who was lost.
"Then why don't you look at the map, and find out which road you
should take?"
"My goodness!" said the lost man, "I never thought of that!"
