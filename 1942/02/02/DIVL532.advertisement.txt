Dear Student:
How about saving yourself some trouble?
Have you had anxious letters from home asking
what the war is doing to Stanford and what Stan
ford is doing to the war?
Covering all the angles of Stanford life in
writing to your family is an exhaustive task; but
your mother and father are going to demand
more and more news on the actual danger of air
raids on the university and what is being done
to insure your safety, more and more news oil
what the attitude toward war is among young
people and professors.
Why not let The Stanford Daily tell them in
its organized and digested form? Five days a
week your family will know just what is happen
ing here. There is no better way to show the
people back home that Stanford is on the alert,
doing her part and more on the very brim of the
vital Pacific front.
Sincerely,
The Stanford Daily
