# Debaters Face Full Program
## 
### 
Farm forensic activity hits its peak
for the winter quarter this week as
speakers from both freshman and
varsity squads face competition on
many fronts.
Speakers from both teams will
enter the second round of compe
tition in Delta Sigma Rho's All-
University debate tournament to
night. The debaters are discussing
the topic, "Resolved: That after the
war a federation of nations should
be formed to establish the Atlantic
Charter."
Also open to all Stanford speakers
is the $1,000 American Economic
Foundation speaking contest. The
topic for discussion is "Resolved:
That the youth of today has a fair
chance under the American system
of competitive enterprise." Anyone
wishing to enter the contest should
hand a brief of his case to Dr. N. B.
Beck, varsity debate coach, within
the next two weeks.
Also nearing is the February 19
scrap between representatives of
Encina and Roble on the "dutch
date" question which is drawing
wide interest among the Farm frosh.
Sylvia Berry and Ralph Thompson
will announce the names of their
respective teams this week.
