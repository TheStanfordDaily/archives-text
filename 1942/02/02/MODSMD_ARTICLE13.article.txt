# Volume 101 Annonces Daily Policy Changes
## 
### 
Beginning with this morning's eight-column front page news play,
Volume 101 of The Stanford Daily in its first issue announces sev
eral changes and added features.
They are designed to afford readers better coverage of every single
angle of the warâ€”international, national, and local.
They arc:
1. More United Press direct wire stories, reporting more com
pletely news from every warfront.
2. A new column listing Stanford men in the Services, for which
everyone is encouraged to contribute information by calling The
Daily, P.A. 22166. This column will comply with censorship re
strictions.
3. More intramural sports news, covering every intramural game.
4. More exhaustive local news coverage, complete with pictures.
5. Coverage of news of other campuses of interest.
6. Shorter, easier-to-read editorials.
7. Papers delivered on campus will henceforth be wrapped in
wax on rainy mornings, effective as soon as the paper is available.
History, 1942, formerly in column 1, page 1, will be found in
column 2, page. 4.
