# Women to Hear Aviatrix Speak
## 
### 
A via tier, a pioneer field for
women, will be presented at the
Women's Vocom meeting in the
Nitery, Wednesday evening at 7:10.
Miss Mary Tornich, woman instruc
tor in the Army Air Corps at King
City, will give an overview of the
active flying field stressing the wom
an's chances aganist the increasing
number of men in aviation.
The world situation has made po
sitions available for women and cre
ated opportunities which representa
tives from the air lines will dis
cuss. The non-technical positions
with the air lines such as dispatch
work, publicity, selling, and public
relations jobs will be the main points
of their talks.
Because women do not realize the
opportunities offered in this field,
Vocom, headed by Jeane Cambers,
chose aviation as the special feature
of the quarter. Although a minority
of Farm women expressed a desire
to hear the subject discussed in the
Vocational interest survey taken last
quarter, the majority of women will
find this of interest.
Informal discussion during which
the speakers will answer individual
questions will follow the formal
meeting. Refreshments will be
served.
