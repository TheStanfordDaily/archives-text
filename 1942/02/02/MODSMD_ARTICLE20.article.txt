## EARTH SHOCKS FELT 
### 
MOSCOW, Mon., Feb. 2 (UP). —Russian troops are running rough
shod over numerous "nests of enemy resistance" on both the Leningrad
and central fronts, and guerillas have invaded Kharkov and blown up the
68th German Division headquarters, killing the commanding general and
most other staff officers, according to a communique issued early today.

. An estimated 1,700 Germans were
killed or captured and at least 70
German strong points were destroyed
in two days of fighting around Len
ingrad, the communique said.
The third infantry battalion of the
German Fourth SS (Elite Guard)
Regiment was reported annihilated
on the central front.
Two more German battalions (an
estimated 1,000 men) were said to
have been dispersed and partially
destroyed by Russian planes, which
also shot down seven German
planes Saturday at a loss of only
two of their own.
Vast quantities of guns, ammuni
tion, vehicles and railway stock were
reported captured in the sweeping
Red Army advance through the
snows. At the town of Sukninichi, a
rail junction 150 miles southwest of
Moscow, between Kaluga and Kirov,
20 engines and 499 rail trucks loaded
with military equipment were listed
as among the material seized.
This communique closely fol
lowed reports of the capture of 60

desperately struggling Germans
back into their second and third de
fensive lines.
