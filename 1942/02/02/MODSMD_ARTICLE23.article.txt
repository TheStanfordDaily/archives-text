# 'Marco Millions' Players Work Behind Masks, Wigs
## 
### 
"Masks, wigs, beards, and still more masks, wigs, and beards," mourns
the make-up crew for "Marco Millions,' 'to be presented Feb. 5, 6, and 7,
in Memorial Theater. And well they might mourn for everywhere back
stage, as the production swings into its final rehearsals, is a litter of false

hair and papier-mache.
Besides being responsible for dec
orating the faces of the cast, the
members of Helen Green's advanced
costume and make-up classes have
been working for many weeks on
the exotic head-dresses to be worn
by the various people in the show.
Over 300 of these had to be made,
and some are still in the process of
completion. Ostrich plumes, .fur,
maribou, crystal beads, spangles,
pearls, and various elaborate mate
rials are being made into some of
the most fantastic and colorful
headgear seen in any Stanford pro
duction.
A great deal of research has gone,
into the creation of the make-up for
the show, and the "masks, wigs, and
beards" are guaranteed to be as
authentic as the costumes and head
dresses.
The make-up crew consists of
Mavis Moore, Elena Madison, Eliza
beth Wattenberger, Mary Lou Lins
ley, and Lisle Selby.


ELLEN WYLIE, who plays the
granddaughter/of Kubla Khan in
"Marco Millions," is shown here
in her court head-dress.
