# Attack Islands Action
## Admiral Nimitz Strikes Gilbert, Marshall Islands 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UP).
United States Navy air and sea
forces have carried out a heavy at
tack on Japanese bases in the Mar
shall and Gilbert Islands, destroy
ing "many" enemy ships and planes
and shelling shore installations, the
Navy announced tonight.
The raid, carried out by a major
attack force including torpedo-car
rying planes, at least one aircraft
carrier, cruisers and destroyers and
presumably one or more battleships,
was the United States' answer to the
Dec. 7 sneak attack on Pearl Har
bor, and was another indication of
the United Nations' expanding air
and sea power in the Pacific theater.
HEAVY JAP LOSSES
Against the Japanese losses, U.S.
casualties "are believed to have
been slight," the communique said.
Today's announcement was the
first to disclose specific action by
the Pacific fleet. Surface units un
der Admiral Thomas Hart, chief of
the U.S. Asiatic fleet, previously had
been reported in action, notably in
Macassar Strait.
The United States forces, under
Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, struck
2,000 miles from their Pearl Harbor
base and caught the Japanese by
surprise under a rain of bombs, tor
pedoes and heavy shellfire from fleet
units.
CLEAR SHIP LANES
The Marshalls are part of the
Japanese-mandated area in the mid-
Pacific. The raid apparently was
part of a broad plan to keep ship
ping lanes to Australia and the Neth
erlands East Indies free of Jap air
and sea attack.
Admiral Nimitz reported that
while no large enemy combatant
vessels were found, "many enemy
fleet auxiliaries were sunk, beached
or otherwise damaged extensively,"
the communique said.
That the Japanese struck back
savagely also was seen in the com
munique which said two U.S. sur
face ships were damaged slightly by
near bomb misses and 11 U.S. air
craft "failed to return from the
attack."
