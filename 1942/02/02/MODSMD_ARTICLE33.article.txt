# 'Last Auto Gets a Date For Andrew
## 
### BILL STEIF 
This is a serious article. It is» se
rious because it concerns everyone
who drives a car. If you don't know
how to drive don't read this, but if
you know how to drive you had
better go on.
You see, the way people are driv
ing now only Andrew will have a
car left in 1945. Andrew entered
Stanford in the fall of 1941. He was
from. Farina Gorge, Montana, and
his father owned half the town.
Therefore he brought an automo
bile to Stanford. That didn't mean
very much in the fall of 1941. Every
body on the Stanford campus seem
ed to be running around in jaunty
convertibles. Everybody raced
around and kept Gordy Davis busy
and Men's Council was perpetually
saying, "One buck, please, and pay
at the Ad Building." War and all
that it means seemed to be a long
way off..
THEN CAME THE WAR
And then the war came. The gov
ernment said that Stanford people
and all other people with cars could
not get any more tires and wOuld,
a fact, have a hard time getting any
thing more to keep cars in Winning
condition. Of course, there were no
more automobiles to buy. Every
body said that was right. "We have
to win the war," they said. But
people at Stanford still kept racing
around in their long, pretty cars.
Except Andrew.
Andrew read a newspaper some
where which had published some
stuff that the California State Auto
mobile Association had sent to the
newspaper. These were (and this is
particularly serious) "Wartime Hints
on Care of the Car."
ANDREW READS HINTS
One "hint" was that everyone that
owns a car should write down the
serial numbers of his or her car's
tires and lock them (the serial num
bers) up in a safe place until his or
her car's tires were stolen. This
newspaper furthermore said some
thing about not leaving automobiles
in dark or isolated places where
thieves have a chance at "stripping
your wheels without detection."
Another hint stated that "severe use
of brake causes rapid wear." Two
more hints said that "care is re
quired when cleaning spark plugs"
and "drain on battery should be
avoided."
Andrew, who was apparently the
only one to read this newspaper,
observed all these "hints."
FRIENDS INCREASE
Pretty soon Andrew found that
he had more and more friends. He
discovered that he could get an oc
casional date with a Kappa he had
once met on a train coming from
Farina Gorge. He was even invited
to a Roble Formal.
And conversely, pretty soon, all
the Stanford people with handsome
green or yellow or purple cars
found that parking in some dark or
isolated place their tires had disap
peared, or their brakes no longer
worked, or they had been looking
across the way while cleaning their
spark plugs and so had irreparably
damaged them. And so all these
cars just no longer ran and the poor
out-in-the-cold guys that didn't
have cars anyway found that they
could once again get a date.
ANDREW MADE PREXY
And in 1945 Andrew was elected
student body president. Everybody
just naturally hopped onto his band
wagon. And as Gordy Davis was
walking down the street one day in
1945 an automobile whizzed by and
a thumb at a nose waggled at him.
So, as you can see, this story has
a moral—and is very serious.
