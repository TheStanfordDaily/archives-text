# Blimp Flies Over Farm ---lt's Here To Stay
## 
### AL HAMPSON 
The first of the Naval patrol blimps which are scheduled to operate
from Moffett Field soared slowly and serenely over Stanford and nuzzled
the Hoover Libe yesterday on its way home.
It is possible that such blimps will become a common sight at Stanford
since Moffett Field, base of the San Francisco Bay Area's first Airship

Patrol Squadron, was
Saturday at 11 a.m., just 11 days
after the arrival of the ships in a
special train shipment.
Moffett Field is one of the four
lighter - than - air bases already
scheduled with others proposed. Six
blimps are already operating with
the Atlantic Fleet and by the end of
1942 it is anticipated that the entire
Pacific Coast will be under airship
patrol as an aid to bombing planes
and destroyers.
Yes, blimp T-24 is here to stay; to
nuzzle the Hoover Libe, to fasci
nate Stanford, and to spot subma
rines.

National League scoring record of
900 goals for 168-game schedule will
be eclipsed this season if hockey
players continue their present clip.
