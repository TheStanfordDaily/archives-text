COME quick calculations after Saturday, night's basketball game lead
to the statement that Jim Pollard is leading the southern division
conference scoring with 43 points in three games. He is an even 10 points
ahead of Ed Voss and Trojan Bob Ormsby, who have 33 points in the
same number of contests. One point farther down the scale at 32 was
Marv Lee, U.C.L.A. center who, after scoring 18 against U.S.C. in one
game, was held to 14 by Everett Dean's men in two games. Howie Dall
mar and Don Burness follow up with 30 and 27 to give Stanford four of
the six top scorers.
It took Jim two "hot" nights to pile up his 14-point average, Voss and
Dallmar one "hot" night apiece for their 11 and 10-point averages, and
Burness, with a 9-point average, has yet to really get his eye.

SHOT chart was kept Saturday evening by a guy wearing a yellow
tie. He turned his masterpiece over to this column for publication.
According to the aforementioned observer Stanford took 88 clean
shots during the course of the game to the Bruins' 52. lie counted
tip-ins when the tipper-inner had a good chance at the ball, but he
did not count every time a player touched the ball in the jumping up
and down under the basket. Of these 88 tries, the Indians made good
on 21 of them, while the opposition could sink 10 field goals oift of
their 52 attempts.
A quick look at the chart will show that the Uclans scored eight of
their 10 goals from outside the radius of the keyhole. Also they only had
six close-in shots all night, since they could not solve the Card defense
and could not get the ball off the backboard. Conversely, 15 of the Farm's
21 buckets emanated from the floor directly under the basket.
Had not the Bruins had several men who could plop the ball through
the hoop from 30 feet out, they would have been lucky to score 10
points against the long, speedy, and intelligent Indians. And remember
that this is the best Bruin team in five years.

17 VERY time I walk into the Cellar to look at the magazines and buy
, some Black Jack, I see, shining up.from the case that used to hold
the Axe, a little silverware and a few old footballs.
This set me to thinking the other afternoon whether it is better to
stuff that case so full that the students won't miss the Axe, or is it
better to leave the case so noticeably empty that next fall every able
bodied male still in school will turn out for football in order to get
the Axe back. I might be able to stir myself up into making a
crusade out of this.
Naturally every sports editor has his crusade on which he harps occa
sionally. Not only does it fill space on dready winter days, but it gives
the writer a certain satisfaction to know that he is pushing his ideas off
on unsuspecting readers, if there are any. But let's not be modest. I
know there are several people who read this column because I promised
to start giving hot tips on Hialeah races. I'll let you know in a day or so
if I find any good second-hand crusades.
