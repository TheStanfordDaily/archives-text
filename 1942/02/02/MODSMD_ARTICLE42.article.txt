# Schroeder, Hutchison Upset As Neale, Roberts Win Tennis
## 
### 
Stanford's seven best tennis doubles teams met in a round-robin
tourney Saturday afternoon in order to give Coach Johnny Lamb a basis
for rating them for the coming season.
Although the first seeded team of Ted Schroeder and Chuck Hutchi
son finished the afternoon in second place behind the newly formed team

of Emery Neale and Andy Roberts,
it is probable that the former will
keep their ranking since they were
not at the top of their game Sat
urday.
Seeded second and finishing third
was the former National Intercol
legiate doubles team of Larry Dee
and Jimmy Wade. The two veterans
split their eight games with the
Neale-Roberts team, but were de
feated 5-3 by Schroeder and Hutch
ison.
KRUEGER, THOMAS
Surprise team of the matches was
the eighth ranked duo of Tom Krue
ger and Dick Thomas. This varsity
freshman team scored 25 points,
which put them behind the Neale-
Roberts winning total of 33 points,
but which rates them ahead of the
higher seeded teams of Paul Wilson
and Ben Olson, Chuck Hopper and
Harper Ink, and Bob Rutledge and
Bob Forbes.
Wilson and Olson, transfers from
Ventura Jaysee and 'Menlo Jaysee,
respectively, were put in fourth
place by Lamb. They justified his
judgment by defeating the three
teams under them.
HOPPER, INK FIFTH
Hopper and Ink, fifth seeded team,
have played together intermittently
for the last four years and have
that advantage over several of the
other teams. They scored 22 points
to give them fifth place.
Rutledge and Forbes made up the
only all-frosh team in the tourney
and will probably be the number
one Papoose doubles team this
spring. They had trouble scoring
against their varsity rivals, but did
manage to take three games from
Dee and Wade.

place by Lamb. They justified his
judgment by defeating the three
teams under them.
HOPPER, INK FIFTH
Hopper and Ink, fifth seeded team,
have played together intermittently
for the last four years and have
that advantage over several of the
other teams. They scored 22 points
to give them fifth place.
Rutledge and Forbes made up the
only all-frosh team in the tourney
and will probably be the number
one Papoose doubles team this
spring. They had trouble scoring
against their varsity rivals, but did
manage to take three games from
Dee and Wade.
