# Upstart Paly Quintet Downs Frosh, 34-22
## 
### 
That old story of how one shouldn't
play with the boys from the other
side of the tracks because they are
bigger and rougher has some basis.
The upstart lads from Palo Alto
High, already firmly lodged in the
number one spot of Peninsula high
school hoop standings, rode to their
fifth straight win over a cold Stan
ford freshman team, 34 to 22, Satur
day night.
FROSH AVERE COLD
The Stanfords were really cold.
Already this season they had played
the tall lads from the local high but
they certainly hadn't looked for an
exhibition of dead-eye flipping such
as Norm Kohler and Company
showed Friday. The locals, not very
fresh from an easily won (34-26)
but tiring battle with George Wash
ington High the night before, had
more than their share of poor breaks.
Facing a team that was steaming, in
general they looked "not good," to
quote a member.
So let's skip the gory details.
SECOND LOSS
It was Stanford's second loss in
seven starts. They have topped
Piedmont, San Jose High, Menlo
J.C., Galileo, and George Washing
ton, dropping tilts to Santa Clara's
frosh and the Paloaltans.
California's freshmen soundly
sank the Lowell High team of San
Francisco 38 to 28 over the week
end. Which fact should be of ab
solutely no interest to you unless
you know that this Friday the same
Lowell High quint meets the Bengt
son men. The tilt will be the best
indication thus far available of how
the Berkeley baby quint and the
young Farm men will shape up when

they meet in a Valentine's Eve fray,
February 13.
On February 7 the Card frosh play
Monterey High to round out the
coming week-end. The rest of the
schedule calls for the Cal game on
February 13, Poly High of San Fran
cisco on the next night, February 14,
Salinas J.C. on February 21, and a
double-header with the Cal frosh
on March 6 and 7. The first Cal tilt
will be at Berkeley, the second at
Stanford, and the last at Berkeley.
The week-end of February 13 and
14 will be the toughest spot on the
yearling schedule, with the Cal ri
valry taking everything the frosh
have on Friday, and Poly High, San
Francisco's toughest high school
hoop team, meeting what's left the
next night.

February 13, Poly High of San Fran
cisco on the next night, February 14,
Salinas J.C. on February 21, and a
double-header with the Cal frosh
on March 6 and 7. The first Cal tilt
will be at Berkeley, the second at
Stanford, and the last at Berkeley.
The week-end of February 13 and
14 will be the toughest spot on the
yearling schedule, with the Cal ri
valry taking everything the frosh
have on Friday, and Poly High, San
Francisco's toughest high school
hoop team, meeting what's left the
next night.
That old story of how one shouldn't
play with the boys from the other
side of the tracks because they are
bigger and rougher has some basis.
The upstart lads from Palo Alto
High, already firmly lodged in the
number one spot of Peninsula high
school hoop standings, rode to their
fifth straight win over a cold Stan
ford freshman team, 34 to 22, Satur
day night.
FROSH AVERE COLD
The Stanfords were really cold.
Already this season they had played
the tall lads from the local high but
they certainly hadn't looked for an
exhibition of dead-eye flipping such
as Norm Kohler and Company
showed Friday. The locals, not very
fresh from an easily won (34-26)
but tiring battle with George Wash
ington High the night before, had
more than their share of poor breaks.
Facing a team that was steaming, in
general they looked "not good," to
quote a member.
So let's skip the gory details.
SECOND LOSS
It was Stanford's second loss in
seven starts. They have topped
Piedmont, San Jose High, Menlo
J.C., Galileo, and George Washing
ton, dropping tilts to Santa Clara's
frosh and the Paloaltans.
California's freshmen soundly
sank the Lowell High team of San
Francisco 38 to 28 over the week
end. Which fact should be of ab
solutely no interest to you unless
you know that this Friday the same
Lowell High quint meets the Bengt
son men. The tilt will be the best
indication thus far available of how
the Berkeley baby quint and the
young Farm men will shape up when

they meet in a Valentine's Eve fray,
February 13.
On February 7 the Card frosh play
Monterey High to round out the
coming week-end. The rest of the
schedule calls for the Cal game on
February 13, Poly High of San Fran
cisco on the next night, February 14,
Salinas J.C. on February 21, and a
