NEW YORK, Feb. 2 (UP).—Some
athletes were born at the wrong time
and Cornelius Warmerdam of the
Olympic Club, San Francisco, seems
to be one of them. The war wiped
out the Olympic Games in 1940 and
there's no telling when they will be
held again, if ever.
But if the world wasn't aflame
with war, Warmerdam probably
would go down as one' of the most
remarkable athletes of all time.
ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 1 (UP).—
Wayne Sabin made his pro debut a
success today, winning the $l,OOO
Orlando professional tennis tourna
ment, a 4-6, 6-3, 8-6, 6-2 victory
over Keith Gledhill of Glendale.
