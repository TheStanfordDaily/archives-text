# Farm Cagers Topple UCLA; Hold Southern Division Lead
## 
### 
One hundred and three points in two games, that's how the Redskins
twice toppled U.C.L.A., 54-43, 49-30, to hold undisputed possession of the
Southern Division lead over U.S.C. by .334 percentage points. Howie Dall
mar stacked up 20 points Friday and Jimmy Pollard scored 17 Saturday
to highlight the week-end's scoring activities.

It's happened twice now,
business of having one man on Ev
erett Dean's club go hog wild and
take the scoring cake each night.
Friday Dallmar rang the bell with
four field goals in the first half and

a like number in the second, along
with four points from the free
throw line for a total of 20.
Saturday Pollard was good for
seven fields goals and three charity
tosses for a 17-point total.
Against U.S.C., if the same holds
true, either Don Burness, Bill Cow
den, or Eddie Voss should suddenly
have his "on" night. In Deans' of
fensive style every player takes
about the same number of shots,
and since any one of the five is
capable of tallying in the neighbor
hood of 20 points, it's not just a
"coincidence that the two U.C.L.A.
games went in like manner. â– 
This very fact makes it difficult
fbr any opponent to find an ade
quate defense for stopping the Red
men. Coach Wilbur Johns sent out
a strict man-to-man set-up which
held to the Indians to a 25-16 half
time lead Friday and 25-14 Satur
day.
