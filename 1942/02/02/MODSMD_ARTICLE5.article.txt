# Business Classes To Be Expanded
## 
### 
Plans for expansion of the ex
perimental courses in typing and
shorthand for undergraduates, be
gun by the Graduate School of Busi
ness this quarter as a war-time
training measure, were announced
today by Dean J. Hugh Jackson.
New classes in each subject will
start both spring and summer quar
ters, Dean Jackson said. Those
classes now in progress will con
tinue for another quarter. Enroll
ments are limited to undergraduates
who have not had any previous in
struction. The aim of the course is
to attain a speed rating of 60 words
a minute after two quarters of
training.
Dean Jackson said that there is a
nationwide shortage of stenogra
phers, and students so trained be
fore they leave college are expected
to be of immediate use in the war
emergency after graduation, regard
less what field of work they enter.
