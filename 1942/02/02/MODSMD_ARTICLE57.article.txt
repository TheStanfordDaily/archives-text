# Dear Chas:
## 
### 
THE staff and I realize how tough it is to say
good-bye to their old boss—the one they
love, and proved their love by working for him
so well that he put out the most professional
Daily the campus can hope to see in a long time.
More than that, it was guided by an editor who
was at once gracious, kind and farsighted.
We've all worked so long and so hard to
gether, and so closely, it's difficult to believe
Volume 100 is over and that we are trying to
put out a Daily without you here to do the
job right, just as you've always done. And
it's tough to get along without Romie and Bud,
for with you they made The Daily what it has
been for three and a half years.
You left a big order in your farewell edi
torial, but you also left a well-trained staff of
newspaper men and women to do the job. It
is these people on the rim of the copy desk and
on the beats who will fill your order.
Your sense of balance and unrivaled mature
judgment led you to fight the anarchists who
would thumb their noses at tradition, and it
led you to sound the call for on-campus social
life. The need was obvious to you—the success
ful part you played in the endeavor to accom
plish this policy was proved by the success of
Lagunita's open house Saturday night.
The Daily under your leadership has taken
the trouble to point out to numerous members
of the campus who have written in Campus
Opinion their disappointment in being asked to
spend less money and to do less driving; to
forget the necessity of hiring big name bands
and to plan more functions in which everyone
can participate here on the campus.
This perhaps has been your biggest effort,
and while everyone realizes there are two sides
to every story, your stand on the subject is
justified under a most important heading right
now, and that is patriotism. This was also the
policy of Stanford's student leaders, the Execu
tive Committee, and if any student were to
have the opportunity of talking with President
Wilbur on the necessity for walking with real
ity today, he would lose any ideas he might
have about using his tires, his time and his
money to go to the city for a fling every week
end.
It was your early realization of the facts, and
your determined presentation of them to a pre
viously skeptical campus, that helped form my
decision on the matter. I heartily endorse your
policy, and will carry it on.
You conceived the improved election system,
that of telescoping it to a three-day procedure.
This plan in itself will do much toward rifling
the evil caucus.
The Daily was hoaxed recently and you called
it when you labeled these people "adolescent
pranksters." The beautiful way you handled
that editorial proves who came out on top.
It would be nothing but trite to mention what
war means to all of us at Stanford. We hope
you can be proud of our presentation of war
news, and we will remember the peace which
is to follow. We will present information from
time to time on the possibilities for peace, and
out the need for a just one, as you have
done.
There are many considerations which you
have pointed out to us, and they include cen
sorship restrictions, to which we shall adhere
rigidly, the need for a mention of different
Stanford men who are helping fight the war,
and, as stated above, we will follow your sug
gestion to keep America thinking about peace.
Thank you, Charlie, for everything. This edi
torial would not be complete without thanking
you for your invaluable sense of humor that
kept us all in good spirits, and for that infec
tious laugh. We'll never forget it. And the best
of luck to you as the new editor of the campus
literary magazine, the Carillon. You just can't
keep a good man out of mischief.
Whenever you get a chance to leave the
Carillon for an evening's bull session, remem
ber we're always looking for you at the Shack.
The next time we work together, it will be
for Uncle Sam, and I'm glad it won't be long
until we are working together again.
Charlie, no matter how the titles read, you'll
always be the "boss" to me.

pranksters." The beautiful way you handled
that editorial proves who came out on top.
It would be nothing but trite to mention what
war means to all of us at Stanford. We hope
you can be proud of our presentation of war
news, and we will remember the peace which
is to follow. We will present information from
time to time on the possibilities for peace, and
out the need for a just one, as you have
done.
There are many considerations which you
have pointed out to us, and they include cen
sorship restrictions, to which we shall adhere
rigidly, the need for a mention of different
Stanford men who are helping fight the war,
and, as stated above, we will follow your sug
gestion to keep America thinking about peace.
Thank you, Charlie, for everything. This edi
torial would not be complete without thanking
you for your invaluable sense of humor that
kept us all in good spirits, and for that infec
tious laugh. We'll never forget it. And the best
of luck to you as the new editor of the campus
literary magazine, the Carillon. You just can't
keep a good man out of mischief.
Whenever you get a chance to leave the
Carillon for an evening's bull session, remem
ber we're always looking for you at the Shack.
The next time we work together, it will be
for Uncle Sam, and I'm glad it won't be long
until we are working together again.
Charlie, no matter how the titles read, you'll
always be the "boss" to me.

THE staff and I realize how tough it is to say
good-bye to their old boss—the one they
love, and proved their love by working for him
so well that he put out the most professional
Daily the campus can hope to see in a long time.
More than that, it was guided by an editor who
was at once gracious, kind and farsighted.
We've all worked so long and so hard to
gether, and so closely, it's difficult to believe
Volume 100 is over and that we are trying to
put out a Daily without you here to do the
job right, just as you've always done. And
it's tough to get along without Romie and Bud,
for with you they made The Daily what it has
been for three and a half years.
You left a big order in your farewell edi
torial, but you also left a well-trained staff of
newspaper men and women to do the job. It
is these people on the rim of the copy desk and
on the beats who will fill your order.
Your sense of balance and unrivaled mature
judgment led you to fight the anarchists who
would thumb their noses at tradition, and it
led you to sound the call for on-campus social
life. The need was obvious to you—the success
ful part you played in the endeavor to accom
plish this policy was proved by the success of
Lagunita's open house Saturday night.
The Daily under your leadership has taken
the trouble to point out to numerous members
of the campus who have written in Campus
Opinion their disappointment in being asked to
spend less money and to do less driving; to
forget the necessity of hiring big name bands
and to plan more functions in which everyone
can participate here on the campus.
This perhaps has been your biggest effort,
and while everyone realizes there are two sides
to every story, your stand on the subject is
justified under a most important heading right
now, and that is patriotism. This was also the
policy of Stanford's student leaders, the Execu
tive Committee, and if any student were to
have the opportunity of talking with President
Wilbur on the necessity for walking with real
ity today, he would lose any ideas he might
have about using his tires, his time and his
money to go to the city for a fling every week
end.
It was your early realization of the facts, and
your determined presentation of them to a pre
viously skeptical campus, that helped form my
decision on the matter. I heartily endorse your
policy, and will carry it on.
You conceived the improved election system,
that of telescoping it to a three-day procedure.
This plan in itself will do much toward rifling
the evil caucus.

led you to sound the call for on-campus social
life. The need was obvious to you—the success
ful part you played in the endeavor to accom
plish this policy was proved by the success of
Lagunita's open house Saturday night.
The Daily under your leadership has taken
the trouble to point out to numerous members
of the campus who have written in Campus
Opinion their disappointment in being asked to
spend less money and to do less driving; to
forget the necessity of hiring big name bands
and to plan more functions in which everyone
can participate here on the campus.
This perhaps has been your biggest effort,
and while everyone realizes there are two sides
to every story, your stand on the subject is
justified under a most important heading right
now, and that is patriotism. This was also the
policy of Stanford's student leaders, the Execu
tive Committee, and if any student were to
have the opportunity of talking with President
Wilbur on the necessity for walking with real
ity today, he would lose any ideas he might
have about using his tires, his time and his
money to go to the city for a fling every week
end.
It was your early realization of the facts, and
your determined presentation of them to a pre
viously skeptical campus, that helped form my
decision on the matter. I heartily endorse your
policy, and will carry it on.
You conceived the improved election system,
that of telescoping it to a three-day procedure.
This plan in itself will do much toward rifling
the evil caucus.
The Daily was hoaxed recently and you called
it when you labeled these people "adolescent
pranksters." The beautiful way you handled
that editorial proves who came out on top.
It would be nothing but trite to mention what
war means to all of us at Stanford. We hope
you can be proud of our presentation of war
news, and we will remember the peace which
is to follow. We will present information from
time to time on the possibilities for peace, and
out the need for a just one, as you have
done.
There are many considerations which you
have pointed out to us, and they include cen
sorship restrictions, to which we shall adhere
rigidly, the need for a mention of different
Stanford men who are helping fight the war,
and, as stated above, we will follow your sug
gestion to keep America thinking about peace.
Thank you, Charlie, for everything. This edi
torial would not be complete without thanking
you for your invaluable sense of humor that
kept us all in good spirits, and for that infec
tious laugh. We'll never forget it. And the best
of luck to you as the new editor of the campus
literary magazine, the Carillon. You just can't
keep a good man out of mischief.
Whenever you get a chance to leave the
Carillon for an evening's bull session, remem
ber we're always looking for you at the Shack.
The next time we work together, it will be
for Uncle Sam, and I'm glad it won't be long
until we are working together again.
Charlie, no matter how the titles read, you'll
always be the "boss" to me.

THE staff and I realize how tough it is to say
good-bye to their old boss—the one they
love, and proved their love by working for him
so well that he put out the most professional
Daily the campus can hope to see in a long time.
More than that, it was guided by an editor who
was at once gracious, kind and farsighted.
We've all worked so long and so hard to
gether, and so closely, it's difficult to believe
Volume 100 is over and that we are trying to
put out a Daily without you here to do the
job right, just as you've always done. And
it's tough to get along without Romie and Bud,
for with you they made The Daily what it has
been for three and a half years.
You left a big order in your farewell edi
torial, but you also left a well-trained staff of
newspaper men and women to do the job. It
is these people on the rim of the copy desk and
on the beats who will fill your order.
Your sense of balance and unrivaled mature
judgment led you to fight the anarchists who
would thumb their noses at tradition, and it
led you to sound the call for on-campus social
life. The need was obvious to you—the success
