## How It Is with Singapore As Japanese Open Seige 
### AMIE REICHERT 
THHE chips are down in the battle for Singapore.
The great Allied naval fortress of the Far East has
been officially under seige for about 48 hours now
since the British forces, exhausted from the torturous
eight-week battle for the Malayan Peninsula, re
treated out of the swampy jungle, across the Johore
causeway and into the island fortress.
The retreat, through the 350 miles of ponderous
rubber groves, entangling shrubbery, and marshland
that make the Malayan jungle, was the culmination of
a desperate attempt by the Imperial forces to hold
the invading Japanese at arm's length.
Under an umbrella protection of the R.A.F.,
the British fell back across the Johore causeway
which bridges the mile and a half Johore strait that
separates the island fortress from the peninsula.
When the British had safely passed over, they
touched off the mines which had previously been
laid under the causeway and blasted it to the sky.
Whether they were successful in completely de
molishing the structure has not been ascertained yet.
An unconfirmed broadcast from Berlin last night
stated that Tokyo reported Japanese troops were ad
vancing over the causeway, that it had not been de
stroyed.
* St * *
TVTEANWHILE the big guns which ring Singapore
hurled shells and high explosives at the oncom
ing Japs, fought off air raids, and prepared to with
stand a long seige.
How long this siege will last is one of the crucial
determining factors in the battle for the Far East. The
small (27 miles long and 14 miles wide) island faces
onslaught today just as Hong Kong did a month ago,
and among its gravest problems is the one that was
the death of Hong Kong—water.
The British may not be blasted out of Singa
pore, they may be thirsted out and starved out.
The water supplies of the island are stored in a
number of reservoirs—just as they were at Hong
Kong—which, if they fell into Japanese hands,
would prove the sure end of British resistance.
Yesterday, the Japanese dispatches stated that the
British destroyed Singapore's main 14-inch water
supply line in their scorched-earth retreat.
The story is not confirmed by the British, however,
and is very likely untrue.

SINGAPORE'S main strategic weakness in the pres
ent attack is that her defenses have always been
planned for an assault from the sea. She has a vast
ring of huge guns, pointing to the east, west, and
south—all facing the sea. The Japanese attack comes
from the north, by land. However, it is safe to as
sume that the British have been preparing for this
land assault at least for the past eight weeks, so that
they have inevitably installed land defences of some
sort.

CIZING up the situation it comes to about this:
The British have on their side the advantages of
a consolidated position, the mile-wide water barrier
of the strait of Johore which has been thickly mined
and is swept by camouflaged artillery and concrete
machinegun pill boxes, and the arms of the fortress
itself.
As liabilities they have a population of 700,000
that must be fed and watered with reserve stores
(Singapore normally imports almost all of her food
supplies), not to mention the fact that there are no
adequate air raid shelters on the island.
The Japanese have in their favor superiority in
manpower and air power, the fact that Singapore's
land defenses are vulnerable, an uninterrupted sup
ply line along the length of the Malaya Peninsula
(whereas the British line is in constant danger of
bombardment) and the rich rubber and tin resources
of Malaya which have now fallen into their hands
(how much the British were able to devastate as they
fell back is not known.)

The British have on their side the advantages of
a consolidated position, the mile-wide water barrier
of the strait of Johore which has been thickly mined
and is swept by camouflaged artillery and concrete
machinegun pill boxes, and the arms of the fortress
itself.
As liabilities they have a population of 700,000
that must be fed and watered with reserve stores
(Singapore normally imports almost all of her food
supplies), not to mention the fact that there are no
adequate air raid shelters on the island.
The Japanese have in their favor superiority in
manpower and air power, the fact that Singapore's
land defenses are vulnerable, an uninterrupted sup
ply line along the length of the Malaya Peninsula
(whereas the British line is in constant danger of
bombardment) and the rich rubber and tin resources
of Malaya which have now fallen into their hands
(how much the British were able to devastate as they
fell back is not known.)
THHE chips are down in the battle for Singapore.
The great Allied naval fortress of the Far East has
been officially under seige for about 48 hours now
since the British forces, exhausted from the torturous
eight-week battle for the Malayan Peninsula, re
treated out of the swampy jungle, across the Johore
causeway and into the island fortress.
The retreat, through the 350 miles of ponderous
rubber groves, entangling shrubbery, and marshland
that make the Malayan jungle, was the culmination of
a desperate attempt by the Imperial forces to hold
the invading Japanese at arm's length.
Under an umbrella protection of the R.A.F.,
the British fell back across the Johore causeway
which bridges the mile and a half Johore strait that
separates the island fortress from the peninsula.
When the British had safely passed over, they
touched off the mines which had previously been
laid under the causeway and blasted it to the sky.
Whether they were successful in completely de
molishing the structure has not been ascertained yet.
An unconfirmed broadcast from Berlin last night
stated that Tokyo reported Japanese troops were ad
vancing over the causeway, that it had not been de
stroyed.

How long this siege will last is one of the crucial
determining factors in the battle for the Far East. The
small (27 miles long and 14 miles wide) island faces
onslaught today just as Hong Kong did a month ago,
and among its gravest problems is the one that was
the death of Hong Kong—water.
The British may not be blasted out of Singa
pore, they may be thirsted out and starved out.
The water supplies of the island are stored in a
number of reservoirs—just as they were at Hong
Kong—which, if they fell into Japanese hands,
would prove the sure end of British resistance.
Yesterday, the Japanese dispatches stated that the
British destroyed Singapore's main 14-inch water
supply line in their scorched-earth retreat.
The story is not confirmed by the British, however,
and is very likely untrue.

from the north, by land. However, it is safe to as

The water supplies of the island are stored in a
number of reservoirs—just as they were at Hong
Kong—which, if they fell into Japanese hands,
would prove the sure end of British resistance.
Yesterday, the Japanese dispatches stated that the
British destroyed Singapore's main 14-inch water
supply line in their scorched-earth retreat.
The story is not confirmed by the British, however,
and is very likely untrue.

SINGAPORE'S main strategic weakness in the pres
ent attack is that her defenses have always been
planned for an assault from the sea. She has a vast
ring of huge guns, pointing to the east, west, and
south—all facing the sea. The Japanese attack comes
from the north, by land. However, it is safe to as
sume that the British have been preparing for this
land assault at least for the past eight weeks, so that
they have inevitably installed land defences of some
sort.

CIZING up the situation it comes to about this:
The British have on their side the advantages of
a consolidated position, the mile-wide water barrier
of the strait of Johore which has been thickly mined
and is swept by camouflaged artillery and concrete
machinegun pill boxes, and the arms of the fortress
itself.
As liabilities they have a population of 700,000
that must be fed and watered with reserve stores
(Singapore normally imports almost all of her food
supplies), not to mention the fact that there are no
adequate air raid shelters on the island.
The Japanese have in their favor superiority in
manpower and air power, the fact that Singapore's
land defenses are vulnerable, an uninterrupted sup
ply line along the length of the Malaya Peninsula
(whereas the British line is in constant danger of
bombardment) and the rich rubber and tin resources
of Malaya which have now fallen into their hands
(how much the British were able to devastate as they
fell back is not known.)
