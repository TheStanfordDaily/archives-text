# BULL SESSION
## 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
so long Saroyan, you left a fine mark on
100 and will come through for 101. I guess I en
joyed Bull Session as much as anyone, but compli
ments are not in me. I am naturally mean. That's
how I got this job. I always manage to see the seams
in the finest material. If I were clever I would be
called a cynic.
You, Ches, managed to pass on what is undoubtedly
your innate enthusiasm for all that is pleasant. You
saw simple things and found them fun. You came
across pathos and made it human. Yet you know the
campus and understood its whims.
I would like to be able to state a policy, but that
is hard for me. I find that it is fun to criticize per
haps because that is so much easier than being help
ful. You went to bat for the student leaders when
they wanted to tighten the belt of Stanford's social
life. I would have done the opposite, merely to be
contrary. You advocated a "Dutch date" policy as
timely. Had I done so it would only have been to
poke fun at Stanford women.

OODBYE, Saroyan, from this column. Handle your
new job like you did your last. You're a night
editor now and I can say that I am sorry to see you
one, but only because it means that you will be with
us less often.
No mention of your column would be complete
without some reference to your physical sacrifices.
Misfortune smote you when your notes became fodder
for a cow instead of inspiration for Miss Bailey. But
this was naught compared to losing your toe for
democracy. This struck so deeply I read again Hora
tio and could not help but paraphrase Macauley in a
poor tribute to your unselfish gesture.
For how can man die better
When up against the foe,
Than realizing alhthe while
That for this he shed a toe?

I would like to be able to state a policy, but that
is hard for me. I find that it is fun to criticize per
haps because that is so much easier than being help

they wanted to tighten the belt of Stanford's social
life. I would have done the opposite, merely to be
contrary. You advocated a "Dutch date" policy as
timely. Had I done so it would only have been to
poke fun at Stanford women.

OODBYE, Saroyan, from this column. Handle your
new job like you did your last. You're a night
editor now and I can say that I am sorry to see you
one, but only because it means that you will be with
us less often.
No mention of your column would be complete
without some reference to your physical sacrifices.
Misfortune smote you when your notes became fodder
for a cow instead of inspiration for Miss Bailey. But
this was naught compared to losing your toe for
democracy. This struck so deeply I read again Hora
tio and could not help but paraphrase Macauley in a
poor tribute to your unselfish gesture.
For how can man die better
When up against the foe,
Than realizing alhthe while
That for this he shed a toe?
