### ET TU PAWNEE 
rpHE EDITOR, SIR:
I don't wish to be captious, but Pawnee's letter
to The Daily of January 30 cries aloud for comment.
The lofty tone of the letter, which, while exhorting
the editor to get his facts right before printing them,
proceeds to set forth facts which ai*e anything but
right, is a little too much.
And "vindictive" is an odd word to use in the
connection. To try to see that irresponsible persons
feel some of the effects of their irresponsibility is hard
ly "vindictive." "Salutary" is the word, Pawnee. And
the next time you are moved to write a letter to The
Daily, why not try to think a little before you begin
and get your thoughts right?
Sincerely yours,
Rose Burke
