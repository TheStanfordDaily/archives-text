"TWO-FACED WOMAN," now
playing at the Fox-Stanford The
ater in Palo Alto.
About the only thing that "Two-
Faced Woman" proves is that two
very skinny ladies who are no

thanks to the furor it raised among
the New York critics, in consequence
of which a great many scenes were
reshot. In case you are curious,
Garbo still wears that low-cut

pretty sexy deal, despite the doctor's
orders.
The film has its moments, but it is
certainly not of the high caliber of
most of the Silent Swede's movies.
"Ninochka" was billed as "Garbo

might be billed as "Garbo Gets Hys

on in a very unlady-like fashion.
Unless you cannot stand to miss
any of Garbo's infrequent screen
appearances, unless Constance Ben

"Two-Faced Woman." One face
would have been enough. Living
