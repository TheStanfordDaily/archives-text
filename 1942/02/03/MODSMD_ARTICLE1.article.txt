# Dutch East Indies Fliers Claim Sinking of Nippon Battleship in Sea Fighting
## Direct Hit Amidships Sends Jap Leviathan to Bottom on First Day Of Great Macassar Straits Battle 
### 
BA IA V lA, N.E.1., Feb. 2 (UP). —Netherlands Indies fliers said today
that they sank what apparently was a Japanese battleship with a direet
bomb hit amidship in the first day of the now famous battle of Macassar
Strait.
It had been announced a week ago that one of the largest ships in the

Japanese invasion fleet, presum
ably a battleship," was badly dam
aged by a bomb hit, but two Dutch
air officers who took part in the fighi
said on arriving here for a rest thai
the big ship sank—and that "Wt
think it was a battleship."
If true, this would be the second
Japanese battleship sunk by aii
bombs. Captain Colin P. Kelly
America's air hero, sank the 29,330-
ton Haruna off the P' Jippines.
'TREMENDOUS EXPI OSION'
The fliers said a 660-pound bomb
hit the big warship and that "there
was a tremendous explosion and a
thick cloud of black smoke rose into
the air." After the "cauliflower" of
smoke had passed away, no trace of
the ship was left, they said.
The fliers sighted a 23-ship sec
tion of the vast invasion fleet hug
ging the coast of Celebes on Jan. 23
and they charged in through an
elaborate balloon barrage, which was
attached to the larger ships and ex
tended up 9,000 feet, to open the
battle. In four days, the battle cost
the Japanese 32 ships.
PERSONAL ACCOUNT
The two fliers gave this account
of it:
"When our aircraft shot out of
the clouds the Jap destroyers began
to scuttle about their charges like
frightened water beetles," one flier
said. "But we came so fast and un
expectedly they didn't have a chance
to escape."
The convoy was east of the Bor
neo oil port of Balikpapan, where it
later forced a landing, and the
Dutch fliers sighted it through a rift
in the clouds.
"It consisted of two rows of trans
port ships protected by cruisers and
destroyers, and although we were
quite sure it was headed for Borneo,
it was still too far from the island
to have made any landings."
The Dutch force consisted of four
bomber patrols and two fighter
flights.
