# Navy Investigates Farm As West Coast Center For Air Cadet Training
## President Wilbur Denies Rumors On Final Choice of 'Air Annapolis' By Visiting Federal Authorities 
### 
Naval authorities have inspected Stanford's possibilities as a training
center for air cadets, it was revealed yesterday.
Kumois that the Stanford campus may be one of four universities des
ignated to handle the training of 30,000 pilots a year were quieted last
night with the announcement from the President's oflice that nothing

had been arranged.
Chancellor Kay Lyman Wilbur
said the Navy had been looking the
campus over but that no recom
mendations had been made.
"We don't know when they will
make a recommendation or what the
outcome of this thing will be," he
said.
STA N FORD'S ADVA NT A(; ES
According to the plan announced
Sunday from Washington, four new
ground schools for naval aviation
cadets will be established this spring.
Natural distribution of these train-

ing centers would place one in the
East, one in the South, another in
the Midwest, and a fourth in the
Far West.
The United Press reported St.
Mary s College as one of the insti
tutions under consideration.
Stanford would be a logical choice
because of the housing facilities here
and the plentiful space for all pur
poses.
INTENSIVE TRAINING
If Stanford is chosen as the far
western "Annapolis of the Air" the
facilities of the University will be
rented for the duration of the war.
It is understood the program will
be very intensive, the course lasting
a year, including strenuous physical
conditioning. After the year of
ground school, the men will go to
advanced flying school.
The program is apparently de
signed to produce pilots enough to
man the tremendous number of
planes asked by President Roosevelt.
The plan is to be in operation not
later than May 1.
