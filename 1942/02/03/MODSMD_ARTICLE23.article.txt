# Stanford Daily Initiates New Delivery Policy
## Boxes on Four Quad Corners to Serve As Circulation Points 
### 
Beginning tomorrow morning, The
Stanford Daily will mil l»t» delivered
in Palo Alto hut will he circulated
more extensively on the campus,
according to Dan Lewis, business
manager.
Ten convenient .spots in and
around the Quad have been picked
a r : distribution points. Copies of
The Daily will be pluccd in boxes
and left on the four corners of (lie
Quad, Chemistry Building, Educa
tion Building, Medical Building, Li
brary- Post Of lice, and the Union
Cellar.
"'Due lo a decrease in ads as a
3e«;ult of the war, we are cutting
down expenses by limiting distribu
tion to the campus," Dan Lewis de
i l.ir. d. "We feel this is an excellent
v.: v iu which to economize. Stu
ii' nts who formerly lived out of the
delivery zones will now yet their
papers in convenient places on the
campus."
Lewis asks students to co-operate
with The Daily for the first few days
while tlu circulation system is being
out. Shortages at any distribu
tion point will be remedied as soon
ci: possible, Lewis said.
l or people who still desire Dippies
delivered at their doors in Palo
Alto, mailing services will be avail
able for 75 cents per quarter to cover
postage.
"This new change will not cut
down circulation," Manager Lewis
said. "It will serve to reach more
students because those who resided
out of circulation routes can now
get papers on the campus."
"We are appealing to all students
to take Tlie Daily delivered to them,
rather than depending on one of the
distributing points for their morning
paper," Lewis said.
