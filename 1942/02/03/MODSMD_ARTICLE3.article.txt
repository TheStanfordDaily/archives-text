## Jap Troops Boatloads Sent Scurrying Back By 'Withering Fire' BULLETIN 
### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 3
(Broadcast recorded by UP San
Francisco). —Domei news agency
reported from the Philippines to
day that the Japanese have started
"what appears to be the final as
sault" against the stubborn de
fenses of the American-Filipino
army in the Bataan Peninsula.
A Domei Manila dispateli re
ceived in Saigon said Mac Arthur's
army was being attacked from
both the front and the rear.

SINGAPORE, Feb. 2 (UP). —
Three small boatloads of Japanese
troops, darting out of the smoke
from the burning town of Johore
Bahru on the southern tip of Malaya
in the first invasion feint at Singa
pore Island, were repulsed today by
withering machine gun fire.
One of the boats sank and the
others sped away with bullets spat
tering into their sides as the defend
ers of this besieged island fortress,
holding their fire until the Japanese
got within small arms range, dealt
with the invaders' first bold thrust.
Clouds of smoke billowed up from
Johore Bahru, a mile away across
the Johore Strait, but the roof of
Sultan H. H. Sir Ibrahim's Palace
still shimmered through the haze;
the residence flag still fluttered and
the government building still tow
ered over the city.
FIRE'S CAUSE UNKNOWN
(The dispatch did not explain
whether the city was set ablaze by
artillery fire from Singapore Island,
whether it was set before the im
perials withdrew from the Malaya
mainland, in line with the "scorched
earth" policy, or whether the Japa
nese were burning the city.)
Singapore's defenders kept a tense
vigil around the whole island coast
but few signs of life were visible on
the Japanese side of the strait. Hie
island was under relentless air at
tack—there had been five alerts at
mid-day—but there were no reports
of damage to military objectives. A
miniature torrent rushed through
the breach in the causeway leading
to the Johore mainland, which the
imperial troops dynamited when
they withdrew to the island, and it
was believed that the breach was
widening.
SEEK FOOTHOLD
The three marauding vessels were
identified only as "small craft" by a
military spokesman who said they
were laden with troops and appar
ently were seeking a foothold on the
coast.
British artillery studding the
north shore of the island blasted
ceaselessly at the Japanese army
of 200,000 or more massing on the
mainland across Johore Strait, con
centrating on the jungle roads
which crawlcd with men and equip
ment.
The Japanese air force stepped up
its aerial siege to a new peak of
intensity, evidently .trying to soften
up the imperial defenses, but the j
casualties among the Australian, In
dian and British garrison were
slight. Some damage was acknowl
edged by the Singapore command, j
By 10:30 a.m. four alarms had i
sounded. In one raid a formation
of Japanese planes dropped bombs
on the island.
