# Mascot Lauded As Able Actor
## 
### 
Mascot of the cast of "Marco Mil
lions," to be presented Feb. 5, G,
and 7, is little Nat Field, son of the
Pi Phi house cook. Nat, resplend
ent in turban and plumes, plays the
African slave boy, and is responsible
for presenting Kukachin with a
little puppy that Marco has brought
her as a gift.
He is pretty much of a natural
born actor, any member of the cast
will tell you, and Charles Vance
will wax enthusiastic over the way
he takes direction. But don't ask
Ellen Wylie, Adolfo Arias, or Lisle
Selby—all of whom act with him
if they think he will steal the scene.
You are liable to be knifed.
Besides Nat, there are four other
children in the cast, all of whom
might well be termed seasoned vet
erans. Jerry, Mary, and Dinora
Walters practically cut their teeth
on the stage of Memorial Hall, for
they belong to Jimmy Walters, cus
todian of the theater. Likewise John
Lievsay, son of Mrs. Lievsay, assist
ant to Helen Green. John even
helped with the costumes for "Mar
co," painting masks, running er
rands, and generally making him
self useful.
Jerry, Mary, Dinora, and John all
appeared in the casts of "The Bar
tered Bride" and "A Comedy of Er
rors" last year, and were pretty
sensational. Their roles in "Marco
Millions" are their best to date, they
claim.
