# Boxing Team to Meet Tough California Squad at Berkeley
## 
### 
"When the Stanford Boxing team meets the University of California
team at Berkeley (his Thursday night it will find itself definitely on the
long side of the odds quotations," said Coach Clayton Frye.
Stanford has the misfortune of opening up its varsity season against
one of the strongest fistic aggregations on the Coast. The complete Cal

squad is composed of returning,
veterans, and among them is a Pa
cific Coast champion and a runner
up from last year's championships.
Cal Coach Nemir places his hopes
in his 165-pound champion, Milt
Cunha. In the heavyweight divi
sion, Jack Thorburn is a strong fa
vorite to cop Thursday's match
against Bob McNeil, runner-up to
Hill Nourse in the All-U match.
Iti the light-heavyweight class
Ihere is stiff competition between
Don Grant and Pete Gadd. Frye
hopes that there will be two matches
at this weight, for he wishes to
utilize the potentialities of these two
promising men.
Jim Thurmond will most likely get

the call at the 165-pound class, with
John Hiskey a possible alternate.
There are three able men in the
155-pound class with Henry Clafiin,
A1 Smith, and Ira Fishman. Fish
man won over Thurmond in the 165-
pound weight class, but may be
under the 155 weight limit by bell
lime, in which case he will prob
ably start. Fishman is fast and ag
gressive, and never goes into a
fight without being in tip-top shape.
He is expected to be one of the
Cards' strongest contenders in the
Pacific Coast championships.
Frank Q. Hewitt is leading a long
list of contenders in the 145-pound
class that includes Johnson Chinn,

Ken Harris, Reginald Vela, and
j Aubrey Fairfax.
! John Hartman, Vic Wolcott, and
Russ Beardsley are working hard to
get the call in the 127-pound divi
j sion. Beardsley decisioned Hartman
in last week's Novice Tournament,
j while Vic Wolcott beat Malcolm
! Mynderse, in the 135-pound class, in
j the same tournament, and is capable
] of fighting in both weight classes.
