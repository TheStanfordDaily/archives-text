# Win Over Dons Rates Trojans Even Chance
## 
### 
The week-end off that Southern
California enjoyed Friday and Sat
urday included a game we failed to
mention a 52 -40 victory over
U.S.F. Glancing back through the
scorebook you can find that the
Redskins had their hands full tak
ing care of Mushy Silver and his
gang. .'{.'{-21), in the S.F. Civic Audi
torium some time hack.
Alex Omalev, Trojan forward,
scored 16 points against the Dons,
while guard Johnny Luber held the
highly touted and very effective
Mr. Silver to 11.
On the comparison of those two
games, the Trojans would seem to
have a decided edge. But their loss
to California brings the coming se
ries to a toss-up rating.
In the meantime praise must go
to Coach Everett Dean's second
stringers, who in the last 10 min
utes of the second half Saturday
matched the Bruins in points and
had good ball control and speed.
LONCSHOT GAME
In line with Sports Editor Thor
eau's shot chart of the second
U.C.L.A. game, don't look for the
same thing next Friday and Satur
day. When Bob Ormsby and the
aforementioned Omalev start their
floor maneuvers, the Indian defense
will have much more trouble keep
ing Troy away from the basket for
close shots.
The Bruins just couldn't work the
ball in past that giant 6-foot-4 de
fense, but we wouldn't be surprised
to see the Troy offense, considered
one of the fastest, get closer in for
set-ups and a generally closer-to
the-basket game.
DEFENSE TERRIFIC
If you were a spectator at the
U.C.L.A. games, you undoubtedly
thought the Indians' defense was
terrific, since it kept the Bruin
sharpshooters away from the basket.
But you also undoubtedly noticed
how many field goals were registered
from 15, 20, and 25 feet out. Those
looked awfully lucky when the op
position made them, but when Don
Burness canned a 30-footer as the
gun popped Friday, the Pavilion
went mad.
If the Trojans should suddenly
start doing the same thing and doing
it more often, Stanford's defense
will be forced to come out farther
and farther. Then the chances for
lay-in plays from fast-breaking
Southern Cal forwards will be just
as good as the Redskins' own speedy
offense.
Bruin Series Notes: Jack Dana
is developing into the best sub on
the Indian roster . . . the cause
for Bob Alshuler's injury in Fri
day's game was Larry Gittler's
left paw, swathed in bandages
Saturday night . . . Stanford was
veddy offensive Saturday: 18 per
sonal fouls were committed ... in
one tip-in session under the south
backboard Saturday the Red sky
scrapers were under the bucket
for a full minute trying for fol
lows . . .
