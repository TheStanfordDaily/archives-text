### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 2 (UP).—Club
owners of the National and Ameri
can baseball leagues announced in a
joint statement today that two all
star games will be played in 1942
for the benefit of the army bat-and
ball fund and that all players will
be requested to allot 10 per cent of
their seasonal salaries to the pur
chase of defense bonds.
The two all-star games will be
played on July 6 and July 7. The
first will be held at a "National
League park in the East" and the
second "at an American League
park in the West—except St. Louis,
which is too far removed from the
East for a one-day trip." If the sec
j ond game is awarded to a club
equipped with lights, it may be
played at night.
It was believed that the Ameri
can League was leader in a move
to greatly extend th ..rtber of
night games, now lir . t ed to seven
I per club per season.
