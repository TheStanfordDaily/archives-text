### H. D. THOREAU 
j FORMER editor of this news- j
paper who is now a sports writer
for a Frisco sheet spent 12 inches j
yesterday morning discussing the
comparative merits of the present
basketball team and the team of the
Luisetti era, along about 1936. Since
• I had a lecture to attend in which
I they take rigid attendance, I didn't
have time to read the whole story
j to get his views, but during the lec- I
! ture I formulated a few ideas of my
j own.
Admittedly Hank Luisetti was 1
j better than any of the present crop.
However, a man-to-man compari- ;
son shows that the 1941 model has :
the edge. This year's team is by i
far the taller of the two teams. Stork
Stoeffen was the only really big boy
on those Bunn-coaehed champion
ship teams, whereas Ed Voss, Howie
Dallmar, and Jim Pollard are all j
over 6-4. Also, this year's team
should improve tremendously since
this is the first year that more than
two of them have played together, j
Neither the "Laughing Boys" or
the current team had quite the pol
ish that last year's team had on
nights when they were working
well . But they had very little height
and were inconsistent.
Speaking of the "Laughing Boys" j
brings to mind the fact that this ;
i year's team doesn't have a name yet. j
They patterned the "Wow Boys
after the "Vow Boys." Maybe they j
can derive something from "Laugh- ;
ing Boys" that will fit Pollard, Bur
ness, Voss, Cowden, and Dallmar.
How does the "Beat the heck out
|of them boys" sound? Of course, if
i this was used too often it might be
! come cumbersome, but think how
! colorful it would be if, in years to
! come, they could refer to the 1942
team as the "Beat the heck out of
them boys." However, if you don't
like my name and can think of an
other, send your suggestion in to
our contest editor and it will be giv
en consideration.

11 ERE comes the stuff that is too
short to do anything with, so
we just throw it all in together. . . .
All Hoss in the first at Hialeah yes
terday is a sure thing. . , . Kenny
Davidson watched with much in
terest the elections in Chile since his
recently acquired coaching job at
Chile U. or Valparaiso Teachers'
depends upon the government party
staying in. . . . Keith Gledhill,
former Indian netter, made Wayne
Sabin's initial pro tourney a big
success by dropping a five-set match
to the Oregonian in the finals of the
Orlando matches this week. I think
that that was mighty considerate of
our boy Keith. . . . Rumor has it
that Mr. Masters is toying with the
idea of using some of that newly
discovered invisible glass for our
Pavilion backhoards.

yesterday morning discussing the
comparative merits of the present
basketball team and the team of the
Luisetti era, along about 1936. Since
• I had a lecture to attend in which
I they take rigid attendance, I didn't
have time to read the whole story
j to get his views, but during the lec- I
! ture I formulated a few ideas of my
j own.
Admittedly Hank Luisetti was 1
j better than any of the present crop.
However, a man-to-man compari- ;
son shows that the 1941 model has :
the edge. This year's team is by i
far the taller of the two teams. Stork
Stoeffen was the only really big boy
on those Bunn-coaehed champion
ship teams, whereas Ed Voss, Howie
Dallmar, and Jim Pollard are all j
over 6-4. Also, this year's team
should improve tremendously since
this is the first year that more than
two of them have played together, j
Neither the "Laughing Boys" or
the current team had quite the pol
ish that last year's team had on
nights when they were working
well . But they had very little height
and were inconsistent.
Speaking of the "Laughing Boys" j
brings to mind the fact that this ;
i year's team doesn't have a name yet. j
They patterned the "Wow Boys
after the "Vow Boys." Maybe they j
