MOST Ol' 'lIIE 1,180 WELDERS of the Scattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp. were idle in Tacoma, Wash.,
when the men struck in a renewal of strife between the independent welders and the A.F.L. unions with
which they have been affiliated. At the top, shipfittcrs are shown as they kibitz striking welders with
the victory gesture and, at bottom, welders give a newspaperman their walkout reasons. The strike was
caused by dismissal of nine welders for failure to pay dues to the Boilermakers Union, A.F.L.
