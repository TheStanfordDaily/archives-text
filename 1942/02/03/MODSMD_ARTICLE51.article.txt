AFTER weeks of wrangling, the price-control
legislation has been ironed out. It is hoped
that this is indicative of the new attitude in
Washington.
With the absolute need of immediate action
if we were to develop into the Arsenal of De
mocracy that was counted on, the Administra
tion finally got rid of the sputtering machinery
of OPM and concentrated all the say-so in one
body, gave one man the whip hand over that
body.
Since Donald Nelson has been able to pro
ceed knowing that he is in charge and not at
once the superior, egual, and subordinate of
William Knudsen, the production program has
been moving along more smoothly. There
seems little doubt about it. Overlapping boards
and divided responsibility have been cut off
and authority is more definitely delegated. No
longer is there any two-headed apparition at the
head of the production effort as there was in the
days when Knudsen and Sidney Hillman en
joyed egual authority.
The price-control legislation settlement repre
sents the new realization that producing articles
of war for our own defense is no laughing mat
ter. For weeks, Leon Henderson and Secretary
Wickard staged their own little battle over
who was going to have the say on farm price
ceilings. The matter was finally put under Hen
derson in order to consolidate the anti-inflation
front but veto powers are reserved for Secretary
Wickard. Now just how well this wrangling has
been settled remains to be seen but the fact
remains that some kind of agreement was
reached, some sacrifices made in the interest of
national welfare.
May other guarrels between representatives
of different interests go the same way.—Hap
