# Gentle Hint
## 
### 
HAVE the powers-that-be dropped the fresh
men a gentle hint?
A new gravel walk appeared this week on a
perfect diagonal from Encina to the Library. Less
subtle ways have been used to get people to
study. The new path to wisdom is raised six
inches above the high-tide mark. It will be
known as Phi Bete Alley Alternate.
The noise in the Libe doesn't bother you un
less you are politically inclined and have to look
up every time someone passes you. Frosh, the
old days of the rivet hammers on the War Libe
skeleton are gone; the carillon schedule has
been revised. The Library is now a pretty good
place to get something done â€”at least, better
than Encina.- Hap Everett
