ON HITLER, QUISLING,
ANO GRATEFUL NORWAY
r T , HE Nazis are trying everything in Norway tiiese
days. First it was the mailed fist, then the doc
trine of blonde brotherhood, and now they're calling
it "legalism."
That s a hot one. It just goes to prove that every
thing in this world is relative, and if you can go on
beating up old ladies and get away with it by calling
it legal, that seems to work too.
Norway is one of the prickliest thorns in Dear
Fuehrer's thorn-pricked side. It has helped of course
to have Vidkun (The Original) Quisling holding down
the fort there in Oslo, it has been a great comfort to
the Nazis too to have one of their boys, Josef Ter
boven, Grand Vizier and Overseer, on the spot thei'e,
but still things haven't been running as smoothly as
Hitler would like.
The Norwegian people haven't become convinced
after all this time that Hitler wants to be chums with
them, just as the loyal French, Belgians, Dutch, Poles,
Greeks, Serbs, and Czechs haven't gotten the idea.
* * * *
IT IS strange, because they have been treated so
well by their benevolent Nazi masters. First of all
they were purged of all the traitors in their midst, that
is, their loyal statesmen and leaders, those who pub
licly and out rightly resisted their emancipation by
the Germans, and that was nice.
Then they were allowed to get rid of their inde
pendent rulers and to have a German government
bossing things which meant that they could think Nazi,
talk Nazi, act Nazi or else, and that was nice.
Then they were granted the privilege of donating
virtually all their fish catch and the rest of their food
supply to headquarters in Berlin which left them
pretty hungry, and that was nice.
Then they saw those men who had opened the
gates of their cities to the Nazis put in positions of
authority to rule over them all with liberty and jus
tice for none, and that was nice.
Then Dear Fuehrer sent them one of his disciples
and swarthy Dr. Goebbels slapped them on their col
lective back and proclaimed them brothers in the
great blonde fraternity of Aryanism, and that was nice.
(And how would you like to be brothers with the
Nazis?)
* * * *
VST/ELL, you must admit that the Norwegians are a
fat bunch of ingrates because apparently they
haven't appreciated all Herr Hitler has done for them,
or if they have, they've been showing their gratitude
in a mighty funny way. They have resisted and sabo
taged and subversively activitied until Terboven is
blue in the face.
So now they have a new deal in Norway. Quisling
was made Premier of Norway the other day, and
took the oath of office with a brown-shirted, swastikad
cordon of his Nazi blonde brothers (he is a brunette,
incidentally) around him for protection against the
grateful people of his country.

So now they have a new deal in Norway. Quisling
was made Premier of Norway the other day, and
took the oath of office with a brown-shirted, swastikad
cordon of his Nazi blonde brothers (he is a brunette,
incidentally) around him for protection against the
grateful people of his country.

That s a hot one. It just goes to prove that every

beating up old ladies and get away with it by calling
it legal, that seems to work too.
Norway is one of the prickliest thorns in Dear
Fuehrer's thorn-pricked side. It has helped of course
to have Vidkun (The Original) Quisling holding down
the fort there in Oslo, it has been a great comfort to
the Nazis too to have one of their boys, Josef Ter
boven, Grand Vizier and Overseer, on the spot thei'e,
but still things haven't been running as smoothly as
Hitler would like.
The Norwegian people haven't become convinced
after all this time that Hitler wants to be chums with
them, just as the loyal French, Belgians, Dutch, Poles,
Greeks, Serbs, and Czechs haven't gotten the idea.

IT IS strange, because they have been treated so
well by their benevolent Nazi masters. First of all
they were purged of all the traitors in their midst, that
is, their loyal statesmen and leaders, those who pub
licly and out rightly resisted their emancipation by
the Germans, and that was nice.
Then they were allowed to get rid of their inde
pendent rulers and to have a German government
bossing things which meant that they could think Nazi,
talk Nazi, act Nazi or else, and that was nice.
Then they were granted the privilege of donating
virtually all their fish catch and the rest of their food
supply to headquarters in Berlin which left them
pretty hungry, and that was nice.
Then they saw those men who had opened the
gates of their cities to the Nazis put in positions of
authority to rule over them all with liberty and jus
tice for none, and that was nice.
Then Dear Fuehrer sent them one of his disciples
and swarthy Dr. Goebbels slapped them on their col
lective back and proclaimed them brothers in the
great blonde fraternity of Aryanism, and that was nice.
(And how would you like to be brothers with the
Nazis?)

VST/ELL, you must admit that the Norwegians are a
fat bunch of ingrates because apparently they
haven't appreciated all Herr Hitler has done for them,
or if they have, they've been showing their gratitude
in a mighty funny way. They have resisted and sabo
