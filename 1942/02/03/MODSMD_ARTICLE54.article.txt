### MIKE CHURCHILL 
HONEYMOON IN CORREGIDOR
ANNALEE WHITMORE was a Stanford girl but
overcame this handicap better than many. A D.G.,
Cap and Gown, and one of the few women managing
editors of The Daily, she graduated in 1937.
For the last two years she has worked for M.G.M.
and there collaborated with Tom Seller, Stanford '35,
to produce the Andy Hardy series. Mickey Rooney
was the studio's, not her idea.
But Annalee soon tired of studio routine. She was
at heart a newspaper woman and the world was full
of big news. So she got a job with United China Re
lief to go to China and send back publicity.
Finding no regular passage, in mid-August she left
on a freighter that took a month to cross. On board
was a Chinese missionary who offered to teach her
Chinese if she would stop smoking. She stopped and
learned some Chinese. She went at once to Hong Kong
and from there flew to Chungking.
Here in China's capital she met the Chiang Kai
sheks and soon became a close acquaintance of the
Generalissimo and his wife.

In Chungking at this time was Mel Jacoby, Stan
ford '39, Far East Bureau head for Time, Inc., and
broadcaster for NBC's foreign roundup.
Mel and Annalee had known each other for some
time and it was perhaps he who persuaded her to
go to China, for they soon planned to marry.
They arranged a huge Chinese celebration, with a
procession, band, carriages, and lots of rice, but the
imminent threat of war cancelled all this and Jacoby
was transferred with his staff to Manila. Annalee fol
lowed him there and they were married on her
arrival.
At this time she was working on a movie story,
"War Bride" (now in production at M.G.M.), the at
tack on Manila and her own marriage giving it a cer
tain authenticity. Being a talented and vigorous young
woman she continued to work on it while honey
mooning. It was mailed out on the last clipper.
Then Manila was besieged. The Jacoby's were
evacuated to Corregidor so that they could continue to
act as correspondents. Mel's despatches arc still com
ing over the news services. Annalee, I am sure, thinks
it is the best possible honeymoon.
The Whitmores arc not overly worried. Carol, Anna
lee's little sister, a freshman Kappa here, says, "Anna
lee will be able to talk herself out of anything but a
direct bomb hit."
