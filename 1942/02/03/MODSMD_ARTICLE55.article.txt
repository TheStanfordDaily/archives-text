## ROADS PERIL DEFENSE

r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
The present condition of the campus roads is a
peril to national defense. Our precious tires are tak
ing horrible punishment as a result of gigantic holes
in our roads. At times I have seen men filling up
holes of 50-cent-piece size, but never our campus
bomb craters. The holes at the Beta house corner
are in a formation that defies evasion. There arc
many equally menacing cavities spread at strategic
intervals around the campus. Let's see if we can't
fill some of these tire-damaging holes up sometime
before next winter.
