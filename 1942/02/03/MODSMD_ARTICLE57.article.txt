# Hammett Submits Resignation As Varsity Debate Manager
## 
### 
Robert Haiiiniett, Theta Xi, announced his resignation as Stanford
varsity debate manager at a meeting of Debate Council yesterday, and
James Frolik has been appointed to succeed him for the current year.
Final acceptance of Hammett's resignation lies with Ex Com. â€¢

In a letter to George Jackson,
student body president, Hammett re
vealed that the press of studies as a
senior engineering student forced
him to leave the post which he has
filled for a year and a half. The
letter stated that Professor Lee
Chapin, former varsity coach now
on an exchange professorship in
Hawaii, has asked Hammett to re
main on as manager this year until
the new coach, N. B. Beck, was
thoroughly acquainted with the de
bate situation at Stanford.
JUNIOR MANAGERS PROPOSED
Hammett also stated, "In the fu
ture, the Debate Council should plan
to give the managership to juniors.
The chain of progression to the post
is so tedious that it is difficult for a
student to remain interested four
years, and the duties are certainly
not beyond the capabilities of a
junior. With this in mind, I have
started the practice of training
freshman managers for the frosh
squad. They have all been ener
getic and successful."
The Debate Council also voted to
approve expenditures out of the
varsity debate budget for tourna
ment fees at the annual Stockton
speech tournament for varsity de
baters later in the quarter. The
Stanford freshman squad was au
thorized to make whatever pay
ments from their budget that they
deemed advisable for the trip. Plans
were also discussed for the annual
nationwide tour of two varsity de
baters in spring quarter.
DEBATES POSTPONED
Three debates in the Delta Sigma
Rho tourney were postponed until
Wednesday. Dr. N. B. Beck an
nounced that the round table on
Latin American affairs to have been
conducted by Graham Stuart today
at 4 in the Memorial Hall round
table room has been postponed until
Thursday at that same time.
