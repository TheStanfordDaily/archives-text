# Battalion of Bluejackets, Marines, Lands to Help Heroic Bataan Defenders
## Small New Force Does Not Indicate That MacArthur Has Received Any Substantial Aid 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (Ul').—A naval battalion of blue jackets and
marines has been organized on Bataan Peninsula to figbt with the Ameri
can-Filipino forces of Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur, the Navy disclosed
tonight.
At the same time the communique revealed that a motor torpedo boat

of the Asiatic fleet was believed
have torpedoed an enemy warship I
during a night action inside Manila
Bay. The naval tanker Neches was
torpedoed and sunk by an enemy
submarine in undisclosed waters
with 56 men missing and 125 known
rescued.
Navy spokesmen refused to en
large upon tonight's communique,
but it appeared most likely that the
battalion of Marines and Bluejack
ets had been made up from forces
already within the Philippines and
did not come from some outside
source.
MARINES AVAILABLE
Available to Mac Arthur would be
many Marines in the Manila Bay
fortifications and it has been known
for weeks that small naval forces,
manning the torpedo boats, have
continued to operate in waters
around Luzon Island despite the
withdrawal of Admiral Thomas
Hart's main Asiatic forces to the
East Indies.
From the wording of the com
munique it appeared that the num
ber of reinforcements landed on
Bataan was relatively small and still
would not mean that Mac Arthur had
received substantial help.
A War Department communique
this morning indicated Mac Arthur
was clinging tenaciously to the
lower half of Bataan Peninsula after
blasting two Jap attempts to put re
inforcements ashore.
INVASIONS ROUTED
Mac Arthur's small air fleet routed
one hivasion while his artillery
halted the second.
"The Japanese force suffered
heavy casualties in men and boats,"
Mac Arthur reported. "On the fol -
lowing morning a number of disabled
barges were found along the
beaches."
War Department Communique No.
1)0 said that defense forces on the
right side of Mac Arthur's line, not
content with repelling an attempt by
the Japanese 65th Division to drive
a wedge through them, counter-at
tacked and "overran three lines of
enemy tranches, capturing consid
erable equipment."
