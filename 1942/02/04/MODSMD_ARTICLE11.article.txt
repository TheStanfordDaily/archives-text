# Holsti Tells Of Quisling Power Rise
## Professor Presents Intimate Picture Of Norwegian Premier 
### HAP EVERETT 
"Quisling had no obvious political
ambitions until he was sent to Mos
cow by the Norwegian government," j
Rudolf Ilolsti, former Finnish diplo
mat, now a political science profes
sor at Stanford, said yesterday when
he was asked about the new Norwe
gian premier.
"He was a very quiet man when
I knew him in the 'twenties," Pro
fessor Holsti explained. "At that
time he was a military attache to
Helsinki and I was minister of for
eign affairs in Finland. I got to
know him quite well, but of course I
have not been in touch with him for
years."
Professor Holsti said that Quis
ling got his anti-democratic founda
tion while serving the Norwegian
government in Russia and at this
time is became clear that he wanted
a political career.
BECAME BOLSHEVIK
Quisling, who had become a Bol
shevik, saw a chance to move up
through Norwegian labor groups
which were full of communists, and
it was his failure in this pian that
made him turn to Fascist views.
In no way, according to Professor
Holsti, did this represent any big
increase in Nazi strength in Norway
at the time, for at the outbreak of
the war the Norwegian government
was strongly moderate-socialist.
Professor Holsti said he did not
believe that there were more than
a handful of Norwegian Nazis and
that these were probably acting in
dependently of National Socialists in
other countries like Holland, except
for the fact that Germany was be
hind all the moves.
A FEW TRAITORS
In other words, there wasn't any
great tendency toward Fascism in
Norway nor was there any excep
tionally large group of traitors;
merely a few fifth-columnists
strongly backed by Germany.
"I have just heard through the
Finnish moderate-socialist party or
gan that Quisling had less than 30,000
followers in the last free election
and almost half a million votes
against him," said Professor Holsti.
"This shows that the vast majority
of Norwegians were in opposition to
Nazi ideas."
"Anyway," he concluded, "Norway
has always been pro-British due
mainly to the fact that British trade
has been invaluable to the giant
merchant marine of Norway. There
is no reason to suspect that Norway,
except for the small Quisling group,
had Nazi sympathies at the time the
Germans took over.
