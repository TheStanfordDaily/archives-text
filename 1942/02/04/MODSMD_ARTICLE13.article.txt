# Cast to Finish Rehearsals For O'Neill's 'Marco Millions'
## 
### 
Tonight is the night when Direc
tor Charles Vance will run his cast
of "Marco Millions" through its
paces for the last time before per
formance tomorrow. There will be
about 190 people running around
the Memorial Theater, getting into
costumes, daubing themselves with
grease paint, sticking on beards, and
running over their lines.
Others will be dragging spot
lights into position, setting up the
stage, and looking after the proper
ties. Still more will be tuning up
their instruments, running over the
music, and testing for sound effects.
And so, one of the most exotic pro
ductions ever to be presented at
Stanford will be ready for campus
consumption.
The first dress rehearsal went
pretty smoothly, although a few
Tartar headdresses were spotted in
the Hindu scene, and fleeting glimps
es of pale pink panties were seen
through gaps in costumes; a couple

of the extras were a little late with I
their entrances, and one poor fel- i
low, missing all evening, was finally '
found wandering around the base
ment unable .to find his way out.
Almost the last straw was the hue
and cry sent out for Kublai Khan
(Adolfo Arias) when he missed his
cue and was discovered happily
waltzing in the hall with Donata
(Marcia Shaughncssy).
According to Vance, "Marco" is
shaping up beautifully. "If this show
is a success, it won't be the fault of
any one person. Everyone has
{ pitched in and worked hard and
long on it, and I'd like to thank
them all," he said.
Featured in "the cast of "Marco
j Millions" are Adolfo Arias as Ku
blai Khan; Ellen Wylie, Kukachin;
Lisle Selby, Marco Polo; John High,
MafTeo; Brownlee Corrin, Nicolo;
Marcia Shaughnessy, Donata;

1 Bob O'Neill as Chu Yin.

The first dress rehearsal went
pretty smoothly, although a few
Tartar headdresses were spotted in
the Hindu scene, and fleeting glimps
es of pale pink panties were seen
through gaps in costumes; a couple

of the extras were a little late with I
their entrances, and one poor fel- i
low, missing all evening, was finally '
found wandering around the base
ment unable .to find his way out.
Almost the last straw was the hue
and cry sent out for Kublai Khan
(Adolfo Arias) when he missed his
cue and was discovered happily
waltzing in the hall with Donata
(Marcia Shaughncssy).
According to Vance, "Marco" is
shaping up beautifully. "If this show
is a success, it won't be the fault of
any one person. Everyone has
{ pitched in and worked hard and
long on it, and I'd like to thank
them all," he said.
Featured in "the cast of "Marco
j Millions" are Adolfo Arias as Ku
blai Khan; Ellen Wylie, Kukachin;
Lisle Selby, Marco Polo; John High,
MafTeo; Brownlee Corrin, Nicolo;
Marcia Shaughnessy, Donata;
Jaques Poley, the Courtesan; and
1 Bob O'Neill as Chu Yin.
Tonight is the night when Direc
tor Charles Vance will run his cast
of "Marco Millions" through its
paces for the last time before per
formance tomorrow. There will be
about 190 people running around
the Memorial Theater, getting into
costumes, daubing themselves with
grease paint, sticking on beards, and
running over their lines.
Others will be dragging spot
lights into position, setting up the
stage, and looking after the proper
ties. Still more will be tuning up
their instruments, running over the
music, and testing for sound effects.
And so, one of the most exotic pro
ductions ever to be presented at
Stanford will be ready for campus
consumption.
