# Stanford Goes to War
## 
### 
Stanford went to war yesterday.
Notwithstanding the fact that
there really weren't any bombs or
airplanes or enemy soldiers, to ev
eryone from the heads of the Uni
versity to the local Boy Scout who
was head messenger at the nerve
center, it was deadly serious busi
ness.
It was serious business to the three
men located before the row of tele
phones at the main control booth,
receiving calls from every one of
the main bombardment centers over
the campus. They were checking on
casualties, on incendiary bombs, and
on the equipment in readiness all
over Stanford land. They saw that
police, first aid squads, R.O.T.C.
units, and materials were spread to
every point. They knew that some
day it might not be practice.
Stanford is divided into many
sections called bombardment zones.

These are all colored differently on
the key map in the nerve center. It
reminded one of a huge game of
chess played by telephone, with the
control operators moving trucks and
men here and there to meet emer
gencies.
Some of the watchers of the R. 0.-
T.C. in action spent their time in
yelling to their friend "Joe." Joe
couldn't laugh back because he was
in the back taw and the corporal
was watching, but most of the "Joes"
didn't think it was laughable any
way.
"Let's wipe it off," yelled the cor
poral to smiling soldiers. Stanford
wiped it off and got down to the grim
business of war preparation. Presi
dent Wilbur looked into a bucket of
sand and said, "Guess what's in
here!"
But the sand was only a symbol
of a Stanford that had shown itself
ready and in orderâ€”for anything.
