I IRE SINGAPORE
SINGAPORE. Feb. 3 (UP). -
Waves of Japanese dive bombers
and high alt'tude fliers attacked
Singapore Island savagely today,
starting new fires, but the massed
invasion army on the other side of
mile-wide Johore Strait was strange
ly silent and the defenders were
alert for signs of a trick.
There were almost no signs of life
on the Japanese side of the strait
and British fliers, who ranged as
much as 50 miles north into the
Malaya Peninsula to blast the air
port at Kluang and machine gun
Japanese transports from low alti
tude along the roads, brought back
little information on what the in
vaders were doing. Some officials
here thought the Japanese were
quietly building rafts preparatory to
storming the strait, and others be
lieved they would attempt to by
pass and encircle Singapore by in
vading Sumatra and the Netherlands
Indies Islands directly south of here.
