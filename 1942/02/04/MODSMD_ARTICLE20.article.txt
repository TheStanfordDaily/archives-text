# Dr. Allen Returns From Capitol Trip
## 
### 
Dr. Warren D. Allen, chairman of
the Division of Music, has just re
turned from a trip to Washington,
D.C., where he attended a meeting
of the Advisory Committee on Mu
sic in the Division of Cultural Rela
tions in the Department, of State,
of which he is a member.
The committee is co-operating
with Nelson Rockefeller, coordina
tor of Latin American relations, and
is primarily concerned at present
with Latin American relations.
"Our neighbors to the South have
previously looked to Europe in cul
tural as well as in economic rela
tions. They are increasingly eager,
however, to promote a hemispheric
solidarity in the arts," Dr. Allen
said. Studies being made on the
Pacific Coast are now particularly
important with regard to our new
allies in the Pacific, and Chinese re
lations are also to be under the juris
diction of the committee.
