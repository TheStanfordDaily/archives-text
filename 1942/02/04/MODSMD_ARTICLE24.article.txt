# Defense Leaders Term Farm's Mobilization 'Very Successful'
## School Air-Raid Organizations Get Full Test 
### VIC MINAHAN 
With the piercing blast of the air'
â€¢aid siren, the measured tread of
narchiftg men and the sharp com
mands of R.O.T.C. officers and air
raid wardens, Stanford yesterday
leld what Civilian Defense Author
ities described as a "very satisfac
tory" full wartime mobilization and
air-raid drill.
Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson,
20-chairman of the Civilian Defense
Committee, last night said that he,
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, and
other authorities were "highly
pleased" over the manner in which
the practice was carried out.
Professor Robinson, Dr. Wilbur,
and other student and faculty de
fense leaders began a tour of the
campus shortly after the alarm siren
sounded at 4:10 p.m., visiting the
various "nerve centers" and first
aid posts, and inspecting the R.O.T.C.
units which organized automatically
on the sounding of the alarm.
"Everybody seemed to be doing
his part," Professor Robinson com
mented.
SPRING INTO ACTIVITY
Immediately upon the sound of
the alarm siren, defense organiza
tions all over the campus sprang
into activity. Police cars raced
from the Corp Yard office to their
respective stations, campus firemen
reported to the Firehouse, ready to
respond to any call; six R.O.T.C. bat
teries, comprising more than 600
men, organized quickly and quietly
on the sunken road at Geology Cor
ner, from which they marched quick
time to assigned posts.
At first-aid centers, doctors, med
ical students and other first-aid
workers assembled for instruction. In
each of the campus' 26 defense
areas, air raid wardens reported to
their respective communication
boxes, from which they received or
ders from the campus main com
munications center in the Corpora
tion Yard. The latter, on which a
24-hour watch is kept regularly, is
in direct communication with the
Fourth Interceptor Command in San
Francisco.
Throughout the hour and ten min
utes in which the campus was on
the alert, these units stayed at their
posts. At most of the centers, in
struction was carried out by unit
leaders, while units which had al
ready received instruction in their
duties spent the time practicing.
DETAILED PLAN
The organization of the R.O.T.C.
batteries went ahead according to a
detailed plan worked out by Colonel
Harry B. Allen and his staff. Bat
teries A, D, E, and F were assigned
to fire control work, and distributed
themselves throughout the campus
for that purpose. Battery F, the en
gineer's unit, was given special in
cendiary bomb work. Battery II
was assigned to police duty, and
Battery C, having had special train
ing in first aid, was given work in
that field.
Col. Allen last night said the
R.O.T.C. units had behaved "ad
mirably," and described himself as
very pleased with the drill.
This was the first full air-raid
drill to be held on campus since the
beginning of the war. Various units,
especially first-aid, and fire-fighting
squads, have been practicing contin
ually, but yesterday's dress rehearsal
was the first in which all units under
the Civilian Defense Committee
acted together.
