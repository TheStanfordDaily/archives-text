## 
### 
EI Capitan clowned the Firehouse
five 20-18 in a hard-fought mural
hoop game last night which tied
Capitan and Firehouse for second
place behind the Phi Psis in
League 3.
Paul Wilson led the scoring for the
winners with 8 points, and was the
stand-out player of the evening on
defense and floor work. Frank Pfyl
of the Firehouse equalled Wilson,
chalking up 8 points. Both teams
were outstanding on defense as
shown by the close score, and the
excellent teamwork marks both
teams as potential play-off squads for
the mural crown.
The game opened slowly and the
Firehouse gained a 3-point lead at
the half-time with the score stand
ing 15-12. Capitan tightened its de
fense and in the last quarter, with

complete control of the ball, over
came the lead and Frank Rogers
dropped the winning basket in from
the center of the floor. Smiley Cam
eron and Clyde Pitchford both
chalked up 4 points for the Capitan,
while Rogers and Nick Bills trailed
with one apiece.
The Pfyl brothers both played
good ball for the Firehouse, with
Frank Pfyl leading the team's scor
ing with shots right under the
basket. George Kaufman was also a
standout, looping in (i points from
far out, though continually ham
pered by Wilson.
There were few tip-ins because of
the tight defensive play of the two
squads and the play became partic
ularly heated toward the end of the
game when Capitan gained control
of the ball and turned the tide.
Capitan has wins over the Phi Kaps
and Firehouse, and lost to the Phi
Psi squadr while the Firehouse has
beaten the Dekes and Phi Kaps, and
dropped one to Capitan. Should the
Firehouse upset the Phi Psis, last
year's mural champions, there will
be a three-way tie for the first spot
in the league.
Alpha Delt staved off a strong
Beta rally led by Harry Reichling
1o win by a final score of 24-22. The
Alpha Delts stalled during the last
few minutes of play, and during the
last two minutes Reichling made 8
points in an amazing burst of en
ergy. Reichling was high-point man
with 10 points. The win ties the
Alpha Delts with Phi Psi II and the
Business School for the first spot in
League 8.
The Kappa Sig-Sigma Nu II game
was not the trackmeet that the score
indicates. The Kappa Sigs displayed
good team work led by John Brooks,

There were few tip-ins because of
the tight defensive play of the two
squads and the play became partic
ularly heated toward the end of the
game when Capitan gained control
of the ball and turned the tide.
Capitan has wins over the Phi Kaps
and Firehouse, and lost to the Phi
Psi squadr while the Firehouse has
beaten the Dekes and Phi Kaps, and
dropped one to Capitan. Should the
Firehouse upset the Phi Psis, last
year's mural champions, there will
be a three-way tie for the first spot
in the league.
Alpha Delt staved off a strong
Beta rally led by Harry Reichling
1o win by a final score of 24-22. The
Alpha Delts stalled during the last
few minutes of play, and during the
last two minutes Reichling made 8
points in an amazing burst of en
ergy. Reichling was high-point man
with 10 points. The win ties the
Alpha Delts with Phi Psi II and the
Business School for the first spot in
League 8.
The Kappa Sig-Sigma Nu II game
was not the trackmeet that the score
indicates. The Kappa Sigs displayed
good team work led by John Brooks,
who scored 25 points. Of the 8 Sig
Nu II players 6 have never played
basketball, and should be commend
ed for their first showing.
Phil Moss was the sparkplug of
the Chem team's offensive with a
high score of 14 points to win over
Sequoia 45-20. He was followed by
Merv Hamlin with 12 points.
EI Capitan clowned the Firehouse
five 20-18 in a hard-fought mural
hoop game last night which tied
Capitan and Firehouse for second
place behind the Phi Psis in
League 3.
Paul Wilson led the scoring for the
winners with 8 points, and was the
stand-out player of the evening on
defense and floor work. Frank Pfyl
of the Firehouse equalled Wilson,
chalking up 8 points. Both teams
were outstanding on defense as
shown by the close score, and the
excellent teamwork marks both
teams as potential play-off squads for
the mural crown.
The game opened slowly and the
Firehouse gained a 3-point lead at
the half-time with the score stand

complete control of the ball, over
came the lead and Frank Rogers
dropped the winning basket in from
the center of the floor. Smiley Cam
eron and Clyde Pitchford both
chalked up 4 points for the Capitan,
while Rogers and Nick Bills trailed
with one apiece.
The Pfyl brothers both played
good ball for the Firehouse, with
Frank Pfyl leading the team's scor
ing with shots right under the
basket. George Kaufman was also a
standout, looping in (i points from
far out, though continually ham
pered by Wilson.
There were few tip-ins because of
the tight defensive play of the two
squads and the play became partic
ularly heated toward the end of the
game when Capitan gained control
of the ball and turned the tide.
Capitan has wins over the Phi Kaps
and Firehouse, and lost to the Phi
Psi squadr while the Firehouse has
beaten the Dekes and Phi Kaps, and
dropped one to Capitan. Should the
Firehouse upset the Phi Psis, last
year's mural champions, there will
be a three-way tie for the first spot
in the league.
Alpha Delt staved off a strong
Beta rally led by Harry Reichling
1o win by a final score of 24-22. The
Alpha Delts stalled during the last
few minutes of play, and during the
last two minutes Reichling made 8
points in an amazing burst of en
ergy. Reichling was high-point man
with 10 points. The win ties the
Alpha Delts with Phi Psi II and the
Business School for the first spot in
League 8.
The Kappa Sig-Sigma Nu II game
was not the trackmeet that the score
indicates. The Kappa Sigs displayed
good team work led by John Brooks,
who scored 25 points. Of the 8 Sig
Nu II players 6 have never played
basketball, and should be commend
ed for their first showing.
Phil Moss was the sparkplug of
the Chem team's offensive with a
high score of 14 points to win over
Sequoia 45-20. He was followed by
Merv Hamlin with 12 points.
