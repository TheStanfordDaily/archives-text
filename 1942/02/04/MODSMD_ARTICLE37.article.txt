i VERY few days a publicity blast j
j will come out of Berkeley about ;
i the sensational track team Cal is go- j
I ing to have this spring, what with j
Hal Davis, Grover Klemmer, Guinn !
Smith, Jim Jurkovich, and some j
other lesser lights. Maybe Brutus
Hamilton's boys will eke out victo
ries over us and U.C.L.A., but they
are still within a long way of ever
defeating the Cromwell - coached I
I U.S.C. Trojans.
For example Davis, the world's
j fastest human, will have to face '
Eddie Morris, Jim O'Reilly, Jack j
j Trout, Howard Callanan, Ritchie
j Browning, Jim Jenkins, Stan Skafte,
! Cliff Bourland, Hubie Kerns, and a
j lot of guys you've never heard of,
! either. Of course Cromwell won't be
I able to run all of these men at the
| same time, but even at three-at-a-
I time, Davis is going to have trouble. !
The last time Klemmer raced !
Hubie Kerns at 440 yards, Kerns won j
by two yards going away. It was on
our own stadium track in the j
j N.CAA and despite the relatively (
j slow conditions that clay, Kerns ran j
]4G.6, or the fifth fastest quarter- j
I mile that has ever been run any- j
place, anytime, by anybody.
That is just a sample of the j
strength that is brewing down be- (
hind the green board fence at Bo
vard Field. In order not to bore the |
majority of you, I will not go on to j
mention the 20 other world-beaters j
they have, but anyone who is inter- J
ested can have a personal interview {
on the subject.
H AD it not been for the Japanese j
disturbing the hung-over slum- |
bers of Pearl Harbor on that peace
ful Sunday morning in December,
Fordy Anderson would probably
still be in school and playing bas
ketball for L.S.J.U. If they hadn't!
and if he were, where would he fit j
in with the team that is now playing
for Everett Dean?
Perhaps it's just as well that he is
serving Uncle Sam, as the news- j
reels put it, not to mention greatly I
helping the Great Lakes Naval Base
cage team. G.L.N.B. boys are mop
pins? up on the Big Ten and all other
collegiate basketball in the midwest
thi> season. They even got a two- I
column spread and a picture in Time j
Mag. not so long ago. Listed as the j
bes first string right forward on
their team is our boy Fordy.

JT IS too bad that the deadest
dead-eye in school can't go out
for basketball. He is Woodrow Reid
W( ir, a health graduate and a pro.
Aj a matter of strict fact, he is the
assistant coach, and frosh coach.
When there is nothing more im
portant on the fire out at the Pa
vi:on, Woody stands out there and
pi inks the ball through the allotted
space from all corners of the court
w h amazing regularity.
