### BOB SONTAG 
U.S.C.'s Terrible Trojans, meeting Stanford here Friday and Satur
day. bring with them an impressive list of victories and near-victories
chalked up so far during the practice and '42 conference seasons.

t Mere are trie troy scores:
17 Loyola of L.A. 152
53 Santa Clara 42
49 U.S.F. (ov.) 51
45 Long Island U. 16
46 Temple 49
43 Canisius College 39
54 De Paul 48
59 U.C.L.A. 51
; 5K California 4(i
3(5 California 41
52 U.S.F. 11l
That gives Southern Cal seven
wins and four losses, but the de
feats were as close as that gnat's
i eyelash heard of so often.
Last year the Redskins took four
| straight from Troy: 53-37, 39-34.
; 46-38, and 43-36.
Again under the tutelage of erst
while Sam Barry, the Trojans bring
up another powerhouse squad, load
ed with dynamite shooting ability
and speed. During Barry's 12-year
basketball coaching reign, the Tro
jans only once slipped down as low
as third in the southern division of
the conference. His 1932, '36, and
'39 squads tied for the Southern Di
vision championship but each time
i lost a one-game play-off away from
home for the title.
In competition with Southern Di
j vision rivals, Barry teams have won
10 series and lost 2 to U.C.L.A., won
: 8 and tied 2 and lost 2 with Cali-
J fornia. and won 8 and lost to Stan- j
; ford. The win-lost column shows 40 j
: victories over the Bruins to only 4
i defeats, 30 wins over the Bears to
i 18 losses, and 28 victories over the 1
Indians to 20 defeats.
To the first-string club itself:
Boh Ormsby: High scorer for S.C.
| with 108 points in 10 games. Usually !
J good for 9. 10, or 11 points per game, i
i Not very fast but has a good one
hander.
Alex Omalev: 56 points in 10
j games: can be awfully hot or awfully
1 cold but usually plugs along with
! about (i per game. Fairly slow afoot.
Len Berg: Second high scorer for ,
, the Trojans with 80 points. Six-foot
three and great tip-in artist. A re
j serve forward last season, Big Lenny
I has been graduated to the regular
| ranks.
John Luber: Fast, clever dribbler, |
tries to keep his slower teammates i
jon the move. Now enlisted as sec
; ond-class seaman but will become !
| an officer as soon as he is enlisted in j
Naval Reserve Aviation Flight !
Training.
Ted (iossard: One of the best. G
feet-2, Gossard plays one of the I
guard spots after moving over from j
a forward last year.
Carter O'Rourke, DePaul basket- ;
; ball player, has not tasted meat in
his 22 years.
