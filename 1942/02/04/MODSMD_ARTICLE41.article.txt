# Frosh to Meet Lowell Friday
## 
### 
Lowell High of San Franctsco,
once beaten in three starts, and
coached by the same Benny Neff
that first tutored Don Burness, Bill
Cowden, and Howie Dallmar, meets
the Stanford freshman hoop team in
the Pavilion Friday night at 6:15 in
a preliminary to the U.S.C. game.
It will be more than just a gather
ing of the tribes (both teams are af
fectionately booed and cheered as
Indians, etc.). It will be a chance
for the Papeese to get out from be
hind the quite sizeable eight ball
they acquired in the Paly High tilt
last week. The Lowells have three
men that are fully capable of keep
ing the locals in the shade. They are
Jerry Coleman, forward; Bob Cher
ry, center; and Frank Kudelka, for
ward.
Coleman ranks number two in San
Francisco season scoring standings,
having sunk 11 field goals and 11
free throws to hoop a total of 33
points. Cherry is number six man
with 11 field goals and three free
(lips for 25 points.
The Lowells dumped Abe Lincoln,
42-26, in their opener and downed
Galileo, 36-19, last week. In between
was their 23-19 loss to the St. Igna
tius quint which upset unanimous
dope in the Indians' favor.
High school prcpsters seem to be
a nemesis for the frosh if they are
tall and have good shooting eyes.
The Lowell squad, built around
Cherry, Coleman, Kudelka, and
guards Cooke and Wigmore, fits the
description like Lana Turner in a
sweater.
Coach Phil Bengtson is whipping
his team back into shape after their
neighborly tilt of Friday, and the
combined wrath of Heald, Parsons,
Brown, Barsocchini, and Hall is be
ginning to show in some snappy
passing in the workouts. The Cal
frosh beat the Lowells 38-28 last
week. The Stanford frosh could re
new supporters' hopes by adding
about five points to the margin . . .
on the right side.
