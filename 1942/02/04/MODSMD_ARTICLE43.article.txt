# Redskins to Meet Britishers In Rugby Struggle Saturday
## 
### DICK KEUSINK 
Coach Jim Wylie and his Redskin-ruggers will take on a British team
from the 11. M.S. Orion next Saturday. The rain over last week-end can
celled the game with the Santa Rosa varsity. Saturday's frosh rugby
game with .Menlo Junior College was also postponed.
This is the second time in as many weeks that the varsity and the

trosh teams have had to cancel
games due to the rain. Coach Jim
Wylie and his ruggers can't very
well slop through the wet weather
in practice either, consequently it
will be quite a game next Saturday,
if it doesn't rain again, when the
Redskins meet the Britishers in the
rescheduled match. Both the boys on
the Farm, and the sailors seem to be
slightly out of condition. The two
teams tried to meet for a match two
weeks ago but got rained out.

Wylie and his ruggers can't very
well slop through the wet weather
in practice either, consequently it
will be quite a game next Saturday,
if it doesn't rain again, when the
Redskins meet the Britishers in the
rescheduled match. Both the boys on
the Farm, and the sailors seem to be
slightly out of condition. The two
teams tried to meet for a match two
weeks ago but got rained out.
