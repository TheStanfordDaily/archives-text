THE Red Cross has refused to accept profits
of the Charity Ball if their name or insignia
is used in publicity, on posters, or on the dance
bids unless total gross receipts are turned over
to them.
This means the orchestra could not be paid,
that no expenses could be incurred in giving
the dance, and that all services would have
to be donated.
This also means the Red Cross is letting some
$500 slip through its fingers.
It further means that Charity Ball officials
have been forced to tear down their posters,
print new ones, and eliminate the Red Cross
name from dance bids, which already have
been printed. This inconvenience, while
slight, is worth mentioning. True, perhaps
dance officials did not check with Red Cross
authorities for permission to use the name be
fore proceeding with publicity.
Reason for the Red Cross action was stated
last night to Ex Committee that were it not for
their ruling any fly-by-night outfit could throw
a party in the name of the Red Cross, reap
profits and then give them whatever profits it
felt like.
The Red Cross is an international organiza
tion which has dealt for a long time not only
with small groups but with governments of
whole nations—experience must have taught
them that their standing rule in this connection
is the best policy in the long run.
If one is to believe current Red Cross pleas
for increased donations, necessitated because
of mushrooming new needs in the nation's war,
and certainly there is every reason to believe
such, then it seems inconsistent to refuse the
offer of Stanford's Charity Ball.
We condemn this policy.
Further, we strongly recommend the Red
Cross national office change their ruling to con
form with increased need to accept donations
from organizations which they have found rep
utable upon investigation.
While the Red Cross name cannot and will
not be used in publicity, profits of the Charity
Ball may still be given them. But unless they
change their policy, or unless better reasons
are given why they should not do so, we submit
there is a charity right on our own campus, the
Convalescent Home, which should get the
money. Or give it to any other charity.
In the present case, investigation by the Red
Cross would prove sponsors of the Charity Ball
a reputable organization.
The Red Cross had everything to gain and
nothing to lose.
As it is, the Red Cross lost approximately
$500 last night.

not be used in publicity, profits of the Charity
Ball may still be given them. But unless they
change their policy, or unless better reasons
are given why they should not do so, we submit
there is a charity right on our own campus, the
Convalescent Home, which should get the
money. Or give it to any other charity.
In the present case, investigation by the Red
Cross would prove sponsors of the Charity Ball
a reputable organization.
The Red Cross had everything to gain and
nothing to lose.
As it is, the Red Cross lost approximately
$500 last night.
THE Red Cross has refused to accept profits
of the Charity Ball if their name or insignia
is used in publicity, on posters, or on the dance
bids unless total gross receipts are turned over
to them.
This means the orchestra could not be paid,
that no expenses could be incurred in giving
the dance, and that all services would have
to be donated.
This also means the Red Cross is letting some
$500 slip through its fingers.
It further means that Charity Ball officials
have been forced to tear down their posters,
print new ones, and eliminate the Red Cross
name from dance bids, which already have
been printed. This inconvenience, while
slight, is worth mentioning. True, perhaps
dance officials did not check with Red Cross
authorities for permission to use the name be
fore proceeding with publicity.
Reason for the Red Cross action was stated
last night to Ex Committee that were it not for
their ruling any fly-by-night outfit could throw
a party in the name of the Red Cross, reap
profits and then give them whatever profits it
felt like.
The Red Cross is an international organiza
tion which has dealt for a long time not only
with small groups but with governments of
whole nations—experience must have taught
them that their standing rule in this connection
is the best policy in the long run.
If one is to believe current Red Cross pleas
for increased donations, necessitated because
of mushrooming new needs in the nation's war,
and certainly there is every reason to believe
such, then it seems inconsistent to refuse the
offer of Stanford's Charity Ball.
We condemn this policy.
Further, we strongly recommend the Red
Cross national office change their ruling to con
form with increased need to accept donations
from organizations which they have found rep
utable upon investigation.
While the Red Cross name cannot and will
not be used in publicity, profits of the Charity
Ball may still be given them. But unless they
change their policy, or unless better reasons
are given why they should not do so, we submit
