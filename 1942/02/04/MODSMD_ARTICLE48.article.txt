AVERY substantial step forward has been
taken by one of the foremost leaders in
the field of progressive education.
Last week, President Hutchins of the Uni
versity of Chicago announced that his univer
sity would confer the Bachelor of Arts degree
at the end of the sophomore year. This plan
is the high point so far in the ardent discussion
of the place of the junior college in the educa
tional system. Progressive educators have ar
gued that junior college transfers get more out
of university life because they appreciate the
privilege of attending a full four-year institu
tion after spending one or two years in a junior
college. It has been claimed that this two-year
system is a weeding-out process of great value
for the ones that go on to university have been
thoroughly sobered by junior college in most
cases and are ready to step into university work
with confidence and ability.
What President Hutchins has in mind is this
same process of weeding out. After two years
at the University of Chicago the student will
receive his A.B. — presumably after a rather
general course aimed at giving the student a
general cultural background. Then a certain
number of the students who earn their degree,
probably not more than fifteen or twenty per
cent, will go on with their study. Competition
will be keener and educational facilities should
be used to better advantage. Hap Everett
