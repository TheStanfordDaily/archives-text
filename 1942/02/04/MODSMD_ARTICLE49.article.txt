# History, 1942
## 
### AMIE REICHERT 
Vjf/ELL, thank God we still have something to fight
about. Thank God for America and American
politics and the two-party system. Thank God for a
note of normalcy (hysteria) to balance all the Unity
and the incredibly idyllic harmony that has suffused
Washington in a rosy glow ever since things got
Unified.
All this we owe to big Democratic Boss Ed Flynn
because last night he touched off the 1942 Congres
sional election races to a flying start—accidentally.
In Flynn. You see, it all started with Pearl Harbor,
you remember her. In the midst of the rockets' red
glare and the bombs bursting in air, Ed Flynn had a
vision. He had in his mind's eye the concept of an
America festooned with unity.
So he telegraphed big G.O.P. Boss Joe Martin tell
ing him that "in the face of war, politics are ad
journed," and suggesting that the combined facilities
of the two political parties be put at the service of
the President and the national defense effort.
Joe Martin answered with assurances that the '"Re
publicans will not permit politics to enter into national
defense." Waving a 36 x 72 American flag between his
front teeth he said, "Our danger is common and we
all stand together garxblesetahrdloi zzzzzt!"
After this he removed the flag and pointed out to
Ed Flynn that the GOP would naturally continue to
preserve the right to criticize the mistakes of the Ad
ministration and point out weaknesses in the defense
effort.
i * * *
went along right smoothly until last
Monday night when Flynn suddenly blew up and
accused the Republicans of breaking faith by injecting
politics into the war effort and he charged that the
Republicans are more interested in winning control of
the House in November than of assuring an American
triumph over the Axis.
The cause of all this outburst was apparently the
fact that recent speeches by Martin had emphasized
a need for constant scrutiny of the government's poli
cies in war as well as in peace.
Now everyone is sore at poor Ed Flynn because it
appears that he really butched and he has given the
Republicans a beautiful opportunity to take advantage
of his opening the issue by launching their campaign
oratory with both barrels without being accused of
starting the politics-war melee.

JYJR. FLYNN'S blast was, to say the least, a blunder
of the first order. His remarks sound suspiciously
like a plea for a rubber-stamp Congress and every
one knows that there's a rubber shortage right now
so Poor Flynn won't get very far, and rightly so.
It's a pleasure to be able to stick up for the Repub
licans, one is able to do it so seldom (why, hello, Mr.
Hoover). Myself, I am a Roosevelt man, and so up to
now I have liked Mr. Flynn and thought he was a
pretty good guy. Maybe that's because he hasn't talked
much before this.
Anyway, today I think he is wrong, all wrong, and
the Republicans are right (not all right, mind you).
And I would go so far as to say that from here it
seems that criticism—honest constructive criticism—in
war time is not only valid but necessary, and probably
even more necessary in war time than in peace time.
England, in two and a half years of war, has not done
away with His Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and there
is no reason why in this country we should muzzle ours.

JYJR. FLYNN'S blast was, to say the least, a blunder
of the first order. His remarks sound suspiciously
like a plea for a rubber-stamp Congress and every
one knows that there's a rubber shortage right now
so Poor Flynn won't get very far, and rightly so.
It's a pleasure to be able to stick up for the Repub
licans, one is able to do it so seldom (why, hello, Mr.
Hoover). Myself, I am a Roosevelt man, and so up to
now I have liked Mr. Flynn and thought he was a
pretty good guy. Maybe that's because he hasn't talked
much before this.
Anyway, today I think he is wrong, all wrong, and
the Republicans are right (not all right, mind you).
And I would go so far as to say that from here it
seems that criticism—honest constructive criticism—in
war time is not only valid but necessary, and probably
even more necessary in war time than in peace time.
England, in two and a half years of war, has not done
away with His Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and there
is no reason why in this country we should muzzle ours.
Vjf/ELL, thank God we still have something to fight
about. Thank God for America and American
politics and the two-party system. Thank God for a
note of normalcy (hysteria) to balance all the Unity
and the incredibly idyllic harmony that has suffused
Washington in a rosy glow ever since things got
Unified.
All this we owe to big Democratic Boss Ed Flynn
because last night he touched off the 1942 Congres
sional election races to a flying start—accidentally.
In Flynn. You see, it all started with Pearl Harbor,
you remember her. In the midst of the rockets' red
glare and the bombs bursting in air, Ed Flynn had a
vision. He had in his mind's eye the concept of an
America festooned with unity.
So he telegraphed big G.O.P. Boss Joe Martin tell
ing him that "in the face of war, politics are ad
journed," and suggesting that the combined facilities
of the two political parties be put at the service of
the President and the national defense effort.
Joe Martin answered with assurances that the '"Re
publicans will not permit politics to enter into national
defense." Waving a 36 x 72 American flag between his
front teeth he said, "Our danger is common and we
all stand together garxblesetahrdloi zzzzzt!"
After this he removed the flag and pointed out to
Ed Flynn that the GOP would naturally continue to
preserve the right to criticize the mistakes of the Ad
ministration and point out weaknesses in the defense
effort.
i * * *
went along right smoothly until last
Monday night when Flynn suddenly blew up and
accused the Republicans of breaking faith by injecting
politics into the war effort and he charged that the
Republicans are more interested in winning control of
the House in November than of assuring an American
triumph over the Axis.
The cause of all this outburst was apparently the
fact that recent speeches by Martin had emphasized
a need for constant scrutiny of the government's poli
cies in war as well as in peace.
Now everyone is sore at poor Ed Flynn because it
appears that he really butched and he has given the
Republicans a beautiful opportunity to take advantage
of his opening the issue by launching their campaign
oratory with both barrels without being accused of
