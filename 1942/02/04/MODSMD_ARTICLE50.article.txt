### MIKE CHURCHILL 
THANKS A MILLION, MARCO
[yjONDAY I dropped in on the rehearsal of "Marco
Millions." It is too bad that everybody can't do
this, for rehearsals, I found, are far more interesting
than the finished shows.
I only saw a few scenes and have very little idea
what the story is about, but it is by Eugene O'Neill,
which means that it is frank and uninhibited, and
that is more important than the story anyway.
All plays have "messages" of some kind or an
other, I thought, but I couldn't find it. Perhaps it
comes in the scene after I left. Perhaps it comes next
morning by Postal Telegraph.
"Characterization" is always something vital in a
play. Through sheer force of numbers "Marco" fills
this bill. Not having a program I found it hard to
follow the leaders. The leaders in turn found it hard
to follow each other. This is a common fault of re
hearsals.
I blundered in on one scene where someone was
being carried on a stretcher up out of the orchestra
pit onto the stage. I mistook this for a practice air
raid, but was tersely told that it. was the "death
scene" and is really quite tragic.
Marco Polo occupies a prominent part in the few
scenes I saw. At the beginning he is very young and
naive. I gathered this when he was told that kings of
India have 500 wives, for he replied, "That's too damn
many." He matures rapidly, however, mostly through
the efforts of a willowy, muscle-twitching wench who
is obviously up to no good, and proves it. At any
rate, she helps Marco get a grasp on things.
In every scene I saw there were three or four
concubines, who for concubines, I thought, did dis
appointingly little. I followed one of them backstage
but she eluded me after a gay chase, and as I
couldn't find my way back to the theater I went
home. You might go to see "Marco" if only with
the hope that you can run faster than I did.

| JEAR STINKY: You're wrong. What you mistak
enly call "bomb craters" in our campus roads
are nothing more than tank traps, or in the case of
the deeper ones, anti-aircraft gun emplacements. It is
all part of the preparedness policy of Ex Committee.
Sincerely, B. Session.
