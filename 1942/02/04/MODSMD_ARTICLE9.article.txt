# Charity Ball Refused Use Of Red Cross Name
## Shores Approved As Prom Co-Chairman To Replace Breckner 
### 
That the Red Cross has refused to
accept profits of Stanford's Charity
Ball, Feb. 13, because they would
not permit use of their name and in
signia in publicity, on posters, or
on the dance bids unless total gross
receipts from the dance were given
them, was learned by Ex Committee
last night.
(See page 4 for editorial com
ment.)
The dance will still be known as
the Charity Ball, however. Disposal
of the money to some worthy char
ity will be determined later, it was
decided.
While the Red Cross would have
netted about $500, it was explained
the action in refusing the use of
their name or insignia was dictated
by a standing policy. Accordingly,
all posters mentioning the Red Cross
have been torn down and the Red
Cross name will be blacked out on
| the bids.

with answers to the problem of pre

committee to study the Honor Code

for infractions, suggesting expulsion
from school, and said, "We cannot
deny there are too many violations
of the Honor Code." Other business
