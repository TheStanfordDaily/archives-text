# Allies Lash Back at Japs On All Fronts as Wavell Promises 'Great' Help
## Nippon Still Holds Initiative On All Fronts with Shorter Lines For Communications and Supplies 
### United Press 
The United Nations lashed hack savagely yesterday at Japanese hordes
besieging Singapore and driving toward Java, Australia and Burma, and
Gen. Sir Archibald P. Wavell promised his outnumhered defenders that
great reinforcements arc en route and implied that the tide of battle soon
may turn.
However, the Japanese still held the initiative on all fronts, were oper-

ating on far shorter communications
lines than those of the United Na
tions, and were showing an ability to
take as well as to give severe pun
ishment.

1. Gen. Wavell, supreme com
mander of the Allied forces in the
Southwest Pacific, sent an order of
the day to the defenders of Singa
pore Island assuring them that help
is en route and urging stonewall
resistance.

tered the 35th day of the bloody
battle of Bataan Peninsula by re

3. At Singapore high-flying Japa
nese planes again came over in day
light to rain incendiary and demo
lition bombs on the flat, humid island
fortress but British, Indian and Aus
tralian troops held firm and replied
with torrents of artillery fire which
apparently shattered the enemy's
communications lines and prevented
the Japanese from massing troops
on the narrow tip of southern Ma
laya for an assault on the British
stronghold.

American and British fliers blasted
another Japanese effort to cross the
Salween River in the Nipponese
drive toward the Rangoon-Lashio

air base in Java, and its environs
had been shot down. The sinking of
more Japanese ships in the battle of
the strategic Macassar Strait also
was reported.

their partly-occupied country.
The United Nations lashed hack savagely yesterday at Japanese hordes
besieging Singapore and driving toward Java, Australia and Burma, and
Gen. Sir Archibald P. Wavell promised his outnumhered defenders that
great reinforcements arc en route and implied that the tide of battle soon
may turn.
However, the Japanese still held the initiative on all fronts, were oper-

ating on far shorter communications
lines than those of the United Na
tions, and were showing an ability to
take as well as to give severe pun
ishment.

1. Gen. Wavell, supreme com
mander of the Allied forces in the

3. At Singapore high-flying Japa
nese planes again came over in day
light to rain incendiary and demo
lition bombs on the flat, humid island

laya for an assault on the British
stronghold.
4. On the Burma Road sleepless
American and British fliers blasted
another Japanese effort to cross the
Salween River in the Nipponese
