# Annapolis of the West?

{An Editorial)
STANFORD wants to know whether it is to become the "An
napolis of the West."
Will Stanford be taken over by the Navy to train its flying
cadets?
Will they move in on the whole University, will they take
over the athletic facilities, the dormitories, the fraternity and
sorority houses, the classrooms?

What will become of the students enrolled now if anywhere
from 2,000 to 7,500 Navy men move in by May 1?
These questions and all sorts of rumors have excited the
campus in the past few days, and that is because no definite
announcement has been made by the Navy. University adminis
trators have told us everything they know to date, that the Navy
has been on the campus investigating possibilities of using ex
isting equipment, that no decision has been announced, and that
a Stanford representative has flown to Washington to confer with
Naval officers.
This is the situation at present, and it is substantiated by
official announcements.

Student excitement probably has been caused by a good deal
of speculation in the press, paiiiculd ly in a story in yesterday's
sports section of a San Francisco newspaper.
What decision has been reached at this time or will be made
in the future is not known publicly.
However, it seems incongruous that students need fear the
University will be taken over completely and that they will be
asked to leave.

Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur said yesterday, "We will serve
the best interests of the government and of the University."
Because America is at war it is mandatory that the country's
universities train doctors, dentists, chemists, technicians of all
sorts, and provide facilities for all-important research. It is supe
rior equipment which is deciding the victory in favor of American
forces at Macassar Straits this week.
Further, Stanford has established innumerable classes in ci
vilian training for war, and it has the student Reserve Officers'
Training Corps.
These are the things which we are doing to serve the best
interests of the government and the University. Not 10,000 men
are worth a better gunsight that will place a bomb or a shell more
accurately.

Instead of becoming flustered by each passing rumor, why
not keep our heads, sit tight, and wait and see what happens?
We can be pretty sure Stanford will not be taken over com
pletely and that we will not be asked to leave only if we continue
to train the necessary doctors and engineers and to demonstrate
research progress, as we have done so excellently to date. In
this way we are doing a necessary and patriotic service.
But we will be pretty safe in thinking we will lose Stanford
to the Navy if we do not face the facts. This is probably the best
reason why there could be no Tommy Dorsey, why there can
be no big-name bands. The minute we become a country club
a nation at war has every right to move in and make better use
of our facilities.
What Dr. Wilbur said after the Pearl Harbor attack applies also
to "losing our heads":
"This is reality. We are right up against the guns."
That means only level-headed thinking will win the war.
Right now we are losing it.

are worth a better gunsight that will place a bomb or a shell more
accurately.

Instead of becoming flustered by each passing rumor, why
not keep our heads, sit tight, and wait and see what happens?
We can be pretty sure Stanford will not be taken over com
pletely and that we will not be asked to leave only if we continue
to train the necessary doctors and engineers and to demonstrate
research progress, as we have done so excellently to date. In
this way we are doing a necessary and patriotic service.
But we will be pretty safe in thinking we will lose Stanford
to the Navy if we do not face the facts. This is probably the best
reason why there could be no Tommy Dorsey, why there can
be no big-name bands. The minute we become a country club
a nation at war has every right to move in and make better use
of our facilities.
What Dr. Wilbur said after the Pearl Harbor attack applies also
to "losing our heads":
"This is reality. We are right up against the guns."
That means only level-headed thinking will win the war.
Right now we are losing it.

STANFORD wants to know whether it is to become the "An
napolis of the West."
Will Stanford be taken over by the Navy to train its flying
cadets?
Will they move in on the whole University, will they take
over the athletic facilities, the dormitories, the fraternity and
sorority houses, the classrooms?

What will become of the students enrolled now if anywhere
from 2,000 to 7,500 Navy men move in by May 1?
These questions and all sorts of rumors have excited the
campus in the past few days, and that is because no definite
announcement has been made by the Navy. University adminis
trators have told us everything they know to date, that the Navy
has been on the campus investigating possibilities of using ex
isting equipment, that no decision has been announced, and that
a Stanford representative has flown to Washington to confer with
Naval officers.
This is the situation at present, and it is substantiated by
official announcements.

Student excitement probably has been caused by a good deal
of speculation in the press, paiiiculd ly in a story in yesterday's
sports section of a San Francisco newspaper.
What decision has been reached at this time or will be made
in the future is not known publicly.
However, it seems incongruous that students need fear the
University will be taken over completely and that they will be
asked to leave.

Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur said yesterday, "We will serve
the best interests of the government and of the University."
Because America is at war it is mandatory that the country's
universities train doctors, dentists, chemists, technicians of all
sorts, and provide facilities for all-important research. It is supe
rior equipment which is deciding the victory in favor of American
forces at Macassar Straits this week.
Further, Stanford has established innumerable classes in ci
vilian training for war, and it has the student Reserve Officers'
Training Corps.
These are the things which we are doing to serve the best
interests of the government and the University. Not 10,000 men
are worth a better gunsight that will place a bomb or a shell more
accurately.

Instead of becoming flustered by each passing rumor, why
not keep our heads, sit tight, and wait and see what happens?
