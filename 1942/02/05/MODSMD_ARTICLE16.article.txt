# Walker Flies East To Meet Navy
## Decision Is Washington's,' Says Wilbur; Farm Waits Amount of Space, Facilities Which Navy May Need Are Still Unknown 
### 
Chancellor Kay Lyman Wilbur announced yesterday
in an exclusive interview to The Daily, that Frank Fish
Walker, financial vice-president of the University, flew to
Washington, D.C., Tuesday afternoon and is conferring with
United States Naval officials on the possibility that Stanford
facilities may be used in part or in whole as a primary flight
training base for the Naval Air Corps.
"The situation is already in the hands of Washington,"
said Dr .Wilbur, "and we assume the Navy has concluded its
investigation here on the campus."
Dr. Wilbur revealed earlier in the week an investigation
by Naval officers of Stanford facilities had been carried on
for approximately one week.
"If there is any contracting with the government, he will
be the man to do it," Dr. Wilbur said in referring to Mr.
Walker.
RETURN UNKNOWN
Asked how long Mr. Walker would be in Washington and
when he would return, Dr. Wilbur said, "I haven't any idea."
Mr. Walker's secretary said yesterday that before he left he
expected to be gone about 10 days.
"We want to see the University and its whole resources
used in the most satisfactory way," continued Dr. Wilbur.
Meanwhile, students should wait and see what develops. Wo

hope to serve the best interests of
the government and of the Univer
sity."
Dr. Wilbur said he could not com
ment on what the Navy's program
would include, nor on the extent to
which the campus would be asked to
co-operate with the Navy in grant
ing use of grounds, dormitories,
classrooms, athletic equipment or
other facilities.
Apparently the announcement on
whether Stanford will be used by
the Navy will be released in Wash
ington in a Naval recommendation or
statement.
UNOFFICIAL REPORTS
Rumors that Stanford's athletic
plant and possibly the entire Uni
versity would be taken over grew
out of unofficial reports from Wash
ington earlier in the week that Stan
ford is one of four university sites
chosen for the training of 30,(>00
pilots annually.
Other universities mentioned in
Washington wire service reports
were Notre Dame, Cornell and Geor
gia. These reports quoted no au
thority or source of information ay
making these statements, but said
"it was learned."
TO BEGIN MAY I
The new Navy air training bases
would presumably be in operation
by May 1, and it was also rumored
that St. Mary's was being considered
as a possible location.
In the event the Navy moved in,
the extent to which facilities would
be required would probably be de
termined by the number of men sta
tioned here.
Dr. Wilbur pointed out yesterday
that during the last war Stanford
students were permitted to continue
university training while taking in
struction in the Student Army Train
ing Corps and the Naval Training
Corps. Other than the present R. 0.-
T.C., no other training possibilities
for students already enrolled have
been mentioned.
