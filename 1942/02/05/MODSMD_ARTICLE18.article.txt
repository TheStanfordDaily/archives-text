# Curfews, Travel Limits Ordered for Axis Aliens
## Prohibited Areas Established; To Be Evacuated in Three Weeks 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 4 (UP). —'B'lm* federal government, aiming to
intercept any possible fifth column activities before it is too late, today set
up a restricted /one in California in which enemy alien* will he subject to
curfew and to limitation on traveling.
The zone, designated Restricted Area No. I, runs .10 to 150 miles inland

from the Oregon border to latitude
35, the general vicinity of the south
ern boundary of Sun Luis Obispo
County. Its western boundary i.s the
ocean.
STARTS FEB. 24
Alter Feb. 24 all enemy aliens
Japanese, Germans, Italians—resid
ing within the area must remain
within their own homes between 9
p.m. and 6 a.m., and at all other
times ihey must be either at the
places of employment designated by !
their registration certificates, or en
route to work or home, or not more !
than five miles from their place of j
residence.
Within the area, however, are
many sections from which Axis al
iens are absolutely barred. These
latter, "prohibited zones," now num
being 8G and expected to be aug
mented shortly, are adjacent to de- .
fen.se installations, power plants and ;
lines, radio stations, reservoirs, dams j
and other strategical spots.

Aliens are banned entirely from
the prohibited zones. If they live
within such boundaries, they must
move out—some by Feb. 15, others
by Feb. 24, dependent on the zone—
and must close any businesses or
cease any employment within the
zone. Federal agencies said estab
lishment of farm colonies, at as yet
undesignated places but far removed
from the coast, was being considered
to care for those forced to move and
unable to find residence in per
mitted territory.
