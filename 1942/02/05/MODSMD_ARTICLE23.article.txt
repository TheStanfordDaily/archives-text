# Mullany Ends 2:30 Menace
## 
### 
Chairman Mullany has spoken and
Daylight. Saving has been mastered.
To cope with the vicious late leave
problem created when clocks all
over the country are moved up an
hour at 11 p.m. on Sunday night,
Women's Council has evolved an in
genious plan to prevent Stanford
women from losing an hour of their
late leaves.
All women's living groups on the
campus are asked not to change
their clocks until 2:30, so that they
will operate under the old time
system on their late leaves that
night. That's all there is to it,
Lomie says, but she adds this warn
ing: "Don't let anyone touch the
house clock until 2:30."
