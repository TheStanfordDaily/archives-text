the emphatic point made by Miss
Mary Tornich, the only woman navi
gation instructor in the U.S. Army
Corps, at Women's Vocom meeting
last night.
"A woman's greatest problem in
securing positions as navigation in
structors is obtaining the practical
experience required," she added.
Miss Tornich went to King City to
teach navigation at the invitation of
the Army Air Corps last March.
Previously she taught for the Civil
ian Training Program at the Uni
versity of California.
Actual flying jobs for women are
few and practically non-existent at
the present time because of the ban
on civilian flying. Miss Tornich ex
plained that because the Army's fu
ture attitude toward women pilots is
uncertain there are possibilities that
women may be flying more. Jobs
may be ferrying ships, she sug
gested.
"The best opportunities for women
in the technical positions are in the
fields of meteorology, aerodynamics,
and navigation, or their associated
sciences," she concluded.
Non-technical positions are open
to women in all branches of service
and personnel work with the air
lines, stressed Miss Mary E. Thur
ston, of United Air Lines traffic de
partment in San Francisco.

its reservation department, and that
today its staff consists of 30.
As registered nurses are needed
more in hospitals and emergency
work, the air lines have lifted the
requirement that the stewardesses be
registered nurses. This factor will
enable more women to enter this
field of aviation than ever before,
according to Miss Thurston.
