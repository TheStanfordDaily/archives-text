Two Stanford men, both of whom
represented the National Broadcast
ing Company, had the luck, or lack
of it, to be caught in war zones when
the United States went to war with
the Axis Dec. 8-9.
Bert 11. Silen, K.A. '22, made ra
dio history Dec. 8 when he broadcast
from Manila an eye-witness account
of the Japs' first bombing of that
city. Standing on a roof of one of
the city's buildings, Silrn described
to his American audience the glare
of burning buildings, the roar of

bomb bursts interspersed by the 1
sharp bursts of machine guns and
anti-aircraft cannon, and even de- !
scribed the tactics of the Jap planes
in bombing their objectives.
Another Stanford graduate who
was serving as an NBC war corre
spondent When the war broke out
was Alex M. Drier, S.A.E. '38, who j
was one of the last American cor- j
respondents to broadcast from Ger
many. A little while before the out
break of war, Drier and the CBS
correspondent got. together and
"struck," refusing to broadcast unless
Nazi censorship restrictions were I
revised. Their efforts were rewarded \
the next day by a decree from Jo- I
seph Paul Goebbels' Propaganda 5
Ministry, banning them from the
air.
The present whereabouts of both '
Silen and Drier is uncertain. Silen i
was probably able to escape Manila
with General McArthur's forces!
when they abandoned the city, al
though nothing definite has been
learned here about him. Whether
Drier was able to escape Germany
before the war is more doubtful.
The head of the American Supply
Mission to Moscow is Brig. Gen.
P. R. Faymonville, Stanford '09.
Ensign Wayne Laird, El Capitan
'42, is now stationed at Corpus \
Christi, Tex.

Several organizations have sent
in complete lists of the present lo
cations of their graduates who are
in the armed forces. The Daily
thanks these organizations, and
urges others lo do the same. Each
list cannot he run as a whole, hut
items from it will he used from
! day to day as spare requires.
The Daily also wishes to thank
the Stewart Howe Ahimni Service
for its extensive contributions to
i this column.
