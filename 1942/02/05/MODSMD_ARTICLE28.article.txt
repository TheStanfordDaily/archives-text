ment program. Navy regulations

HARD HITTERS
Bear Coach Eddie Nemir has sev
eral powerful punchers who have
seen lots of experience. Among
Ihem is Captain Milt Cunha, Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate champion in
the 165-pound class. Cunha is fast
and aggressive, and will probably
force the fighting. Stanford's repre
sentative in this division will be Jim
Thurmond, a letterman from last
year.
Cal's Jack Thornbum, runner-up
to John Ward in the Pacific Coast
Championships last year, is another
seasoned veteran in intercollegiate
boxing. Pitted against him will be
either Bob McNeil or Don Grant.
STANFORD FAVORED
In the two weight classes that find
Ihe foe from Berkeley without any
veterans are the 155-pound and 145-
pound divisions. Stanford will be
favorite in these two classes. Frank

Q. Hewitt is a solid favorite against
novice Bill Eastin of Berkeley.
Coach Clayton Frye is having
trouble deciding who to send into
the ring against Seymour Lewis, the
Cal contender in the 155-pound
class. Frye has been pleased with
the showing of A1 Smith and Henry
Claflin within the last week. Ira
Fishman is also a possibility.
Nemir m;iy substitute Roy Shaw
in the 135-pound class in place of
veteran Dick Wilson, Hyland Hebert
will fight for Stanford. In the 127-
pound div ion it is a toss-up be
twen Johi H irtman and Vic Wol
cott. Ew id Larson, another Cal
veteran, w 1 start against either one
of these boys.
