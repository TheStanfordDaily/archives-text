## 
### 
With some five team members
listed as doubtful quantities, Stan
ford's varsity swimming team faces
the San Jose State mermen tonight
at 8 in the Spartan plunge.
At full strength the Indians are
shaky favorites over the up-and
coming Staters, but their present
condition makes them even money
at best. San Jose State is strong in
the sprints, backstroke, and diving.
Stanford has no entries in the diving.
Doc Colyear's knee makes him a
doubtful entry in the medley relay,
while Scott Dudley is a doubtful
starter in the breast stroke. Co
captain Colyear can swim only if he
gets his doctor's permission to do so.
Todd Gardner, backstroker, and
Bill Mapel, sprint swimmer, who
both went out with colds last week,
are in doubtful shape, while Ted
Munroe, distance ace, came down
with a sore throat yesterday. This
leaves only Brad Young. Rey Rule,
Co-Captain Don Smith, Franz Geh
rels, and Bob Regnolds to lead the
Stanford attack.
