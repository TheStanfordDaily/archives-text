# Farm Cagers, Trojans Open Crucial Conference Battles
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Can the Stanford Skyscrapers he stopped?
Replete with the Ormsbys, Omalevs, Gossards. Liibers, Bergs, et al, the
Trojans will make a strong bid for the Southern Division title. A split
in the series will keep the Indians on top by one game, a double victory
will put 'em on the head end by a big margin.

â€ž Whether the Redskin three-game
win streak can be clipped is o.nly a
guess. Never a season goes by that
Sam Barry doesn't come up with a
couple of seasoned players and a
few newbloods thrown in for good
measure.
SEASONED TEAM
This time Barry has the seasoned
veteran type, and plenty well-sea
soned at that. Johnny Luber, Len
Berg, Ted Gossard, Bob Ormsby
have been roosting at the Troy camp
for two years, and Omalev, "discov
ered" midway through the season
last year, is fast becoming one of
the Barry steadymen.
The Trojans are still in the South
ern Division fight and Stanford's
one-game lead is awfully slim at
this point. Tomorrow's and Satur
day's games will probably go a long
way in proving the eventual win
ner of the southern loop.
BEARS VS. BRUINS
While Southern Cal and Stanford
mee there, the Bears and U.C.L.A.
will be settling things in Los An
geles.
This will be the first time Coach
Everett Dean's quintet has been up
against a club seasoned by a suc
cessful eastern invasion, where it
played some of the best teams in
the nation. And the Trojans' of
fensive will be much like the Red
skins' own speedy work-the-ball-in
type of play.
