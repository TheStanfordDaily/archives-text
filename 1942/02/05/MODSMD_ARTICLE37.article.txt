JF WE are to believe the San Fran
cisco papers, practically every
person in school now might as well
pick out someplace else to go next
year, since the Senator's Farm is to
be a haven for undertrained flyers
from now on. I think I'll matricu
late at Berkeley next year. Surely
the government wouldn't want that
campus unless it was as a last re
sort.

'HARLIE BULOTTI would like to
J announce thai in Tuesday night's
intramural games the Sigma Nu II
team was beaten 70 to 0 by the
Kappa Alphas or the Phi Sigs or
something like that. I'm not quite
sure what team he did say won, but
anyway they did it quite impres
sively, whoever it was.
While on the subject of the in
tramural basketball games, let it
be known that there are 54 teams
competing in the 10 leagues this
winter, biggest turnout they have
had for intromural sports. A short
while ago the city papers were
bragging about the 60 intramural
teams in all of San Francisco.
The Phi Psis, with Tiff"Denton and
Ed DeMoss looking like profes
sionals, seem to have the classiest
team in any of the circuits, but
they will have to do a lot of win
ning to prove it.
* * *
your eye on a dark-haired,
stooped-over Russian during this
coming week-end's basketball games
with Southern California. He is
Alex Omalev, pronounced o-mal-ev,
Trojan forward. Last year when
Elevator Sam Barry was jumping up
less since than usual due to his
team's bad slump, Omalev, pro
nounced oma-lev, came up from the
scrubs to save several games for the
Southern Californians by sinking
long shots in the closing minutes of
several games. He was immediately
promoted to the first string and did
right well for the rest of the season.
Up to last week, however, Alex
—you probably know bow to pro
nounce that—has been in a slump
th is season. When he isn't doing a
lot of scoring for the team, he
isn't too valuable since he is only
5-10. Barry was just about to
relegate A! to the second string in
favor of Jim SeminofT. a much
taller man, when the Russian went
wild last week-end, scoring 16
points against U.S.F. and out-fast
breaking the Dons' fast break.
Now Sam has a difficult decision to
make. If he puts SeminofT in at for
ward, he will have in SeminofT, Len
Berg, and Bob Ormsby, three boys
averaging G feet 3 inches who might
have a chance of getting a few balls
off the backboards against the tall
Indians. But SeminofT isn't a very
high scorer and if Alexis hot it wiil
be a waste of points. Of course the
shorter Omalev—l'm not sure how
you pronounce his name—might
never get his hands on the ball if and
when he gets in the game.
What will Sam do? What would
you do? Come around Friday
night and find the answer to this
momentous question? Another
question I will be waiting with
baited breath to have answered
Friday night is whether or not
Berg's hair has receded any fur
ther. He was almost bald in his
sophomore year in high school.
Last year his forehead was 6 :! i

J announce thai in Tuesday night's
intramural games the Sigma Nu II
team was beaten 70 to 0 by the
Kappa Alphas or the Phi Sigs or
something like that. I'm not quite
sure what team he did say won, but
anyway they did it quite impres
sively, whoever it was.
While on the subject of the in
tramural basketball games, let it
be known that there are 54 teams
competing in the 10 leagues this
winter, biggest turnout they have
had for intromural sports. A short
while ago the city papers were
bragging about the 60 intramural
teams in all of San Francisco.
The Phi Psis, with Tiff"Denton and
Ed DeMoss looking like profes
sionals, seem to have the classiest
team in any of the circuits, but
they will have to do a lot of win
ning to prove it.
* * *
your eye on a dark-haired,
stooped-over Russian during this
coming week-end's basketball games
with Southern California. He is
Alex Omalev, pronounced o-mal-ev,
Trojan forward. Last year when
Elevator Sam Barry was jumping up
less since than usual due to his
team's bad slump, Omalev, pro
nounced oma-lev, came up from the
scrubs to save several games for the
Southern Californians by sinking
long shots in the closing minutes of
several games. He was immediately
promoted to the first string and did
right well for the rest of the season.
Up to last week, however, Alex
—you probably know bow to pro
nounce that—has been in a slump
th is season. When he isn't doing a
lot of scoring for the team, he
isn't too valuable since he is only
5-10. Barry was just about to
relegate A! to the second string in
favor of Jim SeminofT. a much
taller man, when the Russian went
wild last week-end, scoring 16
points against U.S.F. and out-fast
breaking the Dons' fast break.
Now Sam has a difficult decision to
make. If he puts SeminofT in at for
ward, he will have in SeminofT, Len
Berg, and Bob Ormsby, three boys
averaging G feet 3 inches who might
have a chance of getting a few balls
off the backboards against the tall
Indians. But SeminofT isn't a very
high scorer and if Alexis hot it wiil
be a waste of points. Of course the
shorter Omalev—l'm not sure how
you pronounce his name—might
never get his hands on the ball if and
when he gets in the game.
What will Sam do? What would
you do? Come around Friday
night and find the answer to this
momentous question? Another
question I will be waiting with
baited breath to have answered
Friday night is whether or not
Berg's hair has receded any fur
ther. He was almost bald in his
sophomore year in high school.
Last year his forehead was 6 :! i
JF WE are to believe the San Fran
cisco papers, practically every
person in school now might as well
pick out someplace else to go next
year, since the Senator's Farm is to
be a haven for undertrained flyers
from now on. I think I'll matricu
late at Berkeley next year. Surely
the government wouldn't want that
campus unless it was as a last re
sort.
