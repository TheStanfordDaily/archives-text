# Indian Golfers Look Strong
## 
### 
Although the greens are sopping j
and the fifteenth fairway looks like .
a quagmire, both varsity and fresh
man golfers have been faithfully 1
practicing since the opening of j
school. It looks like another season j
of "T" success for varsity linksmen i
despite the loss of such great players
as Warren Berl, Dee Repogle, Gor
don Hough, and Don Hazlett from
last year's team which captured the
Intercollegiate championship.
"Bud" Brownell, number one
player last season, is back and ap- 1
parently on his "stick." Others who
are playing well at the present are
Frank McCann, Sandy Tatum,
George Traphagen. Dave Doud. Jim
Haugh, Irv Hellman, and Pete
Jones.
