# Frosh Practice Nears Peak As Lowell Struggle Looms
## 
### 
Freshman basketball practice reached its hottest pet t's of the season
last night as Coach Phil Bengtson pushes his squad tÂ« uard the Friday
night tangle with the Lowell High School Indians.
It's an "off the dime" campaign for a frosli team tTiat must start its
winning streak all over again after an unfortunate incident against Paly

High last Friday. With five wins,
and two losses their record thus far,
I the Papeese can drop no more tilts
! if they wish to equal the record of
j frosh quints for the last two years,
j And that includes the series with
the Cal frosh!
These rivalries with the Berkeley
organisms were responsible for one
loss each in the preceding two sea
sons. The little Cards have lost their
margin and have every bit of pres
sure possible against them.
SEAMS CAULKED
From the looks of practice last
night, perhaps the .seams have been
caulked with some good funda
mental drill. The boys will be play
ing farther down the court Friday
night, picking up the opposing
guards well into the opposition's half
of the court. Theory is to avoid sev
eral unfortunate incidents of long
shooting, etc., that have occurred.
Five men are the big guns that
Bengtson will have to use, and they

| are the same fv; e men that have
been his cogs aIJ season. Thus far
none of the pi.vtty-good-but-still
| small reserve m aterial has been able
to bomb the qrtfntet of Barsocehini,
I Parsons, Heald. Brown, and Hall
| from their firstz-string berths.
Reserves th:jt will be capable of
1 handling the t,tiH Lowells Friday in
! elude HerricJc, Porter, Hartwcll,
Hagopian, andj others. The Stanfords
probably mai.ch the prepsters in
height, and on basis of comparative
scores again} t Galileo, the match
should be fai'.iy even.
Saturday, -the freshmen taper off
against Morrterey High. I t may be
a pretty shnrp taper at that. The
Monterey team isn't the caliber of
Norm Kee'/er and Co. from Palo
Alto High (incidentally the tall
frosh-fixed is now leading the scor
ing in llie Peninsula Athletic-
League) butt they produce habitually
better-than.-average aggregations.
