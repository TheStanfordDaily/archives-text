FRATERNITY pledging tomorrow will not be
followed by the customary pledge prom as
it has before. This is because apparently no
suitable place could be iound to have the dance.
Conseguently, Interfraternity Council passed
a resolution suggesting all houses have a house
dance, open house or some type of function in
their own chapter houses on the campus.
What are the 24 fraternities planning, then, for
tomorrow night?
Yesterday The Daily asked what each house
will do, and their answers are printed on page
I. Many have definite dinners, open houses
and dances planned. Others have different
ideas.
One house is "undecided," another will go
to the game after dinner, another will "just
bum around," one will have what they term a
"fireside," another will have a pledge dinner
but no dates and no open house, yet another
will have no dinner, no dates, and no open
house, and another will be "cruising around."
What each house wants to do is its own busi
ness. It is pretty definite that at least three
houses will go off campus for parties. That
too is probably their business, yet it would be
fun to have their parties at home, and perhaps
it wouldn't be asking too much if they were to
welcome visitors to look over their pledges.
This seems more sensible this particular war
year than going off campus, to the city, or "just
bumming around." It's not too late to make the
simple preparations necessary.
Order the refreshments, put some records on,
and roll up the rugs.
