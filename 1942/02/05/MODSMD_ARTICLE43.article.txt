# Preference Dinner
## 
### 
TONIGHT'S the night when every fraternity
on the campus has its pledges and pledges
to-be up for the last dinner before formal pledg
ing. There have been many changes made in
the classes; there will probably be several
changes made tonight.
Pledging a fraternity is one of the biggest
steps a college man takes. His connections
with the fraternity will last throughout his
life, and his decision calls for a lot of clear
headed thinking.
Now that the decisions are practically final
and it's all over but for the signing of that little
card tomorrow afternoon, he should remem
ber one thing. Contact between fraternity men
and freshmen is strictly illegal from 8 o'clock to
night until the card has been signed. Freshmen
should not let anonymous phone calls or con
versations influence them; it's happened before
with regrettable results.â€”John Horrall

dime and play at week-end basketball games
in the Pavilion?
