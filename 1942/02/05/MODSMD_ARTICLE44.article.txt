# Winter Lethargy
## 
### 
ONE of the most noticeable and regrettable
evils of Stanford's system of student gov
ernment —ranking perhaps next to the caucus
system—is the apathy shown by the student
body in the winter quarter elections.
There are, of course, reasons for this. Ob
viously, the lack of "big name" candidates run
ning for the top student offices keeps many
students away from the polls. Also, the campus
political organizations have never recognized
the winter elections as worthy of much effort
on their part, and those students who vote only
under partisan pressure are eliminated also.
Next Monday, however, positions in Stan
ford's three most important student organiza
tions Ex Committee, Men's Council and Wom
en's Council—will be filled at a general elec
tion. As in all democratic organizations, it is
these representative bodies rather than any
one or two individuals who are the Farm's real
student government.
The elections, incidentally, will be the first
to be held under the new condensed election
system adopted last fall by Ex Committee.
As in the past, The Daily will consider it its
duty to place news of the impending election
increasingly even if repetitiously before the
students, in the hope of continuing the increase
of voters in winter elections that has been no
ticeable the last two years. Vic Minahan
