### AMIE REICHERT 
r T'HE United Press reports are full of what they call
"good news" today, and what they have been call
ing "good news" ever since the day after Pearl Harbor.
The news isn't good, hasn't been good since we
entered this war, and it's not only unfair to the Amer
ican people but also unwise to go along in this state
of forced optimism and blind confidence that every
thing is perfectly all right.
We are one of the first to criticize the British for
their unfailing policy of turning defeats into victories
with the ease that you turn a reversible raincoat from
the waterproof to the woolen side. We put our tongues
in our cheeks and winked knowingly when the Brit
ish called Dunkirk a victory, when they called Crete
a victory, simply because they were ingenious enough
and lucky enough to pull out the majority of their
men although they had to leave their equipment and
the land they were defending to the Nazis.

'T'ODAY in this country our propagandists, our
newspapers, editorial writers, news agencies, ra
dio commentators, are doing the same thing. It is a
dishonest and a dangerous policy.
It stems from one of two possible assumptions:
either they think the American people aren't strong
enough to take the bad news, that our morale would
give; or else they have completely lost their sense of
perspective, so that when Douglas Mac Arthur and his
band of valiant soldiers fight for 35 days with their
backs to the wall in an heroic and pathetic attempt to
stave off one Japanese offensive after another, they
call it "good news" because the enemy hasn't broken
through.
When Japanese planes apparently have such com
plete mastery of the air over Singapore that they bomb
the city in daylight, heaving thousands of incendiary
and demolition bombs upon it, they call it "good
news" because British anti-aircraft made some blue
puffs in the skies and brought down one or two
planes.
When exhausted British and American flyers, who
have been going at a 24-hour-a-day pace for weeks
now, manage to fight off still another Japanese attempt
to slice through the Burma Road, they call it "good
news."

W/"ELL, it's good, but only relatively. And it's not
good enough to give the nation the feeling that
everything is running smoothly, that we're winning
and it'll all be over any minute now.
And that is exactly what seems to be happening.
Newspapers and propagandists and radio commenta
tors will tell you about all these defensive victories â€”
but they forget to emphasize and re-emphasize that
they are defensive and only the very first, smallest
steps in the game today.
They forget to emphasize and re-emphasize the fact
that on every front the Japanese are still taking the
initiative, that they are working from far shorter
supply lines than we are, that they have superiority in
man power and in air power.
Let's remember all these things, not to be defeat
ist by any means, but to remind ourselves that we can
not afford to be smug and secure just because Mac-
Arthur is the gallant lion-hearted general that he is,
and because the man who wires U.P. releases wears
rose-colored glasses.
