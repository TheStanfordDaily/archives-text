### MIKE CHURCHILL 
THE RATIO—BOOM!
MORE terrifying to the Stanford Man than any Japa
nese invasion is the news that Stanford may be
come a training center for Naval Air Cadets.
The women, on the other hand, having suffered a
hideous disappointment last quarter when the army
hastily wtihdrew its contingent of soldiers from the
campus after the briefest stay, feel that life once
more has a purpose.
There is a possibility that on or before May 1 men,
hundreds, maybe thousands of them, resplendent in
blue, serge and brass buttons, will be roaming this
campus of ours. Conditioned by strenuous physical
training, bronzed by the elements, these men are going
to take no back seat in the social whirl that is Stan
ford's.
Preparedness is the catchword with Row and Hall.
Lagunita last night announced that it may postpone
its formal until "sometime in May." Already three
sororities have erected large U.S.O. signs and the
Chi O's are feverishly putting together a CADETS
WELCOME-FREE COFFEE sign.

|>ALO ALTO shops report that they have already
felt the shock. Roos Bros, say that, within an
hour of the announcement, they were entirely sold out
of sweaters, the Pi Phis buying by far the largest
amount. J. Magnin has already begun rationing play
suits—three to a girl.
Hank Wallace, new Pan Hellenic prexy, had only
time to shout, "Oh, joy and glory, keep 'em flying,"
as she tried hastily to summon a Pan Hel meeting to
discuss plans to welcome the midshipmen. Jean Now
ell, women's editor, said, "The Daily will continue its
policy of publishing all the news that's fit to print."
Women's Council, last stronghold of Stanford fem
ininity, when finally reached, said distractedly, "Stan
ford women will never become femmes de guerre,"
and hung up.
To the men of the Navy I can only say, in the
words of Goodman and Green: "An axiom often mis
understood is 'the Stanford girl of today is the mother
of tomorrow.' It is well to remember that this is a
maxim and not a challenge."
