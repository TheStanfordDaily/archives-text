# CAMPUS OPINION
## CO-OPERATIONâ€”PLEASE! 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Through this letter I wish to cull the attention of
the Cellar managers to the fact that salt and pepper
shakers are still out on the counter. I feel sure this is
due solely to someone's oversight and that the situa
tion will be taken care of soon. Gad. when it comes
to the point where you have to beg the waitress for
a spoonful of sugar, it's almost better to starve. At
least you have your pride.
Is there any reason why "our cellar" should be run
less efficiently than any hash house in Paly? In spite
of defense priorities they still hand out napkins, serve
milk in glasses, and put the sugar out for the customers.
Because of a virtual campus monopoly on food and
fountain service must the Cellar take it out on us?
The situation rankles any democratic American, but
what can a body do when he gets those mid-afternoon
hunger cramps? He has to tolerate these things in
stoical silence.
Does it really make much difference whether we
drink our milk from a glass bottle or from a glass
glass? The only way they save sugar under the new
system is with people who want it but arc afraid to
ask for it. As for the paper napkin situation; I have
nothing to say. It leaves me speechless.
