# Women's Clubhouse Selected As Fraternity Pledging Site
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Pledging (his year will be held in the Women's Clubhouse tomorrow
afternoon from 2 to 4:."10, announced Jim llaugh, Interfratcrnity president,
yesterday. This was the third change of location for formal pledging.
Originally scheduled for Kncina, it was shifted from there to Toyon
to avoid the "bad psychological effect" on those not pledging and also to

avoid the riot there of two years ago..
Reversing an earlier decision of ac
ceptance, the Toyon cabinet, acting
Tuesday night on the recommenda
tion of the Interclub Council, denied
use of the hall.
To speed up pledging, pledges
will go through in two lines, split
alphabetically. In charge of actual
pledging is Mr. Warren M. Turner,
Interfraternity auditor, while Ralph
Thompson, head Encina sponsor,
will have a group of men on hand
to see that pledging is done in an
orderly manner.
Leading up to pledging Friday arc
preference dinners from 5:30 to 8
o'clock tonight, followed by a strict
period of silencc from 8 p.m. after
dinner to pledging time on Friday.
"No contact whatsoever between
fraternity men and rushees is al
lowed in the period of silence fol
lowing preference dinners," Haugh
stated. "Pledging of houses contact
ing freshmen in this period will be
in jeopardy."
NO CONTACT
Rushing chairmen are asked to
have the names of all men they
wish to pledge in by 10 o'clock Fri
day morning. Houses are limited to
14 freshman pledges with an unlim
ited number of sophomores, juniors,
and seniors. No student on proba
tion is allowed to pledge.
Final event of the rushing pro
gram will be the individual house
celebrations Friday night following
formal pledging. These individual
house dances and open houses re
place the annual Pledge Prom of
previous years. The inability to find
a suitable site made this move nec
essary.
An informal Daily poll of Stan
ford's 24 fraternity houses revealed
that only half of them are planning
to have open houses of the type rec
ommended by the Interfraternity
Council in its last meeting.
Several houses had not yet de
cided what they were going to do
and many others exhibited varying
degrees of uncertainty as to their
Friday night activities.
Eight houses are planning pledge
dinners—half with dates and half
without. Twelve of these houses
will hold dances by the present
count —seven with records and five
with orchestras.
Dress finds the greatest diversity
of opinion expressed with nine
houses favoring informal, five semi
formal, and three formal attire.
