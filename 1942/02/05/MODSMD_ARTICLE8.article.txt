# Union Head Fears Lack Of Sugars
## 
### BILL STEIF 
"This month we are getting 80 per
cent of the amount of sugar we used
last year at this time, but next
month . . . who can tell?" So said
Miss Christine Ricker, director of
Stanford dining halls and the Stan
ford Union, with reference to the
ever-growing possibility of sugar
rationing for the war's duration.
Even now the Union and the eat
ing groups are taking steps toward
cutting down their sugar consump
tion. Sugar containei's have been
taken off the counters and are
brought on only at request. The
frostings of the cakes are going to
be cut down and the sugar will
probably be removed from the tops
of the Cellar's sugar doughnuts. The
sugar shortage, furthermore, will
probably necessitate a change in the
formula of the ice cream manufac
tured here at Stanford, according to
Miss Ricker, and is probably going
to bring about an inci'eased usage
of honey.
With reference to the order which
came out of Washington today con
cerning the rationing of 12 ounces of
sugar a week to most individuals
throughout the country, Miss Ricker
said that she did not believe that this
would affect large campus eating
groups or the Cellar, though she did
express the opinion that the frater
nities, sororities, and eating clubs
would probably come under the
order.
All of which means a decided
change in some of Stanford's eating
habits.
Miss Ricker suggests that Stan
ford men and women approach the
problem rationally. "We are trying
very hard not to be forced into
sacking bags of sugar for every in
dividual as was done during the last
war," Miss Ricker stated. "The only
way to avoid this, naturally, is by
getting full co-operation from all
students here at Stanford. So far we
have received a very good response
from the women's eating groups and
we hope to get the same from En
cina," continued Miss Ricker.
Miss Ricker also pointed out that
the Cellar is conserving its supply of
paper napkins by removing the nap
kin containers from the counters
and merely giving one to each cus
tomer with his or her drink or meal.
This is, as Miss Ricker said, a pre
cautionary measure just in case a
paper shortage does develop.
The director of the dining halls
and the Union also said that the
government has ordered that the tin
plate on tin cans be decreased and
that certain items, including dog
food, beer, coffee, and paints, should
no longer be canned at all. This,
Miss Ricker continued, "indicates
that there will probably be a large
increase in the production of frozen
foods soon.
"But on the sugar-rationing, at
least," concluded Miss Ricker with a
twinkle in her eyes, "it looks like all
these years of sugarless coffee for
the feminine figure are going to pay
off after all."

ford Union, with reference to the
ever-growing possibility of sugar
rationing for the war's duration.
Even now the Union and the eat
ing groups are taking steps toward
cutting down their sugar consump
tion. Sugar containei's have been
taken off the counters and are
brought on only at request. The
frostings of the cakes are going to
be cut down and the sugar will
probably be removed from the tops
of the Cellar's sugar doughnuts. The
sugar shortage, furthermore, will
probably necessitate a change in the
formula of the ice cream manufac
tured here at Stanford, according to
Miss Ricker, and is probably going
to bring about an inci'eased usage
of honey.
With reference to the order which
came out of Washington today con
cerning the rationing of 12 ounces of
sugar a week to most individuals
throughout the country, Miss Ricker
said that she did not believe that this
would affect large campus eating
groups or the Cellar, though she did
express the opinion that the frater
nities, sororities, and eating clubs
would probably come under the
order.
All of which means a decided
change in some of Stanford's eating
habits.
Miss Ricker suggests that Stan
ford men and women approach the
problem rationally. "We are trying
very hard not to be forced into
sacking bags of sugar for every in
dividual as was done during the last
war," Miss Ricker stated. "The only
way to avoid this, naturally, is by
getting full co-operation from all
students here at Stanford. So far we
have received a very good response
from the women's eating groups and
we hope to get the same from En
cina," continued Miss Ricker.
Miss Ricker also pointed out that
the Cellar is conserving its supply of
paper napkins by removing the nap
kin containers from the counters
and merely giving one to each cus
tomer with his or her drink or meal.
This is, as Miss Ricker said, a pre
cautionary measure just in case a
paper shortage does develop.
The director of the dining halls
and the Union also said that the
government has ordered that the tin
plate on tin cans be decreased and
that certain items, including dog
food, beer, coffee, and paints, should
no longer be canned at all. This,
Miss Ricker continued, "indicates
that there will probably be a large
increase in the production of frozen
foods soon.
"But on the sugar-rationing, at
least," concluded Miss Ricker with a
twinkle in her eyes, "it looks like all
these years of sugarless coffee for
the feminine figure are going to pay
off after all."
"This month we are getting 80 per
cent of the amount of sugar we used
last year at this time, but next
month . . . who can tell?" So said
Miss Christine Ricker, director of
Stanford dining halls and the Stan
ford Union, with reference to the
ever-growing possibility of sugar
rationing for the war's duration.
