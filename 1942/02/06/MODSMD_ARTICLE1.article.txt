# NAVY WILL NOT USE STANFORD
## 
### 
Stanford University is out of consideration
as a silo for one of four special training centers
for naval aviation cadets, according to an an
nouncement made today by naval officials in
Washington, I). C.
The announcement was corroborated late
this afternoon by Chancellor Ray Lvman Wil
bur, who said that the Navy's decision not to
use. Stanford's facilities had been made because,
"though our athletic facilities were considered
satisfactory, the dormitory set-up on the campus
was inadequate to house the number of cadets
expected."
Frank Fish Walker, financial vice president,
who Hew to Washington Tuesday afternoon to
confer with Naval officials on the proposed plan,
informed him of the Navy Department's decision
this afternoon. Dr. Wilbur said.
The Washington announcement followed a
statement by Chairman Vincent (Dem., (la.) of
the House Naval Affairs Committee that the
University of Georgia and the University of
lowa had been designated as sites for two of

the centers.
Vincent made the above announcement after
a conference with officials of the Bureau of Navi
gation of the Navy Department.
Two more cadet training centers remain to
be selectedâ€”one for the Pacific Coast and for
the northern part of the country.
Naval officials said that Stanford is no longer
being considered, but made no coment on Vin
cent's statement. They further stated that the
information had been made public because of
tlie wide-spread, intense interest shown on the
Pacific Coast.
Rumors that Stanford was to become one of
the four centers for naval cadet training blazed
into print last Monday when a news dispatch,
datelined Washington, D. C., announced that
Stanford and Notre Dame had been selected by
the navy as two of the four proposed centers.
The dispatch was not credited to any official
source, stating only "it was learned . . " All San
Francisco newspapers carried this story.
Dr. Wilbur said on Monday that "nothing

definite had been arranged," although naval au
thorities had already inspected the campus.
Coincident with the announcement of Mr.
Walker 's flight to Washington, the Chancel lot
made the further statement that "ihe situation
is already in the hands of Washington, and we
may assume the Navy has concluded its invest
gation here on the campus."
The plan provides for the establishment of
four new ground schools for naval aviation cadets
which must lie in operation on or before May 1
of this year. Facilities of four of the nation's
universities will be rented for the duration of
the war to* bring the plan into effect.
It is proposed that some 30,(XX) trained men
will be turned out each year under the new set
up. Each of the four universities will have a
yearly quota of approximately 7,(K)() men.
Ruling out of Stanford as a possible training
base throws the situation among Coast univer
sities open for'speculation. Only other school
on the West Coast so far mentioned in connection
with the proposal is St. Mary's.
