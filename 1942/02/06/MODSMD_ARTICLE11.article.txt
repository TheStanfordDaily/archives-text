## 
### 
For those freshmen who did not
choose to pledge a fraternity, two
of the finest dormitories in the
country, Branner and Toyon halls,
will be open for them next autumn.
Also, these frosh will be welcomed
into Stanford's well-known eating
club system, under which approxi
mately half of the men students on
the Farm live. Here they will iind
fellowship, recreation and relaxation
opportunities which are reconcilable
to their desire for privacy and quiet
for studying.
These clubs also offer to the frosh
social opportunities equal to those
of the fraternities. This is possible
only on a campus where the fra
ternity-hall division is as equal as
on the Farm. Far from being
socially inferior, the Branner and
Toyon smokers, dances, exchange
dinners and other functions are
among the outstanding social events
of Stanford's year.
Another factor which keeps Stan
ford from being a school with two
distinct, antagonistic, social groups
is Encina Hall itself, for friendships
which grew up there seldom end
in June. One of the Farm's finest
traditions is that old roommates
and friends of Encina days enter
tain each other in their respective
fraternities and clubs in the years
after they "graduate" from Encina.
