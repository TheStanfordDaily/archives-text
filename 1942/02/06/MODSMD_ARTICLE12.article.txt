# Row Changes Rushing Program
## 
### 
Stanford's first year of rushing
under the new deferred winter quar
ter rushing system has been com
pleted. Whether or not the system
will be continued will depend on the
opinious of the Farm's twenty-four
fraternities as expressed through the
Interfraternity Council.
Contacts between freshmen and
fraternity men other than charfce
meetings was prohibited through
out autumn quarter. Christmas va
cation was declared an open rush
ing period, while the regular rush
ing period began January 6 with the
first Open House and ended with
formal pledging today.
The new program was designed
mainly to relieve pressure on an al
ready too crowded autumn quarter
with the idea of spreading activities
more evenly throughout the year,
as well as to raise low autumn
quarter scholastic averages.
