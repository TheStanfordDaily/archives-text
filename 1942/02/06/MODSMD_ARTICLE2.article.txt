### Bob Sontag 
They call it a "crucial."
That's the way things stack up
tonight when Southern California,
determined to throw a monkey
wrench into the Big Red hoop ma
chine, collides with Coach Everett
Dean's squad in the Pavilion at 8.
Though the Indians lead the
Southern Division of the Pacific
Coast (Conference with 3 wins and
no losses, the Trojans arc right be
hind with 1 wins, 1 loss. A split
tonight and tomorrow would keep
Stanford in possession of the lead,
but by dropping both games, the
Kedskins would be delegated to
second place.
LJ.S.C. brings north much the
same team it had last season. Hill
Ormsby, crackcrjack forward, Lett
Berg, the blond bald one, at center,
and Johnny I.nber, guard, led Gos
sard, Luber's running mate, and
Alex (Jmalev, Urmsby's right-hand
man, a/e new additions to the Tro
jan first-stringers.
The height problem comes down
to 6-4 lor Stanford, 6-2 for S.C.
That's approximately the same as
last week, when U.C.L.A. was two
inches shy of the Stanford slims.
The Trojans will no doubt be the
toughest competition of the season.
Coach iSam Barry and Julie Bescos,
who has really been doing most of
the mentoring down Trojan way,
always put a flashy club on the
floor.
Compare Ormsby, Omalev, Berg,
Gossard and Luber to the Bruins'
or Cal's first string and the Tro
jans come out on top with a big
margin.
