## 
### 
By the time this paper reaches
Stanford students, it will he known
whether tlie freshman hoop team
is just-average as some arc claim
ing or whether it can still hope to
take its place among the outstand
ing quints of past years.
The solver of that enigma will
have been Benny NcfT's highly tout
ed Lowell Indian hoopstcrs who
met the Card yearlings at 6:15 in
the Pavilion.
At game time, the locals were
rated as having a good 50-50 chance
to c.lin their sixth win of an up
and-down season from the Indians
who are rapidly climbing in San
Francisco prophecies.
