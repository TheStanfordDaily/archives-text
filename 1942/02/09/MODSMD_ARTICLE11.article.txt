### 
Any Stanford student, freshman
or upperelassman, who wishes to
become a member of the staff of The
Stanford Daily, is invited to attend
a Daily tryoutee meeting today at
5 p.m. in Room 8 of the Press Build
ing, according to an announcement
made yesterday by Jean Nowcll,
Daily women's editor.
This special tryoutee period will
continue through next Monday, with
two additional meetings being held
during that time and the tryoutees
will be given a chance to learn how
to write news stories, and read
proof and copy.
At today's meeting, Hal Shafer,
editor, will speak on "Staff Organi
zation and the News Story," and
tryoutees will be assigned one story
which they must cover this week.
Plan and aim of the tryoutee train
ing period will be explained by Miss
Nowell.
Hap Everett, associate editor,
speaking on "The Sports Story," will
highlight the second meeting sched
uled for this Thursday at 5 p.m. in

Room 8. Basic campus news sources
will also be discussed at the Thurs
day meeting.
Monday, a week from today, will
see the last meeting of the tryoutees
as such. Managing Editor Herman
Silverman will speak on "News Cov
erage and Assignments" at that time,
and a short test based on the infor
mation on news sources discussed at
Thursday's meeting will be given.
During this week, each of the try
outees will work for one hour on
the copy desk, two hours on the
United Press desk, and one hour on
the special "tryoutee desk." They
will be rated on this work. Their
points, plus the grade they receive
on the news source test, and the
story handed in, will determine
which of the tryoutees will be ap
pointed to the staff as reporters.
Names of the new staff members
will be posted on the Shack bulletin
board, next Tuesday at 2 p.m., fol
lowing a meeting of Editorial Board,
at which the appointments will be
made.
