# Lake Opens Minus Mines, Submarines
## 
### 
For several weeks now, ever since
the winter rains filled Lake Lagu
nita to the brim, there have been
furtive splashings and burblings up
at the lake at nights, as impatient
swimmers took forbidden dips.
But starting today, Farm splash
ers and canoe enthusiasts can paddle
happily and openly about, for at 1
p.m., Daylight Saving Time, the
Boathouse officially opens.
Until further notice, the lake will
be open from 1 to 6 p.m. from Mon
day to Friday, and from 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Al
most all of the canoes and sailboats
are already installed in the Boat
house, but some fraternities have
still not put their boats on the racks.
Anyone wishing to leave their boat
in the Boathouse must apply at the
A.S.S.U. office.
"Thex - e are no mines in the lake,"
announces the Boathouse staff
proudly, "canoeing is absolutely
safe. Minesweepers go out every
morning and our vigilance has kept
enemy subs out of Lagunita. Konko
Tokyo."
