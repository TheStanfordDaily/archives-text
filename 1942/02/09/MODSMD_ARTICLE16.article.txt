# Applies to Navy
## 
### 
Seven Farm men, five of them
members of the varsity football
squad, were accepted by Lieutenant
Commander Gene Tunney for the
Navy Physical Training Department.
Petq Kmetovic, Frankie Albert,
Ken Robesky, Bill Bickenbach,
Frank Welles, Alan Rose, and Frank
Cathcart were all accepted.
Cathcart graduated as a P.E. major
from Stanford several years ago and
has been teaching since that time.
Hampton Pool and Phil Bernstein
decided to think it over a few days
before making out formal applica
tion.
Ernie Nevers, former Ail-Ameri
can fullback, Jim Lawson, present
assistant coach, and Clayton Frye,
boxing coach, all learned they are
a little beyond Commander Tunney's
age limit.
The boys, after passing physical
exams, will enter training in April
at Norfolk, Va., for a three-month
period.
The Stanford men all visited Com
mander Tunney in a party arranged
by Harry Maloney, veteran associate
director of athletics. Maloney knew
Tunney when he was a marine in
France.
