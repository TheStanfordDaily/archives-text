## 283 New Row Men Pledged to Houses 
### 
Five weeks of rushing and worry
for almost half of Stanford's male
students came to an end Friday af
ternoon.
Some 28.'5 fraternity rushees each
filed up to Mr. Warren M. Turner,
Interfraternity auditor, and Jim
Haugh, Interfraternity president,
stated the fraternity of his choice,
and then marched self-consciously
up Stanford's famed Row to be
greeted by his new fraternity broth
ers.
A noisy afternoon of handshaking
and celebrating faded into smoother
tempo at night with pledge dinners.
It was the same old thing again—
just the faces were new. There were
Encinamen who were happy and
those who weren't. There were fra
ternity men celebrating the "nug
gets" they won, and forgetting the
ones they lost.
For those who didn't pledge, the
gulf between Hall and How seemed
wide Friday, but they'll soon see
the Hall-Row split is almost non
existent except for a few short weeks
of spring quarter elections.
This year saw a new deferred
winter quarter rushing system de
signed to eliminate the defects of
previous systems, but there were still
a few of the old complaints.
The final event of pledging week
end- 11 o'clock church service hon
oring the new pledges—saw still
sleepy How men and pledges jam
the Memorial Church to capacity for
the finish of a busy week-end.


FOt'K BETAS seem to be enioying the informal open house that replaced the Pledge Prom this year. Gene Kern, Beta president, shakes hands
with Dave Pate, frosh football star, while watching Doug Halt his. another Beta pledge. Rush Chairman Dud Smith looks on approvingly.
