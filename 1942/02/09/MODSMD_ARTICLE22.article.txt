BULLETIN
SINGAPORE, Man, Feb.!) (UP).
— Japanese invasion troops "in
some force" swept across mile
wide Johore Strait last night and
despite a terrific artillery barrage
established a beach-head on the
western shore of Singapore Island,
it was announced officially today.
This first successful landing came
on the tenth day of the siege of Sing
apore and less than 24 hours after
another Japanese force had landed
on Übin Island, a bare half-mile off
the northeast coast of this island.
The official announcement con
tained no details and did not in
dicate whether the invaders had
swept ashore near the important
Tenga Airdrome or further north.
(A Domci Agency dispatch
broadcast from Saigon and heard
in New York by the United Press
listening post said that reports
from the Malayan front told how
many tank units, under cover of
artillery fire, crossed Johore Strait
in the wake of the first landing
forces and were rapidly consoli
dating gains in the island in the
face of fierce enemy fire. This
account did not say where the
landing occurred.)

***SINGAPORE, Feb. 8 (5:30 p.m.)

(UP). —The Japanese siege army
landed troops today on Übin Island,
half a mile off Singapore, ard has
been bombing and shelling the be
leaguered fortress since early morn
ing.
(Monday's London Daily Mail
said that Japanese big guns were
blasting at the island's road system
and that the concussion of the ex
ploding shells shook Singapore city.
British artillery was retaliating by
firing at every discernible enemy
movement across the Strait of Jo
hore ,the dispatch said.)
| STRONGEST WAR TASTE
Singapore had its strongest taste
of war to date, though the number
of casualties was not expected to be
| large.
But the island was not on the rc
| ceiving end of all the action. Its own
j big guns and fighter planes roared
I powerful challenges, sinking a prowl
! ing enemy vessel offshore, silencing
more Japanese guns on the main
land, and crippling three enemy
bombers.
The people are learning to distin
guish between the thunder of their
own and the Japanese guns, and arc
taking it all wtih surprising calm
ness.
LITTLE JAP ACTIVITY
On the coastal fronts there has
j been little Japanese activity, and
i the defenders have been able to deal
quickly with that. The occasional
| Japanese approaches to Singapore
j have received neat handling.
The Japanese landing on Übin
I Island, lying in the eastern mouth of
iJohore Strait, had been anticipated.
As long ago as Thursday a British
j brigadier said that enemy recon
naissance had foreshadowed the
j undertaking.
The island, potential stepping stone
! to the northeastern tip of Singapore,
is less than 10 miles from the heart
|of Singapore city and across nar-
I row Sarangoon harbor from some
of the base's heaviest pre-war forti
fications.
