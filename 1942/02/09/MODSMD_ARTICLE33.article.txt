# Troy-Cards Split
## 
### HANK THOREAU 
It took a vfry intelligent follow. !
plus a good basketball team, plus a |
"cold" night to halt the 13-game
winning streak compiled by Stan- j
lord's varsity cage team, the "High- !
boys."
These three factors combined Sat
urday night in the Pavilion to en- J
able Southern California to edge out j
Stanford, 27-2.'!, after the local lads !
had won handily in the Friday night j
encounter, 4.'i-30.
The very intelligent fellow, Sam
Harry, who coaches the Trojan hoop
stars when he can leave his football
and baseball chores for a few days,
slowed the game down Saturday
night to the point that the Trojans
had a chance to compete on even j
terms with the fast-breaking "High- j
boys."
Unfortunately for L.S.J.U., their
live dependable basketballers found
themselves unable to capitalize on
the easiest of shots, when they did [
get them. When Don Burness and
Slim Jim Pollard score two points
apiece and when Bill Cowden and
Howie Dallmar confine themselves
to three digits, that is a very "cold"
night.
The net result of this split two
game series plus the split in the
Southland between California and J
U.C.L.A. leaves the Cards still ahead j
in the Southern Division standings,
hut with the Trojans only one game
behind. The Bears are straggling
along in third place with two victo
ries to three defeats. They are still j
in the basement, but not as far down
as usual since they hold a win over
U.S.C.
'HIGHBOYS' BOG DOWN
From the manner in which they !
started Friday night's game, it ap- i
peared that the Indians were going
to run through the visitors from
University Avenue as easily as they
had U.C.L.A. and Cal. At the end
of the half the Cards had more than
doubled their opponents' score, 24-
10. The "Highboys" came back onto
the floor ready to completely demor
alize the Southern Californians so
that there wouldn't be anything to
worry about Saturday night.
However, during that period in
which the paying customers smoke
and stretch, Justin Barry told his
boys plenty. He told them enough
to enable them to outscore the locals
in the second half, not by enough to j
change the final outcome, however.
LOW SCORING
Barry must have spent the en
tire next day telling them more, be
cause at the end of the half Satur
day night S. C. still had only 10
points, but this time Stanford was
credited with 9, as many as they
usually score in five minutes of spir
ited play.
The game was 15 minutes old be
fore Voss finally sunk a lay-in to
give Stanford its first field goal of
the game. Try as they would the
Indians could not regain their col- |
lective "eyes."
BKRG SINKS TWO
Only by superior defensive play
did the Indians manage to stay 1
close to the Trojans in the second
half. Seemingly the only way Stan
ford could score was by sinking free
throws, since all of their set-ups J
miss-fired. In the final minutes j
when Baldy Berg hooked in two in a [
row and Johnny Luber, perennial j
Farm favorite, swished through a >
free throw, Stanford knew that the
best it could get in this game was
second prize.
