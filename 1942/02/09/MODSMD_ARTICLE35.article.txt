# Lowell, Monterey Fives Fall Before Frosh Scoring Sprees
## 
### 
Second-half scoring sprees cinched
two games for the Stanford fresh
man basketball team over the week
end, Lowell High and Monterey
High both falling to support the evi
dence that the sterling yearlings
will be "on the dime" in the all-im
portant clash with the Berkeley
frosh Friday night.
Lowell High was able to make a
one-half ball game in their offering
Friday night, with tall Bob Cherry
putting the Indians ahead 17-16 at
the half with a 30-foot underhanded
flip. But in the second half the
Bengtson charges allowed the Benny
Neff quint two points, while Dave
Brown and Bob Barsocchini led a
scoring expedition that hooped 18
points to put the Stanfords on top
34-19 at the gun. This was a five
point greater margin than that of
the Cal frosh over the Lowells in an
earlier tilt.
The Lowell team, supposedly the
second-best in the San Francisco
league this year, didn't hit its set
ups during the first quarter, while
all of Stanford's first string—Hall,
Heald, Blown. Parsons, and Bar
socchini— collected two points to
give the Cards a 10-6 quarter lead.
Coleman opened Ihe second quar
ter with a side-arm flip that brought
Lowell to 8-10, Parsons hooped two
field goals in a row to make it 14-8
for Stanford, Brown pushed it to
10-8, and then Bob Cherry, aided
by forward Kudelka, put on Low
ell's only threat of the evening with
a four-bucket campaign that gave
Lowell a 17-16 advantage at half
time.

In the all-Stanford second half,
Dave Brown started the work with
a one-hander, then Barsocchini,
Brown, Herrick, Brown, Herrick,
Barsocchini, Carlos Brown, Wood
ard, etc., went on into the night with
the b«st display of offensive power
yet shown by the frosh team to
squelch the Lowells.
Against a scrappy but obviously
"high school'' team from Monterey
Saturday, the first-string freshmen,
led by Jack Heald's six points, put
Stanford ahead 12-4 at the quarter,
and then retired while various re
serve Stanfords flipped 28 more
points while the Monterey lads were
held to 14. Carlos Brown was high
point man with 7 points, followed
by Heald and Hartwell with six
each. Final: Stanford 40. Monterey
18.
