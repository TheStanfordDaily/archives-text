S>IPS THAT PASS IN THE

NIGIIT: Piedmont Don Zappe
| tini, '-11 Papoose fullback, lost a
year's growth Friday noon when he
| "ran over" a car that pulled up by
J the post office. Don had his back
turned, the car pulled up, but he ;
! didn't know it. He backed up a
| little, and when the back of his lap
j touched the front fender, he and
his face jumped a country mile!

I EAVE it to gum chewing, molar
clacking Len Berg "to sink the;
bucket that sank Stanford Saturday j
| night. With his own team in front,
! 24-23, and seconds remaining, he
| elected to shoot. The try was good,
but if one of the tall Indians had J
S come off the backboard with the ball
j and gone down the floor to set up a J
j score, the gun would have popped !
; with Stanford the winner. Berg '
| put the Trojans in front at 24-23 j
j with a nifty tip-in, but that next j
one —lucky Lenny.
In case you didn't know, the gent
in the white outfit Saturday who
handled the ii'l guys' halftime
jumping deal was Clyde Devinc,
center of Oregon State's football
j team three years ago.
We like to think that since the j
! basketball officials are right on top j
of the play, they will see everything, i
But even with olir 6 diopter myopic
I sensation, we thought we saw some
J uncalled fouls.
We still like to leave it up to the !
i refs, but when the Pavilion fans
J stand up and scream en masse, they
! must be right. By and by, when !
Julie Bescos stood up to do a little
booing of his own, the fans shouted
the familiar, "Down, Sam." They
thought it must be Sam Barry, i
| Twarn't, however.
(iJEEMS as if number 13 isn't the
k jinx any more. Rather, it's 14.
| When Stanford's grid champs lost to
j Oregon State at Corvallis, it would
| have been the 14th straight win.
Had Everett Dean's quint licked
! S.C. again Saturday, it would have
been the hasketballers' 14th
straight. Incidentally, the Indians
play their next five games away
from home: Cal at Berkeley next
Friday; U.C.L.A. at Westwood the
following week-end, and Southern
California the week-end after that
in Los Angeles.
Forty-eight years old last Satur
day, Babe Ruth has streamlined his
once Falstaffian girth down to a
mere 223 pounds, slightly below his
playing weight prior to his retire
ment seven years ago. The one-time
Yank king of swat is due in Holly
i wood soon for his first appearance
I in a full-length motion picture, the
story of Lou Gehrig's life.

i ALSAB, king of last year's two
| year-old crop, made his first
start as a three-year-old at Hia
leah race track Saturday. Bet down
'to 3-5, Alsab disappointed a big
crowd by breaking last and staying
I there most of the way in a 7-fur
j long sprint. Under the staggering
I impost of 128 pounds, he made a
j bold stretch bid to end up sixth in
j a field of 10.
Don't give up on Alsab yet. As a
j two-year-old he won 15 out of 22
j starts, earning $110,610 for his
I owners.
