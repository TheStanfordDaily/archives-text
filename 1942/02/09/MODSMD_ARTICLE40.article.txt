# Farm Ruggers Whip British In 16-5 Victory
## 
### 
In the first game of the season
Stanford's rugby team chalked up a
16-5 win over the British from the
H.M.S. Orion. Although the game
was not a high-scoring affair, both
teams kept each other busy watch
ing the breakaway backs and ends
as Bob Laverty scored len points
for the Redskins.
After Laverty's field goal, which
set the Indians out ahead, 3-0, George
Jedenoff tallied again from a scrum
on the one-yard line. Laverty kicked
the conversion to make the score
8-0. At ihe close of the second half
the British almost scored only to
have Big Bill Sheller, center three,
steal the ball from a whole host of
navy men.
In the second half Bob Laverty
again scored after breaking away
from the Britishers and hitting down
the side 60 yards, outrunning
"Georgie," little 5-foot-1 scrum half
for the Britishers. Two or three
times Laverty was but with
a sudden burst of speed he fell over
r the goal after dodging half the
British team.
After a neat bit of footwork and
an amazing kicking exhibition, the
men from the Orion boomed over
the goal from a scrum on about the
two-yard line.
A1 Wool, right wing for the In
dians, scampered 50 yards late in
the closing period to score, and Lav
erty converted to end the scoring
for the day at 16-5.
