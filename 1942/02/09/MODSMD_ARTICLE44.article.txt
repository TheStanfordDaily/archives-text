Charity to the Red Cross
LAST week Ex Committee learned the Red
Cross had refused profits on Stanford's
Charity Ball, this coming Friday, because the
Red Cross name and insignia was being used
in publicity stories, on posters and on the dance
bids. It is contrary to Red Cross policy to allow
such promotion, unless they receive total gross
receipts.
This meant all such posters had to be re
moved, and any reference to the Red Cross
deleted in other publicity, and it was done. Rea
sons for the Red Cross's standing policy were
discussed in this column last Wednesday, and
it was pointed out that by its action in refusing
the dance profits of a reputable organization,
one which they could rely upon to "deliver
the goods," they were losing approximately
$500, estimated profits of the dance.
It was also recommended Red Cross officials
contact their national headquarters in an effort
to change the policy, thereby accepting dona
tions from and permitting use of their name by
any organization found reputable upon investi
gation.
Although Charity Ball sponsors are not able
to publicize the dance with the Red Cross name,
Ex Committee announced yesterday that due
to the need of the American War Relief Fund,
profits will be donated after the dance to the
Red Cross.
The campus can now dance at Friday night's
Charity Ball with the definite assurance profits
will go to the Red Cross. The war relief need
is critical, and it is likely to be even more
critical in the near future. Whether this need
will be satisfied to the desired extent of $500
will be decided Friday night. It will be decided
by the campus.

Charity to the Red Cross
LAST week Ex Committee learned the Red
Cross had refused profits on Stanford's
Charity Ball, this coming Friday, because the
Red Cross name and insignia was being used
in publicity stories, on posters and on the dance
bids. It is contrary to Red Cross policy to allow
such promotion, unless they receive total gross
receipts.
This meant all such posters had to be re
moved, and any reference to the Red Cross
deleted in other publicity, and it was done. Rea
sons for the Red Cross's standing policy were
discussed in this column last Wednesday, and
it was pointed out that by its action in refusing
the dance profits of a reputable organization,
one which they could rely upon to "deliver
the goods," they were losing approximately
$500, estimated profits of the dance.
It was also recommended Red Cross officials
contact their national headquarters in an effort
to change the policy, thereby accepting dona
tions from and permitting use of their name by
any organization found reputable upon investi
gation.
Although Charity Ball sponsors are not able
to publicize the dance with the Red Cross name,
Ex Committee announced yesterday that due
to the need of the American War Relief Fund,
profits will be donated after the dance to the
Red Cross.
The campus can now dance at Friday night's
Charity Ball with the definite assurance profits
will go to the Red Cross. The war relief need
is critical, and it is likely to be even more
critical in the near future. Whether this need
will be satisfied to the desired extent of $500
will be decided Friday night. It will be decided
by the campus.

Entered as second-class matter at the Post Office in Palo Alto,
California, under the Act of March 3, 1897.
