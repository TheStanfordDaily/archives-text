TWENTY-FIVE years ago, a year ago, and
now today, an editorial was written about
"Ah, at last, after days and days of rain, SPRING
IS HERE." But it does seem good to wake up
and look over the covers and see a cloudless
sky overhead.
Of course, many students drag out the garden
hose, apply a chamois, and brighten up the
car to take the "one and only" for a spin in the
hills. Others go boating or swimming. Then
there are those who let their studies go and
simply have to study, but it doesn't take much
coaxing to move them out of the libe onto the
boathouse deck.
Twenty-five years ago, a year ago, and prob
ably tomorrow, great black clouds will loom
over the hills to the west, convertible tops will
go up, half-dried raincoats will be brought out
of closets, and the beauty of yesterday will be
a thing of the past something to look for
tomorrow, next week, or next quarter.—John
