THERE is very little chance that the Japanese
will bomb the Bay Area.
That statement, or general thought, is one
that probably all of us, under pressure, would
admit having harbored.
No, it doesn't seem possible that our enemy,
5,000 miles away over the world's greatest ex
panse of water, could actually attack us, from
the air or in any other manner.
Yet that was the way they felt at Pearl Har
bor, at Manila, at Singapore, even in London.
It wasn t so long ago that people were specu
lating whether the Germans could really do
any damage from the air to cities such as Paris
and Warsaw.
Conjecturing whether or not we could be
bombed, however, hasn't taken up much time
of Stanford's Administration and student lead
ers. They have brushed over speculation to
something much more important —will we be
ready if it happens?
This is a philosophy which should be highly
praised—which might have saved other peoples
much suffering. In the vein of Admiral Dewey's
"Damn the torpedoes" remark, we might para
phrase it to "Damn the wondering if they can
do it—let's get ready in case they do."
The mobilization which was carried out on
the Farm last Tuesday showed this action-not
words philosophy is working. To the Civilian
Defense leaders we send a hearty "Keep it up"
—and to the rest of the student body a forceful
reminder to "Do your part."- Vic Minahan
