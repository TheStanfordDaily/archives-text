from Moscow last night indicated that Nazi
resistance was stiffening, and the now 10-weeks
old Soviet offensive was losing a little of its initial
momentum. The Russian advance, however, has not
stopped in any sense of the word.
Less spectacular now than the far eastern theater,
the battle along the two-thousand-mile, frozen Rus
sian front is still the key action of the war as of now.
At present, Herr Hitler's legions are occupied,
almost entirely, with the Red Army. The only other
action in which they are involved is a game of tag,
Libyan style.

J£UT look at the 3,000,000 men in Britain, who must
sit on the island until all danger of invasion is
removed. Look at the lovely British navy which is
deploying about the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
Look at the planes, which must remain in England to
hold th«t vital control of the air.
On the other hand, look at the Far East. Everyone,
except the Chinese, is short of men. Everyone is short
of ships (we could certainly use the Atlantic fleet over
there). Everyone is desperately short of planes.

I ICKING Japan will not dispose of Hitler. He got
along fine without her from September 1, 1939, till
December 7, 1942. On the other hand, licking Hitler
would free enough men and equipment to polish off
Japan in short order. The Japanese cannot possibly
produce enough materiel to hold them against a full
dress attack by the United States, and Great Britain.
And here's another point. Spring is coming—even
in Russia. During the March-April thaw neither side
can do much. Rivers become dangerously clogged with
the breaking ice. And the marshes are nothing but
gluey mud, yards deep.
That two months is going to provide a breathing
spell for both sides. Then the Nazi counter-attack will
come. Maybe the Soviets won't be able to hold them
again, through the summer. Hitler can turn west
again if that happens.
And then the Far Eastern situation must, of neces
sity, get worse. Such a thing is possible, you know.
