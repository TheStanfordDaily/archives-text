# BULL SESSION

### MIKE CHURCHILL 
r JpO'MORROW is the day of winter elections. Most
students choose to ignore this with all the indif
ference of a Stanford girl passing a fellow who is
waiting for a ride to Paly.
With so many people in the world fighting for the
right of self-government, our lethargy towards our
privilege is ridiculous.
A particularly important amendment is being pro
posed on Tuesday's ballot. This amendment repre
sents a conscientious attempt to modify the evils of
the caucus system.
The old practice of pre-election "horse trading"
cannot be abolished all at once, but the proposed
amendment may be the thin end of a wedge that
will bring about this reform.
The argument against the caucus system is not so
much a criticism of the men it nominates and elects,
as of the methods by which these men are chosen.
This scheme enables all that is disreputable and
under-hand to which the dickerings between rival
groups which have candidates to push. So often it is
not a matter of whether the man in question is the
most suited for the office, but rather a matter of the
votes he controls.
Caucuses are an unnecessary evil. With preferen
tial voting it is no longer possible to jeopardize a
candidate's chance by nominating someone who will
draw votes from him. It was to prevent this that
caucuses were instituted, and now that they are no
longer needed, Stanford would do well to dispense
with them.

officially came to The Daily yesterday, as
with great ceremony the Editor in Chief cau
tiously opened a window half way. Although two
night editors succumbed, recognition was accorded
the vernal season.
No longer can one talk of lazy daisy days in the
fields with sunshine and soft breezes, for these things
are weather, and weather is a military secret. No
longer are days at the beach and in the hills fit Bull
Session topics, for they are not in keeping with Stan
ford's new and necessary "all out for war" policy.
