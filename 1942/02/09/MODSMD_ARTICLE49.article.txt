# CAMPUS OPINION
## BLUSH, WILLIE, BLUSH

r jplE EDITOR, SIR:
If the Stanford Daily were a junior high school
publication, I, for one, might find something amusing
in the adolescent prattle of its "Willie's." But in this
time of national crisis to give this sort of thing room in
your publication is not funny. I am forced to remem
ber that The Daily is the daily newspaper of one of
the most noted universities of the world. So I'tell
myself that your ''Willies" are the creation of the
staff, solely for the purpose of stirring up a contro
versy which will place certain facts before the read
ers. I hope I am right.
I would ask "Willie" to appoint himself a Buddy
in the Serviceâ€”say a young man of about his own
age, lying in a field hospital of Gen. Mac Arthur's divi
sion. Each time that "Willie" indulges himself, will he
share his good time with his Buddy? He can put the
price into a Red Cross chest somewhere on the campus.
The "Willies" have always with us. They had
a high old time in Philadelphia while Washington's
men starved and froze at Valley Forge. If you have
read "Reveille in Washington" you know what they
did even in the city of Washington during the Civil
War. Today it requires the President to publicly re
buke the parasites who are cluttering up the same
city, forcing up rents and living costs, so that clerks
and stenographers cannot find decent accommodations.
These arc the same group who yell loudly, "Where
is the fleet? What's it doing? What's the matter with
our pilots?"
A column of light chatter is welcome in the dark
ness of the regular news today. But such opinions
as those of the "Willies" is decidedly bad taste in
any publication.
Very truly yours,
Mrs. Martha Waldron
