# Cooper Gets 'Typed' Role In Goldwyn's 'Ball of Fire'

"BALL OF FIItE," now playing at the Fox-Stanford in Palo Alto.
The boy-meets-girl formula gets a new twist in Sam Goldwyn's "Ball
of Fire," when a night club singer invades an establishment of bachelor
pedants compiling an encyclopedia. Spiced up with a minor crime wave
Jand liberal doses of last-minute slang, it turns out as one of the most
successful conglomerations of the cinema.

Gary Coper is Mr. Deeds, John
Doe, and Sergeant York all over
again, this time in the role of Bert
ram Potts, professor of English, who
graduated from Princeton when he
was 13 and "is the kind of a guy
who gets drunk on a glass of but
termilk." He discovers from the
garbage man that his treatise on
slang is out of date, and goes out on
research.
He meets Sugarpuss. Sugarpuss is
Barbara Stanwyck, who is at home
both jiving boogie-woogie with
Krupa and clicking out mouthfuls of
"Shove in your clutch, Professor."
"What's buzzin', Cousin," is pur
portedly her own addition to the
script.
The encyclopedists, whether run
ning from Sugarpuss in their night
shirts or trying to learn the conga,
are an odd collection of characters;
who as continuous background,
make the picture, to paraphrase its
own script, "a solid sender."â€”Covey
