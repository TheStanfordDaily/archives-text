# Yawns Welcome New War Time to Farm
## 
### 
Everybody's going everywhere
earlier this morning. That is be
cause War Time (daylight saving)
went into effect everywhere at
11 o'clock last night except the
women's living groups who caught
up with the rest of the country at
2::Â»0 a.m. Anyway, everybody
moved their clocks up an hour a
few hours ago.
That meant that it was pretty
dark when people got up this
morning. That meant that hash
ers who usually go to hash at 7
o'clock in the morning went a
hashing at (i o'clock this morning.
And those lucky people with 8
o'clock exams this morning went
to their exams at the time that
they usually were just yawning
and rolling over for an extra
twenty-minute snooze.
