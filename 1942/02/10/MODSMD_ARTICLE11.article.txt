# Family Call Appeal Starts Next Week
## Drive Will Begin At Kick-off Banquet Next Tuesday Night 
### 
Stanford's Family Call, under the
student leadership of Bob Crary,
gets underway officially next Tues
day at the annual kickolT banquet.
This years marks tjie third that
students have participated in the an
nual appeal to students, alumni, and
friends of the University for gifts.
This year the student solicitors
will stress the work Stanford is do
ing in the war program. As com
plaints have been registered about
the way the calling was carried on
the past two years, Crary emphasized
the fact that only those who have
given in the past will be contacted.
"There will be no goal this year,"
he pointed out. "This main idea is to
improve relations with the alumni."
FAMILY COUNCIL
Working with Bob on the student
committee are Helen Knight, Marge
Gestring, Jack Pugh, and Vernon
Edler. These five comprise the Stan
ford Family Council, which in turn
appointed 16 assistants called the
Stanford Aides.
Mary Bullis, Bob Preble, Ed Gibbs,
Dick Middleton, Bob Wreisner, An
nette Long, Bob Blake, Pat Palmer,
Betty Blystone, Janet McClanahan,
Bob McNeil, Ted Cole, Barbara
Gregg, Jim Mc√ürier, Harriet Spicer,
and Rosamond Fuller arc the aides
who will appoint the 64 couples who
will do the calling. The names of
the couples will be released next
Monday morning.
Enlistment of the callers started
yesterday afternoon and will con
tinue until Sunday.
MEET FOR DINNER
Thursday night the council and
the aides will meet for dinner in
the Union at 6:15 to formulate final
plans for the appeal. *
The Stanford Family Call is a
part of the Sixth Annual Appeal of
Stanford University.
Three years ago Mr. Frank
Walker, who was then a trustee, ap
peared before Excom and asked the
student body to take over a part of
the appeal. This was the first time
that a trustee had made a personal
appearance at an Excom meeting.
Bob Moulton was the first student
to take the job. He was followed
last year by Bob Newell.
"Because Stanford is a privately
endowed school with no support
from taxes, it is necessary that
friends, alumni, and students con
tribute so that Stanford will be able
to carry on its work in national de
fense," Crary said.
