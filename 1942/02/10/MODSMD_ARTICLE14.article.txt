## 
### JANE DONALD 
The sandy-haired fellow who's the best amateur skier west of the Mis
sissippi docsn t credit his success to eating Whcaties for breakfast every
morning.
The reason for this gross oversight was revealed when Bobby Blatt, top
man on the Stanford ski ieain, told how he learned his fundamentals

from Otto Lang, then an instructor
at Mt. Rainier. Bobby began only
seven years ago, and today he has
won at one time or another all the
important Western meets.
He skied in Chile and Europe and
was appointed to the United States
Olympic team. Last year he took the
first honors in the National Intercol
legiate Combined Championships at
Sun Valley and only his missing one
gate in the slalom cost him that meet
this year.
MAJORS IN LAW
Blatt is a sophomore here at Stan
ford and hangs out at the Alpha
Dolt house. His major in pre-law,
and he says that he will become a
professional skier only if he does
not succeed as a lawyer. The di'aft
may postpone his plans, since he
registers this month. He may try to
join a ski troop.
Blatt also enjoys water skiing,
swimming, and water polo. He
played on the freshman water polo
team last year.
He isn't partial to any particular
brand of ski, just any make that
happens to be around will do. He
believes that ridge-top skis are just
as good as laminated skis. Before
his ski.s lose their camber he has
usually worn them out.
When asked what type of skiing

| he enjoys best, he said, "I just like
to fool around if there's a chair lift
) handy."
Blatt is very partial to chair lifts
j and aerial tramways, and suggests
that radios under the scats would be
a great improvement. His jumping
iis comparatively poor, since he's
never made a jump farther than 130
feet, which only amounts to jumping
off a ten-story building.
Blatt is planning on entering the
nationals at Yoscmite this March.
He named Bill Rcdlin, Alta Ski
Club, and Chris Schwarzenbach,
Pasadena Ski Club, as his stiffest
competition for top honors in that
meet.
Blatt was the number one man in
a multiple ski meet last week-end
at Soda Springs. He will enter the
University of Nevada Winter Sports
Carnival along with the seven other
members of tiio Stanford ski team
next week-end, and figures that
Stanford should place at least sec
ond.

sissippi docsn t credit his success to eating Whcaties for breakfast every
morning.
The reason for this gross oversight was revealed when Bobby Blatt, top
man on the Stanford ski ieain, told how he learned his fundamentals

from Otto Lang, then an instructor
at Mt. Rainier. Bobby began only
seven years ago, and today he has
won at one time or another all the
important Western meets.
He skied in Chile and Europe and
was appointed to the United States
Olympic team. Last year he took the
first honors in the National Intercol
legiate Combined Championships at
Sun Valley and only his missing one
gate in the slalom cost him that meet
this year.
MAJORS IN LAW
Blatt is a sophomore here at Stan
ford and hangs out at the Alpha
Dolt house. His major in pre-law,
and he says that he will become a
professional skier only if he does
not succeed as a lawyer. The di'aft
may postpone his plans, since he
registers this month. He may try to
join a ski troop.
Blatt also enjoys water skiing,
swimming, and water polo. He
played on the freshman water polo
team last year.
He isn't partial to any particular
brand of ski, just any make that
happens to be around will do. He
believes that ridge-top skis are just
as good as laminated skis. Before
his ski.s lose their camber he has
usually worn them out.
When asked what type of skiing

| he enjoys best, he said, "I just like
to fool around if there's a chair lift
) handy."
Blatt is very partial to chair lifts
j and aerial tramways, and suggests
that radios under the scats would be
a great improvement. His jumping
iis comparatively poor, since he's
never made a jump farther than 130
feet, which only amounts to jumping
off a ten-story building.
Blatt is planning on entering the
nationals at Yoscmite this March.
He named Bill Rcdlin, Alta Ski
Club, and Chris Schwarzenbach,
Pasadena Ski Club, as his stiffest
competition for top honors in that
meet.
Blatt was the number one man in
a multiple ski meet last week-end
at Soda Springs. He will enter the
University of Nevada Winter Sports
Carnival along with the seven other
members of tiio Stanford ski team
next week-end, and figures that
Stanford should place at least sec
