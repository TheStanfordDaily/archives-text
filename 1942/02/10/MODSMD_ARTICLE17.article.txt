PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

more representative of the students.
A.S.S.U. Vice-President Pat Ad
ams replied when questioned re
garding this issue that "It is a very
good idea, something that Stanford
has needed for a long time. I'm all
for it."
And Jim White, Election Commit

cure all the evils of the present
election system, but it can't hurt
anything and is bound to do some
good. It will curb some of the pre
election 'deals'."

ficers today, it will vote on two new
amendments to the Constitution.

election dates and a change in the
nominating system.
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
As the Constitution now reads
(Article VII, Section 1), elections
are to be twice a year, one on the
second Tuesday in February and the
other on the third Tuesday of spring
quarter. The proposed amendments
would change the election days to
the second Wednesday in February,
and the third Wednesday in spring
quarter.
The second proposed amendment
is to Article VII, Section 3, of the
Constitution. This amendment
would reduce the period for nomi
nations to one day: tlic Monday pre
ceding elections. The reason for
these proposed amendments is to try
and cut into the caucus system,
which has been the object of severe
criticism from some students and
groups during the past years.
EXCOM OPINIONS
Regarding these amendments,
A.S.S.U. President George Jackson
said: "This proposed amendment is
the conclusion of long study and
analysis of our election system by
both this and last year's Executive
Committees. We hope that it will
contribute to making each candidate
more representative of the students.
A.S.S.U. Vice-President Pat Ad
ams replied when questioned re
garding this issue that "It is a very
good idea, something that Stanford
has needed for a long time. I'm all
for it."
And Jim White, Election Commit
tee co-chairman, said: "It might not
cure all the evils of the present
election system, but it can't hurt
anything and is bound to do some
good. It will curb some of the pre
election 'deals'."

Following are the two amend
ments, as they will appear on the
