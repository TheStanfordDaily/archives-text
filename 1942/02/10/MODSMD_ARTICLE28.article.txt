# Alumni Drive In Full Swing
## 
### 
"Maintaining a permanent tie with
the Farm after you leave Stanford is
just as important as any single
phase of your undergraduate life,"
stated Bones Hamilton, alumni sec
retary, yesterday in urging all
members of the Class of '42 to pur
chase their life memberships in the
Stanford Alumni Association,
Seniors are being given a special
reduced rate for this one week of
the drive. Until Friday member
ships may be purchased for $50 and
at any time after that they will cost
$00. Payments may be made on a
five-year deferment plan with $10
due during the first year.
Members of the senior class are
being contacted by representatives
in all living groups and off-campus.
First reports on the progress of the
drive are not yet available, and all
solicitors are urged to call in their
results each day to the alumni office
so that sales in each group can be
computed.
The constant contact with class
mates and the University which the
association will afford all those go
ing into the services was cited by
the Senior Class Committee as a
special reason for immediate mem
bership.
"The Alumni Association will
bring Stanford to you no matter
where you are," Secretary Hamilton
added.
