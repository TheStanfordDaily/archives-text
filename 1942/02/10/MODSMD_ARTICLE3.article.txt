### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9 (UP). â€”
Rep. John Taber, R., N.Y., tonight
responded to House passage of the
$100,000,000 deficiency appropriation
for the Office of Civilian Defense
with plans for a new campaign to
remove screen star Melvyn Douglas
and rhythmic dancer Maris Chaney
from OCD payrolls.
He said he will write to Comp
troller General Lindsay Warren
asking that "glamorous" OCD em
ployes be taken off government pay
rolls on grounds the agency has no
legal authority for their employ
ment.
OCD activities, he said, are con
fined by law to protection of the
public from wartime hazards rather
than "frivolous" programs.
