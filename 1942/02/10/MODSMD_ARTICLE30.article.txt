### BILL COUGHLIN 
"Gosh," said an amazed freshman
up at the lake yesterday afternoon,
"Stanford women do have legs, don't
they!"
And with that remark, the rubber
boots, slickers, and bandannas of
winter quarter were on their way
out, and the beautifully filled bath
ing suits and playsuits of spring
quarter were on their way in. For
at 1 p.m. yesterday, Lake Lagunita
officially opened.
Canoes dotted the rippled surface
of the lake and shouts of "Gawd,

but it's cold" echoed across the wa
ter. Soldiers scurrying along the
road in jeeps turned from national
defense long enough to wave at the
girls in the Roble canoes.
On the path running around the
lake, an artist had set up his easel
to sketch the scene. The Roble and
Lagunita sun decks were filled with
girls hoping that, even though it
was mid-February, they could get
a tan.
And spring quarter was only six
weeks away.
