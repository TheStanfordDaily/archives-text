# Frosh Cagers Face Cubs Friday; Hangar to Lead Berkeley Team
## 
### 
Firm with (he pride of Encina, Roble, and tlie Class of '45 on their
any where-from-skinny -to-broad shoulders, the Stanford frosh basketball
team is going shopping for a hear rug in Berkeley Friday night against
the Cal freshies.
Victory means everlasting fame (until next time), while defeat means

disgrace too horrible to think about.i
We won't. In any bear hunt the
chances of victory depend upon the
ammunition of our side and the claws
of the other.
Chief claw of the Berkeley kin
dergarten collection is Chuck Hang- |
er, forward de luxs. "Coat" Hangar ;
has flipped innumerable baskets in ;
early frays against such competition !
as Lowell, St. Ignatius, and the i
Santa Clara freshman. In the Low
ell game, in which the Cal Babes
were as lucky as the devil to eke out
a 12-point win, 40-28, Mr. Hangar
was very extraordinarily unusual, j
collecting 17 points. ,
ST. IGNATIUS AFFAIR
In the St. Ignatius affair, which
was one of those slumber parties of
defensive tactics. Hangar hung some
9 points. Assisting claws in the
Berkeley organism will be forward
Bill DePaoli, center Bob Arnold,
and Larry Stewart and Claude His
key, guards.
High point of the Cal season was I
their win over the same Santa Clara
freshman who temporarily embar
rassed our squad by some 12 points.
But this was early in the season,
with both squads reporting a great
deal of development on floorwork j
and shot-pbtting since recent games, (
e.g., the Cards showing against
Lowell, Friday.
USUAL CARD STARTERS
Accompanying Head Hunter
Bengtson on the fur-fetching jaunt
will be the usual "Fearful Five"—
Parsons, Barsocchini, Heald, Hall,
and Dave Brown. All but Barsoc
chini were very much in evidence on
that cloudy fall day when the Cub
football eleven was lucky again,
this time 6 to 0. Hence, the blood
of the wee bear will salve a lot of
wounds.
Distressing point of the outlook is
the fact that the Cards will come
home Saturday, either with rug or
not, to face Paly High and its cham
pionship team. Big Ernie Filberti at
the center slot of the San Francisco |
squad has made more coaches wish I
they were back in normal school
than any collection of school boards
in the country.

the fact that the Cards will come
home Saturday, either with rug or
not, to face Paly High and its cham
pionship team. Big Ernie Filberti at
the center slot of the San Francisco |
squad has made more coaches wish I
they were back in normal school
than any collection of school boards
in the country.
Firm with (he pride of Encina, Roble, and tlie Class of '45 on their
any where-from-skinny -to-broad shoulders, the Stanford frosh basketball
team is going shopping for a hear rug in Berkeley Friday night against
the Cal freshies.
Victory means everlasting fame (until next time), while defeat means

disgrace too horrible to think about.i
We won't. In any bear hunt the
chances of victory depend upon the
ammunition of our side and the claws
of the other.
Chief claw of the Berkeley kin
dergarten collection is Chuck Hang- |
er, forward de luxs. "Coat" Hangar ;
has flipped innumerable baskets in ;
early frays against such competition !
as Lowell, St. Ignatius, and the i
Santa Clara freshman. In the Low
ell game, in which the Cal Babes
were as lucky as the devil to eke out
a 12-point win, 40-28, Mr. Hangar
was very extraordinarily unusual, j
collecting 17 points. ,
ST. IGNATIUS AFFAIR
In the St. Ignatius affair, which
was one of those slumber parties of
defensive tactics. Hangar hung some
9 points. Assisting claws in the
Berkeley organism will be forward
Bill DePaoli, center Bob Arnold,
and Larry Stewart and Claude His
key, guards.
High point of the Cal season was I
their win over the same Santa Clara
freshman who temporarily embar
rassed our squad by some 12 points.
But this was early in the season,
with both squads reporting a great
deal of development on floorwork j
and shot-pbtting since recent games, (
e.g., the Cards showing against
Lowell, Friday.
USUAL CARD STARTERS
Accompanying Head Hunter
Bengtson on the fur-fetching jaunt
will be the usual "Fearful Five"—
Parsons, Barsocchini, Heald, Hall,
and Dave Brown. All but Barsoc
chini were very much in evidence on
that cloudy fall day when the Cub
football eleven was lucky again,
this time 6 to 0. Hence, the blood
of the wee bear will salve a lot of
wounds.
