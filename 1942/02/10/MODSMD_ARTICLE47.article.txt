# Rugby Team To Battle Santa Rosa
## 
### 
After thumping the British l(>-5
in their first game of the season last
| Saturday, Stanford's varsity rugby j
team takes on Santa Rosa Junior
I College tomorrow at 4 p.m. This
game won't be a push-over for the
Indians.
Although not much is known
| about the strength of Santa Rosa,
the Britishers informed Coach Jim
I Wylie that they had trouble with
the J.C. team when they last met.
Last Saturday's game proved that
the Redmen could stand a little
I fundamental work in passing and |
kicking. The British ran rings
j around Stanford even though the j
Orion boys were outweighed and
outsized.
Only Stanford's power and speed j
' saved the day. On line-outs and I
1 scrums the Britishers had complete
advantage. After tomorrow's game !
with Santa Rosa, Stanford's schedule I
is an open book.
