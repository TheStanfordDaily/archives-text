## 
### 
Just how well the "Highboys" will
do in their first conference game out
of the local Pavilion will be seen
Friday night at Berkeley when Coach
Everett Dean's men play basketball
against the Bears.
Although the Californians lost to
U.C.L.A. Saturday night after they
had been forced into an overtime
period to win Friday night, the
Stanfords still have to cinch ahead
of them after their dismal showing
in the second game against U.S.C.
last week-end.
The Bears should be at their best
for the coming game since Captain
Roy Tamm, high scoring forward, is
back in good health after a short ill
ness. Another promising develop
ment for the Bears is the scoring
threat created by Guard Bob Ala
meida in their last few encounters.
Jim Pollard, lank Farmy forward,
turned over his conference indi
vidual scoring lead to Ernie Han
dlesman, U.C.L.A. forward. Pollard
added only eight digits to his lead
ing total of 43 the week before, while
Handlesman was sinking 53 points in
his two games with the Bears.
Handlesman's total of 65 is just
10 points ahead of Ed Voss's total.
In fourth place behind Handlesman,
Voss, and Pollard comes Bob Orms
by, Trojan co-captain, with 49 points.
California's pair of scorers, Ala
meida and Tamm, come next with
48 and 46 points, respectively, fol
lowed by Howie Dallmar's 44 points
