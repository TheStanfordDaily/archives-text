r |MCKETS for the basketball game
between tbe "Highboys" and Cal
at the Berkeley vegetable, fish,
penny, balloon, and basketball pa
! vilion next Friday night are on sale
at tlie B.A.C. from S to 5 today.
That's 7 to 4 if you haven't set your
watch up yet.
Some wise guy leaned over the |
: tunnel at the pavilion after Friday
night's basketball game and said to
Trojan Coach Sam Barry as he left
i the court, "Nice game, Sam."
To which Sam replied, '"Shucks. I
| didn't even work up a sweat." How
ever, I imagine he had quite a little
■ glow after Saturday evening's en
counter.
That statement plus numerous
ether things 1 have seen and heard
about Justin M. lead me to the
conclusion that lie is not the ogre
that everyone thinks he is.1
; can't say as much for John Lu
ber, though. Howie Dallmar got
j so perturbed at John's actions
| Saturday night that lie couldn't
function properly for several
! minutes.

r pHE LITERARIEST of all our
athletic faculty appears to be
Clayton Frye, boxing coach. Frye,
one of the best amateur fisticuffers
! of his time, recently wrote a book
| called "Practical Boxing," printed by
| the Stanford Press, which also puts
out The Daily in its spare time. Frye
has received offers from publishing (
j houses, but wants to try it out on t
the Stanford public before releasing |
it further. As an added attraction for j
freshmen, it has pictures. ,

A FTER last Saturday afternoon's j
rugby scrimmage with the
sailors from the H.M.S. Orion, the
lieutenant in charge of the team
ccnlided to Harry Maloney, dean
of the Farm coaching staff, that in
the many years of rugby experi
ence he had had, starting at Ox
ford many years ago, he had never
met a more sporting team than
that fielded by Stanford.
That statement was probably one
| of the neatest compliments ever )
given a Farm team. Even though j
! the Orion is leaving Mare Island
soon another game has been ar- ;
ranged for next»week. After the 28- j
0 fiasco California poured on the j
i tars two weeks ago, they' appre
ciated fair treatment.
