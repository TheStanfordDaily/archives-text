### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 9 (UP).-Polo,
the sport always hit hardest by war,
has quietly cancelled its three major
tournaments for 1942 and mapped
most remaining competition along
informal lines.
This was disclosed today by a
spokesman of the U.S. Polo Asso
ciation who estimated for the United
Press that "about 80 per cent" of
the country's 18.000 polo players
already have entered service.
He said that the association's
board of governors, at its last meet
ing, had called off the three most
important tournaments: the National
Open championship, scheduled for
Meadow Brook Club, Westbury,
N.Y., in early September; the Na
tional 20-goal championship slated
for August at a site to have been
selected; and the National Inter
circuit and 12-goal title tourney,
which would have been held at p.
suitable club in July.
