MIAMI BEACH, Fla., Feb. 9 (UP).
â€”Billy Conn will be given another
shot at the world heavyweight crown
worn by Joe Louis regardless of the
outcome of his match Friday night
in New York against Tony Zale,
promoter Mike Jacobs said today.

matched with Louis in June. He
said he didn't know who would be
