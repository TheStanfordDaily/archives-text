# A 						Day on the Quad
## 
### 
TODAY is just about like any other day—
we'll be wandering around the Quad going
to classes, talking to friends about intramurals
or a friend's engagement or maybe even the
war.
It will be just like any other winter quarter
day, except maybe the sun will be shining and
it will be nice and warm about 11 o'clock.
During the morning's meanderings or per
haps on the way to afternoon lab it might occur
to us that somebody was selling something or
that some sort of elections were being held, be
cause we noticed a couple of tables with dif
ferent colored papers on them, and we would
ask a friend about it.
This accidental recognition that something
was going on would probably be just coinci
dence.
We probably wouldn't know that this hap
pened to be one of the two election days of
the year, unless a friend happened along to
ask us to vote for one of his fraternity brothers.
Nor would we know, in all probability, that
there was also on the ballot an amendment
fashioned to mitigate the iniquities of the stupid
caucus system. We might not even know this
caucus system was responsible for "dealing"
so many misfits into so many important posi
tions of student leadership over a period of
years.
Nor, if we knew these things, would we care
very much.
We might not even take the trouble to vote,
even if we happened to have our student body
cards with us.
You see, we are Stanford men and women.
