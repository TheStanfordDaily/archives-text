# Pork-Barrel Pigs
## 
### 
AT a time when almost everyone is figuring
out ways and means to cut down unneces
sary expenditures, when almost everyone is
doing his part in the huge scale internal econ
omy to push the war effort, a Senate full of
selfish pork-barrelers votes itself an increase
in expenses. Imagine an extra $4500 a year for
"additional clerical assistance" at a time like
this. Such an act is not only dumb, it is cow
ardly. While Marines battle waves of Japanese
planes, while American newsboys and boot
blacks scrape up the price of a defense bond,
our fine, stalwart Senators calmly dip into the
till. After all, what is an additional $4500 a
year when the national debt for 1945 has been
envisaged as high as 750 billion? There un
doubtedly is some need for this increase. But
who doesn't need more for expenses these days
when you can't hire help for twice what you
used to pay. Certainly, the members of the
United States Senate can probably well use
$4500 APIECE, EACH YEAR. So could every
one else in the country.
But nothing the Senate does or can do abso
lutely requires the money that we pay our leg
islators. Everything else is being slashed in
Washington, from relief payrolls down to pub
lic building. The internal budget is being whit
tled down to nothing.
It must have really hurt the Representatives.
But everything was all right when the Senate
passed a bill declaring that Senators and Rep
resentatives are federal civil service workers
and, as such, are eligible for pensions. Then,
when the matter of internal economy was
brought up, the Senate quickly put the damper
on. Yes, they killed the Byrd committee report
on the amount of money which could be turned
to the war effort by slashing non-defense
projects.
It seems the boys are taking this "forget poli
tics for the duration" business too literally. The
action of the Senators certainly does not equal
an astute move toward re-election.—Hap Everett

"additional clerical assistance" at a time like
this. Such an act is not only dumb, it is cow
ardly. While Marines battle waves of Japanese
planes, while American newsboys and boot
blacks scrape up the price of a defense bond,
our fine, stalwart Senators calmly dip into the
till. After all, what is an additional $4500 a
year when the national debt for 1945 has been
envisaged as high as 750 billion? There un
doubtedly is some need for this increase. But
who doesn't need more for expenses these days
when you can't hire help for twice what you
used to pay. Certainly, the members of the
United States Senate can probably well use
$4500 APIECE, EACH YEAR. So could every
one else in the country.
But nothing the Senate does or can do abso
lutely requires the money that we pay our leg
islators. Everything else is being slashed in
Washington, from relief payrolls down to pub
lic building. The internal budget is being whit
tled down to nothing.
It must have really hurt the Representatives.
But everything was all right when the Senate
passed a bill declaring that Senators and Rep
resentatives are federal civil service workers
and, as such, are eligible for pensions. Then,
when the matter of internal economy was
brought up, the Senate quickly put the damper
on. Yes, they killed the Byrd committee report
on the amount of money which could be turned
to the war effort by slashing non-defense
projects.
It seems the boys are taking this "forget poli
tics for the duration" business too literally. The
action of the Senators certainly does not equal
an astute move toward re-election.—Hap Everett
AT a time when almost everyone is figuring
out ways and means to cut down unneces
sary expenditures, when almost everyone is
doing his part in the huge scale internal econ
omy to push the war effort, a Senate full of
selfish pork-barrelers votes itself an increase
in expenses. Imagine an extra $4500 a year for
"additional clerical assistance" at a time like
this. Such an act is not only dumb, it is cow
ardly. While Marines battle waves of Japanese
planes, while American newsboys and boot
blacks scrape up the price of a defense bond,
