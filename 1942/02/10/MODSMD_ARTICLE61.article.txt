r pHIS Libyan business is almost funny in its con
trast to the blazing horror of the Far East and
the grim inch-by-inch advance of the Russians across
the winter-bound flatlands. To the casual observer it
would seem that at present the Army of the Nile is
making a fool out of itself again. But there's more
in this Libyan thing than meets the eye.
Since the fall of 1940, the Axis has advanced across
Libya to the Egyptian border three times. Twice the
British have chased them clear back to Bengasi. Peo
ple are beginning to wonder it the boys are settling
down to a nice little round of you-chase-me-then-I'll
ehase-you for the duration.

IJOWEVEH, two vital factors are involved in the
African merry-go-round.
Tlie first of these is a matter of strategy. Alter all,
Libya, aside from its coastal cities and strategic value,
is nothing but a lot of sand. These cities—Salum, Bar
dia, Tobruk, Derna, Cirene, Bengasi, and El Agheila—
in order to be held, must not be flanked. But a regu
lar defense line across the desert can't be set up. The
dryest kind of warfare (desert) therefore is most
closely related 10 the wettest (sea). The idea is to
capture or destroy the enemy's equipment and men.
It must be a hit and run, shifting sort of business.
Because of this, a line of communications is extremely
difficult to set up and hold.
Each side can chase the other in turn, and will
probably continue to do so during the winter months
when the blistering heat subsides. But nothing what
ever can ever come of the Libyan campaign until either
the Axis or the British can muster an overwhelm
ingly superior force which will be able to fight its way
across the desert, and maintain its communications
against a flank attack.

INCIDENTAL INTELLIGENCE: Last week, some
British Tommies in Libya ran across a German
army magazine, left lying about by some Nazi soldier.
Under the heading, "Italian War Communique," was
the following:
"On the Tobruk front a large force of Italians
attacked one enemy cyclist causing him to dis
mount. After heavy prolonged fighting they were
able to puncture his tires. The front wheel was de
stroyed while the loss of the rear wheel must be
considered probable. The handlebars are in our
hands, hut the possession of the frame is still be
ing bitterly contested."
Poor old Italy. Nobody loves her.
