### MIKE CHURCHILL 
BUNDLES-FOII-CONGRESS
A MERICANS are the most gag-loving people on the
face of the earth. Give them something like
"knock-knock" and the "handies," and they will carry
it to unheard-of extremes.
A nationwide gag that is catching on almost as fast
as the Hut Sut song is the "Bundles for Congress"
drive.
The idea, it seems is a sarcastic gesture designed to
awaken Congress to the fact that their actions some
times fail to give evidence of their awareness to the
terrific emergency that has embraced this country.
It caught on and a great deal of trash has already
been delivered to Congress. According to the United
Press, the latest large-scale effort in this campaign
comes from Dallas, where the "Boneheads," a 60-year
old businessmen's club with the motto "to learn more
and more about less and less until we eventually know
everything about nothing," took up the idea.

r pHEIR first bundle contained a miniature motor
truck loaded with prickly Texas cockle burrs. A
telegram asked Speaker Sam Rayburn to use the
contents "in the proper places for congressmen where
it will do the most good." The 19th vice-president of
the club wired at the same time that "there are many
seats in Congress deserving attention."
John Horn, president of the Bonehead Club, stated
that if enough people contributed bundles he would
favor mailing them postage collect. "It would be a
sort of public franking privilege," he said.
The Bundles-for-Congress idea was first conceived
by the Athletic Roundtable of Spokane. They had to
abandon their particular project because of the cost
of sending trucks across the country with the hundreds
of packages of bristle toothbrushes, lenseless
glasses, broken phonograph records, worn-out girdles,
and the like."
