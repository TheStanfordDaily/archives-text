# CAMPUS OPINION
## THREE CHEERS FOR HALL AND ROW 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Man is by nature a gregarious animal. Through
out his life he longs for the companionship of others.
Given all the desired wealth, comfort and luxury, a
man would certainly be unhappy if he were forced
to live on a deserted island for the rest of his life.
On the contrary, the happiest man is the one who, in
spite of limited income and comfort, continues to enjoy
the privilege of sharing the happiness, as well as the
sorrows, of his fellows.
Therefore, those who have become members of fra
ternities should be congratulated. They should make
use of their environment and share the spirit of close
fellowship which no money can buy. With a little
simplicity and a little self-control, they will appre
ciate their four-year fraternity life, the memory of
which they will cherish throughout their lives.
On the other hand, for those who have not become
fraternity members, one would like to emphasize that
the fraternity constitutes merely one phase of a stu
dent's life. Although sports and social functions form
an important part of student life, they should be sub
ordinated to the larger task of acquiring knowledge.
The University offers many opportunities for stu
dents to participate-in its activities regardless of fra
ternity membership.
In this respect we are indeed fortunate to be stu
dents of Stanford, where, under a far-sighted and
liberal tradition, exists no distinction between frater
nity and non-fraternity men.
Many outstanding student leaders, including our
student body president, are non-fraternity men. More
over, dormitories, eating clubs, and other student
groups provide just as efficient accommodations as fra
ternities in general.
I repeat that the main concern of the student is
study. Ten or twenty years from now, a student will
realize that a fraternity membership, as compared to
the cultural training he has received at the Univer
sity, will have relatively little significance for him.
Those who feel socially independent and have limited
income, but who possess a strong will and the intel
lectual capacity to adjust themselves to changing con
ditions, can open up new frontiers and find their
haven anywhere.

dents to participate-in its activities regardless of fra
ternity membership.
In this respect we are indeed fortunate to be stu
dents of Stanford, where, under a far-sighted and
liberal tradition, exists no distinction between frater
nity and non-fraternity men.
Many outstanding student leaders, including our
student body president, are non-fraternity men. More
over, dormitories, eating clubs, and other student
groups provide just as efficient accommodations as fra
ternities in general.
I repeat that the main concern of the student is
study. Ten or twenty years from now, a student will
realize that a fraternity membership, as compared to
the cultural training he has received at the Univer
sity, will have relatively little significance for him.
Those who feel socially independent and have limited
income, but who possess a strong will and the intel
lectual capacity to adjust themselves to changing con
ditions, can open up new frontiers and find their
haven anywhere.

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Man is by nature a gregarious animal. Through
out his life he longs for the companionship of others.
Given all the desired wealth, comfort and luxury, a
man would certainly be unhappy if he were forced
to live on a deserted island for the rest of his life.
On the contrary, the happiest man is the one who, in
spite of limited income and comfort, continues to enjoy
the privilege of sharing the happiness, as well as the
sorrows, of his fellows.
Therefore, those who have become members of fra
ternities should be congratulated. They should make
use of their environment and share the spirit of close
fellowship which no money can buy. With a little
simplicity and a little self-control, they will appre
ciate their four-year fraternity life, the memory of
which they will cherish throughout their lives.
On the other hand, for those who have not become
fraternity members, one would like to emphasize that
the fraternity constitutes merely one phase of a stu
dent's life. Although sports and social functions form
an important part of student life, they should be sub
ordinated to the larger task of acquiring knowledge.
The University offers many opportunities for stu
dents to participate-in its activities regardless of fra
ternity membership.
