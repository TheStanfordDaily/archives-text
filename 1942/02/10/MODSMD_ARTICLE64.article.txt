# UNITED PRESS LISTENS IN
## 
### 

TO RECEIVE its own direct wireless-telegraph transmissions from
the Orient and to intercept communiques and claims of enemy powers,
United Press operates at San Francisco a complete wireless reception
plant. D. Reginald Tibbetts, noted electronics engineer and researcher,
who operates the "listening post" for U.P., is here shown intercepting
a news dispatch from Tokio.
