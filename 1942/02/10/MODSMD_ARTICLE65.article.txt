### 
...NEW YORK, Feb. !) (UP). —Flames raged uncontrolled for nearly lour
hours through the $60,000,000 former luxury liner Normandie today, gut
ting at least three decks and making useless for months the one-time
Fycneh sea queen which was being converted for war duty with the
U.S. Navy. ♦

Damage to the 83,432-ton vessel,
former favorite of diplomats and
movie stars, was estimated unoffi
cially to be at least $5,000,000. The
figure might be higher should it be
discovered that the intense heat had
buckled her plates.
One man was killed and approxi
mately 300 injured while fighting the
flames which broke out in the former
main lounge off the promenade
deck. Six of those hospitalized were
Navy men, the Third Naval District
announced.
When the fire broke out some
3,000 men were at work on the ship
which last Dec. 16 was taken over
by the Navy and the La
fayette after lying idle at her pier
since just before the outbreak of
war in August, 1939.
Eye-witnesses told dramatic stor
ies of escape from the flaming vessel.
Frantic men leaped many feet to
the dock, slid down ropes and even
lowered some of the remaining life
boats into the water.
