# Series Offers Indian Dancer Tonight at 7:30
## Te Ata Will Present Songs and Dances Of Native Folklore 
### 
Te Ata, noted representative of
Indian culture in the world today,
will present "Along the Moccasin
Trail" tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the
Auditorium.
Her all-folk-lore program will in
clude native songs, legends, dances,
chants, old translations, and sign
talk. She will wear different cos
tumes and will be accompanied by a
tom-tom.
Te Ata has traveled extensively in
Europe, has given several perform
ances in the White House, including
one when King George and Queen
Elizabeth made their American visit
in 1939, and has also played on
Broadway. She had the role of An
dromache in "The Trojan Women,"
and several lesser roles.
However, for the past several
years Te Ata has devoted herself
entirely to Indian folklore programs
which are her real interest, and
Queen Elizabeth was very interested
in the work which was being done
"to preserve the Indian's culture" in
America.
Te Ata has reduced her long and
beautiful Indian legends to their es
sential dramatic elements and pre
sents them in the space of a few
minutes to her modern American
audiences.
