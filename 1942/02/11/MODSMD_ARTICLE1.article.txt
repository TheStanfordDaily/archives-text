## Farm Favors Amendments As Large Offices Filled 
### BOB HANNAH 
Nine li uml red seventy Stanford voters went to the
polls yesterday, cast their votes, and thereby passed
two new constitutional amendments and elected 15
students to fill key campus officcs.
The hottest contest of the election, for sophomore

man on Exeom, went into nine-*
counts before it was definite that !
Dick Driscoll had the position in hns j
pocket, by edging Jack Reynolds, J
433-405. The name of Robert Hind,
a candidate for this position, was j
misspelled on the ballot, and forced j
Excom to consider a re-clection. I
But when the votes were counted, it j
was evident that Hind had dropped
out of the running early in the race,
so Excom decided to certify the ]
results as they stood.
15.A.C., YELL POSTS
Larry Dee outdistanced Ed Her
tcl and Tony Medved for the Board !
of Athletic Control position by pil
ing up GOG votes. Hertel followed
with 188, and Medved had 153. This 1
contest was decided in the first bal
lot.
"Doc" Colyear tallied 804 to Bud
Clary's 202, to win the yell leader
spot. Assistant yell leaders chosen
were Ken Anderson, 520; Jack Rei
ser, 587; and Bob Ashley, alternate,
473.
JUNIORS VIE
Early in the day it was evident
that one of the biggest battles on
the ballot was between Ray Ham
mett and Ralph Bjorklund for junior
maan on Excom. Hammet took the
lead in the second count, and came
in in the third to cinch the position
with 454 over Bjorklund's 414.
The amendments, which are to
Sections 1 and 3 of Article VII of
the Constitution, will change the
election days of winter and spring
quarters to Wednesday, instead of
Tuesday, and will reduce the nomi
nating period to one day, the Mon
day preceding the election. The
amendment to Section 1 passed by a
869-12G vote, and the Section 3
amendment passed by 755-248. Both
amendments received well over the
two-thirds majority necessary for
passage.
