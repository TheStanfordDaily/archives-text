# JAPS DRIVE ON SINGAPORE CITY
## 
### 

JAPANESE SHOCK TROOPS drove toward the city of Singapore yesterday from three directions and
military experts predicted its fall within 24 hours. Fresh Jap troops poured across Johore Strait in espe
cially-equipped boats, landed in the northwest corner <;f the island, and forced withdrawal of Imperial forces
from the jungle swamps of that area. Scene of main enemy landing was along the coast running west
from Kranii estuary. Just below the head of the estuary lies Tenga Airdrome, which the Japs captured
Monday, continuing their drive to within 8 miles of the city.
