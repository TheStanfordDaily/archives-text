# Situation on Bataan Peninsula Called 'Most Critical of War'

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (IJP).â€”Outnumbered and outgunned Ameri
can-Filipino forces on Bataan Peninsula reported two more local successes
against the Japanese today, but Japanese reinforcements were pouring
into the lines and the situation for the defenders was the most critical of
any time since the war began. a

No one doubted that the Japa- j
nese, pouring in troops, dive bomb
ers and heavy artillery, had launched
an all-out assault designed to blast
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's battle
weary forces from the fox holes of
Bataan and the fortresses in Manila
Bay and end quickly their costly
Philippines campaign.
REIN FC)RC: EM EN TS HEAVY
"Enemy reinforcements, which
have been particularly heavy during
the last few days, arc making their
presence in Bataan increasingly
evident," the communique said
ominously.
But the communique also con
tained ample proof that the Ameri
can-Filipino forces, inferior in all
but courage, still were lighting back
savagely.
A new Japanese attempt to land
troops on the peninsula from the
China Sea was repulsed and along
the west coast a counter-attack
cleared out Japanese troops which
had filtered through the lines.
PRESSURE INCREASES
"On the right there were sharp
patrol actions, while in the center
enemy pressure increased," the
communique said. "Fort Drum
(battleship-like fort in Manila Bay)
was under enemy artillery fire for a
brief period. Our counter-battery
fire is believed to have been effec
tive."
The communique, gloomy as its
essentials were, still brought mo
mentary relief after a day of anxi
ety in which it was feared that the
heavy Japanese pressure might
finally have cracked Mac Arthur's
line.
