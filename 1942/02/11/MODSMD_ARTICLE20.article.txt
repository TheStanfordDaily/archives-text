SINGAPORE, Feb. 10 (UP)
— Japanese shock troops
swarmed toward Singapore
City from three directions to
day and some military experts
predicted that the battle for
this island fortress may be
over by Wednesday noon.
The defenders still have
plenty of striking power left,
and they arc making the in
vaders pay dearly, but they do
not have air support and much
of the time they crouch in
ditches while Japanese fliers
dive-bomb and machine-gun
them at their leisure.
Front line maclnne-gun chatter
has been audible from the suburbs
all day as the Japanese approach
across the island from the north
and west. Now some activity has
broken out in a new direction,
No one admits that the situation
is hopeless, but the Singapore Free
Press said this morning that unless
the enemy can be thrown of! the
island in the next few hours, which

appears unlikely, a long and bloody
battle must be fought.
(The Tokyo radio predicted last
week that Singapore would be cap
tured by Feb. 11, which is Empire
Day in Japan—the 2,602 nd anniver
sary of the nation's founding.)
