# Heads Punish Encina Diners With Lockout
## Freshmen Refused Dinner after Failure To Obey Regulation 
### BILL DILLINGER 
Encina Commons, long strike
threatened by dissatisfied frosh, lit
erally turned the tables last night
by refusing admittance to about 80
would-be, diners. The lockout was
caused by the frosh's refusal to fill
up all the places in the main dining
halls, 7 and S, before seeking ad
mittance to the auxiliary rooms, 5
and 4.
The main rooms were opened as
usual at (5:15. but were only partially
filled, lhe students preferring to
pass by them to go to number 5.
Although repeatedly warned by
ticket-taker Ralph Schaffarzick that
11ii doors would not be opened until
the main rooms were filled, the
frosh persisted in their attempts to
â€¢jet into the auxiliary room, and as
a result, when all the doors were
closed, more than 80 freshmen were
locked out.
"It. is an official regulation that all
pi; ices in one dining hall must be
filled before another hall may be
opened," said Miss Doris Braddock,
dining hall director. "No students
will be admitted to 5 until 7 and 8
are completely filled, from now on,"
she added.
The effectiveness of the Commons'
strike was ruined by some of the
diners, who got into the room
.through the kitchen and opened the
doors from the inside to let the mob
in. The dining hall management was
then forced to feed them. Having
admitted some 80 to the hall, they
found themselves also unable to re
fuse food to about ten students who
stormed the main office, and thus no
frosh had to go without his supper.
