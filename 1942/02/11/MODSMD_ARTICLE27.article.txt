## 
### 
Last night Men's Vocom presented in the Encina lobby one of its most
interesting speakers. Dr. L. R. Chandler, dean of the School of Medicine,
who spoke on "The Future in Medicine."
"A doctor's life is a strenuous and often inconvenient one." said Dr.
Chandler, "and a man must so enjoy this profession that he will be will-

ing to endure the rubs which come,
with it."
"A doctor soon learns to leap ovit
of a sound sleep to answer a tele
phone, but also learns to sleep
through such unimportant noises as
fire engine sirens," said Dr. Chand
ler.
Although 5,000 new doctors are
graduated from medical school each
year, there is ah increasing need of
more, he pointed out. The doctor's
place in national defense is ex
tremely important, he added.
Increasing demand for veterinaries
was emphasized, and the opportuni
ties in this phase of medicine were
discussed.
After Dr. Chandler's talk, Ihe
meeting was opened to questions
and discussions.
Next Wednesday evening Carl S.
Ohliger will speak on "Advertising
as a Career" at the regular Vocom
program in Encina lobby. The time
has been changed to Wednesday so
as not to conflict with the Iturbi
concert.
