## Redskins, Santa Rosa Meet in Rugby Struggle 
### 
Today at 4 p.m. the Stanford rugby team meets Santa Rosa Junior Col
lege in (lie second game of the season. Coach Coak Cypher brings a J.C.
team down to the Farm that is composed mostly of veteran football play
ers. The Santa Rosa hunch are heavy and rugged and promise to give

the Stanford team plenty of trouble.*
Last Saturday the game between
Santa Rosa and California was called
oil because of the rain, so there is no j
opportunity to compare scores. Cal
beat the Britishers from the Orion
28-0 a couple of weeks ago but the j
Santa Rosa squad has not yet had a j
chance to play the bunch from Ber- J
keley. When the teams from the
Orion and Santa Rosa met, the j
Santa Rosa fifteen came out on top 1
with an 11-5 victory. The Stan- ■
fords beat the Britishers 1(5-5 last
Saturday.
KMET, AL COLE READY
Last week-end neither Pete j
Kmetovic or A1 Cole saw action, j
Both Pete and A1 got in a couple of
hours of practice this week, how- j
ever, and they ought to be ready to |
Jget in (She game this afternoon.
Saturday last the Redskins learned
how to play a lot of rugby when
they met the British.
Willard Sheller, George Jedenoff,
AI Wool, Ted Cole, Dud Smith, and j
Roger Laverty look especially good
for the Cards. The same team that j
started last Saturday will open the
game today.

Next Saturday the Stanford rug
gers will play the University of San
Francisco. The Stanford freshmen j
have a tentative game with Menlo
Junior College scheduled for the j
same afternoon. The San Francisco |
squad is composed of football play- j
ers who played first string for the
Dons last fall. The game with U.S.F. !
should be a better test for the Cards
than any of the previous games.
The little fellow with the striped
suit who runs around roferecing the
rugby games is Ralph Ebner, chair- j
man of the Referees Committee of j
the California Rugby League. Eb- 1
nor will supervise the tussle this
