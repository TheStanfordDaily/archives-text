# Frosh Nine Win First Tilt, 3-2
## 
### 
Behind the three-hit pitching of
Bill Brokaw, the freshmen inaugu
rated the 1942 Stanford baseball sea
son with a 3-2 victory over Com
merce High School of San Fran
cisco in seven innings yesterday on
the frosh diamond.
The freshmen played good defen
sive ball, giving up but three er
rors, considered to be very good for
early season form. The visitors gave
many scoring opportunities by their
weak fielding attempts.
Stanford's scoring came in the
third and fourth innings. Rainstad
opened the third with an unearned
run. He got to first on an error by
the third baseman, advanced to third
on Sandy Banks' single, and scored
on a fielder's choice. Banks, after
his single, got to second on a steal,
advanced to third on a fielder's
choice, and scored on Brokaw's
single.
Mark Caffal, left fielder, scored in
the fourth after he doubled, and ad
vanced to third and home on Com
merce errors.
Commerce's two runs came by
errors. The second visitor run came
after a three-bagger, the longest hit
of the day.
Stanford's six hits were gathered
by Banks, who got two, Brokaw,
Harry Masson, Caffal, and Rainstad.
Brokaw, who is tall and large,
showed good form and control for
the first game. He gave up but three
walks in the seven innings. He was
ably caught by Sandy Banks, who
was the big hitter for the day with
two singles.
Harry Wolter's varsity nine will
play their initial game Thursday
when they take on Gaddini's All-
Stars on the Sunken Diamond. Don
Pendergass, brilliant soph left
hander has returned to uniform
after being ill for several weeks with
a sinus infection. Wolter doubts
very much, however, if Don will see
action in Thursday's game.
