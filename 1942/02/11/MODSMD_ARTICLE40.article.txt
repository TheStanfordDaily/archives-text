# Coach Dean True to Idea Of Naismith
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Everett Dean of Stanford is a bas
ketball coach that can look an auto
graphed photo of Dr. James Nai
smith, founder of the sport, in the
| eye and know that he is teaching the
game as the Kansas physician hoped
J it would he taught. 4
j To develop a game that stresses
> bodily agility rather than brute
| strength and to train strategic
brains as well as brawny arms â€”
| these were the ideals of the father
of basketball. In his coaching work,
nationally as well as at Stanford,
i Everett Dean is known to stress and
I to strengthen these ideas.
HAS MANY LETTERS
Take a look at the desk of the six
: foot Indianan who guides the hopes
of Stanford sport fans against Cal
j Friday night. It is a collection of
letters from college coaches all over
the country, of graphs showing the
free-throw percentages and other
technicalities of last week's South
ern Cal series, and of reels of mo
tion pictures and charts of hoop
games that illustrate a new or old
point.
Besides the aforementioned tribute
from Naismith, over Dean's desk
hangs a copy of a code for basket
ball coaches, formulated by the same
National Association of College Bas
ketball Coaches which Dean has
done so much to aid as a board
j member and worker on three na
tional committees for several years.
Everett Dean explains basketball
strategy clearly and plainly in a
methodical, analyzing manner. He
talks about the much-discussed
"freeze tactics" used by Sam Barry
of Southern California in breaking
the latest of many Dean-team win
ning streaks, Saturday. Dean ana
lyzes the outcome as Stanford's
scoring weakness rather than the
| Southern Cal strategy.
CARDS WERE COLD
"Stanford was cold Saturday. That
| was the reason they lost. Any time
a team makes only 9 per cent of their
shots they are cold! The one time
that the S.C. down-court check
worked against our defense was on
Cowden's long pass. Their tactics
slowed up the game, but, if we had
been making 18 or 20 per cent of our
shots, we would have won."
An insight into the interest that
j the former Indiana University men
| tor takes in his Stanford players is
] gained in watching him discuss their
feats.
We talked about Jimmy Pollard's
j leg-stretching abilities. "It's his
! momentum that does it. It's tre
| mendous."
One of three telephone calls that
| interrupted us in 20 minutes occu
pied Dean with the task of getting
comfortable arrangements for the
: players on the Cal trip. He got
j them! As visitors and managers
came in and out of his office, he took
care of their questions, but he could
talk basketball up and down at the
same time.
PLAY AT CAL
The Cal question was predominant
in our minds. With typical Mid
western caution, Dean would make
no comment on the possibilities, ex
cept to say, "Cal will be playing on
their home court, and that's an ad
vantage. We have played over
there a couple of times, though."
In the Cal planning, in his sur
roundings, in his record, and in his
person, Everett Dean is a basket
ball player's coach. He can look John
| Naismith straight in the eye.
