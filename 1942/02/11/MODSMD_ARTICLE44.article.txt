# Frosh Cage Head Invigorates Club
## 
### 
Coach Phil Bengtson took over a
guard post on the frosh hoop quint
last night to snap up the practice
play of the yearlings who meet their
big rival, Cal, Friday night at 6:30
o'clock in Berkeley.
As far as is known, the frosh quint
will count heavily on its usual first
string five, with Herrick, Ferrog
giaro, and Hart well the reserves first
in line for service. Facing the frosh
will be a powerful Cub club that has
defeated the Santa Clara freshmen,
Lowell High, and others of the
stronger Peninsula clubs,
A return match will be played at
Stanford at the end of the season.
Last year, the series was an even
split.
