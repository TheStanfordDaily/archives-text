Cornelius Warmerdam is- j
sued the Hit! statement last
week that if the oilieials of the Mill
rose Games at Madison Square
(>arden would lent;!lien the runway
t«> 1.17 feet, he would guarantee them
a 15-foot vault, there was no little
hit of eyebrow raising by people
who like to do that sort of thing.
Okay, so he has done if on 12 dif
ferent occasions. All but one of
those were last year and this is the
first indoor meet of the year and
the indoor record is only 14-7.
Where does he get off arbitrarily
saying that he could do any time
what no one else has ever done?
Hrwevcr, the point of (his whole
thing is that he did do it. and on
his first try. Corney, or Dutch as
his intimates call liiin, has been
out of college for live years. By ■
this time the average track star
would have either hung up his
| spikes or be nearing the end. but
YVanuerdam keeps going on and
; up.
In his last year at Fresno State
College Warmerdam vaulted consist
ently around 13-6, in fact, that was
! die height at which he defeated In
j dian Vie Boore in the Stanford-
Fresno dual meet of that year. How
ever, nearing (lie end of the year in
the P.A.A.U. meet on Angell Field
he started his rise, clearing 14-4.
Even with his new-found talent
he could not compete with Tro- [
jans Earle Meadows and liill Scf
ton during the rest of the '37 sea
son, but the next year with Sefton
retired and Meadows not training
properly, Dutch took over the field
and started flirting with 15 feet,
an unheard-of height until that
time. In the last two years it has
gotten so (hat Hi feet is his goal,
while 15 feet is just a habit.
We've got two 13-6 vaulters in
school now. Maybe one of them
will blossom out.

the usual hectic week-end
in the Pacific Northwest bas
ketball circles, Washington's race
horse Huskies took over the lead
again after dropping it for two
nights. However, it was a win over
the doormat, Idaho, that gave them
back first place.
As a Stanford basketball fan, I
would like to see the Huskies take
the northern division title over
I W.S.C., Oregon, and 0.5.C., since
Hee Edmundson's boys are short
and speedy, unlike the Trojans that
stopped the Indians Saturday. Ore
gon State, with all five regulars re
turning this year, was slated to win,
but their height seems to be all they
have and they are finishing second
best quite often.
