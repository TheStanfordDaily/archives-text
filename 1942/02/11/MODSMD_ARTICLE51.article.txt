# Defeat Defeatism
## 
### 
WITH the teletype wires ticking out hourly
reports, the radios blasting "last-minute
bulletins," and the newspapers reporting daily
dispatches, little by little the American people
are learning how the British and Yankee fighters
are doing in the Far East.
Admittedly things aren't going as well as
most people expected. Admittedly many per
sons are getting discouraged. That old "We
can't expect to win with British tea-drinkers
fighting our war" attitude is springing up. That
is to be expected, but certainly not encouraged.
We must remember what Winston Churchill
said on his history-making trip to the United
States and repeated before the British Parlia
ment: "We are going to lose a lot of battles
now." He added that by 1943 the tide of battle
will turn in favor of the Allies.
That means there are going to be many more
discouraging defeats that are bound to lower
the general morale. This attitude of defeatism
has to be stamped out. We can't expect to win
a war with the odds already overwhelmingly
favoring the opposition when the people at
home—the backbone of the fighting spirit—
lack confidence in their leaders and fighters.
We are out to win this war. Let's all do our
share.—John Horrall
If we can genuinely argue that we have no
responsibility to offer our powerful protection
to brother human beings abroad against the
brutalities imposed upon them by the arro
gance and contempt of their conguerors, it
will be a short step to like argument in re
gard to our brethren at home.
. . . Nothing is clearer than that we shall
never be free from threats of war or from
war itself until intellectualism has accepted
the fact that no people can live to itself alone
in a world as small and as closely knit to
gether as our world has become.—President
Ernest Martin Hopkins, Dartmouth College
