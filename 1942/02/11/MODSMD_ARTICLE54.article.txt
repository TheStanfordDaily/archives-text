### AMIE REICHERT 
r JpHE impossible is about to happen, ladies and gen
tlemen. You don't need a crystal ball or a ouija
board to call this one, ladies and gentlemen. Singapore
is falling, and by the time this makes print it may
have already fallen.
Singapore, the mightiest fortress of the Far East,
the colossal symbol of Britain's power and supremacy,
is crumbling and giving way, and it's too late now to
do anything about it.
This is the blow that no one, even the most rose
bespectacled Pollyanna, can rationalize away.
This is the blow that H. R. Knickerbocker says
will prolong the war by five year::. This is the blow
that Walter Duranty said could never be landed. This
is the blow that the experts say will cost a million
lives to return.
This is a turning point, all right. It doesn't mean a
permanent, fatal reversal, although that, too, is more
than conceivable, but it does mean the greatest loss,
the worst catastrophe the Allies have yet faced. It
takes all sorts of superlatives to describe it because
this situation is unique, Singapore is unique, and
there's no such thing here as a comforting precedent
to point to.
♦ * * *
f HAVE a slight request to make in the midst of all
this tumult and shouting, please, and no one cares
whether you're interested or not. It is simply this:
Don't forget this. Piemember it in all its intensity and
pain and tragedy. Don't remember Singapore the way
we have remembered Pearl Harbor, which is to say,
don't forget Singapore the way we have forgotten Pearl
Harbor.
Remember Singapore and the unchallenged Japa
nese air force which dive-bombed its defenders, who
had scarcely a single plane to send up against the
enemy. Remember Singapore and remember the Japa
nese army which outnumbered its defenders, the great
numbers crushing the thin lines. Remember Singa
pore and consider the fact that we are losing the war
and we may yet lose it permanently.
Please, won't you all start worrying a little? Worry
a lot. That's what was the matter with the British
and still is. They remembered Dunkirk and Crete
and Greece and Libya and London and all they wor
ried about was the British Isles. They forgot to worry
about Singapore, and now it's the same story all over
again: too little and too late.
* * * *
i \NCE the mopping-up operations have been com
pleted the Japanese will be sitting pretty, prettier
than thty probably ever dreamed they would be. They
are probably just as surprised as the British and the
rest of the world.
Now they can start gobbling up Java, and Su
matra, and the rest of the Dutch Indies, and New
Guinea, and the next big Allied stand will probably
be in Australia.
There is of course a possibility that Singapore will
hold out a little longer—that is a chance hope that may
yet materialize. But it does not change the picture
appreciably, for even the British admit that the island
fortress will be lost at any moment now. The fact re
mains that Singapore is doomed, and it is only now a
matter of time. And not much time at that.

This is the blow that no one, even the most rose
bespectacled Pollyanna, can rationalize away.
This is the blow that H. R. Knickerbocker says
will prolong the war by five year::. This is the blow
that Walter Duranty said could never be landed. This
is the blow that the experts say will cost a million
lives to return.
This is a turning point, all right. It doesn't mean a
permanent, fatal reversal, although that, too, is more
than conceivable, but it does mean the greatest loss,
the worst catastrophe the Allies have yet faced. It
takes all sorts of superlatives to describe it because
this situation is unique, Singapore is unique, and
there's no such thing here as a comforting precedent
to point to.
♦ * * *
f HAVE a slight request to make in the midst of all
this tumult and shouting, please, and no one cares
whether you're interested or not. It is simply this:
Don't forget this. Piemember it in all its intensity and
pain and tragedy. Don't remember Singapore the way
we have remembered Pearl Harbor, which is to say,
don't forget Singapore the way we have forgotten Pearl
Harbor.
Remember Singapore and the unchallenged Japa
nese air force which dive-bombed its defenders, who
had scarcely a single plane to send up against the
enemy. Remember Singapore and remember the Japa
nese army which outnumbered its defenders, the great
numbers crushing the thin lines. Remember Singa
pore and consider the fact that we are losing the war
and we may yet lose it permanently.
Please, won't you all start worrying a little? Worry
a lot. That's what was the matter with the British
and still is. They remembered Dunkirk and Crete
and Greece and Libya and London and all they wor
ried about was the British Isles. They forgot to worry
about Singapore, and now it's the same story all over
again: too little and too late.
* * * *
i \NCE the mopping-up operations have been com
pleted the Japanese will be sitting pretty, prettier
than thty probably ever dreamed they would be. They
are probably just as surprised as the British and the
rest of the world.
Now they can start gobbling up Java, and Su
matra, and the rest of the Dutch Indies, and New
Guinea, and the next big Allied stand will probably
be in Australia.
There is of course a possibility that Singapore will
hold out a little longer—that is a chance hope that may
yet materialize. But it does not change the picture
appreciably, for even the British admit that the island
fortress will be lost at any moment now. The fact re
mains that Singapore is doomed, and it is only now a
matter of time. And not much time at that.
r JpHE impossible is about to happen, ladies and gen
tlemen. You don't need a crystal ball or a ouija
board to call this one, ladies and gentlemen. Singapore
is falling, and by the time this makes print it may
have already fallen.
Singapore, the mightiest fortress of the Far East,
the colossal symbol of Britain's power and supremacy,
is crumbling and giving way, and it's too late now to
do anything about it.
