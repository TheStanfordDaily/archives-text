### MIKE CHURCHILL 
HELLO. GIRLS
A FELLOW I know falls madly in love every so
often with the same Stanford girl, and each time
he reasons himself out of this one-sided situation as
follows:
"What would be the use of marrying a Stanford
girl anyway? For four years they adjust their lives
to a situation where there are always at least two
men to every girl, and women's activities are for the
uninformed.
"A fellow marrying a Stanford girl would be afraid
to go to the office and leave her alone all day. Un
like other girls, she couldn't interest herself in wom
en's organizations and charity work. He would doubt
lessly come home to find that she had invited half his
fraternity in for cocktails."
Girls, look at it this way. For quite a few years
you are going to find the male population is severely
rationed. The government has given the armed serv
ices full priority on men. What arc you going to do
with your time?
If some boy you know has been drafted or has
joined some branch of the services then you prob
ably know that there is a war going on.
Did it ever occur to you that you might be able
to help? When you consider that defeat would mean
conquest, the women ought to be more anxious to
help the war effort than the men.
There are 1100 women at Stanford; 135 of them
have volunteered through the Y.W.C.A. to knit for
the soldiers and sailors. The University has a first
aid class for which it gives credit. This has 150 women.
It also has a home nursing course without credit. This
has 17 women.
I wonder if any fellow has ever had a girl say,
when he asks her to go to the City, that because of
the war and shortages she would just as soon go to
a show.
It would be interesting to know how many Stan
ford girls have ever bought a defense stamp or bond.
The government is telling the men how best they
may serve their country. Because it is not doing the
same for women there is no basis for an assumption
that there is nothing for women to do in the war.
Stanford women should first become conscious of
this war. Then through their living groups and or
ganizations make some effort to help win it.

conquest, the women ought to be more anxious to
help the war effort than the men.
There are 1100 women at Stanford; 135 of them
have volunteered through the Y.W.C.A. to knit for
the soldiers and sailors. The University has a first
aid class for which it gives credit. This has 150 women.
It also has a home nursing course without credit. This
has 17 women.
I wonder if any fellow has ever had a girl say,
when he asks her to go to the City, that because of
the war and shortages she would just as soon go to
a show.
It would be interesting to know how many Stan
ford girls have ever bought a defense stamp or bond.
The government is telling the men how best they
may serve their country. Because it is not doing the
same for women there is no basis for an assumption
that there is nothing for women to do in the war.
Stanford women should first become conscious of
this war. Then through their living groups and or
ganizations make some effort to help win it.
HELLO. GIRLS
A FELLOW I know falls madly in love every so
often with the same Stanford girl, and each time
he reasons himself out of this one-sided situation as
follows:
"What would be the use of marrying a Stanford
girl anyway? For four years they adjust their lives
to a situation where there are always at least two
men to every girl, and women's activities are for the
uninformed.
"A fellow marrying a Stanford girl would be afraid
to go to the office and leave her alone all day. Un
like other girls, she couldn't interest herself in wom
en's organizations and charity work. He would doubt
lessly come home to find that she had invited half his
fraternity in for cocktails."
Girls, look at it this way. For quite a few years
you are going to find the male population is severely
rationed. The government has given the armed serv
ices full priority on men. What arc you going to do
with your time?
If some boy you know has been drafted or has
joined some branch of the services then you prob
ably know that there is a war going on.
Did it ever occur to you that you might be able
to help? When you consider that defeat would mean
conquest, the women ought to be more anxious to
help the war effort than the men.
