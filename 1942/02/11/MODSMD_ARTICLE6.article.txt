# Misspelled Names, 'Sloppy Counting' Hit in Session
## 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Misspelling of three names on yesterday's winter
election ballots turned last night's Excom meeting into
an all-evening afTair with Excom finally resolving it
self into a committee to count the ballots for sopho
more man on Excom.

The three misspelled names, Tony
Medved, George Toltnan, and Bob
Hind, brought about the question
whether or not a new election should
be held.
The dispute finally narrowed down
to sophomore man because Tolman
was elected to Men's Council and
Medved was obviously out of the
race for B.A.C. representative.
STUDENT DISCUSSION
Ray Hammett, newly elected jun
ior man, said, "Most people who
would have voted for Hind would
have voted for him no matter how
his name was spelled."
On the other hand, Nancy Burkett
remarked, "The name 'Kind' mayi
not mean a thing when 'Hind'
would."
Charlie Bull consulted the A.S.-
S.U. constitution, and finding no
provision for mistakes in elections,
moved that Excom count the results
for sophomore man. In seconding the
motion Betty Binns remarked, "We
might just as well learn the system
anyway."
COUNTING CONTINUED
After more than an hour of count
ing Excom approved the election of
all officers as reported by Jim White,
head of election board.
President George Jackson issued
the following statement: "It is the
discretion of Ex Committee that the
misspelling of Bob Hind's name
wouldn't have made any difference
because he went out on the fourth
count with 52 votes."
While the ballots were being
counted for the othe* - offices, Char
lie Bull, Ralph Clark, and Pat Ad
ams went into the room where the
ballots were being checked.
"It was awful sloppy down there,"
Bull said.
CHANGES SUGGESTED
Then Clark: "For an honest-to-
God fact I saw three mistakes made
on Men's Council alone. And on
top of that there were only seven out
of the 30 members of election board
helping."
Bull concluded by saying, "Some
time ago I suggested that the votes
be counted in a closed room, but
that wouldn't he right because I don't
know what we'd do if some inter
ested person wasn't there."
Jackson suggested that a commit
tee be appointed to look into the
matter, but no definite action was
taken.
Other action taken by Excom last
night will be printed in tomorrow's
Daily.
