# Senior Prom Definitely Scheduled for Feb. 27; Larry Cannon Will Play
## Partus Garden's Night' to Be Theme Of Final Big Senior Class Affair; Ticket Sale Begins Early Next Week 
### 
Rumors and doubts have finally been dispelled. The rumpus-raising
Senior Prom will go on as scheduled—an all-campus, formal dance in the
Pavilion on the night of Friday, Feb. 27.
The air was cleared of all doubt yesterday afternoon with the an
nouncement by newly-appointed Co-Chairman Johnny Shores of the

signing 01 Larry Cannons band
play for the traditional big dance
of winter quarter.
Jane Ellen Marks, co-chairman
with Shores, disclosed that students
need not worry about the Senior
Prom being a "cheap" dance just
because the price was lower than
ever in the past—s2 per couple.
'"The band is a good one," she
said, "and expenses are being cut
where they will show the least."
CACTUS GARDEN NIGHTS
Decorations Chairman Doris Smith
stated that decorations carrying out
the novel theme of "A Night in the
Cactus Gardens" will equal those of
any past prom.
Reasons given for this choice of
theme showed that so many Stan
ford students were unaware of the
natural beauties of this part of the
Stanford campus that it was felt
appropriate to duplicate the charms
of Cactus Gardens in the Pavilion,
particularly for seniors who will be
leaving Stanford soon.
TICKETS ON SALE SOON
Tickets will be on sale at the A. S.
S. U. office early next week, Shores
stated.
Class President Bill Cowden re
minded seniors, "Although this is an
all-campus dance, it is also the last
big class affair before Senior Week
and graduation. 1 hope that every
member of the class will be on hand
so that it will really be a senior
prom."
