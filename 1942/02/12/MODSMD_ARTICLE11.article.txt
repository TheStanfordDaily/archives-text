# Buck Rides Again Sunday
## 
### 
Overflowing into the balcony, the
crowd of 1,000 which saw "Anna
Christie" in Memorial Hall last Sun
day night broke all records for Sun
day Scries attendance since the scries
has been presented at Stanford in
termitently over a period of years.
Barbara Sadler has arranged for
two special short subjects to fill out
the bill of this Sunday's show "News
Highlights of 15)41" and "Football
Highlights of 1941."
"The Enemy's Stronghold," chap
ter three of the sensationally suc
cessful serial, "Buck Rogers," with
Buster Crabbc as Buck, will be
shown.
Thrown in for good measure will
be Charles Laughton in "The Pri
vate Life of Henry VIII." This is an
authentic depiction of the famous
English king and his six ill-fated
queens.
It is a picture which landed unani
mously in the "best ten of the year,"
and was not only one of the more
wildly-heralded Laughton triumphs,
but also established such names as
Merle Oberon, Wendy Barrie, Rob
ert Donat, and Director Alexander
Korda.
It will be the third in the bi
weekly Sadler Sunday Series, and
will play in Memorial Hall at 7:15
for 20 cents a head.
