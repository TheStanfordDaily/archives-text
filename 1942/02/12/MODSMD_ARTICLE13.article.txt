# Farm Alumni Drive Closing
## 
### 
All solicitors in the Senior Alum
ni Membership drive are urged by
committee heads Peggy Perring and
Bill Smith to turn in their sales re
sults and to push their sales efforts
during these last two days of the
drive.
Alumni Secretary Bones Hamilton
requested all those soliciting mem
berships to read over their instruc
tion sheets so they will be able to
answer all questions which may be
asked by members of the class re
garding benefits of the association,
deferred payment plans, and why
every senior should start the pur
chase of his life membership now.
The drive which started last Mon
day and will continue through to
morrow, allows seniors to purchase
life memberships in the Alumni As
sociation at the reduced rate of $50,
payable in five yearly payments.
After the drive is over, member
ships will cost $60.
If seniors do not wish to take out a
membership, solicitors are reminded
by the committee to fill out all the
required information on the perma
nent record cards for the alumni
file.
