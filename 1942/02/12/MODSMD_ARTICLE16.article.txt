(Editor's Note: The following is
probably the last news dispatch
from Singapore, filed by a mem
ber of the United Press staff who
indicated that lie was going to
stay in the beleaguered city.)

United Press Staff Correspondent
SINGAPORE, Feb. 11 (UP).—Now
I know what it must have been like
in Hone Kong, Manila or Dunkirk.
Overhead, hour after hour, come
the enemy planes. They roar down
and strike at the railroad station
and harbor. At those places—and
others in this once-prosperous city
—men and women, yes, even chil
dren. arc showing that they, too,
can IHi heroes even in the darkest
hour.
The battle moves ever closer to
Singapore city.
Soldiers returning from the front
(apparently in the western suburbs)
wipe the sweat from their grimy
faces and say that the fighting is
unusually severe—often at close
quarters with bayonets.
Enemy planes zoom over the for
ward lines in large numbers. They
emphasize the repeated plea of Im
perials for air support.
VIEW FROM ROOFTOP
Last night, I climbed to a rooftop
and watched and listened to the bat
tle almost until dawn.
Over the horizon to the north and
northwest there was an undulating
glow of fire. But from that direc
tion there was comparative silence.
To the east, the darkness was
punctuated by a steady barrage of
gun flashes. It was from British
artillery pounding at the invaders. A
few seconds after the flashes, the
thunderous rumble of those guns
reached our ears.
COMES THE DAWN
Then came the dawn.
Clouds of black smoke (possibly
from burning oil at the naval base)
drifted along the northern horizon.
But the city—living up to its na
tive name of Singhapura "City of
the Lion"—was not tremendously
confused.
Civilians started out to business
early—just as they had in days long
past when there was peace on
earth.
RAID SIRENS SCREECH
Shortly before breakfast, the air
raid sirens screeched an alert.
Activity in the harbor was in
tensified.
The radio continued to broadcast
at intervals.
Communications are such that I
will be unable to answer some of
your messages.
Give my regards to Guard.
Goodby.
