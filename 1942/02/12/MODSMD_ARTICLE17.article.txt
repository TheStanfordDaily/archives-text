In the Netherlands Kast Indies,
they made new landings on Celebes
Island, thus increasing the danger
to vital Socrabaja, the only naval
stronghold left to the Allies be
tween Australia and India.
In Australia, men up to IS years
of age were called to the colors as
the nation prepared for a Jap in
vasion attempt.
Only in the Philippines did the

this front the "terrific losses" im
posed by General Douglas Mac-

for the letting up of the Jap of
fensive yesterday.
In Russia, another step in the
Soviet's attempt to put a "pincer

when lied ski troops gliding nine
