### 
TOKYO, Feb. 11 (Radiocast recorded by UP in New
York). —Japanese forces entered the city area of Singapore
at 8 a.m. Wednesday (6 a.m. Singapore time or 6 p.m. Tuesday
CWT) and now are mopping up British remnants in fierce
hand-to-hand fighting, the army section of the imperial head
quarters asserted tonight.
(The Paris radio was heard in London broadcasting that
Singapore City's railway station, commercial harbor and sev
eral districts in the western part of the city were in flames.)
The Japanese broke into the city, it added in a communi
que, only after "frustrating stubborn enemy military resist
ance."
(The Oslo radio, heard in London, said Japanese troops
had entered the western part of Singapore City at 2 p.m.
Tokyo time.)
LONDON, Feb. 11 (UP). —Singapore's defenders ignored
a Japanese demand for unconditional surrender tonight and
held on grimly under an incessant rain of bombs and shells,
it was announced in a communique from the embattled city.
Imperial troops still were fighting bitterly west and north
west of the city, the communique said, and the Japanese de
mand for surrender, dropped in notes from airplanes, went
unanswered.
It said "there has been some infiltration today," but official
spokesmen here said that did not necessarily mean that the
Japanese had entered Singapore City, despite Japanese and
German claims to the contrary.
