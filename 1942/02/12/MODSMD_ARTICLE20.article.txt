WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 (UP).—
Admiral Thomas C. Hart of the U.S.
Navy has been relieved of command
of the United Nations naval forces in
the Far East at his own request and
replaced by a Netherlands naval
chieftain, it was announced today.
Named acting commander in Ad
miral Hart's place was Vice Admiral
C. E. I. Helfrich of the Royal Nether
lands Navy, which has been playing
a valorous role in the naval warfare
in the far Pacific, battling to stem
Japan's pounding drive southward.
ONLY FOUR DAYS
The surprise replacement of Ad
miral Hart, for reasons of illness, was
announced only four days after the
Navy formally had stated that the
04-year-old naval commander had
been placed in charge of the com
bined Allied naval forces in the
ABDA Pacific area.
The United Nations' naval forces
in the southwest Pacific include
those of the United States, Britain,
the Netherlands and Australia.
NOT RETIRING
A naval spokesman explained that
Admiral Hart's request to be relieved
because of ill health did not mean
that Admiral Hart is retiring from
the U.S. naval service, although he
passed the usual retirement age last
year. The Navy also said that Ad
miral Hart actually had been ex
ercising the united command in the
ABDA area since Jan. 17.
The 55-year-old Admiral Helfrich,
who has spent most of his life in
command of Dutch naval forces in
the Far East, was named command
er-in-chief of the Dutch East Indies
Navy—a small but fiercely effective
fleet—in January, 1940, after the fall
of Holland. Born in Scmarang, Java,
he is well acquainted with the pres
ent battlefront reaching from Singa
pore down to Australia.
