## 
### 
What did Stanford think upon hearing the news of Singapore's fall?
The Daily went out yesterday and asked at random a number of per
sons on campus what their reaction to the fall of Singapore was. Here are
sonic of the answers to that question:

Clifford Weigh*, assistant professor,
of journalism: "My main hope is
that this selves to warn the Ameri
can people of what's ahead. We'd
better get off the dime."
Virginia Dillingham, freshman:
"I'd like to know where our navy
was —or is?"
Don Facciolla, laborer: "It's gonna
be pretty goddam tough now that
they got Singapore. We ought to
draft everyone here and go out and
clean 'em up."
VERY SAD
Florence Funsten, senior: "I think
it's very sad and I think that with
all Britain has to do, it's, too bad that
this had to happen too."
Peter Keesmaat, clerk in the Un
ion Cellar store: "Just like every
body else, it looks pretty bad to me."
Howard H. Quint, assistant in his
tory: "The fall of Singapore will
prolong the war at least two years
and gives Japan complete control of
the Pacific bastions of defense. Japan
is in a better spot than Germany
right now."
WHAT NEXT?
Bill Perkins, junior: "What are
we going to do next?"
Clarice Bjornehy, graduate stu
dent in English: "I don't think that
the war's a reality in people's minds
yet, but this may help to wake us
up."
Russell McKeand, janitor (and
veteran of the last war): "Some
body's asleep."
Theodore Chadwick, sophomore:
"I think it's awful, but if it hadn't
fallen it would have been just so
much more murder."
Philip W. Harsh, associate pro
fessor of classics: "It seems too bad
that the English lost Singapore in
something like nine days while the
Russians held Sevastopol for months
and months."
Shirley Wendt, senior: "I think
it's a dam shame."
Joe Morin, senior: "Japan's mari
time policy would dictate a drive
against Australia. After that . . . ?"
BRITISH WEREN'T READY
John Callander, freshman: "The
British weren't too ready and ap
parently have placed their troops
on the wrong fronts. Furthermore,
the experience of the Japs in China
has told upon the British."
Boh Breckner, senior: "Japan is
using the same tactics that Germany
has taught them and we're really up
against something serious. I think
this will wake people up a bit."
Peyton Wahnsley, campus cop: "It
indicates that we are going to have
to take the initiative in this war and
that it isn't just our equipment but
als our men that are going to have
to be used."

What did Stanford think upon hearing the news of Singapore's fall?
The Daily went out yesterday and asked at random a number of per
sons on campus what their reaction to the fall of Singapore was. Here are
sonic of the answers to that question:

Clifford Weigh*, assistant professor,
of journalism: "My main hope is
that this selves to warn the Ameri
can people of what's ahead. We'd
better get off the dime."
Virginia Dillingham, freshman:
"I'd like to know where our navy
was —or is?"
Don Facciolla, laborer: "It's gonna
be pretty goddam tough now that
they got Singapore. We ought to
draft everyone here and go out and
clean 'em up."
VERY SAD
Florence Funsten, senior: "I think
it's very sad and I think that with
all Britain has to do, it's, too bad that
this had to happen too."
Peter Keesmaat, clerk in the Un
ion Cellar store: "Just like every
body else, it looks pretty bad to me."
Howard H. Quint, assistant in his
tory: "The fall of Singapore will
prolong the war at least two years
and gives Japan complete control of
the Pacific bastions of defense. Japan
is in a better spot than Germany
right now."
WHAT NEXT?
Bill Perkins, junior: "What are
we going to do next?"
Clarice Bjornehy, graduate stu
dent in English: "I don't think that
the war's a reality in people's minds
yet, but this may help to wake us
up."
Russell McKeand, janitor (and
veteran of the last war): "Some
body's asleep."
Theodore Chadwick, sophomore:
"I think it's awful, but if it hadn't
fallen it would have been just so
much more murder."
Philip W. Harsh, associate pro
fessor of classics: "It seems too bad
that the English lost Singapore in
something like nine days while the
Russians held Sevastopol for months
and months."
Shirley Wendt, senior: "I think
it's a dam shame."
Joe Morin, senior: "Japan's mari
time policy would dictate a drive
against Australia. After that . . . ?"
BRITISH WEREN'T READY
John Callander, freshman: "The
British weren't too ready and ap
parently have placed their troops
on the wrong fronts. Furthermore,
the experience of the Japs in China
has told upon the British."
Boh Breckner, senior: "Japan is
using the same tactics that Germany
has taught them and we're really up
against something serious. I think
this will wake people up a bit."
Peyton Wahnsley, campus cop: "It
indicates that we are going to have
to take the initiative in this war and
that it isn't just our equipment but
als our men that are going to have
to be used."
