# Revised Cal Hoopsters Face Fighting Card Five In Crucial Title Series
## 
### 
Judging from California's basketball games of the last two weeks, the
team that Stanford meets at Berkeley tomorrow night will he vastly dif
ferent than the one the "Highboys" defeated so easily three weeks ago.
As Coach Everett Bean plans for the season's second game against the
Hears, he is taking into consideration the role that two tail sophomores.

Jack Ricker and Orel! Saffores, will.,
play. Neither of these men saw ac
tion in the first Card-Bear fracas,
but after three consecutive defeats
Be rkeley Coach Nibs Price staged a
few radical changes before going
south last week-end to meet U.C.L.A.
NEWCOMERS WILL PLAY
Although Rocker and Saffores are
not expected to start at their left
forward and center positions, they
will undoubtedly see considerable
action, if their play against the
Bruins is any indication.
With the definite benching of Bill
Farley, 6-8 center, Price will need
added height to meet Dean's men
and Rocker and Saffores have an
advantage in this respect over Merv
Lafaille and Bob Biles, the men for
whom they will substitute.
TIIURM PROMOTED
Another change that has occurred
in the Cal line-up in the last two
weeks is the promotion of Dave
Tluirm to first-string guard over Jim
Bailey. Bailey along with Farley
had been averaging only a few points
in every game, while Thurm in a
lew minutes of play looked so im
pressive that Price injected him into
the starting line-up.
Since both teams were beaten in
their last outings, neither will have
a psychological advantage over the
other, although Cal will have the
edge of playing in their own gym,
midst the rolls of stationery, fish
and other sundry articles which
often find their way to the floor.

Money talks! United States Defense
Savings Bonds and Stamps shout
"Victory."
