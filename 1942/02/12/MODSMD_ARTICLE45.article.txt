# Frosh Quint to Face Poly High On 'Morning After' Cal Cubs
## 
### 
Polytechnic High School, affording; to San Francisco sports scribes
the champion-to-be in that city's strong hoop league, will meet Phil
Bengtson's Stanford freshman cagers on Saturday in the Stanford Pavilion.
It will be the "morning after" or the "mourning after'' for the local
yearlings who will face the prepsters in tired condition after the Cal-Card

frosh battle Friday night. It seems i
queer that the schedule makers
i would schedule two such tough
: teams on the same week-end, but
I the purpose of frosh ball is to train
1 varsity prospects, and in the big
leagues the strong teams are apt to
play plenty of one week-end double
headers.
POLY HAS EVERYTHING
Poly has everything that it takes
ito beat our boys. Both the fact
' that the Cal battle is the night be
fore and the towering of such play
j ers as Ernie Filiberti will give the
frosh a rugged battle.
Going out on the limb, it would
; not be too much to anticipate that a
win from Cal would be followed by
! a let-down that would hand Poly
High the Saturday tilt and, con
versely, if "Coat" Hangar can lead
the Cubs to a victory Friday, that
| the Poly team may very likely be
j dumped on sheer anger.
PAPOOSE PRACTICE
The frosh approach the gruesome
j twosome with a week of strenuous
practice behind them and a record
of six wins in eight starts. Fast
break plays and defense tactics have
[ occupied the sessions for the Heald
! Hall - Parsons - Barsocchini - Brown
[ set-up this week.
First string and the reserves are
i looking as good as at any time dur
-1 ing the season, and the Card juniors
will be at their peak for the tilts
ahead. Question . . . How high is
their peak?
