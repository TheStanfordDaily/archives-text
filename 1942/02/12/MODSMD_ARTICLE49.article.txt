! r is a man in this vicinity I
[ who is a bigger Stanford booster
| than any of the buck-a-monthers.
Although he isn't an alumnus—by a
long shot—he spends all of his time,
[ when he's not out surveying our
j teams, making contacts with out
-1 standing prep and jay see stars all
over the state. The man is Mayfield
Ike.
Ike goes unshaven and wears tat
! tered clothes as a blind so he can
go about his proselyting work un
| molested. There is just one unhappy
t detail in this beautiful word-pic
j ture. In line with his disguise, Ike
never has any money on his person,
and consequently can't pay to see
his boys play. But after all he has
i done for the Farm you wouldn't
! think HE would need money. The
B.A.C. would naturally supply him
! with a lifetime pass.
But they don't.

I r honor of being Southern
| California's "Athlete of the
Year" for 1941 went to Frankie Al
j bert, who played football for Stan
ford last fall. It is quite a tribute
; for the Southerners to give the oscar
: to a Stanfordite, even though he
i does hail from Glendale.
Sometimes they reach pretty far
down there to present their award.
Frinstance, several years ago they
gave the award to Alice Marble, who
had passed through L A. on a train
that year.

In 28 minutes, with elbow smashes
and a headlock, Vincent Lopez de
j feated "Iron Mike" Ma/.urki in thi
Coliseum Bowl last night. This was
another step in his campaign to re

I tling title.
! r is a man in this vicinity I
[ who is a bigger Stanford booster
| than any of the buck-a-monthers.
Although he isn't an alumnus—by a
long shot—he spends all of his time,
[ when he's not out surveying our
j teams, making contacts with out
-1 standing prep and jay see stars all
over the state. The man is Mayfield
Ike.
Ike goes unshaven and wears tat
! tered clothes as a blind so he can
go about his proselyting work un
| molested. There is just one unhappy
t detail in this beautiful word-pic
j ture. In line with his disguise, Ike
never has any money on his person,
and consequently can't pay to see
his boys play. But after all he has
i done for the Farm you wouldn't
! think HE would need money. The
B.A.C. would naturally supply him
! with a lifetime pass.
But they don't.

I r honor of being Southern

i does hail from Glendale.
Sometimes they reach pretty far

Frinstance, several years ago they
gave the award to Alice Marble, who

that year.
