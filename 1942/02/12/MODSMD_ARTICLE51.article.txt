# Election 'Butch'
## 
### 
MOST of the student body is willing to grant
there is something wrong with the elec
tion systemâ€”its voting members proved this
Tuesday when they passed the amendments
to the constitution.
ihere is still plenty of room to doubt this
action will solve the caucus problem, but there
is something else which demands immediate
attention.
The student body should know that the
administration of Tuesday's elections was
"butched" by Election Board.
In the first place anyone who was one of
those who voted, and that number was less than
one-fourth of the student body, knows there
were three names misspelled on the ballots.
The reason might be that an inexperienced
member of Election Board was told to have
the ballots printed, and then didn't think to
check the proofs before giving the printers the
"go-ahead" signal. In the event the copy, or
names furnished the printer, had all names
spelled correctly, Election Board should be
advised that it should not pay the printing bill,
because the printers are expected to check
proofs with copy before printing.
In the second place the counting of ballots
Tuesday afternoon was inefficient. One Ex
Committee member reported he, personally,
watched Election Board members make three
mistakes. Another Ex Committee visitor to the
tabulating room said, "It was awful sloppy."
Election Board is reguired to work in an open
room, subject to inpection by any interested
person. Tuesday's reports show this ruling is
probably a good thing. On the other hand,
they might avoid confusion if they worked in
a closed room, providing the counting system
was accurate.
As for the counting system now used for the
preferential ballot. Ex Committee members who
counted the soph man on Excom ballots at their
meeting now have a pretty good idea there is
room for inaccuracies. There were ten men
running for the spot; the race went to the ninth
count. When ballots are shuffled around nine
times, the percentage of error is bound to rise.
Under this method, one or two persons should
check the counter as he tabulates the votes and
apparently this could not be done by Election
Board Tuesday because only eight or ten out
of thirty members of the board were present in
the counting.room.
In addition to the point made in this morn
ing's Bull Session, this brings up the considera
tion that the preferential system defeats its own
ppurpose when it allows as many as ten candi
dates to run for an office. We hate to admit
they should be whittled down to five or six
persons by a caucus, and this leaves a nominat
ing committee or a primary election as the
answer.
Another bad feature of the preferential system
is that it provides opportunity for voters who
don't take the election seriously to mark their
first choice, and then proceed to mark the ballot
in a geometrical pattern, either in ascending
or descending order. It looks so pretty to see
all those little X's in a row.
Ex Committee realized Tuesday night there
was something wrong. Election Board didn't
seem to be very unhappy about the situation.
Ex Committee spent an hour counting ballots
to decide whether to approve the soph man
election, and spent a good deal more time dis
cussing what was wrong with the winter elec
tions this time, but nothing was done about it.
It's easy to let things slide. The student body
should expect to read that definite action has
been taken and that a committee has been ap
pointed to make an investigation and then re
port on it, following next Tuesday's meeting.
