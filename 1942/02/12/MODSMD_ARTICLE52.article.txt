### AMIE REICHERT 
the Allies changed horses in the mid
dle of the Pacific. The main advantage of the big
switch is that the new horse is Dutch.
When Roosevelt and Churchill met last month to
map out a grand strategy for the United Nations,
to discuss co-operative offensive and defensive action,
to name names and set up a supreme War Council,
they couldn't please everybody naturally, so they de
cided to displease the Dutch; they left them out of
the party.
They displeased the Chinese a bit too when they
didn't invite them to sit in on the parleying and when
they tossed Chiang Kai-shek the unlikely bone of
military operations in Thailand and Indo-China. But
at least the Chinese got their name and their boy in
with the brass hats, and rightly so.
With the Dutch it was something else, and not at
all rightly so. At least they didn't think it was right.
With the magnificent record of enemy sinkings they
have piled up in their box score since the war began—
the average is very close to one ship a day—they
felt that they deserved something more than the privi
lege of taking orders from the Allied High Command,
donating men and supplies and bases, without ever
being consulted.
They have been good little children all along, not
withstanding the fact that they have felt keenly their
omission.

Y"ESTERDAY they got their reward. One of their
boys was appointed to supreme command of the
combined Allied fleets in the Far East, a move that
will give them a powerful voice in the grand over
all strategy of the Pacific theater. He is Vice Admiral
C .E. L. Helfrich of the Royal Netherlands Navy, and
he is replacing U.S. Admiral Thomas C. Hart, who, the
Navy Department says, asked to be relieved of his
command because of ill health.
Hart, it will be remembered, has been conducting
the naval operations in the American-British-Dutch-
Australian area since Jan. 17. He was one of the orig
inal Roosevelt-Churchill appointees of Jan. 3, and is
the first to be changed since the council was created.
Hart has done good work in this position, as far as
we know, for it was he who directed the Battle of
Macassar Strait ten days ago when combined Dutch
and American naval air forces gave a 100-ship Japa
nese armada a pretty bad time of it. (Apparently the
invasion fleet was not smashed, for latest reports told
of its reformation and successive local victories).
It was only four days ago that the Navy formally
announced Hart's taking naval command of the crucial
area .

r JPHIS surprise element would seem to indicate that
the shake-up then was a political move as well as
a strategic one, to bolster the defenses of the Dutch
Indies which stand next in the immediate line of
Japanese fire.
Next on the Nipponese docket are the treasures of
the Indies: oil, tin, spices, and rubber. It is Helfrich's
trust to defend these. Subject to the approval of Gen
eral Wavell, who is in supreme command of the en
tire area, the entire responsibility for naval defense of
these islands rests on the new chief. Right now that's
the biggest order of the day.
