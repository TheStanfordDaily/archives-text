### MIKE CHURCHILL 
KONKO THE CAUCUS
r 970 students showed that they were inter
ested enough to retain such freedom of govern
ment as is allowed the Stanford student.
If that quarter of the student body that voted is
representative, then at least one good thing emerged
from the disorganized flurry that was the winter
election.
By a 7-to-l count for the amendments, the stu
dents expressed their distaste for the disease-ridden
caucus system.
These amendments were designed primarily to
limit the effectiveness of political "machines" and get
away from auction block tactics now prevalent in our
spring elections.
The matter is now entirely in the hands of the
student "leaders" and it will be interesting to see what
they do about it.
Will the "politicos" and the "organizers" from Hall
and Row soon begin their annual horse trading? If
they do they will be breaking faith with the prin
ciples of student government.

The caucus itself is nothing but a formality, a
mask of decency for the sly, underhand dealings that
preceed it. The pre-caucus meetings, like oriental
market places where some crafty merchants of foul
politics, each with his candidate and his number of
caucus votes, are the real and rotten trouble.
The "organizer" at this meeting does not hesitate
to use all the powers of deception and falsehood at his
command. His sole object is to sell his votes, his
pledged support, in return for the highest nomination
he can get for his candidate.
Because of this, all offices other than that of presi
dent are, more often than not, mere "political foot
balls." The prime question in choosing men for these
nominations is not whether he is the best suited, but
rather whether he will have the most support in the.
caucus.
The caucus has been outmoded ever since we got
preferential voting, and now the students have shown
that it is also unwanted. No longer do the number of
nominations to an office effect its outcome.
To win a candidate must get more than 50 per
cent of the ballots. You can take all the support away
from your opponent you want by additional nomina
tions, but it will do you no good for he will get it
all back on second and third counts.
