## SUPPORTS CONGRESSMEN 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
Your editorial today, "Pork-Barrel Pigs," sarcas
tically seems to refute the necessity of pensions for
U.S. Senators and Representatives. It is stated, "action
of the Senators certainly doesn't equal an astute move
toward re-election."
Kindly remember this fact: Congressmen are very
often forced to get re-elected to earn a living be
cause of forgetting and being unable to re-engage in
their old businesses or professions.
As a result, to secure re-election they are often
forced to yield to the demands of special groups, pres
sure groups, instead of being able to vote their own
views and opinions.
So that if they are assured of an income, if they
should be defeated in election, the tendency is then for
them to feel freer to vote as their convictions dictate i
and to be far less inclined to pay attention to lobby
ists' demands.
This is the other side of the picture that the edito
rial did not state; in all fairness you should have pre
sented both pro and con.
Very sincerely,
Edmund Rice j
