# KERMAN NOW "DEVIL-DOG"
## Lieutenant Here To Enlist Men 
### KAY SCHWARTZ 
"Quanlico? Great place. You
freeze in the winter and fry in the
summer. My feet arc two sizes big
ger, and my arches have fallen like
(lie Tacoma bridge."
Those aren't the words of Lieuten
ant John Kerman, Marine recruiting
officer; but of Johnny Kerman, for
mer Stanford Beta, who signed on !
the dotted line last June to become
a "fightin' leatherneck." He went to
Quantico, the Marine Corps train
ing base, for a six months training
course that would make fraternity
initiations look like a Roblc tea.
PROUD OF SERVICE
Now Johnny Kerman is Lieuten
ant Kerman and he's back at his
alma mater enlisting Stanford men
for service in the Marine Corps.
"I'm not making any promises of a
soft life or lots of glory, but take it
from me, there's a challenge and
world of satisfaction in> making the
grade. "They told me to take my
golf clubs and tennis racket when I
went back to Quantico. That's a
laugh. A Marine's leisure time is
spent in sleeping."
RECRUITING TODAY
The lieutenant's opinion of the
Marine Corps as a career was a
masterpiece of enthusiasm, and if
there had been any prospective re
cruits within hearing, he would have
had his hands full. He's proud of
the Marine service and its long his
tory of tradition, and he's out to do !
the best job he can.

"When a recruit goes to Quantico,"
according to Lieutenant Kerman, "he
spends two weeks in Boot Training
which is about the same as a draftee
gets in the Army. Then he begins
the three months' Candidate's i
Training, and, if he makes the grade, !
he goes on into Reserve Class, which
lasts another three months."
"At the end of the six months,"
Kerman pointed to his sleeve, "that
once green recruit is a full-fledged
lieutenant in the Marine Corps Re
serve. He's trained in gunnery, I

drilling, and military tactics, and if
he's interested in making the Serv
ice a career, he can go on to officer's
school. That's what I did."
This Thursday and Friday, Feb.
12 and 13, Lieutenant Kerman will
be over in the Men's Health Service
signing up any Stanford men who
are interested in entering the Marine
Corps. "We will give these prospec
tive recruits physical exams right
there so that any ineligible men
will be eliminated before they are
inducted."


JOHN KERMAN, '11, is shown receiving his commission as second
lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps from Secretary of the Navy
Frank Knox.
