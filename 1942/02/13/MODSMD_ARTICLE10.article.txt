# Series to Show Laughton Film
## 
### 
When it, comes to scandal, a Hol
lywood divorce could not hold a
candle to some of England's kings.
And as you will see in "The Private
Life of Henry VIII," at the Sadler
Series this Sunday, that royal bluc
beard was one of the best.
Charles Laughton looks almost
exactly like Holbein's famous paint
ing of Honry VIII, and the Laughton
acting is largely responsible for the
movie's success in landing in "the
best ten of the year."
The Buck Rogers chapter, "News
Highlights of 1941" and "Football
Highlights of 1941" will complete
the bill. The show begins at 7:15
Sunday night in Memorial Hall, ad
mission 20 cents.
