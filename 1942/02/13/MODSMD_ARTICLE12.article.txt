# Nazi Ships Escape Into North Sea

### 
LONDON, Feb. l.'i (Ul*). â€”A Ger
man battle fleet, headed by tbc
26,000-ton battleships Sebarnhorst
and Gnciscnau and covered by a
great armada of ariplancs, has
forced tbe English Channel from
west to east after a terrific and costly
battle and disappeared in the direc
tion of the German North Sea coast,
it was announced today.
The sortie apparently v/as made to
remove the two battleships and the
10,000-ton German cruiser Prinz
Eugen from the harbor at Brest,
where they have been under con
stant British air attacks for a year
to the comparative safety of the
naval base at Kiel.
LOOM SUDDENLY
The German fleet-destroyers, tor
pedo boats, E-boats, mine sweepers
and the three great, sleek battle
craft, loomed suddenly off the coast
of Dover out of a wintry mist at 11
a.m. Thursday.
When the smoke of battle had
cleared away Thursday evening, it
was estimated that both German
battleships and the cruiser had been
bombed; that 42 British and 18 Ger
man airplanes had been shot down,
and that incalculable damage had
been inflicted on smaller German
boats.
Although the German fleet was
reported scattered, most of it, in
cluding the "big three," escaped into
the North Sea and, if not damaged
beyond repair, can be expected soon
to become a peril to Allied shipping
in the Atlantic.
BATTLE NOT OVER
The battle still was not regarded
as finished, however, and commenta
tors said "further reports" might be
forthcoming.
For the moment, it appeared that
the British had come out second
best and some experts said that if
the Germans got their ships safely
to Heligoland bases it would be a
bigger blow to British prestige than
the loss of the Prince of Wales and
Repulse of! Malaya, since it occurred
in the Dover Straits which the Ad
miralty long has boasted was "as
British as the Thames."
