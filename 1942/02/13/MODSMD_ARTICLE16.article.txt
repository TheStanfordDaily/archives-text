# Farm Food Research Reveals Extent of European Shortage
## 
### 
The Stanford Food Research Institute stated last night that a survey of
European food conditions showed serious food shortages exist in Spain,
Belgium, France, Finland, and Norway but have not reached the starvation
stage reported in Greece and Poland.
All European nations, including tbc United Kingdom, are facing condi
tions of restricted diet.

The survey, covering all countries
except Russia, showed:
Great Britain appears to have
enough food generally, although
there is a scarcity of milk and
cheese and lower meat rations.
Germany is in a favored position,
but still has inadequate supplies of
meat, dairy and poultry products,
and fats.
Of Germany, the report said, "From
Norway she takes the better grade of
fish, leaving inadequate quantities of
the poorer grades for the Norwe
gians. At French ports she deducts
for shipment to Germany a specified
percentage (rumored as high as 50
per cent) of all imports destined for
France."
Conditions in Greece and Poland,
controlled by the Axis, are close to
famine. Of the situation in Greece
the report said, "Deaths from starva
tion, cold, cholera, typhoid and all
other cases have been variously
placed at from 200 to 2,000 a day in
the Athens-Piraeus area."
The situation in the large cities of
Poland was described as "nearly
comparable to that of Greece."
Italy is facing more difficult food
problems than last year but its food
problem, the Stanford researchers
said, is not critical.
