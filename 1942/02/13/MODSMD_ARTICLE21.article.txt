# Singapore Still Fights; Naval Battle Off Dover
## Tokyo Says City Streets 'Run with Blood'; Radio Retorts 'We Shall Win' 
### 
LONDON, Friday, Feb. 13 (UP). â€”Singapore's doomed
but determined defenders yesterday successfully counter
; attacked the Japanese left flank, won an air-battle over Malaya,
j and were reported still holding out tenaciously this morning.
The Cable and Wireless Company reported at 1 a.m. (7
a.m. Singapore Time; 8 p.m. Thursday E.W.T.) that com
munications v/ith Singapore still were normal although the
British Ministry of Information said the Singapore radio had
not been heard here since 3 p.m. Thursday (10 a.m. E.W.T.)
indicating that it may have been bombed out of commission.
The last radio message from the beleaguered city was a de
fiant war cry, "We shall win." That came many hours after
the great naval base, sheltering 750,000 persons, had been writ
ten off as lost and with it, the greatest symbol of white su
premacy in the Far East.
The Tokyo radio said: "Singapore city reverted to its role
of frontier town in the final phase of the Malayan campaign.
Its streets ran with blood and its tropical calm was shattered
by the swelling roar of rifle, machine gun and artillery fire
as Japanese forces ran the British defenders out of the city
in desperate street fighting.
Last intelligible word from the island was picked up by
the British radio at 3 p.m. (10 a.m. E.W.T.; 9 p.m. Singapore
Time.) The announcer stressed that Lieut. Gen. A. E. Perci
val had scorned a Japanese demand for unconditional sur
render.
