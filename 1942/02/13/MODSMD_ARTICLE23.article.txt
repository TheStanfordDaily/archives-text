### 
RANGOON, Feb. 12 (UP).-Brit
ish Imperials have won two smash
ing victories on the Salwecn River
front, dispersing a major Japanese
invasion force in the Paan area and
blocking another Japanese column in
a fierce bayonet battle near Marta
ban, 30 miles to the south, it was an
nounced today.
Heavy casualties were inflicted,
army headquarters announced, when
the defenders of Burma hurled back
and put to flight a large Japa
nese force that sought to cross the
Sal ween at Paan to establish a
bridgehead on the west bank for a
drive toward the Burma Road and
Rangoon.
The enemy appears to have tem
porarily abandoned operations in
that area," a communique said.
JAPS MASS AT PAAN
The Japanese had been massing
at Paan, on the east bank of the
river, for a week before they at
tempted to cross.
The communique said that British
casualties were known to be slight in
the Paan battle.
In the Martaban area, only enemy
foothold on the Salwecn west bank,
a party of the king's own Yorkshire
light infantry staged a bayonet
charge into the midst of Japanese
troops attempting to move along the
railway that leads to Rangoon, about
150 miles to the northwest.
The invaders suffered considerable
casualties, the communique said, be
fore they threw away their weapons
and fled.
POSITIONS VULNERABLE
Military quarters maintained that
this Japanese rout demonstrated
row vulnerable their position is at
Martaban. The British withdrawal
from the river port two days ago
was not very important, they said,
for it eliminated an undefendable

salient on the front which the Japa
nese could attack easily. In Japa
, nese hands, however, it can lie of
1 little value in the face of stiff Brit
i ish resistance.
Japanese planes attacked Imperial
forces in the Martaban sector yester
j day ,an RAF communique said, but
Allied bombers responded with
j heavy raids on enemy positions in
I the same sector and on troop con
j centrations at Moulmein, across the
river from Martaban.
Those who raided the Moulmein
area reported fires among the river
| rocks, which the enemy had pre
■ pared for loading equipment, and
supplies on boats to be taken across
to Martaban.

ish Imperials have won two smash
ing victories on the Salwecn River
front, dispersing a major Japanese
invasion force in the Paan area and
blocking another Japanese column in
a fierce bayonet battle near Marta
ban, 30 miles to the south, it was an

Heavy casualties were inflicted,
army headquarters announced, when
the defenders of Burma hurled back
and put to flight a large Japa
nese force that sought to cross the
Sal ween at Paan to establish a
bridgehead on the west bank for a
drive toward the Burma Road and
Rangoon.
The enemy appears to have tem

and fled.
