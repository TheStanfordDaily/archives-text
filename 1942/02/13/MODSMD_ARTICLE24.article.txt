WITH AMERICAN VOLUNTEER FLIERS IN SOUTHWEST CHINA,!
I'Yli. 10 (Ih laved) (Cl*). —They're devils in the sky and gods on the ground. ■
The majority are six feel tall and blond.
"We love our work here and miss only one thin# —our American

blondes," they say.
The Chinese, to whom they
brought sahly after years of peril,
Worship them. Dogs tag at their
heels. Children fc< 14 them for food
and money and get it.
The Japanese fear them.
YANK VOLUNTEERS
There, then, is a thumbnail sketch
of gallant American youths lighting
and dicing under the red-white
and-bluc banner of China.
They are American volunteer
group, commanded by wiry, wind
hitten Col. Claii'e L. Chennault, re
ared American air officer who holds
1b • rank of Brigadier-General in the
Chinese army.
Their main job is to protect
China's Burma Road lifeline. Now
they rule the air above it.
lit T QUARTERS
They have the best living quar
ter'.-i in all this part of China, they
h-'ve hot and cold running water.
Their food is American. There are
tennis and basketball courts and
hi' 1 ball diamonds here for them.

They have movie shows once a week
— but the pictures sometimes are six
years old.
They have their own bar where
they use American coins and bills
to buy a drink. The bar is open
only three hours a day, however.
NOT MUCH DRINK
Outside that bar, there isn't much |
drinking.# In public pubs whiskey |
and soda costs three American dol- i
lars.
The fliers frequently eat in a large
Chinese restaurant. They consume J
practcially nothing but ham and eggs ;
and pie.
Hundreds of ragged children j
swarm outside the restaurant. The j
pilots always bring something out |
for them to eat.
Most of the fliers wear lumber- |
jackets. I had one on similar to |
theirs. Beggars tagged behind me I
shouting:
"Foreign flyman! Foreign flyman! |
Please give dollar."
