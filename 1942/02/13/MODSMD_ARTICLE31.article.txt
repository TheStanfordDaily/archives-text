# Farm 'Skyscraper Five' To Meet Bears Tonight
## 
### 
Clinging to its .200 percentage lead in the sonthi i n division race, Stan
ford faces California and the old "away from home" jinx tonight at 8:15
in the Berkeley gym. The Papooses meet Cal frosh in the preliminary.
Though Coach Fvcrett Dean's starting line-up remains the same, Cal's
Nilis "rice has hcen experimenting with everything he has, and it's dif-

to tell who will face off against
the Indian skyscrapers.
Last Saturday Price started Jack
J Rocker, Roy Tamm, Orell Saffores,
| Bob Alameida, and Dave Thurm
j against U.C.L.A. This particular
> combination worked like a charm
j until midway in the second half.
BRUINS WIN
With the Bears fast catching up
at 30-39, Price inserted Jim Bailey
' and Stan Johnson. The pair began
I a string of personal fouls that ended

Bob Biles, veteran California
guard, turned in his basketball
suit to devote his full time to track
and studies, the early edition of
the San Francisco Examiner an
nounced this morning.

j with the Bruins converting 7 points
j from the free-throw line and help
ing themselves to a 50-34 victory
j over the hapless Bears.
Back to the Indians—Jimmy Pol
lard. Don Burness, Ed Voss, Bill
j Cowden, and Howie Dallmar need a
i better shot percentage than last Sat
urday's to take their second victory
j from California. In its second loss
; of the season Stanford connected on
| six attempts out of 51 for a 12 per
l cent average. The night before when
; the Redskins clubbed S.C., 43-33,
j they completed 32 per cent of their
I tries.
CONFERENCE STANDINGS

As far as the "weak second night"
I goes, that's out. It's a one-night
| stand this time, and besides, Stan
| ford demonstrated its ability to go
j two nights in a row in licking the
Bruins twice.
U.S.C. MEETS U.C.L.A.
While Bear meets Indian, South
ern California and U.C.L.A. square
off in Los Angeles as the Bruins try
j to snap the 37-game losing streak
|to their cross-town rivals. And
they've a better chance to do it now
| that via Ernie Handelman they were
J able to take care of Cal once in
two attempts.
Should the Bruins measure S.C.,
Stanford would remain on top of
the league regardless of tonight's
outcome.
