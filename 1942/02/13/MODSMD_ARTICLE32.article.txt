# Ski Team Travels To Reno Carnival
## 
### 
The Stanford ski team will travel
to the Reno Winter Sports Carnival
this week-end to compete with C'al
Tech, U.C., Oregon State, U.C.L.A..
and Nevada U. teams.
Representing Stanford in the
Reno meet will be Art Sweetser, Bob
Blatt, Jack Ditz, Bob Elliot, Rex
Rathbun, Don Du Pertius, Peter
Hamburger, and Herb Obexer.
At the same time, 150 members of
the Ski Club will make the trek to
Yosemite for the annual Stanford
snow festival. No reservations may
be made for the following week-ends
because of the large crowds expected
for Washington's Birthday and the
Pacific Coast meet.
NEW YORK, Feb. 12 (UP).—Billy
Conn, who found No. 13 quite un
lucky in June, risks his hopes for a
million-dollar summer fight tumor
row night—Friday, the 13th—when
he faces Middleweight Champion
Tony Zale at Madison Square Gar
den.
