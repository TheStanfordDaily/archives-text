# Frosh Mermen Meet Spartans
## 
### 
Minus SI an Gamble, ace sprint
swimmer, Stanford's powerful fresh
man swimming team faces the San
Jose Stale frosh mermen this after
noon at 4 p.m. in the Encina pools.
Even without Gamble, who sprain
ed his ankle yesterday, the Encina
men have power to spare against the
not-too-strong Spartan first-year
men if past performances hold true.
The Card varsity, which has been
beaten by the freshmen this year,
defeated a combined freshman and
varsity San Jose team, 42 to 32, last
week.
Trying for a pool record in his
100-yard backstroke lap of the med
ley relay will be Alan Weeden,
freshman backstroker, who swam the
distance in 1:02.4 in practice this
week, unofficially breaking Paul
Herron's mark of 1:02.5. Although
this distance is not part of the swim
program, it is one lap of the relay.
