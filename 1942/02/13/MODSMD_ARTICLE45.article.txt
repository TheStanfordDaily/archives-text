# Red Tape: Filed
## 
### 
MANY college men have been impatient
with and often a bit disappointed by the
red tape and endless hours of waiting in re
cruiting offices of United States armed forces.
Anxious to put their college education to bet
ter advantage for the country and for them
selves than it might be used were they to allow
themselves to be drafted, they have eagerly
sought out the nearest offices to volunteer.
Most of them have had the sense to appre
ciate that America cannot examine and enlist
overnight the tremendous numbers required,
that the rush of volunteers could not help but
clog official machinery.
In this connection, officers recruiting college
men for officers' training in service reserves are
to be congratulated on their quick action in
sending their men to the campuses to give
first-hand information.
They have also done an expedient and satis
factory thing in making an effort to send re
cruiting officers back to the colleges from
which they graduated. This is being done for
Stanford â€” the Naval Reserve sent Ensign
George Vaughan, '39, to the Farm to enlist men
in the Navy V-7 and V-5 classes, for line officer
and air corps training, and yesterday and today
the Marine Corps is represented by Lieutenant
John Kerman, '41.
This system of sending well-known men back
to their alma maters provides opportunity for
the college men to obtain information from per
sonal friends in the service, and is not a little
incentive to become more enthusiastic and per
haps enlist sooner than would be the case
otherwise.
