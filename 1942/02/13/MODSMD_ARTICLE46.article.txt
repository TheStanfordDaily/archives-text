# Fun, On-Campus
## 
### 
IF those students who raised mournful cries
of "What'll we do for fun?" when Ex Com
mittee forbade expensive "big name" dances
for the duration will drop around to the Pavilion
between 10 and 1 tonight they'll see Stanford
having plenty of fun and dancing to good music.
Moreover, if they'll take the trouble to put out
52.20 apiece and take in a little of the fun
themselves, they'll have the satisfaction of
knowing that every cent of their money is going
to one of the most worthy causes in this war-torn
world—the American Red Cross' War Relief
Fund.
lhis is the way Stanford is having its fun—
by turning what used to be profit into funds for
one of many needs which arise from war. It
would be commendable if all our social events
from now on were for as fine a cause as this.—

In a purely routine call last night a Daily
reporter called the campus police oftice. Af
ter much delay the University operator an
nounced that "there is no answer from that
office." We're glad it was just routine.
