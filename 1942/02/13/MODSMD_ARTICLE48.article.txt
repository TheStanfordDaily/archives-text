### AMIE REICHERT 
AWFULLY sorry but I'm mad again. I know
it's spring and the sun is out and my sinus trouble
is all gone and I have been taking my vitamin pills
regularly so I should feel benign and charitable to
everyone. But I'm mad just the same and I can't
help it.
It s Mr. Pegler this time. I hate to do this to Mr.
Pegler because he is an old friend of mine, and though
I can count the times I have agreed with him on the
knuckles of one finger, nevertheless I am sort of at
tached to him because I have always read him second
in the newspapers, right after the funnies, ever since
I was a small child.

ANY rate, today I am mad at you, Mr. Pegler, oh
yes I am. Stop cowering in that corner over there
and come out and face it. I guess if Herbert Hoover
could take it like a man you can too.
Yes, I am furious, and I am going to take under my
protective wing your two pet untouchables, currently
the two most maligned individuals in yours and other
columns all over the country. I'm talking about Joe
Lash and Eleanor Roosevelt, Mr. Pegler.
You, Mr. Pegler, are not a gentleman. Mr. Clapper
is a gentleman. Mr. Lippman is a gentleman. Dorothy
Thompson is a gentleman. Why can't you be a gentle
man, Mr. Pegler?
I don't care what you or any other columnist says
about Mrs. Roosevelt's giving government jobs to her
friends if the accusations made are valid, if the facts
are there, and the presentation of them is fair.
In that event I will agree with you and the rest of
your fellow-columnists. But I cannot for the life of
me see what saddistic fun you find in constantly re
iterating over and over in one column after another
the unhappy fact that Joe Lash is a young man who
has been divorced, and that his wife once wrote an
excitingly-titled story in a Communist magazine.

Mr. Pegler, 1 can't see the value of doing a
thing like that. It isn't helping to build or create or
improve anything or anybody, and in every case in
which you have used this propagandists device to
make one point or another, you have only succeeded in
clouding, obscuring the issue.
Why can't you leave these personal details out, Mr.
Pegler? Why can't you keep most of the filth you dig
up to yourself, Mr. Pegler? Why are you so con
foundedly mean, Mr. Pegler? Please consider your
wrists properly slapped.

friends if the accusations made are valid, if the facts
are there, and the presentation of them is fair.
In that event I will agree with you and the rest of
your fellow-columnists. But I cannot for the life of
me see what saddistic fun you find in constantly re
iterating over and over in one column after another
the unhappy fact that Joe Lash is a young man who
has been divorced, and that his wife once wrote an
excitingly-titled story in a Communist magazine.

Mr. Pegler, 1 can't see the value of doing a
thing like that. It isn't helping to build or create or
improve anything or anybody, and in every case in
which you have used this propagandists device to
make one point or another, you have only succeeded in
clouding, obscuring the issue.
Why can't you leave these personal details out, Mr.
Pegler? Why can't you keep most of the filth you dig
up to yourself, Mr. Pegler? Why are you so con
foundedly mean, Mr. Pegler? Please consider your
wrists properly slapped.
AWFULLY sorry but I'm mad again. I know
it's spring and the sun is out and my sinus trouble
is all gone and I have been taking my vitamin pills
regularly so I should feel benign and charitable to
everyone. But I'm mad just the same and I can't
help it.
It s Mr. Pegler this time. I hate to do this to Mr.
Pegler because he is an old friend of mine, and though
I can count the times I have agreed with him on the
knuckles of one finger, nevertheless I am sort of at
tached to him because I have always read him second
in the newspapers, right after the funnies, ever since
I was a small child.

ANY rate, today I am mad at you, Mr. Pegler, oh
yes I am. Stop cowering in that corner over there
and come out and face it. I guess if Herbert Hoover
could take it like a man you can too.
Yes, I am furious, and I am going to take under my
protective wing your two pet untouchables, currently
the two most maligned individuals in yours and other
columns all over the country. I'm talking about Joe
Lash and Eleanor Roosevelt, Mr. Pegler.
You, Mr. Pegler, are not a gentleman. Mr. Clapper
is a gentleman. Mr. Lippman is a gentleman. Dorothy
Thompson is a gentleman. Why can't you be a gentle
man, Mr. Pegler?
I don't care what you or any other columnist says
about Mrs. Roosevelt's giving government jobs to her
friends if the accusations made are valid, if the facts
are there, and the presentation of them is fair.
