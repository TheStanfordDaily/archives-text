view of spring fever.)

r I' , HIS is my Bull Session and I want to tell you
about my first game of golf. Three other guys and
I decided to try a hand at the game before we got
too old. They told me they had never played before,
and like a fool I believed them.
I walked out to the first tee of the Stanford course,
looked at the score card and noted the par, and made
a little side bet with myself. I aimed straight down
the fairway, swung, and lifted the ball high over the
road. Feeling a little drunk with power, I picked up
my bag of clubs and found my ball with ease.
Little did I know that from here on my trouble was
just beginning. Looking over my shoulder to see if
any of my partners were watching me, I slipped a tec
under my ball and swung again. That little trick with
the tee was my undoing, for a few seconds after I
hit the ball I saw feathers fly to my left and heard
a poor hen cry out in pain. I tried all of the first aid
I knew on the bird, but I knew all the time I was
fighting a losing battle. I swung my club and put
the poor bantam out of misery.
Once again I started down the fairway—only this
time the ball zoomed to the right into a field. It took
the four of us to finally admit defeat; so I picked
another ball out of the bag and aimed for the green.
To make the story short, that ball also will never be
seen on a golf course again. I hit the green on nine,
nine putted for a total of 18. I lost my side bet by
14 strokes.
Hole two wasn't much better, except I only lost
one ball and made a grand score of 12. By this time
I realized that the rest of the foursome had had a lot
more experience than they had let me in on. Their
respective scores were eight, seven, and eleven. I de
cided on the spot that the man with eleven was the
boy to watch. It seems that he, too, decided that I was
the man for him to watch. We must have looked
awfully funny watching each other watching each
other.

By the time I reached the eighth hole I was get
ling a little disgusted. If you remember, the eighth
is the baby which you drive under two hundred yards
over three hundred trees and a creek. I aimed a little
to the left in order to hit the screen.
I hit the screen, all right, and landed right on the
green—ten yards away from the hole. My main
trouble was in finding my eye. I ended up with an
eleven. We were all getting pretty tired; so we de
cided to stop at the ninth.
There is not much need to repeat an old story. I
got thirteen. We approached the nineteenth hole for
a quick coke and shower before a game of hearts.
After looking over the card, I came to the conclusion
that my downfall was on the awful fifth where I got
a twenty-one. Altogether my total score was thirty
over par for eighten holes on nine holes.
That's the long story; I am now a past-master at
golf.

looked at the score card and noted the par, and made
a little side bet with myself. I aimed straight down
the fairway, swung, and lifted the ball high over the
road. Feeling a little drunk with power, I picked up
my bag of clubs and found my ball with ease.
Little did I know that from here on my trouble was
just beginning. Looking over my shoulder to see if
any of my partners were watching me, I slipped a tec
under my ball and swung again. That little trick with
the tee was my undoing, for a few seconds after I
hit the ball I saw feathers fly to my left and heard
a poor hen cry out in pain. I tried all of the first aid
I knew on the bird, but I knew all the time I was
fighting a losing battle. I swung my club and put
the poor bantam out of misery.
Once again I started down the fairway—only this
time the ball zoomed to the right into a field. It took
the four of us to finally admit defeat; so I picked
another ball out of the bag and aimed for the green.
To make the story short, that ball also will never be
seen on a golf course again. I hit the green on nine,
nine putted for a total of 18. I lost my side bet by
14 strokes.
Hole two wasn't much better, except I only lost
one ball and made a grand score of 12. By this time
I realized that the rest of the foursome had had a lot
more experience than they had let me in on. Their
respective scores were eight, seven, and eleven. I de
cided on the spot that the man with eleven was the
boy to watch. It seems that he, too, decided that I was
the man for him to watch. We must have looked
awfully funny watching each other watching each
other.

By the time I reached the eighth hole I was get
ling a little disgusted. If you remember, the eighth
is the baby which you drive under two hundred yards
over three hundred trees and a creek. I aimed a little
to the left in order to hit the screen.
I hit the screen, all right, and landed right on the
green—ten yards away from the hole. My main
trouble was in finding my eye. I ended up with an
eleven. We were all getting pretty tired; so we de
cided to stop at the ninth.
There is not much need to repeat an old story. I
got thirteen. We approached the nineteenth hole for
a quick coke and shower before a game of hearts.
After looking over the card, I came to the conclusion
that my downfall was on the awful fifth where I got
a twenty-one. Altogether my total score was thirty
over par for eighten holes on nine holes.
That's the long story; I am now a past-master at
golf.
