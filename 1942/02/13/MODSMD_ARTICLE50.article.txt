# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						WOMEN SPEAK 
### 
yHE EDITOR, SIR:
I Dear Mike: After sitting quietly for about two
weeks, in a frying pan, and watching Bull Session
; carrying Stanford Womanhood down the ladder step
by step—we protest. Evidently, Master Mike, you
I know the wrong Stanford women.
Our objections are:
1) Have you ever inquired about the shortage of
j Red Cross yarn?
2) Do you happen to know (hat the Red Cross
j course is limited?
3) How about the girls who are taking courses in
Paly?—or those already having completed courses and
| who are now active in campus civilian defense?
4) As for dates—if the fellows don't happen to want
to go to the city, why do they ask the girls?
5) About defense bonds—don't criticize until you
j have facts. Just how many men have bought them,
I anyway?
(5) As for Stanford women fearing a drop in the
ratio, thank heavens Stanford men aren't the only ones
in the world!
Who frustrated you anyway, kid?
