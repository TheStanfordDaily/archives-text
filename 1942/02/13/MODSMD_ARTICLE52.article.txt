# Iturbi to Play Monday Night
## 
### 
Jose Iturbi, famed Spanish pianist
and conductor, will use variety in
selection of music, for the campus
concert Monday evening.
Spiritually in sympathy with the
mind and tempo of the day, Iturbi
will present several modern pieces as
well as classical compositions. He
feels that much of the contemporary
music is the music of the future.
The classics, according to Iturbi, are
bits of the past and must be revered
and played as written.
Iturbi has distinguished himself
in the conducting field as well as
a concert pianist. In 1936 he became
musical director of the Rochester
Philharmonic Orchestra.
