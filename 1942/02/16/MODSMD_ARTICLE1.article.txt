# Shaughnessg May Go to Yale
## Coach Clark in New York, Confers with Eli Board Yale Sports Editor Says Mentor Negotiating with Advisory Group 
### BY BOB SONTAG 
Clark Shaughnessy, Stanford's head football coach, was reported by '
'almost positive sources last night to be in New York conferring with
(. hairman Edwin F. Blair of the Yale Advisory Committee regarding pos
sibilities of a coaching contract at Yale.
According to a United Press dispatch from New York, a member of the

athletic organization at New Haven,
Conn., said he "knew" Shaughnessy
was in New York for a talk with
Blair.
Shaughnessy boarded a train for
the east last Thursday and appar
ently left no word with anyone on
the campus as to the purpose of his
trip.
The Yale Advisory Committee is
not authorized to make any offers,
but may make recommendations
only, according to Dick Drain, Yale-
Daily News sports editor, whom The
Daily contacted by wire yesterday
afternoon.
Drain's telegram:
"Believed true Shaughnessy con
ferring with Alumni Football Ad
visory Committee. This group is
surveying many prospects and is
not authorized to make offers. It
may make recommendations to
the Yale Corporation soon. The
corporation decides on the recom
mendation."
Shaughnessy has no formal con
tract at Stanford, and under his five
year tenure as professor of physical
education he could presumably leave
his coaching job here at any time if
he desired.
One of the oldest universities in
the United States, Yale recently
threw aside its former rigid adher
ence to a strict athletic code, and
with its two close associates, Har
vard and Princeton, decided that
freshmen would be eligible for var
sity football.
YALE SEEKING COACH
Blair and his committee have re
portedly been seeking a "name"
coach since the resignation of Spike
Nelson in January. Nelson joined
the armed forces after a year in
which Yale's grid team lost seven out
of eight encounters. His predeces
sor, Ducky Pond, was not much
more successful.
When Shaughnessy returned from
his Midwest and Eastern tour after
winter vacation, he expressed doubts
about the future of Pacific Coast
football next fall due to the war
emergency and the fact that crowds
may be limited to a "few thousands."
'â€¢10 SUCCESS
His 1940 success in leading Stan
ford through a nine-game schedule
without a defeat, climaxed in the
Rose Bowl with a 21-13 victory over
Nebraska, won for him the title of
"miracle coach," because the year
before he took the coaching reins
Stanford won only one game.
The fact that T formation wizard
took the campus by surprise is reg
istered by statements from A1 Mas
ters, general manager of the 8.A.C.;
and J. P. Mitchell, University reg
istrar. All were aware of the east
ern trip but as far as they knew, the
intent of the mission was a mystery.
