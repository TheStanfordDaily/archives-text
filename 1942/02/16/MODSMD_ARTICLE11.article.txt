# Supply Lines Hit by Defeat Of Singapore
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Most significant and probably the
most immediate result of the fall of
Singapore will be the release of
great numbers of Japanese troops for
an intensified attack on Java, key
island in the defense of the Pacific
sea lanes, according to a statement
made last night by Dr. Graham
Stuart of the political science de
partment.
"If the United Powers can hold
Java, New Guinea, and Port Dar
win on the northern coast of Aus
tralia, it will still be possible to get
supplies through without sending
them around Australia," he said.
"And it's about 10,000 miles from
San Francisco, down under Austra
lia, and up again to Rangoon."
SUPPLY LINES 'VITAL'
Pointing out that the maintenance
of supply lines up to Burma, India,
.and Suez was "vital" to the Allied
war effort, the political scientist
added that, co-existent with the
threat to Java, and "equally import
ant," was the increased threat to
Rangoon, southern anchor of the
Burma Road.
Long range effects of the fall of
the great Pacific bastion, he averred,
would be largely a mater of oil sup
plies.
HAS OIL NOW
"One great weakness, for Japan,
was the fact that they had access to
only 15,000,000 barrels of oil a year,"
he said. "They were using between
45,000,000 and 50,000,000 barrels a
year and, as I saw it, our one chance
for a quick war would be to cut off
her oil. Now .she has the oil of the
Celebes and Sumatra, and probably
enough refined oil to hold her until
she can get the Dutch wells re
paired."
Expressing the belief that the
Dutch, with British and American
reinforcements, might very possibly
be able to hold the strategic East
Indies island, he noted that the
Dutch have "between one and two
thousand planes, a good army, and
ships.
"They saw this coming," he said.
"The British didn't."
DARWIN A CENTKIt
Dr. Stuart predicted that Port
Darwin would be the next great base
for Allied operations in the Pacific.
This base, according to Stuart, has
been greatly expanded and is con
nected with southern Australia by a
new railroad.
"I don't think they have the men
to conquer that continent."

"The British didn't."
DARWIN A CENTKIt
Dr. Stuart predicted that Port
Darwin would be the next great base
for Allied operations in the Pacific.
This base, according to Stuart, has
been greatly expanded and is con
nected with southern Australia by a
new railroad.
"I don't think they have the men
to conquer that continent."
SEATTLE, Feb. 15 (UP),-Mrs.
Zeno Briggs, wife of the security
officer of the 13th Naval District,
christened the seaplane tender Rock
away today in the first launching of
a warsl/p at a Puget Sound yard
since America entered the war.
Most significant and probably the
most immediate result of the fall of
Singapore will be the release of
great numbers of Japanese troops for
an intensified attack on Java, key
island in the defense of the Pacific
sea lanes, according to a statement
made last night by Dr. Graham
Stuart of the political science de
partment.
"If the United Powers can hold
Java, New Guinea, and Port Dar
win on the northern coast of Aus
tralia, it will still be possible to get
supplies through without sending
them around Australia," he said.
"And it's about 10,000 miles from
San Francisco, down under Austra
lia, and up again to Rangoon."
SUPPLY LINES 'VITAL'
Pointing out that the maintenance
of supply lines up to Burma, India,
.and Suez was "vital" to the Allied
war effort, the political scientist
added that, co-existent with the
threat to Java, and "equally import
ant," was the increased threat to
Rangoon, southern anchor of the
Burma Road.
Long range effects of the fall of
the great Pacific bastion, he averred,
would be largely a mater of oil sup
plies.
HAS OIL NOW
"One great weakness, for Japan,
was the fact that they had access to
only 15,000,000 barrels of oil a year,"
he said. "They were using between
45,000,000 and 50,000,000 barrels a
year and, as I saw it, our one chance
for a quick war would be to cut off
her oil. Now .she has the oil of the
Celebes and Sumatra, and probably
enough refined oil to hold her until
she can get the Dutch wells re
paired."
Expressing the belief that the
Dutch, with British and American
reinforcements, might very possibly
be able to hold the strategic East
Indies island, he noted that the
Dutch have "between one and two
thousand planes, a good army, and
ships.
"They saw this coming," he said.
