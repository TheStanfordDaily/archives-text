# ITURBI RETURNS TO CAMPUS
## 
### 
Mingling the new with the classic
in music, Jose Iturbi, famed Span
ish pianist and conductor, will make
his third appearance on the Stan
ford campus tonight at 8:15 as the
second artist in the 1941-42 Concert
Series program in the Memorial
Theater.
His program tonight opens with
two "Sonatinas" by Scarlotti; the
"Sonata in D Major" by Hayden, in
three movements; and the group is
concluded wilh Schubert's "Sonata
in B Minor," in four movements.
The second group of selections in
cludes two compositions by Liszt,
"Canzonetta del Salvator Rosa" and
"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 11"; this
will be followed by "Three Pre
ludes" by Gershwin; "Cradle Song"
which is Mr. Iturbi's own composi
tion; and "Triana" by Albcniz.
Since coming to the United States
in 1929, Iturbi has distinguished
himself as musical director of the
Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra
and as a concert pianist. His popu
larity has reached such heights that
he recently purchased a plane in
which he flies from concert to con
cert.
Iturbi made his first appearance
at Stanford in 1939 when he was re
ceived with such enthusiasm that a
return engagement followed imme
diately.
Iturbi treats new music and class
ics alike because he believes new
music is as fine.
