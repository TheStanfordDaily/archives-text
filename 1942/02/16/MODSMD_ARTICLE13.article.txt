TOKYO, Feb. 15 (Radiocast recorded by UP, New York).
—Singapore's exhausted defenders gave up their fight today
but under terms of surrender, negotiated by Japanese and
British commanders, up to 1,000 British soldiers were left
under arms to maintain order until the Japanese army com
pletes the city's occupation.
The British commander, Lieutenant General Arthur E.
Percival, was attended at the surrender ceremony in the Ford
Motor Company plant outside the city by his staff officers,
Brigadier General K. Torrance, Major C. H. D. Wilde and the
chief of the military administration, reports from the city
said.
(Singapore's fall was announced by British Prime Minis
ter Churchill in a radio speech to the Empire at 4 p.m. EWT
but neither he nor other British informants gave any details.)
The din of battle reportedly ceased at 10 p.m. Artillery,
machine-gun and rifle fire was silenced on both sides, a Domei
news agency dispatch from Singapore said. Japanese planes
continued to circle in the darkness overhead, but bombing
ended.
Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita, commander in
chief of the Japanese army in Malaya, and Lieutenant General
Arthur E. Percival, British commanding officer, were said to
have signed the surrender terms three hours earlier.
The two met in the plant of the Ford Motor Company at
the foot of Timah Hill, highest point on the island, about
five miles northwest of the doomed city.
As the Japanese pounded relentlessly at British fortifica
tions and evacuation ships in the harbor and seized position
after position, the defenders sent out in the early afternoon
a party of four officers bearing a white flag of truce.
