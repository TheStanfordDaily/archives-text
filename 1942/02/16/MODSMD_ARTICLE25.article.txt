# Double-Overtime Thriller Keeps Cagers in League Lead Despite A.C. Loss
## 
### 
Stanford is still leading the south
ern division of the P.C.C. basketball
race b> one name, though the Red
skins left their best effort at Ber
keley Friday night and consequently
dropped an agonizing 43-39 clash to
the Oakland Athens Club in the Pa
vilion Saturday.
That double - overtime struggle
against the Bears took enough out
of the Red regulars to make them
colder than icebergs Saturday. Coach

Everett Dean's second-string started
against the Clubmen, battled them on
better than even terms, and led at
halftime, 21-17.
Athens closed the gap, went out
in tront at 32-2!), and Dean called in
a rescue squad: Jimmy Pollard, Ed
Voss, Howie Dallmar, and Bill
Cowden. Don Burness sat on the
bench in street clothes.
CARDS DROP BKIIIND
The best that four-fifths of the In
dian first-stringers could do was
drop a point farther behind with a
final score of 43-39. Jack Dana stayed
in for a while, hit the bucket for a
field goal, and little Freddie Linari
sank two beauties.
Meanwhile at Berkeley, the Bears'
first-string team did almost the
same thing. The regulars were being
whitewashed, 15-9, by U.S.F. after
nine minutes of play, so Nibs Price
threw in a second-string outfit, and
U.S.F. faltered and lost out, 36-25.
CAL ALMOST WINS
As for Friday's game, Cal had the
victory in the bag on two different
occasions, and only poor shots lost
for the Bears. Roy Tamm stole the
ball from Pollard and hurried his
set-up which would have clinched
the games. Bob Alameida had a
cinch set-up during the first extra
period, which he missed.
Cowden and Burness each made a
pair of free throws good when a
miss would have cost the game. At
any rate it was the greatest specta
tor's special that any two teams have
put on so far this season.
