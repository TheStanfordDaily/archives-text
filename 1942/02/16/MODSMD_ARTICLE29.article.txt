# Low Physical Fitness Told By Esslinger
## 
### 
Dr. A. A. Esslinger, director of ,
the Division of Physical Education, \
warned the California Association of
Health, Physical Education ami Rec
reation in their annual conference
here Saturday that in this time of
war the physical fitness of the
American youth would have to im- 1
prove radically to meet the demands
made on it.
Tests taken by Dr. Esslinger
[ among 300 Stanford freshmen show
! that 25 per cent of them could not
i swim 50 yards, while an amazingly
! large portion of them cannot chin
themselves more than five times or
I pass successfully any of the other
! tests put to them. In a survey made
at March Field by Bert DeGroot the
I same conditions were present, ac- i
I cording to Esslinger.
From now on there will be an I
j emphasis on more vigorous sports ]
j such as football, basketball, and soc
cer, although the much-publicized
I good of boxing has been exagger
j ated, according to Esslinger. The
| Stanford physical education direc
| tor also stated that there should be ;
100 per cent participation by boys in !
intercollegiate athletics.
TEACHERS NEEDED
With the induction of more than I
| 3,000 physical instructors into the I
| services, there is a greatly increased |
I need for men and women of that I
j type, despite the fact that the sources I
for them are drying up.
Stanford basketball coach Everett \
j Dean, speaking after Esslinger, told J
j of the many recent changes in bas
ketball as to equipment, rules, and
j style of play. He also emphasized
I the importance of having high qual-
I ity coaches with the new speeded
! up. strenuous game.
RULES CONFLICT
According to Dean there is at pres
| ent a conflict on between the
I N.C.A.A. rules committee and the
I National Association of Basketball
Coaches over the former's desire for
j standardized equipment. He believes
i that the ideal court will be smaller
j than the ones in use now.
The fast-break game and one
handed shot, both adopted by the
! rest of the country after their intro
i duction on the coast, have speeded
up the game to the extent that un
less the coach adequately trains his
J men, the game will be harmful to 1
them.

TEACHERS NEEDED
With the induction of more than I
| 3,000 physical instructors into the I
| services, there is a greatly increased |
I need for men and women of that I
j type, despite the fact that the sources I
for them are drying up.
Stanford basketball coach Everett \
j Dean, speaking after Esslinger, told J
j of the many recent changes in bas
ketball as to equipment, rules, and
j style of play. He also emphasized
I the importance of having high qual-
I ity coaches with the new speeded
! up. strenuous game.
RULES CONFLICT
According to Dean there is at pres
| ent a conflict on between the
I N.C.A.A. rules committee and the
I National Association of Basketball
Coaches over the former's desire for
j standardized equipment. He believes
i that the ideal court will be smaller
j than the ones in use now.
The fast-break game and one
handed shot, both adopted by the
! rest of the country after their intro
i duction on the coast, have speeded
up the game to the extent that un
less the coach adequately trains his
J men, the game will be harmful to 1
them.
Dr. A. A. Esslinger, director of ,
the Division of Physical Education, \
warned the California Association of
Health, Physical Education ami Rec
reation in their annual conference
here Saturday that in this time of
war the physical fitness of the
American youth would have to im- 1
prove radically to meet the demands
made on it.
Tests taken by Dr. Esslinger
[ among 300 Stanford freshmen show
! that 25 per cent of them could not
i swim 50 yards, while an amazingly
! large portion of them cannot chin
themselves more than five times or
I pass successfully any of the other
! tests put to them. In a survey made
at March Field by Bert DeGroot the
I same conditions were present, ac- i
I cording to Esslinger.
From now on there will be an I
j emphasis on more vigorous sports ]
j such as football, basketball, and soc
cer, although the much-publicized
I good of boxing has been exagger
j ated, according to Esslinger. The
| Stanford physical education direc
| tor also stated that there should be ;
100 per cent participation by boys in !
intercollegiate athletics.
