# Indian Netmen Begin Workout; Emery Neale Displays Power
## 
### 
The potentially powerful Stanford Indian nctincn started their practice
season last Saturday afternoon, as they divided the squad and battled with
each other. With the talented Ted Schrocder and the still promising Larry
Dee absent from the courts, the most impressive showing; of the afternoon
was turned in hy Emery Neale in trouncing the giant Chuck Hutchison

6-2, 6-4. Neale slammed his fore
hands deep and sharp, twisted his
serve in severely, had his overhand
and volleying game tuned up amaz
ingly welli for this early in the
season.
Jimmy Wade worked his depend
able game of last year to thump Ben
Olson, transfer from Monlo J. C.,
6-2, 8-6.
Andy Roberts wasn't particularly
impressive in edging Paul Wilson,
transfer from Ventura J. C., in a
three-hour grueller, 8-6, 7-9, 8-6.
In the other two singles matches
Chuck Hopper, another Menlo trans
fer, defeated Harper Harry Ink, 6-3,
6-8, 8-6, and Tom Kruger stopped
Zook Sutton, a fast improving
sophomore, 8-6, 2-6, 6-2.
The doubles playing seemed to be
behind the singles performances
but this is probably because the two
top doubles stars. Schroeder and Dee,
were absent. With two teams com
posed of Hutchinson and Schroeder
and Dee and Wade, the Indians are
almost assured of two victories out
of three in all conference doubles
matches.
Don't discuss new military tech
niques or weapons.
