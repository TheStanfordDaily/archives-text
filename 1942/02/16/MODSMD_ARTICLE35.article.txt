# Frosh Hoopmen Drop Two Tilts
## 
### 
The silver lining in the cloud that
has all but engulfed the frosh hoop
season is getting mighty thin.
By now it is only post-mortem
chatter to discuss a rather thorough
job of tarnishing administered to
the Card hopes over the week-end
by Cal and the Poly High quints.
But, for the record, it must be
noted that the Cal tilt was on a high
plane with both teams knotted at
half-time with 18 points apiece. Sev
eral times the game was in the bag
for both teams, but late in the sec
ond hall' an attack by Cal's Hanger
put the Cubs on top at the gun,
41-36.
While not attempting to wail any
excuses for the Poly defeat, 42-32,
Saturday, let it be recorded that in
accepting the thumping handed out
by the prepsters and their center,
Ernie Filiberti, the local frosh were
(1) playing on a slippery floor which
had a hangover from the dance of
the evening previous, (2) playing
in a condition which can only be de
scribed as "shot" from the Cal lilt,
and (3) playing what is probably
the best team in Northern California
high school circles this year, riding
the "cinch train" into the San Fran
cisco finals.
The Cal games remain as the last
chance, and the practice sessions
until then will do some drastic over
hauling. On March (!. at Stanford,
and on March 7. in Berkeley, the
final chapter will be written, either
in red or black ink, for the 11142
frosh hoop ledger.
