# Farm Rubers Trounce U.S.F. In Rough Game
## 
### 
In the first game of the inter- !
collegiate series the Stanford rugby j
team belted out an S-0 victory over j
the University of San Francisco
Saturday. The fracas was one in
which the San Francisco fifteen for
got all they knew about rugby in
the second half of the game and re
verted to American football.
Roger Laverty on offensive play !
and little George Jedenoff in his all
around work on the playing field
were standouts for the Indians.
Stanford's first tally came when Lav
erty booted a 25-yard penalty kick
to make the score 3-0 for the In
dians. After Vic Ramus, who played
center three for the Dons, fumbled
on his own three-yaru line, Jede
noff plunged over for the second try
of the afternoon and Laverty used
his educated toe to good avail to
make the score 8-0 and end the j
scoring for the game.
In the second half, what would
have been a good game of rugby
eventually turned into a slugging
match. Vic Ramus, Don footballer
last season, was Ihe sparkplug for I
the U.S.F. fifteen. Ramus frequently
got away from the Cards and scooted
down the sidelines for what looked
like a sure tally, but the Don plays
were frequently called back for
fouls.
Next Wednesday the Cards meet
the Britishers from the Orion a sec
ond time on Maloney Field at 3:30
p.m. The Stanford frosh meet the
Menlo Junior College team the same
afternoon at 4 p.m. on the frosh field.
