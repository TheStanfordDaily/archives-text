# Ski Team Trails At Nevada Meet
## 
### 
Winning both the individual and
team championships in the Down
Mountain race, but failing to place
at all in the jumping, Stanford's
touted ski team trailed in fourth
place at the end of the first day of
the Nevada Intercollegiate Ski Tour
nament.
Bobby Blatt, Farm ski star, won
the Down Mountain in 1.032 min
utes, giving the Card team 100 points
and the lead over the runner-up
University of Nevada's 97.04. Ne
vada, taking the first three places in
the jumping, gained a wide enough
point-margin in that field to put it
self on top in the day's totals. Cal
was second, Oregon State third,
while Cal Poly and U.C.L.A. held
lift h and sixth.
