### H. D. THOREAU 
HPHERE can be no action taken by any member of the Pacific Coast Con
ference concerning the adoption of the freshman eligibility rule until
the entire conference meets in session. There are tentative plans under
way for a meeting in the South in the near future, but nothing definite
has been done yet, so it appears that Stanford won't follow in the footsteps
of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton for a while at least.

A rumor to the effect that the reason that the yell leaders and the
band do not perform ;it the local basketball games is that the B.A.C. is
against it is entirely false.
As a Stanford student engulfed in a partisan mass of Californians
Friday night, ii was a little- disheartening to see five cheer leaders
and a large band "whooping it up" on their side of the pavilion while
we were represented hv one little yell leader (my apologies, Doc).
The situation is no better at home games.
Many times the visiting team has nearly as many supporters as we
have and they bi ing their cheer leaders along too. 1 wouldn't be sur
prised to see the Cal band walk in the next time we play them here. But
we will still have our one little man- if we're luekv.

AT DAVIS last Friday the only Stanford fighters that won were those
who knocked their men down during the course of the fight. Any
Card who didn't completely annihilate his opponent was given the short
end. ... At the same time that Bob Millington leaves the Farm to join
the armed forces, thus depriving us of some good discus material, Dick,
his brother, turns out for frosh track at Berkeley and seems to be their
best discus throwing prospect. . . . Angelo Luisetti is a father, as of last
week. . . . Fashion note: Don Leibendorfer's attire while cycling includes
white tennis shoes, rugby jacket, and white trousers. . . . For the second
time in several months U.S.C. is searching for a tennis coach. After Hal
Godshall died in an auto accident, John McDiarmid, a former high-ranking
player and a professor at S.C.. was installed as Trojan net coach. Now
John has lent his services to the Army so the post is vacant again.

4 }NE of the officials who worked Saturday afternoon's rugby game re
marked after the game to a Stanford rugger that it was a waste of
his time to come down here when the game was as rough as it was
Saturday.
This same player as well as the vest of the Indian fifteen could
hardly walk after the game cine to the U.S.F. Dons' method of play
ing the game. The aforementioned official also said that the Dons
could have won I he game if they hadn't played so "dirty."
Rugby as it should be played is not an extremely rough game, as
U.S.F., Santa Rosa J.C., and California—according to the British sailors -
seem to think it is.

time in several months U.S.C. is searching for a tennis coach. After Hal
Godshall died in an auto accident, John McDiarmid, a former high-ranking
player and a professor at S.C.. was installed as Trojan net coach. Now
John has lent his services to the Army so the post is vacant again.

4 }NE of the officials who worked Saturday afternoon's rugby game re
marked after the game to a Stanford rugger that it was a waste of
his time to come down here when the game was as rough as it was
Saturday.
This same player as well as the vest of the Indian fifteen could
hardly walk after the game cine to the U.S.F. Dons' method of play
ing the game. The aforementioned official also said that the Dons
could have won I he game if they hadn't played so "dirty."
Rugby as it should be played is not an extremely rough game, as
U.S.F., Santa Rosa J.C., and California—according to the British sailors -
seem to think it is.
HPHERE can be no action taken by any member of the Pacific Coast Con
ference concerning the adoption of the freshman eligibility rule until
the entire conference meets in session. There are tentative plans under
way for a meeting in the South in the near future, but nothing definite
has been done yet, so it appears that Stanford won't follow in the footsteps
of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton for a while at least.

A rumor to the effect that the reason that the yell leaders and the
band do not perform ;it the local basketball games is that the B.A.C. is
against it is entirely false.
As a Stanford student engulfed in a partisan mass of Californians
Friday night, ii was a little- disheartening to see five cheer leaders
and a large band "whooping it up" on their side of the pavilion while
we were represented hv one little yell leader (my apologies, Doc).
The situation is no better at home games.
Many times the visiting team has nearly as many supporters as we
have and they bi ing their cheer leaders along too. 1 wouldn't be sur
prised to see the Cal band walk in the next time we play them here. But
we will still have our one little man- if we're luekv.

AT DAVIS last Friday the only Stanford fighters that won were those
who knocked their men down during the course of the fight. Any
Card who didn't completely annihilate his opponent was given the short
end. ... At the same time that Bob Millington leaves the Farm to join
the armed forces, thus depriving us of some good discus material, Dick,
his brother, turns out for frosh track at Berkeley and seems to be their
best discus throwing prospect. . . . Angelo Luisetti is a father, as of last
week. . . . Fashion note: Don Leibendorfer's attire while cycling includes
white tennis shoes, rugby jacket, and white trousers. . . . For the second
