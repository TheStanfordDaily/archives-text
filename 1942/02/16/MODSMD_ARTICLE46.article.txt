ONCE again it is Monday morning and once
again it is time to ask the whereabouts of
the Stanford Band and of the yell leaders at
the week-end's basketball games.
Only one cheer leader, the head yell king
himself, managed to satisfy a portion of the
Stanford people in the Stanford section at the
Cal game in Berkeley Friday night. Granted,
there was no cause for an appearance of the
band or yell leaders before the insignificant
scattering of spectators at Saturday night's non-
Conference game.
At the Stanford-U.S.C. series, played on the
Stanford campus, there was no band and there
were no yell leaders.
At only one home game this season have we
been led in yells. This was a night when try
outees were being shown to the student body
preparatory to their appointments as assistant
yell leaders. Other than that, there has been
no effort made. Handling of the tryoutees is
another subject, but suffice it to say they were
insufficiently trained, from all reports.
There have been many students who have
asked The Daily to express their grievances
editorially on this latter subject and on the
B.A.C.'s stand in connection with the band.
Stanford has played some close games this
year, and it has lost some. Even with a cham
pionship team, "You can't win 'em all."
Maybe that impetus the team would receive
from some organized spirit in the Stanford
stands would pay off with a couple of winning
points. One thing is sure, it would be a lot
more fun for the spectators—and it doesn't pre
sent Stanford in the best light on radio broad
casts to have a conspicuously silent rooting
section.
It is difficult to ask the head yell leader for
an explanation, since the new one was elected
only last week. But previous inactivity this
season must be chalked up to his predecessor,
who showed no concern and made no move.
The band is sponsored by the 8.A.C., and
band members say they have not been asked to
play by the B.A.C. The reason seems to be
that the B.A.C. would have to forfeit the profit
on seat sales, if some 15 band members were
to bring their instruments and occupy a spot
in the center of the stands. It is doubtful this
saving is worth loss of the band and the spirit
it musters.
Remaining Conference games will be played
in the southland—the U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. series
—except for one home game with Cal and an
other at Cal.
Whether there should be any representation
of the band or yell leaders at the southern
games is debatable; that they should appear
at the Cal games is certain.
