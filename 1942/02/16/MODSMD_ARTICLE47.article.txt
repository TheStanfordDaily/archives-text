# 'Lock Him Out'
## 
### 
SINCE this quarter started 12 University liv
ing groups have been entered by prowlers,
and many valuable articles plus $100 in cash
have been stolen. Part of the blame for the
recent campus "crime wave" can be put on the
Stanford police department—not the quality
but the size.
Police Chief Gordon Davis has at least three
extra men patrolling the campus at night, but
the force is still inadequate. Three or four po
licemen cannot possibly give sufficient protec
tion to 33 fraternity and sorority houses and all
of the halls. The campus is too spread out.
But there is a solution to this annoying prob
lem. Students are in the main responsible for
"inviting" prowlers to take their valuables when
they leave their clothes, wallets, and purses
thrown over beds and tables. It isn't very hard
for anyone to take money when he doesn't have
to look for it. Wouldn't it be a good idea each
night before going to bed to hang clothes up
and put valuables some place where they can't
be found easily?
And there is another added protection. A
locked door is discouraging to a burglar. The
sororities keep their doors locked, but the fra
ternities say it is inhospitable to lock up at night.
Maybe that is the case, but is it inhospitable to
lock out prowlers?
Of course it is difficult to lock men's halls, but
practically every door on the campus has a lock
on it. Why not lock all rooms before retiring?
If we can help the police department by follow
ing these simple suggestions, the "crime wave"
will come to an end. It's worked before.—John
