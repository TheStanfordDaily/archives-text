### AMIE REICHERT 
r |' l HE escape of the German warships Scharnhorst,
Gneisenau, and Prince Eugen this past week-end
has shocked the freedom-loving world and made it
even more uneasy than it was over the siege of Singa
pore.
This event is another evidence of British bungling
which even Winston Churchill's eloquence can not ex
piate. The British once more have shown their inepti
tude and inefficiency to a shocking and dangerous
degree.
Those ships have been cooped up in the harbor at
Brest for a year now. In that time the R.A.F. has
made 110 raids over Germany and the Channel ports.
The R.A.F. has repeatedly bombed Brest, and those
very ships, according to their communique, not less
than 110 times.
Still, the ships, after that terrific lambasting, were
apparently in top condition else they could not have
risked the break through the Channel to the North
Sea.
The Japanese in several hours over Pearl Harbor
accomplished more than the R.A.F. was able to do in
all that time.
Equally shocking is the fact that the ships did get
through. They got through because the British had
no comparable ships in the Channel to send against
them, and because each German vessel was protected
from the air by an umbrella of 200 planes.
The R.A.F. engaged the units of the Luftwaffe and
brought down 18 enemy planes. They lost 42 planes
themselves.

IT BEGINS to look as though the British have muffed
the once-in-a-wartime opportunity Hitler's eastern
offensive handed them last June. It begins to look as
though they have failed to destroy the docks, indus
trial centers, and military objectives in Northern Ger
many and along the Channel that they have repeat
edly attacked.
The Germans now not only boast that the three
ships escaped unscathed, but that they have just com
pleted two new battleships of the Bismarck class.
(Meanwhile the British have lost four capital ships:
the Hood, the Prince of W;des, the Repulse, and the
aircraft carrier Ark Royal.)
You can't put a drydock in your pocket when the
enemy is overhead with his bombers. Why didn't the
R.A.F. blast those ships a-building? Why?

Brest for a year now. In that time the R.A.F. has
made 110 raids over Germany and the Channel ports.
The R.A.F. has repeatedly bombed Brest, and those
very ships, according to their communique, not less
than 110 times.
Still, the ships, after that terrific lambasting, were
apparently in top condition else they could not have
risked the break through the Channel to the North
Sea.
The Japanese in several hours over Pearl Harbor
accomplished more than the R.A.F. was able to do in
all that time.
Equally shocking is the fact that the ships did get
through. They got through because the British had
no comparable ships in the Channel to send against
them, and because each German vessel was protected
from the air by an umbrella of 200 planes.
The R.A.F. engaged the units of the Luftwaffe and
brought down 18 enemy planes. They lost 42 planes
themselves.

IT BEGINS to look as though the British have muffed
the once-in-a-wartime opportunity Hitler's eastern
offensive handed them last June. It begins to look as
though they have failed to destroy the docks, indus
trial centers, and military objectives in Northern Ger
many and along the Channel that they have repeat
edly attacked.
The Germans now not only boast that the three
ships escaped unscathed, but that they have just com
pleted two new battleships of the Bismarck class.
(Meanwhile the British have lost four capital ships:
the Hood, the Prince of W;des, the Repulse, and the
aircraft carrier Ark Royal.)
You can't put a drydock in your pocket when the
enemy is overhead with his bombers. Why didn't the
R.A.F. blast those ships a-building? Why?
r |' l HE escape of the German warships Scharnhorst,
Gneisenau, and Prince Eugen this past week-end
has shocked the freedom-loving world and made it
even more uneasy than it was over the siege of Singa
pore.
This event is another evidence of British bungling
which even Winston Churchill's eloquence can not ex
piate. The British once more have shown their inepti
tude and inefficiency to a shocking and dangerous
degree.
Those ships have been cooped up in the harbor at
Brest for a year now. In that time the R.A.F. has
made 110 raids over Germany and the Channel ports.
