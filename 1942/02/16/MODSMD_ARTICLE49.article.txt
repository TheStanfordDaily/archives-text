# BULL SESSION
## 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
I"JEAR SID: Had I looked at the calendar I might
have had some premonition of the debacle that
befell me last Friday, the 13th.
I suggested to Associate Editor John Horrall that
he try Bull Session. My absence, despite what the
editor so cruelly said, was voluntary and had nothing
to do with spring fever.
The truth of the matter is that I strained my eyes
last week when the boathouse opened. It was the
sun, you fool, and let's leave Renee out of this.
But to get back to Friday's column. I was abso
lutely confident that even if he was extra good, read
ership is lowest on Friday. I now feel that if reader
ship is lowest on Fridays everyone and his uncle must
read it other days.
I spent a harrowing Friday morning on the Quad.
Cries of: "best yet," "why this guy's good," "are they
going to fire you or just give you another job?" came
from those whom I counted as my friends.

r pO MAKE things worse, I got a most insulting val
entine in Friday's Campus Opinion, from the three
Fritter girls, apple, pineapple, and corn.
First they accused me of knowing the wrong Stan
ford women. This, as you well know, is untrue. Since
I first came to Stanford I have tried to get to know
the wrong Stanford women, and with no success.
They also accuse me of "carrying Stanford woman
hood down the ladder, step by step." This must be
some sort of an analogy. I could never carry a lot of
Stanford women on level ground, much less down a
ladder. I doubt if even Standlee could.
But the Misses Fritter are remarkable women,
don't kid yourself. They claim a six-point objection
to me and my column. This is the first time I ever
knew three women to agree on one point, let alone
six—with one notable exception, of course.
They end up by asking if I am frustrated. This is a
ridiculous question. They might just as well have asked
if I am a Stanford man, there's no difference.

VOSS really thought that he was in there when
he was asked to an up-row Valentine party last
night. Now he finds that the girls were fined two bucks
if they failed to show with someone. He's back to
worrying again.
Sun and War Time have combined to make the
boathouse really good. I was up there one day when a
strapping young fellow, obviously out to make an im
pression, strode to the edge of the dock, flexed all his
muscles in rotation, then dove in.
Coming to the surface for the adulation he expected,
he was surprised to have a young blonde thing ask
him the time. On his wrist was a very wet watch.

1 AST week my car spent four days and four nights
1 down near the Geology Corner. There was no real
reason for this except that I have inaugurated a per
sonal "let's walk" campaign with myself and kept for
getting to bring it home.
When I finally got around to picking it up I was
no little surprised to find two ear rings on the dash
board.
I assume that they were ear rings, although some
one thought that they might be dress clips. I do not
want to even consider this possibility.
To get back to the ear rings. I have them still, and
will gladly return them to the owner any evening but
Sunday. I always go to see Buck Rogers then.
I could of course turn them over to the lost and
found, but I like to think that there is an interesting
story behind them, and while I will not necessarily
print it, I am a little curious.
So long Sid. —Mike
