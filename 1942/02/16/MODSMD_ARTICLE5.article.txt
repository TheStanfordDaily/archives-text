# Dr. Fisher Says Future Peace Must Build 'World Community'

### VIC MINAHAN 
Editor's Note: This is the first in a scries of interviews in which
will be discussed the problem of the peace to follow the war.)

A post-war world in which the Allies will establish a political world
community compatible with that already created by science and technol
ogy was visualized yesterday by Dr. Harold 11. Fisher, professor of history,
in an exclusive interview with The Daily.
Dr. Fisher, who is vice-chairman of the Hoover Library Directors and

who has chairmanncd the Univer
sity-sponsored peace seminars this
year, stressed that if the Allies are
to be successful in creating a just
and lasting peace, they must recog
nize the changes that have taken
place in political, social, economic,
and technological fields.
PROFOUND CHANGES
"One of the fundamental consid
erations of the peacemakers should
be that there are going to be pro
found changes in our social and
economic institutions," Dr. Fisher
emphasized.
"War always makes changes; I do
not mean to imply that we will keep
our war organization after it's over,
but I do imply that we will not re
turn to our old pre-war institutions
and organization."
The failure of the peacemakers to
recognize this was one of the main
faults with the Peace of Versailles,
he said.
LOOK AHEAD
"The last peacemakers tried to re
make the world along 19th century
lines," he said. "Wo must be careful
to look ahead, not merely try to re
make the world on the hopes, preju
dices and ideals of the past."
Because of this necessity for look
ing ahead, the younger generation
must be consulted in the making of
the peace it is going to live under,
according to Dr. Fisher.
"It is going to be your peace, your
world. One of the main duties of the
younger generation of today, besides
doing its part in winning the war, is
to think about the peace to come—
discuss it among yourselves, argue
about it, write about it, so that when
the time comes for public opinion to
do its part in the making of the
peace, you will have clear ideas
about, it."
FUNDAMENTAL FACTORS
Returning to his discussion of the
fundamental factors the peacemak
ers must take into consideration, Dr.
Fisher said the Allies must base both
the peace and their post-war policies
on two principles; (1) collective se
curity; and (2) judicial considera
tion and review of international
disputes.
II collective security- the only way
in which aggression can lx> effectively
checked is to be made successful, a

degree of limited sovereignty is nec
essary, the professor stressed.
"However, the peace must take
into consideration the national eco
nomic needs—rather than national
aspirations—of all nations. No last
ing peace can be based upon perma
nent subjection of any people to
other people. That's the Nazi theory."
WORLD COURT
Dr. Fisher stated his belief that it
will be easier after this war to en
force ihe rulings of a World Court
or Association of Nations than it
was under the League of Nations
structure.
"The development of air power
and mechanized armies which strike
quickly will make it easier to main
tain the military apparatus for polic
ing the world. To make this effec
tive, of course, a general disarma
ment is necessary.
"This police force should ulti
mately be the agent of an interna
tional organiaztion, if degeneration
into the rule of the world by a few
powers is to be prevented," he added.
"The principle of self-determina
tion, along with nationalism and
racialism, is an anachronism of to
day. The last treaty did a pretty
good job of territorial allotment, and
its failure proves that more than
that is necessary," he commented.
