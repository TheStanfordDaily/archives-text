# CAMPUS OPINION
## RED CROSS STATION? 
### 
\ r JHHE EDITOR, SIR:
Bull Session had a very good point when it said
the girls weren't doing their share of war work. Our
point is this, if you want the girls to work, organize a
Red Cross station on campus where we can make
surgical dressings or do any other kind of work that is
needed. We all want to do our share but we all can't
take defense courses which necessarily demand extra
hours of study.
If a Red Cross office were set up, you would be sur
i prised how many girls would eagerly volunteer their
| services.

P.S.; A Red Cross station on a campus is not a new
idea; many eastern colleges have had them since last
spring.
