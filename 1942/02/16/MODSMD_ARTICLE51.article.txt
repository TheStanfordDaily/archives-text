# One Acts Fail To Put Ideas Across
## 
### 
"Grandfather Marquis," "Harvest
Time," and "And Then the Dusk,"
three one-act plays presented last
Friday and Saturday nights in the
Little Theater.
Only one of last week-end's Ram's
Head winners which "came off" was
Charles Trieschmann's "Harvest
Time," a delicate piece of fluff about
a man s search for physical perfec
tion in a woman — something he
never finds. The play was smoothly
directed, staged, and acted. Lisle
Selby's sophisticated—and frustrated
—Pygmalion was believable, and
Helen Livingston led the thoroughly
satisfactory cast of women with her
uninhibited telephone operator.
TWO PLAYS FLOP
"Grandfather Marquis" and "And
Then the Dusk" both rather flopped.
But while one toppled because of its
own weight, and the other seemed to
have been pushed—though not, of
course, deliberately. The plays were
related, however, by closer ties than
those of mutual failure; they both
involved serious discussion of con
temporary problems.
In retrospect, it would seem that
this business of presenting a play
with a "message" is difficult in terms
of immediacy. Ted Marcuses
"Grandfather Marquis" was set in
San Francisco on December 8, 1941.
We all played our parts that day,
and what's more, we remember. And
the problems of the Marquis family
seem pretty trivial and pretty con
trived. Not that anybody around
here did anything particularly mag
nificent; but the audience seemed to
resent the actors' confused heroics.
ANTI-NAZI PLOT
"And Then the Dusk" was set in
a German concentration camp. The
duty-bound Nazi father, and the re
calcitrant son was the dusty peg on
which the play was hung; but the
audience resentment wasn't there.
The State versus God or the Indi
vidual or what you will—it didn't
matter. Author Adolfo Arias said
what he had to say well—with rea
son and with deep feeling. And the
incidents were believable, perhaps
because we only know their general
shape. The details are hazy.
But here's the funny thing—and
not so funny at that. The bad play
was well staged and well acted. The
good one was so badly motivated and
directed—which may explain the
poor performances — that the play
was almost obscured. Very sad state
of affairs.—Nowell
