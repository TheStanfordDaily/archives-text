# 'Peight' Leaves Campus Police To Earn Wings
## Cop Prefers Cockpit To Squad Car; Heads For Arizona Airfield 
### 
The old "Pull over, buddy" of
Peyton Walmsley, the campus cop,
is no more, for Peyton, tall, dark,
and 27, has gone.
Walmsley, who has been a mem
ber of the Farm's police squad for
over a year, left Sunday for Iligley
Field, Arizona, where he is going to
Corps training course in the hope of
eventually getting his "wings."
"Peight," as he has affectionately
been known by all his motorist
friends on campus, enlisted as a fly
ing cadet last January 29 and plans
to spend several days in his home
at Calimesa, Calif., before going to
Chandler, Ariz., the town near
which Higley Field is located.
Walmsley's last day on duty upon
the Stanford highways was Satur
day.
When asked about his enlistment,
"Pcight" stated that, although he has
no dependents, he was not in imme
diate danger of being drafted, but
that he felt that he would rather be
in the Air Corps than in any other
branch of the service when it was
necessary for him to go, and that if
he had waited until he was drafted,
he probably would have been be
yond the Army Air Corps' maximum
age limit.
Before joining ihc Farm gendar
merie, Walmsley had three years in
the National Guard and, although he
failed to take his examinations for
an ofTicership, he feels that this ex
perience will probably be invaluable
in bis forthcoming flying course.
All of which will probably make
Peyton's Stanford job seems pretty
tame. There's quite a difference be
tween racing Stanford automobiles
and Jap bombers.
