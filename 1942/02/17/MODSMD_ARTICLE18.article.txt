WITH SINGAPORE now in their possession, Japanese may concentrate
on the "lifeline of China," the Burma Road. The above map shows the
Salween River, north of Moulmcin, where the Japanese push along a
50-mile front toward the Burma Road and India. The advance has been
halted by British artillery and airplanes.
