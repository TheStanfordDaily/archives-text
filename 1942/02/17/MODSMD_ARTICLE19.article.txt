### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1G (UP).—
A surging Japanese offensive by dive
bombers, artillery and ground forces
today heralded quick resumption of
a Japanese attempt to knock out
American defenses in the Philip
pines, irritating thorn in the side of
any all-out Japanese thrust against
the Indies.
General Douglas MaeArthur, com
manding battle - grimed American
and Filipino troops, reported that.
Japanese artillery blasted heavily at
his Bataan Peninsula positions dur
ing the last 24 hours and that enemy
aviation was "active."
Japanese ground forces, mean
while, sought weak spots in hit-run
stabs which resulted in "intermittent
infantry fighting" on "several sec
tions of the front."
Resumption of Japanese shelling
of the defense lines suggested that
the Japanese had completed the re
grouping of thir forces which Mac-
Arthur previously reported was un
der way, and were attempting to
soften up the American positions in
preparation for an all-out infantry
assault.
