# Medicine Stops Panicâ€”Dr. Wilbur
## 
### 
"Good, prompt medical care is one
of the best forms of insurance against
depression, panic, and rumor-built
hysteria," Dr. Wilbur declared in
Chicago in a report given as chair
man of the Council on Medical Edu
cation and Hospitals of the American
Medical Association at the Congress
on Medical Education and Licensure.
Dr. Wilbur stated that the care of
service men will make a heavy call
upon members of the medical pro
fession between 30 and 50. There
will be fewer doctors to serve civil
ians and, therefore, we can't slight,
the training of our medical stu
dents.
The answer to the problem is to
better our medical social work and
to organize our health services to
I lie extent where there'll be as little
drain on the doctor's time as pos
sible.
