# Japanese Drive South From Palembang, Bent On Huge Java Invasion
## Dutch Destroy Rich Oil Bases; Remove Stork 
### 
BATA VIA, Feb. 16 (UP). —Thou-
sands of Japanese swarmed south
ward tonight from Sumatra's burn
cd-out oil center of Palembang, only
an hour's bomber flight from here,
bent on a full scale invasion of Java.
Stripped by dynamite and (ire of
the oil stocks, wells and refineries
the Japanese had hoped to seize in
tact, the newly invaded Palembang
area was of value to the enemy only
as a base for assaults on Java.
The Dutch high command expect
ed the full blast of the Japanese
war machine to be turned against
this island at any moment.
DUTCH OUTNUMBERED
Dutch defenders, so heavily out
numbered they had been unable to
halt the barges that brought the in
vaders 50 miles up the Moesi River,
battled stubbornly in the tall jungle
grass around Palembang to delay the
Japanese advance.
All rolling stock was removed from
the area and tracks were twisted out
of shape to hamper the enemy in
following the railway that winds
southward to Teloekbetoeng, the
best port near the southern tip of
Sumatra, where Soenda Strait is the
only barrier to a crossing to Java.
HEAD FOR JAVA
United States, Dutch and British
bomber and fighter planes hammered
ceaselessly at the Japanese in the
invasion area, with special attention
to those speeding restoration of the
airdrome near Palembang for use as
their closest base to Batavia.
Informed observers here predicted
that the Japanese would strike at
Java before trying to subjugate the
rest of 1,000-mile-long Sumatra
north of Palembang. There formerly
were oil installations there but they
were destroyed recently.
