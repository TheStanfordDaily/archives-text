### 

THE BMKiEST BATTLE fought off England's shores since the defeat of the Spanish armada ended in ap
parent victory for the Nazis when a German battle fleet headed by the 26,000-ton battleships Scharnhorst and
Gneisenau and supported by a giant air escort fought its way through a gauntlet of British air and surface
craft and scattered into the mists of the North Sea. British and Nazi coastal guns joined in the free-for-all
as the German battleships and the 10,000-ton cruiser Prinz Eugen dashed from their harbor at Brest ap
parently for safer North Sea bases.
