George Jackson, A.S.S.U. Presi
dent, is a little bit stiff these days.
It seems that George, in one of 1
his more Bohemian moods, decided
to go bicycle riding last Saturday. I
He donned a gym suit and merrily
rode over hill and dale.
Merrily, that is, until he came to a
rather steep downhill slope with a
big bump at its bottom. George
swooped down the slope but he did
not see the bump and, as a result. |
George and his bicycle went down
with a resounding crash.
Now George is nursing four 1
stitches in his left knee, numerous
lacerations on his left elbow, a con- j
glomeration of bruises, and a slightly '
wounded pride.
He swears that the next time he
goes bike riding his vehicle is going
to be a tricycle.
