# Mermen Lose Injured Stars
## 
### 
Hard-hit by the loss of Doc Col
year and Ted Munroe, Stanford's
varsity swimming team will face the
University of Oregon Ducks here
Saturday afternoon at 2:30.
Colyear, who has been handicapped
by a knee injury from skiing over
Christmas vacation, decided (o call
it quits because of the pressure of
studies as well as the failure of the >
injury to heal properly.
Munroe, top 440 and 220 man, is
out for at least a week as a result 1
of an infected ear. There is a pos- j
sibilit}' he may be in the water Sat
urday but definitely won't be able I
1o practice this week.
To add to Coach Thornton's
troubles, Rey Rule, fast-improving
sprinter, may be called to the army
as a reserve officer at any time. He
probably will be moved from the
sprints to swim the 220 in place of
Munroe.
