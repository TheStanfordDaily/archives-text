# Deanless Cagers Will Face Bruins
## 
### 
Assistant Coaches Phil Bengtson
and Woodie Weir went to work in
the Pavilion yesterday to rebuild the
Stanford shock troops that next
Thursday entrain for Westwood and
the last two games of the Bruin cage
series. Head Coach Everett Dean
remained at home with a bad cold.
It looks as if the last half is the
worst half of this '42 basketball
slate: the Indians' next five games
will be played away from home.
After Friday and Saturday at the
U.C.L.A. camp, the Redskins re
turn here only to go back down to
Los Angeles the following week-end
for the remainder of the U.S.C.
series.
Following the Trojan encounters
in the Shrine Auditorium, the Dean
men come back to the home roost,
take a four-day respite, then trek
to Berkeley for their third encounter
with California. The final league
contest comes up the day after,
against Cal in the local Pavilion.
