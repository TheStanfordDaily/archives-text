"Promenade, I don't care where—
take your honey to a rocking chair."
Calls like this will start Stanford
students dancing at the Schottische
Swing at the Women's Gym 011 Sat
urday night from «S to 10. A group
of Schottischcrs from the Palo Alto
Community Center will present a
demonstration and lead Farm stu
dents in cowboy dances, schottische,
polka, and squares.
"You don't need dancing ability or
a date or money to have fun at the
Schottische Swing," said Dodo Paul
man and June Murphy, co-chairmen
of the Hospitality Committee.
The W.A.A. and the A.S.S.U. are
sponsoring the dance in an effort to
give Stanford students fun on cam
pus. It is the first informal get-to
gether of this kind, and plans are
being made for more of these
"swings."
