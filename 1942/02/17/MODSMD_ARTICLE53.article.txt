# Card Boxers Take on Cal In Rematch
## 
### 
After a doubtful draw with the
California Aggies last Thursday
night, Coach Clayton Frye's varsity
boxers are preparing for the second
University of California matches
which will be held Thursday in the
Pavilion.
From the record of last week's
fights, Stanford's team is definitely
improving. Ira Fishman, 155-pound
slugger, continued his string of
TKO's by getting his opponent,
Frank Baker, in the second round.
In the last Cal fight, Fishman was so
completely dominating the fighting
over Seymour Lewis that Coach Ed
Nemir threw in the towel, which is
permissible under intercollegiate
rules. This is Fishman's first year
of boxing, and he is considered to be
one of the most outstanding pros
pects of his weight class on the
Coast.
Hyland Hebart, perhaps the most
underrated man on the team, is
working hard to meet Cal's Dick
Wilson, one of the better 135-pound
fighters on the Coast. Wilson was
withdrawn at the last minute in the
first Cal fights, and Hebert had little
trouble with Roy Shaw.
Last Thursday Cal had little
trouble in downing U.C.L.A. by a
9-1 margin. From this performance
and their previous 6-4 victory over
Stanford, the Bears will again be
solid favorites to win. Milt Cunha,
Pacific Coast 165 - pound champion
and Cal captain, has returned to
form, and scored an impressive win
over his southern rival.
Frye hopes to double up in those
weight divisions in which both Stan
ford and Cal have an excess of fight
ers. These bouts count in the regu
lar point score.
