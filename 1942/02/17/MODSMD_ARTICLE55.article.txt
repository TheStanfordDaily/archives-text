### HANK THOREAU 
IJURING the last 100 minutes of actual playing time that the Stanford !
first-string basketball players have participated in—4o against U.S.C., j
50 against Cal, and 10 against the Athens Club—they have scored exactly
05 points.
That isn't a record to be proud of, particularly when the opposition
scores 74 points in the corresponding length of time. After the second team
got three points behind the Athens Club Saturday night, Everett Dean sent
in the "Highboys," or at least four-fifths of them since Don Burness didn't
suit up. Instead of being overawed by the vaunted lirst-stringers the
Clubmen immediately piled the lead up to eight points.
Even with the aid of a couple of timely baskets by "Harpo" Linari, the
"Highboys" couldn't close the gap to more than two points, finishing the
game two points farther behind.
It is hard to understand why (he present hoop team doesn't wax all
opposition when you look at them individually or when you see them on a
good night.
Let us hope that Stanford doesn't bog down again when it meets the
Bruins in the Westwood Pavilion. Last year a Uclan team vastly inferior
to this season's squad defeated us in one of our two games down there.
Our main opposition in the southern division, the Trojans, plays Cal at
Berkeley, which is no soft touch either, so we are not in danger of losing
the loop lead for a while yet.

r first man in Stanford swimming annals to go the entire 200-yard
breast-stroke distance using the butterfly was Hank Saltonstall, fresh
man from the islands, in last Friday's meet with San Jose. . . . He's some
relation to Governor "Saltay" Saltonstall of Massachusetts also. . . . Pete
Hatch was the frosh's third best backstroker so he couldn't swim in his
favorite event Friday since only two men are allowed from each team.
Undaunted Pete entered the 440 freestyle and went the whole way on his
back; and just to make the story complete, he won.

PASS the mustard Leland; it looks like Clark is going to hand us the
sandwich. . . . Was the absence ol Ted Schroeder and Larry Dee from
the tennis courts Saturday plus the Phi Phi initiation the night before just
a coincidence? . . . Guest writers Hank and Dave had a lab today so I
had to write it myself.

back; and just to make the story complete, he won.

PASS the mustard Leland; it looks like Clark is going to hand us the
sandwich. . . . Was the absence ol Ted Schroeder and Larry Dee from
the tennis courts Saturday plus the Phi Phi initiation the night before just
a coincidence? . . . Guest writers Hank and Dave had a lab today so I
had to write it myself.
IJURING the last 100 minutes of actual playing time that the Stanford !
first-string basketball players have participated in—4o against U.S.C., j
50 against Cal, and 10 against the Athens Club—they have scored exactly
05 points.
That isn't a record to be proud of, particularly when the opposition
scores 74 points in the corresponding length of time. After the second team
got three points behind the Athens Club Saturday night, Everett Dean sent
in the "Highboys," or at least four-fifths of them since Don Burness didn't
suit up. Instead of being overawed by the vaunted lirst-stringers the
Clubmen immediately piled the lead up to eight points.
Even with the aid of a couple of timely baskets by "Harpo" Linari, the
"Highboys" couldn't close the gap to more than two points, finishing the
game two points farther behind.
It is hard to understand why (he present hoop team doesn't wax all
opposition when you look at them individually or when you see them on a
good night.
Let us hope that Stanford doesn't bog down again when it meets the
Bruins in the Westwood Pavilion. Last year a Uclan team vastly inferior
to this season's squad defeated us in one of our two games down there.
Our main opposition in the southern division, the Trojans, plays Cal at
Berkeley, which is no soft touch either, so we are not in danger of losing
the loop lead for a while yet.

r first man in Stanford swimming annals to go the entire 200-yard
breast-stroke distance using the butterfly was Hank Saltonstall, fresh
man from the islands, in last Friday's meet with San Jose. . . . He's some
relation to Governor "Saltay" Saltonstall of Massachusetts also. . . . Pete
Hatch was the frosh's third best backstroker so he couldn't swim in his
favorite event Friday since only two men are allowed from each team.
Undaunted Pete entered the 440 freestyle and went the whole way on his
back; and just to make the story complete, he won.
