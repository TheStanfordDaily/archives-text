# Appropriation for Peace
## 
### 
APPROPRIATIONS for student activities have
. been cut this year due to expected en
rollment decreases during the war years, and
for this reason funds sufficient to provide for
the annual Stanford debate tour of the Eastern
and Southern states were eliminated in this
year's budget.
The debate manager will probably ask for
an added appropriation of 5250 at tonight's Ex
Committee meeting to allow for this trip, and
if it is granted the two or possibly three men
who will go will pay part of their expenses, as
is customary.
The Daily recommends the granting of the
debaters' request for only one reason. That
reason is the subject which will be argued pro
and con across the country in debates with
universities of major standing.
The subject is, "Resolved: That after the war
a new federation should be formed to establish
the principles of the Atlantic Charter (Roose
velt's and Churchill's Eight Points)."
Because this war is being fought by the
"younger generation," responsibility for the
peace will even more belong to the younger
generaton. It is our war and our peace.
Because of these trips, Stanford is perhaps
as famous for debating and public speaking as
for football and basketball back East. Many of
the debates are broadcastâ€”last year Stanford
debaters were heard over the air from Colum
bia, University of Chicago, Harvard, and Vassar.
Because it seems imperative that at least a few
students in different sections of the country
plan for the peace that is to follow, The Daily
heartily endorses the debaters' probable re
quest for an additional appropriation tonight.
Latest report from the B.A.C. on the band
at basketball games is that they would be
glad to have the band play, and that the band
doesn't even have to be asked by the B.A.C.
Let's cjet together on this thing, boys.
