# Life Blood Needed

### 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY is playing a great
part to help the United States in its defense
work. Special laboratories, courses, and re
searches in practically every field of national
defense are being conducted.
In order to continue this work financial sup
port is absolutely necessary. Tonight, tomor
row, and Thursday 64 members of the Stanford
Family, representing the Family Call, will visit
alumni and friends of the University living in
Palo Alto and neighboring communities.
Because of the national emergency most per
sons will be less willing to contribute than they
have been in the past. To counteract this handi
cap the Stanford Family Council has decided to
call only upon friends and alumni who have
helped in the past.
It is certain that many of the callers will be
asked, "Why does everyone ask for money
at times like this? First it's the Red Cross, the
Community Chest, and now Stanford."
The answer to that guestion is obvious. "Stan
ford is a gift supported school not tax-sup
ported like the University of California and
like the Red Cross and the Community Chest
the University gets its life blood from friends
and alumni."
So, good luck, Bob. You have an excellent
committee with which to work. Now it's up
to you, John Horiall
