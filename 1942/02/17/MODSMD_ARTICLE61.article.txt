r I , HE trouble, you see, is that we aren't tough enough
about this. The trouble is that we don't act as
though we realize that war isn't war at all these days
unless it's totalitarian, all-out war.
That means all-out on the home front as well as
the fighting front. And that means totality of effort
not only on the battle line and the assembly line, but
in the cities and towns and villages, along the docks
and railroads and power plants, in the homes of aliens,
and in all their likely meeting places.
That means that we cannot afford to show mercy
or patience to saboteurs and spies. That means
that letting a convicted Nazi spy oil' with a two-year
prison sentence and a scolding is absurd. In Germany
Laura Ingalls would have been shot. In Russia Laura
Ingalls would have been shot. Brutal? Of course, but
war isn't a pleasant business any way you look at it.
Germany shows no mercy to spies and saboteurs;
neither does Russia. Much as you may scorn these
two governments' internal policies, the fact remains
that they have produced the only two successful war
machines of this war. Much as you may despise to
talitarianism, the truth still holds that it can fight a
war and win it. Much as you may deplore coercion,
the fact remains that war cannot be won without unity,
and if the unity is not voluntary, then it must be
forced.
And that is a great part of the secret of Hitler's
success and of Stalin's success.

\\ 'ALTER LIPPMANN last week wrote several col
umns about the alien situation in California. He
made it quite clear that he believed that there was a
very definite and a very dangerous threat to the U.S.
war effort in the presence and the activities of the
enormous Japanese population along the California
coast.
He declared that communications between the aliens
and the enemy have been established, and are being
used. He said that the threat of sabotage all along
docks, and power plants is very real and very great.
He urged that drastic steps be taken. He emphasized
the fact that not nearly enough has been done.

r IWKE the case of the Normandie. Pearson and Allen
reported from Washington Sunday that there were
gasoline-soaked mattresses aboard the ship, and that
when firemen turned on the hoses, gasoline came out
instead of water.
There's no proof of this, but it is just as plausible,
if not more so, than the theory that the fire was
accidental. For one thing, we know that the ship was
not at all adequately guarded against sabbotage.
Apparently the Navy Department is not satisfied
with the "accident" theory either, for Knox has au
thorized an investigation.
The Normandie fire is the sort of thing that can
not., must not happen if we are to win this war. If the
investigation shows sabotage, and the criminals are
apprehended, they should receive treatment as tough
as any the Nazis or the Russians would dish out.

not only on the battle line and the assembly line, but
in the cities and towns and villages, along the docks
and railroads and power plants, in the homes of aliens,
and in all their likely meeting places.
That means that we cannot afford to show mercy
or patience to saboteurs and spies. That means
that letting a convicted Nazi spy oil' with a two-year
prison sentence and a scolding is absurd. In Germany
Laura Ingalls would have been shot. In Russia Laura
Ingalls would have been shot. Brutal? Of course, but
war isn't a pleasant business any way you look at it.
Germany shows no mercy to spies and saboteurs;
neither does Russia. Much as you may scorn these
two governments' internal policies, the fact remains
that they have produced the only two successful war
machines of this war. Much as you may despise to
talitarianism, the truth still holds that it can fight a
war and win it. Much as you may deplore coercion,
the fact remains that war cannot be won without unity,
and if the unity is not voluntary, then it must be
forced.
And that is a great part of the secret of Hitler's
success and of Stalin's success.

\\ 'ALTER LIPPMANN last week wrote several col
umns about the alien situation in California. He
made it quite clear that he believed that there was a
very definite and a very dangerous threat to the U.S.
war effort in the presence and the activities of the
enormous Japanese population along the California
coast.
He declared that communications between the aliens
and the enemy have been established, and are being
used. He said that the threat of sabotage all along
docks, and power plants is very real and very great.
He urged that drastic steps be taken. He emphasized
the fact that not nearly enough has been done.

r IWKE the case of the Normandie. Pearson and Allen
reported from Washington Sunday that there were
gasoline-soaked mattresses aboard the ship, and that
when firemen turned on the hoses, gasoline came out
instead of water.
There's no proof of this, but it is just as plausible,
if not more so, than the theory that the fire was
accidental. For one thing, we know that the ship was
not at all adequately guarded against sabbotage.
Apparently the Navy Department is not satisfied
with the "accident" theory either, for Knox has au
thorized an investigation.
The Normandie fire is the sort of thing that can
not., must not happen if we are to win this war. If the
investigation shows sabotage, and the criminals are
apprehended, they should receive treatment as tough
as any the Nazis or the Russians would dish out.
r I , HE trouble, you see, is that we aren't tough enough
about this. The trouble is that we don't act as
though we realize that war isn't war at all these days
unless it's totalitarian, all-out war.
That means all-out on the home front as well as
the fighting front. And that means totality of effort
not only on the battle line and the assembly line, but
in the cities and towns and villages, along the docks
and railroads and power plants, in the homes of aliens,
