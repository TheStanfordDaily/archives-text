MEET INI It. NGIN
COME Stanford people have the amazing ability to
K have the most interesting things happen to them
in San Francisco.
The last to encounter fun on the hoof were Hallie
Jean Conn and Bill Davis. This couple visited the
city for dinner Friday and. according to them, enjoyed
it very much.
Deciding that a visit to Chinatown was in order,
they drove slowly down Grant Avenue. They were more
than surprised to have a Chinaman suddenly jump on
the running board of their car and say, or probably
shout:
"That man is taking my car—follow him."
This conversation evidently took place in English
for Davis managed to find out just which ear the
Chinaman meant—there were quite a few on the street
at that time -and off they went in hot pursuit.
The Chinaman, finding it cold and precarious on the
running board, got inside the car. He introduced him
self as Low Davis introduced himself as Bill
Davis.
The car sped merrily on in what I like to picture as
the maddest Hollywood chase. Weaving in and out
among autos, trolley cars and other street traffic, for
15 minutes they followed the stolen car.
Gradually, with tantalizing slowness, Davis drew
abreast of the fleeing thief. Ever the quick thinker, F3ill
cautiously nosed the other car to the curb. The thief
came to a grinding stop.
Davis and Ngin jumped from the car to seize the
thief. The thief, with surprising presence of mind, said:
"call the cops," and sat down to wait.
Davis introduced himself and would have intro
duced had he been able to pronounce his name.
Soon the S.F. police arrived and took the man into
custody. on the other hand, took Davis and Miss
Coon into the "best spot you could hope to find and
just around the corner."
Mr. bought them chop suoy, told them his life
story, and what he thought about the world, and Davis
and Miss Coon came away feeling that they had had
a most enjoyable, if unusual, time in San Francisco.

the running board of their car and say, or probably
shout:
"That man is taking my car—follow him."
This conversation evidently took place in English
for Davis managed to find out just which ear the
Chinaman meant—there were quite a few on the street
at that time -and off they went in hot pursuit.
The Chinaman, finding it cold and precarious on the
running board, got inside the car. He introduced him
self as Low Davis introduced himself as Bill
Davis.
The car sped merrily on in what I like to picture as
the maddest Hollywood chase. Weaving in and out
among autos, trolley cars and other street traffic, for
15 minutes they followed the stolen car.
Gradually, with tantalizing slowness, Davis drew
abreast of the fleeing thief. Ever the quick thinker, F3ill
cautiously nosed the other car to the curb. The thief
came to a grinding stop.
Davis and Ngin jumped from the car to seize the
thief. The thief, with surprising presence of mind, said:
"call the cops," and sat down to wait.
Davis introduced himself and would have intro
duced had he been able to pronounce his name.
Soon the S.F. police arrived and took the man into
custody. on the other hand, took Davis and Miss
Coon into the "best spot you could hope to find and
just around the corner."
Mr. bought them chop suoy, told them his life
story, and what he thought about the world, and Davis
and Miss Coon came away feeling that they had had
a most enjoyable, if unusual, time in San Francisco.
MEET INI It. NGIN

K have the most interesting things happen to them

The last to encounter fun on the hoof were Hallie
Jean Conn and Bill Davis. This couple visited the
city for dinner Friday and. according to them, enjoyed
it very much.
Deciding that a visit to Chinatown was in order,
they drove slowly down Grant Avenue. They were more
than surprised to have a Chinaman suddenly jump on
the running board of their car and say, or probably
shout:
"That man is taking my car—follow him."
