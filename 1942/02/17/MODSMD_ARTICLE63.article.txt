# CAMPUS OPINION
## SORRY, PLEASE 
### 
r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
We wish to make? a public apology for the errors
that were made in the ballots, especially to those who
were directly concerned. We realize that no excuse is
valid, but the cause w;is probably because of divided
responsibility which normally would have been in the
hands of one person. Certainly every step shall be
taken to insure that the same error will not recur.
It was suggested in The Daily that the Election
Board is uninterested. As we should be, we arc more
Always before the 11 members have been more than
are properly handled.
The Daily was mistaken in saying that there tire
.'Â»() members of Election Board. The A.S.S.U. Constitu
tion under Article VII. Section (i, a, provides for a
chairman, eleven members, and assistants when needed,
suflicient t<> handle winter quarter elections. Because
suflicient to handle winter quarter lections. Because
<>t previous experience, we felt that since three of these
members were ineligible and one was sick, seven peo
ple would be enough to handle the election. The elec
tion was unusually complicated because of the large
number of candidates, and it was the largest winter
quarter election of our experience?. The results were
not affected by the small number of people who
counted the votes. The only ill effect resulting from
the few members present was that they were required
to work hard and long la>l Tuesday.

Election Board
