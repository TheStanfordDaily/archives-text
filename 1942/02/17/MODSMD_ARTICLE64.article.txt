# Iturbi Shows Fire, Charm At Keyboard
## 
### HELEN LIVINGSTON 
It was not only the superb tech
nique of pianist Jose Iturhi that
made the audience at (he Concert
Series last night practically stand up
and cheer, hut it was the brilliance
and lire with which he played. In
fact, so easy and effortless was his
performance that it was difficult to
realize just how magnificent is his
technique.
The first half of the program was
far superior to the second. The two
Scarlatti sonatinas were performed
with marvelous precision and great
charm. The Haydn Sonata in D Ma
jor was treated with a lightness and
grace lacking in most readings of
this type of work.
CHOPIN SONATA
High point in the evening was
Chopin, at which Iturbi excels. The
Sonata in B Minor brought cheers
from the audience for its finesse and
brilliancy. The encore, Chopin's Fan
tasie Impromptu, although pretty
hackneyed at best, was beautifully
presented.
Liszt's arrangement of the Gomez
aria from "Salvator Rosa" was not
very good music, but an excellent
show piece for Iturbi's talents.
No one knows whether the pianist
forgot to play the Liszt Hungarian
Rhapsody, No. 11, scheduled on the
program, or if he was just tired of
it all. Anyway, it never did make
an appearance.
Iturbi's superb rendition of three
preludes <>f George Gershwin again
brought home the tremendous loss
that the untimely death of this com
poser has been to American music.
These three brief pieces show Gersh
win's great t>ift for expressing the
mood and feeling of our times.
ITURBI'S OWN
Rather banal, though undeniably
tuneful was Iturbi's own composi
tion, "Cradle Song." The program
ended with the inevitable "Triana"
by Albeniz. This sort of thing is, of
course, the Spanish pianist's forte,
and it was a pretty exciting per
formance.
Generally speaking, the part of the
program following the intermission
was rather anti-climactic, but after
the Chopin sonata almost anything
would be. Iturbi's appearance here
was an entirely successful one; his
pleasing personality charmed his
audience and his superb playing
completely won them over.

CHOPIN SONATA
High point in the evening was
Chopin, at which Iturbi excels. The
Sonata in B Minor brought cheers
from the audience for its finesse and
brilliancy. The encore, Chopin's Fan
tasie Impromptu, although pretty
hackneyed at best, was beautifully
presented.
Liszt's arrangement of the Gomez
aria from "Salvator Rosa" was not
very good music, but an excellent
show piece for Iturbi's talents.
No one knows whether the pianist
forgot to play the Liszt Hungarian
Rhapsody, No. 11, scheduled on the
program, or if he was just tired of
it all. Anyway, it never did make
an appearance.
Iturbi's superb rendition of three
preludes <>f George Gershwin again
brought home the tremendous loss
that the untimely death of this com
poser has been to American music.
These three brief pieces show Gersh
win's great t>ift for expressing the
mood and feeling of our times.
ITURBI'S OWN
Rather banal, though undeniably
tuneful was Iturbi's own composi
tion, "Cradle Song." The program
ended with the inevitable "Triana"
by Albeniz. This sort of thing is, of
course, the Spanish pianist's forte,
and it was a pretty exciting per
formance.
Generally speaking, the part of the
program following the intermission
was rather anti-climactic, but after
the Chopin sonata almost anything
would be. Iturbi's appearance here
was an entirely successful one; his
pleasing personality charmed his
audience and his superb playing
completely won them over.
It was not only the superb tech
nique of pianist Jose Iturhi that
made the audience at (he Concert
Series last night practically stand up
and cheer, hut it was the brilliance
and lire with which he played. In
fact, so easy and effortless was his
performance that it was difficult to
realize just how magnificent is his
technique.
The first half of the program was
far superior to the second. The two
Scarlatti sonatinas were performed
with marvelous precision and great
charm. The Haydn Sonata in D Ma
jor was treated with a lightness and
grace lacking in most readings of
this type of work.
