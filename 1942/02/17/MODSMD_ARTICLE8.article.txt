# Houses, Hall Heavily Hit By Prowlers
## Special Policemen Posted in Row Area To Snare Looter 
### 
Ten fraternity houses, one soror
ity, and Eneina have been entered
hy prowlers since the beginning of
the quarter, according to Police
Chief Gordon Davis.
To date only one suspect has been
held when Officer James Smith ar
rested a negro in the alley between
the Alpha Delt and Chi Psi houses
last week-end. After spending the
night in custody the suspect was re
leased without charge.
The Phi Kaps have been hit the
hardest by the prowler, with two
robberies in two quarters. The
Sigma Nu, Delt, Theta Xi, A.T.0.,
Alpha Delt, Phi Sig, Theta Chi, Theta
Delt, Chi Psi, and Chi Omega houses
have also had money and valuables
taken since the beginning of the
quarter.
ENCINA lIIT
At Encina two typewriters, two
watches, and some money have been
stolen. From the fraternity and
sorority houses almost $125 and two
rings are missing.
"We have been doing our best,"
Davis said, "but the houses don't take
any precautions. If the fellows would
put their clothes, wallets, and valu
ables away at night, we would be
able to put a stop to this thing."
To find out how easy it would be
to enter a house, 'Officer Peyton
Walmsley walked into the Fiji
house one night, stomped up the
stairs, flashed a light around the
sleeping porch, moved furniture, ran
down the stairs, and flashed a light
back on the porch without being
detected.
GORDY TAKES ACTION
Davis has put extra men on duty
to patrol the Row, but the robberies
have continued.
"The prowlers don't have to break
into the houses," Davis said. "The
front doors are always open, and the
rooms are never locked. If you find
a suspicious person prowling around
your house, don't hesitate to call the
police, 3131."
