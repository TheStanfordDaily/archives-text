# Debate Trip Sanctioned By Excom
## Haas Named Pre-Reg Chairman; Con Home Committees Selected 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Excom decided last night to send
two debaters east for the annual de
bate trip.
This decision was rcached after
Roger Boas and Jim Frolik, repre
senting the Debate Council, present
ed the plan for Excom to allow $275
for expenses. Student Manager Jim
McKellar was the bulwark of the
opposition when he held that Excom
would show "very poor judgment"
in passing the measure because the
debaters were asking for more money
than they spent last year when the
debate budget was supposed to have
been cut this year.
It was pointed out that by voting
this amount, Excom would be vot
ing $275 for peace.
McKELLAR OPPOSES
"I believe we should let the Har
vard boys discuss the problems in
the East and the Stanford boys han
dle it in the West," McKellar an
swered.
Boas said that Stanford has been
considered along with Harvard,
Princeton, and Yale to try out for
Town Hall and We the People radio
programs.
"If this goes through," he said,
"the trip would give great publicity
to the school, and it would be a di
rect contribution toward Stanford's
war effort."
The motion passed unanimously,
two members not voting.
