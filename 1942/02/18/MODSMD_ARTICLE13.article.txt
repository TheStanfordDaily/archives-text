# Are We Losing the War?

[An Editorial)
WE Stanford students are mostly sensitive to the war through
our bellies and on wheels—we are getting less sugar, food
prices are higher, and tires are hard to find.
We are also to a large degree bewildered, like most college
students and most citizens. Like a dizzy boxer, we keep wonder
j ing what to do next after each new blow . . . Pearl Harbor,
Manila, Singapore.

What the surrender of Singapore means is this:
The debacle may add five years to the war. It may mean
only mopping up operations are necessary for the Japanese
in the southern Pacific—the Netherlands Indies, British New
Guinea, and possibly the loss of Australia and New Zealand if
Port Darwin falls. With the fall of New Guinea, Torres Strait
would be controlled by the Japanese sufficiently to force Allied
shipping to detour around Australia, increasing the distance from
San Francisco to Port Darwin from 7,773 miles to about 10,000
miles, and correspondingly to Rangoon, Banda Shahpur in India,
and Port Said.
This would mean the loss of protection for convoys to Burma, j
India, and Suez, and the maintenance of these lifelines is vital.
It may mean the throttling of the Burma Road, the immobili-1
zation of China, and resulting implications in the Middle East may
close every avenue of approach to the Mediterranean but Gi- j
braltar.
It means that right now we are losing the war.
It means that the United Nations are almost wholly dependent
upon the United States for a victory, and right now the nearest
U.S. bases to the European continent are the British Isles and
Pearl Harbor. Most authorities agree, however, that the first step
necessary is to clean up the Japs.
It means that every man-jack must buckle down not only to
out-produce the enemy but to out-murder the enemy.

The power of the United States has been gaining momentum
for months, and for the past year the efforts of this country have
been dedicated to "National DEFENSE." Every time you turn
around—read an ad, listen to the radio, consider volunteering,
get drafted, save sugar and tires, date on-campus—it's for Na
tional Defense.
If we are to win this war we should fight in the name of
"National OFFENSE." It's time we dropped the negative and
assumed the positive—"the best defense is the best offense."
From here on let our all-out effort be for National Offense in
government publicity and private advertisements and in the
newspapers and over the radio.
Every ocean and every continent is involved in the battle to
apprehend the criminals and to give freedom to the oppressed,
and this purpose depends on United States leadership. We must
realize we are on the offensive.
