# DR. CLINCHY TALKS TODAY
## Lunch Club to Hear 'Lessons in Morale' 
### 
Dr. Everett R. Clinchy, president
of the National Conference of Chris
tians and Jews, will speak at the
Luncheon Club this noon in the Nit
ery. His subject will be "Lessons in
Morale for an America at War."
Dr. Clinchy, a Presbyterian min
ister. was a member of a "flying
team" of clergymen who made a
flight to London a few months ago
to learn at first hand the social and
religious trends among the embat
tled British. They interviewed gov
ernment and church leaders, educa
tors, students, workers, and busi
ness men on the effect of the war
on the churches, the development of
co-operation among citizens of dif
ferent religious faiths, and the cur
rent thought about the post-war
world and a reconstructed social
order.
Dr. Clinchy is the author of a
number of books on intolerance and
its causes, including "All in the
Name of God." The National Con
ference of Christians and Jews, of
which Dr. Clinchy is president, was
organized by former Chief Justice
Charles Evans Hughes to promote
co-operation among Protestants,

Catholics, and Jews in America.
This speech, according to Dr. D.
Elton Trueblood in charge of ar
rangements' for Dr. Clinchy's ap
pearance. should be of particular in
terest at this time. American in
volvement in the war is producing
questions of morale in this nation
similar to those that were found by
the religious leaders in Britain.
More and more people will be turn
ing to religion for relief from the war
