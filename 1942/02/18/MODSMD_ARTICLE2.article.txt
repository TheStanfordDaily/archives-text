# Chief Watch Officer Rible Waits for Air Raid Warning
## 
### 
Hank llihle is one man that really appreciates his day off.
Hank is the chief watch officer at the defense control center; for six
days a week he sits by his radio from 7 in the morning until 7 at night,
awaiting air raid signals.
It's dark when Hank comes to work and the sun has gone down when
he leaves for home; so when Sun->

day rolls around, he gets out in
the sun with a vengeance.
Hank's groundhog existence is
vital to Stanford's defense for air
raid warnings and other defense
measures are handled through his
office, sometimes called the "nerve
center." The control center receives
relayed messages by radio from the
4th Interceptor Command head
quarters, co-ordinates the system of
local wardens, calls out the mili
tary, and is generally the key de
fense center in case of emergency.
An intricate local phone system
connects the center with headquar
ters of each defense area and a
chief warden and his alternate are
on call at all times. The primary duty
of the watch officer is to pull the
siren switch warning the community
of enemy planes.
Night shifts at the "nerve center"
are handled by Pete Gadd, George
Kaufman, Hap Everett, Bill Ber
reysa, Charley Mc√ürian, and Mac
McLean.
