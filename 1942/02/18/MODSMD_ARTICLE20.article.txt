# F.D.R. Calls Washington 'Rumor Factory,' Lashes At City's 'Cliveden Set'
## President Condemns Capital's High Society' for Spreading Falsehoods About Navy's Damage, Aid to Russia 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP).—President Roosevelt today described
the nation's capital as a vicious rumor factory and a prolific source of war
rot and lies spread by what he termed the Cliveden Set of Washington.
He asked reporters at his press conference lo give wide circulation to
his charges because,, he said, he and they can prove their accuracy. He

.did not identify members of the so
called Cliveden Set — an appellation
heretofore applied to a wealthy
group of pre-war Nazi appealers in
Great Britain—but he denounced
them in extremely blunt terms.
This set in Washington, he pro
tested, is responsible for the spread
ing of rumors that Russia will be too
| powerful for the democracies after
the war if she gets additional finan
cial and material help from the
United States. He blamed it also
for the rumor that damage to the?
U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor was
greater than officially reported.
NKW KUSSIA LOANS
The President's attack came after
he confirmed that plans are under
way to make a new loan to the So
viet Union, a loan which he said
would have strategic value in terms
of dead Germans and smashed tanks.
His blast at the Cliveden clique re
called the furor he created a fort
night ago when he charged the capi
tal is crowded with parasites whom
he invited to leave and make room
for indispensable war workers.
He specifically pointed an accus
ing finger at top drawer social lead
ers who own large homes in fash
ionable downtown areas which are
rarely occupied whereas thousands
of girls and men who have come here
for war work are packed into over
crowded and unsanitary rooming
houses.
LIONS' INDIGNANT
The President's invitation hit the
cocktail lounges and the "400" with
a bang. The local newspapers were
: filled with "letters to the editor"
j from indignant social lions and pa
| tricians, politicians, hangers-on, and
I others who felt they had been done
| a rank injustice.
Mr. Roosevelt devoted a large part
of his conference to torpedoing the
so-called rumor factory. He hit also
at speculation about this country's
ability to defend itself in any set
of circumstances under which the
Axis might attack.
