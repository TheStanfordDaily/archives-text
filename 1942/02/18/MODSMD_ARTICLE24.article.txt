### 
LONDON, Feb. J7 (UP).â€”Prime
Minister Winston Churchill today
challenged a restive Parliament to
throw him out if it could find a bet
ter man, and said that damage in
flicted on the German battleships
Gneisenau and Scharnhorst in the
battle of Dover Strait would keep
them "out of action for some time
to come."
Refusing to discuss the fall of
Singapore, Churchill warned Com
mons again of the gravity of t fit
situation in the Far East and "how
terrible are the forfeits that have
been and will be exacted from us."
While shunning a blunt demand
for a vote of confidence, he never
theless made clear that he was stak
ing his policy on a full dress debate
of the war next week in which "the
House is absolute master."
