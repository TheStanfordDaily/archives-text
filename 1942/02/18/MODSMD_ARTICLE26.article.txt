Ihe committee, Davis continued,
found that the University needed 22
million dollars exclusive of expan
sion costs, and that $11,700,000 of that
amount is now collected or listed as
future expectancy. But as to future
i xj.ectancy, the committee discov

'I fust effort, he said, is divided into
three sections: laboratories, which
are being enlarged to handle war
research; educational speed-up,
which puts the school year on a
four-quarter basis; and the Stan
ford Family, many of whom are al-
Kady in uniform, and all of whom
are taking a vital part in the war
effort.
"The job of obtaining fuel for the
Stanford machine," Davis concluded,
"is our job tonight."
