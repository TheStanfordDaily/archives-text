# GUARDIANS OF PACIFIC COAST
## 
### 

U.S. FORCES are prepared to protect the Pacific Coast against any
invasion attempt. Scattered throughout the Pacific Northwest area are,
above, these mm. anti-tank guns. Note the sandbagged roof and
walls of the emplacement covered with evergreen boughs. Below,
"somewhere in the Pacific Northwest," an Army machine gunner
stands guard in a beachhead emplacement.
