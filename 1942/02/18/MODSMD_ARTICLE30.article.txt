# Daily Maroon Figures Show Defense Lack
## Chicago University Poll Surveys Army Training at Colleges 
### 
In a poll conducted by The Daily
IVlaroon at the University of Chi
cago to determine the amount and
character of pre-induclion military
training available to college men
throughout the country, it was
clearly indicated (hat the average
male undergraduate is badly pre
pared for his inevitable life in the
armed forces.
The telegraphic poll was conducted
among 72 colleges and universities
throughout the country, one of
which was Stanford.
Reports from the polled institu
tions did declare, however, that vast
changes in curriculum.? were intro
duced after Pearl H;irbor. Over 74
new "defense courses" were re
ported by the 72 schools.
TRAINING COURSES
Pre-induction training is of two
kinds, basic training and specialized
training. Into the classification of
basic pre-induction military training
falls R.O.T.C. and similar units. The
defense courses fall into the special
ized training category.
Alter Pearl Harbor the poll re
ports that a number of institutions
requested the War Department for
establishment of military training
units, but because of increased pres
sure no such units could be estab
lished.
COURSES STANDARDIZED
Defense courses in subjects such as
"Morse Code," "Truck Driving," and
"Newspaper Chinese" served as a
counter-irritant and relieved some
of the pressure.
The poll also clearly indicates that
because of the wearing-ofT effect of
these newly devised defense courses,
there must be a closer co-operation
between the Army and educational
institutions to standardize defense
courses so that college men can be
assured that the specific training
will and can be utilized.
The poll was conducted in the be
lief that college men with the cor
rect training can give their full value
to winning the war in the quickest
way possible.
