WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP).—
The Navy Department tonight an
nounced that the Brazilian ship
Buarque has been torpedoed off the
Atlantic Coast.
The brilliantly lighted 5,000-ton
vessel was blasted to the bottom of!
the North Carolina coast early Sun
day morning by an enemy subma
rine.
The raider was sighted a half-hour
before the attack by several crew
members who felt in no danger, in
asmuch as their ship was Brazilian
and thus considered a neutral.
Forty-two survivors — 34 crew
members and eight passengers
were put ashore here yesterday.
Thirty-seven more were brought in
this afternoon.
The Buarque was the first South
American vessel sent to the bottom
in the Axis underseas warfare which
now has accounted for 16 vessels in
operation off the U.S. East Coast
since Jan. 14.
