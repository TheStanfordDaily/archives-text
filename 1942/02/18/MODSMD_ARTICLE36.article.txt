# Cards Out To Stop Top Bruin Ace
## 
### 
..It'll be "stop Handelsman" next
Friday and Saturday when Stan
ford's varsity basketball squad at
tempts to sweep the Bruins series in
the U.C.L.A. gym in Westwood.
Little Ernie, Bruin forward, kept
his head as the top scorer in the
southern division over the week
end, though stymied to a measly
seven points by Southern California.
Handelsman now has 72 and Roy
Tamm of California is second with
06. Stanford's Jimmy Pollard and
Ed Voss are next in line with (56
and 04.
The Bruins' stellar forward was
red hot against California two weeks
ago, scoring 24 in the first game and
29 in the second.
ONE CONFERENCE WIN
The Bruins won their only confer
ence game so far on Handelsman's
Saturday night spree, and it looks
as if the Uclans' future chances of
copping another southern division
victory depend on how sharp his
shooting is.
And on just how well Stanford
can bottle up Handelsman may
depend the chances of an Indian
win. "Ilandy" Handelsman, for
that's just what he is, completes
most of his baskets from the sides
and on a return pass and screen
from pivot man Marv Lee. With
its 6-foot-4 average, Stanford
should be able to stop Handels
man, if only the Indians stick to
him like glue.
Coach Everett Dean can't allow his
club to concentrate too heavily on
Handelsman, for there are plenty of
potential hotshots in Larry Gitler,
Bob Alshuler, and Mickey Panovich,
the remainder of the Bruin starters.
DEAN BACK TO WORK
Yesterday Dean returned to watch
practice in the Pavilion. Still suf
fering from a bad cold, the Stanford
coach surveyed the workout in street
clothes from the stands while as
sistants Phil Bengtson and Woodie
Weir handled the varsity.
The coming week-end's hoop re
sults promise to have a big effect
on the standings to date. South
ern Cal meets the Bears in a
doiibleheader at Berkeley, while
the Indians play U.C.L.A.
Right now the Redskins are one
game on top in the conference.
Should the Trojans take care of Cal
as is likely, and Stanford drop one
of its games to the Bruins, things
would be all tied up with the In
dians and Trojans deadlocked for the
lead with six wins and two losses
each.

the U.C.L.A. gym in Westwood.
Little Ernie, Bruin forward, kept
his head as the top scorer in the
southern division over the week
end, though stymied to a measly
seven points by Southern California.
Handelsman now has 72 and Roy
Tamm of California is second with
06. Stanford's Jimmy Pollard and
Ed Voss are next in line with (56
and 04.
The Bruins' stellar forward was
red hot against California two weeks
ago, scoring 24 in the first game and
29 in the second.
ONE CONFERENCE WIN
The Bruins won their only confer
ence game so far on Handelsman's
Saturday night spree, and it looks
as if the Uclans' future chances of
copping another southern division
victory depend on how sharp his
shooting is.
And on just how well Stanford
can bottle up Handelsman may
depend the chances of an Indian
win. "Ilandy" Handelsman, for
that's just what he is, completes
most of his baskets from the sides
and on a return pass and screen
from pivot man Marv Lee. With
its 6-foot-4 average, Stanford
should be able to stop Handels
man, if only the Indians stick to
him like glue.
Coach Everett Dean can't allow his
club to concentrate too heavily on
Handelsman, for there are plenty of
potential hotshots in Larry Gitler,
Bob Alshuler, and Mickey Panovich,
the remainder of the Bruin starters.
DEAN BACK TO WORK
Yesterday Dean returned to watch
practice in the Pavilion. Still suf
fering from a bad cold, the Stanford
coach surveyed the workout in street
clothes from the stands while as
sistants Phil Bengtson and Woodie
Weir handled the varsity.
The coming week-end's hoop re
sults promise to have a big effect
on the standings to date. South
ern Cal meets the Bears in a
doiibleheader at Berkeley, while
the Indians play U.C.L.A.
Right now the Redskins are one
game on top in the conference.
Should the Trojans take care of Cal
as is likely, and Stanford drop one
of its games to the Bruins, things
would be all tied up with the In
dians and Trojans deadlocked for the
lead with six wins and two losses
each.
