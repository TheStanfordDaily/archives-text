# Frosh to Open Track Season
## 
### 
The freshman track season opens
Saturday, Feb. 28—lower division vs.
upper division. And with this meet
in the very near future, Coaches
"Pitch" Johnson and "Pete" Couch
are mustering their chargers with an
optimistic outlook.
"There have been no time trials as
yet." stated Couch. "That's the pur
pose of this inter-school competi
tion. It will be our first indication
of what each man can actually do."
Leading the frosh in the 440-
yard dash, the team's strongest event,
are Bob Sears, John Fulton, and
Bruce Meyer, all of whom hit close
to 50 flat in high school. The pres
ence of Fulton and George Grimes
in the 880 brought forth a spark of
optimism from Pitch Johnson.
The sprints will be well handled
by footballer Jim Pettit, A1 Hoisch.
| Dick Hambleton, and Irving Mittel
j man. Pettit and Hoisch are said to
have run the century in 9.8. The
lone miler and two-miler for the
freshmen is stocky Larry Grey from
LaJolla.
Coach Johnson is very fretful
about the hurdles and the pole vault.
The freshman high jumpers, how
ever, bring a spark of interest to the
track aspirant's eye. Don Landale
cleared 6-3 in high school, and Ross
Dana soared 6-2, Jack Flammer and
Bob Cole have possibilities.
Ed Chenoweth. at this stage of the
season, appears to be the first man
in the shot put and discus. He will
be heavily pressed by Bill Sigurdson,
I Fritz Sanderman, and John Cham
pion.
Buy Defense Stamps and Bonds—
a real investment.
