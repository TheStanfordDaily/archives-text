# Kenworthy Will Referee Tomorrow's Boxing Match
## 
### 
Fighting fans will be assured of
good refereeing this Thursday when
Stanford takes on the California
pugilists at 8 p.m. in the Pavilion.
Coach Clayton Frye announced
yesterday that Capt. Jess Ken
worthy, U.S.N., will be in the ring
to see that the boys abide by the
Marquis of Queensbury rules. Ken
worthy, formerly stationed at Mof
fett Field, and a veteran of the
Macon crash, is an old-time boxing
enthusiast. He is licensed by the
State Boxing Commission, thus both
participants and fans will be sure of
getting a square deal.
Just to keep the evening military,
Colonel Harry B. Allen will be head
timer. Judges will be Harry B.
Smith, co-editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle, D. K. Stevenson. Joe
Skoff, and Joe Niderost.
Frye was smiling yesterday at the
improvement of his light heavy
weight, Pete Gadd. His rapid im
provement has been second only to
Ira Fishman, 155-pound knockout
specialist.
"Gadd's style is not deceptive or
flashy, but he has the ability to pace
himself well, and his punches are

straight and direct, packing a lot of
power," said Frye.
In the last Cal fights, Gadd deci
sioned Merrit Taylor. There is a
possibility, however, that Gadd may
trade blows Thursday with Roy
Greenwood, a three-year veteran
who is very highly respected in in
tercollegiate boxing circles. Green
wood decisioned Don Grant in the
first meeting of the teams earlier in
the month.
Johnson Chinn, the sparring mate
of veteran Frank Q. Hewitt, has
turned in some sparkling exhibitions
this week, and he may have a
double-up fight with Cal. In his
match with the Cal Aggies, Chinn
had his man staggering, yet lost a
very close decision to Jack Sham
berger. In the All-U tournament.
Hewitt decisioned Chinn in one of
the better bouts of the night. Chinn,
a sophomore, was novice champion
when a freshman, and has little
trouble keeping his weight within
the 145-pound limit.
The squad will go through easy ex
ercises today as a tapering-ofT of a
j hard week of training. A captain for
l the bouts will be elected tomorrow.

the better bouts of the night. Chinn,
a sophomore, was novice champion
when a freshman, and has little
trouble keeping his weight within
the 145-pound limit.
The squad will go through easy ex
ercises today as a tapering-ofT of a
j hard week of training. A captain for
l the bouts will be elected tomorrow.
Fighting fans will be assured of
good refereeing this Thursday when
Stanford takes on the California
pugilists at 8 p.m. in the Pavilion.
Coach Clayton Frye announced
yesterday that Capt. Jess Ken
worthy, U.S.N., will be in the ring
to see that the boys abide by the
Marquis of Queensbury rules. Ken
worthy, formerly stationed at Mof
fett Field, and a veteran of the
Macon crash, is an old-time boxing
enthusiast. He is licensed by the
State Boxing Commission, thus both
participants and fans will be sure of
getting a square deal.
Just to keep the evening military,
Colonel Harry B. Allen will be head
timer. Judges will be Harry B.
Smith, co-editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle, D. K. Stevenson. Joe
Skoff, and Joe Niderost.
Frye was smiling yesterday at the
improvement of his light heavy
weight, Pete Gadd. His rapid im
provement has been second only to
Ira Fishman, 155-pound knockout
specialist.
"Gadd's style is not deceptive or
flashy, but he has the ability to pace
himself well, and his punches are

straight and direct, packing a lot of
power," said Frye.
In the last Cal fights, Gadd deci
sioned Merrit Taylor. There is a
possibility, however, that Gadd may
trade blows Thursday with Roy
Greenwood, a three-year veteran
who is very highly respected in in
tercollegiate boxing circles. Green
wood decisioned Don Grant in the
first meeting of the teams earlier in
the month.
Johnson Chinn, the sparring mate
of veteran Frank Q. Hewitt, has
turned in some sparkling exhibitions
this week, and he may have a
double-up fight with Cal. In his
match with the Cal Aggies, Chinn
had his man staggering, yet lost a
very close decision to Jack Sham
berger. In the All-U tournament.
Hewitt decisioned Chinn in one of
the better bouts of the night. Chinn,

when a freshman, and has little
