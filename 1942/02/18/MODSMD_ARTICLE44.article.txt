### HANK THOREAU 
FJICK DUNKEL, the guy back in New Jersey who looks over 102 dif
ferent charts for every football game played each fall, has come
out with his basketball ratings again.
He evidently paid little heed to my insinuations of a few weeks back
because Colorado is still his number one team. Illinois and West Texas
State Teachers College are his second and third teams with Washington
still the only coast team in the running at sixth.
Several factors have piled up to make me doubt his rankings consid
erably. First, Colorado's big star, Bob "Baby" Doll played second fiddle
to Stanford's Tom Fuller when both were in junior college out in the
Southern California orange groves. Fuller is only on the second team here,
so Doll shouldn't be so good.
The Texas boys, who average 6 feet 6 inches, have been beaten twice
in their barnstorming tour of the East. Now resting in third place in the
Northern Division P.C.C. standings is Washington, supposedly the sixth
best team in the country. The Huskies have been beaten in four out of
their last five starts.
Maybe Dunkel doesn't use enough charts in his hoop ratings.

AT THE END of 30 minutes of play between U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. last
week-end the score was 35 to 11 in the Trojans' favor. At that time
Southern California's second team went in and the Bruins were able to
make 19 points in the final 10 minutes of play.
During the time that the Trojan first team was in the game they did
not fumble a pass or make a wild pass. Johnny "The People's Friend"
Luber kept Ernie Handlesman, league high-scorer, to one field goal.
From a look at these facts it appears that this coming week-end's games
at Westwood will be only warm-ups for the fireworks that will take place
in the Shrine Auditorium on Feb. 27 and 28. Then it will be decided
j whether or not the Pacific Coast play-offs will be held at the local pa
vilion or elsewhere. Since this year the play-offs are to be held within
i the Southern Division's jurisdiction and the San Francisco Civic Audi
torium is going to be in use, if Stanford wins, the crucial games with
W.S.C., O.S.C., or Washington will be here.

QUESTION of the week: Who was the best football team in the country
last year to lose games to California, Washington Slate, and Oregon
State? Answer will be printed tomorrow.
