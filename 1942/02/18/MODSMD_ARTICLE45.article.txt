A fast-breaking, inspired Firehouse
five last night poured it on in the
last minutes of play to surge ahead
of the title-holding Phi Psis and
win by a slim one-point margin,
25-24.
The upset threw the contest for
the League 111 championship into
a three-way race between Firehouse,
Phi Psi, and El Capitan. These three
will tangle next week in the league
play-offs.
Monte Pfyl and George Kaufman
led the winners with 7 points each,
while Tiff Denton was high-point
man for the Phi Psis.
The Phi Psi II squad didn't fare
any better than the big brothers,
bowing to the Biz School, 16-12. i
Johnny Stock led the winners with ■
6 points, and Bob Ditlevsen also :
scored six for the losers.
El Toro II made some sort of rec- |
j ord last night in not scoring a field

goal until the last two minutes of
play, when a lone swisher added to
two free throws gave th'em a total
of lour points. In the meantime
Kappa Sigma had rolled up a total
of 47 for one of the worst massacres
of the season.
Dick Reed led (he Kappa Sigs in
their scoring spree wtih 22 points,
and Bill MacGreevy was second
wtih a mere 14.
El Cuadro forfeited to Zeta Psi.
It was A.T.O. all the way in the
7 o'clock tilt at the Gym, as the Up
per Row men rolled over Breakers,
27-11. Jack Hieronymus was top
man for the winners with 10 points
to his credit, and A1 Wool was the
Breakers' high man with 6.
