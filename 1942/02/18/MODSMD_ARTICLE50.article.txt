# Plain Talk
## 
### 
YESTERDAY President Roosevelt did some
thing very unusual for him—he turned on
his press conference with bitterness and anger
in his voice and condemned in plain, blunt
words those who have made Washington a
vcious rumor factory and a prolific source of
war rot and lies."
This is plain talking. It is not the kind the
American people, used to the soothing reassur
ances of politicians who depend on the good
will of the voters for their continuance in office,
are accustomed to hearing.
But when President Roosevelt spoke as he
did yesterday he did two things: he proved that
the welfare of his country is to him more impor
tant than the good will of the social climbers,
political bureaucrats and the like who unfor
tunately abound so in our democratic system of
government; and he set a fine example for the
rest of the country.
Eor the problem of war rumors and idle talk
is no laughing matter. The inability of a people
to keep its collective mouth shut, to realize that
it is necessary in war to do one's duty with
efficiency and determination without stopping
to discuss every bit of idle gossip with a neigh
bor, is a sure sign of the "degeneration" in our
society that the Marxists and the Fascists love
to dwell upon.
President Roosevelt's denunciation was di
rected specifically toward Washington, but it
applies to every community in America.
That idle gossip and rumor are afoot in the
country is proved by their prevalence in as
supposedly educated a community as Stanford
University. For to pretend that this is not so,
that Stanford students and faculty members are
strangely immune to this evil, would be de
liberately blinding one's self to the facts.
A good example of this is the tale of a former
student, now a flier at Moffett Field, who was
on the campus recently and gave long and in
volved explanations of troop movements and
concentrations, his opinions as to the where
abouts of the fleet, and what strategic moves
of our armed forces could be expected in the
near future. And he backed up his statements
with facts and figures.
That a man in the armed service could talk
in this manner on this campus without being
rebuked is a sad commentary on the Stanford
student's sense of duty and responsibility.
Maybe this is too plain talking; maybe, like
President Roosevelt, we have insulted and hurt
individuals or groups by writing like this. If
this is so—if at least one student reading this
editorial feels a pang of guilty indignation —
we will be satisfied that we have done our part.

But when President Roosevelt spoke as he
did yesterday he did two things: he proved that
the welfare of his country is to him more impor
tant than the good will of the social climbers,
political bureaucrats and the like who unfor
tunately abound so in our democratic system of
government; and he set a fine example for the
rest of the country.
Eor the problem of war rumors and idle talk
is no laughing matter. The inability of a people
to keep its collective mouth shut, to realize that
it is necessary in war to do one's duty with
efficiency and determination without stopping
to discuss every bit of idle gossip with a neigh
bor, is a sure sign of the "degeneration" in our
society that the Marxists and the Fascists love
to dwell upon.
President Roosevelt's denunciation was di
rected specifically toward Washington, but it
applies to every community in America.
That idle gossip and rumor are afoot in the
country is proved by their prevalence in as
supposedly educated a community as Stanford
University. For to pretend that this is not so,
that Stanford students and faculty members are
strangely immune to this evil, would be de
liberately blinding one's self to the facts.
A good example of this is the tale of a former
student, now a flier at Moffett Field, who was
on the campus recently and gave long and in
volved explanations of troop movements and
concentrations, his opinions as to the where
abouts of the fleet, and what strategic moves
of our armed forces could be expected in the
near future. And he backed up his statements
with facts and figures.
That a man in the armed service could talk
in this manner on this campus without being
rebuked is a sad commentary on the Stanford
student's sense of duty and responsibility.

President Roosevelt, we have insulted and hurt

this is so—if at least one student reading this
