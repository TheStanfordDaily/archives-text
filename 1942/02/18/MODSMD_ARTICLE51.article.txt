### AMIE REICHERT 
'T'HE name Harold Guard has been more on the front
pages of the nation's newspapers this past week
than even that of Eleanor Roosevelt. He's been writ
ing all those stories about Singapore marked EXCLU
SIVE, and in ease you missed the by-line, as if you
could, he is United Press' Far Eastern correspondent.
Harold Guard had one of those rare newspaper
breaks which found him on the spot, on the inside,
when the big news about Singapore broke, and dur
ing many months preceding the Japanese attack on
Malaya.
The story he has to tell is at once a fascinating
and a terrifying one. He attributes the fall of the
great British naval fortress to "beaurocracy, com
placency, and a legion of fifth columnists."
He reports that the colonial bureaucrats who gov
erned Singapore refused to acknowledge the possibil
ity of an attack by land; they laughed at it. He says
that the smugness, the disinterestedness of the "gov
ernment time-servers" was appalling.
Naturally, mider these conditions, Singapore was
unprepared. Naturally the Japanese had unchallenged
air superiority all along the line. And no wonder the
Japanese did not once have to stand and fight their
enemy.
"The Battle of Malaya," writes Guard, as reported
officially probably gave the impression of a bitter, hard
fought defense. Actually it was a retreat planned from
day to day. Each day the Imperials fell back 10 miles
or so, 'on schedule.' "
* * # *
ROUNDS like France, doesn't it? The same Maginot
k Line Complex, the same treachery, both willful and
through negligence, the same smug false sense of se
curity.
The unique debacle that was France, a phenome
non so terrible, so incredible, for all the world to see
and remember and profit by, has apparently been
repeated.
Guard reports that it was a simple matter for the
Japanese to bribe the natives and enlist them on their
side, because they were resentful of the British traders
who had cheated them so many times. He says that
the once-thought, impenetrable jungle of the Malaya
peninsula had numerous hidden paths which the na
tives showed the Japanese.
So once more British colonial policy has been proved
a double-edged sword, to be turned back on the wield
ers in crucial times.
The Malayan natives were exploited, but the chances
are they would have fought for the British if the Em
pire had given them a great leader, a Lawrence of
Arabia, to unite them and place them alongside the
English soldiers. But the British muffed that one too.
Some of them wanted to fight anyway, but the Empire
had made no places for them in her preparations.
It is a terrible and devastating thing that stories
like the fall of France must be retold. It makes one
wonder just what it takes to teach people; it makes
one wonder if, after all, you can teach people.
At any rate, the United States now has two unholy
examples before it. Lest we forget. . . .

SIVE, and in ease you missed the by-line, as if you
could, he is United Press' Far Eastern correspondent.
Harold Guard had one of those rare newspaper
breaks which found him on the spot, on the inside,
when the big news about Singapore broke, and dur
ing many months preceding the Japanese attack on
Malaya.
The story he has to tell is at once a fascinating
and a terrifying one. He attributes the fall of the
great British naval fortress to "beaurocracy, com
placency, and a legion of fifth columnists."
He reports that the colonial bureaucrats who gov
erned Singapore refused to acknowledge the possibil
ity of an attack by land; they laughed at it. He says
that the smugness, the disinterestedness of the "gov
ernment time-servers" was appalling.
Naturally, mider these conditions, Singapore was
unprepared. Naturally the Japanese had unchallenged
air superiority all along the line. And no wonder the
Japanese did not once have to stand and fight their
enemy.
"The Battle of Malaya," writes Guard, as reported
officially probably gave the impression of a bitter, hard
fought defense. Actually it was a retreat planned from
day to day. Each day the Imperials fell back 10 miles
or so, 'on schedule.' "
* * # *
ROUNDS like France, doesn't it? The same Maginot
k Line Complex, the same treachery, both willful and
through negligence, the same smug false sense of se
curity.
The unique debacle that was France, a phenome
non so terrible, so incredible, for all the world to see
and remember and profit by, has apparently been
repeated.
Guard reports that it was a simple matter for the
Japanese to bribe the natives and enlist them on their
side, because they were resentful of the British traders
who had cheated them so many times. He says that
the once-thought, impenetrable jungle of the Malaya
peninsula had numerous hidden paths which the na
tives showed the Japanese.
So once more British colonial policy has been proved
a double-edged sword, to be turned back on the wield
ers in crucial times.
The Malayan natives were exploited, but the chances
are they would have fought for the British if the Em
pire had given them a great leader, a Lawrence of
Arabia, to unite them and place them alongside the
English soldiers. But the British muffed that one too.
Some of them wanted to fight anyway, but the Empire
had made no places for them in her preparations.
It is a terrible and devastating thing that stories
like the fall of France must be retold. It makes one
wonder just what it takes to teach people; it makes
one wonder if, after all, you can teach people.
At any rate, the United States now has two unholy
examples before it. Lest we forget. . . .
