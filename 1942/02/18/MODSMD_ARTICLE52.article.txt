IF YOU come to Stanford, go to class regularly, and
study in the Library, you can be reasonably sure
that you will leave with a diploma.
At the same time you can be almost certain that you
will leave with poorer eyesight than when you en
tered.
This, I realize, is not the most opportune time to
criticize the University for not spending money, but
at the same time I believe that the need for better
lighting in classrooms and in the Library is even more
important now than it ever has been.
All students are being asked to do more concen
trated and more efficient work than ever before.
Some of these students are going to join the armed
forces where good eyesight is a most important factor.
Good lighting is becoming more important than ever.
Some time ago the University realized that the
lighting in the Administration Building needed reno
vating. I cannot help but feel that this fact should
have pointed to an equally pressing need in other Quad
buildings. I do not begrudge the Ad Building workers
their fine indirect lights, I merely feel that the stu
dents should be shown as much consideration.
There is hardly a class room at Stanford that is
adequately lighted by daylight. Nearly all require arti
ficial light,
The worst example I know is the large classroom
in the Chemistry Building. This room has two electric
outlets with unshielded bulbs to light a room seating
well over a hundred people.

AMUSING story comes out of Yoscmite. Two
men from Modesto, acquainted with the dormi
tory set-up of last year, arrived late and having made
reservations, decided to go directly to the dormitory
and find their beds for themselves.
What they did not know was that now the women
are occupying the dorm that the men previously used.
Unable to find a bed, they stopped to inquire from
someone, and suddenly realized their mistake. They
retreated hastily and everything turned out all right.
The interesting thing is what might have happened
had they found beds without realizing where they
were. This is something that could happen to anyone,
even to a D.U.
