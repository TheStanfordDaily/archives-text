# CAMPUS OPINION
## DAILY REVIEWS 
### 
r rilE EDITOR. SIR:
Stanford .students have long tried to look to The
Daily reviews of concerts, plays, and the like for a
reflection of their merit as judged by a capable mem
ber of the student body. But it has been increasingly
difficult of late to swallow some pretty smug self
confidence, particularly the unfortunate tendency of
the reviewers to set themselves up as final authorities
on the canons of taste.
By its very nature a review of an artistic perform
ance must present largely the personal opinions of
the reviewer; that is one of its functions. However,
his .statements could be made more palatable by the
exercise of a little modest humility and avoidance of
callow debunking and galloping boredom such as that
displayed in yesterday's review of the Iturbi con
cert, which goes bouncing through the program dis
posing of one item as "rather banal," others as "the
inevitable Traina," and the Fantaisie Impromptu as
"hackneyed at best."
We do not wish to deny the reviewer's right to her
own opinions, or to maintain that she is wrong be
cause we may disagree with her, but when the reader
is catapulted by such cliches into the fallacious state
ment that the Liszt 11th Rhapsody "never did make
an appearance." we feel that we have just cause for
complaint, since its appearnnce was fully evident to at
least a few benighted souls in the audience who may
have heard it before.
May we suggest t little more circumspection in fu
tuiv reviews ot competent artistic performances"
