# Van Heflin Starred in 'Eager' Film
## 
### 
"JOHNNY EAGER," now playing
at the Fox-Stanford in Palo Alto.
j "Johnny Eager" is a Freudian
j flavored story of the boy from the
| other side of the tracks. With first—
I rate direction (by Mervyn Leroy)
j and a first-rate cast, it is also first-
I rate shoot-'em-up.
In the acting department, Lana
j Turner improves wifch each picture.
] (In other departments she had prac
tically no room for improvement.)
Individual laurels, however, must go
to a great actor, Van Heflin, who as
a philosophical souse, steals every
scene he plays.
He is the one friend of Eager
! (Robert Taylor), who is on parole,
i but who mixes up with the D.A.
(Edward Arnold) when he mixes up
I with the D.A.'s daughter (Lana
| Turner). There the story begins to
j tighten, aided by such artistic ef
| fects as the rumble of streetcar be-
I fore the slaughter.
The second-fiddle feature is a new
hacking, now without Larraine Day,
| of "Dr. Kildare," whose sparse plot
j begins exactly 20 minutes after the
I opening of the picture.—Covey
