Frank Walker, Stanford financial
vice-president, who flew to Wash
ington Feb. 3 to consult with high
United States Naval authorities on
the possibility Stanford might be
come an air cadet training center,
yesterday returned to his desk and
reported Stanford definitely will not
be used by the Navy.
"The Navy appreciates the fine
educational work Stanford is do
ing, and does not want to inter
fere at this time," Mr. Walker said.
"They will look elsewhere."
While in Washington Mr. Walker
conferred wilh Secretary of the Navy
Frank Knox, Assistant Secretary
James Forrestall, and Artcmus
Gates, head of the Navy air arm.
Both Mr. Forrestall and Mr. Gates
are personal friends of Mr. Walker,
who has known them during his 20
years as a businessman in New
York.
Mr. Walker added the officers
were very friendly during his stay
in the capital, and that he received
much help from Lieut. Comm. Paul
C. Smith, former editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle.
He commented he "encountered
all sorts of weather but good," in
cluding two blizzards, during his
eastern trip, and that "it is surpris
ing how much difference a few
miles (between Reno, Nevâ€ž and
Sacramento) can make in the
weather."
