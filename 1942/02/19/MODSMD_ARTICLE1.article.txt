# Family Call Starts Off With $500 Contribution Given to Bauman, Gore
## Incomplete Tabulations Indicate Last Year's Total Already Passed; Crary Predicts It May Be Doubled 
### 
"Madame, won't you give us a contribution to help sec Stanford through
I lie war?" Thus, remotely, were a corps of «4 horse-sweating couples of
volunteer Stanford students soliciting six Peninsula communities in the
sixth annual Stanford Fund Appeal.
The lirst return was a $500 check, which was brought back bv Frank
I 1/ /•' n*. i r at J

Bauman and Kay Gore. Most of the
couples have not yet reported, ac
cording to Bob Crary, chairman of
Family Call, but the results to date
have already exceeded the returns
of last year.
DOUBLE LAST YEAR'S RESULTS
Last year's total return was about
$1500. "The way things are going
now, we're hoping to even double
last year's results," Crary said.
The Family Callers are routing
their hosts from bathtubs and bed
(as early as 8:i!0 p.m.), are being
frightened by watch dogs, and,
heeding Charlie Bull's warning, are
on the lookout for a certain estate's
pet lion. One couple mistook a pile
of clothes for a corpse.
CORBUS CONTRIBUTES
Among those called on by Rugby
man Ted Cole w;is Bill Corbus,
former Stanford Ail-American fool
ball player, with whom a successful
visit was reported.
The strangest coincidence so far
was experienced by Ross Hughes,
whose parents were recently evacu
ated from Singapore. He called on a
couple that turned out to be old fam
ily friends and former neighbors in
Malaya.
The drive, which got under way
with a kick-off dinner Tuesday, is
to be completed tonight. Bob Crary
reiterates that the money is to be
turned in at room 3 of the Old Un
ion, between the hours of 1 and 4
p.m. and 7 and 10 p.m.
