# British Troops Turn the Tide Again in Libya
## Rommel's Axis Troops Fall Back to Tripoli Before Allied Drive 
### 
CAIRO, Feb. IK (UP).â€”Gen. Er
win Rommel's Axis desert troops
have fallen back 20 miles west along
the Libyan coast, from Gala/a to
Tinimi, in the face of a terrific Brit
ish air offensive which has carried
all the way to Tripoli, front dis
patches said today.
It was not clear whether British
ground forces were following up
their new advantage, but a commu
nique said the battle line now ex
tended from Tmimi to Mckili, in
stead of from Galaza to Mekili. This
meant 20 miles had been chopped
of! the line's eastern end by Axis
withdrawals.
BENGHAZI BLASTED
The communique also said Impe
rial troops were fanning out over a
wide area south of the 65-mile fight
ing line without meeting any oppo
sition. "Fighting patrols" and mobile
columns, protected by RAF fighters
and bombers, made these sorties
into the desert, guarding the British
left flank against encirclement.
The RAF announced that it had
blasted the port of Benghazi, 120
miles back of the fighting line, and
that "violent explosions in the har
bor areas illuminated the whole
town, and were followed by fires
and other explosions."
TRIPOLI STRUCK
At Tripoli, main Axis supply port,
JtAF planes struck at the harbor and
railway centers.
A military commentator said there
were three possible reasons for the
apparent breakdown in Rommel's
offensive: (1) He found the Imperials
stronger than he cxpected and with
drew; (2) he never intended a full
scale offensive, but wanted to test
the British defenses with a series of
sharp counter-attacks; (3) he plan
ned an offensive but found himself
deprived of air power after heavy
losses in combat with the RAF.
