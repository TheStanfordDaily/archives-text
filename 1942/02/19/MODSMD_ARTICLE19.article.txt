! blackout was to be expectcd came at
8:20 p.m. when the alert signal was
Hashed to the control center from
the Interceptor Command. The
"blue" signal (get. ready) came at
8:28, but the "red" signal (blackout)
did not come through until 9:02.
The all clear came at 9:20.
"It all went very well here (at the
control center)," said Kaufman.
"No, the Interceptor Command
doesn't give us the reason for the
blackout. Whether it was real or
not, it's good for us."
Stanford University had its sixth
wartime blackout last night and air
raid officials on duty expressed them
selves as "very satisfied" with the
way it was carried out.
The signal for a general blackout
was received by George Kaufman in
the Farm's control center at 9:02
from the Fourth Interceptor Com

; at the control center, immediately
; pulled the switches that turned on
! the two campus sirens (one atop the
j Hoover Li be and the other in the
j Corp Yard) and switched out all
street lights and lights in the Quad
| arcades.
MOBILIZATION GOOD
A few minutes after the wail of
the siren, R.O.T.C. units began to
form at their designated places, air
raid wardens began tours of their
sectors, checking all lights that were
not turned out, and first aid helpers
assembled at their stations.
According to J. B. Wells, professor
of civil engineering and the watch
officer in charge, reports from the
sector wardens showed that the cam
pus responded "very well" to the
signal.
The library was emptied within
| th ree minutes of the first warning.
At the Daily Shack, blackout pa
per on the windows proved ineffec
