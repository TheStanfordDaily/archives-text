# Comic Chappie Out Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Chappie is coming out tomor
row instead of the traditional Wed
nesday due to a conflict with the
Carillon, Business Manager Bill Lane
stated yesterday.
The Chappie art editor, Frank Q.
Hewitt, created a new campus char
acter—Repulso, the Zcte, who is the
scourge of the Cellar.
"In fact, this is the first all-cartoon
comic book that the Chappie has
ever put out," said Barney McClure,
editor of the Farm humor magazine.
McClure went, on to say that not
only are Stanford's favorite funnies
in this issue — Ickday Acytray,
Smilin' Jerk, and Super Fella, but
also there arc guides to those im
portant campus figures who call
themselves "Big Operators."
