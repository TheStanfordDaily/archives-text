## Real Warning Follows Skit by 15 Minutes 
### 
With a warning from the announc
er' to keep cool in case of a warn
ing, "the siren on the stage is a
j part of the show," then to have a
! real air raid warning announced,
I the "Radio Show of 1i)42," presented
last night in the auditorium of Me
morial Hall, was packed with both
script-made thrills and the real
thing.
The first show, "Air Raid," was a
tense real-life drama of a village
where the approach of enemy bomb
ers was known but the warnings of
the "sergeants" were not heeded.
I Eva Schwartz as the old woman was
superb despite the fact that she lost
character in several spots.
Jeanne Smith, the sick woman,
and Lisle Selby, the announcer,
; were outstanding in their - roles of
building up the plot to a thrilling
climax.
"Wealth of the West," the second
play, was not as convincing as "Air
I Raid," possibly because the air raid
i broke into the middle of it.
The final number, "Winds of Free
j dom," featured a stirring story of
i the final closing of the University
| of Leyden, backed up by the excel
! lent singing of the Palo Alto Com-
J munity Chorus.
i Although called the "Radio Show,"
1 last night's program was not broad-
I cast but was carried on in the man
! ner of a radio program. The pur
! pose of the show was to obtain reve
| nue and interest for Stanford's radio
work.

Don't discuss movements or con
; centrations of Naval personnel or
; Marines.
