Speaking last night at the Inter
national Club meeting at the home
of Mrs. E. J. Thomas, Dr. Merrill T.
Spalding, assistant professor of his
tory, declared that he believed Jo
seph Stalin would be one of the
leading men to formulate the world J
peace after the present war. Speak- |
ing on "The Russian War Front and j
Aspects for Future Peace," Dr. j
Spalding said he thought there was
every reason to believe Stalin would j
stand by the United States and the J
Allied nations.
"Stalin and his people have been :
j subjected to a great deal of propa- |
! ganda which is against the Nazi re- ;
I gime. Russia is not in a position to
back down now," Dr. Spalding de- i
clared.
"But what is more important than
the present war," continued Dr.
Spalding, "is the peace that shall
I follow the war. Russia will go half- ■
way in meeting the United States in
1 determining the peace policy but the |
' United States will have to do all it
I can to help Russia with arms and i
J materials so the Russians can stave j
I off the German attack."
Dr. Spalding stated he had every j
i confidence that Russia would not j
j fall back in her campaign against
j the Germans in the spring.
