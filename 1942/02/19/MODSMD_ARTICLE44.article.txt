# Bear Boxers Offer Cards Return Shot
## 
### BOB WALT 
Stanford's boxing team has (he
opportunity tonight to satisfy their
hale for the University of California
in a rematch card at S p.m. in the
Pavilion.
The team again finds itself the
underdog, and rightfully so, for Cal
boasts of an eight-man squad that
is composed of six veterans, one of
whom is a Pacific Coast champion,
and another the runner-up in his
weight division in the regional cham
pionships. Cal won the first matches
(i-4 after Stanford forfeited two con
tests, which later turned out to be
I lie margin of victory.
lIEBERT MEETS LARSON
Hylurid Hebert will tangle with
Ewald Larson, one of Cal's many
veterans of the ring. Hebert has not
been defeated in any of his 135-
pound fights. The slugging sopho
more beat Harry Hicks in the AU-U
fights, decisioned Roy Shaw in the
closest and most thrilling bout in the
first Cal matches, and had little
trouble with John Anderson of the
Cal Aggies last week.
Blue and gold Coach Ed Nemir
has slated to start Bob Torney in
the 145-pound division. Torney is
one of two newcomers to the Cal
squad. He will take on Stanford's
only veteran, Frank Q. Hewitt.
McEVILLY READY TO GO
Nemir will start veteran Bob Mc-
Evilly in the 155-pound class for the
first time this season. He was kept
out of all previous matches because
he was slow in rounding into shape,
but should be ready to give Ira
Fishman a good bout. Fishman
scored a t.k.o. in 1 minute in the
third round over Seymour Lewis.
Indian Coach Clayton Frye is look
ing for a suitable candidate to fill
ihe 165-pound spot vacated by vet
eran Jim Thurmond. Cal will put
Captain Milt Cunha, Pacific Coast
champion, in the ring.
GADD OR GRANT TO START
Either Pete Gadd or Don Grant
will fight in the light-heavyweight
division, depending on Grant's
weight at weigh-in today at 2 p.m.
Jack Thorburn is definitely a fa
vorite in the heavyweight class.
Last year he worked his way up
into the finals of the Coast meet, only
to lose to Stanford's great fighter,
John Ward. Either Grant or Bob
McNeil will wear the Cardinal
trunks. Thorburn decisioned Mc-
Neil earlier in the month.
