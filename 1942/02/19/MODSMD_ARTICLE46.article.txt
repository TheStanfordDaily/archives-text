# Papeese to Meet U.S.F. Frosh Tomorrow Night in Cage Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh cagers will play the University of San Francisco first
year men Friday at (»:3<> p.m. in the Pavilion in a newly scheduled match
that fills in the Farm's hoop week-end.
With the varsity in the Los Angeles for a duo with U.C.L.A., the frosh
take over all the limelight, and the tilt with the Don yearlings will he

one of the stiffest of the year, Poly
High and Paly High not excepted, j
As a matter of fact, the Dons edged '
the Poly quint in an early season
struggle, so one gets the idea that
it might be another toughie. They
also took the Santa Clara frosh.
KNOW PLAYS
Last night, the frosh first-string
ers became familiar with the Don
plays that the Stanford reserves
were using, and Coach Phil Bengt
son tried to snap up the play with
some key replacements. It looks like
a good bet, though, that it will be
the same first string for the rest of
the season.
Reserve material has done a big j
share this season, usually playing j
most of the second game on any par- |
ticular two-night stand. The subs |

will see a lot of court-pounding this
week-end in the game with the Sa
linas J.C. team. From latest statis
tics, the "lettuce lads" are firmly
lodged on the ground floor of the
junior college race with only one
win to comfort tears over eight as
sorted losses. Incidentally, the Menlo
J. C, team, nosed out by the Cards
by a single point, is running about
50-50 in the league.
FIRST STRING
The first-string set-up. Fred Par
sons and Bob Barsocchini at for
wards, Jack "Cowboy" Heald at Cen
ter, and Dave Brown and Bob Hall
at guards will probably open against
the Dons.
Barsocchini may be out Friday
with an infected foot, in which case
Herrick might get the nod.

year men Friday at (»:3<> p.m. in the Pavilion in a newly scheduled match
that fills in the Farm's hoop week-end.
With the varsity in the Los Angeles for a duo with U.C.L.A., the frosh
take over all the limelight, and the tilt with the Don yearlings will he

one of the stiffest of the year, Poly
High and Paly High not excepted, j
As a matter of fact, the Dons edged '
the Poly quint in an early season
struggle, so one gets the idea that
it might be another toughie. They
also took the Santa Clara frosh.
KNOW PLAYS
Last night, the frosh first-string
ers became familiar with the Don
plays that the Stanford reserves
were using, and Coach Phil Bengt
son tried to snap up the play with
some key replacements. It looks like
a good bet, though, that it will be
the same first string for the rest of
the season.
Reserve material has done a big j
share this season, usually playing j
most of the second game on any par- |
ticular two-night stand. The subs |

will see a lot of court-pounding this
week-end in the game with the Sa
linas J.C. team. From latest statis
tics, the "lettuce lads" are firmly
lodged on the ground floor of the
junior college race with only one
win to comfort tears over eight as
sorted losses. Incidentally, the Menlo
J. C, team, nosed out by the Cards
by a single point, is running about
50-50 in the league.
FIRST STRING
The first-string set-up. Fred Par
sons and Bob Barsocchini at for
wards, Jack "Cowboy" Heald at Cen
ter, and Dave Brown and Bob Hall
at guards will probably open against
the Dons.
Barsocchini may be out Friday
with an infected foot, in which case
Herrick might get the nod.
