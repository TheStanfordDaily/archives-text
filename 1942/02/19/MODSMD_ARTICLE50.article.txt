# Duck Mermen To Invade Pool
## 
### 
Boasting a strong, but inexperi
enced team, the University of Ore
gon mermen face the Stanford var
sity swimming team in the Encina
pools Saturday afternoon at 2:30 p.m.
Except for one senior and three
juniors, the team is composed en
tirely of sophomores. Nevertheless,
the Webfeet have already chalked up
a 50 to 19 victory over Oregon, win
ning seven of the nine events.
INDIAN SCORES GOOD
On the basis of comparative scores
the Indian mermen at full strength
would have a better than even chance
of beating the Ducks, who also are
swimming against San Jose State
and the Olympic Club on their trip
south this week.
However, injuries have taken
away Doc Colyear, co-captain and
backstroke ace, and Ted Munroe,
220-man—each top swimmer in his
event — while the Army may take
Rey Rule, next best 220 man at any
moment.
CARDS NOT OUT
Coach Nort Thornton's Card swim
mers are not yet out of the picture
and if several doubtful events fall to
the Farm swimmers they may pull
out with a victory.
If Stanford's Brad Young and Bill
Mapel can edge Oregon's Weitzel in
the 50-yard free style, and Stan
ford's Captain Don Smith can beat
Gerry Heustis and Bob Nelson in
the 100, the Cards have a chance.
