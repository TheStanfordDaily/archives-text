# Tennis Double Bill Set for Saturday
## 
### 
Farm tennis fans will be treated
to a double-header on the Stanford
courts Saturday afternoon. At 1:30,
on the regular varsity courts, the
varsity—with Sehroeder and Dee this
time — will take on the Peninsula
Tennis Club. The line-up is still
tentative, but it is probable that the
first six men on the ladder will play.
On the other courts, the Frosh
team will play Piedmont High,
starting at 2:15 p.m. Since Pied
mont is usually a very weak team,
Coach Johnny Lamb traditionally
plays the matches without the serv
ices of his top four men.
