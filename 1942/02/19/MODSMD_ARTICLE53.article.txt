Stanford's varsity quintet has been fuuiul by erstwhile head cage man
Everett Dean in a trio of second stringers: Leo McCaffrey. Freddie "Ilarpo"
Linari, and Jack Dana.
The play of these three in lust Saturday's Athens Club encounter was

a bright spot in the somewhat dull
Redskin hoop picture. McCaffrey hit
the bucket for an even dozen points, I
followed closely by Linari and Dana |
with 10 each.

Hooper, whose floor play excelled !

developing into a front-line subati- |
tute for the regular squad until he
unfortunately broke a linger and
will be out for some time.
