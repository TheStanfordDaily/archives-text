the taller Breakers in their win over
the shorter, inexperienced Phi Sigs.
Delta Chi sparked by Larry Wolf
and Chuck Taylor beat the Theta
Delt squad 21-15 to take the league
leadership in League,X. On the short
end of the 13-7 score at half time,

In the second half Cookie South
opened by scoring with a bucket,
followed by Taylor, Wolf, and Dar
Seeley to cop the game.
Alpha Delt slaughtered El Campo
20-4. Don Mapel and Bob Breckner
led the attack with G points.

Department, 39-27, and the Kappa
Sig-Fiji, Delt-A.K.L. games were
double forfeits.
The three-way tie in League 111
will be settled by a play-off between
the Firehouse and Phi Pais Tuesday
night, and the winner will play El
Capitan. Capitan got the bye in a
coin-flip.
Golf finalists are urged to see Ed
die Twiggs at the clubhouse and ar
range final play-off games. Horse
shoe winners should arrange play
offs. There will be no games tonight
because of the boxing matches.
