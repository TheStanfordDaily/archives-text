"Ninety-eight per cent of today's
advertisers are honest find sincere,"
maintained (Jarl S. Ohligcr, a noted
San Francisco executive, speaking
before a disappointing group of 20
or so in Encina lobby last night.
"Advertising is a widely spread
business," he stressed. "There is
employment in it for people of many
various interests â€” writers, artists,
lawyers, scientists, printers, or bus
inessmen. Preparation? There is
nothing you can do that isn't likely
to be of use to you."
The speaker gave a brief survey
of the various branches in the field
of advertising, including media, re
tail and manufacturer's advertising,
agencies, and actual production, with
an outline of some individual serv
ices connected with the field.
