DIRECTORS of publicity for many campus
functions have asked The Daily in the past
week to give them more space and better dis
play, usually requesting front page stories. Their
requests have almost all been preceded by
criticism that this paper is not carrying enough
promotion stories; that there is an over-empha
sis on war news which crowds out the desired
amount of campus news. This criticism is ac
knowledged by The Daily, and the staff will
make a sincere effort to satisfy its critics in the
future.

May we tell you a little story, however, before
you glance from this column to something else.
Yesterday in the much-storied Stanford mar
riage course students listened to a lecture on
the controlling of personal finances by Dr. Theo
dore Kreps of the Business School. He said
young married couples, in handling their fi
nances, must consider increased new taxes, and
went on to point out that many women may be
widowed by the war. In anticipation of such an
event, family finances should be secure, he
said, and married people should think ahead
and plan for this possibility.
Several girls giggled. The thought that they
might be widowed was funny to them.
Startled, Dr. Kreps "gave them a dressing
down." He told them this war will last for five
years, that 1,000,000 American men between the
ages of 18 and 23 will be dead either on the
battlefield or on the bottom of the ocean.
Some other students thought this was pretty
funny, too, and laughed. One of these persons
was at one time the president of a Stanford
sorority.
Maybe this person and her friends don't know
we are at war; certainly they don't know what
it means. They should read today's Campus
Opinion and the front page story on the same
subject.
This person's adolescent bliss, and that of her
friends, isn't just tragedy. It is criminal.

play, usually requesting front page stories. Their
requests have almost all been preceded by
criticism that this paper is not carrying enough
promotion stories; that there is an over-empha
sis on war news which crowds out the desired
amount of campus news. This criticism is ac
knowledged by The Daily, and the staff will
make a sincere effort to satisfy its critics in the
future.

May we tell you a little story, however, before
you glance from this column to something else.
Yesterday in the much-storied Stanford mar
riage course students listened to a lecture on
the controlling of personal finances by Dr. Theo
dore Kreps of the Business School. He said
young married couples, in handling their fi
nances, must consider increased new taxes, and
went on to point out that many women may be
widowed by the war. In anticipation of such an
event, family finances should be secure, he
said, and married people should think ahead
and plan for this possibility.
Several girls giggled. The thought that they
might be widowed was funny to them.
Startled, Dr. Kreps "gave them a dressing
down." He told them this war will last for five
years, that 1,000,000 American men between the
ages of 18 and 23 will be dead either on the
battlefield or on the bottom of the ocean.
Some other students thought this was pretty
funny, too, and laughed. One of these persons
was at one time the president of a Stanford
sorority.
Maybe this person and her friends don't know
we are at war; certainly they don't know what
it means. They should read today's Campus
Opinion and the front page story on the same
subject.
This person's adolescent bliss, and that of her
friends, isn't just tragedy. It is criminal.
