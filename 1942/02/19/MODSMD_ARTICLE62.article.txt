USUALLY new members of Ex Committee
come to their first meeting and just sit there
without opening their mouths to express an
opinion or to ask the why of this or that. Why
they don't speak up, no one knows— maybe
they're bashful.
Things are different this year. Tuesday night
the incoming members showed all the fire and
interest one could expect of veteran members;
one new representative had even been serving
on a sub-committee for a week and participated
in the report, offering valuable information in
the consideration of candidates for next fall's
Pre-Reg chairman.
The campus can feel proud of these repre
sentatives they're off to a good start.
