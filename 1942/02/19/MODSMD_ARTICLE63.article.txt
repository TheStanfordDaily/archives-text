IN a recent editorial, "Pork-Barrel Pigs," The
Daily stated that Congress had not made an
astute political move when the Senate voted
itself an extra $4,500 apiece, annually, cut itself
and the House into a good pension set-up, and
put the damper on the Byrd committee's report
on non-defense expenditures.
One of our readers answered the editorial,
saying that the pension system would make
Congressmen independent of constituents and
lead to more honest work in Congress. This was
not the issue at all. As the pension measure is
constructed, very few of our representatives
would be affected anyway.
What The Daily was arguing was the fact that
the American people, asked to make sacrifices
on every hand, could hardly wait to get their
hands on some of the boys at this fall's mid-term
elections.
Not only did mail pour into Washington last
week but press-led criticism got so hot that
Congress has threatened to take away the
second-class mail privileges of the newspapers
in retaliation.
Many people are fed up with the 77th Con
gress anyway and this latest series of deals,
sneaked by on the unanimous calendar, is cer
tainly, we repeat, not an astute political move.
