### AMIE REICHERT 
/ 'HARLEY, the printer, was sitting in the backshop
4 reading "Girl at the Crossroads," and I interrupted
him just at the point where the heroine was snow
bound in the Sierras with a man she didn't even
know.
He didn't want to talk about the foreign situation,
being much more anxious at that point to read on
and find out just how long it was going to take the
girl at the crossroads to get acquainted with the
stranger and choose her road.
But I insisted because I wanted to find out about
the Russians.
"The Russians, is it?" grunted Charley. "I haven't
heard a word about them for weeks."
You might judge from this that Charley reads the
Hearst papers, and as a matter of fact you would bo
right, but that isn't the only reason he hasn't read a
line about the Russians lately.
I don't read the Hearst papers, and I haven't seen
much about the Reds lately either.
The fact is that the excitement and tension over
Singapore and the Far East the past weeks has blasted
news of the Russian lighting front—still the longest in
the world—into the obscurity of the inside pages of
our newspapers.
Besides that, the war in Russia right now is at sort
of an in-between point. The cold weather, which nor
mally will last two more months, has helped the Red
Army immeasurably, but premature thaw in some re
gions slowed them down a bit last week.

iyiONDAY the Reds picked up again and launched
a new offensive which yesterday showed some
signs of developing into a major blow. The drive car
ried them to the old Polish border.
When the spring thaw comes, with its hub-high
mud a..d its torrential floods, the Nazi mechanized
units will be even more worthless than they were in
Russia's autumn mud.
But after that, Charley and 1 and the other ex
perts believe, after that will come the big Nazi spring
offensive, a drive which will use all the mechanized
might and air power of the German army.
This is inevitable, of course, and everyone—-most of
all the Russians —expect it. Meanwhile they are mak
ing a feverish attempt to remechanize their army,
which is weakest in tank and air power.
With their eyes on that spring campaign, the Red
Army is now driving toward three main objectives:
Leningrad, Smolensk, and Dniepropetrov.sk. With these
key spots in their control, they will be in a better
position to ward off the Nazis' blows when the time
comes.

that's what Charley and I decidcd as wc
discussed The Situation. Meanwhile the girl at
the crossroads had flipped a coin and it came up
heads. She chose the primrose path.
