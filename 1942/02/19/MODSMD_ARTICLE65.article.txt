### MIKE CHURCHILL 
FROM ME TO YOU
IT JUST occurred to me that perhaps some people
might be interested in knowing how this column
manages to come to you with your Wheaties every
morning.
I will admit that more people would probably like
to know "why," rather than "how," but that is a
rather delicate subject.
My "deadline" is 4 p.m. No matter what the word
"deadline" may sound like, and regardless of the puns
that could be made, it is presumably the very last
minute at which my effort for the day will be accepted.
There are two reasons why it is so early. You per
haps have noticed that this column that you are now
reading is wider than those in other parts of the
paper.
They are both done on the same machine but mine
must be done first and then the machine reset for the
narrower one.
This brings us to the second reason. This set up,
whereby I do all my work long before anyone else,
effectively prevents me from ever being less than a
day late in all the news.
By the time I am able to use any story or news it
has been thoroughly worked over by reporters, edi
tors, and the sports page. Every once in a while even
Campus Opinion manages to beat me by a full 24
hours.
If it ever occurs to you that perhaps I am groping
for subjects, and don't you think that right now I'm
not, please bear in mind my problem.
When I finally have it written I hand it to the
night editor. He reads it and because he knows that
any type is better than a blank space he begrudgingly
hands it to his Head Copy Editor, saying, "See if you
can possibly do anything with this."
After all mistakes have been corrected, and the con
tents effectively expurgated, it is sent out to the "back
shop," whence it shortly emerges as a mass of lead
type. This eventually becomes what you are now
reading.

morning.
I will admit that more people would probably like
to know "why," rather than "how," but that is a
rather delicate subject.
My "deadline" is 4 p.m. No matter what the word
"deadline" may sound like, and regardless of the puns
that could be made, it is presumably the very last
minute at which my effort for the day will be accepted.
There are two reasons why it is so early. You per
haps have noticed that this column that you are now
reading is wider than those in other parts of the
paper.
They are both done on the same machine but mine
must be done first and then the machine reset for the
narrower one.
This brings us to the second reason. This set up,
whereby I do all my work long before anyone else,
effectively prevents me from ever being less than a
day late in all the news.
By the time I am able to use any story or news it
has been thoroughly worked over by reporters, edi
tors, and the sports page. Every once in a while even
Campus Opinion manages to beat me by a full 24
hours.
If it ever occurs to you that perhaps I am groping
for subjects, and don't you think that right now I'm
not, please bear in mind my problem.
When I finally have it written I hand it to the
night editor. He reads it and because he knows that
any type is better than a blank space he begrudgingly
hands it to his Head Copy Editor, saying, "See if you
can possibly do anything with this."
After all mistakes have been corrected, and the con
tents effectively expurgated, it is sent out to the "back
shop," whence it shortly emerges as a mass of lead
type. This eventually becomes what you are now
reading.
