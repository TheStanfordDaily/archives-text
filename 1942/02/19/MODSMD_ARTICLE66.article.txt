# CAMPUS OPINION
## AN OPEN LETTER 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
This is an open letter to the men and women of
Stanford. 1 am writing it to let you all know how
you may all feci some day, unless we settle down to
this, our job of creating a better world. You have
all been told this before, you read it every day in the
newspapers, but I dare say you have still to come
face to face with the hardships, pains, and tragedies
which you must endure if this is to be accomplished.
The more you do now, the easier it will be later.
With what authority do I tell you this? With none
whatever I must admit. But, I have come face to face
with this reality and I found the shock almost too
much to endure. I was lucky enough to Ret over it.
and I am telling you this so that you may be spared
the pains if you arc willing to do something about it
now.
My two brothers and I were Stanford men, just
like any of you, and our futures perhaps as bright as
any of yours. The war was too far away and after all,
since it would never affect us, it was passed by as
something far away which only a European had to
experience. But like a thunderbolt it struck at us
and drove home to the very fiber of our roots an irre
parable damage! What do we have to show now? By
some stroke of misfortune my mother and sister. God
bless them, are being held as hostages by the Japs, my
father has paid with his life, and my two brothers are
valiantly fighting with Mac Arthur.
Yes. we took things too lightly. It hurts me to see
when I go to the city that the people there, and else
where too. still think that this is all a lot of fun. Let
it not be so with Stanford men and women. Let the
world know that you realize your duties, that you will
perforin them well for a quick victory, NOW!
Sincerely.

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
This is an open letter to the men and women of
Stanford. 1 am writing it to let you all know how
you may all feci some day, unless we settle down to
this, our job of creating a better world. You have
all been told this before, you read it every day in the
newspapers, but I dare say you have still to come
face to face with the hardships, pains, and tragedies
which you must endure if this is to be accomplished.
The more you do now, the easier it will be later.
With what authority do I tell you this? With none
whatever I must admit. But, I have come face to face
with this reality and I found the shock almost too
much to endure. I was lucky enough to Ret over it.
and I am telling you this so that you may be spared
the pains if you arc willing to do something about it
now.
My two brothers and I were Stanford men, just
like any of you, and our futures perhaps as bright as
any of yours. The war was too far away and after all,
since it would never affect us, it was passed by as
something far away which only a European had to
experience. But like a thunderbolt it struck at us
and drove home to the very fiber of our roots an irre
parable damage! What do we have to show now? By
some stroke of misfortune my mother and sister. God
bless them, are being held as hostages by the Japs, my
father has paid with his life, and my two brothers are
valiantly fighting with Mac Arthur.
Yes. we took things too lightly. It hurts me to see
when I go to the city that the people there, and else
where too. still think that this is all a lot of fun. Let
it not be so with Stanford men and women. Let the
world know that you realize your duties, that you will
perforin them well for a quick victory, NOW!
Sincerely.
