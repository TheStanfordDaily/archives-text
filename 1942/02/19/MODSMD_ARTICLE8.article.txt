### VIC MINAHAN 
(A "Stanford in the Service" Feature)
One Stanford man to whom the war has been much more than an un
real drama unfolding itself three thousand miles away has been Henry
McMicking, Sigma Nu '41.
lor "Hank," who, like many other Farm graduates is now serving with
the United States Army Air Corps, has since Dec. 7 received news of his

4, father's death in an enemy raid on
Manila, the capture of his mother
and sister by the Japs, and word
that his two older brothers are serv
ing with General M;icArthur's forces
in their heroic defense of the Bataan
Peninsula.
According to information received
j here, Hunk's father was killed in

one of the first
raids on Manila
after Pearl Har
bor. Mrs. Mc-
Micking and her
daughter were
in Manila at the
time, and are
presumed to
have remained
there.
The two broth
ers — Al, K. A.
'39, and Joe,

K.A. 29, were both pressed into
| service with Mac-Arthur's forces be-
I fore the war began. Joe is serving
l with the Air Corps as a wing com
mander, and Al, who took R.O.T.C.
j while at Stanford and received a
j commission in the Field Artillery as
j a result, is with that branch of the
I service.
Al worked on the Stanford Quad,
j while Joe's greatest distinction on
the Farm was being the roommate
of the great Ernie Nevers. Accord
ing to Hank, Ernie gave Al a "pretty
rough time."
