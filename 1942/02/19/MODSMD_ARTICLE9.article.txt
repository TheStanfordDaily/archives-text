# Scottische Swing Comes To Stanford
## 
### IRMA CUNHA 
'On-campus fun—let's have some
on-campus fun," has been the gen
eral cry of Farm students. "What
can we do on campus that's any
fun?"
The Schottische Swing on Satur
day night at the Women's Gym from
8 to 10 p.m. is the answer. W.A.A.
and A.S.S.U. are sponsoring two
hours of dancing to recorded Schot
tisches, polkas, cowboy dances, and
any kind of dancing the crowd
might want to do,
This shindig is free, date or no
date, and promises to be more fun
than a night up in the city. Dodo
Paulson and June Murphy, co
chairman of the hospitality commit
tee, will be there with other Stan
ford co-eds to welcome Farm stu
dents.
The party will be informal, with
the juke box providing the music.
Mrs. Everley of the Palo Alto Com
munity Center will be there to call
out the squares. She'll bring some
of her Schottischers along to help
Stanfordites with the Schottische, if
they want to learn.
The Schottische Swing is the first
on-campus affair of its kind, and if
reports are true, Farm students will
be clamoring for more of them after
Saturday night.
