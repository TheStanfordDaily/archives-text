# Farm Assistant Found Dead; Police Investigate Suicide, Accident Causes
## Gunshot Kills Leighton Ballinger In Palo Alto Apartment; Coroner's Inquest Scheduled for Next Week 
### BOB SONTAG 
Palo Alto police were yesterday investigating the death Wednesday
night of Leighton Ballinger, Stanford assistant in Romantic languages,
who was found dead in his Webster Street apartment during the Wednes
day blackout by a graduate student friend, Deborah Cleveland.
A coroner's inquest will be held next week to determine whether

suicide or accident caused the death.
Police Inspector L. S. Lawrence [
said, however, that powder burns j
on Ballinger's clothing, the position |
of his body and other factors had
convinced investigators that the case
was one of suicide, or possibly an
accident.
Ballinger was shot through the
heart with a .22 caliber target pistol.
PISTOL IS PRADO'S
Miguel A. Prado, Stanford in
structor in Romanic languages and
a close friend of Ballinger, said that
the pistol which fired the death shot
was his.
Prado told Professor Edgar E.
Robinson, acting University presi
dent, that he and Ballinger had used
tlie pistol in target practice together.
"But I believe it was mine," he
added. He was questioned by Palo
Alto police but was not held.
NOTE FOUND
A note found in the apartment I
was written by Prado, according to
Sergeant D. D. Atwood of the Palo
Alto police department. Atwood said I
the note apparently was written
about a year ago, in "a period of I
despondency."
The note:
"If Leighton Ballinger were to I
kill me, he should he absolved of
all blame. I make this statement
in (He light of all my faculties and
after careful and sane considera
tion. It would not only be an act
of self-defense hut a justifiable
and praiseworthy thing â€” a favor
not only to me but to all con
cerned."
Mrs. Frank Weymouth, owner of
the apartment in which Ballinger
lived, related Miss Cleveland's story
on how she found the body.
GIRL FINDS BODY
Miss Cleveland had an appoint
ment with Ballinger to go skating
Wednesday night. When the city
blacked out at 9:01 p.m., Miss Cleve
land. woh lives above the garage
behind Ballinger's apartment, saw
that the light in his room was still
on.
She went to Ballinger's room,
opened the door, and saw him lying
on the floor, a telephone receiver in
one hand. She thought he had faint
ed, she said, and, turning out the
light due to the blackout, tried to
revive him by artificial respiration.
When he gave no response, she
trie dto use the telephone but Bal
linger's hand was locked over it due
to rigor mortis. She apparently
found a nearby phone and called
police.
DEAD FOR 12 HOURS
Dr. Burt Davis, clinical consultant
of the Stanford Men's Health Serv
ice, said he thought Ballinger had
been dead for at least 12 hours and
perhaps as much as 24 hours when
he examined the body shortly after
the all clear signal at 0:30 p.m.

viously studied at the Universities
of Washington, Toulouse, London,
