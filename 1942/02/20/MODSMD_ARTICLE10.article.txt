# CANAL DEFENSES TIGHTENED
## 
### 

MILITARY AUTHORITIES have announced a new tightening of the
defenses of the Panama Canal, shown 011 this map, after Axis sub
attacks on shipping in the Dutch West Indies. Because the canal saves
Allied warships a 10,000-mile trip around South America in shifting
from Atlantic to Pacific or vice versa, attacks on it are considered a
likely part of Axis war strategy.
