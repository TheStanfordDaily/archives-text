# Army Plane Uses Polo Field In Air Communication Tests

### KAY SCHWARTZ 
The horrors of war have come to the old Farm—blackouts, sugar ra
tioning, and now Army planes landing on (he campus. Yesterday an
Army plane from (he Page Mill Road artillery camp set down on the
Stanford polo field, and according to Colonel Allen, head of the R.O.T.C.
unit, it might become a regular occurrence.

The field artillery camp back of
the campus, according to Army offi
cials, is working on a series of tests
wherein an observation plane and a
ground battery communicate with
each other by code signals. These
officials added that the Stanford ad
ministration is permitting Army
planes concerned with these air
ground tests to land on the campus.
These tests were tried for the first
time yesterday by the Page Mill
Road camp, field artillery communi
cations officers.
Both the ground and air units,
Colonel Allen reported, use a radio
for their communications, but other
methods are also used. The plane
can send signals to the ground unit
by dropping a streamer with a note
attached or executing a series of
maneuvers. The field battery
spreads out white cloth panels to
signal the plane.
Stanford R.O.T.C. students will
soon get a chance to watch these
tests as the field artillery camp an
nounced it would hold further
practices.
