## 
### 
SAINT NICHOLAS, Aruba Island,
! Feb. 19 (UP).â€”A German subma
| rine today shelled this Dutch West
Indies island for the second time but
failed to damage the world's largest
oil refinery and probably was sunk
by United States bombers which
sped to the attack.
The submarine, apparently aiming
at the Standard Oil Company refin
ex*y and nearby oil tanks, fired at
least three shells beginning at 5:43
a.m. None of them found their mark.
KNOCKED OUT OF BED
The first hit the bachelor head
quarters where this correspondent
was quartered but failed to explode.
It knocked Berend Shelfhorst, com
pany employe from Almelu, Holland,
out of bed. Shelfhorst's new 50-
j guilder radio was smashed.
"I'm going to ask to have my room
I changed," Shelfhorst said ruefully
later.
The second shell hit the club
: house, scattering books and maga
; zincs. A third fell on the beach
! near United States troops.
LITTLE DAMAGE
These likewise failed to cause ap
preciable damage or casualties.
Even as the sub surfaced to de
lived its attacks, it was spotted by
; patrolling bombers. One bomber
i circled and dropped a bomb which
I the pilot believed scored a hit.
Eyewitnesses said the sub was
about three miles offshore when the
shelling began.
