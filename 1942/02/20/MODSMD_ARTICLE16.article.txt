# WAR PLACES CAMPUS BACK ON FEET
## Farm Students Own All Types of Cars Pedestrians Increase Due to Tire Famine 
### PEGGY BOOTHE 
Before the private car becomes an
item for the Stanford Museum and
the Farm's "wheeled aristocracy"
becomes as extinct as the Stanford
"rough," The Daily hastens to pre
sent some statistics on the current
car population on the campus.
The Farm boasts a variety of ve
hicles. ranging from square jobs
like Kenny Anderson's Dodge, which
looks like it went through the last
war, to streamlined streaks that
must have been among the last off
the assembly line before production
ceased at the end of January.
Figures compiled by the deans' of
flees from the registration cards 1
show that Stanford as of early 1942
is far from earless. This quarter there
are 1348 cars for 3549 students, mak
ing it theoretically possible for ev
eryone to get a ride to Paly or any
where else—theoretically.
However, the war seems to have
had some effect already on the auto
I situation, since the percentage of

cars has dropped more than the en
rollment. Last quarter, 41.8 per cent
of the students rode, not walked, to
their 8 o'clocks, while the figure
slipped to :$8.2 per cent this quarter.
The campus shoe shop has not re
ported an Increase in business as yet.

Although a higher percentage of
Row residents, 47.5 per cent, own
cars than do students living in the
halls, 25.8 per cent, more of the lat
ter will have rubber and gasoline
troubles in the future. The exact
figures give 427 cars to the hails and

403 to the Row.
Among the women's living groups,
the Kappas, Mariposa, the Gamma
Phis and Ventura top the car own
ers' list. The Japanese Club is the
only campus group without any cars
—which means they are the only
students who won't have to worry
about rubber and gas shortages cre
ated by the current altercation with
their countrymen.
MEN HAVE MOST CARS
More Stanford males had to buy
federal auto tax stamps than the
smaller part of the ratio, according
to the figures which give 1,075 cars,
or 79 per cent of those on campus, to
the men. Among the freshmen, En
cina men also lead their Roble
sisters, for 11 per cent more of them
have cars.
One encouraging feature of the
decline in cars on the campus is that
eventually no one will be able to rise
in righteous indignation at the rugged
roads it just doesn't make any dif
ference to a horse.

MEN HAVE MOST CARS
More Stanford males had to buy
federal auto tax stamps than the
smaller part of the ratio, according
to the figures which give 1,075 cars,
or 79 per cent of those on campus, to
the men. Among the freshmen, En
cina men also lead their Roble
sisters, for 11 per cent more of them
have cars.
One encouraging feature of the
decline in cars on the campus is that
eventually no one will be able to rise
in righteous indignation at the rugged
roads it just doesn't make any dif
ference to a horse.

Before the private car becomes an
item for the Stanford Museum and
the Farm's "wheeled aristocracy"
becomes as extinct as the Stanford
"rough," The Daily hastens to pre
sent some statistics on the current
car population on the campus.
The Farm boasts a variety of ve
hicles. ranging from square jobs
like Kenny Anderson's Dodge, which
looks like it went through the last
war, to streamlined streaks that
must have been among the last off
the assembly line before production
ceased at the end of January.
Figures compiled by the deans' of
flees from the registration cards 1
show that Stanford as of early 1942
is far from earless. This quarter there
are 1348 cars for 3549 students, mak
ing it theoretically possible for ev
eryone to get a ride to Paly or any
where else—theoretically.
However, the war seems to have
had some effect already on the auto
I situation, since the percentage of

cars has dropped more than the en
rollment. Last quarter, 41.8 per cent
of the students rode, not walked, to
their 8 o'clocks, while the figure
slipped to :$8.2 per cent this quarter.
The campus shoe shop has not re
ported an Increase in business as yet.

Although a higher percentage of
Row residents, 47.5 per cent, own
cars than do students living in the
halls, 25.8 per cent, more of the lat

troubles in the future. The exact
figures give 427 cars to the hails and

403 to the Row.
