# Cripps In, Beaverbrook Out as Churchill Cuts Cabinet to Seven Men
## King George VI Said to Have Induced Change 
### 
LONDON, Friday, Feb. 20 (UP).—
Prime Minister Churchill stream
lined his government today to meet
the British Empire's greatest crisis
and to satisfy his critics, at home and
in the dominions.
lie rduced the war cabinet from
nine to seven men, eliminating Lord
Beaverbrook, Minister of Produc
tion; Sir Howard Kingsley Wood,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
Arthur Greenwood, minister with
out portfolio, and adding to the new
cabinet Sir Stafford Cripps, former
ambassador to Russia, who becomes
Lord Privy Seal and leader of Com
mons.
There were reports that King
George intervened in the crisis to
induce Churchill to make the
changes. While these reports were
not confirmed, it was known that the
King received Cripps at Bucking
ham Palace Thursday, on the occa
sion of his relinquishment of the
ambassadorship, and that Cripps
stayed for lunch.
REFUSED SUPPLY JOB
It was recalled that Cripps refused
the supply minister's job three weeks
ago when Beaverbrook became pro
duction minister, on the grounds
that the job did not carry war cabi
net rank.
Churchill had resisted the changes
strongly, and yielded only when he
was threatened with being swept
out of office by the public clamor
over the loss of Singapore and the
passage of German warships through
the English channel. Even then, he
went something less than half way
from what his more radical critics
had demanded, although he is be
lieved to have satisfied most of the
opponents he mast face in the House
of Commons war debate next week.
BEAVERBROOK TO U.S.
Beaverbrook was dropped because
of his "health," and he goes to the
United States to help co-ordinate
Allied war resources.
Clement R. Attlee, Lord Privy
Seal, was shifted to the Dominions
Secretary post, replacing Viscount
Cranborne, thus making way for
Cripps who henceforth will be gov
ernment spokesman in Commons ex
cept on occasions when Churchill
appears.
There had been demands for a
j four- or five-man directorate to take
absolute control of the nation's des-
I tinies—men who would be abso-
I lutely relieved of the burden of ad
ministrative routine.
STILL DEFENSE MINISTER
Churchill kept the post of defense
minister, despite a widespread in
sistence that he cease trying to do
too many jobs. And except for drop
ping Kingsley Wood and Green
wood from the war cabinet to ordi
nary cabinet rank, his shake-up did
not affect the "Munich holdovers"
and others in his government who
have been charged with serving as
millstones around the Empire's neck.
The changes, however, arc ex
| pccted to be welcomed throughout
the Empire, where a succession of
reverses has produced the closest
approach to disillusionment and
panic seen in the 2!) losing months of
war. Commentators said any change
was bound to be for the better, and
there were indications of still more
changes to come.
