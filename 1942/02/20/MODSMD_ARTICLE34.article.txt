WASHINGTON, Feb. 1!) (UP). —American arms registered two hearten
ing victories in the Pacific war theater today, but in the beleaguered Phil
ippines the Japanese were gathering behind a curtain of artillery fire and
dive-bombers for a mighty lunge designed to crush the last American
+ Filipino resistance.

i A United States submarine operat
| ing in the East China Sea sank a
5,000-ton cargo ship, a Navy com
j munique reported while over the
' Java base of Soerabaja reinforced
] but still outnumbered American
I fighting planes dove into the midst
of 25 Japanese bombers and two
fighters, shooting down six.
Army Communique No. 115, based
on reports received from the Pacific
war theater up to 4 p.m. EWT, said
| that 16 American Army P-40 pur-
I suit planes intercepted the Japanese
! when they How over the base in four
I successive waves.
The Americans lost one plane,
whose pilot parachuted to safety, but
they downed five enemy bombers
and a fighter.
It was the largest single group of
American Army planes yet reported
in action over the Indies and was
taken as proof that American rein-
I forcements are arriving and begin
j ning to make themselves felt.
The Soerabaja base is the most im
portant left in the hands of the
j United Nations since (he fall of
Singapore.
Despite the communique's bit of
i heartening news, however, there
J was no aid for the Philippines where
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur and his
American-Filipino fighters were
j under an increasing rain of fire from
| every instrument in the Jap war kit,
] including flame throwers.
The flame throwers were men
tioned by Mac Arthur in describing a
"relatively minor" local action.
