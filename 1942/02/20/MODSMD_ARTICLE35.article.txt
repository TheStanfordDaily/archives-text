# Farm Seeks Relaxation On Vacation
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
George Washington, a former
president of the United States and
manhandler of cherry trees, will
celebrate his birthday on Sunday,
and Stanford will recover on Mon
day.
"From the foothills to the bay,"
over bill and dale, in Yosemite, Rio
Del Mar, and Santa Cruz, Stanford
looks forward to a varied program
of Washington holiday activities.
Seeking the Valley Forge spirit,
many Stanford sons of the "father of
his country" will seek the ski runs
of nearby mountain resorts, drawn
by special week-end rates and fresh
snowfalls.
The extra day allowed by Univer
sity authorities to "do right by
George" will allow many students to
visit their homes in neighboring
cities, or to get in that "big sleep"
week-end that is normally just a
mirage. Several small informal
groups have announced plans to
think about the meaning of Wash
ington's birthday with their toes
hanging in the surf of neighboring
beaches.
Tuesday the Farm will look like a
hangover from a bond rally â€” red
with sunburn, white with sand, and
blue from the "entangling foreign
alliances" that students had forgot
ten about and shouldn't have gone
home to remember.
But while it lasts, George Wash
ington- RAH !
