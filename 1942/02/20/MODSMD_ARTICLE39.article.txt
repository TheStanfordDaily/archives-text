# Stanford Hoopmen Meet U.C.L.A. Team Tonight; Indians Favored Again
## 
### 
Coach Everett Dean and 12 varsity basketball players entrained last
night for E<;s Angeles and the two remaining games <if the U.C.L.A.-
Stanfunl cage series to be played tonight and tomorrow in the Bruin game.
'I he Redskins, riding atop the southern division by a single game, will
be out to slop Ernie Handelsman, high-scoring Uelan forward who has

consistently led the Bruin attack.
Handelsman pounded home 53 points
against California in two nights. The
Bruins took one game off the Bears
on Handelsman's 29 digits in the sec
i ond encounter.
INDIANS TWO CP
Stanford swept two games from
U.C.L.A. here in their first meeting,
j In this resumption of the four-game
j series, the Indians are again fa
| vorod to make it four straight, but
■ the Bruins may have capitalized on
I the slow break system that enabled
| U.S,C. to win one off the seamen in
i their first meeting.
The freeze-the-ball tactics em
( ployed by the Trojans hampered the
Redskins' floor game throughout,
j and U.C.L.A. may try the same thing.
Dean has been waving the magic
; wand and working the mirrors over
time the last couple of days in the
i Pavilion to come up with something
to boat a slow-breaking offense—and
he may have found it.
No use talking about the new In
dian front line of defense until seen
in action tonight and tomorrow. It
| will either speak for itself or know
j the reason why.
U.S.C MEETS CAE
While Stanford meets the Bruins,
I Southern California and the Bears
| tangle in Berkeley in a two-night
stand.
Down at the Bruin camp, Han
j delsman and Co. have been working
themselves into a lather in prepara
tion for the two-game finale. But
! Ihe fact remains that as the daring
Bruin forward goes, so goes U.C.L.A.
Mickey Panovich, "Handy's" run
ning mate, guards Bob Alshuler and
Larry Gittler, and center Marv Lee
complete the Bruin regular squad.
Buy Defense Stamps and Bonds—
| a real investment.
