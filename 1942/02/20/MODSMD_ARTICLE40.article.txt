# Cards to Meet Duck Mermen
## 
### 
Facing almost certain defeat, I
Stanford's varsity swimming team i
plays host to the powerful Oregon |
mermen tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. in j
the Encina pools.
At best, Coach Nort Thornton '
figures his injury-riddled Stanford j
swimmers to lose, 45 to 29, to the |
"sophomore" Oregon team, which j
holds victories over both Oregon j
State and Washington, each by a ;
walk-away 56 to 1!) score.
Five events— the 220 and 440 free !
styles, back stroke, breast stroke,
and diving—are virtually conceded !
to the visiting Ducks, while Stan- j
ford's main chances for a win rest
in the two free style sprints and the
440-yard relay.
The Wobfoot 400-yard relay team j
tied the Pacific Coast record, set by
Stanford last year, of 3:42.2 last week j
against Washington. Yet the Card j
quartet of Rey Rule, Don Smith, j
Bill Mapel, and cither Bob Jones or |
Bob Regnolds have an even chance j
to take the visitors in this event.
Don't discuss casualties of the
Navy or Marine Corps unless offi
cially announced.
