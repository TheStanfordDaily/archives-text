# Frosh Quint Meets U.S.F. Team Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team takes over the top spot on the
home-front hoop scene tonight at 8
p.m. in the Pavilion against, a pow- 1
erful University of San Francisco
yearling quint.
Trying for their sixth victory in ;
ten starts, the local frosh face the ;
Dons as distinct underdogs, both |
on the basis of team records and I
squad conditions this week-end.
BARSOCCHINI OUT
Bob Barsocchini, speedy frosh ;
forward, is missing with a poison- j
oak attack. Ken Herrick, probable
starter in Barsocchini's spot, will aid
Fred Parsons at the forward posts, J
Jack Heald will start at center, and <
Dave Brown and Bob Hall complete i
the line-up at the guards.
Even at full strength, the Bengtson
team would have had its hands full
with a Don quint that has previously
dumped both Santa Clara's frosh
and Poly High. Two of the locals'
four losses this season were the re
sult of some intense basketball by
the latter organizations. With the |
regular five broken up, prospects |
are gloomy.
SALINAS SATURDAY
Saturday night, the freshmen will !
play host to a Salinas J. C. squad
that looks like a breather. The
Salinas outfit has lost eight out of
nine starts, a record that inspires j
little fear unless one remember's
the one-point victory that the Card |
frosh drew from heaven in a mix j
with Menlo, junior college team of a 1
similar nature.
