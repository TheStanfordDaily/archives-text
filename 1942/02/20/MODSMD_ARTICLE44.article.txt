# Card Baseball Team Tangles With Walgreen's Tomorrow
## 
### 
Walgrcen's of San Francisco will play Stanford's varsity baseball team
tomorrow at ;> p.m. on the Sunken Diamond. Yesterday's game with Gad
dini's All Stars was postponed because most of the Gaddini team is em
ployed in defense work, and could not take the time oIT to play.
Negotiations are now under way to schedule a game on Monday, Feb. 22.

Catcher Ward Walkup has shown
a new flash for hitting after being I
considered to be rather weak at the
plate. Yesterday in practice Ted
Nell was hitting the ball very hard,
and is improving at his third base
position.
Jack Parsons, letter man from last
year's team, pulled the ligaments in j
his knee while pitching during bat- j
ting practice earlier in the week, i
Parsons, playing right field, hit two
for five in the conference season for :
a .400 average. He was expected to
share the relief pitching role this ;
year, as he was an excellent high j
school pitcher, but a little too small
for college competition.
Coach Harry Wolter is still work
ing hard with his pitching staff in i
search of a starting hurler. Dale !
Snyder and Harry Dyck have both '
looked promising in the first two !
practice games.
Clark Graham and Ray Hammett,
veterans of last year's team, are
working well at shortstop and first !
base, respectively, and are easily J
leading all competition for these |
positions.
