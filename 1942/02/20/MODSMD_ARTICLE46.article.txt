J~>ICTURE how Stanford's rugby team would look after 9 of its 15 men
had been killed. Not a very happy picture and not a very good rugby
team. But that was the situation the British Cruiser Orion was faced
with.after the evacuation of Crete.
Knowing these circumstances it is easy to see why the Britishers did
not give the Cal and Stanford ruggers much competition. The men they
did have could not be in very good shape to play rugby when they were
fighting a war.
Nevrtheless, the Berkeley ruggers took great pride in piling up 25-0 and
28-0 wins over the sailors. The Orion played Stanford two weeks ago,
and the Indians under the leadership of Jim Wiley and Harry Maloney,
two gentlemen sportsmen in every sense of the word, kept the score as
low as possible in the cleanest game the English capt had ever seen.
Last week in a comparison of the Bear and Indian rugby teams in The
Daily Californian the writer placed great emphasis on the terrific beatings
Cal handed the Orion as compared to the mild showing of the Cards.
Perhaps we're a little naive here at Stanford about what we term
"sportsmanship." But it seems to me that the game itself is the important
thing, not the size of the score. And remember how the Trojans used to
pile it on in football?
