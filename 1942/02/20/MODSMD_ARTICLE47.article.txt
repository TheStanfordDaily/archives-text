## 
### 
Once again victory was snatched
away from the Stanford homing team
by its old nemesis: forfeitures. After
forfeiting three bouts to the Uni
versity of California, the Indian j
sluggers were decisioned 5-3 last ;
night in the Pavilion.
Don Grant displayed good form
| and endurance in his first heavy- !
weight light of the year, having little !
j trouble displacing Jack Thorburn, 1
jthree-year Cal veteran. Grant forced j
I the fighting throughout, using a left |
j jab to great advantage. Grant re- j
peutedly feinted his foe out of posi
| tion for hard left jabs, crossing with |
{ swil't rights to the body.
Next to the heavyweight tilt, the
| 135-pound bout gave the crowd
many anxious moments as Frank
Q. Hewitt dominated the scene over
j Ewald Larson, and easily won the
' decision. On many occasions the two j
[ scrappers stood toe to toe, letting go
1 with rights and lefts.
Ira Fishman continued his unde
| feated string of victories by easily
punching his way to a popular de
cision over Bob McEvilly, Cal vet
eran making his first start of the
year. This is the first intercolle
j giate fight that Fishman has not won
jby a t.k.o. McEvilly tried to em
| ploy a crouch stance in the second
j round, but Fishman blocked his wild
looping punches, countering with
| body blows, shooting occasional left
! jabs to the face.
Ray Greenwood, seasoned 175-
pound Cal boxer, rallied in the third
round to win a very close decision
I over Pete Gadd. Gadd appeared to
i have a slight command going into
; the third round, but tired badly.
Ewald Larson, 135 pounds, scored
| a first round t.k.o. upset over Hy
i land Hebert. Larson forced the
j fighting from the very beginning,
and sent Hebert to the canvas after
a minute of fighting, and dropped
J him again in the waning seconds of
i the round.

weight light of the year, having little !
j trouble displacing Jack Thorburn, 1
jthree-year Cal veteran. Grant forced j
I the fighting throughout, using a left |
j jab to great advantage. Grant re- j
peutedly feinted his foe out of posi
| tion for hard left jabs, crossing with |
{ swil't rights to the body.
Next to the heavyweight tilt, the
| 135-pound bout gave the crowd
many anxious moments as Frank
Q. Hewitt dominated the scene over
j Ewald Larson, and easily won the
' decision. On many occasions the two j
[ scrappers stood toe to toe, letting go
1 with rights and lefts.
Ira Fishman continued his unde
| feated string of victories by easily
punching his way to a popular de
cision over Bob McEvilly, Cal vet
eran making his first start of the
year. This is the first intercolle
j giate fight that Fishman has not won
jby a t.k.o. McEvilly tried to em
| ploy a crouch stance in the second
j round, but Fishman blocked his wild
looping punches, countering with
| body blows, shooting occasional left
! jabs to the face.
Ray Greenwood, seasoned 175-
pound Cal boxer, rallied in the third
round to win a very close decision
I over Pete Gadd. Gadd appeared to
i have a slight command going into
; the third round, but tired badly.
Ewald Larson, 135 pounds, scored
| a first round t.k.o. upset over Hy
i land Hebert. Larson forced the
j fighting from the very beginning,
and sent Hebert to the canvas after
a minute of fighting, and dropped
J him again in the waning seconds of
i the round.
Once again victory was snatched
away from the Stanford homing team
by its old nemesis: forfeitures. After
forfeiting three bouts to the Uni
versity of California, the Indian j
sluggers were decisioned 5-3 last ;
night in the Pavilion.
