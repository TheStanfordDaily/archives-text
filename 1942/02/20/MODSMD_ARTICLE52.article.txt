FOR many years Stanford University, through
its Tuesday Evening Series, and various
other groups on campus such as the Lunch
Club have been presenting speakers, panels,
discussions and other programs on international
and national affairs.
And, as it has often been noted, the Stanford
student has been conspicuous in his absence at
these programs. Whether he has considered
the world-shaking problems that are taken up
at the programs too much for his mind to cope
with, or whether he just hasn't cared, is open
to question; but he in any event managed to
stay away from them so much that he has
become famous outside the University for his
"ivory tower" attitude.
Now that his nation has been plunged into
the greatest war in history, in which his whole
existence as a free individual is threatened, we
assume that the Stanford student will begin to
realize the importance that world-wide prob
lems, which once seemed far away, have to him
as an individual. If so, it is to be expected with
some reason that the student attendance at these
programs will increase.—Vic Minahan
