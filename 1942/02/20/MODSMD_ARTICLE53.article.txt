# Pull Over to the Curb

### 
WHILE air raid officers were able to com
mend Stanford on its reaction to the black
out Wednesday night, one bad breach of black
out rules was noticeable.
For as late as ten minutes after the first blast
of the siren, cars with lights on were racing
from the Quad and the Libe parking lot to the
Halls and up the Row.
Certain students studying at the Libe decided
that they could make a rush for home and get
there before the campus was completely
blacked out. As it was, however, they were the
one serious flaw in the University's response to
the blackout order. Vic Minahan
