### AMIE REICHERT 
|>RESIDENT ROOSEVELT took a sound crack at
Washington's "Cliveden set" at his last press con
ference. The President referred apparently to certain
government officials and private individuals who—like
the well known original British group—are so blinded
by fear of Bolshevism that they cannot see the real
menace, Hitlerism.
One would think that at the very least sheer oppor
tunism would make people see that if we are to de
feat Naziism our best chance of doing it is to give Rus
sia all possible aid, for she has already proved what
she can do, and what she will yet do.
As far as one can see, the members of the Cliveden
set are determined, along with the rest of the U.S., to
lick the Nazis and soundly (for common sense and
the example of Germany must convince them that they
and their vested interests would be no better of! under
Hitler than under Stalin).
The difference between them and you and me is
that they believe that the job can be done without
Stalin's help. And they don't want his help. They are
afraid of Stalin and of Communism and of Russia's
growing international prestige. Most of all they are
afraid of allowing Russia to become the deciding factor
in this conflict so that at the peace table her hand will
be infinitely strengthened, and all over the world her
crusade for the Third International will march for
ward in glory.
Everyone who sincerely wants Russia to drive on
and on right into the heart of Hitler's Germany, every
one who is willing to see the U.S. give money, muni
tions, and men if necessary to do this job, everyone
who believes all these things and is yet not a Com
munist. knows also that the marriage of Russia to the
Anglo-American war effort was not made in Heaven,
and knows also in the bottom of his heart that Stalin
cannot completely be trusted.
That he will fight to the end is a pretty good bet;
but what terms he will demand yt the end of the
conflict no one knows.

jj .JUT that is borrowing trouble. The fight is now. and
the problem is to make the victory now. And the
Russians are the only ones who have been able to put
the world on the first lap of the road to achieving that
victory. Hitler cannot be defeated without them, and
it is about time those individuals who are still labor
ing under the delusions of a Cliveden set mentality
realized this.
The choice we have made is not between Naziism
and Communism. It is simply against Naziism. It is
for democracy.
But the Cliveden set had best also realize that it is
not for the brand of democracy they have enjoyed and
a third of the nation has suffered during the past epoch.
That age is dead. We are fighting for a democracy
that is not yet born. It will probably turn out to be
one in which the Cliveden set will not be as fat and as
powerful as it has always been. As a matter of fact, it
will probably be a democracy in which the Cliveden
set will be extinct.
