ON PROBLEMS
TPHIS is my first Bull Session. Mike is tired. Since
this is my first Bull Session I think that it is only
fitting that I should set forth one of my first problems
that I have here at Stanford. And it does not concern
women, not that I don't have that type of problem.
This is a very special sort of problem in that it
keeps presenting itself only on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.
The problem is why the first class plate was placed
where it was in front of the Chapel. For all the reason
that I can get out of the situation, it might just as well
have been planted in front of the Poli Sci door or
even the Food Research Institute. You see, there just
isn't any point as to its location on the campus.
It should be either one or four spaces to the right.
The reason I chose one or four is a very definite
reason. Plate '9(i is in the center and it seems to me
that either '92. the first class to graduate, or '95, the
first class to complete four years of Stanford, should
have the honor of being in the center.
The Quad is divided very symmetrically, right down
the middle, and if you stand on the '96 plate you can
look down the middle of the Quad, down the middle
of Palm Drive, and even see the flag pole in Palo
Alto. Very symmetrical.
You see there is just no reason why some outsider
like '96, which is just a very ordinary class like '35
or '19, but nothing special like '92 or '96 or even '41,
should slip in and get the good spot. It's unfair.
* * *
| SET about finding out the reason for this great in
justice. I examined the plate closely, and for all my
troubles I had some little man ask me if I had lost
something, and when I tried to explain the situation to
him, he hurried off. never even bothering to say
good-bye.
I then went to Miss Alice Hays, the only person on
the campus who would know about such important
things since President Wilbur is in the East.
Miss Alice Hays, who last year resigned as head of
the Library and now in an unofficial way knows all
sorts of facts about Stanford, was suggested to me as
the solution to my problem.
She was.
It seems that the Class of '96 thought up the idea.
To be more exact, a certain Robert W. Campbell
thought up the idea, and the plate got into the choice
spot on the Quad before either the deserving classes
of '92 or '96 could accumulate their brass and lead
and other things necessary to the laying of a class
plate.
Even though they didn't get this center spot they
did the best they could and stuck their plate in when
they could get enough of themselves together. By that
time it. was too late to rip out the plate and assert
their rights.
Well, any'wav, it won't bother me anymore.

isn't any point as to its location on the campus.
It should be either one or four spaces to the right.
The reason I chose one or four is a very definite
reason. Plate '9(i is in the center and it seems to me
that either '92. the first class to graduate, or '95, the
first class to complete four years of Stanford, should
have the honor of being in the center.
The Quad is divided very symmetrically, right down
the middle, and if you stand on the '96 plate you can
look down the middle of the Quad, down the middle
of Palm Drive, and even see the flag pole in Palo
Alto. Very symmetrical.
You see there is just no reason why some outsider
like '96, which is just a very ordinary class like '35
or '19, but nothing special like '92 or '96 or even '41,
should slip in and get the good spot. It's unfair.
* * *
| SET about finding out the reason for this great in
justice. I examined the plate closely, and for all my
troubles I had some little man ask me if I had lost
something, and when I tried to explain the situation to
him, he hurried off. never even bothering to say
good-bye.
I then went to Miss Alice Hays, the only person on
the campus who would know about such important
things since President Wilbur is in the East.
Miss Alice Hays, who last year resigned as head of
the Library and now in an unofficial way knows all
sorts of facts about Stanford, was suggested to me as
the solution to my problem.
She was.
It seems that the Class of '96 thought up the idea.
To be more exact, a certain Robert W. Campbell
thought up the idea, and the plate got into the choice
spot on the Quad before either the deserving classes
of '92 or '96 could accumulate their brass and lead
and other things necessary to the laying of a class
plate.
Even though they didn't get this center spot they
did the best they could and stuck their plate in when
they could get enough of themselves together. By that
time it. was too late to rip out the plate and assert
their rights.
Well, any'wav, it won't bother me anymore.

ON PROBLEMS
TPHIS is my first Bull Session. Mike is tired. Since
this is my first Bull Session I think that it is only
fitting that I should set forth one of my first problems
that I have here at Stanford. And it does not concern
women, not that I don't have that type of problem.
This is a very special sort of problem in that it
keeps presenting itself only on Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.
The problem is why the first class plate was placed
where it was in front of the Chapel. For all the reason
that I can get out of the situation, it might just as well
have been planted in front of the Poli Sci door or
even the Food Research Institute. You see, there just
isn't any point as to its location on the campus.
It should be either one or four spaces to the right.
