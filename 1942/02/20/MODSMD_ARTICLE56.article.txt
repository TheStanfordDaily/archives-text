»» 4 LL jump up and never come down
Swing your honey around and around"
And "Promenade, boys, promenade!"
To the schottische swing
Swing your date at a Western square?
If you can't bring a partner you'll find one there.
If you think you can't dance, just try it and sec;
The caller is good; the party is free.
If you can't find the time—it's just eight to ten;
Two hours of dancing come on, men,
And gals, too; come one and all.
Swing your honey around the hall.
The Women's Gym; thi> Saturday night.
A Schottisclu' Swing: let's do it up l ight.
