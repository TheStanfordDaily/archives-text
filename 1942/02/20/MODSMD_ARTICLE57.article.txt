# 'You Belong to Me' Proves Good, Swift-Moving Comedy
## 
### 
"YOU BELONG TO ME," now
playing at the Stanford-Fox in Palo
Alto.
'"You Belong to Me" gets oft to a
fast start with Henry Fonda yodel
ing downhill on skis, and under the
expert direction of Wesley Ruggles,
the picture does little dragging
thenceforth.
Barbara Stanwyck is Dr. Helen
Hunt, and it is therefore inevitable
that bang-up comedy should follow
her meeting with and marriage to I
the naive millionaire who chaffs at 1
the bit and peeks in keyholes when
the lady doctor is treating a male pa- [

ticnt.
With this general scheme, the
show skips merrily through the do
mestic strife of the woman who per
sists in being a doctor, and the hus
band who scares her patients away.
The number 2 picture is somewhat
slower, but there is a good shot of
Havana from the air.â€”Covey
