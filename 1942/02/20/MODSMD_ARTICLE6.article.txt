# Schottische To Be Held Tomorrow
## Two Hours of Polkas And Squares Feature Folk Dance in Gym 
### 
Tomorrow night Farm students
won't be going to a Senior Prom or
a Sadie Hawkins Dance, but they
will be heading for the Women's
Gym about 8 p.m. for two hours of
good old fun at the first Schottische
Swing, sponsored by W.A.A. and
A.S.S.U.
These two hours of polkas, squares,
cowboy dances, and schottische will
be the first get-together of this kind
on campus. Dodo Paul man and
June Murphy, co-chairmen of the
hospitality committee, will be wait
ing with the rest of the co-ed re
ception committee to welcome party
goers. A group of Palo Alto Com
munity Center schottischers are
coming to join Stanfordites in swing
ing their partners.
The dance is informal with all
kinds of music being supplied by
the juke box. The hospitality com
mittee wants to stress the fact that
no one has to know how to do
squares, polkas, or any other kind of
dancing to have fun at this shindig.
"All the gang's going to be there,
and it promises to be more fun
than we've had at an on-campus af
fair for quite some time," said a
couple of would-be schottischers.
