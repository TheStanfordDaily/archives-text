# Police Indicate Possibility Of Murder in Ballinger Case
## Officers Suspicious of Time Lapse Between Death and Phone Disorder 
### 
The death of Leighton Ballinger, Stanford assistant in Romanic lan
guages. is still a "wide-open case" today as the District Attorney's ollice is
investigating three possible causes—murder, accident, or suicide.
Previously, Deputy Coroner Harry Ryder had anonunccd that only
suicide or accident causes would be investigated, but he later decided

also to investigate for murder be
cause of "some suspicious elements"
in Ballinger's death.
Ryder said he was not entirely
satisfied that Bellinger died in an
accident or as a suicide.
'"It looks mighty funny that the
telephone should be held backwards
in Ballinger's hand, and that the
first report of Ballinger's phone be
ing out of order did not come until
9:45 a.m. Wednesday, nine or ten
hours after he is supposed to have
died," Ryder said.
D A. ASSISTS
Ryder asked the aid of the Dis
trict Attorney's office and has been
consulting with Allan P. Lindsay,
chief deputy district attorney, and
Robert Drexel, investigator for the
prosecutor's office.
Bal linger was found shot through
the heart in his home at 635 Web
ster street in Palo Alto during the
Wednesday night blackout. Deborah
Cleveland, a neighbor, noticed Bal
linger's light burning during the
blackout, and found the body when
she entered his room to extinguish
the light.
Under the body was a .22 caliber
target pistol, and Ballinger's left
hand clutched a telephone receiver.
PIIONE MYSTERY
The District Attorney's office is in
vestigating the time lapse betwen
midnight Tuesday, when Ballinger
is supposed to have died, and 9:45
a.m. Wednesday when telephone
company officials say they received
their first report that Ballinger's
telephone was out of order.
Telephone company officials said
that a service interruption would
have been noticed within an hour of
the time it started.
PRADO NOTE
Deputy Coroner Ryder said that
he was convinced the note written
by Miguel Prado, Stanford instructor
in Romanic languages, had no bear
ing on the case. Prado admitted
ownership of the pistol found under
Ballinger's body, but said both he
and Ballinger had used it for target
shooting and that Ballinger had
borrowed it to carry while on duty
as an auxiliary policeman.
Ryder announced that a coro
ner's inquest to determine the cause
of Ballinger's death will be held Fri
day at 2 p.m. at Roller and Hap
good, funeral directors, in Palo Alto.
Roy L. Ballinger, the dead man's
father and assistant collector of cus

good, funeral directors, in Palo Alto.
Roy L. Ballinger, the dead man's
father and assistant collector of cus
toms in Seattle, has arrived in Palo
Alto to aid in the inquiry.
The death of Leighton Ballinger, Stanford assistant in Romanic lan
guages. is still a "wide-open case" today as the District Attorney's ollice is
investigating three possible causes—murder, accident, or suicide.
Previously, Deputy Coroner Harry Ryder had anonunccd that only
suicide or accident causes would be investigated, but he later decided

also to investigate for murder be
cause of "some suspicious elements"
in Ballinger's death.
Ryder said he was not entirely
satisfied that Bellinger died in an
accident or as a suicide.
'"It looks mighty funny that the
telephone should be held backwards
in Ballinger's hand, and that the
first report of Ballinger's phone be
ing out of order did not come until
9:45 a.m. Wednesday, nine or ten
hours after he is supposed to have
died," Ryder said.
D A. ASSISTS
Ryder asked the aid of the Dis
trict Attorney's office and has been
consulting with Allan P. Lindsay,
chief deputy district attorney, and
Robert Drexel, investigator for the
prosecutor's office.
Bal linger was found shot through
the heart in his home at 635 Web
ster street in Palo Alto during the
Wednesday night blackout. Deborah
Cleveland, a neighbor, noticed Bal
linger's light burning during the
blackout, and found the body when
she entered his room to extinguish
the light.
Under the body was a .22 caliber
target pistol, and Ballinger's left
hand clutched a telephone receiver.
PIIONE MYSTERY
The District Attorney's office is in
vestigating the time lapse betwen
midnight Tuesday, when Ballinger
is supposed to have died, and 9:45
a.m. Wednesday when telephone
company officials say they received
their first report that Ballinger's
telephone was out of order.
Telephone company officials said
that a service interruption would
have been noticed within an hour of
the time it started.
PRADO NOTE
Deputy Coroner Ryder said that
he was convinced the note written
by Miguel Prado, Stanford instructor
in Romanic languages, had no bear
ing on the case. Prado admitted
ownership of the pistol found under
Ballinger's body, but said both he
and Ballinger had used it for target
shooting and that Ballinger had
borrowed it to carry while on duty
as an auxiliary policeman.
