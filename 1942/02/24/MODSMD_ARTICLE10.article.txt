## 
### 
Stanford University will be broad
casting radio programs from its own
studio by March 1, if present plans
are completed on schedule.
"KQW has promised to use our
facilities as soon as the studio is
completed,'' said Bud Cady, direc
tor of the Stanford Radio Workshop
staff. "There will be two programs
a week: on Wednesday evenings like
the "Wealth of the West" show
which was just completed, and on
Saturday afternoons strictly dra
matic workshop plays written by
students."
The aim of the radio workshop
movement is eventually to link the
University with a nationwide net
work similar to the Chicago Uni
versity Round Table discussion.

"At Stanford we have authorities
on all subjects," commented Dr.
Hubert Heffner, head of the Divi
sion of Speech and Drama and ex
ecutive director of the Radio Work
shop staff. "There is no reason why
they shouldn't broadcast from Stan
ford instead of having to go to San
Francisco.
"Two phases of radio work
should be considered: (1) the re
search; and (2) the producing angles.
Under Dr. Fred Terman we have
the outstanding college radio engi
neer group in the country. Tor
man's book on the subject is called
'the radio engineer's bible.'
TOP PRODUCING UNIT
"We also have one of the best
producing units in the country.
Why should NBC do the work
when we can handle the job as well,
if not better? Television is another
angle, but we haven't fooled with it
yet."
Dr. Heffner explained that the ob
ject of the workshop and studio
movement is to give students who
have the ability on opportunity to
try out and to give them experience
before going outside of the school to
get. a job.
RADIO SHOULD EDUCATE
"Most of the radio talent comes
out of the colleges," said Dr. HefT
ner. "Chicago and Northwestern
started back in 1932 and practically
every top university now has some
sort of radio work.
"Radio can be made a magnifi
cent instrument," he continued.
"Besides entertaining, radio should
educate. That is where the univer
sities play their part."

TOP PRODUCING UNIT
"We also have one of the best
producing units in the country.
Why should NBC do the work
when we can handle the job as well,
if not better? Television is another
angle, but we haven't fooled with it
yet."
Dr. Heffner explained that the ob
ject of the workshop and studio
movement is to give students who
have the ability on opportunity to
try out and to give them experience
before going outside of the school to
get. a job.
RADIO SHOULD EDUCATE
"Most of the radio talent comes
out of the colleges," said Dr. HefT
ner. "Chicago and Northwestern
started back in 1932 and practically
every top university now has some
sort of radio work.
"Radio can be made a magnifi
cent instrument," he continued.
"Besides entertaining, radio should
educate. That is where the univer
sities play their part."
Stanford University will be broad
casting radio programs from its own
studio by March 1, if present plans
are completed on schedule.
"KQW has promised to use our
facilities as soon as the studio is
completed,'' said Bud Cady, direc
tor of the Stanford Radio Workshop
staff. "There will be two programs
a week: on Wednesday evenings like
the "Wealth of the West" show
which was just completed, and on
Saturday afternoons strictly dra
matic workshop plays written by
students."
The aim of the radio workshop
movement is eventually to link the
University with a nationwide net
work similar to the Chicago Uni
versity Round Table discussion.
STANFORD EXPERTS
"At Stanford we have authorities
on all subjects," commented Dr.
Hubert Heffner, head of the Divi
sion of Speech and Drama and ex
ecutive director of the Radio Work
shop staff. "There is no reason why
they shouldn't broadcast from Stan
ford instead of having to go to San
Francisco.
"Two phases of radio work
should be considered: (1) the re
search; and (2) the producing angles.
Under Dr. Fred Terman we have
the outstanding college radio engi
neer group in the country. Tor
man's book on the subject is called
'the radio engineer's bible.'
