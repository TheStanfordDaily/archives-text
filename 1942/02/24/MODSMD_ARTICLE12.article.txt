# Unpatriotic Thief Robs Savings Bank
## 
### 
Eight dollars in dimes he was sav
ing to buy defense stamps were stol
en from Larry Nieder, 133 Branner,
last week. Nieder had the dimes in
a glass savings bank. Nothing else
was taken from the room.
The prowler who has baffled cam
pus police for two quarters was al
most cornered last Thursday night
when he tried to enter the Beta
house. As he was pushing a curtain
aside before entering the house
through a window, an early-rising
Beta saw him and yelled. The po
lice were summoned and the area
was canvassed, but the prowler
could not be located.
Norm Hodgkin, 960 Matadero Ave.,
Palo Alto, had a spare tire stolen
from his car Sunday night. The car
was parked by the dumps in back of
the R.O.T.C. headquarters. Hodkin
left it for about 10 minutes, and
when he returned the tire was miss
ing. This was the second case of
stolen tires reported to Police Chief
Gordon Davis this quarter.
Eleven fraternities, one sorority,
and Encina and Branner have been
entered to date this quarter. Spe
cial campus police have been work
ing overtime in an effort to catch the
prowler at work.
