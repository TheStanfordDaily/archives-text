# Allies Awaiting Attack on Java
## 
### 
BATAVIA, Tucs., Feb. 24 (UP).— j
The Japanese appear to be consoli- J
dating their positions on the islands
of Bali. Sumatra and Timor, compe
tent Dutch officials said today, but
they added that Netherlands. British
and American planes and warships
arc ready to attack any new Nip
ponese invasion fleet "the moment it
shows."
Scouting planes have failed to
find any trace of the invasion fleet
blasted apart by planes and war
ships of the United Nations of Bali
last week-end, it was said, and it
may be taken for granted that not
more than one of these vessels es
caped the Allied attacks.
Included among the vessels 'sunk
or damaged were a battleship and an
aircraft carrier and 14 transport !
ships, involving heavy loss of troops
and equipment.
The Japanese accomplished their
main mission on Bali, nevertheless,
by seizing the Denpasar airdrome
and other strategic points on the
island flanking eastern Java. In
view of their losses, however, their
victory was a "pyrrhic" one.
