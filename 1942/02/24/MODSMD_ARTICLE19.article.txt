## 
### 
SANTA BARBARA, Feb. 23 (UP). —An enemy subma
rine, presumably Japanese, shelled a coastal area eight miles
north of Santa Barbara tonight in the first hostile attack
against the United States mainland of World War 11.
Thore was no material damage, no fires, nor any casualties
resulting from the shelling.
Santa Barbara police estimated the submarine fired about
25 shells in the direction of an oil refinery near Goleta, a
California coastal town, but there was no report of damage.
The submarine surfaced about half a mile offshore in the
twilight at 7:18 p.m., PWT, eyewitnesses reported, and
blasted away several minutes with its deck gun.
One of the shells landed in a canyon, another on a beach.
Whether by coincidence or not, the shelling was in the
general location of the Bankline oil refineries and oil derricks.
Morris Wheeler, restaurant operator who lives one mile
north of Goleta, gave the United Press this eye-witness ac
count :
"I heard 12 explosions. I ran outside and I could see the
submarine. It was twilight, and I could see gunflashes. One
shell whizzed over my head and landed in a canyon a mile
inshore.
"One landed on a beach half a mile from where I was
standing, and threw up geysers of dirt, just like in the news
reels.
"Mrs. Wheeler was scared to death."
Santa Barbara and nearby communities were blacked out.
Radio stations in Southern California went off the air and a
"yellow" alert was sounded.
Mrs. Wheeler, wife of the restaurant owner, added this

eye-witness account:
"I saw the explosions. At fir.st they
were very faint. At first I thought
it was the army practicing, but then
I heard a shell flying overhead and
strike in a canyon inshore from our
place."
The Wheelers' restaurant is throe
fourths of a mile from the ocean
front, .squarely in the center of five
large oil fields.
One shell landed about a quarter
of a mile from the Wheeler place,
witnesses said. The concussion shook
the restaurant building.
All highway traffic was halted on
Highway 101, the main coastal thor
oughfare between San Francisco and
Los Angeles.
John Staniss, an oil field worker,
said he saw the fir.st gun flash and
looked at his watch. It was 7:18
p.m.
"I could see the submarine from
the shore, and it looked so big to me
I thought it was a cruiser.
"It lay on the surface and fired 12
shots."
(Both Wheeler's and Staniss' ac
count conflicted with the police ver
sion of the number of shells fired.
They agreed on 12. The police said
"about 25.")
Staniss said the submarine lay
"about a mile offshore."
"It shelled for about 20 minutes
and when it stopped it did not sub
merge, but stayed on the surface
until it got so dark I couldn't see it.
"Boy, I guess those Japs mean
business."

Mrs. Wheeler, wife of the restaurant owner, added this

eye-witness account:
"I saw the explosions. At fir.st they
were very faint. At first I thought
it was the army practicing, but then
I heard a shell flying overhead and
strike in a canyon inshore from our
place."
The Wheelers' restaurant is throe
fourths of a mile from the ocean
front, .squarely in the center of five
large oil fields.
One shell landed about a quarter
of a mile from the Wheeler place,
witnesses said. The concussion shook
the restaurant building.
All highway traffic was halted on
Highway 101, the main coastal thor
oughfare between San Francisco and
Los Angeles.
John Staniss, an oil field worker,
said he saw the fir.st gun flash and
looked at his watch. It was 7:18
p.m.
"I could see the submarine from
the shore, and it looked so big to me
I thought it was a cruiser.
"It lay on the surface and fired 12
shots."
(Both Wheeler's and Staniss' ac
count conflicted with the police ver
sion of the number of shells fired.
They agreed on 12. The police said
"about 25.")
Staniss said the submarine lay
"about a mile offshore."
"It shelled for about 20 minutes
and when it stopped it did not sub
merge, but stayed on the surface
until it got so dark I couldn't see it.

business."
SANTA BARBARA, Feb. 23 (UP). —An enemy subma
rine, presumably Japanese, shelled a coastal area eight miles
north of Santa Barbara tonight in the first hostile attack
against the United States mainland of World War 11.
Thore was no material damage, no fires, nor any casualties
resulting from the shelling.
Santa Barbara police estimated the submarine fired about
25 shells in the direction of an oil refinery near Goleta, a
California coastal town, but there was no report of damage.
The submarine surfaced about half a mile offshore in the
twilight at 7:18 p.m., PWT, eyewitnesses reported, and
blasted away several minutes with its deck gun.
One of the shells landed in a canyon, another on a beach.
Whether by coincidence or not, the shelling was in the
general location of the Bankline oil refineries and oil derricks.
Morris Wheeler, restaurant operator who lives one mile
north of Goleta, gave the United Press this eye-witness ac
count :
"I heard 12 explosions. I ran outside and I could see the
submarine. It was twilight, and I could see gunflashes. One
shell whizzed over my head and landed in a canyon a mile
inshore.
"One landed on a beach half a mile from where I was
standing, and threw up geysers of dirt, just like in the news
reels.
"Mrs. Wheeler was scared to death."
Santa Barbara and nearby communities were blacked out.
Radio stations in Southern California went off the air and a
"yellow" alert was sounded.
