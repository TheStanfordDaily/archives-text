# Chinese Easy Says Dr. Chan
## 
### 
Chinese, often spoken of as "the
world's most difficult language," can 1
be grasped fairly well in half a |
year.
That, at least, is the firm opinion '
of Dr. Shau Wing Chan, assistant i
professor of Oriental languages here
on the Farm. J j
"A lifetime to learn Chinese? j |
Nonsense!" says Dr. Chan. "If a i
student is willing to study conscien- j
tiously two or three hours a day, he
should he able to acquire a working j
knowledge of modern Chinese in six j
months."
:{,ooo-woKn vocabulary
Willi a vocabulary of 2,000 to 3,000
words which could be learned during
this time, he predicts the average
wsterner would have little difficulty
in making his way in China, while a
4.000-word vocabulary, according to
Dr. Chan, would be ample for prac
tically all purposes.
Dr. Chan is conducting courses in
the Mandarin dialect at Stanford and
is stressing modern, rather than
classical Chinese. He is also the
author of "A Chinese Reader for Be
ginners."
TO TEACH IN SUMMER
This year Dr. Chan will instruct
the first summer quarter class in
Chinese ever to be offered at Stan
ford. The new course will be a j
short and intensive study of the ;
language, designed primarily for j
those who may be able to attend j
only one quarter. Students will
learn about 1000 characters or
words.
"This course," says Dr. Chan, who
formerly taught English in China,
"will qualify students for govern
ment training courses preparatory to i
entering government service." The j
Stanford professor also points out
that a knowledge of Chinese offers an
excellent background lor the study
of Japanese.
