### Student Opinion Surveys of America 
AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 23.—Ameri
-1 can college students, a great portion
of whom will eventually enter the
armed forces, are divided on the is
sue of prohibiting the sale of liquor
' near army camps.
! If the problem were left to the
! college men alone, a Student Opinion
j Surveys of America poll shows, the
| largest number of them -nearly half
I would vote to have drinks, but a
I majority of the co-eds would dry up
| army areas.
Adding the votes from both sexes
; as cast in the nationwide poll, the
wets and the drys are within one
| percentage point of each other, too
close, statistically to decide which
! side would win.
"Do you think the sale of liquor
j should be prohibited around army
| camps?" interviewers in every sec
! lion of the United States asked,
j These were the results:

Pet. Unde-
Dry Wet cided
All students 48 47 5
Men only 4G 49 5
Women only 52 44 4
Of the 48 per cent who want to
make it difficutl for soldiers to get
liquor, the larger part would con- |
sent to the sale of beer alone. The
"drys" were asked, "Do you think j
the sale of beer alone should be ;d- j
lowed around army camps?"
Allow beer, said 24%
Do riot allow Leer, said 21% j
