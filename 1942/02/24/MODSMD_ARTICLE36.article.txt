# Frosh Cagers Dump Salinas, San Francisco
## 
### 
Hitting on all five of its frosh cyl-
I inders in a surge of scoring power
i that shot over the 50-point mark on
I two successive nights, the Stanford
i yearling hoop machine wrote the
j first chapter in a comeback cam-
I paign on the skulls of Salinas J.C.
{ and San Francisco University over
the week-end.
Not only were the two wins, 55-43
| from the Dons and 51-46 from Sa
! linas, proof of the punch that the
Cards can generate if they are all
"on" together, but they also were
successes that pull the Card hopes
for their final games against the Cal
frosh on March 6, 7 up to something
that closely resembles equality.
Only twice during the previous
tilts had the Papeese been able to get
out of the 30-point class, and both
of these brought only an even 40
points against the two weakest op
ponents on the schedule, Monterey
and San Jose.
BROWN HITS 18 POINTS
In the Friday clash, the Stanfords
cooked the Don goose in a ball
hawking and shooting campaign led
by Dave Brown's 18-point contri
bution, eight-point play by Parsons
and seven points for Heald, and good
all-around play by the other two
starters, Herrick and Hall. Against
Salinas, Parsons and Heald with 13
points and Brown with 12 again
made up for a season's somewhat
lost time in offensive play. Both
games were the first tilts in which
more than one starter had hit. above
the 10-point mark in a particular
evening.
The absence of Bob Barsocchini
from the lineup both nights would
advance the theory that Bengtson
has developed reserve material that
is capable of fitting in, and he may
be able to get even more points out
of his club against Cal, now that the
"off the dime" talk is reality.
