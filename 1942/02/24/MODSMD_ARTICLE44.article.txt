## No News Is Good News 
### 
WE are most happy to state no reports of
automobile accidents involving Stanford
students traveling home or to the snow over
the week-end have been received by The Daily.
Careful driving has done its part in preventing
further tragedy on the campus, and in keeping
the box at the top of this column empty.
