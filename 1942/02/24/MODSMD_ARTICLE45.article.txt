# Stanford on the Air
## 
### 
LAST Wednesday night Stanford's Radio
Workshop gave a show in Memorial Hall to
raise funds for and create interest in Stanford's
radio studio which will be completed about
March 1.
Although the program was a financial failure,
it did serve to show the few students and Palo
Altans who attended that we have excellent
personnel and material with which to put out
truly professional programs from a local studio.
Frank "Bud" Cady, "Skip" Athey, Dr. Hubert
Heffner, and Mrs. Inez Richardson are the work
horses behind this move. For several years they
have been contacting broadcasting companies,
studios, and experts on the idea that Stanford
should have a studio of its own.
Cady and Athey went ahead and designed
a studio which is almost completed; KQW has
promised Stanford at least two programs a
week; Dr. Heffner has been working on plans
to organize nation-wide broadcasts. In other
words, the dream is practically a reality.
The possibilities are limitless with such a set
up. Stanford with its top authorities in every
field could carry on programs egual to the cali
ber of the University of Chicago Round Table
discussion.
It won't be long before radio listeners through
out the country will hear "Stanford University
on the Air."—John Horrall
