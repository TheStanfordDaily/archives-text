# Chiang Returns
## 
### 
OUT of last week's news, and developments
forecast by that news, comes the realiza
tion that the United States has in its ally Chiang
Kai-shek not only an able general but quite a
diplomat.
Chiang last week took the lead in the com
plicated diplomacy of the United Nations. His
visit to India was more than a colorful meeting
with Gandhi, for the Generalissimo conferred
with Nehru, head of the Hindu Nationalist Con
gress, and with Jinnah, the Moslem minority
leader. These meetings have certainly had
something to do with the renewal of talk of a
deal between Britain and India on self-govern
ment and an all-out war effort.
The Chinese leader is right in the middle of
everything, and in addition to fighting a war
in China he has his eye on both flanks. He now
sees a great aid to the effort of the United Na
tions in two moves and he openly advocates
immediate steps in both directions.
First, he thinks the British would be wise to
offer India a larger measure of self-government
in exchange for an all-out war effort. Certainly,
if the Hindus and Moslems got together, In
dians, 350,000,000 of them, would be quite an
influence on the Burma situation. Chiang is
thinking of his vital Burma Road here. Then the
Chinese leader wants Russia, which has strong
forces in eastern Siberia, to attack the Japanese
puppet state Manchukuo. If both these angles
developed the Japanese would face a really
solid wall of opposition.â€”Hap Everett
