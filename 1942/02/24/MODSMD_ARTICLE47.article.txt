TWO weeks ago Stanford held its winter
quarter elections to fill positions for the rest
of the academic year and, in some instances, for
a full year's term.
Following that election, during which Ex
Committee itself saw the difficulties involved
in an overcrowded preferential ballot, and the
inaccuracies and faults of the present Election
Board, the necessity of Ex Committee action was
pointed out.
Last week Ex Committee s agenda was so
crowded it was impossible to undertake further
discussion or possible action in connection with
the administration of the election system as it
exists. It is to be presumed that tonight Ex
Committee will reach some decision ior the
students they represent, before interest in the
situation and facts concerning the unfortunate
mistakes grow cold.
