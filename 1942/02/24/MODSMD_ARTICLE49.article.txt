### MIKE CHURCHILL 
LETTER TO MIKE
MIKE: By that lowly title I still address you
even though you have bccome personal enough
in your column recently to be called Lieutenant Com
mander Churchill.
I wonder if Stanford is still the isolated institution
that it was nine months ago. I kinda hope it is be
cause the more you read and know about National
Defense, taxes, and these wars we are waging, the
heavier the school tasks become, the more you worry.
Worry and study don't mix well, do they Michael?
For the benefit of no one, here are a few uninter
esting sidelights that I have come upon in my travels
from Lockheed to home, from home to Lockheed, from
Lockheed, etc.
Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, Hollywood ambassa
dors of croon and mirth respectively, participated in an
exhibition golf match with two well-known Texas pros
recently. The show was put on in San Antonio for
the benefit of the Red Cross and actually filled that
worthy organization with 12.000 slices of lettuce. To
account for that much money there had to be a tre
mendous gallery. Well, the two pros thrive on the
clumsy antics of a fanatical golf crowd so they were
not bothered at all. Crosby, being a showman as well
as an expert linksman himself, was perfectly at home.
But then there was Hope. Armed with a fiendish sense
of humor and a wicked slice, lovable Bob proceeded to
mow down and practically annihilate the terrified and
helpless gallery. After nine holes of blood and gore,
he had disposed of and actually slaughtered 88 on
lookers although only taking half as many strokes.
Bob's shots were accurate but not straight; that's the
only way I can explain it. On the 11th hole our grue
some hero reached a climax. His tee shot buried in an
unfortunate galleryite's abdomen, and, of course, ac
cording to rule, he had to play the ball as it lay.
Calmly taking his blaster, Hope took a stance on the
prostrate man's face and swung viciously at the buried
ball. Out it came among other things and Bob fin
ished the hole in five bloody strokes. The man died of
an exploded appendix, and Hope was arrested for
operating without a degree.
It was believed that this was the first time Red
Cross contributors ever really saw their funds put to
use. Ambulances followed the golfers, and doctors and
nurses worked frantically on Hope's patients as they
fell.
Spbaking of Crosby and Hope, "the road to Singa
pore" must be pretty well cluttered up by now, eh
Mike? I probably shouldn't say this but when I saw
a picture in the paper of the Britisher who surren
dered Singapore to the Japanese, I realized why so
many women and children had been bombed by the
invaders. From all appearances, the women and chil
dren must have been sent out to do a hell of a lot of
fighting before Major General Percival was allowed to
enlist.
I can almost understand that Singapore setback but
that Dover debacle stops me cold, Michael. Just when
the song was number one on the hit parade and every
one was so sure there would be Bluebirds over those
White Cliffs, a black cloud of Messerschmitts swarmed
by a few miles from Dover itself and escorted the
diminishing German fleet to safety. That was sure a
horrible puncture in the already descending balloon of
British morale. Better they should sing the number
two hit, "Blues in the Night."
Well. I'll sec you when the spring fever blooms,
Mike, unless the F. 8.1, pays you a visit before then.
They've got rid of most of the undesirable aliens
down here.

in your column recently to be called Lieutenant Com
mander Churchill.
I wonder if Stanford is still the isolated institution
that it was nine months ago. I kinda hope it is be
cause the more you read and know about National
Defense, taxes, and these wars we are waging, the
heavier the school tasks become, the more you worry.
Worry and study don't mix well, do they Michael?
For the benefit of no one, here are a few uninter
esting sidelights that I have come upon in my travels
from Lockheed to home, from home to Lockheed, from
Lockheed, etc.
Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, Hollywood ambassa
dors of croon and mirth respectively, participated in an
exhibition golf match with two well-known Texas pros
recently. The show was put on in San Antonio for
the benefit of the Red Cross and actually filled that
worthy organization with 12.000 slices of lettuce. To
account for that much money there had to be a tre
mendous gallery. Well, the two pros thrive on the
clumsy antics of a fanatical golf crowd so they were
not bothered at all. Crosby, being a showman as well
as an expert linksman himself, was perfectly at home.
But then there was Hope. Armed with a fiendish sense
of humor and a wicked slice, lovable Bob proceeded to
mow down and practically annihilate the terrified and
helpless gallery. After nine holes of blood and gore,
he had disposed of and actually slaughtered 88 on
lookers although only taking half as many strokes.
Bob's shots were accurate but not straight; that's the
only way I can explain it. On the 11th hole our grue
some hero reached a climax. His tee shot buried in an
unfortunate galleryite's abdomen, and, of course, ac
cording to rule, he had to play the ball as it lay.
Calmly taking his blaster, Hope took a stance on the
prostrate man's face and swung viciously at the buried
ball. Out it came among other things and Bob fin
ished the hole in five bloody strokes. The man died of
an exploded appendix, and Hope was arrested for
operating without a degree.
It was believed that this was the first time Red
Cross contributors ever really saw their funds put to
use. Ambulances followed the golfers, and doctors and
nurses worked frantically on Hope's patients as they
fell.
Spbaking of Crosby and Hope, "the road to Singa
pore" must be pretty well cluttered up by now, eh
Mike? I probably shouldn't say this but when I saw
a picture in the paper of the Britisher who surren
dered Singapore to the Japanese, I realized why so
many women and children had been bombed by the
invaders. From all appearances, the women and chil
dren must have been sent out to do a hell of a lot of
fighting before Major General Percival was allowed to
enlist.
I can almost understand that Singapore setback but
that Dover debacle stops me cold, Michael. Just when
the song was number one on the hit parade and every
one was so sure there would be Bluebirds over those
White Cliffs, a black cloud of Messerschmitts swarmed
by a few miles from Dover itself and escorted the
diminishing German fleet to safety. That was sure a
horrible puncture in the already descending balloon of
British morale. Better they should sing the number
two hit, "Blues in the Night."
Well. I'll sec you when the spring fever blooms,
Mike, unless the F. 8.1, pays you a visit before then.
They've got rid of most of the undesirable aliens
down here.
