# CAMPUS OPINION
## UNION NOW! 
### 
HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
The recent exchange of opinion over the wartime
curtailment of off-campus activities brings up again
the point that the University lacks facilities for the
full extent of social activities in which students en
gage at any institution of our enrollment.
Stanford lacks an adequate Student Union.
Dances held in the women's gym put an expense,
in depreciation, on the athletic department. The Pa
vilion is not designed for proms either. A large hall
would be included in the Union, to take care of large
events like reunion banquets which are now held of!
campus.
At present all the activity groups arc housed in
shacks and spare rooms all over the campus. Their
consolidation on a floor, or in a section, of the Union
would both offer them suitable quarters and a chance
for more frequent interassociation.
In place of the moribund hole justly called The
Cellar, a hall with twice the booths and twice the floor
space might lead to a regular schedule of biweekly tea
dances (without cover charge) featuring a student
maestro. The Nitery was based on a good idea that
failed. (Why?)
The basement could harbor intramurals in winter,
particularly the smaller indoor sports. Why don't the
lectures, concerts, and films draw more than a few
people, mostly townsfolk or music majors? It seems
there would t>e a good turn-out at informal recorded
concerts offered seven afternoons a week by a corps
of volunteer record-changers. A superior reproducing
instrument might also attract season followers of the
Saturday operas and Sunday Philharmonic.
A real lack the Union could fill would be that of a
Browsing Library with latest best sellers available.
This building should be near the Quad for conve
nient use. A quarter million would be a conservative
estimate on the cost.
If student agitation reveals a real sense of need in
this direction, the new building could be financed.
Stanford will more certainly guarantee that it.s stu
dents will develop into more rounded persons if it af
fords them an adequate Student Union,
