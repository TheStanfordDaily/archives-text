# Errol Flynn Rides Again In Army Din
## 
### 
"THEY DIED WITII THEIR
BOOTS ON," now playing at the
Fox-Stanford in I'alo Alto.
Errol Flynn swashbuckles again in
"They Died with Their Boots On."
And Olivia de Haviland takes the
same role she has taken from "Cap
tain BlooS" to "The Santa Fe Trail"
(which is not necessarily bad).
For Flynn's Civil War cavalry
charges, they apparently insert his
old scenes from "The Charge of the
Light Brigade." And Custer's last
stand is a faithful reproduction of
the beer hall mural. All of which
makes a ripsnorting West Pointed
western. And there are good charac
terizations of Scott, Grant, and
Sheridan.
The scenarists, however, forget to
refer to their history books as the
long picture progresses. For exam
ple, they call Sitting Bull, Crazy
Horse, make the actual discovery of
gold in the Black Hills a political
ruse, and portray Indian fighter
Custer as an innocent saint.
But you'll like it.—Covey
