# Women Practice On Switchboard
## 
### 
"Lagunita ... To Suzy? Suzy who,
please? Thank you. . . . One mo
ment, please . . ." If this moment
is a long one, don't despair and think
you have 3121. You're probably
talking to one of a group of 25
Lagunita women who are learning
to operate the telephone switch
board. After a six-week practice
period, ending next week, the tender
watchfulness of the regular opera
tor may be omitted.
The purpose of this training is to
"serve residence switchboards," La
gunita and Roble, in an emergency,
and to train girls to help in their
home communities," said Miss Cran
dall, Lagunita director. "This serv
ice is one thing a woman can do
as a vital part in defense," stated
Mrs. Betty Hurd, desk assistant.
"She can replace needed men at
police and fire departments, and at
first aid stations during a blackout
or an air raid." Mrs. Hurd lists as
important features of a good switch
board operator, "spoed and accu
racy, a clear, low-pitched voice and
good co-ordination."
Another class will be offered later,
to care for the many girls who vol
unteered for this service.
