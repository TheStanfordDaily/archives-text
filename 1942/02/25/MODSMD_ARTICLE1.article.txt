# Need for Campus Opinion To Enforce Blackouts Cited by Frank Walker
## Failure to Observe Driving Rules Hit by Financial Vice President; Disorderly Conduct Is Condemned 
### 
An opportunity for campus opinion to voluntarily enforce no-driving
regulations during blackouts, before enforcement becomes necessary, was
presented to the campus yesterday by Frank F. Walker, member of the
Executive Committee of the Civilian Defense Council, and University
financial vice-president. 4———^—

The statement was released fol
lowing the committee's review of
last week's blackout, during which
many students drove cars from the
main library to houses up the Row.
"Some cars had lights burning,
others were driven with lights off,
endangering lives of students who
were walking home," said Mr.
Walker.
CAN'T ALLOW VIOLATIONS
"This is one violation we just
can't countenance," he continued.
"The committee prefers to again
point out. the danger and let public
opinion enforce the rule, rather than
asking the police to take action."
Mr. Walker also condemned the
disorderly conduct of several stu
dents during the blackout, pointing
out that "shouting and yelling"
would confuse the situation in the
event a person were injured and
called for help during an air raid.
'LET CAMPUS ENFORCE RULE'
"I can't believe there would be
anyone quite as heedless of his own
life and the lives of his associates; so
to me there is only one thing to do—
let the campus enforce this rule
itself."
Mr. Walker will attend alumni
conferences in the Northwest this
week-end, and will entrain for
Portland tomorrow night, continue
to Seattle for another meeting, and
fly home from Seattle Monday.
