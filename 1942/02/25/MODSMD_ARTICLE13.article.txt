# Jap Sub Hits Oil Property Of Farm Girl
## 
### 
One person at Stanford felt the
| impact of those shells thrown by a
| Japanese sub Monday evening.
Deborah Spalding, a junior jour
j nalism major from Goleta, has the
| honor of being the daughter of the
| owner of the first California prop
erty to be fired upon in this war. Mr.
Spalding owns some of the oil wells
at Golcta.
"I called my dad and mother, who
were in Los Angeles at the time, and
they declared that. 75 people had
called them telling of the shelling.
They hadn't even heard about it un
til the calls came in to them from
Goleta."
"Gosh," Deborah went on, "I guess
that makes me connected with the
first attack on California since 1842,
1949, or 1879, or whenever it was!"
