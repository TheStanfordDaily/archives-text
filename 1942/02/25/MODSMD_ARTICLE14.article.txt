### 
Dean John Bunn spoke to some
200 Encinamen last night in the En
cina lobby. He urged that every
student plan to attend school during
the summer; if not at Stanford, else
where, and transfer credits next fall.
He explained a new program de
signed lo make the halls more liv
able, and commended the freshmen
for their high scholarship record:
.112 Encinamen, he said, had made a
B average or better, and 15 had made
straight A's. He suggested that if
there were food complaints, a com
mittee be appointed lo make recom
mendations to the head of the din
ing hall.
