# SEE YOU IN CACTUS GARDENS
## Campus Haunt Pays Off in Prom Bids 
### 
Tonight is the night to get ac
quainted with your Cactus Gardens!
Though the Senior Prom Commit- !
tec regrets it cannot comply with the
many requests for "Cactus Garden |
dates" with lovely vocalist Nadia j
Coury, pictured at right, the com- i
mittee did say last night that two
free bids had already been sealed j
into two of the large stack of en- .
velopes to be distributed tonight to J
every car parked in the Cactus Gar- I
dens between 9:45 and 10:15.
Co-chairmen Johnny Shores and j
Jane Ellen Marks last night urged
everyone to leave the Libe early to j
be sure to be at the famed Stanford j
beauty spot in time to get one of the I
little white envelopes.
Advocating a large crowd who
will want to take advantage of this
golden opportunity, Police Chief
Gordy Davis warned all students to
"stay on the roads," since parts of j
the Cactus Gardens not paved or J
improved may be muddy.
Larry Cannon, whose band will
furnish the music for the Class of
'42's "Cactus Gardens'' Prom this
Friday night, told the committee he
would have plenty of music appro
priate for the subdued lights and
romantic setting of the transformed
Pavilion.
"I am sure all Stanfordites will like
our vocalist, too." lie said, speaking
of sultry-voiced Nadia Coury.


NADIA COURY will sing with Larry Cannon's orchestra at the Senior
Prom Friday night.
