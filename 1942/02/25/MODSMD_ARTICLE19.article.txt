SANTA BARBARA, Feb. 21 (UP). —The Army and Navy searched by
air and sea today for an oversized Axis submarine that shelled the Bank
line oil refinery 12 miles west of Santa Barbara last night in what President
Roosevelt termed an excellent example of political warfare.
Airplanes and surface craft equipped with sound detectors ranged over

tho California coastal waters in a
drive to seek out and eliminate the
big submersible—probably Japanese
—which blasted 25 five-inch shells at
point-blank range at oil wells and
refineries.
The California coast line was on
the alert for a possible reappearance
of the raider.
Japanese imperial headquarters
said a Japanese submarine during
the night of Feb. 23 bombarded
"military establishments" along the
coast of California and added "Tho
raid proved to be a great military
success."
(Actually, damage was trifling.
The War Department called it
"slight")
The submarine caused only flight
damage in the 25-minutc, leisurely
attack, the War Department an
nounced in a communique. It was
the first hostile assault on continen
tal United States since World War I
when a U-boat lobbed shells at a
Cape Cod objective with trifling re
sults in 1918.
There was speculation that th'*
submarine crew deliberately timed
the attack in the middle of Presi
dent Roosevelt's radio report to the
nation. Today, at his press confer
ence, the President said he thought
the shelling might react in the oppo
site*direction from the original in
tent of the raider.
Mr. Roosevelt said he did not know
what had happened to the submarine
after the attack and as far as he
knew the submarine probably vol
untarily submerged during the day
light hours.
