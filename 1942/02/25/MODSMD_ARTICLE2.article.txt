# War in Brief
## 
### 
While Americans yesterday were
getting used to the fact that an
enemy submarine had dared to at
tack continental United States, the
Japs drove on in the Far East's two
main theaters—Burma and Java.
Bulletins from the war fronts:
BATAVIA—U.S. bombers today
searched for any remnants of the
Jap invasion fleet which was de
stroyed yesterday, as Dutch and
American defending forces pre
pared for another enemy invasion
attempt. The defeat of the invasion
fleet left .'5,000 enemy soldiers iso
lated on the island of Bali, it was
noted.
CHUNGKING — The Chinese
have admitted that the Japs have
captured the rail junction of Pegu,
key railhead of the "feeder" line
to the Burma Road. The import
ance of this was minimized, how
ever, since the Burma Road was
rendered useless to the Allies last
week when Rangoon Harbor was
mined.
WASHINGTON — A continued
lull in the battle of the Philip
pines was reported yesterday by
the War Department, which noted,
however, that Japanese planes
again have showered incendiary
bombs behind Gen. Douglas Mac-
Arthur's lines in Bataan.
LONDON—Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill, in a report to the
House of Commons, announced
that shipping losses have shot up
alarmingly in the first two months
of 1042.
LONDON—German Ambassador
to Turkey Franz von Papcn and
bis wife narrowly escaped death
when a bomb exploded near them
on an Ankara Street yesterday,
according to the Swiss radio.
