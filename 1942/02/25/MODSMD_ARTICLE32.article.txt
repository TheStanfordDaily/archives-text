# Educator Sees Imminent Need For Leadership
## Campus Activities Bring Responsibility, Says Dr. C. F. Stone 
### 
"Stanford students should enter
into campus activities wholeheart
edly in order to develop a sense of
responsibility so that they will be
ready to assume leadership in their
country when the need arises," Dr.
C. P. Stone of the psychology depart
ment stated yesterday.
"It is as important to remain in
school, educating yourself and de
veloping this responsibility, as it i.s
to leave college to work in defense
industries or to enlist in the Army
or Navy," Dr. Stone emphasized.
"The Army needs educated young
men who can lead others and men
who are specialists, such as engi
neers and doctors.
HEALTHY MEN NEEDED
"But the services want healthy
men. Every student should go out
for a sport, either intercollegiate or
intramural. Intramural sports offer
every student an opportunity to im
prove his body through healthful
exercise."
Dr. Stone urged that all campus
activities, no matter how insignifi
cant, he continued. The manage
ment of Lagunita teas, the running
of a fraternity's intramural program,
are as important for developing re
sponsibility as holding the office of
A.S.S.U. president, he stated.
BASED ON ARTICLE
Dr. Stone's opinions were voiced
concerning an article prepared by
Prof. W. V. Bingham, of tbe Adj-
Office in Washington, which stressed
the need for educated men in the
army, the need for leadership, and
the need for occupational speciali
zation.
The need for education is obvious,
Bingham pointed out, when the
complicated and technical warfare of
today is considered. Both officers and
privates have a great deal to learn
from printed manuals and instruc
tions. The ability to comprehend
written orders clearly when operat
ing under fire needs no emphasizing.
TOO FEW LEADERS
The Army needs a vast number
of proficient leaders in all ranks
from general to corporal, Bingham
said. The proportion of potential
leaders needed is about 250 per
thousand, one in four.
"The Army has a great need for
young men with demonstrated ca
pacity for leadership," he says.

"It is as important to remain in
school, educating yourself and de
veloping this responsibility, as it i.s
to leave college to work in defense
industries or to enlist in the Army
or Navy," Dr. Stone emphasized.
"The Army needs educated young
men who can lead others and men
who are specialists, such as engi
neers and doctors.
HEALTHY MEN NEEDED
"But the services want healthy
men. Every student should go out
for a sport, either intercollegiate or
intramural. Intramural sports offer
every student an opportunity to im
prove his body through healthful
exercise."
Dr. Stone urged that all campus
activities, no matter how insignifi
cant, he continued. The manage
ment of Lagunita teas, the running
of a fraternity's intramural program,
are as important for developing re
sponsibility as holding the office of
A.S.S.U. president, he stated.
BASED ON ARTICLE
Dr. Stone's opinions were voiced
concerning an article prepared by
Prof. W. V. Bingham, of tbe Adj-
Office in Washington, which stressed
the need for educated men in the
army, the need for leadership, and
the need for occupational speciali
zation.
The need for education is obvious,
Bingham pointed out, when the
complicated and technical warfare of
today is considered. Both officers and
privates have a great deal to learn
from printed manuals and instruc
tions. The ability to comprehend
written orders clearly when operat
ing under fire needs no emphasizing.
TOO FEW LEADERS
The Army needs a vast number
of proficient leaders in all ranks
from general to corporal, Bingham
said. The proportion of potential
leaders needed is about 250 per
thousand, one in four.
"The Army has a great need for
young men with demonstrated ca
pacity for leadership," he says.
"Stanford students should enter
into campus activities wholeheart
edly in order to develop a sense of
responsibility so that they will be
ready to assume leadership in their
country when the need arises," Dr.
C. P. Stone of the psychology depart
ment stated yesterday.
