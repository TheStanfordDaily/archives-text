over the showing the Redskins made

Graham, Scott, Nell and Ilammett
are now working as a smooth infield
combination. Ilammett has saved
many throws from becoming errors
by picking them out of the dirt or
reaching for high throws. Graham
and Scott looked good in one of the
earlier games, completing three quick
double plays to pull a game out of
the fire. Nell has shown a strong
arm in his fast, accurate throws from
third base.
Ilammett is now fully recovered
from an ailing charley-horse that
was slowing him down considerably,
especially in the Athens Club game,
when he was caught at the plate in
an attempt to score from second.

regarded industrial team, Richmond
