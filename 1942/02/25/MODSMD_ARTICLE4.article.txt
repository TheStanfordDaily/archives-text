# Ex Committee Lauds Lagunita Defense Drive
## 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Campus organizations will vie for
leadership in the Stanford Defense
Bond Drive which was authorized
by Excom last night to replace sug
gested separate war relief drives
for each allied nation.
This came after Excom learned
that an apparent wave of student
co-operation in the war effort has
sprung up recently, high-lighted by
Lagunita's Defense Bond Drive of
last night and Saturday night's
schottische.
In support of this plan Dick Dris
coll said, "A year ago we were help
ing the Finns, but look at them
now."
The week-old question of the de
bate trip was brought up again when
several budget discrepancies were
believed discovered. Student Man
ager Jim McKellar was asked to
consult with the debate manager
before final trip plans are completed.
FEDERATION DELEGATES
Virginia Dean, Stan Owen, Ralph
Schaffarzick, and Harry Morgan
were appointed Stanford's repre
sentatives to the National Student
Federation of America conference
to be held at Mills Collge next week
end.
Tiff Denton reported two sugges
tions to improve the present system
of counting election ballots: (1) di
vide the campus into more precincts
and count each precinct's ballots
separately; (2) mark the votes on
tally sheets instead of on black
boards.
Next Tuesday night Excom will
meet with other student groups at
Dr. Wilbur's home to discuss prob
lems confronting the University in
the present emergency.
