# Burness, a Real Veteran, Steadies the Cardinals

### HAP EVERETT 
Tlu- boys call him "Ma."
And if (here was over a guy who holds his hrood together like a mother,
it's Don Durness, (J-loot-.'! captain of Everett Dean's 1942 quintet.
To all who know him, Don is the ultimate in "the good guy" and is
held in high regard by his teammates, especially the younger players in
their first year as Stanford regulars, namely Howie Dallmar and Jim
Pollard.
With brilliant material, enough for one string anyway, Coach Dean
needed this year a veteran to sm( oth out the play of his team and to
hold the boys down, especially in the matters of freezing a lead, or
steadying down the play after a flurry of enemy baskets. Burness has
served this purpose perfectly.
Don is a real veteran. He was busy on tSanford's basketball court
four years ago. In the fall of 1!).'!!) he was the only returning letterman
to turn out; hut it was soon realized that "Ma" would not be available
after all. His knee was in terrible shape and would not hold up for
any length of time.
Then last year, Don came back after recovering from his operation,
took over the center spot, and guided Stanford to a lower division crown.
Don was given all-star honors and at only one time in the season did
he seem to be really up against a superior. This happened up north when
the All-American giant, Paul Lindeman, took control of the backboard
and things in general.
Don has had some lough luck on his shots in recent home games; but
local fans can certainly vouch for his tremendous defense work and
ball handling. lie's among the leaders in the southern division point
making department.
Burness will never have Luisetti's name, but it will be a long time be
fore Stanford forgets "Ma," the polished court veteran.
