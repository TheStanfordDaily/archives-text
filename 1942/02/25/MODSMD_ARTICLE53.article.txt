# "The Big Red War Machine"

(Editor's note: The following editorial is
reprinted from Monday's Palo Alto Times as
indicative of student war-time thinking and
action, and demonstrating the reaction of our
elders to our efforts.)
RAY LYMAN WILBUR told American
-L-' school administrators at a convention in
San Francisco Saturday that the young people
are far ahead of their elders in their realization
of the fact that the country is at war. That isn't
saying a great deal, perhaps, but it answers a
question which a, good many alumni and
neighbors of Stanford University have been
asking of late, a question given particular point
last week by the Family Fund campaign of the
students. Their appeal for "fuel for the Stanford
war machine" was weighted with information
about significant research work, defense train
ing courses, streamlined curriculum and other
evidences that the University is girded for war.
"There is little room for doubt that, from the
standpoint of administration and facilities, Stan
ford is a war plant. But what of the students?
Are we being asked to provide fuel for a ma
chine manned by irresponsible undergraduates
whose major problems are those of fraternity
politics, who squander rubber tires on trips to
"the Mark" for dancing, who grouse about a
shortage of sugar at the Cellar, who are per
sistently collegiate on the edge of catastrophe?
"Dr. Wilbur's statement is reassuring. Even
more so is the attitude of the students them
selves who, under the carefree exuberance of
youth, are "pointed" toward war goals. They
have speeded up the tempo of their academic
life, working harder and longer hours to pre
pare themselves for the all-out effort into which
they will plunge. Their activities are civilian
defense, USO, an information service, Red
Cross; hundreds of them are clamoring for first
aid instruction, delayed by lack of teachers.
They have voluntarily simplified their social
life, eliminated name bands, started the custom
of dancing to canned music in the halls and
houses, developed a spirit of neighborhood hos
pitality that has caught on and proved good fun.
"In grave recognition of the change that must
come in ther lives, 40 or more student leaders
sat down together soon after the war broke out
and discussed a self-imposed discipline for
speeding academic work, maintaining health in
the face of the tension, and safeguarding them
selves against new dangers. Succeeding weeks
have seen these put into effect by the various
living groups with a willingness and efficiency
that put the adult citizens of other communities
to shame.
"They are being urged to stay out of uniform
and to complete their training because in this
war the laboratories and administrative offices
are the front line trenches. Financial support
of a university that is making this intensified
training possible for a student body eager to
acquire it is a major contribution to victory, for
it is through research and leadership that the
war must be won."
