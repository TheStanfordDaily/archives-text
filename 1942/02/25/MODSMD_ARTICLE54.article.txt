THERE is one point, however, in contradiction
to the above editorial, where some students
are not co-operating with civilian defense efforts.
It is pointed out this morning on the front page,
as it was in this column last week, that students
are reguired not to use their cars during black
outs. It is to be expected they will co-operate
in the future and, if the pressure of public opin
ion fails, that they will be punished severely by 1
the authorities.
