### AMIE REICHERT 
A BOUT 17,000 Pacific Coast workmen handed Herr
Hitler and his toothy sidekick, Tojo, a big laugh
day before yesterday in honor of George Washing
ton s birthday. The laugh was a pretty expensive one,
and it on the President of this nation and the
American people as a whole.
But, who knows, maybe those 17,000 patriotic work
men who refused to punch the clock on Monday be
cause it was national holiday think it was worth it.
Laughs are so scarce these days.
Maybe some 60,000 to 100,000 man hours of work on
war contracts (which translated would mean one
third of a flying fortress or 1,000 hours of ,50-caliber
machine gun fire or one dozen anti-tank guns) maybe
that price isn't too much to pay, just so long as some
one yets a kick out of it.
What a peculiar mentality so many Americans have.
Just what does it take to make them realize that war
isn't fish and chips and time and a half and three
lumps with each cup and luxury as usi«il. Because it
is luxury. Everything that we indulge in these days
which isn't contributing to the national war effort is a
luxury. At least theoretically. Not until that theory be
comes practice will we begin to win this war.

'J'HE thing that made the laugh so extraordinarily
side-splitting for the Axis was that the holiday
shut-down on the Coast preceded by only a few hours
these words from the President:
"From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo we have been de
scribed as a nation of weaklins—'playboys'—who would
hire British soldiers, or Russian soldiers, or Chinese
soldiers to do our fighting for us.
"Let them repeat that now! Let them tell that to
General Mac-Arthur and his men. Let them tell that
to the sailors who today are hitting hard in the far
waters of the Pacific. Let them tell that to the boys
in the flying fortresses. Let them tell that to the
marines!"
Well, Monday it became apparent that you can tell
it to Pacific Coast labor all right and they won't have
a squeak-back coming. Maybe the Axis is right. May
be we are soft—not physically but morally. We swag
ger with the bravado that the heroics of Mac Arthur
and his men instill in us through some vicarious mys
tic relationship and we feel plenty tough, but appar
ently on the home front we haven't the moral fiber, the
guts to take it and take it the hard way.

SHUN the realities, close our eyes to the possi
bility of defeat, forget Pearl Harbor except as an
inspiration for Tin Pan Alley production, and secure,
smug, confident in a victory which Mac Arthur's men
and others like them will surely win for us whether
they have the guns and planes to do the job or not.
We are determined that we needn't sacrifice or do
without. In other words it's more of the "business as
usual" and the "maginot line" attitude which killed
France and trampled the pride of Singapore in the
dust.
We need to be shocked. The shelling off Santa Bar
bara unfortunately won't do it, because no damage
was done. Must we wait to be permanently and fatally
shocked by several hundred Jap dive bombers over
San Francisco?

San Francisco?
A BOUT 17,000 Pacific Coast workmen handed Herr
Hitler and his toothy sidekick, Tojo, a big laugh
day before yesterday in honor of George Washing
ton s birthday. The laugh was a pretty expensive one,
and it on the President of this nation and the
American people as a whole.
But, who knows, maybe those 17,000 patriotic work
men who refused to punch the clock on Monday be
cause it was national holiday think it was worth it.
Laughs are so scarce these days.
Maybe some 60,000 to 100,000 man hours of work on
war contracts (which translated would mean one
third of a flying fortress or 1,000 hours of ,50-caliber
machine gun fire or one dozen anti-tank guns) maybe
that price isn't too much to pay, just so long as some
one yets a kick out of it.
What a peculiar mentality so many Americans have.
Just what does it take to make them realize that war
isn't fish and chips and time and a half and three
lumps with each cup and luxury as usi«il. Because it
is luxury. Everything that we indulge in these days
which isn't contributing to the national war effort is a
luxury. At least theoretically. Not until that theory be
comes practice will we begin to win this war.

'J'HE thing that made the laugh so extraordinarily
side-splitting for the Axis was that the holiday
shut-down on the Coast preceded by only a few hours
these words from the President:
"From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo we have been de
scribed as a nation of weaklins—'playboys'—who would
hire British soldiers, or Russian soldiers, or Chinese
soldiers to do our fighting for us.
"Let them repeat that now! Let them tell that to
General Mac-Arthur and his men. Let them tell that
to the sailors who today are hitting hard in the far
waters of the Pacific. Let them tell that to the boys
in the flying fortresses. Let them tell that to the
marines!"
Well, Monday it became apparent that you can tell
it to Pacific Coast labor all right and they won't have
a squeak-back coming. Maybe the Axis is right. May
be we are soft—not physically but morally. We swag
ger with the bravado that the heroics of Mac Arthur
and his men instill in us through some vicarious mys
tic relationship and we feel plenty tough, but appar
ently on the home front we haven't the moral fiber, the
guts to take it and take it the hard way.

SHUN the realities, close our eyes to the possi
bility of defeat, forget Pearl Harbor except as an
inspiration for Tin Pan Alley production, and secure,
smug, confident in a victory which Mac Arthur's men
and others like them will surely win for us whether
they have the guns and planes to do the job or not.
We are determined that we needn't sacrifice or do
without. In other words it's more of the "business as
usual" and the "maginot line" attitude which killed
France and trampled the pride of Singapore in the
dust.
