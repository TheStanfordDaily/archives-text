### MIKE CHURCHILL 
I CAN see the headline now. Right across the Topeka
*- "Bird": "STANFORD DANCES AS JAPS STORM
COLLEGE GATES. Tea Dance as usual in splendid
new Union although shells fall on Quad." Yea Singa
pore.
Yesterday's Campus Opinion contained a plaintive
plea for a new Student Union. "A quarter million
would be a conservative estimate of the cost."
"A real lack the Union could fill would be a Brows
ing Library with latest best sellers available." This is
simply imperative. To hell with anything factual these
days, let's all have a good browse and forget the war.
Nothing can happen to us. Quit your kidding, Santa
Barbara, you're just a pack of alarmists.
Run along, Red Cross, and tend your chickens.
We at Stanford are going to form a "corps of volun
teer record-changers." Of course we need it, for our
"informal recorded concerts seven afternoons a week."
With this suggested Union "Stanford will more cer
tainly guarantee that its students will develop into
more rounded individuals." Here I have to concur. Let's
all have over-stuffed chairs where we can sit all day
and drink chocolate malts. It's not our fault that
there is no Student Union on Bataan where Mac A
rthur's men might do the same.
I'm sorry, madam, that I must take exception to
your letter published yesterday. I really can't recon
cile spending a quarter of a million for a recreation
center at Stanford with the present precarious world
conditions. In fact, madam, if you will pardon me, I
think you're nuts.

r SENIOR ball committee has come forth with a
colossal publicity gag. This evening all couples
parked in the cactus gardens between 9:45 and 10:15
will have an envelope put on their windshield. In two
of these will be free bids to the Senior Ball.
Officer Davis, when asked if parking would be per
mitted in the Cactus Gardens, agreed to allow it, say
ing: "It's a good idea. I think we're inclined to be a
little too tense these days."
