students are supposed to have common
k sense. This is hard to believe when they express
ideas such as we heard yesterday.
There were people on the campus yesterday that
believed the United States Navy deliberately shelled
our own coast to put us in a more fighting mood.
First of all, our Navy is fighting an offensive war—
they haven't got time to worry about whether Cali
fornia is frightened or not. The fact that people think
our interest in this war so slight that our own navy
has to stimulate interest in such a manner indicates
a pretty sad condition of campus opinion.
Then, the argument that no American patrol planes
appeared immediately does not hold up; for if the
navy had been so interested in scaring Californians, the
command would have had the brains to make the pic
ture complete with planes staging a fake defense. The
fact that planes didn't appear means the attack was a
complete surprise rather than an American plot.
On top of all this, the deliberate statements heard
yesterday were in opposition to the attitude requested
by President Roosevelt when he asked that the people
trust their own high command. What could be better
for the Japs than to have every one of their attacks
interpreted as attacks bf the U.S. Navy'on its own
coastline?
As a matter of fact, the attack was a clever psycho
logical move on the part of the Japs, which resulted in
moving the story of Roosevelt's speech to the number
two news position on Coast front pages.
