## 
### AL HAMPSON 
The same factors that explain the success ol china against her enemy
explain Russia's success against Germany, and will explain our common
lot, according to Dr. llu Shih. ambassador from China and speaker at last
night's Tuesday Evening Series.
Dr. Hu went on to say to a capacity crowd that China's ability to fight

depends on five factors: space,
bers, historical unity, capacity for
hard work, external international
aid, and on her patience.
In tegard to "space" Dr. Hu went
on to say that in the 5G months that
the fight has gone on with Japan,
China has lost only 10 per cent of
her territory. "Europe has been
conquered," he said, "because they all
lack space."
NEVER TRAPPED
He went on to discuss China's
numbers and mentioned that al
though China has suffered reverses,
she has never been trapped because
of her huge numerical superiority.
In regard to his country's national
unity Dr. Hu said, "China's national
unity is at least 21 centuries old and
was not brought about solely by the
Japanese invasion." He continued
that in this long period of time there
have been only short periods of time
when China has been dominated by
a foreign power. The arguments, Dr.
Hu said, which have occurred in 1
China are rarely more serious than
those of "the great Republican and
the great Democratic parties in this
country."
UNITY IMPORTANT
This same sense of historic and
continental unity has played an im
portant part in Russia's battle against
Germany, Dr. Hu stated.
The capacity for hard work is the !
fourth factor important in China's
successful fight, the speaker said.
Dr. Hu mentioned as examples the
building of the 2,000-mile road to
Russia and the 700-mile Burma
Road,' and the moving of 400 fac
tories inland which "were carried on
human backs and human shoulders." i
"We have been able to fight on
because we have received aid from j
all our friends abroad," Hu Shih |
said in respect to his fifth point. He
then went on to say that the most
effective of all methods "short of
war" was the economic blockade
used against the enemy.
PATIENCE ESSENTIA I.
Besides these five factors, Dr. Hu- i
mentioned that China had one more
quality which was essential for vic
tory—patience. "China's patience I
and unaltering faith in a just cause
has been important in her ability to j
carry on."
He concluded by saying, "Let us j
therefore not be too impatient. Let
us learn from our old friend and
new ally this message of patience."

us learn from our old friend and
new ally this message of patience."
The same factors that explain the success ol china against her enemy
explain Russia's success against Germany, and will explain our common
lot, according to Dr. llu Shih. ambassador from China and speaker at last
night's Tuesday Evening Series.
Dr. Hu went on to say to a capacity crowd that China's ability to fight

depends on five factors: space,
bers, historical unity, capacity for
hard work, external international
aid, and on her patience.
In tegard to "space" Dr. Hu went
on to say that in the 5G months that
the fight has gone on with Japan,
China has lost only 10 per cent of
her territory. "Europe has been
conquered," he said, "because they all
lack space."
NEVER TRAPPED
He went on to discuss China's
numbers and mentioned that al
though China has suffered reverses,
she has never been trapped because
of her huge numerical superiority.
In regard to his country's national
unity Dr. Hu said, "China's national
unity is at least 21 centuries old and
was not brought about solely by the
Japanese invasion." He continued
that in this long period of time there
have been only short periods of time
when China has been dominated by
a foreign power. The arguments, Dr.
Hu said, which have occurred in 1
China are rarely more serious than
those of "the great Republican and
the great Democratic parties in this
country."
UNITY IMPORTANT
This same sense of historic and
continental unity has played an im
portant part in Russia's battle against
Germany, Dr. Hu stated.
The capacity for hard work is the !
fourth factor important in China's
successful fight, the speaker said.
Dr. Hu mentioned as examples the
building of the 2,000-mile road to
Russia and the 700-mile Burma
Road,' and the moving of 400 fac
tories inland which "were carried on
human backs and human shoulders." i
"We have been able to fight on
because we have received aid from j
all our friends abroad," Hu Shih |
said in respect to his fifth point. He
then went on to say that the most
effective of all methods "short of
war" was the economic blockade
used against the enemy.
PATIENCE ESSENTIA I.
Besides these five factors, Dr. Hu- i
mentioned that China had one more
quality which was essential for vic
tory—patience. "China's patience I
and unaltering faith in a just cause
has been important in her ability to j
carry on."
He concluded by saying, "Let us j
therefore not be too impatient. Let
us learn from our old friend and
new ally this message of patience."
