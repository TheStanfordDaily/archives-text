# Lagunita Casas Maintain Lead in Defense Bond Drive of Campus Groups
## Eucalypto Contributes First Bond To University in Chancellor Wilbur's Name; Ex Committee Endorses Act 
### 
Ileaded by Casa Eucalypto, Lagunita Court still maintains its lead in
the Stanford Defense Bond Drive, which started Tuesday night. Euca
lypto purchased its bond yesterday, registered it in the name of Ray Ly
man Wilbur, and presented it to Chancellor Wilbur for the University.
(Sec letter at right.) ±

The drive, which still requires
formal Administration approval, was
authorized at Tuesday night's Excom
meeting. In acting, Excom took cog
nizance of a popular movement,
originating in Lagunita.
Among the other Lagunita casas,
Casa Ventura will open its contribu
tion box Monday, and is confident,
according to Bee Standish, Ventura
president, that they will have the
requisite $18.75. Casa Granada's
voluntary contributions are coming
along so well, stated Bee May, Gra
nada president, that other fund
raising will be unnecessary.
Casa Olivo and Casa Magnolia ex
pect to have their respective quotas
met by tonight, but if not, the two
will combine to sponsor an ice cream
sale to raise the necessary funds.
FROSII HALLS RESPOND
Roble Hall has made some plans,
but no definite action has been
taken yet. To quote Irma Cunha,
Roble president, however, "Wait till
Roble gets going. Oh boy!" Encina
Hall will "probably" also participate
in the drive.
Inquiries among the sororities
produced only the information that
most of Stanford's Row women
favored the drive and that they
would get under way at the next
house meeting.
MEN MAKE PLANS
Fraternities generally had come to
no formal decisions on the drive, but
individual members "liked the
idea. Branner and Toyon sources
said that their Hall Councils will
meet soon to discuss ways and
means of participating.
The lowest denomination De
fense Bonds sell for $18.75, and at
maturity are worth $25. They can
be purchased at the Palo Alto post
office or at any bank. If the living
group wishes to present the bond to
the University, it should be regis
tered in the name of a University
officer. The campus post office does
not sell bonds, but carries all de
nominations of Defense Stamps.

Roble president, however, "Wait till
Roble gets going. Oh boy!" Encina
Hall will "probably" also participate
in the drive.
Inquiries among the sororities
produced only the information that
most of Stanford's Row women
favored the drive and that they
would get under way at the next
house meeting.
MEN MAKE PLANS
Fraternities generally had come to
no formal decisions on the drive, but
individual members "liked the
idea. Branner and Toyon sources
said that their Hall Councils will
meet soon to discuss ways and
means of participating.
The lowest denomination De
fense Bonds sell for $18.75, and at
maturity are worth $25. They can
be purchased at the Palo Alto post
office or at any bank. If the living
group wishes to present the bond to
the University, it should be regis
tered in the name of a University
officer. The campus post office does
not sell bonds, but carries all de
nominations of Defense Stamps.
Ileaded by Casa Eucalypto, Lagunita Court still maintains its lead in
the Stanford Defense Bond Drive, which started Tuesday night. Euca
lypto purchased its bond yesterday, registered it in the name of Ray Ly
man Wilbur, and presented it to Chancellor Wilbur for the University.

The drive, which still requires
formal Administration approval, was
authorized at Tuesday night's Excom
meeting. In acting, Excom took cog
nizance of a popular movement,
originating in Lagunita.
Among the other Lagunita casas,
Casa Ventura will open its contribu
tion box Monday, and is confident,
according to Bee Standish, Ventura
president, that they will have the

voluntary contributions are coming
along so well, stated Bee May, Gra
nada president, that other fund
raising will be unnecessary.
Casa Olivo and Casa Magnolia ex
pect to have their respective quotas
met by tonight, but if not, the two
will combine to sponsor an ice cream
sale to raise the necessary funds.
