### 
Men ordered into the army under
the Selective Service Act will be
inducted the same day they are
given the army physical examina
tion, Selective Service headquarters
announced recently.
Because of the need for more rap
id movement of soldiers into the
training camps, the local boards will
Rive "screening" tests rejecting the
obviously physically unfit men. The
men rated as acceptable for army
service will be notified to report for
induction instead of receiving a
physical examination appointment.
Previously induction at army
training schools had followed ten
days after examinations. Under the
new procedure, officials stated that
the registrants will have the same
rights of appeal and of personal ap
pearance before their local board as
they have at present.
