### 
"Women in California civil serv
ice will be taking over jobs tradi
tionally held by men for the dura
tion of the war," said Miss Kathcr
ine GrofT, Stanford alumna and jun
ior personnel worker on the person
nel board of California, at Women's
Vocom meeting last night.
Mr. E. A. Cottrell, head of the
Political Science Department, speak
ing on the advantages for women in
the federal government, stated, "I
expect the additional employment of
women for federal civil service po
sitions to continue with the same
rapidity as it did in the last war."
Professional fields in government
work for California require regis
tration as a graduate student or six
to twelve months' experience in the
field.
The growing field in both govern
ments* is that of social work; in the
federal level, more women are em
ployed by the Department of Agri
culture than any other department,
according to Mr. Cottrell.
Student chairman for the meeting
was Virginia Stoddard. Next week
Women's Vocom will feature per
sonnel work.
