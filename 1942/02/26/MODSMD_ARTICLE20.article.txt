# Southland Anti-Aircraft Guns Roar at Unidentified Planes; Shrapnel Rains on Los Angeles
## No Bombs Land In Mysterious Aircraft Raid 
### 
LOS ANOELES, Feb. 25 (LJl'>. â€”
Unidentified aircraft flying over the
Los Angeles area early today led to
a crashing anti-aircraft barrage, tin:
first on continental United States in
this war.
The planes had not been identified
at a late hour today.
In San Francisco the headquarters
of the Western Defense Command
and the Fourth Army issued this
statement:
"The aircraft which caused the
blackout in the Los Angeles area for
several hours this morning have not
been identified."
The anti-aircraft barrage and ac
companying blackout was respon
sible for the loss of at least four
lives.
Although police in the war pro
duction centers of Long Beach,
Huntington Park and Inglewood re
ported seeing planes overhead, the
Fourth Army Command in San
Francisco said no bombs were drop
ped nor any planes shot down and
Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox
said in Washington there was no
positive evidence that planes were
overhead.
'LIKE A BALLOON'
Earlier eye-witness reports had
ranged from one to two flights of
planes too high to identify, to a big
bag that "looked something like a
balloon."
The Fourth Army headquarters
announcement said cities in the Los
Angeles area were blacked out al.
2:25 a.m. today on orders from the
Fourth Interceptor Command when
unidentified aircraft were reported
in the area.
Army pursuit planes went up to
investigate and searchlights poked
long fingers into the sky in search
of hostile aircraft, while in the city
below homes, streets and office
buildings were blacked out until
7:21 a.m.
SHRAPNEL RAINS'
Fragments from bursting anti
aircraft shells rained down in a num
ber of districts in Los Angeles and
Orange counties, including the mu
nicipal airport, where authorities
said shrapnel fell like rain. At least
three duds fell and one shell ex
ploded in a garage.
Although reports are conflicting
and every effort is being made to
ascertain the facts, it is clear that
no bombs were dropped and no
planes were shot down.
There was a considerable amount
of anti-aircraft firing.
The report that unidentified air
planes had been sighted came from
Long Beach police, who said they
saw planes in the cone of Army
searchlight beams.
VEER TO SOUTH
They said that after penetrating a
few miles inland from the ocean the
planes veered to the south and dis
appeared. They said they saw either
two separate flights, or the same one
twice.
Army and Navy authorities wid
ened their search today for the
craft, presumably Japanese, which
lobbed five-inch shells at the Bank
line oil refinery 8 miles north of
Santa Barbara last night.
Army planes augmented the Navy
patrol sweeping the sea in search
of the marauding craft.
