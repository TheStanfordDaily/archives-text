# Farm Grad, Husband May Be Captured

"As yet there has been no word
from the Far East," was the terse
reply of Mrs. Everett W. Smith,
whose daughter, the former Shelley
Smith, and her husband, Carl My
dans, have been missing in the j
Orient for the past few months.
Mr. Mydans, a photographer for j
Life magazine, whose exploits were j
pictorially exhibited by a double- j
page story in the February 23 issue, '
undoubtedly attempted to get his I
wife out of Manila, where they both !
were doing photographic work, be
fore the city fell. However, it is
feared that they were captured by
the invaders, as the last word came j
through the day after Christmas, I
and nothing further has been heard j
as to their whereabouts.
The pictures in the current issue
show the photo-reporter and his
wife in France, Finland, China,
Malaya, Sweden, and the Philip
pines. Many Stanfordii.es will quick
ly recognize the young lady at the
head of a regiment of Philippine sol
diers on their way back from Sun
day mass, as well as the striking
photograph of her typing notes by
candlelight during an air raid.
Describing Christmas morning as
"quiet"—except for three air raids
—the brief story tells of the fight
ing courage of the Manila defend
ers. The cablegram added that Ma
nilans first choked on the words
"Merry Christmas," but a new toast
of the day was found in, "May this
be the worst Christmas we ever
spend."
Last words in brief message were,
"We can laugh because we are still
free."
