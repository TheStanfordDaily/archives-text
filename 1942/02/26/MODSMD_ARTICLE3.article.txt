# Night Club Life Won't Win War, Says Dr. Wilbur
## States Health Vital In Modern Fighting; 'Achilles Heel' Cited 
### 
Anyone who thinks a night club
1 is a place to prepare for an all-out
war has another think coming. Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur of Stan
ford University told the annual con
vention of the American Association
I of School Administrators yesterday,
in an address on "Health and Na
tional Defense."
"Walk along the streets, look at
the people you see, look into our
taverns with their vast patronage of
both sexes and most ages, see the
life on our highways, study the ef
fects of preventable diseases, see
how we let carriers of such terrible
diseases as syphilis and gonorrhea
distribute them among our boys
and girls.
i DANGEROUS ENEMIES
"Then ask yourself," admonished
the Stanford medical authority, "can
we go on this way and win a world
war against well-placed, well-or
ganized people who are skilled in
the construction and use of every
weapon of war and animated by an
almost fanatical devotion to a con
quest of their neighbors?"
The military physical fitness rejec
tion rate has been so high not be
cause of a lack of scientific knowl
edge and facilities, but because
health is a personal matter, Dr. Wil
bur said.
UP TO INDIVIDUAL
"Whether or not one is healthy is
largely dependent on action by the
person himself," he asserted. "Where
conduct, discipline, and control are
concerned we are so far behind the
realizable possibilities as to make us
wonder how durable this human be
ing is to be in the long history of
the world."
Physical vigor, he declared, has al
ways been important in war.
"When combined with strategy
and arms it is decisive," he said.
"Now, with the submarine, tank,
airplane, and modern gun, the calls
made upon the quality of the body
and the brain in it are so many and
the contests so sharp that a higher
degree of perfection is sought in
sorting over our boys and men than
ever before."
