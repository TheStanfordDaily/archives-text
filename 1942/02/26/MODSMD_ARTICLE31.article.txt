## 'Mayerling' Recounts Austrian Mystery 
### 
In an Austrian hunting lodge
1 called Mayerling, on a winter's
| morning in 1889, the heir to the
j Hapsburg dynasty was found shot
| with his mistress, the Baroness Marie
j Vetsera.
All who knew were pledged to
j lifelong secrecy by Emperor Franz
Joseph, who officially announced a
double suicide. A document on the
tragedy was considered such dyna
mite that it was eliminated from
the state archives.
i So goes the true story of one of
history's most intriguing mysteries,
which is authentically reproduced in
the motion picture, "Mayerling,"
taking its name from the fateful
hunting lodge.
Charles Boyer takes the part of
the rake, Rudolf, and Danielle Dar
rieux plays the child baroness. They
meet at an opera, and secretly re
convene thereafter. Then the girl's
mother finds out and packs her off
to Trieste. But the pining maiden
finally manages to return to Rudolf,
at the hideaway Mayerling.
"Mayerling" is the last of the
Winter Quarter movies of the Sad
j ler Sunday Series, and will play in
I Memorial Hall at 7:15 p.m., admis
sion 20 cents.
