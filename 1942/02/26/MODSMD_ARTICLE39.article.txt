have ahead when they tackle S.C.
after just returning to the campus

I Monday morning from Westwood and I
! a twin win over the hapless Bruins. \
As the southern division stacks up, j
Stanford will annex its second |
: straight conference title by taking j
both games, while a split with the '
j Trojans would leave matters wide
open, because the Cards have two
more games with California the fol
i lowing week-end.
Right now it's Stanford "won 7,
lost 1," against Southern Califor
; nia's "won 5, lost 3." Should the
1 Redskin drop two games to S.C.,
' things would be squared up, and
! the Trojans almost a cinch to take
| their remaining two encounters from
! U.C.L.A.
The Indians, on the other hand,
had no easy time with the Bears in
their second meeting, being pushed
to double overtime to come out with
a close win. Should Stanford split
with S.C., it must win one of! Cali
fornia to cop the crown.
