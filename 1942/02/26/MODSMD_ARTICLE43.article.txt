# 'Mike,' All Out Defense
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
What happened to Ernie Handlesnian?
Well, he had the misfortune to be followed around this week-end by the
defensive star of a defensive team, William Michael (Muscles) Cowden
of Stanford. When the Indians started a shifting man-to-man defense
down at Westwood, Handlesnian, hottest shot in the league at the time,
was really cooled oIT.
Ernie owes his puny week-end total to the intense guarding of Stan
ford's "Mike," who again this season is proving the southern division's j
best backboard man.
Cowden. Co-captain of the Indians, is not an offensive threat. He has '
one specialty which is pretty good, though. It is circling around his man
in a wide dribbling arc for a lay-in, much as Walt Bickerton used to do. j
Although he has an "on" night once in a while, Cowden's weakness lies )
in his inability to make good consistently on set-shots from beyond the ;
circle, usually one of the tricks of a star guard.
But watch Bill on defense sometime. He has a marvelous knack for ;
getting the ball off his own backboard and clearing it out of the danger
zone. And a ball-hawk is an invaluable guy on any man's team. Re- !
member Ike Frankian, who used to steal the football right out of the
enemy's arms?
Now, almost every week, Stanford faces some ace who is really "having j
his eye." It may be the barrel-chested Roy Tamm next week. But who- j
ever it is it must be comforting to Everett Dean to know he's got a guard- !
ing ace like Bill Cowden to put on the star.
A ball-hawk on defense doesn't blindly bat the ball out or deflect it;
he grabs and holds on until he gets a chance to clear to the other guard !
for the dribble down, or clear a long hook pass to a sleeper far down
court.
Mike Cowden is the perfect defensive player for the position once known
as "standing guard," the man who is the last defense of the home basket.

Cowden. Co-captain of the Indians, is not an offensive threat. He has '
one specialty which is pretty good, though. It is circling around his man
in a wide dribbling arc for a lay-in, much as Walt Bickerton used to do. j
Although he has an "on" night once in a while, Cowden's weakness lies )
in his inability to make good consistently on set-shots from beyond the ;
circle, usually one of the tricks of a star guard.
But watch Bill on defense sometime. He has a marvelous knack for ;
getting the ball off his own backboard and clearing it out of the danger
zone. And a ball-hawk is an invaluable guy on any man's team. Re- !
member Ike Frankian, who used to steal the football right out of the
enemy's arms?
Now, almost every week, Stanford faces some ace who is really "having j
his eye." It may be the barrel-chested Roy Tamm next week. But who- j
ever it is it must be comforting to Everett Dean to know he's got a guard- !
ing ace like Bill Cowden to put on the star.
A ball-hawk on defense doesn't blindly bat the ball out or deflect it;
he grabs and holds on until he gets a chance to clear to the other guard !
for the dribble down, or clear a long hook pass to a sleeper far down
court.
Mike Cowden is the perfect defensive player for the position once known
as "standing guard," the man who is the last defense of the home basket.
What happened to Ernie Handlesnian?
Well, he had the misfortune to be followed around this week-end by the
defensive star of a defensive team, William Michael (Muscles) Cowden
of Stanford. When the Indians started a shifting man-to-man defense
down at Westwood, Handlesnian, hottest shot in the league at the time,
was really cooled oIT.
Ernie owes his puny week-end total to the intense guarding of Stan
ford's "Mike," who again this season is proving the southern division's j
best backboard man.
