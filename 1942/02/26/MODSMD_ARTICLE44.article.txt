# Cards to Meet J.C. Swimmers
## 
### 
Two somewhat weakened Stanford
swimming teams—varsity and fresh
men—will tangle with the Fullerton
Junior College mermen in a double
dual meet in the Encina pools Fri- |
day afternoon at 3:30.
A swimming school, Fullerton has
better than held its own against con
ference four-year colleges up and
down the coast for the past five or
six years. The southerners have
been hit with injuries and losses to
about the same extent as Stanford !
so the meet should be a toss-up.
Top races of the day may prove to
be the sprints, where Bob Brown, j
Fullerton flash, meets Jim Gamble j
of the freshmen and Brad Young and
Don Smith of the varsity. Although
Gamble barely edged Brown in the
Southern California Interscholastic
finals last year, Brown has turned
in the more consistent races this
season.
Ted Munroe. who won the 220 free
style in 2:19.9 last week without any
practice, is favored in the furlong.
Teammate Rey Rule, perhaps the i
most improved man on the team, j
will be there to push him.
The public is cordially invited to
attend, according to Coach Nort
Thornton, Farm swim mentor.
