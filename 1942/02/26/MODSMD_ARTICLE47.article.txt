i fame and glory the
baseball team achieves this year
can be directly attributed to Harry
Wolter's knowledge of the national
pastime. After the first few turnouts,
things looked pretty dark, what with
Captain Aurelio Caruso and other
luminaries not making an appear
ance.
But, by gum, after four games be
hind them the boys are looking
pretty handy. Of course that Cali
fornia Bear has a "murderer's row"
consisting of four sluggers. But may
! be we can out-think 'em.
They tell me Howie Dallmar is a
| neat first-sacker, but he'll have to
| be a combination of Chase, Sisler,
| and Gehrig, to beat out Ray Ham
mett, that big unassuming guy who
has been second violin to F. C. Al
bert for the last two years.
RIGHT here in our midst is one of
the world's best all-around swim
mers and very few people seem to
realize it. His name is—wotinhell
was it now? Oh yeh — Emmett
Cash in.
Cashin transferred this quarter
from U.S.F. He was still taking finals
up in the city and going to classes
here at the same time. As a side
| light, he polished off the National
Junior A.A.U. 440 freestyle title.
| This laurel can be stacked up next
| to the junior medley crown he al
ready won. Em only took third in
I the senior medley last year but
Willy Smith. Jr., the Hawaiian fish
who swims like superfella, was the
winner so we can't blame him for
; not winning that one.
Just to show his versatility, Cash
in holds the American records in
the 440 and 500 breast-stroke. When
reached for a statement last night he
said, "Ummsh ungff." Who would
i have thought that his lodge and eat
! ing club ate at 6:15?
GREGORY LaCava, flicker director,
! has a son named Gil. His son goes
! to U.S.C. and high jumped for them
last year. This year the Trojans
| have a high jumper named Gil
| Greene. Okay, you are saying, so
what? These two guys are one and
j the same, but where the discrepancy
comes in, I don't know. . . . Both
Stan Modzelewski of R.I.S. and Er
' nie Rostock of Eastern Oregon S.T.C.
I broke Hank Luisetti's four-year
I scoring record last week, but even
their wildest admirers cannot hon-
I estly say that they hold a candel
abra to Angelo.
