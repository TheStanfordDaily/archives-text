# Pate Leads 3E To Mural Win
## 
### 
Dave Pate, frosh football player,
led Encina 3E to victory over 4W
last night in the intramural head
liner.
Pate and Dean Rugg took high
point honors in the play-off be
tween winners of Leagues 1 and 2.
The final score was 26 to 21.
With a 13-8 lead at half time, 4W
appeared to have the game in hand,
but their third-floor rivals came up
in the final quarter with enough
of a rally to win easily.
The Chem Department, with its
first solid contender in several years,
smashed Kappa Alpha, 45 to 18. The
test tube boys broke loose in the
final period to run up the one-sided
score. Phil Moss copped scoring
honors with 15 markers.
Headlining tonight's mural bill is
the Firehouse game wtih El Capitan.
The Blazechasers lost to Smiley
Cameron's outfit last time but this
week proved their right to a return
match with a couple of harrowing
wins over the Phi Psis.
The Firehouse was way off in the
last El Capitan encounter and on
the basis of their season play should
be favored tonight. If Monte Pfyl's
crew gets by the clubmen, it will
have disposed of the toughest mural
competition right inside League 3.
Sigma Chi probably presents the
toughest obstacle to the Firehouse in
the playoffs.
