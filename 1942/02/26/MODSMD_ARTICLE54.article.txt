# The 						Tide Turns

THERE have been many critics, even among
the students themselves, in the past few
weeks of Stanford students' attitudes and de
grees of unconcern in the national war effort.
Their charges have been that we college stu
dents have been living in a smug isolationism,
safe from everything but the draft and the
remote possibility of bombing.
Whether this deplorable situation still exists
and, if it does, to what extent, cannot be judged
with certainty. It is still true that many men
prefer to spend the greater part of their time
and effort and intelligence indulging in such
conversational topics as athletics or women, that
many college women cannot think any farther
than the critical, brain-twisting problem of what
to wear on that date next Friday night.
Of course it is true that while we are still in
college obtaining an education it is not so easy
for us to make a visual contribution to the na
tion's offensive drive. There are many things
which have been done by thinking students to
offset this argument, however, and they include
the participation by women in such activities
as Red Cross first-aid work and learning switch
board operation; and men and women jointly
have forfeited week-end trips to San Francisco
for dancing, and they have forfeited expensive
name bands for campus dances. They have
found that they can have as much fun on the
campus and at the same time save money, tires,
and time. Through the persuasion of such clever
publicity as the Senior Prom "park in the Cactus
Gardens" gag, they are becoming content to
stay home week-ends.
Not content with this "negative" type of co
operation, women in Lagunita are voluntarily
going on the "positive" offensive to help avert
humbling defeat and to bring a quicker victory.
Tuesday night one casa in Lagunita Court con
tributed enough money and more to buy a
twenty-five-dollar defense bond, and yester
day morning the bond was purchased and sent
to Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur as a gift to
the University.
This realization of the seriousness of the coun
try's position and this type of positive contri
bution deserves high praise. And it was the
hope of these women that the idea would spread
to all living groups throughout the campus. This
hope was in turn heartily endorsed by Ex Com
mittee Tuesday night when it authorized a
Stanford Defense Bond Drive to be inaugurated
immediately by each organization. This drive
will replace the numerous war relief drives of
last year for allied countries, guarantee Stan
ford will not be "drived" to death.
Presented with this easy and patriotic solution
to the drives problem, members of campus
groups will best co-operate by immediately
chipping in—voluntarily—to buy a defense
bond. By presenting it to the University, they
will be helping both Uncle Sam and Stanford.
