# Rumor Factory
## 
### 
PROBABLY as much confusion has arisen
from the Los Angeles anti-aircraft incident
as from any other newsworthy feature of the
war. While there is such a tremendous interest
in the affair, placing as many rumors as bullets
and shells in the air, only by presumption can
an answer be reached.
The most sensible immediate solution seems
to be this five-hour display was not a "show,"
that possibly it was a mistake. To claim it was
done for morale or as a propaganda device is
going a little too farâ€”we don't have time for
that sort of stuff these days. Just what they
were shooting at, no civilian knows. "Uniden
tified plane or planes" is the Army's answer.
If they had not fired, and the enemy had
bombed, there would have been hell to pay.
