# This Is 'Planning'

### 
THOSE people who have done some serious
thinking about the problem of postwar peace
and reconstruction will be interested to read the
editorial, "Our Own New Order," in the Satur
day Evening Post, out yesterday, which deals
with the report of the National Resources Plan
ning Board. This board is known as the "plan
ning arm" of the President's office, to outline
"some of the major objectives in planning to
win the peace." Among other things, the
board would attempt to maintain the workers'
purchasing power by continuing "some war
production even after the immediate demand is
ended, than to halt precipitately that produc
tion."
The Satevepost interprets this plan:
"The argument here is that we might better
go on making planes and tanks and guns, even
though we should have to dump them in the
sea, than to be making nothing at all in place
of them."
