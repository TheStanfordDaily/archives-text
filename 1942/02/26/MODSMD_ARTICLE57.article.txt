### AMIE REICHERT 
IYJY DEAR MR. MOULE:
This is sort of awkward, I admit, but your
letter in today's Campus Opinion forces me to stamp
my foot and insist that my facts, at least, are not
wrong. I do admit one error: that of blithely assum
ing that those who read my "usual vitriolic tirade"
were well enough informed so that they knew what
I was talking about." I felt no need to give the facts
again.
Apparently I was taking too much for granted. I
am hastening to remedy that unfortunate blunder
and forthwith present the facts in the case.
A while back, the Government declared that Wash
ington's birthday was to be celebrated on Feb. 23
this year since the 22nd fell on a Sunday. Last week,
however, Donald Nelson issued a special plea to
workmen and manufacturers all over the country to
stay on the job on the holiday, to continue uninter
rupted production, because this, Mr. Moule, is war.

was apparently wrong somewhere. It
k was a legitimate dispute and as such should have
been mediated. Meanwhile the sacrifice in time lost
was not worth it. The work should have gone on,
th 6 dispute settled afterwards.
And that is what did happen in some cases. Yes,
Mr. Moule, the workers did refuse to come to work,
but in some cases employers kept their shops going,
short-handed, and paid the difference out of their
own pockets.
A survey made by a San Francisco paper showed
that of the shops involved in the dispute which
were canvassed over half were working with skele
ton crews and 14 per cent were receiving the double
time wage from the pockets of their employers.
You should have known this, Mr. Moule, for it
was on the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle
on Tuesday. If you had known this, Mr. Moule, you
could not have said that the employers voluntarily
closed their plants because of "greed for gi'eater
profits," would you now?
Yes, by all means let us see both sides of the
question. Let us see the small side—the labor dis
pute—and the large side—the war. Let us not for
get that this war is a battle of production and that
the Axis —which works 24 hours a day, seven days a
week—is far ahead of us.
Let's not forget that petty labor squabbles affect the
entire national production effort, and that they are
just one more of the luxuries we cannot afford these
days.
