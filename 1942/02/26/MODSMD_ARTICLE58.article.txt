### MIKE CHURCHILL 
AMIE, you never told me you were "vitupera
k tive." This is the 18th time that we have shared
the same column and only today I find that you are
vitriolic.
Mr. Moule, of the Campus Opinion Moules, evi
dently doesn't like you, or else he has a keen desire
to throw high-sounding invectives around. Not only
are you an "armchair columnist," but you are also
the "dupe of flag-waving profiteers." Amie, there is
nothing worse than being "duped by flag-waving profit
eers," particularly in an "armchair," you should know
that.
Of course, Amie, "your facts were wrong." You
should see "both sides to each question." You should
n't accuse the "workmen" of refusing to work on a
holiday because the "industrialists — now making a
mint out of this bloody war" chose to dispute a con
tract forced down their throats by the workers.
I only hope that in my speaking thus Mr. Moule
will not feel that it is another "blasting attack," aris
ing out of my "self-righteous naivete."

JJY WAY of the publicity director of the B.A.C. comes
a note from Jay Ford, manager of the Stanford
band. Jay says: "Due to the Roble Formal and other
campus dances on the night of March 6, not enough
members of the band will be able to be at the bas
ketball game to make it worth while to save my
seats for them."
This letter all of a sudden seemed to rise in the air
and flutter down wrong side up and I imagined an
other note, this time from Everett Dean, which said, in
my imagination: "Due to the Roble Formal and other
campus dances on the night of March 6 not enough
members of the first string team will be present so the
second or third string will start in their places."
Go ahead, bandsters, have your fun. We will do our
best to keep team spirits high at this very crucial game.
But think of us a little, won't you, as we yell our
selves hoarse for our team and our school. If you are
not too busy would it be too much if we asked that
you find out the score sometime the next day and per
haps congratulate the boys if they win or console them
if they don't.

second or third string will start in their places."
Go ahead, bandsters, have your fun. We will do our
best to keep team spirits high at this very crucial game.
But think of us a little, won't you, as we yell our
selves hoarse for our team and our school. If you are
not too busy would it be too much if we asked that
you find out the score sometime the next day and per
haps congratulate the boys if they win or console them
if they don't.
AMIE, you never told me you were "vitupera
k tive." This is the 18th time that we have shared
the same column and only today I find that you are
vitriolic.
Mr. Moule, of the Campus Opinion Moules, evi
dently doesn't like you, or else he has a keen desire
to throw high-sounding invectives around. Not only
are you an "armchair columnist," but you are also
the "dupe of flag-waving profiteers." Amie, there is
nothing worse than being "duped by flag-waving profit
eers," particularly in an "armchair," you should know
that.
Of course, Amie, "your facts were wrong." You
should see "both sides to each question." You should
n't accuse the "workmen" of refusing to work on a
holiday because the "industrialists — now making a
mint out of this bloody war" chose to dispute a con
tract forced down their throats by the workers.
I only hope that in my speaking thus Mr. Moule
will not feel that it is another "blasting attack," aris
ing out of my "self-righteous naivete."

JJY WAY of the publicity director of the B.A.C. comes
a note from Jay Ford, manager of the Stanford
band. Jay says: "Due to the Roble Formal and other
campus dances on the night of March 6, not enough
members of the band will be able to be at the bas
ketball game to make it worth while to save my
seats for them."
This letter all of a sudden seemed to rise in the air
and flutter down wrong side up and I imagined an
other note, this time from Everett Dean, which said, in
my imagination: "Due to the Roble Formal and other
campus dances on the night of March 6 not enough
members of the first string team will be present so the
second or third string will start in their places."
