## TIRADE BACKFIRE 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Miss Reichert, writer of the Daily's ''History, 1942"
column, launched her usual vitriolic tirade against
labor yesterday. As usual, her facts were wrong.
According to Miss Reichert, 17,000 workmen handed
Hcrr Hitler a laugh by refusing to punch the clock
Monday. According to her, the workmen, or as she
condescendingly puts it "Pacific Coast labor," in
sisted on their right to a holiday, thereby losing the
nation 60,000 hours of work. If such were the facts,
I suppose Amie has a right to show what an armchair
columnist can do in the way of vituperation.
But did the workmen refuse to work? No. Have
the workmen in such a case any initiative in deciding
whether the factory or shipyard stays open or not?
No. Do the workmen run the policies of the plants, or
just the machines? If Miss Reichert will look at the
facts of this situation in particular and any such case
in general, she would see that holidays and overtime
arc covered by a contract which stipulates that time
and a half for overtime is to be paid. This is an exist
ing document in each case, not a sudden demand on
the part of labor groups. If the employers wish to
keep their plants open, they do so, according to con
tract. If they wish to keep them closed, as was the case
Monday, they do so. It must be understood that the
initiative for closing on legal holidays rests on em
ployer action only.
In typical style the employer blames the workers
for unpatriotic cessation of work. Actually greed for
yet greater profits urged employers to close so they
I would avoid the stipulated contract agreement for
higher rates on a holiday. In typical style, the arm
chair columnists fall for the bait and out of their
self-righteous naivete comes a blasting attack on "Pa
) cific Coast labor."
This in itself is not important. But it is important
that we do see both sides to each question. Let us not
be the dupes of flag-waving profiteers. Let's not for
get that industrialists are making a mint out of this
' bloody war. Let's not forget that sticky fingers can
clutch a flag pole and wave as obviously as you and I!
