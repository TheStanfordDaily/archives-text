Dear Dr. Wilbur:
Since the United States' entry into the war, many of us
here at Stanford have felt very helpless. We seem to be giv
ing so little while others arc sacrificing so much. With this
in mind, the residents of Casa Eucalypto in Lagunita Court
enclose a $25 defense bond purchased from voluntary contri
butions.
We present it to you to use for the University in the way
you think best.
Sincerely,
Beryl Robison, President
