production of "The Beggar's Opera"
which the Stanford Players and
Opera Workshop will present in the
Memorial Hall, March 5, 6, and 7.

tumes, will be elevated to a position

bert Jan Popper, as the conductor,
will beat it out with an 18th century
floor length baton.
A type of chamber music will be
produced through the use of the
harpsichord, woodwind, and string
instruments. The music itself is
taken from the popular Continental,
Irish, and English folk tunes of the
day with a few stolen bits from
Handel, who was the most popular
classical writer of the day.
Members of the orchestra include:
Joseph M. Running, harpsichord;
Elizabeth Pierce, Anita Barrett,
Elizabeth Moscr Breed, Harry Strick,
Elwyn Bugge, Nannette Levi, and
