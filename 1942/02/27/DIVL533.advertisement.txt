Here's a suit you
j. -I can wear practically
IT'S THE NEW
ROOS WORSTED CHEVIOT
It's versatile! You're dressed "right" when you wear 1
this new worsted cheviot suit on those weekend dates 01
or on your part-time job. And what's more it makes a ]
swell sports suit if you wear a sweater with it instead
of the vest. The pattern is the trim new broken
Kl
herringbone . . . the fabric is as soft as cheviot yet
wears as well as worsted. It's the kind
of suit you always wished you had.
