LONDON, Friday, Feb. 27 (UP).â€”
American "Flying Tiger" volunteers
and Imperial airmen were reported
today to have shot down more than
100 Japanese planes in the last: two
days as the aerial battle for Burma
reached a new peak of intensity over
Thailand and burned-out Rangoon.
Reports from the Burma front said
the Japanese air force yesterday sent
the biggest armada of bombers and
fighters yet over Rangoon, precipi
tating one of the war's fiercest air
battles when British Hurricanes
and American-built Tomahawks
swept up to challenge them.
