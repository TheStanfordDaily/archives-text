concerns a Stanford man.

was recently cited by Pan-American

here, "Chuck" was
on duty as district
sales manager for
Pan-American at
Hongkong when
the city fell to the
Japanese in De
cember. He work
ed up to the lr it
minute dispatch
ing refugee planes

nlannint* tn

the last one out himself.
A few minutes before the last
plane was scheduled to leave, how
ever. it was bombed and destroyed
on the ground. Shafer is presumed
to have been captured by the enemy.
Shafer, the son of Mrs. Louis
Shafer, 2400 Buchanan Street, San
Francisco, was prominent in cam
pus activities while at Stanford. His
main achievement was the estab
lishment of the Speakers Bureau, of
which he was first manager.
