# March Opera To Highlight Satire, Color
## 
### HELEN LIVINGSTON 
Inspired by the rollicking, bawdy
j paintings of Hogarth are the cos
tumes Helen Green has designed for
the forthcoming production of John
Gay's "Beggars' Opera," to he pre
sented March 5, )i, and 7 in the Me
moi ial 'J heater.
Broad satire and exaggeration
I keynote the full-bottomed perukes
I and periwigs to be worn by the men
j and gay, fly-away bonnets for the
J women. The orchestra is specially
honored with sparkling spun glass
i wigs tied with the traditional black
I ribbons, while the player will cover
I his head with a silver lame periwig
I to set off his cerise velvet suit.
PERIOD COSTUMES
Descriptions of the clothes of the
[ period were found by Mrs. Green
| in Ihe works of Pope, Swift, and
j Johnson, and also in Gay's own
[poems.
The dresses for Polly, Lucy, and
i Macheath, the three leads, are mod
j elled on early eighteenth century
lashions for the upper classes, but
: they are exaggerated in line and
color so that the porcelain-like qual
j ity usually associated with that age
i gives way to a feeling of lusty com
! edy.
ORCHESTRA BERUFFLED
The pastel satins, wigs and flowers,
| lace and ruffles, and panniered hoops
j for the orchestra were taken by
Mrs. Green from the works of the
I French painters of the court of Louis
| XV and are definitely on the rococo
side.
Always a highlight of Stanford
productions, Mrs. Green's costumes
for "Beggars' Opera" promise to add
color, excitement, and atmosphere
to this broad, lusty satire that, hold
ing nothing sacred, takes a well
deserved whack at the comical con
ventions of Italian opera.
