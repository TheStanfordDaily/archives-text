Iho Graduate School of Business, the
man who developed Stanford's vo
cational interest tests, will speak
about his work over KPO and the

ning, Feb. 27, from 10:30 to 11.
Dr. Strong will tell the story of
how he developed the vocational in
terest tests by intensive studies of
hundreds of thousands of individ

choice of a life work, too often a
