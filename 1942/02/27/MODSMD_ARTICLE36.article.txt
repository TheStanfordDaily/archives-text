# Farm Band Hampered by Lack Of Interest, Positions Open
## 
### 
The Stanford band cannot play at week-end basketball games because
it is hampered by a lack of musicians this quarter, according to Jay Ford,
manager, who yesterday urged all former members to return to the hand
ranks.
"In past years* the band was a real activity," declared Ford. "We had

70 members in the band last quarter; 4
now we have 30. It seems that stu- I
dents lose interest in the band at the !
close of the. football season. Wo I
can't play at the basketball games I
because we do not have enough
members to make a presentable
showing."
"The article in yesterday's Daily,"
continued Ford, "throws a bad light
on the band. There are always cer
tain members of the band that can't
play at the games, that's true, but
in the past years we had enough
members that at least we could make
a good showing. If we could get
every student that plays an instru
ment out for band all three quarters"
of (he school year, we ought to have
at least a hundred-piece organiza
tion.
"Mr. Preston Search is a fine band
director, we have lots of good music
to play and the instruments to play
with, but we lack students to make
up the band that Stanford should
have."

There are no "national" holidays
in the U.S. Each state has juris
diction over the holidays to be ob
served.
