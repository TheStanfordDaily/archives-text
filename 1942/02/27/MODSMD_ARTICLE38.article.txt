## Cards in L.A. For Two-Game Crucial Series 
### 
it's the cage season "crooshal."
Thai's the picture in Los Angeles
tonight and tomorrow as Stanford's
league-leading baskethallers reach
out for their second straight south
ern division championship in the
Shrine Auditorium against U.S.C.—
the only conference foe to lick the
Redskins this year.
Should-Everett Dean's quintet dump
the Trojans twice the Indians are
"in," regardless of the outcome of
next week's double-header with

California. If the Redmen split with
Troy, they must heat the Bears once
to retain the title. An even break
with S.C. and two losses to Cal
would end the league race in a
Stanford-S.C. tie.
Should Stanford drop both games
to Southern California, things would
be all tied up at "7 won, 3 lost" for
both teams.
KASY FOR TROY
At that point the Trojans would
have two comparatively easy games
left to play against U.C.L.A., whom
they have already licked 38 consec
utive times. The Redskins, on the
other hand, would have two tough
encounters left against California,
since the Bears drove Stanford iiito
double overtime before dropping a
close contest.
All the "ils" and ''huts" are
needless if Stanford measures Troy
twice.
Three weeks ago Sam Barry
brought his squad to the local Pa
vilion for the first two games of the
four-game series. The Cards won
the opener, 43-33, dropped the sec
ond. 27-23. The Trojans' "lethal
lethargy" tactics slowed the game to
a walk, and the only Card who could
do a thing was center Ed Voss, high
man for the evening with 11 points.
SLOW BREAK AGAIN
Johnny Luber, Bob Ormsby, Ted
Gossard. Len Berg, and Alex Oma
lev. Troy regulars, are expected to
again stick to a slow break ball
freezing offense, while Stanford
will again go down the floor as fast
as its 6-foot-4 average will allow.
With all their height, the Indian
first-stringers can pour on the mer
cury foot when they want to.
Stanford's squad arrived in Los
Angeles yesterday afternoon and
was scheduled for a light workout
last night.

With all their height, the Indian
first-stringers can pour on the mer
cury foot when they want to.
Stanford's squad arrived in Los
Angeles yesterday afternoon and
was scheduled for a light workout
last night.
it's the cage season "crooshal."
Thai's the picture in Los Angeles
tonight and tomorrow as Stanford's
league-leading baskethallers reach
out for their second straight south
ern division championship in the
Shrine Auditorium against U.S.C.—
the only conference foe to lick the
Redskins this year.
Should-Everett Dean's quintet dump
the Trojans twice the Indians are
"in," regardless of the outcome of
next week's double-header with

California. If the Redmen split with
Troy, they must heat the Bears once
to retain the title. An even break
with S.C. and two losses to Cal
would end the league race in a
Stanford-S.C. tie.
Should Stanford drop both games
to Southern California, things would
be all tied up at "7 won, 3 lost" for
both teams.
KASY FOR TROY
At that point the Trojans would
have two comparatively easy games
left to play against U.C.L.A., whom
they have already licked 38 consec
utive times. The Redskins, on the
other hand, would have two tough
encounters left against California,
since the Bears drove Stanford iiito
double overtime before dropping a
close contest.
All the "ils" and ''huts" are
needless if Stanford measures Troy
twice.
Three weeks ago Sam Barry
brought his squad to the local Pa
vilion for the first two games of the
four-game series. The Cards won
the opener, 43-33, dropped the sec
ond. 27-23. The Trojans' "lethal
lethargy" tactics slowed the game to
a walk, and the only Card who could
do a thing was center Ed Voss, high
man for the evening with 11 points.
SLOW BREAK AGAIN
Johnny Luber, Bob Ormsby, Ted
Gossard. Len Berg, and Alex Oma
lev. Troy regulars, are expected to
again stick to a slow break ball
freezing offense, while Stanford
will again go down the floor as fast
as its 6-foot-4 average will allow.
