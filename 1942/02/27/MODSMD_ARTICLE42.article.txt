# Track Season to Open
## 
### 
The gun cracks at 3:30 tomorrow
afternoon. And with (he crack of
that gun the milers in starting down
Angell's cinders will officially open
Stanford's 1942 track season with
the annual lower division-upper
division meet.
And what an event that mile prom
ises to be! Francis Olson, the Farm's
great middle-distance man who was
stricken all last year, will face long
striding, lanky Bob Compton, a con
sistent point-winner for the fresh
men last spring. Both Olson and
Compton will have to step on it, for
right behind them will be Larry
Gray, the lone freshman distance
man.
Three frosh 9.8 century men. Jim
Pel tit. A1 Hoisch, and Dick Ham
bleton should bring 9 points to the
lower classmen in each sprint,
whereas sophomore Don Reiss will
have competition plus from upper
division men Ed Hertel and Vein
Hart in both hurdles.

Captain Gene Kern, last year a
hurdler, has switched to discus
throwing and in that event will lead
all contenders, which include foot
baller Vic Lindskog, Jack Pagen,
and Ed Chynoweth. Lindskog and
Chynoweth will fight it out for first
place shot put points.
Veteran Vern Hart's only real
trouble in the high jump will be
from up-and-coming freshmen Don
Landale and Ross Dana, both 6-feet
-2 jumpers. Russ Peck and Ed To
maso should take the pole vault
hands down.

Herby Lewis, famous left wing on
the Detroit Red Wings, comes from
Duluth.
