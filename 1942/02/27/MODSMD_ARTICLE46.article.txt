### H. DAVID THOREAU III 
IJLACKWELL'S CORNER IN A SOUTHBOUND DUSENBERG, Feb. 25.
I riÂ»lit> and Saturday night's the "Highboys" will don their greasepaint
and step out behind (he footlights onto the stage of Los Angeles' Shrine
Auditorium, the scene of everything from grand opera to "I Am" revivals.
It is a beautiful big auditorium with plenty of seats, but from one
third of them you can see only one basket. That may not matter to some
people, but I prefer the whole court when I go to a game. One of the
most interesting phases of the games is watching the ball roll off the stage
down into the orchestra pit in the trombone section and secretly hoping
that the re! will fall off too and break his neck.
Two years ago when U.S.C. was highly favored to win the conference
title they split two games wtih the Williams-Anderson-Taylor-Davidson-
Cowden combination on the Shrine stage. Last year with Dean's men
the popular choice, the Trojans were able to share the two games played
on the stage. If we split this year, we are a cinch lor a tie in the southern
division race. If we win both games from U.S.C., "We're in," to use the
vernacular.
with the B.A.C.'s new policy of cutting down on athletic budgets
comes the news that the boxing team isn't going south at all this week
end and only 12 basketball players are making the trip instead of the
usual 11 or 15.
Maybe the board was justified in cutting the hoop squad down since
Coach Dean usually doesn't use too many men anyway, but when the
boxing team only has four team matches this year to start with, it seems
rather unjust to cut off their only trip of any length. The reason given
for cancelling the pugilists' match was that since Stanford couldn't muster
a 120- or 127-pound fighter and since U.C.L.A. didn't have an eligible
heavyweight sitting around, there would be only five fights which wouldn't
make the trip worthwhile.
However, since the number of men they would have had to take
down is relative to the number of fights, there would be only a slight
expense involved.
The basketball team felt so strongly about their squad being cut that
they have all chipped in and are taking a 13th man along out of their
own pockets.
Maybe it's better to have a balanced budget.
