# From Bad to Worse
## 
### 
THE track and field situation at Stanford is
going from bad to worse.
Last year at this time discontent with the
training and coaching policies led to the with
drawal of several top-notch performers from the
team.
The list of athletes who were disgusted with
the administration of track and field sports at
Stanford is guite impressive. It includes an
outstanding hurler, a sure point-winner in the
sprints, and a couple of fine middle-distance
men. And these boys were not the only ones
who gave up their favorite competitive sport.
There was a great deal of arguing and com
plaining last year and Stanford dropped to its
lowest track level.
The trouble last year had a definite setting.
Pitch lohnson was in a tough spot when he
started coaching here. Had he made a tem
porary compromise with the methods of his
predecessor, easy-going Bill Ellington, Pitch
could have gradually installed his methods of
coaching and his policies on training without
shocking his sguad into rebellion.
Commissioner Atherton lopped off Johnson's
best prospects soon after the season closed.
Many observers believed that Stanford, with
its smallest and most colorless team in many
a year coming up for the 1942 season, would
have to bear down and iron out these bicker
ings in order to make any kind of a showing
at all.
Now, this early in the track season, the trouble
has sprung up again, although there were no
indications this week that it would develop into
a "strike" such as occurred last year.
This time the fault seems to lie for the greater
part with the coach. Pitch Johnson has not
been here long enough to really know all his
men; if he had, he would not call Vern Hart a
"trouble-maker," and lay the blame for this
week's outbursts on the shoulders of his jump
ing ace.
Hart has been anything but a "trouble-mak
er." He captained the freshman track team two
years ago and has proved a leader among his
fellow-students. Hart may have been slightly
rebellious at times but this is nothing more
than a number of other track men have exhib
ited in the last two years. He came to Stanford
too late to work under the terrific discipline of
Dink Templeton. He is a product of the Bill
Ellington era and naturally revolts against some
of the strict regulations of the present regime.
Hart is not the only athlete involved in the
bickering. His case is mentioned here just as an
example chosen at random from several com
plaints registered. Last year's serious situation
must not come into being this spring.
If one or more of our athletes suddenly de
cide to compete for the Olympic Club this year
it will indicate that this dissension at Angell
Field has gone far enough, if not too far.â€”Hap

Just a reminder to those students driving
south to Los Angeles for the Southern Cali
fcrna basketball series this week-end to drive
carefully and save lives and tires.
