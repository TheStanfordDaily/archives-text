THE third year of the Stanford Family Call is
practically a thing of the past, but what will
not be forgotten soon is the excellent job done
and the exceptional results achieved by Bob
Crary and his committee.
With tabulations still in the preliminary stage,
last year's total of $1,500 has been surpassed by
at least $1,000. Crary expects the final figure
to reach at least $3,000. This means that this
year, with a war being fought and taxes going
up, the collection has egualed the combined
totals of the past two years.
Mr. Dave Jacobson, assistant director of the
Stanford Fund, who worked hand-in-hand with
Crary, reports that many fine compliments have
been received on the way the calls were con
ducted. This means that the Family Call has
served a two-fold purpose:
1. It has brought in much needed revenue to
help Stanford carry on its war program.
2. It has made many friends for the Univer
sity by the way the callers carried on their work.
Besides Crary and Mr. Jacobson special credit
for a fine job should go to Mr. Paul Davis, as
sistant director of the Stanford Fund, Helen
Knight, Marge Gestring, Vern Edler, and Jack
Pugh, the Stanford Aides.—John Horrall

Latest recTuit for "Offense tor Victory" is
Wendell L. Willkie, who yesterday called
upon the nation to begin thinking in terms of
attack and victory instead of defense in its
war against the Axis nations.
The nation should think in terms "of at
tack. not of retreat; we should begin to act in
terms of striking, not blocking," he said.
