■ PRESENTING the first wartime Congressional test
on curtailment of New Deal social reforms, the
proposed suspension of the 40-hour week was bitterly
criticized yesterday by Administration spokesmen
who said the backers of the proposal were "waging a
war for industrial slavery."
This proposed legislation would suspend for the
duration the 40-hour week and the overtime pay pro
visions of the Wage-Hour Law and the other statutes
affecting labor.
The whole oppostion, which has causcd quite a
debate in the House, revolves around the idea that
some sacred thing is being taken away from the
worker.
Now the Roosevelt administration has been a good
thing for the worker. There is no getting around that.
In fact, business men love to sit around and feel sorry
for themselves, picturing their class as caught in a
giant government pincers, one arm of which is in the
form of taxes on profits and ceilings on prices, the
other in the form of administration-backed labor de
mands for higher wages.
The businessman-philosopher has in the last few
years pointed out that the President is in fact attempt
ing a redistribution of the wealth in this country—a
truly horrible thing.
But lately we haven't been hearing a great deal
about this internal social deal of Roosevelt's. The last
big noise in this connection was early last year when
the opposition demanded that the all-out defense
effort, be really all-out, meaning the administration
should forget its long-range objective of juggling the
class system around.
Getting back to the recurrence of the "class war,"
if you want to call it that, the proposal now under de
bate in the House was introduced by Representative
Howard Smith of Virginia as an amendment to the
second War Powers bill. In defense, the Smith bloc
claimed short work-week and overtime requirements
should be shelved on grounds they have hampered the
war production effort and have placed heavy finan
cial burdens on industry. Just to get technical, they
argued that it was not germane to the war powers bill,
which already contains unrelated amendments designed
to "facilitate the war effort."
Leading the fight against the bill was a pretty po
tent combination. Majority Leader McCormack, prob
ably speaking for the President, urged the boys to
reject this proposal on grounds that passage would
increase labor strife. Then, Sidney Hillman of the War
Production Board's labor division said the enactment
of this bill would result in "incalculable loss" to the
war production program. He said it would result in
confusion and a "lowering of morale" among the
workers.
Putting a dramatic end to the terrific session of
wrangling, Chairman Mary Norton of the House labor
committee, said:
"For God's sake, don't kill the spirit of the Ameri
can worker."
Well, it looks like Washington is still on the labor
train.

some sacred thing is being taken away from the
worker.
Now the Roosevelt administration has been a good
thing for the worker. There is no getting around that.
In fact, business men love to sit around and feel sorry
for themselves, picturing their class as caught in a
giant government pincers, one arm of which is in the
form of taxes on profits and ceilings on prices, the
other in the form of administration-backed labor de
mands for higher wages.
The businessman-philosopher has in the last few
years pointed out that the President is in fact attempt
ing a redistribution of the wealth in this country—a
truly horrible thing.
But lately we haven't been hearing a great deal
about this internal social deal of Roosevelt's. The last
big noise in this connection was early last year when
the opposition demanded that the all-out defense
effort, be really all-out, meaning the administration
should forget its long-range objective of juggling the
class system around.
Getting back to the recurrence of the "class war,"
if you want to call it that, the proposal now under de
bate in the House was introduced by Representative
Howard Smith of Virginia as an amendment to the
second War Powers bill. In defense, the Smith bloc
claimed short work-week and overtime requirements
should be shelved on grounds they have hampered the
war production effort and have placed heavy finan
cial burdens on industry. Just to get technical, they
argued that it was not germane to the war powers bill,
which already contains unrelated amendments designed
to "facilitate the war effort."
Leading the fight against the bill was a pretty po
tent combination. Majority Leader McCormack, prob
ably speaking for the President, urged the boys to
reject this proposal on grounds that passage would
increase labor strife. Then, Sidney Hillman of the War
Production Board's labor division said the enactment
of this bill would result in "incalculable loss" to the
war production program. He said it would result in
confusion and a "lowering of morale" among the
workers.
Putting a dramatic end to the terrific session of
wrangling, Chairman Mary Norton of the House labor
committee, said:
"For God's sake, don't kill the spirit of the Ameri
can worker."
Well, it looks like Washington is still on the labor
train.

■ PRESENTING the first wartime Congressional test
on curtailment of New Deal social reforms, the
proposed suspension of the 40-hour week was bitterly
criticized yesterday by Administration spokesmen
who said the backers of the proposal were "waging a
war for industrial slavery."
This proposed legislation would suspend for the
duration the 40-hour week and the overtime pay pro
visions of the Wage-Hour Law and the other statutes
affecting labor.
