CACTI IN THE MOONLIGHT
/ "ACTUS GARDENS, soft moonlight, the girl you
love, what a wonderful tradition. So many stu
dents got a taste of it Wednesday night that they arc
calling for more.
If it was allowed Wednesday, why can't we do it
all the time. Let's "Park for Defense."
It was so much fun the other night that most stu
dents didn't mind at all the Senior Prom committee
coming around putting litllc white envelopes on their
windshields. "The students all seemed most co-opera
tive," said Charlie Bull of the committee. "Most of
them didn't come out just to get a free bid," added
Mary Helen MeCune.
Parking in the evening has been given an evil taint
by some people. But isn't it one of the oldest of cus
toms? People haven't always used autos, it's true, but
the idea has been the same. Cleopatra moored her
barge in a back eddy of the Nile, Ben Hur tethered
his chariot close to a spreading olive tree.
It's economical, hence patriotic. It's not hard on
the eyes like a movie, or on the liver like a pineapple
malt, so it's healthful. Please can't we park on the
campus?
A Phi Kap I know, his top down, his radio playing
softly, stopped up behind the campus only to have a
policeman send him away. A couple of miles farther
he again stopped and the same policeman moved him
on once more, but feeling pity, gave him complete
directions as to how to get to a particularly fine spot,
with a splendid view, and free from all patrolmen.
If we could only park on campus, think of the
tires we'd save.
* * i|t n
it has little to do with parking, Lagunita
deserves a lot of credit for getting the "Defense
Bonds Buy Offense Bombs" campaign ofT to an ex
cellent start. Keep up the good work, girls.
How about substituting defense stamps for the tra
ditional flowers or candy gift that usually compen
sates for a lockout? Or when you next become en
gaged would it be as effective if you flashed defense
stamps instead of the candy?
When a fellow asks you for a coke date you might
suggest that he take you to the golf course instead and
buy a defense stamp rather than a coke. The govern
ment issues little books in which you can stick these
stamps. Think of the thrill as you turned in your first
full book for a defense bond.

Parking in the evening has been given an evil taint
by some people. But isn't it one of the oldest of cus
toms? People haven't always used autos, it's true, but
the idea has been the same. Cleopatra moored her
barge in a back eddy of the Nile, Ben Hur tethered
his chariot close to a spreading olive tree.
It's economical, hence patriotic. It's not hard on
the eyes like a movie, or on the liver like a pineapple
malt, so it's healthful. Please can't we park on the
campus?
A Phi Kap I know, his top down, his radio playing
softly, stopped up behind the campus only to have a
policeman send him away. A couple of miles farther
he again stopped and the same policeman moved him
on once more, but feeling pity, gave him complete
directions as to how to get to a particularly fine spot,
with a splendid view, and free from all patrolmen.
If we could only park on campus, think of the
tires we'd save.

How about substituting defense stamps for the tra

stamps instead of the candy?
When a fellow asks you for a coke date you might
suggest that he take you to the golf course instead and
buy a defense stamp rather than a coke. The govern
ment issues little books in which you can stick these
stamps. Think of the thrill as you turned in your first
full book for a defense bond.
CACTI IN THE MOONLIGHT
/ "ACTUS GARDENS, soft moonlight, the girl you
love, what a wonderful tradition. So many stu
dents got a taste of it Wednesday night that they arc
calling for more.
If it was allowed Wednesday, why can't we do it
all the time. Let's "Park for Defense."
It was so much fun the other night that most stu
dents didn't mind at all the Senior Prom committee
coming around putting litllc white envelopes on their
windshields. "The students all seemed most co-opera
tive," said Charlie Bull of the committee. "Most of
them didn't come out just to get a free bid," added
