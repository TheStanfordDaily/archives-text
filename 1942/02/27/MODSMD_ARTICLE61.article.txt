# Nostalgic Film Stars Colbert As Instructor
## 
### 
"REMEMBER THE DAY," now
playing at the Fox-Stanford in Palo
Alto.
Slightly nostalgic, slightly satirical,
and leaning strongly to the oversen
timental side, "Remember the Day"
goes back to 1916 and evolves
around the favorite pupil and the
romance of a grammar school |
teacher.
It is refreshing to see the boy
meets-girl in a different approach,
and to see children behaving like
children and not like child actors.
Claudette Colbert does a first-rate
dramatic job as the school teacher,
and John Payne is well fit as her
suitor.
The picture as a whole, in fact, is
well done. For without being com
monplace, it is simple.
The second-fiddle feature, how
ever. has got rocks in its nets. â€”
