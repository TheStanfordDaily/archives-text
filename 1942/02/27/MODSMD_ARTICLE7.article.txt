# Family Call Funds Near $3000 Total
## 
### 
With callers still canvassing six
Peninsula communities, the Family
Call drive, which set a new record
earlier in the week, has now reached
$2500 in receipts, according to Dave
Jacobson, assistant director of the
Stanford Fund.
Last year's total was $1500. and
this year's drive, surpassing that
mark by better than $1000, is ex
pected to reach $3000 by the end of
the week. Final tabulations are
scheduled to be completed over the
week-end.
The success of the drive is due in
large part to such substantial checks
as the one for $500 turned in by
Frank Bauman and Katy Gore, and
the one for $250 turned in by Lew
Reese and Peggy Perring.
