### BOB SONTAG 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2K. — Stanford's whirl wind-breaking cagers
clinched their second straight southern division championship with vic
tories over U.S.C. last night and tonight in the Shrine Auditorium before
crowds of 3500. The slim Indians will meet Oregon State College in the
Pacific Coast Conference play-off here March 14, 15, and 17.

All the critics who said Stanford
couldn't play top-notch basketball
two nights in a row will have to
change their ways after watching
the Redskins trim Troy on succes
sive evenings, 46-44 and 47-43.
Not only did the Everett Dean
coached quint play its best series of
the year, but also after a trip to Los
Angeles just a week ago, when
U.C.L.A. bowed to the Redmen
twice.
DEAN TELLS ALL
Dean, mild-mannered mentor of
the varsity had thus much to say after
the doubleheader win:
"The boys went south realizing
they could win or lose the cham
pionship in the S.C. series. They
showed great determination, and
as a result played their best two
game series of the year.
"Every player did his part with
the two sophomores, Howard
Dallmar and Jim Pollard play
ing outstanding games.
"I am proud of the team's per
formance, as well as its sports
manship during this hard-fought
series."
FRIDAY, 46-44
The Indian-Trojan match last
night produced the wildest thriller
this howling Shrine mob has seen
in a long time.
Though Stanford had a fairly safe
lead at 23-15 after the first half, the
game opened up as the second pe
riod wore on, the Trojans pulling up
to 30-31 on Jim Seminoff's tip-in,
and a moment later going to the
front on Alex Omalev's 15-foot
push shot.
Stanford's fast break suddenly
tore loose. Pollard pushed one
through from the circle. Dallmar
followed with another of the same.
Stanford got the ball out of bounds
a moment later and Pollard heaved
the ball straight down to Bill Cow
don at mid-court and followed up
the pass, taking the ball from
Cowden for a lay-up.
TROJANS CREEP UP
That put. the Redskins back on
top, 157-[)2. Southern California aban
doned its ball control game and be
gan shooting from every angle.
Johnny Luber and Len Berg hit
the bucket from miles, but towering
Eddie Voss scored a tip-in and added
two free throws.
Two minutes later, after the Tro
jans crept up to 41-43, Dallmar sank
one, putting Stanford ahead, 45-41,
but Berg again found the bucket for
45-43. With 37 seconds to go, Bob
Ormsby tallied a free throw, bring
ing S.C. to within 1 point, 44-45,
Don Burness went to the free throw
line and coolly dropped in a charity
toss, the last point of the game.
SATURDAY, 47-43
Tonight was Dallmar night, for
Stanford as the ace soph guard
bombed the bucket, for 18 points.
Pollard was right behind with 13.
The game was not as close as the
score would indicate.
Stanford was ahead 46-34, with
3 minutes to go in the last half, when
Ormsby scored three successive
buckets from around the 15-foot
mark. With their safe lead of 12
points the Indians, instead of freez
ing the leather up to the gun, elected
to keep the game going and took
more tries from the floor than they
normally would. As it was, the In
dians stayed in front easily with the
best display of passing and team
work we've seen all season.

DEAN TELLS ALL
Dean, mild-mannered mentor of
the varsity had thus much to say after
the doubleheader win:
"The boys went south realizing
they could win or lose the cham
pionship in the S.C. series. They
showed great determination, and
as a result played their best two
game series of the year.
"Every player did his part with
the two sophomores, Howard
Dallmar and Jim Pollard play
ing outstanding games.
"I am proud of the team's per
formance, as well as its sports
manship during this hard-fought
series."
FRIDAY, 46-44
The Indian-Trojan match last
night produced the wildest thriller
this howling Shrine mob has seen
in a long time.
Though Stanford had a fairly safe
lead at 23-15 after the first half, the
game opened up as the second pe
riod wore on, the Trojans pulling up
to 30-31 on Jim Seminoff's tip-in,
and a moment later going to the
front on Alex Omalev's 15-foot
push shot.
Stanford's fast break suddenly
tore loose. Pollard pushed one
through from the circle. Dallmar
followed with another of the same.
Stanford got the ball out of bounds
a moment later and Pollard heaved
the ball straight down to Bill Cow
don at mid-court and followed up
the pass, taking the ball from
Cowden for a lay-up.
TROJANS CREEP UP
That put. the Redskins back on
top, 157-[)2. Southern California aban
doned its ball control game and be
gan shooting from every angle.
Johnny Luber and Len Berg hit
the bucket from miles, but towering
Eddie Voss scored a tip-in and added
two free throws.
Two minutes later, after the Tro
jans crept up to 41-43, Dallmar sank
one, putting Stanford ahead, 45-41,
but Berg again found the bucket for
45-43. With 37 seconds to go, Bob
Ormsby tallied a free throw, bring
ing S.C. to within 1 point, 44-45,
Don Burness went to the free throw
line and coolly dropped in a charity
toss, the last point of the game.
SATURDAY, 47-43
Tonight was Dallmar night, for
Stanford as the ace soph guard
bombed the bucket, for 18 points.
Pollard was right behind with 13.
The game was not as close as the
score would indicate.
Stanford was ahead 46-34, with
3 minutes to go in the last half, when
Ormsby scored three successive
buckets from around the 15-foot
mark. With their safe lead of 12
points the Indians, instead of freez
ing the leather up to the gun, elected
to keep the game going and took
more tries from the floor than they
normally would. As it was, the In
dians stayed in front easily with the
best display of passing and team
work we've seen all season.

sive evenings, 46-44 and 47-43.
Not only did the Everett Dean
coached quint play its best series of
the year, but also after a trip to Los
Angeles just a week ago, when
U.C.L.A. bowed to the Redmen
twice.
DEAN TELLS ALL
Dean, mild-mannered mentor of
the varsity had thus much to say after
the doubleheader win:
"The boys went south realizing
they could win or lose the cham
pionship in the S.C. series. They
showed great determination, and
as a result played their best two
game series of the year.
"Every player did his part with
the two sophomores, Howard
Dallmar and Jim Pollard play
ing outstanding games.
"I am proud of the team's per
formance, as well as its sports
manship during this hard-fought
series."
FRIDAY, 46-44
The Indian-Trojan match last
night produced the wildest thriller
this howling Shrine mob has seen
in a long time.
Though Stanford had a fairly safe
lead at 23-15 after the first half, the
game opened up as the second pe
riod wore on, the Trojans pulling up
to 30-31 on Jim Seminoff's tip-in,
and a moment later going to the
front on Alex Omalev's 15-foot
push shot.
Stanford's fast break suddenly
tore loose. Pollard pushed one
through from the circle. Dallmar
followed with another of the same.
Stanford got the ball out of bounds
a moment later and Pollard heaved
the ball straight down to Bill Cow
don at mid-court and followed up
the pass, taking the ball from
Cowden for a lay-up.
TROJANS CREEP UP
That put. the Redskins back on
top, 157-[)2. Southern California aban
doned its ball control game and be
gan shooting from every angle.
Johnny Luber and Len Berg hit
the bucket from miles, but towering
Eddie Voss scored a tip-in and added
two free throws.
Two minutes later, after the Tro
jans crept up to 41-43, Dallmar sank
one, putting Stanford ahead, 45-41,
but Berg again found the bucket for
45-43. With 37 seconds to go, Bob
Ormsby tallied a free throw, bring
ing S.C. to within 1 point, 44-45,
Don Burness went to the free throw
line and coolly dropped in a charity
toss, the last point of the game.
SATURDAY, 47-43
Tonight was Dallmar night, for
Stanford as the ace soph guard
bombed the bucket, for 18 points.
Pollard was right behind with 13.
The game was not as close as the
score would indicate.
Stanford was ahead 46-34, with
3 minutes to go in the last half, when
Ormsby scored three successive
buckets from around the 15-foot
mark. With their safe lead of 12
points the Indians, instead of freez
ing the leather up to the gun, elected
to keep the game going and took
more tries from the floor than they
normally would. As it was, the In
dians stayed in front easily with the
best display of passing and team
work we've seen all season.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2K. — Stanford's whirl wind-breaking cagers
clinched their second straight southern division championship with vic
tories over U.S.C. last night and tonight in the Shrine Auditorium before
crowds of 3500. The slim Indians will meet Oregon State College in the
Pacific Coast Conference play-off here March 14, 15, and 17.

All the critics who said Stanford
couldn't play top-notch basketball
two nights in a row will have to
change their ways after watching
the Redskins trim Troy on succes
sive evenings, 46-44 and 47-43.
