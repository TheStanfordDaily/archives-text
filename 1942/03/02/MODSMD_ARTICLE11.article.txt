# Japanese Juggernaut Smashes On Into Java; Fall of Rangoon Looms
## London Holds Out Little Hope for Burmese Capital As Japs Prepare for K.O. 
### 
LONDON, March 1 (UP). —Reinforced Japanese in
vaders of Burma were believed tonight to he massing
for an imminent knockout onslaught against Rangoon
and responsible quarters voiced grave doubt that the
seared and battered capital could be held for long.
The All-India Radio broadcast Rangoon army and
air communiques announcing intensified enemy activ-

ity along the tottering front west of
the Sittang River hut revealing that
the shattering blows struck by
American volunteer and Imperial
airmen had sharply reduced Japa
nese aerial bombardment.
In every hand in London the
plight of the British Empire defend
ers of Rangoon was recognized as
desperate. Some competent sources
even said it appeared unlikely that
most of the men waging the last
ditch stand would be able to escape
from southern Burma.
JAPS REINFORCED
Latest report to London reflected
a relative lull during the week-end
as the Japanese rushed up rein
forcements and the Imperials dug in
behind the Sittang River for staunch
defense of the capital.
(A United Press dispatch from
American volunteer group head
quarters in China said authoritative
military quarters believed the fall of
Rangoon was a matter of days, per
haps hours.
(It said the Japanese had mus
tered a powerful fifth-column army
in Burma, some of the armed Bur
mese forces even throwing in with
the Japanese, multiplying the diffi
culties of the Imperial defense
forces.)
INTENSIFIED ACTIVITY
"Patroling continues on the Sit
tang front, and there are indications
of intensified enemy activity," the
Army communique broadcast by the
All-India Radio said.
Calcutta dispatches quoted a re
port from Mandalay that the long
expected full-scale Japanese assault
on Rangoon "may be said to have
begun Wednesday."
(Berlin relayed a Tokyo report
attributed to Imperial Headquarters
that between Feb. 9 and 25 the Japa
nese forces in Burma captured 2,398
British troops and killed 3,537. They
also were said to have siezed 12
tanks, 88 guns, 161 machine guns,
1,003 rifles, 557 vehicles, and 500,000
cartridges.)

tered a powerful fifth-column army
in Burma, some of the armed Bur
mese forces even throwing in with
the Japanese, multiplying the diffi
culties of the Imperial defense
forces.)
INTENSIFIED ACTIVITY
"Patroling continues on the Sit
tang front, and there are indications
of intensified enemy activity," the
Army communique broadcast by the

LONDON, March 1 (UP). —Reinforced Japanese in
vaders of Burma were believed tonight to he massing
for an imminent knockout onslaught against Rangoon
and responsible quarters voiced grave doubt that the
seared and battered capital could be held for long.
The All-India Radio broadcast Rangoon army and
air communiques announcing intensified enemy activ-

ity along the tottering front west of
the Sittang River hut revealing that
the shattering blows struck by
American volunteer and Imperial
airmen had sharply reduced Japa
nese aerial bombardment.
In every hand in London the
plight of the British Empire defend
ers of Rangoon was recognized as
desperate. Some competent sources
even said it appeared unlikely that
most of the men waging the last
ditch stand would be able to escape
from southern Burma.
JAPS REINFORCED
Latest report to London reflected
a relative lull during the week-end
as the Japanese rushed up rein
forcements and the Imperials dug in
behind the Sittang River for staunch
defense of the capital.
