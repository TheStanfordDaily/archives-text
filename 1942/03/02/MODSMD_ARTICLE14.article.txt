# Schultz Finds Theory False
## Professor Disproves Old Nerve Cell Belief 
### 
PALO ALTO, March 1 (UP). â€”
Experiments by Dr. Edwin W.
Schultz in the Stanford University
laboratory have proven false the
commonly accepted belief that once
a nerve cell is dead it can never be
restored, it was revealed today.
While working on a phase of in
fantile paralysis research in the
Stanford biological laboratories, Dr.
Schultz discovered that certain
nerve cells of the animal body are
capable of regeneration after having
been completely destroyed by chem
ical action.
His finding has been published in
the journal infectious diseases as a
part of an extensive summary of
poliomyelitis studies carried on
jointly by Dr. Schultz and Dr. L. B.
Gebhardt of the University's De
partment of Bacteriology and Expe
rimental Pathology.
Dr. Schultz found that within
two weeks after the neurones of the
olfactory nerve of monkeys were de
stroyed by zinc sulphate, new nerve
cells begin to form in the lining of
the nasal tract.
The discovery was made while the
pathologist sought the answer to
why monkeys become susceptible to
intranasal inoculations of the polio
myelitis virus after having success
fully resisted the virus over a period
of several months due to the appli
cation of zinc sulphate.
Dr, Schultz' conclusion Ls based on
examination of nearly 10,000 specially
stained sections of the nasal linings
from some 200 monkeys.
