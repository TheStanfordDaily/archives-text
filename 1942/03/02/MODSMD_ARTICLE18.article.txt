ALLIED lIEADQUAKTERS. JAVA. Monday, March
1 (UP). —Japanese columns pushing into Java from
three strategic beachheads, today admittedly had cap
tured Soebang, within 40 miles of the Netherlands
Army Headquarters at Bandoeng, but the Dutch de
fenders were inflicting thousands of casualties and ap
plying the "scorched earth" policy ruthlessly as they
'♦■fell back.

United Nations planes roared over
the invader columns, blasting troops
and ships of the invasion fleet with
tons of bombs which scored direct
hits on 27 or more transports and
warships.
In Batavia, a statement issued
from Gen. Sir Archibald Wavell's
United Nations headquarters said
that "action against the enemy, who
at all invasion points is trying to
enforce strong infiltration by cyclists
with rather light armaments and
light armored cars, continues day
long."
LOSSES INFLICTED
"At numerous points losses were
inflicted on the Japanese. Action
against the advancing cyclists in the
vicinity of Blora (approximately 20
miles south of Rembang, one of the
invasion points) cost many Japa
nese their lives.
"Necessary destructions at vital
points which were threatened by in
filtrating units have been carried
out.
DUTCH RUSH TROOPS
Dutch Indodensian troops were be
ing rushed by train and truck to the
threatened areas — one of which,
around Krawang, would place the
Japanese within 40 miles of Batavia,
the capital.
The Japanese sweeping over the
plains of Krawang presumably came
from Indramajoe where the defend
ers claimed to have inflicted their
greatest damage on the invasion
troops, littering the beaches with
thousands of Japanese mown down
as they streamed ashore, and blow
ing up or drowning others aboard
their wrecked transports.
