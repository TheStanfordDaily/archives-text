# Ballinger Case Closes as Jury Decides Suicide
## Investigator Proves Telephone Was Used To Discharge Pistol 
### 
(Picturc on Page 2)
Scientific evidence proving that
Loighton Ballinger, Stanford assist
ant who was found dead on Feb. 18
in his Palo Alto apartment, used a
telephone receiver to discharge his
defective .22 caliber target pistol into
himself, Friday caused a coroner's
jury to return a verdict of "death
by self-inflicted gunshot wounds."
The jury, composed of 11 men,
deliberated less than a half hour
before bringing in the verdict of
suicide. The coroner's inquest was
held at Roller and Hapgood, funeral
directors, in Palo Alto.
After almost two hours of testi
mony from principals in the case,
Robert Drexel, special investigator
for the District Attorney's office,
demonstrated how Ballinger had
killed himself.
First, Drexel said, he had "posi
tively determined" that the bullet
which killed Ballinger was fired from
the .22 caliber target pistol found
under the Stanford assistant's body.
This, he said, was done by firing
another bullet from the same gun
and comparing the riflings on that
bullet with the markings on the
bullet extracted from Bellinger's
body.
TRIGGER SPRING GONE
In attempting to fire this test
bullet, Drevel said, he noticed that
the trigger spring had been extracted
from the gun so that it would not
fire unless the hammer were struck
with some blunt instrument.
An examination of the telephone
cradle which Ballinger held tightly
in his right hand showed a chipped
notch which fitted the hammer of the
revolver.
In reconstructing the suicide,
Drexel demonstrated how Ballinger
had evidently struck the hammer of
the revolver with the telephone
cradle to fire the cartridge which
killed him.
Drexel explained that he had taken
wax casts of the dead man's hands
and found traces of nitrates in the
pores around the thumb of the left
hand. This would prove, said Drexel,
that the Run had been held in his
left hand with the muzzle toward
Ballinger's body.
Furthermore, powder marks on
Ballinger's clothing and on his body
proved that the gun had been held
tightly against the body, Drexel
testified.
SUICIDE MOTIVE
Throughout the inquest, conducted
by Deputy Coroner Harry Ryder and
District Attorney Allan P. Lindsay,
efforts were made to find some rea
son for Ballinger's suicide.
Deborah Cleveland, who found
Ballinger's body, said that he
"seemed quite cheerful" when she
saw him Tuesday about 9:30 p.m. It
was estimated that Ballinger had
died about midnight Tuesday.
Miguel A. Prado, Stanford in
structor, said Ballinger had been try
ing to find work at Permanente and
in San Francisco ship yards. He
said Ballinger was attempting to sell
his car to pay a tuition note which
he owed the University.
Prado said Ballinger had told him
about six weeks ago that "ho had
taken the gun and put it against his
body and pulled the trigger nine
times, but the gun didn't go off."

had evidently struck the hammer of
the revolver with the telephone
cradle to fire the cartridge which
killed him.
Drexel explained that he had taken
wax casts of the dead man's hands
and found traces of nitrates in the
pores around the thumb of the left
hand. This would prove, said Drexel,
that the Run had been held in his
left hand with the muzzle toward
Ballinger's body.
Furthermore, powder marks on
Ballinger's clothing and on his body
proved that the gun had been held
tightly against the body, Drexel
testified.
SUICIDE MOTIVE
Throughout the inquest, conducted
by Deputy Coroner Harry Ryder and
District Attorney Allan P. Lindsay,
efforts were made to find some rea
son for Ballinger's suicide.
Deborah Cleveland, who found
Ballinger's body, said that he
"seemed quite cheerful" when she
saw him Tuesday about 9:30 p.m. It
was estimated that Ballinger had
died about midnight Tuesday.
Miguel A. Prado, Stanford in
structor, said Ballinger had been try
ing to find work at Permanente and
in San Francisco ship yards. He
said Ballinger was attempting to sell
his car to pay a tuition note which
he owed the University.
Prado said Ballinger had told him
about six weeks ago that "ho had
taken the gun and put it against his
body and pulled the trigger nine
times, but the gun didn't go off."

Scientific evidence proving that
Loighton Ballinger, Stanford assist
ant who was found dead on Feb. 18
in his Palo Alto apartment, used a
telephone receiver to discharge his
defective .22 caliber target pistol into
himself, Friday caused a coroner's
jury to return a verdict of "death
by self-inflicted gunshot wounds."
The jury, composed of 11 men,
deliberated less than a half hour
before bringing in the verdict of
suicide. The coroner's inquest was
held at Roller and Hapgood, funeral
directors, in Palo Alto.
After almost two hours of testi
mony from principals in the case,
Robert Drexel, special investigator
for the District Attorney's office,
demonstrated how Ballinger had
killed himself.
First, Drexel said, he had "posi
tively determined" that the bullet
which killed Ballinger was fired from
the .22 caliber target pistol found
under the Stanford assistant's body.
This, he said, was done by firing
another bullet from the same gun
and comparing the riflings on that
bullet with the markings on the
bullet extracted from Bellinger's
body.
TRIGGER SPRING GONE
In attempting to fire this test
bullet, Drevel said, he noticed that
the trigger spring had been extracted
from the gun so that it would not
fire unless the hammer were struck
with some blunt instrument.
An examination of the telephone
cradle which Ballinger held tightly
in his right hand showed a chipped
notch which fitted the hammer of the
revolver.
In reconstructing the suicide,
Drexel demonstrated how Ballinger
had evidently struck the hammer of
the revolver with the telephone
cradle to fire the cartridge which
