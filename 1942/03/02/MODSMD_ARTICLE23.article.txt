# San Quentin Debating Shows Prisoners Are Alive to Issues
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Stanford debaters went to prison yesterday and came hack with the
realization that on the "inside" there are some brilliant people—people
who prove that it is a "small" world and sometimes not a very pleasant one.
The Farm was facing professional competition in their pro-and-con
ning on the question of world federation as the basis for a post-war peace

settlement. A former district attor
ney, a former minister, and a
former actor made up the San
Quentin debate team that won the
decision of the 700-man inmate au
dience over Farm speakers Jim
Frolik, Shorty Grannis, and Larry
Werner.
DEBATE RECORDED
While the arguments, recorded at
2 yesterday afternoon for rebroad
casting last night over station KSFO,
were being discussed, we looked at
the audience.
Some of those faces had very ob
viously been "around." Others
might have been your German pro
fessor or my uncle. But. all of them
showed more intense interest in the

question and its real meaning than
any other debate audience that Stan
ford has faced this year.
Prison industries—the jute mills,
stretehei factories, and many others,
are rapidly being geared to the war
efforts, ar'H prison minds certainly
aren't far behind.
GRANNIS PERFORMS
Humor, entering as a special per
formance of Shorty Grannis' Roose
i veltian characterization, received an
overwhelming reception from the
men of San Quentin. Probably the
inmates were left happier by the
occasion than Stanford. A few ex
cursions to such places as the death
cell took all of the thrill out of the
"lark."
The Stanford debate was a promi-
I nent part in an education program
I of rehabilitating inmates being un
; dertaken by prison officials, but it is
hard to determine whether the men
from the "outside" didn't learn
more looking "in," than those on the
inside who got another look at the
outside from which they are sepa
rated.
WILLOWS, March 1 (UP).—Fire
of undetermined origin destroyed
the main building of the Willows

WILLOWS, March 1 (UP).—Fire
of undetermined origin destroyed
the main building of the Willows
High School today, inflicting dam
| age estimated at about $(50,000.
Stanford debaters went to prison yesterday and came hack with the
realization that on the "inside" there are some brilliant people—people
who prove that it is a "small" world and sometimes not a very pleasant one.
The Farm was facing professional competition in their pro-and-con
ning on the question of world federation as the basis for a post-war peace

settlement. A former district attor
ney, a former minister, and a
former actor made up the San
Quentin debate team that won the
decision of the 700-man inmate au
dience over Farm speakers Jim
Frolik, Shorty Grannis, and Larry
Werner.
DEBATE RECORDED
While the arguments, recorded at
2 yesterday afternoon for rebroad
casting last night over station KSFO,
were being discussed, we looked at
the audience.
Some of those faces had very ob
viously been "around." Others
might have been your German pro
fessor or my uncle. But. all of them
showed more intense interest in the

question and its real meaning than
any other debate audience that Stan
ford has faced this year.
Prison industries—the jute mills,
stretehei factories, and many others,
are rapidly being geared to the war
efforts, ar'H prison minds certainly
aren't far behind.
