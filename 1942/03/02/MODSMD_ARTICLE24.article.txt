# Conference Delegates Decide Religion Can Help Education
## Mumford Finds America Making Rome's Mistake 
### 
Fnding in American "super-Roman" civilization
elements of self-destruction, Lewis Mumford. noted
sociologist and author, told a limited audience Satur
day night that he finds hope fur national survival only
in an extensive scraping off <:f those elementsâ€”the
"social barnacles."
Mr. Mumford was speaking before a group of dele-

gates to the religious conference and
to members of the Stanford faculty
who met for dinner in the Faculty
Clubhouse. His subject was "The
Spiritual Reconstruction of Our
Culture."
AMERICA LIKE ROME
In using the term "super-Roman"
Mr. Mumford was not making an iso
lated reference. On the contrary,
he described symptoms in America
today which he finds striking in
their parallel to conditions in Rome
just after Augustus and just before
the decline.
"We have concentrated on master
ing our environment and, at the
moment of achievement, we find
among ourselves insecurity, fear and
disharmony," said the noted author.
"Now we are challenged . . . ," he
continued. "Do we have enough
strength to beat it back? The only
way in which a challenge such as
this can be overcome is by a process
of creative effort as strong on the
part of the good as the power which
Hitler commands on the part of the
bad. Do we have this strength?"
FALTERING STEPS
Mr. Mumford's answer to his own
question was in the negative. He
pointed to the faltering steps of
Americans in the past ten years.
"We have lost the power of cre
ating," he lamented. "We have been
seeking ease."
Because Mr. Mumford sees in
American weakness the result of
an overuse of technology, he pre
scribes simplification of life for the
ailing civilization. In the process of
simplification, the individual will
find principles and a philosophy in
which he believes.
LACK OF FAITH
This act of belief, of faith, Mr.
Mumford said, is the great American
lack. A belief, he contended, is
something the individual will die
for, and most Americans lack that
type of belief while their current
challengers, Germans and Japanese,
have been raised on just such strong
beliefs.
A mass trend toward this simpli
fication is now possible, Mr. Mum
ford continued, and deprivation of
the radio, refrigerator, and auto
mobile can help the American people
in their regeneration. The original
impulse will still rest, however,
within the individual.
Mr. John W. Dodds, professor of
English, introduced the spe; (Ver.
Mr. Mumford will again speak on
the campus tomorrow night.
