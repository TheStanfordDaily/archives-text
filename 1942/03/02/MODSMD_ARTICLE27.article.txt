# Views on Religion Aired By Professors al Meet
## 
### 
Delegates to the Stanford Conference on "Religion
in Higher Education" came to the apparent, though
implicit, conclusion that religion has a definite place
in and a salutory effect on higher education. The Con
ference ended yesterday.
Dr. James Luther Adams, professor of religion at
the Meadvilic Theological Seminary and at the Uni-

► versity of Chicago, led off the Con
ference Friday morning with his
opening address in which he stated
that religion was an instrument of
| democracy. Following establishment
of this point, he concluded that the
1 spiritual influence certainly would
j have a place in education inasmuch
as that endeavor is closely associated
with democracy.
NOT COMPATIBLE
"Not all forms of religion are com
patible with higher education," he
added. "Religion must sa"e higher
education from the natural tendency
to polytheism."
j In a forum on fnc educational cx
! pcrience of religious societies, listen
] ers heard Cyril Kavanagh, S.J., of
Santa Clara, declare that the Jesuits
have educated men and women for
four centuries on the principle that
religion is the only basis for a higher
education. The Mormon principle, as
expressed by Daryl Chase of the
Tucson Institute of Religion, is based
on a separation of religious and sec
ular education. Arnold Nash, speak
ing on Anglican education expe
rience, said that the first difficulty in
education is "to find Christian cate
gories for our thought."
ADDRESS IS FORENSIC
Friday evening Dr. Adams and Dr.
Alvin Eurich participated in a forum
on new conceptions of the univer
sity. Designed as a forum, the ad
dresses became quite forensic as
Dr. Adams challenged the educa
tional validity of institutions such
as Stephens and Bennington which
Dr. Eurich, who spoke first, had
favorably described. Dr. Adams was
describing the University of Chicago
as it functions under President
Hutchins.
In closing the Conference Sunday
morning, Dr. Adams asserted that
idealistic Christianity, as opposed to
a realistic interpretation, is driving
young people to the likes of Marx
ism which attracts them with its
realism.

The California Funeral Directors As
sociation was told today that metal
caskets will be unobtainable for the
duration of the war.
