## Phi Psis Lead League 3; May Win Title After All Pfyl Not Registered in University; Firehouse Must Forfeit All Games 
### 
The Firehouse Has been dropped from the mural basketball champion
ship fight for using an illegal man threughout the season, it was revealed
Saturday afternoon l».y Red dolman, intramural manager.
"Due to the fart that Frank I'fyl is not registered in school this quarter,
the Firehouse will have to forfeit all its games," dolman stated. This
fact was brought to Holman's atten-^

lion Saturday and confirmed later
that evening when Holman checked
with the Firehouse. The announce
ment that the Firehouse has been
eliminated moves the Phi Psis, last
year's champions, into the first spot
in League 3.
DEFEATED Pdl PSIS
In a three-way play-ofl between
the Phi Psis, El Capitan, and the
Firehouse for first place in the
league, the Blazechasers defeated the
Phi Psis in the final play-off and
then downed El Capitan, who had
received the bye, in the deciding
game last Wednesday night.
"This moves the Phi Psis into first
place because they are the only
team in the league that has not been
defeated. It is just as if the Fire
house had not played," Holman said.
El Capitan dropped its game to the
Phi Psis but beat the Firehouse in
the first game to tie the league first
spot. With the Firehouse eliminated
this shoves the Phi Psis from third
place in the league to first, El Capi
tan stays in second place, the Dekes
place third, and the Phi Kaps hold
fourth spot.
SHORT OF MEN
Although Pl'yl is nol registered in
school this quarter, he is on cam
pus making up incompletes. Frank's
brother, Monte, said "We're short of
men and have been forced to use the
same five men throughout the sea
son, and we didn't want to miss out
on the fun of mural games."
Holman said the Firehouse boys
have been "pretty good sports about
it," and added that the Phi Psis
have taken a very sportsmanlike at
titude stating at first that should
they win the championship again
they would not accept the cup.
"At first we felt that wouldn't
quite be the way to win," Fred Al
bright, Phi Psi athletic manager,
said, "but when the boys had talked
it over, they decided it would be all
right to take the cup, should we
win."
CdANCES GOOD
The chances of the Phi Psis re
peating last year's win are pretty
good, because they are using the
same team this year. Their real
competition may come from the

last week. The Delts, last year's
runners-up, were handicapped by
sickness, however.

house had not played," Holman said.
El Capitan dropped its game to the
Phi Psis but beat the Firehouse in
the first game to tie the league first
spot. With the Firehouse eliminated
this shoves the Phi Psis from third
place in the league to first, El Capi
tan stays in second place, the Dekes
place third, and the Phi Kaps hold
fourth spot.
SHORT OF MEN
Although Pl'yl is nol registered in
school this quarter, he is on cam
pus making up incompletes. Frank's
brother, Monte, said "We're short of
men and have been forced to use the
same five men throughout the sea
son, and we didn't want to miss out
on the fun of mural games."
Holman said the Firehouse boys
have been "pretty good sports about
it," and added that the Phi Psis
have taken a very sportsmanlike at
titude stating at first that should
they win the championship again
they would not accept the cup.
"At first we felt that wouldn't
quite be the way to win," Fred Al
bright, Phi Psi athletic manager,
said, "but when the boys had talked
it over, they decided it would be all
right to take the cup, should we
win."
CdANCES GOOD
The chances of the Phi Psis re
peating last year's win are pretty
good, because they are using the
same team this year. Their real
competition may come from the
Alpha Delts, who defeated the Dolts
last week. The Delts, last year's
runners-up, were handicapped by
sickness, however.
The quarter-finals for the cham
pionship crown begin tonight at 7
in the Pavilion when the Phi Psis
take on Encina 3E, winners of

League I and the Encina champion
ship.
The semi-finals will be played
Thursday, and the finals will take
place next Monday.
