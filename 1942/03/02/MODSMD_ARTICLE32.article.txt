## 
### 
Slashing out a total of 18 hits,
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity base
ball team closed the practice season
with a 15-9 victory over the Rich
mond Produce Co., last Saturday in
the Sunken Diamond.
Ted Doe, making his first start as
a varsity pitcher, got credit for the
win. He went the first four innings
before being replaced by Bill Harms,
followed by Don Pendergrass and
Harry Dyck.
SECOND MINUS HITS
The Indians failed to»get any runs
in the second or sixth innings, and
it was in the second inning that they
failed to gather any hits. Ted Nell
and Ray "Duke" Hammett started
the fireworks by rapping out triples
in the first inning. Nell got another
triple in the eighth frame.
Hammett was the big hitter for
the day, getting four for five, and
running his hitting streak to five
consecutive games. In the eighth he
got the longest hit of the game, but
since there was no wind, it was good
for only a double. The ball went
deep into left field and forced the
outfield up on the slope. It would
have been a homer in any other ball
park.
NELL GETS THREE
Nell got three for four, including
two triples. Leland Scott continued
his hitting streak, getting three for
six. Scott, formerly a right-hander,
has switched to the left and has been
hitting the ball with new vigor.
Ward walked up, gathered two for
five, and Clark Graham got two for
four.
Leading 9-2 going into the sixth,
the Cardinals relaxed, giving up five
runs on four hits. The infield be
came overanxious, booting several
easy chances.
Richmond got their nine runs on
nine hits, making a total of 27 hits
and 24 runs for both sides, giving
scorekeepers Jack Parsons and P.
Boothe little opportunity to bask in
the sun.

Leading 9-2 going into the sixth,
the Cardinals relaxed, giving up five
runs on four hits. The infield be
came overanxious, booting several
easy chances.
Richmond got their nine runs on
nine hits, making a total of 27 hits
and 24 runs for both sides, giving
scorekeepers Jack Parsons and P.
Boothe little opportunity to bask in
the sun.
Slashing out a total of 18 hits,
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity base
ball team closed the practice season
with a 15-9 victory over the Rich
mond Produce Co., last Saturday in
the Sunken Diamond.
Ted Doe, making his first start as
a varsity pitcher, got credit for the
win. He went the first four innings
before being replaced by Bill Harms,
followed by Don Pendergrass and
Harry Dyck.
SECOND MINUS HITS
The Indians failed to»get any runs
in the second or sixth innings, and
it was in the second inning that they
failed to gather any hits. Ted Nell
and Ray "Duke" Hammett started
the fireworks by rapping out triples
in the first inning. Nell got another
triple in the eighth frame.
Hammett was the big hitter for
the day, getting four for five, and
running his hitting streak to five
consecutive games. In the eighth he
got the longest hit of the game, but
since there was no wind, it was good
for only a double. The ball went
deep into left field and forced the
outfield up on the slope. It would
have been a homer in any other ball
park.
NELL GETS THREE
Nell got three for four, including
two triples. Leland Scott continued
his hitting streak, getting three for
six. Scott, formerly a right-hander,
has switched to the left and has been
hitting the ball with new vigor.
Ward walked up, gathered two for
five, and Clark Graham got two for
four.
Leading 9-2 going into the sixth,
the Cardinals relaxed, giving up five

and 24 runs for both sides, giving
scorekeepers Jack Parsons and P.
