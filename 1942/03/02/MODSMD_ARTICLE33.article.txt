Larry Dee, number two man on
j the Farm tenis ladder, scored a sur-
J prise upset over national top-rank
ing Ted Schroeder to highlight the
Card varsity's last intra-squad match
before the regular season starts next
| Saturday.
Although Dee showed definite su
periority in his straight set, 6-0, 6-4,
j win over Schroeder, Schroeder will
| continue to play number one position
| until Dee proves himself able to win
| consistently over him, according to
Coach Lamb.

eke out a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over the
Hopper-Wilson duo. The Farm num
ber one doubles squad of Dee and
Wade split with the Neale-Roberts
combination, each having a set to
j their credit when the match was
j called.
