# LAST GAME FOR FIREHOUSE
## 
### 

THE FIREHOUSE intramural team won this game Thursday night,
but the ineligibility of Frank Pfyl (right background in picture) can
celled this and other Firehouse wins. In this bit of action George
Kaufman of the Fireboys takes the ball down the sidelines as Cap
Pitehford of El Capitan does his best to interfere. The man at the
left is Nick Bills of the Capitan squad.
