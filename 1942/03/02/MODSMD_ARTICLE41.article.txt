# Farm's Skyscrapers Rival 'Salad Bowl' for Interest
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
ABOARD THE DAYLIGHT EN
ROUTE TO PALO ALTO, March 1.
— While the loudspeaker on this I
train drones, "We're now passing j
through the Salad Bowl of America," j
most of the customers in this club
car are exclaiming, "Boy, are they
tall!" and "How does that boy man
age to get through the doors?"
They were of course speaking of
Stanford's varsity basketball team, |
catching a snack en route home from
Los Angeles and a doubleheader j
win over Southern California.
Before we got as far as the "Salad
Bowl'' you could see long waves j
rolling toward a sandy beach just 1
outside Santa Barbara.
OLLIE WANTS TO SURF
Fred Oliver, sitting at a table with
Bill Cowden, Howie Dallmar, and
Don Burness, could hardly resist the
tantalizing surf. He wanted to do a j
little surf boarding, and the boys had ;
trouble holding him back.
Some unknown gagman sent Dall
mar a 3.2 milkshake, but Howie
would have none of it. The waiter is
still looking for the-guy that ordered
it.
Noticed squad member Jack Dana
and Stanford freshwoman Pate Tate
a-teting as the train rolled along.
Besides the team and us, she was
one of the few present last night and
Friday to cheer for the Redskins,
j NO PRACTICE TODAY
As a reward for the week-end's
effort, Coach Everett Dean said there
! would be no practice Monday and
i possibly one more practice would
be skipped this week.
There's still some talk about the
j Trojans being a one-ball outfit. Fri
day night the ball bounced off the
! Shrine Stage and into the wings. We
| waited for the Trojan manager to
| heave another bail onto the court,

| but no soap. Jerry Nemer and John
Old, officials, took to the wings and
finally found the ball after a frantic
J three-minute search.
The team got a great kick out of
the Trojan rooters, who tried their
best to unnerve the Redskins with
j various and sundry verbal threats.
They catcalled to Eddie Voss to
"wise up" and "don't tie up," but
| Eddie took it all and proceeded to
j score two beautiful set-ups on long,
j downeourt passes.
(Why do they allow babies on this
| train? There's one in the car, and
it's driving everybody crazy. They
| oughta have a special car for babies.
Man oh man, what comfort and re
laxation amid the lungfest!)
All mankind, according to an eth
nologist, can be divided into three
kinds—woolly hair, wavy hair, and
straight hair.

ABOARD THE DAYLIGHT EN
ROUTE TO PALO ALTO, March 1.
— While the loudspeaker on this I
train drones, "We're now passing j
through the Salad Bowl of America," j
most of the customers in this club
car are exclaiming, "Boy, are they
tall!" and "How does that boy man
age to get through the doors?"
They were of course speaking of
Stanford's varsity basketball team, |
catching a snack en route home from
Los Angeles and a doubleheader j
win over Southern California.
Before we got as far as the "Salad
Bowl'' you could see long waves j
rolling toward a sandy beach just 1
outside Santa Barbara.
OLLIE WANTS TO SURF
Fred Oliver, sitting at a table with
Bill Cowden, Howie Dallmar, and
Don Burness, could hardly resist the
tantalizing surf. He wanted to do a j
little surf boarding, and the boys had ;
trouble holding him back.
Some unknown gagman sent Dall
mar a 3.2 milkshake, but Howie
would have none of it. The waiter is
still looking for the-guy that ordered
it.
Noticed squad member Jack Dana
and Stanford freshwoman Pate Tate
a-teting as the train rolled along.
Besides the team and us, she was
one of the few present last night and
Friday to cheer for the Redskins,
j NO PRACTICE TODAY
As a reward for the week-end's
effort, Coach Everett Dean said there
! would be no practice Monday and
i possibly one more practice would
be skipped this week.
There's still some talk about the
j Trojans being a one-ball outfit. Fri
day night the ball bounced off the
! Shrine Stage and into the wings. We
| waited for the Trojan manager to
| heave another bail onto the court,

| but no soap. Jerry Nemer and John
Old, officials, took to the wings and
finally found the ball after a frantic
J three-minute search.
The team got a great kick out of
the Trojan rooters, who tried their
best to unnerve the Redskins with
j various and sundry verbal threats.
