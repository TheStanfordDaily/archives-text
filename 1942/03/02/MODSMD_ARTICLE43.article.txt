# "Buy a Bond Today"
## 
### 
LAST week a student living group, Lagunita
Court, inaugurated a campus drive to pur
chase defense bonds and donate them to the
University. The purpose was to contribute more
positive aid to the war effort and at the same
time to help the University during expected
trying war times.
The idea was immediately picked up by Ex
Committee, which authorized a Stanford De
fense Bond Drive. Because of the nature of par
ticipation in such a drive, however, definite
leadership cannot be affixed. Participation will
be almost entirely voluntary, and whatever com
petition arises during the drive will be due
mostly to interest of individual competing or
ganizations. Their interest must of necessity be
the principal stimulus, and their interest will
evidence their degrees of consecration to the
victory effort.
Since the surrender of Singapore and the
dark days ahead which that debacle seemed to
presage, the role of the United Nations has, as
a matter of fact, been a bright one in many
instances. While the enemy has spread farther
over the southern Pacific and made its first
threat to India and to the Calcutta approach to
China, Allied forces have vindicated themselves
on almost every front. It is reassuring to real
ize that United States forces are accomplishing
these victories on the battlefronts, victories first
at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and last over
lava. There has come the first grey light into
the early dawn of hope that perhaps the United
Nations are turning the Battle of the Pacific from
a defeat into a victory. If this develops, it is
principally due to American men and American
equipment.
It is American equipment, superior American
fighting planes and bombers and gunsights,
which is doing the trick.
Upon the support of the people at home de
pends the extent to which such equipment
shall continue to be manufactured and sent to
the men on the fronts—on the land, in the air,
on the sea. Purchasing defense bonds is one
way to assure victory.
The many campus living and eating groups
which find they have a little extra cash in the
treasury or in separate pocketbooks at tonight's
house, club, and hall meetings might easily en
tertain a motion to contribute a defense bond
to the University. Or, they can always make out
the bond in the name of their own organization.
If they choose to donate the bond to the Uni
versity, as one Lagunita casa did last week, they
may register it directly in the name of Stanford
University by purchasing a Defense Series F
bond at any bank.
Organizations voting at tonight's meetings to
buy defense bonds are urged to notify The Daily
as soon as possible. Their names will be added
to the growing list of Stanford's working pa
triots.

China, Allied forces have vindicated themselves
on almost every front. It is reassuring to real
ize that United States forces are accomplishing
these victories on the battlefronts, victories first
at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and last over
lava. There has come the first grey light into
the early dawn of hope that perhaps the United
Nations are turning the Battle of the Pacific from
a defeat into a victory. If this develops, it is
principally due to American men and American
equipment.
It is American equipment, superior American
fighting planes and bombers and gunsights,
which is doing the trick.
Upon the support of the people at home de
pends the extent to which such equipment
shall continue to be manufactured and sent to
the men on the fronts—on the land, in the air,
on the sea. Purchasing defense bonds is one
way to assure victory.
The many campus living and eating groups
which find they have a little extra cash in the
treasury or in separate pocketbooks at tonight's
house, club, and hall meetings might easily en
tertain a motion to contribute a defense bond
to the University. Or, they can always make out
the bond in the name of their own organization.
If they choose to donate the bond to the Uni
versity, as one Lagunita casa did last week, they
may register it directly in the name of Stanford
University by purchasing a Defense Series F
bond at any bank.
Organizations voting at tonight's meetings to
buy defense bonds are urged to notify The Daily
as soon as possible. Their names will be added
to the growing list of Stanford's working pa
triots.
LAST week a student living group, Lagunita
Court, inaugurated a campus drive to pur
chase defense bonds and donate them to the
University. The purpose was to contribute more
positive aid to the war effort and at the same
time to help the University during expected
trying war times.
The idea was immediately picked up by Ex
Committee, which authorized a Stanford De
fense Bond Drive. Because of the nature of par
ticipation in such a drive, however, definite
leadership cannot be affixed. Participation will
be almost entirely voluntary, and whatever com
petition arises during the drive will be due
mostly to interest of individual competing or
ganizations. Their interest must of necessity be
the principal stimulus, and their interest will
evidence their degrees of consecration to the
victory effort.
Since the surrender of Singapore and the
dark days ahead which that debacle seemed to
presage, the role of the United Nations has, as
a matter of fact, been a bright one in many
instances. While the enemy has spread farther
over the southern Pacific and made its first
threat to India and to the Calcutta approach to
China, Allied forces have vindicated themselves
on almost every front. It is reassuring to real
