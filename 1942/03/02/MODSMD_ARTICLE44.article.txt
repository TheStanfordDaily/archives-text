# Memo to the Band
## 
### 
LAST Thursday Jay Ford, band manager, told
the campus through a Daily story that the
band had been absent at basketball games be
cause of the lack of interest on the part of stu
dent musicians gualified to play in it.
This brings the problem down to whether the
fault lies with the band's officers for not organiz
ing the band properly or with former and po
tential band members for not voluntarily doing
their part to keep it going.
Although the difficulties of keeping the band
together after football season are admittedly
great, it does not seem unreasonable to expect
the men responsible for the band to contact for
mer members of the band and through their own
efforts organize a large enough band to play at
basketball games.
In this respect it might be pointed out that
for basketball games a small band is acceptable,
even preferable to the larger organization
needed for football game displays.
All this is in the way of crying over spilt milk,
as the basketball season is virtually over, there
being only the Cal series left on the Indians'
league schedule. However, in beating U.S.C.
twice over the week-end, Everett Dean's cagers
have clinched the Southern Division title and
the right to meet Oregon State for the Coast
championship March 14, 15, and 17. That play
off series will be played in Stanford's Pavilion.
The band officers have a chance to show
between now and March 14 whether they are
capable of carrying out their duties properly
and organizing a band which can furnish pep
music at this all-important series.—Vic Minahan
All organizafions and living qroups, includ
ing halls, sororities and fraternities, are urged
to inform The Daily of election of new offi
cers by calling P. A. 22166.
