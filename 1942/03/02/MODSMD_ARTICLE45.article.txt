### AMIE REICHERT 
cry is, "Up for Java!"
As thousands of enemy soldiers streamed ashore
yesterday on the northern coastline of the strategic
Dutch island, all the length of the country rang with
the cry.
It's Up for Java.
But for how long? Ask Tojo. Ask Hirohito. Ask
Yamamoto. Ask Watanabe. Don't ask me.
Helfrich and Wavell and 1 have our fingers crossed.
Because it is only a matter of time.
Things still look bad in the Far East. They have
looked bad for so long now that radio commentators
can't even give the news with a smile in their voices
any more. Even William Winter sounds a little tired
lately but that is probably because turning the dark
clouds inside out is such wearying work.
A great naval battle preceded the landing of the
first Japanese invasion bridgeheads yesterday. It was
the third large sea conflict of the war in the Pacific
within the past month or so.
A major enemy invasion fleet of 40 transports pro
tected by planes and escorted by 20 surface warships
and additional submarines was encountered by warcraft
and warplanes of the United Nations and a tremendous
week-end-long battle took place. The United Nations'
report claimed the sinking of 32 of the enemy ships.
The Japanese claimed, however, that the attack
ing unit of the United Nations fleet has been scattered
and is no longer able to function as a fighting unit.
Tokyo also claimed sinking or damaging of 19 United
Nations ships.

'JpHESE reports, taken singly or together, still do
not give a clear picture of what has happened
and what is now happening in the current battle for
the last island of the Dutch Indies. What we do know
is that a considerable Japanese invasion force landed,
established three bridgeheads on the northern coast of
Java, and is advancing with considerable losses, but
nevertheless advancing relentlessly.
As for the United Nations fleet in those waters,
there is no indication that it has been cut off from the
Soerabaja base, but it has undoubtedly suffered crip
pling blows.
This battle is a last stand for the Dutch. Java is the
last of their islands, and now, with their backs to the
wall, they will abandon their scorched-earth-and
retreat policy because there is no place to retreat to
unless they yield their island completely.
And it does not look as though they will do that.
The Dutch are a courageous and determined people,
and they are also fierce in warfare. Their leaders,
Helfrich, Van Mook and the others, have decided that
when the coastal regions must be yielded they will fall
back to positions behind the range of volcanic moun
tains which runs the length of the island, and there
they will stand and fight.
Their positions will be something like Mac Arthur's
on Bataan peninsula. Like him, they will need rein
forcements. "It is only a question of hundreds more
planes and a few tens of thousands of men," said Van
Mook last week.
Whether that question is too big a one for the
United Nations to answer in time to make up the dif
ference, we shall know in a few days.
Meanwhile, it's Up for Java.

'JpHESE reports, taken singly or together, still do
not give a clear picture of what has happened
and what is now happening in the current battle for
the last island of the Dutch Indies. What we do know
is that a considerable Japanese invasion force landed,
established three bridgeheads on the northern coast of
Java, and is advancing with considerable losses, but
nevertheless advancing relentlessly.
As for the United Nations fleet in those waters,
there is no indication that it has been cut off from the
Soerabaja base, but it has undoubtedly suffered crip
pling blows.
This battle is a last stand for the Dutch. Java is the
last of their islands, and now, with their backs to the
wall, they will abandon their scorched-earth-and
retreat policy because there is no place to retreat to
unless they yield their island completely.
And it does not look as though they will do that.
The Dutch are a courageous and determined people,
and they are also fierce in warfare. Their leaders,
Helfrich, Van Mook and the others, have decided that
when the coastal regions must be yielded they will fall
back to positions behind the range of volcanic moun
tains which runs the length of the island, and there
they will stand and fight.
Their positions will be something like Mac Arthur's
on Bataan peninsula. Like him, they will need rein
forcements. "It is only a question of hundreds more
planes and a few tens of thousands of men," said Van
Mook last week.
Whether that question is too big a one for the
United Nations to answer in time to make up the dif
ference, we shall know in a few days.
Meanwhile, it's Up for Java.
cry is, "Up for Java!"
As thousands of enemy soldiers streamed ashore
yesterday on the northern coastline of the strategic
Dutch island, all the length of the country rang with
the cry.
It's Up for Java.
But for how long? Ask Tojo. Ask Hirohito. Ask
Yamamoto. Ask Watanabe. Don't ask me.
Helfrich and Wavell and 1 have our fingers crossed.
Because it is only a matter of time.
Things still look bad in the Far East. They have
looked bad for so long now that radio commentators
can't even give the news with a smile in their voices
any more. Even William Winter sounds a little tired
lately but that is probably because turning the dark
clouds inside out is such wearying work.
A great naval battle preceded the landing of the
first Japanese invasion bridgeheads yesterday. It was
the third large sea conflict of the war in the Pacific
within the past month or so.
A major enemy invasion fleet of 40 transports pro
tected by planes and escorted by 20 surface warships
and additional submarines was encountered by warcraft
and warplanes of the United Nations and a tremendous
week-end-long battle took place. The United Nations'
report claimed the sinking of 32 of the enemy ships.
The Japanese claimed, however, that the attack
ing unit of the United Nations fleet has been scattered
and is no longer able to function as a fighting unit.
Tokyo also claimed sinking or damaging of 19 United
Nations ships.
