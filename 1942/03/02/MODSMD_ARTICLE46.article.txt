evening gowns present a serious and
embarrassing problem to him (any male dancing
partner), and he's apt to skid seriously on a satin
dress."
This, readers, is but one of many pearls (definitely
not cultured) of wisdom to be found in "Young and
Old Have Their Idiosyncrasies When They Start Step
ping to Music" by Mildred Brown Robbins on page 3S
of Sunday's Chronicle. In case you're wondering what
"S" stands for, it means Society.
"Position," Miss Robbins says, "is everything in
life." This remarkably broad statement she soon quali
fies by wondering, "how do you look out on a dance
floor?"' Perhaps I can answer that by saying you look
a lot worse than if you're out at a bar.
Miss Robbins has four pictures accompanying her
article. Bland, jovial Joseph Chamberlain (whoever he
is) is described, while dancing with a blonde, as "using
his derriere for ballast." If anybody said that about
me, blonde or no blonde, in the Chronicle or out, I'd
x'each for the nearest horse whip.
There are three major classes of dancers (male) ac
cording to Miss Robbins. One, the smoothie, she illus
trates by the Farm's, and the Deke's, own Jack Dickey.
"He enfolds his partner with indifference." I can't be
lieve this of any Deke. "He shuns the cuddlers and
prefers the kindred spirit." I can't believe that of any
Stanford man.
Her other two types are those who "love to dance
but don't think the music has anything to do with it,"
and the "rockers, galloppers, bouncers and pumpers."
This last type she illustrates by a young couple in "a
bodyhold that would shame an octopus."

|F MISS ROBBINS can type male dancers in the
Chronicle, I can type female dancers in The Daily.
Appended is my list:
1. The girl who learned the "correct" method and
if you don't like it you can just go count sparrows.
2. The girl who thinks that conversation is broad
ening, particularly at arm's length.
3. The girl who "never really dances but would
rather like to try."
4. The girl who says "you can dance anytime but
the bar closes at two."
5. The girl who dances as though she had been
pushed up against a hot radiator.

There are three major classes of dancers (male) ac
cording to Miss Robbins. One, the smoothie, she illus
trates by the Farm's, and the Deke's, own Jack Dickey.
"He enfolds his partner with indifference." I can't be
lieve this of any Deke. "He shuns the cuddlers and
prefers the kindred spirit." I can't believe that of any
Stanford man.
Her other two types are those who "love to dance
but don't think the music has anything to do with it,"
and the "rockers, galloppers, bouncers and pumpers."
This last type she illustrates by a young couple in "a
bodyhold that would shame an octopus."

|F MISS ROBBINS can type male dancers in the
Chronicle, I can type female dancers in The Daily.
Appended is my list:
1. The girl who learned the "correct" method and
if you don't like it you can just go count sparrows.
2. The girl who thinks that conversation is broad
ening, particularly at arm's length.
3. The girl who "never really dances but would
rather like to try."
4. The girl who says "you can dance anytime but
the bar closes at two."
5. The girl who dances as though she had been
pushed up against a hot radiator.

embarrassing problem to him (any male dancing
partner), and he's apt to skid seriously on a satin
dress."
This, readers, is but one of many pearls (definitely
not cultured) of wisdom to be found in "Young and
Old Have Their Idiosyncrasies When They Start Step
ping to Music" by Mildred Brown Robbins on page 3S
of Sunday's Chronicle. In case you're wondering what
"S" stands for, it means Society.
"Position," Miss Robbins says, "is everything in
life." This remarkably broad statement she soon quali
fies by wondering, "how do you look out on a dance
floor?"' Perhaps I can answer that by saying you look
a lot worse than if you're out at a bar.
Miss Robbins has four pictures accompanying her
article. Bland, jovial Joseph Chamberlain (whoever he
is) is described, while dancing with a blonde, as "using
his derriere for ballast." If anybody said that about
me, blonde or no blonde, in the Chronicle or out, I'd
x'each for the nearest horse whip.
