## LETHARGIC FARM? 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
After weeks of petty quibbling on the question of
having awards for women's athletics or abolishing them
entirely, the VV.A.A. Board finally decidcd to take a
poll among the freshmen and sophomore women.
(The Board decidcd that the present award system,
as stated in the A.S.S.U. Constitution, will go into
effect for the present junior and senior women. How
ever, what new decision is made will afTect the pres
ent freshmen and sophomore women, as they will be
entitled to work for these awards when juniors.)
Those favoring no awards were in the minority,
and their main argument was that it is absurd and
selfish to spend approximately $150 annually for ath
letic awards. Placing importance on receiving awards
at a time like this shows a lack of awareness of what
is really important today. Wouldn't it be far more
reasonable, and certainly in the line of duty, to dis
pense with awards, and spend the $150 toward na
> tional defense?
The complacency and short-sightedness of the cam
pus as a whole ifc not particularly flattering to this uni
| versity. So now, freshmen and sophomore women, it
| is up to you to show that this lethargic attitude is on a
j decline.
| Hopeful
