# Power, Tierney Make Love In Tropical 'Son of Fury'
## 
### 
"SON OF FURY," now playing at the Fox-Stanford Theater in Palo
Alto.
With two beautiful people on one tropical beach, the outcome is pretty
obvious. Along with waving palms and a rippling ocean, the power of love
can't be extinguished. Don't worry, it's not.

Across the world a man-hunt is
staged around the mighty figure of
Benjamin Blake, played by glamour
boy Tyrone Power. As the English
stable-boy, accused of attempting to
murder his uncle, Ty is forced to flee
his native country.
With hopes of making a fortune, he
goes on a quest for pearls in the
South Seas. And then Gene Tierney
puts in an appearance. Tierney in a
sarong is plenty easy on the eyes,
and presents serious competition for
Lamour.
In the role of a South Sea Island
maiden, she isn't required to do
much talking, so the part is made
to order for her; she hardly opens
her pretty mouth. It's much better
that way.
Ty sets her heart on fire when he
puts on the heat, and after the first
kiss his tropical girl runs away with
a giggle. But this giggle is soon
transformed into tears when Ty
departs for London, where Frances
Farmer is awaiting his return—and
so, the eternal triangle.
Again Darryl Zanuck comes forth
with a winner. The young "son of
fury" is played by Roddy McDowall.
After his spectacular performance in
"How Green Was My Valley," he
plays the part of the fiery little fel
low with a lot of zip and pep.
George Sanders in his usual excel
lence depicts the hateful uncle.
The nonsensical team of Charley
Ruggles and Charlotte Greenwood in
"The Perfect Snob" is billed as the
number two feature.—Goldman
