COLLINS REPORTS
This program, following by a week

voluntary report before Excom last
night on what Stanford students can
do to help in the work.
(See story at right for Collins'
program.)
"The is a job in which every Stan
ford student can participate," he
emphasized. "We ought to get start

tained army camps as a part of the
U.S.O. program. They are:
Tri Delt. Casa Magnolia, Gamma
Phi (twice), Theta. Oaks, Casa Gra
nada, Casa Eucalypto, and Casa
Adelfa.
WOMEN ORGANIZED
"The women students are already
organized," Irma Jean Hannibal
said, "but now the main problem is
to get the men working."

Dick Driscoll and Jim McKellar.
