# Tennis Queens Like White Shirtmakers
## 
### 
Do you want to be the queen of
the tennis courts or the dud?
Splashy prints or scanty play suits
may look simply darling in shop
windows but, according to tennis
players who know what they are
talking about, you'll be a dud if you
wear them on a tennis court.
Famous queens of the court from
Suzanne Lenglen down to Alice
Marble have yet to be seen on the
court in some of the creations that
city stores call tennis outfits. The
most popular and most accepted
style of tennis dress is the white
pleated shirtmaker with roomy
sleeves. Every tournament player
has a number of these which are
always kept carefully washed and
ironed.
