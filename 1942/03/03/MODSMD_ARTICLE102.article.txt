# Only Hats Go Wild As Styles Stabilize
## 
### 
Fashion demands we go the limit
in hats this spring with little ones,
big ones, of? the face ones, and those
tipped over one eye. With all styles
taking a stable wartime trend, hats
will become the only means of re
juvenating an old, or brightening a
new outfit.
Colors are "the brighter the bet
ter": bright green, red and especially
pink for spring. Black is still the
most flattering and smart for night.
It's a patriotic duty to wear a smooth
and very feminine chapeau to keep
the men happy.
