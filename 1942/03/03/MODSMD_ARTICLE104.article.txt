# Print Dirndls Longish Shorts Decorate Bikes
## 
### 
Spring weather and National De
fense, the two very much talked
übout subjects right now, have
caused a sudden popularity in bi
cycles. Along with the problem of
how to buy, borrow or steal a good
bike is the question of what to wear
while riding when you finally do get
one.
The most popular play dress for
this occasion if you want to ride into
Paly or along the campus roads is
fhe dirndl skirt. Colored checked,
striped or flowered skirts are in style
again. Shiny-smooth chintz which
always looks fresh and cheerful is
being made into dirndls more this
spring than it former!" was. If you
can't find any you like just cut up
your roommate's draperies — they
ought to make a very nice dress.
LAKE RIDES
For a good ride under the warm
sun into the hills or around Lake
Lagunita longish, tailored shorts are
the most comfortable. They're cool
and they help winter-pale legs to
acquire a tan. One idea that is dif
ferent is a pair that has two-toned
pant-legs.
One-piece play-suits with match
ing skirts are now in many of the
store windows that are previewing
spring togs. They are rather plain
and the shorts are little-boyish. The
skirts are full and unwrinklable.
If you have small hips they are
ideal, otherwise the two-piece shorts
are better.
APRON SKIRTS
Everybody bicycles to classes on
the clear, warm days and some feel
cramped and uncomfortable in their
regular straight skirts. Now it is
much better to wear full, gathered
|at-the-waist dresses which allow
ample freedom to stretch the stiffness
out of winter-lazy legs. Wear a cor
duroy skirt with your sweater
tucked inside. Bright apron wrapped
skirts are popular this spring, too.
Combine the fullness of a gathered
or a pleated skirt with the comfort
of shorts and you have culottes.
There are many varieties of them.
For more rugged trips ones made of
jean-cloth are strong and keep their
front pleats so that they don't look
like over-grown shorts by the time
that the day is over.
TENNIS SWEATERS
On windy days, long sport jack
ets to match the tailored or white
cable-stitched tennis sweater are
warm but not cumbersome.
Last of all are the cute play shoes
that go with everything. With the
dirndl dresses rope shoes look best.
Old stand-by huaraches still look
nice with most shorts and they are
! perfect if you want to get rid of a

sock mark. Prontos (which are real- |
ly just plain old moccasins) are a
perennial necessity in all wardrobes. I

while riding when you finally do get
one.
The most popular play dress for
this occasion if you want to ride into
Paly or along the campus roads is
fhe dirndl skirt. Colored checked,
striped or flowered skirts are in style
again. Shiny-smooth chintz which
always looks fresh and cheerful is

LAKE RIDES
For a good ride under the warm
sun into the hills or around Lake
Lagunita longish, tailored shorts are
the most comfortable. They're cool
and they help winter-pale legs to
acquire a tan. One idea that is dif
ferent is a pair that has two-toned
pant-legs.
One-piece play-suits with match
ing skirts are now in many of the
store windows that are previewing
spring togs. They are rather plain
and the shorts are little-boyish. The
skirts are full and unwrinklable.
If you have small hips they are
ideal, otherwise the two-piece shorts
are better.
APRON SKIRTS
Everybody bicycles to classes on
the clear, warm days and some feel
cramped and uncomfortable in their
regular straight skirts. Now it is
much better to wear full, gathered
|at-the-waist dresses which allow
ample freedom to stretch the stiffness
out of winter-lazy legs. Wear a cor
duroy skirt with your sweater
tucked inside. Bright apron wrapped
skirts are popular this spring, too.
Combine the fullness of a gathered
or a pleated skirt with the comfort
of shorts and you have culottes.
There are many varieties of them.
For more rugged trips ones made of
jean-cloth are strong and keep their
front pleats so that they don't look
like over-grown shorts by the time
that the day is over.
TENNIS SWEATERS
On windy days, long sport jack
ets to match the tailored or white
cable-stitched tennis sweater are
warm but not cumbersome.
