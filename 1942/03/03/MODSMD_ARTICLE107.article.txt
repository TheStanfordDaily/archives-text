# New Styles Turn Clock Backwards
## 
### 
Reverting to the "clinging vine"
days, nosegays are being worn as
pins or just being held in the hand.
Sometimes they are the real thing
but more often they are artificial.
More on the masculine side, the
feminine sex has borrowed blouses
styled after the old-fashioned cel
luloid collar type.
To copy the superfluous skirts of
former times, femininity has taken
the overskirt to add bright colors to
cotton prints and afford protection
for dresses. Also comes the "gold
dust" bag which eliminates the zip
perâ€”of metal now needed for na
tional defense.
