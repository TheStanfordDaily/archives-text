# Women Hate Jean-Covered 'Tramps' Male Stylist Favors Less and Less
## 'Sartorial Slobs' Is Female Word For Farm Roughs 
### 
By HELEN LIVINGSTON
Well, men, it looks like the women
of Stanford are leaping at this op
portunity to tell you what they
think of your Quad eloths. They've
heard just about enough about too
much lipstick and nail polish, silly
hats, and fussy dresses. Now they're
going to take a crack at you, and to
heck with the ratio.
An unofficial survey of the opin
ions of the ladies imbibing Cellar
cokes at ten o'clock of a bright and
cheery morning definitely shows
that, boys, you are considered a
bunch of sartorial slobs.
The women hate to disillusion you,
but they're afraid you're just going
to have to give up wearing jeans.
They don't like 'em, they never have
liked 'em," and besides, those army
men look lovely in their nice, neat
uniforms.
UNSMOOTH MEN
According to one attractive red
headed weneb, "I like the casual
clothes the men wear on Quad, but
there is such a thing as being too
casual. I mean, faded jeans just
don't have that smooth look."
"Why should we get ourselves all
fixed up when boys wander around
like a bunch of old tramps?" asked
a blonde bombshell.
"Jeans, jeans, jeans," sighed a
Delta Delta Delta sadly. "It wouldn't
be so bad if they'd only get together
with themselves. Now I ask you,
what's the point in wearing beauti
ful cashmere sweaters or imported
tweed coats with those hideous, filthy
old jeans?"
"They stink," said a sorority sister,
succinctly.
HOLES TOLERABLE
"I like casualness, not sloppiness,"
mourned an Alpha Phi. "Phooey,"
said a brash young lady from the
environs of Lagunita.
Another objection seems to be
aimed at your socks, gentlemen. The
ladies don't mind the holes—they
are as inevitable as midquarters, but
they do wish that you might clothe
your litlle pink feet in colors that
are at least an approximation of the
gay, mad reds, blues and greens you
sport in those ghastly shirts you in
sist on wearing.
The main howl, besides the old
wheeze about jeans being too small
in the nether regions and too long in
the legs, is concerned with the ap
parent lack of razors on the campus.
W HISKERS TICKLE
"Anyone would think that the men
want to look ugly. My goodness, I
think they look ghastly with those
old whiskers, and besides, they
tickle," offered a Roble maiden.
"Revolting," chimed in a repre
sentative of the Union.
So it looks like you're outvoted,
gents. The ladies apparently have
had all this on their minds for a
long time. Well, now it's printed in
black and white for all to see. And
what have you to say about it? Let
the combined efforts of the Phi Psis
and Fijis speak for you:
"We'll trade our jeans for your
baggy sweaters, our T-shirts for
your run-down, low-heeled shoes,
and we'll promise to shave if you'll
comb your hair. After all, there's
only one Veronica Lake."

gents. The ladies apparently have
had all this on their minds for a
long time. Well, now it's printed in
black and white for all to see. And
what have you to say about it? Let
the combined efforts of the Phi Psis
and Fijis speak for you:
"We'll trade our jeans for your
baggy sweaters, our T-shirts for
your run-down, low-heeled shoes,
and we'll promise to shave if you'll
comb your hair. After all, there's
only one Veronica Lake."
By HELEN LIVINGSTON
Well, men, it looks like the women
of Stanford are leaping at this op
portunity to tell you what they
think of your Quad eloths. They've
heard just about enough about too
much lipstick and nail polish, silly
hats, and fussy dresses. Now they're
going to take a crack at you, and to
heck with the ratio.
An unofficial survey of the opin
ions of the ladies imbibing Cellar
cokes at ten o'clock of a bright and
cheery morning definitely shows
that, boys, you are considered a
bunch of sartorial slobs.
The women hate to disillusion you,
but they're afraid you're just going
to have to give up wearing jeans.
They don't like 'em, they never have
liked 'em," and besides, those army
men look lovely in their nice, neat
uniforms.
UNSMOOTH MEN
According to one attractive red
headed weneb, "I like the casual
clothes the men wear on Quad, but
there is such a thing as being too
casual. I mean, faded jeans just
don't have that smooth look."
"Why should we get ourselves all
fixed up when boys wander around
like a bunch of old tramps?" asked
a blonde bombshell.
"Jeans, jeans, jeans," sighed a
Delta Delta Delta sadly. "It wouldn't
be so bad if they'd only get together
with themselves. Now I ask you,
what's the point in wearing beauti
ful cashmere sweaters or imported
tweed coats with those hideous, filthy
old jeans?"
"They stink," said a sorority sister,
succinctly.
HOLES TOLERABLE
"I like casualness, not sloppiness,"
mourned an Alpha Phi. "Phooey,"
said a brash young lady from the
environs of Lagunita.
Another objection seems to be
aimed at your socks, gentlemen. The
ladies don't mind the holes—they
are as inevitable as midquarters, but
they do wish that you might clothe
your litlle pink feet in colors that
are at least an approximation of the
gay, mad reds, blues and greens you
sport in those ghastly shirts you in
sist on wearing.
The main howl, besides the old
wheeze about jeans being too small
in the nether regions and too long in
the legs, is concerned with the ap
parent lack of razors on the campus.
W HISKERS TICKLE
"Anyone would think that the men
want to look ugly. My goodness, I
think they look ghastly with those
old whiskers, and besides, they
tickle," offered a Roble maiden.
"Revolting," chimed in a repre
sentative of the Union.
So it looks like you're outvoted,
gents. The ladies apparently have
had all this on their minds for a
long time. Well, now it's printed in
black and white for all to see. And
what have you to say about it? Let
