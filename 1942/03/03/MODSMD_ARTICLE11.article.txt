SAN FIIANCISCO, March 2 (UP).
â€”The Standard Oil tanker William
11. Berg exchanged fire with a ves
sel believed to be an enemy subma
rine late last Saturday night ap
proximately (>0 miles southeast of
the Golden Gate, Rear Admiral John
W. Grecnslade, commandant of the
12th Naval District, announced to
day.
The tanker was attacked without
warning but was not hit. Admiral
Grecnslade said.
OFF SAN MATEO COUNTY
Admiral Grecnslade said the action
took place 33 miles southeast of the
Farallon Islands, which lie nearly 30
miles west of San Francisco.
This would placc the sccne of the
gun battle a few miles off the San
Mateo coastline, probably between
Pescaderao and Half Moon Bay on a
latitude with San Jose.
U. S. Navy surface vessels and a
squadron of naval patrol bombers
rushed to the scene of the battle
with all possible speed, Greensdale
said, "but the enemy craft had dis
appeared after the initial engage
ment."
IT WAS A SUB
"The fact that patrol bombers were
I unable to locate the craft in a subse-
J quent search appeared to confirm
the presumption that she was a sub
marine," said Admiral Grecnslade.
San Francisco Bay area radio sta
tions went off the air between 11:01
j and 11:40 p.m. Saturday.
Grecnslade said the radio silence
| was ordered to prevent the enemy
from taking navigational bearings.
