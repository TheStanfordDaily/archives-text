# AIR-RAID PURSE
## 
### 
Clever designers have leaped into
the fray of these hectic days to pro
duce something called the "Air-Raid
Purse." The idea being that it is
just big enough to hold change, a
lipstick and other essentials, and
si ill small enough to slip into a
pocket when the moment comes.
The purse can be bought in saddle
leather and plain or crushed mo
rocco.
