# Pullover Sweaters Warm Tennisters
## 
### 
Even on the loveliest of spring or
summer days tennis players need
some kind of sweater or jacket to
throw on after a strenuous game.
A typical "tennis sweater" has al
ready been proven the vogue on
every college campus and is the
iVvorite of both men and women.
They are particularly nice in cold
weather because of the heavy yarn
and overlapping cable stitch.
They are usually "V"-necked and
have various color combinations on
the stripes around the neck and
sleeves. Many players like to knit
their own in between sets and are
seen carrying around their knitting
from tournament to tournament.
Alice Marble did this on the East
ern circuit last year and found it
fun to make matching socks and
sweaters.
For warmer weather, however, and
so you won't get your hair mussed
by a pullover, a colored cardigan is
just the thing. Also solid-colored,
soft woolen blazers have become a
favorite after being introduced by
the Junior Wightman Cup teams of
California.
