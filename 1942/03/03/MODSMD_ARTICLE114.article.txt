# Little Sweaters Are Symbolic Of Democratic Way
## 
### JOE MORIN 
To discuss the exciting but ex
plosive issue of women's clothes, the
analyst must first query—do women
really need clothes? Aren't gar
ments for the female of the species
little more than a redundant "gild
ing of the lily?"
All extraneous considerations
aside, hasn't this issue of "clothes
vs. no clothes" been one of the real
ly fundamental ones of our race since
Adam and Eve decided to turn over
a new leaf? To deny the validity of
this dynamic question is to ignore
the contrast between Cleopatra's lace
curtain pajamas and bullet proof bra
and grandma's 1G skirts, petticoats,
pantalettes, and various assorted
aids to modesty.
MALE IMAGINATION
The epic struggles of the human
race are reflected in centimeter by
centimeter retreat, and reactionary
advance of cloth on feminine limbs.
The strategy of these maneuvers has
inflamed the imagination of the male
world since we first demonstrated
tendencies toward all over baldness,
and will continue to do so as long as
sight remains to us.
So be it —the truth of the inalien
able right of the gentler sex to cover
themselves we hold to be self-evi
dent. It is firmly intrenched in our
dcmoci'atic "way of life" like war,
income taxes, Roosevelt, and 2:3o's.
Perhaps we can best characterize
the diminution of skirts, shirts,
sweaters, as symbols of out-grow
ing democracy. Next to a pullman
sleeper there is nothing so demo
cratic as bobby socks, brown calves,
and nice economical little sweaters
—think of the yarn you save!
DEFENSIVE TACTICS
Clothes also represent a study in
the martial technique. Have any but
the most abstract philosophers ever
considered the importance of clothes
as a study in defensive tactics? The
evolution of styles from nothing to
hoop skirts always concerned it
self with safeguarding all possible
routes of approach. Like a modern
naval architect, the fashion designer
must also attempt to reconcile maxi
mum protection with maximum mo
bility.
The two piece bathing suit repre
sents the sacrifice of protection for
speed, whereas the bustle represents
the sacrifice of the fast factor for
you know what.
And then there is the subject of
women's hats! Books have been
written, men have died horrible
deaths, and yet like the weather,
nothing seems to be done about
them. This confusion, if pressed to
its logical extreme, might well prove
fertile ground for the emergence of
completely new ideologies.
UTOPIAN QUANDRIES
When all Fascists are reconstruct
ed, Nazis corrected, Communists
persuaded, and we settle down to
the enervating monotony of Utopia,
the big decision of yet unborn gen
erations may be "hats or hairnets,"
or "whither the sunbonnet" or "is
hair really here to stay?"
The first ominous rumblings of this
devastating conflict are already ap
parent. Some outspoken souls ob
serve clandestinely that tall girls
with turbans look like pencils with
erasers on the end, or that short
girls in big floppy hats resemble
frogs under mushrooms. Harsh
though these criticisms may seem,
there still seems little excuse for
the "Century of Progress" specials
which seem constantly on the verge
of pulling their occupants into the
stratosphere.
BLACKOUT SHORTS
Now that we are at war, the entire
field of color takes on an added im
portance. Would any of you be so
careless of life and limb as to wear
i - ed in an air raid or shorts in a
blackout cellar? The trend must be
to tweeds and multicolor monstrosi
ties—girls, you gotta merge with
your surroundings!
As it is, some of your sport coats
look like camouflaged troop ships!
So in conclusion we of the "other
half" say—
"Go as far as you like with lip,
nail and eyelash adornments, ex
tract all your poor little eyebrow
hairs, if you like, cut, kink, or build
nests in your hair—but in clothes,
be democratic."
