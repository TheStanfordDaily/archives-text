# Fabric Shortage To Hit Next Year
## 
### 
While no one can prophecy what
the future holds in store for the fab
ric market, it is reasonably certain
that many of the materials now on
hand will not be available next year.
So far a shortage has actually hit
the wool and silk markets. Pure
silk garments are practically ex
tinct. As to wool, the War Produc
tion Board has set up a wool allo
cation program.
New spring fabrics have been
coming into the department stores
all over the country. Pure silks and
wools can still be had, but at a pre
mium. At this time next year they
may be extinct.
At night, after the party, one may
comfortably slip into the "mop" slip
pers fashioned after the well known
household article.
