# Shawl-Like Scarves Cuard Curls in Rain
## 
### 
Fresh from the east come those
enormous shawl-like scarves you've
probably been wondering about
when you've seen them around cam
pus. They are useful especially to
guard curls against spring rains.
These scarves are made from a
triangled square yard of pastel flan
nel, with a different-colored fringe
of heavy yarn. The girls say they're
easy to make so try a pastel blue
with white fringe.
