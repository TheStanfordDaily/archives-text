# Ratio Hangs 8 Above 1917 Low
## 
### 
Cheer up, Little Maidens who sang
so plaintively in the Gaieties that the
"ratio is one-point ni-yun." You i
don't know how lucky you are. Com- j
pared to the figures for 1918, this j
year of grace is a big one for the I
female of the species down on the |
Farm.
The fabulous "500" in 1917 had to j
struggle along with a mere 909 men; '
in other words the ratio was 1.8. Of
course that doesn't sound like much i
of a difference, but think of how at- J
tractive those .8 men might be. Yes,
I said might.
Campus opinion on the subject is
varied. "Now isn't that nice," re
marked a pretty Tri Delt over her i
lime coke, while her Sigma Nu es
cort muttered, "It's the most miser
able situation I was ever up against, j
I'm glad I'm going into the army."
PINNED WOMAN
"Sounds pretty good to me," said j
a blonde transfer, with a dirty gleam j
in her eye.
"Oh, but in my situation it doesn't j
make any difference whether the ra
tio is 1.9 or if there's only one man to
509 girls," beamed a bright-eyed
Lagunita woman, smugly lingering
her fraternity pin.
The Alpha Phi contributions were:
"Splendid," and "What?" I wasn't
i even listening." Very enlightening.
The Phi Phis put in their two
cents worth with the erudite sugges
tion of one lad that "Successful re
lations between the sexes will in
crease in proportion to the men
drafted," as he leered through his
| bifocals. "The dog is still man's best
I friend," his friend offered, as he fol
lowed the progress of a blonde into
the next room with obvious interest.

A group of Fijis wound up the
| discussion with the wise suggestion
that "It'll be tough on the boys who
I have to stay home." Very nice, fel
lows, very nice; I heard you boast
; ing about your flat feet.
And that's the situation. So don't
| worry ladies, we'll do all right. And
i even if the only men left on campus
! next year are blind as bats, with
physiques which tempt you to send
them a subscription to Physical Cul
ture Magazine, remember that there's
a shortage on nail polish, bobbie
pins, lipstick, and elastic coming up.
We don't look so good either.

Farm.
The fabulous "500" in 1917 had to j
struggle along with a mere 909 men; '
in other words the ratio was 1.8. Of
course that doesn't sound like much i
of a difference, but think of how at- J
tractive those .8 men might be. Yes,
I said might.
Campus opinion on the subject is
varied. "Now isn't that nice," re
marked a pretty Tri Delt over her i
lime coke, while her Sigma Nu es
cort muttered, "It's the most miser
able situation I was ever up against, j
I'm glad I'm going into the army."
PINNED WOMAN
"Sounds pretty good to me," said j
a blonde transfer, with a dirty gleam j
in her eye.
"Oh, but in my situation it doesn't j
make any difference whether the ra
tio is 1.9 or if there's only one man to
509 girls," beamed a bright-eyed
Lagunita woman, smugly lingering
her fraternity pin.
The Alpha Phi contributions were:
"Splendid," and "What?" I wasn't
i even listening." Very enlightening.
The Phi Phis put in their two
cents worth with the erudite sugges
tion of one lad that "Successful re
lations between the sexes will in
crease in proportion to the men
drafted," as he leered through his
| bifocals. "The dog is still man's best
I friend," his friend offered, as he fol
lowed the progress of a blonde into
the next room with obvious interest.

A group of Fijis wound up the
| discussion with the wise suggestion
that "It'll be tough on the boys who
I have to stay home." Very nice, fel
lows, very nice; I heard you boast
; ing about your flat feet.
And that's the situation. So don't
| worry ladies, we'll do all right. And
i even if the only men left on campus
! next year are blind as bats, with
physiques which tempt you to send
them a subscription to Physical Cul
ture Magazine, remember that there's
a shortage on nail polish, bobbie
pins, lipstick, and elastic coming up.
We don't look so good either.
Cheer up, Little Maidens who sang
so plaintively in the Gaieties that the
"ratio is one-point ni-yun." You i
don't know how lucky you are. Com- j
pared to the figures for 1918, this j
year of grace is a big one for the I
female of the species down on the |
