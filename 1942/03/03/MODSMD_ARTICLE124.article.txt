# Stanford War Girl Learns Red Cross Defense Work
## 
### BY KAY SCHWARTZ 
If she can smile and keep cheerful. |
if she can work hard without thought
of credit or glory, if she can have
fun doing the simple things, if she
can look to the future with hope
and faith. . . .
That's you, Stanford Woman, the
1942 War Girl, the power behind the
morale of a country at war, the stone
wall of efficiency and optimism in a
new feminine world.
In dozens of different ways, some
small, some large, all of them impor
tant Stanford women are doing their
share of creditless tasks that war
demands. They don't earn Iron
Crosses or reap publicity notices, but
they're learning about the satisfac
tion of being useful.
HOME NURSING
Many Farm women through the
Y.W.C.A. are finding the answer to
the old cry, "But what can I do?"
This organization headed by B. J.
Binney is the direct representative of
the American Red Cross on the cam
pus.
This quarter it offered a Bed Cross
course in Home Nursing to twenty
five girls. It requires twenty-two
hours of class attendance and pro
vides training for care of invalids
in the home. This course, according
to Miss Pat, Secretary of the 'Y.'
will be offered next quarter and per
haps for university credit.
Two new courses are being offered
by the 'Y' next quarter of which
Stanford women might take advan
tage. These are Red Cross Motor
Corps training and the Red Cross
Staff Assistants Course. The latter
: course is open to twenty-five volun
teers who will be eligible for ser
| vice in any department of the Red
! Cross.
The 'Y' also maintains a collecting
j agency lor old clothes and discarded
silk stockings. Farm women's re
sponse to this need has been very
gratifying, according to Miss Pat.
"We have received hundreds of items
of women's clothing, but riot one
I thing from the men on campus. Why
i couldn't they help too?"
KNITTED GARMENTS
Knitting occupies the time of many
I defense-minded Stanford girls. Yarn
j and instructions are provided by the
j 'Y,' and already boxes and boxes of
! army and navy sweaters as well as
children's clothes have been sent
I across both oceans, 'Y' workers re
ported. Just the other day, they
added, a letter came from England
acknowleding the arrival of an
afghan made by some girls at Stan
j ford.
The first-aid course being given at
the Women's gym has attracted
: campus-wide interest this quarter,
j There arc 14!) Stanford women cn-
I rolled in the courses and upon grad-

I nation they will receive certificates
as trained Red Cross first-aid work
ers. The classes will open to all who
j are interested agKui next quarter, ac
cording to !)r. Todd, Assistant Mcdi
| cal Examiner.
Stanford women are also taking an
active part in the entertainment of
service men stationed at camps in the
vicinity. Tlie U.S.O. Co-ordinating
Committee headed by Ann Bossinger
and Virginia Dean have charge of
j the arrangements for any such Tunc-
I tions on campus. Eight women's liv
ing groups have already entertained
at suppers and dances for men in the
service, the committee reported.
SECRETARIAL COURSES
In a world where women are rap
idly assuming the roles once played
by men, the college girl of yesterday
j who came to school to find a suit
| able husband is a museum piece,
j The Farm co-eds' answer to this
problem is found in their rush to
register for the new typing and
I shorthand courses.
Thirty-eight women are taking
typing this quarter and fifty-nine
j are registered in the shorthand
classes. The lack of typewriters pre
, vents this number from soaring even
higher, reported Mrs. Carpenter, in-
I structor.
Both advanced and beginning
shorthand and typing will be given
next quarter and a course in secre
tarial accounting will be added. The
proof of the enthusiasm for these
courses is shown by the number of
students who have already signed
up for next quarter.
So that's the Stanford co-cd. Sure,
| she can smile. She's young, she's
j 1942, she's a woman with a job to do.
If she can smile and keep cheerful. |
if she can work hard without thought
of credit or glory, if she can have
fun doing the simple things, if she

Thirty-eight women are taking

So that's the Stanford co-cd. Sure,

j 1942, she's a woman with a job to do.
If she can smile and keep cheerful. |
if she can work hard without thought
of credit or glory, if she can have
fun doing the simple things, if she
can look to the future with hope
and faith. . . .
That's you, Stanford Woman, the
1942 War Girl, the power behind the
morale of a country at war, the stone
wall of efficiency and optimism in a
new feminine world.
In dozens of different ways, some
small, some large, all of them impor
tant Stanford women are doing their
share of creditless tasks that war
demands. They don't earn Iron
Crosses or reap publicity notices, but
they're learning about the satisfac
tion of being useful.
HOME NURSING
Many Farm women through the
Y.W.C.A. are finding the answer to
the old cry, "But what can I do?"
This organization headed by B. J.
Binney is the direct representative of
the American Red Cross on the cam
pus.
This quarter it offered a Bed Cross
course in Home Nursing to twenty
five girls. It requires twenty-two
hours of class attendance and pro
vides training for care of invalids
in the home. This course, according
to Miss Pat, Secretary of the 'Y.'
will be offered next quarter and per
haps for university credit.
Two new courses are being offered
by the 'Y' next quarter of which
Stanford women might take advan
tage. These are Red Cross Motor
Corps training and the Red Cross
Staff Assistants Course. The latter
: course is open to twenty-five volun
teers who will be eligible for ser
| vice in any department of the Red
! Cross.
The 'Y' also maintains a collecting
j agency lor old clothes and discarded
silk stockings. Farm women's re
sponse to this need has been very
gratifying, according to Miss Pat.
"We have received hundreds of items
of women's clothing, but riot one
I thing from the men on campus. Why
i couldn't they help too?"
KNITTED GARMENTS
Knitting occupies the time of many
I defense-minded Stanford girls. Yarn
j and instructions are provided by the
j 'Y,' and already boxes and boxes of
! army and navy sweaters as well as
children's clothes have been sent
I across both oceans, 'Y' workers re
ported. Just the other day, they
added, a letter came from England
acknowleding the arrival of an
afghan made by some girls at Stan
j ford.
The first-aid course being given at
the Women's gym has attracted
: campus-wide interest this quarter,
j There arc 14!) Stanford women cn-
I rolled in the courses and upon grad-

I nation they will receive certificates
as trained Red Cross first-aid work
ers. The classes will open to all who
j are interested agKui next quarter, ac
