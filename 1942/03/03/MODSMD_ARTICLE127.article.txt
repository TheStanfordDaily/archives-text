# Belles of 1918 Trekked to Class Minus Make-up, Plaids, .8 Men

### PEGGY BOOTHE 
Modern design makes the differ
ence!
That phrase just about sums up
the conclusions reached from a com
parison of campus fashions during
the last World war and this World
war. From the shoes to the Coiffure,
the Stanford girl of two decades ago
as pictured in the Quad bears little
resemblance to the one seen walking
around the Quad today.
The belles of 1918 trekked to class
in high black shoes with pointed toes
and heels and donned heavy dark
oxfords for more rugged wear. Those
â– were the days when the saddle shoe
and the moccasin were unknown on
the Farm, as were the red and green
shoes and other tricky footwear of
today.
LONG SKIRTS
More than anything else, skirt
lengths mark the change in fashions
from 1917 to 1942. Then, hems all
but brushed the shoe tops; now,
they hover around the knees. Skirts
are not only shorter but lighter, and
yirls are no longer weighted down
by voluminous swinging skirts of
heavy material.
Waist lines were somewhat indefi
nite in the fashions of World War I,
but they .were aproximately where
they are today. The big difference
lies in the treatment of them, for
then they used loose belted waist
lines in contrast to the fitted, beltless
ones currently popular.
Whereas the modern college girl

corisiders her baggy sweater indis- !
pensible, the campus queen of those
days swore by her middy blouse and
bulky, belted jacket. Instead of the |
plain shirtwaist neckline of today, her !
blouse had fussy collars of all shapes. !
Full sleeves featured the dresses and j
blouses, unlike the short sporty ones I
of modem collegiate shirts.
BIG lIATS
Hats for the college wearer have |
also undergone modernization. No
longer worn to class, they are now
designed mainly for frivolous occa
sions and show it. Not so the hats of
the first war, which were practical, |
broad brimmed affairs that usually j
came to rest just above the eye- j
brows.
Although a few plaids and stripes
were seen around the Quad during
the last war, m >r;t of the outfits were j
of plain, drab, heavy material. White j
middy blouses and white pleated
skirts appeared in warm weather.
Unknown then was the variety of
colors, the many textile patterns and
the synthetic fabrics that distinguish
the wardrobe of today's Stanford j
girl.
Natural beauty was unmarred by 1
lipstick, mascara, or bleached hair.
Yes, there've been some changes
made.
