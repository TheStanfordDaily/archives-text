## AND WHY NOT?

IT'S Stanford in Spring again—or a tentative facsimile thereof—
and this is an edition of The Stanford Daily devoted to spring
fashions.
Men are dying on the spring earth in Bataan, in Java, in Burma,
in Russia, on the blue high seas, in the blue spring skies. And
we are putting out an edition of spring fashions.
Sure we are.
Why not?
Clothes will be worn this year, and the next, and the next.
Neither Hitler nor Hirohito can change the wind and the rain.
Show us the Stanford woman who prefers to look dowdy. Show
us the Stanford man who prefers to look at her.
One million men between the ages of 20 and 23 will die, if
the war lasts five years. Who'll predict it will be shorter? One
million women will come to know that death is the only absolute
truth in war.
So we're the ones who are about to die, and it's great to be
alive in spring. And a tiny part of spring is pretty clothes, and a
greater part of spring is the good time you have in those clothes.
If you have the money, buy the pretty clothes for spring.
But buy a defense bond first.—Jean Nowell
