# GIVE 'EM BACK TO THE HORSE
## 
### 
ONCE upon a time it was fun to buy a suit with a plaid that
might have been stolen from a horse, a hat with little pink
flowers trickling down one side, shoes with spike heels and
forget-me-nots over the instep. It was considered "the thing to
do" to wear blood-red claws at the ends of one's fingertips and
lengthy tresses floating in the breezes.
Along with everything else those times have changed. To
day, three words have become the fashionable woman's Bible—
wearability, practicability, capability.
Today, we shop for a conservative suit of good material that
' will hold it's shape and that can be made over regularly with
varigated accessories. We buy hats that will go with more than
one costume and hats that we feel we can inflict on those who
must look at us for a long time.
We wear shoes that have reasonable heels and in which we
i can walk a considerable distance without being a nervous wreck
after two blocks.
Even though we may not be taking a course in the motor
corps, our fingernails are short, neat, and well kept. Coiffures
are simple—flowing tresses are out of place.
Therefore 1942's well-dressed woman chooses her clothes
for their wearability and practicability—clothes in which she can
go anywhere and do anything —clothes that are smart now and
that will be just as smart one, two, or even three years from now.
In short, we are, and if we aren't we should be, buying
clothes that we will be able to live with for no one knows how
long. —Martha Deane
