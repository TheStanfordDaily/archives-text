# Bustle-Style Skirts Shaped for Wading
## 
### 
Accent on skirts. A few of the
daring have already begun to sport
the new tulip-shaped skirts which
place the -accent, anywhere from the
hips to the ankles.
Wading skirts are designed for
those who just wish to test the water.
These are fashioned so the skirt may
be pulled up above the knees and
tied in bustle fashion.
The ever-present need of hand- |
kerchiefs brings in an innovation. |
To prevent loss, hankies are now I
available with the inscription "This 1
belongs to so-and-so"; novel because |
Ihey come in all colors and are j
printed in script. You can also have
special messages to your close
friends or reminders to yourself
written on (he corner.
