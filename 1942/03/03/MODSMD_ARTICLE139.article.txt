# Frosh to Play Cal Hoopsters
## 
### 
Phil Bengtson and his freshman
cage team have exactly two more
chances to make a good season out
ol their 1042 hoop race, and in both
of those chances they will encoun
ter one of the best Cal frosh teams
in Berkeley athletic history.
Friday night at Stanford and Sat
urday at Cal, Stanford's frosh will
be meeting a team that has clumped
them 41-36 earlier (his year. Poly
High and Santa Clara frosh—both
teams that defeated the Bengtson
men soundly, have fallen before the
fast-break Cal attack, led by Charles
Hanger, a very lubricated forward.
Liut it isn't as much Cal itself that
is worrying Farm supporters as the
condition of the local frosh. All
th rough the present season, in which
they have won nine and dropped
four, the play of the locals has been
sporadic—sometimes hot, more often
ranging from tepid to very cold.
Only in the last two Farm vic
tories from San Francisco and Sa
linas J.C. did the freshmen garner
more than 50 points in a single
night.
