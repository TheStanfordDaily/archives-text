MIAMI BEACH." Fla., March 2
(UP).â€”Ancient Jack Doyle, base
ball's "official" pricemaker, favors
the Cardinals to win the National
League pennant and the Yankees to
repeat for the American circuit flag.
However, the bespectacled little
Irishman is announcing no prices yet.
He says the general outlook is so un
certain, because of war conditions,
that he will wait until April 12 to
make public his opening line on
the pennant races.
