# FROSH SHATTER SWIM MARKS
## 
### 

THESE TWO FROSH made swimming history here Friday in an
Encina pool meet between Stanford's freshman team and Fulierton
Junior College. Jim Gamble, left, swam the 50-yard freestyle in 23.0
to break the University frosh record for that event, and tie the na
tional mark. Team Captain Alan YVeeden, right, set a new University
frosh record for the 100-yard backstroke in 1:02.2.
