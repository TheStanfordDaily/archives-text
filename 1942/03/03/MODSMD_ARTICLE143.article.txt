# Cagers to Try Four in a Row
## 
### 
With the Southern Division title
already assured, Stanford's basket
! ball quintet will attempt to ac
| complish this week-end what has
; never been done before, to take all
| four hoop games from California in
J one season.
Simultaneously Jim Pollard will
be attempting to overcome the seor
! ing lead Bruin Ernie Handlesman
piled up on him last week-end.
While Pollard was helping the In
dians eineh the crown by defeating
! U.S.C. twice. Handlesman was scor
ing 34 points against his soft touch,
! (he Bears. Earlier this year he
scored 53 points against them in
! two games while all other teams
held him down.
Reports from Corvallis say that
i "Slats" Gill, Oregon State hoop
J coach, will capitalize on his team's
| vacation this week-end by coming
j south to scout the Indians in their
| two contests with Cal. Gill's Bea
ver five, by virtue of their victory
over Idaho Saturday night, meets
Stanford here March 13, 14, and 16.
Don Liebendorfer, Farm publi
j cist and Southern Division statis
j tician, sent out the official all-con
| ferenee team blanks yesterday to
j Coaches Dean, Price, Bescos, and
Johns. They will select two teams
and mail them back to Liebondorfer
! later in the week.
Last year's team was made up
completely of Indians, two of whom
have returned. It will be hard to
eliminate any of the Cards this year
: either, but the Trojans, Bruins, and
| Bears have several good men whom
1 thev want included too.
