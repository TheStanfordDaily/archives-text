upon a free throw after the gun, the
Alpha Delts defeated the Phi Delts,
26-25, to go into the semi-finals
Thursday night along with the Phi
Psis, Kappa Sigs, and Zetes.
With the crowd of 50 people stand
ing on their feet, Bill Brubaker sank
two free throws to pull the Phi Delts
up even with the Alpha Delts with
a minute to go. After a field goal
by each team and a free throw by
Lou Reese the gun went off ending
the game with the latter holding the
ball in what Referee Stan Owen
called stalling.
Brubaker was given the shot on
the technical foul, but this time Bill's
shot rimmed the hoop and fell out.
Reese was high-point man for the
game with 15 digits. Chukker Smith
led the losers with 10 points, al
though Larry Dee's floor work was
the best shown by either team.
