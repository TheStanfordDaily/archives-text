### H. D. THOREAU 
J iNE very noticeable difference between the conference basketball
games in the south and those around the bay is in the class of offi
ciating. Jerry Nemer and John Old, the two men who worked the Indian-
Trojan games, did excellent jobs both nights, allowing for the few lapses
which even the best are entitled to.
Old. a writer for a Los Angeles paper in his spare time, was both the
comedian and the villain in the shows produced on the Shrine stage. So
.hat no one will misunderstand the foul, he goes through elaborate ges
tures after calling men on infractions. Late in Saturday's game John called
i couple of raw ones on Jim Pollard, but Old was so humorous that Jim
just stood and laughed at him.
Whenever a shoelace became untied or something equally important
that necessitated the officials taking time out, he would shout to the bench,
"This one's on the house."
With a few minutes left to play Friday, he glided over to the sidelines
saying, "Several men on the floor are desirous of knowing the amount of
time remaining in this contest." But in between these remarks John does
a good job of covering the court.
Nemer. the diminutive ex-Trojan all-time-great, is even better at get
ting around and seeing everything. Jerry apparently is in just as good
shape a:; he was when he played, for he streaks from one end of the court
to the other, seemingly without tiring.

times during Friday night's game I looked out on the stage
and saw a black-haired boy with a Cardinal and Gold number 13 on
his back that reminded one of Ralph Vaughan, former S.C. hoop star, who
>ave even the great Luisetti a run for his money. However, it was only
Alex Omalev with a haircut. . . . Speaking of Hank, he showed very well
in S.F. Sunday night despite a bad knee. Teamed at forward with him is
'â– x-Oklahoman Jim McNutt, the fastest player on a basketball court today.
Paxil iLndernan, the giant who knocked us out of the coast title last year
for W.S.C.. ;.long with veteran All-American Guard Grady Lewis, make
the Oilers favorites to retake their national title from 20th Century-Fox,
who are no slouches. In a preview game the Phillips team edged out the
present champs in L.A. hist week, 40-43. . . . Sam Barry, Trojan advisory
coach, arrived from the East, where he has been visiting his sick son, in
time for Saturday's game, but did not move from his seat during the whole
game. . . . Gene Rock, southpaw sophomore for S.C., got more rebounds
than any man on the floor Saturday night desptie his 5-foot-9-inch height.
He's a deadeye from 30 feet out, too. . . . Once a Trojan happened to inter
cept one of Pollard's passes but it was so hot that he couldn't hold it.
It takes Jim's teammates quite a while to'get used to his tosses.
