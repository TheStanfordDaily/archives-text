## 
### 
Ed Tomaso, Stanford pole-vaulter,
says lie thinks Corny Warmerdam is
capable of 15 feet, 10 inches, if not
16 feet.
Ed says it takes a terrific mo
mentum to swing the body in the arc
required by Warmerdam's hold on
the pole. The Stanford vaulter
points out the narrow miss at 15-10
i lie other night as proof that Connie
can do it.
