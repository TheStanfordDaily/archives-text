# For Victory
## 
### 
IT all happened in a night and a day.
Night before last another Stanford student
realized suddenly that he and his fellow stu
dents were not doing everything possible to
bring about a victory. The more he thought
about it, the more novel, yet practical ideas he
got for raising money to buy defense stamps,
for salvaging waste paper, and for helping the
U.S.O. He even thought of a use for old razor
blades. He also realized one trouble with Stan
ford's war effort was the lack of co-ordination.
There were several committees, but no leader
ship or responsibility.
All this came about in his mind while he was
studying Shakespeare Sunday night. In short,
what he told Ex Committee yesterday and what
Ex Committee did as a result, proved there is
more that Stanford people and students of other
universities can do than merely (1) keep well
informed and (2) buy defense bonds.
The job of Stanford's new War Activities Co
ordinator, a position in local administration
similar to that of Donald M. Nelson of the War
Production Board, is to think up new and better
ways of campus contribution, and then see that
the committees under him administer them
expediently. It's as simple as that, and the more
centralized he makes his job—with the less sub
committees and flunkies and political hangers
on—the better. A man who thought up as many
ideas as he did in a night and a day is a fast
thinker. He, then, is the man who heads Stan
ford's war effort.
At the same time that this voluntary contri
bution arose in the form of a new and important
position in Stanford student government yes
terday, the disappointing news came that only
four campus living groups had taken action at
last night's weekly house, club and hall meet
ings toward purchasing a defense savings bond.
Perhaps it is poor taste to become impatient
with houses or eating clubs or halls whose mem
bers "talk it over" and maybe "appoint a com
mittee" and yet, when all's said and done, do
nothing. Last night was the first weekly house
meeting night since the bond drive was pro
posed, and for that reason it may be another
week before the plan gets full support.
Let it be said for the record, however, that
Lagunita Court and most of Stanford's sororities,
out of all the many campus eating and living
groups, are the ones which are leading the pack.

thinker. He, then, is the man who heads Stan
ford's war effort.
At the same time that this voluntary contri
bution arose in the form of a new and important
position in Stanford student government yes
terday, the disappointing news came that only
four campus living groups had taken action at
last night's weekly house, club and hall meet
ings toward purchasing a defense savings bond.
Perhaps it is poor taste to become impatient
with houses or eating clubs or halls whose mem
bers "talk it over" and maybe "appoint a com
mittee" and yet, when all's said and done, do
nothing. Last night was the first weekly house
meeting night since the bond drive was pro
posed, and for that reason it may be another
week before the plan gets full support.
Let it be said for the record, however, that
Lagunita Court and most of Stanford's sororities,
out of all the many campus eating and living
groups, are the ones which are leading the pack.
IT all happened in a night and a day.
Night before last another Stanford student
realized suddenly that he and his fellow stu
dents were not doing everything possible to
bring about a victory. The more he thought
about it, the more novel, yet practical ideas he
got for raising money to buy defense stamps,
for salvaging waste paper, and for helping the
U.S.O. He even thought of a use for old razor
blades. He also realized one trouble with Stan
ford's war effort was the lack of co-ordination.
There were several committees, but no leader
ship or responsibility.
All this came about in his mind while he was
studying Shakespeare Sunday night. In short,
what he told Ex Committee yesterday and what
Ex Committee did as a result, proved there is
more that Stanford people and students of other
universities can do than merely (1) keep well
informed and (2) buy defense bonds.
The job of Stanford's new War Activities Co
ordinator, a position in local administration
similar to that of Donald M. Nelson of the War
Production Board, is to think up new and better
ways of campus contribution, and then see that
the committees under him administer them
expediently. It's as simple as that, and the more
centralized he makes his job—with the less sub
committees and flunkies and political hangers
on—the better. A man who thought up as many
ideas as he did in a night and a day is a fast
thinker. He, then, is the man who heads Stan
ford's war effort.
