# Surprise! No Red Tape
## 
### 
THAT Excom met yesterday is not sensational
news. Excom meets every week. But it was
a new and different Excom that gathered around
the big oak table in Excom's august chambers.
Our student officials heard a report from an
enthusiastic student outlining a plan to co-ordi
nate war activities. Then, Excom discussed the
plan. And here's the surprise:
Without the usual hemming and hawing,
without getting itself involved in red tape, with
out passing the buck, Excom acted on the pro
posal with "lightning speed."
[Without hesitation, it killed the motion to
"send the plan to a committee for study"—the
usual method of procrastination. Instead Excom
acted with war-time efficiency; heard, discussed,
and passed the motion, naming the co-ordinator
of campus war activities and all at one sitting.
This may well serve as an example.
Proposals should not be tucked away in
musty committee, sub-committee, and sub-sub
committee meetings. Let suggestions and plans
be aired immediately and acted upon as soon
as feasible.
Actions still speak louder than words.—Her
