### AMIE REICHERT 
IS too bad that the United Nations can't whip up
a general big enough to take supreme command of
the mess in the Far East and do something about it,
but it is just as well that they found out right now
that Archibald VVavell is not their man.
Wavcll is a good general, good by British stand
ards and the best they have produced, but he is ap
parently not good enough to win the war for them.
Yes, he's good by British standards, but their sights
haven't been set high enough in the past. The chances
are you can't think of a single German general or a
single Russian general, excepting Budenny, who isn't
better. And the Japanese aren't half bad, either.
Now at last the British—probably with a little
Dutch and American prodding—have realized this.
And along with this disappointment is a still greater
one implied in the fact that the Unified Headquarters
for the Far East have been dissolved and defenses are
now returned to local hands.
The implication is that if it isn't Wavcll, it's no
one. There isn't anyone better, in fact, there doesn't
seem to be any one at all in sight, and that is unfortu
nate, because a unified command that would func
tion efficiently and with intelligent all-over strategy
would be the ideal thing. The Germans and the Japa
nese have their strategy worked out on a world-wide
basis and they are carrying it forward step by step.
The United Nations thus far have not been able to
work out a successful defensive strategy for a com
paratively small area. It may be too early in the war.
At any rate, the thing has now broken apart and
the Dutch are commanding the defenses of Java, the
Australians are giving their own orders, and Wavcll
has been sent to take charge of things in India.
* * * #
' j I HIS is probably the best alternative available now
that the unified command has fizzled. There isn't
much unity of position left in that area any more
since the loss of Singapore and the islands of the
Dutch Indies.
What is left now, and what lies next in the ene
my's war path consists of Java, Australia, and India.
These three form a sort of circle with the center —
where Singapore and the Indies were—knocked out.
Wavell will unquestionably be valuable in India.
He will pick up the job of organizing India's de
fenses where he left off several months ago. And in
this he will probably be assisted by Chiang Kai-Shek
who only last week concluded a series of important
conferences there with Indian leaders, including
Ghandi and Nehru.
He may also be needed there in case the Nazis
spring dreams materialize and they find themselves
holding hands with the Japs over India.

this he will probably be assisted by Chiang Kai-Shek
who only last week concluded a series of important
conferences there with Indian leaders, including
Ghandi and Nehru.
He may also be needed there in case the Nazis
spring dreams materialize and they find themselves
holding hands with the Japs over India.
IS too bad that the United Nations can't whip up
a general big enough to take supreme command of
the mess in the Far East and do something about it,
but it is just as well that they found out right now
that Archibald VVavell is not their man.
Wavcll is a good general, good by British stand
ards and the best they have produced, but he is ap
parently not good enough to win the war for them.
Yes, he's good by British standards, but their sights
haven't been set high enough in the past. The chances
are you can't think of a single German general or a
single Russian general, excepting Budenny, who isn't
better. And the Japanese aren't half bad, either.
Now at last the British—probably with a little
Dutch and American prodding—have realized this.
And along with this disappointment is a still greater
one implied in the fact that the Unified Headquarters
for the Far East have been dissolved and defenses are
now returned to local hands.
The implication is that if it isn't Wavcll, it's no
one. There isn't anyone better, in fact, there doesn't
seem to be any one at all in sight, and that is unfortu
nate, because a unified command that would func
tion efficiently and with intelligent all-over strategy
would be the ideal thing. The Germans and the Japa
nese have their strategy worked out on a world-wide
basis and they are carrying it forward step by step.
The United Nations thus far have not been able to
work out a successful defensive strategy for a com
paratively small area. It may be too early in the war.
At any rate, the thing has now broken apart and
the Dutch are commanding the defenses of Java, the
Australians are giving their own orders, and Wavcll
has been sent to take charge of things in India.

' j I HIS is probably the best alternative available now
that the unified command has fizzled. There isn't
much unity of position left in that area any more
since the loss of Singapore and the islands of the
Dutch Indies.
What is left now, and what lies next in the ene
my's war path consists of Java, Australia, and India.
These three form a sort of circle with the center —
where Singapore and the Indies were—knocked out.
Wavell will unquestionably be valuable in India.
He will pick up the job of organizing India's de
fenses where he left off several months ago. And in
this he will probably be assisted by Chiang Kai-Shek
who only last week concluded a series of important
conferences there with Indian leaders, including
Ghandi and Nehru.
