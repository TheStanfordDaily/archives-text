"LET'S ALL SING
LIKE THE BIRDIES"
RALLY COMMITTEE, arc we going to have
k another Singfest this Spring? I hope that you arc
making big plans for one.
Of course, I don't participate in a singfest other
than as a spectator. When I was a youngster in grade
school our singing classes were divided into five groups.
The best were the larks and the next best the canaries,
and so on down to the discord group who were the
crows. I was a crow.
I have always felt a little angry with singers ever
since I was beaten out for the hand of Peggy in the
fourth grade by a canary.
Tommy Howard did a wonderful job with the sing
fest last year, particularly when it is realized that his
was the first.
There were a couple of minor faults, I believe,
which might be ironed out by having fewer partici
pants sing more songs. The program was too long or
perhaps too dragged-out. This was due mainly to the
long pause necessary between cach group.
The University of Washington, who each year puts
on a fine singfest, has each group sing three or four
songs. These are specified to be humorous, serious,
and a "signature song" and perhaps a free choice.
Before the singfest some sort of "play-ofTs" arc
arranged, and the four or five best male and female
groups arc chosen. In this way they get a smoother
program with more music and less pauses for change.
Eight or ten groups are plenty.
The singfest idea is right in line with the on
campus activity movement so if you haven't already
started planning, Rally Committee, will you think
about it seriously.
<i 4 * At
near you as you read this is probably
k the fashion edition. If the pictures in it arc any
thing like the originals my only comment is ihat you
are a fool to be over on this page.
Due to the spoils system, or for some other un
democratic reason, the editor got first pick at the
originals and now has a choice selection on his wall.
Our editor is like that. I got a few myself and stare
at them three times a day, before meals.

fest last year, particularly when it is realized that his
was the first.
There were a couple of minor faults, I believe,
which might be ironed out by having fewer partici
pants sing more songs. The program was too long or
perhaps too dragged-out. This was due mainly to the
long pause necessary between cach group.
The University of Washington, who each year puts
on a fine singfest, has each group sing three or four
songs. These are specified to be humorous, serious,
and a "signature song" and perhaps a free choice.
Before the singfest some sort of "play-ofTs" arc
arranged, and the four or five best male and female
groups arc chosen. In this way they get a smoother
program with more music and less pauses for change.
Eight or ten groups are plenty.
The singfest idea is right in line with the on
campus activity movement so if you haven't already
started planning, Rally Committee, will you think
about it seriously.
<i 4 * At
near you as you read this is probably
k the fashion edition. If the pictures in it arc any
thing like the originals my only comment is ihat you
are a fool to be over on this page.
Due to the spoils system, or for some other un
democratic reason, the editor got first pick at the
originals and now has a choice selection on his wall.
Our editor is like that. I got a few myself and stare
at them three times a day, before meals.
"LET'S ALL SING
LIKE THE BIRDIES"
RALLY COMMITTEE, arc we going to have
k another Singfest this Spring? I hope that you arc
making big plans for one.
Of course, I don't participate in a singfest other
than as a spectator. When I was a youngster in grade
school our singing classes were divided into five groups.
The best were the larks and the next best the canaries,
and so on down to the discord group who were the
crows. I was a crow.
I have always felt a little angry with singers ever
since I was beaten out for the hand of Peggy in the
fourth grade by a canary.
Tommy Howard did a wonderful job with the sing
fest last year, particularly when it is realized that his
was the first.
