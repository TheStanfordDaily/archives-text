W/'HAT arc we—students and citizens of America—
expectcd to do?
Newspapers, politicians, and luncheon club ora
tors decry, admonish, and shout at the people of the
country. They call us complacent, say we must "come
to a more serious realization of the crisis facing us,"
warn that "we may lose the war."
What are we expectcd to do? We have accepted
without dissent the staggering taxes levied on us. We
relaizc ungrudgingly that we'll get no more tires, new
cars, and hundreds of conveniences, even necessities
that we are used to. We register for the draft; we
enlist in the armed forces to be called when we are
neoded; we take courses to prepare us for our role in
the war. Women also will answer the call when they
are needed. Many are preparing themselves now.
We at Stanford, as well as all citizens of this coun
try, have done everything asked of us. Perhaps that
is what is meant by "complacent"—waiting to be asked
to do certain things, instead of taking the initiative.
(However, take the initiative in what?) But com
placent has always meant "self-satisfied.'' Arc we
satisfied with Pearl Harbor. Manila. Singapore, Burma?
*We are not. Yet, there is nothing to do about it,
as President Roosevelt says, "We must trust our lead
ers to guide us in this struggle."
Should we worry more? Would that help rid us
of complacency? No, a fearful, worrying people arc
less able to win a war than a determined, but un
frightened people.
Actually, there is little we can do that we haven't
done . One thing we can do, however, is to be calm,
yet keep well informed, weigh each day's news care
fully, recognize defeat without losing our head, and
do whatever is asked us.
What more can be expected of us?

*We are not. Yet, there is nothing to do about it,
as President Roosevelt says, "We must trust our lead
ers to guide us in this struggle."
Should we worry more? Would that help rid us
of complacency? No, a fearful, worrying people arc
less able to win a war than a determined, but un
frightened people.
Actually, there is little we can do that we haven't
done . One thing we can do, however, is to be calm,
yet keep well informed, weigh each day's news care
fully, recognize defeat without losing our head, and
do whatever is asked us.
What more can be expected of us?
