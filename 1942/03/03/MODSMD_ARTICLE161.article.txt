# Chemist Says TNT Output Up
## 
### 
American production of TNT will
have reached "staggering" propor
tions by summer, Dr. Harry N.
Holmes of Oberlin College, president
of the American Chemical Society,
declared here tonight.
The supply of TNT in this country
would be inadequate to meet the
war aims of the United Nations if
chemists had not recently discovered
a remarkable way to make toluene,
easily converted into TNT, from pe
troleum, Dr. Holmes said.
WAR GAS RESERVE
"It is no secret that we are piling
up reserves of war gases," Dr.
Holmes continued. "Germany has
not yet used gas for fear of retalia
tion, but it will in an all-out in
vasion of Britain if it thinks an
immediate victory will result. Japan
is more suicidal in temperament and
if it has enough gas reserves may
use them in attack at any time. The
obvious defenses against gas are
masks, suitable impregnable cloth
ing, and a powerful gas offensive.
"The petroleum industry is now
producing 100-octane gasoline for
our aircraft in great quantities as
compared with Germany's 90-oc
tane aviation fuel. This difference
gives our fighters more than 20
miles an hour greater speed with
the same plane.
RUBBER SHORTAGE
"Our most alarming shortage is in
rubber. Even gas masks require
rubber; pontoon bridges float on in
flated rubber bags; barrage balloons
are made of rubberized fabric, al
though a .substitute is being con
sidered; and hospitals must have
rubber.
"Normally we use 600,000 tons
yearly and yet our stock pile con
tains less than 700.0C0 tons. By
almost completely denying rubber
to the general public and by re
claiming old rubber, il is hoped that
this reserve will take care of military
needs for two years."

immediate victory will result. Japan
is more suicidal in temperament and
if it has enough gas reserves may
use them in attack at any time. The
obvious defenses against gas are
masks, suitable impregnable cloth
ing, and a powerful gas offensive.
"The petroleum industry is now
producing 100-octane gasoline for
our aircraft in great quantities as
compared with Germany's 90-oc
tane aviation fuel. This difference
gives our fighters more than 20
miles an hour greater speed with
the same plane.
RUBBER SHORTAGE
"Our most alarming shortage is in
rubber. Even gas masks require
rubber; pontoon bridges float on in
flated rubber bags; barrage balloons
are made of rubberized fabric, al
though a .substitute is being con
sidered; and hospitals must have
rubber.
"Normally we use 600,000 tons
yearly and yet our stock pile con
tains less than 700.0C0 tons. By
almost completely denying rubber
to the general public and by re
claiming old rubber, il is hoped that
this reserve will take care of military
needs for two years."
