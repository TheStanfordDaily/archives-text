WASHINGTON, March 2 (UP).â€”
War Production Chief Donald M.
Nelson tonight fired the opening gun
in a competitive production race
! among the nation's armament fac
j torics and challenged labor and
| management to surpass their quotas
jby exerting "sweat and action"
i equal to the "blood and action of
j the battle line."
He said in a radio address (Blue
Network, Inc.) that the accelerated
j production drive had been requested
| by President Roosevelt so that the
j nation may display its traditional
love for competition in an all-im
portant contest whose outcome "can
shape the whole course of history
for a thousand years and shape it
I to our way of life."
