# Chancellor Wilbur Gives Talk On Nation's Reaction to War
## 
### JOHN HORRALL 
"You can light a war in two ways—you can dodge, delay, or run away—
that is defense, or you can wipe the enemy out —that is offence."
Thus Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur expressed yesterday his endorse
ment of the campaign to change the term "National Defense" to "National
Offense."
Dr. Wilbur recently returned to the campus after a 10-day trip to the

Congress on Medical Education and
Licensure in Chicago and to the As
sociation of American School Ad
ministrators' convention in San
Francisco.
UNPREPAREDNESS
"The people in the Midwest are
just like the people in every other
part of the country—-they think the
other fellow isn't prepared," he
said when asked how well the Mid
westerners think the Pacific and
Atlantic Coasts are prepared.
He said that their preparedness
has progressed as far as that in any
other part of the country.
GREATEST SHOW
Talking about the nation as a
whole in relation to the war, Dr.
Wilbur said, "The people in this
country have had an opportunity to
watch the greatest show in the world
since the time of Caesar. We have
been able to read about events after
they have happened, listen to ac
counts while they are happening,
and sec them happen in the news
reels.
"Now, all of a sudden we are in
it, and find ourselves acting as spec
tators. We have to face reality—
we can't win a war with our men
working 8 hours a day when the
enemy is working '28' hours a day.
The trouble with our people is that
they arc still thinking in terms of
politics."
MEDICINE ORGANIZED
As to his particular field, medi
cine, he said that it is probably bet
ter organized than most other fields.
By November there will be 30,000
trained doctors in the service of this
country. The medical schools have
already arranged their courses so
that medical majors will be able to
finish their work a year earlier than
usual.

that is defense, or you can wipe the enemy out —that is offence."
Thus Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur expressed yesterday his endorse
ment of the campaign to change the term "National Defense" to "National
Offense."
Dr. Wilbur recently returned to the campus after a 10-day trip to the

Congress on Medical Education and
Licensure in Chicago and to the As
sociation of American School Ad
ministrators' convention in San
Francisco.
UNPREPAREDNESS
"The people in the Midwest are
just like the people in every other
part of the country—-they think the
other fellow isn't prepared," he
said when asked how well the Mid
westerners think the Pacific and
Atlantic Coasts are prepared.
He said that their preparedness
has progressed as far as that in any
other part of the country.
GREATEST SHOW
Talking about the nation as a
whole in relation to the war, Dr.
Wilbur said, "The people in this
country have had an opportunity to
watch the greatest show in the world
since the time of Caesar. We have
been able to read about events after
they have happened, listen to ac
counts while they are happening,
and sec them happen in the news
reels.
"Now, all of a sudden we are in
it, and find ourselves acting as spec
tators. We have to face reality—
we can't win a war with our men
working 8 hours a day when the
enemy is working '28' hours a day.
The trouble with our people is that
they arc still thinking in terms of
politics."
MEDICINE ORGANIZED
As to his particular field, medi
cine, he said that it is probably bet
ter organized than most other fields.
By November there will be 30,000
trained doctors in the service of this
country. The medical schools have
already arranged their courses so
that medical majors will be able to
finish their work a year earlier than
usual.
"You can light a war in two ways—you can dodge, delay, or run away—
that is defense, or you can wipe the enemy out —that is offence."
