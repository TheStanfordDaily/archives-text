# Officer Uncovers Damage to Phone
## 
### 
Indications of sabotage were un-
covered Saturday night when an air
raid phone unit was found broken
open and smashed for the second
time in a week.
Hank Rible, head watch officer
at the control center, told reporters
yesterday that Box J at 750 Dolores
Street had been forced open and the
glass key cylinder broken. Defense
officers first noticed the difficulty
when the phone failed to respond to
tests Saturday.
Box J, one of the seven white
alarm units used by air raid officers
to contact the control center, is lo-
cated near the home of Professor
L. M. Terman.
