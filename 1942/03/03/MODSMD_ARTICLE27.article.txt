### 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, Java,
March 3 (Tuesday) (UP).—The full
might of the strongest Allied army
in the .southwest Pacific was hurled
today against the Japanese invaders
of Java with terrible and "satisfac
tory results, but the situation was
so perilous that "scorched earth"
demolitions were begun at Batavia,
the l jjital ciiy.
P.-iM'd by snub-nosed tanks, ar
moi ;! cars and motorized columns,
and hielded from above by locally
sup< ior air forces which sank nu
merous Japanese landing sloops
lo; <'■ f| with soldiers and tanks, the
Ni 1 i lands Indies and Allied ar
rn charged headlong into three
Japanese columns which drove in
land li'.m the north Java shore.
Nc I liVIT'DIATE THREAT
i ! o Aneta news agency said there
w. no question of immediate threat
to Uatavia from the Japanese striv
in lo bore inland from St. Nicolaas
1' 'it, to the west, and the Indrama
j" ' i, to the east. The demolition
w; ordered, Aneta said, to avoid
;n.. r/sk that installations might fall
in enemy hands, lt was asumed
tii ' I asoline stores, docks and other
in lations were being destroyed.
Official details of the increasingly
vioa-ht battles were meager both
y i day and this morning, but au
th:. itative sources declared that
"hard blows have been inflicted on
the enemy."
J. S SUFFER HITS
An official statement said action
against the Japanese was develop
i'i . satisfactorily, with the Japanese
sufi'eiing "fair hits." It added that
"up to now there has been no in
formation about fifth-column ac
tivity."
E vorywhere the enemy appeared
to lack superiority in the air for the
fi).;t time in the Pacific war. Bomb
ers, escorted by fighter planes,
which attempted twice yesterday to
raid Bandoeng, mountain head
quarters of the Dutch army, were '
driven off by Allied fighter planes
and anti-aircraft fire. Observers re
ported virtual absence of enemy
fighter planes to support ground
operations.
