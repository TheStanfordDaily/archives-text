# Shakespeare Inspires New 'SWAC'

### 
Bob Collins was studying Shake
speare night before last when all
of a sudden he realized that Stan
ford students should be doing more
to help with the war effort. He
pulled out his pcncil and began
writing ideas down on the cover of
his book. It didn't take long for
them to formulate.
Before long he had three pages
full of suggestions. Why not put
Stanford's war effort under one
man? Why not save used razor
blades, magazines and papers, and
toothpaste and shaving cream con
tainers? Why not make personal in
vitations to soldiers to attend the
Tuesday Series, Sunday movies, and
other campus programs?
PRESENTS PROGRAM
Then he presented his program
before a spell-bound Excom. He
listened as two members tried to
shelve the work for a week; then his
face lit up as two other members
stressed the necessity of getting the
program started immediately.
He hadn't been at the meeting for
more than half an hour when he
was unanimously electcd Stanford
War Activities Co-orainator.
NEED VOLUNTEERS
Thus, all in a night and a day,
Stanford had a shake-up similar to
the move made several months ago
in Washington when Donald Nelson
was appointed head of the War Pro
duction Board.
"Wc need all of the volunteers
we can possibly get to make this
program a success," Collins said last
night.
