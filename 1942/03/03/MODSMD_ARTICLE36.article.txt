Pierre Monjeux, conducting the |
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, ;
again exhibited his originality in !
last week-end's program at the Op- |
era House by presenting a varied I
program including not only an en- |
semble of four pianos but also Bee
thoven's second symphony.
Outstanding on the program were i
the four artists playing the Vivaldi-
Bach Concerto. The quartet con
sisted of the veterans Rudolph Can/
and E. Robert Sehmitz and the rela
tively young but experienced Eu
gene List and Dalies Franz. Notable
for their co-ordination, especially in
the fast movements, they showed
their collective ability to undertake
this difficult concerto.
Infante's "Three Andalusian
Dances," also played by the quartet,
was so well received that the au- I
dience was obliged with an encore
of the last movement.
Monteux, in his own right, held
the attention of the audience with !
the Beethoven symphony, delicately ;
emphasizing its gaiety and force
fulness, at the .same time retarding
ils dignity. (A recording will be
made ol this by Pierre Monteux in
a few weeks.)
