# Splashy Prints, Crisp Ginghams Will Be Bright Notes in Before Sunrise Spring Eight O'clocks
## 
### 
In days when headlines scream "unbalanced budget" and "sabotage,"
Spring Quarter tai cs <Â»n a serious aspcct .... our protective Ivy Tower,
if it ever existed, has crumbled into non-existence. While the Stanford
men face SERVICE .... the Stanford women are facing "Stanford Men
In the Service!" .... which is ba-a-a-ad in any co-ed's language.

Not forgetting that it is her duty
to strike a cheerful note in world ,
where the men are faced with war
and eight oVlodks, she will probably
dress in a gay print, and since the
man at home, namely father, is faced
by the war and Taxes, her economic
frock will be of crisp gingham or
seersucker.

Combined lerrir.inity and efficiency
is the oi "'c'.i - e mctr of co-eds who
will as. mb'.e their Spring Quarter
wardrobes, according to the eurren
fashion di.-ti ms, r?adif t'ng cut from
(he Southern California style cen
ters, where viMjdo, campus "classics'"
are prime favorites.... the style
grapevine hints oi dozens of new
offerings.
The diindl .-.kirt is back, tacked on
to a set-in panelled waistiine. and
hand in hand with the favored,
square, peasant neckline .... founc!
in pastel seersuckers and cottons
. . . . brightened up with flowered
patterns. Comes nsain the day for
white pique .... fashioned in an
other dirndl costume is a big prin
centering in a gathered waistline. A
"must" is the gingham of red and
white "tablecloth" check .... has a
voluminous skirt.... buttons from
waistline up with little pearl buttons
. . . . and is topped with a casual
cckline made lor a starched, fresh,
white dickey!
CHARTREUSE-GREEN
A chartreuse seersucker is striking
with brown, white, and royal blue
design. Chartreuse-green is going to
be as much of a v necessity on quad
this spring as olive-green in the
army.
An adorable dress that will really
wake them up in that eight o'clock
is of blue chambry with a tremen- |
dous skirt gathered onto an inset i
waist-line tied in back with a sash,
and sporting expansive poppies em
broidered on the front in big
splotches of contrasting color ....
but good!
NEW SPORT CLASSICS
Foregone conclusions are the
classic sport dresses of linen, or the
casual tailored gabardines. ... in
the neutral shades, contrasted with
saddle-stitchina or tooled leather
belts .... which make the basis
for every collegienne wardrobe. New,
is the teca cloth, two-piece sport
dress with immense wooden buttons
.... the ensemble can be worn as
a suit or dress, and is thus both sav
ing and flattering. In the same two
in-one category is he jacket dress
of tailored print with low hipline
and pleated skirt.
Help the family budget by
taking advantage of offered aid from
the Fashion Houses ... a few
matching dresses, skirts and jackets
that can be switched in different
combinations. . . . with a little in
genuity on blouses and fresh, white
dickeys. .. . and what Stanford
woman won't still be able to do her
part in upholding her country's
morale. ... as well as keeping that
eight o'clock on its toes right through j
the quarter?
