There is going to be plenty of op
portunity this spring for the girl
whose worst fear is looking mousy.
"Be feminine, be bright," demand
the fashion editors. Get the boys'
minds off olive drab and that awful
shade of brown.
Many new color schemes are be
ing heralded this season. One of the
most daring combinations we have
seen so far is a darkish green suit
with chartreuse gloves and brazen
l'ed purse and shoes. Turquoise
promises to be a good bet for the
season, and you can wear with it
rich yellow, mauve pink or navy.
KELLY GREEN
A Kelly green suit with bright red
accessories is sure to draw admiring
nods from all sides. For a pastel
suit a cute trick in accessories is be
ing shown--a matching blouse and
glove set of polka dot taffeta which
add spice to any spring suit. And
with an eye to our morale-raising
campaign, we learn that there is
nothing so feminine as the rustle of
taffela.
We are all out for the fashion ed
itors' promotion of bright colors for
proper accessories, but we draw the
line on stockings. Those fashion boys
don't seem to know when they're
licked. We looked at red and green
and blue stockings lasL fall, but we
just looked. Now we see Mademoi
selle's cover girl looking most at
tractive until we notice that she has
green legs. Harper's Bazaar is pro
moting Blui" Spray nylons which
would make anyone of us look like a
healthy corpse.
EASTER BONNETS
Now we come to the most impor
tant of spring accessories, the Easter
bonnet. You can run amuck. With
your spring suit or dress, wear flow
ers and veils and fruit and birds all
on the same hat if you like, and the
boys will love you for it.
All in all this spring will be a
great one for accessories. They need
not be expensive, but they must be
gay. Combine your reds and greens,
wear pink with anything, and try
some flower print shoes to match
your dress. Above all forget your
inhibitions and be cheerful and
pretty.

boys will love you for it.
All in all this spring will be a
great one for accessories. They need
not be expensive, but they must be
gay. Combine your reds and greens,
wear pink with anything, and try
some flower print shoes to match
your dress. Above all forget your
inhibitions and be cheerful and
pretty.
There is going to be plenty of op
portunity this spring for the girl
whose worst fear is looking mousy.
"Be feminine, be bright," demand
the fashion editors. Get the boys'
minds off olive drab and that awful
shade of brown.
Many new color schemes are be
ing heralded this season. One of the
most daring combinations we have
seen so far is a darkish green suit
with chartreuse gloves and brazen
l'ed purse and shoes. Turquoise
promises to be a good bet for the
season, and you can wear with it
rich yellow, mauve pink or navy.
KELLY GREEN
A Kelly green suit with bright red
accessories is sure to draw admiring
nods from all sides. For a pastel
suit a cute trick in accessories is be
ing shown--a matching blouse and
glove set of polka dot taffeta which
add spice to any spring suit. And
with an eye to our morale-raising
campaign, we learn that there is
nothing so feminine as the rustle of
taffela.
We are all out for the fashion ed
itors' promotion of bright colors for
proper accessories, but we draw the
line on stockings. Those fashion boys
don't seem to know when they're
licked. We looked at red and green
and blue stockings lasL fall, but we
just looked. Now we see Mademoi
selle's cover girl looking most at
tractive until we notice that she has
green legs. Harper's Bazaar is pro
moting Blui" Spray nylons which
would make anyone of us look like a
healthy corpse.
EASTER BONNETS
Now we come to the most impor
tant of spring accessories, the Easter
bonnet. You can run amuck. With
your spring suit or dress, wear flow
ers and veils and fruit and birds all
on the same hat if you like, and the
boys will love you for it.
