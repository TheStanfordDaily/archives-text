# Priorities Produce Bi-Metal Jewelry
## 
### 
Graduation surprises this year
will include gold watches with silver
backs, according to one jeweler who
was asked how the priorities list
will affect jewelry. The base metals
are now nonentities in regard to
anything but defense, so gold-and
silver combinations in jewelry are
going to keep down the expense of
a solid gold watch or bracelet.
Plain link brackets with an identi
fication tag fire more popular than
ever, now that blackouts and mili
tary maneuvers are making for still
more efficiency. These tags have
room for a name on one side and an
address and phone number on the
other which will save you the trou
ble of giving out all this information
verbally.
"Chambray," a new cologne by
Faberge, comes in a bottle with a
fabric topâ€”the same material as
new summer dresses.
