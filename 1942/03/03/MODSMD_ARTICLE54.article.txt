# New Sweaters Sacrifice Wool To Uniforms
## Axis Subs Threaten English Shipments To United States 
### MARTHA DEANE 
Skirts may fluctuate vertically,
hats may droop or lly away, shoes
may tie around the ankle, but
sweaters go on forever. A picture
of a Stanford woman without a
sweater is like a picture of Churchill
and Hirohito imbibing one ice cream
soda with two straws.
However, as many of our old
stand-bys fade from the picture,
sweaters are going with them. And
the Stanford coed may very soon
have to get along without her sweat
ers for there is plenty of news along
the lines of supply.
As time and the war progress,
there arc going to be fewer and
fewer sweaters. According to a San
Francisco shop, many lines have al
ready been discontinued.
PRESENT STOCKS GOOD
Importers have been receiving
their shipments—slowly but surely
up to the present time, so they have
good stocks on hand. However, they
arc unable to predict for the future,
and it looks none too bright.
As far as England is concerned,
wool will still be exported since she
needs foreign exchange. Whether or
not it reaches America depends upon
the Axis subs.
As far as home-grown wool is
concerned, the picture is even less
bright. The supply of domestic wool
available to the civilian population
has been cut to between 30 and 40
per cent of the former amount.
What used to go into a Brooks sweat
er is now going into uniforms for
men in the service. The possibility
of synthetic substitutes is hazy.
CLASSIC STYLES
Aside from the revolution in sup
ply, there is little news along the
line of style—it still remains un
changed. The torso is long, the neck
is round, the sleeves, although in
tended to be long, are draped some
where in the region of the elbow—in
short, the typical Brooks. The ex
perts may rave about new little
numbers with embroidered flowers,
striped borders, and similar para
phernalia, but none of these gadgets
has or will replace the Brooks.
And colors have become stereo
typed. The saleslady may call it
"champagne" but we call it beige.
The ads herald a new "sea foam" or
"green glass" and we continue to
wear green.
However, this year an alien has
appeared in our midst. More and
more the cable stitch sweater is seen
on the Quad as well as in the snow
fields. It may be pure white or
white with stripes at the neck and
bottom. It may be navy blue with
little red "v's" embroidered between
the cables.
Hovering around the edge, but

never quite making the grade into
every girl's closet are the short
sleeved, round necked sweaters and
the angoras which look just right
under suits or with skirt on a bright
spring day.
Therefore, now is the time to buy
sweaters. Along with many other
commodities, they may not be with
us long. At present the stores have
good stocks and wide selections.
When they are exhausted, the next
best things is to revamp the old ones
that repose in the bottom drawer.
In spite of the shortage of dyes,
this year as well as last black sweat
ers are smart. Of course, of spring
quarter is a sizzler, blouses will be
the order of the day and the sweater
problem will go out the window.
However there is always next win
ter.

Pastel classic coats in flannels and
fleeces will be popular as the spring
top-coat.

has been cut to between 30 and 40
per cent of the former amount.
What used to go into a Brooks sweat
er is now going into uniforms for
men in the service. The possibility
of synthetic substitutes is hazy.
CLASSIC STYLES
Aside from the revolution in sup
ply, there is little news along the
line of style—it still remains un
changed. The torso is long, the neck
is round, the sleeves, although in
tended to be long, are draped some
where in the region of the elbow—in
short, the typical Brooks. The ex
perts may rave about new little
numbers with embroidered flowers,
striped borders, and similar para
phernalia, but none of these gadgets
has or will replace the Brooks.
And colors have become stereo
typed. The saleslady may call it
"champagne" but we call it beige.
The ads herald a new "sea foam" or
"green glass" and we continue to
wear green.
However, this year an alien has
appeared in our midst. More and
more the cable stitch sweater is seen
on the Quad as well as in the snow
fields. It may be pure white or
white with stripes at the neck and
bottom. It may be navy blue with
little red "v's" embroidered between
the cables.
Hovering around the edge, but

never quite making the grade into
every girl's closet are the short
sleeved, round necked sweaters and
the angoras which look just right
under suits or with skirt on a bright
spring day.
Therefore, now is the time to buy
sweaters. Along with many other
commodities, they may not be with
us long. At present the stores have
good stocks and wide selections.
When they are exhausted, the next
best things is to revamp the old ones
that repose in the bottom drawer.
In spite of the shortage of dyes,
this year as well as last black sweat
ers are smart. Of course, of spring
quarter is a sizzler, blouses will be
the order of the day and the sweater
problem will go out the window.
However there is always next win
ter.

Pastel classic coats in flannels and
fleeces will be popular as the spring
top-coat.
Skirts may fluctuate vertically,
hats may droop or lly away, shoes
may tie around the ankle, but
sweaters go on forever. A picture
of a Stanford woman without a
sweater is like a picture of Churchill
and Hirohito imbibing one ice cream
soda with two straws.
However, as many of our old
stand-bys fade from the picture,
sweaters are going with them. And
the Stanford coed may very soon
have to get along without her sweat
ers for there is plenty of news along
the lines of supply.
As time and the war progress,
there arc going to be fewer and
fewer sweaters. According to a San
Francisco shop, many lines have al
ready been discontinued.
PRESENT STOCKS GOOD
Importers have been receiving
their shipments—slowly but surely
up to the present time, so they have
good stocks on hand. However, they
arc unable to predict for the future,
and it looks none too bright.
As far as England is concerned,
wool will still be exported since she
needs foreign exchange. Whether or
not it reaches America depends upon
the Axis subs.
As far as home-grown wool is
concerned, the picture is even less
bright. The supply of domestic wool
available to the civilian population
has been cut to between 30 and 40
per cent of the former amount.
