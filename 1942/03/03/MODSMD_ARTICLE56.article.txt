# Sun Glasses Appear On Tennis Courts
## 
### 
Some tennis players who are both
ered by the hot or very bright sun
find it convenient to wear sun
glasses (the white rimmed ones are
the smartest) or sun visor or tennis
cap.
The tennis cap gives that jockey
effect which is pert and becoming
to small girls while another form
sometimes called a "fisherman's hat"
is more like a bucket hat with a
floppy brim and is worn by those
who like an original nonchalant
effect.
