# Help Win War By Economizing On Cosmetics
## 
### 
This spring, things in the cosmetic
field are going to be different. The
chemist has other concerns and, due
to the difficulty in obtaining some
of the materials for the production
of cosmetics, the main trend is higher
prices plus luxury tax. Therefore,
the first corollary for spring make
up is to purchase carefully with a
definite make-up plan in mind and
don't go wild over six new lipstick
shades at once.
Choose one that suits perfectly
and buy defense stamps with the
change.
SHORTAGE NO WORRY
Don't worry about what is going
to happen to the American woman
when the present supply of 'paint' is
exhausted. Many American firms
foresaw the imminent shortage of
raw materials and laid in a supply
great enough to last for a few years.
The search is on for new synthetics
to take the place of unobtainables.
Formulas are undergoing revision
wherever possible to omit the use of
decreasing and irreplacable ingredi
ents. One result, has been the sim
plification of beauty aids.
LIPSTICK IN FRUITS
The lipsticks on counters now,
however, sound like the array at a
fruit market as 'Blackberry,' 'Mul
berry,' and 'Wineberry.' Other
manufacturers have gone patriotic
with 'Flagship,' 'Atttcntion Red,'
'Patriotic Red,' and 'AH Clear Red.'
Or they prefer to strike the imagi
nation of the purchaser and suggest
"that you ke gay in 'Skylark' or 'Pink
Carnelia'."
THOUGHT SAVER TAGS
A new time and thought saver arc
the tags on the new spring clothes.
They are the brainchild of a group
of manufacturers in the fashion
world. They enable you, at a glance,
to match all your acceccories, but
most important, select your make-up
including lipstick and nail polish be
you conservative or otherwise (they
leave that choice up to you) for that
particular costume. Saves a lot of
trials and errors.
Hands are going to be busier now
than ever before. You'll want no in
terference from too-long fingernails,
so keep them finger-tip length. Buf
fing, a lost art that's due for revival,
is still one of the best ways to stimu
late the circulation in the nails and
cuticle.
