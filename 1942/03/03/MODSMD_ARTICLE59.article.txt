# Stanford Women Knit Again, This Time for Their Men
## 
### 
Stanford women arc beginning to knit again. They are knitting not for
the Red Cross or for themselves but for their men. And 110 one is* more
surprised than the men.
After the first sweater, the beginner can't wait to try socks. After the
socks, she can't wait to try a cablestitch or ribbed sweater, or one of angora

wool. Knitting gradually becomes a ;
sort of Frankenstein monster, espe- !
cially for those who take naturally
to it.
MITTEN KNITTING FUN
Articles which are, according to j
those who have made them, loads of
fun to knit arc mittens which arc
knit with the same of pattern
as the ski sweaters. These can be
knit in any color or colors and, quote,
are easy if you watch the pattern
chart, unquote. These arc very beau
tiful, and also warm.
One experienced knitter was trav
eling on a train and she took two
sweaters with her to knit. The col
lege student, male, across the aisle
watched her knit for a while. Then
he saw the other sweater in her
knitting hag and offered to knit on j
it for a while.
FEAR IN HER HEART
With fear in her heart for the fate
of her sweater-to-be, she gave it to
him to knit on. To her complete
amazement, he looked at the sweater
and then proceeded to knit evenly
and faster than she was knitting.
In explanation, let it be said that
the student was in Med School and
was preparing for surgery. The knit
ting kept his fingers limber for sur
gery.
KNITTING HIT BY WAR
Knitting, however, has been hit by
the war. Wool is hard to get, as the j
Red Cross is beginning to discover. ]
Angora is practically impossible to i
get and cashmere is almost as hard j
to obtain. The only grey spot in the j
dark clouds is that Shetland will con- j
tinue to be obtainable for some time.
As if the wool shortage were not i
enough in itself, there is a threatened J
shortage of needles because many of |
them arc made of that scarce ma- j
terial, steel. Circular needles threaten
to disappear almost entirely, but
there will be straight needles made
of wood, plastics, and other non
defense materials.
But while the wool and needles
last, the women are going full speed
ahead with their knitting. The Stan- !
ford woman is beginning to knit and j
she is amazed to find that she likes it.

surprised than the men.
After the first sweater, the beginner can't wait to try socks. After the
socks, she can't wait to try a cablestitch or ribbed sweater, or one of angora

wool. Knitting gradually becomes a ;
sort of Frankenstein monster, espe- !
cially for those who take naturally
to it.
MITTEN KNITTING FUN
Articles which are, according to j
those who have made them, loads of
fun to knit arc mittens which arc
knit with the same of pattern
as the ski sweaters. These can be
knit in any color or colors and, quote,
are easy if you watch the pattern
chart, unquote. These arc very beau
tiful, and also warm.
One experienced knitter was trav
eling on a train and she took two
sweaters with her to knit. The col
lege student, male, across the aisle
watched her knit for a while. Then
he saw the other sweater in her
knitting hag and offered to knit on j
it for a while.
FEAR IN HER HEART
With fear in her heart for the fate
of her sweater-to-be, she gave it to
him to knit on. To her complete
amazement, he looked at the sweater
and then proceeded to knit evenly
and faster than she was knitting.
In explanation, let it be said that
the student was in Med School and
was preparing for surgery. The knit
ting kept his fingers limber for sur
gery.
KNITTING HIT BY WAR
Knitting, however, has been hit by
the war. Wool is hard to get, as the j
Red Cross is beginning to discover. ]
Angora is practically impossible to i
get and cashmere is almost as hard j
to obtain. The only grey spot in the j
dark clouds is that Shetland will con- j
tinue to be obtainable for some time.
As if the wool shortage were not i
enough in itself, there is a threatened J
shortage of needles because many of |
them arc made of that scarce ma- j
terial, steel. Circular needles threaten
to disappear almost entirely, but
there will be straight needles made
of wood, plastics, and other non
defense materials.
But while the wool and needles
last, the women are going full speed
ahead with their knitting. The Stan- !
ford woman is beginning to knit and j
she is amazed to find that she likes it.
Stanford women arc beginning to knit again. They are knitting not for
the Red Cross or for themselves but for their men. And 110 one is* more
surprised than the men.
