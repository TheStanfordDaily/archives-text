# In Spring a Coed's Fancy Turns to Play-and Play Clothes
## 
### 

THREE TIMES tailored and once fluffy, the play-clothes pass in review above. Toni Townsend, far left, lounges in
! Magnin's banana yellow two-piece slack suit, and Moofie Faris, next to her, wears a citrus yellow acetate short suit
irimmed in red, for bicycling, also from I. Magnin. Third in line is Nancy Burkett in white sharkskin shorts, and striped
Mazer shirt, from the White House. And Sue Talbert, seated far right, is feminine in a patchwork print skirt, dotted
Swiss peasant blouse, and wooden-soled shoes, from the White House, too.
