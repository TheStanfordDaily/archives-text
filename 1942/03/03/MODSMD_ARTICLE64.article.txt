# Stanford Male Defends Jeans Tradition As Symbol of Conquering Rough Appeal
## 
### BY AL HAMPSON 
To deal with the clothes of the
Stanford male from the male's point
of view is so simple that it is almost
an ohviosity. I will not devote this
dissertation to why people wear
clothes. That is something that I
sometimes find hard to decide and
then when I take a shower I find
the solution.
This dissertation is to discuss
men's clothes from the men's point
of view although, as I have said, it
is almost below the dignity of any
good, jean-wearing male.
[ suppose that I will be called on j
to defend the pair of faded jeans.
BASIC PREMISE
To defend the jeans, one first has i
to understand the basic premise be- !
hind the wearing of the jeans.
Since this is a spring fashion edi
tion, I will devote myself to defend
ing the wearing of jeans in the
spring. I neglected to say that, lack
ing originality, I too will revert to
the time-hackneyed fight over jeans.
But, unlike my predecessors, I am
going to treat it from a different way.
Rather than attacking the jeans in
terms of whether or not the Stan
ford woman is tradition-bound to
wear silk stockings on the Quad, 1
will treat them in an abstract way.
No, I am going to discuss the jeans
in terms of the reasons which make
the wearer, in this case the Stan
ford male, wear them.
ftlost of us will concede that wind
-1 :o\\n beauty is tho best kind. And
so must Stanford men think that
sc\-appeal is gotten from being rug
ged, and being rugged is gotten from
wearing jeans, is the best kind of
S. A. There is one solution to the
problem.
If women don't like the jeans that J
n:rn wear then they must find some
way to make the men feel rugged i
other than the wearing of faded
jeans. As you can see, the wearing |
of jeans is primarily a defense me- I
i hanism.
Then there are other reasons for
the wearing of jeans. It is tradition. '
Stanford is the school of roughs, j
What if these roughs just wore the j
typical cashmere sweaters and no ;
jeans? Would Stanford be the school
of roughs anymore? Naturally not. !
So they have to wear jeans.
WOMEN STUPID
Women are so unreasonable. They '
expect that men should gussy them
fives up just because the women
ore stupid enough to dress, paint

and mascara until the original is un
recognizable.
Not men. Their fathers came here
and captured Stanford women and
they wore dirty cords and other
rough-like clothes. So why shouldn't
the son carry on this tradition? Thus
he would please hi.s father by so do
ing and, at the same time, meet with
the successes that his father did.
Then, too, there is the question of
comfort. There are some men who
claim that comfort is the sole reason
for their wearing jeans. But then
we know that all these factors which
have been mentioned figure in the
wearing of jeans.
Now jeans are comfortable if one
knows how to wear them. Most
people make the mistake of trying
to wear jeans the same place (hey
would wear suspender-cut tuxedo
pants. Jeans are not designed to be
worn there.
They are to be worn on the hips
and not as some people thinkâ€”at
the waist line.
Although the women, the cleaning
agents, and everyone of any impor
tance may crab at the Stanford man's
wearing jeans, I offer up one shred
of evidence that no one can deny.
Wouldn't everyone prefer that the
Stanford male wear his faded jeans
and imagine himself a rough rather
than be well dressed by present

standards with sky blue pants, a light
green sport coat, and some flimsy
white shirt?
No. Give me a pair of jeans.
