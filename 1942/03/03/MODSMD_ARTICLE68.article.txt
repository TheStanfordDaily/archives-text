# Penmanship Prints, Zodiac Belts Made
## 
### 
We see almost everything in prints
today but the newest unsual print is
that which has copied the penman
ship exercises we used to do in
grammar school.
New to the world of belts is the
astronomical belt which possesses
all the signs of the zodiac with your
own particular month indicated on
the combination chart-buckle in the
middle.
