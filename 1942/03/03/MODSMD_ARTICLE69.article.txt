# Wool, Silk Priorities Hit Farm; Roughs to Wear Cuffless Pants
## 
### 
The pinch of war will he fell sharply in the Stanford man's wardrobe
this spiing. Reports from clothing manufacturers und retailers all tell
the same story—nothing available in silk, little wool, and drastic curtail
ment of styles and colors.
Silk is definitely out. Of the silk substitutes which have been developed,

very little material will reach the'
domestic market. Parachutes and
other military needs will use most of
the nylon and rayon available.
Wool is next on the clothing pri
orities list.
FEWER STYLES
This means a sharp reduction in
woolen suits and overcoats. Not
only will the supply of tweeds,
serges, worsteds, herringbones, gab
ardines, and flannels diminish, but
only a few styles will be available
as clothing machinery is busy mak
ing uniforms.
Trousers will soon appear on the
market without cuffs, coats without
pockets, and production has already
ceased on double-breasted overcoats
and will cease soon on vests.
STANDARD COLORS
And we face a drastic cut in colors
available in men's clothing. Dyes
are badly needed by both the army
and navy. Prospect for the future
is a few standard colors—black, blue,
brown, and grey—in a few standard
styles—single and double-breasted
and sport.
The only big clothing material
which is not at a premium is cotton.
There is plenty of cotton available
as the United States produces almost
half the world's supply. With silk,
rayon, and wool content in clothing
fast decreasing—cotton content will
rise.
COTTON PREDOMINANT
All shirts, shorts, neckties, socks,
handkerchiefs, and sports clothing
will be made from cotton. Suits and
overcoats will be manufactured from
reclaimed wool and cotton.
As gloomy as the c'othing pros
pects are, the real pinch will be felt
on the feet. For leather is almost as
difficult to obtain as wool. And ci
vilian orders must wait in line be
hind rush orders for tens of millions
of shoes for the services. Rubber
heels are out, and a composition heel
is taking their place.
From his head to his feet, the
Stanford man will be less colorful,
less "Esquirish," and considerably
less than all wool this spring.
