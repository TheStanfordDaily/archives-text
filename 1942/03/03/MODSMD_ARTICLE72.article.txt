# Simplicity Keynotes Spectator Fashions
## 
### 
The key to spectator sports Ls, this
j year as always, casualness and tai
i lored simplicity. Every line of rlress
has adopted this theme during these
days of war but spectator fashions
still lead the field. There is a va
riety of fabrics, colors and styles but
| they are still essentially the same as
â€¢ at year in that they are classics
| that never go out.
Suits, of course, are still the fa
vorite costume in this line. For
spring you will find numerous
tweeds, plaids, and solid colored,
light-weight woo! ones. Pastels are,
j as ever, the right touch for thLs time
|of year but there are many gay,
bright colors fur those who wish to
be different and a little daring. Pot
| tery shades in solid color suits or
mixed skirts and jackets will be
popular.
For chilly days or evenings, a plaid
coat over your pastel suit is just the
thing, the plaid picking up the basic
color of the suit. Cardigan jackets
to your suits add the right touch;
they not only look cool and com
j fortable, but are.
