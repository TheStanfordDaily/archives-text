## 
### 
Students have taken to square
toed "baby" shoes like wildfire this
season. And now a well-known shoo
manufacturer has offered a tempting
new date version.
r I he prize is a perky square-toed
pump of baby calf with open heels.
The platform sole Ls studded with
shining nails. Some people are ef
fervescing over the fresh parsely
color in which they may be had
with matching belts and bags.
