Rough-legged chairs in our dining
halts are doing their part to defeat
the Japs, lor silk stockings with runs
have lately become valuable down
on the Farm. Stanford women have
begun to save their ready-to-throw
away stockings to further national
defense efforts.
It seems the stockings are used in
the production of emergency
stretchers. So appears a new way
for sororities and halls to donate
toward the success of the war.
