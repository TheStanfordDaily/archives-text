# Simplicity Characterizes Gowns at War Weddings
## Bridal Attire Lines Emphasize Slimness 
### 
Something old, something new, and
a groom in uniform!
Even though the average prospec
tive husband has ceased worrying
about Oxford jackets and cutaways,
the bride, having found military
weddings exceptionally popular these
days, now faces the problem of find
ing a wedding gown which will make
her as sparkling and shining on her
way to the altar as the accompany
ing gold braid and brass buttons.
And the most popular and fash
ionable answer is a wedding gown
that is almost nunlike in its extreme
simplicity, sparse of trimming, clean
cut in silhouette, a perfect foil for
the use of luxurious and elegant
fabrics.
SLIM WAISTLINES
The war season's wedding waist
line looks like a mere hand-span
above the jutting peplums, and the
shoulders slope softly above neck
lines veiled to the throat or framed
in a deep square. Flowing trains
give the illusion of slimness despite
generous yardage.
One of the smartest trimmings is
old-fashioned soutache braid which
can be beautifully applied on slip
per satin as bodice and peplum edg
ing.
LATIN INFLUENCE
Another inspiration comes from
our neighbors to the South. Lace
as either a trimming or a whole
gown fits smoothly into the spring
picture. And seed pearls, simulating
Mexican peasant embroidery, arc
made into bands for a brand new
idea in wedding gown trimming. This
is particularly effective on heavy
stand-alone fabrics such as faille and
taffeta.
One of the newest ideas in wed
ding pageantry for these times is a
bride in Alice Blue satin whose mod
ern-version attendants wear short
length formal suits of dusk-blue vel
veteen, making an unusual counter
point for her.
SATIN, BROCADE RIVAL
Another exquisite gown for a ra
diant bride is of simple ivory white

satin with chantilly lace edging the
wrists, front panels of the skirt, and
completely circumscribing the train.
Although slipper satin is still hold
ing its own as fabric favorite, bro
cade is proving a close rival. One
lovely wedding gown is fashioned in

J bow and lily brocade with a sheath
! tight basque and hooped skirt. Its
| period-inspired look is heightened
: with a long-tibred veil caught un
| der a baroque tiara of pearly Lily
!of the Valley.
Nunlike severity has left its mark


GRACIOUS AND LOVELY will be the bride who wears
this informal gown with novelty lace bodice and full net
skirt caught with bows. The veil falls to her fingertips
from a shirred halo. Worn by Sue Talbert.â€”Livingston
