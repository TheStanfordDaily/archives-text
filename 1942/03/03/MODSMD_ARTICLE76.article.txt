# Headdress Follows Plain, Severe Trend

on headdresses as well. Many of the
new ones are designed to form a stif
fened squared-off coif effect which
sharply outlines hair and face. These,
however, look best with cither pom
padour or extremely plain hairdoes.
VEILS AND BOUQUETS
Wedding veils have been admir
ably adapted to tiny rolled-brim
hats and pillboxes made of the same
material as the wedding gown.
As far as wedding bouquets are
concerncd, the first consideration
must naturally be the setting and
season. But two of the loveliest
stark white flowers are the newly
developed clear white roses and the
recently exploited tropical Lilies of
the Amazon.
Generally speaking the smaller,
gracefully arranged bouquets of un
usual flowers have become smarter
than either tight conventional old
fashioned nose-gays or large arm
bouquets.
DRESS RULES PERSIST
Despite uniformed grooms, general
rules as to the type of dress for the
bride for both daytime and evening
weddings persist.
For a formal daytime wedding the
bride wears a gown with a long
train, a long veil, and gloves, unless
the gown has full-length sleeves.
For a semi-formal wedding gloves
are optional and veils are only fin
ger-tip or shoulder length. At an
informal wedding, a dress of either
formal afternoon or street length is
worn with a hat, and the bride wears
a corsage instead of carrying a bou
quet.
Formal and semi-formal evening
weddings follow the same plan as
daytime weddings. However, at an
informal evening wedding the bride
wears a dress of evening length, a
matching hat, and usually carries a
small bouquet.
Purses this spring emphasize
wartime practicability; they are big
ger and more commodious with sim
plicity and utility the keynotes to
fashion smartness.
