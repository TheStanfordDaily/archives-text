# Wedding Ring Styles Return To Few Stones, Plain Settings
## 
### 
All out simplicity scorns to he the keynote in engagement and wedding
rings for this spring and fuf the duration. The Nazi invasion of Holland
has even affected American weddings, because with the Dutch diamond
cutters no longer able to work at their former wage scale, rings complicated
with many stones and fancy work arc no longer on the market.

Styles in wedding and engagement
rings are now going back to older
designs and probably this Juno's
bride will wear a wedding ring lit
tle different from that which her
mother wears.
LARGER STONES
Some jewelers even foresee an era
in which rings will contain no stones
at all, but will be made to look as if
they had them. But this is a prob
lem for the jewelers to cope with.
The stones in diamond engagement
rings will be larger, because the cost
of cutting smaller ones is not worth
the price modern grooms will be able
to pay. And then there is that 10
per cent federal jewelry lax, too!
The mountings are also going back
to the old styles, with a modern ver
sion of the old Tiffany mounting be
coming more popular.
GOLD I OK PLATINUM
Another interesting trend in wed
ding and engagement rings is the
change from platinum to gold, almost
entirely. This new style is helping
National Defense because it leaves
the government more platinum, and
also more iridium which was for
merly used to harden platinum used
in jewelry. Coral gold is also being
used again, but it is not so popular.
So, according to the jewelers, the
war may be having quite an effect
on weddings, but it's also showing
its influence in engagement and wed
ding rings.
