# Walking Saves Posture, Tires
## 
### ROMIE BROWN 
Stanford women as a group are
healthy and stand up straight, ac
cording to Dr. Helen B. Pryor.
So do your part and keep up the
good work.
One way to help out and keep lit
too is to hide those car keys and
walk—walk to the Quad, walk to
the post office, even walk to Paly if
you're feeling ambitious. This is
good for those tires, too.
And sleep—surprising what it does
for your morale, as well as for those
circles under your eyes.
Posture, too. plays an important
part in health. The old saying,
"keep your chin up" is good sense.
If you stand up straight you'll not
only look better—you'll feel better.
Poor posture leads to poor circula
tion. If your eyes get tired easily
notice your posture. If you are
slumped over that might be the rea
son, because, if you slouch over your
desk, your circulation will be bad,
your eyes won't have enough blood,
and they will tire easily.
In this total war make the slogan
for Stanford women total health. Do
your part by keeping fit. Get out
those dumb-bells and get to work.
