# RAINBOW COMBINATIONS
## 
### 
It's a call to colors this spring, with
all-out aid for styleâ€”bright exciting
colors from hat to shoes, with stripes
as popular as ever! If color isn't
enough, try some new and different
combinations like pink with Kelly
green, or red and chartreuse with
green, or lavender with turquoise.
If it gets away from you, tone it
down with white gloves or brig;
black is also always good with
colors.
