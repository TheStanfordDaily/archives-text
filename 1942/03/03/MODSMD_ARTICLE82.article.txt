# Formals Emphasize Color for Morale; Splashy Prints Outdo Subdued Styles
## 
### 
Splashy prints with daring color
contrasts is the theme of evening
dresses this spring for they are al
ready racing ahead of the outdated
subdued colors. "Cheerful colors"
make "cheerful people," and in the
national emergency women's apparel
will emphasize color as it has never
done for it is important to morale.
Spring fashions are being stream
lined for wartime and though "for
mals" must be feminine, the elimin
ation of waste is primary; frills and
furbelows to an excess will be out
of place and there will be a sound
investment in fashions rather than
unreasonable extravagances in exe
treme styles.
Cottons, silk jerseys, and taffetas
again step up as the most popular
materials, while lace and net are be
ing used for more formal wear.
Probably the newest creation is the
evening dress made from chintz on
which the gayest patterns imagin
able are stamped. Many of the lat
est dresses are sporting faille inserts
which aid in the contrast of mate
rials and colors which is the primary
"do" in fashion this spring.
VOLUMINOUS SKIRTS
Harper's Bazaar says it's long skirts
for evenings in and short for eve
nings out. Enormous full skirts can
still float to the floor at the Spring
dances and the southern belle influ
ence can remain supreme for, as ev
ery fashion expert says, we are go
ing to make ourselves more lovely,
more glamorous and more interest
ing than ever before.
One of the latest creations in
spring "formals" which the Ameri
can farmer has inspired is the full
skirted chintz dress on which the
flowers of the pattern are outlined by
sequins. The delightful designs
flaunt colors of gayety and bright
ness and the simple lines on which
these dresses are made are definitely
feminine. The waist tends toward
£hc Scarlett O'Hara ideal of being as
«;iy as possible while the sleeves are
£hall straps off the shoulder giving
a formal impression. The sequins
outlining the patterns seem to be an
odd contrast but the effect is pleas
ing.
CANDY STRIPES
Candy striped and pin striped taf
fetas are still the vogue and are
flourishing in all of the exclusive
New York models. Checks, flow
ered prints and taffetas are also com
ing into their own. Many of the
dresses being shown in Palo Alto
flaunt a full taffeta skirt, a band
around the waist of faille and a plain
shirtmaker top.
Jersey prints remain as popular
as ever although even more startling
contrasts are seen in color combina
tion, the favorite being a bright print
top. a faille insert at the waist, con
sisting of some dark basic shade, and
a graceful Grecian skirt in a plain
pastel color.
Lace and net dresses are still put
ling in their bid for special attention
and you can never go wrong by
hanging one in your closet. The
South American influence is seen in
the lovely lace creations of black or
white lace over vivid clear colors,
such as electric blues and warm sap
phire blue. Clear pretty pastels or
white Italian lace are also psycho
logically feminine, and effective.
DINNER SUITS
An ideal outfit for a spring campus
wardrobe is a smart dinner suit.
One in particular was reviewed by
Sylva Weaver, a leading California
stylist. A navy skirt has full, grace
ful folds which give a slimming ef
fect as well as allowing plenty of
freedom for walking or dancing. A
trim little white blouse is partially
covered by a tailored, long sleeved
waist-length jacket which is red, as

is the belt. The jacket has notched
lapels and the applique upon it is in
white.
An outfit similar to this is a "best
bet" for college students for it is
adaptable for a variety of places and
occasions. It can be packed neatly
and is suitable for almost any din
ner or dancing date.
GRECIAN STYLES
A more formal grown which is in
spirational in effect is created along
with the South American influence.
Preferably of crepe which gives that
"Grecian" figure, it has sheath-fitting
lines, with draped girdle and slender
slit skirt. Graceful shawl-style
sleeves add to the effect for they are
fringed with white just below the el
bow.
Because of the nation's plentiful
supply of raw cotton and the scarcity
of dry cleaning fluids cottons will be
more popular than ever. They are
inexpensive and practical for they
can be washed and ironed so that
they are as pert and fresh as when
they are first worn. Heart shaped
neck lines prevail while the formal
effect is given because of the tiny
delicate straps over the shoulders.
According to fashion experts the
necks of dinner dresses are getting
lower, the skirts shorter. Howard
Greer, a Beverly Hills couturier, be
lieves that the long-short is a new
silhouette that is in keeping with
wartime needs. The "long short" re
fers to a dinner dress which is very
short in front, 19 inches long in back,
just nine inches from the floor, and
is decorated with feminine frills. The
new long elbow length gloves are an
essential accessory for the costume.
HAREM SKIRTS
While on the subject of thrilling
new turns of fashion, the dramatic
ally effective harem skirt is being
shown in shop windows. Also along
the same line is the ballerina dress
which is as effective as its name.
The skirt is extremely full, about

nine inches from the floor, while the
bodice is tight and shapely.
According to Irene, one of the
leading designers of the country, it
is the patriotic duty for every woman
to enhance her charm during this
period, to wear more graceful, more
appealing clothes.
And so Spring evening fashions

skirted chintz dress on which the
flowers of the pattern are outlined by
sequins. The delightful designs
flaunt colors of gayety and bright
ness and the simple lines on which
these dresses are made are definitely
feminine. The waist tends toward
£hc Scarlett O'Hara ideal of being as
«;iy as possible while the sleeves are
£hall straps off the shoulder giving
a formal impression. The sequins
outlining the patterns seem to be an
odd contrast but the effect is pleas
ing.
CANDY STRIPES
Candy striped and pin striped taf
fetas are still the vogue and are
flourishing in all of the exclusive
New York models. Checks, flow
ered prints and taffetas are also com
ing into their own. Many of the
dresses being shown in Palo Alto
flaunt a full taffeta skirt, a band
around the waist of faille and a plain
shirtmaker top.
Jersey prints remain as popular
as ever although even more startling
contrasts are seen in color combina

top. a faille insert at the waist, con
sisting of some dark basic shade, and
a graceful Grecian skirt in a plain
pastel color.
Lace and net dresses are still put
ling in their bid for special attention
and you can never go wrong by
hanging one in your closet. The
South American influence is seen in
the lovely lace creations of black or
white lace over vivid clear colors,
such as electric blues and warm sap
phire blue. Clear pretty pastels or
white Italian lace are also psycho
logically feminine, and effective.
DINNER SUITS
An ideal outfit for a spring campus
wardrobe is a smart dinner suit.
One in particular was reviewed by
Sylva Weaver, a leading California
stylist. A navy skirt has full, grace
ful folds which give a slimming ef
fect as well as allowing plenty of
freedom for walking or dancing. A
trim little white blouse is partially
covered by a tailored, long sleeved
waist-length jacket which is red, as

is the belt. The jacket has notched
lapels and the applique upon it is in
white.
An outfit similar to this is a "best
bet" for college students for it is
adaptable for a variety of places and
occasions. It can be packed neatly
and is suitable for almost any din
ner or dancing date.
GRECIAN STYLES
A more formal grown which is in
spirational in effect is created along
with the South American influence.
Preferably of crepe which gives that
"Grecian" figure, it has sheath-fitting
lines, with draped girdle and slender
slit skirt. Graceful shawl-style
sleeves add to the effect for they are
fringed with white just below the el
bow.
Because of the nation's plentiful
supply of raw cotton and the scarcity
of dry cleaning fluids cottons will be
more popular than ever. They are
inexpensive and practical for they
can be washed and ironed so that
they are as pert and fresh as when
they are first worn. Heart shaped
neck lines prevail while the formal
effect is given because of the tiny
delicate straps over the shoulders.
According to fashion experts the
necks of dinner dresses are getting
lower, the skirts shorter. Howard
Greer, a Beverly Hills couturier, be
lieves that the long-short is a new
silhouette that is in keeping with
wartime needs. The "long short" re
fers to a dinner dress which is very
short in front, 19 inches long in back,
just nine inches from the floor, and
is decorated with feminine frills. The
new long elbow length gloves are an
essential accessory for the costume.
HAREM SKIRTS
While on the subject of thrilling
new turns of fashion, the dramatic
ally effective harem skirt is being
shown in shop windows. Also along
the same line is the ballerina dress
which is as effective as its name.
The skirt is extremely full, about

nine inches from the floor, while the
bodice is tight and shapely.
According to Irene, one of the
leading designers of the country, it
is the patriotic duty for every woman
to enhance her charm during this

For campus formals it will be full

skirt, as well as the old stand by,
the tailored dinner dress.
Splashy prints with daring color
contrasts is the theme of evening
dresses this spring for they are al
ready racing ahead of the outdated
subdued colors. "Cheerful colors"
make "cheerful people," and in the
national emergency women's apparel
will emphasize color as it has never
done for it is important to morale.
Spring fashions are being stream
lined for wartime and though "for
mals" must be feminine, the elimin
ation of waste is primary; frills and
furbelows to an excess will be out
of place and there will be a sound
investment in fashions rather than
unreasonable extravagances in exe
treme styles.
Cottons, silk jerseys, and taffetas
again step up as the most popular
materials, while lace and net are be

Probably the newest creation is the
evening dress made from chintz on
which the gayest patterns imagin

which aid in the contrast of mate

"do" in fashion this spring.

wardrobe is a smart dinner suit.
One in particular was reviewed by
Sylva Weaver, a leading California
stylist. A navy skirt has full, grace
ful folds which give a slimming ef
fect as well as allowing plenty of
freedom for walking or dancing. A
trim little white blouse is partially
covered by a tailored, long sleeved
waist-length jacket which is red, as

is the belt. The jacket has notched
lapels and the applique upon it is in
white.
An outfit similar to this is a "best
bet" for college students for it is
adaptable for a variety of places and
occasions. It can be packed neatly
and is suitable for almost any din
ner or dancing date.
GRECIAN STYLES
A more formal grown which is in
spirational in effect is created along
with the South American influence.
Preferably of crepe which gives that
"Grecian" figure, it has sheath-fitting
lines, with draped girdle and slender
slit skirt. Graceful shawl-style
sleeves add to the effect for they are
fringed with white just below the el
bow.
Because of the nation's plentiful
supply of raw cotton and the scarcity
of dry cleaning fluids cottons will be
more popular than ever. They are
inexpensive and practical for they
can be washed and ironed so that
they are as pert and fresh as when
they are first worn. Heart shaped
neck lines prevail while the formal
effect is given because of the tiny
delicate straps over the shoulders.
According to fashion experts the
necks of dinner dresses are getting
lower, the skirts shorter. Howard
Greer, a Beverly Hills couturier, be
lieves that the long-short is a new
silhouette that is in keeping with
wartime needs. The "long short" re
fers to a dinner dress which is very
short in front, 19 inches long in back,
just nine inches from the floor, and
is decorated with feminine frills. The
new long elbow length gloves are an
essential accessory for the costume.
HAREM SKIRTS
While on the subject of thrilling
new turns of fashion, the dramatic
ally effective harem skirt is being
shown in shop windows. Also along
the same line is the ballerina dress
which is as effective as its name.
The skirt is extremely full, about

nine inches from the floor, while the
bodice is tight and shapely.
According to Irene, one of the
leading designers of the country, it
is the patriotic duty for every woman
to enhance her charm during this
period, to wear more graceful, more
appealing clothes.
And so Spring evening fashions
will go hand in hand with bright
colors and femininity for men and
morale—full skirts, soft lines, neck
lines cut formally, in materials that
are as fresh looking as spring itself.
For campus formals it will be full
skirted, print evening dresses; for
dinner parties the exciting new
"short-long" dress, or the harem
skirt, as well as the old stand by,
the tailored dinner dress.
Splashy prints with daring color
contrasts is the theme of evening
dresses this spring for they are al
ready racing ahead of the outdated
subdued colors. "Cheerful colors"
make "cheerful people," and in the
national emergency women's apparel
will emphasize color as it has never
done for it is important to morale.
Spring fashions are being stream
lined for wartime and though "for
mals" must be feminine, the elimin
ation of waste is primary; frills and
furbelows to an excess will be out
of place and there will be a sound
investment in fashions rather than
unreasonable extravagances in exe
treme styles.
Cottons, silk jerseys, and taffetas
again step up as the most popular
materials, while lace and net are be
ing used for more formal wear.
Probably the newest creation is the
evening dress made from chintz on
which the gayest patterns imagin
able are stamped. Many of the lat
est dresses are sporting faille inserts
which aid in the contrast of mate
rials and colors which is the primary
"do" in fashion this spring.
VOLUMINOUS SKIRTS
Harper's Bazaar says it's long skirts
for evenings in and short for eve
nings out. Enormous full skirts can
still float to the floor at the Spring
dances and the southern belle influ
ence can remain supreme for, as ev
ery fashion expert says, we are go
ing to make ourselves more lovely,
more glamorous and more interest
ing than ever before.
One of the latest creations in
spring "formals" which the Ameri
can farmer has inspired is the full
skirted chintz dress on which the
flowers of the pattern are outlined by
sequins. The delightful designs
flaunt colors of gayety and bright
ness and the simple lines on which
these dresses are made are definitely
feminine. The waist tends toward
£hc Scarlett O'Hara ideal of being as
«;iy as possible while the sleeves are
£hall straps off the shoulder giving
a formal impression. The sequins
outlining the patterns seem to be an
odd contrast but the effect is pleas
ing.
CANDY STRIPES
Candy striped and pin striped taf
fetas are still the vogue and are
flourishing in all of the exclusive
New York models. Checks, flow
ered prints and taffetas are also com
ing into their own. Many of the
dresses being shown in Palo Alto
flaunt a full taffeta skirt, a band
around the waist of faille and a plain
shirtmaker top.
Jersey prints remain as popular
as ever although even more startling
contrasts are seen in color combina
tion, the favorite being a bright print
top. a faille insert at the waist, con
sisting of some dark basic shade, and
a graceful Grecian skirt in a plain
pastel color.
Lace and net dresses are still put
ling in their bid for special attention
and you can never go wrong by
hanging one in your closet. The
South American influence is seen in
the lovely lace creations of black or
white lace over vivid clear colors,
such as electric blues and warm sap
phire blue. Clear pretty pastels or
white Italian lace are also psycho
logically feminine, and effective.

silhouette that is in keeping with
wartime needs. The "long short" re
fers to a dinner dress which is very
short in front, 19 inches long in back,
just nine inches from the floor, and
is decorated with feminine frills. The
new long elbow length gloves are an
essential accessory for the costume.
HAREM SKIRTS
While on the subject of thrilling
new turns of fashion, the dramatic
ally effective harem skirt is being
shown in shop windows. Also along
the same line is the ballerina dress
which is as effective as its name.
The skirt is extremely full, about

nine inches from the floor, while the
bodice is tight and shapely.
According to Irene, one of the
leading designers of the country, it
is the patriotic duty for every woman
to enhance her charm during this
period, to wear more graceful, more
appealing clothes.
And so Spring evening fashions
will go hand in hand with bright
colors and femininity for men and
morale—full skirts, soft lines, neck
lines cut formally, in materials that
are as fresh looking as spring itself.
For campus formals it will be full
skirted, print evening dresses; for
dinner parties the exciting new
"short-long" dress, or the harem
skirt, as well as the old stand by,
the tailored dinner dress.
Splashy prints with daring color
contrasts is the theme of evening
dresses this spring for they are al
ready racing ahead of the outdated
subdued colors. "Cheerful colors"
make "cheerful people," and in the
national emergency women's apparel
will emphasize color as it has never
done for it is important to morale.
Spring fashions are being stream
lined for wartime and though "for
mals" must be feminine, the elimin
ation of waste is primary; frills and
furbelows to an excess will be out
of place and there will be a sound
investment in fashions rather than
unreasonable extravagances in exe
treme styles.
Cottons, silk jerseys, and taffetas
again step up as the most popular
materials, while lace and net are be
ing used for more formal wear.
Probably the newest creation is the
evening dress made from chintz on
which the gayest patterns imagin
able are stamped. Many of the lat
est dresses are sporting faille inserts
which aid in the contrast of mate
rials and colors which is the primary
"do" in fashion this spring.
VOLUMINOUS SKIRTS
Harper's Bazaar says it's long skirts
for evenings in and short for eve
nings out. Enormous full skirts can
still float to the floor at the Spring
dances and the southern belle influ
ence can remain supreme for, as ev
ery fashion expert says, we are go
ing to make ourselves more lovely,
more glamorous and more interest
ing than ever before.
One of the latest creations in
spring "formals" which the Ameri
can farmer has inspired is the full
skirted chintz dress on which the
flowers of the pattern are outlined by
sequins. The delightful designs
flaunt colors of gayety and bright
ness and the simple lines on which
these dresses are made are definitely
feminine. The waist tends toward
£hc Scarlett O'Hara ideal of being as
«;iy as possible while the sleeves are
£hall straps off the shoulder giving
a formal impression. The sequins
outlining the patterns seem to be an
odd contrast but the effect is pleas
ing.
CANDY STRIPES
Candy striped and pin striped taf
fetas are still the vogue and are
flourishing in all of the exclusive
New York models. Checks, flow
ered prints and taffetas are also com
ing into their own. Many of the
dresses being shown in Palo Alto
flaunt a full taffeta skirt, a band
around the waist of faille and a plain
shirtmaker top.
Jersey prints remain as popular
as ever although even more startling
contrasts are seen in color combina
tion, the favorite being a bright print
top. a faille insert at the waist, con
sisting of some dark basic shade, and
a graceful Grecian skirt in a plain
pastel color.
Lace and net dresses are still put
ling in their bid for special attention
and you can never go wrong by
hanging one in your closet. The
South American influence is seen in
the lovely lace creations of black or
white lace over vivid clear colors,
such as electric blues and warm sap
phire blue. Clear pretty pastels or
white Italian lace are also psycho
logically feminine, and effective.
DINNER SUITS
An ideal outfit for a spring campus
wardrobe is a smart dinner suit.
One in particular was reviewed by
Sylva Weaver, a leading California
stylist. A navy skirt has full, grace
ful folds which give a slimming ef
fect as well as allowing plenty of
freedom for walking or dancing. A
trim little white blouse is partially
covered by a tailored, long sleeved
waist-length jacket which is red, as

is the belt. The jacket has notched
lapels and the applique upon it is in
white.
An outfit similar to this is a "best
bet" for college students for it is
adaptable for a variety of places and
occasions. It can be packed neatly
and is suitable for almost any din
ner or dancing date.
GRECIAN STYLES
A more formal grown which is in
spirational in effect is created along
with the South American influence.
Preferably of crepe which gives that
"Grecian" figure, it has sheath-fitting
lines, with draped girdle and slender
slit skirt. Graceful shawl-style
sleeves add to the effect for they are
fringed with white just below the el
bow.
Because of the nation's plentiful
supply of raw cotton and the scarcity
of dry cleaning fluids cottons will be
more popular than ever. They are
inexpensive and practical for they
can be washed and ironed so that
they are as pert and fresh as when
they are first worn. Heart shaped
neck lines prevail while the formal
effect is given because of the tiny
delicate straps over the shoulders.
According to fashion experts the
necks of dinner dresses are getting
lower, the skirts shorter. Howard
Greer, a Beverly Hills couturier, be
lieves that the long-short is a new
silhouette that is in keeping with
