# Gloves Are Longer For Street, Evening
## 
### 
Gloves, that finishing touch to a
well-groomed woman, axe longer
this spring—gauntlet length with
street clothes and way, way long for
evening. And the emphasis is all on
color—not pastels, but strong, bold,
eye-catching colors.
The wide color range is made
possible by the new trend toward
fabric gloves—cotton, rayon, and
suede. This trend, forced on fash
ion designers when the foreign
source of glove leather was cut off,
is paying rich dividends in color and
practicability. Washable and dye
fast fabric gloves ought to hit the
spot on that hard-pressed budget.
However, for those of us still par
tial to leather, there are enough
leather stocks on hand to meet the
demand. In the leather line doe
skin seems to lead the list with pig
skin running second.
Shoes for campus wear* are seen
with rope soles which are coming
into popularity to take the place of
rationed rubber.
