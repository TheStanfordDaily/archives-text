# Glamour Hints: Flower Halos, Wool Hairpins
## 
### 
New ideas for your clothes and
accessories are always interesting as
well as fun to work with. Here are
a few suggestions which are inex
pensive to try and need only a few
odds and ends from your store room
or the curio shop.
If you would be glamorous after
sundown, pick your flowers before
the sun gets on them and plunge
them into deep water. When you
are ready for your date, pin them
onto a broadcloth covered oval
foundation and wear them instead of
a hat, with or without a veil. They
have eye appeal as well as frag
rance.
UPHOLSTER TRIM
Outline the basque of a dress with
regular upholsterer's fringe, or if you
have a jumper, sew bright red or
green wool fringe onto the shoulder
suspenders.
Another idea with yarn is to
crochet bright wool outlines for big
old-fashioned hairpins and stab
them into the crown of your hat.
If you're looking for something
different in skirts, try sewing viv
idly. colored letters which spell
Freshman - Sophomore - Juniors -
Seniors in a circle about a solid color
full skirt. The names of prominent
universities will add a collegiate
note, or then there are patriotic
slogans.
PAISLEY SCARVES
Buy up half a dozen paisley or
light woven square scarves of the
same design and make a bright
spring dirindl. Bind them at the top
with a dark sash and wear them with
solid color shirts.
Instead of your much-used initials
on your shirts, embroider your class
year such as '45 onto the collars of
your shirts.
So useful when you have books
and binder to carry is the new trou
ble-shooter belt. Hang your purse,
keys and pen on it and keep your
hands free.
