# Lack of Materials To Shorten Skirts
## 
### 
The war is going to benefit those
girls with the shapely legs, accord
ing to latest fashion predictions.
The last war brought the skirt up
from the ankle to the knee, so who
knows what progress will be made
this time?
With material needed in defense
industries, skirts will become shorter
and slimmer than ever. Wool clothes
especially are at a premium, which
means that the new spring suits will
have more simple lines than before.
And as for the formals! Well, those
pretty ankles and those daring shoes
will have a chance to show them
selves now, for more and more
ankle-length evening dresses are
making their appearance.
