# Leg Make-Up Adds Pennies To Allowances
## 
### 
When the big silk stocking scarcity
first hit the country last summer,
everybody was very enthusiastic
about leg make-up. The Japs and
their silk worms could go to blazes
and the American girl would paint
herself a pair of stockings which
would last a week and add precious
pennies to her budget. We still have
the same opinion of the Japs, to say
the least, but the painted stockings
haven't worked out so well.
There are several objections to leg
make-up. In the first place, it is
hard to put on evenly, and it is es
sential for the desited effect that the
cream be applied smoothly.
MELTS IN SUN
Also it has not been made weather
proof, for if exposed to hot sun, it
will melt, and it runs in the rain.
Probably the most serious difficulty
/with painted stockings is that they
rub off onto clothes and upholstery.
The English women seem to be
using leg make-up quite extensively,
however; so there may be some hope
for it. In Britain, they solve the
difficulty of appliance by having it
put on in beauty shopts by profes
sionals. A seam is often drawn up
the back of the leg; so it is hard to
distinguish these applied stockings
from the real thing.
DIME STORE BRAND
For those who would like to try
stocking make-up in spite of its
drawbacks, it may be bought for a
few cents at the dime store or for
about a dollar at a beauty shop. The
more expensive kind is claimed to
be far superior, bearing such impres
sive names as Max Factor and
Helena Rubinstein.
Personally we feel that if you are
set against wearing real stockings,
which, after all, are not so very hard
to get, just acquire a good sun tan
and have one of your less nervous
friends draw a light line up your
leg. However, anyway you cover
your legs, from the sun, from a jar,
or from the coal fields, we can all
get along without any of those Jap
anese worms.
