# Washing Preserves Scarce Materials
## 
### 
College women have long since
heeded wise warnings to stock up
on silks: hose, shirts, slips, etc. But
even the most voluminous stocks
will last only if they are properly
cared for.
Fastidious laundering is a secret
of long wear and neat grooming.
Now that allowances are shrinking
along with papa's heavily taxed in
come, more women are saving pen
nies by doing their own laundry.
