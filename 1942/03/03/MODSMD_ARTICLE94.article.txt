# Faded Blue Denim Stars in Boathouse Fashions Featuring Copper-Studded, Mechanics' Overalls
## Pant Cuffs Button On 'Defenderettes' For Vigorous Play 
### IRMA CUNHA 
When that sunny, glorious season
hits the Farm, the thoughts of Stan
ford women naturally turn to the
latest styles in play clothes and
bathing suits. The ads in The Daily
look more exciting, and the shop
windows in Paly are tempting. And
from a casual tour through some of
Paly's shops, it looks as though new
styles are coming in, and fast.
On wandering into one of Paly's
shops, we found faded blue denim as
the main attraction in the way of
play clothes. Denim jackets, short
sleeved and long sleeved, denim
slacks, and shorts are offered in new
creations.
But the latest of all denini cre
ations comes in the name of de
fense and is known as the De
fenderette. This new coverall type
is a one piece outfit, with long
sleeves and pants. And its but
tons, copper eolored riveted nail
heads, arc very much of a new
thing this year.
The Defenderette buttons down the
front, at the arm cuff, and also con
veniently at the pant cuff. If Miss
Defenderette is doing something vig
orous where flapping pant legs would
get in her way, she can neatly gath
er her pant cuffs together.
CLAM DIGGERS
The new suspender type clam dig
gers also feature the copper colored
buttons. The suspenders are fast
ened about two inches above the
waist with these buttons. And then,
carrying out the theme perfectly,
there are two squarely cut front
pockets, each edged with small, cop
per colored rivets.
And to make those clam diggers
really stand out, the Farm woman
would have to get a torn boy or "t"
shirt. Incidentally, there aren't
many colors the new "t's" don't
come in: red and write, yellow and
white, green and white, and many
three color combinations.
Another attractive one piece suit
is the blue denim shorts-bra type.
Its already neat waistband is
brought out by a thin denim strip
fastened with a small copper col
ored buckle. The shorts are
smartly culTed, and the bra top is
severely v-shaped, fastened to the
back straps by large copper but
tons. This looks ideal for a day of
canoeing on the lake.
For the woman who wants indi
vidual shirts, shorts, and slacks,
there arc many varieties in the new
pale blue denim suits. In the way
of shorts there are loose fitting short
sleeved numbers. And there is the
sleeved type with cuffed but roomy
sleeves. There there are individual
slacks and shorts to be had, too.

For the woman whose eye natur
ally wander toward brighter colors,
there are striped denim pastels.
These two piece slack suits feature
pale blue slacks and short sleeved
striped jackets. The jackets come in
various color combinations and are
plain at the collar and cuffed sleeves.
As a final touch to her denim out
fit, the Farm woman can get a re
versible sailor type jacket. This is a
long sleeved jacket, blue on one side
and finely striped in red and white
on the other.
Besides these many denim attrac
tions we saw in this shop a whole
rack of ideal spring dresses for just
wandering around at the lake. These
sports dresses come in one or two
pieces with buttons down the front,
and in checks, stripes, seersuckers,
and plain colors.
When we wandered out into the
street again, we came upon a shop
window decked with bright per

manent finish glazed chintz out
fits—play dresses, play suits, and
bathing suits. These arc appealing
at first glance, but on closer in
vestigation seem even better.
The play dresses are two piece with
a very full skirt. And these skirts
are flattering to the waist line and
hips because the gathered Matletex
of the waistline is carried down a few
inches on the hips. The top of this
dress is a reversible bolero with the
print of the skirt on one side and a
plain, complementary color on the
other. Worn with a white sports
shirt this makes a practical but defi
nitely feminine dress for play.
I'LAY SUITS
The three piece play suits of that
same chintz material come in a rich
buttercup yellow. The shirts and
shorts are made in one piece, but
toning down the front. Then the
matching skirt can be slipped on or
off at will. This is an especially
