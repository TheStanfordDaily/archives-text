# Stores of Perfume Limited, Diminishing
## 
### 
Since the war broke out in France,
perfume manufacturers have shipped
their supply of already made per
fume and all of the essential oils
that they could get over to America
and arc packing it here. All of the
leading brands now state on the
box that the product was made in
Paris but packed in New York.
There arc still some bottles avail
able that were made and packed in
Paris, but these are becoming more
scarce all the time and soon will be
off the market entirely. All the new
stock coming onto the market now
has been packed in New York.
The supply of raw materials that
is in this country is estimated to last
about two years. After that time it
will be up to science to develop a
process for growing flowers from
which the necessary oils can be ex
tracted or else perfume, of the qual
ity of the imported type, will be
unavailable.
