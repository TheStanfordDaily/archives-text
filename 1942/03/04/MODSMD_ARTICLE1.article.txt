# Wilbur Urges Imperative Readjustments for Wartime Student Life, Government
## Candidates for A.S.S.U. Positions Should Plan to Register Summer Quarter, Chancellor Tells Excom 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Readjustments in athletics, elections, fraternity imitations and even
a revision of the A.S.S.U. Constitution and a severe tightening of the
Honor Code will be required if student government is to meet wartime
exigencies, Ex Committee and some 40 men and women student leaders
learned in the second annual informal discussion with Chancellor Ray

Lyman Wilbur at his home on Lagu
nita Knoll last night.
"Will student government re
main intact?" asked Bob Crary,
Family Call chairman.
' I think so," replied Dr. Wilbur,
"if you are careful. Student gov
ernment provides good training for
wartime leadership."

Questions of the student leaders
and Dr. Wilbur's answers follow:
PAT ADAMS: "How will the four
quarter basis affect our September
Pre-Reg program?"
Answer: "It is going to knock it
into a cocked hat. It will be neces
sary to have one in June, too."
DICK DRISCOLL: Will we have
R.O.T.C. as usual this summer?"
Answer: "Yes, and after gradu
ation students in the R.O.T.C. will
attend summer training camp for a
short period and then receive their
commissions."
BARBARA HORNER: "Will living
groups be open this summer?"
Answer: "Well, if they're smart
they will be."
808 CRARY: "Will the War De
partment take over?"
Answer: "No more than at pres
ent. We have the R.0.T.C., civilian
defense trainees at Sequoia Hall, and
a few soldiers stationed on-campus."
BERYL ROBISON: "Should we have
an orientation program for each
quarter?"
Answer: "Yes. It is important
that the students be familiar with
the Honor Code. Their record here
determines their recommendations
for the services; whether they will
get commissions or peel potatoes,"
IRMA JEAN HANNIBAL: "Should
we revise the constitution to a war
time constitution?"
Answer: "Yes, I would. Don't
leave the summer quarter flat—there
Will be lots of people here, which
will necessitate student govern
ment."
GHORGE JACKSON: "How many
men will fraternities lose?"
Answer: "No fraternities are on
the end of the limb financially, but
they will have to cut expenses and
some may have to unite. Fraterni
ties are in better shape here than at
any institution I know of."
Dr. Wilbur added he hoped there
would be an increase of women stu
dents here summer quarter, which
would materially affect the ratio and
necessitate a four-quarter sponsor
system.
DRISCOLL: "What about frater
nity initiations?"
Answer: "I think a good deal of
that tripe will go away—that's rub
bish."
DRISCOLL: "What, about Hell
Week?"
Answer: "The Japs will provide
the hell. We won't have time for a
good deal of that stuff."
RAY lIAMMETT: "Will student aid
be drastically cut?"
Answer: "I think it probably will
increase in one way or another, and
scholarships will probably go from
a three- to a four-quarter basis."
STAN OWEN: "Since Pearl Har
bor, Honor Code violations have be
come much worse. What should we
do?"
Answer: "Tighten up. If you get
a violator, bounce him out. If a man
who has cheated applies for a rec
ommendation for a commission in
the services, I can cut him off like
that," Dr. Wilbur said, snapping hi.s
fingers.

a three- to a four-quarter basis."
STAN OWEN: "Since Pearl Har
bor, Honor Code violations have be
come much worse. What should we
do?"
Answer: "Tighten up. If you get
a violator, bounce him out. If a man
who has cheated applies for a rec
ommendation for a commission in
the services, I can cut him off like
that," Dr. Wilbur said, snapping hi.s
fingers.
Readjustments in athletics, elections, fraternity imitations and even
a revision of the A.S.S.U. Constitution and a severe tightening of the
Honor Code will be required if student government is to meet wartime
exigencies, Ex Committee and some 40 men and women student leaders
learned in the second annual informal discussion with Chancellor Ray

Lyman Wilbur at his home on Lagu
nita Knoll last night.
"Will student government re
main intact?" asked Bob Crary,
Family Call chairman.
' I think so," replied Dr. Wilbur,
"if you are careful. Student gov
ernment provides good training for
wartime leadership."

Questions of the student leaders
and Dr. Wilbur's answers follow:
PAT ADAMS: "How will the four
quarter basis affect our September
Pre-Reg program?"
Answer: "It is going to knock it
into a cocked hat. It will be neces
sary to have one in June, too."
DICK DRISCOLL: Will we have
R.O.T.C. as usual this summer?"
Answer: "Yes, and after gradu
ation students in the R.O.T.C. will
attend summer training camp for a
short period and then receive their
commissions."
BARBARA HORNER: "Will living
groups be open this summer?"
Answer: "Well, if they're smart
they will be."
808 CRARY: "Will the War De
partment take over?"
Answer: "No more than at pres
ent. We have the R.0.T.C., civilian
defense trainees at Sequoia Hall, and
a few soldiers stationed on-campus."
BERYL ROBISON: "Should we have
an orientation program for each
quarter?"
Answer: "Yes. It is important
that the students be familiar with
the Honor Code. Their record here
determines their recommendations
for the services; whether they will
get commissions or peel potatoes,"
IRMA JEAN HANNIBAL: "Should
we revise the constitution to a war
time constitution?"
Answer: "Yes, I would. Don't
leave the summer quarter flat—there
Will be lots of people here, which
will necessitate student govern
ment."
GHORGE JACKSON: "How many
men will fraternities lose?"
Answer: "No fraternities are on
the end of the limb financially, but
they will have to cut expenses and
some may have to unite. Fraterni
ties are in better shape here than at
any institution I know of."
Dr. Wilbur added he hoped there
would be an increase of women stu
dents here summer quarter, which
would materially affect the ratio and
necessitate a four-quarter sponsor
system.
DRISCOLL: "What about frater
nity initiations?"
Answer: "I think a good deal of
that tripe will go away—that's rub
bish."
DRISCOLL: "What, about Hell
Week?"
Answer: "The Japs will provide
the hell. We won't have time for a
good deal of that stuff."
RAY lIAMMETT: "Will student aid
be drastically cut?"
Answer: "I think it probably will
increase in one way or another, and
scholarships will probably go from
a three- to a four-quarter basis."
