# JAPS CONTINUE PACIFIC ADVNCES
## 
### 

JAPANESE ADVANCES HAVE CONTINUED on almost all Pacific fronts although the Nipponese troops
arc meeting stern resistance in all sectors. Timor (I) is now completely in Japanese hands and being used
as a jumping-ofT place for attacks on northeast Java (2) where the Cierman-controlled Paris radio last
night credited "Japanese sources" with the claim that Soaerahaja naval base has heen captured. Allied lead
ers conceded yesterday that Batavia (3), capital city in northwest Java, will sooner or later fall into Nip
ponese hands. Reports from the Burma front (4) were conflicting, with the British claiming they were
holding everywhere and American flyers of the A.V.G. asserting bitterly that Burma was in chaos. On
the Bataan hattlcfront—where the Japs have made no headway for a month—there was "practically no
ground or air activity" yesterday.
