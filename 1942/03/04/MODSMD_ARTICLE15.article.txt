# De Witt Closes Military Areas To All Japs
## Proclamation Means A Gradual Eviction From Coastal Strip 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, March 3 (UP).
—The Army eventually will oust
American-bom Japanese as well as
enemy aliens from a vast military
area on the Pacific Coast established
in an anti-fifth column proclamation
today by Lieut. Gen. John L. De-
Witt, commander of the Fourth
Army.
Future orders will he issued re
quiring the evacuation of an esti
mated 70,000 Japanese of U.S. citi
zenship, 50,000 Japanese aliens and
unnumbered thousands of German
and Italian nationals from the pro
scribed coastal strip.
Today's proclamation was the
most far-reaching step yet taken to
stamp out sources of sabotage, es
pionage and domestic enemy assist
ance to any hostile attack on the
western United States.
GRADUAL EVICTION
The Army declared the western
half of Washington, Oregon, and
California and the southern half of
Arizona a military area from which
Axis aliens and American-born
Japanese will be evicted progres
sively.
The Japanese - American Citizens
League announced it had called
meetings of its chapters in 300 com
munities "to discuss methods by
which they can correlate their ener
gies and co-operate extensively in
the evacuation process."
DeWitt's proclamation was issued
under authority granted by President
Roosevelt. It was a drastic answer to
frequent public demands for eviction
of all Japanese from vital defense
areas.
The order affected approximately
140,000 enemy aliens besides 70,000
American-born Japanese. California
alone has 93,000 Japanese.
DeWitt stressed the proclamation
merely set up prohibited and re
stricted areas on the coast and did
not represent an order for aliens
and Japanese-Americans to move
out. Evacuation will be ordered
later.'
He said immediate compulsory
mass evacuation of all enemy aliens
and American-born Japanese was
not practicable.
Practically every major city of
California, Oregon, and Washington
lies within prohibited zone A-l. In
California, the principal cities ex
cluded from the zone are Sacra
mento, Stockton, Fresno, and Bak
ersfield.

SAN FRANCISCO, March 3 (UP).
—The Army eventually will oust
American-bom Japanese as well as
enemy aliens from a vast military
area on the Pacific Coast established
in an anti-fifth column proclamation
today by Lieut. Gen. John L. De-
Witt, commander of the Fourth
Army.
Future orders will he issued re
quiring the evacuation of an esti
mated 70,000 Japanese of U.S. citi
zenship, 50,000 Japanese aliens and
unnumbered thousands of German
and Italian nationals from the pro
scribed coastal strip.
Today's proclamation was the
most far-reaching step yet taken to
stamp out sources of sabotage, es
pionage and domestic enemy assist
ance to any hostile attack on the
western United States.
GRADUAL EVICTION
The Army declared the western
half of Washington, Oregon, and
California and the southern half of
Arizona a military area from which
Axis aliens and American-born
Japanese will be evicted progres
sively.
The Japanese - American Citizens
League announced it had called
meetings of its chapters in 300 com
munities "to discuss methods by
which they can correlate their ener
gies and co-operate extensively in
the evacuation process."
DeWitt's proclamation was issued
under authority granted by President
Roosevelt. It was a drastic answer to
frequent public demands for eviction
of all Japanese from vital defense
areas.
The order affected approximately
140,000 enemy aliens besides 70,000
American-born Japanese. California
alone has 93,000 Japanese.
DeWitt stressed the proclamation
merely set up prohibited and re
stricted areas on the coast and did
not represent an order for aliens
and Japanese-Americans to move
out. Evacuation will be ordered
later.'
He said immediate compulsory
mass evacuation of all enemy aliens
and American-born Japanese was
not practicable.
