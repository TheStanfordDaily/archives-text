# Luncheon Club To Hear Elliott
## Speaker to Discuss European Students 
### 
Roland Elliott, executive secretary
of the National Student Committee
of the Y.M.C.A., will speak at the
Luncheon Club meeting this noon in
the Nitery. His subject will be
European students â€” what they arc
thinking and doing.
Mr. Elliott arrived Jan. 24 in New
York after a clipper trip from Lisbon
via Africa, South America, and Ber
muda. Having started for Europe on
Nov. 28, he was there when war was
declared. He acted as a personal
observer of student conditions in the
Europe of 1942.
He found a striking unity on two
points among students in all of the
countries: acknowledgement of joint
responsibility for the conditions
leading up to this war, and a deter
mination to be ready to share in
the planning of peace after the war.
"The food shortage," said Mr. El
liott, "is taking a toll in health, and
the effects will be felt by many gen
erations to come." He also told of a
growing lack of confidence in Hitler
in 1942 Germany.
Harold Shafer, editor of The Stan
ford Daily, will be chairman of the
Luncheon Club meeting this noon.
The price of the meal is 30 cents,
and the public is invited. At all the
meetings the meals are served by
the Stanford Mothers.
