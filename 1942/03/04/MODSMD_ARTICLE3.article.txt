# War Activities Chairmen Meet Under Collins
## Students Interested Asked to Sign Today In Nitery for Work 
### 
Under Bob Collins, the newly ap
pointed Stanford War Activities Co
ordinator, the three branches of the
program moved forward rapidly yes
terday. After an informal commit
tee meeting of the various heads of
the divisions—salvage, defense bonds
and stamps, and U.S.O.—a general
plea was sent out for volunteers to
sign up in any one of the fields.
"We only want volunteers," Col
lins said. "To make the thing a
success, it must be kept free of poli
tics and the feeling that it is an
activity."
"There is plenty of work for ev
eryone," he continued. "But there
will be no gravy train of publicity
attached to it."
The committee decided salvage
work will start immediately under
Pi Thornton, Ed Porter, and Ted
Cole.

"We need everyone's co-operation
in the collection of such items as
razor blades, old toothpaste tubes,
vietrola records, magazines and
newspapers, and even re-collecting
the Dailies," Pi Thornton, co-chair
man of the salvage division, said.
She emphasized the necessity of
immediate action because of the
nearness of the term end.
John McLean, sponsor,
has volunteered to manage the stamp
drive temporarily.
A book is now on the counter of
the Cellar cigar store in which
stamps may be pasted. When this
book is filled it will be donated to
the University.
The U.S.O. work under Virginia
Dean and Ann Bossinger has taken
no definite action, although general
plans have been laid as to how Stan
ford can best help army camps near
here.
Consideration is being given such
ideas as inviting the soldiers to the
Sunday evening movies, the Tues
day Evening Series, and to Sunday
chapel.
Work is also progressing on how
the efforts of the different living
groups to invite the soldiers to din
ner may be best co-ordinated, and
also how the entire Stanford effort
may be co-ordinated with that of
Palo Alto.
