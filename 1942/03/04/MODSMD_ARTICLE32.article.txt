# COMMANDOS RAID NAZI COAST
## 
### 

GERMAN PRISONERS taken during the Fell. 27 blitz raid on a Nazi
radio station near Le Havre, France, get a thorough going over by
British commandos who "brought 'em hack alive," and with plenty of
information. The surprise raid was the first of notable size on the
European continent since Dunkerquc. The commandos were dropped
by parachute on the French coast by British bombers.
