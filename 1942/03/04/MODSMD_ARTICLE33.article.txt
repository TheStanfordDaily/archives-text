# America's Success Challenged By Mumford in Series Talk
## 
### 
"Are we good enough? Or have
we 100 little to give, and will it come
too late?" This is the challenge
hurled by Lewis Mumford in his
Tuesday Series talk on "America
and World Unity."
Mr. Mumford stressed that the
feeling of world insecurity and hope
lessness is a recent one, that even
up until 1914 there was a "world of
hope and security." He emphasized
the freedom from fear and censor
ship, and the liberty to travel any
where in the world, that were taken
for granted until very modern times.
The speaker disposed of last sum
mer's great American controversy
with: "Isolation was a heresy to the
human race. There is only one suc
cessful form of isolationâ€”death."
LOVE PROMISES
Quoting, "America loves prom
ises," Mr. Mumford remarked that
that statement may well become our
epitaph. He then listed the long list
of impossible promises given and
received by this nation.
He emphasized that the old system
was going out, and that a new sys
tem of worldwide co-operation must .
take its place.
Stating that there must be a I
common language, a common re- i
ligion, a common form of justice, I
and, especially, universal moral and j
political forms, the noted sociologist j
startled his audience with the dec- '
laration that "Chinese first," and |
"Polynesians first" must be placed j
on an equal basis with "America !
first."
NOT SAVING VVOKLI)
It is not we who are saving the I
world and guaranteeing the liberty j
of the Russians and Chinese, it is
I he Russians and Chinese who are
guaranteeing our liberty!"
"Worldwide co-operation is not
just some ideal for a future peace, j
it is an immediate military neces- j
sity," stated the lecturer, exclaim
ing, "We can only expect to be slaves j
if the Nazis win."
"Our duty as of this moment," he I
stressed, "is to establish world unity j
a unity of all nations opposed to
the Nazis and a unity which will
have a common justice for all, in
cluding the Axis powers. And it is
only by making the "degenerate na- |
tions" feel the disaster of over- !

whelming defeat that they can ever
be brought to understand the ne
cessity for world unity.
In Mi'. Mumford's opinion, "We
can create a world in which fear
will not predominate and barbarism
will not threaten."
According to the lecturer, we have
much to learn from the other nations
of the world. His idea was that there
is something important in every in
stitution' that our religion is not the
only religion, that our economy is
not the only economy.
