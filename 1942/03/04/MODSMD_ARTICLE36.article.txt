# Varsity Nine Loses First League Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford unsuccessfully launched
i(s I!M2 varsity baseball conference
season with a 1 li-to-3 defeat from St.
Mary's yesterday at Moraga.
Phoenix coach Earl Sheeley start
ed his tall 6-foot-3 pitcher. Fitzger
ald, who was effective for the first
seven innings before the Indian hit
lers figured out his blistering fast
ball. He held Stanford to G hits,
while St. Mary's got 11. His pitches
were the fastest the team has faced
yet this year.
Stanford's* first run came in the
eighth inning after the St. Mary's
catcher, Everett Joseph, had a pass
ball. The other runs came in on a
hit and an error.
DETRIMENT
The playing infield was a decided
detriment to the Stanford infield
ers, who are used to the fine play
ing conditions of the Sunken Dia
mond. Many times throughout the
game easy grounders would take a
bad hop due to the unevenness of
the infield.
Harry Parsons was the leading hit
ter, getting two singles. Leland
Scott, Carl Kellenberger, Ward
Walkup, and John Brooke got a
single apiece.
Harry Dyck started the game, be
ing relieved by Bill Harms. Dyck
was accredited for the loss.
UMPIRE TROUBLE
The umpire caused great conster
nation to the infield when he stood
in the "hole" between second and
third when runners were on first
and third, making it almost impos
sible for the third baseman, Ted
Nell, to see first on an attempted
throw.
"Our boys were definitely off,
although they continued to hustle
throughout the game. I think that
they'll come back and win some
games very soon," said Coach Harry
Wolter.
This was the last scheduled game
of the quarter. During the spring
recess the varsity continues its
league campaign in the south against
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.

eighth inning after the St. Mary's
catcher, Everett Joseph, had a pass
ball. The other runs came in on a
hit and an error.
DETRIMENT
The playing infield was a decided
detriment to the Stanford infield
ers, who are used to the fine play
ing conditions of the Sunken Dia
mond. Many times throughout the
game easy grounders would take a
bad hop due to the unevenness of
the infield.
Harry Parsons was the leading hit
ter, getting two singles. Leland
Scott, Carl Kellenberger, Ward
Walkup, and John Brooke got a
single apiece.
Harry Dyck started the game, be
ing relieved by Bill Harms. Dyck
was accredited for the loss.
UMPIRE TROUBLE
The umpire caused great conster
nation to the infield when he stood
in the "hole" between second and
third when runners were on first
and third, making it almost impos
sible for the third baseman, Ted
Nell, to see first on an attempted
throw.
"Our boys were definitely off,
although they continued to hustle
throughout the game. I think that
they'll come back and win some
games very soon," said Coach Harry
Wolter.
This was the last scheduled game
of the quarter. During the spring
recess the varsity continues its
league campaign in the south against
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
