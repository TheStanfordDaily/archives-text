# Ed Voss High Enough; Halbert Overdoes It
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
Ed Voss is a big man. You might
almost say he is huge.
But at least Ed still maintains
contact with his fellowmen which
can hardly be said for Chuck Hal
bert of West Texas State, who must
at times feel a closer kinship to the
men on Mars.
There is no need in overdoing it.
Being 0 feet, 5V2 inches tall is
enough. Ed can probably control the
ball as thoroughly as Harbert does
and he doesn't have to answer to
charges of "freak."
When you get as tall as some of
these guys you begin to lose favor
with the fans. That big man Dough
erty, 0-10, with Bradley Tech, stood
in front of the basket and batted out
all ihe shots taken by opponents. We
saw him down in San Jose and we
couldn't help getting the feeling that
the Bradley defense was unfair.
DIFFERENT STYLE
Dick Taylor, 0-7, used to be the
only big man on the first string. He
was used at the pivot post but the
main characteristic of the team was
bursting speed, the fast break, and
a darting ball-stealing defense at
which Fordy Anderson was the
master.
The trouble with that team was its
inability to stall effectively. The boys
were so fast and tricky that they
were constantly keyed up and could
n't freeze the ball.
Now this year's outfit controls the
ball easily, driving opponents mad
with an easy stall, and having plenty
left for the Saturday games.
REACHES PEAK
Voss has a peculiar position on the
first string this year. Two of the
boys are veterans about to step out;
two are brilliant newcomers. Ed is
right in the middle of his career and
has been brought to his peak this
season by Everett Dean, who knows
the art of taking a big, gangling
freshman center, awkward in his
first couple of seasons, and turning
him into a smooth pivot man. Per
haps you remember the improve
ment in Dick Taylor.
Well, Voss has developed into one
of the most agile basketball players
on the Stanford squad. He is any
thing but clumsy on those follow

shots, those tip-ins which have put
him right up there in the scoring j
race.
Although he weighs around 210,
Voss has cleared the high jump bar
at 0-2 in intramural competition.
Imagine his poor opponent on a
jump-ball. How can a man expect j
to even come close when Ed is 0-5 j
and can leap 0-2? Maybe Chuck
Halbert has the answer.

master.
The trouble with that team was its
inability to stall effectively. The boys
were so fast and tricky that they
were constantly keyed up and could
n't freeze the ball.
Now this year's outfit controls the
ball easily, driving opponents mad
with an easy stall, and having plenty
left for the Saturday games.
REACHES PEAK
Voss has a peculiar position on the
first string this year. Two of the
boys are veterans about to step out;
two are brilliant newcomers. Ed is
right in the middle of his career and
has been brought to his peak this
season by Everett Dean, who knows
the art of taking a big, gangling
freshman center, awkward in his
first couple of seasons, and turning
him into a smooth pivot man. Per
haps you remember the improve
ment in Dick Taylor.
Well, Voss has developed into one
of the most agile basketball players
on the Stanford squad. He is any
thing but clumsy on those follow

shots, those tip-ins which have put
him right up there in the scoring j
race.
Although he weighs around 210,
Voss has cleared the high jump bar
at 0-2 in intramural competition.
Imagine his poor opponent on a
jump-ball. How can a man expect j
to even come close when Ed is 0-5 j
and can leap 0-2? Maybe Chuck
Halbert has the answer.
Ed Voss is a big man. You might
almost say he is huge.
But at least Ed still maintains
contact with his fellowmen which
can hardly be said for Chuck Hal
bert of West Texas State, who must
at times feel a closer kinship to the
men on Mars.
There is no need in overdoing it.
Being 0 feet, 5V2 inches tall is
enough. Ed can probably control the
ball as thoroughly as Harbert does
and he doesn't have to answer to
charges of "freak."
When you get as tall as some of
these guys you begin to lose favor
with the fans. That big man Dough
erty, 0-10, with Bradley Tech, stood
in front of the basket and batted out
all ihe shots taken by opponents. We
saw him down in San Jose and we
couldn't help getting the feeling that
the Bradley defense was unfair.
DIFFERENT STYLE
Dick Taylor, 0-7, used to be the
only big man on the first string. He
was used at the pivot post but the
main characteristic of the team was
bursting speed, the fast break, and
a darting ball-stealing defense at
which Fordy Anderson was the
master.
