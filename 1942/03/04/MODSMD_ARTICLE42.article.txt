# Pitch Johnson Pleased With Track Showing
## 
### 
Although several potential point- j
winners did not compete, Pitch ;
Johnson believes that the intra- j
squad meet held last Saturday un- -
covered some pleasant surprises for !
Stanford track fans.
Jim Pet tit beat Johnny Silva by a
gnat's eyebrow in the hundred with j
Buck Fawcett not entered in the !
event.
Don Reiss and Ed Hertel ran 14.9
and 24.1 Saturday, which indicates
that these two boys can take care
of the hurdles. Vern Hart will con
centrate on high-jumping this year.
The best runner at Stanford today
is Francis Olson, who ran 1:55 the
other day without having had any
speed work at all this year. He's
capable of 1:52 but the draft board
is looking his way. "Olie" has been
sick for several days and it is doubt
ful if he can get in shape for the
early meets that take place before
his expected draft date.
Neither Bob Compton, who had a
muscle cramp, nor John Mitchell
competed in the distances Saturday.
Bill Spaulding seems to be holding
down the quarter all by himself for
Russ Collier hasn't been turning out.
Dave Bills and Larry Norwood are
ineligible.
Johnson believes Russ Peck and
Ed Tomaso can hit 14 feet this year
in the pole vault, although he was
a little disappointed in their per
formances Saturday. Vic Lindskog's
put of 45 feet was not bad at all for
his first meet, and A1 Pande's 170-
foot javelin toss looked good.
