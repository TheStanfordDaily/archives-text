wrestling with 134 guys'
versions on basketball score
keeping, I finally came up with the
not-so-astounding news that Bob
Mastin, Coach Clark's shiftiest end
last fall, was the intramural hoop
high-scorer with 69 in five games
for an average of almost 14 digits
per contest.
Closely following Bobby are a
pair of Kappa Alphas, Tom LaCoste
and Dick Ray with 06 and 62 points
apiece in, five games. Lou Reese,
who has led the Alpha Delts into
the semi-finals, actually has more
points than any other player, but
his 79 counters were rung up in sev
en games. Phil Moss, Chem Grad
center, has 76 points for seven
games, also.
Other men high up in the season
scoring are Tiff Denton, Chuck
Smith, Bob Morton, Ed Stamm, Bob
Kennedy, Marsh VVeigel, Loren Voth,
Don Reed, and Bob Boorman.

| AST week-end Dean Cromwell,
J miracle-man of the track world
and S.C. coach, aired his '42 team
in a practice meet with Occidental
down South. Even Coach Cromwell
who is an inveterate pessimist, ad
mitted that this team should be im
proved over last year's squad, which
swept everything before it.
But even with this best-of-all
time team and with the excellent
weather they have been having in
the South, the Trojans' marks were
not too far superior to those made by
! the Indians Saturday and we admil
I that this is the Farm's low year ir
' track.
We only surpassed the Southeri
j Californians in one event out ol
| fourteen, but most of the times ant
distances were close, and, after all
we can't expect to be better than tht
best, can we, or can we? No.
Of all the ugly rumors drifting
around the track team, the ugliest i:
that Francis Olson will be drafted ii

| a very short time. With Ole out the
varsity will have a big gap to fill
from the 440 to the 2-mile.

on Page Mill Road there is
many a soldier wearing the
same kind of a suit. It's a single
breasted. olive-colored outfit with
not much drape. Spring is coming
and these transplanted youth in the
monotonous dress are badly in need
of a little recreation aside from the
usual poker playing, etc.
This year at Stanford intramural
athletics are going better than ever
before, which is due in no small part
j to the work of "Red" Holman. Al-
I most 500 men have played in the
l current basketball leagues. Next
j spring these 500 plus other Farm
I men will be wanting some means of
j exercise other than in intercollegiate
j athletics.
Add the first paragraph to the sec
| ond paragraph and you get the third,
which is, "Why don't we at Stanford
1 engage the neighboring soldier boys
!in a few athletic contests, come
j spring quarter?"
