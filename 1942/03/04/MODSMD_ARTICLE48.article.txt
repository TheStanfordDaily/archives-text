# A 						Big Undertaking
## 
### 
A BIG job of organization and co-ordination
is being undertaken starting this week.
The Stanford Wartime Activities Co-ordinator
has been set up at the head of all the Farm's
activity. Although the organization will not get
rolling until next guarter, the ground work is
now being laid and Bob Collins' plans are pil
ing up.
The first thing is to co-ordinate existing agen
cies; the next thing needed is a group of work
ers who will work for the sake of working.
Collins' helpers aren't going to get any glory,
there is no political gravy involved, and the
work is not a matter of card-file big shots.
There certainly is an abundance of poten
tial workers among those who now do nothing
outside their academic work. From this source
should come a bunch of competent leaders and
assistants who will make this movement really
roll.
What might be called a "good-neighbor pol
icy" is being worked up to enable Stanford to
do something for the local service men.
Stanford women have done their part with
informal dances for men in the armed forces;
why don't fraternities and hall clubs invite some
of the boys over for a bull session or cards?
How about some intramural basketball games
and track meets with the boys out on Page Mill
Road? There are endless posibilities in this
respect.
The new co-ordination committee is regard
ing the 10-cent defense stamp as the best me
dium for Stafford's co-operation in the war ef
fort. This little stamp could be the admission
charge to games between Stanford intramural
teams and service teams.
The dream of the committee has you getting
a stamp as change when you throw down a
guarter for a pack of cigarettes.
It seems this new organization is tackling a
big job—one which needs hard workers.—Hap
Everett
The' fullest extent to which two fraternity
houses were willing to go Monday night in
co-operating with the defense bond drive was
to vote to levy all future fines in defense
stamps. By the admission of a member of
once of these houses, such fines are "very in
freguent," and the maximum fine ever levied
in his experience amounted to five dollars.
That's the way to win a war!

It seems this new organization is tackling a
big job—one which needs hard workers.—Hap
Everett
The' fullest extent to which two fraternity
houses were willing to go Monday night in
co-operating with the defense bond drive was
to vote to levy all future fines in defense
stamps. By the admission of a member of
once of these houses, such fines are "very in
freguent," and the maximum fine ever levied
in his experience amounted to five dollars.
That's the way to win a war!
A BIG job of organization and co-ordination
is being undertaken starting this week.
The Stanford Wartime Activities Co-ordinator
has been set up at the head of all the Farm's
activity. Although the organization will not get
rolling until next guarter, the ground work is
now being laid and Bob Collins' plans are pil
ing up.
The first thing is to co-ordinate existing agen
cies; the next thing needed is a group of work
ers who will work for the sake of working.
Collins' helpers aren't going to get any glory,
there is no political gravy involved, and the
work is not a matter of card-file big shots.
There certainly is an abundance of poten
tial workers among those who now do nothing
outside their academic work. From this source
should come a bunch of competent leaders and
assistants who will make this movement really
roll.
What might be called a "good-neighbor pol
icy" is being worked up to enable Stanford to
do something for the local service men.
Stanford women have done their part with
informal dances for men in the armed forces;
why don't fraternities and hall clubs invite some
of the boys over for a bull session or cards?
How about some intramural basketball games
and track meets with the boys out on Page Mill
Road? There are endless posibilities in this
respect.
The new co-ordination committee is regard
ing the 10-cent defense stamp as the best me
dium for Stafford's co-operation in the war ef
fort. This little stamp could be the admission
charge to games between Stanford intramural
teams and service teams.
The dream of the committee has you getting
a stamp as change when you throw down a
guarter for a pack of cigarettes.
