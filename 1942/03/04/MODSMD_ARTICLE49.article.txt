# Come Join the Band, Again!
## 
### 
YOU members of the Stanford Band and you
musicians who used to belong to the band
last fall during football season . . . you're under
military orders, you're in the Army now!
Saturday you'll play for the R.O.T.C. review
in honor of Colonel Harry B. Allen, and for this
event you'll rehearse tomorrow afternoon. Mon
day you perform especially for Stanford; you're
going to play with the choir and the organ in
Memorial Church during the Founders' Day
service.
Because of the services which the Stanford
Band can render during wartime, as pointed out
in today's Campus Opinion, you men who are
not in the band this quarter are urged particu
larly to do your part in building morale, serving
your country and your University, by joining
the band again.
And while we're on the subject, wouldn't it
be possble for the B.A.C. to arrange seats "on
the 50-yard line" for the home basketball game
with Cal Friday night, and for the coming Ore
gon play-offs for the Coast championship? All
this, of course, providing the band will play.
One objection bandmen have had to playing
at basketball games is that they have been
shoved down in the "end zone."
