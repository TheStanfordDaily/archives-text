TO determine whether to spend the customary
$150 for annual sports awards or to contribute
the money to the war effort, Women's Athletic
Association polled the freshmen .women at
Roble corridor meetings Monday night.
Less than twenty frosh women wanted to re
tain the Stanford blanket awards, while all other
Robleites voted against the customary plan and
seemed highly favorable toward the idea of
using the money to buy defense bonds or for a
similar expenditure.
The sophomore women remain to be polled,
and it is to be hoped their response to the call
for war effort support will be as heartening as
that of the freshmen.
