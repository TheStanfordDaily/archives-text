# History, 1942

### AMIE REICHERT 
WEVERAL years ago when somebody on the inside
revealed the blueprints of the German Geopolitik
Institute for world-wide domination, the story was
run on the inside pages of Sunday papers in order to
fill up space, and the few people who stopped to
read it shrugged their shoulders and laughed it off as
a Hearst journalistic stunt.
Now the story makes the front pages because it is
being acted out in these tense moments of history. It
isn't a dream or a blueprint any more, it's reality, and
you have only to look at a map and then at the head
lines if you don't believe it.
This is the plan: the Germans and the Japanese
are forging a world-encircling pincers which is to grip
the continent of Eurasia, cut off the life lines of the
British, Russian, Chinese, and Dutch, and isolate them
from their American allies.
And this is how it is to be done—at least this is the
way the experts see it, and this is the way it looks
from all indications at the moment:

'JpHE Germans will drive down through the Ukraine
of southern Russia into the Caucasus while the
Japanese navy will achieve supremacy in the Indian
Ocean. This latter move will mean that the Axis can
threaten the coastline of India and neutralize that
country without having to fight the British there; it
will mean that the supply lines to China from Brit
ain and the U.S. will be cut; it will mean that aid to
Russia via the southern route will cease; it will mean
that the U.S. arterial to the Middle East via the Per
sian Gulf will be cut; it will mean Japanese occupa
tion of Ceylon and probably Madagascar, and then
thrusts through the Persian Gulf at Iran and Suez.
Meanwhile German U-boats in the Atlantic will
continue to harrass the supply lines between the U.S.
and Britain. And in the Middle East, Rommel will
sweep across northern Africa for an attack on Iraq
which would Hank the German offensive in Russia.
The German air force will be in control of the Medi
terranean.
Ultimately the plan is for the Germans and their
yellow Aryan brothers to clasp hands in Iran.
All this does not sound as amazing and impossible
as it did a year—even a month ago. In fact, it sounds
quite possible, not very amazing, only terrifying. For
it would mean the end of the war.
It would mean a completely knocked-out British
Empire and a United States rendered utterly impo
tent, a continent isolated from its allies, with all its
supply lines saddled by the Axis, flanked by a German
dominated ocean on the east, a Japanese dominated
ocean on the west, menaced by a fifth-column-ridden
South America lying in the shadow of Germany's
African coastline.
This is the Axis plan. What I want to know now is,
have we got a plan?
