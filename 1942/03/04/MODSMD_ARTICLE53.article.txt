EDITOR, SIR:
Instead of the slogan, "Let's pan the band," I sug
gest we return to the good old slogan, "Come join the
band. The following is a letter I have just received
from Colonel Allen:
"In the midst of the greatest war of all time it
occurs to me that the Stanford Band has a golden op
portunity to increase morale in the student body at
Stanford University.
"As Doctor Wilbur so aptly states, we are trying
here to get that balance between study, physical ex
ercise and recreation that makes for sound minds in
healthy bodies.
"Members of the band belonging to the R.O.T.C.
could do a great service to all concerned by playing
in the band during any ipilitary ceremony. They would
Ret their military training at other times, and could
feci that they are performing a double service to the
University and to the Military Unit.
"Since the close of the football season, I have no
ticed a decided decrease in the Band membership;
and am writing you with the hope that the students
might get behind a movement to bring the band en
rollment to such strength that we can once again hear
the strains of "Come Join the Band."
He supports my belief that we need band music in
wartime more than ever. I would like to testify that
the officers of the Band and the new director have
done their utmost to keep up the membership this
quarter, but their efforts are in vain unless they can
have the active support of the men in particular who
have dropped out and the encouragement of the stu
dent body in general. The Band will play at the re
view Saturday morning.
