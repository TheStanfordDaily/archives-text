wartime measures, civil and criminal
codes, and taxes, yearbooks, propa
ganda pamphlets, newspapers, and
scientific journals.
Commercial aviation was sacri
ficed for the military program as
early as 1934, the Japan Yearbook
for that year reveals.
'"Aircraft manufacturing in Japan
consists chiefly in making of military
and naval planes," the Yearbook
declares. "Original patents were
brought from abroad and machines
built according to these patents, but
the art of manufacture has now
greatly advanced, and recently both
airplanes and engines of Japanese
design are being built."
BEFORE PEARL HARBOR
Written ten months before Pearl
Harbor, the following statement ap
pears in "Wartime Legislation of
Japan, 1941":
"Propaganda and subversive plots
are conducted to demoralize the
people of a hostile power . . . Japan,
under present international circum
stances, must be safeguarded from
the danger of such activities of other
nations as a preliminary step in
strengthening the wartime struc
ture."
Since lit!!!) Japan lias limited the distribution of tires to military and
government use, to the imperial household, and to foreign embassies, and
has prohibited the use of rubber in shoes, garden hoses, toys, rubber bands,
and other similar commercial articles.
This is revealed in a book, "Wartime Legislation of Japan, 1939," which

is one item of a shipment of Japa
nese material, probably the last to
leave Japan, just acquired by the
Hoover Library on War, Revolution,
and Peace at Stanford.
The new acquisition, consisting of
more than 350 items, is valued high
ly by the Hoover Library because
much of the material was published
during the past two or three years
and indicates the trends of govern
ment, economics, and industry of
present-day Japan.
WARTIME PAMPHLETS
