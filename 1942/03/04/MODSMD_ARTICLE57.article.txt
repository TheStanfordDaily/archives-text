# New 3121 Lines Ready Friday
## 
### 
Installation of a new switchboard
in Toyon Hall with the same capac
ity as the present one was complet
ed yesterday by the telephone com
pany in an attempt to relieve the
congestion that has clogged the pres
ent 3121 service. The new two-man
board will serve Union Residence,
Encina, Toyon, and Branner Halls.
Dr. Stanley Sharp, in charge of
men's halls, said that the board may
be in operation by tomorrow night
and by Friday at the latest. The
board has dual controls so that one
man can operate both boards during
slack periods. Rush periods which
will require the services of two op
erators are between 5 and 6 p.m. and
between 10 and 11 p.m.
The addition was first announced a
month ago by E. E. Erwin, assistant
business manager, who estimated
that operating costs will be increased
roughly $100 a month. The enlarge
ment of the telephone necessitated
the removal of the Toyon office to a
new room in the north wing of the
building.
Dr. Sharp said that the Adminis
tration is also considering installing
a few new local phones in Encina.
