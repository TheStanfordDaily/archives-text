# Blatt Set to Enter National Ski Meet
## 
### 
The national downhill, slalom and
combined chiimpiom%iips will be
held at Badger Pass on March 13
and 14. Because the meet is sched
uled so close to finals, Bobby Blatt
will probably be the only skier to
represent Stanford. Blatt took first
in the slalom and fourth in the
downhill in the Pacific Coast inter
collegiate championships at Yo
semite last week-end.
Skiers planning to take advan
tage of the all-expense ski rates at
Yosemite should pay their $5 deposit
to Bill Lane or Betty Boardman as
soon as possible.
