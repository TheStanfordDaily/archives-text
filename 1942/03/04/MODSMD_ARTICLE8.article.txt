# Guerard Claims World State Exists and Can Be Maintained

(Editor's Note: This is the second in a series of interviews which
discuss the problems of the peace following the war.)

The World State—discussed by most theoreticians in terms of the fu
ture—is already in existence, and will remain so unless we "tear it down
with our own hands," according to Dr. Albert Guerard, professor of
literature.
I)r. Guerard, who, born and brought up in Paris, first came to Stan-

ford in 1!)0(>, has been one of
the most outstanding proponents of
a post-war organization in which
the entire world will be brought to
some extent under one central au- j
thority. • !
The Allies have through necessity
built up a war organization which j
already transcends national bounda- !
ries to such an extent that the
groundwork for the future World
State is already laid upon a sound j
basis, according to Dr. Guerard.
"Not only is the World State in
existence, but it is now facing its j
most severe test. If it can stand this, '
it can stand anything," he said.
WRITTEN OPINION
Dr. Guerard has outdistanced
most scholars on this all-important
subject in that he has in his lectures
and writings actually set down how,
in his opinion, the post-war world
should be organized.
"I want to make it clear that I
do not advocate a unitary world
government—one in which the en
tire globe would be governed from
one place with no local sub-govern
ments," he said.
"The world state must be federal,
not unitary. This is necessary since
there are wide divergencies in the
standards of living of certain areas."
As an example, he pointed out the
difference between North America '
and India.
UNITING PROBLEM
"It wouldn't be fair to ask Ameri
cans to live under the same absolute
government as Indians, with the
same economic laws, social agen
cies, and so on."
The problem of uniting hatred
ridden Europe under one govern
ment is of especial concern to Dr.
Guerard. In spite of the lingual,
cultural, racial, and psychological
differences prevalent on that conti
nent, it will be very possible to gov
ern it as a unit, he declared, pro
viding certain limitations are re
spected by the government.
"First of all, the government of i
Europe must confine itself to neces
sary functions of government; it |
must stay away from ideological j
controversies.
DIFFERENCE IN IDEALS
"After all, the differences among !
European peoples which historians j
arc so fond of dwelling upon are
only a matter of sentiment and j
ideals. A successful European con- <
tincntal government must be a j
purely practical one of material j
things.
"Let the national units of the
world have their ideologies. As long
as we keep those ideologies com
pletely separate from government,
they will not be dangerous, for they !
will not be armed."
(A speech of Dr. Guerard's, en- '
titled, "No Peace Treaty, But a i
World State," will be published in
The Daily at the beginning of
spring quarter.)
