# Council Hits Increased Honor Code Violations
## New Students Are Main Offenders 
### 
More Honor Code violations this
quarter and less than during any
previous quarter brought a promise
of "stilT penalties" for all future in
fractions from Bob Morton, chair
man of Men's Council, yesterday.
Morton reported there have been
"seven or eight violations already
this quarter," and that there were
"five ut the end of last quarter."
INVOLVES NEW STUDENTS
"Almost every case except one
has involved a Lower Division or
transfer student, and almost all
cases have to do with finals," he
said. Morton added the recent wave
of infractions comes in contrast to a
maximum of two or three a quar
ter, a year or so ago.
' In addition," he said, "men have
told me there has been a lot more
cheating this quarter, and these are
cases where no specific proof is
available and we cannot act upon
them."
ONLY HEARS OF FEW
He pointed out Men's Council only
hears of a small percentage of cases
and that most of them are handled
directly by professors.
"We would like to talk to a fac
ulty comrryttee and arrange it so we
handle all cases and can impose stiff
penalties. I'm inclined to think the
faculty is sometimes a little lenient."
WILBUR'S STATEMENT
Morton called particular atten
tion to Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
bur's statement of Tuesday night in
which he said he would not sign a
"dirty diploma," and that he would
not recommend any student for a
commission in the service who had
been convicted of an Honor Code
violation.
"Maybe students themselves will
hand in reports of infractions if they
realize the Honor Code is going to go
to pot if something isn't done by
them," he continued.
LARGE CLASSES
The main violations occur in the
large political science and econom
ics classes, and in language classes,
he stated.
"When we get a case the man
breaks down completely and it's
hard to see. This makes it a tough
job, but we've got to do it," he con
cluded.

violation.
"Maybe students themselves will
hand in reports of infractions if they
realize the Honor Code is going to go
to pot if something isn't done by
them," he continued.
LARGE CLASSES
The main violations occur in the
large political science and econom
ics classes, and in language classes,
he stated.
"When we get a case the man
breaks down completely and it's
hard to see. This makes it a tough
job, but we've got to do it," he con
cluded.
More Honor Code violations this
quarter and less than during any
previous quarter brought a promise
of "stilT penalties" for all future in
fractions from Bob Morton, chair
man of Men's Council, yesterday.
Morton reported there have been
"seven or eight violations already
this quarter," and that there were
"five ut the end of last quarter."
INVOLVES NEW STUDENTS
"Almost every case except one
has involved a Lower Division or
transfer student, and almost all
cases have to do with finals," he
said. Morton added the recent wave
of infractions comes in contrast to a
maximum of two or three a quar
ter, a year or so ago.
' In addition," he said, "men have
told me there has been a lot more
cheating this quarter, and these are
cases where no specific proof is
available and we cannot act upon
them."
ONLY HEARS OF FEW
He pointed out Men's Council only
hears of a small percentage of cases
and that most of them are handled
directly by professors.
"We would like to talk to a fac
ulty comrryttee and arrange it so we
handle all cases and can impose stiff
penalties. I'm inclined to think the
faculty is sometimes a little lenient."
WILBUR'S STATEMENT
Morton called particular atten
tion to Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
bur's statement of Tuesday night in
which he said he would not sign a
"dirty diploma," and that he would
not recommend any student for a
commission in the service who had
been convicted of an Honor Code
violation.
"Maybe students themselves will
hand in reports of infractions if they
realize the Honor Code is going to go
to pot if something isn't done by
them," he continued.
