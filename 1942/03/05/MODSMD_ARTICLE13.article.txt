The Army statement late today
j said that the three craters were
; found northeast of Roosevelt High
i School which lies on the edge of a
: residential section at the foot of
Mount Aintulus and also near the
famed "Punch Bowl" volcanic cra
ter.
The statement said there still was
no positive indication as to the cause
of the "asserted bomb craters."
If enemy planes did attempt to
strike again at Honolulu—for the
i first time since Dec. 7 when the dis
i astrous Japanese raids touched off
the Pacific war — they would have
come from an aircraft carrier or
would have been long-range craft
from some mid-Pacific Japanese
base.
The Army's first announcement,
explaining the sounding of the siren,
said:
"Inadvertent sounding of the siren
followed by three detonations caused
the belief that an air-raid alarm had
been sounded," the Army announced.
"No air raid alarm was sounded,
however. The cause of the detona
! lions is now being investigated."
