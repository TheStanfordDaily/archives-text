# Roble Organizes For War Effort
## 
### 
Acting on plans made in the Roblc
Senate last week, the Roble women
enthusiastically pledged all-out con
tribution toward war effort. Otic
hundred defense stamp booklets
were handed out and more are
needed. Stamps will be sold every
night in the Roblc Hole from 10 to
10:30.
Besides the drive for defense
stamps, Roblc has organized to save
tinfoil, and nylon and silk hose for
use as stretcher pads. Also in co
operation with Red Cross work,
Robleites experienced in knitting
and sewing will do their part. The
freshman women also expressed a
desire to enter Red Cross courses
and other courses which the Univer
sity might offer in the line of de
fense preparation.
And locally, the freshmen plan to
help by saving old magazines for the
men in the army posts located
near here.
