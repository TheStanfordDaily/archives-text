Australian and British defenders still
were moving up for fierce counter
attacks.

gained part of the 7'/2-mile sector
which the Allied forces cleared yes
terday.
The only major battle reported

ish artillery units were reported
scoring successes in one sector.

tain stronghold to which the gov
ernment has moved from Batavia.
