## Five Nipponese Ships Sunk in Daring Raid On Subic Bay Region 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 4 (UP).-
Gtn. Douglas Mar Arthur's tiny, but
hard hitting air fleet was revealed
tonight to have dealt a heavy blow
to the Japanese invaders of the Phil
ippines, sinking five ships and in
flicting extensive shore destruction
in ij daring raid on Subic Bay.
The victory—one of the most not
able in the Philippines campaign —
was announced by the War Depart
ment, which said more than 30,000
tons of enemy shipping was wiped
out.
Li 1 :t< d, as sunk were one 12,000-
ton ship, one 10,000-tomier, one
fs.OOO-tonner, and two 100-ton motor
launches. Many smaller craft were
d imaged and, on the docks of
Olongapo and Grande Island, the
Americans set large fires which were
followed by "many heavy explosions
among enemy stores."
The audacious blow apparently
was aimed at one of the enemy's
main supply bases in the Rataan
;.rea. It marked the second time
wiihin a week that Mac Arthur had
directed surprise thrusts at the
enemy.
The blow all (he more daring in
that the Japs are supposed to have
command of the air over the Philip
pines—was calculated to disrupt fur
ther the enemy timetable for an all
out, offense.
