# Frosh Prove Validity of 'Dutch Dale as Robleites Lose Debate
## 
### ED CONN 
Proving by an intricate cycle that
if the present dating system is con
tinued, the tuition rates at Stanford
would rise, the Encina debaters, Bill
Spragins and Bill Eberle, defeated
Robleites Aurelia Lopez and Joanne
Benedict last night in the Roble
lobby. The subject was "Resolved:
That for the duration of the war
Stamford women should pay half
of all date expenses."
"Due lo war conditions, higher
taxes, and less security, boys today
are reluctant to go out on dates,"
extolled second speaker Eberle. "If
the present trend of less dates con
tinues, there will consequently be
less wooing, consequently less mar
riages, consequently less children,
consequently less students going to
Stanford. Therefore tuition rates
would go up!"
The victorious male sex also
claimed that the trend today is to
ward equality between men and
women. Throughout the recent years
women have been granted the right
to vote, they now can appear in bars
and at boxing matches, and they are
now even allowed to take man-size
jobs such as welders, carpenters,
and shipfitters. "So why not keep
up the trend socially?" claimed the
affirmative. "We're doing it politi
cally and economically anyway."
Robleites furiously defended wom
en's rights by pointing out that girls
today, what with the expense of
clothes, greater living expenses, the
cost of necessities such as cosmetics,
can't possibly afford the risk of
"dutch dates" continuously. "Why
the cost of evening dresses alone,
in allowing a girl three a year,
mounts to seventy-five dollars," ex
claimed Joanne Benedict.

Judges for Ihe debate were Miss
Rosemonde Clark, social chairman of
Roble; Dr. Stanley Sharp, assistant
dean of men, and Dr. Rixford Sny
der, history professor.
In commenting upon the debate,
Dr. Sharp bemoaned, "Seventy-five
dollars a year for evening gowns
alone. And me with a daughter
coming here in two years. Yee
gawds!"
Dr. Snyder appreciated (he ref
erence the debaters made to "West
ern Civ," and he discussed —well, not
in detail—the "dutch date" Caesar
had with Cleopatra.

less wooing, consequently less mar
riages, consequently less children,
consequently less students going to
Stanford. Therefore tuition rates
would go up!"
The victorious male sex also
claimed that the trend today is to
ward equality between men and
women. Throughout the recent years
women have been granted the right
to vote, they now can appear in bars
and at boxing matches, and they are
now even allowed to take man-size
jobs such as welders, carpenters,
and shipfitters. "So why not keep
up the trend socially?" claimed the
affirmative. "We're doing it politi
cally and economically anyway."
Robleites furiously defended wom
en's rights by pointing out that girls
today, what with the expense of
clothes, greater living expenses, the
cost of necessities such as cosmetics,
can't possibly afford the risk of
"dutch dates" continuously. "Why
the cost of evening dresses alone,
in allowing a girl three a year,
mounts to seventy-five dollars," ex
claimed Joanne Benedict.

Judges for Ihe debate were Miss
Rosemonde Clark, social chairman of
Roble; Dr. Stanley Sharp, assistant
dean of men, and Dr. Rixford Sny
der, history professor.
In commenting upon the debate,
Dr. Sharp bemoaned, "Seventy-five
dollars a year for evening gowns
alone. And me with a daughter
coming here in two years. Yee
gawds!"
Dr. Snyder appreciated (he ref
erence the debaters made to "West
ern Civ," and he discussed —well, not
in detail—the "dutch date" Caesar
had with Cleopatra.
Proving by an intricate cycle that
if the present dating system is con
tinued, the tuition rates at Stanford
would rise, the Encina debaters, Bill
Spragins and Bill Eberle, defeated
Robleites Aurelia Lopez and Joanne
Benedict last night in the Roble
lobby. The subject was "Resolved:
That for the duration of the war
Stamford women should pay half
of all date expenses."
"Due lo war conditions, higher
taxes, and less security, boys today
are reluctant to go out on dates,"
extolled second speaker Eberle. "If
the present trend of less dates con
tinues, there will consequently be
less wooing, consequently less mar
riages, consequently less children,
consequently less students going to
Stanford. Therefore tuition rates
would go up!"
