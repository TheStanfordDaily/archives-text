# Is the Honor Code Working?
## 
### 
STANFORD'S recent minor "crime wave" in the form of un
precedented Honor Code violations is brought to the student
body's attention this morning by the chairman of Men's Council
in the hope of eliminating through the medium, of publicity the
unfortunate black mark on the University's record.
Dishonest students, and fortunately they are few, must realize
University officials will not sign a "dirty diploma," because Stan
ford maintains a clean record and is proud of it.
They must also realize a student convicted of an Honor Code
violation will not be given a recommendation for a commission
in the services, and most college men hope to obtain commis
sions. It is a guestion of receiving a commission or peeling
potatoes, in the words of Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur.
The reason for increased infractions seems to be that some
students, who desire to get grades good enough to earn com
missions, are proceeding upon the dangerous philosophy that
the end justifies the means. It might be asked why it is felt at
this time that the Honor Code is not working, when more viola
tions are reported. The fact remains that almost all the cases are
turned in by professors and not by students, who are expected
to co-operate, and that there are many cases which are never
turned in at all.
Who are the violators? The majority are Lower Division and
transfer students. This indicates the orientation program should
stress more heavily Honor Code education. This should be done
at the start of each guarter, keeping in mind the new four-guarter
University basis.
Where do the violations occur? Mostly in large classes, such
as political science, economics, and language groups. Where
there are too many students to take alternate seats in a classroom,
they should be allowed to overflow to other rooms, where this is
possible. But it is really an issue of individual voluntary co-oper
ation . . . the alternative is a proctor system and the downfall
of the Code.
Further, faculty members should not handle the cases them
selves. It is the students' responsibility, and the faculty should
turn over all violations to the Men's and Women's Councils, who
claim faculty penalties are too lenient.
Sentencing of work hours for violators is not the answer.
The answer is expulsion from school. Stanford men and
women have a clean record and there is no place here for un
desirable associates who won't keep it that way.
