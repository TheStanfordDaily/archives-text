# Europe Faces Anarchy, Says Roland Elliott
## 
### BOB POTTER 
When the German military con
trols of Europe slip an explosion of
anarchy will sweep over the Con
tinent. declared Roland Elliott, be
fore the Luncheon Club yesterday.
"The peoples of France and Hol-
I land will overthrow their Nazi pup
pet leaders, Mr. Elliott, executive
i secretary of the Y.M.C.A. National
Student Committee, said. He has re
| cently returned from an extensive
I tour of Europe.
THREE PROBLEMS
The three main considerations of
! European students arid political and
â–  religious leaders are food, resistance,
| and reconstruction, he added.
Mr. Elliott told of the prevalence
i of disease in France and of the gen
eral poor health of the conquered
| peoples. Working mostly with stu
dents, he found many who could not
focus their eyes for a very long
time because of vitamin deficiencies
in the diet.
RESISTANCE PREVALENT
"Resistance is an essential factor
j of any program of reconstruction,"
said Me. Elliott. "There is resist
ance under thp surface and upon the
j surface not only in the occupied
countries, but also in Germany it
self. All religious and political
leaders say that the true spiritual
: values are basic in the programs of
j reconstruction."
Mr. Elliott continued that the stu
dent relief agencies have established
j "Universities in Internment" in the
German and Swiss internment camps.
They are trying to give prisoners
| something to do with their leisure
time to counteract the scourge of
J the prison camps, the so-called
j "barbed wire fever."
