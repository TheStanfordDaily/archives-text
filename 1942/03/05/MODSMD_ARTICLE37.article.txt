# Mural Track To Be Run Wednesday
## 
### 
Campus organization teams will
wind up winter quarter mural activ
ities next Wednesday when the an
nual mural track meet will be run
off, it was announced last night by
Red Holman, intramural manager.
Team managers are urged to
whip their teams into shape in
preparation for the meet which will
be run in one day. The events will
be announced tomorrow, and meet
point ratings will count heavily
toward the all-University intra
mural championship.
The Phi Psis will clash with the
Alpha Dolts at 8 o'clock tonight in
the Pavilion in the first game of the
quarter-finals. The Zete-Kappa Sig
game will follow at 9 o'clock. The
two games will undoubtedly be
among the top tilts of the season.
The Phi Psis have battled through
a tough season using the same team
that carried them to the top last
year, and the Alpha Delts, to date,
look just about as good, having de
feated the Delts, last year's runners
up. The Zetes and Kappa Sigs have
both won in tough leagues, and the
Zetes moved into the semi-finals by
downing a speedy Sigma Chi team,
and the Kappa Sigs stepped into
the semis by defeating the Delta
Chis.

The winners of tonight's games
will meet Monday night in the Pa
vilion to decide the mural hoop
championship. This will complete 8
weeks of hoop competition among
53 campus teams, the greatest amount
to ever clash in a campus mural
sport"
