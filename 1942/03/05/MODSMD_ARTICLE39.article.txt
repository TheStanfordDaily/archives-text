# Cal Hoop Tilt To Test Cards
## 
### 
The last time Stanford and Cali
fornia met on the hardwood the
Bears "slow broke" the Indians into
two overtime periods and barely
dropped a close decision. Since that
time the Cards have mastered the
"ball control" game.
Stanford was "ball controlled" to
death by both U.C.L.A and U.S.C.,
yet managed to lick both southern
teams twice in a row.
Perhaps Cal will once again come
out with a slow breaking offense,
tactics which would presumably give
the Redskins less shots at the bas
kets and would keep the score down.
Should Cal jump to a fast break
Stanford would get more shots at
the basket and have a chance to run
up the score with its great back
board control.
Since the first Card-Trojan series
when S. C. dumped Stanford once,
27-23, other teams have tried to with
out success to slow up the skyscrap
ing Indians.
Last week in Los Angeles South
ern California tried a slow break for
the first half, found the going bad,
and resorted to its old style game,
using all speed available.
Despite the fact that it has sewed
up the southern division crown,
Stanford is going out to win tomor
row and Saturday. Since Stanford's
regular five has been forced to do
double duties this year, Coach Ev
erett Dean may get a chance to sub
stitute a little, but not if the Bears
do what they did last time the two
clubs met.
One week from tomorrow Stanford
and Oregon State College will tan
gle in the Pavilion to decide the Pa
cific Coast Conference champion
ship.
