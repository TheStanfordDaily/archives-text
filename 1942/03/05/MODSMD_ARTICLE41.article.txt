# DALLMAR STARS AT GUARD
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
One boy you can't hide your bald
ness from is Ilovvie Dallmar, sopho
more guard from Lowell via Menlo.
> Up there at 6-4 or 6-5, Howie
probably gets a freak perspective of
the world's comings and goings,
something like the guy with the
corner seat in the front row of the
theater. "Dallie" is anything but a
bean pole, however, his 195 pounds
being well distributed tor almost
any sport, â€¢ but basketball in par
ticular.
HERO OF LOWELL
Some years ago at Lowell, Howie
had whole pages of sport sections to
himself. Big. league scouts were
alter him to start a career as a first
baseman. He sneaked out of the
hospital to score the deciding pofnts
in Lowell's crucial game of the bas
ketball season. *
A flock of colleges sought his
services. Howie entered Cal's ex
tension division after graduating
from Lowell, but soon turned up at
Menlo Junior College.
MOVES RIGHT IN
Last year he entered Stanford and
moved right iftto the first string
line-up.
A high scorer for a guard, Howie
has had some sensational nights this
season, tanking 18 points against
U.S.C. Saturday night for one of his
best performances. He uses his
height to fullest advantage because
of his split-second timing on going
up lor the ball, and Howie would
rather thrash it out any time than
settle for a held-ball.
On offense Dallmar has a won
derful flat set-shot, and like the
rest of the Cards he makes a spe
cialty of tip-ins.
Also he makes a good roommate
because we can both comb our hair
in iront of the mirror at the same
time without any arguments.
