# SIDELINE SLANTS

### H. D. THOREAU BILL HORNBY 
(The same thing happened to
Slants today that happened to
Bull Session yesterday, only I've
got a friend who is an artist, not
a cartoonist.)

Phil Bengtson may get his silver
lining after all. Mr. Bengtson in
herited Stanford's 1942 frosh cage
team in November from retiring
Coach Bob Burnett, a gift that lacked
a Pollard, Burness, or Cowden to
mark it as a just-what-I've-always
wanted collection. Termed "just av
erage" the frosh proceeded to justi
fy this handle. At times they looked
passable, and on others — specifically

against Poly, Paly, Santa Clara, and
| Mcnlo—they would have lost to the
Encina janitors. A cloudy outlook
I was enjoyed by all.
j Came the dawn with two games
against San Francisco S.C. and Sa
. linas J.C.—the last tilts played. On
these memorable nights, Messrs.
[ Parsons, Heald, and Brown decided
to jump off the dime simultaneously,
with the happy result that the year
-1 lings potted some 100 plus counters
j in two nights. All of the potential
i scoring power, previously held back
I by an "after-you-Gaston" shooting
. policy in the forward wall, swished
forth. Everybody beamed, including
j Mr. Bengtson.

| / QUESTION—WiII the sun still be
out against the Cal freshmen in
] the final two clashes this week-end?
The answer—Yes! Season records
show that the five first-string play
ers for Stanford have netted 354
points, well over 2/3 of the total
point-harvest of the entire squad.

(Parsons has hit 79 points in 13
games, Barsocchini 47, Heald 77,
Brown 111, and Hall 40.) Not once
has Stanford lost a game when more
than one of this quintet has netted
over ten points. On defense, the
Papeese have been very consistent;
all of their four losses came on an
average four-point margin. Total
ing the entire record, it seems sure
that if two or more of the Stan
fords hit at least ten points in the Cal
game and if the defense remains on
a par, the locals should net between
40-50 points — a margin that will
dump Cal.

QF COURSE, the Cal side isn't
bleak, either. The Cub squad,
paced by 5 feet and 7 inches of one
Bill DePaoli at forward, abetted by
Gordon Cuneo, "Coat" Hanger, Gene
Williams (Los Angeles product), Bob
Arnold, and Hiskey, Stewart, and
Raaka has punctured egos of such
as Poly and Santa Clara—the latter
by G points each. The Cals matched
Stanford with about the same mar
| gin of victory over Piedmont, and
| hit 3 points less than the locals
J against Lowell. In the one previous
Card-Cub game, our "sterling year
lings" lost by 5 points, but the Cubs
seem to have a healthy fear of this
week's tilts. A coy California letter
opines that they haven't the "least
idea" who'll win, and that some of
our boys are "very good"—mention
ing Heald and Brown especially.
It's a cinch that Cal won't be un
der the same size eight-ball as the
locals in the games this week, for. as
far as Stanford is concerned, the out
j come Friday and Saturday means
the difference between a regular
J "season" and an extended winter
"gym class." The former wins Mr.
Bengtson his silver lining; the lat-
I ter a bottle of tarnish remover.
