# Dee Downs Neal; Keeps Second Place
## 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
After dropping the first set and
trailing 0-3 in the second, Co-captain
Larry Dee came back strongly to
stop the challenge of Emery Neale,
4-6, 6-4. 6-3, in a ladder match yes
terday. The victory keeps Dee in the
number two spot when the Indian
netmen tangle with the California
club this Saturday afternoon on the
varsity courts.
The veteran Dee abandoned his
usual slashing game for a steady,
soft pushing one from the baseline.
In the first set, Neale forced him
from corner to corner, came to net
on Dee's short returns and volleyed
them off with deadly accuracy.
The second set found Neale play
ing perfectly, standing on the base
line lashing Dee's soft returns to
the corners. The junior star broke
Dee's service twice, "held his own
and held a commanding lead of 3-0.
Right here, Neale eased up, Dee
came to life, forced instead of
pushed, broke through Neale's serv
ice and went on to win the set 6-4.
LEE BREAKS THROUGH
The last set found both boys stand
ing on the baseline rallying soft and
long. Dee broke Neale's second serv
ice, held his own after four deuce
points, and with this game Dee held
a 4-1 lead and the match was
cinched.
The battle with the Califoi â€¢nia
club this Saturday will be the first
match lor the Cards in their prac
tice season before the regular con
ference matches begin. The Cal
club boasts of a well-rounded team*
and last Saturday they trounced the
University of California netmen 6-3.
Heading the clubbers this year
will be Bill Canning, the former
Bear ace, followed by such men as
Cecil Alloo, Bud Chandler, Herschel
Hyde, Tate Coulthard and Carl
Holmes.
After weeks of ladder matches,
Coach John Lamb has finally picked
his first four singles men. Topping
the Cards will be the fifth ranking
tennis player in the nation, Ted
Shroeder. By virtue of his win yes
terday, Dee will play the number
two spot, followed by Neale, and the
number four position will be taken
by Jimmy Wade.
MATCHES TODAY
The five and six positions are in a
jumble, and will be decided by lad
der matches today. Five men, Tom
Kruger, Ben Olsen, Charles Hutchi
son, Harper Ink and Chuck Hopper,
have been battling each other and
no one of them has come out con
sistently on top. The five men will
take the courts this afternoon and
the two winners will face the Cal
club.
The top doubles spot still goes to
Jimmy W/ide and Larry Dee, who
played that position all last year.
Neale and Roberts will play num
ber two, and Shroeder, with a new
partner Paul Wilson, will round out
the three doubles teams. Wilson, a
transfer from Ventura J.C., is tall,
rangy, has a hard serve and a steady
volleying game, and may prove to
be just the man to fit in with Shroe
der.
The Stanford freshmen, led by
Ted Myers, will meet the Modesto
Junior College Saturday morning
on the varsity courts.
