# Other Uses for Bonds
## 
### 
ONE of the obstacles which living groups
have encountered in doing their part in
the defense bond drive has been the misunder
standing on the part of many people of the
action taken by some groups in donating their
bonds to the University.
It is not at all necessary for all groups to do
this. This was a voluntary act taken by the first
group to buy a bond, but is not necessarily
recommended by student leaders.
If a living group does not feel it can turn over
its bonds to the University, it can nevertheless
do its part for the drive and for the war effort
just as effectively as those who do. For in
stance, the bonds can be put in the house or
club scholarship fund; those groups which have
reserve or building funds can put that money
into bonds; or the group may just hold the bond
itself as equivalent to a collective savings ac
count.
Another idea: what about the little cash boxes
that some fraternities and clubs have on the
dining table, in which cash is put for various
fines levied on members? Why not have those
fines payable only in defense stamps?
Or, if these or other plans for collective action
are not acceptable to a particular group, it
should at least be possible for each group to
see that each of its members buys a certain
minimum of defense stamps for himself.
If any organization thinks of other more prac
tical or unique ways of buying bonds. The Daily
will be glad to give them publicity. Just call

Believe it or not, even with Stanford's
championship Southern Division basketball
team, not once this season have student root
ers' tickets been sold out. Certainly student
interest in the Oregon play-offs here should
see a sell-out today and tomorrow.
