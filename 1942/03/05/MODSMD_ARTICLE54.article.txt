# Alchemy in the Libe

### 
STANFORD students have always wondered
what the Felton Library is and who ever
goes there.
Well, we've got the answer. It's the place
where the University's Brain Trusters retire on
Hallowe'en and April Fool's Eve, cast together
weird chemicals, let forth a croak or two and
come up with the plans for the University's
parking lots.
The latest little potion they have cooked up is
the change in the Library parking lot. For the
last five years the muddy condition of that
place has given cause for at least one biting
Daily editorial every winter quarter, and the
crack about the freshman who fell into one of
the chuckholes and found himself face-to-face
with the Devil became so well known that only
the most unsophisticated would think it funny
any more.
The coming of the Hoover Libe brought about
a New Order, and students looked hopefully to
the day when there would be a nice, graded
gravel parking lot beside the Libe.
Well, that day has come. The gravel lot is
here. There are no bottomless chuckholes.
There is even a fairly large portion of the lot
not marked with "For Faculty Only" signs.
But that is not all. The boys in the Felton Libe
weren't going to let anything as simple as that
get by.
Nope, they were really going to change things
around. And so the nice, new lot, instead of
being next to the Libe where it always was and
where according to the elementary logical
processes of the students it naturally should be,
is moved around in back of the Libe.
So now the story of the poor freshman 1
changes from one of falling into holes to falling
dead on the Libe steps after gasping out the
news of the Battle of Marathon, as did that
storied Greek runner.
And the planners in the Felton Libe (or is it
the Rare Book Room?) plan next, we hear, to
move the lake so it won't be so near the boat
house. Someone might fall in.â€”Vic Minahan
