### AMIE REICHERT 
JT'S THE same story again, it's Singapore all over
again. In Java today Japanese airplanes are bomb
ing and machine-gunning Allied troops at will. Again
enemy air power is striking, striking hard and almost
unchallenged.
With this latest development in the Java situation,
there seems little hope that the last of the Netherlands
Indies islands can hold out very much longer. Plans
for retreat behind the strategic volcanic mountain
range that runs almost the length of the island must
go by the board now. When the enemy has complete
air superiority, as is the case now, fortified strong
holds are worthless—Singapore proved that.
Yes, it looks as though Java is all but lost, and
once the Japanese have completed the kill, they will
be able to turn their full forces against Burma, finish
up there, and get to work on Australia.
Already they are bombarding Australia's great base
and main harbor, Port Darwin. And the three-day
lull in Burma has been full of reports that they are
massing great forces for one last drive that will cut
down Rangoon and close the Burma Road.
The Japanese tactics resemble closely those which
Adolf Hitler employed with nothing but success until
he bumped into the Russian bear. The winning com
bination employed by the Japanese in Java follows
the pattern of the traditional German blitzkrieg.
First comes the preliminary infiltration by jungle
troops, then clearing of the highways by low-flying
dive bombers, and fin-illy the advance by tanks and
mechanized units.
After these last have come through, you pick up
what is left of your enemy, dust him off, stir well, and
bake in moderate oven.

jpOR a few days there, it looked as though the Allies
were at last going to give the Japanese a real
fight in exchange for all they have gobbled up in
the Pacific in the last three months. Yesterday's re
ports of the fighting in Java were vague, but they
looked promising for the Allies.
And the most encouraging and exciting news of all
told of Allied air superiority over the Japanese. For
the first time, the reports said, Allied airpower was
supreme over the Indies.
Today the situation is so completely, so alarm
ingly reversed that it is almost incredible.
The answer to this one might be that the American
and British airplanes have been withdrawn to buttress
defenses in India and Australia.
The Allies aren't only losing because of this, though.
Reports from Java tell of Japanese tank columns over
powering Dutch tanks because the enemy units are
heavier and better gunned.
So it looks as though the United Nations are giv
ing up the Java ghost.
As for the next stand—lndia or Australia—no one
knows what is going on over there. Apparently great
plans for strengthening defenses there are being
pushed ahead rapidly.
It is more than likely that they will be put to a test
within the month.

fight in exchange for all they have gobbled up in
the Pacific in the last three months. Yesterday's re
ports of the fighting in Java were vague, but they
looked promising for the Allies.
And the most encouraging and exciting news of all
told of Allied air superiority over the Japanese. For
the first time, the reports said, Allied airpower was
supreme over the Indies.
Today the situation is so completely, so alarm
ingly reversed that it is almost incredible.
The answer to this one might be that the American
and British airplanes have been withdrawn to buttress
defenses in India and Australia.
The Allies aren't only losing because of this, though.
Reports from Java tell of Japanese tank columns over
powering Dutch tanks because the enemy units are
heavier and better gunned.
So it looks as though the United Nations are giv
ing up the Java ghost.
As for the next stand—lndia or Australia—no one
knows what is going on over there. Apparently great
plans for strengthening defenses there are being
pushed ahead rapidly.
It is more than likely that they will be put to a test
within the month.
JT'S THE same story again, it's Singapore all over
again. In Java today Japanese airplanes are bomb
ing and machine-gunning Allied troops at will. Again
enemy air power is striking, striking hard and almost
unchallenged.
With this latest development in the Java situation,
there seems little hope that the last of the Netherlands
Indies islands can hold out very much longer. Plans
for retreat behind the strategic volcanic mountain
range that runs almost the length of the island must
go by the board now. When the enemy has complete
air superiority, as is the case now, fortified strong
holds are worthless—Singapore proved that.
Yes, it looks as though Java is all but lost, and
once the Japanese have completed the kill, they will
be able to turn their full forces against Burma, finish
up there, and get to work on Australia.
Already they are bombarding Australia's great base
and main harbor, Port Darwin. And the three-day
lull in Burma has been full of reports that they are
massing great forces for one last drive that will cut
down Rangoon and close the Burma Road.
The Japanese tactics resemble closely those which
Adolf Hitler employed with nothing but success until
he bumped into the Russian bear. The winning com
bination employed by the Japanese in Java follows
the pattern of the traditional German blitzkrieg.
First comes the preliminary infiltration by jungle
troops, then clearing of the highways by low-flying
dive bombers, and fin-illy the advance by tanks and
mechanized units.
After these last have come through, you pick up
what is left of your enemy, dust him off, stir well, and
bake in moderate oven.
