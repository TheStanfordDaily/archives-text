IMPROVE ENCINA?
r are several men in the administration who
for some time now have sought to improve condi
tions in Encina. By improve they do not mean the
imposition of additional restraints on the freshmen
but rather the betterment of the actual living ac
commodations there.
These men have long felt that three men to a room
very nearly constitutes overcrowding. They have also
felt that Encina rooms are too poorly furnished.
Another detrimental factor of the three-man room
is that the chances to study vary inversely with the
numbr of men in a room, while the tendency to dis
cuss unacademic topics varies proportionately.
This did not matter a great deal before the Quad
was closed to night studying but now with the Li
brary brim full most of the time it is increasingly
important to be able to study in one's room.

r is certainly a good case against such im
provements at the present time. Fortunately the
decision rests in the hands of men who are progres
sively minded and far sighted, as well as being acutely
aware of the Stanford's position today.
Two obstacles arise at once when it is sought to
lower the number of men in Encina. The first ques
tion is where would these men live, and the second is,
would the reduction in revenue resulting from fewer
occupants be a serious loss to the University.
There are at present 550 men in Encina. Of these
:J9O are frosh. The others are graduates, sponsors, and
lower division students entering with some credit. If
Encina was exclusively for freshmen and sponsors
there would be accommodation to spare for them
without the necessity of crowding three men into each
of 130 rooms.
Male registration at Stanford may decrease because
of the war and if this is the case then the accommo
dation of these men other than frosh should be no
problem at least for the immediate future.
The question of finance is a pertinent one. It has
been estimated that the elimination of three-man
rooms in Encina and the accompanying reduction in
occupants would mean a loss in revenue of $10,000. On
the other hand, because of the possibility of decreased
enrollment the revenue from room rents may fall of!
anyway and the men who are now living in Encina
could be accommodated in Toyon, Branner, or Se
quoia.
It is unfortunate that not until recently has the
desire to improve Encina arisen. Already some action
has been taken, and as the opportunity presents itself,
more and more improvements will be undertaken.

important to be able to study in one's room.

r is certainly a good case against such im
provements at the present time. Fortunately the
decision rests in the hands of men who are progres
sively minded and far sighted, as well as being acutely
aware of the Stanford's position today.
Two obstacles arise at once when it is sought to
lower the number of men in Encina. The first ques
tion is where would these men live, and the second is,
would the reduction in revenue resulting from fewer
occupants be a serious loss to the University.
There are at present 550 men in Encina. Of these
:J9O are frosh. The others are graduates, sponsors, and
lower division students entering with some credit. If
Encina was exclusively for freshmen and sponsors
there would be accommodation to spare for them
without the necessity of crowding three men into each
of 130 rooms.
Male registration at Stanford may decrease because
of the war and if this is the case then the accommo
dation of these men other than frosh should be no
problem at least for the immediate future.
The question of finance is a pertinent one. It has
been estimated that the elimination of three-man
rooms in Encina and the accompanying reduction in
occupants would mean a loss in revenue of $10,000. On
the other hand, because of the possibility of decreased
enrollment the revenue from room rents may fall of!
anyway and the men who are now living in Encina
could be accommodated in Toyon, Branner, or Se
quoia.
It is unfortunate that not until recently has the
desire to improve Encina arisen. Already some action
has been taken, and as the opportunity presents itself,
more and more improvements will be undertaken.
IMPROVE ENCINA?
r are several men in the administration who
for some time now have sought to improve condi
tions in Encina. By improve they do not mean the
imposition of additional restraints on the freshmen
but rather the betterment of the actual living ac
commodations there.
These men have long felt that three men to a room
very nearly constitutes overcrowding. They have also
felt that Encina rooms are too poorly furnished.
Another detrimental factor of the three-man room
is that the chances to study vary inversely with the
numbr of men in a room, while the tendency to dis
cuss unacademic topics varies proportionately.
This did not matter a great deal before the Quad
was closed to night studying but now with the Li
brary brim full most of the time it is increasingly
important to be able to study in one's room.
