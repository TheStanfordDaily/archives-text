# CAMPUS OPINION
## PACK OF WOLVES 
### 
r pilE EDITOR, SIR:
Stanford men have been considered a frustrated
pack of wolves ever since I arrived (my singular ar
rival had no significance, it was the coming of my par
ticular type of reserved green pea in droves that made
the males into the dubious men they are today).
Standing in the Union, subtly thumbing through "U.S.
Camera, I have often heard unrestrained commotions
behind me (again, my aft view had no significance).
It was a bunch of Encina finks panting over a Petty
or a Varga or what-have-you. And then yesterday
in Bull Session, when the slinger of that column said
he failed to understand what the reader was doing
there—that being the fashion issue. I as usual pooh
poohed the implication that those models had any
thing the rest of us haven't got. But in the same issue,
fellas, I got the idea! Gorsh, there was a picture of a
swimmer in there that really endizzened me. Now. I
know why they're called "mermen." I swear I'll bite
him if I ever see him on Quad. Have you any more
pictures like those? They send me.
Ripely.
