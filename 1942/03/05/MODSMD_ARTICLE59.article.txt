# Dr. Hardin Craig Quits Farm To Teach at North Carolina
## 
### PETE RENNET 
Dr. Hardin Craig, distinguished Stanford authority 011 the Renaissance
and English Literature, is leaving Stanford.
He will teach English at (lie University of North Carolina in Chapel
Hill for the spring quarter this year and possibly for a longer period, de
pending on the war. He will teach at the University of lowa during the

summer quarter.
"I'm not leaving, really. I'm still
a member of the family and devoted
to Stanford, but I want to devote
time to writing and research, and I
need the proximity of a large li
brary. I may settle in Pasadena near
the Huntington Library and work
there. But the war makes every
thing seem very uncertain," said Dr.
Craig, in explaining why he is sell
ing his house and probably will not
return to Stanford if he decides to
do research.
Dr. Craig came to Stanford in
1929 as professor of English follow
ing a brilliant teaching career at
Princeton, Minnesota, and lowa. He
graduated from Centre College in
Kentucky in 1897 and received his
Ph.D. from Princeton four years
later.
A very popular and influential
lecturer. Dr. Craig also devotes a
great deal of time to research and
writing for publication. Many of his
students contributed articles to a
book in his honor, "Renaissance
Studies in Honor of Hardin Craig,"
published by the Stanford Univer
sity Press in the summer of 1941
with the co-operation of the Univer
sity of lowa and Stanford.
Amazingly active at 67, his classes
do not prevent him from being a
profuse writer and ardent golfer.
His work includes "The Enchanted
Glass," a scholarly book on the Ren
aissance; "Current Literature on the
Renaissance," a bibliography pub
lished yearly since 1924 in "Studies
in Philology"; and numerous other
articles on Shakespeare, Renaissance
drama, and the English Renaissance
in general in books and magazines.
He edited the successful first vol
ume of "Stanford Studies in Lan
guage and Literature" last year and
is now finishing work on a complete
edition of Shakespeare's work to be
published later this year.
English literature of the Renais
sance classes next fall will be taught
by Dr. Hoyt H. Hudson, now pro
fessor of English and head of the
English department at Princeton. Dr.
Hudson also will teach some classes
formerly offered by the late Profes
sor William Dinsmore Briggs.
