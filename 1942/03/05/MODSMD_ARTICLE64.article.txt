# Price Rises Hit Farm Bookstore
## 
### 
Insistent rises in price have now
hit the Stanford Bookstore. All
commodities which must be reor
dered will rise in price with each
reorder. Even textbooks go up 16
to 50 cents over original price when
reordered.
All commodities ordered ahead on
a co-operative basis will be avail
able to students at no rise in prices,
however. The Bookstore has a year's
supply of paper on hand and, de
spite the general boom in paper,
Bookstore prices will remain as
usual.
Another problem is materials on
priority lists, especially metals.
Biology equipment, however, is lim
ited but available at regular prices.
