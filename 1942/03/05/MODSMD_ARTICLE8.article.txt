# Collins Asks Student War Volunteers
## Positions Still Open In Stainps, Salvage And War Activities 
### 
Although a fair number of Stan- j
ford students signed up yesterday
for work in connection with the
Stanford War Activities yesterday,
Boh Collins, co-ordinator, sent out
the plea that not half enough have
signed up to do all the necessary
work.
He urged students who are intcr
stcd in any of the thre fields of the
campus war activities — salvage,
stamps, and bonds, or U.S.O. work—
to sign up from 2 to 5 p.m. in room I
13 in the Old Union.
ONK IN EACH HOUSE
"It is going to have to be a large
group," Collins said, "one responsible
person in each Living group."
He emphasized the fact that the
work will be done for the sake of the
work itself and not for any favor
able publicity connected with it.
Ed Porter, co-chairman of the
salvage division of the program,
asked for volunteers to help with
the collecting of material for sal
vage.
He said that he hoped that some
one in each living group would vol
unteer to manage the collection un
til the organiaztion is completed.
This managing would consist mainly
of putting a container in the hall or I
bathroom for people to leave their J
old articles.
START IMMEDIATELY
Porter emphasized the necessity of
beginning immediately since the
end of the quarter is so near and
even now people are beginning to !
discard articles they no longer want.
As an example, he mentioned Un
ion, where the girls have already
changed rooms for next quarter but
even though nothing had been done
through the salvage division, boxes
had been placed in the halls for col
lecting old artieles.
Articles which are wanted arc:
1.. Magazines
2. Newspapers
.Razor blades
4. Toothpaste tubes
5. Records
(>. Books
7. ClotheS
8. Rags
!> Old shoes
10. Old radios
New magazines, all usable mate
rial, will be given to Army encamp
ments. The injured from Pearl Har
bor who are being treated in hospi
tals around the Bay Area will be
given magazines and books.
