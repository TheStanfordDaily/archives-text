# Indians Aim To Wipe Out Series Jinx
## Redskins Get Chance To Dump California Four Games Straight 
### 
Stanford has never beaten Cali
fornia at basketball four times
straight—tonight and tomorrow the
Redskins get another try as they
meet the Bears in the last two regu
lar conference games of the season.
Tonight's contest starts at 8 in the
Pavilion, tomorrow's at 8:15 at the
Berkeley gymnasium.
Coach Everett Dean plans to start
his regular squad of Don Bumess
and Jim Pollard, forwards; Bill
Cowden and Howie Dallmar, guards;
and Ed Voss, center. Though its sec
and straight southern division title
is safely tucked away, Stanford goes
out to win the Bear series.
Nibs Price, Cal coach, has uncov
ered a new flash, Bill Durkee, who
will probably start at center in place
of the towering but ineffective Bill
Farley. Remainder of the Bear
line-up is as usual: Merv Lafaille
and Roy Tamm, forwards, Jim
Bailey and Bob Alameida, guards.
California last week split its last
two games with U.C.L.A. as Bruin
forward Ernie Handelsman high
scored the southerners to victory in

foot-4 senior center. When Mandic
is in the line-up, the Beavers are at
their best, but without him they
bog down.
Teaming with Mandic on the first
string are Sam Dement and Paul
Valenti at forwards and Don Dur
dan, thq footballer, and high-scor
ing Lew Beck at guards. Dement
and Valenti, both two-year letter
men, are tall and are good shots.
George McNutt and Jack Mulder
arc reserve forwards, but will sec
considerable action. Gill's men do
not have a fast break, but score
plenty of points on their long set
shots and rebounds.
The first team to win two games
will win the series and the P.C.C.
title. The champion will go east in
the subsequent week-ends to play
in the N.C.A.A. play-offs at Kansas
City.
Stanford has never beaten Cali
fornia at basketball four times
straight—tonight and tomorrow the
Redskins get another try as they
meet the Bears in the last two regu
lar conference games of the season.
Tonight's contest starts at 8 in the
Pavilion, tomorrow's at 8:15 at the
Berkeley gymnasium.
Coach Everett Dean plans to start
his regular squad of Don Bumess
and Jim Pollard, forwards; Bill
Cowden and Howie Dallmar, guards;
and Ed Voss, center. Though its sec
and straight southern division title
is safely tucked away, Stanford goes
out to win the Bear series.
Nibs Price, Cal coach, has uncov
ered a new flash, Bill Durkee, who
will probably start at center in place
of the towering but ineffective Bill
Farley. Remainder of the Bear
line-up is as usual: Merv Lafaille
and Roy Tamm, forwards, Jim
Bailey and Bob Alameida, guards.
California last week split its last
two games with U.C.L.A. as Bruin
forward Ernie Handelsman high
scored the southerners to victory in
one encounter.
