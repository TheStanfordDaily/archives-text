# Humanities School Will Open in Fall
## New School to Give B.A., Include History, Philosophy, Letters 
### 
Establishment next September of
a new School of Humanities was an
nounced yesterday by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur of Stanford Uni
versity at a luncheon at the Bohe
mian Club at which he and Lewis
Mumford were the speakers.
'"The energies of the modern
world have gone into the making of
machines," Mumford said. "We have
tended to forget that the chief task
of every civilization is the humani
zation of man in society, and that if
men do not succeed in this task they
relapse into barbarism. Nine spe
cialists do not add up to a whole
man."
The curriculum of the new school
is designed to assist the student in
acquiring a grasp of the past devel
opment. of western civilization and
its relation to the social, cultural,
and philosophic forces shaping life
in the modern world.
The school will confer the bache
lor's degree on a select group of
able students who have pursued an
integrated program of studies. While
the student may elect much of his
work in the department of his ma
jor interest, he may also concentrate
on a specific field or area, such as
the Renaissance, romanticism, lit
erary criticism, or American civili
zation and its background.
The new school will be a successor
to the present School of Letters and
will embrace, in addition to the de
partments in that school, the De
partments of History and Philosophy.
