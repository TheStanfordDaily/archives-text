# Athletic Awards For Women Stop
## 
### 
After freshman and sophomore
women had voted against having
athletic awards for women in a poll
taken Monday night, the W.A.A.
passed a motion stating that after
this year women will not receive
athletic awards for the duration of
the war. In spite of the result of the
poll, the board discussed the ques
tion for 45 minutes before reach
ing their decision.
