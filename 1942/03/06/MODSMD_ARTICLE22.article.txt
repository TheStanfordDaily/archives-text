# British Economist Describes Post-War World Trade Plans
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
The British and American govern
ments will attempt to formulate defi
nite means for the expansion of post
war world trade at conferences
which will probably begin within a
few weeks.
This official plan was explained by
Dr. Redvers Opie, economic adviser
of the British Embassy at Washing
ton, in a lecture at the Education
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
"When we have drawn up an
agenda of the methods on which we
agree, then we will submit our plans
to other like-minded nations," Dr.
Opie said. "But we are not going to
start out with a grand economic con
ference. We will take the problem in
bits."
Object of these Anglo-American
plans will be to attain better world
wide economic relations, according
to the terms of a recently issued
Anglo-American agreement con
cerning their mutual assistance in
fighting the Axis. Dr. Opie empha

sized Ihc fact that this agreement
overrode national interests with a
view to world prosperity.
"We have neglected international
economic institutions in the past,"
Dr. Opie said. '"Most of the eco
nomic machinery for the next peace
will be constructed during this war."
An example of such machinery is
the Anglo-American Raw Materials
Board in Washington, according to
Dr. Opie. This board controls the
nature, volume, and destinations of
American and British exports.
"We also have a joint shipping
board which is rationing virtually
all the shipping in the world, on all
the routes in the world, to all the
ports in the world," Dr. Opie said.
"This organization will be invalu
able in the post-war world."
Dr. Opie concluded his talk with
the statement that the American
and British people must agree on
the kind of economic war controls
which they want to retain after the
wiir.
