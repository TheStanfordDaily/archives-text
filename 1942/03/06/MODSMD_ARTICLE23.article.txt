# Japs Say Batavia Falls As Hard Battles Rage; Soerabaja Endangered
## Dutch Forces Had Abandoned Java's Capital

MANDALAY, March 4 (UP). —
Japanese forces, including
mechanized units, have succeeded in
crossing to the west bank of the
Sittang River and have reached
Waw, 15 tnilcs cast of Pegu on the
Rangoon-Mandalay-Lashio railway,
front dispatches said tonight.
Earlier an official communique
had admitted that certain Japanese
units had crossed the Sittang, last
river barrier between the main
Japanese advance and the Rangoon-
Mandalay communications line, and
had made contact with British patrols
which were carrying out a scorched
earth policy as they withdrew.
PEGU THREATENED
The crossing in force, followed
earlier crossings by large numbers
of Japanese jungle troops which
have infiltrated deep into Burma
proper.
The dispatches indicated that the
whole Pegu railway junction area
was in danger.
Rangoon remains quiet, but there
has been some lawlessness — espe
cially against defenseless Indians at
Hanthawaddy.
NATIVES REBEL
Front dispatches hinted at in
creasing fifth-column activity by
anti-British native groups and indi
cated the most serious immediate
situation was caused by increasing
infiltrations of the Japanese jungle
forces which were receiving assist
ance from the native rebels.
The infiltrations, it was said, were
almost impossible to stop since the
Japanese groups — ranging in num
bers from 10 to 100—were following
jungle paths and attacking by night,
when they cannot be spotted by
British planes.
