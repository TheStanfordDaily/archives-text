# Civil Air Patrol Needs Helpers
## Day-Shift Guards Wanted for Airports 
### 
The Civil Air Patrol at Stanford
today issues its second appeal for
helpers. It emphasized the need for
day-shift guards for airport patrol.
Participation in the C.A.P. is pointed
out as an excellent opportunity for
anyone who wants to help in the
national effort.
The C.A.P. also announced today
that it has received a designation
from Washington as Squadron 3,
Group 2, of the California Wing, but
it is still to be notified by the army
to start flying.
A new navigation class started
last night at 2815 Middlefield Road
on Mondays and Wednesdays at 7:15
p.m. Anyone interested in this
course is urged to attend. Next
quarter new classes in radio, first
aid, meteorology, and engines will
be started.
The response to the C.A.P.'s first
call was excellent, but it still needs
more men and women who might
be interested in participation. Infor
mation may be obtained from Lynn
Croft or Janet McClanahan at the
Dec Gee house, P.A. 8835, or from
Bill Ballhaus at the Theta Xi house,
P.A. 8760.
