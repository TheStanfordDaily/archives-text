## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 5 (UP).—
A proposal that the United States
make a "token" relaxation of the
Oriental Exclusion Act as a friendly
gesture to Asiatic peoples resisting
the Axis, is under study in govern
ment quarters, it was disclosed to
night.
The plan is part of a program,
which Great Britain is being urged
to support, to rally the teeming na
tive populations of Asia around the
United Nations standard.
The act was passed in 1912 and
tightened up in 1924 at the insist
ence of Pacific Coast labor groups
which bitterly opposed immigration
of "cheap labor" — chiefly Chinese
and Japanese coolie workers.
