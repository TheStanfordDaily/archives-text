# Probation Men Can Move 'In'
## 
### 
Stanford fraternity men on proba
! lion will be allowed to move into
their houses next quarter. This was
(be decision of the Interfraternity
Council in its meeting at the Alpha
Sig house last night, acting on the
recommendation of the Interfrater
nity Board.
Whether or not the 47 students
now on probation will continue to
live in their fraternities will depend
on their scholastic improvement
shown next quarter, said Jim Haugh,
Interfraternity president.
Striking another blow at the cau
cus system, the Row group decided
to nominate its officers this quarter
and elect them early next quarter
J before regular elections. It is hoped
this will eliminate politics usually
accompanying these elections.
President Haugh announced the
decision of the Interfraternity Board
to buy $300 worth of defense bonds
with the fines collected from the
! Sigma Chi's and Sigma Nu's as pen
alties for violating off-campus rush
ing rules.
Bob Collins, Stanford War Ac
tivities Co-ordinator, spoke briefly
to the group, advocating that they
push the sales of defense bonds and
stamps in the individual houses.
A discussion of the deferred win
{ ter quarter rushing system con
cluded the meeting.
