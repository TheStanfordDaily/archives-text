# Five-Day Summer Paper Considered
##

Ilal Shafer, Dan Lewis, and Jim
McKellar were appointed to inves
tigate the possibility of publishing
The Daily five times a week during
the Summer Quarter at a meeting
of Publications Council Wednes
day. They will make a report next
week.
Previously, The Daily has ap
peared only twice a week during the
summer. However, with the inau
guration of a full four-quarter aca
demic system, The Daily may also
go on an all-year schedule, accord
ing to Shafer, Council chairman.
