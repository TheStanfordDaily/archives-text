# Pollard Shoots at Title
## 
### 
Battling right now for the scoring
championship is Stanford's towering
Jim Pollard.
Jimmy, fast for his height, is mak- i
ing his bid for the title on the ;
strength of recent scoring sprees;
for early in the season he was way
off and fans began to wonder what
had happened to the "second Lui
setti" on offense.
Jim for a while wasn't working on
his push shots every afternoon as he '
did when he was a freshman. After
being ineligible for the early games. |
he didn't get his eye till well along !
in the season. Even now he is not ;
fully up to the expectations of his I
supporters and fans can look for an j
even greater game from the tall J
forward in future tilts.
While his shooting was off, Jimmy !

. displayed a defensive game and
floor play thrilling to watch. When
j he stretches out in all directions in
i front of his man in the shifting zone, ;
' a long shot over him or a bounce 1
pass around him are equally im
possible.
Stealing the ball or batting out an
intended pass are common occur- j
rences when the enemy gets down
j in Pollard's territory. He reminds
j you of a cat.
Although he may have seemed j
ragged at the first of the season, Jim
is really a veteran. After wowing j
the Oakland preps, he went to Den
ver with Golden State, and after be
ing strongly attracted "to U.S.C. he
| became a sensation all over again ;
with the Stanford frosh.
And he's only a sophomore now! j
