# Hate Thine Enemy?
## 
### 
IN a recent letter to Secretary of the Navy
Frank Knox, Homer D. Swander, Jr., president
of the Student League of America, protested
strongly against the Navy's announced program
of employing psychologists to "engender in
aviation cadets a hate for our enemies and their
methods."
Mr. Swander points out that Americans hate
the ideas that the Germans, Italians and Japs
stand for, but that if American youth is taught
to hate our enemies as peoples and individuals,
hope for any kind of a successful peace after
the war will be dealt a severe blow.
This is a very intelligent criticism. In addi
tion to Mr. Swander's suggestion that the pro
gram would endanger the post-war peace, it
should be added that men will fight better and
more consistently if they are inspired by a prin
ciple rather than by an artificially created hate
for their opponents.
Hate, like all emotions, is not lasting—it rises
quickly to its peak, and subsides equally fast,
leaving behind it a bitter sense of exhaustion
and futility.
On the other hand, persons who fight for a
positive principle in which they have a firm and
lasting belief not only fight more intelligently,
they are able to keep fighting under all sorts of
duress and misfortunes.—Vic Minahan
Women's Athletic Association members
should be proud of their co-operative action
in refusing their customary annual Stanford
blanket awards. This year they have voted
instead to give the $150 to the government
victory effort through the purchase of bonds
or by some other patriotic means.
