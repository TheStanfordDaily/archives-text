SPRING, as it must to all men, came to The
Daily yesterday. It's been peering around
corners and out from under the coke machine
for some time now, but the staff has been heroi
cally ignoring its warm, enervating presence.
But last night the editor saw the moon, and,
in the parlance, became a gone gosling. Staff
morale hasn't been worth a nickel since. This
is not a local situation. All over the campus
spring has been insidiously gnawing at the roots
of the Stanford social structure—like a termite.
The libe is deserted. The lake is cluttered
with canoes and play-suits.
Men and women of Stanford, unite against
this alien climatic condition. Ignore its siren
call. Need we remind you that finals are prac
tically upon us?
This spring is part of a gigantic plot, per
sonally conceived by unctuous Adolf Hitler to
undermine civilian morale. When we are
sleepy, and warm, and happy because it's
spring, the Axis will strike. (Everyone knows
that the Germans and the Japanese have no
souls, and thus cannot possibly enjoy the
weather.) —Jean Nowell
