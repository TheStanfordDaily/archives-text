•"THE DAILY TROJAN last week commented
i. on the success of Stanford's defense set-up,
saying that air raid warnings were "old stuff"
on the Farm now.
The article, appearing in the "Potpourri from
Other Colleges" column, asked why the Uni
versity of Southern California had had no prac
tice blackouts and pointed out that Stanford
had already gone through the whole routine
six times.
The southern school is in even more of a
danger zone than we are, at least in the past
few weeks. U.S.C. is located right in the city of
Los Angeles and the fact that the school has had
no blackout experience would serve to indicate
that Stanford is relatively on her toes.-
