### AMIE REICHERT 
issue of the quarter, boys and girls. Outside it
is bright and warm and it smells like daffodils and
gasoline fumes. Huzza, it's spring. Huzza for spring
and for finals and for sun and for finals and for day
light saving and for finals and for flowering plum
trees and for finals.
Don't say this cheering section we have set up
here doesn't belong in the "History column." Just
give me time, boys and girls; I'll justify myself be
fore I'm through.
You can sit in the Shack at all times of day and
night, at all seasons of the year, and you won't know
the difference, because the windows are all blacked
out now and the only light in the place comes from
the small corner where sits the wiiter of this column.
You can sit at this desk and read the reports that
come over the U.P. machine and you won't know the
difference, because the news is all bad, all the same.
You can't tell this is the season of rebirth because the
news doesn't know it. The news knows only that this
season, all seasons this year are seasons of death and
destruction and decay and disaster.
Hold it, Adolf. Don't you know what season this
is, it's spring and I have to study for finals and lie
in the sun and I can't wjiile you are raising hell all
over the world.
Please, Mr. Tojo, I have to go now; I can't keep
track of the yellow pins in my map which have al
ready polka-dotted the Pacific, when the sun is so
hot outside and besides I have to cram for a religion ex.
Whyn't you guys relax and take things easy, at
least until the next snow falls?

J| HAVE BEEN prowling through the dispatches on
this desk and if it weren't for the fact that I have
such a lovely disposition, I should be quite glum and
sour by now, even if it is spring.
I read about the war and how we are losing it,
about a bunch of Congressmen fighting and beating
the tense Washington air because they are upset and
yet they can't do anything about it.
I read about bombing and killing, a few suicides, a
little sabotage, a juicy triple murder, taxes, evacua
tion orders, taxes again, a drop in the stock market, a
lady that burned to death because her dress caught in
a stove, and a janitors' strike in the Fox West Coast
theaters.
But, it's still spring no matter what, and all this is
compatible with the spring that the world of 1941 must
know.
You see, you can fool yourself and say it is the same
spring, but the fact is it isn't at all; it's'a new spring
and this is how the people of Oregon will meet it
and recognize it:
"Portland. Ore., March 5 (UP).—Oregon beer dis
tributors tonight decreed a 'dry Wednesday' in Mult
nomah County. They announced that no beer will be
moved on Wednesdays for the duration of the war to
save on tires."
Well, Oregon, if you weren't mad at Hitler before,
get mad!
Happy finals.
