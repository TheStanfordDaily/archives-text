to Aesop, a boy walking and his
father riding a donkey met a traveller who called
the old man lazy and said the son should ride. So
they changed. The next passer said they both should
ride. So they did.
A third stranger called them cruel, saying they
should not burden the donkey, but carry him. So they
carried him. Crossing a wobbly bridge the donkey
toppled from their shoulders into the stream and was
carried away. They then had no choice but to both
walk.
Dr. Wilbur justly said keep studying, harder. Oth
ers advise joining reserves. Some say join now, the
battle is more important than studies. On one hand
we are urged to live "as usual"; on the other we are
asked to put our every thought and action on a war
basis.
The student heeding all these conflicting advices is
in the quandary of the father and son and will lose
his studies as the donkey was lost.
Looking ahead, planning, and being well informed
seems to be as sure an antidote as any against this
sort of thing, for then advice is seldom necessary.

that people are tired of singing "Winsocki" the
all-American cry has become "Get ofT the dime."
In all too many instances this is merely what psychol
ogists call projection. Often people locate their own
faults in others, and the resulting public criticism is
merely a rationalization of their own shortcomings.
It looks very much as though this is the case today.
There is certainly no defense for complacency, but on
the other hand the public leaders who cry the loudest
are frequently "projecting" their own inabilities when
they criticize the public.

An informal is being held Friday at the golf club
house by an up-row sorority. Their slogan should be
"Twice as much room in the parking lot as on the
dance floor."
With this issue The Daily shuts down for finals and
spring vacation. See you at the lake.
