# CAMPUS OPINION
## THANKS, EVERYBODY 
### 
r pilE EDITOR. SIR:
Officially the Stanford Family Call is a thing of
the past. But the money continues to roll in. both from
tardy callers and from alumni who have kept their
promises and sent money by mail. Tabulation of final
results will not be complete for two weeks yet. As
the Daily has stated, this Call Drive has broken all
records to date. More people have commented upon
the enjoyable time spent with Stanford couples this
year than ever before.
These couples, one hundred and twenty-eight call
ers in all, have made the drive a real success. Their
results show that, and I believe credit should go
where credit is due. I enjoyed my part because I had
a real gang to work with—to do the REAL work. I
want to thank each couple for a lot of time spent and
for real effort—and it DOES take real effort to make
these calls. I appreciate having worked with you, and
I «know the University appreciates your accomplish
mtwit. This goes for the couples who brought in noth
ing. as well as for those who turned in checks of $100
and up. And especially do I want to thank Helen
Knight. Jack Pugh. Vern Edler, and Marge Gestring
for their co-operation, ideas, and honest-to-goodness
drudgery. Gang. YOU put the Drive over. Thanks.
Sincerely,
Bob Crary, Chairman.
Stanford Family Council
