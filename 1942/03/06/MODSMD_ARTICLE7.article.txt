# Sparkle, Charm Denote Farm's Period Opera
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
If you like 18th century music,
much of it blithely and quite shame
lessly hacked out of Handel, if you
like delightful costuming and excel
lent staging, if you like 18th century
humor (which is pretty basic), then
you will like "The Beggar's Opera."
I did.
John Gay was gagging it up, in the
rococco manner, and his subject was
Italian opera. He thought this opera
stufT was pretty funny, and his bur
lesque quite adequately expressed
his point ol view. Some of the gags,
which might have killed Queen
Anne s courtiers, miss their punch
today, but his cracks about more
universal things like women, and
crime, are every bit as good as they
were.
GOOD PERFORMANCES
Best voice of the evening belonged
to Ted Uppman. Best comedy per
formances were given Robert O'Neill
and John High. However, there
was little to quibble about in any
of the performances. Louise Barker,
as Mrs. Peacham, did not have the
voice to make the words of her
songs carry, but the rest of the major
singers managed this problem with
out too much difficulty.

Both Marjorie Benson and Beta
Popper looked exactly right, and
sang and acted well. Their first
quarrel scene was excellently done.
But the major point about "The
Beggar's Opera" is its charm, and
no pains have been spared to give
the show the mountings it needs.
From the sets, with their wicked little
cupids, to the orchestra, correctly
costumed to the period, it is just
right.
Musical Director Herbert Jan
Popper did a magnificent job. It's
appalling to hear that delicious mu
sic coupled with such naughty lyrics
â€”but it's fun.
IT HAS ITS PLACE
There's a definite place today for
"The Beggar's Opera." An evening's
entertainment, posing no problems,
and expecting no answers, it per
mits the audience to sink into a
mood of relaxed pleasure. The pace
is leisurely, and the effect is thor
oughly right for the show. Director
Strickland knows his stuff.
However, if you like slam-bang,
gag-a-minute, musicals, double en
tendre instead of flat statement, and
jazz to the exclusion of everything
else, I submit that "The Beggar's
Opera" is not your dish.
