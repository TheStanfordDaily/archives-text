dismissed, Dr. O. N. Anderson, gen

when it expires next September."
CAN'T ASSURE' COACHES
Dr. Anderson said the coach mis
understood him when he told Mr.
Thornton that the Board of Athletic
Control could not "assure" him of
his reappointment.
"I talked to certain coaches and
told them the Board cannot reassure
them of their reappointments. I told
them that if they want to look else
where, it would probably be better
for them than to wait around to see
it their contracts will be renewed."
S. F. REPORT

per reported yesterday that Thorn
ton had definitely been dismissed
and had accepted a teaching posi
tion at Kansas State College. The

means "minor sports are slated for
the discard at Stanford."
In answer to this statement, Dr.
Anderson said, "Due to uncertainty
of income to the Board, we will set
up a program which will come with
in our plans anticipating a reduced
income. There will not be a cur
tailment of minor sports, but we
may find it necessary to use graduate
students as coaches."
NO PLANS
Concerning the statement about
his accepting (he Kansas position,
Thornton said, "I don't know where
they get that information. I have
not made any plans for the future
in case the contract is not renewed."
If the financial position of the

sition rugby, boxing, soccer and
other minor sports coaches may not
have their contracts renewed next

Anderson said, "Due to uncertainty
of income to the Board, we will set
up a program which will come with
in our plans anticipating a reduced
income. There will not be a cur
tailment of minor sports, but we
may find it necessary to use graduate
students as coaches."
NO PLANS
Concerning the statement about
his accepting (he Kansas position,
Thornton said, "I don't know where
they get that information. I have
not made any plans for the future
in case the contract is not renewed."

B.A.C. continues in its present po
sition rugby, boxing, soccer and
other minor sports coaches may not
have their contracts renewed next
fall, Dr. Anderson said.
A controversy arose yesterday as
to whether Norton Thornton, Farm
swimming and water polo coach,
will return next September when
his contract expires.
"Thornton definitely has not been
dismissed, Dr. O. N. Anderson, gen
eral director, School of Health, said
yesterday. However, Mr. Thornton
told The Daily, "Dr. Anderson told
me my contract will not be renewed
when it expires next September."
CAN'T ASSURE' COACHES
Dr. Anderson said the coach mis
understood him when he told Mr.
Thornton that the Board of Athletic
Control could not "assure" him of
his reappointment.
"I talked to certain coaches and
told them the Board cannot reassure
them of their reappointments. I told
them that if they want to look else
where, it would probably be better
for them than to wait around to see
it their contracts will be renewed."
S. F. REPORT
A San Francisco morning newspa
per reported yesterday that Thorn
ton had definitely been dismissed
and had accepted a teaching posi
tion at Kansas State College. The
article suggested that the "dismissal"
means "minor sports are slated for
the discard at Stanford."
In answer to this statement, Dr.
Anderson said, "Due to uncertainty
of income to the Board, we will set
up a program which will come with
in our plans anticipating a reduced
