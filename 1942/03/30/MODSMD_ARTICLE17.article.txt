### 

AS THE WAIt moves nearer Australia, giant battles for control of the
air arc taking place in the area mapped above. Port Moresby and
Darwin have received the heaviest Jap bombings, while the Allied
offensive, which it is claimed is growing daily, has been spread among
the several Jap bases shown. The Japs invaded New Guinea in Jan
uary at Salamua and Lae but have made little gains since then, al
though they have taken Kahaul on the island of New Britain. (Story
