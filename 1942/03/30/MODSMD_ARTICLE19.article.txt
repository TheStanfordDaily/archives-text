# Great Britain Promises India Dominion Status In Return for War Aid
## Measure Gives Nation Choice Of Independence 
### 
NEW DELHI, March 2!) (UP).—
Full doiiiiiiion status "at the ear
liest possible date" after the war is
Britain's oiler to India in return for
helping defeat the Axis, Sir Stafford
Cripps disclosed tonight in an official
statement on the proposals he had
discussed with Indian leaders during
the past week.
Whether the plan granted the In
dian demand for complete freedom
was a matter of interpretation, for
as a dominion, India would have the
right to secede at its own choice from
the British commonwealth.
The proposals drawn up by Prime
Minister Winston Churchill's war
cabinet had the appearance of a
wartime compromise which in es
sence told the two biggest political
groups in India—the All-India Con
gress and the Moslem League— to
fight with the British Empire now
and write their own tickets after
ward.
MAJOR CONCESSION
A major concession was a British
promise to accept a constitution
drafted by representatives of the
Indian people themselves.
The plan's greatest handicap
seemed to be its tacit recognition
that the Moslems could, if they
wished, establish their own dominion
outside Hindu India. The All-India
Congress always has insisted on the
unity and indivisibility of India.
The plan provided that any prov
ince—or provinces—had the right to
reject the new constitution and stay
out of the projected dominion union.
If it. did not enter the union, it. might
retain its present status under Brit
ish rule or frame its own constitu
tion, entitling it to the same privi
leges as the Indian union. It also
would be permitted to join the In
dian union later.
MINORITIES PROTECTED
The statement added that Britain
would negotiate with the Constitu
tional Assembly a treaty for protec
tion of racial and religious minori
ties.
It announced that Britain recog
nized its obligation to direct Indian
defenses during the war but realized
the need for Indian leaders to or
ganize Indian opinion and resources
behind the war.
It invited Indian leaders to co
operate to the fullest in the war
effort, which it pointed out was "a
task which is vital and essential for
the future freedom of India."
Sir Stafford, transmitting the pro
posals to the Indian populace for the
first, time, appealed to the press to
treat them seriously as affecting the
happiness and freedom of 350,000,000
people.
