With plans for collection of all sal- j
vage material accumulated by some
Farm living groups during winter
completed, E"d Porter, chairman of
the Salvage for Victory campaign j
here, announced yesterday that the |
program will be extended to all
campus groups during this quarter.
Among the articles which should
bo saved, according to Porter, are
scrap metal, waste paper, old rub
ber, and rags. Containers for each
of these articles will be placed in
each living group which has not as
yet been reached by the Salvage
Committee, and the material will be
collected at the end of each week.
PROFIT DISPOSAL
1 rofits obtained from selling the
salvage articles will be used to de
ii.iv expenses of the Stanford War
Activities Committee, under Co
ordinator Bob Collins.
]( is particularly important, ac- j
cu' ling to Porter, that all collapsible
met il tubes be saved, along with
ot 1;â–  t scrap metal.
PI,A'J TEN BOXES
All cartons and boxes which are !
turned in should be flattened out j
;.i d kept clean and dry, he said, and j
newspapers should be piled sepa
rately, and tied into bundles.
Silk stockings should be kept
separate from other rags, Porter
said, since they are used by the Red
Cross for making stretcher blankets.
The average value of a 1940 used !
car was about $350 for a good buy.
