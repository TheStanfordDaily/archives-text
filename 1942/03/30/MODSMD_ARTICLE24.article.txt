# Excom to Weigh Election Set-up
## 
### 
Whether student body elections
should be held as usual this quarter
or be changed to fit in with a four
quarter school year will be dis
cussed at this week's Excom meet
ing to be held either this evening
or tomorrow night. No one could
be reached for confirmation of the
exact time.
At the last meeting of winter
quarter, Harry Horton suggested
that the method of electing members
to Excom be changed so that they
would come from the departments
instead of the classes. He held that
because most students will be more
serious about their work from now
on and that one of the classes might
be eliminated with the new four
quarter system, his plan would be
more workable than the present
method.
If Horton's plan is adopted, the
English, history, journalism, and
other departments will be repre
sented. Because the discussion was
so involved, Excom decided not to
take any definite action until this
week.
At the meeting all members will
turn in a report concerning Horton's
suggestion.
