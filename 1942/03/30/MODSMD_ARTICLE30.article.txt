# 'Destruction' Wrecks Rest In Lagunita
## 
### LUCY THOMPSON 
Lagunita has mechanized termites.
Men with pneumatic drills are cut
| ting doors to the rooms in the
basement of the hall.
In the basement, there are rooms
i corresponding to the students' rooms
| above themâ€”but there are no d<>ors
j to the basement rooms. A basement
j is the safest place in a house in case
of an air raid, and, consequently,
doors are being cut in the Lagunita
I basements so that they may be used
I as a shelter in case of an air raid.
"There is not much construction
involved, but a lot of destruction,"
said Miss Doyle, Director of Resi
! dences.
The men work from 8 in the morn-
I ing to 5 in the afternoon. The noise
they make with the drills sounds as
if the building had an audible rag
ing headache. Sleep is impossible.
Students from Lagunita registered
early today.
