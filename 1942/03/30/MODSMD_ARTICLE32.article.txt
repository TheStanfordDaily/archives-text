### 
LONDON, March 2!* (UP).—Sur- !
vivors of the commando party which j
smashed the German submarine base
at St. Nazaire in a terrorizing Sat- |
nrday night raid were landed tri
umphantly today at a British port,
bringing new reports of widespread
destruction wreaked in that lair for
Atlantic U-boat wolf packs.
A communique, issued as soon as
the survivors were landed—some of
them on stretchers —said that not
only was the main lock of the St.
Nazaire dry dock destroyed when it
was rammed by the dynamite-laden
destroyer Campbeltown, the for
mer U.S.S. Buchanan, but that "the
pumping station and the dock oper
ating gear were destroyed and other
demolition work was carried out ac
cording to plan."
"The raid caused panic among the
enemy, who fired indiscriminately
at friend and foe," the communique
said. "The enemy's six-inch guns
sank one of their own anti-aircraft
ships at the time she was engaging
our returning forces."
