PORT MORESBY. Papua, March
2!) (UP). â€”The Japanese drive for
| New Guinea is stalled 83 days after
! it began with the bombing of Rabaul,
New Britain island outpost, on Jan. 4.
There have been no reports of en-
I emy advances on New Guinea island
for several days and the only gains
| they ever made from the landing
points of Salamaua and Lae pene
trated but a few miles into the
Markham Valley north of here. The
! invasion so far has been a unique
; battle of hide and seek, waged at the
i southern end of the long Japanese

j supply line from home bases.
(The Vichy radio, heard in Lon
don, asserted that the Japanese had
( carried out operations to encircle
! Port Moresby and were about 44
: miles "south of the town," prcsum
j ably meaning to the southeast.)
BATTLE I OR AIR COMMAND
It is a battle at present for com
mand of the air. and its result will
decide when and where the main
land forces will clash and probably
decide who will win.
To assume that the enemy has
come to the end of his road in this
area would be folly. Ho could still
concentrate an enormous force for
; one last heavy hammer blow to
j crush the only outlying base for de
fense of Australia.
The only major Japanese gain in
' the New Guinea sector was the con
| quest of Rabaul, main city of New
Britain island, on Jan. 23.
THREE OBSTACLES
The Japs have been .stalemated
because for the first time in the
: Pacific war they have encountered
three serious obstacles:
1. Air power equal to or bettor
than their own and capable of con
! stant and increasing reinforcement.
2. Widely dispersed defense air
bases equal to or better than those
they have been able to grab.
3. Transformation of the spirit of
the United Nations from defensive
! psychology to determination to carry
I out a counter-offensive.
