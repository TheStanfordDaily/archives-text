# Farm's Income Rises but Loss Forecast in '42
## Numerous Projects Completed; Plans For Future Outlined 
### 
Stanford's income during tho 1940- I
41 fiscal year was' $56,979 greater I
than its expenses, according to the !
report recently published by Finan
cial Vice-President Frank F. Walker.
Although the budget at the first of
the year forecast a deficit of $101,-
321.99, profitable operations result
ing from improvement in earnings
from (he endowment, the hospital
and auxiliary activities, and other
savings in operating budgets aided
in lowering the deficit, Mr. Walker
said.
The report forecast, however, that ]
the continued rising tendency of
costs of operation, the prospective
potential damage to earning power
and the loss of tuition income from
reduced registration will increase
problems of operations "in the fu
ture."
Projects which have been com
peted that have required numerous
funds are the Hoover War Library;
resurfacing, broadening, and recon
struction of several streets; starting
t e construction of a new maternity
ward at Stanford Hospital; remodel- '
mg of the political science depart- j
ment; alteration of Casa Ventura,
women's dormitory, and the Corpo- ;
lation Yard store, and reconstruc- :
n of campus domestic water res- :
ervoir.
The gross income of the Stanford!
Union and the Board of Athletic
I Control showed profits over the ex
| penditures made. Major expendi
: tures were $97,785.32 for intercolle
jgiate sports; $24,000 for the School
c'-n Jo.fc nt> and Physical Education;
for maintenance of build
ings and grounds; $21,815.37 for di
r expense, and
$80,355 for staff salaries.
