ford's varsity cagers return from
Kansas City tomorrow at 11 a.m. at
the Palo Alto station. Coach Everett
I>ean is visiting his family in In
diana and will arrive later in the
week.
The Redskins wound up their
whirlwindingcst season since the
Luisetti era with a smashing 53-38
rout over Dartmouth Saturday night
to bring the N.C.A.A. championship
bacon to the Farm for (he first time
since the tournament was initiated
four years ago.
Eveiy Indian was a sensation as
Stanford swept through the quar
ter- and semi-finals with victories
over Rice and Colorado, 53-47 and
46-35.
POLLARD HIGH SCORER
Jimmy Pollard came as close to
proving he may some day be called
(he new "Hank" when he tanked an
amazing 26 points against the Owls.
Stanford's lanky soph wow came
back the following night and poured
in 17 more to help the Indian smother
Colorado.
Then the Dcanmen waited around
in Kansas City for a week and met
the Green Indians from Dartmouth
in the final playoff. Held to a 24-22
point lead at halftime and playing
without Pollard, who suffered from a
bad sinus infection, Stanford came
out of the clouds in the final 10 min
utes to cop the title. Howie Dallmar
with 15, Jack Dana with 14, and Ed
Voss with 13 headlined the champs'
box score.
Stanford's co-captain Don Bur
ness, still suffering from a leg in
jury incurred weeks ago, did not
play in the first two games and only
a short time in the third.
DALLMAR GETS HONOR
Along with the tournament title
went individual honors to Pollard,
Cowden and Dallmar. Pollard and
Cowden were selected on the all
tournament team and Dallmar was
picked as the most valuable player
in the final N.C.A.A. game by the
National Coaches Association.
This is how the games went:
Stanford had to quell a terrific
last-half rally by Rice. Chet Palmer
and Lambert brought the Owls to
within 4 points of the cooling In
dians. Palmer knotted (he score at
37-all and a moment later Rice went
in front, 41-37.
Ed Voss and Pollard collaborated
to boom Stanford back into the lead.
Pollard, who collected 17 points in
the first half with one-hand push
shots, came to the rescue with two
quick ones, tying the count at 45-45.
With five minutes remaining, he tal
lied three more field goals which,
added to Voss' free throws, gave the
Indians victory.
BURNESS OUT
Stanford baffled Colorado the
next night with its combination zone
and man-for-man defense to win
46-35. Burness rode the bench when
the Redskins walloped Colorado.
With the double win shooting them
into the finals with Dartmouth, the
Indians were forced to wait a week
for the last game. It was the third
meeting of Stanford and Dartmouth
basketball teams. In 1938 Dartmouth
nosed out the Reds 48-47 in a ter
rific overtime contest in San Fran
cisco.
The next year, with sophomore
Bill Cowden playing guard, Stan
ford blasted Dartmouth, 55-29, in
Philadelphia.
In (he Saturday night title clincher
Stanford rolled into a 3-point-a
minutc skyrocket pace against Dart
mouth to turn a slow, tight game
into a 53-38 rout before 6,000 fans.
Poor passing in the early stages
nearly cost the Farm skyscrapers the


HOWIE DALLMAR was voted the most valuable player to his team in
Saturday night's N.C.A.A. final game in Kansas Ctiy, in which Stan
ford whipped Dartmouth for the national title.
