added to Voss' free throws, gave the
Indians victory.

next night with its combination zone
and man-for-man defense to win
46-35. Burness rode the bench when
the Redskins walloped Colorado.
With the double win shooting them
into the finals with Dartmouth, the
Indians were forced to wait a week
for the last game. It was the third

basketball teams. In 1938 Dartmouth
nosed out the Reds 48-47 in a ter
rific overtime contest in San Fran
cisco.
The next year, with sophomore
Bill Cowden playing guard, Stan

nose with Stanford, twice tying the
score and once pulling ahead, 27-2G,
on George Munroe's free throw.
That point was the last the boys
from Hanover got for the next live
minutes.
During that time, Dallmar tipped
in a one-bander and little Freddie

over Rice and Colorado, 53-47 and
46-35.
POLLARD HIGH SCORER
Jimmy Pollard came as close to
proving he may some day be called
(he new "Hank" when he tanked an
amazing 26 points against the Owls.
Stanford's lanky soph wow came
back the following night and poured
in 17 more to help the Indian smother
Colorado.
Then the Dcanmen waited around
in Kansas City for a week and met
the Green Indians from Dartmouth
in the final playoff. Held to a 24-22
point lead at halftime and playing
without Pollard, who suffered from a
bad sinus infection, Stanford came
out of the clouds in the final 10 min
utes to cop the title. Howie Dallmar
with 15, Jack Dana with 14, and Ed
Voss with 13 headlined the champs'
box score.
Stanford's co-captain Don Bur
ness, still suffering from a leg in
jury incurred weeks ago, did not
play in the first two games and only
a short time in the third.
DALLMAR GETS HONOR
Along with the tournament title
went individual honors to Pollard,
Cowden and Dallmar. Pollard and
Cowden were selected on the all
tournament team and Dallmar was
picked as the most valuable player
in the final N.C.A.A. game by the
National Coaches Association.
This is how the games went:
Stanford had to quell a terrific
last-half rally by Rice. Chet Palmer
and Lambert brought the Owls to
within 4 points of the cooling In
dians. Palmer knotted (he score at
37-all and a moment later Rice went
in front, 41-37.
Ed Voss and Pollard collaborated
to boom Stanford back into the lead.
Pollard, who collected 17 points in
the first half with one-hand push
shots, came to the rescue with two
quick ones, tying the count at 45-45.
With five minutes remaining, he tal
lied three more field goals which,
added to Voss' free throws, gave the
Indians victory.
BURNESS OUT
Stanford baffled Colorado the
next night with its combination zone
and man-for-man defense to win
46-35. Burness rode the bench when
the Redskins walloped Colorado.
With the double win shooting them
into the finals with Dartmouth, the
Indians were forced to wait a week
for the last game. It was the third
meeting of Stanford and Dartmouth
basketball teams. In 1938 Dartmouth
nosed out the Reds 48-47 in a ter
rific overtime contest in San Fran
cisco.

Bill Cowden playing guard, Stan

DALLMAR GETS HOT'
The Indians trailed 12-G once in
the first half but Dallmar was sud
denly all over the court with 11
points to tie it up just before half
time. Jack Dana took a long pass
and scored to give the Deanmen a
24-22 lead at the gun.
In the first five minutes of the final
period Dartmouth stayed nose and
nose with Stanford, twice tying the
score and once pulling ahead, 27-2G,
on George Munroe's free throw.
That point was the last the boys
from Hanover got for the next live
minutes.
During that time, Dallmar tipped
in a one-bander and little Freddie
Linari added another. Then Dall
mar, Dana, Voss, and Cowden each
rang the cords for 7 points and
Stanford popped into a !!7-:■!!) lead
and Dartmouth fell by the wayside.
