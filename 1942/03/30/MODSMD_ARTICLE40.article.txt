Memorial services are being planned for Dr. Percy Alvin Martin, a
member of tho Stanford history faculty since 1908, who died at Laguna
Beach March 8.
I)r. Martin was taken ill last summer but expected, after recuperating
during the winter months at the hcach resort, to resume his teaching in

April. Funeral services were held,
in Los Angeles and the burial took
place in Ro.sedale Cemetery on
March 10.
Dr. Martin received his A.B. from
Stanford in 1902, and his M.A. in
1903. He also attended Harvard Uni
versity, where he received both M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees. He was a student
at the Universities of Paris, Ber
lin, and Leipzig.
"Professor Martin was a distin
guished authority in the history of
Latin America and had been hon
ored by a dozen Latin American
countries. His particular specialty
was the history of Brazil, and on this
he was the outstanding authority
in the United States," says Profes
sor Edgar E. Robinson, executive
head of the History Department at
Stanford.
Last summer he was one of the
sixty specialists invited to attend
the Harris Institute on Latin Ameri
can Affairs at the University of
Chicago. He is best known for his
"Who's Who in Latin America,"
first published by the Stanford Press
in 1935 and revised in 1940.
