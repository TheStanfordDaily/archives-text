SALT LAKE CITY, Utah. March
29 (UP).â€”Japanese college students
evacuated from the Pacific Coast
will not be accepted at Utah State
Agricultural College at Logan.
In announcing the ruling today,
college trustees said that U.S.A.C. "is
crowded with a Naval training pro
gram, giving elementary and ad
vanced classes in radio technology
to a large number of naval trainees."
The school's defense work was thus
advanced as (lie reason for barring
Japanese students.
Japanese students are not invited
to attend the University of Utah in
Salt Lake City, President Leroy E.
Cowles said tonight. But he qualified
his statement, adding that "Ameri
can-bom Japanese students, who are
in good standing at the Universities
of California and Washington, will
be accepted as transfers if they can
pay full tuition and bring letters of
recommendation."
