# Lawson, Plus T, Begins April 6
## Spring Practice April 6; May Drop Frosh Team 
### DON SELBY 
With the resignation of T Formation Maestro Clark D. Shaughnessy and
the naming on Saturday, March 21, of James W. Lawson as new head
man of Stanford's l'octhall destinies, and with the decision of the Pacific
Coast Conference to retain in principle the freshman rule, the following
developments in Stanford's football program may be expected:

1. Stanford may have no freshman
football team next fall.
2. The varsity, under the direction
of Lawson, will operate from the T
formation.
3. Spring football practice will
definitely start on Monday, April 6.
and operate on a five-day-a-week
schedule for six weeks, rather than
starting today and running on a
three-day-a-week schedule; equip
ment will be issued to candidates all
this week.
4. Lawson will retain the "closed
practice" policy during spring and
fall seasons.
5. Lawson will work with fewer
experienced assistants than were af
forded Shaughnessy.
FOOTBALL IN WAR TIME
In short, Stanford's football pro
gram, like most everything else, will
be operating on a war-time basis
and will undergo such changes as
limited finances demand.
Jim Lawson was an Ail-American

end at Stanford in 1924, playing un
der Pop Warner. He graduated in
1925, played some professional foot
ball, and returned to Stanford as an
end coach under C. E. "Tiny" Thorn
hill in 1933. He was retained as end
coach when Shaughnessy took over
in 'he spring of 1940.
Although no definite decision has
been made as yet, Lawson stated
yesterday that he believed there
would be no regular frosh football
team as there has been in the past.
Instead, he predicted, the frosh will

work with the varsity, although they
will not be eligible to participate in
varsity competition.
"Even under normal conditions, I
favor abolishment of a regular fresh
man team which plays scheduled
games all season," said Lawson. "I
would like to have the frosh work
with the varsity and perhaps play a
couple of games with California on
a home - and - home arrangement.
Under the present conditions, I feel
certain that some such plan is in
evitable."
NO VARSITY FOR FROSH
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
could not be contacted yesterday
for comment on this possibility. Dr.
Wilbur has previously been quoted
as being in favor of having the fresh
men participata as varsity team
members and play in varsity com
petition. However, the Pacific Coast
Conference, in its meeting last week
in Portland, voted to keep freshmen
out of varsity competition until after
they have completed two semesters
or three quarters.
"I see a lot of headaches coming
up," Lawson said yesterday, "espe
cially since the staff will necessarily
be limited as to numbers."
Whereas Shaughnessy had Law
son as end coach, Phil Bengtson as
line coach, and Marchie Schwartz
as backfield coach, plus the services
of Husky Hunt, Coach Lawson will
operate with Schwartz and Harry
Shipkey, former freshman grid
mentor, as full-time football coaches.
Phil Bengtson has already left
Stanford for training at Annapolis
as a physical education instructor in
the Navy. Frank Albert, All-Ameri
can quarterback in 1940 and 1941,
and Vic Lindskog, first string center
on the Indian eleven for the same
years, have been named to act as
student assistants during spring
practice.
"Frankie and Vic will be able to
help me a great deal," said Lawson,
"but it's still going to be tough to
handle all the boys and still keep
things moving as rapidly as they
should, although I haven't any way
of telling just how many will turn
out for spring practice.
Under the Lawson regime, spring
practice will not be a "do-or-die"
proposition with all the players giv
ing their very "all" in a battle for
top team rankings.
He said: "I think the main idea
of spring practice is for the coaches
to get a line on the personnel, espe
cially the new men, and for the new
players to get thoroughly acquainted
with the system."
Lawson will keep the "T" forma
tion, not only because of the in
herent values of the system but also
because most of the players he will
work with next fall are pretty well
schooled in the intricacies of that
style of football.

Clark I). Shaughnessy, 1940's
miracle man of football who took
a couldn't-win-for-losing team of
lO.'iO through an undefeated season
and a Rose Bowl victory in 15)40,
is now in Southern California. He
is expected to return today or to
morrow and leave here Wednesday
or Thursday to take over his duties
as director of the department of
health and education and head
football coach at the University of
Maryland.
It is reported that his family will
remain in Palo Alto.

will not be eligible to participate in
varsity competition.
"Even under normal conditions, I
favor abolishment of a regular fresh
man team which plays scheduled
games all season," said Lawson. "I
would like to have the frosh work
with the varsity and perhaps play a
couple of games with California on
a home - and - home arrangement.
Under the present conditions, I feel
certain that some such plan is in
evitable."
NO VARSITY FOR FROSH
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
could not be contacted yesterday
for comment on this possibility. Dr.
Wilbur has previously been quoted
as being in favor of having the fresh
men participata as varsity team
members and play in varsity com
petition. However, the Pacific Coast
Conference, in its meeting last week
in Portland, voted to keep freshmen
out of varsity competition until after
they have completed two semesters
or three quarters.
"I see a lot of headaches coming
up," Lawson said yesterday, "espe
cially since the staff will necessarily
be limited as to numbers."
Whereas Shaughnessy had Law
son as end coach, Phil Bengtson as
line coach, and Marchie Schwartz
as backfield coach, plus the services
of Husky Hunt, Coach Lawson will
operate with Schwartz and Harry
Shipkey, former freshman grid
mentor, as full-time football coaches.
Phil Bengtson has already left
Stanford for training at Annapolis
as a physical education instructor in
the Navy. Frank Albert, All-Ameri
can quarterback in 1940 and 1941,
and Vic Lindskog, first string center
on the Indian eleven for the same
years, have been named to act as
student assistants during spring
practice.
"Frankie and Vic will be able to
help me a great deal," said Lawson,
"but it's still going to be tough to
handle all the boys and still keep
things moving as rapidly as they
should, although I haven't any way
of telling just how many will turn
out for spring practice.
Under the Lawson regime, spring
practice will not be a "do-or-die"
proposition with all the players giv
ing their very "all" in a battle for
top team rankings.
He said: "I think the main idea
of spring practice is for the coaches
to get a line on the personnel, espe
cially the new men, and for the new
players to get thoroughly acquainted
with the system."
Lawson will keep the "T" forma
tion, not only because of the in
herent values of the system but also
because most of the players he will
work with next fall are pretty well
schooled in the intricacies of that
style of football.

Clark I). Shaughnessy, 1940's
miracle man of football who took
a couldn't-win-for-losing team of
lO.'iO through an undefeated season
and a Rose Bowl victory in 15)40,
is now in Southern California. He
is expected to return today or to
morrow and leave here Wednesday
or Thursday to take over his duties
as director of the department of
health and education and head
football coach at the University of
Maryland.
It is reported that his family will
remain in Palo Alto.
With the resignation of T Formation Maestro Clark D. Shaughnessy and
the naming on Saturday, March 21, of James W. Lawson as new head
man of Stanford's l'octhall destinies, and with the decision of the Pacific
Coast Conference to retain in principle the freshman rule, the following
developments in Stanford's football program may be expected:

1. Stanford may have no freshman
football team next fall.
2. The varsity, under the direction
of Lawson, will operate from the T
formation.
3. Spring football practice will
definitely start on Monday, April 6.
and operate on a five-day-a-week
schedule for six weeks, rather than
starting today and running on a
three-day-a-week schedule; equip
ment will be issued to candidates all
this week.
4. Lawson will retain the "closed
practice" policy during spring and
fall seasons.
5. Lawson will work with fewer
experienced assistants than were af
forded Shaughnessy.
FOOTBALL IN WAR TIME
In short, Stanford's football pro
gram, like most everything else, will
be operating on a war-time basis
and will undergo such changes as
limited finances demand.
Jim Lawson was an Ail-American

end at Stanford in 1924, playing un
der Pop Warner. He graduated in
1925, played some professional foot
ball, and returned to Stanford as an
end coach under C. E. "Tiny" Thorn
hill in 1933. He was retained as end
coach when Shaughnessy took over
in 'he spring of 1940.
Although no definite decision has
been made as yet, Lawson stated
yesterday that he believed there
would be no regular frosh football
team as there has been in the past.

of telling just how many will turn
out for spring practice.
Under the Lawson regime, spring
practice will not be a "do-or-die"
proposition with all the players giv
ing their very "all" in a battle for
top team rankings.
He said: "I think the main idea
of spring practice is for the coaches
to get a line on the personnel, espe
cially the new men, and for the new
players to get thoroughly acquainted
with the system."
Lawson will keep the "T" forma
tion, not only because of the in
herent values of the system but also
because most of the players he will
work with next fall are pretty well
schooled in the intricacies of that
style of football.

Clark I). Shaughnessy, 1940's
miracle man of football who took
a couldn't-win-for-losing team of
lO.'iO through an undefeated season
and a Rose Bowl victory in 15)40,
is now in Southern California. He
is expected to return today or to
morrow and leave here Wednesday
or Thursday to take over his duties
as director of the department of
health and education and head
football coach at the University of
Maryland.
It is reported that his family will
remain in Palo Alto.
With the resignation of T Formation Maestro Clark D. Shaughnessy and
the naming on Saturday, March 21, of James W. Lawson as new head
man of Stanford's l'octhall destinies, and with the decision of the Pacific
Coast Conference to retain in principle the freshman rule, the following
developments in Stanford's football program may be expected:

1. Stanford may have no freshman
football team next fall.
2. The varsity, under the direction
of Lawson, will operate from the T
formation.
3. Spring football practice will
definitely start on Monday, April 6.
and operate on a five-day-a-week
schedule for six weeks, rather than
starting today and running on a
three-day-a-week schedule; equip
ment will be issued to candidates all
this week.
4. Lawson will retain the "closed
practice" policy during spring and
fall seasons.
5. Lawson will work with fewer
experienced assistants than were af
forded Shaughnessy.
FOOTBALL IN WAR TIME
In short, Stanford's football pro
gram, like most everything else, will
be operating on a war-time basis
and will undergo such changes as
limited finances demand.
Jim Lawson was an Ail-American

end at Stanford in 1924, playing un
der Pop Warner. He graduated in
1925, played some professional foot
ball, and returned to Stanford as an
end coach under C. E. "Tiny" Thorn
hill in 1933. He was retained as end
coach when Shaughnessy took over
in 'he spring of 1940.
Although no definite decision has
been made as yet, Lawson stated
yesterday that he believed there
would be no regular frosh football
team as there has been in the past.
Instead, he predicted, the frosh will

work with the varsity, although they
will not be eligible to participate in
varsity competition.
"Even under normal conditions, I
favor abolishment of a regular fresh
man team which plays scheduled
games all season," said Lawson. "I
would like to have the frosh work
with the varsity and perhaps play a
couple of games with California on
a home - and - home arrangement.
Under the present conditions, I feel
certain that some such plan is in
evitable."
NO VARSITY FOR FROSH
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
could not be contacted yesterday
for comment on this possibility. Dr.
Wilbur has previously been quoted
as being in favor of having the fresh
men participata as varsity team
members and play in varsity com
petition. However, the Pacific Coast
Conference, in its meeting last week
in Portland, voted to keep freshmen
out of varsity competition until after
they have completed two semesters
or three quarters.
"I see a lot of headaches coming
up," Lawson said yesterday, "espe
cially since the staff will necessarily
be limited as to numbers."
Whereas Shaughnessy had Law
son as end coach, Phil Bengtson as
line coach, and Marchie Schwartz
as backfield coach, plus the services
of Husky Hunt, Coach Lawson will
operate with Schwartz and Harry
Shipkey, former freshman grid
mentor, as full-time football coaches.
Phil Bengtson has already left
Stanford for training at Annapolis
as a physical education instructor in
the Navy. Frank Albert, All-Ameri
can quarterback in 1940 and 1941,
and Vic Lindskog, first string center
on the Indian eleven for the same
years, have been named to act as
student assistants during spring
practice.
"Frankie and Vic will be able to
help me a great deal," said Lawson,
"but it's still going to be tough to
handle all the boys and still keep
things moving as rapidly as they
should, although I haven't any way
of telling just how many will turn
out for spring practice.
