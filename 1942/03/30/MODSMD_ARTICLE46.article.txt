# Pirates Look Like Top-notch Contender after Dodger Deal
## 
### 
NEW YORK, March 29 (UP). —The four-man deal Manager Frankie
Frisch engineered with the Brooklyn Dodgers last December turned out
to be one of the best trades in Pittsburgh history and the Pirates today
shape up impressively enough to better their fourth-place finish of the
last three years. .

When spring training began, Pitts
burgh had three definite problems—
third base, shortstop and right field
—and the acquisition of Pete Cos
carat. Jimmy Wasdell, Luke Hamlin
and Babe Phelps from the Dodgers
in exchange for shortstop Arky
Vaughan has presented Frisch with
a solution at two spots.
Coscarat's fielding has turned out
to be sure-fire. He hounds the ball
in the manner of nimble-footed
Tommy Thevenow, fits well into the
shortstop berth and at the moment
leads the club in batting with an
average well over .300.
WASDELL IN FIEIJ3
Wlasdell has already won his spot
in right field. He is fleet, generally
hits around .300 and has a good arm.
His only apparent weakness is on
ground ball and Frisch has been
grooming him daily to correct that.
His only rival is Rookie Johnny Bar
rett, another left-hander who can
hit well and do fast time on the
bases.
Hamlin will take his regular turn
on the mound at the worst, every
five days, while Phelps will serve as
No. 1 pinch hitter and relief for Al
Lopez. Since Lopez gets hurt often,
Phelps will see lots of action.
ELLIOTT CONVERTED
The other problem—third base—
was solved by the conversion of
outfielder Bob Elliott, who seems to
fill the bill. He has a large pair of
hands, is fast and gets the ball away
well. Lee Handley, regular third
sacker, came up with a lame shoul
der this spring as a result of an auto
accident and although coming around
he has not played yet.
The pitching looks top-notch. Vet
erans who will do the bulk of the
work are Rip Sewell, Max Butcher,
Johnny Lanning, Ken Heintzelman
and Lloyd Dietz. Dietz came along
fast near the end of last season and
Frisch likes his chances. Aldon
Wilkie, another sophomore, also looks
good. Bob Klinger will be the relief
