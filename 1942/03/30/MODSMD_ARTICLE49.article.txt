there is never any way for all of the national grid leaders to :
meet in a playoff, anyone's football ratings can stand up without dis
proof, but in the field oi basketball these self-endorsed rankings can be
blown ski-high by (he end-season N.C.A.A. tourneys.
For example, those oafs who in 1!)40 picked Minnesota as the national
football champions over the Stanfords could never be shown in their
true light, since no meeting of these two giants could ever be arranged.
However, men such as Dick Dunkel are now eating their words for 1
putting the Highboys in 29th place nationally while the Boulder Buffs of
Colorado were esconsed on top. Not only Colorado, but Dartmouth, Rice. '
Kansas, Illinois, and Kentucky of the first ten were knocked off in the
National Collegiate play during the last two weeks. Only the Cards—29th
best —came out undefeated.
The final and championship game was played with three regulars and
two reserves. Even with their co-captain and all-American forward Don
Burness out of the play, never were the Indians really in danger of losing. I

TOURING their ten-day stay in K.C., the hoop boys really threw the
honors around. Alter Burness got his all-American position, Jim
Pollard and Bill Cowden made the Western playoff all-star team. Then
in the finals, with Pollard stepping out of the picture, Howie Dallmar
copped the duke as high-scorer and outstanding man on the court. During
the entire series, however, it was another man, Ed Voss, who was the con
sistent high-scorer. Fifteen, ten, and thirteen counters were pushed in
by Big Eddie.

r JPHE horsehiders ran into a little hard luck down South last week. It has
been rumored that saboteurs got to the Farm boys' food at the Knick
erbocker. That could well explain their performance the afternoon I saw
them out on Bovard Field. (Calling that field is a slight misstatement. It
should be Bovard's Three Ring Circus.)
II you were out in right field coming in under a Texas leaguer, would
you be able to keep your mind on your work with spikes, cinders, and
tendons flying up in your face? The Trojans' practice track runs from
behind first base, out through center field, and down behind third, and
far be it from the eight straight national championship track team to knock
off for one day. 0
Cornelius McGillicuddy and Aloysius Simmonski were honored visitors
for the game and they really got an eyeful. They were scouting for the
Philadelphia Athletics of the American Professional Baseball League for
which they work. They are the manager and coach, respectively.
Actually Connie and the Milwaukee Duke came out to look over Bruno
Konopka, slugging Trojan first baseman. He obliged by hitting a home run
out of the bushes behind the pole vault pit. Luckily no one was "crossing
the bar" when the ball came out.
Don Pendergrass started out pitching good ball, but the fielding broke
down behind him so that a half-dozen runs were scored before he could
consistently get anyone out. Even in practice before the game the boys
had trouble handling the fungos knocked out by Coach Harry Wolter, who
was sporting a neat new suit. It wasn't, however, "zoot."
When we finally did push over a few runs, the game was too far gone
to make it interesting. A score of 2 610 3 is hardly respectable.

Class Private Jae Barrows had another "lucky night" last. week.
Simple Simon wasn't quite so lucky. Some day arthritis is going to
set in so bad that Louis won't be able to raise his arms above his waist.
I'd give 13 to 5 on oJe. He would still play a mighty rough game of savat.
. . . I'm almost tempted to ask Leland for the mustard again. That sand
wich has come for sure, but after all, there's nothing like a nice sail down
the Chesapeake In my best Winchellese, I hear that there may be a
gap to fill in the tennis team this spring. No. 3 to be more specific. . . .
But with S.C.'s two promising sophomores working the graveyard shift
at Lockheed—or is it the Mac Arthur shift—we still have nothing to worry
about in the net sport.

freshman who in the coming years can figure when he, the fresh
man, is eligible to compete on a Stanford team will be in line for
his Ph.D. When the P.C.C. moguls get together things really begin to fly.
The big question is what'll happen when Atherton begins to get blowouts?

T>UT into practice at U.S.C. last week is a defense athletic program in
which every male student is required to give up social dancing and
horseback riding for fence climbing and jiu-jitsu.
For an hour every Friday the attention of the school is turned to mak
ing every man a Superman. I would say that this is a direct challenge
to our school officials to see if they can make all Farm males worthy of
an entire Japanese regiment.
