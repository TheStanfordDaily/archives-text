# .000 FOR CARDS IN FOUR Cards Complete Triple Play
## 
### 
Ilard-hit by graduation and enlistments, Harry Woltcr's humbling
baseball youths dropped four straight during their southern (our, hut the
Indian infield came up with the once-in-a-lifetime thrill—a triple play.
The three-way killing came in during the first U.C.L.A. tilt. With
the liases loaded iti the seventh inning, Bruin Dewanc Burgess hit a

grounder to third baseman Tel Nell,
who threw to Ray Hammett, fore- ,
ing Dewey Cruise at the plate. Ham- j
mett fired back to Nell, forcing Niek j
Angeles at third, and Nell whipped
!he ball down to Harry Parsons at
second to nail Lynn Compton and j
complete the triple play.
As il happened the Westwooders ;
weren't even bothered by losing a j
big scoring chance and they won, ■
12-9.
The second time Stanford met |
the Bruins Marv Harms was doing 1
o.k. on the mound, and the Bruins
trailed, 10-7. in the last half of the ;
eighth inning. Two-run homers
by Les Browning and Kirk Sin- I
clair, and a triple by Compton
produced five runs in that frame
and despaired all chances of the
Redskins winning a game.
The big tie-up all started at
Bovard field in the first game when j
Southern California palstered an 11-1 j
licking on the Red nine. Ed Vitalich !
=hange-of-paced the Trojans to a !
six-hit triumph and hit a triple and
two singles, driving in two runs for
his mates.
SNYDER HITS
Dale Snyder, Stanford chucker, '
got to Vitalich for a brace of singles !
while the rest of the Indian line-up i
was fairly ineffective at the plate;
eight strikeouts were recorded for
the lanky Vit;ilich. The other four
•tits came ofi the bats of Hammett, '
Parsons, and Clark Kellenberger.
I hen came the terriblest deluge
that ever deluged on a diamond
when what started out as (he sec
ond S.C. game wound up as batting
practice with the Indian hurlcrs as
the "dealers."
The Trojans collected 24 hits, which
added to their 1 (J of the day before,
gave them a total of 40 in two days.
The sixth inning resembled an ant
hill five minutes before closing

►
time: 14 Trojans came to bat and
chased each other around the bases
for eight runs.
Hammett, loose jaw and all, kept
the Indians in the box score with
three bingles in three trips to the
plate, while Nell, Parsons, Harms,
and Ted Falasco were the other In
dian hitters.
THREE FOR HAMMETT
So that's the way it happened to
the Stanford hasehallers—ls regu
lars lost through graduation and a
bevy of enlistments forced VVolter
to field a young and for the most
part inexperienced team.
The Indians now reside in the
C.1.8.A. cellar, firmly entrenched
therein. C.1.8A. doings will re
sume Friday and Saturday when
Stanford and California tangle in
the first two encounters of their
regular four-game series. Friday's
game will be played on Sunken
Diamond, Saturday's at Edward's
Field in Berkeley.
