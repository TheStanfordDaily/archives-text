# Card Net men Begin Prep For Crucial S.C. Match
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity netmen returned to the Farm yesterday and will
start daily practice sessions for their coming duel with the champion Uni
vetsity of Southern California tennis team this Saturday. The Trojaifs
are the power of the conference at the present time and an Indian victory
will start them 011 a drive to the conference championship.
"flie Indians will go into the match ♦

with only one practice game but in
I hat match they showed tremendous
strength by trouncing the Berkeley
Club 9-1. The Indians swept all of
the singles matches and two of the
[ three doubles against the team that
| beat California 6-3 a week before.
ON TIIE BEAN TROY
The Trojans come to the Farm
, boasting of two wins and no losses,
j having beaten U.C.L.A. and Cali
| fornia 5-4. But the two wins weren't
impressive, and the Trojans don't
seem to be as strong as the cham
pionship teams of the past three
years.
Heading the Trojans this year will
be Ted Olewine, who was also
number one last year. Olewine was
j ranked 11 in the nation last year
: and is improving all the time. Be
hind Olewine will be Bill Reedy, a
j steady, smooth stroking star, who
I won two matches from the Cards
last year. But alter these (wo boys,
j the Trojans are weak. Don Sweet,
Henry Zertouche, Al Davenport, and
I a boy named Gates follow the two
top men, and they are far below
the standard of past U.S.C. singles
| men.
PROBABLE LINE-UP
The Indians will probably play in
the order that they used against the
j Berkeley Club. Ted Schroeder, the
| lop collegiate netman in the nation,
i will head the Indians. Emery Neale,
the junior who played number one
for the better part of last season, will
probably be number two, followed
by Larry Dee, Jimmy Wade, Chuck
Hopper. Tom Kruger, Chuck Hutch
j inson. Andy Roberts, Ben Olson, and
| Harper Ink in an as yet undeter
j mined order.
The team of Dee and Wade will
j give the Cards one of the toughest
college doubles teams in the coun-
I try, and they will be followed by
j Neale and Roberts and Schroeder and
! the transfer Paul Wilson. The In
! dians with such representation will
j have a very good chance of sweep
| ing all three of the doubles matches.

Stanford's varsity netmen returned to the Farm yesterday and will
start daily practice sessions for their coming duel with the champion Uni
vetsity of Southern California tennis team this Saturday. The Trojaifs
are the power of the conference at the present time and an Indian victory
will start them 011 a drive to the conference championship.
"flie Indians will go into the match ♦

with only one practice game but in
I hat match they showed tremendous
strength by trouncing the Berkeley
Club 9-1. The Indians swept all of
the singles matches and two of the
[ three doubles against the team that
| beat California 6-3 a week before.
ON TIIE BEAN TROY
The Trojans come to the Farm
, boasting of two wins and no losses,
j having beaten U.C.L.A. and Cali
| fornia 5-4. But the two wins weren't
impressive, and the Trojans don't
seem to be as strong as the cham
pionship teams of the past three
years.
Heading the Trojans this year will
be Ted Olewine, who was also
number one last year. Olewine was
j ranked 11 in the nation last year
: and is improving all the time. Be
hind Olewine will be Bill Reedy, a
j steady, smooth stroking star, who
I won two matches from the Cards
last year. But alter these (wo boys,
j the Trojans are weak. Don Sweet,
Henry Zertouche, Al Davenport, and
I a boy named Gates follow the two
top men, and they are far below
the standard of past U.S.C. singles
| men.
PROBABLE LINE-UP
The Indians will probably play in
the order that they used against the
j Berkeley Club. Ted Schroeder, the
| lop collegiate netman in the nation,
i will head the Indians. Emery Neale,
the junior who played number one
for the better part of last season, will
probably be number two, followed
by Larry Dee, Jimmy Wade, Chuck
Hopper. Tom Kruger, Chuck Hutch
j inson. Andy Roberts, Ben Olson, and
| Harper Ink in an as yet undeter
j mined order.
The team of Dee and Wade will
j give the Cards one of the toughest
college doubles teams in the coun-
I try, and they will be followed by
j Neale and Roberts and Schroeder and
! the transfer Paul Wilson. The In
! dians with such representation will
j have a very good chance of sweep
| ing all three of the doubles matches.
