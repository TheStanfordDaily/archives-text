# O.P.A. Expert to Talk Here On War and the Consumer
## 
### 
Stanford's Consumer Education
program will be launched Wednes
day at 4:15 in the Education Build
ing with a lecture, "War and the
Consumer," by Dr. Maybelle Blake,
field secretary of the Office of Price
Administration.
Dr. Blake, contactcd by the Uni
versity at the end of Winter Quar
ter, is touring the country discussing
the war with faculty and students
in relation to the consumer and
what he can do to help.
"All students," said Dean Mary
Yost, "who are interested in helping
and in being helped in this difficult
situation are urged to attend the
lecture."
The lecture is in connection with

the Stanford War Activities Co-ordi
nation program, whose aim is to
bring the war into closer relation to
student life through a readjustment
of the standard of living as con
cerned by food, clothes, and enter
tainment.
Toward this end, the Speakers'
Bureau and the faculty will co-oper
ate. The faculty will present infor
mation in a scries of talks, includ
ing (1) How to adjust civilian living
to military needs; (2) Education of
the consumer as to wise use of nat
ural resources; (3) Distribution of
supplies; and (4) War against waste.
The co-ordination program, as yet
without an official head, is expected
to develop into full-scale operation
early this quarter.
