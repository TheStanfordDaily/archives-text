# The 						Why of Shaughnessy
## 
### 
WHY did Clark Shaughnessy leave Stanford?
This question has probably been the
main subject of Stanford talk during vacation
and has found opinion and judgment divided in
two.
One side seems to feel he sold us out for a
"tank town" college which schedules other
schools obscure in the football world, and that
it was a selfish move for security.
The other camp accepts his public statement,
that the Coast football outlook is dark, as justi
fication for his leaving, if he can be assured of
a steady job coaching football elsewhere, which
he is.
There is one thing certain in the Shaughnessy
move, and that is that Clark Shaughnessy loves
and lives football. No one has ever doubted
this. Therefore it is our contention that Shaugh
nessy is not to be condemned, for he is sincere
and, "As a man thinketh, so is he."
No welcome is necessary for Stanford's new
head man, affable Jim Lawson, for he is a fa
miliar Stanford man who has coached on the
Farm since 1933.
Best of luck, Mr. Shaughnessy and Jim, from
Stanford.
