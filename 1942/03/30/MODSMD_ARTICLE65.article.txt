SHORTLY before the conclusion of last quar
ter, Interfraternity Council acted on two
problems vitally important to the wartime sur
vival of Stanford fraternities and important to
the solution of the local student body election
problem.
Realizing financial difficulties may find some
houses with one foot in the grave and the other
on a banana peel, the council is allowing all
pledged men on scholastic probation to move
into their houses. This makes possible a fuller
house with more paying members.
The other move made by the Council will
eliminate the ancient evil of waiting until after
the spring student body elections to elect the
Interfraternity president. The old practice was
to wait for the Row pre-election caucus to slate
its candidate for president of the student body,
and also its choice for the Interfraternity presi
dency. Usually the second most popular man
was handed the Interfraternity job as consola
tion prize.
Interfraternity officers will from now on be
elected by the retiring Interfraternity Council
before the spring caucus and election, instead
of afterwards. This action does two things. It
takes a healthy swipe at the caucus system,
eliminating the "dealing" of political bosses, and
it goes a good ways in guaranteeing Interfra
ternity will elect a president more vitally inter
ested in enforcing council rules, than many dis
interested political orphans have been in the
past.
Congratulations are in order, even at this
late date, to the members of the Stanford
Band and the yell leaders who turned out to
fire up the spirit at the Oregon basketball
playoffs. Those who attended the near-sell
out series found that there was still a little
flame and fire in the old Stanford Red.
