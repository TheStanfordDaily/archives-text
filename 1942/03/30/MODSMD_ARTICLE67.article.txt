IN INDIA Sir Stafford Cripps, the British liberal and
envoy of the British Cabinet to India, has finally
come out with a definitive statement on Britain's posi
tion concemig Indian self-government. Cripps, speak
ing for the British government, has promised India
full dominion status with the successful conclusion of
the war, with the conditions that any province which
wishes to retain its present status may do so or may
form a separate union with one or more other prov
inces, and that a treaty must be concluded with the
Indain constitutional assembly which would form the
Indian constitution providing for the protection of
India's racial and religious minorities.

ALL of this sounds pretty good. The only trouble is
that it probably should have come about twenty
years ago and should have been offered by the British
under circumstances not quite so extenuating as those
with which they are now faced. The past, however,
is just so much filthy water over the dam today.
America realized that about last December 7. The
question now is whether India will recognize the same
fact, for the Indians have a deep and abiding grudge
(to put it mildly) against their British rulers, and,
though the British offer of dominion status may be
in good faith, the Indians may not be too overjoyed
at the strong political taint of the British pledge.
Pandit Nehru, leader of India's Hindu population
(three-quarters of the nation's total population) seems
ot be favorable to the British proposition, however, a
position which may be due in part purely to Sir Staf
ford's own personal friendship with Nehru. The shadow
in the Indian woodpile at this point seems to be the
nation's powerful Moslem minority. The Moslems
probably would not be too happy about a iHndu
dominated Indian oCngress (to be selected on the
basis of proportional representation) and may yet
break up the Anglo-Indian negotiations.
Whole-heated Idian entrance into the war on the
side of the United Nations would throw the last re
maining major people of the world which is not yet
mobilized for total war into the balance of nations
at an especially crucial and psychologically important
moment. It would open a vast reservoir of man-power
to tHe United Nations and would very possibly frus
trate the Jap-Nazi design of pincering in upon a de
fenseless and slothful India from both sides.
India and Britain are both playing realpolitik. And
this, for India right now, is a particularly good idea.
The Japs, you see, have already hammered through
most of Burma. India is just across the line.
