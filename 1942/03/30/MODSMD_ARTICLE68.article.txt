# BULL SESSION
## 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
I TPHE first Bull Session of Spring Quarter is usually
j a rather stereotyped affair. (It's not the only one.
—Ed.) You know the line: Sunshine and spring, boat
house and bathing suits. I can't follow this precedent
for I am not yet back on the Farm. A friend sent me
[ a ticket so I flew home for vacation. I'm still home.
This is my first time home by air. Phi P.si Harry E.
j Morgan was aboard on his way home to Portland.
| After the stewardess, a very attractive creature, told
him for the third time that she wasn't tired and didn't
want to come and sit down he came over to where I
was sitting and discussed points of interest with me.
To appear like a seasoned air traveler I bought a
I paper before leaving. I was reading it when it got
I quite rough over Oakland and after a while the stew
| ardess pointed out that I could probably read much
j better if I turned the paper the right way up. I
| thought the plane was upside down.
| In Seattle I went in to the Immigration service to
I check if my papers would be all right for re-entry to
! the U.S. Yes they would be all right but how did I
expect to leave the U.S.? I had overlooked getting
| a release from the Palo Alto Draft Board. I was about
I to murmur "you can't do this to me, I'll call the Brit-
I ish consul," when a technicality was discovered and
I I was permitted to continue my journey into Canada.

IJECIDING at last to give in to the wartime request
for physical fitness I hastened down to the Van
couver "Y" shortly after I arrived home and asked if
they could make me healthy during the vacation. The
fellow looked at me and then said that I had better
inquire at the church next door. "They are better
equipped for performing miracles than we are," he
said.
I checked my status with the Canadian draft
board and found that I am still Category "E." There
is only one group lower than this. However, they are
given a post mortem instead of a physical.
I asked if there wasn't something I could join.
"We're not losing that badly." was the callous reply
of the recruiting officer.
