Well, you and everyone connected with Stanford
can certainly be proud of the basketball team that
so capably represented the West Coast here in the
Division semi-finals just finished. Athletically, the boys
performed, without question, in 100 per cent manner.
The results testify to that; and those who were fortu
nate enough to witness these contests were definitely
convinced of the standout abilities of the individual
performers and the team. They played a beautiful
game, and everyone here knows it, especially their
worthy opponents.
Individually, the boys are splendid representatives
of the Stanford undergraduate body, and have carried
themselves in a fashion that adds prestige to the Uni
versity's fine record. The whole party is receiving
complimentary remarks from all sources.
We have tried to do a good job of extending our
southern hospitality to the team, its coach, and doctor,
and I believe they are going to leave here with a
good impression of Kansas City and its Alumni Asso
ciation.
Burness' ankle is responding to treatment, and it is
hoped that he will be in condition to participate in
the defeat of Dartmouth on Saturday. March 28.
Will you extend my sincerest congratulations to the
President and to the Dean of Men and to the student
body of the University in behalf of the Kansas City,
Missouri, Alumni Association? We have never had
occasion to be more fittingly proud of the University
and its product.

IJ EAR "BONES":
Well, you and everyone connected with Stanford
can certainly be proud of the basketball team that
so capably represented the West Coast here in the
Division semi-finals just finished. Athletically, the boys
performed, without question, in 100 per cent manner.
The results testify to that; and those who were fortu
nate enough to witness these contests were definitely
convinced of the standout abilities of the individual
performers and the team. They played a beautiful
game, and everyone here knows it, especially their
worthy opponents.
Individually, the boys are splendid representatives
of the Stanford undergraduate body, and have carried
themselves in a fashion that adds prestige to the Uni
versity's fine record. The whole party is receiving
complimentary remarks from all sources.
We have tried to do a good job of extending our
southern hospitality to the team, its coach, and doctor,
and I believe they are going to leave here with a
good impression of Kansas City and its Alumni Asso
ciation.
Burness' ankle is responding to treatment, and it is
hoped that he will be in condition to participate in
the defeat of Dartmouth on Saturday. March 28.
Will you extend my sincerest congratulations to the
President and to the Dean of Men and to the student
body of the University in behalf of the Kansas City,
Missouri, Alumni Association? We have never had
occasion to be more fittingly proud of the University
and its product.
Sinecerly yours,
Bob McDonnell
