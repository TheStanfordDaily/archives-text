# Rubenstein and Jose Iturbi Climax Symphony Season
## 
### 
Featuring two of the great pianists
of our time, and playing Lo sold-out
houses, the past two concerts of the
San Francisco Symphony brought
the current season to a climax.
The flashy Artur Rubinstein, who
puts his heart and soul into the mu
sic even when he is not playing, was
soloist in the Brahms second piano
concerto. And not a solitary phrase
of that solid-built work escaped the
virtuoso's almost incredible tech
nical and musical mastery.
Two untimely squeaks marred the
Coriolan Overture, but the orches
tra more than compensated in the
Moussorgsky "Pictures at an Exhi
bition," reproducing on full-scale
canvas its paradoxical humor and
grandeur.
Piston's lively "Incredible Flutist"
Suite, though bearing the stigma of a
contemporary composition, got good
when the circus came to town, and
received twice the applause of the
Beethoven on the program.

Jose Iturbi, a week ago, was solo
ist in the Tschaikowsky concerto.
Iturbi, in contrast to Rubinstein, flits
over the keys so effortlessly that if
he did not take out his handkerchief
lyou would never know he had
worked up a sweat. He played, how
ever, with a vitality he seldom dis
plays; but being primarily a classi
cist, his interpretation happily did
not resolve into a slugging match.
The venerable Mr. Monteux man
aged to keep the first fiddles shushed
in the right spots of the ProkofiefT
Classical Symphony to achieve con
trasts in the best Mozartean manner,
and otherwise to present a lilting,
singing, flawless performance of
probably the outstanding neo-classic
work.
And he did a noteworthy job of
draining the Tristan music of its last
drop of exquisiteness, without drip
ping.—Covey

The venerable Mr. Monteux man
aged to keep the first fiddles shushed
in the right spots of the ProkofiefT
Classical Symphony to achieve con
trasts in the best Mozartean manner,
and otherwise to present a lilting,
singing, flawless performance of
probably the outstanding neo-classic
work.
And he did a noteworthy job of
draining the Tristan music of its last
drop of exquisiteness, without drip
ping.—Covey
