I'or years, telephone cable lias been hung by stiff wire rings
from its supporting strand. But repealed expansion and con
traction caused by temperature changes sometimes proved
too much for even the best cable sheath. Fatigue cracks
d( ■veloped near the poles—this meant leaks —possible ser
vice interruptions—expensive repairs.
Recently, men of the Bell System developed a machine
that lashes the cable and strand together in such a way that
the concentration of strains near the poles is minimized.
r l lie C able Lasher has also proved a great aid in the speedy
installation of some of the new cables needed for airfields,
camps, bases and war factories.
There are many opportunities in the Bell System for men
with the urge — and the ability — to do a job belter than it
lias ever been done before.
