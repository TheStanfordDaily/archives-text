# Philippines Get 24-Hour Respite

WASHINGTON, March 30 (UP).
—Japan's land and air forces in the
Philippines, manhandled during the
week-end by the American-Filipino
defenders, kept at a respectable dis
tance today from Lieut. Jonathan M.
YVainwright's small but hard-hitting
units.
The War Department reported the
Japs suffered such heavy losses in
Saturday's futile thrust against
American-Filipino positions in Ba
taan Peninsula that they have not
attempted to attack in force within
the past 24 hours.
The same situation prevailed over
Corregidor fortress, the American
bastion at the entrance to Manila
Bay. Japanese, who last week used
as many as 154 bombers at a time in
raids upon the fort, found the anti
aircraft fire so accurate they re
duced the number of planes in the
attacking force. Sharp-shooting de
fenders brought down one bomber
from 27,000 feet—slightly better than
five miles high.
