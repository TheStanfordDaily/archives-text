## Support May Bring Acceptance of Plan Submitted by Cripps 
### 
LONDON, Tuesday, March 31 j
(UP). â€”The Daily Mail said today in j
a Bombay dispatch that Jawaharlal
! Nehru, leader of the All-India Con- j
j gress party, had thrown his support
j to the British proposals offering In- j
dia complete independence after the j
war.
The dispatch said Nehru had
aligned himself with Sir Stafford
; Cripps in the efforts to win Indian
i acceptance of the proposals. It re
j garded Nehru's stand as the probable
j key to Indian collaboration and ex
' pressed confidence that Cripps' mis-
I sion now would succeed.
"Nehru is concentrating his efforts
to swinging the Congress working
committee over to the scheme," the
Daily Mail said. "Five members are
siding with him. Seven still arc be
; lieved to be definitely opposed to
the scheme."
The dispatch said the opposition
wanted "power now rather than
power tomorrow" as well as control
of the defense of India.
A New Delhi dispatch to the Daily
Express said there was a 50-50
chance of the British plan being ac
| cepted by India. It said that Nehru
might join the war cabinet in Lon
; don as a representative of India if
j Cripps' mission succeeded.
