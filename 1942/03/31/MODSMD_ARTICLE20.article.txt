# Reg Day Shows New Ratio Dive To 1.799 Low
## 
### 
Stanford's famed ratio, which has
been nose-diving for the last year,
took another big drop yesterday
when the first tabulation of this
quarter's registration was received
from J. P. Mitchell, registrar. Last
quarter women were changing their
hair-dos, make-up, and clothing
styles when the 1.986 figure was an
nounced. Now, with the new num
ber even lower—l.799—nothing but
worry covers their faces.
Up to 5 p.m. yesterday 2190 men
and 1217 women had registered,
making a total of 3407. A year ago
this quarter, 2573 men and 1203
women had registered for a total of
3776. This makes a total decrease of
369 r 9.8 per cent. There were 383
less men registered and 15 more
women enrolled.
Last quarter 3748 students regis
tered, making a total of 341 less this
quarter. Last quarter's registration
was 7 per cent lower than fall quar
ter's.
Late registering today and the rest
of the week will pull the total up a
little for this quarter. Breakdowns
according to classes and departments
will not be available at least until the
end of this week.
