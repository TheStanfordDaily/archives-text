HOLLYWOOD, March 30 (UP).â€”
Lew Ayres, star of "All Quiet on the
Western Front," one of the most
powerful anti-war dramas Holly
wood ever made, packed up tonight
to leave for a conscientious objec
tors' camp at Cascade Locks, Ore.
War, he told his selective service
board, was as abhorrent to him in
real life as it was upon the screen
nearly 15 years ago. He told officials
of Selective Service Board 246 that
he could not conscientiously shoul
der arms for his country. They as
signed him to leave for the camp on
the Columbia River near Portland.
