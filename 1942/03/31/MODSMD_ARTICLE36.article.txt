# Over 300 Jig At Reg Dance
## 
### 
The Spring Reg Dance was a roar
ing success!
At 9:30 last night Jim Barnum,
head ticket taker and commissar of
the exchequer for this Cap and
Gown sponsored affair, reported that
150 tickets had been sold and that
numerous albums had been filled by
the defense stamps required for en
trance to the jig.
All profits from the dance will go
toward a new summer quarter schol
arship to be given by Cap and Gown.
Tickets were priced at $1.10 pet
couple. Students, however, had to
display defense stamps to gain ad
mittance. Some preferred to keep
the stamps for their own collection,
whereas others entered them in
books at the dance itself. The books
will go toward payment on the boat
house debt.
Bert Whiting's seven-piece orches
tra played for the dance.
