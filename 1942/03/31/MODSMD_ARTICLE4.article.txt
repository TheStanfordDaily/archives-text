## Forty-Inch Deluge Halts Guinea Attack For Four Months

GEN. Mat ARTHUR'S HEAD
QUARTERS IN AUSTRALIA, Tues
day, March 31 (UP). â€”Allied air su
periority, firmly established by the
return of Australian pilots from the
Libyan war, and a 40-inch deluge
in the Markham valley of New
Guinea have combined to throw the
Japs on the defensive over Austra
lia's northern approaches, it was re
vealed today.
Air Minister A. S. Drakeford said
American and Australian fliers have
crippled more than 10 per cent of
Japan's cruiser strength and have
knocked out 63 enemy planes in a
three weeks offensive which defi
nitely has established their supe
riority over northeastern Australian
outposts.
JAPS DRIVEN BACK
Port Moresby dispatches said the
Markham valley deluge had driven
the Japs back 27 miles to their
beachhead at Lae, cutting short their
drive through tropical jungles in the
direction of Port Moresby, which
could serve them as a springboard
for attacking Australia proper. Per
sons familiar with New Guinea said
the Japs began their drive too late,
as the wet season is beginning north
of the Owen Stanley mountain
range, separating Lae from Port
Moresby, and that the entire Mark
ham valley will be under several
feet of water for the next four
months.
It was believed that the Japs lost
a considerable amount of equipment
and stores when the deluge washed
them out.
ABANDON BASE
The area occupied by the Japa
nese already has become a huge
lake, it was reported, and they had
to abandon their advance base at
Nadzab entirely, along with their
plan to build air bases there.
"Without overstressing the im
portance of the Australian northern
front in terms of the war as a whole,"
Drakeford said, "it can definitely be
stated that the success achieved by
comparatively small forces can no
longer be regarded as merely of
tactical significance. They have
made a marked strategical difference
in the war."
