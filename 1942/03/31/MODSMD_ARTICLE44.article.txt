# Warmerdam at Farm Saturday
## Star Vaulter To Feature 'Club' Meet 
### 
By 11. I). TIIOREAU
Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam,
world record holder in the pole vault,
will return to the scene of his former
triumphs Saturday to lead the San
Francisco Olympic Cluh in its dual
meet wHh Stanford's varsity track
men.
Last year in this meet Warmer
dam broke (he existing record with
a vault of 15 feet 2 inches to mark
the third time he had cleared the
hitherto unapproached height of 15
feet. Since that time the former
Fresno State star, who attended
graduate school here, has busted
through the mytlylUal ceiling 17
times, y
This will he Warmerdam's first
outdoor appearance this year since
he established a new indoor uni
versal standard of 15-7 Va in Boston
last month. Saturday he will be
shooting for the 15-5% outdoor mark
he established at Compton last
spring.
OTHER O.C. STARS
However, Warmerdam is not the
only star included in Charley Hun
ter's National A.A.U. championship
team. Latest man to join the Winged
"O" forces is Dick Peter, premier
Cal miler last year.
Men of particular interest to Farm
track fans on the Club squad are
Bob Waters, Bill Corbett, .and pos
sibly Bill Joslyn. Waters and Jos
lyn were stars of last year's frosh
track team who were Athertonized
and thereby made ineligible to com
pete for Stanford although still at
tending school here. Waters will run
the 100 and 220 and Joslyn will
throw the discus.
POINT WINNER
Corbett is also attending school
here, but since he transferred in
from Princeton, a four-year college
somewhere in the East, he also is
not eligible this year. Corbett has
been a point winner in the high
jump and broad jump for the Tigers
for the past two years. He placed
in the 1.C.4-A. and Heptagonal meets
last season.
Although Hunter's team will not
reach its full strength until later
in the season, it should he strong
enough to edge out the Indians.
This is the first dual meet for both
teams.
Coach Pitch Johnson's squad,
strong in the jumps and hurdles, but
weak in the weights and flat races,
has been improving fast in practice
sessions and may give the Club more
trouble than they are expecting.
POLE VAULT COMPETITION
Russ Peck and Ed Tomasso will
provide Warmerdam with competi
tion up to 13-6, but from there on
the Flying Dutchman should have
no competition. Corbett will be bat
tling with the Card captain, Gene
Kern, who in winning the S.C. dual
meet last spring leaped 23 feet 9
inches.
The high jump will be a match
between Willard Smith, newest
find of the team, and Russ WulfT,
former Card star now in the O.C.
fold. Although WullT outjumps
Smith consistently when the two
practice together. Smith surprised
everyone, including himself, by
going (i-4'j in the Olympic Club's
indoor meet two weeks ago. This [
jump left WullT three inches lower.

Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam,
world record holder in the pole vault,
will return to the scene of his former
triumphs Saturday to lead the San
Francisco Olympic Cluh in its dual
meet wHh Stanford's varsity track
men.
Last year in this meet Warmer
dam broke (he existing record with
a vault of 15 feet 2 inches to mark
the third time he had cleared the
hitherto unapproached height of 15
feet. Since that time the former
Fresno State star, who attended
graduate school here, has busted
through the mytlylUal ceiling 17
times, y
This will he Warmerdam's first
outdoor appearance this year since
he established a new indoor uni
versal standard of 15-7 Va in Boston
last month. Saturday he will be
shooting for the 15-5% outdoor mark
he established at Compton last
spring.
OTHER O.C. STARS
However, Warmerdam is not the
only star included in Charley Hun
ter's National A.A.U. championship
team. Latest man to join the Winged
"O" forces is Dick Peter, premier
Cal miler last year.
Men of particular interest to Farm
track fans on the Club squad are
Bob Waters, Bill Corbett, .and pos
sibly Bill Joslyn. Waters and Jos
lyn were stars of last year's frosh
track team who were Athertonized
and thereby made ineligible to com
pete for Stanford although still at
tending school here. Waters will run
the 100 and 220 and Joslyn will
throw the discus.
POINT WINNER
Corbett is also attending school
here, but since he transferred in
from Princeton, a four-year college
somewhere in the East, he also is
not eligible this year. Corbett has
been a point winner in the high
jump and broad jump for the Tigers
for the past two years. He placed
in the 1.C.4-A. and Heptagonal meets
last season.
Although Hunter's team will not
reach its full strength until later
in the season, it should he strong
enough to edge out the Indians.
This is the first dual meet for both
teams.
Coach Pitch Johnson's squad,
strong in the jumps and hurdles, but
weak in the weights and flat races,
has been improving fast in practice
sessions and may give the Club more
trouble than they are expecting.
POLE VAULT COMPETITION
Russ Peck and Ed Tomasso will
provide Warmerdam with competi
tion up to 13-6, but from there on
the Flying Dutchman should have
no competition. Corbett will be bat
tling with the Card captain, Gene
Kern, who in winning the S.C. dual
meet last spring leaped 23 feet 9
inches.
The high jump will be a match
between Willard Smith, newest
find of the team, and Russ WulfT,
former Card star now in the O.C.
fold. Although WullT outjumps
Smith consistently when the two
practice together. Smith surprised
