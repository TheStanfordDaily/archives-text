# Strategic Island Cleared of Japs
## 
### 
SEATTLE, March 30 (UP). Japa
nese farmers and their families, with
long backward glances, departed
from strategic Bainbridge Island in
Puget Sound today in the Army's
first enforced evacuation of the war.
Sympathetic soldiers superintend
the exodus of 237 saddened island
ers with military precision. The
evacuees were brought by chartered
ferry to Seattle and transferred to a
special train for the trip to a recep
tion center at Manzanar, Cal.
Many of the Japanese were Amer
ican citizens, but all members of the
race were ordered to leave the island
which is the site of a naval radio
station and is on the main water
route to the Puget Sound Navy
Yard at Bremerton.
