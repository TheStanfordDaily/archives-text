# Farm Baseball Team to Battle Trojans, Bears
## 
### 
Back from the southern C.1.8.A.
diamond wars with little to show
save the distinction of having sty
mied U.C.L.A. in one inning with a
triple play, Stanford's varsity base
ball squad faces a week-end double
header loaded with base-hitting dy
namite â€” U.S.C. here Friday and
( alifornia at Berkeley Saturday.
The Trojans, if not too tired from
tuning the base paths against the
Indians, will be overwhelming favo
rites as will the Bears to push the
I' arm team farther into the loop
cellar.
Coach Rod Dedeau and his Troy
nine meet the Bears today at Berke
ley, both teams holding top spots in
the present standings.
Stanford mentor Harry Wolter
hasn't any appreciable nugget bro
mides to stop the headache he must
he having from the effects of that
four-game flogging the Indians took
during spring vacation.
Handicapped by the loss of more
veterans than you can count on
both hands and feet, the Redskins
have a young team, sparsely spot
ted with a couple of experienced
hall players. Ray Hammctt, con
verted to a catcher from his usual
first base position, is keeping what
little hitting there is as timely as
he can.
Don Pendergrass, last year's frosh
pitching satellite, holds down first
base when he isn't on the mound.
Don blasted Bruin Dave Sacks for
four hits in five times at bat in the
second U.C.L.A. tilt.
