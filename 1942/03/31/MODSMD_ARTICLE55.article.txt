<> N . E THING stood out in the closing weeks of the long basketball season.
Stanford's star was never the same man for more than a few days.
Just when everyone was convinced that Don Burness is the classiest
ball player in the league, along comes Jim Pollard with a style of play
that overshadows everything seen around here. Then in a couple of games
you would swear that Ed Voss was the difference between defeat and
victory for the Reds. The next thing you know, Bill Cowden is given
honorable mention on All-American and, finally, Howie Dallmar is given
the N.C.A.A. trophy for the most valuable player. Just who is Stanford's
star?
With a bunch of individual stars like these boys, you may wonder why
they play such a marvelous team game.
But it is not hard to understand if you appreciate the work of Coach
Everett Dean. Working ouietly behind football headlines last fall. Dean

developed the greatest defensive
system we've seen in a long time.
The best thing about the defense
was its elasticity. No sooner would
the opposition solve our zone than
a shifting man-to-man would throttle
them.
Dean had material, yes. But the
way we started out the season with
out a single dependable substitute
and finished the campaign with
three fine reserves shows that Dean
knows how to develop individual
players as well as mould a splendid
playing unit.
It is old stuff to hand out bouquets
to a coach upon conclusion of a
successful season; but we feel that
this is one case where the coach
really has a cheer coming.
Not only does Dean know the sci
ence of basketball inside and out—he
is a finq leader of men, and all his
boys have a high regard for him as
a coach and a gentleman.
Go out to a spring practice ses
sion and watch the Card hoop boss
lake on Woody Weir in a basket
shooting contest. He can't miss.

While we're still on the subject of basketball, there is a little story about
Frosty Cox that might interest you. It concerns the All-American A.A.U.
rookie, Bill Strannigan, who came out of Wyoming University to win a
place beside such men as Jack McCracken and Ace Greunig. Well, some
of the newsmen around the Rocky Mountain circuit asked Cox, the veteran
Colorado coach, to pick an all-conference team. Cox naturally included
his own boys, Pete McCloud and Baby Doll, but overlooked Strannigan
even for honorable mention.
It seems Strannigan served his freshman year at Colorado and then
transferred to his home state university, Wyoming. Cox used to sing his
praises but as soon as Strannigan left Colorado, Frosty cooled off.
Hardly fair to the boy, if you ask us; especially when Strannigan is be
yond a doubt the best product of college ball this year.
Phog Allen, of Kansas, who'll be remembered for saying "Football is
doomed," watched his team get beaten at Kansas City with Colorado, the
victors, using seven Kansas boys.
