# Farm Golfers To Face Uclans
## 
### THE LINKSMAN 
Led by Bud Brownell and Sandy
j Tatum, returning from last year's
N.C.A.A. championship team, the
| Stanford varsity golfers open their
1942 season here Friday afternoon in
a match with U.C.L.A. and follow it
; up Saturday with another encounter
j against U.S.C., also on the local links.
Although Gordie Hough. Warren
Berl, Bud Finger, and Dee Replogle
are gone from the team that set a
new record in winning the national
title at Columbus last summer,
Coach Eddie Twiggs hopes to fill in
| the gaps they left with three prom-
I ising ex-freshmen and a transfer
I student who was ineligible last
j season..
Foremost of these new prospects
is I'rank McCann, sophomore from
Piedmont who advanced to the
finals of the school tourney last
, year before being beaten by
Brownell. McCann has been plac
ing well up in bay area amateur
tournaments for the past three
i years.
| Following McCann will be George
i Traphagen and Jack Wilson, fellow
| members of last year's Papoose
team. Bob Barber, who transferred
! in from Washington last year and
| also drew fame by battling Brownell
in a local match, will complete the
I tentative team.

Don't discuss new military tech
niques or weapons.
