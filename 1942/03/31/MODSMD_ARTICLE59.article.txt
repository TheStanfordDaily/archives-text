GOOD weather, the key to spring fever, has
ensnared the old Farm before the first
class has even had a chance to start â€”conver-
tible tops are down, the Boathouse sports en
ticing feminine dewdrops and bronzed males.
. . . Stanford in the spring.
This is Stanford's traditional "take it easy"
quarter.
If you've made up your mind you are going
to slide along on the least number of units and
minimum amount of work necessary, there's
probably nothing we can say that will change
your plans.
We'd merely like to point out, however, that
basking in the sun is not a very convenient posi
tion in which to contribute to the war effort, or
from which to criticize the contributions of
others.
Our first obligation here at Stanford in the
spring this year is to learn more than ever be
fore, in whatever is our particular field. This
means studying harder, and good grades are
the best barometer of the quality of our work
and the quality of our thinking and the quality
of our adulthood ... or adolescence.
If individually we fail in this respect, we
have no damned business at Stanford in the
spring, and Uncle Sam will see to it this error
is not repeated. He needs nurses and sailors and
pilots and soldiers, just as badly as he needs
doctors and engineers and chemists.
If individually we fail in this respect and if as
a nation we fail, we will have no one to blame
but ourselves, each one of us personally. You
can't blame the other fellow, but you can help
him, by the example of personal conduct, be
fore it's too late.
