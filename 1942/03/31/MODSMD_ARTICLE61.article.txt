# Sports for War
## 
### 
OVER in London a few weeks ago Sir Staf
ford Cripps told the House of Commons
that the English government is going to clamp
down on war-time sports. After surveying their
sports program for the past two years, the Eng
lish have come to the conclusion that athletics
as a morale builder isn't worth a bag of beans.
In the United States Secretary of the Navy
Frank Knox told Congress that war-time sports
are going to be stressed in this country for two
reasons: (1) morale, (2) health.
Now who is to judge whether John Bull or
Uncle Sam has made the wiser decision? Of
course Mr. Bull has a two-year advantage in ex
perience over us, and he believes the "work or
fight" policy is the best.
But Mr. Sam doesn't want his men to sit back
and worry about the war. He wants everyone
to do his part, whether he is working, fighting,
or buying defense bonds and stamps. He also
wants his men to keep physically fit.
When a man finishes a long day's work or
finds himself with a spare hour or two after
drilling all day, he knows that some form of
athletics will provide a good, healthy means of
occupying his time.
Maybe the spectators should be discouraged
instead of the participants so that more people
can take part in the sports.
But we believe the American way of encour
aging war-time sports is the best.
On the local scene we find that by 9:45 yes
terday morning enrollment for women's tennis

was closed with a long line of hopeful students
waiting to register. This means that many
women who were interested in taking a certain
sport were not able to do so.
When our government has adopted its pres
ent program concerning sports, is it right that
many women should be kept from participating
in an activity of their choice? Women have a
very definite place in our war effort. They
should be allowed to choose their sports just as
the men even if it leads to overcrowding in some
fields. - John Horrall

Now who is to judge whether John Bull or
Uncle Sam has made the wiser decision? Of
course Mr. Bull has a two-year advantage in ex
perience over us, and he believes the "work or
fight" policy is the best.
But Mr. Sam doesn't want his men to sit back
and worry about the war. He wants everyone
to do his part, whether he is working, fighting,
or buying defense bonds and stamps. He also
wants his men to keep physically fit.
When a man finishes a long day's work or
finds himself with a spare hour or two after
drilling all day, he knows that some form of
athletics will provide a good, healthy means of
occupying his time.
Maybe the spectators should be discouraged
instead of the participants so that more people
can take part in the sports.
But we believe the American way of encour
aging war-time sports is the best.
On the local scene we find that by 9:45 yes
terday morning enrollment for women's tennis

was closed with a long line of hopeful students
waiting to register. This means that many
women who were interested in taking a certain
sport were not able to do so.
When our government has adopted its pres
ent program concerning sports, is it right that
many women should be kept from participating
in an activity of their choice? Women have a
very definite place in our war effort. They
should be allowed to choose their sports just as
the men even if it leads to overcrowding in some
fields. - John Horrall
OVER in London a few weeks ago Sir Staf
ford Cripps told the House of Commons
that the English government is going to clamp
down on war-time sports. After surveying their
sports program for the past two years, the Eng
lish have come to the conclusion that athletics
as a morale builder isn't worth a bag of beans.
In the United States Secretary of the Navy
Frank Knox told Congress that war-time sports
are going to be stressed in this country for two
reasons: (1) morale, (2) health.

Uncle Sam has made the wiser decision? Of
