wants to know how it is with Turkey
these days. Winston Churchill wants to know and
Adolf Hitler wants to know and Josef Stalin wants to
know and Franklin Roosevelt wants to know. I'd like
to know too. Turkey, are you for us or against us?
Let's try to look at the picture from all the angles.
Turkey, like all the other small nations in this world
of great nations, has just about come to the end of
her halcyon days of neutrality. For there are no
neutrals in this war, you see. You are either for Herr
Hitler and his New Order, or you are against him. And
if it happens that you are small and weak and Der
Fuehrer has a panzer division prodding you gently
in your ribs, the chances are you are for him and that
is all there is to it.
Turkey is in a strategic position—geographically
and politically— to make the Axis dreams of world
domination come true. If she decides to play with
the Allies, she is in an almost—but not quite—equally
strategic position to turn them into nightmares. In
other words, as all the commentators and experts point
out, Turkey is the "keystone of the Middle East." And
at this moment, that spot means a lot more than dom
ination of the Middle East alone. With Japan reach
ing out for India, the Axis hopes to use Turkey as an
arterial highway to a giant unbroken pincer with
Germany on one side, Japan on the other.

WHAT has Turkey to gain and to lose by collabora
tion with Hitler or alliance with the United Na
tions? The answer seems to be that she stands a pretty
good chance of being ruined ultimately either way
you look at it, and this, unfortunately, is the fate of
so many of the small nations today. If Turkey re
fuses to cosy up to the Nazis and joins openly with
the Allies, she will be ruthlessly trampled whenever
Herr Hitler decides she is in his way. And when this
happens the Allies will be able to offer her little help
in all probability. Russia will have her hands full
fighting the Germans on her own soil and will be in
no position to help the Turks. The British, while they
might possibly be able to spare some troops from Iran,
could never withdraw large enough forces from the
other fronts of their far-flung battle-line to make any
difference to the Nazi legions. And the U.S. is too far
away to help.
All right. So let us suppose Turkey decides to play
ball with the Axis. Like Vichyfrance and Finland she
will immediately lose the sympathy and respect of the
entire freedom-loving world, but that will not make
much difference to her right now perhaps because she
will be on the side that is winning. She will have se
curity, a dubious security to be sure, but security,
nevertheless.
But the great Allied offensive will come one of these
days and the Allies will be victorious and suddenly
Turkey will find herself on the wrong side, on the
side of the aggressor, and most unfortunate of all, on
the losing side.

T HE
British and the U.S. have attempted to lure the
queasy Turks into the Allied camp with bribes of
nice shiny new airplanes and tanks and guns and a
fat lease-lend contract'. The chances are, however, that
supplies haven't been great enough to make any size
able difference in the Turks' strength or any sizeable
impression on the Turks either. We have been the
arsenal of all the world's democracy for some time and
we have been doling out the guns to soldiers on all
the fronts at once.
The Axis, on the other hand, has tried a different
technique. It is the old method which Herr Hitler has
used and used successively and now swears by. It
means a powerful fifth column of "engineers" and
"tourists," a visit or two from wily Ambassador Fritz
von Papen, the psychological weapons of threat and
fear and disunity. The recent attempted assassination
of von Papen looked at first like a Nazi-manufactured
coup to walk in on the Turks, but the boys in Ankara
must have gotten their signals from Der Fuehrer
crossed, for apparently it was premature.
Recently King Boris of Bulgaria made a trip to
Germany to have a talk with the Mystic of Berchtes
gaden. Closer collaboration between the two nations
may result from the conferences, and if this is the
case, the Turks are faced with another problem if they
are contemplating Nazi friendship, and that is, the
reconciliation of their ancient hatred of the Bulgars.
Turkey will have to gamble either way: heads she
loses, tails she loses.
