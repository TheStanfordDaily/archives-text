# Mrs. Jordan Talks Of Farm Growth
## 
### BILL STEIF 
|V|RS. DAVID STARR JORDAN, wife of the late,
almost-legendary first President of Stanford
University is charmingly human. The petite, white
haired lady whom Dr. Jordan used to call "Miss
Jessie" (Jessie Knight was her maiden name), an
swered my questions with cordiality.
She spoke of how the increase in the number of
the students had gradually given rise to the integra
tion of Stanford's Departments into the several Schools
which Stanfordites of the present generation now find
on campus. And this, Mrs. Jordan went on to point
out, gives students today a much wider range in the
election of courses, an opportunity which formerly
was not present when students merely selected a major
professor and a major department and stuck within
those narrow limits.
We spoke of how the last war had affected Dr. Jor
dan and the Farm. "Before we got into the war," the
brilliant Doctor's wife related, "my husband was vig
orously and continuously against U.S. entry. He did
his level best to prevent it." But once we had be
come involved, Dr. Jordan's sole motto was "For
ward," a motto which it might be wise for many of
the ex-isolationist flutterhearts on the Farm to adopt.
There was one more query I had to make and that
was about the possibilities of permanent world peace.
I thought perhaps Mrs. Jordan, in the retrospect of
her several generations of experience might give me a
clue to the question's answer. She did, pointing out
lhat though it will be "a colossal task, a permanent
world peace is possible through the development of a
general and positive idealism." With an almost re
ligious tone to her voice, Mrs. Jordan spoke of the
necessity of abating national selfishness, of the need
for the further development of social justice and equal
ity of opportunity. "The world must at least be one
friendly family before it can rid itself of these ter
rible cataclysms," said "Miss Jessie."
