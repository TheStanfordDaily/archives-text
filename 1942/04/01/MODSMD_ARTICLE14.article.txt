NEW DELHI, March 31 (UP). —
Britain's effort to win the all - out
support of more than 300,000,000 In
dians for the United Nations' war
effort appeared on the verge of fail
ure last night despite the fact the
Japanese military threat to the great
sub-continent steadily was increas
ing.
The powerful all-India Congress
was to deliver a memorandum to Sir
Stafford Cripps, British War Cabinet
representative, today, rejecting the
British proposals in effect because
they failed to grant India immediate
and full independence including all-
Indian control over India's war
effort.
The British proposal is for domin
ion status after the war with Britain
to have control of India's war effort
until the war is ended.
There still was a chance that a
compromise might be reached, pos
sibly today or tomorrow, but the
outlook was not bright.
