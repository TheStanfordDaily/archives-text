# Brandt Scores Self-Deception In Series Talk
## Stanford Professor Stresses German Economic Stability 
### 
Wc cannot win this war with bold
face headlines and self-deception,
Dr. Karl Brandt, Stanford professor
in the Food Research Institute, said
last night, addressing the initial
Tuesday Evening Series of the
quarter in Memorial Hall.
Dr. Brandt stated that although
both Germany and Japan are eco
nomically stronger than they were
two years ago, and that you can not
starve them out, "all is not well with
them."
He pointed out that these weak
spots are too often put out of true
proportion to actuality by the Amer
ican people. As an example of this
he called to mind the often discussed
oil shortage of the Axis.
"On the natural gasoline that Ger
many produces in a year ten panzer
divisions could circle the world 20
times," he stated.
He said the greatest threat to the
United Nations is an oil crisis. We
have now changed from a "have" to
a "have-not" group of nations. An
example of the Axis strategy to ag
gravate this situation is shown by
the action of their submarines, which
is centered for the most part on
tankers, he continued.
"We must get the idea out of our
mind that a shortage breaks us
down, rather it stimulates our agen
cies for substitutes," he said in re
ferring to America's problem of ra
tioning.
The Axis has been preparing for
the war for nine years. "There were
no changes when they started the
war because they were already on a
war economy, he said.
Dr. Brandt said that only America
can win the war and "not in 1942."
"There will be six or eight more
months of bad news."
