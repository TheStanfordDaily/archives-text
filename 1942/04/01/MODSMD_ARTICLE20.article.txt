# Two Hundred Rooters Hail Farm Hoopsters

### 
Ahout 2ftft faithful basketball enthusiasts gathered al (he Palo Alto
railroad station yesterday morning to welcome the all-victorious Stan
lord Reds, just returned from a sweep of the N.C.A.A. play-offs in Kansas
City.
Although no representative of the team would speak to the crowd or

even pose with the trophy for anx-,
ious photographers, the homecoming
was the occasion of plenty of noise
and enthusiasm.
BANI) PLAYS
The; Stanford Band, cut down to a
seven-piece "combo," greeted the
southbound local with "Sons of the
Stanford Red," and the casaba he
roes stepped down from the last leg
of their long trip.
The much-heralded speeches by
members of the team failed to ma
terialize. The coach at any rally can
always be counted upon to say a
few words, but Everett Dean is vis
iting relatives in Indiana and did not
make the trip back with the team.
RECEIVE MEDALS
Don Burness and Bill Cowden
gingerly handed down the two tro
phies, one for the western champion
ship, the other for the national title,
to Al Masters and Don Liebendorfer.
Each boy was given a gold basket
ball and special NCAA belt, while
Howie Dallmar received a medal for
being the most valuable player in
the finals of the tournament.
Jim Pollard, who was sidelined in
the final game with Dartmouth, has
recovered from an attack of sinus
itis; but he did not return to school
yesterday, spending the day with his
family in Oakland.
"We were really scared there
when Dartmouth had us 12-6," said
Dallmar, "until Munroe cooled off
we were plenty worried."
Members of the team expressed
appreciation of the arrangements
and entertainment given them in
Kansas City.
