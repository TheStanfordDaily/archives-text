LACKS POWER
The student governing body came
to the conclusion that it did not
have the power to throw out the old
constitution even in an emergency
without consulting the entire student
body. It was agreed that any new
war-time government at Stanford
would be specifically temporary; that
the school government would revert
to the old constitution at the end of
the war. Charley Bull suggested that
any features of the temporary gov
ernment could be retained after the
end of the emergency.
The decision to hold the spring
elections as usual was made after it
was agreed that the time before
spring elections was too short to
make any drastic changes.
HORTON PRESENTS
Horton presented the most com
plete idea of a streamlined war-time
student government. The plan con
sists of a central board at the head
of the school with three possible
means of representation on the
board: by living groups, on a unit
basis, or by schools.
Irma Jean Hannibal suggested a
concentrated committee, whose
members would include nuch officers
as president of men's council and
would thus be responsible to some
definite body. Other business fol

LACKS POWER
The student governing body came
to the conclusion that it did not
have the power to throw out the old
constitution even in an emergency
without consulting the entire student
body. It was agreed that any new
war-time government at Stanford
would be specifically temporary; that
the school government would revert
to the old constitution at the end of
the war. Charley Bull suggested that
any features of the temporary gov
ernment could be retained after the
end of the emergency.
The decision to hold the spring
elections as usual was made after it
was agreed that the time before
spring elections was too short to
make any drastic changes.

plete idea of a streamlined war-time
student government. The plan con

basis, or by schools.
Irma Jean Hannibal suggested a

would thus be responsible to some
definite body. Other business fol
