# Japanese Bomb U.S. Hospital In Bataan Area
## Nippons Start Major Offensive Against Bay Fortifications 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 31 (UP).—
Gen. Jonathan Wainwright reported
today the Japanese had bombed a
plainly-marked American base hos
pital on Bataan Peninsula, causing
"a number of casualties," and had
l<i(»se<l a double-barrelled bombard
ment of Corregidor and adjacent
Manila Bay fortresses.
Enemy bombers and shore-based
batteries hammered at the bay forti
fications simultaneously for the first
lime, emphasizing their determina
tion to knock out the strongholds
which have been under siege since
Dec. 29.
The War Department communique
indicated the base hospital was
bombed deliberately, inasmuch as
heretofore the Japs had "carefully
avoided" it.
Except for "sharp clashes" be
tween patrols, there was no ground
fighting in Bataan during the past
24 hours, but the enemy continued
its week-long dive bombing attacks
on and behind the American-Fili
pino front lines.
The dive-bombing attacks ap
peared to be part of the general
strategy to soften up the defending
positions for a full-scale assault.
fitting into this pattern was fre
quent patrol activity designed to
"feel out" Wainwright's lines. The
Japs thought they had found a we;ik
spot last Saturday and attacked
heavily; They were hurled back
with heavy losses.
