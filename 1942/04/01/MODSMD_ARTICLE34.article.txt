### 
The Red Cross, under the auspices
of the Y.W.C.A . is offering a course
of direction in Red Cross staff work.
The course will begin April 7, and
will be given from 4 to 6 p.m. in the
j "Y" rooms.
Although no credit will be offered
for the course, students taking it will
be certificated to the Red Cross Staff
Association. This certificate will en-
I title the individual to a staff posi
j tion in any town without the usual
18 hours of additional work.
A Red Cross Motor Corps course
is also being considered for this
quarter. Announcement of the time
and place for the course will be
made in the near future.
