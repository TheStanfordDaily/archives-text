# SCHROEDER SET FOR NET SMASH
## 
### 
Ted Schroeder, third-ranking national amateur
tennis player and premier Stanford netter, hits an
overhead smash in preparation for his match Satur
day afternoon with Southern California's number
one man, Ted Olewine. Schroeder, now a senior,
will be playing an ex-teammate in Olewine, since
he attended U.S.C. in his first two years of college.
WINS NATIONAL JUNIOR TITLE
As a senior in Glendale High School Ted first
gained national fame by winning the National
Junior championships. The following year he had
the great fortune to receive considerable coaching
from the greatest of them all, Bill Tilden, who at
the end of this time flatly stated that the slim Glen
dale lad would some day be the nation's greatest
netter.
As his first major step in proving Tilden's boast,
Schroeder went East in 1940 in company with Jack
Kramer and culminated a season of upset wins by
annexing the nationaj doubles championship.
GIVES KIGGS TOUGH BATTLE
It was with these honors heaped on him that
Schroeder entered Stanford in Winter Quarter 1941.
Because he had transferred from a four-year school
Ted was not eligible for international competition
for the Farm, but he did not lose his touch, as shown
by his performances last summer in winning the
doubles crown again and giving Bobby Riggs his
hardest battle for the singles.
