# Dallmar, Caruso, Wilson Turn Out For Baseball
## 
### 
Howie Dallmar, voted the most valuable man lo his team in (he N.C.A.A.
basketball finals at Kansas City last week, is ready to cxcell in another
sport. Yesterday Dallmar reported to baseball coach Harry Woltcr for
equipment, and will probably try for (he first base position held down

by Ray "Duke" Ilammett.
Woller's war-riddled pitching staff
received a severe reversal when
Dale Snyder left school to join the
Marines. He must report on Fri
day, and will leave for an officer's
training school. However, all is not
so dismal, for Bill Wilson, a right
hander from Aberdeen, Wash., is
now eligible for league competition,
and may even act as a relief hurler
in this week's games.
Two new battles for infield posi
tions have developed. With the re
turn of Captain Aurelio "Botch"
Caruso to the fold, Harry Parsons
and Leland Scott will have plenty
of competition in holding down the
spot. Parsons and Scott have both
been hitting well, with Parsons
capable of also playing in the out
field. Scott is effective for he is a
switch hitter. Caruso was one of the
Indians' leading hitters last season.
The other battle will pit Dallmar
against Hammett, with the latter
having an cdye, as he is one of the
leading sluggers in the league this
year. His big competition for league
honors come from Bruno "Mad Dog"
Konopka. Woltcr believes that Ham
mett is by far the better fielder, and
has a slight edge in hitting.
Ward Walkup, energetic sopho
more catcher who injured a finger on
a foul tip in the southern trip, is
ready and will probably be behind
the plate at game time against U.S.C.
on Friday.
Don Pendergrass, star left-hander,
is still ailing from a sore arm, but
will see action in the outfield.
DELAND. Fla., March 31 (UP).â€”
C. C. Slapnicka, who resigned as
general manager of the Cleveland
Indians last year, has joined the
ranks of ihe St. Louis Browns. Slap
nicka is chief scout and supervisor
of the farm system of the Browns.
