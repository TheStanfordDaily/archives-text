# Briton Fears Axis Merger Near Arabia
## 
### LORD STRABOLGI 
(In the following dispatch Lord
Strabolgi, member of the House of
Lords and a prominent writer on
military and naval strategy, out
lines what he believes to be an
obvious German-Japanese plan to
join forces in the Arabian sea
area.—Ed.)

LONDON, March 31 (UP).—Much
lies behind the virtual declaration of
war by the Bulgarian government
against Russia. This indication of a
coming story is like ripples upon the
surface of the ocean which indicate
to a mariner the direction of a tor
nado.
The obvious strategy for the Ger
mans and the Japanese is to attempt
a junction in the Arabian sea, which
washes the west coast of India and
the South Coast of Arabia. If sea
communications can be established
between these two widely separated
allies, Germany can be supplied
with rubber, metals and other raw
materials she lacks while Japan can
receive machine tools, and weapons
of which she is in need. This is a
grandiose plan involving great risks
but that it will be attempted is as
certain as anything in war.
INVASION OF CEYLON
The Japanese, having occupied
southern Burma and the Andaman
Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, will
attempt an invasion of Ceylon. From
there, they may hope to establish
sufficient control of the Arabian Sea
to enable them to pass convoys to
the Persian Gulf.
The corresponding German plan,
in its naked simplicity, is to reach
the Persian Gulf and possibly the
Red Sea.
GERMAN FITNESS
The whole of this grand strategy
depends on the fitness for battle of
the German military machine after
a long punishing defensive campaign
waged during the winter months on
the plains of Russia.
There will be fresh endeavors by
the German and Italian armies in
North Africa to advance on Egypt
and toward the Red Sea and there
may well be attempts to make at
tacks, or create diversions, from the
islands of Crete and Rhodes against
Cyprus and Syria.
DRIVE TOWARD GULF
But the main effort will now be
made along the northern shores 01
the Black Sea in an attempt to reach
the Volga and the shores of the Cas
pian Sea as a preliminary drive
southward toward the oilfields near
the Persian Gulf.
American naval strength is recov
ering and growing. Japanese losses
in warships and merchant shipping
in the Pacific campaign have been
substantial.
INDIAN OCEAN
British naval forces, moving north
from Durban in South Africa, can
dispute control of the Indian Ocean
and its two northern arms — the
Arabian Sea and the B&y of Bengal.
The German general staff, eager to
concentrate all available troops,
planes and tanks for a drive to the
east, will be anxious to counterat
tack from the North Sea and the
Atlantic.

A politically united India, whole
heartedly engaged in war on the
side of the Allies, can provide great
arms for the defense of India itself
and also assist in holding Iran and
Iraq. If the German armies can
hope to reach Persia, Indian armies
would be able to get there first.

British naval forces, moving north

dispute control of the Indian Ocean
and its two northern arms — the
Arabian Sea and the B&y of Bengal.
The German general staff, eager to

planes and tanks for a drive to the

LONDON, March 31 (UP).—Much
lies behind the virtual declaration of
war by the Bulgarian government
against Russia. This indication of a
coming story is like ripples upon the
surface of the ocean which indicate
to a mariner the direction of a tor
nado.
The obvious strategy for the Ger
mans and the Japanese is to attempt
a junction in the Arabian sea, which
washes the west coast of India and
the South Coast of Arabia. If sea
communications can be established
between these two widely separated
allies, Germany can be supplied
with rubber, metals and other raw
materials she lacks while Japan can
receive machine tools, and weapons
of which she is in need. This is a
grandiose plan involving great risks
but that it will be attempted is as
certain as anything in war.
INVASION OF CEYLON
The Japanese, having occupied
southern Burma and the Andaman
Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, will
attempt an invasion of Ceylon. From
there, they may hope to establish
sufficient control of the Arabian Sea
to enable them to pass convoys to
the Persian Gulf.
The corresponding German plan,
in its naked simplicity, is to reach
the Persian Gulf and possibly the
Red Sea.
GERMAN FITNESS
The whole of this grand strategy
depends on the fitness for battle of
the German military machine after
a long punishing defensive campaign
waged during the winter months on
the plains of Russia.
There will be fresh endeavors by
the German and Italian armies in
North Africa to advance on Egypt
and toward the Red Sea and there
may well be attempts to make at
tacks, or create diversions, from the
islands of Crete and Rhodes against
Cyprus and Syria.

made along the northern shores 01
the Black Sea in an attempt to reach
the Volga and the shores of the Cas
