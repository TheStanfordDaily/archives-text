# Card Netters Picked to Drub Troy-On Paper
## 
### 
By substitution Stanford should
thoroughly wax Southern California
when the two schools' tennis teams
meet on the local varsity courts
Saturday.
The Trojans barely defeated Cali- I
forma last week, 5-4; two weeks
previously the Bears lost to the j
Berkeley Club, 6-3; between these
two matches the Stanfords opened
their season by winning from the
Berkeley Club, 9-1. This leaves the
Cards with a nine-point advantage
over the Trojans.
Judging from their last matches |
the lineups of the two teams will be j
as follows, although Coaches Johnny 1
Lamb and George Toley may make
last-minute switches:
Singles: Ted Schroeder (S) vs.
Ted Olewine (SC); Emery Neale
(S) vs. Captain Bill Reedy (SC); J
Captain Larry Dee (S) vs. Henry
Zertuche (SC); Jim Wade (S) vs.
Don Sweet (SC); Ben Olson (S)
vs. Al Davenport (SC); Chuck
Hutchison (S) vs. BÂ«b Zellhofer
(SC).
Doubles: Schroeder and Dee vs.
Olewine and Zertuche; Neale and
Andy Roberts vs. Reedy and
Sweet; Wade and Paul Wilson vs.
Davenport and Zellhofer.
Although last year's Trojans de
feated the Farm men in their dual
match here, the Southerners have
lost four ranking players. Toley,
their coach, played second singles
last year behind Olewine, while
Charles Mattman, Ronald Lubin, and
Marv Carlock occupied the fourth,
fifth, and sixth positions.
Olewine is playing at the num
ber one spot this year, despite the
fact that Captain Reedy has never
lost a conference match, by virtue
of a win he holds over the latter
in a practice match earlier in the
season.
Coach Lamb has not definitely de
cided on the men who will play the
last two singles positions yet. Chuck
Hopper until last week was fifth
man, but he is ineligible this quarter.
Olson, Hutchison, and Tom Kruger
will play off for the right to play
these matches.
In the doubles, Stanford will be
playing with two tandems that
have never worked together be-
I fore in intercollegiate competition,
Schroeder and Dee, and Wilson
and Wade.
During vacation the former inter
collegiate championship duo of Dee
and Wade broke up in order to en
able Dee to play with Schroeder.
There may still be more changes
next week before the Cal match since
Lamb is considering combining
Neale and Wade and Roberts and
Wilson.
