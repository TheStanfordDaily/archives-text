ILL "Zertooch" play number three, or will he be sixth? Thai is the
question all died-in-the-ersatz tennis fans will be wondering about
Saturday afternoon when the Trojan tennis squad takes the courts against
the L.S.J.U. boys.
For the uninitiated, Henry Zertuche, an innocent netman, was the pawn
in the hands of the villain in our mellerdrama, George Toley. It seems
that Toley, S.C. tennis coach and a s-

just the type to play the heavy, be
fore the recent Trojan-Bear tennis
match in the Southland juggled his
line-up to put Henry, ostensibly the
third peachiest man on his team, in
the number six position. Henry went
on to win his match, which decided
the team count in favor of S.C., 5-4.
Now this sort of thing just isn't
cricket in tennis, even when the
match isn't important, but when the
fate of an athletic contest between
two such gigantic institutions of
learning hangs in the balance,
well . . .
For the three days following the
match the Troy campus wore black
crepe bemoaning the death of
sportsmanship in the school. They
didn't appreciate their win at all. But
up comes Toley, the villain, defend
ing his selections in print, saying
that Henry just wasn't playing up to
snufT that week and so was right
fully demoted.
In the second installment of our
opus—the Bruin-Trojan match the
next week — "Zertooch" is sure
enough playing third. But S.C. was
sure to win this anyway so nothing
was proven by this move, one way
or the other.
Saturday against the Cards, Toley
isn't at all sure of winning and so
is going to make an all-out effort.
If lie comes up with the statement
that Henry's game has gone to pot
again and therefore will be No. 6
again, we will know that there is a
proverbial "colored man in the
kindling." If Hank is in the third
position, however, we can be as
: sured that good sportsmanship has
i not yet died, and that "Zertooch"
; actually did have a tepid stretch.
FAR what has been said here
has had absolutely nothing to

do with the cut of Vic Lindskog ap
pearing in this column, but don't
give up hope, here it comes. . . .
Vicious Vic in six weeks time had
become Pitch Johnson's "white
hope"' in the weights this spring,
since his shot-putting has blossomed
from 41 feet to over 46. In comes an
offer to coach grid with money at
tached to it, and out goes Vic's lily
white amateur standing. C'est la
vie.

TORONTO. March 31 (UP). —The
Toronto Maple Leafs, runners-up to
the champion Rangers in the 1942
National League hockey race, elimi

Stanley Cup playoffs with a 3-2

crepe bemoaning the death of
sportsmanship in the school. They
didn't appreciate their win at all. But
up comes Toley, the villain, defend
ing his selections in print, saying
that Henry just wasn't playing up to
snufT that week and so was right
fully demoted.
In the second installment of our
opus—the Bruin-Trojan match the
next week — "Zertooch" is sure
enough playing third. But S.C. was
sure to win this anyway so nothing
was proven by this move, one way
or the other.
Saturday against the Cards, Toley
isn't at all sure of winning and so
is going to make an all-out effort.
If lie comes up with the statement
that Henry's game has gone to pot
again and therefore will be No. 6
again, we will know that there is a
proverbial "colored man in the
kindling." If Hank is in the third
position, however, we can be as
: sured that good sportsmanship has
i not yet died, and that "Zertooch"
; actually did have a tepid stretch.
FAR what has been said here
has had absolutely nothing to

do with the cut of Vic Lindskog ap
pearing in this column, but don't
give up hope, here it comes. . . .
Vicious Vic in six weeks time had
become Pitch Johnson's "white
hope"' in the weights this spring,
since his shot-putting has blossomed
from 41 feet to over 46. In comes an
offer to coach grid with money at
tached to it, and out goes Vic's lily
white amateur standing. C'est la

ILL "Zertooch" play number three, or will he be sixth? Thai is the
question all died-in-the-ersatz tennis fans will be wondering about
Saturday afternoon when the Trojan tennis squad takes the courts against
the L.S.J.U. boys.
For the uninitiated, Henry Zertuche, an innocent netman, was the pawn
in the hands of the villain in our mellerdrama, George Toley. It seems
that Toley, S.C. tennis coach and a s-

just the type to play the heavy, be
fore the recent Trojan-Bear tennis
match in the Southland juggled his
line-up to put Henry, ostensibly the
third peachiest man on his team, in
the number six position. Henry went
on to win his match, which decided
the team count in favor of S.C., 5-4.
Now this sort of thing just isn't
cricket in tennis, even when the
match isn't important, but when the
fate of an athletic contest between
two such gigantic institutions of
learning hangs in the balance,
well . . .
For the three days following the
