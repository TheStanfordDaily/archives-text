# Waters Is Doubtful Starter For Olympic Club Saturday
## 
### 
Although Bob Waters, Stanford '
sophomore now running for the '
' Olympic Club, was listed as the
' club's sprinter in its entry list for
its meet with the Indians on Angell j
1 Field Saturday, indications here are
I "
j that he is a doubtful starter since
he has not worked out more than a J
few times.
Heading the entries that Winged
"O" Coach Charley Hunter sent
down for the meet is Cornelius War
merdam, world pole vault record
holder, who will attempt to raise his
own mark of 15 feet 7 Vj inches.
JADDEN MEETS COMMON
One of the day's best races looms
in the 880 where Paul Jadden, ex-
Princeton runner now in the army,
will meet Bob Compton and Wyland
Cripe of the Farm. Compton in his
last outing ran a creditable third in
the Olympic Club's indoor meet
100-yard dash.
Four former Stanford students
will appear for the club against their
alma mater Saturday. Tom Mont
gomery will throw the shot and
discus; Phil Fox, school record hold
er in the discus, will compete in his
favorite event; Paul Ganahl in the
two-mile; and Russ Wulff in the
j high jump.
SPRINTERS OUT
Coach Pitch Johnson lost his two
top sprinters this week when Buck
Fawcett became ineligible with the
turn of the quarter and John Sylva
has been sidelined with a bad leg.
'Bill Quackenbush leads the remain
-5 ing dashmen with Captain Gene

[ Kern, Vern Hart, and Pal Taylor also
| possibilities.
Kern, along with running the 100,
will probably compete in the broad
i jump, discus, shot put, and 220 for
the Farm. This combination iron
man and captain fills whatever gaps
! there may be in the team.
