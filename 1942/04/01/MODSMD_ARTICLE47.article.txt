CARDINAL policy of the Board of Athletic
Control this year and for the ensuing war
years is to save money wherever possible.
Minor sports coaches have already been noti
fied the B.A.C. may not be able to renew their
contracts for next year, and that it might be wise
for them to look elsewhere. At its last meeting
the B.A.C. voted to limit expenditures as strictly
as possible on traveling expenses for all teams
for the rest of the current academic year, and
it's almost a sure thing that even the new head
football mentor will not receive the salary that
Clark Shaughnessy, "Tiny" Thornhill and oth
ers of his predecessors knew.
The obvious reason for these financial re
trenchments is, of course, the decreased ex
pectancy in financial revenue during wartime
football seasons, due to anticipated crowd limi
tations of 5,000.
In this connection, it seems the practice dur
ing spring vacation this year of transporting
the Stanford baseball team in Los Angeles from
the hotel to games by means of taxis is not
only an unnecessary extravagance but a foolish
one. It's a long ways from Hotel Knickerbocker
to Bovard Field and to U.C.L.A.
Given good-looking traveling jackets, they
could hitch-hike!
