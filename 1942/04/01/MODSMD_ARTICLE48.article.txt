# Good Hosts
## 
### 
STANFORD'S national championship basket
ball team enjoyed the support of Kansas
City sport fans throughout the N.C.A.A. tourna
ment.
Phog Allen's Kansas University team was
eliminated in the first round, and from that time
on, the fans were behind Stanford. Even when
poor Dartmouth was behind some 15 points, the
Kansas City folk continued to support Stanford
instead of rallying behind the underdog as most
crowds do when no local interests are involved.
In addition to the marvelous support given
our boys back there, the hosts did their best to
fill in the Indians' idle week. Phog Allen took
the boys through the University of Kansas,
alumni arranged parties and sightseeing tours,
and Everett Dean arranged a few workouts just
to remind the boys that the season was not over.
However, the workouts before the Dartmouth
game were limited because the floor at the Kan
sas City Auditorium was guite hard. One of
the highlights of the between-playoffs week was
a trip through a bomber plant, where some of
the employees applauded our boys. •
The people of Kansas City did a great deal to
make Stanford's stay an enjoyable one; and it
is noteworthy that many people were impressed
with the basketball ability of boys NOT from
the Middle West.—Hap Everett
