### AMIE REICHERT 
HITLER came down from his Berchtesgaden
crow's nest, left the sanctuary where his inner
voices prescribed to him some weeks ago.
Mysticism apparently did not agree with Dei Fueh
rer, or with his frozen, stale-mated soldiers in Russia.
Maybe the trouble was that the soliders didn't have
the proper equipment for waging warfare the mystical
way. They should have had ouija boards and special
earphones for communication with the other world,
and with the Inner Man who was talking so. volubly
to their leader.
As it was, they didn't have any of these things, and,
incidentally, they also didn't have warm overcoats and
airplane motors that could function in the sub-zero
Russian cold, and equal strength to fight their coura
geous enemy.
Well, now Herr Hitler has tired of playing games.
He has put away his swami outfit and his crystal ball
and the German brass hat that he thought he would
pull the Russian bear out of, and all the rest of his
toys, and he is sitting quietly while the older boys tell
him how to wage and win a war.
He is sitting at a table with the resurrected gen
erals von Brauchitsch and Bock and Rundstedt. Rom
mel of the Afrika Corps is there, too, and these men
are planning the big Nazi spring offensive which is
now only a matter of a small amount of time.

HPHIS is no seance. It is a council of war, and these
men are not talking about revelations or mystic
chimes. They are talking about oil, and they are won
dering how they are going to get it.
They look at the map on the table in front of them
and they mark in red pencil the areas of Baku in the
Russian Caucasus and the oil-rich countries of the
Middle East: Iran and Iraq and Syria. They may have
Turkey marked with red pencil, too, for, depending on
which way they go, Turkey may be in the way. We
shall soon see.
They are planning their itinerary. They debate be
tween two drives; perhaps they will venture both—a
huge pincer movement that will squeeze all the oil
wells marked in red dust-dry.
They debate and talk and figure. They wonder if
they should skirt Tux - key or try to conquer that moun
tainous country.
Meanwhile their armies are almost silent on the
Russian front. They sustain losses, but not great
enough ones to seriously menace the big spring fling.
Their air force is silent—for months now. It is build
ing and expanding and getting in shape.
The world is waiting to hear and to see what that
council decides. The world is wondering now that
spring has replaced winter, now that strategy has re
placed spiritualism, if the blitzkrieg will come into its
own once more.
