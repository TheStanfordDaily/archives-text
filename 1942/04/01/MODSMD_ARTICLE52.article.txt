### MIKE CHURCHILL 
I'M BACK
r JHHE DOOR of the plane opened at Medford and a
booming voice said, "Any doubles here?" Never
thinking, I quickly said, "Yes, with plain water,
please."
The stewardess testily explained to my bitter dis
appointment that a couple of men just wanted a double
seat, and weren't taking orders.
There were no doubles, liquid or seats, so one of
the men sat himself heavily down beside me. He
looked as though he was a timber cruiser, and prob
ably was named Svensen. The way he eyed the stew
ardess convinced me that he was a member of the
logging trade.
"If I didn't know you weren't," he said, turning to
me, "I would think you were my cousin."
I could think of nothing suitable to say to this
other than to agree that I wasn't his cousin. I could
tell that he would feel hurt if I didn't keep the con
versation open so I asked where his cousin lived.
"Butte," he said, "but one's at St. Mary's and the
other is a doctor in Frisco."
The fact that there are three of us almost indis
tinguishable from one another and all in the Bay
Area was for the moment a little disquieting.

461 INTIL you have tasted this fried chicken, you
haven't eaten," was his next rejoinder, as the
stewardess began to serve dinner.
He had not learned the cardinal rule of sociable
travel which demands that you never assume a fellow
to be less experienced than yourself. This holds par
ticularly true when dealing with the opposite sex.
I was progressing well with my meal when the air
got rough. With hardly an interruption in the lacera
tions he was inflicting upon the chicken before him, my
companion immediately explained how much worse
was the preceding flight to Medford. So bad, in fact,
that "two babies and two women got sick and the
stewardess had to stop serving lunch."
His talc of horror, the rough air, and the mayhem he
was committing on the fowl before him made me feel
that I didn't care if I ever saw a chicken again.
There was only one woman passenger aboard and
she turned out to be a stewardess on vacation.
"Fine kid," said my fellow traveller of this lady,
"knows everybody who has ever flown with her." He
immediately put this theory to test and in his case,
at least, was right.
"If I'da known she was aboard, I wouldn't have sat
here," he leered. "In fact, I won't be here much longer."
With that he gave me a severe chest wound with his
elbow and left.

"If I didn't know you weren't," he said, turning to
me, "I would think you were my cousin."
I could think of nothing suitable to say to this
other than to agree that I wasn't his cousin. I could
tell that he would feel hurt if I didn't keep the con
versation open so I asked where his cousin lived.
"Butte," he said, "but one's at St. Mary's and the
other is a doctor in Frisco."
The fact that there are three of us almost indis
tinguishable from one another and all in the Bay
Area was for the moment a little disquieting.

461 INTIL you have tasted this fried chicken, you
haven't eaten," was his next rejoinder, as the
stewardess began to serve dinner.
He had not learned the cardinal rule of sociable
travel which demands that you never assume a fellow
to be less experienced than yourself. This holds par
ticularly true when dealing with the opposite sex.
I was progressing well with my meal when the air
got rough. With hardly an interruption in the lacera
tions he was inflicting upon the chicken before him, my
companion immediately explained how much worse
was the preceding flight to Medford. So bad, in fact,
that "two babies and two women got sick and the
stewardess had to stop serving lunch."
His talc of horror, the rough air, and the mayhem he
was committing on the fowl before him made me feel
that I didn't care if I ever saw a chicken again.
There was only one woman passenger aboard and
she turned out to be a stewardess on vacation.
"Fine kid," said my fellow traveller of this lady,
"knows everybody who has ever flown with her." He
immediately put this theory to test and in his case,
at least, was right.
"If I'da known she was aboard, I wouldn't have sat
here," he leered. "In fact, I won't be here much longer."
With that he gave me a severe chest wound with his
elbow and left.
I'M BACK
r JHHE DOOR of the plane opened at Medford and a
booming voice said, "Any doubles here?" Never
thinking, I quickly said, "Yes, with plain water,
please."
The stewardess testily explained to my bitter dis
appointment that a couple of men just wanted a double
seat, and weren't taking orders.
There were no doubles, liquid or seats, so one of
the men sat himself heavily down beside me. He
looked as though he was a timber cruiser, and prob
ably was named Svensen. The way he eyed the stew
ardess convinced me that he was a member of the
logging trade.

me, "I would think you were my cousin."
