## CHEMISTRY AND WOMEN 
### 
'T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
While attending one of those numerous Encina
bull sessions one night, I happened to hear this very
interesting bit of tripe on the subject of women. Did
you ever hear of a bull session that was on any
other subject than women? Oh, well, this is off the
subject. However, here it is. It is on the subject of
a "Chemical Analysis of Women."
Element: Woman
Symbol: WO
Accepted Atomic Weight: 120
Occurrance: Found wherever man exists. Seldom
in the free state. With few exceptions, the common
state is preferred.
Physical Properties: All colors, sizes, and forms.
Usually is in distinguished condition. Boils at nothing
and may freeze at any minute. However, melts when
properly treated. Very bitter if not well used.
Chemical Properties: Very active. Possesses great
affinity for gold, platinum, silver, and precious stones.
Violent reaction when left alone. Ability to absorb
great amounts of expensive foods at any time. Turns
green when placed beside a better looking specimen.
Ages rapidly.
Uses: Highly ornamental. Wide application in the
arts of domestic sciences. Useful as a tonic in the
acceleration of sickness, low spirits, etc. Equalizes the
distribution of wealth. Is probably the most powerful
j (income) reducing agent known.
Caution: Highly explosive when in inexperienced
