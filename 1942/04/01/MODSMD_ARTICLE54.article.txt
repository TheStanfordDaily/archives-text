# Miller Heads Bandleaders Poll For 1942
## 
### SAM HOLMES, Associate 
Editor, Student Opinion Surveys
Two dance bands—Glenn Miller
and Tommy Dorsey—walked of! with
over half of the ballots cast in a
recent Student Opinion Surveys of
America poll conducted on college
campuses all over the country to de
termine the students' favorite dance
orchestra.
Miller, who ranked first in 1941,
led the favorites with three votes to
every one for Dorsey, who took sec
ond place. Final tabulations show
Miller with 43 per cent of the entire
vote, and Dorsey with 13 per cent.
Some 40 other bands were men
tioned.
The question asked was: '"Which is
your favorite dance orchestra?" The
bands mentioned most often were as
follows: Glenn Miller, Tommy Dor
sey, Guy Lombardo, Kay Kyser,
Sammy Kay, Benny Goodman, Fred
Waring, Wayne King, Harry James,
Charile Spivak, Jimmy Dorsey,
Xavier Cugat, and Freddie Martin.
It is interesting to compare the re
sults of this survey with the results
obtained in a recent poll conducted
by "Down Beat," leading dance band
magazine, which did not confine the
balloting to college students. In the
latter, Glenn Miller was voted the
best sweet band, and Benny Good
man the "King of Swing." It is sig
nificant to note that Tommy Dorsey
ranked second in both the sweet and
swing divisions.
Miller, however, was ranked sec
ond to Guy Lombardo, who was
voted "King of Corn."
