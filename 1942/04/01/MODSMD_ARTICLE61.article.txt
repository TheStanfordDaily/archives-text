Applications for summer positions
are being accepted according to Miss
Palmer of the Appointment Office.
Calls for women councilors in girls'
summer camps have been received
while students of 21 and over are
being particularly considered for
counciling and life guard positions.
Miss Palmer declares that there
have been many inquiries for hash

and also calls for boys to do garden
ing and home repairs.
Representatives from summer re
