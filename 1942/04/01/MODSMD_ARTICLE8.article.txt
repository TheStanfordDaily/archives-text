# Men's Council Tries 2 Cases
## 
### 
Men's Council held a special meet
ing yesterday in the A.S.S.U. offices
to handle honor code violations
which have arisen.
Council Chairman Bob Morton an
nounced that the first regular meet
ing will be held next Monday at
which time the group will deal with
new traffic violations and clear up
honor code violations pending from
last quarter.
The Council discussed two last
quarter honor code violations. No
decision was made on either case
and the discussion will continue on
the two eases when the final action
will be taken.
The group also discussed the pos
sibility of adding a 25-cent defense
stamp fine to all traffic fines. But
this was voted down, the consensus
being that this would not be the
proper method of raising funds for
defense.
Morton also stated that a report of
last quarter's honor code violations,
particularly those committed during
finals, will be made at the next
meeting.
One case under consideration is
without precedent, being more com
plex because of war conditions. The
decision in this case will serve as a
rule for similar cases which may
arise in the future.
