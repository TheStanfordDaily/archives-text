# Coast-to-Coast Radio Debate Tops Kessler, Grannis Tour
## 
### 
Jim Kessler and Shorty Grannis, Stanford's nation-touring varsity de
bate team, speak before a Stanford Alumni Association meeting tonight in
Washington, D.C., with the highlight of the far-eastern portion of their
7,000-mile jaunt, a radio debate over a coast-to-coast CBS network, defi-

scheduled for Saturday night.
Kessler will represent Stanford on
the hook-up while Grannis remains
in Philadelphia to appear at the
University of Pennsylvania. The
team leaves Washington tomorrow to
meet Swarthmore College in Phila
delphia PYiday evening.
RECONSTRUCTION EMPHASIZED
Most of the debating emphasis is
on the question of post-war peace,
worded, "Resolved: That after the
war a federation of democracies
should be formed to establish the
principles of the Atlantic Charter."
Grannis and Kessler have appeared
on the campuses of most of the im
portant mid-western colleges to re
lay Stanford views.
In a special release to The Stan
ford Daily, they find that:
"Students at the colleges we have
visited — Nebraska, lowa, Chicago,
Northwestern, Wisconsin, Indiana,
Purdue, Notre Dame, etc.—are tak
ing the war much as we are at Stan
ford. Most have been urged to con
tinue in school until they are called.
A great many are in R.O.T.C. or in
V-7. Relatively few have been
drafted, as yet, although they all an
ticipate great enrollment drops in
the fall. Virtually all are on a 12
months' schedule, with Saturday
classes for all. Purdue and Indiana
arc both conducting defense bond
drives. Purdue, for example, has
set its quota at $3,000 for a student
body at 6,500."
MIDDLE WEST AWAKE
In other portions of the release the
speakers noted that , . before Pearl
Harbor the Middle West was con
sistently described as the great iso
lationist bulwark. The Japanese at
tack of course has changed all that.
In general, the once isolationist
Middle West is as much at war as we
are. Only in its blackout prepara
tions and disaster preparations arc
we ahead of them.
. . the Chicago Tribune con
tinues its role of Cassandra, railing
at the Administration's every move."
END TOUR IN APKIL
After the duo rejoins in New York,
Sunday, they will meet St. John's
University in New York, then swing
ing west again to end their tour in
Seattle about the middle of April.
Varsity Manager Jim Frolik of
Stanford stated last night that judg
ing from the letters coming back
from the touring speakers, the pres
ent national tour seems to be the
most timely and most successful of
any in previous seasons.
