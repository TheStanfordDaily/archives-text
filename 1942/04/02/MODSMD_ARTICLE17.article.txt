# Liebendorfer Reminisces On Old Days
## 
### BILL STEIF 
Genial, balding Don Liebendorfer
took a drag on his eigarette and
said, "Gee, it's been a long time."
Connected with Stanford for the
past 21 years in the role of student
and then as publicity director for
the 8.A.C., Liebendorfer has had
more than a usual opportunity to
know the interesting Coast person
alities in both the sport and jour
nalistic worlds.
Don came to Stanford in the fall
of 1921 and by the last half of 1924
had become editor of The Daily, do
ing a trick as sports editor of The
Daily on his way up. Meanwhile,
the 8.A.C., seeing that intercolle
giate sports were growing to be an
important phase of college life, was
scouting around for a part-time pub
licity director. Don got the job, took
his degree in journalism at the end
of summer quarter, 1925, and has
held the position of publicity di
rector ever since.
FIRST PUBLICIST
Don, who today is also head of the
Palo Alto Rationing Board, believes
that he is the first full-time athletic
publicity director possessed by any
university in the country. Most of
the big schools, as far as Lieben
dorfer has been able to discover, did
not appoint publicists until 1927 or
1928, many of them following Stan
ford's lead.
As a result of his position, Don
figures that he has travelled between
50,000 and 100,000 miles either with
Stanford athletic teams or preceding
them. Much of this travel, of course,
has come during football season,
when the Farm's publicist usually
travels four or five days ahead of the
team to give the journalists of other
cities information on the eleven.

In the course of his work Liehcn
dorfer has seen many of the Farm's
great athletes. He still thinks, how
ever, that Ernie Ncvers was the
greatest all-around athlete of them
all. "In addition to being a superb
fullback," stated Don, "Ernie was
a very fine basketball forward and
pitched for the baseball team. Ho
also won a place in the weight events
of the Cal-Cardinal track meet
when lie was a frosh but gave up
track after his freshman year."
RECALLS VOW BOYS
Liebcndorfer reminisced further
about the Vow Boys and commented
that "Grayson was one of our
greatest running backs, the team's
.real sparkplug, while "Bones" Ham
ilton was the greatest blocking back
Stanford has ever had." Don ought
to know, since he has not only been
writing about Stanford football since
1925. but has also been the commen
tator at all the Farm's home grid
contests since the loudspcaking sys
tem was installed in the stadium in
1927.
On the subject of Clark Shaugh
nessy's recent departure to the Uni
versity of Maryland, Stanford's pub
licist said, "I am sure that Shaugh
nessy left Stanford reluctantly.
There was and is the question of
how much football will be played
on the Coast next fall, and he felt it
