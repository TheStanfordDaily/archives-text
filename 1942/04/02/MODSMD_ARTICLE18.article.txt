# Cripps Making Desperate Effort to Save Mission; India Compromise Seen
## British Leader Talks with Nehru As Congress Holds Back Refusal; English May Agree to Concession 
### 
NEW DELHI, April 1 (UP). â€”Sir Stafford Crpps opened negotiations
with All-India Congress party leaders tonight in a last-minute effort to
stave off failure of his mission to swing India fully into the war against
Japan, and hopes arose that a compromise might he reached.
Cripps invited to his residence Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, most influen-

tial member of the party, and Mau
lana Abul Kalam Azad, its Moslem
president. Cripps had said that there
would be no negotiations, that India
must accept Britain's plan for do
minion status after the war, or re
ject it as it stood, but it was ap
parent now that he was making a
desperate effort to break the dead
lock arising from India's demand to
be able to name its own defense
minister.
OUTCOME SECRET
Outcome of the conference was
secret, but there were indications
that Cripps believed transfer to In
dian hands of at least some measure
of responsibility for India's defense
during the war might turn the tide.
Informed quarters said earlier
that Cripps was understood to have
sent an SOS to the British War
Cabinet informing it that a conces
sion to the Indians on their demand
for their own defense member of tho
viceroy's executive council might
still save his mission.
The dominant All-India Congress
party held back for another day
from saying "no" to Britain's pro
posals, even though the party's
working committee was reported to
have agreed unanimously to reject
them unless they were altered rad
ically.
INDIAN ON COUNCIL
The new formula under discussion
was understood to call for an Indian
Minister of Defense Co-ordination,
who would preside at meetings of
the Defense Council, of which Gen.
Sir Archibald Wavell, commander
in-chief of the British Imperial forces
in India, also would be a member.
The Indian minister would have
charge of civil defense, internal de
fense, air-raid precautions and
similar matters.
Cripps was said to have accepted
this formula, but the attitude of the
Congress party toward it was not
expected to become clear until to
morrow.
