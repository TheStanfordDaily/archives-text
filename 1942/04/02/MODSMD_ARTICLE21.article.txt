### 
WASHINGTON, April 1 (UP). —
Bayonet-wielding defenders of Ba
taan Peninsula halted another large
scale Japanese attack today while
their ee:nrades ia the southern
Philippines carried out two spec
tacular raids that destroyed 22 en
emy wai eho uses and military in
staMations.
'I he actions were reported in war
communiques which told of the
heaviest fighting in two months. Ac
tivity burst forth from one end of
th. archipelago to the other on land,
at sea and in the air.
Ligge. I battle occurred on the
light center of Lie ut. Gen. Jonathan
M. Wainwright's Bataan line where
the Japs sought to break through,
only to be stopped with "heavy
casualties" in savage and sanguinary
hand-to- hand lighting.
OUTPOSTS LOST
Loss of some advance positions
v. i' s acknowledged but the "heavy"
a ault was stopped at bayonet
point before il reached the main de
fense line.
Meanwhile Corrqgidor's straight
shooting anti - aircraft gunners
knocked a flight of two heavy Japa
nese bombers into Manila Bay.
Most spectacular action, however,
v/as on the southernmost Philippine
i: land of Mindanao.
There, native Sulu units fighting
under the stars and stripes carried
out the most daring of two forays.
JAPS SURPRISED
In an audacious thrust that caught
the enemy completly flat-footed,
they stabbed into the heart of Japa
nese-occupied Zamboanga, inflicted
heavy casualties and damage and
withdrew wtihout suffering a single
loss. They destroyed several ma
chine gun nests and other military
installations.
A second and perhaps more de
structive raid was carried out by a
small band of American-Filipino
troops on a Jap supply base near
Digos in the Gulf of Davao.

taan Peninsula halted another large
scale Japanese attack today while
their ee:nrades ia the southern
Philippines carried out two spec
tacular raids that destroyed 22 en
emy wai eho uses and military in
staMations.
'I he actions were reported in war
communiques which told of the
heaviest fighting in two months. Ac
tivity burst forth from one end of
th. archipelago to the other on land,
at sea and in the air.
Ligge. I battle occurred on the
light center of Lie ut. Gen. Jonathan
M. Wainwright's Bataan line where
the Japs sought to break through,
only to be stopped with "heavy
casualties" in savage and sanguinary
hand-to- hand lighting.
OUTPOSTS LOST
Loss of some advance positions
v. i' s acknowledged but the "heavy"
a ault was stopped at bayonet
point before il reached the main de
fense line.
Meanwhile Corrqgidor's straight
shooting anti - aircraft gunners
knocked a flight of two heavy Japa
nese bombers into Manila Bay.
Most spectacular action, however,
v/as on the southernmost Philippine
i: land of Mindanao.
There, native Sulu units fighting
under the stars and stripes carried
out the most daring of two forays.
JAPS SURPRISED
In an audacious thrust that caught
the enemy completly flat-footed,
they stabbed into the heart of Japa
nese-occupied Zamboanga, inflicted
heavy casualties and damage and
withdrew wtihout suffering a single
loss. They destroyed several ma
chine gun nests and other military
installations.
A second and perhaps more de
structive raid was carried out by a
small band of American-Filipino
troops on a Jap supply base near
Digos in the Gulf of Davao.
