NEW DELHI. April 1 (UP).-Brit
ish troops have broken out of a
Japanese encirclement and fallen
j back on Prome. gateway to the
Burma oil fields, but the Japanese
are massing only 10 miles to the
j south and have complete control of
[ the air, an Allied communique re
vealed tonight.
With all territory behind them
firmly in their hands, it appeared the

| flanking movement, possibly forcing
j the Imperials to withdraw from
j Prome to prevent being cut ofT from
J their Chinese allies in central Burma.
Prome is on the east bank of the
! Irrawaddy River and the Japs are
j striding up both the east and west
banks, as well as lip the Rangoon-
Prome railway.
In eastern Burma, meanwhile, in
an almost parallel action, Chinese
j defenders of Toungoo, on the Ran
! goon -Manda lay Road, had smashed
j out of a Japanese encirclement and
j rejoined units of U.S. Lieut. Gen.
i Joseph W. Stilwell's North Burma
armies at Yedashe, 1H miles to the
I north.
(A communique issued Wednes
day night in Chungking said thai
severe fighting was continuing north
east of Toungoo. The communique
also disclosed that Japanese forces
were repulsed with heavy losses
; March 24 when they attempted to
dislodge Chinese troops from Man
