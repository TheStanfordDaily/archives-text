# Indians Face U.S.C.-Cal In Week-end Ball Games; Hope for Surprise Win
## 
### 
Friday's and Saturday's baseball games which pit the Indians against
U.S.C. and California will not setile any league titles. As it now stands.
Stanford will be battling to move out of the cellar position, having live
b»ses and no wins. On the other hand, both of the opponents are con
tenders for the C.1.8.A. championship.

+ If the Cards can pull a surprise
; victory out of the bag, it may put
either the Trojans or the Bears in
an advantageous position in the
league standings.
Friday's game will bring together
the hustling boys of Coach Harry
Wolter and the U.S.C. squad at 2:30
on the Sunken Diamond. The team
travels to Berkeley on Saturday to
lake on the blue and gold sluggers
of Coach Clint Evans.
U.S.C., CAL STANDINGS
The Trojans and the Bears play
j the "crucial" today.
Standings up to this game have
U.S.C. listed with five conference
i wins against two losses and U.C. with
! seven wins and three losses.
Rod Dedeaux, Trojan mentor,
probably will start Vitalich against
Evans' star hurler, Bill Werle. Then
that will mean that Tommy YVilkins
or Doug Essick will probably start
! the Friday game for Troy, while
J Clarence "Rudy" Ruonavaara will
j start on the mound for California on
| Saturday. Wilkins is the boy that
i got credit for the 2G-3 affair at Bo
j vard Field.
News has come from the Berkeley
| campus that hard-hitting first base
-1 man Kenny Norris is in Cowell Hos
pital with the measles and will be
i unable to play. George Wilson, the
j regular left fielder, will probably
j start at the keystone sack. Norris in
his last game against St. Mary's was
I the leading hitter, getting three hits
j in four trips to the plate.
FIRST SACKER DUEL
This culs short the expected duels
of the league's three outstanding
first basemen: Captain Bruno Ko
| nopka of U.S.C., Kenny Norris of
: U.C.. and Ray Hammett of Stanford.
There is very little to choose
! among these three boys, all being
excellent hitters and fielders. Coach
| Wolter thinks that Hammett is the
j best fielder in the Conference and
is as good a slugger as Konopka.
Without the services of Norris,
| Cal's hitting authority rests with
1 Captain Ray Amling, who collected
two hits out of three tries against
St. Mary's. The infield will be com
; posed of George Wilson at first,
either Thomas or Mcßroom at sec-
I ond, Don Weir at third, and Jack Al
j bright at shortstop. In the outfield
will be Captain Ray Amling at right
! field. Hal Cates at center, and either
Welch or Doug Donnan at left. Stan
Sharp will catch.
TROJAN LINE-UP
The Trojans will probably start
; Bruno Konopka at first, A1 Spaeter
{ at second. Bob White at third, and
Jake Palmer at shortstop. In the
outfield Bill White will probably
start at right with Cal Barnes in
| center and Badham in left. Bob
! DeLauer will be behind the plate.
