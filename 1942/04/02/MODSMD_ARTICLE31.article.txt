ell, second-ranking collegiate golfer
in the United States, Stanford Uni
verstiy's varsity golf squad opens
southern division play in the Pacific
Coast Conference against U.C.L.A.
Friday morning at 9 on the Farm
links.
A second tee party with U.S.C.,
Saturday morning, is scheduled by
Coach Eddie Twiggs, the Stanford
mentor who terms his 1942 hopes as
"good, but of course not as strong
as last year."

Twiggs relies on Frank McCann,
Sandy Tatum, George Traphagen,

Pete Jones, and Bob Baker to round I
out his present squad.
McCANN RUNNER-UP
McCann was runner-up to Brown
ell when the latter copped the Stan- j
ford Invitational tourney last year.
(Incidentally Brownell holds the |
Stanford University crown, the i
Northern California Golf champion- I
ship, and placed second in the na
tionals at Columbus, Ohio, last
summer.)
Tatum travelled with the varsity
to the Ohio clashes last year and has j
shown a great deal of improvement
in his game during the interim.
Three newcomers, George Traphag
en, called by Twiggs the "finest soph- \
omore I've ever had," Pete Jones, ;
medical student out for the first i
time, and Bob Barber, transfer from i
the University of Oregon, complete !
the roster.
CONFERENCE OPENS
The week-end matches open the !
four-way conference struggle in j
which Stanford, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and 1
Cal yearly fight for the southern title.
Pacific Coast play-offs between the j
southern winners and the northern
champ will eventually deposit one j
far-western team in the national
play-offs. Stanford golfers under
Twiggs have consistently placed in
the top ranks in coast link circles,
and eastern sports editors consider
Stanford the top-flight golf school in i
the West.

which Stanford, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and 1
Cal yearly fight for the southern title.
Pacific Coast play-offs between the j
southern winners and the northern
champ will eventually deposit one j
far-western team in the national
play-offs. Stanford golfers under
Twiggs have consistently placed in
the top ranks in coast link circles,
and eastern sports editors consider
Stanford the top-flight golf school in i
the West.


COACH TWIGGS
Built around Captain Bud Brown
ell, second-ranking collegiate golfer
in the United States, Stanford Uni
verstiy's varsity golf squad opens
southern division play in the Pacific
Coast Conference against U.C.L.A.
Friday morning at 9 on the Farm
links.
A second tee party with U.S.C.,
Saturday morning, is scheduled by
Coach Eddie Twiggs, the Stanford
mentor who terms his 1942 hopes as
"good, but of course not as strong
as last year."
With Brownell as the nucleus,
Twiggs relies on Frank McCann,
Sandy Tatum, George Traphagen,

Pete Jones, and Bob Baker to round I
out his present squad.
McCANN RUNNER-UP
McCann was runner-up to Brown
ell when the latter copped the Stan- j
ford Invitational tourney last year.
(Incidentally Brownell holds the |
Stanford University crown, the i
Northern California Golf champion- I
ship, and placed second in the na
tionals at Columbus, Ohio, last
summer.)
Tatum travelled with the varsity
to the Ohio clashes last year and has j
shown a great deal of improvement
in his game during the interim.
Three newcomers, George Traphag
en, called by Twiggs the "finest soph- \
omore I've ever had," Pete Jones, ;
medical student out for the first i
time, and Bob Barber, transfer from i
the University of Oregon, complete !
the roster.
CONFERENCE OPENS
The week-end matches open the !
four-way conference struggle in j
which Stanford, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and 1
Cal yearly fight for the southern title.
Pacific Coast play-offs between the j
