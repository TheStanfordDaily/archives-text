# '45 Tracksters To Face Sacs
## 
### 
Joe Batiste or no Joe Batiste, the
Stanford freshman track team is
going to turn on the heat next Satur
day in their meet against Sacra
mento J.C. on Angell Field which
will be staged simultaneously with
the varsity-Olympic Club feature.
Forget about Batiste and War
merdam for a while. Here are the
things to watch for:
Wjitch Jim Pettit break 10 fiat in
the 100. With little A1 Hoisch press
ing him every inch of the way Big
Jim might flirt with a 0.8 century.
Watch John Fulton, Bob Sears, or
Bruce Meyer hit the quarter in close
to 50 fiat. Fulton might sneak in the
40 second sector.
Watch Larry Gray run the mile
close to 4:30. He ran 4:36 a few
weeks back without anyone follow
ing him.
Watch Don Landale, Ross Dana,
and Jim Kresl all clear six feet in
the high jump. KreiJ may prefer
to run the high hurdles instead of
jumping; he's fast improving in that
event.
