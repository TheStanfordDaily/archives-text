# Card Varsity In Weekend Net Matches
## 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
Wjth the sun back out after a
day's absence and the cement crisp
and dry, Stanford's varsity netmen
came back to the courts yesterday
and toiled in preparation for their
week-end matches with Southern
California and U.C.L.A. The Cards
meet the Bruins on thq varsity
courts tomorrow at 1:30 and the
Trojans on Saturday.
TROJANS STRONG
The ißruins showed their strength
last week when they scared the Tro
jans before finally bowing down 5-4.
However, the Bruins have only Alex
Gordon and Georgie Treister who
can give the Indians any kind of real
trouble. Sid White, Arnold Schwab
and John Arensmeyer have won
matches but not against any players
that anyone has heard of, and so
they can't be counted on for too
many points against the powerful
Cards. The Bruin doubles team of
Gordon and White is strong, but the
rest of the doubles teams are in
experienced.
The Indians will play the Bruin
match without the services of Larry
Dee in the singles. Dee will be out
for a lab, but will be back in time
for the doubles.
WADF MOVES UP
With Dee out, Jimmy Wade moves
up to the third singles behind Ted
Schroeder and Emery Neale, Paul
Wilson, with wins over Ben Olsen
and Chuck Hopper, will handle the
fourth spot. And Olsen, who yes
terday defeated Tom Kruger G-4,
(5-2, in a position match, will play
five and Kruger six.
The doubles teams for the Indians
against the Bruins will be Schroeder
and Dee, Andy Roberts and Neale,
and the new combination of Wade
and Chuck Hutchinson.
The match with (he Trojans Sat
urday promises to produce some of
the most brilliant tennis there is and
well might be considered as the
team intercollegiate championships,
since the Indians and Trojans are
the two top teams in the nation.
OLEWINE HAS ADVANTAGE
Shroeder and Ted Olewine will
match strokes in the number one
singles. Olewine has been very hot
in practice sessions, and the cement
courts will be to his advantage,
j since Shroeder goes best when he
is playing on grass. The second
! singles will pit Neale against Bill
Reedy, one of the smoothest, steadi
-1 est players on the coast. Neale has
been the most impressive of all the
Indians in practice sessions, and the
1 match should provide fireworks for
the fans. Dee will probably tangle
with Henry Zertouche, who is the
third best for the Trojans, but Dee
| should take him, according to past
records.
If the Trojans use Reedy and Ole
wine together in the doubles in-
I stead of splitting them up, their
battle with Stanford's Dee and
Shroeder should produce tennis com
parable to that played on the center
court at Forrest Hills. Neale and
Roberts and Wade and Hutchinson
will be the other doubles teams for
the Cards.

been the most impressive of all the
Indians in practice sessions, and the
1 match should provide fireworks for
the fans. Dee will probably tangle
with Henry Zertouche, who is the
third best for the Trojans, but Dee
| should take him, according to past
records.
If the Trojans use Reedy and Ole
wine together in the doubles in-
I stead of splitting them up, their
battle with Stanford's Dee and
Shroeder should produce tennis com
parable to that played on the center
court at Forrest Hills. Neale and
Roberts and Wade and Hutchinson
will be the other doubles teams for
the Cards.
Wjth the sun back out after a
day's absence and the cement crisp
and dry, Stanford's varsity netmen
came back to the courts yesterday
and toiled in preparation for their
week-end matches with Southern
California and U.C.L.A. The Cards
meet the Bruins on thq varsity
courts tomorrow at 1:30 and the
Trojans on Saturday.
TROJANS STRONG
The ißruins showed their strength
last week when they scared the Tro
jans before finally bowing down 5-4.
However, the Bruins have only Alex
Gordon and Georgie Treister who
can give the Indians any kind of real
trouble. Sid White, Arnold Schwab
and John Arensmeyer have won
matches but not against any players
that anyone has heard of, and so
they can't be counted on for too
many points against the powerful
Cards. The Bruin doubles team of
Gordon and White is strong, but the
rest of the doubles teams are in
experienced.
The Indians will play the Bruin
match without the services of Larry
Dee in the singles. Dee will be out
for a lab, but will be back in time
for the doubles.
WADF MOVES UP
With Dee out, Jimmy Wade moves
up to the third singles behind Ted
Schroeder and Emery Neale, Paul
Wilson, with wins over Ben Olsen
and Chuck Hopper, will handle the
fourth spot. And Olsen, who yes
terday defeated Tom Kruger G-4,
(5-2, in a position match, will play
five and Kruger six.
The doubles teams for the Indians
against the Bruins will be Schroeder
and Dee, Andy Roberts and Neale,
and the new combination of Wade
and Chuck Hutchinson.
The match with (he Trojans Sat
urday promises to produce some of
the most brilliant tennis there is and
well might be considered as the
team intercollegiate championships,
since the Indians and Trojans are
the two top teams in the nation.
OLEWINE HAS ADVANTAGE
Shroeder and Ted Olewine will
match strokes in the number one
singles. Olewine has been very hot
in practice sessions, and the cement
courts will be to his advantage,
j since Shroeder goes best when he
is playing on grass. The second
! singles will pit Neale against Bill
Reedy, one of the smoothest, steadi
-1 est players on the coast. Neale has
been the most impressive of all the
Indians in practice sessions, and the
1 match should provide fireworks for
the fans. Dee will probably tangle
with Henry Zertouche, who is the
