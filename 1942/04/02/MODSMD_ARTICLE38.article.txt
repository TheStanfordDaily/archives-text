Frank Dias and Walter Bertran.
Dick Peter, who has hit 4:15 this
year, will run his last mile for the
club. He's headed for the army any
time now. Norm Bright, ex-Stan
ford runner, and Cecil Cole, ex-San
Mateo flash, complete the Olympic
Club entries. Both have run under
4:15 in their prime.
Card hurdlers Ed Hertel with times
of 14.8 in the highs and 24 flat in the
lows, and Don Reiss with .14.8 and
24.6, lead Stanford's entrants in
those events. Veterans Tom Morre,
Tom Whitney, and Hugh Ferrier
represent .the elub.
Olympic Club is definitely favored
lo take Saturday's track meet with
the Indians at Angcll Field, hut to
venture a pick of the individual
events would be a sheer impossi
bility. What can be done, however,
is to present the tacts in neat order,
and let the public figure it out for
itself.
Here goes:
The only club entrant in the
sprints is Bob Waters, Athertonized
Indian, and he's a doubtful starter.
Farm entrants in the dashes in
clude Bill Quaekenbush, Gene Kern,
Paul Taylor, and Vern Hart. Quaek
enbush leads the century men with
10.1, whereas he and Captain Kern
are the best furlongers at 22.5. John
Sylva, Cards' leading dashman, is
out of Saturday's meet with a pulled
muscle.
In the quarter, Greg Stout, ex-
California hurdler, is the only club
man entered. Bill Spaulding and
Morton Orme, with times of 52.8
and 53.2 respectively, are Stanford's
contribution.

Cardinal Bob Compton—best time,
1:58—-will face Phil Jadden, ex-
Princeton man and now of Uncle
Sam's forces at Los Angeles, who's
running for the club. Also members
of the San Francisco contingent are
Frank Dias and Walter Bertran.
