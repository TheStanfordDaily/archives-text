### H. D. THOREAU 
jy/|A HASN'T gotten his 14-jewel-17-carat-solid-gold-shoekproof Benrus
watch yet. As a reward for being such a good boy and for being
such a good basketball player Ma Bu-rness received the signal honor of
being chosen on a weekly news-magazine's ail-American hoop team.
Along with this position came the above-mentioned watchâ€”supposedly.
The day the magazine carrying the team was released there came to
the office of the sports editor of The Stanford Daily a bulky envelope from
the publishers of this magazine carrying in it various and sundry letters
from big officials of the two companies and a few hundred pages of
small press releases which they suggested we might run. Of course every
third word was either PIC magazine or BENRUS watches.
Despite all of their entreaties, not. a word of publicity for these con
cerns is going into the paper until they come through and give Don thf>
jewelry.

CTILL unknown is Dartmouth's reascfti for refusing to play the Great
k Lakes Naval Training Base basketball team, if the former won the
N.C.AA. tourney which they didnt' in case you hadn't heard.
Arrangements were being made for a benefit game to be held in Chi
cago between the winners of the title game and the Naval Base boys.
However, since the Green Indians wouldn't agree to play in the event
that they won, the whole game had to be called off. The game would have
been right on their way home, but they couldn't see it.

DUE apologies to Ted Schroeder for making him change his game
in mid-season. Had we been more considerate we would have noticed
that he usually holds the racquet in his right hand when swinging at the
tennis ball.
Now that The Daily has printed that big southpaw-swing Ted will
either have to finish the season left-handed, or possibly the Daily photog
rapher could take another shot of Schroeder hitting left-handed and switch
the negative over to right, or don't you follow trie.
