WARTIME Washington is drawing more and
more upon the Stanford faculty for co-oper
ation in conducting the war effort.
Today, Dr. Eliot G. Mears leaves for the na
tion's capital to join the staff of the War Ship
ping Administration.

Shipping has become the major problem of
the war at thie stage and the problem can be
solved at present only by making more effec
tive use of cargo space. Professor Mears' task
will be to study the shipping reguirements for
the entire Pacific area.

Professor Mears is the latest Stanford addition
to the emergency bureaucracy now running the
nation. Two other well-known professors re
cently joined wartime organizations in Washing
ton. Alvin C. Eurich of the School of Education,
who made out the current affairs tests for Time
magazine, is arranging tests for the Army. Paul
Hanna, another education professor, is now
with the National Resources Planning Board.
Several other Stanford professors have done
work of great value to the nation.
Some men who have not gone to Washington,
the men engaged in research right here at Stan
ford, are also making a vital contribution to the
war effort.—Hap Everett
