# Bullets and Banquets
## 
### 
IT is easy for members of our generation to sit
back in an easy chair and make observations
about the war. It is easy for us to say how
much different things were in the "last war."
It is easy for us to listen to our friends who were
living at the time and believe everything they
say, on faith. But it is not easy to understand
the spirit and attitude of many of our citizens at
the present time.
We understand, on faith, of course, that during
the "last war" the Palo Alto Elks held a ban
quet every time the announcement was made
that a number of men had been drafted, and
they invited the draftees as guests of honor.
Such a celebration entailed a good deal of ex
pense, but the Elks felt that it was a very excel
lent way to spend their money and do a great
service for the draftees.

It seems the Elks didn't stop at the banquets.
They got together groups of citizens to see the
boys when they left for the training camps.
Possibly the expense of the banquets would
make something on that order impractical at the
present, but going-away parties at depots could
be arranged and made into real successes.
People are beginning to wake up more now
that we are actually in the war, but there are
still many things that can be done. Why not
have a lot of peppy songs instead of the "My
Sister and I" type? Maybe the tune for "Buckle
Down Winsocki" would be appropriate.

There is a lot that can be done, and now is
the time to get started.—John Horrall
