# Move Over, Buddy

YESTERDAY afternoon at 4, Dr. Graham Stu
art probably expected to walk into his lecture
room, nod at familiar faces, pull out his watch
and place it on the rostrum, and proceed to
lecture to perhaps as large an audience as 15
students in the new one-unit course, Political
Science 30, known as "Problems of War and
Peace."
If this was his expectancy, and he confessed
it was, it was probably the greatest mistake of
his career. People came in droves, they over
flowed one lecture room and, when the class
was forced to a larger room, he couldn't start
lecturing because of the continual interruptions
of additional students pouring in. The second
room was soon filled; there must have been 300
students.
His lecture dealt with comparative assets and
liabilities of the various Axis and Allied coun
tries; it was information of vital interest to his
listeners. If the class mushrooms to even larger
proportions, we suggest he move it to the Edu
cation Auditorium.
Let critics of the Stanford ivory tower take a
lesson from this example of our wartime morale.
Also, we suggest the Public Exercises Com
mittee change the time of its scheduled Wed
nesday afternoon lectures at 4 o'clock to some
other day or hour to avoid conflict with the new
course.
