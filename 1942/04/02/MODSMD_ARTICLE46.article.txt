### AMIE REICHERT 
INDIA'S rejection of the Cripps plan is an unfortu
nate development, but it is no surprise. The reasons
are as old as British imperialism, British colonial mis
management, British exploitation, British unintelligent,
unenlightened overseas government.
Britain's colonial policy has a black record going
back to the days of the American revolution. The rec
ord is not all black, to be sure. There are white places
thereâ€”Canada, Australia, for example. But India is a
bad one, and we are just now seeing how bad a one
Burma was too.
It would appear on the face of it that the British
are bad rulers just so long as they can get away with
it. We didn't let them get away with it way back in
1776, and we taught them a lesson for a few days.
But the people of India have always been hopelessly
divided with conflicting political and religious parties,
a rigid inflexible caste system, a mass of uneducated,
poverty-stricken proletariat, and a hierarchy of wealthy
Princes who have played ball with the British as a
means of hanging onto their taj mahals and white
elephants.
The situation was a set-up and it was not hard for
the British to take over.
Now the Indians have come along and produced
some great men, strong and patriotic and fanatically
devoted to the cause of freedom and self-govern
ment. And these men have whipped up a lot of fight
and spirit among some of the less inert of their people,
and they have organized, but the trouble is that they
have not organized into one but many groups. There
is the Indian Congress composed of both Moslems and
Hindus and headed by Nehru and Ghandi, which wants
complete independence, which will not submit to a
dominion compromise so long as the British insist on
directing India's defenses for the duration. There is
the Moslem League which insists on remaining sepa
rate and aloof from the Congress, which hates and
fears the Hindus, and demands an independent Moslem
state.
These two groups will not compromise one jot, with
the British or with each other. The one liberal com
promising Indian voice, Sapru, has been drowned out
in the excitement and passion of the past weeks.

r PHE dilemma is many-sided. There is the fear that
if the British were to pull out of India completely
now. leaving the Indians to defend themselves, they
would be ripped apart by civil war and internal blood
shed and the Japs would be ruling the entire country
in no time. On the other hand, as things stand now,
the British cannot count upon the Indians for much
so long as they feel as they do. Like the Burmese,
there is the danger that they will turn against the
British and fight with the Japanese in the hope of
achieving independence under the invaders. In any
event, many of them feel that they would be no worse
off under Japanese rule than under British.
In the light of all the difficulties the British pro
posal presented by Cripps was a fair one, the best
possible at this moment. British liberals recognized
the fact that the mistakes of the past cannot be recti
fied overnight, not tonight at any rate, but the day will
come afer the war.

The Indians feel that the time is now, however,
because they realize that they are in a very strong
talking position and they mean to take advantage of
it. They do not want to wait, they probably feel
that they cannot trust the British. They want all or
nothing, and Britain cannot logically, safely give all
at this moment.

So they said no the other day and now everything
is up in the air. We won't know the real outcome of
all of this until the first Japanese foi'ces attack India.
That will probably be a ti'agic day.
