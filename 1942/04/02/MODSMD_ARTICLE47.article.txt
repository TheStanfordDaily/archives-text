# BULL SESSION
## 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
XTO-HUM, big- things are happening on campus, ho
hum. Little did the members of Excom realize
that it would be shaken to its very roots when asked
to go on a four-quarter basis. Somebody thought that
as summer quarter is now just like other quarters it
should have a similar student government.
I cannot decide whether this is a wartime priva
tion or just another blessing of democracy. Poor Ex
com. Now they have to come to summer quarter or
provide alternates. They are elected for three quar
ters so what to do with the fourth.
More students will be taking 18 units for four quar
ters so the old soph, junior, and senior classes will
tend to disappear, so how can they elect a class repre
sentative? We need Mac Arthur, too.

TPHE women of Stanford are also meeting grave ques
tions. Things are different now, it has at last been
realized. Women's Council is ready to face any emer
gency for the girls feel that "maybe something will
have to be done."
One of the rumors which has arisen, apparently
from a bull session that took place while a group of
girls were huddled around a telephone hoping for
date calls, is that all week-time two-thirties may be
come one-thirties. The theory was that it would seem
more war-like, raise scholarship, and lure more boys
out between Monday and Friday. These arc not listed
in order of importance.
Women's Council would probably like it known that
they have made no specific proposals, welcome all
suggestions, and will definitely still go out on two
thirties. Any takers?
The Women of Stanford have devised for them
selves, as only women could, a most complex system
of government. Many people have tried to figure it
out, only to meet with failure. As I understand it,
and I am easily confused, Miss Yost is a sort of ad
visory pinnacle to an administrative pyramid. Next
comes Women's Council, who on their own hook dream
up those dillies that we hear of every so often.
Then we have Women's Conference. This is the
spawning ground for the Bay Area Local of the Greater
League of American Club Women. It is a large and
august group, obscure in its function to all but the
multitude who compose it. Women's Conference is
Stanford Womanhood—fluctuating erratically between
the cool and calculating and the flustered and frus
trated.
Women are too engrossed with their own hypocry
sies to solve the present problem. I beseech them to
turn the whole matter over to Men's Council and abide
by the decision.

comes Women's Council, who on their own hook dream
up those dillies that we hear of every so often.
Then we have Women's Conference. This is the
spawning ground for the Bay Area Local of the Greater
League of American Club Women. It is a large and
august group, obscure in its function to all but the
multitude who compose it. Women's Conference is
Stanford Womanhood—fluctuating erratically between
the cool and calculating and the flustered and frus
trated.
Women are too engrossed with their own hypocry
sies to solve the present problem. I beseech them to
turn the whole matter over to Men's Council and abide
by the decision.
XTO-HUM, big- things are happening on campus, ho
hum. Little did the members of Excom realize
that it would be shaken to its very roots when asked
to go on a four-quarter basis. Somebody thought that
as summer quarter is now just like other quarters it
should have a similar student government.
I cannot decide whether this is a wartime priva
tion or just another blessing of democracy. Poor Ex
com. Now they have to come to summer quarter or
provide alternates. They are elected for three quar
ters so what to do with the fourth.
More students will be taking 18 units for four quar
ters so the old soph, junior, and senior classes will
tend to disappear, so how can they elect a class repre
sentative? We need Mac Arthur, too.

TPHE women of Stanford are also meeting grave ques
tions. Things are different now, it has at last been
realized. Women's Council is ready to face any emer
gency for the girls feel that "maybe something will
have to be done."
One of the rumors which has arisen, apparently
from a bull session that took place while a group of
girls were huddled around a telephone hoping for
date calls, is that all week-time two-thirties may be
come one-thirties. The theory was that it would seem
more war-like, raise scholarship, and lure more boys
out between Monday and Friday. These arc not listed
in order of importance.
Women's Council would probably like it known that
they have made no specific proposals, welcome all
suggestions, and will definitely still go out on two
thirties. Any takers?
The Women of Stanford have devised for them
selves, as only women could, a most complex system
of government. Many people have tried to figure it
out, only to meet with failure. As I understand it,
and I am easily confused, Miss Yost is a sort of ad
visory pinnacle to an administrative pyramid. Next
comes Women's Council, who on their own hook dream
up those dillies that we hear of every so often.
