# Jeeps Sought For Carnival
## 
### 
Although the Phi Psi flivver raffle
has been ruled out, the Soph Car
nival on April 10 promises to be of a
scale and novelty equal to any of
the extravaganzas which have gone
before, according to its sponsors.
The army camp south of the cam
pus is being contacted on the possi
bility of providing jeeps in which to
spin carnivalites around the Farm.
The Phi Delts will be holding their
dimc-a-dance concession again, and
the perennial Zete "mystery booth"
will doubtless be on hand. Rumor
has it that a certain sorority is con
templating the staging of a carnival
follies.
All concession features, old and
new, being planned by each living
group, are to be turned in by Fri
day to Concession Chairman Bob
Hind, Chi Psi, or to one of his as
sistants: Dick Middleton, fraternities;
Nan Whedon and Virginia Stammer,
sororities; Dori Redmon, women's
halls; Jack Monteverde, men's halls.
Other committee heads include
Bill Mapel. finance; Ernestine Dietz,
publicity; and Hal Pet rich, construc
tion.
Also, a new department has been
added for this year—the welcoming
committee—in charge of Bill "'Social
Sam" Hooper.
