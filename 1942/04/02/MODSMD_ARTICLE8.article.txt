Note: Executive Committee has authorized The Daily to
further present and interpret editorially its plans to solve
the election problem, something whjch could not be done
yesterday because of the necessity for objective news
presentation in the news columns, and due to deadline limi
tations of the editorial column.
Student concern over what the war and the resulting four
quarter system at Stanford will do to student government and,
more specifically, to the imminent spring elections of this quar
ter, should be satisfied by Ex Committee's action of Tuesday
night.
After conferring with Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur at his
home last quarter and learning the necessity of changing student
government to conform with the four-quarter year and to en
courage enrollment in summer quarter, Ex Committee was faced
with the problem of what to do and how to do it.
The conclusions reached after careful thought, and what they
mean, are these:
1. Ex Committee is emphasizing summer quarter attendance
by having the new student body officers, to be elected in three
weeks, serve during summer quarter. If these officers choose
not to attend the summer session, alternates will be appointed
by Ex Committee for that period.
2. The second is the most important conclusion, in that the
student leaders wish to streamline all committees and de-empha
size activities as much as possible, in order to place added im
portance on scholarship and speedy completion of a three-year
college education.
Ex Committee, however, felt it could not proceed dogmati
cally to reorganize student government, which may require a
completely revised constitution, without consulting its constitu
ents. The committee therefore is attaching an amendment pro
posal in the coming election asking student body approval to
reorganize in whatever manner the committee deems advisable.
It must be understood, of course, that any such reorganiza
tion will be on a wartime basis and only for the duration, and
that after the war it will be up to future leaders and student bodies
to decide whether to revert in whole or in part to the present
constitution and student government system.
Anticipating hearty student approval of the reorganization
proposal, the committee has appointed a group of three to investi
gate all plans suggested, and report at next week's meeting.
What the final decision will be, no one can say, but it is certain
the need is obvious and it is also certain the change will be made
democratically but speedily.
Possible new systems of student government are (1) repre
sentation according to various Schools of the University, thereby
emphasizing academics more strongly, or (2) representation by
living groups, or (3) representation on a unit basis, corresponding
somewhat to the present class system.
Ex Committee is keeping faith with the students it represents;
the students are consequently urged to vote "Yes" on the com
ing wartime amendment proposal.

After conferring with Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur at his
home last quarter and learning the necessity of changing student
government to conform with the four-quarter year and to en
courage enrollment in summer quarter, Ex Committee was faced
with the problem of what to do and how to do it.
The conclusions reached after careful thought, and what they
mean, are these:
1. Ex Committee is emphasizing summer quarter attendance
by having the new student body officers, to be elected in three
weeks, serve during summer quarter. If these officers choose
not to attend the summer session, alternates will be appointed
by Ex Committee for that period.
2. The second is the most important conclusion, in that the
student leaders wish to streamline all committees and de-empha
size activities as much as possible, in order to place added im
portance on scholarship and speedy completion of a three-year
college education.
Ex Committee, however, felt it could not proceed dogmati
cally to reorganize student government, which may require a
completely revised constitution, without consulting its constitu
ents. The committee therefore is attaching an amendment pro
posal in the coming election asking student body approval to
reorganize in whatever manner the committee deems advisable.
It must be understood, of course, that any such reorganiza
tion will be on a wartime basis and only for the duration, and
that after the war it will be up to future leaders and student bodies
to decide whether to revert in whole or in part to the present
constitution and student government system.
Anticipating hearty student approval of the reorganization
proposal, the committee has appointed a group of three to investi
gate all plans suggested, and report at next week's meeting.
What the final decision will be, no one can say, but it is certain
the need is obvious and it is also certain the change will be made
democratically but speedily.
Possible new systems of student government are (1) repre
sentation according to various Schools of the University, thereby
emphasizing academics more strongly, or (2) representation by
living groups, or (3) representation on a unit basis, corresponding
somewhat to the present class system.
Ex Committee is keeping faith with the students it represents;
the students are consequently urged to vote "Yes" on the com
ing wartime amendment proposal.
(An Editorial)
Note: Executive Committee has authorized The Daily to
further present and interpret editorially its plans to solve
the election problem, something whjch could not be done
yesterday because of the necessity for objective news
presentation in the news columns, and due to deadline limi
tations of the editorial column.
Student concern over what the war and the resulting four
quarter system at Stanford will do to student government and,
more specifically, to the imminent spring elections of this quar
ter, should be satisfied by Ex Committee's action of Tuesday
night.
