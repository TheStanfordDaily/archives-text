# Dr. Blake Discusses Farm's Consumer Education Program
## 
### 
College students have a challenge to meet today in becoming a success
ful part of the present war program, Dr. Maybcllc Blake, field secretary of
the Office of Price Administration, declared yesterday afternoon in the
Education Auditorium in a lecture on "War and the Consumer," which
launched Stanford's consumer education program.

Dr. Blake went on to say that the
question is whether they will meet
this problem. So far students have
been doing their share by not only
learning how they can help during
the war, but also by learning how
they can help in the reconstruction
period which will follow.
The lecture was a part of Dr.
Blake's tour throughout the nation
in which she has been discussing
with faculties and students the war
problems in relation to the consumer
and the ways in which he can help.
Stating that she and her staff have
visited around 120 colleges to en
courage campus consumer pro
grams, Dr. Blake said that students
have been very anxious to know
how they can help during the war.
"We have been very prone to
hoard," she said, "since we know
there will be a shortage. We must
be willing to take substitutes. What
ever the substitutes are, we have
to be willing to accept them as our
part in the war program."

Students have comc to realize this
more and more, she continued, de
claring the one big thing college
students can do is to avoid waste.
Dr. Blake pointed out that Florida
University had saved over $3,600 on
electricity in one month.
Another way in which students
have been saving is by taking only
the food on a plate that they know
they can eat, thus avoiding food
waste. She stated that there will
probably not be a shortage of food,
"But we will not have the same va
riety."
A third way of saving has been
through not using automobiles,
which students have been doing vol
untarily throughout the country. In
, stead they have been walking, even
to dates.
Consumer committees are being
organized, Dr. Blake said, consisting
of faculty members and students
! who will lead in efforts at convcrsa-
I tion.

Consumer committees are being
organized, Dr. Blake said, consisting
of faculty members and students

College students have a challenge to meet today in becoming a success
ful part of the present war program, Dr. Maybcllc Blake, field secretary of
the Office of Price Administration, declared yesterday afternoon in the
Education Auditorium in a lecture on "War and the Consumer," which
launched Stanford's consumer education program.

Dr. Blake went on to say that the
question is whether they will meet
this problem. So far students have
been doing their share by not only
learning how they can help during
the war, but also by learning how
they can help in the reconstruction
period which will follow.
The lecture was a part of Dr.
Blake's tour throughout the nation
in which she has been discussing
with faculties and students the war
problems in relation to the consumer
and the ways in which he can help.
Stating that she and her staff have
visited around 120 colleges to en
courage campus consumer pro
grams, Dr. Blake said that students
have been very anxious to know
how they can help during the war.
"We have been very prone to
hoard," she said, "since we know
there will be a shortage. We must
be willing to take substitutes. What
ever the substitutes are, we have
to be willing to accept them as our
part in the war program."

Students have comc to realize this
more and more, she continued, de
claring the one big thing college
students can do is to avoid waste.
Dr. Blake pointed out that Florida
University had saved over $3,600 on
electricity in one month.
Another way in which students
have been saving is by taking only
the food on a plate that they know
they can eat, thus avoiding food
waste. She stated that there will
probably not be a shortage of food,
"But we will not have the same va
riety."
A third way of saving has been
through not using automobiles,
which students have been doing vol
untarily throughout the country. In
, stead they have been walking, even
to dates.
