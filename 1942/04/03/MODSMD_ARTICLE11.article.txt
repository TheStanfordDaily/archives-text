to Ed Porter, head of the salvage
division of Stanford's War Activi
ties.
Yesterday the collection truck
went out and visited the various
groups and met with "remarkable
success" in the amounts of junk
picked up. he said.
"We will make collections every
Thursday and Friday so that the
piles of stuff won't grow too high,"
Porter said.
The articles that arc most needed
are waste paper, old rags, scrap
metal, and old rubber, Porter said.
"How to save is almost as im
portant as the saving itself," Porter
said.

gestions in saving junk, Porter re
quested.

boxes and tic in separate bundles.
Keep dry and clean.
2. Pile newspapers separately and
tie in bundles.
3. Keep the rags, metals, and rub
