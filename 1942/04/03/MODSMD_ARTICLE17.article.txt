# Chapman Dies After Illness
## 
### 
Phil Chapman, sophomore Dolt,
died Saturday, March 21, at his
Pasadena home from cancer of the
jaw after being ill since Christmas
vacation. Funeral services were held
in Pasadena early this week.
After the disease had been diag
nosed by a San Francisco doctor,
Chapman flew to New York City,
where he underwent five operations.
He returned to Pasadena three weeks
ago and took radium treatment there
after spending six weeks at the New
York Memorial Hospital.
Dr. Hays Martin, specialist in tu
mor and cancer cases who performed
the operations, declared he had never
had a case like it. It was the only
one in medical history where the pa
tient. was as young as Chapman,
who was 19.
According to Professor Charles E.
Shcpard of the Men's Health Serv
ice, cvn though the disease was
diagnosed early there was little that
could be done as such cases are
nearly always fatal. He said that the
failure of radium treatment in this
case did not disprove its value in
treating other types of cancer.
