### 
Using the speech which Dr. Blake
made last Wednesday on "War and
the Consumer" as a springboard the
Stanford Consumer Conservation
Committee got under way yesterday
and laid plans to have a grand
launching next Wednesday.
"The main object of the program
is to make the students aware of the
different standards of living that the
war requires and the voluntary ra
tioning that should be done, George
Hellycr said.
The program will be officially
launched by a "Clean Your Plate
Day" next Wednesday, Hellycr said.
! "We want the students to realize
â–  how much they have now and to
look to the future."
Speakers will go to the various
houses and living groups and em
phasize the importance of the pro
gram, he stated.
