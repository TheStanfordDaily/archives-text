# Sir Stafford Arranges Conference After Receiving Congress Party's Rejection of Original British Plan
## 
### 
NhW DELHI, April 2 (UP). â€”The British War Cabinet has given Sir
Stafford Cripps a "free hand" to deal with India, it was learned tonight as
Japanese landings only 75 miles from the Indian frontier emphasized the
necessity of mobilizing this territory's teeming millions at once.
Cripps was said to have heen empowered to negotiate an agreement

for India's war support limited only
by "his own discretion."
There were indications he would
go a good deal further toward sat
isfying India's home-rule demands
than he has in the last 10 days of
talks in which he merely passed oil
proposals drafted in London.
COUNCIL TO MEET
Cripps also scheduled a "War
Council'' for tomorrow with Congress
and political leaders, including Sir
Archibald Wavell, in an attempt to
break the political deadlock holding
up full mobilization.
He arranged the conference after
receiving the Congress' flat rejection
of Britain's original plan for a post
war dominion status for India in ex
change for immediate full war sup
port.
The principal objection stated by
India's dominant political faction
was that Britain proposed to retain
full control of the territory's man
power and material resources for
the duration of the war.
NEW BASE PERIL
Cripps earlier was reported pre
pared to offer a compromise which
would allow an Indian minister to
direct recruiting, training and equip
ment of the Army. Tomorrow's Oort
ference, it was believed, will go more
fully into this proposal.
British spokesman indicated that
the Japanese landing at Akyab, Bur
mese port on the Bay of Bengal 75
miles from the Indian border and
320 miles east of Calcutta, has
heightened the urgency of Cripps'
mission.
