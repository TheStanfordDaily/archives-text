# First Aid Class Open to Men
## Regular Red Cross Certificates Offered 
### 
First Aid, Course 56 in the School
of Health, will now be available to a
greater number of men students.
The course is offered for 3 units Uni
versity credit but with no grade
points. The standard and advanced
Red Cross First Aid certificates will
be issued to those students who
satisfactorily complete the required
work.
Students are urged to take this
training because of the need here on
the campus and wherever they may
go for people with knowledge of
this subject. The four casualty sta
tions on the campus have to be
manned with sufficient numbers of
trained men in case of emergency.
This information is not only useful
in civilian defense work, but also in
everyday experiences.
The course is supervised by Dr.
B. Paul Davies. Practical instruc
tion will be given in sections by Mr.
Darrell Hblman, Mr. Glenn South,
Coach Clayton Frye, and Coach
Sherman Couch.
Registration may still be arranged
for the spring quarter with Dr. Da
vies in the Men's Health Service.
