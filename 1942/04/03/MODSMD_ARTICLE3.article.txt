# Stanford Drive For Con Home Gets Up Steam
## Joe Messina Heads Committee to Aid Unfortunate Kiddies 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
The Stanford Red is notably evi
denced in the hair ribbons and
sweaters of SO quick-to-laugh boys
and girls at the Convalescent Home.
Under the most modern scientific
care and enjoying the most pleasant
convalescent surroundings, these
four-to-twelve-year-olds are filled
with enthusiasm and hope, for they
arc getting well.
In the whole field of humanitar
ianism there is no finer monument
than this. Hopeless bed-bound cases
soon seen romping in the playground
will be a source of pride to Stanford
for as long as the Home exists. It
is also a source of distinction, since
Stanford is the only university any
where which maintains a charity on
its campus.
It. is supposedly from the room of
the old Stanford estate now serving
as the Con Home office that the
grief-stricken Mrs. Stanford looked
out and said, "The children of Cali
fornia shall be our children." Mrs.
Stanford could look out the same
windows today with gratification—
upon the modern buildings and
grounds of the "House of Healing."
CHILDREN GET SUN
"There have been arguments of
late as to why cities are built," Dr.
Wilbur said nine years ago in his
endowment-accepting speech. "But
for whatever purpose they were
built, one things is certain—they
were not built for children. It Ls
children above all who have a claim
to sunlit spaces, clear skies, and
healing airs."
This is what the Con Home chil
dren are getting, but would never
be able to get were it not for the
maintenance of such an institution.
Last year the Stanford drive pro
vided funds to endow four beds for
a year, and the students' work on
the grounds Labor Day saved a
great operating expense.
MESSINA LEADS DRIVE
The 1942 drive, under the leader
ship of Joe Messina, will get under
way with the Soph Carnival April 10
and will include the most event
crammed week of the Stanford year.
The traditional tournaments, jolly
ups, Strawberry Brunch, Tag Day,
Bean Day, B;ick to the Farm dance,
Labor Day, barbecue, and all the
other time-honored features arc on
schedule again this year.
Messina, officiating from behind
a table in the Old Union over an
appalling network of departments,
said, "Everything's geared up and
raring to go!"
