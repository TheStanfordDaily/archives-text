# Parkinson Praises Stamp Purchase
## 
### 
Over twenty dollars were given to
Stanford in defense stamps which
were sold at the Reg Dance last
Monday night, Ben Parkinson, chair
man of the affair, said yesterday.
Parkinson said that students out
did themselves by co-operating with
the added defense stamp entrance
fee by buying 25-cent stamps as well
as 10-cent ones, and voluntarily do
nating them to the University. He
also wished to thank the men who
sold the stamps giving their time
without compensation.
