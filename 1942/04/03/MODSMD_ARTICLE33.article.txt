# Japs, Chinese Confuse Farm
## Test Says Students Can't Tell Difference 
### 
I)r. Paul R. Farnsworth, associate
professor of psychology at the Farm,
has found that the average individual
cannot distinguish between a Japa
nese and a Chinese person.
The psychologist tested two groups
of 50 students each, showing every
student 56 photographs of Japs and
Chinese formerly enrolled at Stan
ford. The first group, with a chance
score of 28 possible, judged only 30.4
of the photographs properly, while
the second group did very little bet
ter, selecting only 31 pictures cor
rectly.
A short time later Dr. Farnsworth
tested the first group again after
having allowed it to read the cues !
which Life and Time gave for iden
tifying Chinese and Japanese. In this
second tabulation the first group
achieved a score of 31.6, only slightly
better than its first score. Mean
while the students of the second
group, who had not been allowed to
study the tips given by the maga
zines, again took the test and this j
time made a score of 31.1, almost
precisely what they had scored be
fore.
