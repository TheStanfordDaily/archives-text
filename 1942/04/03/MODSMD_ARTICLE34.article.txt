LONDON, April 2 (UP). —Scores of RAF' bombers, in one of (he heav
iest raids of their spring offensive, hurled tons of bombs upon Germany
and occupied-Europe last night and early today, centering on the Paris
suburb of Poissy where the Matford Works is turning out trucks for
the German army.

The operations, which included
mine-laying to help keep German
battleships bottled lip in port, and
attacks on western and northwest
ern Germany, cost the RAF 15
bombers—the heaviest toll since last
Nov. 7 when 37 planes failed to re
turn from a Berlin raid.
It brought the total cost of the
spring offensive, which began early
V,*st month, to (58 bombers—described
..a a cheap price for the amount of
damage thus far wrought among
Germanys' great industrial centers.
A preliminary Air Ministry sur
vey indicated that considerable
damage was done to the Matford
Works, 10 miles northwest of Paris,
where the British swooped down in
bright moonlight and unleashed
heavy loads of bombs on the factory

j which has been producing 20 trucks
