When Mrs. Stanford directed that
her jewels be sold and that the
money received from them be used
as a permanent endowment of the
University Library, she probably did
not realize that she was giving the
inspiration for the bookplate which
was to adoi'n the thousands of books
which her gift has enabled the
library to purchase.
The original drawing by Edwin
Howland Blanchfield, from which
the bookplates have been reproduced
is now on display in the rotunda of
the main library as a part of an ex
hibit which includes the bookplates
of many Stanford libraries and col
lections and of over 30 other Ameri
can university libraries.
