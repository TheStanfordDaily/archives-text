### CUES SAROYAN 
If the clouds don't develop into rain, Stanford's varsity nctmen will
start their drive for the southern division tennis championship when they
meet U.C.L.A. this afternoon and the powerful Southern California Trojans
tomorrow. Both matches will he held on the varsity courts, starting at 1
The Indians go into both matches heavy favorites, and ha,ve a chance
of sweeping the Bruins 9-0 and an +

equally good chance of taking their
first victory in many years from the
Trojans, by a lop-sided score. The
Trojans at present are leading the
conference with two wins and no
losses.
(leading the Indians in both
matches will be the d.vnamic Ted
Shroeder. In practice yesterday
Shroeder slashed the hall from
the baseline, was deadly with his
over-head, but netted some of his
volleys.
Today Shroeder meets Alex Gor
don of the Bruins for a warm-up
and tomorrow has his big match
with Ted Olewine, the Trojans' top
man and the nation's 11th ranking
singles player. Shroeder will have
to steady his game down if he is
going to whip Olewine, who re
turns balls like a back-board.
NEALE NO. 2 MAN
Number two for the Cards in both
matches will be Emery Neale, the
junior star from Portland who has
been sizzling hot in practice sessions.
Neale meets Sid White of the Bru
ins and should breeze through him,
but tomorrow he faces Bill Reedy of
the Trojans. Reedy is another steady,
hard-hitting Trojan, who is one of
the finest collegiate players on the
Coast.
Larry Dee will be lost to the In
dians for the Bruin match, and his
position will be filled by Jimmy
Wade who will battle with Georgie
Triester, one of the toughest of the
Bruins. Dee will be back for serv
ice against the Trojans and will
match strokes with Henry Zer
touche.
WADE VS. SWEET
The rest of the Indian singles men
against the Bruins will be Paul Wil
son, Ben Olsen and Tom Kruger.
Against the Trojans, Jimmy Wade
will face Don Sweet, Paul Wilson
will tangle with A1 Davenport and
Ben Olsen will face George Gates.
The Indians have finally landed
on what seems to be the right
doubles combinations, and will
throw three strong teams against the
Bruins and Trojans. On top will be
Dee and Shroeder, followed by Andy
Roberts and Neale, and the third
team is Wade and Chuck Hutchin
son. All three teams should win
their matches both days, unless
Coach Toley of the Trojans teams
Reedy and Olewine against our top
team and then it will be a toss-up.
