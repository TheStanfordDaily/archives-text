! ence "Rudy" Ruonavaara will prob
} ably be Coach Clint Evans' choice to
j start on the mound for the Bears.

] to midseason form.
PAPOOSE NINE
I SHADES BERKELEY, 5-4
Scoring five runs in the last two
innings, the Stanford freshman base
ball team defeated Berkely High
yesterday, 5-4.
Until the last two innings, Berke
j ley had the game sewed up, but right
then the frosh started rolling. Smith,
| Boswell, and Roinstad scored in the
sixth, and Mason and Boswell in the
j last.
Through the early part of the
game, pitcher "Doc" Mason did it
! all alone, and he did a good job.
It wasn't until Coach Harry Shipkey
started offering a coke for a hit that
the frash started hitting, but that
started the deluge of points.

innings, the Stanford freshman base
ball team defeated Berkely High

! all alone, and he did a good job.
It wasn't until Coach Harry Shipkey
started offering a coke for a hit that
the frash started hitting, but that
started the deluge of points.
