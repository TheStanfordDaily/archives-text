1A dark horses, U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.,
in matches Friday and Saturday
morning at 9 on the Farm links, the
matching opening 1942 play in the
Pacific Coast Conference Intercolle
giate golf competition.
Only two golfers from the south
ern state schools have ever played
against Stanford's 1942 squad mem
bers, and the amount of potential
ball-blasting ahility that will arrive
on the Farm is an unknwn quantity
that has Coach Eddie Twiggs count
ing caddies in his sleep.
PADDOCK DANGEROUS
Hal Paddock, diminutive U.S.C.
player, is the only visitor with a
top reputation. The Trojan lasted
until hole 19, round three in the
same national play-offs that brought
Stanford's Bud Brownell second
place ranking in the nation last sum
mer. The story goes that Brownell
could have had the crown on a
technicality in the last round but
refused. A replay of the final hole
turned out the wrong way for
Stanford.)
Lowell Robbins, heading a 10-man
U.C.L.A. aggregation, collected one
and one-half points in the invita
tional tourney here last year, leav
ing little impression among local
fans as being of any danger.
FARM FAVORED
Unless the many unknowns of the
two schools can match Stanford's
veteran assortment, the locals will be
of! to a fine start on their path toward
a second consecutive P.C.C. title.
George Traphagen is a sophomore
"find." Bob Barber transferred from
the University of Oregon and (his is
his first eligible quarter of play,

dent who has previously let inter
collegiate play strictly alone. This
trio completes the Cardinal roster.
