# Price of Your Life
## 
### 
THIS Easter Sunday in the churches of the
nation, the faithful, the frightened, and the
fashionable will gather together to kneel and
pray that the Prince of Peace again will grant
us peace —a victorious peace. For only from
victory, in the field and afterward, can Christian
peace come again to this earth.
It is not important whether we of today be
lieve that a Jew, called Jesus of Nazareth, did
actually rise up from Joseph's Tomb on a sunny
Sunday morning almost 2,000 years ago. We
cannot deny, with or without facts, that the
dynamic of Christian teaching created the moral
tenets on which Western civilization is founded.
Now, in our time, it is difficult to talk of faith.
We are too wise, too proud, too busy, too scien
tific, too cynical, too materialistic, for anything
so simple as a deep belief in the Christian ideal.
And yet, what are we fighting for?
Call it what you will, it still comes down to
the idea that man has a soul, great or small, and
that his State exists for him, not he for his State;
that he and his government operate together on
the principle that man has a right to be free, to
live, to believe; that there is good in kindness,
and that most men are good.
We may say the war is a world-wide skin
game—that we are fighting for our necks, for
capitalism, for the profiteers, for the status guo
—for anything at all, but The Right. Still, The
Eight is there somewhere down in the muck
and the politics, and the lying, and the pulling
and hauling.
And that Right just happens to be embodied
in the teachings of a man called Jesus, who
lived long ago and died on Calvary for what
he taught.
There is a reason why we should pray at
dawn in the Amphitheater, or at 11 o'clock in
the Chapel among the faithful, or the fright
ened, or the fashionable, though these are the
trappings, not the facts, of faith. You may be
strong enough to stand alone with your God.
You may believe in man's right to be a man
among men without labeling your belief. It's
your business. Certainly it is the business of
no other man. Not here. Not yet.
Few of us, however, are strong enough to
stand alone. On Easter Morning, in the churches
and on the mountain tops, there will be many
men and women. If we forget the fashionable,
and stand far from the frightened, we may find
the strength of the faithful.
Everything into which we were born, and
in which we have lived, depends upon our find
ing that faith somewhere, somehow. We say
that we'll win the war "when we get rolling,
when our production hits its peak, when we
get enough men into the field." That may be
true, but there is more to winning wars than
bringing our enemies to their knees. We
haven't even done that yet. They are winning.
And, as things stand now, we are losing. They
believe in their fight. We say that their kind
of belief is wrong and rotten. But they are
winning.
No matter how many guns, and how many
men, and how many tanks we throw against
them, we cannot win until we believe in the
right of the fight.
We must believe in the ideal we fight for, so
surely and so deeply that we value this ideal
above our lives. If we find the life we have
lived too dear to give, then we must sell it, for
a million lives and a million dreams a bargain.
At any rate, that life will never be ours again.—
Jean Nowell
