### AMIE REICHERT 
r pressure of public opinion for the British to
open a second front in Europe increases daily, as
Hitler's spring drive becomes more and more immi
nent and the whole picture becomes tense.
The Russians want the British to open a second
front in the West and so do the conquered peoples of
Eurojx; and so does the United States. And so do the
British people.
Whether the British War Cabinet decides to do it
or not, we shall see, but if they wait until Hitler has
launched his spring offensive into the Caucasus and
the Middle East, it will probably be too late.
There has been a lot of anti-British talk as a re
sult of the apparent slowness of the British. They
have stepped-up the R.A.F. raids over Western Eu
rope considerably in the past few weeks, but that is
about all.
Whether the criticism is justified or not, it is im
possible to tell at this distance. But it seems appar
ent that the British leaders of the war effort are faced
with a tremendous problem today as to the best, wis
est, way to win this war.
The hi# problem is a shortage of men and equip
ment, and it. is a problem not caused by the slowness
of British industry and production, but by the fact
that the British are fighting on so many fronts at once,
and it has now become a matter of deciding which
fronts must be yielded, which held onto. It seems im
possible that they can hold onto them all. *
♦ * * *
piRST of all, they have to keep their supply lines
open, and jjrobably the most vital of all these is
the Atlantic lifeline from the United States to Ice
land. Apparently most of our navy is in the Pacific,
which means that the gigantic task of defending the
Allied convoys from German U-boats and surface
raiders falls to the British navy.
They have to keep a sizeable force on the British
Isles themselves for defense against possible invasion.
They have to keej) men in Libya and Egypt to fight
Rommell and defend Suez. And men in Iraq and Syria
and Iran to fight in case of a German thrust to the
south.
They have to keejj an army in India in case of a
Japanese drive there, and men in Australia to ward off
invasion there. They are fighting in Burma at this
moment, and they were fighting all up and down the
Malay coast and in Hong Kong not so long ago.
They have forces in Malta and Gibraltar, and
probably in some other places I don't know about.
So they have their hands full. The big decision at
the moment probably is whether to open the second
front—say, through Norway, which would join their
lines with the Russians ultimately and squeeze Finland
out of the war—or to concentrate thir forces in the
Middle East either for purely defensive action there or
perhaps Tor an offensive against the Germans in south
ern Russia.

piRST of all, they have to keep their supply lines
open, and jjrobably the most vital of all these is
the Atlantic lifeline from the United States to Ice
land. Apparently most of our navy is in the Pacific,
which means that the gigantic task of defending the
Allied convoys from German U-boats and surface
raiders falls to the British navy.
They have to keep a sizeable force on the British
Isles themselves for defense against possible invasion.
They have to keej) men in Libya and Egypt to fight
Rommell and defend Suez. And men in Iraq and Syria
and Iran to fight in case of a German thrust to the
south.
They have to keejj an army in India in case of a
Japanese drive there, and men in Australia to ward off
invasion there. They are fighting in Burma at this
moment, and they were fighting all up and down the
Malay coast and in Hong Kong not so long ago.
They have forces in Malta and Gibraltar, and
probably in some other places I don't know about.
So they have their hands full. The big decision at
the moment probably is whether to open the second
front—say, through Norway, which would join their
lines with the Russians ultimately and squeeze Finland
out of the war—or to concentrate thir forces in the
Middle East either for purely defensive action there or
perhaps Tor an offensive against the Germans in south
ern Russia.
We shall see.
r pressure of public opinion for the British to
open a second front in Europe increases daily, as
Hitler's spring drive becomes more and more immi
nent and the whole picture becomes tense.
The Russians want the British to open a second
front in the West and so do the conquered peoples of
Eurojx; and so does the United States. And so do the
British people.
Whether the British War Cabinet decides to do it
or not, we shall see, but if they wait until Hitler has
launched his spring offensive into the Caucasus and
the Middle East, it will probably be too late.
There has been a lot of anti-British talk as a re
sult of the apparent slowness of the British. They
have stepped-up the R.A.F. raids over Western Eu
rope considerably in the past few weeks, but that is
about all.
Whether the criticism is justified or not, it is im
possible to tell at this distance. But it seems appar
ent that the British leaders of the war effort are faced
with a tremendous problem today as to the best, wis
est, way to win this war.
The hi# problem is a shortage of men and equip
ment, and it. is a problem not caused by the slowness
of British industry and production, but by the fact
that the British are fighting on so many fronts at once,
and it has now become a matter of deciding which
fronts must be yielded, which held onto. It seems im
possible that they can hold onto them all. *
