### MIKE CHURCHILL 
EASTER
r pODAY is Good Friday. That means that I shall
have to go to the closet, dust of! my suit, turn
the bottoms of my trousers under so that people won't
see the cuffs, and make ready to go forth with the
multitudes Sunday.
I have not yet made up my mind whether I will
go to the 8 a.m. service in the Amphitheater or wait
until 11. A lot will depend upon what happens Sat
urday night.
As the Carillon will be playing from 7 to 8 Sunday
morning I have already dismissed all ideas of sleop
during that period. That will be an added incentive
to get up for the early service.
Fashions have changed a lot of late. There is now
no question that the smart thing to wear this Easter
is either khaki or navy blue. This new trend makes
the question of whether there arc to be cuffs or not
seem very small.
If the Easter bunny wants to be good to us he can
change his shells to Ihe brass kind that fit in guns.
Yt/EDNESDAY was April Fool day. This prompted
some gentlemen to dream up a colossal gag in
volving lots of 8.M.0.C.'5. Playing in their vanity, and
don't you think that these fellows havent' it, the gag
sters phoned these guys and told them they repre
sented the Quad.
Tlie response was glowing. Yes, they could very
easily take the time to drop down to the Quad office
for a picture. Prominent students, eh, well thank you
very much.
Soon they gathered, 10 or 12 of them. The Quad
caught on, and not to waste opportunity, posed them in
a big V for Victory (or Vanity) shot.
