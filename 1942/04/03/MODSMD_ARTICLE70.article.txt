## LEAVE 'EM ALONE

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I submit the following:
Dear Mike: In re your Bull Session in The Daily
of April 2. Feeling the way you do about Stanford
women and their activities, why bother to write about
them? However, anyone who reads your article can
sec that you did realize the subject was beneath you,
and worthy of little, if any, thought. Why not leave
the whole mess to the women themselves—poor, mis
guided creatures? Let them stew in their own ineffi
ciencies and frivolities and don't worry too much about
them. They will muddle along somehow as they al
ways have. They just won't take advice thankfully
even from those, like yourself, best equipped to give
it. Stick to manly subjects, Mike, that are worthy of
your attention and don't waste your time on the hope
less and thankless.
Love. Christobel Pankhurst
