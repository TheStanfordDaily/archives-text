# Wilbur Expects Peace Offers
## Discusses Views On Vital Issue 
### 
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
told officers and men at the Hamilton
Airbase yesterday that the Japa
nese "would like to stop this war
right now and we may expect peace
overtures from many quarters be
fore the year is over."
Speaking in an "orientation" ses
sion sponsored by the War Depart
ment, Dr. Wilbur said Japanese fear
of U.S. production and of the vul
nerability of their own lengthening
supply lines will lead to the ex
pected peace overtures.
"They may not, however, be giv
en the opportunity to get out (of
the war), because the United States
and her Allies will fight to regain
all they have lost," Dr. Wilbur
added. "But before we can drive
them out, we must have overpow
ering air power," he concluded.
