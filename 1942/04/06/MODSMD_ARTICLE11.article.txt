# Lecturer Claims War Prisoners Not Starved
## 
### 
War prisoners aren't being starved and beaten. Dr. Darius A. Davis,
director of War Prisoners Aid Service of the Y.M.C.A., exploded all the
ories of cruelty in war camps in his discussion of "The Barbed Wire
Legion" last Friday evening.
Italian, German, British, Japanese, and American prisoners all receive
equal treatment through co-opera-^
tive carrying out of provisions of a t

treaty drawn up by the League of 1
Nations in 1929. Only the Russians, j
who didn't sign the treaty, are treat
ed on a different basis in Axis
countries.
FOOD SUFFICIENT
Using Germany as an example,
Dr. Davis pointed out that the food
the prisoners receive may not be
appetizing, but it is sufficient for
sustenance.
More important, however, than
food, are the steps being taken by I
the Y.W.C.A. and the Red Cross to I
keep up the morale of the prison
ers. By bringing necessary mate
rials to the camps, education
courses, music, art, religion, and the
theater all play an important part
in the prisoners' life after working
hours.
INTERNATIONAL SPIRIT
Dr. Davis finds Germany today
more international than she has ever
been because prisoners of all na
tionalities are now working side by
side with Germans.
Out of prison camps, says Dr.
Davis, came the new nations of the
last war, and there is a possibility
through continued efforts to help
build a new and better world after
this war. The prisoners by learning
to live one nationality with another
are building solidly toward peace.
