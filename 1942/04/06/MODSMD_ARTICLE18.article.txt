# Enemy Nets Small Gains on Bataan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 5 (UP). â€”
Japanese smashing by land and sea
at American-Filipino defenses on
Bataan Peninsula have succeeded in
"making some small gains," Lieut.
Gen. Jonathan Wainwright reported
today, but at a terrific cost which
included the sinking of a number of
troop-packed invasion barges.
As in three of the four previous
heavy assaults within the last eight
days, heaviest Japanese pressure
was brought on the right center of
Wainwright's line where the terrain
is comparatively level and the best
roads are available.
