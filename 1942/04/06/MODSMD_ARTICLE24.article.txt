# Powerful RAF Fighters Shoot Down 57 Japanese Planes in Ceylon Battle
## 
### 
COLOMBO, Ceylon, April 5 (UP).—Japan suffered
lier worst air defeat of the war today when tremen
dously reinforced RAF fighters shot down or dainnged
57 Nipponese planes attempting to launch the Battle
of Ceylon with a surprise X a.m. raid on this British
naval base.
(Colombo is 5,185 miles from Tokyo, the farthest
Japanese planes have operated from home bases. San

tFrancisco is 5,2.'i5 miles from Tokyo.)
! Apparently hoping to take Co
lombo by surprise, the Japs had the
I table turned on them when the RAF,
1 heavily reinforced in this area,
1 swept instantly into battle, strewing
the wrecks of raiders all over the
[ island.
BlCi STRIKING FORCE
It apparently was one of the big
gest striking forces the Japanese air
force has ever thrown at one ob
jective. Most were fighter planes,
which machine-gunned the harbor,
and dive-bombers.
(The German radio, heard by
United Press in New York, said that
75 planes participated in the attack.)
Immediately after the raid Gov.
Sir Andrew Caldecott announced the
"recent arrival of reinforcements
from all parts of the Empire" to de
fend this bastion dominating t.he
ship route between the Bay of Ben
gal and the Arabian Sea—the east-r
em approach to Suez.
FIRST CEYLON ATTACK
It was the first attack of the war
on Ceylon, an island about the size
of West Virginia lying off the south
ern tip of India, and like that on
Pearl Harbor, it shattered the calm
of an early Sunday morning.
Two areas of the city were at
tacked, suffering "comparatively
slight" damage, and there were said
to be a "small number" of civilian
casualties before British fighter
planes cleared the skies in a terrific
battle that raged over the island and
out to sea.
