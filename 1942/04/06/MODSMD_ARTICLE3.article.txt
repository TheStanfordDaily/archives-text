# Lagunita Rises Four Inchesâ€”Guess Why
## 
### 
The lake has risen about four
inches or so since last Friday
and would go even higher if
the opening at the far end of the
lake were not closed, according to
Head Lifeguard Boh Reynolds.
Meanwhile, the lake's polliwogs
and turtles arc keeping the life
guards company, although the
lifeguards are beginning to tire of
this society. When the sun again
comes out, the lake will be open
from 10 a.m. to (I p.m., excluding
the lunch hour. Reynolds also re
quested that all living groups ade
quately provide themselves with
paddles for their canoes.
