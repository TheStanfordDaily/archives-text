# Planes, Scenery Steal Show From Actors in Cagney Film
## 
### CYLONE COVEY 
"CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS,"
now playing at the Fox-Stanford in
Palo Alto.
Technicolor photography makes
"Captains of the Clouds." Airplanes
and Northwoods scenery steal the
show.
The little-tough-guy role in the
fast - moving, bush - pilot-to-Cana
dian-Air-Force plot is right up Cag
ney's alley, but it is Alan Hale whose
performance is outstanding.
Tying in such elements as a
Churchill broadcast and kilted bag
pipers, the second half of the picture
becomes engulfed in propaganda,
but not the revolting kind.
Once in a blue moon a picture
without stars or ballyhoo turns out

to be a hit. For slapstick comedy
(the fashion these days), second
billed "Obliging Lady" is one of the
best â€”as slapstick. It is snappy and
novel from the first "hyna-manush"
to the last.
