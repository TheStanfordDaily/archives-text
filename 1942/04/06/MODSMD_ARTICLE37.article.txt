# Footballers Start Spring Work Today
## 
### 
Upwards of GO men are expected
to report to head Coach Jim Law
son tiiis afternoon for Stanford's
initial spring practice workout.
There is a possibility that Stan
ford will have no frosh team next
fall if the B.A.C. acts 011 Law
son's recommendation that fresh
man football be restricted to one or
perhaps two games with the Uni
versity of California.
Lawson said Saturday that he is
against the adoption of the regular
frosh schedule for several reasons.
It is a known fact that Stanford
loses more freshmen during football
season than at any other time of the
year.
"We can save them by absorbing
them into the varsity football
squad," he said.
SCHEDULE IMPORTANT
Lawson added that he felt the
freshman schedule was as important
to the first year men as the varsity
schedule to the veterans.
"But some of them (freshmen)
haven't learned to study and they
flunk out trying to learn how and
play football at the same time," lie
added.
"If we took the freshmen on
the varsity squad there would he
several advantages. In the first
place, only four or five of them
would make the varsity traveling
squad if the conference permitted
freshmen to play," he continued.
EASIER ELIGIBILITY
As yet the conference has turned
thumbs down 011 allowing frosh to
compete 011 varsity teams, but
ireshmen are, however, eligible af
ter completing 3G quarter units of
work in school.
"In the second place," he went on,
"we could keep an eye on their
scholastic progress and tell them to
keep away from practice four or five
days until they got back into their
classroom work."
