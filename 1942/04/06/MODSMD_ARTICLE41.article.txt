week-end to meet the Trojans on
Friday and Saturday and the Bruins
Saturday afternoon.
INDIANS 'ALL AROUND'
The Indians showed tremendous
all-around strength in whipping the
Bruins by winning all their matches
except one in straight, sets. Ted
Shroeder, after a shaky start, got
used to the wind and the rain and
stopped Georgie Triester of the
Bruins, 6-2, 6-4. Emery Neale
played almost perfectly to drub Sid
White 6-1, 6-0. Jimmy Wade cut
down the Bruins' number three man,
Arnold Schwab, 6-3, 6-1.
Paul Wilson of the Cards got into
trouble and had to go three sets be
fore stopping Pratt of the Bruins,
6-2, 5-7, 6-2.
TEAM HAS DEPTH
Both Ben Olsen and Tommy Kru
ger, five and six for the Indians,
showed that the team would have
depth by winning their matches 0-0
and 2-0, respectively.
The number one doubles match
was cancelled because.of the rain.
The second and third Indian doubles
teams of Neale and Roberts and
Wade and Chuck Hutchison mowed
down both Bruin teams with pre
cision, dropping only one game lh
the four sets.
The postponed S.C. match will bo
sandwiched in between the regularly
scheduled Trojan and Bruin matches
in Los Angeles next weekend. Cali
fornia's varsity net team took on
both southern teams last Saturday
and defeated both by decisive mar
gins.
Stanford's 1942 tennis debut was
considerably marred by the week
end rains, but the Indians did find
time to show that they are the top
team in the southern division by
trouncing: the U.C.L.A. Bruins, 8-0,
on Friday. The scheduled match
with the Trojans on Saturday was
called off because of wet courts.
The victory over the Bruins,
coupled with the surprise win of
California over U.S.C., puts the In
dians on top of the conference race.
The Indians will travel south this
week-end to meet the Trojans on
Friday and Saturday and the Bruins
Saturday afternoon.
