# Baseballers Meet UCLA Tomorrow
## 
### 
There ain't gonna be no baseball
today, mclj be tomorrow.
Unfortunate week-end weather
havocked the sports card in general, I
and baseball went along with the
rest. Weather permitting, Harry
YVoltor's nine will tangle with U.C.- j
L.A. tomorrow 011 the Sunken Dia- I
mo nil at p.m.
The Card mentor had scheduled
a doubleheader with Southern Cali
fornia today in which the Trojans
were to meet the Indians and Santa j
Clara on the local turf, but a con- '
terence ruling killed that, sunshine
or not.
WILSON MAY THROW
Bill Wilson, latest addition to the
Cardinal throwing corps, is fast ,
getting his wing into condition. Af
ter the loss of Dale Snyder to the '
U.S. Marines, the Stanford pitching j
staff resembles a guy "swingin' on j
nothin'."
The return of Captain Boch Ca
ruso to practice and the appearance
of Howie Dal!mar should strength
en the club. Snyder, set to hurl his
last game against S.C. Friday, was
denied that chance when wet
grounds canceled the contest.
DIAMOND TOO WET
Neither Caruso nor Dallmar was
in shape to play in any of last week
end's games, but with the extra
conditioning both will have a good j
chance of showing their wares
against the Bruins.
Both Stanford and Santa Clara
were set to battle the league-leading
Trojans Saturday, but after frequent
inspections Coach Harry Wolter de
cided the diamond was unfit for
play. Santa Clara will play the
postponed game when they make
their Southern California trip. The 1
Stanford-U.S.C. tilt will not hfc
played unless the game will decide !
the league title.
