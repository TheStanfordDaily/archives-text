# Card Tracksters To Begin Season

Wednesday afternoon the long
awaited first local showing of the
varsity track team will come about
when the Indians meet San Jose's
strong team on Angell Field.
Since th track schedule for the rest
of the year is filled, the Olympic
Club meet, canceled last Saturday
due to a wet track, has not been
rescheduled. Norm Bright, former
Staniord distance man now run
ning for the club, came down from
Seattle last week for the meet and
is still on the campus. He will work
out with the team this afternoon.
The frosh trackmen won't appear
publicly until Saturday afternoon
when they face the Peninsula All-
Stars on Angell Field, while the
varsity is meeting Fresno State at
the Raisin City.
