### H. D. THOREAU 
has come to Stanford—bucket by bucket. I didn't necessarily be
lieve that spring had come last week just because Spring Quarter
gut under way. Spring fever for me was no indication, since I have it
continually throughout the year. Bast-ball bad started—maybe it was win
ter league ball. Easter week was upon us—maybe it came early this year.
But after seing it sprinkle every day for a three-day week-end, thereby
causing the cancellation for six athletic contests, then I knew that spring
had come to the Farm.
* * * *
MY GLASSES were splattered so badly during Friday afternoon's ten
nis matches that I never did find out who won, or even who was
playing; Saturday morning I fell into a river that now rages down the
first fairway at the ?olf course and by the time I had resuscitated, the golf

matches had long sirjee gone on their
way; I caroused around the athletic facili
ties of the Stanford campus for 45 minutes
Saturday afternoon seeing nothing but
dripping diamonds, clammy courts, and a
trickling track. I heard rumors that they
were going to hold the swimming meet
despite the mist, but that the pool was so
high you wouldn't be able to see what was
happening.
Just as I was about to give up hope of
ever seeing any more sporting events on
the Farm, what with the war and the
elements, I happened in on a cozy little
game at our fiat club with seven of the
best sports you'd ever hope to see tossing
their cards and money around in a very
sporting manner. But what is there to
say about that type of athletics . . . par
ticularly when you never see anything bet
ter than queens over sevens all after
noon.
* * *
CONNOLLY, writer of sports for
a metropolitan paper and long-time
favorite of Stanfordites, lipped off in his
column on Easter morn to the effect that
Stanford is always calling off scheduled
events to suit its whims. One of his two
specific claims was that Everett Dean
called off the proposed basketball game
with the Great Lakes Naval team, when
actually it was Dartmouth that put the
damper on the benefit game.
Connolly's other accusation was that

Boss-man Masters unjustly called off Saturday's track meet with the
O.C. and thereby caused the club men much inconvenience and ex
pense for naught. He indicated that they should run the meet off in
the mud and rain, thereby giving everybody a cold and ruining the
track for the rest of the season.

Adjacent to this deathless prose is
a mug of Cornelius Warmerdam,
lamed pole vaulter, who had to go
all the way from Piedmont to San
Francisco, Saturday, needlessly.
Dutch's picture isn't of any particu
lar importance as far as my treatise
on Mr. Connolly is concerned, but
whenever the reading public sees his
picture they read further thinking
that they might get a few pointers
on becoming the next world's cham
pion at vaulting with a pole.
To get back to Mr. Connolly, he
evidently didn't understand either
situation in question fully, because
he certainly wouldn't misrepre
sent the facts on purpose just to
show Stanford up in a bad
or would he?

() NE of the men to watch in the
coining spring grid practice is
Davy Robinson, transfer from the
University of Colorado. Robinson,
while playing for the Buffs, ac
quired the nickname "Squid" be
cause of his facility for oozing
through the line.

CONNOLLY, writer of sports for
a metropolitan paper and long-time
favorite of Stanfordites, lipped off in his
column on Easter morn to the effect that
Stanford is always calling off scheduled
events to suit its whims. One of his two
specific claims was that Everett Dean
called off the proposed basketball game
with the Great Lakes Naval team, when
actually it was Dartmouth that put the
damper on the benefit game.
Connolly's other accusation was that

Boss-man Masters unjustly called off Saturday's track meet with the
O.C. and thereby caused the club men much inconvenience and ex
pense for naught. He indicated that they should run the meet off in
the mud and rain, thereby giving everybody a cold and ruining the
track for the rest of the season.

Adjacent to this deathless prose is
a mug of Cornelius Warmerdam,
lamed pole vaulter, who had to go
all the way from Piedmont to San
Francisco, Saturday, needlessly.
Dutch's picture isn't of any particu
lar importance as far as my treatise
on Mr. Connolly is concerned, but
whenever the reading public sees his
picture they read further thinking
that they might get a few pointers
on becoming the next world's cham
pion at vaulting with a pole.
To get back to Mr. Connolly, he
evidently didn't understand either
situation in question fully, because
he certainly wouldn't misrepre
sent the facts on purpose just to
show Stanford up in a bad

CONNIE WARMERDAM
has come to Stanford—bucket by bucket. I didn't necessarily be
lieve that spring had come last week just because Spring Quarter
gut under way. Spring fever for me was no indication, since I have it
continually throughout the year. Bast-ball bad started—maybe it was win
ter league ball. Easter week was upon us—maybe it came early this year.
But after seing it sprinkle every day for a three-day week-end, thereby
causing the cancellation for six athletic contests, then I knew that spring
had come to the Farm.
* * * *
MY GLASSES were splattered so badly during Friday afternoon's ten

playing; Saturday morning I fell into a river that now rages down the
first fairway at the ?olf course and by the time I had resuscitated, the golf

matches had long sirjee gone on their
way; I caroused around the athletic facili
ties of the Stanford campus for 45 minutes
