### 
Stanford blazed into the lead in
| Pacific Coast Conference golf play
over the week-end as both U.S.C.
| and U.C.L.A. fell before a Farm team
j which should easily bring Coach Ed
die Twiggs his second consecutive
coast title.
In Friday's match with an impo
; tent Bruin squad, it was the usual
Brownell and company. The lanky
j second-ranking national collegiate
i golfer sloshed his way to a sub-par
! 69 in the afternoon doubles round
for the best score of the week, fol
lowing his par 70 of the morning
circuit. Both scores were lit Lie short
of miracles under a continual rain,
etc., which should have added at
least three strokes to his best game.
None of the other Stanfords —
Frank McCann, George Traphagen,
Pete Jones, Sandy Tatum, or Bob
Barber—had any difficulty in finish
j ing out the total score, Stanford 25-
U.C.L.A. 2. McCann claimed a 71
| on Friday for the second best scoring
honors.
Against the Trojans and consid
erable rain, the Farm team relaxed
slightly for a 21 -(> victory. Paddock
| of the Trojans was dropped to num
ber two spot on the roster, gaining
a win over Stanford's Mc-
Cann. All other local entrants came
out on top, with Brownell dropping
Harper 2-1 in the singles and
Brownell - Traphagen submerging
Harper-Paddock 3-0 in the doubles.
