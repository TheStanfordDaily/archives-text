# Row Victory

### 
TNTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL elected last
J. week its new officers for next year in the
first ballot to be run outside the Row caucus.
On the whole, the new method can be called
a success, and it looks as if it should continue
to function successfully in the future, with the
exception of one possible "bug."
To point out this "bug," in the hope of ex
terminating it, it is necessary briefly to outline
the old and new methods of Interfraternity elec
tions. It has previously been the accepted tech
nique to nominate the Row's favorite candidate
for Interfraternity president in the annual spring
caucus, the nominee usually being runner-up
as caucus candidate for the student body presi
dency.
This year Interfraternity beat the caucus to
the tape and elected its new officers before the
caucus had a chance to meet. Each house had
the opportunity to nominate two men, one for
president and one for secretary- treasurer.
Some houses, however, did not wish to nomi
nate anyone for either job, according to Inter
fraternity officers, either because they had no
capable men, or for "other reasons." This
"other reasons" business may turn out to be
the bug.
First, votes were held on names of all men
nominated for president and for secretary
treasurer, to narrow the choice, and in both the
presidential and secretary-treasurer elections a
man was chosen on the second ballot.
The fact that some houses did not nominate
any men out of their respective houses might
be construed to mean they either planned to
hold their political "nuggets" for the student
body elections, or planned not only to hold them
for these elections but also worked deals with
other houses, promising to vote for another
house's candidate in return for caucus and
election support in the larger student body elec
tions. It's a pretty sure bet this didn't happen
this year, however, because the fraternity men
were not informed there was to be an election
until the night before, at which time they were
notified to select their nominees. They prob
ably didn't have time to work any deals this
time.
It can be argued, however, that next year fra
ternity men can get together beforehand and
do their dealing in anticipation of having the
surprise elections sprung on them. This is an
admitted possibility, but the new system is an
improvement if for no better reason than that it
cushions the foul blow delivered by the caucus
system, because it eliminates the gobbling of
one of the top political plums. Also, 'holding
elections this early in spring quarter, the new
officers will have a chance to be trained by their
predecessors, rather than stepping into the job
cold.
Interfraternity has announced that in the event
its new leaders are not here summer quarter,
substitutes will be appointed to serve during
that period, since many houses are expected to
remain open, necessitating Interfraternity gov
ernment.
