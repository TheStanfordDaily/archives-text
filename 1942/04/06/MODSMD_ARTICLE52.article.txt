# Farm First Aid
## 
### 
THE School of Health announced last week
expansion of its First Aid course, making it
available to a greater number of men students,
and giving three units of University credit to
gether with standard and advanced Red Cross
First Aid certificates.
There is an immediate need which this course
will help satisfy. These men will be available
for service here at the four campus casualty
stations, and later wherever they may be called
for war work.
You'd think the ratio around here was 8 to
1, the way some of these sophomore sorority
women on 'phone duty handle the job.
