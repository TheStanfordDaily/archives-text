### AMIE REICHERT 
Yjf/ELL, they finally got William Dudley Pelley, the
" two-bit Fuehrer of North Carolina, and it's about
time. You remember him, of course. He's the little
man who dressed his thugs up in fancy silver shirts
and sent them around preaching Fascism and anti
semitism and probably raising a little hell with ne
groes and Jews, although no one has ever been able
to pin anything on him legally until now.
Praise the Lord for the Espionage Act of 1917 that
got William Dudley Pelley, because he was an ambi
tious man. William Dudley Pelley had plans. He
wanted to be king of the United States. He wanted
to lead a march on Washington and become the first
"white king" of the country. He wanted his Silver
shirts to take over the government, and two years ago
he told a House committee that he would have been
running the country if his organization had suc
ceeded in its efforts to wipe out" "subversive elements."
William Dudley Pelley obviously read too much,
too much Adolf Hitler and too much Father Coughlin.
It was his misfortune that he could not read the fu
ture in the roaring racing industrial output of this
nation and in the heroic resistance of the Red Army.
William Dudley Pelley couldn't read the handwriting
on the wall.

r PHE F. 8.1, has been doing good work. This is the
second time within a week that they have nailed
potential Fascist gauleiters in this country. The ar
rest of Noble and Jones last week shocked the nation,
which is a fine thing, and brought home the danger
of a fifth-column in the U.S. more clearly than the
thousands of warning words which have been writ
ten on the subject for years.
The Pelley case will make an even bigger splash
because William Dudley has a much prettier record
than the two California men. When the full history
of his activities and his plans is revealed it ought to
make a fat enough case against him to keep him quiet
tor a good long time.
