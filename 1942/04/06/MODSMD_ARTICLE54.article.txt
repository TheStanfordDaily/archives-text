# BULL SESSION
## NOW IT CAN BE TOLD 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
jyjY DEAR MISS CRISTOBEL PANKHURST, I am
indeed sorry if I offended you. It was never my
intention. You have indeed humbled me. You are no
doubt closely related to the Mrs. Pankhurst of Wom
en's Suffrage fame. It may even have been your aunt
that threw herself under the racing horses at Epsom
Downs in pre-World War I days to attract attention.
Mrs. Pankhurst is, I am sure, the ideal of every
member of Women's Conference. I apologize.
To show how you have reformed me I come to
men's affairs at once and print here a conversation
typical I am sure, that I overheard during last quar
ter's rushing.
"Hello, Charlie? Say, can we see you about eight?
Well then how about eight-thirty. Oh! you're busy
from seven-thirty to eleven, well make it eleven then,
outside Encina Store."

"Wonder where he is?"
"Getting out of that car that just pulled up. Hello,
Charlie."
"Hi, fellows. Sorry a little late, but you know the
Delts."
"Yeh, sure. Say Charlie, you're been up to the
house several times and the fellows seem to think
you'd really fit in. Have you thought much about it?"
"Well, of course you know I've pledged D.U."
"Oh, you have? Well, these early pledges aren't
official, and it really doesn't hurt anybody if you
break them, you know."
"I talked to my girl last night and she thinks I
ought to go your way."
"She does! Well, don't you think that a little out
side advice like this is helpful in these matters?"
"Sure, but my brother, he thinks you stink."
"You'll have to realize that families are so often
prejudiced, Charlie. My advice is to make up your
mind independently."

"Now. to get back to our house, Charlie. We had
a meeting last night and the fellows recommended
that you be given a bid, unanimous, too."
"Nice of them."
"You can't miss on this, Charlie. Just take a look
at the guys. Well rounded, see. Not too many ath
etcs, not too many activity men. Speedy Edwards
playing basketball, Coky Hamm and Bill McKcllar
on the football squad. Krotchy Lowe on Excom, guys
out for track, Cardinals, Rally Committee and the
band. It's the ideal set-up for you, Charlie."
"It sounds exactly like the Dekes."
"Maybe so, Charlie, but have they the class?"
"No, but the Chi Psis have all of that."
"Now look, Charlie, there's not much time left
and we can't hold this spot open for you indefinitely."
"Who asked you to?"
"That's really no attitude to take, Charlie. All you
have to do is sign this card right here and you'll be
in our pledge class,"
"How many have you in your pledge class."
"Well, we don't like to rush things but we have at
least five guys who have definitely promised to come
our way as soon as they give back their pins.
"Tell you what I'll do. See me Wednesday and I'll
give you a definite answer."
"0.K., Charlie. So long."
