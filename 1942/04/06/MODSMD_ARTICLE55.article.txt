DISCOVERY OF TIIE PHOTOSYNTIIETIC MAN

I am a dignified penny-pinchcr, an exponent of
THE PERFECT ECONOMY and BIOLOGY 11. These
factors have led me to a discovery that will shock the
scientific world, win me the Nobel Prize, glory eter
nal, or a bit of space in The Daily.
Delving into the affairs of the plant kingdom, I
came across the process of photosynthesis, a process
by which plants take energy from the sun and trans
form it into food energy, which we get in the form
of spinach. Now, I very skillfully deduced that if we
could transfer the properties of photosynthesis by
imitation of plants, to the human being, we could
utilize the energies of the sun directly to producing
food for our bodies.
0 brave new world! The production of, and supply
and demand for food will degenerate to nothingness.
Farmers and economics professors will be used for
shock troops. Eating would be left only to those who
live to eat (you know, co-eds). Can't you see it, a
future dinner date with a Stanford womanâ€”"Say.
Cutie, how about a 30-minute photosynthetic steak
out here on the grass.
1 have suffered for the illumination I have brought
to mankind. Every mail brings threatening letters
from sinister interests who will be ruined by my
discovery. Dentists will starve because no one will
care if their teeth fall out. Manufacturers of culinary
articles dog my footsteps. But undaunted I press on
ward! Success crown my efforts. Glory and immor
tality are mine!
