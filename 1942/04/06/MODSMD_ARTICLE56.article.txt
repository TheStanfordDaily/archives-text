# Lulu, Rest Home Cook, Says, 'I Like the Boys'
## 
### BILL STEIF 
Lulu was a little abashed. She didn't quite know what to say; and
then, it popped out and she said, "Why of course I like the boys, par
ticularly if they'll eat and clean up their trays."
It was Lulu Nohava, tbe Men's Rest Home cook, speaking in answer
to the question of what she thought of the Stanford men she feeds.

Lulu has only been cooking for
Mrs. Allen's Men's Rest Home dur
ing the last three years, but in that
comparatively brief time she has es
tablished herself as a fixture amongst
members of the Stanford family.
FARM INHERITS LULU
As a matter of fact, Lulu had been
indirectly related to Stanford for the
12 years previous to her coming to
the Rest Home, for in 1927, after
her husband died. Lulu had gone to
work for Mrs. Allen's mother, and
upon the death of Mrs. Allen's
mother, Mrs. Allen had naturally in
herited Lulu for the Rest Home.
Of medium height, with curly
brown hair and twinkling, kind eyes,
Lulu feeds all Stanford men who
are interned in the Rest Home and,
in addition, feeds the tableful of
Farm men who eat at the Rest Home
regularly.
Oftentimes, when she thinks that
one of "her boys" is not eating
enough at the Rest Home table, she
will bring him out to her kitchen
fortress and find out just what he
would like to eat. Whereupon the
next meal usually includes the de
sired item.
lIEART-OF-GOLD LU'
Those that have spent any time
at the Rest Home are especially ad
dicted to Lulu's "Raised Rolls" and
"Shepherd Pie," and whenever an
old Rest Home inmate returns on a
purely social call, he almost in
variably asks for "Heart-of-Gold
Lu."
Mrs. Allen, Lulu's ebullient chief,
says of Lu's cooking, "It's hard to
pick out anything especially good
because it's all so good."
And Lulu, herself, says of her
work, "I just love it." Which, per
haps, accounts for the fact that the
Men's Rest Home is reputed to have
some of the best food on campus.
