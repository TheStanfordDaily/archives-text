# Indoor Egg Hunt Given In Con Home
## Chi O's Play Easter Runny, Bring Delight To Convalescing Kids 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
Easter morning weather failed to
dampen the Con Home kids' delight
when the annual Chi Omega Easter
egg hunt had to he held indoors
yesterday.
Forty fashionably-decked Chi O's
went from ward to ward of the Hoine
taking with them colored eggs and
Christmas spirit. Their smiles and
the kids' gJee provided heart appeal
of both varieties.
This occasion, usually a bona fide
hunt on the grounds, is one of the
big events of the Con Home year,
and one of the big factors in the
recoveries continually recurring.
ATMOSPHERE LIGHT
The children, 40 boys and 40 girls,
are convalescing from afflictions
ranging from asthma to infantile
paralysis. But the usual depressed
atmosphere of such institutions is
strikingly absent here. The patients
are not wan and drawn. They
laugh; they are curious; and they
are getting well.
Birthday, Christmas, Hallowe'n,
and Fourth of July parties are other
big events of the Con Home year.
When a child has a bii'thday, he is
given a present of his own choosing,
and the whole population holds a
community party in the Doll House,
a miniature building donated in
honor of a former girl patient.
The children are also entertained
twice annually by puppet shows of
the San Francisco Junior League.
And magicians and various other
performers occasionally visit and put
on their acts.
LABOR DAY BIG
But probably the biggest event of
the Con Home year is the Stanford
Labor Day, when great numbers
from the campus dress down the
Home grounds and then hold a bar
becue on the hillside.
What the kids like best on that
day is the red-and-white uniformed
Stanford band. Transactions are now
under way to make sure the band
is intact for the convalescents again
this year.

The children are also entertained
twice annually by puppet shows of
the San Francisco Junior League.
And magicians and various other
performers occasionally visit and put
on their acts.
LABOR DAY BIG
But probably the biggest event of
the Con Home year is the Stanford
Labor Day, when great numbers
from the campus dress down the
Home grounds and then hold a bar
becue on the hillside.
What the kids like best on that
day is the red-and-white uniformed
Stanford band. Transactions are now
under way to make sure the band
is intact for the convalescents again
this year.
