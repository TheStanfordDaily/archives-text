# Russ Fight Hits Titanic Proportions
## Almost 500 Planes Downed in One Week Of Bitter Air War 
### 
LONDON, Tucs., April 7 (UP).â€”
A Red Army communique reporting
that the air war over the Russian
front had surged up to titanic pro
portions said today that 405 Ger
man and 84 Soviet planes were de
stroyed in the eight days ending
Sunday.
The communique broadcast from
Moscow said 10!) German planes
were shot down or destroyed
aground Sunday with 17 Red air
force losses. The Germans lost 296
planes and the Russians 67 in the
period of March 29 through April 4,
it said. (Berlin broadcasts gave sup
porting evidence to the Moscow re
ports.)
PINCERS CLOSING
On Saturday and Sunday alone,
according to Soviet communiques,
the Russians amassed a two-day bag
of 211 German planes while losing
only 33.
Earlier dispatches from Kuibyshev
said the latest Red Army successes
on the central front, where a Soviet
pincers maneuver was closing in
from north and south, had "deeply
aggravated" the German positions at
Smolensk, Vyazma and Gzhatsk.
RESERVES ANNIHILATED
The same sources said the gradual
annihilation of the German spring
reserves thrown prematurely into
the battle of the Ukraine in an ef
fort to stem the advance of Marshal
Semyon Timoshenko's army may
have shattered permanently Adolf
Hitler's hopes of breaking through
to the Caucasian oil fields.
The sixth and seventeenth German
Armies were said to have lost all of
their spring reserves in desperate at
tempts to save their fortified winter
