### 
SACRAMENTO. April f> (UP).â€”
Governor Culbert Olson tonight re
quested all California sheriffs and
police chiefs to notify holders of li
censes to sell firearms that hence
forth no sales may be made to aliens.
In addition to the usual record of
sale required under the California
dangerous weapons control law, pur
chasers of firearms must make a
statement showing the necessity for
the weapons, Olson said.
