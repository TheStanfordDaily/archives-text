# Academic Records Evince Wartime High-Low Trend In Winter Quarter Poll
## Scholarship Committee Announces Varied Lower Division Standings Reflect Present War Atmosphere 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Itoac.lion Stanford student lo war conditions, as indicated l>y h4<
academic standing, shows simultaneously the best and the worst scholas
tic record in six years, according to a report released yesterday by Miv.
Olivia Byler, secretary of the Committee on Scholarship.
A six-year high in "flunk-outs" was reached last quarter, with 7<i

Lower Division students were dis
qualified in winter quarter of 1941.
Conversely, the report showed that
229 freshmen and sophomores were
on probation at the end of winter
quarter, 1941, as compared to 14i»
on probation at the end of the quar
ter just past.
Members of the Committee on
Scholarship yesterday expressed
themselves as convinced that the
scholarship trend on the whole was
upward.
SCHOLARSHIP LP
"As a whole, 1 don't think schol
arship is down at all"—Registrar
J. P. Mitchell.
"They've pulled in their belts as
we expected them to"—Dean Marv
Yost.
"The greater acceleration is up"—
Dean John Bunn.
"I think," Dr. Mitchell said, "that
the Stanford community has reacted
under pressure in much the same
as any other community would have.
Some people dig in and go to work
when the pressure's on. Others just
can't take it."
LOWER DIVISION ONLY
Since the Committee on Scholar
ship deals with Lower Division stu
dents only, the over-all scholarship
picture will not be available until
the end of the year.
The sharp rise in winter disquali
fications is traceable directly to the
taen, according to Dean Yost and
Dean Bunn. Fifty-five men, 30 of
whom lived in Encina, flunked out
last quarter. The winter quarter
previous, 31 men, 11 of whom lived
in Encina, were disqualified. In the
same two winter quarters, the wom
en s disqualifications dropped from
10 to 7.
On the strong side of the ledger,
Dean Bunn pointed out that there
are now 15 straight-A students in
Encina, as opposed to last year's 6.
No comparable figures for Roble
were available, but Dean Yofft point
ed out that there were 24 straight-A
women students last fall quarter and
21 winter quarter.
EXTRA UNITS NOW
Neither are figures available at
present on just how many students
are carrying 18 or more units, since
those with B-averages need not pe
tition to do so; but, according to Dr.
Mitchell, "many more than ever
before arc carrying the extra load,
and getting B's, too."
Specific tallies for Roble and En
cina revealed that 51 freshman men
and 108 freshman women did better
academically during winter quarter
than they did in the fall. Seventy
five freshman men and 69 freshman
women dropped five points or more
below their fall quarter averages.
BUCK INVESTIGATES
Dr. Philip Buck, who with the two
deans investigated the lower division
disqualifications, declared yester
day:
"My own impression is that the
general disqualification reflects dis
turbance and unsettlement due to
the world situation. Some students,
I think, arc genuinely upset. Some
of them are cashing in on a good
alibi."
