Want to sec the original <if Stanford's Jewel Fund bookplate, the one
that stares you in the face every time you open a hook from the library.?
Artist Edwin How land lilashficld's charcoal drawing is the feature of this
week's exhibit of college bookplates in the .Main Library. The Hoover
Library, meanwhile, is showing collections of British and American Civil-

ian Defense Publications. „
Two display cases in the Hoover
Library are given over to official
British government publications, in
cluding ARP leaflets, instructions on
how to build air raid shelters, direc
tions for handling incendiary bombs,
and several pamphlets on precau
tions to be taken in case of gas at
tack.
OCD PAMPHLETS
Strangely mirroring the older pub
lications are those turned out by
the American Office of Civilian De
fense on air raid shelter-building
and bomb control. Also on exhibit
are the official manuals for those
engaged in civilian war work—air
raid wardens, auxiliary fire wardens,
airplane watchers—together with the
insignia of their various jobs. A va
riety of victory posters are exhib
ited on the bulletin board in the
East Room.
Bookplates from 25 colleges and
universities in the United States and
Canada make up the exhibit in the
main library. Yale, Harvard, Prince
ton, Columbia, several state univer
sities, and McGill University in
Canada are represented.
SPECIAL PLATES
In the cases on each side of the
steps are the plates of Stanford's
special collections, where those who
have never seen a book from the

Felton Library may at least see
something out of one. Besides the
Law Library, the Hopkins Trans
portation Library, and the Robinson
Collection, there are plates from
the Greenland Library, the Chinese
Collection, and various special do
nations.
