# Pitch Praises Pole Vaulters
## 
### 
For Ihc first time in ten years
Stanford trackmen have an excellent
chance to take Dean Cromwell in
his favorite event, the pole vault.
From 1932 to the present such
Trojans as Bill Graber, Earl Mead
ows. Bill Sefton, Kenny Dills, or
Loring Day h;ive monopolized first
place pole vault points, "but this
year," said Coach Pitch Johnson,
"Stanford's chances look very good."
TOM ASO MAY WIN
Johnson pointed out that both Ed
Tomaso and Russ Peck, Card vault
ers, are quite capable of feoing 14
feet and higher.
"Tomaso has the physical equip
ment to go at least 14.(5, if he would
only get his step down. He has the
muscles, the height, the push, and
he can easily develop the speed and
timing co-ordination; all he must do
is correct that one fault."
PECK POTENTIAL
Peck, likewise, is another poten
tial 14-foot pole vaulter. "Although
he is naturally heavy and is about
3 or 4 inches too short, Peck is a
natural vaulter. He has wonderful
co-ordination, and is a good com
petitor. His one great handicap is a
leg condition which appears to be a
dislocation and won't permit him to
do all the work he needs to develop
better co-ordination." He has done
13. G this season.
SCHAEFFER TO JUMP
U.S.C.'s leading vaulter, Bill
Schaeffer, defeated Warmerdam last
year in the Los Angeles Relays by
clearing 14,6. However, he hasn't
gone much over 14 feet ever since.
If Tomaso corrects his steps on the
runway, and if Peck's leg condition
is corrected "the Venerable Dean"
may be beaten at his own game.
