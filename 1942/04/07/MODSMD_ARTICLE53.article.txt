Having backed the Pittsburgh Pi
rates (known as the Pits in the
heat of the pennant fight) for nine
years, we can see no reason for get
ting off the bandwagon this season.
Anyone who still roots for Pitts
burgh after that terrific flop a couple
of years back (when the boys had a
six- or seven-game lead with about
ten days to go, and blew it to the
Cubs) can afford to stay behind
Frank Frisch's beys during the com
ing campaign.
The Pirates are the boys. The
odds are good and Frisch is a
fighter. Bob Elliot looks fine at third
base. We saw him almost tear Elbie
Fletcher's hand off with one par
ticular peg two weeks ago. He has
been rattling the boards consistently
this spring.
Vince DiMaggio is a holy terror
with the mace in a clutch. He was
fourth in RBI last season and hit 23
homers. His fielding and base-run
ning have endeared him to Smoky
City fans forever.
And John Barrett is making things
hot for Jim Wasdell with a near
.4oo average in the Grapefruit
League. Van Robays is a good
journeyman gardener.
As you all know, Coscarart is a
new man at the plate and is a much
better fielder than Vaughn. Lopez,
a clutch hitter, does the catching and
Frisch has a dandy littLe hurling
corps headed by Rip Scwell, Dutch
Diet/., Kan Hemtzelman, and Hank
Gornicki, the Card cast-off.
We watched Pittsburgh last sum
mer, in one night game at Brooklyn
especially. That night, who is
supposed to be good under the lights,
look a terrific beating. Vince DiMag
lined one foul by 3 feet into the up
per deck, followed with the real
thing, good for three runs. His room
mate, Lopez, greeted the relief
chucker with another four-ply wal
lop and then old Mace Brown threw
the ball over Camilli's head to make
it complete. Two months later the
Bucs were hottest in the circuit.
Yep, the Pirates are all right.
We're staying with 'em.
