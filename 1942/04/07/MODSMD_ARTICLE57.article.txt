THERE is a popular story running rampant in
this country about the Englishman, Dutch
man, Frenchman, and Greek who were flying
toward England in a crippled plane. To lighten
the load and save the plane, advised the pilot,
some people would have to jump. The French
man and the Dutchman promptly jumped out
saying, "For our countries!"
But the plane still faltered, and the pilot an
nounced that it was necessary for one more
man to jump. The Englishman is supposed to
have gotten up and said solemnly, "For Eng
land!" as he pushed'the Greek overboard.
Many of our know-it-alls and tea haters have
repeated this and similar stories to blast our
biggest and most powerful ally. Whether or not
these yarns are brainstorms of German propa
gandists is not important. What matters is the
fact that they are dangerous.
As it is, the mental attitude of the American
people toward the war has been rather wishy
washy without the help of strong stimulants fur
nished by enemies of the American cause—
for people who spread such stories are true ene
mies of our country.
Why not stop and think about the following
facts released by the British Ministry of Infor
mation? They could be called. Allied propa
ganda, but they are worth considering. To Dec.
31, 1941, 71.3 per cent of British Commonwealth
casualties (both dead and wounded) were Uni
ted Kingdom troops from England, Scotland, and
North Ireland; 18.2 per cent were Dominion
troops; and the remainder came from India and
the colonies.
The British are definitely not letting the other
countries fight the war. They have been in it
up to their necks for almost three weary years.
Now that they have the support of the United
States, China, the Netherlands, and most of the
South American countries, they have renewed
hope.
It takes more than words to get a country
fighting mad. It takes facts, dead brothers,
fathers, sons, and friends. We have to think
what an Axis victory would mean. Before this
war can be won, we will have to change our
entire mental outlook. It will take action—not
cute little stories about the "lazy British."—John
