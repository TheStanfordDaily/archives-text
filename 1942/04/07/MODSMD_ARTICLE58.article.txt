# Why Thornton Resigned
## 
### 
THERE should be no misunderstanding con
cerning the resignation of Nort Thornton,
Stanford's swimming and water polo coach for
eleven years, and the second coach to leave
Stanford this quarter. There was no dispute be
tween Nort and the Board of Athletic Control
over coaching techniques, nor were there other
extenuating circumstances; not that such has
been reported, but it is well to make the point
clear.
He resigned because he, along with several
other coaches of minor sports, were informed
recently by the B.A.C. that necessary wartime
economy measures make renewal of their con
tracts for next year uncertain, and that it might
be well to consider any other offers which come
their way.
The reason for this action, of course, is ex
pected limitation of crowds at next fall's football
games, source of revenue for Stanford athletic
operations. The B.A.C. is to be commended for
playing fair with the coaches it feels it may
no longer be able to retain, by telling them far
enough in advance so they may accept other
positions if they choose to do so. In addition,
the BA.C.'s action is not to be interpreted to
mean it will curtail sports at a time when physi
cal fitness is especially necessary. Remaining
coaches will be asked to double up on assign
ments, or student coaches, proficient in their re
spective sports, will be appointed to fill in.
Nort, of course, is looking forward to a real
future in the life work for which he has pre
pared, that of teaching political science. He has
an M.A. in that subject, and also has the re
quired teaching credentials for public school
work.
Stanford owes Nort sincere gratitude for the
many outstanding teams, records, and cham
pionships he has produced during his time on
the Farm, and for the development of many
athletes of stellar individual accomplishments.
