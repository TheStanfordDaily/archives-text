### AMIE REICHERT 
IVIY BOY HIRO and I were sitting on the foxhole
that day when the Sukiyaki-12's and their accom
panying pursuit ships, the Saki-7's roared over Ba
taan. Hiro is my little fifth-columnist (he writes for
me every five days) so he had known they were com
ing three days in advance.
He told me about this in plenty of time, so we got
into the foxhole and took the typewriter with us and
waited to see what would happen.
Well, sir, the Sukikayi-12's and their accompanying
pursuit ships, the plucky little Saki-7's, roared over
Bataan and all the men jumped into all the foxholes
and threw all tfye little foxes out. Then we held our
breaths and waited to see what would happen.
Well, sir, the planes roared over Bataan that day
and we waited for them to drop their deadly loads and
blast us all to eternity. You can well imagine our
surprise when instead of dropping bombs they drop
ped beer cans.
Yes, sir, American beer cans they were, with col
ored streamers attached. The men yelled wildly.
"Beer! Beer!" they yelled. They ran out to get some,
but I stayed in my foxhole. However, I did let Hiro,
the little devil, go out and snag three or four.
"Hiro, my hero!" I breathed as he came running
to me, his fat little fingers clutching the keg-lined
cans.
Well, sir, you can well imagine our surprise when
we found that the bottles were empty, dry, vacuous.
(I had thought we were well outside the three-mile
limit, but until that moment I wasn't sure, having lost
my sextant the previous night in the blackout.)
Then the men were really angry and they cursed
the yellow men and vowed to destroy them. No
spirits, you say? Yes, but such spirit. Unbelievable
it was that day at Bataan. The foxholes rang with
it.
* * # *
Vkf/HILE up above the Sukiyaki-12's and their faith
ful little Saki-7's cavorted about in the blue do
ing the prettiest, friendliest Immelmans and lazy-eights,
and dipping their wings in greeting.
Then a shout arose from the third foxhole to the
left of me. The men had discovered a message in the
empty cans!
Well, sir, you can well imagine the profound effect
this had on all concerned. We hastily inspected our
cans to see if there were any messages within and suie
enough, there they were.
"Honable Amelicans:" it said, "Please to give up
ghost of Bataan. Mac Arthur velly smart man. He go
when going oh so good. Now, you go too. If not, you
be so sorry prease.
Love, Yum Yum Yamashita"
Well, sir, of course our men scorned the low sug
gestion. We recognized the peace offensive for what
it was immediately, and fired on the Sukiyaki-12's
and their etc., etc., but they got away.
All that night and the next day we waited but no
sound, not even the whir of a Saki-7 broke the deadly
stillness of our foxhole fortress.
And then on Easter Sunday they came. The big
all-out attack was on. That was where Hiro and I left.

Well, sir, of course our men scorned the low sug
gestion. We recognized the peace offensive for what
it was immediately, and fired on the Sukiyaki-12's
and their etc., etc., but they got away.
All that night and the next day we waited but no
sound, not even the whir of a Saki-7 broke the deadly
stillness of our foxhole fortress.
And then on Easter Sunday they came. The big
all-out attack was on. That was where Hiro and I left.
IVIY BOY HIRO and I were sitting on the foxhole
that day when the Sukiyaki-12's and their accom
panying pursuit ships, the Saki-7's roared over Ba
taan. Hiro is my little fifth-columnist (he writes for
me every five days) so he had known they were com
ing three days in advance.
He told me about this in plenty of time, so we got
into the foxhole and took the typewriter with us and
waited to see what would happen.
Well, sir, the Sukikayi-12's and their accompanying
pursuit ships, the plucky little Saki-7's, roared over
Bataan and all the men jumped into all the foxholes
and threw all tfye little foxes out. Then we held our
breaths and waited to see what would happen.
Well, sir, the planes roared over Bataan that day
and we waited for them to drop their deadly loads and
blast us all to eternity. You can well imagine our
surprise when instead of dropping bombs they drop
ped beer cans.
Yes, sir, American beer cans they were, with col
ored streamers attached. The men yelled wildly.
"Beer! Beer!" they yelled. They ran out to get some,
but I stayed in my foxhole. However, I did let Hiro,
the little devil, go out and snag three or four.
"Hiro, my hero!" I breathed as he came running
to me, his fat little fingers clutching the keg-lined
cans.
Well, sir, you can well imagine our surprise when
we found that the bottles were empty, dry, vacuous.
(I had thought we were well outside the three-mile
limit, but until that moment I wasn't sure, having lost
my sextant the previous night in the blackout.)
Then the men were really angry and they cursed
the yellow men and vowed to destroy them. No
spirits, you say? Yes, but such spirit. Unbelievable
it was that day at Bataan. The foxholes rang with
it.
* * # *
Vkf/HILE up above the Sukiyaki-12's and their faith
ful little Saki-7's cavorted about in the blue do
ing the prettiest, friendliest Immelmans and lazy-eights,
and dipping their wings in greeting.
Then a shout arose from the third foxhole to the
left of me. The men had discovered a message in the
empty cans!
Well, sir, you can well imagine the profound effect
this had on all concerned. We hastily inspected our
cans to see if there were any messages within and suie
enough, there they were.
"Honable Amelicans:" it said, "Please to give up
