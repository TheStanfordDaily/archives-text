# 'Let's Lick Our Platters Clean'
## Campus Drive Aims At Less Food Waste 
### 
"Clean Your Plate Day" on Wed
nesday starts a campus-wide pro
gram for better nutrition and less
wasted food. Emphasizing that ev
erything used by a Stanford con
sumer means the loss of that amount
to the armed forces, a loss in raw
materials, transportation, skilled la
bor and machinery, speakers will
talk to each living group at lunch
or dinner Wednesday.
Suggested ways of reducing food
waste, especially important in the
smaller eating groups, arc serving
butter and vegetables family style
and buying in larger quantities.
An important part of defense is
better nutrition. For better health,
"It is as important to eat something
of everything on your plate as to
clear your plate," stated Miss Chris
tine Ricker, director of dining halls.
"A change is needed in the indi
vidual's attitude of mind. It is an in
dividual problem, depending on in
dividual education."
