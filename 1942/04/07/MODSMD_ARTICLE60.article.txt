# BULL SESSION
## FUN ON CAMPUS 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
a date tonight? Looking for something to do?
If you want to stay on campus there are at least
two free shows that I can recommend.
At 7:15 Excom will hold its regular weekly meeting.
Democratically, the student public is invited. While
space is limited in the Excom room, I have every as
surance that if the crowds warrant it, Excom will
move to the little theater.
Although he has been ill, Mr. George Jackson is
again expected to play the lead in tonight's perform
ance. Kind, fatherly Mr. Jackson is deserving of credit.
Playing opposite Miss Pat Adams, who is currently
cast as the ingenue, his is a difficult task, for never
must he seem to take advantage of her but always
direct her efforts to the highest goal.
Miss Adams' part is a psychological problem. She
is harassed by a gnawing desire to be an Invisible
Scarlett O'Hara and eliminate all duplication or sub
terfuge in the forming of committees.
Ralph Clark, who in ordinary life is business man
ager of the Quad, is the Bob Hope of the cast. Almost
oblivious of what is going on, he is constantly mur
muring sly innuendos and back-page Chappie jokes.
The Inquiring Reporter is played by Daily Editor
Hal Shafer. Man of affairs and worldly-wise, he lends
a metropolitan touch to the production. Opposite him
Miss Nancy Burkett is currently starring in the ro
mantic lead. She plays her part very ably, and when
she murmurs "I second the motion" with husky voice
and lowered eyelids, she sometimes has the true Bern
hardt catch.
Jim McKellar plays the part of the able, moneyed
financier. With the acumen of a Dick Tracy, he time
and again spots the corrupt trickeries of the hosts of
bandits posing as treasurers of various campus clubs
and organizations.
The juvenile leads are played by Peggy Boothe and
Dick Driscoll. This Rooney-Garland team portrays
the fun-loving, rosy-cheeked college boy and girl.
They have the efficiency of youth and will be found to
be a refreshing combination.
Excom is even better than Buck Rogers and it
comes every week.

'"pHE other attraction for tonight is the lecture "Fun
with Birds," given by T. E. Reynolds. I have ab
solutely no idea what Mr. Reynolds will talk about,
but I am a fool for anything with a title like "Fun
with Birds." You cau't miss on this.
Rcrnember, Fun with Excom at 7:15 and Fun with
Birds at 7:30.

Excom is even better than Buck Rogers and it
comes every week.

'"pHE other attraction for tonight is the lecture "Fun
with Birds," given by T. E. Reynolds. I have ab
solutely no idea what Mr. Reynolds will talk about,
but I am a fool for anything with a title like "Fun
with Birds." You cau't miss on this.
Rcrnember, Fun with Excom at 7:15 and Fun with
Birds at 7:30.
a date tonight? Looking for something to do?
If you want to stay on campus there are at least
two free shows that I can recommend.
At 7:15 Excom will hold its regular weekly meeting.
Democratically, the student public is invited. While
space is limited in the Excom room, I have every as
surance that if the crowds warrant it, Excom will
move to the little theater.
Although he has been ill, Mr. George Jackson is
again expected to play the lead in tonight's perform
ance. Kind, fatherly Mr. Jackson is deserving of credit.
Playing opposite Miss Pat Adams, who is currently
cast as the ingenue, his is a difficult task, for never
must he seem to take advantage of her but always
direct her efforts to the highest goal.
Miss Adams' part is a psychological problem. She
is harassed by a gnawing desire to be an Invisible
Scarlett O'Hara and eliminate all duplication or sub
terfuge in the forming of committees.
Ralph Clark, who in ordinary life is business man
ager of the Quad, is the Bob Hope of the cast. Almost
oblivious of what is going on, he is constantly mur
muring sly innuendos and back-page Chappie jokes.
The Inquiring Reporter is played by Daily Editor
Hal Shafer. Man of affairs and worldly-wise, he lends
a metropolitan touch to the production. Opposite him
Miss Nancy Burkett is currently starring in the ro
mantic lead. She plays her part very ably, and when
she murmurs "I second the motion" with husky voice
and lowered eyelids, she sometimes has the true Bern
hardt catch.
Jim McKellar plays the part of the able, moneyed
financier. With the acumen of a Dick Tracy, he time
and again spots the corrupt trickeries of the hosts of
bandits posing as treasurers of various campus clubs
and organizations.
The juvenile leads are played by Peggy Boothe and
Dick Driscoll. This Rooney-Garland team portrays
the fun-loving, rosy-cheeked college boy and girl.
They have the efficiency of youth and will be found to
be a refreshing combination.
Excom is even better than Buck Rogers and it
comes every week.
