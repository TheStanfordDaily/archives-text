'pHE EDITOR, SIR:
One of the two times during a year that we drag
ourselves out of bed in time to go to church is Easter
morning. Perhaps this condemns us to start, but if
the Easter Service was an example we will continue
to get our sleep. Not moved by any religious fervor,
but desiring to hear an inspiring sermon to remember
until Christmas, we, and those like us who attended
the Easter Services, were sadly disappointed by Dr.
Trueblood's sermon. It showed poor taste, not only for
Easter Sunday, but as a wartime sennon as well.
We were expecting a welcome relief from the usual
depressing news and radio commentators, but instead
we got the same thing, except with a halo. Dr. True
blood seemed to think that a sermon in the chapel
gave him the opportunity to tell us, and those soldiers
present, that they were licked, "victims" and not vic
tors. True, for the past 20 years, peace has been sold
us as a world aim, but the church too supported that
aim. We are not victims of this teaching, but we are
to be ultimate victors because we haven't lost sight of
that peace.
Stanford couldn't have received its good reputation
from the pulpit.
