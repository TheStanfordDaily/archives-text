# Ernie Brandsten Replaces Thornton as Swim Coach
## 
### 
A man who has been in the background, officially, for some time, at
last has a title in keeping with his reputation.
Ernie Brandsten, one of the deans of Olympic and collegiate diving,
now heads the Stanford swimming and diving teams. He replaces Nort
Thornton, who has accepted a position in the public school system.

Ernie has been associated with.
Stanford for many years, but for
the past few seasons he has merely
occupied an advisory position on
the coaching staff.
DIVING CHAMP
Starting his aquatic career almost
40 years ago, Ernie was diving for
Sweden in the 1912 Olympics. In
the Swedish championships he met
Greta, the women's champion, whom
he eventually married. That same
year Ernie came to the University
of California, and his wife came with
him to coach the Berkeley women
in swimming and diving.
In his three years at Cal Brandsten
turned out three Pacific Coast cham
pionship teams and developed Bob
Small, first American to beat "Duke"
Kahanemokuo.
COMES TO EARM
The Brandstens came to Stanford
in 1915, and several years later they
started the Searsville Lake develop
ment. Ernie has helped coach Olym
pic teams with Bill Bachrach in
1924 and 1928, and with Bob Kiphuth
in 1932 and 1936.
At Stanford, Ernie has developed
such famous aquatic stars as Pete
Desjardins, American champion
from 1925 to 1929, and Olympic
champ in 1928. A1 White, who was
champ for four years before Des
jardins, Roy Winkleman, Howie Ad
ams, and many others.
STANDARDIZED RULES
Ernie's main contribution to the
world of diving has been his stand
ardization of diving rules the world
over, and his inventions which have
led his board to be adopted officially
for Olympic and intercollegiate
events.
And as he stands out next to the
pool, the ever-present grey fedora
shading his eyes, Ernie will even ad
mit that his teams went to the
N.C.A.A. in 1926 and 1931 where
they won runner-up honors to Navy
and Yale.
