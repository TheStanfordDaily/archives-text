### JOHN HORRALL 
Three campus publications — the
Carillon, Dividcx, and Informer —
died last night at Excom because of
decreased advertising due to the
war but, to conform with the new
four-quarter war program, it was
decided The Daily will publish five
days a week in tabloid form summer
quarter instead of twice a week as
in previous summers.
The Daily will only increase pub
lication if enrollment reaches 1800
or more, and was also granted an
additional summer quarter subsidy
of 25 cents from each student.
After talking with Dean Marion
Kirkwood, constitutional adviser,
the sub-committee on student gov
ernment revision suggested that in
stead of putting an amendment up
to the student body at the coming
elections, it be allowed to make rec
ommendations on ideas to Excom.
Excom would then choose the best
plan and submit it to the student
body at a special election as soon as
possible.

of Florence Bigelow, Palo Alto ad
