# Convalescent Kiddies Send Letters Abroad from Beds
## 
### 
Tuesday is letter day at the Con
valescent Home. Everybody who
can write — and those who cannot
are being taught how —is required
to take care of the correspondence
piling up on him.
From the typed copies of the let
ters kept on file, typical excerpts
follow.
Ned Pugh, who headed the Home
Drive in 1940, received this thank
you note following Labor Day:
"Dear Ned Pugh,
"Thank you for sending the Stan
ford Band out to play for us and
the barbecue supper.
"The band was very nice and I
liked it very much.
"I liked the nice meat too at the
barbecue. We walked over and saw
Big Sam cook it and did it smell
good.
"Thank you again.
Your friend,
James Finn"
When the late Mrs. Timothy Hop
kins, one of the Home's most devoted
patrons, became ill, she received
many letters like this:
"Dear Mrs. Hopkins,
"We are all very sorry to hear you
are ill, and we hope you have as
nice a place to be ill in as we have.
We have a lot of fun here. . . .
"The sun is just coming out of
the clouds. I am very glad.
Marjian McFarlane"
The barber got due appreciation
for his clipping visit. Such com
ments as "I liked the buzzing thing"
were frequent. One letter said:
"Dear Mr. Reed,
"Thank you for cutting our hair.
Everything needed a hair cut. Your
a good barber. You cut my hair just
like the barber does at home. Before
you cut some of the boys hair it was
down to their ears. Thanking you
again. I am your friend,
Charles Weingand
Letters home talk about "the
magic man who came to see us" and
how everybody caught on to all his
tricks, about school work at the
Home, about parties and other ac
tivities.
A parent's answer to one of her
child's letter included such news as:
"Dear son Daniel,
". . . Daniel the home will let me
know when you will be home with
me. and with this I mean to say that
I couldn't say when I can go and
sec you there, for what we are mak
ing at the peas, is just enough to
eat. So with nothing more to say, re
gards from all your brothers and
sisters and I remain your's truly
mother."
But the news from the convalesc
ing children is invariably good news.
Everybody at the Con Home is re
covering.
