# Yanks Retreat In Philippines
## Americans Fall Back Before Jap Offensive 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 7 (UP). —
The darkest hour of the Philippines
campaign approached tonight, with
American-Filipino defenders of Ba
taan Peninsula falling back grimly
before fresh Japanese reserves pour
ing into the battle lines and both
sides suffering heavy casualties.

Thrown into the battle—most sav
age of the entire Philippines cam
paign—were all the instruments of
the Jap war kit, including concen
trations of heavy artillery, tanks,
and dive bombers.

The dive bombers bombed and
machine-gunned front line troops
and, for the second time in the last
few days, bombed an American base
hospital, War Department Com
munique No. 180 reported.

Three flights of heavy bombers
roared over the hospital where
wounded soldiers were undergoing
treatment, inflicting many casualties
in their attack. The communique
noted that after their previous attack
the Japanese broadcast an apology
saying the bombing was accidental.

"Today's attack on this plainly
marked hospital, following so closely
the first attack, tends to prove that
both raids were intentional," the
communique said.
