# India Decides to Reject Dominion Status; Nehru Asks F.D.R. to Intervene
## Congress Party Working Committee Holds Out for Complete Freedom; People Fold to Kesist Aggression 
### 
NLW DELHI, April 7 (UP). â€”-The All-India Congress Parly's working
committee has decided to reject Britain's amended self-government plan,
it was reported tonight, as Pandit Jnwaharlal Nehru appealed to President'
Roosevelt to intervene, contending that the Indian problem is of vital
import to all the United Nations.
(Ihe London Daily Mail reported that an "eleventh hour concession to

maian demands on the question of
an Indian defense minister" was an
nounced in New Delhi. It hinted
that the Indians were willing to
except operational control from the
powers of a defense minister, leav
ing that to General Sir Archibald P.
Wavell, and said "It is unlikely that
the war cabinet would agree to such
a weakening of Wavcll's position in
this grave hour.")
Nehru, most influential member of
the Congress (nationalist) party,
promised that if the Japanese in
vade India he will go to the front
"and fight them unto the death."
As soon as the working committee
reached its decision, it was learned,
Nehru hurried to inform Louis John
son, Mr. Roosevelt's personal envoy
here. The decision will not be com
municated to Sir Stafford Cripps, the
British negotiator, until tomorrow
morning.
Without waiting for a settlement
with Britain, however, the Congress
was reported to have decided to
message the Indian people to resist
aggression with whatever means
were available. They will be told
not to run from places of danger and,
if necessary, to face the invader
calmly and resolutely.
