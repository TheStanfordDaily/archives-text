### 
NEW DELHI, April 7 (UP).—Ar
rival of regular U. S. Army fliers to
join the famed AVG in the defense
of bomb-ravaged Mandalay was an
nounced today from the Bui-ma front
as Japanese troops, snaking up both
banks of the Irrawaddy River, ad
vanced on a new British defense
line less than 60 miles from the Bur
mese oil fields.

The British abandoned Thayetmo,
.57 miles north of fallen Prome, after
destroying oil and cement installa
tions, and moved on farther north to
take up new positions in defense of
the Minbu oil region, the lant im
portant source of oil left to the Al
lies in the Far East, a Burma com
munique reported. Minbu is 63 miles
north of Thayetmo.

Meanwhile, 80 miles to the east,
Japanese and Chinese artillery duel
ed along the road to Mandalay at a
point a few miles above Toungoo,
and a Chungking dispatch revealed
that the American volunteer group,
which has flown for months under
the Chinese flag in defense of Burma
and the Burma supply road, has now
been joined by units of the Ameri
can Army air force. Together, they
will attempt to ward off further air
assaults on Mandalay, which the
Japanese almost destroyed in a raid
last Friday that caused 8,000 casual
ties.
The Japanese, at last reports, had
not advanced beyond Kama, 17 miles
north of Prome on the west bank of
the Irrawaddy, and Nyaungbinzeik,
15 miles north of Prome on the cast
bank.
One Japanese force has veered off
northeast, up the Sinjok Valley,
however, according to today's com
munique, and it was believed the
Japs would soon be in both Thayet
mo and Allanmyo, which lie on op
posite sides of the river. The Brit
ish also left Allanmyo, after carry
ing out successful demolitions.
