## 
### 
Garden birds in all their fascinating aspccls of nesting, feeding, and
bathing were shown in the motion picture presented by l)r. T. Eric Rey
nolds, amateur ornithologist, on the Tuesday Series program lust evening
in Memorial Ilall.
Dr. Reynolds explained that the study of garden birds and photo-

graphing them is satisfying because,
"New Birds come as the seasons roll
along, the seasonal ones change color
and plumage, and one has continual
panorama going on around him."
Close-up views in brilliant techni
color showed the complexity of color
patterns of robins, goldfinch, meadow
larks, and the numerous other birds
which visited the Reynolds garden
pool.
The feeding of the birds was ex
plained by Dr. Reynolds as the film
pictured the humming bird parent
thrusting its sword-like beak into
the gullet of its young. In some bird
families, the male gathers the food
for both the female and the small
birds, while in others the female
secures her own, he said.
Dr. Reynolds stated, "Some small
birds consume their normal weight,
in food every 24 hours."
Various types of nests and their
construction, the J uncos' redwood
bark nest, the Bush tits' flexible nest
which expands as the young birds
grow, and the ground nest of the

meadow lark were pictured.
The tameness of the robin Timmie
was shown when Mrs. Reynolds pho
tographed him bathing in their
kitchen sink, a habit he continued
for several weeks, according to Dr.
Reynolds.
