# Frosh Netmen To Play Lowell
## 
### 
The Farm's frosh netmen face
their first test of the new quarter to
day when they play Lowell High
on the Stanford courts at 1:30 p.m.
The frosh are favorites on the basis
of individual performances, but lack
of information makes it pretty hard
to predict just what Lowell will be
able to do, according to Coach
Johnny Lamb.
Ted Myers, northern California's
fifth ranking junior and a finalist in
the recent Del Monte Juniors, heads
the Indian team, with eighth-rank
ing Bob Rutledge, and former
Southern California Interscholastic
High School Champion Dick Thom
as, in the two and three spots. Big
threat for the San Franciscans will
be their captain, George Chichester.
Craig at four, Murray at number
five position, and Paul Greenberg
in the sixth slot complete the Card
singles line-up, with the Myers-
Thomas, Rutledge-Craig, and Wally
Smith - Jerry, fine combinations
holding down the one-two-three
doubles berths.
The frosh h avc two-more games
before the Cal matches: San Jose
State on April 11, and San Mateo
J.C. on April 13. The 45'ers play
California on April 16 as a prelim
inary to the Varsity-Cal matches on
the Farm courts.
