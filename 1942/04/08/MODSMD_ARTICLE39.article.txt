# Trackmen Meet San Jose In Twilight Meet Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford will hold its first twilight
track meet in two years tomorrow
afternoon at 4 on Angell Field when
the varsity entertains the San Jose
State Spartans in a dual meet.
The strongest team in the Spar
tans' history bolstered by freshmen
and first-year transfers, all of whom
are eligible for N.C.A.A. competition,
will be slight favorites to defeat
Pitch Johnson's men in the Farm's
| first home meet of the year.
FASTEST HUMAN
Last fall when Bud Winter, former
Salinas J.C. coach and tutor of Hal
! Davis, newest "world's fastest hu
j man" took over the track coaching
I position at San Jose he counted in
his fold three national junior college
champions and nine high school
wonders.
Although several of these men
have turned up ineligible in the in
terim. Winter still is "stocked" as his
100-31 victory of San Francisco
State would tend to show. The San
Jose meet which used to serve as a
breather on the Card schedule can
hardly be classed as that now.
TRIPLE WINNER
Likely triple winner for the visi
tors is Pill Smith, negro freshman
from Los Angeles. Smith's running
and jumping should be too much for
the Indians in his event. Frank
! Minini's weight tossing, Elwood
j Clark's javelin wafting, and Vern
I Cooley's pole vaulting give the Stat-
I ers a chance to sweep the field
j events.
The hurdles, Stanford's stronghold
[ this season, should provide excel
! lent competition with Ed Hertel and
j Don Reiss facing Omar Cowles and
| Stan Bowen from San Jose. Last
I year as a Palo Alto high school lad.
Cowles broke the state high school
{ high hurdle mark.
SPRINTER MENACE
The mile will see Bob Compton,
lanky Farm sophomore, tangle with
, Bill Ingram, another state high
| school champ last year, while the
greatest half-mile prospect since
j John Woodruff, Thalmo Knowles,

tangles with Indian Wyland Cripe in
the 880. Knowles, a tall black negro,
resembles Woodruff in everything he
does.
Add to this list Stan Knight and
'Bill Rhyne, two vastly improved
sprinter-440 men, and you have the
reason for the Cards' defeat tomor
row, if such a thing occurs.
Captain Gene Kern, who is en
tered in five events, will bear the
| brunt of the Indians' attack, which
features besides those already men
tioned. Russ Peck and Ed Tomaso hi
the pole vault, Vern Hart and Wil
lard Smith in the high jump, Ernie
Peninou and A1 Pande, javelin, and
j Bill Quackenbush, sprints.
