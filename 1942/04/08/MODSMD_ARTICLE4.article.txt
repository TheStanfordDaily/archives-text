Wartime conservation cinches the
belt of a complacent Farm eating
public one notch tighter with the
introduction of the "Clean Your
Plate" program of the Consumer's
Education Board in speeches at Farm
dining groups today.
Frances Lengfeld at Roble, Cris
Moody at Lagunitg, Beryl Robinson
at Union, Colin McClintock at En
cina, Bob McNeil at Sequoia, and
Jane Donald, Peggy Shaw, Marga
ret Harrison, Virginia Erickson,
Martha Berringer, Stret Smith, Bur
ton Berry, Gordon Jacobs, Buss An
derson, Harry Boothe, John Harter,
and Suzie Winston will be the
speakers in the campus-wide pro
gram for food education.
Wasted food means wasted war ef
fort, sponsors stated. Thoughtless
waste, usually the result of finicky
habits or ordinary neglect, means
that more time on transportation
lines must be used for transfer of
civilian products, that food supplies
which should be used to keep army
morale at a peak are needlessly tap
ped, and that health of the civilian
population is injured. In a time when
the entire nation is devoting its effort
toward victory, personal victory over
slothful habits is essential, sponsors
stated.
The goal of the program is a sys
tem of voluntary self-rationing for
all students as a training in efficient
living for the duration.
According to dieticians, dining hall
food fills all the calory requirements
for well-rounded, healthy meals. "It
is just as important to eat something
of everything on your plate as to
clean your plate," Miss Christine
Ricker, dining hall director, stated
in urging that students realize that
clean plates also mean health.
