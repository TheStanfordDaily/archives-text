# Indian Mermen Travel South
## 
### 
With a possible conference cham
pionship in sight. Stanford's varsity
swimming team journeys southward
this week-end to face the Southern
California and U.C.L.A. mermen on
successive days.
The important tilt is against
U.S.C.. Friday afternoon at 3. After
California finished trimming U. C.
L. A., 57 to 18, the Trojans handed
the Bears a 49 to 25 defeat, estab
; lishing the southerners as the team
to beat in the conference. Stanford
meets the Uclans Saturday at 1.
Luckily for Ernie Brandsten's In
dians, the Trojans' strong events are
weak events for the Cards. Giving
! away 8 points each in the diving and
breast stroke and at least 6 points in
the back stroke, the Indians can
still come through with a win if
Stanford's Don Smith, Key Rule, Ted
Munroe, Bob Jones, and Bob Rey
nolds can combine to swim one, two
in the 50, 100, 220, and 440 free-style
I races against Sexton, Hinkley, and
I Crum of U.S.C.
