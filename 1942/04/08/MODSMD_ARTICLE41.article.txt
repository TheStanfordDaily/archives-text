# Rowing Fans Start Crew Under Clary
## 
### 
Stanford will have a crew, not be
cause university athletic officials en
courage the sport by giving coach
ing or credit, but because a group
of students are convinced that the
Farm needs rowing and are handling
the affair "on their own."
Under the general direction of
Bud Clary, Chi Psi, some 30 Stan
fordites are paying to equip a shell
in an effort to train a crew capable
of meeting other coast schools. In
1940, Ted Cole and Lee Peake started
a campaign to begin the crew, and
this year the program is being rap
idly expanded.
The students have secured the
services of a coach, Carl Pederson,
former University of California shell
ace, who donates his services. Prac
tice sessions on the Redwood City
estuary occupy about three full
crews weekly.
CLARY EXPLAINS
Clary explains the program as en
tirely voluntary. "The fellows are
doing this for the fun of rowing,
supporting it out of their own pock
ets. We won't schedule any races
until we get a crew trained and
conditioned. Races are plentiful, but
crews, especially at Stanford, are
hard to get."
Meets with U.C.L.A., Sacramento
J.C., Oregon State, and Reed College
await the oarsmen when Pederson
feels that his on-their-own squad is
in good enough shape to meet col
lege crews trained as a i-egular part
of a university athletic program.
Perhaps the most prominent up
perclassmen aiding the embryo set
up are Bob Porter, Berl Cobb, and
Clary.
ENCIXA INTEREST
Considerable interest in crew
originates in Encina, where Clark
Hunter, Jerry Grunwald, and Herb
Goodman are attempting to organize
a frosh crew that "will carry out the
group's plans in future years.
"Freshmen, especially, are needed.
Crew at Stanford can be built up
only if entering classes will turn
out and help build next year's var
sities," Clary stated.

Goodman are attempting to organize
a frosh crew that "will carry out the
group's plans in future years.
"Freshmen, especially, are needed.
Crew at Stanford can be built up
only if entering classes will turn
out and help build next year's var
sities," Clary stated.
Stanford will have a crew, not be
cause university athletic officials en
courage the sport by giving coach
ing or credit, but because a group
of students are convinced that the
Farm needs rowing and are handling
the affair "on their own."
Under the general direction of
Bud Clary, Chi Psi, some 30 Stan
fordites are paying to equip a shell
in an effort to train a crew capable
of meeting other coast schools. In
1940, Ted Cole and Lee Peake started
a campaign to begin the crew, and
this year the program is being rap
idly expanded.
The students have secured the
services of a coach, Carl Pederson,
former University of California shell
ace, who donates his services. Prac
tice sessions on the Redwood City
estuary occupy about three full
crews weekly.
CLARY EXPLAINS
Clary explains the program as en
tirely voluntary. "The fellows are
doing this for the fun of rowing,
supporting it out of their own pock
ets. We won't schedule any races
until we get a crew trained and
conditioned. Races are plentiful, but
crews, especially at Stanford, are
hard to get."
Meets with U.C.L.A., Sacramento
J.C., Oregon State, and Reed College
await the oarsmen when Pederson
feels that his on-their-own squad is
in good enough shape to meet col
lege crews trained as a i-egular part
of a university athletic program.
Perhaps the most prominent up
perclassmen aiding the embryo set
up are Bob Porter, Berl Cobb, and
Clary.
ENCIXA INTEREST
Considerable interest in crew
originates in Encina, where Clark
Hunter, Jerry Grunwald, and Herb
Goodman are attempting to organize
a frosh crew that "will carry out the
group's plans in future years.
