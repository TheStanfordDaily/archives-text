i r |M-IE Bad Berkeley Bears' baseball
team may get a surprise to- i
! morrow. Nothing but a win can |
surprise the Indians. . . . None other
I lhan aristocratic Stanford students
| were toting the bags for the Uclan
i golf team the other morning, since
j the Bruins didn't get the usual caddy
allowance. . . . One of the bigger :
, $ of the Buck-of-the-Month Club
attended yesterday's ball game. That
may explain the team's temporary
rejuvenation. . . . Watch for a rug
tted football team next fall. Jim Law
son is going to curb those Stanford :
sissy rumors once and for all. . .
California's astounding track marks
last Saturday were made on the
wind-blown Westwood cinderpath,
and not the soggy Coliseum track as 1
scheduled.

RECENTLY in his column "Be- ;
| hind the Line," in which he steps j
; out of line quite often, Dick Hy
land, self-styled Tricky Dick, com
pared Clark Daniel Shaughnessy's
j leaving Stanford to a "rat leaving a
sinking ship." If he is as big a
cheese as he thinks he is and if
Coach Clark is a rat, perhaps he
j should watch his step.

LAST Saturday morning Harry
Maloney started his 24th year of
boys' physical education classes.
Originally the classes were for sons
of University faculty and officials
between the ages of 8 and 14, but
now sons of the alumni in this re
gion are included and some boys
come all the way from San Fran
cisco every spring Saturday morning
for the 2 hours of training in every
sport that a boy would want. Harry
has seen boys go through the classes
and on into Stanford and now their
sons are enx'olled.

ONE of the best athletic compe
titions to be held in these parts this
spring is going to be run off in the

Encina Pools on April 18 when the
Stanford frosh swimming team hosts
the Berkeley freshmen.
Both schools' frosh teams won the
interclass competition for the first
time this year over the rest of their
schools and both have stars on their
teams that have been eclipsing
school records regularly.
The Daily Californian began blow
ing its horn about the Cub natators
long ago, musing on how badly their
aces Stan Morketter and Don Bean
ston would trounce the Papooses.
This noise, hqwever, toned down a
little when they found that the man
who beat Morketter eosistantly in
interscholastic competition last year
was Jim Gamble, the lad who had
just tied the collegiate freshman 50-
yard mark for Stanford.
Morketter holds all Cal frosh
records in the 50 and 100, while
Beanston has lowered every mark
from the 220 on up. They have sev
eral other boys backing these stars
up to give the Cubs a well-rounded
team.
They'll have a tough time out
splashing the Papooses, however,
since Ernie Brandsten is loaded with
not only Gamble, but also Alan
Weeden, one of the best back-sirok
ers on the coast, Hank Saltonstall,
in the breaststroke, and Dick Nar
ver in the 100 and 220. Gamble now
holds the school frosh 50 and 100
marks as well as unofficially better
ing the national frosh record in the
shorter race. Weeden. Pacific Asso
ciation champ, has hacked the back
stroke mark way down, and Narver
and Saltonstall near the school rec
ords in their events every time they
get in the water.
