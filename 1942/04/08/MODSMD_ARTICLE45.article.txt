The Indians go south leading the
conference race, having beaten the
Bruins last Friday. If they can
sweep their three matches over the
week-end, they will almost clinch
the championship.
Heading the Indians will be Ted
Sehroeder, followed by Emery Neale,
Larry Dee, Jimmy Wade and Andy
Roberts. Yesterday, transfer Ben
Olsen defeated Chuck Hutchison
6-1, 6-3, in a ladder match and will
play number five. Tommy Kruger,
junior star who is finally rounding
into shape, whipped Paul Wilson
3-6, 6-2, 6-1, and will be the num
ber six man for the Cards against
both schools.

Dee and Sehroeder continue to be
the top doubles team for the Cards,
even though neither boy has played
his best doubles as yet. To give the
Cards additional strength. Coach
Lamb has teamed Wade and Neale,
the third and fourth best doubles
players. Both boys worked out to
gether for the first time, and seemed
to play well together. Roberts and
Kruger will be the third Indian
doubles team.
