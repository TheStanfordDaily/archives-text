# The 						Old Story

AS the Pacific war enters its fifth month and
the United States is over the first shock of
reality, the nation shows signs, similar to those
in Britain about a year ago, of resuming its fa
mous character of squabbling and division
which once led Hitler to liken it to a hen house
full of cackling chickens.

As might be expected, Colonel "Bertie" Mc-
Cormick, described alternately as the Duke and
the Dupe of Chicago, was the first of the isola
tionists to quit the "our country right or wrong"
banner and resume bitter criticism of President
Roosevelt. Other isolationist editors have fol
lowed.

On the other hand, newspapers which sup
ported the Administration's pre-war stand are
submitting to the temptation of assuming an
"I told you so" attitude, and even remarking that
the isolationists must now admit they were
wrong all along. This of course is asinine, and
only tempts the isolationists, for the most part a
patriotic lot, to start screaming again.
Other squabbles which have more potential
danger to the country than the isolationist-inter
ventionist battle are also awakening from the
unconsciousness induced by the blow of Pearl
Harbor. Eleanor Roosevelt, bless her soul, li
vened up her recent commercially sponsored
radio series with the vague statement that "We
cannot win the war unless we realize that we
are fighting for a changed world," and of course
brought on herself a barrage of criticism from
such habitually outraged dignitaries as the
American Legion commander and Westbrook
Pegler.
A more famous internal fight which the war
has failed to stop is the one over the 40-hour
week. Capital claims that labor should be will
ing to give up the 40-hour week in order to win
the war—certainly a reasonable suggestion
while labor claims that capital is using the war
to take away its hard-won privileges—also
plausible.
Writers who revel in Americana will no
doubt be pleased at this example of raw Ameri
can individualism, but writers of history may
only shake their heads at American stupidity.—

A lot of people have been wondering
whether the accomplishments and decisions
reached at last month's meetinq of the Pacific
Coast Conference in Portland justified the
travelinq expenses of coaches and athletic
directors. When retrenchments were in order,
and when they had a beautiful excuse to dis
pense with the services of Edwin N. Atherton,
Conference "czar," they failed in all respects
to move on proposed economy measures.
