# Sunday Film Stars Fonda
## 
### 
Henry Fonda gets entombed in a
cellar with Madeleine Carroll when
the windows are blocked in an air
raid. Now wouldn't that be just too
agonizing for Fonda?
Madeleine is an international spy,
but she changes sides when she sees
people hungry. Of course, the fact
that Fonda is fighting for the other
side has nothing to do with her
change.
There have been unfoynded re
ports of late that Madeleine has be
come matronly. But absolutely no
one was saying that in 1938 when
"Blockade" was filmed. Not only
was "Blockade" one of her out
standing dramatic performances, but
she was voted as the woman Colum
bia men would most like to be alone
on a desert island with.
"Blockade" will play on the Sad
ler Series Sunday at 7:15 in Memo
rial Hall. It will be the second event
of the Convalescent Home Drive, and
proceeds will go to the Home. Ad
mission is 20 cents, and tickets are
now on sale at the A.S.S.U. office to
avoid the crowds at the box office.
