### AMIE REICHERT 
J>RITAIN Foreign AfTairs Expert Lord Van Sittart
came out with an interesting statement the other
day, something to the effect that all Germans are
"bad." I doubt strongly if the idea would hold water
for ten seconds with a single intelligent and honest
anthropologist or sociologist or historian, but Britain's
Lord Van Sittart, whom they call a "Foreign Affairs
Expert" came right out with it and quite noisy he
was too, so maybe it's true?
On the other hand I just asked four people here
in the Shack and they all disagreed with the Expert.
And I asked Jack, the janitor, about the Germans and
he said, No they were not all bad people, but that
some of them were the finest people alive.
And then he told me how he rescued Felix Von
Luckner, the German Sea Commander, in a battle in
the North Sea during the last war. Jack saved his life
when Von Luckner's ship, the Emden, was hit, and
the commander jumped overboard to commit suicide.
Jack was second engineer on the Olympic and he
saw Von Luckner go over and jumped in after him.
They got aboard and there were some other Germans
who had been picked up in a lifeboat and one of them
had a gun concealed in„his belt, and he shot Jack.
Seventeen times, he shot him. But he didn't kill him,
because he's right here and he is the Daily janitor.
Now, taking the score, I should say that the Brit
ish Expert is outnumbered five to one, and by a man
who was shot seventeen times, at that.

VOU hear a lot of talk of the sort Van Sittart gave
out with the other day, but little of it comes
from the Experts.
That sort of talk is false and because it is false
it is dangerous. And it nourishes a dangerous and
vindictive attitude. If our policies at the peace table
after this war are dictated by Experts like Van Sit
tart, and men of similar mentality, we are sure to find
ourselves in the same world mess all over again in no
time.
There is no single answer to the problem of German
aggression, so far as I know. There is no Qne theory
which will blanket all the causes into one consistent
statement.
It is dangerous to make generalities of the sort Van
Sittart did, generalities which pigeonhole the entire
issue, which probably make easy thinking matter for
some people, but place the entire problem in a false
light.
Look at the problems of war and aggression and the
Axis and the rest of it today from all the angles. Look
at it the way they teach you to look at history in
Western Civ—from the political and economic and so
cial and philosophical and cultural angles. Don't stop
with the German army. And don't stop with Adolf
Hitler.

some people, but place the entire problem in a false
light.
Look at the problems of war and aggression and the
Axis and the rest of it today from all the angles. Look
at it the way they teach you to look at history in
Western Civ—from the political and economic and so
cial and philosophical and cultural angles. Don't stop
with the German army. And don't stop with Adolf
Hitler.
J>RITAIN Foreign AfTairs Expert Lord Van Sittart
came out with an interesting statement the other
day, something to the effect that all Germans are
"bad." I doubt strongly if the idea would hold water
for ten seconds with a single intelligent and honest
anthropologist or sociologist or historian, but Britain's
Lord Van Sittart, whom they call a "Foreign Affairs
Expert" came right out with it and quite noisy he
was too, so maybe it's true?
On the other hand I just asked four people here
in the Shack and they all disagreed with the Expert.
And I asked Jack, the janitor, about the Germans and
he said, No they were not all bad people, but that
some of them were the finest people alive.
And then he told me how he rescued Felix Von
Luckner, the German Sea Commander, in a battle in
the North Sea during the last war. Jack saved his life
when Von Luckner's ship, the Emden, was hit, and
the commander jumped overboard to commit suicide.
Jack was second engineer on the Olympic and he
saw Von Luckner go over and jumped in after him.
They got aboard and there were some other Germans
who had been picked up in a lifeboat and one of them
had a gun concealed in„his belt, and he shot Jack.
Seventeen times, he shot him. But he didn't kill him,
because he's right here and he is the Daily janitor.
Now, taking the score, I should say that the Brit
ish Expert is outnumbered five to one, and by a man
who was shot seventeen times, at that.

VOU hear a lot of talk of the sort Van Sittart gave
out with the other day, but little of it comes
from the Experts.
That sort of talk is false and because it is false
it is dangerous. And it nourishes a dangerous and
vindictive attitude. If our policies at the peace table
after this war are dictated by Experts like Van Sit
tart, and men of similar mentality, we are sure to find
ourselves in the same world mess all over again in no
time.
There is no single answer to the problem of German
aggression, so far as I know. There is no Qne theory
which will blanket all the causes into one consistent
statement.
It is dangerous to make generalities of the sort Van
Sittart did, generalities which pigeonhole the entire
issue, which probably make easy thinking matter for
some people, but place the entire problem in a false
light.
