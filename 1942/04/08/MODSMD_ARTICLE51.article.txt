# BULL SESSION

### MIKE CHURCHILL 
YESTERDAY morning I heard about a little boy who
was hospitalized because he charged madly into a
concrete wall hoping to go through it just like Super
man. I heard it as I was reading about Women's Nomi
nating Committee. I couldn't help but draw the ob
vious analogy.
I set to wondering what Women's Nominating Com
mittee could be like. This is the picture I got:
The Misses Fels Naptha, Bromo Seltzer, Carbo Hy
drate, and Sally Hepatica are assembled around the
table in the Excom room. Says Sally: 'Now we must
decide whom we will nominate. There was really no
one quite as good as us, was there? Carbo, dear, will
you please go through the list."
Carbo: "First we have that Phillpots girl. Of course
you know what I think about her."
Bromo: "You're absolutely right, my dear. Why, I
saw her out with a man myself, only last quarter."
Sally: "Well, I guess we've made up our mind about
her. Will you go on to the next one please, Carbo?"
Carbo: "Next is Jean Blues, she's ben out with a
Phi Psi."
Fels: "Then as I see it there is absolutely no ques
tion about dropping her. Agreed?"
Carbo: "Of course. Now we come to Esme Any
thing. Anybody got any dirt on her?"
Fels: "Well, she smokes."
Carbo: "But I've seen you smoke, Fels dear."
FelS: "But not just before election."
Sally: "That's true. Consider her dropped."
Carbo: "Sese Quoia's next."

Bromo: "I saw her down at Dinah's with my very
own eyes, that type of girl ought to be expelled."
Fels: "But what were you doing there, Bromo?"
Bromo: "Why, why, er, eating dinner, of course."
Carbo: "Lizabell Lostitt wants vice-president, as I
quess you know."

Sally: "Rumph, she's actually trying to get elected,
I don't see why we should let her get it."
Fels: "Neither do I. Let's go on."
â™¦ * * *

"Well, there's one name left. Mary Yost.
* Does anybody know anything about her?"
Sally: "Doesn't seem so. Do you suppose there is
actually one person we can nominate?"
Fels: "I'm not so sure. I've heard her name some
where before. Let's look her up, we can't take any
chances."
Bromo: "Here it is, but she's Dean of Women."
Fels: "Well, I guess that rules her out."
Sally: "We've been through the whole list and there
just isn't one whom we would dare to nominate. Has
anyone any suggestions?"
Carbo: "We could renominate ourselves and thus
avoid taking any chances of the wrong people being
elected."
Sally: "What a splendid idea. There's nothing else
to do so let's all go out and get a drink."
