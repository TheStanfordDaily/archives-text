# Waldeck's 'Athene Palace' Is Excellent 'Inside' Story
## 
### 
"ATHENE PALACE." by Countess Waldeck.
In the last decade there has grown up in American literature a highly
popular type of non-fiction hest described as the "descriptive" or "inside
dope" type of book, in which the author, usually a foreign correspondent
aiming for literary rather than journalistic fame, gives his version of that

elusive and often highly obvious
thing which Americans are ever
grasping for—the "real" reason, the
"inside" story, the behind-the-scenes
action which according to American
thought is to be found lurking be
hind every news event.

The latest addition to this collec
tion is "Athene Palace," in which
Countess Waldeck, of whom more
later, serves up the insidest inside
story yet, spiced with risque stories
about German and Balkan diplomats
and their highly naughty doings,
written in the excellent descriptive
style of the practiced raconteur, and
containing surprisingly impartial and
profound reflections on the spread of
the New Order in Balkan Europe.

excellent book. It is one of the few
"interpretive" books not obscured by
anti-Nazi emotional gymnastics, and
it has the added attraction of being
written by someone whose sources
are at least a little more "in the
know" than Propaganda Ministry
publications and General Staff com
muniques.—R. D. Monahan

Countess Waldeck, a German
born Jewess who after a highly ex
citing life among what disgruntled
American editors like to call the
"fast international set" got herself a
job as correspondent for an Ameri
can newspaper, arrived in Bucharest
the day Paris fell. Staying at the
Athene Palace, "the last Grand Ho
tel in Europe," she surveyed with
experienced eyes the muscling-in of
the Nazis in Rumanian affairs, the
fall of Carol and Lupescu and the
rise and fall of the Guardist (Ru
manian Fascist) regime, the frenzied
but futile attempts of the English to
keep Rumanian friendship, and fi
nally the complete taking over of
the country by the German mili
tary.

Through her obvious ability to get
along famously with diplomats and
military leaders, and her evident ac
quaintance with a host of spies, po
litical mercenaries and just gossip
ers that abound so in the Balkans,
the Countess tells the most highly
convincing of the "inside" stories yet
to appear on the market.

Whether the Countess' sources are
authentic and her conclusions wise
we do not attempt to say, but her
reasoning certainly impresses one as
much more intelligent than, for in
stance, the nasty and hatred-ridden
mouthings of William Shirer in
"Berlin Diary" do.
Here, briefly, are three of the
more interesting points of "Athene
Palace":
(1) Germans, far from being the
perfect model of efficiency and plan
ning in their diplomacy, at times
"muddle through" with much more
stupidity than the British. A good
example of this was their handling
of the Rumanian-Hungarian bound
ary quarrel, where they forced a de
cision highly unfavorable to both
sides on the participants and
brought about the very thing they
did not want — unrest and finally
revolution in a "supply" state which
they wanted above all things to keep
quiet and efficient.

(2) The Nazis are far more inter
ested in puppet governments that
keep order than in '"pure fascist"
governments, and in fact often at
tempt to discourage "junior" fascist
movements when they interfere with
German plans. A good example of
this is their treatment of the Guard
ists in Rumania. The latter, although
fascist, were of course very nation
alistic, and said in effect "To hell
with the communists and the Ger
mans too." When the Guardists got
too frisky for big brother fascists in
Germany, the Nazis kicked them out.

(3) That the higher up you get in
the Nazi hierarchy the less are Nazi
rules and ideals observed. The
Countess often asked German offi
cers and diplomats who were friend
ly to her if they weren't afraid of
being seen with a Jewess. The an
swer was always, "Oh, that's only
for the common people."

All in all, "Athene Palace" is an
"ATHENE PALACE." by Countess Waldeck.
In the last decade there has grown up in American literature a highly
popular type of non-fiction hest described as the "descriptive" or "inside
dope" type of book, in which the author, usually a foreign correspondent
aiming for literary rather than journalistic fame, gives his version of that

elusive and often highly obvious
thing which Americans are ever
grasping for—the "real" reason, the
"inside" story, the behind-the-scenes
action which according to American
thought is to be found lurking be
hind every news event.

The latest addition to this collec
tion is "Athene Palace," in which
Countess Waldeck, of whom more
later, serves up the insidest inside
story yet, spiced with risque stories
about German and Balkan diplomats
and their highly naughty doings,
written in the excellent descriptive
style of the practiced raconteur, and
containing surprisingly impartial and
profound reflections on the spread of
the New Order in Balkan Europe.

excellent book. It is one of the few
"interpretive" books not obscured by
anti-Nazi emotional gymnastics, and
it has the added attraction of being
written by someone whose sources
are at least a little more "in the
know" than Propaganda Ministry
publications and General Staff com
muniques.—R. D. Monahan

Countess Waldeck, a German
born Jewess who after a highly ex
citing life among what disgruntled
American editors like to call the
"fast international set" got herself a
job as correspondent for an Ameri
can newspaper, arrived in Bucharest
the day Paris fell. Staying at the
Athene Palace, "the last Grand Ho
tel in Europe," she surveyed with
experienced eyes the muscling-in of
the Nazis in Rumanian affairs, the
fall of Carol and Lupescu and the
rise and fall of the Guardist (Ru
manian Fascist) regime, the frenzied
but futile attempts of the English to
keep Rumanian friendship, and fi
nally the complete taking over of
the country by the German mili
tary.

Through her obvious ability to get
along famously with diplomats and
military leaders, and her evident ac
quaintance with a host of spies, po
litical mercenaries and just gossip
ers that abound so in the Balkans,
the Countess tells the most highly
convincing of the "inside" stories yet
to appear on the market.

Whether the Countess' sources are
authentic and her conclusions wise
we do not attempt to say, but her
reasoning certainly impresses one as
much more intelligent than, for in
stance, the nasty and hatred-ridden
mouthings of William Shirer in
"Berlin Diary" do.
Here, briefly, are three of the
more interesting points of "Athene
Palace":
(1) Germans, far from being the
perfect model of efficiency and plan
ning in their diplomacy, at times
"muddle through" with much more
stupidity than the British. A good
example of this was their handling
of the Rumanian-Hungarian bound
ary quarrel, where they forced a de
cision highly unfavorable to both
sides on the participants and
brought about the very thing they
did not want — unrest and finally

manian Fascist) regime, the frenzied
but futile attempts of the English to
keep Rumanian friendship, and fi
nally the complete taking over of
the country by the German mili
tary.

Through her obvious ability to get
along famously with diplomats and
military leaders, and her evident ac
quaintance with a host of spies, po
litical mercenaries and just gossip
ers that abound so in the Balkans,
the Countess tells the most highly
convincing of the "inside" stories yet
to appear on the market.

Whether the Countess' sources are
authentic and her conclusions wise
we do not attempt to say, but her
reasoning certainly impresses one as
much more intelligent than, for in
stance, the nasty and hatred-ridden
mouthings of William Shirer in
"Berlin Diary" do.
Here, briefly, are three of the
more interesting points of "Athene
Palace":
(1) Germans, far from being the
perfect model of efficiency and plan
ning in their diplomacy, at times
"muddle through" with much more
stupidity than the British. A good
example of this was their handling
of the Rumanian-Hungarian bound
ary quarrel, where they forced a de
cision highly unfavorable to both
sides on the participants and
brought about the very thing they
did not want — unrest and finally
revolution in a "supply" state which
they wanted above all things to keep
quiet and efficient.

(2) The Nazis are far more inter
ested in puppet governments that
keep order than in '"pure fascist"
governments, and in fact often at
tempt to discourage "junior" fascist
movements when they interfere with
German plans. A good example of
this is their treatment of the Guard
ists in Rumania. The latter, although
fascist, were of course very nation
alistic, and said in effect "To hell
with the communists and the Ger
mans too." When the Guardists got
too frisky for big brother fascists in
Germany, the Nazis kicked them out.

(3) That the higher up you get in
the Nazi hierarchy the less are Nazi
rules and ideals observed. The
Countess often asked German offi
cers and diplomats who were friend
ly to her if they weren't afraid of
being seen with a Jewess. The an
swer was always, "Oh, that's only
for the common people."

"ATHENE PALACE." by Countess Waldeck.
In the last decade there has grown up in American literature a highly
popular type of non-fiction hest described as the "descriptive" or "inside
dope" type of book, in which the author, usually a foreign correspondent
aiming for literary rather than journalistic fame, gives his version of that

elusive and often highly obvious
thing which Americans are ever
grasping for—the "real" reason, the
"inside" story, the behind-the-scenes
action which according to American
thought is to be found lurking be
hind every news event.

The latest addition to this collec
tion is "Athene Palace," in which
Countess Waldeck, of whom more
later, serves up the insidest inside
story yet, spiced with risque stories
about German and Balkan diplomats
and their highly naughty doings,
written in the excellent descriptive
style of the practiced raconteur, and
containing surprisingly impartial and
profound reflections on the spread of
the New Order in Balkan Europe.

excellent book. It is one of the few
"interpretive" books not obscured by
anti-Nazi emotional gymnastics, and
it has the added attraction of being
written by someone whose sources
are at least a little more "in the
know" than Propaganda Ministry
publications and General Staff com
muniques.—R. D. Monahan

Countess Waldeck, a German
born Jewess who after a highly ex
citing life among what disgruntled
American editors like to call the
"fast international set" got herself a
job as correspondent for an Ameri
can newspaper, arrived in Bucharest
the day Paris fell. Staying at the
Athene Palace, "the last Grand Ho
tel in Europe," she surveyed with
experienced eyes the muscling-in of
the Nazis in Rumanian affairs, the
fall of Carol and Lupescu and the
rise and fall of the Guardist (Ru
manian Fascist) regime, the frenzied
but futile attempts of the English to
keep Rumanian friendship, and fi
