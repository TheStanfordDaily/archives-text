# Union Report Shows Profit
## Committee Outlines Financial Conditions 
### 
Although there was a decrease in
profits of the Stanford Union of
approximately 45 per cent below the
1941 figure, in general a net profit
was shown in the financial condition
of the Union, it was reported by Pro
fessor William B. Owens at the last
meeting of the executive committee
of the Union. In 1941 the total profit,
to this date, was $12,840.54; in 1942,
the profit was $7,325.88.
PROBLEMS ARISING
Problems arising out of certain
retrenchment policies were dis
cussed. Complaints were reported
with respect to the policy of distrib
uting napkins and of serving milk in
the bottle without a glass. It de
veloped that these complaints on the
part of students were caused more
from a misunderstanding of condi
tions l'ather than from any disap
proval of the policy. As a result, the
student members of the Board were
appointed as a committee for per
sonalizing the Union as much as
possible. The members of this com
mittee are George Jackson, Law
rence Grannis, Jim McKellar, and
Harold Shafer.
Suggestions with respect to pub
licity on Union policies before they
are put into practice, on the finan
cial statement of the Union, and for
a trophy room for displays of ath
letic awards in different parts of the
Union, were all presented. The stu
dent committee was directed to sub
mit a report at the next regular
meeting of the Board.
MEMORIAL HALL SUGGESTED
The suggestion of carrying the ob
ligation in connection with Memo
rial Hall as an operating expense in
the financial statement of the Union
was discussed. It was generally
agreed that, if possible, some plan
of this kind should be worked out.
The next regular meeting will be
tomorrow.
