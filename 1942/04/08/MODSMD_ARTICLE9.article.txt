# Sedley Peck To Discuss French Fall
## Fifth Column Work Provides Subject For Today's Lecture 
### 
"What Happened in France" is
the lecture which Major Sedley
Peck, journalist, traveler, and Stan
ford graduate, will give this after
noon at 4:15 in the Auditorium of
the Education Building.
Major Peck was in the midst of
the collapse of the French Army and
nation in May and June of 1940. He
observed the destruction of armies
and cities by aerial bomb, panzer
power, and "Fifth Column" activity
which provides background for his
subject.
Graduating from Stanford in 1913,
Major Peck served as an ambulance
driver in World War I, an aviator,
and a newspaper correspondent for
the New York Herald Tribune.

Though an accomplished pilot,
Major Peck enrolled in the glider
school in Germany in 1924, where
he learned aviation secrets of the
German Air Force. Immediately
upon the publication of his disclos
ures, he was expelled from Ger
many. He returned in 1935, how
ever, to interview Hitler.

Major Peck is at present serving
as consultant to the Secretary of
War. He has been assigned to the
duty of going to the different army
training camps and officers' schools
to tell what happened and why in
the last days of France.

The lecture is open to the entire
student body. Students enrolled in
Professor Graham Stuart's course
on "Problems of War and Peace"
will attend Major Peck's lecture, it
was announced by Professor Stuart.
