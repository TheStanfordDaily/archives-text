### CYCLONE COVEY 
Streamlined with a new outdoor layout, featuring hetter-than-ever

PLENTY OF GAMES
Popcorn, hot dogs, ice cream,
cokes, even candied apples, will

throw, nail driving, darts at balloons,
ling loss, bingo, break the record,
kill the Jap—everything in the carni
val catalog.
In the outside booths on the hand
ball courts, fraternity pledges will
enjoy a grueling evening. They will
gel eggs splashed in their hair, to
matoes splattered in their faces —
they will get dunked in water, they
will shiver in their shorts.
