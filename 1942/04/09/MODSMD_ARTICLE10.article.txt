# 'Just Lucky' Explains Tarver Award Winner
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Joseph Evarts Procter Morin said he was "just lucky."
And most students would agree with Joe. for he was just awarded the
Tarver Scholarship—free tuition, room, and hoard at a South American
university for a year.
Maybe Joe was "just lucky," hut more likely the Interfraternity Coun-

cil recognized his peculiar "savoir
faire" and his outstanding ability
when they awarded him the schol
arship.
SAVOIII FAIRE'
Joe's peculiar "savoir faire" comes
from a very unusual background —
which includes a trip around the
world, another jaunt to Australia
and New Zealand, and one summer
in Mexico.
From his travels and reading, Joe
has piled up a lot of knowledge. He
can talk, profusely, about almost any
subject.
Joe came to Stanford from Pasa
dena Junior College as a second
quarter freshman in 1939. Since
then he has been active in speech,
publications, and sports, as sopho
more football manager.
BETA NOMINATION
Joe was nominated by his Beta
fraternity brothers for the Tarver
Scholarship, and was selected for the
award by Interfraternity Board of
Control last Monday night.
But Joe is worried about one
thing—he doesn't know if he'll be
able to take advantage of the schol
arship and study in South America.
"You see," said Joe, "I've got a
Reserve Officer's Commission and I
may be called into active service in
July."
DIPLOMATIC WORK
Joe hopes to go into foreign serv
ice after the war, and thinks a year
in South America would be excel
lent training for diplomatic work.
Joe says his Spanish is "desola
torily fluent," and he's sure he'll en
joy South America except for te
quila, which, he says, "tastes like
tar paper boiled up in turpentine."

Tarver Scholarship—free tuition, room, and hoard at a South American
university for a year.
Maybe Joe was "just lucky," hut more likely the Interfraternity Coun-

cil recognized his peculiar "savoir
faire" and his outstanding ability
when they awarded him the schol
arship.
SAVOIII FAIRE'
Joe's peculiar "savoir faire" comes
from a very unusual background —
which includes a trip around the
world, another jaunt to Australia
and New Zealand, and one summer
in Mexico.
From his travels and reading, Joe
has piled up a lot of knowledge. He
can talk, profusely, about almost any
subject.
Joe came to Stanford from Pasa
dena Junior College as a second
quarter freshman in 1939. Since
then he has been active in speech,
publications, and sports, as sopho
more football manager.
BETA NOMINATION
Joe was nominated by his Beta
fraternity brothers for the Tarver
Scholarship, and was selected for the
award by Interfraternity Board of
Control last Monday night.
But Joe is worried about one
thing—he doesn't know if he'll be
able to take advantage of the schol
arship and study in South America.
"You see," said Joe, "I've got a
Reserve Officer's Commission and I
may be called into active service in
July."
DIPLOMATIC WORK
Joe hopes to go into foreign serv
ice after the war, and thinks a year
in South America would be excel
lent training for diplomatic work.
Joe says his Spanish is "desola
torily fluent," and he's sure he'll en
joy South America except for te
quila, which, he says, "tastes like
tar paper boiled up in turpentine."
