# Peck Tells Of France's Subjugation
## Nazis Use Organized Terrorism to Soften Nations for Invasion 
### AL HAMPSON 
"Germany has a secret weapon—
terror — organized terror," Major
Sedley Peck yesterday stated to an
audience that overflowed the Edu
cation Building Auditorium and was
moved to the Memorial Hall Audi
torium.
Major Peek said that since Novem
ber 12, "the day after the armistice
of the first part of the war," the Ger
mans have been spreading the myth
about the superiority of their arms
and culture.
''The population of the countries
they have invaded was softened up
and was ready to run," Major Peck
stated. He went on to explain that
the Russians were able to resist the
Germans because this myth had
never penetrated tSalin's iron ring
of censorship.
NAZI PREPARATION
Major Peck showed how the com
plete preparation of the Germans
was evident everywhere. The terror
spread with the refugees and helped
the Germans in three ways: (1) it
emptied the cities for them to oc
cupy; (2) it left unused supplies for
the on-coming Germans; and (3) it
choked the roads, hampering French
military movements.
In reference to the German might
that poured into France on May 14,
he said, "all the armies in the world
could have lined up and not have
stopped them."
FRENCH LOSSES lIIGII
The casualties in the 28 days dur
ing which France fell were two and
one-half as large as the A.E.F. cas
ualties during the 18 months that
America was a deciding influence in
the last war.
In conclusion Major Peck said that
the pitiful American was the person
who complacently says, "It can't
happen here."
To this Major Peck emphatically
shouted, "Like hell it can't."
