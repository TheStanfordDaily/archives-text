# Stace Join Summer Staff
## Philosopher, Writer Appointed to Faculty 
### 
Dr. Walter Terrence Stace—phi
losopher, winner of the Reynal-
Hitchcock $2,500 prize for the out
standing book on ideas published
during 1941, former mayor of Co
lombo, Ceylon, author of four out
standing books on philosophy—joins
the faculty of Stanford University
for the summer quarter.
Graduate of Trinity College, Dub
lin, Ireland and since 1932 professor
of philosophy at Princeton, Dr. Stace
recently published "The Destiny of
Western Man," an examination of
the conflict of ideas between totali
tarian states and democracies.
VAN DOREN JUDGES
Carl Van Doren, Henry Seidel
Canby, and William Allan Neilson
composed the board of judges which
picked Stace as the winner of the
Reynal award. Van Doren, perhaps
the most noted historian in America
today, terms Stace as a man who
"has written a book of world-wide
significance, sure to leave its mark
on years to come."
Stanford will know Stace as acting
professor of philosophy for the sum
mer quarter. Colombo, Ceylon, knew
him as its mayor and controller of
revenue for 22 years, from 1912 to
1932.
The publishing world knows him
as an outstanding student of phi
losophy, the author of "A Critical
History of Greek Philosophy," in
1920; "The Philosophy of Hegel" in
1924; "The Meaning of Beauty" in
1924; "The Theory of Knowledge
and Existence" in 1932; "The Con
cept of Morals" in 1937; and "The
Nature of the World" in 1940.
N Y. TIMES REVIEW
But the high point of a cosmo
politan, brilliant career is reached in
(he "Destiny of Western Man." The
New York Times reviews the Stace
prize-winner as a book which
"would be superb at any time, but
at this juncture, when two ways of
life are in conflict—moreover, when
it is generally agreed that both can
not exist side by side — Professor
Stace's exposition of the rival sys
tems is doubly welcome. It is the
richest sort of contribution to litera
ture of the ideology of democracy;
perhaps, indeed, stands alone as a
basic book."
