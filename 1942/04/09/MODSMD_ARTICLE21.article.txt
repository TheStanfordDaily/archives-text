## Wainwright's Men Lose Heavily As Invaders Use Fresh Shock Troops Supported by Swarms of Aircraft BULLETIN

LOS ANGELES, April 8 (UP). —A blackout was
ordered in Southern California tonight by military au
thorities, presumably because of the suspected presence
of unidentified planes in the region.

WASHINGTON, April 8 (UP-.—The most sustained and
savage drive of the bloody 13ataan Peninsula campaign raged
through its fifth day unabated tonight, with American-Fili
pino forces warding off from new defensive positions waves
of Japanese attacking by land, sea and air.
From the wording of the communique, reporting the situ
ation as of 4 p.m. EWT, it appeared that the Japanese had
been unable, temporarily at least, to pierce the new defense

positions.
There was no call for optimism, however, because Ameri
can-Filipino losses admittedly have been heavy and there was
no knowing how long their supplies, which must have been
severely drained in the last several days, would hold out.

Supporting relays of fresh Japanese shock troops smash
ing'into the line were swarms of planes—dive and level bomb
ers and other attack craft—which bombed and machine
gunned front-line troops and dumped high explosives on the
defenders' rear and the peninsula terminus of their supply
line from Corregidor fortress.
