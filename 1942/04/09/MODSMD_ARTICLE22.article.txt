# Marshall Flies to Britain
## 
### 
LONDON, April 8 UP). — Gen.
George C. Marshall, United States
Army chief of staff, and Harry L.
Hopkins, administrator of American
war supplies, flew into England in a
bomber today and held an urgent
conference with Prime Minister
Churchill, heightening the impression
that the Allies were preparing to
strike a sudden blow against Ger
many.
Marshall said President Roosevelt
had entrusted them with a "highly
confidential" mission, and remarked
that "we want to expand" in Europe.
Hopkins told of a rapid movement
of U.S. supplies to Russia and noted
that America was pouring war sup
plies to all places "where the Japs
and Germans can be killed."
That was the only encouragement
they gave British "second front" ad
vocates, but it set off a new flood
of speculation over the possibility
that some plan was being worked
out to beat Hitler to the offensive, to
hit his armies where it would hurt
most and where it would be most
likely to succeed.

Marshall's known leaning toward
an offensive strategy and Hopkins'
reference to killing Japs and Ger
mans, a statement almost identical
with that made today by Adm. Wil
liam H. Standley, new U.S. ambassa
dor to Russia, who said "the best
way to help Britain is to help the
Russians kill Germans," were seized
upon by British commentators as
indications of a forthcoming offen
sive.
Invasion of Europe would mean
Britain would have to use troops
now manning her coastal defenses,
leaving them in the hands of civil
ians who have been practicing nights
and Sundays in tank-busting and
grenade throwing tactics. It would
mean, too, that the United States
would have to be in position to as
sure a great surge of manpower to
follow up the initial attack.
In that connection, it was believed
significant that representatives of
three U.S. armed services accompa
nied Marshall on the trip. After a
two-hour conference with Churchill
this afternoon, Marshall and Hop
kins dined with him tonight.

grenade throwing tactics. It would
mean, too, that the United States
would have to be in position to as
sure a great surge of manpower to
follow up the initial attack.
In that connection, it was believed
significant that representatives of
three U.S. armed services accompa
nied Marshall on the trip. After a
two-hour conference with Churchill
this afternoon, Marshall and Hop
kins dined with him tonight.
LONDON, April 8 UP). — Gen.
George C. Marshall, United States
Army chief of staff, and Harry L.
Hopkins, administrator of American
war supplies, flew into England in a
bomber today and held an urgent
conference with Prime Minister
Churchill, heightening the impression
that the Allies were preparing to
strike a sudden blow against Ger
many.
Marshall said President Roosevelt
had entrusted them with a "highly
confidential" mission, and remarked
that "we want to expand" in Europe.
Hopkins told of a rapid movement
of U.S. supplies to Russia and noted
that America was pouring war sup
plies to all places "where the Japs
and Germans can be killed."
That was the only encouragement
they gave British "second front" ad
vocates, but it set off a new flood
of speculation over the possibility
that some plan was being worked
out to beat Hitler to the offensive, to
hit his armies where it would hurt
most and where it would be most
likely to succeed.

Marshall's known leaning toward
an offensive strategy and Hopkins'
reference to killing Japs and Ger
mans, a statement almost identical
with that made today by Adm. Wil
liam H. Standley, new U.S. ambassa
dor to Russia, who said "the best
way to help Britain is to help the
Russians kill Germans," were seized
upon by British commentators as
indications of a forthcoming offen
sive.
Invasion of Europe would mean
Britain would have to use troops
now manning her coastal defenses,
leaving them in the hands of civil
ians who have been practicing nights
and Sundays in tank-busting and
grenade throwing tactics. It would
mean, too, that the United States
would have to be in position to as
sure a great surge of manpower to
follow up the initial attack.
