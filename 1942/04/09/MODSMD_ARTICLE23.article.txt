# Moslems Reject Proposal
## 
### 
LONDON, April 8 UP).—lndia's
Moslem League has joined the All-
India Congress Party in rejecting
Britain's self-government proposals
unless the Indians received full
control immediately of their coun
try's defenses, New Delhi dispatches
said tonight.
The action clouded anew the out
look for Sir Stafford Cripps' tortu
ous mission of getting these two
major political groups to accept the
British proposals and mobilize Indian
manpower and material resources to
help win the war.
Hope for a settlement had revived
earlier when it was learned the Con
gress working committee, guided by
war-worried Pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru, was evolving a new formula
on defense control. Details were not
disclosed, but it was described as
probably acceptable to Britain. Me
diation by Louis Johnson, President
Roosevelt's personal envoy in India,

was said to have played an importaht
part in making it possible.
The Moslem League's decision
dampened this hope, however, for
there was no assurance that the Mos
lems would accept the new Congress
formula, believed to be a compro
mise. It also was questionable
whether Britain would dare risk
Moslem antagonism by putting its
plan into effect without the league's
endorsement, even though the Con
gress Party alone has a dominating
position in Indian politics.
Aside from this uncertainty, the
resolution of the league's working
committee on the British proposals
gave unexpected ground for closer
co-operation with the Congress
Party. It was understood to reject
the provision for secession of one or
more provinces from the Indian un-
I ion if majorities of their peoples be
[ licved that the constitution to be
adopted after the war did not safe
| guard them adequately from Hindu
domination.
