# '45 Baseball Nine Prepares for Cal
## 
### 
With only three losses in ten
starts behind them, Harry Shipkey's
frosh nine will meet the University
of California Cubs Saturday on the
Sunken Diamond.
High point of the frosh season has
been the better-than-the-varsity
pitching of Doc Mason and Bill Bro
kaw, right-handers whose twirling
has spelled defeat for some of the
best high school nines along the
Bay. The pitching corps will in
crease even more in strength when
a newcomer, Bill Brodie, leaves the
warm-up ranks.
Roster of the Encina nine in
cludes Banks or Moulton, catchers;
Mason, Brokaw, pitchers; Curtis,
Boswell, first; Smith, second; Eliot,
short; Reinstaedt, third; and Boor
man, Caffal, Dawson, etc., in the out
field.

He who steals my purse steals
trash, wrote a philosopher. But he
who steals my tires steals cash.
