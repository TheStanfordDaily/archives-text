# Farm Drivers Help in Tire Conservation
## 
### BILL STEIF 
The national tire - conservation
program is having a marked effect
on Stanford driving habits. This is
the conclusion which The Daily has
drawn from an informal survey that
it has conducted during the last
three mornings.
Reporters were placed at the Toy- ;
on, Eating Club, Roble, Encina, and
Lagunita parking lots and at two j
strategic points along the Row a few
minutes before 8 and 9 a.m. classes
and from these spots were able to
observe any cars that drove off. '
These reporters also were able to
obtain brief statements from a num- ]
ber of trie people who were driving. '
WALK TO CLASS
Special emphasis was placed upon
the early morning times because it is
at those times that most individuals
have classes, and it is a special aim ;
of the Stanford tire-conservation
program to persuade Stanford men
and women to save their rubber by
walking to classes, particularly since i
there is no large living group at j
Stanford which is further than a 12-
or 14-minute walk to any part of
the Quad.
It was discovered that, contrary to
| some expectations, Farm students '
' are co-operating fairly well. The
! great majority of students who own
automobiles apparently are leaving :
! their cars idle. At 8 a.m., Tuesday,
in front of Encina, for instance, only
.1 out of 65 cars moved. The situa
tion up the Row was not quite so '
rosy, a number of the cars coming
down from the upper Row apparent- j
ly driving due to tardiness. The |
drivers tersely commented to the in- j
vestigator that spoke to them, "Late
â€”can't stop."
LOW PERCENTAGES
At the Roble, Lagunita, Toyon and I
Eating Club parking lots the per- |
cent,age of cars driving off at 8 and I
9 a.m. never exceeded 14 or 16 per|
cent, and was in several cases much I
j lower. There were, for instance, no
cars driven from the Toyon parking
; lot at 8 a.m. Tuesday.
Many of those driving gave as their j
\ excuses recent illnesses.
There were a number of cases,
I however, in which the use of auto- j
mobiles appeared unjustified, such i
i as the comment by one Branner man i
to the effect that he had "to get J
dov/n to see his bookie before 9 !
o'clock," or the remark dropped by
the Lagunita woman that she "just |
hated to walk."
