Bear Hurler allowed but three scat

pitching attempt, walking the first

poured seven runs across the plate
before Wilson was lifted for Dyck.
Dyck finished the game.
The Cards committed five errors
afield and lost all the zip they had in
trimming Uela Tuesday, 10-4.
The only Indians to get bingles
off Ruonavaara were Ted Nell. Dyck,
and Carl Kellenberger, all of the
one-base variety.
