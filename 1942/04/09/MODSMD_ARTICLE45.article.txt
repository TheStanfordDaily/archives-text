# Card Netmen Set to Meet Bruins, Troy
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis team
leaves for Los Angeles tonight where
they will make their bid for the con
ference tennis crown by meeting
Southern California twice and
U.C.L.A. once, The Trojan matches
will be held Friday afternoon and
Saturday morning and the Bruin
match on Saturday afternoon.
The Indians head south with their
record perfectly clean, having de
feated U.C.L.A. 8-0 last week-end.
The Bruins have as yet to win a
match, but the Trojans have split
with the University of California
and have defeated the Bruins twice
and are in second place behind Stan
ford.
The Indians should sweep all three
of the matches, according to past
records and performances. The Tro
jans this year are not up to the
standard of past years' teams. Be
sides Ted Olewine. the nation's 11th
ranking singles player, and Bill
Reedy, the Trojans are desperately
weak.

The most popular female radio
singer for 1940 was Kate Smith.
Dinah Shore was runner-up.
