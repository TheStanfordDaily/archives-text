THE maintenance of crew as a Stanford sport
at a time when athletic plans are all being
radically changed is not out of place as many
people hastened to assume when a tentative
schedule for the season was announced yes
terday.
Crew has had a precarious career here since
its revival two years ago. Denied recognition
as a regular part of the sports program, the
activity cast around for means of support. Fi
nally, the men who fought to bring this grand
sport back to Stanford, after something like 20
years, were forced to back the venture them
selves.
They did not let pride interfere with their
interest. They accepted a shell and oars from
bitter rivals across the bay who were anxious
to build up the interest in a sport at which they
excelled. Not only did the Stanford crew men
make this sacrifice; they went to work on their
own scow and shed.
Crew is not cramping the style of any other
sport. It has no place on the budget and robs
no other sport of any important athletes. At a
time like this, crew should be in the vanguard
of the sports parade. It is tops for physical
conditioning and has a practical value possessed
by few other sports. As a matter of fact, college
rowing deserves a nod of encouragement and
approval from the Navy Department itself.—
