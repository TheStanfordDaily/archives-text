# For Efficiency's Sake
## 
### 
ONE of these days, America may get to the
point where it is willing to sacrifice a
little of its super-humane policy for some prac
tical efficiency.
Ideals are fine in peacetime. You can't hang
on to your ideals and fight successfully some
one who has junked his, at least for the time
being. If a man uses brass knuckles on you,
you don't hesitate to use your elbow and your
knee. In this war today, America is being far
too humane and fair. If we are afraid of losing
ideals for all time by temporarily setting them
aside, then we need only modify the rules we
are operating on now.
In a lecture yesterday we heard the way in
which Russia handled the fifth-column problem.
The Soviets have not experienced such fifth
column disasters as the French did. At the be
ginning of the war with Germany, Russia merely
rounded up all possible suspects and shot them/
Here in the United States we round up possible
fifth-columnists, build new homes for them, feed
them better than most of them ate before, clothe
them, and actually pay them a salary! That's
humane; it is not efficient. And efficiency, not
humaneness, wins the war.
Certainly we do not relish the idea of adopting
the European methods of efficiency for ordinary
life; but during the war we may well profit from
the visible results achieved by cold efficiency
in Russia and Germany.â€”Hap Everett
