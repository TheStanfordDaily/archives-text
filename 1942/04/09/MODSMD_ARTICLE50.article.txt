# Carillon Succumbs
## 
### 
IT is with deep regret that we are forced to
write the obituary of the Stanford Carillon,
last in a long line of campus literary magazines,
which succumbed by action of Publications
Council and Ex Committee Tuesday.
The Carillon has ably satisfied for a year the
need for a magazine of its type, and it is particu
larly hard to see it go when its founders worked
so hard to inaugurate it and keep its books in
the black. It was the judgment of Publications
Council and of Excom that it would be an im
possibility for the magazine to stay out of the
red next year, due to increased costs and de
creased advertising during wartime, and that
even the cost of a spring issue this year would
leave it in the red.
We hope there will again be the demand for
a magazine of its type after the war is over,
and its chances of revival at that time should be
stronger because it has stopped with a clean
record at this time. To its founder, Cab Burley,
and its present retiring editor, Charley Bull,
the campus owes its thanks for their contribu
tions to the campus literary field.
