### AMIE REICHERT 
[VOW it begins to look as though the inevitable is
about to happen. Now it begins to look as though
the Philippines will at last fall to the invading Japa
nese. For months we have all known that it was only
a matter of time, and now it appears that Yamashita
has called "Time's up."
The reports all tell the same story. Wainwright's
lines are weakening under tremendous assault by Japa
nese heavy artillery and dive bombers. The actual at
tack, which was preceded by days of heavy bombing,
began last Saturday and has grown in fury ever since.
Now it looks as though the Battle of Bataan has
reached its crucial stage. And it looks as though the
American-Filipino forces are losing that battle.
If Wainwright's lines crack, he can, of course, fall
back to the Corregidor fortress. But with the whole
island of Luzon in enemy hands, the chances are that
there won't be very much he can do except sit and
wait with watchful anti-aircraft for the enemy bomb
ers to come over.
The U.S. still controls most of the island of Min
danao (all but the southern edge) and the little islands
of Cebu, Negros, and Panay in the Visayan Sea. But
in all probability, we will not be able to maintain these
positions once the men of Bataan are no longer there
to keep the Japanese busy.

lUST what will the loss of Bataan, let us say the
loss of the whole Philippine island group, mean
to the Allied war effort?
It does not seem to me that the actual loss of those
islands is in itself a tragedy at the moment, coming
as it does when the whole surrounding area is under
complete Japanese domination. The loss is rather a
strategic one, and by that I mean this: the value of the
stubborn resistance of Bataan's defenders has been that
they are fighting what taken in its proper perspective
amounts to a delaying action. They are engaging the
enemy's first-class general, and some of his first-class
men and guns and planes, and as long as Bataan
holds out the Japanese cannot use these forces, else
where.
But if the islands go, Yamashita will be able to
turn his attention to greener pastures elsewhere. And
the result will probably be an increase in the attacks
upon India and/or Australia.
This I think is what the loss of the Philippines
means. I do not think we must mourn that we have
lost a valuable potential base for an offensive. Japan
still has complete initiative, she controls the entire
area surrounding the Philippines, and this factor makes
it virtually impossible to get supplies and men into
the islands.
Further-more, it would seem that the Philippines
aren't going to be very valuable bases for the Japa
nese either. They already have bases in Burma and
Thailand and Malaya which are much closer to India,
and bases in the Dutch Indies which are closer to
Australia.
Two crucial questions emerge out of all -this: How
much Japanese power will the loss of the Philippines
release to be turned elsewhere? And how effective
has the scorched earth been in the Philippinesâ€”i.e.,
what will they get out of the islands?
