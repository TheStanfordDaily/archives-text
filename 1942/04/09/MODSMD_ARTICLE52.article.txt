# BULL SESSION

### MIKE CHURCHILL 
CARNIVAL
Forty-four
Enjoys the War;
And would like you
To enjoy it too.
Go one, go all
To the Carnival;
Have loads of funs,
Forget the guns,
And fork out your dough
To help the kiddies grough
healthy.
Inspired, isn't it? Inspired, in fact, by those thought
provoking stickers that appeared yesterday morning on
the windshields of campus vehicles.
While it is perhaps too much to expect that the
Soph Carnival can make the war enjoyable, it can
make it a little less disagreeable for one evening and
for a worthy cause. War or no war, the underprivi
leged, especially the children, need help, our help. The
Soph Carnival starts the ball rolling for the all-im
portant Convalescent Home Drive which will go on
all next week.
There is a heavy emphasis on sadism in many of
the proposed concessions. If there is some freshman
whom you despise, chanoes are that he will be at the
back of one of the many "throw" booths. If you pos
sess reasonable accuracy this will be your opportu
nity to smear him with a tomato or egg, or douse him
with water.
If a Dee Gee or Kappa pledge has spurned you,
you can disfigure her Friday with a water gun or a
cold sponge. Unquestionably it will be a lot of fun.
Food and drink will be available for a price. The
Alpha Delts will serve ice cream,â€”woo woo. The
Alpha Phis, I think, are going to dispense punch.
Roble is feeling the pinch of priorities. Upperclass
women, knowing that shortages of males are immi
nent, have held onto their men with stronger grasps
than usual. The result? Roble wants to get back in
there before the sophomore slump catches up with
them, so they are organizing a taxi dance at the Carni
val. For a most modest sum you males can meet,
dance with, and be entertained by a Robleite. Their
slogan: "Gamble a dime; have yourself a time."
