TIIE ROUGH IS NOT HEAI)

EDITOR, SIR:
They say (with a tear in their eye and a catch
in their throat) that the clay of the Stanford Rough is
dead. We have become (they mutter over their cokes)
effete and decadent. Encina (they lament) has suc
cumbed to a Venetian-blind, two-inch-deep rug sort
of civilization. Thus the lying rumor spreads, and the
name of Stanford Rough is relegated to the abode of
happy memory.
I protest. Sir, it is not true. Stanford still breeds up
a type of man whom "Rough" may well describe. And
lest a doubt still linger on the other side of the Quad,
I would submit the following remarkable communica
tion, received by our club secretary only yesterday,
and preserved with honor in our scrapbook:
"We do not open until May 15th. Your club has
always held their outing in advance of the opening
date. Usually in April. As a matter of fact we have re
cently thought of the approaching date for your outing
and wondered just how we would answer you should
you again desire to come here. We appreciate the fact
that it is all in the interest of a good time and arc the
last ones to dampen your ardor.
"On the other hand, we have our best interests also
to be served. The accommodations you boys get here
in the early spring are the ones that must please and
satisfy our most discriminating clientelle. It is not only
the best we have but also the best to be had in the en
tire River area and we resent unnecessary abuse.
Among other minor bits of destructiveness last season
were two wicker chairs that had broken legs."
