"LIFE WITH FATHER"—Now playing al the Geary.
Father was the "damnedest" man—literally. Six resounding "Oh
Gahd's!" and a prolificy of minor blasphemy were all Father needed to
rule over his family—or so he thought. Actually it was Mother who al
ways got her way, either by the usual woman's dodges, or, as a last re
sort, by the unanswerable feminine*.

argument of tears. "Men reason;
women just get stirred up," was
Father's plaint.
Clarence Day's story of family life
in the 1880's gives a painstakingly
accui'ate picture of the real Day
family, even down to the red hair
of Father, Mother, and the four sons;
the set fs so perfect a replica of the
living rooms of that day that a lesser
drama might well have found itself
playing second fiddle to the scenery.
Precocious youngsters are usually
a play's weak spot; but "Life With
Father," with four actors of teen
age or younger, is bolstered by their
performances. The sly smile that
breaks over the face of little Har
lan—played by Donald Hastings —
furnishes one of the show's best
scenes.
The cast's running out of the stiffly
posed "tin-type" curtain calls for
which they are famed attests to the
fine acting of "Mother" Margalo
Gillmore, the four sons, the parade
of Father-terrorized maids, and all
the rest of the cast, while the audi
ence's spontaneous comment, "Why,
he's just like my father," leaves no
doubt as to the realism of Percy
Waram's performance.

Father was the typical practical
businessman of the '80's, whose
church pew was just so much real
estate to be unloaded when the
market was high, and who thought
that Heaven needed an efficient man
like him around. Mother, when
asked if Father had ever been
thrown ofY a horse, aptly summed up
his character with the assurance,
"No horse would ever dare do that
to Father!"

Precocious youngsters are usually
a play's weak spot; but "Life With
Father," with four actors of teen
age or younger, is bolstered by their
performances. The sly smile that

The cast's running out of the stiffly
posed "tin-type" curtain calls for
which they are famed attests to the
fine acting of "Mother" Margalo
Gillmore, the four sons, the parade
of Father-terrorized maids, and all

Clarence Day's story of family life
in the 1880's gives a painstakingly
accui'ate picture of the real Day
family, even down to the red hair
of Father, Mother, and the four sons;

living rooms of that day that a lesser
