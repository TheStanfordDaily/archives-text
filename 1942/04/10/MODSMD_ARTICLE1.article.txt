# INDIAN GOVERNMENT PROBLEM SOLVED
## 
### 
NEW DELHI, April 9 (UP). —Britain and
India have reached a general agreement on a
self-government plan which will create the first
All-Indian National Government in two centu
ries and throw this nation solidly behind the
Allied war effort, it was revealed tonight.
The plan entrusts Indian defense matters to
a native government minister, except for war
strategy and tactics, which a British military
chief will control.
With only final details to be smoothed out,
formal announcement of the settlement was

predicted for late tomorrow or Saturday.
Under it would come into being an all-Indian
national government, to mobilize India to resist
the Japanese pressing closer in Burma and on
the Bay of Bengal. The the progress of nego
tiations appeared to be a great political victory
for the United Nations.
Louis Johnson, President Roosevelt's per
sonal envoy to India, who arrived here only a
week ago, was given an important share of the
credit for having made the agreement possible.
He met at noon today with Pandit Jawaharlal

Nehru, left-wing leader of the Congress party,
and Sir Stafford Cripps, British negotiator, re
portedly to divide the defense departments and
bureaus that would remain in the hands of the
British commander-in-chief during the war
from those to be taken over by an Indian de
fense minister in the projected national gov
ernment.
Silencing rumors of American intervention
in behalf of the Congress party, Nehru said in
a statement today that there was no wish for
intervention from any quarter.

"We have issued no appeal to anybody or
asked anyone's intervention," he said.
Still to be taken up was the problem of Mos
lem representation in the new government, in
which the Moslem League has demanded half
the portfolios. Informed quarters were confi
dent, however, that there would be no difficulty
or delay in establishing the government.
The new formula was understood to have
three main points:
1. The British government would agree to the
to the establishment of a national government

for India immediately.
2. The national government would control all
portfolios, including defense, in what is now
the Viceroy's Executive Council.
3. In view of critical war situation, the na
tional government would agree voluntarily to
let the powers and functions of departments
now under the control of the commander-in
chief remain with General Sir Archibald Wa
vell except for such matters as civil defense,
the raising of troops, but not the training or
equipping of them.

Nehru, left-wing leader of the Congress party,
and Sir Stafford Cripps, British negotiator, re
portedly to divide the defense departments and
bureaus that would remain in the hands of the
British commander-in-chief during the war
from those to be taken over by an Indian de
fense minister in the projected national gov
ernment.
Silencing rumors of American intervention
in behalf of the Congress party, Nehru said in
a statement today that there was no wish for
intervention from any quarter.

"We have issued no appeal to anybody or
asked anyone's intervention," he said.
Still to be taken up was the problem of Mos
lem representation in the new government, in
which the Moslem League has demanded half
the portfolios. Informed quarters were confi
dent, however, that there would be no difficulty
or delay in establishing the government.
The new formula was understood to have
three main points:
1. The British government would agree to the
to the establishment of a national government

for India immediately.
2. The national government would control all
portfolios, including defense, in what is now
the Viceroy's Executive Council.
3. In view of critical war situation, the na
tional government would agree voluntarily to
let the powers and functions of departments
now under the control of the commander-in
chief remain with General Sir Archibald Wa
vell except for such matters as civil defense,
the raising of troops, but not the training or
equipping of them.
NEW DELHI, April 9 (UP). —Britain and
India have reached a general agreement on a
self-government plan which will create the first
All-Indian National Government in two centu
ries and throw this nation solidly behind the
Allied war effort, it was revealed tonight.
The plan entrusts Indian defense matters to
a native government minister, except for war
strategy and tactics, which a British military
chief will control.
With only final details to be smoothed out,
formal announcement of the settlement was

predicted for late tomorrow or Saturday.
Under it would come into being an all-Indian
national government, to mobilize India to resist
the Japanese pressing closer in Burma and on
the Bay of Bengal. The the progress of nego
tiations appeared to be a great political victory
for the United Nations.
Louis Johnson, President Roosevelt's per
sonal envoy to India, who arrived here only a
week ago, was given an important share of the
credit for having made the agreement possible.
