"Blockade" was one of the first
pictures to disregard the European
market and boldly deal with a con
troversial subject. It was also one of
the very few films not of a propa
gandizing nature.
It marked the peak of Madeleine
Carroll's popularity, and is regarded
as her outstanding dramatic per
formance. She plays the role of an
international spy; Henry Fonda is
fighting for the other side. This

the showing will go to the Home.
Tickets may be purchased at the
