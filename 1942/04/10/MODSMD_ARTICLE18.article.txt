# Stanford, Cal, Mills to Hear 'Pop Concert'
## Forum to Take Loss To Sponsor Program In S.F. Sunday, 8:30 
### BETTY TREMAYNE 
Hundreds of Stanford, Cal, and
Mills students will attend the "Pop
Concert" sponsored by the Sym
phony Forum Sunday at 8:30 p.m.
in the San Francisco Opera House.
Enthusiastic music-goers will hear
a program of musical selections
which have been chosen on the basis
of their popular appeal played by
the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, directed by Pierre Montcux.
The program will include: Over
ture to "Die Meistersinger"; Tschai
kowsky's Fifth Symphony; "A Night
on Bald Mountain" by Moussorgsky;
"Clouds" and "Festivals" by De
bussy, and "Fete Polonaise" by Cha
brier.
FORUM'S FOURTH YEAR
The "Pop Concert" is the second
to be presented by the symphony
forum started at Cal four years
ago, Bob Hampton, chairman of the
affair, stated. The forum is made up
of hundreds of college members who
participate in the regular subscrip
tion concerts of the San Francisco
Symphony every year. It lias largely
been a spontaneous campus move
ment of those who take pleasure in
symphonic music.
Two meetings of the forum on the
Stanford campus have already been
held this year, one at the D.G. house
where Mr. and Mrs. Pierre Monteux
were guests; the other at the Thela
house where Rudolph Ganz and Al
exander Fried, San Francisco music
critics, were present.
OPERATES AT LOSS
The "Pop Concert" is taking a net
loss of $1500 so that average stu
dents may take pleasure in popular
symphonic works," Hampton said.
"Students should take advantage of
this great opportunity."
According to Ganz and Fried, who
praise the forum group on the work
which they arc doing in promoting
interest in classical music, "The in
fluence of (he forum on San Fran
cisco's musical life will be inesti
mable. By hearing music regularly
and devotedly, the campus listeners
will advance in discrimination. Their
enjoyment is an enjoyment that will
mean much to them all their lives
long."
Tickets are still on sale at the
A.S.S.U. office for 85 cents. They
are also being sold by Bruce Lyon,
Zete; Betty Boardman, Theta; Ted
Cole, El Toro; and Hoella Ford, Pi
Phi. Block tickets will be sold to
sororities, fraternities, and dorms.
