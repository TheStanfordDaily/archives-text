## Variety of Concessions to Mark '44's Show of Shows; Improved Layouts and Lighting New Feature 
### 
Five solid hours of festivity will commence in the Pavilion tonight at 7
when the sophomore show of shows cuts loose for the Convalescent Home.
Gorging hot clogs, twirling canes, shooting squirt guns, throwing eggs,
thousands will carouse and mill in the spirit of carnivaltime.
They will jitterbug in the taxi dance: they will watch Cuadro's re-

volving barrel; they will win raffles"
and throw pies; they will succumb
to Toro x'oulette.
Pi Phis will lure them to the bas
ketball throw, and Lagunita lassies
will entice them to pin ball ma
chines. They will kill the A.T.O.
Jap, drive Tri Dolt nails, and toss
Kappa sponges.
They will break S.A.E. records
and ring the D.U. duck. They will
eat Alpha Phi candied apples and
Delt mud pies. They will hit the
Beta chicken, heave Kappa Sig to
matoes, douse Chi Omega candles,
riddle Alpha Sigma targets, shoot
the Tigre arrows.
They will torture the outdoor
pledges, pepper the Chi Psi presi
dent, play bingo, see the Zete mys
tery booth, pitch pennies, win cigars,
guess weights, and just sit in the
bleachers and watch the crowd.
It will be a whale of an evening.
Improved layouts and lighting will
give the event a zest it never had
before. Barkers with megaphones,
sideshow signs, music, and gaudy
decorations will provide authentic
atmosphere. And the Con Home
Week's inauguration is a cinch
success.
