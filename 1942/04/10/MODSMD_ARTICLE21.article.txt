# Hanna Cites Need For Co-ordination
## 
### 
Paul R. Hanna, national resources
planning board consultant and
Stanford University education pro
fessor, last night recommended co
ordinated effort in providing services
necessary in rearing physically
sound and mentally alert young
Americans.
In an address before the Associa
tion for Childhood Education golden
jubilee convention in Buffalo, N.Y.,
Professor Hanna cited the nation's
"great gains" in health care, family
security, education, and recreation.
"Despite numerous federal and local
agencies concerned with the prob
lem," he said, "there is little or no
co-ordination among all these
groups, and as a result there is no
over-all planning to assure an ade
quate total program. We arc deter
mined at all costs to give more at
tention to the quality of our human
'seed corn'."
