# Corregidor Forts Fight To Stem Over whelming Tide of Sea-Borne Japs
## Fall of Bataan Defenders Leaves To Surrounding Islands Vital Task Of Maintaining Hold on Manila Bay 
### 
WASHINGTON, April !) (UP). —One of the most gallant stands in
L nited States history, the Battle of Bataan. came to its inevitable end
today—disease, short rations and exhaustion of the defenders giving to the
Japanese the victory their overwhelming numbers alone could not ac
complish.
Resistance of the .>(>,800 American-Filipino defenders, which continued

fa full three months after it had been
I believed they must be overwhelmed,
j had been termed a miracle by mili
j tary men. And they still were fight
; ing even as the Nipponese tide rolled
j over them.
How many were left when the last
j day came was not known, nor was
| it known how many could be evacu
: ated to Fort Mills, the big bastion on
! Corregidor Island in Manila Bay, or
| to the other smaller forts—Hughes,
I Frank and Drum.
RESISTANCE CONTINUES
i The big American guns of the
; forts still roared defiance, however,
j and it was plain that, for a while at
j least, their resistance would con
tinue.
Resistance also will continue from
the small, well-organized guerilla
groups operating against the Japa
nese on the island of Luzon and the
other islands of the Philippine archi
pelago reaching down 1,150 miles
into the South Pacific.
So long as Corregidor and the
other forts hold out, the Japanese
still will be denied the full use of
Manila Bay.
BACKBONE BROKEN
But there was no denying that the
backbone of Allied resistance in the
Philippines had at last lx?cn broken,
and a pall of gloom settled over the
Allied nations as they absorbed the
news.
The end came when the Japanese,
after weeks of costly failure, at last
succeeded in enveloping the Ameri
can-Filipino cast flank on the Manila
Bay side of the peninsula. Pre
sumably the envelopment was car
ried out by sea-borne troops landed
under protection of artillery-carry
ing barges. The defenders failed to
drive the invaders back due to "com
plete physical exhaustion of the
! troops," a War Department an
j nouncement said.
INEVITABLE GLOOM
"This situation indicates proba
bility that the defenses on Bataan
have been overcome," the announce
ment said.
Loss of the Philippines long ago
] had been written off militarily but
! that could not case the gloom, stif
| fened by determination for revenge,
i which greeted the final announce
! ment.
First news that the Bataan de
fenders had been overwhelmed came
in a War Department communique
at 5:15 a.m. Later, further details,
including events leading up to the
last days, were revealed at a press
conference by Secretary of War
Henry L. Stimson.
"Our troops, out-numbered, worn
down by attack, exhausted by in
sufficient rations and disease pre
vailing in that area, had their lines
broken and enveloped by the en
emy," Stimson said.
"There is nothing but praise for
the men who have so ably conducted
an epic chapter in the history of the
Philippines."
As President Rooseevlt and Gen
eral Mac Arthur had before him,
Stimson pledged that the Philip
pines would be regained.

"Our troops, out-numbered, worn

"There is nothing but praise for

WASHINGTON, April !) (UP). —One of the most gallant stands in

Resistance also will continue from
the small, well-organized guerilla
groups operating against the Japa
nese on the island of Luzon and the

into the South Pacific.

Allied nations as they absorbed the
news.
The end came when the Japanese,
after weeks of costly failure, at last
succeeded in enveloping the Ameri
