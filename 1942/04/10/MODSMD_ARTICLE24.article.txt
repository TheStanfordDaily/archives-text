## Two Fleets Mass in Bay of Bengal To Decide Fate of India, Ceylon 
### 
LONDON, April 9 fUP).—Japa
nese air missiles, probably torpe
does, have sunk the British heavy
cruisers Dorsetshire and Cornwall in
the Indian Ocean, and British and
Japanese fleets are massing in the
nearby Bay of Bengal for a far big
ger battle to decide the destiny of
Ceylon and India, British sources
said tonight.
There was every sign that the bat
tle might begin at any hour.
A powerful Biitish fleet was re
p< rtod sweeping the bay in search
of Japanese units, whose carrier
ba. • ;1 planes roamed the whole area.
The Japanese planes struck again
today at Ceylon, attacking the Trin
connlee naval base, and it was re
veille.J that they have sunk several
merchant ships.
S :?.( I! FOR FLEET
A ; Gen. Lewis 11. Brereton's In
dia b :. Ed American Flying Fort
ii" e . which have already blasted
new Japanese bases in Rangoon and
in the Andaman Islands, were be
lieved helping British planes and
war-hips in thojr search for ihe Jap
an* e fleet.
(Coincident with the attack on
Tnncomalee, a Japanese expedition
ary force landed on the Bay of
E ;r> <1 coast, according to a Radio
Ik r in report from Tokyo, which did
not specify whether the landing was
made in Burma, India, or on Ceylon.
A Japanese invasion force north of

Akyab in Burma was said to be only j
30 miles from the Indian frontier |
and driving toward Calcutta 275
miles to the west.)
LIGHT LOSS OF LIFE
The Dorsetshire—the cruiser which
applied the torpedo coup de grace
.o the German dreadnaught Bis
marck in the Atlantic—and the Corn
wall went down with comparatively
light loss of life, an Admiralty com
munique said. More than 1,100 men,
including Capt. S. W. S. Agar of the
Dorsetshire and Capt. P. C. W. Man
waring of the Cornwall, were re
ported picked up from (he combined
complement of 1,329 aboard the two
cruisers.
The Cornwall was a 10,000-ton
Kent class cruiser built in 1929 and
nounted eight eight-inch guns. The
Dorsetshire displaced 9,975 tons, was j
juilt in l'J2O and carried the same i
armament.
TORPEDOES CARRIED
The planes which sank them ap
parently were the same type tor— |
oedo-carrying craft that sent the ;
British battleships Prince of Wales
ind Repulse to the bottom off Ma
laya early in the war. Airplane car
riers ordinarily do not launch heavy
bombers.
Although British officials have
been extremely reticent about fleet
reinforcements in the Indian Ocean
irea, it v/as believed that loss of the
two cruisers would not seriously im
oair the strength of the big fleet re
oorted massed there. It was recalled
'hat. Rome Radio reported last week
'.hat a British armada including the
U,OOO-ton battleship Malaya had 1
'eft Gibraltar for the Indian theater.
CARRIER-BASED PLANES
Admiralty announcement that
carrier-based planes sank the cruis
ers was the first official acknowledge
ment that heavy Japanese warships
are operating in the Indian Ocean, j
(t was believed that the planes I
which attacked Ceylon today came
from the same carrier or carrier
squadron.
A dispatch from Colombo, Ceylon,
said first reports on the Trincomalee
aid indicated no civilian casualties.
Two enemy aircraft were sighted
over Colombo, where 57 of 75 raid
ers were destroyed or damaged last
Sunday, but no bombs were drop
ped. Anti-aircraft guns went into
action.
