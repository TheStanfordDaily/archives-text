the Committee on Public Exercises.
Dr. Wendt received his A.8., M.A.,
and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard. Since
then he has had a long and varied
career in science that well qualifies
him to discuss the scientific aspect
of modern war.
He has served as director of re
search for the Standard Oil Com
pany of Indiana and for the General
Printing Ink Corporation. Dr. Wendt
served as captain in the chemical
warfare division of the United
States Army during World War I.
According to Dr. Wendt the power
of Germany is based on her one re
source that remained intact after
Versaillesâ€”her research laboratories
and trained technical brains. He has
also stated that the most vital and
widest front of this war is in sci
ence, and here American forces are
fully engaged.

It is on this front that Dr. Wendt
reports as an experienced war cor
respondent.
