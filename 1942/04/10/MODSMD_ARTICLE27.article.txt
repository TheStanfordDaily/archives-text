### 
NEW YORK, April 9 (UP).—An
obscure 10-1 shot, M. A. Kern's Po
tranco, slid home to a slim triumph
in the 33rd running of the $7,500
Paunomok Handicap today a.s New
York's longest racing season was
formally launched at Jamaica against
! a weird background of snowflakes,
j picket lines and air raid wardens.
; While three Kentucky Derby el-i
-1 gibles—Redthorn, K. Borko and This
| England—were convincingly beaten
off in the day's feature events, Po
| tranco carried his canary and red
silks through the slop to a half
! length victory worth $7,000 to his
owner and $24 to his few backers in
1 the crowd of 13,557.
