# Students Indicate Reason For War in Nation-Wide Poll
## 
### 
This war is being fought by the '
United Nations for the same reason
I
usually given for lighting World j
War I, to preserve democracy, ac- >
cording to four out of every ten col- !
lege students who expressed their
views in a national sampling of
Student Opinion Surveys of America.
Taken on college campuses all
over the country, the poll reveals
that 40 per cent of the students, a
group rnor? than twice as large as
any other group giving a different
answer, believe that World War II
is being fought for the continuance
of democracy or, as some put it, "for
the Bill of Rights,'' or "for freedom
and liberty." Eighteen per cent, the
next largest group, think we are
fighting primarily to defeat the Axis
powers.
Interviewees were asked, "What
i would you say we are lighting for in
this war?" Without the influence of
any suggested possible answers,
these complete results shown in
eight different groupings were given:
j To preserve democracy 40%
To defeat the Axb IN%
For economic reasons 10%
Self-preservation '•)%
For England 4%
Because of Pearl Harbor .... 4%
i For a lasting peace 5%
Other reasons or no opinion. 10%
Many students, especially those
giving democracy as the reason for
j lighting, often qualified their answers

with "I guess," or "I suppose that's
it."
Four per cent of those interviewed
believe that we are fighting Eng
land's war. Their attitude is similar
to that of those who answered, "We
are fighting because of the Pearl

Harbor attack.
Reasons given the interviewers
were varied. One girl at Stephens
College in Missouri said frankly, "To
save our own necks; that's why." A
boy at another school said, "We are
fighting to finish what should have
been done in the last war."
Many gave "economic gains" as
the reason for the war, pointing out
Japan's need for the raw materials
in the Dutch East Indies and the
United States' determination to pre
serve them for this country."

answer, believe that World War II
is being fought for the continuance
of democracy or, as some put it, "for
the Bill of Rights,'' or "for freedom
and liberty." Eighteen per cent, the
next largest group, think we are
fighting primarily to defeat the Axis
powers.
Interviewees were asked, "What
i would you say we are lighting for in
this war?" Without the influence of
any suggested possible answers,
these complete results shown in
eight different groupings were given:
j To preserve democracy 40%
To defeat the Axb IN%
For economic reasons 10%
Self-preservation '•)%
For England 4%
Because of Pearl Harbor .... 4%
i For a lasting peace 5%
Other reasons or no opinion. 10%
Many students, especially those
giving democracy as the reason for
j lighting, often qualified their answers

with "I guess," or "I suppose that's
it."
Four per cent of those interviewed
believe that we are fighting Eng
land's war. Their attitude is similar
to that of those who answered, "We
are fighting because of the Pearl

Harbor attack.
Reasons given the interviewers
were varied. One girl at Stephens
College in Missouri said frankly, "To
save our own necks; that's why." A
boy at another school said, "We are
fighting to finish what should have
been done in the last war."
Many gave "economic gains" as
the reason for the war, pointing out
Japan's need for the raw materials
in the Dutch East Indies and the
United States' determination to pre
serve them for this country."
