To raise funds needed to adapt the
Convalescent Home to war condi
tions, some 50 Stanford couples will
call on residents of Palo Alto next
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
evenings.
"Money is needed more than ever
before to purchase supplies so that
the Home can be converted into a
war hospital in 24 hours," declared
Mrs. Ruth Atwood, superintendent.
Under the present plan, if San
Fracisco is bombed, from 50 to 100
children will be moved from hospi
tals there and quartered in the Con
valescent Home. Those hospitals
v ill then be free to handle air raid
victims, and the children will be in
a safe place.
According to Shelly Parker, co
chairman of the off-campus drive
with Mary Jean Haynes, people will
be asked to contribute at least $2.61,
which is the cost of keeping one
child in the home for one day.
Making arrangements for the ofT
campus drive are Helen Savory,
dinner; Dede DeFriest and Bud
Clary, prizes; Janet Atkinson and
Cal Setzer, kits; and Peggy Boothe,
publicity.
The callers include:
Sally Breuner, Bruce Lyon; Eliza

Harry Morgan; Barbara Horner,
Lee Peake; Sue Field, Bill Hutchi
