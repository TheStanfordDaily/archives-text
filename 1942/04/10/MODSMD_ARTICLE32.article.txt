# 'Westerners' Gawk at N.Y. During Tour
## 
### 
(Editor's note: This letter was
received from Jim Kessler, who is
in New York City on the varsity
debate tour.)
When West meets East on East's
stamping ground, he is expected to
follow the old axiom: "When in Rome
do as the Romans do!"
But this Westerner decided to act
natural and to gawk at the giant
of the city. New York with its
"Toimes" Square, subways, skyscrap
ers, mobs of hurrying people, Park
Avenue, and Hell's Kitchen along
with Harlem, the Bronx and thou
sands of other spots thrown in, seems
to be all that it's cracked up to be—
especially when you see things
through the easterner's eye.
When we were crossing the Alle
gheny "Mountains" (less *han 2,000
feet above sea level), w» asked a
westerner from way out in the Mid
dle West by Pittsburgh, Pa., where
the mountains began; to which she
replied, "Are you blind? We have
been at the crest of the north end
of the x - ange for half an hour.'' This
was our first contact with the real
eastern point of view.
THE WHOLE WORLD-
To a New Yorker, the city and its
immediate environs are a complete
world. Those who work in the
downtown areas all over Manhattan
and the four other boroughs are tied
up all day long in office buildings
and subways.
The only chance they (white col
lar workers and office workers)
have to get out in the "country" is
on Sundays and holidays. Even
then, many have no desire to go and
many more have other business to
attend to, or else they just don't
have the money to spend on such a
luxury. Perhaps these facts are
sufficient to warrant the average
New Yorker's impression that his
city is the major part of the U.S.
A BIG TOWN
Everything about the "big town"
is big. When you are pushed off the
train at the Pennsylvania Station by
waves of shoving people into the
main waiting room, you suddenly
feel very small and insignificant. In
other words, I was promptly put in
my place. When I reached the out
side, my first impulse was to look
up, and my first reaction was that
the woman on the train was very
mistaken, for this must be the north
end of the Allegheny range.
The New Yorker is very proud of
his city and everything it has to of
fer, and he seems to be very anx
ious to prove to you beyond all
doubt that it's the greatest little
spot on earth. Maybe that's why I
spent all day riding on the subway
from point to point with a total
stranger who wanted to be sure that
we people from the Far East (Cali
fornia) got the right idea about
things.
When we were in lowa, we were
promptly informed that the good
citizens of that state do not say I-o-
Way; in South Bend, Ind., an Irish
man from Boston swore up and down
that people from that city do not say
Bahston; at Purdue University in
Lafayette, Ind., we were told that
there is no such thing as a gentle
man from Indiana. So, I thought I
might as well ask a New Yorker if
he had ever seen a cow.
NO COWS
Of course, I expected hiui to shat
ter the famous rumor to the effect
that thousands of the metropolitan
inhabitants have never seen the spe
cies, but again I was dead wrong, for
my chance friend had never seen a
bovine in all his life, and had never
been west of Hoboken, New Jersey
(just across the Hudson River from
New York City).
The easterner also docs not have
the same idea about distance that
we do. For instance, in the course of

a conversation with a student from
Columbia University, I mentioned
the fact Shorty and I got clear
across Nevada and California in one
day.
Said the easterner, "You must
travel at a very slow pace out West;
here in the East we can cross Con
necticut, Rhode Island, Massachu
setts, and New Hampshire in a day
—four states to your two.

When we were in lowa, we were
promptly informed that the good
citizens of that state do not say I-o-
Way; in South Bend, Ind., an Irish
man from Boston swore up and down
that people from that city do not say
Bahston; at Purdue University in
Lafayette, Ind., we were told that
there is no such thing as a gentle
man from Indiana. So, I thought I
might as well ask a New Yorker if
he had ever seen a cow.
NO COWS
Of course, I expected hiui to shat
ter the famous rumor to the effect
that thousands of the metropolitan
inhabitants have never seen the spe
cies, but again I was dead wrong, for
my chance friend had never seen a
bovine in all his life, and had never
been west of Hoboken, New Jersey
(just across the Hudson River from
New York City).
The easterner also docs not have
the same idea about distance that
we do. For instance, in the course of

a conversation with a student from
Columbia University, I mentioned
the fact Shorty and I got clear
across Nevada and California in one
day.
Said the easterner, "You must
travel at a very slow pace out West;
here in the East we can cross Con
necticut, Rhode Island, Massachu
setts, and New Hampshire in a day

When West meets East on East's
stamping ground, he is expected to

But this Westerner decided to act
natural and to gawk at the giant

"Toimes" Square, subways, skyscrap
ers, mobs of hurrying people, Park
Avenue, and Hell's Kitchen along
with Harlem, the Bronx and thou
sands of other spots thrown in, seems
to be all that it's cracked up to be—

THE WHOLE WORLD-
To a New Yorker, the city and its
immediate environs are a complete
world. Those who work in the
downtown areas all over Manhattan
and the four other boroughs are tied
up all day long in office buildings
and subways.
The only chance they (white col
lar workers and office workers)
have to get out in the "country" is
on Sundays and holidays. Even
then, many have no desire to go and
many more have other business to
attend to, or else they just don't
have the money to spend on such a
luxury. Perhaps these facts are
sufficient to warrant the average
New Yorker's impression that his
city is the major part of the U.S.
A BIG TOWN
Everything about the "big town"
is big. When you are pushed off the
train at the Pennsylvania Station by
waves of shoving people into the
main waiting room, you suddenly
feel very small and insignificant. In
other words, I was promptly put in
my place. When I reached the out
side, my first impulse was to look
up, and my first reaction was that
the woman on the train was very
mistaken, for this must be the north
end of the Allegheny range.
The New Yorker is very proud of
his city and everything it has to of
fer, and he seems to be very anx
ious to prove to you beyond all
doubt that it's the greatest little
spot on earth. Maybe that's why I
spent all day riding on the subway
from point to point with a total
stranger who wanted to be sure that
we people from the Far East (Cali
fornia) got the right idea about
things.

have to get out in the "country" is
on Sundays and holidays. Even
then, many have no desire to go and
many more have other business to
attend to, or else they just don't
have the money to spend on such a
luxury. Perhaps these facts are
sufficient to warrant the average
New Yorker's impression that his
city is the major part of the U.S.
A BIG TOWN
Everything about the "big town"
is big. When you are pushed off the
train at the Pennsylvania Station by
waves of shoving people into the
main waiting room, you suddenly
feel very small and insignificant. In
other words, I was promptly put in
my place. When I reached the out
side, my first impulse was to look
up, and my first reaction was that
the woman on the train was very
mistaken, for this must be the north
end of the Allegheny range.
The New Yorker is very proud of
his city and everything it has to of
fer, and he seems to be very anx
ious to prove to you beyond all
doubt that it's the greatest little
spot on earth. Maybe that's why I
spent all day riding on the subway
from point to point with a total
stranger who wanted to be sure that
we people from the Far East (Cali
fornia) got the right idea about
things.
When we were in lowa, we were
promptly informed that the good
citizens of that state do not say I-o-
Way; in South Bend, Ind., an Irish
man from Boston swore up and down
that people from that city do not say
Bahston; at Purdue University in
Lafayette, Ind., we were told that
there is no such thing as a gentle
man from Indiana. So, I thought I
might as well ask a New Yorker if
he had ever seen a cow.
NO COWS
Of course, I expected hiui to shat
ter the famous rumor to the effect
that thousands of the metropolitan
inhabitants have never seen the spe
cies, but again I was dead wrong, for
my chance friend had never seen a
bovine in all his life, and had never
been west of Hoboken, New Jersey
(just across the Hudson River from
New York City).
The easterner also docs not have
the same idea about distance that
we do. For instance, in the course of

a conversation with a student from
Columbia University, I mentioned
the fact Shorty and I got clear
across Nevada and California in one
day.
Said the easterner, "You must
travel at a very slow pace out West;
here in the East we can cross Con
necticut, Rhode Island, Massachu
setts, and New Hampshire in a day
—four states to your two.

When West meets East on East's
stamping ground, he is expected to
follow the old axiom: "When in Rome
do as the Romans do!"
But this Westerner decided to act
natural and to gawk at the giant
of the city. New York with its
"Toimes" Square, subways, skyscrap
ers, mobs of hurrying people, Park
Avenue, and Hell's Kitchen along
with Harlem, the Bronx and thou
sands of other spots thrown in, seems
to be all that it's cracked up to be—
especially when you see things
through the easterner's eye.
When we were crossing the Alle
gheny "Mountains" (less *han 2,000
feet above sea level), w» asked a
westerner from way out in the Mid
dle West by Pittsburgh, Pa., where
the mountains began; to which she
replied, "Are you blind? We have
been at the crest of the north end
of the x - ange for half an hour.'' This
was our first contact with the real
eastern point of view.
THE WHOLE WORLD-
To a New Yorker, the city and its
immediate environs are a complete
world. Those who work in the
downtown areas all over Manhattan
and the four other boroughs are tied
up all day long in office buildings
and subways.
The only chance they (white col
lar workers and office workers)
have to get out in the "country" is
on Sundays and holidays. Even
