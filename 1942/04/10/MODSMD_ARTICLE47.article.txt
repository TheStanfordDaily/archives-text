## 
###

serve as an indicator toward the all
important Card-Trojan meet May !),
since the Raisin City team met the
southerners last Saturday in Los
Angeles.
If the Cards can come near equal
ling the 95-35 score the Southern
Californians piled up on the Bull
dogs last week, it will throw the
conference track championship into
an open race. However, few ob
servers give Stanford more than an
even chance in their meet Saturday
afternoon.

perennial distance aces, Art Cazares
and Bobby Madrid. Both will run
the mile with Cazares handling the
two mile and Madrid the 880.

Lamoure, former Farm student who

now throwing the weights for the
Bulldogs. He took third in the shot
against the Trojans with a put of
47 feet 4 inches. This should be
more than enough to defeat Indian
Captain Gene Kern. Kern, however,
will be an even bet in the discus

Sturgeon.

San Jose Spartans Wednesday af
ternoon three sophomores, Bob
Compton, Willard Smith, and A1

conference track championship into
an open race. However, few ob
servers give Stanford more than an
even chance in their meet Saturday
afternoon.
Heading the host team are those
perennial distance aces, Art Cazares
and Bobby Madrid. Both will run
the mile with Cazares handling the
two mile and Madrid the 880.
FRESNO MAS LAMOURE
Ol particular interest to Stan
fordites will be the showing of Jean
Lamoure, former Farm student who
was Athertonized last spring. He is
now throwing the weights for the
Bulldogs. He took third in the shot
against the Trojans with a put of
47 feet 4 inches. This should be
more than enough to defeat Indian
Captain Gene Kern. Kern, however,
will be an even bet in the discus
against Lamoure and teammate
Sturgeon.
After their wins against the strong
San Jose Spartans Wednesday af
ternoon three sophomores, Bob
Compton, Willard Smith, and A1
Pande will be closely watched by
Coach Johnson.
Pande and Ernie Peninou, who
finished one-two in the Spartan
meet, will be favored to nose out
Bulldog Garold Gaines in the jave
lin throw. Smith and Vern Hart
should have little trouble in the
high jump.
INDIANS' HANDS FULL
Compton and Wyland Cripe,
transfer half-miler, will have their
hands full against Cazares, Madrid
and Joe Shropshire, who also runs a
fast half for Fresno.
From the standpoint of close
competition (he high hurdles will be
the meet's highlight. Ed Hertel,
double winner against San Jose, and
Don Reiss, promising sophomore
who hit hurdles in Wednesday's
meet, will face Louis Futrell, novice
high hurdle winner in the Long
Beach Relays. All three men have
broken 15 flat this season.
SILVA TO RUN
John Silva, senior sprinter who
was unable to run in the Spartan
meet, will be in shape to run both j
dashes against A] Jackson, top
Fresno man. Kern and Bill Quack- j
en bush will also run the sprints.
Russ Peck and Ed Tomaso in the !
pole vault will face Ray Shields, who j
tied for first in the Trojan meet at
13 feet. Although both Card vault
ers were beaten by Spartan Cooley
at 13-6. they should be able to clear i
that or better Saturday.
Captain Kern, team iron man. will '
be favored to win the broad jump j
despite plenty of competition from I
Futrell and A1 Miller. Don Baker
of the Bulldogs should have little !
trouble anexing the 440 from Mori !
Orme.
This week-end's track meet be
tween Stanford's varsity forces and
I<resno State at Fresno will not only
serve as a further conditioner for
Pitch Johnson's team, hut it will
serve as an indicator toward the all
important Card-Trojan meet May !),
since the Raisin City team met the
southerners last Saturday in Los
Angeles.
If the Cards can come near equal
ling the 95-35 score the Southern
Californians piled up on the Bull
