### H.D. THOREAU 
! A FEW reminiscences over things that have transpired since that black
November afternoon when the Stanfords finished in second place in
i the Big Game with the Californias would lead the casual observer to
! grimace and shiver at the thought of Farm grid next fall. However, when
a preliminary mustering of forces took place out on the practice field the
j other afternoon, the situation didn't look nearly as dreary as one might
i think.
There are still on hand four men who could "avez-l'autour" the
hackfield next fall with some alacrity, at least enough to fool most
customers. Scooter A! ( ole would be in the shoveling spot with Buck
Fawcett driving from fullback and Hoot Armstrong and Bill She Her
<, para ting on cither side of the "Scourge of Las Banos."
Little A1 is no mean passer and can hoot the ball on occasion. Sheller's
eet seem to have a tendency to move the ball a long distance. Speed isn't
lacking in Fawcett and Armstrong, not to mention when Al crosses 'em
up by lighting out himsell. Sheller and Fawcett supply the heft. What
more could be desired?
In front of these stalwarts could be placed Kd Stamm and Bruno
Banducci at tackles and Chuck Taylor and Lorcn LaPrade at guards,
none of whom are the physically hashful type. They don't need any
introduction to their duties either, since all four operated at the same
emhattlements last fall. Mill Vucinich is having a try at centering the
hall and if this move pans out his 215 pounds will do considerable
good in the middle of the line. Hank Norberg and Bill Symes could
handle the flanks more than adequately.
Now. mind you, this outfit is conjured up merely from last year's left
overs. That red-hot frosh team of last season hasn't even been considered.
Alos there may be some engineering student who has never touched a
i football before that will be an all-American by next fall, simply because
he was walking by the practice field one day when the ball bounced over
to him. In returning it he threw the ball 85 yards and was promptly signed
up by Gentleman Jim Lawson. Well, I've seen it done in the movies.

I JN CASE Wednesday afternoon's twilight meet wasn't sufficient for any
died-in-the-ersatz track fans still left on the Farm, on Saturday after
noon at Berkeley the two best collegiate track teams in the world will get
together at Edwards Stadium and match their talents. By his I am re
ferring to the S.C.-Cal track meet.
California will be lucky to get 50 points against the ever-powerful
Cromwell-coached team, but several individual battles will provide the
thrills.
The invincible Grovcr Klemmer is just as likely to land in third
place in his specialty, the 440, as he is to win it. that's how good Hu
bert Kerns and Clifford Bourland are. Also, Hal Davis, world's fastest
human, is going to have trouble in the sprints with Eddie Morris, who
has been "under wraps." to use the vernacular.
Ihe same situation will hold true in most of the rest of the events.

AND FLASHES: The way Ray Hammett is hitting the ball and
fielding every position on the team, he may be grabbed up by the
filthy pro ball scouts before he gets a chance to guide the T machine
next fall. . . . Frankie Albert, new assistant grid coach, has about a dozen
new quarterbacks to which he must teach the fine points of handling the
ball in the T formation. However, the hardship is worked on Tyler Norton,
reserve center, who must initiate each of the plays these far-from-smooth
neophytes practice. . . . Bill Wilson, called the "modern wild man" by
some city cub reporter, has the best pitching record of any man in the
C.l.B.A.—he has let no hits and has a 0.00 earned run average.
