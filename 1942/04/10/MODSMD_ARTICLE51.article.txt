# Mermen to Face Trojans, Bruins
## 
### 
Ten Stanford varsity swimmers
entrained for Los Angeles last night
to face the Trojans and the Bruins
in a pair of conference meets today
and tomorrow.
Toughest meet of the two will be
the affair against the Trojans, who
hold a <19 to 25 victory over Califor
nia, which in turn scalped the Bru
ins, 57 to 19.
The Trojans are strongest in the
breast stroke and diving, where
Coach Ernie Brandsten's mermen
have little or no strength. Stanford's
chance for victory lies in the free
style racesâ€”particularly the sprints
where Ted Munroe, Captain Don
Smith and Rey Rule carry the major
burden.
