# Revamped Card Nine to Face Santa Clara Team Tomorrow
## 
### 
Several new faces may be in the line-up tomorrow when Stanford's
baseball team plays Santa Clara here at 2:15 <ui the Sunken Diamond.
aid Coach Harry Wolter.
The Indians, victorious in but one league game out of seven tries, will
find plenty of opposition in a better-than-average Bronco team. Her-

man Pillette Jr., son of the
star now with San Diego, will prob
ably be on the mound. He set down
U.C.L.A. easily last Wednesday, 3-1, '
and also has a win over St. Mary's.
Wolter announced that "Wild" Bill ;
Wilson will make his second con
secutive start for Stanford when he
faces the boys of Leonard Casanova.
Wilson was so nervous in his first
start against Cal Wednesday that he
walked the first six men to face \
him. But Wolter has faith in Wil- j
son, a tall husky redhead who has j
plenty on the ball when he can find i
the plate.
Ward Walkup will again be be- j
hind the plate. Walkup has been
most consistent in directing the
Cardinal pitching staff.
Ray "Duke" Hammett, classiest ;
first-baseman in the league, will be |
in his usual position on the keystone |
sack. Either Harry Parsons or Cap- j
tain Aurelio "Botch" Caruso will be !
at second. Ted Nell and Leland j
Scott will be at third and shortstop, j
There are several boys who may I
get the call at the outfield positions.
Wolter will probably keep Carl Kel- j
lenberger in center, but will choose
from a long list of candidates for
left and right field. Some of the eli
gibles are Don Pendergrass, Ed
Washburn, Ed Sjostrum. Howie
Dallmar, Bill Cunha, and John
Brooke.
