### 
CHARLESTON. W. Va., April 9
(UP).â€”Frank Pytlak, 32, Boston Red
Sox's first string catcher, left for his
Buffalo, N.Y.. home today to enlist
' in the Navy tomorrow. Pytlak
caught 106 games last season and
! batted .271. He had a low draft
j number and was expected to be
called early in the sea.'-on.
Cancellation because of weather of
J today's Boston-Cincinnati game gave
the Reds this sixth annual spring
series, five games to four. The Reds
meanwhile signed Ewell Blaekwell,
18-vear-old right-hander from its
Ogden, Utah, farm. The San Dimas,
Calif., youth pitched five innings
this spring, allowing only two hits.

Freedom is an easy thing to lose,
but a difficult thing to regain. In
vest in victory bonds and protect it
for yourself and your children.
