# Enjoy the War? Destroy that Sticker!

### 
THE valuable contribution of the annual Soph
omore Carnival to Convalescent Home Week
funds will always remain unquestioned. But
this year the carnival's publicity committee has
committed, in poor taste, what seems to us an
unfortunate blunder.
"Enjoy the War with '44," blaze stickers
plastered by the committee on campus cars.
Faintly reminiscent of the muddy foxholes of
Bataan, isn't it?
There has been a great deal written and
spoken about working harder than ever before,
about a person's taking only a minimum of the
necessary relaxation in his life; things which in
this case would only amount to boring reitera
tion. We shall not dwell on them.
Certainly no one doubts the good intent of the
men and women directing the carnival this
year, but we cannot help wondering, and even
guessing, what the reaction of people in San
Francisco, who see these stickers on Stanford
cars, will be.
News is popping more than ever before at the
time of this writing. Latest reports from Wash
ington are telling America we have just lost
36,000 fathers and brothers and sweethearts to
the invading Jap dogs at Bataan. We of this
generation are experiencing more crushing
grief today than we have ever known in our
lives. And from all indications this is only the
beginning.
We can only pledge ourselves to go out wher
ever our country may send us to avenge our
men, and right now we pray it will be against
the Japs. We thank God it won't be long we'll
have to wait before that time comes.
In the meantime, we stage a week of money
raising for stricken children and, if we can afford
to knock off for an hour or two to enjoy our
selves while doing it, then all right. What we
are doing is for a worthy cause. But let us not
advertise to the public that we are a country
club, when the invaluable contributions of
Stanford's men and women and laboratories
are proving daily that just the opposite is true.
Enjoy the War?
We call upon every Stanford student to rip
that sticker off campus windshields this morn
ing.

ington are telling America we have just lost
36,000 fathers and brothers and sweethearts to
the invading Jap dogs at Bataan. We of this
generation are experiencing more crushing
grief today than we have ever known in our
lives. And from all indications this is only the
beginning.
We can only pledge ourselves to go out wher
ever our country may send us to avenge our
men, and right now we pray it will be against
the Japs. We thank God it won't be long we'll
have to wait before that time comes.
In the meantime, we stage a week of money
raising for stricken children and, if we can afford
to knock off for an hour or two to enjoy our
selves while doing it, then all right. What we
are doing is for a worthy cause. But let us not
advertise to the public that we are a country
club, when the invaluable contributions of
Stanford's men and women and laboratories
are proving daily that just the opposite is true.
Enjoy the War?
We call upon every Stanford student to rip
that sticker off campus windshields this morn
ing.
THE valuable contribution of the annual Soph
omore Carnival to Convalescent Home Week
funds will always remain unquestioned. But
this year the carnival's publicity committee has
committed, in poor taste, what seems to us an
unfortunate blunder.
"Enjoy the War with '44," blaze stickers
plastered by the committee on campus cars.
Faintly reminiscent of the muddy foxholes of
Bataan, isn't it?
There has been a great deal written and
spoken about working harder than ever before,
about a person's taking only a minimum of the
necessary relaxation in his life; things which in
this case would only amount to boring reitera
tion. We shall not dwell on them.
Certainly no one doubts the good intent of the
men and women directing the carnival this
year, but we cannot help wondering, and even
guessing, what the reaction of people in San
Francisco, who see these stickers on Stanford
cars, will be.

ington are telling America we have just lost
