WOMEN'S NOMINATING COMMITTEE'S
interviewing of candidates for student
body positions, yesterday and today, is the first
hint—outside of Excom-—that elections machin
ery is greased and ready to roll. Spring quarter
elections, always the most exciting from the
point of desirable offices and the number of
candidates, were this year postponed by Excom
to the fourth week in the quarter.
The reason, of course, was the desire to em
phasize the summer quarter program by means
of adequate summer student government, and
the uncertainty as to how best to go about it.
This required time, and at present the question
is No. 1 on Excom's weel'ly docket, and prob
ably will remain so for the balance of the quar
ter.
Elections this year, then, will be held accord
ing to the new three-day plan of incorporating
nominations, declinations, and balloting in that
period, April 20, 21, and 22. Once the campus
has finished with Con Home Week, starting
today, local interest and activity will shift to
who's going to run for what; in short, the old
bugaboo, Mr. Caucus, will probably stick his
foot in the door not so long from now.
Stevie, over in the A.S.S.U. office, who knows
more about everything and everybody than
anybody, says the three-day period is too short.
We've got a little bet on that.
