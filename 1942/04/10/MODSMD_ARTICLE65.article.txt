### AMIE REICHERT 
r JPHE Indian compromise is a great political triumph
for the United Nations and a personal triumph
for Sir Stafford Cripps, Britain's special ambassador to
India.
Adolf must be very angry today. This is exactly
the thing he was afraid would happen, this is exactly
the thing he has worked and hoped against.
Der Fuehrer has a great plan, you know, and India
was to play a powerful part in that plan. How big a
part, we can only guess. Perhaps India was to be the
final battleground of this war, perhaps she was to be
the link between the steel arms of the world-girdling
German-Japanese pincers.
Something like that probably. Der Fuehrer had it
all figured out, you may be sure. The idea was to
capitalize on the anti-British feeling in India, to stir
up trouble among the natives and turn Moslem against
Hindu and both against Briton. In short, to emasculate
India's gigantic (400 million) manpower and to render
her potential military might worthless.

W/BLL, the compromise doesn't solve all of these
problems, to be sure. But it takes care of enough
of them to put Herr Hitler in a fretful state, and to
insure a good-sized Indian army, fighting its first
national war, as an ally of Britain and her other do
minions and the U.S. and China and Russia.
That's the big thing. India now has something to
fight for.
The three provisions of the reported compro
mise (it is not official yet) arc:
The immediate establishment of a national gov
ernment for India.
All portfolios, including defense, in what is now
the viceroy's executive council are to go to Indians.
Britain will retain actual military direction of
the Indian war effort for the duration.
One problem remains and it is by no means any
one, and that is the question of division of power with
in the new Indian government between Moslems and
Hindus. This is of course something the Indians must
work out for themselves.
At any rate, the danger of the war effort being
hampered by internal dissension is considerably less
ened by the new plan, for the British are still in con
trol of the military and that is what counts right now.
Undoubtedly there are rough days ahead for the
newly born government. There must be a complete
reconstruction of the set-up which now exists whereby
Indian princes have ruled for generations under the
British viceroy.
But the roughest, days of all will be these next
weeks and months which will find the Japanese in
vader pounding the Indian coasts and perhaps invad
ing the land.
