### MIKE CHURCHILL 
"CAN YOU FILL THIS SPACE?"
r JPHERE are two reasons why I joined the Daily staff.
Oophs, there are three, another just walked past.
Well, anyway, one was to discover why those large rec
tangles on inside pages that continually urge you to
send the Daily home to the wife and kiddies.
The answer is hidden deep in the secret recesses
of the business office, where no editorial man may
venture. The other was to find out if possible the
origin or reason why
Napoleon's handwriting was so il
legible that several of his letters were
taken for maps of battlefields.
every so often at the bottom of the columns one will
inadvertently find that
No rain has fallen in London on
the morning of March 16 for 51 years.
one is reading something that just doesn't seem to fit
into the day's news. These little bulletins appear,
that is all. The paper is set up in type, as it should be
when
A factory for canning mangoes, prin
cipally for export to the United King
dom, is now in operation in Bombay.
it is discovered that the news that's fit to print doesn't
quite stretch to the bottom. Everybody wonders what
should be done. Suddenly
Pennsylvania permits citizens to
manufacture 20 gals, of wine in their
homes annually.
there is a mist in the space to be filled and this news
from another world gradually forms in lead and there
it is saying
Darwin calculated that, even with
the slowest of all breeders, the ele
phant, after a period of 750 years, there
could be nearly 19 million elephants
alive, all descended from one pair.
just the right amount of words, sentences and phrases
to fill up the space. The editor and his cohorts sigh,
still ignorant that
Sausages are mentioned in the writ
ings of the Greeks in the third century.
these things apparently come from the little genii that
sit upon the type banks and plunk out fillers when
they arc desperately needed.
