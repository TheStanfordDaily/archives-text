# CAMPUS OPINION
## OH, HAPPY EASTER 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
Wednesday's "Campus Opinion" on the inade
quacy and emotional sterility of Dr. Trueblood's Easter
sermon seemed a rather pathetic attempt of an indo
lent Stanford sophisticate to arouse his mind (and he
says he does this twice a year, and then has to drag
himself) to spiritual richness.
I am not a religious fanatic, nor do I dress in a
black veil and assume a "holier than thou" aspect. I
also believe that our chapel sermons miss fire from
time to time, and I think there is a definite lack of
warmth in the services in our chapel. . . . But it docs
seem fantastically absurd and more than a little
crushing that anyone who chooses to make a critique
of a sermon should have garbled so successfully his
facts (could he have been sleeping—a little?) and given
in to the insolence and generalizations of a "tired
mind" ... a mind which, as he says, goes to church
twice a year. How can this creature expect any
church ever to give him any inspiration? Inspiration is
a two-sided affair ... it isn't just sitting back and
absorbing.
I agree that Mr. Trueblood lacks a certain warmth,
a certain dash and verve in his sermons, but God
keep us from the day when it will be with chimes
and incense and flowing oratory that we become
inspired.
Was Dr. Trueblood so wrong, or have we lost the
power to understand? It is the vital, vibrant, sus
taining truths which inspire us that are hardest to
grasp. Why is the world such a Hell if they weren't!
I would like to reply to Wednesday's opinion and
say this: Can it be because we are intellectually lazy
that many of us did not see .♦he emotional and intel
lectual hope and challenge of Dr. Trueblood's sermon?
We need, I guess, some spiritual maturity.
F.I.
