# Raid Alarm Blacks Libe, Proves Hoax
## Library Heads Order Student Evacuation As Fake Siren Blows 
### 
Stanford had an air raid alarm
last Thursday nightâ€”but it turned
nut to he a hoax. (See editorial on
page 4).
About 9:50 Thursday night the air
raid warning signal sounded on a
portable siren outside the Main Li
brary. Library officials thought it
was the siren on the Hoover War
Library and ordered evacuation of
students from the Main Library.
After the students had been evacu
ated the library lights were extin
guished.
When the library had been evacu
ated, several explosions were heard
near the library. Evidently the ex
plosions were made by firecrackers
or torpedoes to panic the students.
Frank F. Walker, financial vice
president, was informed of the "fake"
air raid alarm by Dr. Nathan Van
Patten, director of the library, and
Mr. Walker notified the police.
"We're inclined to think," said Mr.
Walker, "that it was not a prank but
that it was someone's method of try
ing to terrorize the students. Wheth
er it was intended as a joke or not,
it will not be treated as such. No
matter who is guilty, he will be
fully prosecuted."
Both the campus police and the
Palo Alto police arc investigating
the "prank."
