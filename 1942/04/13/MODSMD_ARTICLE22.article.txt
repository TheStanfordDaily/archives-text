## Nehru Campaigns To Unite Indians Against Invaders 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 12 (UP). â€”
Waves of Japanese bombers today
rained explosives on the island base
of Corregidor in 12 separate attacks,
the War Department announced, but
heavy' anti-aircraft fire from the
American fortress kept the raiding
planes at a high altitude and little
damage was done.
In addition to the aerial pounding,
Japanese artillery based on the Ba
taan and Cavite shores on the west
and east sides of the bay laid down
a cross-fire barrage during the
morning.
Tlie communique did not say what
if any damage had been inflicted by
the artillery shelling.
It also continued silent fbout the
situation on Bataan where early
Thursday some 36,800 American-
Filipino defenders, weakened by
disease, short rations and days of
ceaseless attack, at last were en
gulfed by the overwhelming hordes
of Japanese.
(Axis radio broadcasts made it ap
parent that some savage fighting was
continuing by isolated groups on the
Bataan Peninsula. The Japanese
news agency Domci said that Japa
nese troops had occupied Marivelcs,
main port on the south coast of Ba
taan, about four miles across from
Corregidor. The Tokyo newspaper
Asahi earlier had told of bitter
street-to-street fighting.)
