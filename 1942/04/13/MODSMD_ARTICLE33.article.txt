# New Men's Dorm Director To Remodel Encina 'Barn'
## 
### DICK FOGEL 
Encina will not he "the barn" soon.
This startling fact was verified by Stanley Sharp, new director of
men's dormitories, yesterday, for wondrous new improvements, according
to Mr. Sharp, are under way.
"It is planned," said Mr. Sharp, "to redecorate the lobby with new rugs,

lamps, chairs, and sofas. The object
of this is to give greater utility to
the lobby for Encina men."
According to Mr. Sharp, the rooms
in Encina will also eventually be
redecorated. "Such improvements
as will be made," continued the di
rector of the Men's Halls," include
putting central light fixtures and
several wall plugs into each room.
This .will eliminate the dangers and
inconveniences of the present hap
hazard electrical equipment now in
use."
The doors of the old dormitory
have already been fixed so that they
swing outward and now finally com
ply with fire regulations. There will
also be additional fire hoses in
stalled.
Another improvement which has
already been completed and which
benefits not only Encina but also all
the other men's halls is doubling of
the capacity of the dormitory tele
phone switchboards. This was done
by putting an additional switch
board into the hall and doubling the
staff of telephone installations will
also be made, and some of these are
already in place.
All of which leaves only Sequoia as
the last stronghold of that vanishing
species, the Stanford rough.
