standing forensic competition in the
western United States, according to
Stanford debate officials. Held on
the Farm campus last year, the pur- j
pose of the event is to determine
what kind of speaking competition
leads to the highest degree of intel
lectual honesty, clear thinking, and
effective speaking.
Evincing a wide range of activity,
the Stanford speakers' entrance list
places Frolik and Morin in pane!
discussion speaking, Boas and Morin
in formal debate, and Shorty Gran- j
nis and Jim Kessler in extempora- i
neous speaking and after-dinner
speaking, respectively. (The latter
will meet the Farm team at Seattle
at the end of their 7,000-mile cross
country tour.)
FROLIK FOR BECK
Jim Frolik will represent Stanford
Coach N. B. Beck in Seattle. Frolik
is also on the executive committee of
the league and will aid in forming
a new constitution to govern Pacific
Coast debaters next year.
After the Washington meet, the
Stanford quintet will appear at Reed
College and a Stanford Alumni Club
meeting, both in Portland, Oregon.
