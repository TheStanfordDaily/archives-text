# Cards Drop 4-2 Tilt to Broncs In CIBA Loss
## 
### 
Unable to hit in the crucial pinches
with men on base. Stanford lost a
1-2 decision to Santa Clara Satur
day on the Sunken Diamond. It was
their seventh C.1.8.A. defeat.
In (he eighth inning the Cards had
the bases bulging with but one out
and were unable to push any runs
across the plate. Carl Kellenberger
grounded to third for the first out of
the inning. Ray Hammett collected
his first hit of the day, a long double
to left-center that went up on the
slope. Then Leland Scott hit his
fourth consecutive hit of the game,
advancing Hammett to third. Howie
Dallmar, playing his first full game
for Stanford, walked, filling the bags.
At this point of the game, Bronco
Coach Leonard Casanova put in Buzz
Meagher to replace Bill Wetzler on
the mound. Meagher got off to a
good start, striking out Ward Walk
up for the second out. Pinch-hitter
Don Pendergrass flied four against
the third base stands, with Reese
making a brilliant catch to choke
off the Indian rally.
WILSON STARTS
Big "Wild" Bill Wilson started off
the first inning by walking Mullins,
and the spectators thought that he
was going to duplicate his six
straight walk performance at Cal.
But he settled down, and while giv
ing up 11 hits, only three came after
Ihe fifth.
Santa Clara got their first run in
the second inning when Kellenberger
was unable to handle Crawford's
long fly cleanly, and he circled the
bases on the error. In the third they
picked up two more runs after two
were down on three straight hits.
The last Bronco run came in the
next inning on three quick singles.
SCOTT PLAYS WELL
Stanford got its two runs in the
sixth when Kellenberger opened
with a single, followed by Scott's
screaming triple to deep left, scor
ing Kellenberger. Walkup's single
tallied Scott.
Scott, besides his perfect four-for
four day at bat, played exceptionally
well on defense, and is quite com
petently filling the shortstop spot va
cated by Clark Graham.
Captain Aurelio "Botch" Caruso
replaces Harry Parsons at second
base in the seventh inning and col
lected two singles, both to right
field, in two times at the plate.
The Indians play St. Mary's on
Thursday.
Victory Bonds and stamps give
you a chance to help your country
in this its greatest fight.
