# Splashers Win One, Lose One
## 
### 
Stanford's hopes for a conference
swimming title were dashed in Los
Angeles this week-end as the U.S.C.
Trojan mermen defeated the Farm
varsity, 43 to 32, Friday afternoon.
The Cards came back Saturday to
wallop U.C.L.A., 52 to 23.
Coach Ernie Brandsten's boys lost
the Trojan meet on two eventsâ€”the
j final 400-yard relay and the 100-yard
i free style, both of them by a single
stroke.
S C. WINS
U.S.C.'s team of Hinkley. Allison,
I Townsend, and Sexton edged the
Farm mermen in 3:46.6, fast time
for the Trojan pool, to put the meet
on ice. Captain Don Smith dropped
the 100-yard race to Sexton in 55.6.
Previously, Smith had upset the fa
vored Sexton in the 50 free style in
25.2.
Otherwise, the Cards, led by Ted ;
Monroe, who won both the 220 and |
440 free style races, came through,
even better than was expected.
Monroe led teammate Rey Rule to
; the tape in 2:25.1 in the 220 and then
copped the 440 in 5:29.
U.C.L.A. LOOSES
Bill Gard in the diving, Todd
j Gardner in the breast stroke, and
j Jim Canning in the back stroke
j came through with unexpected sec
! ond places, which might have won
| the meet.
Winning six of the nine events,
Stanford had little trouble with the
i Uclans, who have yet to win a con
j ference meet this year.
Both Stanford relay teams, Mon
roe in the 220, Pete Lee in the back j
stroke, Gardner in the breast stroke,
and Clint Eastman in the 440 free
j style turned in first places for the
! Indians.
