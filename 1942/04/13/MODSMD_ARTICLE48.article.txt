# Papoose Netmen To Meet Menlo
## 
### 
Si ill playing without the services
of Bob Forbes, who was number
ihree on the ladder last quarter, the
Farm's frosh netmen play Menlo
J.C. today en the frosh courts in
their final practice match before
the season's climax, the Cal match.
Since Forbes' sprained ankle will
probably not be in shape in time
for Ihe Bear Cub fracas, Coach
Johnny Lamb's lineup for Menlo
will probably also be the team that
plays against Cal.
Facing a fairly strong J.C. team
will be Ted Myers as number one,
Bob Rutledge in the second spot,
Dick Thomas at three, Bob Craig at
four, Wally Smith at five, and Mur
ray holding down his usual number
six. Myers - Thomas, Rutledge-
Craig, and Smith - Jerry Fine are
Coach Lamb's choices for the doubles
combinations.
