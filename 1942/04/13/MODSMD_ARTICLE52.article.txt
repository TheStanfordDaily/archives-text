# Indian Golfers Wallop Cal 23-4
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity golf team ram
bled all over California's offerings,
23-4, Saturday, in their third straight
breather-win in P.C.C. play.
The possibility of the Bears' be
■ ing able to do much against Eddie j
Twiggs' fairway's panzer division had
never occurred to any serious golfer i
anyway, so the rout proved only that ;
Stanford has another national cham
pionship squad on its hands. Bud
Brownell, pointing for the national
individual honors which were denied
! him last year by Earl Stewart, turned
in a one-over-par 72 in topping j
Berkeley's best, Curt Benton.
CARDS PRACTICE
It was a big practice day for most
j of Stanford's roster. The top-rank
ers sewed it up so thoroughly in
I the morning rounds that Coach Ed-
I die Twiggs put his nevcr-had-a
chance gang into the doubles com
petition in the afternoon. No local
: golfer lost an entire match, Trap
| hagen and Wilson dropping one nine
apiece in the morning rounds and
Hayes-Helleman and Phillips-Cord
ingly losing the same amount in the
afternoon.

and Cal together have been able to
accumulate only 12 points against

Tournament play according to Pa
cific Coast Conference rules is scored
on the basis of three points per
match, one for the first nine, one for I
j the second, and one for the total of
j both.
Stanford's varsity golf team ram
bled all over California's offerings,
23-4, Saturday, in their third straight
breather-win in P.C.C. play.
The possibility of the Bears' be
■ ing able to do much against Eddie j
Twiggs' fairway's panzer division had
never occurred to any serious golfer i
anyway, so the rout proved only that ;
Stanford has another national cham
pionship squad on its hands. Bud
Brownell, pointing for the national
individual honors which were denied
! him last year by Earl Stewart, turned
in a one-over-par 72 in topping j
Berkeley's best, Curt Benton.
CARDS PRACTICE
It was a big practice day for most
j of Stanford's roster. The top-rank
ers sewed it up so thoroughly in
I the morning rounds that Coach Ed-
I die Twiggs put his nevcr-had-a
chance gang into the doubles com
petition in the afternoon. No local
: golfer lost an entire match, Trap
| hagen and Wilson dropping one nine
apiece in the morning rounds and
Hayes-Helleman and Phillips-Cord
ingly losing the same amount in the
afternoon.
So far this season, U.S.C., U.C.L.A..
and Cal together have been able to
accumulate only 12 points against
Stanford's 69 in conference play.
The Cards tipped U.C.L.A. 25-2,
U.S.C. 21-6, and Cal 23-4.
