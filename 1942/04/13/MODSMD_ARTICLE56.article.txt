# Nelson-Hogan Tied In Pro-Golf Meet
## 
### 
AUGUSTA. Ga„ April 12 (UP).—
Byron Nelson blew a three-stroke
lead today when the pressure got
too heavy down the stretch and
ended in a tie at 280 with Ben Hogan
in the $5,000 Masters golf tourna
ment.
Nelson and Hogan will play an
18-hole play-off for the title to
morrow.
The bends on the highways would
n't be so hard to negotiate if a lot
of drivers would take the bends out
of their elbows.
