# Library Pranksters Should be Expelled
## 
### 
IN a University humming with war research
and preparedness activity there is no room
for such stupid obstructionists and mental chil
dren as those students who Thursday night
sounded a siren in the library and then set off
firecrackers as students evacuated the blacked
out building. Yes, it was a false alarm.
Frankly, Stanford, as a student body, was a
little slow waking up to its duty and in sparking
up interest in the war. Many students still take
it passively. But for the most part, we are now
going full blast on a win-or-die training basis.
What our doctors and engineers and research
departments are doing daily for America is
amounting to a record of which we can be
proud.
Thursday night's episode is the only black
chapter in the book which chronicles Stanford's
participation in the war to date. We hate to have
to record that event. Laying the scene for a
possible first-class panic is a poor excuse for
fun.
We hope the police track down the persons
responsible. We further ask the Administration
or Men's Council—whoever handles the case—
to expel the guilty students from Stanford. And
we would endorse a commitment of these per
sons to an alien evacuation camp, if such were
possible, for the mentally unbalanced can be
just as dangerous as the fifth-columnists and the
saboteurs.
Early financial reports indicate Friday's
Sophomore Carnival was a tremendous suc
ccss and that Stanford's enthusiasm will guar
antee a more than satisfactory Convalescent
Home Week. The Soph Carnival committee
and all those students helping to stage the
event deserve a real hand.
