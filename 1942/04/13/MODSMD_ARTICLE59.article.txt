# Get There Fustest
## 
### 
THE unique and indeed sensational manner
in which India has used Britain's present pre
dicament as a lever with which to pry from the
Empire her long - sought - after independence
should not blind the United Nations to the prac
tical strategic aspects of the situation.
The cardinal point to make at this time is that
the problem facing the Allies in regard to the
Indian theater is exactly the same that faced
them in Poland, in Norway, in France, in the
Balkans, and in the Far East. The political
aspects of the Indian situation are relatively
unimportant—the problem still is, and always
was, getting there fustest with the mostest.
India must not be lost. Not only would her
capture give the Japanese a chance to form a
direct line of communication and supply with
Nazi Europe, but it would cut off all Allied aid
from a very important—and perhaps ultimately
decisive—theater of war, China.
Whether they like it or not, the Indians must
be assisted in their fight against the Japanese—
assisted by a deluge of supplies, munitions and
manpower from America, Britain and China.
You ask how much? Enough to do the job.
There must be no confusion about the re
sponsibility for the defense of India. If India
falls, let us not hear that the Indians brought it
upon themselves because of their unreasonable
demands. If India falls, it will be the Allies'
loss, and it will be the Allies' fault.—Vic Mina

The Civilian Defense Council meeting of
last Friday brought out a point which is of
interest to every student.
In the event of future blackouts, students
studying in the library are asked not to con
gregate in front of the building, but to evacu
ate and head for home. Also, they are asked
not to light cigarettes.
Remember: Get out, go home, and, if
bombed, drop and lie flat.
