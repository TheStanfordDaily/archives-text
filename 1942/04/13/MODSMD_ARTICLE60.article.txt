### AMIE REICHERT 
I7VERY once in a while you come across a small
foreign dispatch which isn't especially out of the
ordinary in itself but which serves to bring home the
incredible complexity and the world-wide scope of
this wox-ld mess.
I read such a story last night as it came over the
United Press machine. It was a report from Chung
king which told of increased Japanese fifth column
activity in Afghanistan in order to obtain informa
tion on Soviet military preparations. The Japanese
agents are supposedly under the tutelage of Mr. Ko
bayshi Kikuo, the Japanese minister in Kabul, Afghan
istan.
These arc the bare facts of the story. Now for all
the implications, ramifications, what have you.
The place: Afghanistan is one of those strategic
countries which is expected to play an important part
in the Axis drives through the Middle East and Near
East.
The country is right next door to British-held, oil
rich, jittery Iran on one side; on another side it has
a common frontier with India; another side touches
Soviet Russia; another frontier meets China.
Afghanistan would be valuable in Axis hands for
an attack on any one of these countries—all part of
the Axis world-encircling strategy.
Axis control of Afghanistan would put the enemy
in a dandy spot to sever the lifelines between Britain,
the United States, and Russia, and thereby ruin any
plans the Allies may have for a spring offensive in
that part of the world.
Last year Afghanistan expelled 178 Germans and
78 Italians, but no Japanese. There are plenty of them
in the country, especially many Japanese engineers
who were supposedly sent to help build highways.

HTHE people: Mr. Kikuo is a great friend and asso
ciate of former Japanese Premier Gen. Senjuro
Hayashi, who in turn is leader of the Japanese Mos
lems. Gen. Hayashi is remembered by Indian Mos
lems as the man who has consistently appealed to
them to rise up against the British and overthrow them
in India.
Japanese fifth-column activity of this sort has been
going on for some time now within India too, along
with the usual amount of Gei'man hell-raising.
The recent developments in India give good rea
son for the United Nations to be queasy about fifth
column activity in that part of the world. The Indians
are going to be disunited enough as things stand, with
out the introduction of a foreign fifth column, or a
foreign-stimulated group.
Reports such as these indicate the tremendous scope
of the Axis plans. Up until a year or six months ago
people laughed when anyone mentioned German geo
politiks. Anyway, only a few of the especially learned
had ever heard of such a thing or gave credence to
it, even though Adolf Hitler wrote a fat book about it.
♦ All of which goes to prove that in an Axis-ordered
world, no country is an island entire unto itself; the
bell tolls for all of us.
