# BULL SESSION
## SO LONG, PAL 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
r LUCK, fellow, you played it the hard
way, and you lost. For a while there it
looked as though success might have been yours,
but no, the cards were against you.
All the way, your fight was ours. When you
had him cornered, we cheered; when he got you
against the wall, the nation held its breath.
Now we mourn your passing. Right up to
the last, yours was a good fight, a hard fight.
When at last he got you, before your job was
done, wc knew that he would never be able to
drag you through the courts. Wc knew that you,
like Errol Flynn, would die with your Brooks
Bros, boots on.
He would like to have seen you burn. He
would like to have ben able to gloat over you
as you languished in the Death House. But he
didn't get you. Ha ha, you had the last victory.
You fooled him. Your death was as spec
tacular as your life. You died on Sunday, for
no other day would have done. You died as you
lived, in full color. On your lips, I know, were
Tennyson's great words: "Let there be no moan
ing at the bar, as I go out to sea." Sic transit
gloria.
Valhalla will hail you, B-B Eyes. You will
be welcomed by the other immortals, you will
be recognized for what you are, a great crusader.
* * * w
/ ET TRACY, was your cry and it has been
* ours. He shot your pal who was doing all
right with the Bird Club, and he has ruined our
digestion on more than one morning.
He has chased more underworld characters
than Tom Dewey ever thought of, even in the
height of his campaign, and has never appre
hended one of them through his own efforts.
He has been pinned in pits, packed in par
affin, tricked into traps, all through his own
stupidity; he has emerged only through the cu
riosity of some doddering great aunt, or some
wife's recollection of her late husband's trade
as a boiler maker.
Some one will get him for us, B-B Eyes. He
can't go on forever. Sometime the wax won't
melt, or the caisson have a wooden floor, and
then he will be all through. Then wc won't have
to pick up the funny paper with trembling
hands, fearful of Dick Tracy's latest predica
ment.
Rest, B-B Eyes, Rest In Peace.
