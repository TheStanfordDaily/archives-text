r pIE EDITOR, SIR:
Sincc I am one of those possible fifth-columnists
who will have new homes built for us, be fed better
than we've been fed before, clothed, and paid a sal
ary, I would like to comment on an editorial which
appeared in The Stanford Daily last Thursday titled,
"For Efficiency's Sake" before the government decides
to "profit from the visible results achieved by cold
efficiency in Russia and Germany" and decides to shoot
us.
The statement that "Ideals are fine in peacetime"
but that, "You can't hang onto your ideals and fight
successfully someone who has junked his, at least for
the time being" sounds like something coming from a
dictatorship and is entirely out of line with the order
of things here in America. If we American citizens
who are being evicted from our homes did not be
lieve that come what may, what we like to call the
American way would not be observed, the present
situation would have alienated from this country
thousands of loyal American citizens.
Furthermore, I don't see anything "humane" in
feeding, clothing, and paying American citizens, even
though they are of Japanese ancestry, for being drafted
for labor instead of for the army.
