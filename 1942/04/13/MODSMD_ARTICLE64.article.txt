"THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER," now playing at the Fox-Stan
ford Theater, Palo Alto.
Monty VVoollcy appeals to the funny bones of the movic-gocr. There's
little plot in the comedy—it's the roar of classic dialogue centered mainly
in the part cf one Sheridan Whiteside (Monty Woolley) that makes the

wheel chair, Whiteside made a point
of meddling into everybody's affairs.
In contrast to his wild temper,
Bette Davis displays unusual charm
in the role of his secretary—in fact,
the whole cast is superb. And that
includes glamour gal Ann Sheridan,
who gives the comedy plenty of
"oomph" as she slyly rolls the dice

George Kaufman and Moss Hart's
satire on the life of Alexander Wool
cott is loaded with fun. On the stage
it was a great success, and so it is
on the screen. You can enjoy two
solid hours of perfect entertainment.
Richard Arlen and Jean Parker
