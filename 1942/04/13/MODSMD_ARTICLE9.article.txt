# C. D. Council To Rehearse For Air Raid
## Wardens to Receive Additional Training; Shelters Considered 
### 
Stanford's Civilian Defense Coun
cil decided last Friday afternoon to
hold an all-campus blackout and
disaster rehearsal "sometime in the
near future" similar to those held
in Palo Alto and other communities
with simulated bombing and other
problems which will bring into play
most of the civilian defense or
ganization.
The exact dale for the rehearsal
was not released but will be an
nounced soon by Council Chairman
Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson.
It was reported to the council that
an air raid shelter for Lagunita
Court was practically completed and
that plans were under consideration
for similar shelters in Roble and
Encina.
INVESTIGATION'S
Further investigation is being car
ried on to determine the shelter pos
sibilities of other living groups such
as sororities and fraternities, and
buildings on the Quad.
A committee is being appointed by
the Council to investigate changes
in the printed air raid instructions
issued in January brought about by
changes in blackout protection, air
raid shelters, and other factors.
The Council did not reach any
definite conclusion in its Friday
meeting on the proposals of further
training courses in first aid, courses
for air raid wardens, auxiliary fire
men and policemen. The possibility
of offering these same courses for
students with credit was also con
sidered.
MORE TRAINING
It was definitely decided, however,
that some form of additional train
ing for present air raid wardens and
their alternates will be given as soon
as possible.
In discussing the blackout of last
quarter, it was brought out that
additional student education will be
necessary to curb lighting of matches
and cigarettes in the open during a
blackout. This was the one criticism
of the clearing of the library during
the last blackout.
