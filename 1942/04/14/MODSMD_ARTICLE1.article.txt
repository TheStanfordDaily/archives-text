# Japs Veer Northward On Chinese
## Enemy Leaves Burma Oil Fields to Drive Wedge Above British 
### 
NEW DELHI, April 13 (UP). â€”
Japanese troops, after driving to
within 40 miles of the Burma oil
fields, have veered northeast in
heavy force in an attempt to drive
a wedge between British Imperials
defending that sector and Chinese
troops battling along the Mandalay
road to the east, it was revealed to
night.
Although they apparently did not
abandon the direct thrust at the oil
fields, the Japanese left only a minor
force to continue it and struck out
northeast with the main body of
troops and artillery.
The Chinese, under U.S. Lieut.
Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, have aban
doned Yedashe, 18 miles north of
fallen Toungoo, and have fallen back
22 miles north along the Mandalay
road to keep their forces on a direct
line east of the withdrawing Brit
ish. The British and Chinese sectors
are about 70 miles apart, separated
by the Pegu Yoma foothills.
JAPS TURN EAST
Communiques from British and
Chinese headquarters pictured the
grave Allied position in Burma as
follows:
The Japanese column driving north
from Prome against the Irrawaddy
oil fields turned east at a point about
20 miles south of Magwe and 40 miles
south of the main oil field. It lunged
across the Pegu Yoma, backed by
strong artillery and air support and
reached a point southwest of Taung
dwingyi, which is on one of the few
east-west roads connecting the oil
field area with the Mandalay road.
At the same time, a supplemen
tary Japanese column continued
driving directly north toward the oil
fields and it has reached Singbaun
gwe, 38 miles south of Magwe.
PRESS CHINESE
And on the Chinese sector, heavy
Japanese pressure was thrown along
the Mandalay road to keep those
defenders contained.
The Royal Air Force attacked two
Japanese concentrations along the
new invasion route east of the Irra
waddy.
American volunteer group fliers
have shot down or damaged at least
35 Japanese planes since roaring
back into the thick of the battle after
being kept out of action because of
a shortage of ammunition and
other supplies.
Meanwhile American and Austra
lian fliers heavily raided Japanese
airdromes at Lae, in northeastern
New Guinea, and added three more
Japanese planes to a victory string
that stands at 36 since Friday.
