# Russ Warn Japs About Cockiness
## Organ Says Fascist Prattle About Siberia Strains Neutrality 
### 
KUIBYSHEV, April 13 (UP). —
The Communis! organ Pravda
warned Japanese "military and fas
cist cliques" today that "their prat
tle about an annexationist war in the
north (Siberia) may cause damage
• . . to Japan herself."
It said that Japanese militarists
"heads have been turned" by suc
cesses in the Pacific and Southwest
Asia and that they were putting a
strain on Russo-Japanese neutrality.
(Lieut. Gen. Yoshitsugu Tate
kawa, who returned to Tokyo Mon
day, has just been replaced in Kui
byshev as Japanese ambassador by
Naotake Sato, skilled career diplo
mat, who reportedly intends to press
the Russians for demilitarization of
Siberi an areas touching Manchukuo
or a permanent fisheries convention
in return for continued Japanese
neutrality.)
CITES AGREEMENT
Appearing on the first anniversary
of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality
pact, which coincides with the spring
thaw in the Far East as well as on
the European front, the unsigned
article put the preservation of peace
under that agreement up to Tokyo.
If the Japanese wished it to remain
in force, it said, they must adhere
strictly to the letter and spirit of
the pact.
Though it believed the agreement
had been of value and could continue
to benefit both countries, it pointed
out that during the past year it had
been subjected to severe sti - ain.
DRIVE SPEARHEAD
Meanwhile, Red Star dispatches
said Russian shock troops have driv
en a spearhead through the German
lines southwest of Moscow and
weathered fierce counter-attacks
which "failed to remove the Soviet
threat to a large city stronghold."
(London reports said the Russians
had driven across the Desna River
near Bryansk and had practically
encircled the city 210 miles south
west of Moscow, 70 miles east of the
White Russian border.)
Enemy counter-attacks on the
southwestern front before the large
city, converted by the Germans into
a key base, were supported by 70
tanks and 60 planes including squad
rons of dive-bombers.
The Germans, reinforced by spring
offensive reserves, were struggling in
several sectors southwest of Moscow
to slash oil Red Army wedges.
