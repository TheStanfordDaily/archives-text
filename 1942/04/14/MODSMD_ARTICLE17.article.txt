# DER 						TAG—STANFORD VERSION
## 
### 

"TAG UP FOR A TOT." Beverly McClurc, chairman of 75 Rohle girls
who will be selling tags at 12 points on the campus today, pins a tag
on Bill Cowden, senior class president. The tags are priced at 10 cents
and up—whatever more students will pay, and proceeds will go to the
Convalescent Home. Preparations to care for children evacuated from
metropolitan hospitals in case San Francisco is bombed, and increased
costs of food, have placed the Convalescent Home in more urgent
need of funds.
