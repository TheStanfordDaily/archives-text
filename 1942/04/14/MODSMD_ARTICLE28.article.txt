# Grannis—On Debate Tour Impressions
## Claim Howard U. Most Unique Spot Visited 
### 
(Editor's Note: This letter was
received from Shorty Grannis,
Staufe.rd debater, who is touring
tin* United States.)
Probably the most interesting uni
versity we have visited is the all
colored Howard University in Wash
ington, D.C. Located on a hill, its
'mall campus overlooks the city of
Washington and the Capitol Build
ings. Supported almost entirely by
the federal government, it has a
modern and beautiful plant done in
a birch colonial style.
The students and faculty were of
course the interesting thing. Iliere
are some 1200 undergraduates and
i.bout 1000 graduate students taking
advanced degrees in engineering,
law, philosophy, mathematics, and
the social sciences.
CAMPUS LIFE
They come from all over the na
tion but for the most part from the
Atlantic seaboard and the South.
Their campus life is much like our
< vn. They have their paper, poli
tics, fraternities, sororities, eating
clubs even to ebony counterparts of
I. Omelette and Belt's (so they said).
As debaters and as an audience no
: chool has surpassed them. They
were keenly attentive and really en
thusiastic about the question at
hand. (They startled us as many of
our audiences have been recruited
through a sort of selective service,
where the professor says, "Now, you
don't have to come to hear these boys
from Stanford but it certainly won't
hurt your grade if you do choose to
come.")
QUESTIONS DIFFICULT
After the debate the audience was
invited to question any of the speak
ers. About every hand in the place
went up and the questions were dif
ficult and to the point. Probably
that instance demonstrates the most
striking characteristic of Howard.
They do not take their education at
college as a matter of course.
They want to get something out of
it. This is natural when one realizes
they each must pay $500 a year to
go there. While five hundred dollars
is a great deal to anyone—it means
twice as much to colored families.
