# 'Aunt Lucie'—Stanford Fellow Held Vital to Farm Activities
## 
### BILL STEIF 
They call her "Aunt Lucie," and it is a fitting tribute to the cordial
and charming Mrs. Louis Stern.
For "Aunt Lucie" Stern, an honorary and active member of the Farm
student liody and a fellow of the University, has been a virtual mother to
many Stanford men and has been one of Stanford's chief benefactresses in

recent years.
"Aunt Lucie" was born in Franco I
and at the age of six months hoi ,
parents came to California to escape I
the German domination of France [
which followed the Franco-Prussian 1
War. She grew up in California, '
saw, in fact, the founding of Stan- j
ford, and then married Louis 1 Stern. |
LIVED IN NEW YORK
She went with her husband back I
to New York arid lived there for
many years, but at the death of Mr.
Stern, about 20 years ago, "Aunt
Lucie" came back to northern Cali
fornia. She moved to Palo Alto from
Atherton about 10 years ago.
Generous and publicity - shy.
white-haired Mrs. Stern is best
known as the donor of several of the
finest buildings at Stanford and in
Palo Alto. She gave the Research
Laboratory of the Medical School in
San Francisco to Stanford. She also
contributed $25,000 to the construc
tion of the Palo Alto Hospital.
furthermore, it was through
"Aunt Lucie's" generosity that the
Palo Alto Community Center and
the boy scout Camp Huntington, two
of the best-planned civic projects in
the country, were built. In addition,
she gives a Stanford scholarship to
the highest-ranking Palo Alto Eagle
Scout and is the donor of the Ruth
Stern Loan Fund on the Farm.
PICTURES IN HOME
On the walls of the library in
"Aunt Lucie's" spacious Palo Alto
home there hang literally dozens of
portraits of young men whom she
has mothered both financially and
spiritually. These are men who are
now almost to the last one success
ful in their chosen lines.
"Aunt Lucie" is a part of Stan
ford—as the A.S.S.U. wisely recog
nized when they made her an hon
orary member of the student body
last year.
