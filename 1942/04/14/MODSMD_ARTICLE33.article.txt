Characterizing collections as much
better than last week, Dick Barger,
head of junk collections division of
Stanford's wartime activities, re
ported a fairly successful weekend.
"Fraternity houses in particular
were a lot better than previous
weeks more informed, better or
ganized," Barger said. "However,
some houses .still failed to do any
thing."
Books and magazines led as col
lection items. Over 500 old books,
including such gems as "How to Get
a Man" and "What Every Girl
Should Know" from Lagunita, were
by far the largest collection items.
There also were more old clothes
collected than before, Barger said.
The Phi Psi, Theta Xi, Sigma Nu,
Delta Chi, Beta, and Sigma Chi
houses turned in some of the better
collections from fraternities, while
Lagunita and Roble topped women's
groups. Lagunita has been consist
ently good since the beginning of the
drive, according to Barger.
Barger works under the direction
of Ed Porter, head of the salvage
division, one of the three main divi
sions under Bob Collins, Stanford
Wartime Activities Co-ordinalor.
