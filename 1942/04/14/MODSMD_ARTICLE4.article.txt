After hearing Paul Davis of the Stanford Associates and a director of
the Convalescent Home stress the need for funds and after seeing Norm
Ross demonstrate "How to and how not to go on a drive," at a kick-off
dinner last night, 50 couples began a three-day series of calls in Palo Alto.
Shelly Parker and Mary Jean Haynes, drive co-chairmen, and Carl
a. Livingston, treasurer, will be in

Room 3 of the Old Union from 7:30
to 10 tonight, tomorrow, and Thurs
day to receive money. They ask that
all collections be turned in as soon
as possible.
L'Omelette has donated a $10 or
der to be awarded to the couple
collecting the most money, while
Dinah's has contributed two of the
most expensive dinners for second
prize, and the Palace has offered a
cover charge for third prize.

printed in Friday's Daily are: Denny
Madison, Chuck Hopper; Virginia
Stammer, Phil Shean; Daisy Day, Joe
Welch; Mary Hoag, Dick Derby;
Peggy Shaw, Bob Harris; Luana
Forkner, Ted Carpenter; Callie Tre
