# Gaels Collide With Indian Nine Today
## 
### 
Weather permitting, Stanford gets
two chances to win a hall game this
afternoon when the Indians and St.
Mary's collide in a doubleheader,
first contest starting at 1:15, Sunken
Diamond. Harry Dyck and Bill
Harms are slated to take the mound
for the Redskins, while Charley
"Spider" Mori will probably be one
Â«iI" the Gael starters.
Tailenders in the league standings,
Stanford almost put the damper on
Santa Clara Saturday last with a be
lated eighth-inning rally which
folded up flatter than stale cham
pagne when Buss Meagher took care
of Ward Walkup and pinch-hitter
Don Fendergrass via the strikeout
and pop-up route.
The bases were filled to. capacity
at the time wtih one out. It looked
like the "big" inning, but Meagher
last-balled 'em to death to retire
the side.
Captain Boch Caruso took over his
second base spot Saturday and pro
ceeded to whack out a brace of sin
gles. Howie Dallmar, the tall bas
ketballer, also appeared for the first
time in left field. Although he went
hitless in three trips, Dallmar came
up with the circus catch of the day,
running in from deep left to take a
fly in the gloved hand just as it ap
pealed to drop "in there" for a safe
hit.
Tbe team seems on the improve
as the season wears on and stands
a good chance this afternoon of win
ning its second tussle of the year.
