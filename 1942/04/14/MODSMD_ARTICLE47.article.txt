# Netmen Cinch League Title
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis team as- j
sured itself of the conference cham- I
pionship Saturday at Los Angeles 1
when it decisively beat U.S.C., 7-2. ,
in the morning and then blanked j
U.C.L.A.. 9-0, in the afternoon.
Although the team's rematch with j
the Trojans scheduled for Friday af- j
ternoon could not be played, it was
not rescheduled again. The only two
matches lost all day by the Indians
were the first and second singles
against the Trojans where Ted Ole
wine and Billy Reedy won over Ted j
Schroeder and Emery Neale, top two
Card netters.
Schroeder, obviously overconfi
dent after Olewine's loss to Cal's Tom
Brown last week, was overcome 6-3,
4-6. 6-4. Neale was never in the
match with the Trojan captain, who I
has never lost a singles match in '
collegiate competition.
The combination of Olewine and j
Reedy, however, was not enough to j
stop the new Card duo of Schroeder |
and Larry Dee in the first doubles j
match. Schroeder and Dee took the i
match 7-5, 1-6, 6-4. Another new j
combine, Neale and Jimmy Wade. |
easily defeated the second Troy
doubles team, and with Schroeder
out of the Bruin matches, Neale and
Wade successfully handled the first
tandem assignment in the after
noon.
Neale, playing first singles in the
U.C.L.A. match, won from George
Treister, 6-2. 6-4. Dee, Wade, Andy
Roberts, and Ben Olson won their j
matches against both teams without
the loss of a set.
