Twenty-five Stanford men com
pleted physical examinations on
campus yesterday for the Naval Air
Corps, and only "very few" were
found ineligible, according to En
sign George Vaughan, Stanford '39,
of the Naval Aviation Cadet Selec
tion Board.
"It looks like these men will make
a good addition to the Stanford men
already enlisted in the Flying In
dians," he said.
Applications are still being ac
cepted and physical examinations
will be given at the same time by an
examining board, consisting of a
medical officer, a yoeman, and a
pharmacist's mate.

in the B.A.C. again today after 10
o'clock for the second and last day
on campus. Those who are planning
to be examined and did not report
yesterday arc urged to sec the Board
today.
