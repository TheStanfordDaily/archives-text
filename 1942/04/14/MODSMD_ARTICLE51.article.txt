# Mermen Train For Cal Meet
## 
### 
Strengthened by the return of Doc
Colyear, Brad Young, and Bill Gard,
Stanford's varsity swimming team
practiced yesterday for its big meet
against the University of California
here Saturday afternoon at 3:15. The
Card freshmen meet the Bear frosh
here at the same time.
Colyear, who resigned from the
team last quarter as a result of an
injury; Young, who was kept out of
the southern meets last week-end
by his studies; and Bill Gard, much
needed diver, who returns to the
squad after making up scholastic
credits, rejoined the squad yester
day.
SECOND-PLACE DUEL
The opposing varsity teams will be
fighting for second place in the con
ference, while the two freshman out
fits, considered to be tops on the
coast and stronger than their re
spective varsities, will battle it out
for the unofficial coast champion
ship.
Off comparative scores, the two
varsities seem to be very evenly
matched. California walloped U. C
L. A., 57-18, while Stanford beat
the Uclans, 52-23. The Bears lost to
U.S.C.. 49-25, while the Trojans beat
Stanford, 43-32.
MORKETTKR VS. GAMBLE
Stan Morketter, record smashing
Bear frosh swimmer, meets unde
feated Jim Gamble, who has offi
cially tied the national frosh 50-
yard freestyle record of 23.6 and un
officially bettered it. Morketter'*
time in the 100 just about equals
that of the Farm ace.
Bill Sheeran and Don Beanston
Cal back-stroke and distance swim
mers, respectively, will face Dick
Narver and A1 Weeden in two torric
races. Both Sheeran and Beanstor
have cracked their home pool rec
ords, while Narver and Weeden have
yet to taste defeat in freshman com
petition this year.
