### H. D. THOREAU 
yV/HILE Stanford's athletic warriors were doing-or-dying for their alma
mater on scattered battlefronts last week-end, it remained for the
sports editor to spend his Saturday afternoon watching Southern Cali
fornia's trackmen put California's team to shame and watching the Ber
keley students put their university to shame.
After Grover Klemmer dropped out of the 440. the Cal followers,
mostly students, saw that they had no chance to make a good show
ing against the mighty Trojans so they contented themselves with
heckling and hooing the U.S.C. athletes the rest of the afternoon.
Bill Schaefer, pole vaulter, bore the brunt of their attack since he had
to perform directly in front of the stands. Every time he started
to go down the runway, the crowd would yell. As a result he drop
ped out at 13 feet (i inches instead of his usual 14-feet-or-better.
Being a broad-minded person, I didn't mind them cheering only Cal
men, although the visitors deserved twice as many plaudits as did the
home boys, but when they booed Trojan winners, it turned my stomach,
figuratively speaking.
Even after the gaudy 47.3 turned in by Cliff Bourland in winning the
race, most of the provincial Northern California journalists and track
fans tried to rationalize the Bears back into the meet by assuming that he
could have won both the 440 and 880. Neither Bourland nor Warren
Smith were fully extending themselves, and to think that an out-of-con
dition Klemmer could have won both races is absurd.
No one north of the Oilman Ridge has ever mentioned that when
Eddie Morris, U.S.C. sprinter, pulled up lame in the 100-yard dash,
the Southerners lost their opportunity to defeat the Peerless Hal
Davis. The previous Saturday lie had run 140 yards in 13.2 seconds,
no mean feat. After a slow start Saturday he was coming strong and
would have finished no worse than second in the century. lie didn't
even get a chance to run the '220. which is his strongest race.
If ever one of Dean Cromwell's teams doesn't do better than what
is expected of them, and they are always expected to win, give me a
buzz at 221(Â»G and let me know.
However, there may be some few students in these parts who aren't
interested in what happens to U.S.C. and Cal track teams, so let us pass
on to subjects nearer home.

have there been two bigger injustices done Farm athletes than
were the sandwiches the Stanford student newspaper handed Hurdler
Ed Hertel and the collective Indian tennis team.
Ilertel prevented last Saturday from being the blackest day of Farm
track history bv running two swift flights of hurdles. His 14.5 came
within one-tenth of a second of tying the Stanford 120 high hurdle
mark, while his 23.7 lows was the fastest recorded by a Card timber
topper in three years.
So, in acclaim of these feats, The Daily runs Don Reiss's picture, show
ing the latter hurdling several weeks ago. Reiss, incidentally, has been
abed with the Victory measles for the past three days and couldn't make
the Raisin City jaunt.
Saturday morning and afternoon the greatest tennis team ever as
sembled at one college at one time wiped up the semi-dry courts with
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. tennis teams. This team represented Stanford and
cinched the conference title. The scores of their matches were 7-2 and
9-0. hardly close.
In recognition for this mighty achievement The Daily prints not s
word about the tennis team.
Hertel and Johnny Lamb, net coach, could well repeat Joe Jacobs' im
mortal words, "We wuz robbed."

(> NE , WALK in nine innings Saturday certainly disproves the "moderr
wild man" title hung on Bill Wilson last week. . . . Personally, I don'l
think B-B Eyes is dead. . . . Let the bells toll for the coachless swimming
team that walloped the Bruins and gave the championship Trojans a rur
for their money in the Southland last week. . . . Frosh trackmen Johr
Fulton, A1 Hoisch, and Jim Pettit hung up marks Saturday that cannot be
equalled by any of their varsity brethren.
