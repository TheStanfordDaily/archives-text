THERE is an idea abroad that efficiency is
the antithesis of humanitarianism. Following
logically from this premise has come the theory
that the United States, in order to beat its totali
tarian enemies (which are efficient, among other
things) must junk humanitarianism for the du
ration. Translated into concrete factors, we find
that there are those among us who have con
cluded that the U.S. policy toward the Japanese
aliens and citizens in the Pacific danger areas
has been wishy-washy, expansive, and all-to
gether too "humanitarian."
We grant that a democracy, by its very nature,
is more inefficient than a dictatorship. We grant,
also, that we most assuredly want to win the
war. However, it is clearly evident that slipshod
reasoning based on an essentially false premise
will neither help the United States to win the
war nor the peace.
There is no paradox in the statement that
efficiency and humanitarianism can be com
pletely compatible. Further, in the case of the
Japanese, what looks like lovely light pink ideal
ism is cold-blooded, long-range practicality.
First, every Japanese who is a suspect fifth
columnist is in jail—not in Owens Valley. Of
course, there are many fifth-columnists as yet
undiscovered. That is why the entire Japanese
population is being moved inland. They'll be
well guarded. Don't worry.
Second, those Japanese will be working for
the salary the government pays them. The land
will be gotten under cultivation as soon as pos
sible—and the Pacific Coast needs that truck
garden produce.
Third, don't forget that there is many a loyal
American who has been removed from the dan
ger area for no other reason than that his grand
father wore a kimono instead of a pair of pants.
He doesn't know where his family or his friends
are. He sold his entire household and business
goods at panic prices, and took only what he
could carry with him.
It is this third point which reguires the most
consideration. No other nation in the world is
as heterogeneous as the United States. And
we all live together in peace. In the case of the
Japanese, the Chinese, the Negro, the race bar
rier has not been broken by intermarriage to
any great extent, as it has been among the
"whites." We must continue to live together—
all of us—now and forever. That's America.
Did you ever hear of a German Jew (outside
of those who have been officially "Aryanized")
who did not hate Hitler? Nobody has been more
"efficient" about Jews than Hitler. And yet the
German Jews were loyal.
Those loyal American-Japanese could become
a solid bloc of America-haters, if the country to
which they had given their allegiance and their
trust failed them in this, the worst hour of their
lives. The advocates of "efficiency" had better
weigh well the trifling difference between sev
eral thousand Japanese fifth-columnists and sev
eral hundred thousand, before they put their
program into effect.—Jean Nowell

THERE is an idea abroad that efficiency is
the antithesis of humanitarianism. Following
logically from this premise has come the theory
that the United States, in order to beat its totali
tarian enemies (which are efficient, among other
things) must junk humanitarianism for the du
ration. Translated into concrete factors, we find
that there are those among us who have con
cluded that the U.S. policy toward the Japanese
aliens and citizens in the Pacific danger areas
has been wishy-washy, expansive, and all-to
gether too "humanitarian."
We grant that a democracy, by its very nature,
is more inefficient than a dictatorship. We grant,
also, that we most assuredly want to win the
war. However, it is clearly evident that slipshod
reasoning based on an essentially false premise
will neither help the United States to win the
war nor the peace.
There is no paradox in the statement that
efficiency and humanitarianism can be com
pletely compatible. Further, in the case of the
Japanese, what looks like lovely light pink ideal
ism is cold-blooded, long-range practicality.
First, every Japanese who is a suspect fifth
columnist is in jail—not in Owens Valley. Of
course, there are many fifth-columnists as yet
undiscovered. That is why the entire Japanese
population is being moved inland. They'll be
well guarded. Don't worry.
Second, those Japanese will be working for
the salary the government pays them. The land
will be gotten under cultivation as soon as pos
sible—and the Pacific Coast needs that truck
garden produce.
Third, don't forget that there is many a loyal
American who has been removed from the dan
ger area for no other reason than that his grand
father wore a kimono instead of a pair of pants.
He doesn't know where his family or his friends
are. He sold his entire household and business
goods at panic prices, and took only what he
could carry with him.
It is this third point which reguires the most
consideration. No other nation in the world is
as heterogeneous as the United States. And
we all live together in peace. In the case of the
Japanese, the Chinese, the Negro, the race bar
rier has not been broken by intermarriage to
any great extent, as it has been among the
"whites." We must continue to live together—
all of us—now and forever. That's America.
Did you ever hear of a German Jew (outside
of those who have been officially "Aryanized")
who did not hate Hitler? Nobody has been more
"efficient" about Jews than Hitler. And yet the
German Jews were loyal.
Those loyal American-Japanese could become
a solid bloc of America-haters, if the country to
which they had given their allegiance and their
trust failed them in this, the worst hour of their
lives. The advocates of "efficiency" had better
weigh well the trifling difference between sev
eral thousand Japanese fifth-columnists and sev
eral hundred thousand, before they put their
program into effect.—Jean Nowell
