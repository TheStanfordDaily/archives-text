# Hello, U.S.O.
## 
### 
SO far only one fraternity house or eating
club has entertained at lunch or dinner
soldiers from the Page Mill Road camp, to our
information. The sororities and women's halls
have been doing a praiseworthy job along this
line ever since the call went out, but not a peep
has come out of the men.
What is this division of the U.S.O. student
committee planning for the immediate future?
Why haven't they done it sooner?
Also, we would like to suggest that the direc
tor and cast of the Spring Show consider the
possibility of putting on an extra performance
this year for the soldiers in the nearby camp.
