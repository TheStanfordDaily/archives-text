# Libe Improvement

### 
SOMEONE suggested recently an improve
ment in the facilities of the Main Library.
Why not have a book return slot from the out
side feeding into the Reserve Book Room?
This would be a service to students wishing
to return books after hours, over week-ends on
Saturday nights, and on week-day mornings
when hurrying to eight o'clocks (usually you
have to fight your way through or around a big
crowd in front of the reserve desk).
This is, of course, a subject of minor impor
tance, but the convenience would be of added
service to the student body, and save students
a good bit in fines.
