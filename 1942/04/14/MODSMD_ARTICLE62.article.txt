### AMIE REICHERT 
r object of all the haggling is Madame Vichy.
The question is who will win her? Both the
U.S. and Nazi Germany are doing their best wooing,
and certainly the odds are very much in favor of the
Nazis for they are within shooting range and we
are not.
Poor old Petain is in a bad spot. He wants fascism
for France, a nice French brand of it, but his people
don t seem to agree with him. He has his hands full x
what with sabotage and the Free French and Laval
and Darlan and Hitler and V for Victory, not to men
tion V for Verboten.
Petain's problem is to make his kind of fascism ac
ceptable to the French people (it is thus far accept
able to Der Fuehrer) and at the same time keep his
German masters happy. To accomplish the second
means to render the first completely impossible. It is
simply that the French people perhaps can be fooled
while Vichy aids the Nazis in Libya, while she sends
them supplies through French North Africa, while
she allows the Germans use of bases in Tunisia and
at Dakar, but they cannot stand Pierre Laval.
Hitler wants him in the government and the French
people want him in Tibet—or Siberia or Lapland. They
will never rest under Petain's fascist regime if Laval
is a part of it. The old Marshall knows this, and quite
frankly he is perplexed. He hesitates, he doesn't
know quite how to handle this one.
While he deliberates U.S. Ambassador Leahy comes
and goes. He promises U.S. resumption of food ship
ments to French North Africa in return for cessa
tion of Vichy aid to the Axis.
While Petain ponders Laval comes and goes. He
promises that the Nazis will free all French prisoners,
allow the Vichy government to move to Paris, and
reduce France's occupation costs, if he (Laval) is taken
into the government.
While the old Marshal deliberates, the Nazis (and
Laval) decide to help him make up his mind. They
turn the screws a leetle bit tighter (just for a better
fit, you understand) and the result is these demands
which reportedly came from Laval and his German
buddies yesterday:
(1) Petain's regime is to adopt immediately a policy
of closest collaboration with the Axis by taking an
active role in the war against Russia and the U.S.
(2) Vichy must dismiss all ministers, generals, and
political leaders who are known to be pro-Allies.
(3) Petain must give executive power to those who
during the last 18 months pressed for collaboration (in
other words, Laval).
(4) Further indecision by Vichy is "intolerable and
is tantamount to a decision against the Axis which
means suicide of France."
* * * *
W/E DO not of course know to what extent the Vichy
regime has already co-operated with the Nazis,
but it is reasonable to suppose that Petain has been
dealing right along; he has had to. One thing is cer
tain, and that is that if Laval gets in, the Vichyfrench
will in effect become full military allies of the Ger
mans.

reduce France's occupation costs, if he (Laval) is taken
into the government.
While the old Marshal deliberates, the Nazis (and
Laval) decide to help him make up his mind. They
turn the screws a leetle bit tighter (just for a better
fit, you understand) and the result is these demands
which reportedly came from Laval and his German
buddies yesterday:
(1) Petain's regime is to adopt immediately a policy
of closest collaboration with the Axis by taking an
active role in the war against Russia and the U.S.
(2) Vichy must dismiss all ministers, generals, and
political leaders who are known to be pro-Allies.
(3) Petain must give executive power to those who
during the last 18 months pressed for collaboration (in
other words, Laval).
(4) Further indecision by Vichy is "intolerable and
is tantamount to a decision against the Axis which
means suicide of France."
* * * *
W/E DO not of course know to what extent the Vichy
regime has already co-operated with the Nazis,
but it is reasonable to suppose that Petain has been
dealing right along; he has had to. One thing is cer
tain, and that is that if Laval gets in, the Vichyfrench
will in effect become full military allies of the Ger
mans.
r object of all the haggling is Madame Vichy.
The question is who will win her? Both the
U.S. and Nazi Germany are doing their best wooing,
and certainly the odds are very much in favor of the
Nazis for they are within shooting range and we
are not.
Poor old Petain is in a bad spot. He wants fascism
for France, a nice French brand of it, but his people
don t seem to agree with him. He has his hands full x
what with sabotage and the Free French and Laval
and Darlan and Hitler and V for Victory, not to men
tion V for Verboten.
Petain's problem is to make his kind of fascism ac
ceptable to the French people (it is thus far accept
able to Der Fuehrer) and at the same time keep his
German masters happy. To accomplish the second
means to render the first completely impossible. It is
simply that the French people perhaps can be fooled
while Vichy aids the Nazis in Libya, while she sends
them supplies through French North Africa, while
she allows the Germans use of bases in Tunisia and
at Dakar, but they cannot stand Pierre Laval.
Hitler wants him in the government and the French
people want him in Tibet—or Siberia or Lapland. They
will never rest under Petain's fascist regime if Laval
is a part of it. The old Marshall knows this, and quite
frankly he is perplexed. He hesitates, he doesn't
know quite how to handle this one.
While he deliberates U.S. Ambassador Leahy comes
and goes. He promises U.S. resumption of food ship
ments to French North Africa in return for cessa
tion of Vichy aid to the Axis.
While Petain ponders Laval comes and goes. He
promises that the Nazis will free all French prisoners,
allow the Vichy government to move to Paris, and
reduce France's occupation costs, if he (Laval) is taken
into the government.
