# OFF-COLOR JOURNALISM

### Bud Ames, out of Agony 
J SWORE I'd never ever do "it" again—write a Bull
Session column I mean. Maybe some of you can re
member back just a couple of years ago when I used
to smell up this column every day trying to cover (in
six inches of type) such fathomless problems as "Will
Gliders Be Used to Invade England" and "What Docs
and Doesn't the Stanford Woman Have?"
Well, you know people, don't you? The people who
liked my column hadn't gotten far enough in school
to write me a letter commending my work; and the
people who thought my columns smelled up the joint,
wrote me and said, ". . . Your work smells up the
joint."
I'm not one who thrives on criticism like Prescott
Sullivan and other good journalists, so slipping quietly
into retirement, I took the pledge at the Samaritan
Institute and swore never to ever write for this col
umn again. So here I am, never writing for this
column again—like mad.

JOURNALISM has been kind. It has brought me into
** contact with some of the most stimulating per
sonalities I've met since Lee, Andre, Mora, and Frank
waltzed into my life.
Take, for instance, Harvey Wing. Everybody in San
Francisco knows Harvey Wing. He's one of the old
newspaper school who wouldn't be seen in any of San
Francisco's districts—there are several—without a
blue serge suit, fedora, and a gardenia in his button
hole.
The other evening we were discussing that off
colorish play, "Good-Night Ladies," which Harvey said
he liked, and which I said he liked because of the
strip-tease in it.
"Yeah, dat really bodthers me," Harvey chirped in
his Brooklynese. "I'm like ihe guy they told that a
nude woman was going to ride a white hawse bareback
down Market Street at noon the next day.
"I'll be dere, I'll be dere, the guy says, I ain't seen
a white hawse in 20 years."
Journalism is a grand profession. Simply filled with
intellectuals.

A LOT of stories that come over the wires never get
onto the printed page. I've been saving them, so
I thought I'd pass a couple along to you. These stories
actually were meant for publication, and they follow,
word for word, exactly as they came over the tele
type wire:
LONDON, Oct. 12 (UP). —Babies were suggested
today as bonds of Empire by Gen. Sir lan Hamilton.
Reviewing in southeast England an Ontario and
Scottish regiment, he said that Canadians are guard
ing a most precious charge—"The Heart of the Empire."
"You might get married here and you might have a
Canadian baby born in England," Gen. Hamilton said.
"Think what a bond that would be. Try it."

Here's the other actual clipping I'm passing along.
LONDON. March 10 (UP). —The War Office admit
ted tonight that an order issued by a British Army
command, referring to the various colors of pass
tickets issued to military forces, doesn't mean lit
erally what it says.
The order reffds:
"Members of the Women's Auxiliary Territorial
Service will show their pink forms whenever called
upon to do so."

So now I'll return to journalism, and never write
for this column again. Thanks for your time. I'll be
right home, mom. Hello Freddie, hello Butch, hello
Bertie. ...
