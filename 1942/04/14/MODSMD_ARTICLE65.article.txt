# Anthem Played To Stop Applause at 'Pop Concert'
## 
### 
Forgetting their white tics and tails for a little while, the San Fran
cisco Symphony cut loose with a "pop"' concert Sunday night whose ova
tion was so great that the "Star Spangled Banner" had to he played to stop
the applause.
The "pop" concert occasioned no relaxation of excellence; in fact, the

playing was not only masterful, it,
was spirited, a quality often inhib
ited in the austerity of formal con
certs.
The Tsehaikowsky Fifth was per
formed with all its elaborate em
broidery, but with the gilt left off.
This has been an endearing feature
of Pierre Monteux's interpretations
all season: he is not afflicted with
chronic virtuosity of the baton.
My hat is off to the first horn for
his bauble-less rendition of the
"Moon Love" solo in the symphony's
second movement and to the entire
assemblage for distinguished per
formances.
The orchestra achieved a blend in
the Debussy "Clouds" that actually
made the music shimmer. And in
the Chabrier finale, "Fete Polanaise,"
the musicians were temporarily
transplanted to beer gardens and
ballrooms, and while away got sol
idly in the groove.â€”Covey
