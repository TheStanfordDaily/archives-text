# Great Naval Battle Looms
## Britain Shifts Best Commander to East 
### United Press 
Two new phases of the World War
appeared in the offing yesterday.
To meet the threat to Ceylon and
India, Prime* Minister Winston
Churchill revealed Britain has trans
ferred her ablest naval commander,
Admiral Sir James Somerville, from
the Mediterranean to the Indian
Ocean.
It was presumed that SomeVville's
transfer meant that the bulk of the
British fleet in the Mediterranean
has been transferred too. Thus one
of the great naval battles of history
was in prospect. (The Japanese fleet
is reportedly massed in the Bay of
Bengal.)
Prospects for a second front in Eu
rope loomed again as Britain an
nounced that her army of tough
ened Commando shock troops had
been turned over to Lord Mount
batten, who has been conferring with
General George C. Marshall, United
States Army chief of staff.
The appointment coincided with a
new peak in R.A.F. operations and
came, too, at a time when the bulk
of 250,000 German troops in Nor
way were reported massing in the
far north.
