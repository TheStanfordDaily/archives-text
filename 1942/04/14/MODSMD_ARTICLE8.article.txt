# Carnival Nets $810, Sunday Movie, $90
## 
### 
The Soph Carnival Friday night
took in a total of $810. Each con
cession was allowed $5 for expenses,
and until the bills from each living
group are submitted, the clear profit
will not be known.
The Sunday movie took in $90,
from which the film rent, tax, and
expenses of the hall must be de
ducted. Attendance hit a low of 449,
probably due to the pop concert;
until Sunday, the movie crowds have
averaged 750 with 900 attending
"Anna Christie."
