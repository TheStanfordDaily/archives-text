# Collaborationist Laval Named Premier of Vichy; Petain Abandons Control
## New Head Given Complete Command To Name Cabinet to Stop Hitler From Setting Up French Gauleiter 
### 
VICHY, Wed., April 15 (UP). â€”Pierre Laval, the collaborationist, lias
been named premier, with full control of the French government, includ
ing the right to pick his own cabinet, in an attempt to prevent Adolf
Hitler from setting up a French "Gauleiter" in Paris, it was reported today.
(The reference to a Paris Gauleiter was not explained but Free French

sources in London said Hitler plan
ned to set up a puppet government
in Paris to rule all of France in the
event he decided to take over unoc
cupied France.)
Chief of State Marshal Philippe
Petain has abandoned all pretense
to government control, Vice Pre
mier Admiral Jean Darlan has re
linquished command of the French
army, navy, and air force, and all
control has been centered on Laval,
who will be technically responsible
to Petain, it was reported.
The government shuffle "on a new
basis," the full extent of which will
be revealed Thursday, was an
nounced in a communique following
a meeting of Laval, Marshal Henri
Philippe Petain and Admiral Jean
Darlan, whom Laval replaces as
vice premier.
(Allied diplomats in London saw
a grave threat in the shake-up and
feared that the still powerful French
fleet and strategic bases in North
Africa might be turned over to the
Germans. Free French sources in
London said there were reports that
Adolf Hitler planned to set up a pup
pet government in Paris to rule all
of France in case he decided to take
over the unoccupied part, and that
this threat may have been used on
Petain to induce him to take Laval
back into the Vichy regime.)
Coincident with the shake-up, the
government here announced it had
rejected Washington's explanation
for the appointment of a U.S. con
sul general at Brazzaville, capital of
French Equatorial Africa, which is
controlled by the dissident Gen.
Charles DeGaulle. A half hour later
the rejection was withdrawn, how
ever, without explanation.
