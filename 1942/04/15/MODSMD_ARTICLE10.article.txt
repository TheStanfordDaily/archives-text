# Daily Schedules Business Tryout
## 
### 
Because he feels that many try- |
outees lose interest due to the length j
of the period between tryouts and j
promotions, Dan Lewis, Daily busi
ness manager, announced yesterday
that henceforth the trial period will
be held during spring quarter rather
than in the fall as has been the
custom.
Lewis will outline plans at a
meeting to be held this evening at
7:30 in the Daily shack, and he asks
that all those who wish to try out
this spring attend.
The business staff, besides giving
an excellent chance for participation j
in student affairs and for business j
training, has seven salaried positions,
all of which, with the exception of
the business manager, are open to
lower classmen.
Tryoutees are asked to spend two
or three hours a week in the busi
ness office and will be eligible for
promotion in June.
