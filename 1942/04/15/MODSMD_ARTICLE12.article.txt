# Science Is Key To War Power Says Wendt
## 
### 
"Science is knowledge; knowledge
is power; and we have got to have
power," said Dr. Gerald Wendt, one
of America's leading scientists, who
spoke last night in the Tuesday
Evening Series on "The Science
Front in Total War" in the audi
torium of Memorial Hall.
Dr. Wendt showed how all of Ger
many's fine universities have been
geared to a program of war for years,
but he then pointed out that even
with this advantage we have greater
research facilities and more recent
findings on which to base our work.
MATERIALS AFFECTED
Dr. Wendt then discussed some of
the materials that the war will affect
during the war and to an even
greater extent after the war.
"We will probably have no rubber
until 1944," Dr. Wendt predicted,
I "and then it will be synthetic rub
-1 ber." Whether the Japanese de
| stroy the East Indian rubber planta
| tions or not, natural rubber will fall
1 before the synthetic product, he
j stated.
TELEVISION FUTURE
Because of the remarkable work
that has been done with the air-
I plane detectox-s, Dr. Wendt pre
dicted that television will be a full
grown industry at the end of the
war.
In conclusion, Dr. Wendt said,
"Although we are now organized
! for destruction, we can use it for
! decency if we change our values by
| ceasing to worship the dollar and
j instead worship humanity."
