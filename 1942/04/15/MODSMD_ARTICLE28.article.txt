# Kessler Tells Of Standard Oil Hearing
## 
### 
Ed. note. â€”The following letter
was received from Jim Kessler,
one <if the Stanford debaters tour
ing the country.)

One of the first things that we did
was to go directly to the Senate Of
fice Building to "pay our respects"
to Sheridan Downey, who was out
of town at the time and had been for
three weeks.
After we had been given the cus
tomary cards to the Senate Gallery,
the attendant at the desk in the main
entrance hall mentioned the fact
that a very important committee
hearing would be open to the public
that afternoon. The Truman Com
mittee hearing was the one and was
carrying on the now-famous in
vestigation of Standard Oil of New
Jersey and its association with the
German Farben Institute.
FARISH TESTIFIES
As the proceedings began, Mr.
Farish, president of the Standard
Oil Co. being investigated, was re
quired to answer a good many point
ed questions about the company's
alleged refusal to co-operate earlier
with the government and private
concerns in the production of Butyl
rubber. Then he began to read a
very carefuNy prepared statement to
the committee.
Immediately Senator O'Mahoney
of Wyoming interposed a brilliant
line of questioning that he continued
until he started to scold Standard
Oil for not having established plants
in the great state of Wyoming,
whereupon the chairman of the com
mittee advised the gentlemen to
carry on their personal disputes on
the floor of the Senate.
DOING GOOI) JOIi
Although there were a few minor
departures from the business at
hand, the conduct of the proceedings
made us feel that the government is
really doing a pretty good job of
investigating and doing away with
every possible obstruction to the na
tion's welfare and the prosecution
of the war.
