# Prof. Devises Short, Simple Fitness Test
## 
### 
A short, accurate physical fitness
| test has been perfected by Dr. Craig
L. Taylor, assistant professor of
| physiology, which will probably be
[ used to test airplane pilots and other
j men in the armed services.
The Taylor test is not a substitute
, for a doctor's examination, but tests
I the fitness of so-called normal peo-
I pie, apparently in good health with
I no defects, and measures their work
j capacity, stamina, and endurance.
During the past year Dr. Taylor
has studied the effects of extended
j upright posture and standard exer-
I cises on more than 300 Stanford
students and on Army enlisted men.
'.He tested their ability to resist fa-
I tigue while maintaining relatively
heavy exercise.
Dr. Taylor has perfected short,
easy tests and has developed simple,
portable equipment. The test is the
result of research conducted with
funds from the Civil Aeronautics
Administration.
