# Courses in Radio Offered by Army
## 
### 
The Army Signal Corps opened a
full-time school for the training of
radio engineers and radio mechan
ics yesterday at Stanford. Thirty
men have been selected for the 90-
day course.
The Signal Corps will pay the
men who have had some radio ex
perience to study at the tuition-free
radio school. It plans to maintain
a permanent school of nearly 100
persons with 30 of the trainees com
pleting the course every 90 days.
Stanford has rebuilt one of its
electrical laboratories for the radio
school and is furnishing the instruc
tors for the program. A limited
amount of space in dormitories is
being made available to the men in
the school.

Seniors should place their orders
for graduation announcements and
senior programs with the Bookstore
immediately so that orders may be
sent in and delivery made as early
as possible, according to Carolyn
Rhodes, chairman.
