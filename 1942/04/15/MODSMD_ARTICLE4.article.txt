# Haas Discloses Summer Period Pre-Reg Plans
## Tours Out, Barbecue To Continue; Frosh To Be on Committees 
### 
With definite assurftnce that there
will be a sizeable registration of I
frosh and new students summer
quarter, Pre-Reg Chairman A! Haas
yesterday released plans for a sum
mer orientation program aimed at
making Stanford immediately fa
miliar to new students.
Because summer quarter starts the
Thursday following graduation, it
will be impossible to hold the ori
entation program before the new
students register. Registration and
the program will start on Thursday,
classes on Friday, and the orientation
period will last through the follow
ing Sunday, according to Haas.
Chief among Pre-Reg changes
planned by Haas is the elimination
of the campus tours as one of the
most expensive and least popular
events. An informal "Know Your
Stanford Day" will be substituted.
The barbecue will also be returned
to its traditional spot on Stanford
Hill.
COMMITTEE CHANGES

were also outlined by Chairman
Haas and Vice-chairman Barbara
Horner. The number of workers has
been cut from a bulky 50 to a more

more frosh and new students have
been placed on the committee since
they are more familiar with the
problems of entering students.
In making appointments, only those
students who were definitely plan
ning to register for summer quarter
were considered.

With definite assurftnce that there
will be a sizeable registration of I
frosh and new students summer
quarter, Pre-Reg Chairman A! Haas
yesterday released plans for a sum
mer orientation program aimed at
making Stanford immediately fa
miliar to new students.
Because summer quarter starts the
Thursday following graduation, it
will be impossible to hold the ori
entation program before the new
students register. Registration and
the program will start on Thursday,
classes on Friday, and the orientation
period will last through the follow
ing Sunday, according to Haas.
Chief among Pre-Reg changes
planned by Haas is the elimination
of the campus tours as one of the
most expensive and least popular
events. An informal "Know Your
Stanford Day" will be substituted.
The barbecue will also be returned
to its traditional spot on Stanford
Hill.
COMMITTEE CHANGES
Changes in committee structure
were also outlined by Chairman
Haas and Vice-chairman Barbara
Horner. The number of workers has
been cut from a bulky 50 to a more
compact group of about 30. Many
more frosh and new students have
been placed on the committee since
they are more familiar with the
problems of entering students.
In making appointments, only those
students who were definitely plan
ning to register for summer quarter
were considered.
The entire committee listed below
will meet in the Nitery Thursday at
5 p.m. to get the work organized,
and to signify desires as to which
part of the program they would like
to work on.
