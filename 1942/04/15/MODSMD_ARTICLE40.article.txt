r IpIIIS is going to be a blow so drop
your books and grab something
solid like a table, or a pillar-, or a
Kappa — Stanford's mighty track
warriors are going to finish first Sat
urday.
Okay, so it's only U.C.L.A. they're
boating. After their debacle against
!■ resno and San Jose, anything re
embling a triumph is sensational.
The bounding Bruins just haven't
got it this year. Of course, in track
they never have been exactly load
ed. but this year tops them all.
Only Stanford's poorest-ever team
would compete on the same track
with this year's aggregation. The
Uclans tallied 45 counters last sea
son a ,>ainst the '41 edition of the
"Farm Thinly-clads." Returning this
sprint; are 13 of those 45. not quite
a quorum.

r TO MAKE the score even more
lopsided two behemoths, who
will propel various weighted ob
jects unheard-of distances through
the air, turned out for work this
week.
fiank Nor berg and Ed Stamm will
give Ripper Kern a long-deserved
rest by participating in the shot and
diseus against the U.C.L.A.'s. Stamm
can move Ihe 16-pound shot 48 feet
in one push, while Norberg can disc
the discus 130 feet, not counting
fudging.
r l 'ITOSE rumors circulating about
tb it Athorton is going to declare
ineligible every Stanford athlete
who wins bis event this week-end
hasn't been confirmed, but does
sound plausible.
