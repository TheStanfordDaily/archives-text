# Frosh Mermen To Meet Cubs
## 
### 
Four, and possibly six, Califor
nia-Stanford freshmen meet records
may fall Saturday afternoon when
Stanford's unbeaten freshman swim
ming team faces California's unde
feated frosh mermen.
All varsity meet records, in com
parison, seem to be fairly secure.
The two meets, final swimming
events for the year at Encina pools,
will be run off together at 3:15 Sat
urday.
Almost sure to fall are the 50 and
100-yard free style records when
two swimmers unbeaten this year—
Jim Gamble of Stanford and Stan
Morketter of Cal—come together.
GAMBLE. MORKETTER
Both have bettered the 24.8 sec
ond mark held jointly by Harrison
(1927) and Vitousek (1938) of Stan
ford and Aronson (1937) of Califor
nia. Gamble has done 23.2 this year,
while Morketter, standout on the
Bear freshman water polo team
which trounced Stanford twice au
tumn quarter, has done 23.9.
The 100-yard standard of 55.4
held by Lloyd of California also
should go. Gamble has clone 54.9
and Morketter 55.2. Another man,
Don Beanston of Cal, who has brok
en Bear freshman and pool records
right and left, may enter the 100 as
well as his usual 220 race.
BEANSTON FAVORED
Beanston is favored over Dick
Narver, unbeaten in freshman com
petition this year, in the 220. He
has a fair chance to break Paul
Herron's strong record of 2:15.7.
A1 Weeden, frosh captain, has
bettered his own brother's 150 back
stroke meet record of 1:41.2 estab
lished in 1938. Weeden, also un
beaten this year, has done 1:40.3.
Pushing him will be Bill Sheeran of
Cal and teammate Bob Mapel.
The 400 freestyle relay mark of
3:48.8 and the 300 medley relay rec
ord of 3:16.4 also may go. The
freshman team of Weeden, Hank
Saltonstall, and Jack Rainalter have
already done 3:12 this year.
