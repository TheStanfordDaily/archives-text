# Stanford War Workâ€”Act Now!
## 
### 
STANFORD has now reached the point where
its organization for student war work is
complete. We have committees in charge of
U.S.O. work, including dances, dinners and en
tertainments; stamp sales, incorporating a pro
gram of giving scholarships to service men
drawn out of school, for when they return; sal
vage; consumer education; Red Cross work, and
publicity.

This program will be headed by Bob Collins,
Stanford War Activities co-ordinator, operating
in Room 13, Old Union, from 2 to 4 every week
day afternoon. This office will act as a clearing
house to guarantee there will be no duplication
of committee plans or work.

Collins reported yesterday Stanford is as
well organized at this time as any other uni
versity in the country, and much better organ
ized than many. This stands as a tribute to his
own farsightedness and leadership.
How efficiently, however, these committees
will proceed to function, remains to be seen.
The campus should expect periodic reports on
how much of what junk has been salvaged, how
many soldiers have been entertained at what
eating clubs, sororities, and halls and fraterni
ties. In short, now we are organized, let's get
rolling!
But the whole success of the program does
not depend exclusively upon Collins, or his com
mittee heads, or their workers.
It depends upon all of us. On the whole, we
Stanford students have reacted somewhat hypo
critically to the war situation. We must adjust
our own values in terms of expense for enter
tainment, become satisfied with simpler pleas
ures, use our own talents. We must buy our
own bonds and stamps, individually, in routine,
systematic purchases. We must examine our
savings accounts and determine how much
money we can lend the government for vic
tory. We plan to give our lives, if necessary;
why not give our money?
The fact that we Stanford students passed
an aptitude test for admittance testifies to a
certain intelligence. We would be denying our
own intelligence if we did not make the Stan
ford war contribution our own responsibility.

why not give our money?
The fact that we Stanford students passed
an aptitude test for admittance testifies to a
certain intelligence. We would be denying our
own intelligence if we did not make the Stan
ford war contribution our own responsibility.
STANFORD has now reached the point where
its organization for student war work is
complete. We have committees in charge of
U.S.O. work, including dances, dinners and en
tertainments; stamp sales, incorporating a pro
gram of giving scholarships to service men
drawn out of school, for when they return; sal
vage; consumer education; Red Cross work, and
publicity.

This program will be headed by Bob Collins,
Stanford War Activities co-ordinator, operating
in Room 13, Old Union, from 2 to 4 every week
day afternoon. This office will act as a clearing
house to guarantee there will be no duplication
of committee plans or work.

Collins reported yesterday Stanford is as
well organized at this time as any other uni
versity in the country, and much better organ
ized than many. This stands as a tribute to his
own farsightedness and leadership.
How efficiently, however, these committees
will proceed to function, remains to be seen.
The campus should expect periodic reports on
how much of what junk has been salvaged, how
many soldiers have been entertained at what
eating clubs, sororities, and halls and fraterni
ties. In short, now we are organized, let's get
rolling!
But the whole success of the program does
not depend exclusively upon Collins, or his com
mittee heads, or their workers.
It depends upon all of us. On the whole, we
Stanford students have reacted somewhat hypo
critically to the war situation. We must adjust
our own values in terms of expense for enter
tainment, become satisfied with simpler pleas
ures, use our own talents. We must buy our
own bonds and stamps, individually, in routine,
systematic purchases. We must examine our
savings accounts and determine how much
money we can lend the government for vic
tory. We plan to give our lives, if necessary;
why not give our money?
