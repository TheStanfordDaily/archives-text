# More Hayrides
## 
### 
IT begins to look as if students are taking the
tire shortage problem seriously. According
to Police Chief Gordy Davis, there is a decrease
in the use of cars on campus. Maybe this is be
cause tires are wearing thin or maybe because
we are beginning to "wise up" to exactly what
the problem is.
Most of us are saying to ourselves, "Well, I
won't be able to go to the City next quarter if
this war keeps up." Next quarter? Now is the
time to cut down on expensive trips up the
Peninsula and start thinking of new ideas for
dates and means of amusing ourselves.
Picnics have always been the thing during
spring quarter. There is nothing like an after
noon bicycle ride out into the hills with the sun
beating down.
Of course that only takes care of the after
noons. There is still the problem of the after
dark moonlit nights. What's wrong with a lot
of good old-fashioned hayrides, or more house
dances, or more student body dances?
War or not, students still want to go out. It's
always the men who want to wander to far-off
places. Maybe the women can help solve the
problem by suggesting that the dates be con
iined to nearby places. John Horrall
