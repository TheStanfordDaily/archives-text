### AMIE REICHERT 
F>IERRE LAVAL, the son of a butcher, finally weas
led its way into the Vichy puppet government
yesterday by way of a Nazi-forged Panzer wedge.
His friend dear Der Fuehrer pulled the biggest black
mail deal of the century to get him in.
Herr Hitler, pursuing a policy of "speak softly to
your little child, and beat him when he sneezes"
toward the doddering, senile Petain, cajoled and pres
sured, and finally threatened. He had some valuable
weapons, you may be sure: the threat of starvation
for all of France; some 1,250,000 French hostages; and
a plan for setting up a German Gauleiter in Paris,
thus ignoring the quasi-sovereignty of Petain. Not
to mention several thousand Gestapo thugs toting
tommy guns and rubber hoses.
Laval has now complete command of the Vichy
french government and you can begin to expect the
fireworks any day now. The son of a butcher has
great plans for his nation, and you can expect to see
a new France as of now, the kind of France Pierre
Laval has dreamed of arid plotted for all through his
foul and filthy career in French politics. This new
France will be a fitting climax to his industrious years
of treachery and double-dealing.
Laval has modestly made no secret of the fact that
he thinks democracy is dead, that Fascism—Naziism—
is the wave of the future, and a welcome tide at
that. He has always been for all-out collaboration with
Hitler, and that is what you can expect to see now.

r FHIS new collaboration will come from French in
dustries in great measure, and perhaps from the
French Army. But its most flagrant manifestations
will undoubtedly be in the handing over of Madagas
car to the Japanese, and the French fleet to the Ger
mans —IF they can get their hands on it.
For months now the U.S. State Department has been
holding its collective breath over the Vichy question.
They have been playing the old, old game made famous
by that Expert, the Umbrella Man of Britain. Now,
as in the Munich days, appeasement has proved to be
a losing game.
The French fleet has been the main reason for all
the appeasing. The French fleet which, in German
hands, would give the Axis naval superiority over the
United Nations.
Now the effect on this country has been immediate
and electric. Congress is up, and the stock market is
down—way down to its lowest low in seven years.
Congress is hollering for U.S. seizure of Dakar and
Martinique and St. Pierre and Miquelon. But Mada
gascar and the French fleet are the big problems.
What are v/e going to do about them? What can we
do about them?
