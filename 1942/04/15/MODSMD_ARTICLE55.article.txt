"TO ERIt IS HUMAN . .
\LL RIGHT, now, anybody can make a mistake.
He fell into the barge Sunday, didn't he? How
much time elapsed between Sunday's and Tuesday's
strips? Half an hour at the most. Sure, so he died
Sunday, didn't he?
As far as this column is concerned B-B Eyes is
dead. As far as this column is concerned, B-B Eyes
died Sunday, April 12, 1942. This column considers
the matter irrevocably closed, and wishes that people
would have the good taste to refrain from mention
ing that guy to this column as it walks about the cam
pus. Thank you.

is nothing I dislike more than having the
routine of my breakfast disturbed, unless it's
comic strip artists who don't know their own minds.
Yesterday I ordered scrambled eggs from the cook
and finally got a burnt omelette with two old Dailies
folded into it.
The reason was that the cook, while waiting for
the eggs to change from a hyrdosol to a hydrogel
condition, read the article about the Strawberry
Brunch.
"It says here," he said accusingly at me, "living
groups will not prepare lunch at noon."
"Listen," he goes on, "you guys over there prepare
your hash and I'll prepare mine."
This sort of thing happens all the time. This col
umn does not run The Daily. This column has abso
lutely nothing to do with editorial policy nor with
news sources or contents. In fact, this column is a
very small part of The Daily. Just ask anyone on The
Daily.

is another guy that writes for this paper
over on page three. Yesterday he had to put in
his two-bits worth about B-B Eyes. He says he doesn't
think B-B Eyes is dead.
In the same column he chastizes this newspaper for
printing "not a word about the tennis team "who
played a great match and cinched the conference title."
I would hazard a guess that it is the fault of the
sports editor, not The Daily. I therefore looked in the
masthead to see who is sports editor and found that it
is this self-same Slanted Columnist. "Those who live
in glass houses ..."

is another guy that writes for this paper
over on page three. Yesterday he had to put in
his two-bits worth about B-B Eyes. He says he doesn't
think B-B Eyes is dead.
In the same column he chastizes this newspaper for
printing "not a word about the tennis team "who
played a great match and cinched the conference title."
I would hazard a guess that it is the fault of the
sports editor, not The Daily. I therefore looked in the
masthead to see who is sports editor and found that it

He fell into the barge Sunday, didn't he? How
much time elapsed between Sunday's and Tuesday's

As far as this column is concerned B-B Eyes is

Yesterday I ordered scrambled eggs from the cook
and finally got a burnt omelette with two old Dailies
folded into it.
The reason was that the cook, while waiting for
the eggs to change from a hyrdosol to a hydrogel
condition, read the article about the Strawberry
Brunch.
"It says here," he said accusingly at me, "living
groups will not prepare lunch at noon."
"Listen," he goes on, "you guys over there prepare
your hash and I'll prepare mine."
This sort of thing happens all the time. This col
umn does not run The Daily. This column has abso
lutely nothing to do with editorial policy nor with
news sources or contents. In fact, this column is a
very small part of The Daily. Just ask anyone on The
