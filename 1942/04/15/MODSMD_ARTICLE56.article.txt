# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						MEAN MATTER 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
Perhaps the editor who wrote "Enjoy the War?
Destroy That Sticker!'' is to be commended for his
fiery condemnation of the poor taste displayed by the
Soph Carnival's publicity committee, but it is a mean
matter of open shame to all Stanford students that
such literary methods must be used in order to put
over a point.
We all feel sorrow enough over the fall of Bataan,
and as the editor pointed out. there are many of us
who are directly effected by our defeat. However,
there is no object for The Daily to use "yellow sheet"
sensationalism in appealing to the "righteous fury" of
intelligent men and women. I thought such journal
ism, if it can be called such, went out by the middle
twenties. Is there any point in reviving it, and espe
cially on the campus of a great modern university?
I believe it is the purpose of this war to elimi
nate hate and establish some sort of justice and toler
ance in the countries we are fighting. If we here in
America rouse the people to a fighting pitch by means
of a jingoistic press, is there any chance of our com
ing out of that insane complex (and war is insane)
after the battles are over; is there anything to stop
us from destroying that for which we are now pour
ing out, presumably, so much blood, toil, tears, and
sweat?
No American, if he be an American* can forget
the fact that his country is in danger of being com
pletely defeated and subjugated, nor can he forget
that he will soon be put to the test of battle to deter
mine whether or not he will continue to be free and
an American. However, I can see small reason to
deny him the enjoyment of these few precious days
before the conflict by unsettling his mental reason
ing with malice and irrationalism.
