# Fisher Predicts Russian, Jap Turmoil in Pacific Area Soon

### BILL STEIF 
"I believe that the Japs and the Russians will clash in the Pacific area
soon," predicted Professor Harold 11. Fisher, authority on Russian history
at Stanford, in an interview with The Daily yesterday.
Dr. Fisher, who was in the Soviet with the American Relief Admin
istration during the great famine of 1922 and 1923, went on to qualify this

statement by saying that "the Rus- +
sians will not attack the Japs until
they get the full support of the
United Nations. With the Japs, of
course," Dr. Fisher continued, "it is
just a question of when they are
ready."
LARGE RED FORCES
• Dr. Fisher pointed out that the
Russians have concentrated on
building a large air force and a sub
marine fleet for use in the Pacific
and, in addition, possess an army on
the Mongolian front which is vir
tually independent of the Russian
army fighting in the west.
"The Russians," stated Dr. Fisher,
"have been preparing for war for
the last 15 years. Their theory was
that they would be attacked by a I
combination of the capitalist nations
and, though some of the capitalist
countries are now on their side, the
most feared of the so-called capi
talist nations, Germany, is in fact
now battling the U.S.S.R.''
NO NAZI KNOCKOUT
Concerning the western front,
where the Nazis and Russians have
been slugging it out all winter, Dr.
Fisher said, "The Germans will not
knock out the Russians this sum
mer. The fact that the Russians re
sisted the Nazis and, in addition,
launched a counter-attack which has
probably regained about one-fifth of
the territory they lost, indicates to
me the degree of Russian prepared- j
ness."
Dr. Fisher further pointed out
that the reserve supplies which Rus
sia had piled up before the war must '■
have been immense, the U.S.S.R.
having lost at least half of its in- !
dustrial production area.
FINNS CAN'T GET OUT
Dr. Fisher also stated that the
main importance of the Russian
gains has been that "they have given
the Germans no rest all winter."
Concerning the northern front which
the Finns are holding for the Axis,
Dr. Fisher said that "the Finns ;
would like to get out of the war—
but, of course, they can't."
One more point which Dr. Fisher
emphasized was that the Russian
morale is excellent. All of which
strikes an encouraging chord for'the
United Nations.
