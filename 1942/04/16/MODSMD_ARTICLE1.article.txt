### United Press 
Thirteen U. S. Army bombers, in one of the most amazing air raids in
(the history of war, have sunk or damaged eight Japanese ships in (he
Philippines, shot down five enemy planes and damaged more, and re
lumed to their base in Australia with a loss of only one of their number.

The good news from the western
Pacific was counter-balanced by
these ominous developments:
1. Continued Japanese successes in
Burma where the British were faced
with the need to destroy the im
portant Burma oil fields to prevent
them from falling into enemy hands.
2. British admissions in London
that, the Battle of the Indian Ocean
is likely to go to the powerful Japa
nese fleet operating around Ceylon
unless the United States can force a
division by an attack in strength
into Japan's home waters.

man for Gen. Douglas A. Mac Arthur
in Melbourne that Mac Arthur so far
is supreme commander for the
southwest Pacific in name only and
in fact commands only the compara
tively small American forces on that
island continent. The puzzling fail

formation of his supreme command
was brought into the open today,
with a three-way controversy de
