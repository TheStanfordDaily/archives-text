# 'BACK TO FARM' TOMORROW
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
With a Gay Nineties Dance and old
fashioned dress, Stanford goes Back to
the Farm tomorrow. Students and fac
ulty will attend class in the fashions of
1890. Encinamen will not shave their
beards. Robleites will pompadour their
hair.
Women will not swoon and men will
not make love on bended knee, but the
gaudiness, if not the histrionics, of that
gilded age will be revived with some
measure of authenticity.
ANCIENT GARB
The Stanford rough will gather on
the Quad or in the Cellar in turtle-neck
sweaters with circular stripes, in four
buttoned coats and narrow - legged
[trousers, in high collars, bow ties, der
bies, and spats; they will part their hair
in the middle and wear rubber bands

around their shirt sleeves.
Stanford women, sheltered and in
nocent, will stroll up the Row carrying
umbrellas and dragging the dusters of
their black skirts on the sidewalk.
Some will don knee-length black bloom
ers and black stockings. Hat pins, bus
tles, beauty patches, ruffled shirtwaists,
and lace gloves will be common apparel.
COSTUMED WOMEN
The spirit of a pioneer West and a
prospector California will live again
for a day .
The day will end with the Gay Nine
ties Dance, in full-flung fiesta. Cos
tumes of every old-time extreme will be
the vogue, everything but hobnail boots,
which are not in taste for the Pavilion
floor. A prize for the fanciest costume
and for the boy's and girl's costume
most in keeping with the theme will be

awarded by the judges.
Refreshments will be served from an
old-fashioned bar, but they will not be
included in the price of the $1.50 bid.
Bert Whiting's orchestra will furnish
the music, of which all types, old and
new, are planned. Whiting also is work
ing up a community sing idea. His fea
tured vocalist, an NBC artist, is Monica
Whalen; and there may be student en
tertainment in the course of the evening.
MUSIC VARIED
Scabbard and Blade is donating the
blue draperies to line the railing, and
posters and indirect colored lighting
will complete the decorations. All men
will be given a cardboard moustache
when they enter the door, and other de
tails will provide atmosphere for an
evening of wide-open revelry. Bids are
now on sale at the A.S.S.U. office.

With a Gay Nineties Dance and old
fashioned dress, Stanford goes Back to
the Farm tomorrow. Students and fac
ulty will attend class in the fashions of
1890. Encinamen will not shave their
beards. Robleites will pompadour their
hair.
Women will not swoon and men will
not make love on bended knee, but the
gaudiness, if not the histrionics, of that
gilded age will be revived with some
measure of authenticity.
ANCIENT GARB
The Stanford rough will gather on
the Quad or in the Cellar in turtle-neck
sweaters with circular stripes, in four
buttoned coats and narrow - legged
[trousers, in high collars, bow ties, der
bies, and spats; they will part their hair
in the middle and wear rubber bands

around their shirt sleeves.
Stanford women, sheltered and in
nocent, will stroll up the Row carrying
umbrellas and dragging the dusters of
their black skirts on the sidewalk.
Some will don knee-length black bloom
ers and black stockings. Hat pins, bus
tles, beauty patches, ruffled shirtwaists,
and lace gloves will be common apparel.
COSTUMED WOMEN
The spirit of a pioneer West and a
prospector California will live again
for a day .
The day will end with the Gay Nine
ties Dance, in full-flung fiesta. Cos
tumes of every old-time extreme will be
the vogue, everything but hobnail boots,
which are not in taste for the Pavilion
floor. A prize for the fanciest costume
and for the boy's and girl's costume
most in keeping with the theme will be

awarded by the judges.
Refreshments will be served from an
old-fashioned bar, but they will not be
included in the price of the $1.50 bid.
Bert Whiting's orchestra will furnish
the music, of which all types, old and
new, are planned. Whiting also is work
ing up a community sing idea. His fea

Whalen; and there may be student en
tertainment in the course of the evening.
