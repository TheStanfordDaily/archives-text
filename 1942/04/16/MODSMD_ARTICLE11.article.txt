# Dr. Guerard Says France Is Pro-Axis
## 
### BILL F. STEIF 
Appointment of Pierre Laval to
the French cabinet has simply re
moved the ambiguity from the
French government, according to Dr.
Albert Gucrard, expert on France
and professor of general literature
at Stanford, when interviewed yes
terday by The Daily.
Elaborating upon this statement,
Dr. Guerard stated that "this latest
French move definitely swings Vichy
into the pro-Axis line."
Dr. Guerard then explained that
it was Laval who had made Petain
French President after the debacle
of 1940. "Petain," Dr. Guerard ex
plained, "is honest non-politically.
His presence at Vichy can only be
put down to the fact that he has
never believed in democracy. He
would like to be the French Franco."
LAVAL CORRUPT
"But," continued Dr. Guerard,
"Laval is a corrupt politician, an in
triguer. He continued to intrigue
while in the French cabinet and that
is why Petain threw him out last
year. Nazi pressure put him back
Tuesday."
Concerning the French fleet, Dr.
Guerard said that he believes it may
well be used for the Axis. "The
French fleet," he explained, "has al
ways been anti-British because up
till 1940 it has always had to play
second fiddle to the British. Eng
land, furthermore, made a disas
trous mistake at Oran, where they
tried to destroy the French fleet
while the English politicians were
attempting to appease Vichy France.
Britain should either have declared
war on France and attempted com
plete destruction of the fleet or
should have been consistent in its
appeasement policy." Dr. Guerard
also pointed out that Admiral Dar
lan is "violently anti-British."
DE GAULLE GOOD
"The coui-se for the United Na
tions now," Dr. Guerard concluded,
"will undoubtedly come nearer
and nearer to the Free French. In
this they are fortunate, for DeGaulle,
young, handsome, and courageous, is
the only good French military tech
nician."
And there, judging from the copy
of La Victoire—the DeGaullist news
paper —which was on the professor's
desk, is where lie the hopes of Dr.
Guerard.

plained, "is honest non-politically.
His presence at Vichy can only be
put down to the fact that he has
never believed in democracy. He
would like to be the French Franco."
LAVAL CORRUPT
"But," continued Dr. Guerard,
"Laval is a corrupt politician, an in
triguer. He continued to intrigue
while in the French cabinet and that
is why Petain threw him out last
year. Nazi pressure put him back
Tuesday."
Concerning the French fleet, Dr.
Guerard said that he believes it may
well be used for the Axis. "The
French fleet," he explained, "has al
ways been anti-British because up
till 1940 it has always had to play
second fiddle to the British. Eng
land, furthermore, made a disas
trous mistake at Oran, where they
tried to destroy the French fleet
while the English politicians were
attempting to appease Vichy France.
Britain should either have declared
war on France and attempted com
plete destruction of the fleet or
should have been consistent in its
appeasement policy." Dr. Guerard
also pointed out that Admiral Dar
lan is "violently anti-British."
DE GAULLE GOOD
"The coui-se for the United Na
tions now," Dr. Guerard concluded,
"will undoubtedly come nearer
and nearer to the Free French. In
this they are fortunate, for DeGaulle,
young, handsome, and courageous, is
the only good French military tech
nician."
And there, judging from the copy
of La Victoire—the DeGaullist news
paper —which was on the professor's
desk, is where lie the hopes of Dr.
Guerard.
Appointment of Pierre Laval to
the French cabinet has simply re
moved the ambiguity from the
French government, according to Dr.
Albert Gucrard, expert on France
and professor of general literature
at Stanford, when interviewed yes
terday by The Daily.
Elaborating upon this statement,
Dr. Guerard stated that "this latest
French move definitely swings Vichy
into the pro-Axis line."
Dr. Guerard then explained that
it was Laval who had made Petain
French President after the debacle
of 1940. "Petain," Dr. Guerard ex
plained, "is honest non-politically.
His presence at Vichy can only be
put down to the fact that he has
never believed in democracy. He
would like to be the French Franco."
