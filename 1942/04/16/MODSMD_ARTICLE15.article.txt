## 
### United Press 
All day Wednesday and into the night, RAF fighters and bomb carriers
swept relentlessly across the western fringe of Europe again, battering the
Germans' defenses and blowing up their plants and communications lines
in the most sustained and shattering air offensive of all time.
The famed Hurricane fighters are being converted into bomb carriers

for daylight assaults on northern +
France, and bombers are reported j
hauling a new and devastating type I
of phosphorus incendiary bomb on 1
the night raids, which are reducing
Germany's industrialized Ruhr Val- j
ley to ruins. There has been no let- I
up since Sunday, the day shift tak
ing over from the night soon after 1
dawn, and reversing the process at
dusk.
Already, half of Germany's esti
mated 6,000 first-line planes are re- !
ported tied up in western Europe j
and the Mediterranean, unable to j
reinforce the Russian front, and the '
RAF offensive is still gaining mo
mentum as the weather improves.
It was revealed that American
made Douglas medium bombers, j
known in Britain as "Bostons," were
being used extensively, since they
carry twice the bomb load of the
British Blenheims which had done
most of the daylight demolition
work.
