# Hoover Jr. Finds New Map Method
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover, Jr., has invented
a now way to "map" the subter
ranean structure of the earth's crust.
Son of the former President Hoover,
Herbert Junior graduated from Stan
ford in 1925. A patent for the new
method has been granted jointly to
Mr. Hoover and Hugh C. ShacfTer
of Tulare, Calif.
The mapping plan involves "seis
mic prospecting" in which the thick
ness, nature, and depth of under
ground layers can be learned by
means of dynamite-created earth
quakes. The resulting data is corre
lated to determine the likelihood of
the presence of mineral or oil de
posits.
The new method makes it possible
to ascertain the thickness of the
"weathered" or topmost layer of
the earth's crust, and to compute
the speed with which the artificial
seismic waves travel through it.
