# Bookstore Will Pay Out High Rebate
## Students Promised Refund of 8 Per Cent On Total Purchases 
### 
The 8 per cent rebate declared by
the Stanford Bookstore on all pur
chases of the past year will be the
highest rebate paid out since the
boom year of 1929. Students will re
ceive approximately $7,400 in rebates
this year as compared with the
$5,600 refund of last year.
The figures on the Bookstore's
total sales show an increase from
$123,000 for Sept. 1 to April 1 of
last year to $139,000 for the same pe
riod this year. Although this in
crease is due in part to rising prices,
it does represent a substantial
growth in volume of trade.
Despite a general rise in taxes,
particularly sales taxes, the book
store, by reducing advertising and
labor expenses, has kept the total
outlay about the same as last year's.
Rebate slips must be handed in by
May 15. These slips must be signed,
enclosed in a profit-sharing enve
lope, and presented by the actual
purchaser in order to be valid. Pay
ments will be made on June 1.
This year, as in former years, the
Bookstore will also make substan
tial gifts to University institutions
such as the Commission for Student
Aid and scholarships.
