### 
(This letter was received yes- i
terday from Jim Kessler. Stanford
debater on tour, who is in New
York at present.—The Editor)
New York is the nerve center for
practically everything including the
American college fraternity, for it is j
here that the National Interfrater
nity Conference has its offices and j
here that the national policy of the '
organization is formulated.
Yours truly had the pleasure of !
being invited to attend a meeting of '
the N.1.C., and to listen to discus- 1
sions of the outstanding problems
facing the system today by men
who have been leaders in their re
spective organizations.
SERIOUS-MINDED
These men were very serious
minded and fair, for they seemed to '
recognize the shortcomings along I
with the good things inherent in i
fraternities, and they spent a great j
deal of time discussing ways to cor
rect the bad points.
Also there were discussions about
the war and its effect on the univer
sities and colleges of the country, ;
and ways that college students can ]
implement the policy of national of
fense.
BLOOD DONATIONS
In this respect they decided to |
circularize an appeal to the frater- '

nities asking for mass voluntary
contributions of blood to the army
in all cases where blood can be re
ceived by the government.
The special report of the War
Committee was very interesting be
cause of the fact that the fraterni
ties will be asked to follow the sug
gestions made by that committee. In
the report, the N.I.C. asks the
various chapters to anticipate a very
serious decline in the numerical
strength of the chapters and to plan
accordingly.—Jim Kessler
