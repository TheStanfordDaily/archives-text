# Netmen Meet Cal For Title
## Top Match To Feature Schroeder 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
Stanford's varsity netmen take the
courts this afternoon at 1:.'Â»() o'clock
to battle the University of Califor
nia. A victory for tlie Indians will
give them their first conference
championship in seven years.
The Indians go into the match
with a record of three wins and no
losses, and heavy favorites. But the
Bears have only dropped one match
and that to the Trojans, and they
could win the conference title by
whipping the Indians twice. "Cali
fornia has a much stronger team
than anyone believes. We can beat
them but each man must play his
best match of the season," said
Coach John Lamb.
TOP MATCH
The top match of the afternoon
should be the number one singles,
pitting Ted Schroeder of the Indians
against Tom Brown. Brown is a
young aggressive player who has
been improving every day, and who
right now is playing the best tennis
of his life.
Against U.S.C. Brown pulled the
biggest upset by beating Ted Ole
wine. However, according to form,
Schroeder should whip him.
NEALE MEETS SPENCER
Emery Neale draws George Spen
cer of the Bears in the second sin
gles. Spencer is an unpredictable
player, and can play brilliant tennis
if lie is hot. But if Neale can get
back to the game he had last week
during practice, the Indians should
win the second match also.
Larry Dee will be in the third
spot for the Cards and he draws the
veteran Gunny Ammonette. Dee
should dispose of the Bear in short
time. Jimmy Wade will meet the
former junior star, Harry Buttimer,
and Wade should also come through
and win.
