# Freshmen Picked To Beat Cal Team
## 
### 
"We should win," predicted Coach
Johnnie Lamb, expressing his con
fidence in the frosh netmen who
play Cal on the freshman courts this
afternoon. The match, starting at
1:15, will be a preliminary to the
varsity Cal match.
Although both the Cubs and Cards
won decisive victories over Lowell
High, Lamb bases his prediction on
Lowell-men's comment that the
Stanfords play a better game. Play
ing on the Farm courts will also be
an advantage to the Indian team;
he believes.
Ted Myers, fifth-ranking junior in
northern California, is favored over
the Cal frosh's Chip Cheney in the
number one match, while eighth
ranking junior Bob Rutledge is
given a good chance against Ken
Roberts, the Cubs' second singles
man. Dick Thomas, a Southern
California Interscholastic champ,
plays Jimmy Moulton in the third
spot. Bob Craig, Wallace Smith, and
Blaine Murray make up the balance
of the Farm singles squad.
