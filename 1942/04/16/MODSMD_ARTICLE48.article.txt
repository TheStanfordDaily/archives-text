# Frosh Mermen Slated To Outshine Varsities
## 
### 
It's a sad day when freshman teams take the play away from the var
sity, hut the California and Stanford freshman swimming teams probably
will do just that here Saturday when the frosh and varsity swimmers of
the two schools wind up their respective dual-meet seasons together.
Even though the two varsities will be lighting it out for second place

in the conference, no mean
itself, the two unbeaten freshman i
teams, generally considered the two '
finest first-year outfits on the coast,
will take the headlines.
Six of the eight meet records are
definitely menaced by the two fresh- !
man teams, who make a regular j
practice of beating their big broth- [
ers, the varsity men.
The frosh big four—Captain Alan
Weeden, Dick Narver, Jim Gamble, i
and Hank Saltonstall — will have j
their hands full against the Bear
quartet of Roland Shutt, Don Bean
ston, Stan Morketter, and Bill
Sheeran.
Weeden will have to break his
brother's 150 backstroke record of
1:41.3 to beat Shutt. He has done
1:40.9 already this year. Sheeran and
Saltonstall are rated a toss-up, al- 1
though the meet record isn't in
danger.
Records are fairly sure to fall
when Gamble meets Morketter in
the 50 and 100-yard freestyle races,
and when Narver meets Beanston,
Bear standout, in the 220.
Both Gamble and Morketter have
bettered the present 50-yard mark
of 24.8, Morketter swimming 24.2
and Gamble 23,2. Both have turned
in times of 54,9 for the 100 com
pared to the record at 55.4.

Azhar, in Cairo, Egypt, was founded
in 970.
