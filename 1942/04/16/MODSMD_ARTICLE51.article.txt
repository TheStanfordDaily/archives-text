of the day, to drive in a run. The
Cards made good use of eight Navy
errors. Stanford used 1G players,
whose total efforts garnered six hits.
Capitalizing on four errors and
singles by Harry Dyck and Ward
Walk up. Stanford's baseball team
scored four runs in the eighth inn
ing and followed up with a run on
Walkup's double and Boch Caruso's
single in the ninth to come from be- |
hind and defeat the Treasure Island
Naval Base nine, 8-7, on the Sunken
Diamond yesterday.
The ball game, a wild and woolly !
affair which saw Coach Harry Wol- J
ter empty the dugout of substitutes, ;
appeared to be in the bag for the
Navy outfit until the final two inn
ings, when the servicemen tied up
badly in the field.
Dyck, the fourth chucker to take
the mound for the Indians, dropped !
a safety into short right field right j
next to the first base foul line in the j
eighth to bring in two runs and help i
himself to a victory.
SLUMP BROKEN
Walkup's shaking off a batting
slump came just at the right mo
ment, his two hits playing vital roles
in Stanford's win.
Ted Doe started in the pitcher's
box for the Cards and was nicked
for three hits and as many runs in j
the four innings he worked. Harms
gave up a hit and a run during his
pair of frames.
PENDERGRASS HIT
Don Pendergrass, pitching one
inning with the old sore shoulder,
had his offerings pummeled for
three hits and three runs. But when
Dyck came in it was all over for the
Navy, Handsome Harry fanning
three batters and giving up but one
hit and no counters in the final two
innings.
Caruso, with two for four, led the
Indians at the plate. Ray Hammett
doubled in the seventh, his only hit
of the day, to drive in a run. The
Cards made good use of eight Navy
errors. Stanford used 1G players,
whose total efforts garnered six hits.
