JN THE halcyon days of yore, handlebar-mustached and long-drawered
gentlemen practiced the manly art of high jumping in a sitting posi
tion. By that I mean that their position when clearing the bar resembled
that of a yogi with thq itch.
Then came Stanfordite George Horine, who learned from his coach. '
Dink Templeton, who learned from another Stanfordite, Dave Martin, who
learned from an Olympic Club gym instructor, who learned from a five
foot Arab gymnast, who probably learned from the Wajiji Tribe of Cen
tral Africa, how to approach the bar from the other side and lay out,
thereby adding to your height the room formerly occupied by the posterior.
Us pale faces have been able to kick the ante up about six notches to
G feet 11 inches, but we still haven't approached the 8-foot leaps, known
to have been accomplished by the Wajijis on a clear day.
Incidentally, one ol these boys has been seen on the Westwood campus,
so if U.C.L.A. throws in an unknown high jumper Saturday, sporting a
deep tanâ€”watch out,

| ET ME mention in passing and in defense against those vitriolic and
unfounded statements of "B-B Eyes" Churchill yesterday, that I was
in the city Sunday evening grabbing my yearly quota of culture at the !
pop concert with a twist, and therefore take no responsibility for the |
horrendous appearance of the spoil page the next morn.
A blind reporter and an "under-the-influence-of" associate editor are
moving into the glass house tomorrow. I'm inhabiting a little place made
of concrete and steel, so I'll throw all the boulders I want.
Granted that for a Bull Sessioner to err is human, but Mike, let's not
make a habit of it!
