# Toward Disinfected Elections
## 
### 
WHILE the major part of campus extra-cur
ricular activity this week is dedicated to
raising funds to purchase higher-priced wartime
food for convalescent children and to equipping
the Convalescent Home as an auxiliary hospital,
there is a growing campus undercurrent point
ing to next week's elections.
It is The Daily's policy to provide Stanford
with fair, unbiased election news.
Ex Committee this quarter is considering plans
for complete reorganization of student govern
ment, with possible inauguration of the new
system sometime next year, to conform with a
policy of streamlining activities and emphasiz
ing academics.
Meanwhile, Farm politicians are proceeding
to organize for the annual spring quarter elec
tions, most important of the year because of the
number of candidates and the desirability of
available offices. Next week's elections will
be the first trial of the new three-day system,
incorporating nominations, declinations and
elections in that period. Its purpose is to elimi
nate "dealing" between nominations and decli
nations by shortening the time. This step also
is a healthy contribution to the activities de
emphasis policy, because less time of students
actively interested in the elections will be con
sumed.
Another improvement was made this year
when Interfraternity Council elected its officers
prior to the student body election, thereby rob
bing the Row caucus of one of its choice posi
tions, Interfraternity president, which formerly
was handed the runner-up nominee for the
A.S.S.U. presidency as a consolation prize.
As for actual participation in the coming elec
tions, students are urged by Election Board to
turn in nominations, after checking eligibility,
as early as possible on Monday, and declina
tions as early as possible Tuesday.
Election Board is making every effort to guar
antee mistakes of the preceding elections are
not repeated. Ballot proofs will be checked be
fore they are printed, a more efficient counting
system will be used, and tabulators will be more
carefully instructed in their jobs.
All indications, then, point to a speedier and
certainly purer spring quarter election period
than Stanford has experienced in many years.
