# Fraternity Vital Statistics
## 
### 
TODAY'S excellent letter from Jim Kessler,
debater on eastern tour, can well serve as
an example of the profits Stanford is reaping
from the appropriation, which made possible
the nationwide junket, granted Jim and his trav
eling partner, Shorty Grannis.
As Stanford well knows, war is forcing a nu
merical decline in fraternity membership, and
this is the danger mark that means watch out for
financial rocks. We urge every fraternity presi
dent and house manager, in their own interest,
to read Jim's report on page 2 of the National
Interfraternity Conference in New York City.
It contains direct advice on how to CUT EX
PENDITURES, and on how to AID THE WAR
EFFORT while still in college.
One of the most direct methods of contribut
ing to victory will be the blood bank. Within
one year it is expected that every able-bodied
fraternity man in the country will have given
at least one pint of his blood to the American
Red Cross blood bank. The organized blood
donation will be under the direction of the
executive committee of the National Interfrater
nity Conference, composed of over 60 national
college fraternities in the U.S. and Canada with
approximately 2,500 chapters.
Not included in Jim's letter is the report that
fraternity men rank higher in scholarship than
non-fraternity men in the United States for the
twelfth consecutive year. The average rating
of all fraternities throughout the country for the
academic year 1940-1941 is .036 per cent above
the composite all-men's average of their insti
tutions, and therefore proportionately higher
than the average of all non-fraternity men.
The Stanford average for fraternity men is
2.48; for non-fraternity men, 2.46. The all-cam
pus men and women average is 2.53. This
leaves both the fraternity and non-fraternity
men at Stanford with a rating of minus 1, since
anything below the all-campus average is rated
as minus 1.
On the Coast, Oregon State fraternity men
lead with a 10 per cent average above the all
men's average, with only two of the 26 chap
ters on that campus below.

Congratulations and many happy returns ol
the day to Mrs. Louis Stern, the beloved "Aunt
Lucie" of Stanford men, gracious benefactor
and Stanford Fellow, on the occasion of her
seventy-first birthday today.
