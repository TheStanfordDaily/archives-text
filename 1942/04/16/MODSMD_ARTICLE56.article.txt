'J'HE Department of Justice seems to be going at this
business of delousing the nation with a righteous
vengeance, and you have to hand it to them—they have
cracked the two toughest nuts of the lot—silver
shirted William Pelley, and raucous-lunged Father
Coughlin.
The other day Biddle banned Coughlin's blood
thirsty, poisonous sheet, which is beautifully named
"Social Justice." Life magazine last week ran an en
lightening spread on seditious activities in this coun
try, which named names, and Coughlin's paper was
prominent among those mentioned. The editors of
Life had a good name for those sheets. "Voices of
Defeat" they called them.
"Social Justice," probably loudest of all the voices,
had a tremendous circulation which, its editors report,
has increased tremendously in the last few months in
view of a delightful series of renewed attacks on the
Jews and the Administration.
The contents of this paper —and of all the others
in the country—show a striking similarity to the grut
that Joe Goebbels shoots out from Berlin.
The main thesis of these seditionists is that the
Jews and President Roosevelt are directly responsible
for everything terrible in the world today. The sedi
tionist press is hot for simplification. So to avoid any
complications or confusion, they declare with per
fectly straight faces, that President Roosevelt is a Jew,
his wife is a Jew, his children are all Jews, and, in
fact, the entire New Deal organization is Jewish.
Once we get that straight in our minds, everything
becomes clear, of course. The Second World War,
which, almost by definition, was brought upon us by
President Roosevelt, becomes then a Jewish war. The
whole world international mess is Jewish-caused.
And by a direct process of reasoning from this
major premise, the seditionist press goes right ahead
and attributes to the Jews the First World War, the
Civil War, the Depression, the Medieval Black Death,
the rise of Napoleon, and anything else unpleasant it
heax-s about.

r T , HE Communists come in for their share of the fun,
too. But here again the seditionist press believes
in keeping everything neat and orderly and uncom
plicated, so they simply label all Communists Jews
and vice versa.
This has been going on for some time of course and
a good many of these papers have prospered and be
come family institutions in many — far too many —
American homes.
But until December 7 everything that was said was
all within the protective limits of the Bill of Rights.
Recently, however, the seditionist papers have over
stepped themselves. They have come out against the
Administration's handling of the war, urged Roose
velt's impeachment, declared that America is finished
and democracy washed up, and many of them have
openly given their blessing to Naziism and Hitler's
war.
Now Francis Biddle and his Department of Jus
tice are going gunning for the defeatists and the sedi
tionists and "Social Justice" is the first of their mouth
pieces to get the axe. It looks like they won't stop
until they have cleaned out the whole rotten mess,
and that's an awfully good thing.
