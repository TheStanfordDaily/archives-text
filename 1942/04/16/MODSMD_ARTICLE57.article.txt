### MIKE CHURCHILL 
BERRY THE STAMP CHAIRMAN
YOU know what is in store for you soon?
Sylvia Berry is going to sell YOU War Stamps.
Miss Berry is a remarkable woman. A couple of
weeks ago she appeared before Excom, or perhaps I
should say that figuratively speaking Excom appeared
before Sylvia Berry. She was with her co-chairman,
who positively cringed in her august presence.
Someone on Excom had the poor tact to ask Miss
Berry to explain her work. She stood up to her full
height, heaved her bosom in regal indignation, and
tersely snapped that it wasn't Exconi's affair. Then
smiling at them beneficently, as to a group of chil
dren, she told them in a cursory manner what WOULD
be done.
And, by God, it will. Neither you nor I can stop
her. I contemplated staying near home just so that
I wouldn't have Sylvia Berry sell me a War Stamp.
Miss Berry would come right inside our house just to
sell me a stamp.
It's not that I am against the sale of stamps, far
from it. I simply rebel at this idea because buying a
stamp on Sylvia Berry's Stamp Day is now as inevi
table as death. It's no use buying a stamp Wednesday
or Friday, instead of Thursday, as set aside by Sylvia
Berry. No use whatever.
* * * *
r | ,, o SUGGEST it is probably sticking my neck out,
but while remarking to myself that the wrought
iron gate at the center of the west side of the Quad
badly needed a paint job, there came the idea that it
might be patriotic, if at the same time it were prac
tical, to gather up some of the iron used about this
campus in non-essential ways and contribute it through
some charity to the War Effort.
Just how much iron there is about, I don't know.
Whether it could be converted to scrap, I don't know.
Why I brought up this subject, I don't know.
However, if nobody has thought of it, I wish they
would. There is an iron pipe fence between Lomita
Drive and the Quad for half its length. There is a
similar fence between the engineering buildings and
the quad that could be replaced by a wooden fence.
All around the stadium are steel things sticking out of
the ground that might be of better service elsewhere
in these times. There is also a big mesh fence around
the stadium that could go in classified as valuable
scrap.
This is just a suggestion, and I won't feel the least
bit hurt if this iron is still there Monday.

Just how much iron there is about, I don't know.
Whether it could be converted to scrap, I don't know.
Why I brought up this subject, I don't know.
However, if nobody has thought of it, I wish they
would. There is an iron pipe fence between Lomita
Drive and the Quad for half its length. There is a
similar fence between the engineering buildings and
the quad that could be replaced by a wooden fence.
All around the stadium are steel things sticking out of
the ground that might be of better service elsewhere
in these times. There is also a big mesh fence around
the stadium that could go in classified as valuable
scrap.
This is just a suggestion, and I won't feel the least
bit hurt if this iron is still there Monday.

BERRY THE STAMP CHAIRMAN
YOU know what is in store for you soon?
Sylvia Berry is going to sell YOU War Stamps.
Miss Berry is a remarkable woman. A couple of
weeks ago she appeared before Excom, or perhaps I
should say that figuratively speaking Excom appeared
before Sylvia Berry. She was with her co-chairman,
who positively cringed in her august presence.
Someone on Excom had the poor tact to ask Miss
Berry to explain her work. She stood up to her full
height, heaved her bosom in regal indignation, and
tersely snapped that it wasn't Exconi's affair. Then
smiling at them beneficently, as to a group of chil
dren, she told them in a cursory manner what WOULD
be done.
And, by God, it will. Neither you nor I can stop
her. I contemplated staying near home just so that
I wouldn't have Sylvia Berry sell me a War Stamp.
Miss Berry would come right inside our house just to
sell me a stamp.
It's not that I am against the sale of stamps, far
from it. I simply rebel at this idea because buying a
stamp on Sylvia Berry's Stamp Day is now as inevi
table as death. It's no use buying a stamp Wednesday
or Friday, instead of Thursday, as set aside by Sylvia
Berry. No use whatever.

but while remarking to myself that the wrought
iron gate at the center of the west side of the Quad
badly needed a paint job, there came the idea that it
might be patriotic, if at the same time it were prac
tical, to gather up some of the iron used about this
campus in non-essential ways and contribute it through
some charity to the War Effort.
