## SHORTCAKE FREE? 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
The April 14 issue of The Daily carried a picture
on page one which I assume to be a publicity stunt.
It depicted non-commissioned officers and privates
buying tickets to the Strawberry Brunch, while a group
of Zetes look on. I hope I am correct in assuming that
the Zetes furnished the money to buy the soldiers'
tickets, in addition to buying tickets for themselves.
If my assumptions are incorrect, and the army men
were paying for strawberry shortcakes which prob
ably none of them actually saw or tasted, the salesgirls
and the Zete onlookers should be sincerely ashamed
of themselves for taking when they should have been
giving.
We all recognize the Convalescent Home as a
worthy charity, but are not those men in the armed
forces sacrificing infinitely more for the future secur
ity of the kiddies than any Stanford student? Let us
hope that this picture was only a publicity stunt; if
this is not so, it was in the poorest of taste.
