# New Steinbeck Work Leads Sellers in Spite of Fadiman
## 
### 
"THE MOON IS DOWN." by John Steinbeck.
This little book is already settled at the top of the best-seller lists (n«it
ihat this is any criterion of excellence), and my favorite book critic
(Clifton Fadiman of the New Yorker) says he doesn't like it.
I'm sorry, but 1 think that Mr. Fadiman is wrong. Of course, it's dif-

ficult to judge "The Moon Is Down";
on strictly literary merits, since it is
as deliberately propagandistic as
"The Grapes of Wrath." However,
war or no war, "The Moon Is Down"
is a beautifully written and surely
constructed piece of work. Further,
it stands, at present, as a deep and
moving prayer in our time.
SAME TECHNIQUE
Using the same book-play tech
nique he initiated in "Of Mice and
Men," Steinbeck has written a tale
of a tiny village in an occupied
country—any occupied country. The
people of the village, both the con
quered and the conquerors, have
names which might be Dutch or
German, or Norwegian, or English.
Steinbeck was after universality
in his theme—that The People will
not be conquered—"the flies have
conquered the flypaper." Deliber
ately simple, with even some of the
Nazis being depicted as deluded
rather than bad, the book shows
the first shock of invasion, and after
it, the overwhelming rise of revolt
in the hearts and minds of The
People.
IS NOT COMPLEX
Because the characterization is in
no way complex, critics hurl the
charge of "over - simplification" at
the book. Why shouldn't it be sim
ple? Simple, little people by sheer
weight of the majority in the world,
must win or lose the war. And God
help them — and us—if Steinbeck's
belief in them is betrayed.
Mr. Fadiman, it hurts me to say
this, but I think you should go fly
a kite.—Nowell
