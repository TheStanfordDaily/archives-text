### 
NEW DEIJII, April 1(> (UP). —Japanese forces tonight knocked at the
gates of the British-defended Burma oil fields, held the Chinese on the
Mandalay road in a partial pinccr, and threatened to hurl 150,000 fresh
troops into the Battle of Burma in a drive to win the all-weather uplands
before the rainy season. a

Both British and Chinese com
muniques acknowledged further re
treats.
Covered by a heroic detachment
of the king's own Yorkshiremen, the
British fell back eight miles to the
Yenchaung River, 10 miles south of
the oil field gateway at Magwe and
only 14 miles south of the Minbu
refineries.
CHINESE ABANDON CIIAGAYA
The Chinese, pressed by a strong
Japanese force advancing along the
Mandalay road and threatened by
flank attack on both sides, aban
doned Chagaya, 40 miles north of
Toungoo, and withdrew through
Myohola to Yani, nine miles north
of Chagaya and 152 miles south of
Mandalay.
Both the British and Chinese were
reported fighting fiercely and stub
bornly. Many Japanese corpses,
spitted on Chinese bayonets, were
left on the battlefield at Myohola as
the Chinese withdrew battling for
every yard.
KEY POINTS OF DRIVE
The key points in the intensified
Japanese drive are Magwe on the
British-held front and Pyinmana,
before which the Chinese are bat
tling. These towns mark the begin
ning of the central Burma plateau
region and once established on the
heights the Japanese will be able to
attack with tanks and get their
planes into the air even after the
monsoon begins in less than a
month,
Chinese intelligence reported the
invaders were bringing up seven and
a half new divisions for the Burma
front. Two of them, riding in a
transport convoy of 40-odd ships,
were said already to have been
sighted off occupied Rangoon and five
and a half other divisions were re
ported on the way, either by sea or
overland from Thailand.
