## Swingin' Starts At 9 in Pavilion 
### 
Grab a partner and swing 'er to
the Gay Nineties dance tonight at
the Pavilion from J) to if.
It's corn, it's fun, and it's all for
charity. Stanford's Back to the Farm
Day ends tonight with a real old
style T>arn dance flavored by the
rowdy Gay Nineties.
Bert Whiting's orchestra will tear
out the good old-fashioned tunes and
his vocalist, Monica Whalen, will
add the spice and sugar. Between
orchestra numbers Stanford roughs
and their dates will join in commun
ity singing.
BOWERY BARTENDERS
Decorations for the dance will be
in the true Gay Nineties style, com
plete with colorful posters. An old
fashioned bar with Bowery bartend
ers will be on hand to dole out re
freshments to the dancersâ€”at extra
cost.
The dance sponsors will turn
judges in the middle of the evening
as the dancers fde past them to dis
play their costumes. A prize will be
awarded the couple with costumes
most fitting to the theme and also
one to the most novel costume.
JUDGING TOUGH JOB
Last year the job of judging the
costumes was a tough one, for Stan
ford goes all the way when it's dress
ing for the cvneing. Who could for
get the girl in the lace corset cover
who knocked the sponsors cold last
year?
Chairman of the Gay Nineties
Dance this year is Hays Bush, and
he and his committee have been
working hard to make the affair a
success. It's up to the student body
to do the rest.
