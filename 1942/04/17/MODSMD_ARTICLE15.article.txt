(Editor's Note: This is (he first of a series of articles describing how
Stanford women may aid the war effort at school, home, and upon
graduation.)

By MARTHAGRACE POWELL

"No more knittin' for Britain, hut what now?" has been the query of
more than one Stanford woman since the Red Cross called in all wool yarn.
The general attitude seems to he to lock around half-heartedly, find
nothing bin to do. and let the whole thine slide. It doesn't take a micro-

scope to find that there is a definite
need for concentrated war effort by
every Stanford woman.
Miss Pat Davidson, head of the
campus Y.W.C.A., has found a sub
stitute for knitting. It is twisting
strips of old wool and silk stockings
into material to be woven for
stretcher pads.
TAKING RADIO COURSE
Several women on campus have
found time a couple of nights a week
to go into Paly and acquire a tech
nique with dots and dashes, the
Morse Code. When the men leave
radio work, they will feel capable
of taking over.
On the campus, women arc al
ready swamping the available
courses in first aid. Red Cross staff
assistant, and home nursing. With
a little pressure brought by those
women interested, it is hoped that
summer quarter the courses in Mo
tor Corps Training and Canteen
Work now given in Palo Alto may
also be given here.

The real need of women in the
war effort, however, seems to be of
a subtler sort. On the campus it is
to be found in the form of Consumer
Education Forums, Salvage Com
mittee, Clean Your Plate Campaigns,
Stamp Week, and the U.S.O.
SAVING, NOT WASTE
The basis of economy in the
United States in the past has been
waste, which created quick turn
over. The war has brought a turn
about to saving.
A few minutes a day will spare
waste paper to pack foods, airplane
and tank parts, shells and ammuni
tion. "Use your wastcbasket intel
ligently," has been suggested by Bob
Collins, War Activities Co-ordinator.
Consumer Education Forums will
present methods of saving foods, and
clothes. The money saved from cut
ting out the excess can then be used
to buy War Stamps in the new
Thursday Scries.

"No more knittin' for Britain, hut what now?" has been the query of
more than one Stanford woman since the Red Cross called in all wool yarn.
The general attitude seems to he to lock around half-heartedly, find
nothing bin to do. and let the whole thine slide. It doesn't take a micro-

scope to find that there is a definite
need for concentrated war effort by
every Stanford woman.
Miss Pat Davidson, head of the
campus Y.W.C.A., has found a sub
stitute for knitting. It is twisting
strips of old wool and silk stockings
into material to be woven for
stretcher pads.
TAKING RADIO COURSE
Several women on campus have
found time a couple of nights a week
to go into Paly and acquire a tech
nique with dots and dashes, the
Morse Code. When the men leave
radio work, they will feel capable
of taking over.
On the campus, women arc al
ready swamping the available
courses in first aid. Red Cross staff
assistant, and home nursing. With
a little pressure brought by those
women interested, it is hoped that
summer quarter the courses in Mo
tor Corps Training and Canteen
Work now given in Palo Alto may
also be given here.

The real need of women in the
war effort, however, seems to be of
a subtler sort. On the campus it is
to be found in the form of Consumer
Education Forums, Salvage Com
mittee, Clean Your Plate Campaigns,
Stamp Week, and the U.S.O.
SAVING, NOT WASTE
The basis of economy in the
United States in the past has been
waste, which created quick turn
over. The war has brought a turn
about to saving.
A few minutes a day will spare
waste paper to pack foods, airplane
and tank parts, shells and ammuni
tion. "Use your wastcbasket intel
ligently," has been suggested by Bob
Collins, War Activities Co-ordinator.
