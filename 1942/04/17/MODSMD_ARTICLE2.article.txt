### 
KUIBYSHEV, April 16 (UP). â€”
Elite guardsmen of the Red Army
have repulsed 30 powerful German
counter-attacks on the central front
and are advancing over melting
snowfields strewn with thousands of
corpses toward a river guarding a
vital enemy stronghold, Russian
military sources reported tonight.
The sanguinary fighting on a broad
front, in which the commands of two
German generals were crushed de
spite a frantic bringing up of rein
forcements, was described as "the
first major battle this spring," sug
gesting that Adolf Hitler finally had
given the go-ahead for his long
awaited spring offensive.
