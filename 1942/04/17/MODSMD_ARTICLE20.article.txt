# Roughs Ride As in Old Times
## 
### 
Dust oil' your grandmother's bustle
and take ofT your shoes. It's Back to
lite Farm Day at Stanford when
every Rough is a hero and every
Smoothie gets dunked in the foun
| tain.
The Convalescent Home Drive
I reaches its climax today when Stan
ford reverts to the days of its found
ers and celebrates the glamorous Gay
Nineties with bicycles and bloomers
and handle-bar mustaches.
CARS TABOO
Students will hike to their eight
o'clocks or pedal tandem bicycles
around Quad but cars are strictly
taboo, according to Jim Mcßrier,
Back to the Farm co-chairman. "Our
grandfathers got around pretty well
in a horse and buggy so junk those
convertibles for today," he added.
Back to the Farm is tradition at
Stanford and it's the spirit of the
student body that has made it that.
Everybody wears a costume and
"them that doesn't are asking for
trouble," Mcßrier warned. It will
be remembered a certain Sid Hen
derson took a brief swim in the Libe
fountain last year.
COSTUMES ON QUAD
Costumes of every type will be
seen on Quad and in the classrooms
today. Gibson Girls on tandem bi
cycles, farmerettes in gingham pina
fores, Beau Brummels in derbies and
celluloid collars, and of course Stan
ford Roughs in jeans will reign for
the day.
Back to the Farm is as popular
with Stanford's more scholarly ele
ment as with the students. Last
year many professors decked them
selves in Gay Nineties costumes and
raised their blood pressures bicyc
ling to classes. One well-known lec
turer was even seen riding fur
tively down Palm Drive on the back
of a wheezy nag.
All plans and activities for Back
to the Farm Day are under the di
rection of Sis Larkin and Jim Mc-
Brier.
