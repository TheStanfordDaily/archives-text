# Jap Radio Denies Bombing of Tokyo
## 
### 
SAN FfiANCISCO, April 16 (UP).
â€”The Japanese radio tonight denied
Tokyo has been bombed by three
American planes.
The broadacst, heard by the CBS
shortwave listening station here,
said: "A Reuters (British) dispatch
that three American planes bombed
Tokyo was again the center of a joke
among Japanese nationals today.
Just to turn the eyes of the public
the Chungking government, through
Retuers, has been desperately
spreading the most laughable false
propaganda that the Japanese capital
was bombed."
(As far as the United Press was
able to determine, Reuters has never
claimed the bombing of Tokyo.)
