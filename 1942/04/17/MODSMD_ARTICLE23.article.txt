### 
WASHINGTON. April Hi (UP).—
The Japanese, apparently striving
now to ( \pIo:( the riches of the Phil
ippines, todaj invaded tlie important
sugar-producing island of Panay.
The War Department revealed in
a late communique that Jap troops
from » ij>ht transports landed on the
central Philippine island early this
morning under the protective fire of
warships and aircraft.
Defending forces were "in contact"
wii!t the invaders but no details of
tin- fi 'hting were available imme
diately.
NGJJTII OF CEBIT
Panay lies north of the island of
Col.ii which was invaded last Friday
by 12,030 Jap troops who are facing
"fierce" resistance from the greatly
outnrmbered defenders. It is one of
the richest islands in the archipelago
and is separated from Cebu by an
other important sugar-producing is
lafJ Nogros.
Meanwhile, the Navy announced
the loss of the 840-ton minesweeper
Finch a few days ago in the non
: top bombing of Corregidor fortress.
L« leaguered Corregidor itself un
lcashed another devastating attack
on Nipponese troop concentrations
and truck columns on fallen Bataan
P« ninsula.
COPREGIDOR GUNS STRIKE
Its big guns also pounded enemy
batteries on Cavite and Bataan, "re
sulting in a noticeable decrease in
enemy artillery fire during the past
30 hours." Corregidor's sharp-shoot
ing anti-aircraft gunners hit and
probably shot down another Jap
bomber during a series of air raids
today.
In the southernmost island of Min
danao, American - Filipino patrol
units inflicted "substantial losses" on
the enemy during actions near Mon
caya, Zamboanga and Digos.
