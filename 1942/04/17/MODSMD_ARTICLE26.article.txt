# Changes Planned In Row Traffic
## 
### 
By the end of summer quarter,
driving up the Row may no longer
seem like a tour of the Old Ridge
Route.
Plans are under consideration for
changes in the routing of Lasuen
Street traffic, according to the office
of the financial vice-president. Cor
poration yard engineers have been
notified that the project calls "or
turning Lane W into a two-lane
street to handle some of the traffic
that at present is jammed into the
Row proper.
It ha<? not yet been determined
whether one-way traffic will be in
stituted, but it is known that both
Lasuen Street and Lane W will be
graded and paved and Lane W
widened.
