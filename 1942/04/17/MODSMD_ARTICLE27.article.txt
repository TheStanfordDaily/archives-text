# Stanford's Pioneer Co-op Celebrates First Birthday
## 
### DAVE COLBURN 
Stanford's pioneer co-operative living group, the Waiter Thompson
Co-operative House, is now one year old. It was at the beginning of hist
spring quarter that 14 industrious fellows moved into 536 Alvarado Street
with borrowed furniture, intent on living economically, yet comfortably.
Their economy was worked out through worksbifts. Each person was

assigned one hour's work a week
keeping up the house and three a
week on hashing and dishwashing.
By using a few minutes a day in
workshifts, the boys are able to dis
pense with all hired help but the
cook.
Living comfortably and eating
enough to gain weight, the men still
live at rates much lower than the
campus average. The room rent
amounts to $25 a quarter per per
son, and board, consisting of lunch
and dinner seven days a week, has
been kept down to $fiO a quarter.
Each quarter has resulted in a sur
plus which has been used as a re
serve for improvements or returned
in the form of rebates.
ORIGINATED LAST YEAR
The idea of co-operative living at
Stanford was originated last year by
Russ Curtis, '42, and well supported
by the late Walter Thompson of the
political science department. Mac
Wynne and Dick McCann, assistants
in the department, later helped turn
vision into reality.
Support from 20 professors, in the
form of $10 guarantees, was secured
by the pioneers and the present
house was leased.
Co-operative eating began in the
fall as a separate organization. The
number of eaters has been kept at
about 20, including several Stanford
ites who room elsewhere.
SOCIAL ACTIVITIES
Socially, the co-op has been far
more than a mere rooming house. It
has had its share of bull sessions and
movies, and is starting spring quar
ter with a canoe renovated by the
members. Every quarter the house
has rolled up the rugs for an in

formal dance.
Scholastic standards, however,
have not been affected. The co-op
has one of the highest grade averages
of the living groups.
The co-op plans to run at full ca
pacity this summer and applications
are now being taken for both sum
mer and autumn quarters. Those in
terested may see either President
Paul Mussen or Manager Willard
Mitchell.
"The Walter Thompson Co-op
House has shown that the self-sup
porting student can live and eat
more cheaply by the co-operative
method," according to Manager
Mitchell. "As long as there are stu
dents who help themselves," he
concluded, "the co-operative idea
will have a place on the StanfoM
campus."

week on hashing and dishwashing.
By using a few minutes a day in
workshifts, the boys are able to dis
pense with all hired help but the
cook.
Living comfortably and eating
enough to gain weight, the men still
live at rates much lower than the
campus average. The room rent
amounts to $25 a quarter per per
son, and board, consisting of lunch
and dinner seven days a week, has
been kept down to $fiO a quarter.
Each quarter has resulted in a sur
plus which has been used as a re
serve for improvements or returned
in the form of rebates.
ORIGINATED LAST YEAR
The idea of co-operative living at
Stanford was originated last year by
Russ Curtis, '42, and well supported
by the late Walter Thompson of the
political science department. Mac
Wynne and Dick McCann, assistants
in the department, later helped turn
vision into reality.
Support from 20 professors, in the
form of $10 guarantees, was secured
by the pioneers and the present
house was leased.
Co-operative eating began in the
fall as a separate organization. The
number of eaters has been kept at
about 20, including several Stanford
ites who room elsewhere.
SOCIAL ACTIVITIES
Socially, the co-op has been far
more than a mere rooming house. It
has had its share of bull sessions and
movies, and is starting spring quar
ter with a canoe renovated by the
members. Every quarter the house
has rolled up the rugs for an in

formal dance.
Scholastic standards, however,
have not been affected. The co-op
has one of the highest grade averages
of the living groups.
The co-op plans to run at full ca
pacity this summer and applications
are now being taken for both sum
mer and autumn quarters. Those in
terested may see either President
Paul Mussen or Manager Willard
Mitchell.
"The Walter Thompson Co-op
House has shown that the self-sup
porting student can live and eat
more cheaply by the co-operative
method," according to Manager
Mitchell. "As long as there are stu
dents who help themselves," he
concluded, "the co-operative idea
will have a place on the StanfoM
campus."
Stanford's pioneer co-operative living group, the Waiter Thompson
Co-operative House, is now one year old. It was at the beginning of hist
spring quarter that 14 industrious fellows moved into 536 Alvarado Street
with borrowed furniture, intent on living economically, yet comfortably.
Their economy was worked out through worksbifts. Each person was

assigned one hour's work a week
keeping up the house and three a
week on hashing and dishwashing.
