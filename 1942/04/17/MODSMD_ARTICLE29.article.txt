# Self-Evaluating Test Devised For Patriotism
## Stanford Committee Tries to Determine All-Out War Effort 
### 
A committee of Stanford profes
sors has devised a self-evaluating
test of civilian patriotism with which
civilians can determine just how
much they are doing to help win the
war. The test was devised at the j
request of the Palo Alto Civilian
Defense Council.
With a perfect all-out effort rated
as lUO, businessmen of Palo Alto
made an average score of G9, a |
women's organization rated a 75, a
group of workmen gave themselves
a score of 72, and 650 high school
students made a score of 70.
The Stanford committee which de
vised the test included Dr. Lewis !
M. Terman, who developed the J
Stanford-Binet intelligence tests; j
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, head of the I
division of journalism and expe- \
rienced in the polling of public opin- 1
ion; and Dr. Ralph IT. Lutz, chair
man of the directors of the Hoover j
Library on War, Revolution, and
Peace.
Because of the variation in civilian
uctivity it is impossible to describe
a 100 per cent, all-out effort, the I
Stanford professors contend, but an j
example of someone who approaches
such a record might be one who |
spends at least five per cent of his I
income on defense bonds and stamps,
wastes no food, uses his car for only
necessary trips, and never drives
more than 40 miles an hour.
He is an air raid warden, writes I
regularly to a boy in the armed j
forces "somewhere in the Pacific," j
and yesterday reminded a fellow in
the elevator to say no more about
that rumor. To keep fit so that he
can work more efficiently, he now
takes short hikes. When he hears
about work stoppages, he digs into
his own work a little bit harder.
Last month he contributed to the
U. 5.0., and this month the Red Cross
is on his list.

Because of the variation in civilian
uctivity it is impossible to describe
a 100 per cent, all-out effort, the I
Stanford professors contend, but an j
example of someone who approaches
such a record might be one who |
spends at least five per cent of his I
income on defense bonds and stamps,
wastes no food, uses his car for only
necessary trips, and never drives
more than 40 miles an hour.
He is an air raid warden, writes I
regularly to a boy in the armed j
forces "somewhere in the Pacific," j
and yesterday reminded a fellow in
the elevator to say no more about
that rumor. To keep fit so that he
can work more efficiently, he now
takes short hikes. When he hears
about work stoppages, he digs into
his own work a little bit harder.
Last month he contributed to the
U. 5.0., and this month the Red Cross
is on his list.
A committee of Stanford profes
sors has devised a self-evaluating
test of civilian patriotism with which
civilians can determine just how
much they are doing to help win the
war. The test was devised at the j
request of the Palo Alto Civilian
Defense Council.
With a perfect all-out effort rated
as lUO, businessmen of Palo Alto
made an average score of G9, a |
women's organization rated a 75, a
group of workmen gave themselves
a score of 72, and 650 high school
students made a score of 70.
The Stanford committee which de
vised the test included Dr. Lewis !
M. Terman, who developed the J
Stanford-Binet intelligence tests; j
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, head of the I
division of journalism and expe- \
rienced in the polling of public opin- 1
ion; and Dr. Ralph IT. Lutz, chair
man of the directors of the Hoover j
Library on War, Revolution, and
Peace.
