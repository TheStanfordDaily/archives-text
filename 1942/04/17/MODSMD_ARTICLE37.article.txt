# Fraternity Problems Cited At National Conference Meet

(This is a continuation of yesterday's letter from Jim Kevder, debater
on tour, written from New York where he attended the National Inter
fraternity Conference.—The Editor)

The special report of the War Committee advised students to wntch
the financial problem facing most of the houses, and here are some of the

suggestions that were made. Keep i
chapter membership as high as pos
sible by all-year rushing; use co
operative and quantity methods of
buying; keep careful records and
charts of rising food prices and ex
penditures; use "no meat" days, "no
butter" days, and "no dessert" days;
check up on the stewards and their
economy in the kitchen; cut out too
many parties.
The committee further stressed
the fact that chapter morale and
national morale are extremely im
portant, and in this respect they ad
vocated doing away with Hell Week
activities. "Citizens of college com
munities, mindful that men are dy
ing on land and sea, are in no mood
to gaze indulgently upon the silly
pranks of college freshmen or soph
omores in the name of some Greek
letter society."
These men claimed that an essen
tial part of the morale factor of
fraternity members at war should
be service to the nation and to the
community in an active sense, such
as aiding the Red Cross in every
respect, learning first aid, serving as
airplane spotters, patrolling as air
raid wardens, acting as auxiliary
police and firemen, and buying de
fense stamps and bonds purchased
from new savings.

"The yesteryear of excessive
bridge-playing and soft-chair calis
thenics has passed. The slogan is
now 'Off your own beam and on
Victory's beam!' Three dots on the
past and a dash for real achieve
ment."—Jim Kesslcr
