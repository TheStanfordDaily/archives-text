# Sharp Reports Halls Damaged; Students Fined
## Firehoses, Blackout Equipment Must Be Replaced, Says Dean 
### 
Damage to blackout and disaster
equipment, including use of irre
placeable fire hoses, in Encina, Bran
ncr and Sequoia halls was reported
yesterday by Stan Sharp, assistant
dean of men and director of men's
dormitories.
Encina damage, amounting to $50
and charged to Encina Club, resulted
from Encinamen winding a fire hose
through fourth-floor banisters and
then turning on the water, and from
the breaking of blackout partitions
around Encina Commons doors,
Sharp stated.
"Buckets filled with sand for use
in fighting incendiary bombs in the
event of bombing in Branner and
Sequoia halls were found overturned
and misshapen," Sharp said.
MALICIOUS' DAMAGE
He termed damage to the fire hoses
and sand buckets as "malicious,"
but explained the plywood parti
tions in Encina Commons arcades
were "probably too flimsy" to with
stand the jostling of a large number
of students passing them.
Sharp explained the Encina ban
isters and Branner and Sequoia sand
buckets must be replaced, and that
it takes two days to hang and dry
fire hoses, after use, in the Firehouse
tower.
"While the hoses are being dried,"
Sharp continued, "we have no pro
tection from fire in that corridor, and
if they are not dried immediately
they will rot. We can no longer get
hoses to replace them."
USED AGAINST REQUEST
Sharp stated that the hoses had
been used by students after they had
been asked not to use them except
in the event of a fire. He added that
Encina sponsors have recommended
$100 be charged against Encina Club
each time damage occurs in the
future.
Sharp concluded with an appeal
to men who broke the arcade black
out partitions, requesting them to
voluntarily tell him they were re
sponsible. He assures these men they
will be rcspected for their honesty,
that repair costs will not be charged
them ,and that their records will re
main clear, while to report
connection with the damage will re
sult in a record of dishonest v.
