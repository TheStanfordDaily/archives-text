# War to Reduce Undergraduate College Work
## 
### Student Opinion Surveys 
Educators who for years have
been advocating a shorter college
course for undergraduate work are
seeing their idea put into effect as
a war measure to speed up the train
ing of youth. Colleges and univer
sities everywhere are adopting an
all-out schedule that will allow stu
dents to graduate in three years or
less. The University of Chicago is
offering a degree in two years.
American collegians, at least a 56
per cent majority of them, believe
the speed-up will benefit students
themselves. But at this time they
are opposed to such a program as a
post-war, long-term objective; more
than two-thirds declare that after
the war is over they would rather
go to school a full four years for
their degrees.
The questions asked and the an
swers received follow:
"Some colleges are shortening
the time to get a degree from four
to three years. Do you think this
will he beneficial or not to students
themselves?"
Will he beneficial 5(Â»%
Will not he beneficial 40%
Will not affect either way.... 2%
No opinion 2%
"Even after the war is over,
what do YOU think you would
prefer: to graduate in three years
by going to school all year round
and taking only short vacations
between terms, or go to college
four years like we have been do
ing?"
Prefer three-year course 22%
Prefer four-year course 77%
Undecided 1%
"I have to work in the summers
to be able to go to college," a soph
omore at Western Illinois State
Teachers College told interviewer
Adelaide Henrikson. More than half
of the male students, more than a
third of the co-eds, earn at least a
portion of their college cost, the Sur
veys have found. Thirteen per cent
of the men and nearly 5 per cent of
the women earn all their expenses.
This necessity of holding down a job
while attending college, a good
many students comment, leaves them
little extra time to concentrate on
additional courses in order to grad
uate in less than four years.
