# Campus to Buy War Stamps Next Thursday
## Farm Will Observe First 'Stamp Day'; To Be Held Weekly 
### 
War Stamp sales on the campus
will begin next Thursday when
Stanford will observe its first
"Stamp Day" of the war.
Every Thursday will be "Stamp
Day" on which students are asked
to contribute one 10-cent War
Stamp to the Stamp Scholarship
Fund. This fund will be used to
establish scholarships so that Stan
ford men called to the service will
have an opportunity to finish their
college educations after the war.
The 10-cent contributions may be
either in money or a war stamp, and
they will be collected at dinner
every Thursday night.
GET STAMP BOOKS
Students are also requested to be
gin saving stamps in a personal
stamp book by buying a 25-cent
War Stamp on "Stamp Day." Stamp
books will be issued with the first
25-cent stamp attached.
Campus booths, under the direc
tion of Mary Leonard, will be set up
at the English Corner, Engineering
Corner, and near the Union Cellar
for the public sale of stamps.
