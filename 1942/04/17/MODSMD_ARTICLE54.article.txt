# Frosh and Varsity Mermen Tangle with Cal Tomorrow
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
With the freshman meet taking the spotlight, Stanford's varsity and
freshman swimming teams tangle with the California Bears in a pair of
conference meets tomorrow afternoon at 11:15 in the Encina Pools.
Although the two varsities will battle it out for second place in the
conference, the freshman outfits, considered tops on the Coast, will launch
a terrific attack on meet records. *

Four, and possibly six, meet stand
ards will go.
Main attraction is expected to be
the freshman 50-yard free style
where Jim Gamble of Stanford faces
Stan Morketter, Bear ace. The meet
record of 24.8, not bettered since
1927, should fall by a full second.
RECORD BREAKERS
Gamble broke the school record
with a 24.2 effort early in the sea
son, then 23.6 tying the national
frosh record, and finally 23.2 a few
weeks ago. Morketter, whoae best
had been 24.2, churned the distance
in 23.6 Wednesday in leading his
team to victory over Berkeley High
School. Gamble also faces Morket
ter in the 100-yard free style, where
another record is expected.
Dick Narver matches strokes with
Don Beanston, Bear ace, in the 220,

aiming at another record, and Hank
Saltonstall of Stanford meets Roland
Shutt in the breast stroke. Captain
Alan Weeden of Stanford is slated
to break his own brother's back
stroke mark.
While most varsity records are se
cure, the meet should produce not
only some real individual battles but
a close team meet. Again, Coach
Ernie Brandsten's mermen, giving
away points in the diving, breast
stroke, and back stroke, must pick
up enough free style markers to win.
