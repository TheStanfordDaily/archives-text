acy among negroes in 1930 in the
United Slates was 1G.3.
U.C.L.A.'s Bruin track team ar
rives from Westwood today pre
ceding their meet with the Stanford
trackmen tomorrow on Angell Field
at 1:45, weather permitting.
Not only will this be the first con
ference meet for Pitch Johnson's

men, but it will be their one chance
for victory.
The Bruins, who dropped their
first P.C.C. meet to California in Los
Angeles two weeks ago, will arrive
as an even money chance against the
Farm team.
The meet, which will be run off in
conjunction with the Papoose-High
School All-Star meet, will be run
on a slow track in any event, and if
weather conditions don't chgnge rad
ically today and tomorrow morning,
the meet will be postponed.
Johnson's team will he stronger
than it has been at any meet so fai
th is spring. Newest addition to ihe
team is Hank Norberg, grid star, in
the discus and shotfl John Silva, top
sprinter who has been out for two
weeks, will also be back in uniform.
Although Don Reiss will run both
hurdles as usual, he has been abed
with the measles for several days
and will not be in top shape. How
ever, Ed Hertel will be more than
adequate to handle the timber
events.
Hubert Duke, dusky Uclan sprinter
and low hurdler, may push Hertel
to a new meet record in the 220
lows. HertePs times against Fresno
last week, 14.5 and 23.7, are the
best registered by a Farm student in
five years.
Another duel which might end in
a now record is the bi'oad jump
where Indian Captain Ripper Kern
faces Bruin Captain Jack Schilling.
Schilling has leaped over 24 feet, but
a leg injury might hold him back
tomorrow.
The average percentage of illiter
acy among negroes in 1930 in the
United Slates was 1G.3.
