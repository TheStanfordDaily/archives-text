# Twiggs' 'Cinch' Golf Varsity Play Bears Tomorrow At 9
## 
### DON SELBY 
Almost a load-pipe cinch to do a
repeat performance of last Satur
day's showing, Eddie Twiggs' Stan
; ford golf team takes on California's
Golden Bears on the Berkeley
course tomorrow morning at 9.
The frosh team will also meet the
Cal yearlings on the same course at
the same time.
Even with a switching of their
| line-up the Bears couldn't even come
close to Bud Brownell & Co. last
Saturday on the Stanford course. All
of which doesn't make the Bears any

worse than Ucla and Troy, whose
outfits garnered only two and six
points, respectively, against the
Cards.
SUBS SCORE HIGH
With the match all sewed up at
17-2 after the morning round, Coach
Twiggs gave the lower half of the
team a chance to get some experi
ence. The boys not only got experi
ence but seven out of nine points to
boot.
Although it is not definite how
many of the players will get to
make the trip with the team—there
will be at least the top six —the
chances are that enough Indians
will get there in one way or an
other to allow Twiggs to substi
tute almost another new team
for the afternoon round of doubles.
That is, providing the regulars
have the match cinched by the end

<:f the singles matches.
The fact that the Cards are walk
ing all over the competition on the
Coast doesn't mean that collegiate
golf out here is in the doldrums.
For Stanford, hot after the N.C.A.A.
title which it has held in three out
of the last four years, is rated as one
of the top college teams in the
country.
BROWNELL GOES EAST
Brownell, N.C.A.A. finalist last
year, will go back to the national
intercollegiates at South Bend this
summer with a reputation of being
not only a sweet golfer but a mar
velous sportsman as well. Follow
ers of college golf won't soon forget
how Brownell refused to accept a
penalty stroke on Earl Stewart,
L.S.U. ace, when Stewart's caddy
accidentally moved the ball.
The only other real long-termer
on the outfit is Sandy Tatum, who
plays either the second or third spot.
Although he didn't qualify for match
play at Columbus last summer, Ta
llinn has turned in a lot of good golf
and seems to be playing better than
ever this spring. Tatum is the only
senior on the squad as far as golf
eligibility is concerned; for, al
though he probably won't be here to
use it, Brownell still has a season
of competition left after this year.
FEW UPPERCLASSMEN
Dave Doud, a junior, is the only
other upperclassman among the top
six men on the Indian team. He
showed up at the national intercol
legiates on his own last year. This
season finds him pounding the ball
long and straight, and he has chalked
up plenty of points for Stanford thus
far.
S< phomores George Traphagcn.
Frank McCann, and either Sopho
more Jack Wilson or Senior Pete
Jones make up the remainder of
Stanford's starting team. Publi
cized as the backbone of one of
Stanford's strongest freshman golf
teams in history last year, the
sophomores have come through
with flying colors.

of the top college teams in the
country.
BROWNELL GOES EAST
Brownell, N.C.A.A. finalist last
year, will go back to the national
intercollegiates at South Bend this
summer with a reputation of being
not only a sweet golfer but a mar
velous sportsman as well. Follow
ers of college golf won't soon forget
how Brownell refused to accept a
penalty stroke on Earl Stewart,
L.S.U. ace, when Stewart's caddy
accidentally moved the ball.
The only other real long-termer
on the outfit is Sandy Tatum, who
plays either the second or third spot.
Although he didn't qualify for match
play at Columbus last summer, Ta
llinn has turned in a lot of good golf
and seems to be playing better than
ever this spring. Tatum is the only
senior on the squad as far as golf
eligibility is concerned; for, al
though he probably won't be here to
use it, Brownell still has a season
of competition left after this year.
FEW UPPERCLASSMEN
Dave Doud, a junior, is the only
other upperclassman among the top
six men on the Indian team. He
showed up at the national intercol
legiates on his own last year. This
season finds him pounding the ball
long and straight, and he has chalked
up plenty of points for Stanford thus
far.
S< phomores George Traphagcn.
Frank McCann, and either Sopho
more Jack Wilson or Senior Pete
Jones make up the remainder of
Stanford's starting team. Publi
cized as the backbone of one of
Stanford's strongest freshman golf
teams in history last year, the
sophomores have come through
with flying colors.
Almost a load-pipe cinch to do a
repeat performance of last Satur
day's showing, Eddie Twiggs' Stan
; ford golf team takes on California's
Golden Bears on the Berkeley
course tomorrow morning at 9.
The frosh team will also meet the
Cal yearlings on the same course at
the same time.
Even with a switching of their
| line-up the Bears couldn't even come
close to Bud Brownell & Co. last
Saturday on the Stanford course. All
of which doesn't make the Bears any

worse than Ucla and Troy, whose
outfits garnered only two and six
points, respectively, against the
Cards.
SUBS SCORE HIGH
With the match all sewed up at
17-2 after the morning round, Coach
Twiggs gave the lower half of the
team a chance to get some experi
ence. The boys not only got experi
ence but seven out of nine points to
boot.
Although it is not definite how
many of the players will get to
make the trip with the team—there
will be at least the top six —the
chances are that enough Indians
will get there in one way or an
other to allow Twiggs to substi
tute almost another new team
for the afternoon round of doubles.
That is, providing the regulars
have the match cinched by the end

<:f the singles matches.
The fact that the Cards are walk
ing all over the competition on the
Coast doesn't mean that collegiate
golf out here is in the doldrums.
For Stanford, hot after the N.C.A.A.
title which it has held in three out
of the last four years, is rated as one
of the top college teams in the
country.
