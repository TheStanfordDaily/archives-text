# Wilson Pitches Against Bear Nine Tomorrow
## 
### 
Big "Wild" Bill Wilson is going j
back to Edwards Field tomorrow I
with revenge in his eyes, and he is
taking along eight pals who think j
that they'll get that revenge in a j
victory over the California slugging j
baseball team starting at 2:15.
Wilson in his first start two weeks
ago as a pitcher since his days as a
star prep hurler two years ago gave
up six straight walks before he was
taken from the game in the first |
inning. But last week he pitched ;
creditable ball against a good Santa \
Clara team. Although he did give up j
11 hits, three of them came after the
fifth inning, indicating that he can
go the route, and that he does not
tire, but gets better as the game
goes along. He has the fastest slants
of any of the Indian hurlers, and his
wide breaking curves had the |
Bronco sluggers swing aimlessly last i
week.

Wilson in his first start two weeks
ago as a pitcher since his days as a
star prep hurler two years ago gave
up six straight walks before he was
taken from the game in the first |
inning. But last week he pitched ;
creditable ball against a good Santa \

11 hits, three of them came after the
fifth inning, indicating that he can
go the route, and that he does not
tire, but gets better as the game

of any of the Indian hurlers, and his
wide breaking curves had the |
Bronco sluggers swing aimlessly last i
