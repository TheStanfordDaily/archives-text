# Cal Plaster Bear Found Near Creek
## 
### 
The plaster bear given to The
Daily California by Sculptor B. Bu
fano showed up in a glass case in
the anthropology department after
having disappeared two months ago.
A card labeled "Specimen of the
Week" and stating that it had been
found near Strawberry Creek lay
beside the bear in the glass case.
U.C. anthropologists didn't know
how the bear got into their depart
ment and the staff of The Daily Cal
was equally mystified.
