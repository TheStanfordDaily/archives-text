# Frosh Postpone Cal Net Matches
## 
### 
Yesterday the weather forced the
third straight frosh tennis match to
be called off, but the Cal match, as
the most important of the season,
was postponed to Saturday instead
of being cancelled as were the San
Jose State and Menlo J.C. matches.
With the delay comes the possi
bility of some shake-ups in Coach
Johnnie Lamb's line-up. The
sprained ankle of Bob Forbes, last
quarter's number three man, has
been improving rapidly, and there is
a bare chance that he may see action
Saturday. The team of Paul Green
berg and John Brudie, who were
unable to play in a ladder match
last week, may be able to wrest the
number three doubles call away from
Wally Smith and Jerry Fine.
Otherwise the regular singles
line-up of Myers, Rutledge, Thomas,
Craig, Smith, and Murray, scheduled
to play yesterday, will take the same
positions Saturday.
