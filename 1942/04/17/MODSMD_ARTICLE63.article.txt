# Don't Wait—Do It Now!

IF American armies decided to "put off" fight
ing for a week; if our naval forces determined
to halt the hunt for enemy submarines until next
month—how long would America remain free?
If the producers of armaments "just forgot"
to turn out guns and tanks and planes; if Ameri
can generals "didn't have time" to map our
campaigns—how long would America remain
an independent democracy?
This is a war of minutes; procrastination has
become synonymous with perfidy. And yet . . .
While we can't think of one person who hasn't
commented favorably on United States Defense
Savings Bonds and Stamps, and who hasn't said,
"I'm going to start buying Defense Stamps with
out fail!"—we can think of several people who
have "delayed their purchasing," who "won't
start buying for a few days," or who had "just
forgotten" to buy a Stamp.
We want to make plain our assurance that it
is vitally important for students to invest their
dimes and guarters in the United States as
wholeheartedly, as regularly, and as systemati
cally as their parents invest their pay-day
dollars.
Wholeheartedly, regularly, and systemati
cally . . . just as our war is more than one iso
lated infantry attack; just as it reguires much
more than one concerted naval drive; and just
as it necessitates infinitely more than a single
bombing flight—everything we do must be
continuous, unfaltering, and constant.
There is more to this war than victory; Amer
ica is fighting not only for today, but for to
morrow ... for future peace and for the future
good of all peoples. The Bonds and Stamps we
buy are not only fighting the war, but fighting
for the peace.
Students of American colleges are thinking
about this world to come; many of them are
fighting for it. We who remain here are talking
about it, reading about it, planning for it. We
must also help pay for it, just as all Americans
must help.
The dimes and guarters we set aside are im
portant to the war effort, yes; but only if they
are put aside regularly and systematically, only
if they reflect both the urgency of paying for
this war, and the continuous, dynamic philoso
phy behind it.
Make a pledge to yourself. Remembering
that our search in the seas and the sky is con
tinuous, that the flow of machines and munitions
is never-ending, pledge yourself to fall in line
with America.
Start buying Defense Stamps today. Start
buying them regularly. And do not waver from
your course.
Regrettably, yesterday's letter from Debater
Jim Kessler was cut to fit space, and details of
the National Interfraternity Conference in
New York were omitted. The remainder of
the letter, containing advice to fraternity men
on how to cut expenses and how to aid the
campus war effort, is printed this morning
