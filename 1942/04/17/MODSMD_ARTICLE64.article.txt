THANKS are due Dramatic Council and Ram's
Head for making net profits of the Spring
Show available to the Convalescent Home this
year. Also, they explain it will be impossible to
give an extra performance for soldiers of Page
Mill Road because orchestra and lighting ex
penses would be prohibitive. The possibility of
asking the soldiers to attend dress rehearsal has
not yet been ruled out, however.
It's an old trick in Encina, and not a little
fun, to wind the fire hose through the ban
isters, turn on the water, and run. It's so much
fun to watch the banisters splinter and spin
down the hall, because it's so nice and de
structive.
