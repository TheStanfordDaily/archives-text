### AMIE REICHERT 
r pilE world is waiting for Hitler's spring offensive,
which by all indications is now only a matter of
days. The Nazis are all set, apparently. The weather
in Russia has improved considerably, and it looks as
though the time has come.
In the light of this knowledge, the recent develop
ments in France become more understandable. Hitler,
no doubt fearful of an Allied stab in the back, thought
it best to bring things to a showdown now and insure
his western front. Accordingly, he has taken both
political and military measures. He has set up a
strongly pro-Axis government under Laval, the son
of a butcher, and has installed one of his ablest gen
erals, von Rundstedt, in command of the armed forces
in France, and another brilliant, general, List (con
queror of the Balkans) is at present in Norway.
The traitor Marcel Deat, who swam in with the
wave of the future to take a prominent place in the
new Laval government, has ordered that the French
air force will take over the defense tasks heretofore
handled by units of the Luftwaffe in France. This
will release many planes for duty in the cast.

IIITLER is about to march to the East and he ex
pects trouble from the West undoubtedly. All his
preparations indicate that he fears Ihc opening of a
second front the minute his back is turned.
It would be no surprise if he were right. In fact,
it would be a pleasure.
The direction which Hitler's spring campaign will
take is open to question on one score t at least, and
that is whether he will attempt to drive simultaneously
at the Middle East and at Russia, or just at Russia, or
just at the Middle East.
The Russians are certain that he is getting ready to
go at them and they have been keyed for several
days now for a blow at any minute. It seems logical
enough to suppose that whether Hitler intends to go
into the Middle East now or a month from now, he
will have to pour it on the Russians a little more
anyway.

hphe big drive this spring is of course for oil. Oil in
terms of Hitler's atlas means Baku in the Russian
Caucasus, and Iran and Iraq in the Middle East.
Hitler still chcrishes plans for a common front with
his Japanese allies and if he exjjects to join with them
he will have to go through the Middle East eventually.
He will have General Rommel and his Afrika Korps
to aid him in that maneuver, and the strategy would
probably be for Rommel to sweep across Libya for an
attack on Suez while another German army goes on
through Turkey.
But so long as there is a Red Army alive and fight
ing to defend Baku the Nazis will have to fight on
that front, too.
Hitler is probably strong enough to fight on both
these fronts, but the possibility of an Allied front in
the West must be giving him no end of uneasiness
these days.
If he were to go ahead and launch both these
drives, and the new front opened in the West with
sufficient vigor and strength it might well be the be
ginning of his end. If he concentrates only on the one
campaign in Russia, he is still taking a chance, unless
the strength of the Allies in the West has been under
estimated.
In short, Herr Hitler, while he is undoubtedly strong
and well-prepared for his long-awaited spring fling,
may be in for a rough time of it if things work out
the way the columnists plan them.

hphe big drive this spring is of course for oil. Oil in
terms of Hitler's atlas means Baku in the Russian
Caucasus, and Iran and Iraq in the Middle East.
Hitler still chcrishes plans for a common front with
his Japanese allies and if he exjjects to join with them
he will have to go through the Middle East eventually.
He will have General Rommel and his Afrika Korps
to aid him in that maneuver, and the strategy would
probably be for Rommel to sweep across Libya for an
attack on Suez while another German army goes on
through Turkey.
But so long as there is a Red Army alive and fight
ing to defend Baku the Nazis will have to fight on
that front, too.
Hitler is probably strong enough to fight on both
these fronts, but the possibility of an Allied front in
the West must be giving him no end of uneasiness
these days.
If he were to go ahead and launch both these
drives, and the new front opened in the West with
sufficient vigor and strength it might well be the be
ginning of his end. If he concentrates only on the one
campaign in Russia, he is still taking a chance, unless
the strength of the Allies in the West has been under
estimated.
In short, Herr Hitler, while he is undoubtedly strong
and well-prepared for his long-awaited spring fling,
may be in for a rough time of it if things work out
the way the columnists plan them.
r pilE world is waiting for Hitler's spring offensive,
which by all indications is now only a matter of
days. The Nazis are all set, apparently. The weather
in Russia has improved considerably, and it looks as
though the time has come.
In the light of this knowledge, the recent develop
ments in France become more understandable. Hitler,
no doubt fearful of an Allied stab in the back, thought
it best to bring things to a showdown now and insure
his western front. Accordingly, he has taken both
political and military measures. He has set up a
strongly pro-Axis government under Laval, the son
of a butcher, and has installed one of his ablest gen
erals, von Rundstedt, in command of the armed forces
in France, and another brilliant, general, List (con
queror of the Balkans) is at present in Norway.
The traitor Marcel Deat, who swam in with the
wave of the future to take a prominent place in the
new Laval government, has ordered that the French
air force will take over the defense tasks heretofore
handled by units of the Luftwaffe in France. This
will release many planes for duty in the cast.

IIITLER is about to march to the East and he ex
pects trouble from the West undoubtedly. All his
preparations indicate that he fears Ihc opening of a
second front the minute his back is turned.
It would be no surprise if he were right. In fact,
it would be a pleasure.
The direction which Hitler's spring campaign will
take is open to question on one score t at least, and
that is whether he will attempt to drive simultaneously
at the Middle East and at Russia, or just at Russia, or
just at the Middle East.
The Russians are certain that he is getting ready to
go at them and they have been keyed for several
days now for a blow at any minute. It seems logical
enough to suppose that whether Hitler intends to go
into the Middle East now or a month from now, he
will have to pour it on the Russians a little more
anyway.
