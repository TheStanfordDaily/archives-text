<) NE of the least emphasized aspects of Spring Elec
tion is the Assembly preceding poll day. To my
way of thinking this should be a very important
occasion.
Unless one is an active campus figure it is un
likely that one will know a very large percentage of
the candidates. On more than one occasion a person,
desirous of voting for his or her friend, fills in the
remaining names on the ballot with no idea of whom
he is choosing but merely to validate his vote for
the one candidate.
Students have always been urged to attend these
assemblies. To make them more attractive the policy
has been to cut them short and very much to the point.
The presidential and vice-presidential candidates speak
briefly; the remaining candidates are introduced.
This year the faculty requested that only half an
hour be granted from class time. In view of the fact
that the assemblies take but 20 minutes if conducted
properly, this is a fair request.
The Committee on Public Exercises then asked the
students to sugeest a time when this half hour should
be granted. For some reason that I can't figure out
they asked for 11:35 to 12.
To my way of thinking the only less suitable time
would be 8 to 8:30. It is too late to do anything
about the time now. The faculty committee granted
the time requested and it must now stay.
It is too much to expect to get a good crowd out to
an assembly so close to the noon hour. It will merely
be a delightful opportunity to be able to leisurely go
home to lunch instead of rushing.
The students who requested this peculiar time should
now beat their brows and devise some way to get a
goodly number of students to the assembly.
My only suggestion is that all living groups be re
quested to postpone their lunches until 12:30. This
will at least permit the hashers to get to the assembly.
It may let the students feel that they won't have to
make a choice between assembly or lunch, but get to
both.
The student body would do well to attend the as
sembly; the students who arranged the time would do
well to make it a little more convenient.

hour be granted from class time. In view of the fact
that the assemblies take but 20 minutes if conducted
properly, this is a fair request.
The Committee on Public Exercises then asked the
students to sugeest a time when this half hour should
be granted. For some reason that I can't figure out
they asked for 11:35 to 12.
To my way of thinking the only less suitable time
would be 8 to 8:30. It is too late to do anything
about the time now. The faculty committee granted
the time requested and it must now stay.
It is too much to expect to get a good crowd out to
an assembly so close to the noon hour. It will merely
be a delightful opportunity to be able to leisurely go
home to lunch instead of rushing.
The students who requested this peculiar time should
now beat their brows and devise some way to get a
goodly number of students to the assembly.
My only suggestion is that all living groups be re
quested to postpone their lunches until 12:30. This
will at least permit the hashers to get to the assembly.
It may let the students feel that they won't have to
make a choice between assembly or lunch, but get to
both.
The student body would do well to attend the as
sembly; the students who arranged the time would do
well to make it a little more convenient.
<) NE of the least emphasized aspects of Spring Elec
tion is the Assembly preceding poll day. To my
way of thinking this should be a very important
occasion.
Unless one is an active campus figure it is un
likely that one will know a very large percentage of
the candidates. On more than one occasion a person,
desirous of voting for his or her friend, fills in the
remaining names on the ballot with no idea of whom
he is choosing but merely to validate his vote for
the one candidate.
Students have always been urged to attend these
assemblies. To make them more attractive the policy
has been to cut them short and very much to the point.
The presidential and vice-presidential candidates speak
briefly; the remaining candidates are introduced.
