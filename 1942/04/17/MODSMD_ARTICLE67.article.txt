### SYLVIA APOLOGIZES 
r |MIE EDITOR, SIR:
I would like to apologize to anyone else in the
Excom room last Tuesday that got the same impres
sion Mike did. Any seeming reluctance on my part to
explain the stamp program was due to this fact:
I remembered that when I whs on Excom, some
one was always explaining plans and details of plans,
and all of Excom used to wish they'd state their
business, eo ahead and do something, and then report
to us. Therefore I hesitated to talk on 'til I knew
they really wanted to hear.
I feel that the Stanford Stamp Program is the most
important effort at Stanford today. When you realize
that at U.S.F., a school of 800 students, they lx>ught
$10,000 worth of stamps in two months, you can see
what can be done here at Stanford.
Therefore. I hope sincerely that my being connected
with the program will not hinder its success. Frankly,
I don't think it will. I will be gone in two months;
Stanford Stamp Day will go on and on until the
war ends.
Sylvia Berrv
