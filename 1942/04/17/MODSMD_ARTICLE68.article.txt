on the campus of the University of
Washington in Seattle this morning.
The competition has been under
way since Wednesday morning, with
Captain Roger Boas, Jim Frolik,
Shorty Grannis, Jim Kessler, and Joe
Morin representing the Farm. To
day's debates, except for two brief
appearances at Portland this week
end, will end a 7,000-mile cross

and Grannis.
The duo arrived in Seattle Tues
day from the University of Minne

arguments in the Midwest. Previous
to that, they had appeared in New

telling the impressions these speak

the national college scene have been
appearing in The Stanford Daily for
several weeks.
