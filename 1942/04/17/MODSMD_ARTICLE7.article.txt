# HALLS RULE OUT SLATE
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
With Row politics in a confusion
of rumor and on-thc-surfacc iner
tia, representatives of men's halls
and eating clubs met last night in an
oilicial meeting of Intcrclub Council
and decided not to select a hall
slate for next Wednesday's elec
tions.
The council did, however, discuss
qualifications and eligibility of pos
sible hall candidates, and A1 Haas, El
Campo, was unanimously consid
ered the probable nominee for stu
dent body president.
After the meeting a spokesman for
the council said, "It surprised me
how well the fellows took to the idea
of not having a caucus, all of which
is in line with the spirit of the new
three-day election system. We de
cided to serve as a clearing-house
for possible candidates, but we voted
on no one, named no slate, and de
cided to let the fellows run for the
offices they want to."
HALL CANDIDATES
Indications, however, point to Hall
men running for the following of
fices:
Student body president, Al Ilaas;
senior class president, Johnny
Mitchell, Breakers, or Ray Ham
mett. El Toro and at present jun
ior man on Excom; junior class
president, Doug Hastings, El Toro;
senior man or membcr-at-large on
Excom, Hank Norberg, Breaker;
graduate man on Excom, John
Roscndalc, independent; Men's
Council, "Boomer" Eisenlauer, El
Campo.
Sophomore class offices were not
discussed, according to the Intcr
club Council spokesman, because
the freshmen may hold a caucus.
Possible candidates, however, for
sophomore president and man on
Excom are Bob Sears and Carlos
Brown, both El Toro, and Stu Wil
liams, El Campo.
'45 CAUCUS UNDECIDED
Bill Spragins, freshman class
president, said last night he did not
know whether or not a class caucus
will be held.

Candidates for the women's offices
were not discussed by Interclub. Re
cently women representatives from
Union and Lagunita withdrew from
the Council. In the past, however,
women representatives had no vote,
nor did their halls actively support
the Hall slates.
Up the Row, campaign managers
and candidates seemingly did noth
ing yesterday but jockey for posi
tion and no one was listed as pos
sible candidates other than for stu
dent body president.
Spokesmen for Shelley Parker,
Delt, Ed Slamni, Zctc, and Norm
Ross, Fiji, have officially an
nounced their hats are in the ring.
While the Fijis were undecided
early last night whether to run
Don Dillon, present junior class
president, or Norm Ross for presi
dent, they called The Daily late
last night naming Ross as their
choice.
FIJIS MOVE
Whether or not this decision re
sulted from a telephone poll of cer
tain fraternities conducted by the
Fijis is a matter of conjecture.
Indications last night point to a
move by a certain group of houses
to back Ross. Spokesman for this
gx - oup hinted, "It's the candidate
with the most houses that gets the
nomination; the one with the second
most must step down or be squeezed
out entirely."
This was the first suggestion of a
"deal" or a Row caucus. A meeting
of this group of houses, scheduled
for last night, was postponed.
Other possibilities mentioned for
top offices arc Harry Morgan, Phi
Psi, Ralph Bjorklund, Phi Delt, and
Bob Crary, Alpha Delt.
In the vice-presidential rate,
Chris Moody, Lagunita, has ap
parently the support of Ilall wom
en, with Beryl Rohison seeking a
Women's Council post.
Row candidates for vice-presi
dent appear to he Leslie Lang
nccker, Alpha Phi, Isahell Fawcett,
Dec Gee, and Barbara Sadler, Tri
Delt.

cided to serve as a clearing-house
for possible candidates, but we voted
on no one, named no slate, and de

HALL CANDIDATES
Indications, however, point to Hall
men running for the following of
fices:
Student body president, Al Ilaas;
senior class president, Johnny
Mitchell, Breakers, or Ray Ham
mett. El Toro and at present jun
ior man on Excom; junior class
president, Doug Hastings, El Toro;
senior man or membcr-at-large on
Excom, Hank Norberg, Breaker;
graduate man on Excom, John
Roscndalc, independent; Men's
Council, "Boomer" Eisenlauer, El

Sophomore class offices were not
discussed, according to the Intcr
club Council spokesman, because
the freshmen may hold a caucus.
Possible candidates, however, for
sophomore president and man on
Excom are Bob Sears and Carlos
Brown, both El Toro, and Stu Wil

'45 CAUCUS UNDECIDED
Bill Spragins, freshman class
president, said last night he did not
know whether or not a class caucus
will be held.

Candidates for the women's offices
were not discussed by Interclub. Re

Union and Lagunita withdrew from
the Council. In the past, however,
women representatives had no vote,
nor did their halls actively support
the Hall slates.
Up the Row, campaign managers

Spokesmen for Shelley Parker,
Delt, Ed Slamni, Zctc, and Norm

While the Fijis were undecided
early last night whether to run
Don Dillon, present junior class

FIJIS MOVE
Whether or not this decision re
sulted from a telephone poll of cer

Indications last night point to a
move by a certain group of houses
to back Ross. Spokesman for this

with the most houses that gets the
nomination; the one with the second
most must step down or be squeezed
out entirely."
This was the first suggestion of a
"deal" or a Row caucus. A meeting
of this group of houses, scheduled
for last night, was postponed.
Other possibilities mentioned for
top offices arc Harry Morgan, Phi

Bob Crary, Alpha Delt.
In the vice-presidential rate,

graduate man on Excom, John
Roscndalc, independent; Men's
Council, "Boomer" Eisenlauer, El
Campo.
Sophomore class offices were not
discussed, according to the Intcr
club Council spokesman, because
the freshmen may hold a caucus.
Possible candidates, however, for
sophomore president and man on
Excom are Bob Sears and Carlos
Brown, both El Toro, and Stu Wil
liams, El Campo.
'45 CAUCUS UNDECIDED
Bill Spragins, freshman class
president, said last night he did not
know whether or not a class caucus
will be held.

Candidates for the women's offices
were not discussed by Interclub. Re
cently women representatives from
Union and Lagunita withdrew from
the Council. In the past, however,
women representatives had no vote,
nor did their halls actively support
the Hall slates.
Up the Row, campaign managers
and candidates seemingly did noth
ing yesterday but jockey for posi
tion and no one was listed as pos
sible candidates other than for stu
dent body president.
Spokesmen for Shelley Parker,
Delt, Ed Slamni, Zctc, and Norm
Ross, Fiji, have officially an
nounced their hats are in the ring.
While the Fijis were undecided
early last night whether to run
Don Dillon, present junior class
president, or Norm Ross for presi
dent, they called The Daily late
last night naming Ross as their
choice.
FIJIS MOVE
Whether or not this decision re
sulted from a telephone poll of cer
tain fraternities conducted by the
Fijis is a matter of conjecture.
Indications last night point to a
move by a certain group of houses
to back Ross. Spokesman for this
gx - oup hinted, "It's the candidate
with the most houses that gets the
nomination; the one with the second
most must step down or be squeezed
out entirely."
This was the first suggestion of a
"deal" or a Row caucus. A meeting
of this group of houses, scheduled
for last night, was postponed.
Other possibilities mentioned for
top offices arc Harry Morgan, Phi
Psi, Ralph Bjorklund, Phi Delt, and
Bob Crary, Alpha Delt.
In the vice-presidential rate,
Chris Moody, Lagunita, has ap
parently the support of Ilall wom
en, with Beryl Rohison seeking a
Women's Council post.
Row candidates for vice-presi
dent appear to he Leslie Lang
nccker, Alpha Phi, Isahell Fawcett,
Dec Gee, and Barbara Sadler, Tri
Delt.
With Row politics in a confusion
of rumor and on-thc-surfacc iner
tia, representatives of men's halls
and eating clubs met last night in an
oilicial meeting of Intcrclub Council
and decided not to select a hall
slate for next Wednesday's elec
tions.
The council did, however, discuss
qualifications and eligibility of pos
sible hall candidates, and A1 Haas, El
Campo, was unanimously consid
ered the probable nominee for stu
dent body president.
After the meeting a spokesman for
the council said, "It surprised me
how well the fellows took to the idea
of not having a caucus, all of which
is in line with the spirit of the new
three-day election system. We de
cided to serve as a clearing-house
for possible candidates, but we voted
on no one, named no slate, and de
cided to let the fellows run for the
offices they want to."
HALL CANDIDATES
Indications, however, point to Hall
men running for the following of
fices:
Student body president, Al Ilaas;
senior class president, Johnny
Mitchell, Breakers, or Ray Ham
mett. El Toro and at present jun
ior man on Excom; junior class
president, Doug Hastings, El Toro;
senior man or membcr-at-large on
Excom, Hank Norberg, Breaker;
graduate man on Excom, John
Roscndalc, independent; Men's
