## 
### 
VICIIY, April 16 (UP). —Pierre Laval, the Franco-German collabora
tionist, mapped out a new government today, with himself as Premier,
while police guarded him from a huge crowd in the streets and a fresh
wave of terrorism, including a German troop train derailment that killed
44 persons, swept through Occupied Franee.
His mind apparently made up 011 the composition of his new cabinet,

Laval arrived from Gcrman-occu
pied Paris shortly after noon, was
escorted, under heavy guard, into
conferences with Chief of State Mar
shal Philippe Petain and Vice-Ad
miral Jean Darlan, and it was an
nounced tonight that the Council
of Ministers—the ruling governmen
tal body—will meet for the last time
tomorrow prior to the formation of
a new regime.
The fact that tomorow's council
meeting was referred to as "the
last" indicated that Petain and Dar
lan had acquiesced to Laval's plans
and that the new cabinet list had
been agreed upon.
It was believed that Laval will
assume the ministries of foreign af
fairs, interior and propaganda and
thai there will be more new faces
than old ones in his cabinet, which
probably will includc some younger
men who have been soldiers re
cently. Either Petain or Laval prob
ably will announce the cabinet list
in a radio speech tomorrow or Sat
urday, it was reported.
