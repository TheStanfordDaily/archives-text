# Row Outlaws Slates, Vote-Trading, Caucus
## House Meeting Spurs Drive Toward 'Clean-up' 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Acting in the spirit of the new three-day election
system devised to "clean up" campus politics, repre
sentatives of 20 fraternities, meeting in an unoflicial
session Friday night at the Phi Kap house, voted
against holding a Row caucus, supporting a slate, or

trading votes for Wednesday's stu
dent body election.
After a heated discussion, repre
sentatives voted unanimously not
to hold a caucus and recommended
that no caucus be held next year by
either Row or Hall.
Jim Haugh, Interfraternity Council
president, said, "As far as I'm con
cerned this caucus stulY is a bunch
of political garbage and I think we
ought to cut it out. The caucus is a
drag on fraternities and a blot on
Stanford."
As a result of the decision not to
run a Row slate, spokesmen for
Shelley Parker, Dclt; Norm Ross,
Fiji; and Ed Stamm, Zcte, announced
that each would run for student body
president.
Only other week-end surprise is
that Doris Dolan is replacing her
sister Dee-Gee, Isabel 1 Fawcctt, as
candidate for student body vice
president.
