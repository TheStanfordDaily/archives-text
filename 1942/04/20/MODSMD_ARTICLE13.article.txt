# JACOBYS' HAZARDOUS ESCAPE TOLD
## 'Knew You'd Make It, Mel,' Says General 
### BILL STEIF 
Greeted by General Mac Arthur's
"I knew you'd make it. Mcl," Mel
ville and Annalec Jacohy arc now
safe in Australia. But the story of
their trip from Ilataan to Australia
j still remains one of the most thrill
| ing of the present war, as the March
of Time recognized when it devoted
a full half-hour to the couple last
Friday night.
Oldtimers at the Daily shack still
remember Mcl and Annalec, Stan
ford '36 and '37 respectively. Mcl
had been a night editor and Anna
lee, whose last name was Whitmore
then, had been women's editor on
The Daily.
WRITES HARDY SCRIPTS
Annalec, after graduating from
Stanford, took a Hollywood job writ
ing "Andy Hardy" scripts, while Mcl
took his master's degree at Stanford
in 1938 and then hooked on with
| Time as a Far Eastern correspondent.
Assigned to Time's Chungking bu
reau, Mcl got his first taste of war,
| and there once again ran into Anna
lee, who had thrown up her Holly
wood job to write for the China Re
lief Fund.
Last fall, "six-foot, 25-year-old
i Jacoby," according to a letter re
ceived by The Daily from Edgar W.
Brown of the March of Time, "trans

ferred to Manila to become Time's
Far Eastern chief." Two weeks be
fore Pearl Harbor Mel took a half
day off and married blonde Annalee,
to whom he had proposed in a rick
sha in Chungking.
"Faced with internment when the
Japs seized Manila," states Brown,
"the Jacobys escaped to Bataan on a
small island freighter . . . and lived
there with the fighting Americans

and t llipinos, sharing their hard
ships and triumphs." Jacoby, fur
thermore. had to double as both re
porter and photographer, because
Life's photographer, Carl Mydans,
had been captured in Manila.
Near the end of March, after Gen
eral Mac Arthur had been ordered to
Australia, the Jacobys also decided
to pull out.
