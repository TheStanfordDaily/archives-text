# MacArthur Greets Couple in Australia
## 
### 
bright moonlight night, their boat
slithered through minefields, past the
Cavite shoreline, away from Forts
Drum and Hughes at which Jap ar
tillery intermittently blazed. Jacoby,
in his dispatch to Time, said that
they "sat on deck with a tight feel
ing in our stomachs," and that when
one of the crew wrung a chicken's
neck," the agonized squawk made
I us jump, our stomachs rejoining us
some time after."
A .Jap reconnaissance plane twice
spotted the Jacobys' little ship, but
the expected bombers did not fol
low. Several times their boats had
to dodge in and out of small islands
to escape Nipponese destroyers
which had picked up their trail.
ENCOUNTER .lAPS
Once the Jacobys found them
selves running parallel to a flotilla of
eight Jap warships, but the battle
! wagons, apparently damaged and
heading for a home port, paid no
attention to them.
And as the Jacobys finally pulled
into a friendly port, the chief engi
; neer turned off the ship's motorâ€”
and a piston cracked. Their boat
I wouldn t have been able to move
j another inch.
This was the tale that the March
lof Time dramatized Friday night.
It seems like a pretty good yarn.
