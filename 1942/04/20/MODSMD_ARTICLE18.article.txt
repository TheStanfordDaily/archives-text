# More Tokyo Alarms Reported by Berlin
## Allies Still Silent About Raid's Origin 
### United Press 
Reports of possible new air raids
on Japan Sunday were circulated
by Axis and neutral radio stations
and a Japanese newspaper was
quoted as saying that 140 Tokyo
school children were killed in Sat
urday's attack by "bombs dropped
by United Slates bombers."
With Washington officials still si
lent on reports that U.S. planes have
carried the war to the Japanese
mainland, the Berlin radio said Tokyo
had two air raid alarms on Sunday,
one before dawn that was described
as a test, and another at 1 p.m. which
was extended to various districts of
central Japan, including the big
naval base at Yokosuka, on the west
side of Tokyo Bay 12 miles south of
Yokohama.
ALARMS IN FIVE AREAS
The Swiss radio was heard in
London broadcasting that air raid
warnings sounded in five areas of
Japan Sunday, including Tokyo and
the eastern port of Yokosuka and
that "one report said American
planes were recognized among the
craft flying over the areas." The
Swiss radio attributed its informa
tion to the Tokyo newspaper Asahi.
It did not say whether the planes
dropped bombs.
The same newspaper was quoted
by the Berlin radio as reporting that
the 140 children killed Saturday
were just leaving their school build
ing when the bombs began to fall.
"Innumerable parcels with cloth
ing and other gifts for victims of the
first enmy air raid on Japan are now
being received here (in Tokyo) from
all parts of Japan," the Berlin radio
said.

"Everybody in Japan is . . . anx

do his best to demonstrate to the

and firm resolution to win the war

"Reconstruction of destroyed
houses is making rapid progress,
thanks to the help of numerous vol
unteer workers, and it is expected
that the outer structure of some
houses which are to replace houses
destroyed by fire will be completed
by Monday. The Ministry of Fi

fered from the bombardment and to
do his best to demonstrate to the
enemy Japan's national solidarity
and firm resolution to win the war
irrespective of sacrifices."
"Reconstruction of destroyed
houses is making rapid progress,
thanks to the help of numerous vol
unteer workers, and it is expected
that the outer structure of some
houses which are to replace houses
destroyed by fire will be completed
by Monday. The Ministry of Fi
nance once more advised the Japa
nese people to take out war risk in
surance policies in order to protect
themselves against losses in the
event of further raids."
Reports of possible new air raids
on Japan Sunday were circulated

quoted as saying that 140 Tokyo
school children were killed in Sat
urday's attack by "bombs dropped
by United Slates bombers."
With Washington officials still si
lent on reports that U.S. planes have
carried the war to the Japanese
mainland, the Berlin radio said Tokyo

was extended to various districts of
central Japan, including the big
naval base at Yokosuka, on the west
side of Tokyo Bay 12 miles south of
Yokohama.
ALARMS IN FIVE AREAS
The Swiss radio was heard in
London broadcasting that air raid
warnings sounded in five areas of
Japan Sunday, including Tokyo and
the eastern port of Yokosuka and
that "one report said American
planes were recognized among the
craft flying over the areas." The
Swiss radio attributed its informa
tion to the Tokyo newspaper Asahi.
It did not say whether the planes
dropped bombs.
