# Conference Shows Farm Ratio High
## Stanford Delegates Report on Student Government Changes 
### 
"Our ratio hasn't dropped as much
as the ratio at other universities,"
Irma Jean Hannibal, president of
Women's Conference, said when she
returned from the Western Confer
ence of Intercollegiate Association of
Women Students held in Salt Lake
City last week.
I'.it Adams, vice-president of the
student body; Lucy Terrell, Women's
Conference delegate, and Miss Han
nibal were Stanford's representa
tives to the Conference composed of
more than 90 delegates from 11 west
< t n states.
More than 1,000 University of Utah
men have joined the services or gone
to work in defense industries, and
other universities have lost equally
as many men, according to the re
ports of the other delegates, Miss
Hannibal said.
< OVERNMENT O.K.
Pat Adams stated when inter
viewed, "The contact with girls from
other universities reassured us that
Stanford's student government is far
more effective and more advanced
than the student government of any
u i iversity represented."
Faculty representatives on the Ex
Committees of the other universities
prevent them from having complete
student government, she continued.
SUMMER GOVERNMENT
All of the universities are reorgan
izing on a four-quarter or three
semester basis, but Stanford is the
only University that is considering
reorganization of its system of gov
ernment as well, according to Miss
Hannibal.
She also said that Stanford and
the University of California have
made the most progress in offering
courses on consumer education and
that other universities are stressing
on-campus activities, fewer big
name dances, and offering more
courses in Red Cross and current
events.
Stanford was chosen host for the
next Western Conference in 1944,
Miss Hannibal said.
