PLACE FOR BLIMPS
"In (he Navy we knew as far back
as the last war that there was a real
place in the service for lighter-than
air craft," Admiral Greenslade said.
"Their ability to hover over the
sea and to maintain steady positions
over surface ships and convoys
makes them invaluable, and with the
advent of more units and newer
types the strain on the surface and
heavier-than-air escorts will be tre
mendously reduced.
BLIMPS SUCCESSFUL
"It is significant that no convoy
which has been escorted by lighter
than-air craft has been successfully
attacked by enemy submarines."
The blimps have been operating
from the base for several weeks
through army co-operation, and in
return the last class of aviation
cadets will remain for two weeks
longer to complete their basic flight
training.
