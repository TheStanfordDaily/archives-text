# Golfers to Vie For Con Home
## 
### 
Stanford's week-long Con Home
drive winds up today with a delayed
benefit golf tournament which starts
this afternoon at 12:30. The tourna
ment, to be held on the local links,
will be run off with two ball four
somes taking selective drives.
Each entrant is requested to pay
the 50-cent green fee himself, since
the object of the tournament is to
raise as much money as possible for
the charity.
Although play begins at 12:30,
teams will tee off throughout the
afternoon since they can enter as
they do so. Golf balls will be offered
as prizes, going to the teams with
low net and low gross scores.
Emery Neale, winner of the Con
Home all-U ping-pong champion
ship, and Lou Allen will represent
the S.A.E.'s in the playoff for the
doubles crown this afternoon in the
Nitery. They will play the winners
of the Hutcheson-Day vs. Friedman-
Roberts match.
Some 280 people in old-fashioned
and rustic costumes danced to the
music of Bert Wlhiting Friday night
at the Gay Nineties Dance and added
$185 to the Convalescent Home Drive
total.
The dance closed the week's ac
tivities for the benefit of the Con
valescent Home. Chairman for the
dance was Hays Busch. Decorations
were planned by Ted Peterson and
Malcolm McKillop, while Helen Sa
vory had charge of arrangements.
San Francisco has an average of
1,135 hours of fog per year.
