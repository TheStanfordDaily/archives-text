ior who suited up only two weeks
ago, seems to be the best Card
quarter-miler. lie has done 51 flat.

velop when Captain Jack Schilling

"Ed Ilertel s chances of competing
against the Bruins are dubious, hul
we'll know definitely at meet time,"
said ( oach Pitch Johnson last niyht
on his leading hurdler's chances in
Stanford s dual track meet today
with U.C.L.A. at Angell Field start
ing at 4.
Hertel, whose 14.5 is the best on
the Coast this year, injured a groin
must le in practice Saturday.
To offset this bad news, however,
it is probable that Ed Stamm will
compete in the shot put and discus.
Stamm has tossed the 16-pound ball
well over 50 feet. Bob Smith, a jun
ior who suited up only two weeks
ago, seems to be the best Card
quarter-miler. lie has done 51 flat.
Also returnig for today's meet
after recovering from the measles is
Don Reiss, Card hurdler. Running in
the 100 and 220 for the first time in
two weeks is John Silva, number
one Stanford sprinter, who has been
011 Ihe sidelines with leg injuries.
Backing up Stamm in the weights
will be Hank Norberg.
Leading the U.C.L.A. aggregation
is Hubert Duke, sprinter and hurd
ler, who, il Hertel is unable to run,
may chalk up a victory in Ihe lows,
and, il Silva isn't in good shape after
his injuries, may take both sprints.
SCHII LING, KERN CLASII
A battle of the captains may de
velop when Captain Jack Schilling
of the Bruins and Captain Gene
Kern of the Cards meet in the broad
jump. Schilling has leaped 24 feet
but a knee injury might hold him
back.
vV i Hard Smith and Vern Hart
should have little trouble taking 8
points in the high jump, likewise
the Cards should dominate the pole
vault with Ed Tomaso and Russ
Peck. The freshman meet with the
Alameda-Contra Costa County All
Stars has been cancelled.
