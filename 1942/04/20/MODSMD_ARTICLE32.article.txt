J IKE XMAS and Shrove Tuesday,
ping-pong comes to Emery
Neale but once a year.
When it comes, however, it comes
with a bang. Emery, in each of the
three years he has been at Stanford,
has won Ihe all-university table
tennis tournament. He can't prac
tice for it since the table at his frat
club was lost several seasons back.
Mis gift for ping-pong is of little
surprise to those who have seen
him play tennis, since his court
swing much resembles a good
table swing. Emery when playing
Ilie game stands far from the table
and returns every smash his op
ponent makes with as much vigor
as it had on the previous trip
across the net.
At last year's soph carnival, one
of the living groups had a concession
the object of which was to beat their
two champions in ping-pong and win
a prize. This was virtually impos
sible to do since their boys were the
second and third best players in
school. However, somewhere along
in the evening Neale showed up and
started to win cigars and cupie dolls
right and left.
I<asl Friday Neale added the
doubles crown to his long list. He,
teamed with Lucius Allen, de
feated another varsity netter, Andy
Roberts, and the former fourth
ranked national girls' ping-pong
player, Leslie Friedman.
To my unpracticed eye the prog
ress of the play was very bizarre,
since Allen looked like the poop on
his side of the net with Emery being
ihe weak sister. A practice singles
match between the two later, quickly
dispelled this idea, however.
r PHIS being the height of track sea
son. I consider it appropriate to
mention that former Card sprinter
Johnny Grant's sister Janette is back
' n the campus for a short time. If
you will remember she was chosen
f>n the SLANTS all-time all-Ameri
ean team in April of 1042, which
wasn't so long ago.

ean team in April of 1042, which
wasn't so long ago.
J IKE XMAS and Shrove Tuesday,
ping-pong comes to Emery
Neale but once a year.
When it comes, however, it comes
with a bang. Emery, in each of the
three years he has been at Stanford,
has won Ihe all-university table
tennis tournament. He can't prac
tice for it since the table at his frat
club was lost several seasons back.
Mis gift for ping-pong is of little
surprise to those who have seen
him play tennis, since his court
swing much resembles a good
table swing. Emery when playing
Ilie game stands far from the table
and returns every smash his op
ponent makes with as much vigor
as it had on the previous trip
across the net.
At last year's soph carnival, one
of the living groups had a concession
the object of which was to beat their
two champions in ping-pong and win
a prize. This was virtually impos
sible to do since their boys were the
second and third best players in
school. However, somewhere along
in the evening Neale showed up and
started to win cigars and cupie dolls
right and left.
I<asl Friday Neale added the
doubles crown to his long list. He,
teamed with Lucius Allen, de
feated another varsity netter, Andy
Roberts, and the former fourth
ranked national girls' ping-pong
player, Leslie Friedman.
To my unpracticed eye the prog
ress of the play was very bizarre,
since Allen looked like the poop on
his side of the net with Emery being
ihe weak sister. A practice singles
match between the two later, quickly
dispelled this idea, however.
r PHIS being the height of track sea
son. I consider it appropriate to
mention that former Card sprinter
Johnny Grant's sister Janette is back
' n the campus for a short time. If
you will remember she was chosen
f>n the SLANTS all-time all-Ameri
ean team in April of 1042, which
wasn't so long ago.
