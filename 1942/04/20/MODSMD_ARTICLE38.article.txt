Unable to hold a five-run first
inning lead, Stanford's baseball team
again yielded to the hurling of Rudy
Rounavaara to drop an 18-7 deci
sion to California last Saturday at
j Edwards Field. Earlier in the morn
j ing the frosh lost to the Bear year
lings, 10-3.
Bill Wilson again started oul in
trouble after his teammates got five
runs in the opening frame on two
I hits by walking too many batters, C;tl
getting three runs on but one hit.
Harry Dyck replaced Wilson, who in
turn was replaced by Bill Harms.
The victory cinched the second
position for California in the C.1.8.A.
j pennant race, with a slim possibil
j ity that they may overhaul the lead-
I ing Trojans of U.S.C.
Ed Washburn was the leading hit-
I tor, getting two for four. Leland
Scott, Ray Hammett, Boch Caruso,
and Bill Cunha each collected one
hit apiece.
Harry Mason and Bill Brokaw
handcuffed the Cal frosh for four
hits, but walks and errors gave the
Cubs victory, although the Stanford
frosh got seven hits. This game
cinched the series for the blue and
gold freshmen, having won the first
game 7-3.
