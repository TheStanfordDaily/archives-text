# Traubel to Sing Tuesday Night
## 
### 
"For relaxation my hobby is
.sinking," said Helen Traubel, Metro
politan Opera Wagnerian soprano,
who will present the last Concert
Series program of the 1941-42 sea
son tomorrow night in Memorial
Theater.
A special favorite of Miss Traubel
in the musical world is pianist Alec
Templeton. The final thing she did
before leaving for her Metropolitan
debut was to sit down and play Tem
pleton's record satirizing Wagnerian
opera and its stars.
Prime delight of the Junoesque
soprano is food, and she has to eat
plenty of it to supply physical re
inforfcement for her magnificent
trumpet tones. Working off as much
weight during the performance of
an opera as a Stanford quarterback
in a game against Cal, Miss Traubel
has no compunctions about eating as
heartily as she does, and tucks away
an average of five husky meals a
day.
Fresh air, chocolate ice cream
sodas, baseball games, Western mov
ies, popular and clasiscal records are
the chief enthusiasms of the soprano,
but all is not play in her regime.
She is a tireless worker, practicing
regularly at long stretches each day,
six days a week. She doubles her
energy when studying for a new
role, and begins at 9 in the morning.
