# Stanford Ends an Era Of 'Political Garbage'
## 
### 
STANFORD'S Row leaders finally became so
nauseated by the annual spring election
caucus that they took matters in hand last Fri
day in a meeting at the Phi Kap house and threw
a dripping collection of assorted "political gar
bage" wher6'* it belongs.
They voted out the caucus for this year, and
resolved that it not be held next year; they rele
gated slates and dealing and vote-trading to the
"dictatorships" of last year and the year before
and as far back as you can remember. By dic
tatorships they meant the managers of student
body presidential candidates, for it was the
practice of these organizers to trade votes and
trade support with whoever else had a candi
date and wanted to get on the bandwagon. With
such a slate, all that remained was to go through
the formality and the farce that was the "white
ballot" nomination in a caucus.
* * *
It fell to the so-called "small houses" last
week, as it has in past years, to attempt to clus
ter together and swing their support to what
ever "big house" had a student body presi
dential candidate and was willing to play ball.
It was their aim to line up behind whatever
man might be chosen, write out a slate, hold a
caucus, and, in short, try the old system again
in an effort to place men in class presidency
posts or lower positions if necessary.
They felt this was the method by which they
could spot men in student body posts where
they would become known and advance up the
political ladder; it has always been their only
means of becoming articulate. In fact, it has
been the small houses in the last few years
which have been able to determine, in large
part, the Row s choice for the presidency and
other offices on down the line. By dealing back
and forth with the presidential candidate's man
ager, they have built a slate.
* * *
Then, last week, came the announcement
fiom Interclub Council they would have no cau
cus, no slate and no campaigning. Some Row
men called this Interclub "smoker" last week
just another type of caucus, because, they
pointed out, there was only a single choice
named by the Halls for each position on the
ballot. There is some feeling, however, ad
mitted by many Hall men, that the Halls lack
men powerful enough to buck Row candidates
for some of the available positions this time, and
conseguently two or three candidates could not
be named for any one position.
* * *
Row representatives voted out the caucus
with only one dissenting vote, and that vote was
not from a man who represents what is known
as a small house. The small houses voted out
the caucus, to a man, because it was their de
cision that the good men in their houses would
have a better chance of victory on an open
ballot in a more democratic election.
In the event men from big houses win the
student body presidency and the majority of
class presidencies, and then proceed to over
look the small houses in forming committees
next year, their appeal should be to public
opinion through the fair and impartial news
and editorial columns of The Daily, or they
can always call an investigation on their own.
* * *
With both Hall and Row caucuses out, all in
dications point to the same action in Encina.
Collectively, then, Stanford has agreed politi
cal candidates will run individually on their
own merits. Stanford can probably mark up
this action as one of the outstanding under
graduate achievements of the year. It is a pro
gressive step and, now that it has been taken,
it will not easily be retracted or violated by
any organization without the danger of full
exposure and investigation.
Stanford men and women have given their
word they will not trade votes, and they must
keep it.

with only one dissenting vote, and that vote was
not from a man who represents what is known
as a small house. The small houses voted out
the caucus, to a man, because it was their de
cision that the good men in their houses would
have a better chance of victory on an open
ballot in a more democratic election.
In the event men from big houses win the
student body presidency and the majority of
class presidencies, and then proceed to over
look the small houses in forming committees
next year, their appeal should be to public
opinion through the fair and impartial news
and editorial columns of The Daily, or they
can always call an investigation on their own.

With both Hall and Row caucuses out, all in
dications point to the same action in Encina.
Collectively, then, Stanford has agreed politi
cal candidates will run individually on their
own merits. Stanford can probably mark up
this action as one of the outstanding under
graduate achievements of the year. It is a pro
gressive step and, now that it has been taken,
it will not easily be retracted or violated by
any organization without the danger of full
exposure and investigation.
Stanford men and women have given their
word they will not trade votes, and they must
keep it.
STANFORD'S Row leaders finally became so
nauseated by the annual spring election
caucus that they took matters in hand last Fri
day in a meeting at the Phi Kap house and threw
a dripping collection of assorted "political gar
bage" wher6'* it belongs.
They voted out the caucus for this year, and
resolved that it not be held next year; they rele
gated slates and dealing and vote-trading to the
"dictatorships" of last year and the year before
and as far back as you can remember. By dic
tatorships they meant the managers of student
body presidential candidates, for it was the
practice of these organizers to trade votes and
trade support with whoever else had a candi
date and wanted to get on the bandwagon. With
such a slate, all that remained was to go through
the formality and the farce that was the "white
ballot" nomination in a caucus.
* * *
It fell to the so-called "small houses" last
week, as it has in past years, to attempt to clus
ter together and swing their support to what
ever "big house" had a student body presi
dential candidate and was willing to play ball.
It was their aim to line up behind whatever
man might be chosen, write out a slate, hold a
caucus, and, in short, try the old system again
in an effort to place men in class presidency
posts or lower positions if necessary.
They felt this was the method by which they
could spot men in student body posts where
they would become known and advance up the
political ladder; it has always been their only
means of becoming articulate. In fact, it has
been the small houses in the last few years
which have been able to determine, in large
part, the Row s choice for the presidency and
other offices on down the line. By dealing back
and forth with the presidential candidate's man
ager, they have built a slate.

Then, last week, came the announcement
fiom Interclub Council they would have no cau

men called this Interclub "smoker" last week
just another type of caucus, because, they
pointed out, there was only a single choice
named by the Halls for each position on the
ballot. There is some feeling, however, ad
mitted by many Hall men, that the Halls lack
men powerful enough to buck Row candidates
for some of the available positions this time, and
conseguently two or three candidates could not
be named for any one position.

in an effort to place men in class presidency
posts or lower positions if necessary.
They felt this was the method by which they
could spot men in student body posts where
they would become known and advance up the
political ladder; it has always been their only
means of becoming articulate. In fact, it has
been the small houses in the last few years
which have been able to determine, in large
part, the Row s choice for the presidency and
other offices on down the line. By dealing back
and forth with the presidential candidate's man
ager, they have built a slate.

Then, last week, came the announcement
fiom Interclub Council they would have no cau
cus, no slate and no campaigning. Some Row
men called this Interclub "smoker" last week
just another type of caucus, because, they
pointed out, there was only a single choice
named by the Halls for each position on the
ballot. There is some feeling, however, ad
mitted by many Hall men, that the Halls lack
men powerful enough to buck Row candidates
for some of the available positions this time, and
conseguently two or three candidates could not
be named for any one position.

Row representatives voted out the caucus
with only one dissenting vote, and that vote was
not from a man who represents what is known
as a small house. The small houses voted out
the caucus, to a man, because it was their de
cision that the good men in their houses would
have a better chance of victory on an open
ballot in a more democratic election.
In the event men from big houses win the
student body presidency and the majority of
class presidencies, and then proceed to over
look the small houses in forming committees
next year, their appeal should be to public
opinion through the fair and impartial news
and editorial columns of The Daily, or they
can always call an investigation on their own.

With both Hall and Row caucuses out, all in
dications point to the same action in Encina.
Collectively, then, Stanford has agreed politi
cal candidates will run individually on their
own merits. Stanford can probably mark up
this action as one of the outstanding under
graduate achievements of the year. It is a pro
gressive step and, now that it has been taken,
it will not easily be retracted or violated by
any organization without the danger of full
exposure and investigation.
Stanford men and women have given their
word they will not trade votes, and they must
keep it.
