### AMIE REICHERT 
lIAPPY birthday, dear Adolf, happy birthday to you.
Today you are 53. Don't you think you are get
ting a little too old to play with matches? Here is
some happy, happy birthday news for you, Ade.
Your enemies in the Pacific now have air supe
riority, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, over your
brothers, the little yellow Aryans.
Your enemies have bombed the papier-mache cities
of Tokyo, dropped incendiaries and demolition bombs
on the bamboo islands of Japan and the very fact
that your newspapers are so fiercely denying the pos
sibility of attacks on military objectives sounds as
though you do protest too much. You wouldn't take
a big trip like that, with the tremendous hazard in
volved, just to bomb hospitals and push-cart peddlers,
or would you?
Happy birthday, dear, dear Adolf. This is a turning
point in the Battle of the Pacific. It turns against you.
It will have its ramifications in every phase of the
Pacific war. It will drag the Japanese fleet away from
the Bay of Bengal back to defend their own waters,
and thus give the British time to strengthen the bul
warks of India and mount guards on her ramparts.

/ I ONGRATULATIONS, dear Fuehrer. The bombers
J will come again to seek out your friend Tojo in
his island empire, just as they came to Rangoon and
the Philippines to seek his soldiers there.
Felicitations, Herr Hitler. The RAF will drop sev
eral hundred thousand tons of presents for you today.
You will find these gifts in the blasted shipyards and
burning factories of northern France and western
Germany.
Perhaps within the month Allied soldiers in Eng
land and Ireland will travel across the Channel to
convey their greetings to you in person. Won't that
be fun for everyone?
Oh, happy, happy birthday to you Adolf Schikel
gruber. In bleeding France they are toasting you with
sabotage and counter-slaughter. In valiant Yugoslavia
they are paying tribute to your glory with the undy
ing resistance of 100,000 Chetniks.
The Russians bring gifts to you, Herr Hitler. They
bring you today a gigantic offensive which will soon
break the seige of Leningrad. They bring you word
of the annihilation of three of your elite "Death's Head"
divisions, and the destruction of half the 20th motor
ized division. They bring you renewed attacks on
your trapped 16th army at Staray Russa, which faces
certain death.
Happy, happy day, Adolf. America gives you greet
ing. American industry roars in your honor; Ameri
can ships and guns and tanks and planes are welded
in your honor; do you hear it? It is all for you.
Today your people pray for you, Herr Hitler. For
many years you thought you could get along without
God, you thought you did not need him. But of late,
you have become frightened, and therefore pious. Your
people will pray for you today, Adolf, because you
have dictated that they shall do so. But you cannot
dictate what they will pray for you.
