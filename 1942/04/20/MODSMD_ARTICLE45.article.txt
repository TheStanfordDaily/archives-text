### MIKE CHURCHILL 
jpRIDAY S DAILY saw the birth of a new column.
All down the middle of page three "Off the Quad"
told of events future and past that are of importance
in Stanford's extracurricular life.
I like this new column that Barbara Stevens is writ
ing. The main reason is that, among other things, the
announcement that Delta Omicron Phi's Sally Gloop
has at last ensnared El Rancho's Algernon Twizzleface
is removed from the realm of those bottom column fill
ers which every so often announce that precisely 3245
swallows checked in at Capistrano over the last week
end.
Another thing that it does is to give some fore
warning of coming social activities. This is a decided
advantage to me.
Now I can read Barbara's column the night before
it appears in print and line up the occasions for which
I should try and get dates.
I can then begin dialing furiously and get a 12-
hour head start on the guys who always seem to be
in there first when I have to get a date. You can
not realize how much this may mean to me.

MY "unhappy coincidence" department I have
added the two news stories that appeared on the
front page of Friday's Daily. The first story told how
the president of Maryland University liked Coach
Shaughnessy, among other things, because he did not
smoke.
The story went on to say that the sale of cigarettes
on the Maryland campus was banned by the president,
who declared that they were worse than liquor.
Directly beneath this occurred the announcement of
a Toyon-Branner Smoker for Monday night.

J AST quarter I heard of an investigation that was
being carried on in a very hush way by one of our
Administrators. He confided in me that somehow,
sometime the old Encina piano had been carried off
and a different one left in its place. I was sworn to
secrecy lest the culprits hear of the search and get on
their guard.
The other day I phoned this friend to ask him how
the search was developing. He swallowed a couple of
times and told me that the piano now in Encina is the
one that was there all the time.
He considers it a good joke on himself that all that
happened was, unknown to him, the old piano was given
a refinish job.

warning of coming social activities. This is a decided
advantage to me.
Now I can read Barbara's column the night before
it appears in print and line up the occasions for which
I should try and get dates.
I can then begin dialing furiously and get a 12-
hour head start on the guys who always seem to be
in there first when I have to get a date. You can
not realize how much this may mean to me.

MY "unhappy coincidence" department I have
added the two news stories that appeared on the
front page of Friday's Daily. The first story told how
the president of Maryland University liked Coach
Shaughnessy, among other things, because he did not
smoke.
The story went on to say that the sale of cigarettes
on the Maryland campus was banned by the president,
who declared that they were worse than liquor.
Directly beneath this occurred the announcement of
a Toyon-Branner Smoker for Monday night.

J AST quarter I heard of an investigation that was
being carried on in a very hush way by one of our
Administrators. He confided in me that somehow,
sometime the old Encina piano had been carried off
and a different one left in its place. I was sworn to
secrecy lest the culprits hear of the search and get on
their guard.
The other day I phoned this friend to ask him how
the search was developing. He swallowed a couple of
times and told me that the piano now in Encina is the
one that was there all the time.
He considers it a good joke on himself that all that
happened was, unknown to him, the old piano was given
a refinish job.
jpRIDAY S DAILY saw the birth of a new column.
All down the middle of page three "Off the Quad"
told of events future and past that are of importance
in Stanford's extracurricular life.
I like this new column that Barbara Stevens is writ
ing. The main reason is that, among other things, the
announcement that Delta Omicron Phi's Sally Gloop
has at last ensnared El Rancho's Algernon Twizzleface
is removed from the realm of those bottom column fill
ers which every so often announce that precisely 3245
swallows checked in at Capistrano over the last week
end.
Another thing that it does is to give some fore
warning of coming social activities. This is a decided
advantage to me.
