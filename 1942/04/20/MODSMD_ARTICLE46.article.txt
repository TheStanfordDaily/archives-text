r |"4IE EDITOR, SIR:
A joke making the rounds these clays claims there
is one thing they (the government) can't put a priority
on.
You guessed itâ€”love.
And from the looks of things the war is acting as a
tremendous boomerang to love. A fellow would have
to bo just about blind not to notice the appalling num
ber of war marriages and engagements going on around
Stanford these days. Since the Navy has found my
eyes up to 20-20 par. this extraordinary situation has
not escaped my observation.
The situation seems to break itself down (or up)
into three categories:
1. Get married now (or in June) and enjoy life
while possible.
2. Get engaged now and wait until the end of the
war to get married.
3. Forget the whole business for the duration.
Personally, I'm all for the last category. Much less
entangling. No worries about the little woman back
home beating your time. And besides some of those
women in Australia aren't bad. Saves her a lot of
worry about you. too. And those idealistic lovisms
about being true till the man gets back may wear a
little thin after three or four or five years.
Respectfully submitted in the hope of getting to the
bottom of all the pros and cons of this argument,
"What to do"
