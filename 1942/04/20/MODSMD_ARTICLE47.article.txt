# Symphony Ends Brilliant Season with Brahms' First
## 
### 
With the exultant chorale of the Brahms First, the San Francisco Sym
phony appropriately closed the most successful of all ils concert seasons.
As appropriate as the finale was the opening funeral march from the
Beethoven "Eroica," played in memory of Alfred Hertz, former conductor
of the orchestra, who died last week.

Ravel's flashing "Alborada del
Gracioso" was played with its full
fiesta spirit; and the performance of
the Weber "Euryanthe" overture
and the Brahms symphony was be
yond reproach.
Richard Strauss cut his orchestra
down to chamber size for the "Le
Bourgeois Gentilhomme" suite, but
he neglected to cut down on his out
landish antics of scoring. He used
the French horn like a trumpet and
the bass viol like a first violin.
In places, the suite was promising.
With the "Entrance of Cleonte," for
example, Strauss achieves a tonal
mist that Debussy might have en
vied. But then he reverts to an ex
cessive use of the triangle, and even
turns the horn into a percussion in
strument, when with a mute, it is
called upon to make a hideous
cracking noise to represent the bleat
ing of sheep.â€”Covey
