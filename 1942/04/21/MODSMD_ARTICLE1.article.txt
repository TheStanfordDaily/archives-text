# Enemy Siege Guns Batter Corregidor; Final Attack Hinted
## Stilwell's Forces Rescue British In First Allied Victory in Burma; MacArthur Discusses New Strategy 
### United Press 
'1 he Japanese pounded Corregidor all day yesterday with shells from
nine-inch siege guns and there were indications that the all-out attack
on the great American-held fortress, which has dominated much of Manila
Hay ever since the war in the Pacific started, may he under way.
Elsewhere on the far-flung battle fronts of the Pacific and Eastern Asia,
however, the United Nations were*. • ■

doing better.
Chungking reported that Chinese
forces commanded by Lieutenant
General Joseph W. Stilwell, Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Amer
ican chief-of-staff, had swept into
the destroyed Burma oil fields, re
captured the key town of Yenang
yaung, and liberated several thou
sand encircled British troops.
FIRST BURMA WIN
It was the first real victory of
United Nations land forces in the
Burma campaign and gave time for
tired British imperials, who have
been fighting and retreating stead
ily for weeks, to reorganize.
The supreme commander for the
Southwest Pacific, General Douglas
A. Mac Arthur, and Australian Prime
Minister John Curtin had a long
conference in Melbourne after which
it was announced that concentration
of United Nations striking power
would be practiced henceforth rather
than the old policy of dispersal—try
ing to hold all with forces too small
to hold anything. ,
PLAN OFFENSIVE
It was made clear that Allied ac
tion henceforth will be designed to
.seize the initiative from the Nippon
ese and carry the offensive to the
Philippines and other areas over
which the Japanese swarmed in their
successful southward push.
The outlook for Corregidor, to
which Lieutenant General Jonathan
Wainwright retired after the loss of
the adjacent Bataan Peninsula, was
not reassuring.
The Japanese now hold the Mari
veles mountains, within four miles
of the Corregidor rock. Plunging
fire from the Nipponese guns, it was
feared, might dent, even the power
ful underground fortifications of the
rock and its smaller adjacent island
forts. «
TOUGII TIME AHEAD
It appeared that Wainwright and
his men were in for a tough time for
there was no indication that Mac-
Arthur's northward offensive from
Australia could be organized in time
to give them effective assistance.
Public interest continued centered
on Saturday's bombing of Tokyo,
where an imperial headquarters
communique was issued stating that
only 10 American bombers took part
in the raids. There were indications
that bombs may have fallen within
Tokyo proper — close enough to
shatter the calm of Chiyoda Castle,
the main residence of Emperor Hi
rohito.
WASHINGTON SILENT
Washington, probably with the
deliberate intention of keeping the
Japanese guessing and adding to
their nervousness, maintained abso
lute silence with regard to the raids.
The Japanese still professed to be
lieve* that the raiding planes came
from three American aircraft car
riers, which launched them far off
the Nipponese coast, but most ex
perts believed they were land craft
which came from the Aleutians, off
Alaska.

rthur headquarters had no comment
