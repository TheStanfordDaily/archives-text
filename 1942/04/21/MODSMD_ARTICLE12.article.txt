# THE 						PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SAY:
## 
### 
The following statements arc writ
ten by candidates for student body
president at The Daily's request.
AL HAAS:
If in peace-time the office of stu
dent-body president is important, it
is doubly so in war-time. Stanford
has assumed a new role. And it may
well be expected that the student
body president will be confronted
with new problems whose solution
will be of significance to the entire
student body.
I believe that Stanford's prime ob
jective next year must be to con
tribute its maximum to the nation.
It must adjust itself to its drasti
cally changed environment, but it
must treat each problem calmly and
objectively, making changes only
â€¢when thoy are proved to be benefi
cial. I humbly state that I believe
myself capable and qualified to dis
charge the president's duties in the
coming year. My previous experi
ence in student government will

help me. I have given the matter a
great deal of thought and have care
fully considered the problems whk:h
may arise next year. What failings
I have I feel certain will be com
pensated for by a sincere interest in
and deep devotion for Stanford.
SIIELLEY I'ARKER:
This election comes at a crucial
time. Stanford is just beginning to
feel the impact of the war, which
has already affected Stanford more
than most of us realize. However,
the future will make fresh demands.
Much of the responsibility for the
change to a war basis will rest with
our campus government. The life
of the students will center more
around the Stanford community and
it will be the job of the officers to
organize this community so that it
will be effective in the year's work.
We must make our war effort suc
cessful, for Stanford has an out
standing reputation to be maintained.
In the past we have received many
scholastic and athletic honors, but

now we must achieve prominence in
a more important field that of help
ing our country. This should be the
major aim of the next A.S.S.U. ad-
I ministration.
NORM ROSS:
Because Stanford has expanded
the four-quarter system, there's go
; ing to have to be an extensive reor
, ganization in student government.
So this next year it's particularly
J important that we elect officers for
| every position who are really inter
| csted in student government, and
! who are capable of dealing with all
the restrictions and changes that the
war is imposing on our activities.
We've made a real advance by
I eliminating caucuses. Now if we
can forget whether a man comes
from the Row or the Halls, and elect
the best-qualified candidates all the
way down the line, we'll have the
effective student leadership we need.
ED STAMM:
I think the most important point
to be emphasized in the selection of

the presidential candidates for next
year is that tlie candidate selected
should have a practical, common
sense approach to the problems that
will confront him. Bcause of the
effects of the present war on Stan
ford it will be necessary to have
this type of representative if stu
dent activities arc to be managed
efficiently.
Concerning my personal quali
fications for the office, I would only
like to explain that I am sincerely
anxious to represent Stanford in this
capacity, and that I will have ample
time to fulfill the duties required of
this office. 1 am definitely planning
to attend summer school, and thus
with this extra quarter will only
have to take the minimum curicular
requirements to complete my course.
I wish to thank all of those of you
who have assisted in nominating me
to this esteemed office and if elected
I reassure you that I will conscien
tiously perform the duties of student
body president.
