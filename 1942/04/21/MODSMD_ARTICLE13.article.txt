# THE 						PREFERENTIAL BALLOT
## 
### 
{An Editorial)
STANFORD goes to the polls tomorrow to choose its student
body leaders for the new four-quarter war year from what is
probably the largest number of candidates in Stanford's history.
There has been much confusion over the workings of the
preferential ballot. The following explanation is designed to act
as an aid to voters who are not clear on the purpose of the prefer
ential ballot system and how it works.
1. Be sure to vote for candidates, whom you would like to
see in office, in order of preference.
2. Say there are three men, X, Y, and Z, running for an office.
X receives 500 first choice votes, Y receives 300 first choice votes,
and Z receives 250 first choice votes. X does not have a majority,
that is, more than half of the total votes for all three candidates,
so Z, low man, is automatically eliminated and the ballots which
are marked Z for first choice are added to the two remaining
candidates in the following manner: X gets 150 second choice
votes from Z's ballots, and Y gets 100 second choice votes from
Z's ballots. X's 150 additional votes are added to his 500 original
first choice votes, and he has a majority of the total original votes
and is therefore declared the winner on the second count.
3. Remember that your second choice counts as soon as your
first choice has been ruled out.
4. Take your student body card to the polls, mark the ballots
in ink, and leave no blank spaces. If the ballot says "Vote for
three," vote for all three in order of your preference.
5. If you do not want any one person to be elected, do not
vote for him as your second choice, as he may be elected on the
| second count. Vote for him last.
6. REMEMBER: YOU CANNOT BEAT THE SYSTEM BY
SOME "SCHEME." THE ONLY WAY TO ELECT YOUR MAN
IS VOTE FOR HIM FIRST AND FOR YOUR SECOND CHOICE
SECOND.

3. Remember that your second choice counts as soon as your
first choice has been ruled out.
4. Take your student body card to the polls, mark the ballots
in ink, and leave no blank spaces. If the ballot says "Vote for

5. If you do not want any one person to be elected, do not
vote for him as your second choice, as he may be elected on the

{An Editorial)
STANFORD goes to the polls tomorrow to choose its student
body leaders for the new four-quarter war year from what is
probably the largest number of candidates in Stanford's history.
There has been much confusion over the workings of the
preferential ballot. The following explanation is designed to act
as an aid to voters who are not clear on the purpose of the prefer
ential ballot system and how it works.
1. Be sure to vote for candidates, whom you would like to
see in office, in order of preference.
2. Say there are three men, X, Y, and Z, running for an office.
X receives 500 first choice votes, Y receives 300 first choice votes,
and Z receives 250 first choice votes. X does not have a majority,
that is, more than half of the total votes for all three candidates,
so Z, low man, is automatically eliminated and the ballots which
are marked Z for first choice are added to the two remaining
candidates in the following manner: X gets 150 second choice
votes from Z's ballots, and Y gets 100 second choice votes from
Z's ballots. X's 150 additional votes are added to his 500 original
first choice votes, and he has a majority of the total original votes
and is therefore declared the winner on the second count.
3. Remember that your second choice counts as soon as your
first choice has been ruled out.
4. Take your student body card to the polls, mark the ballots
in ink, and leave no blank spaces. If the ballot says "Vote for
three," vote for all three in order of your preference.
5. If you do not want any one person to be elected, do not
vote for him as your second choice, as he may be elected on the
| second count. Vote for him last.
6. REMEMBER: YOU CANNOT BEAT THE SYSTEM BY
SOME "SCHEME." THE ONLY WAY TO ELECT YOUR MAN
IS VOTE FOR HIM FIRST AND FOR YOUR SECOND CHOICE
SECOND.
