## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 20 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt will lay before
Congress and the nation probably on
Monday the outline of a sweeping
Administration policy affecting the
country's whole wartime economy,
including wages, taxes and profits.
The president's plans, subject to
possible interim developments, were
revealed by legislative leaders to
day after a White House confer
ence. In the meantime, each house
will withhold action on pending la
bor curbs.
The conferees said the President
will present his views on "the cost
of living during the war" in a spe
cial message to Congress and then lo
the nation in a fireside chat.
