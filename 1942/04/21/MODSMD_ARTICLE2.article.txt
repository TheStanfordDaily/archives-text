# Gestapo May Force French Navy to Help
## Real Collaboration Announced; Darlan To Address Fleet 
### United Press 
Pierre Laval announced France's '
transformation from a passive to an
"active" collaborator of Germany
Monday, heightening the fears that
Hitler might get the French fleet
and upset the United Nations' naval
alignments in the Atlantic and
Mediterranean.
Allied diplomats in London said
the Nazi Gestapo conceivably could
force French seamen to man their
warships against the United Nations
by threatening harm to their fami
lies, as they reportedly did to lure
French warships home after the 1940
armistice.
There already were hints of
trouble at Toulon, the Mediterranean
naval base where most of the bat
tered but partly repaired French
warships arc tied up. Heavily-armed
patrols are roaming the streets
there, the London radio reported.
WATCH DARLAN
Admiral Jean Darlan, who re
tained command of France's armed
forces in the reorganization which
installed Laval in power as chief of
the government, will issue an order
of the day to the fleet Tuesday,
Vichy reported. That event was be
ing closely watched in Allied capi
tals, as were the continued reports
of violence and unrest throughout
France.
It was announced that 30 French
hostages were shot by the Germans
at Rouen Monday in retaliation for
the wrecking of a train carrying
German soldiers on leave through
that northwest French town last
week. The train blew up while
crossing a viaduct. The hostages
were taken from a nearby concen
tration camp where so-called "com
munists and DeGaullists" are im
prisoned.
SLAUGHTER PLANNED
The Germans plan to slaughter
another 80 hostages Thursday if the
train wreckers are not found before
then.
Laval, in a radio speech to the na
| tion. said that "no threats" could de
ter him from a wholehearted col
laboration policy and he complained
against American and British at
tempts to "interfere" in French af
fairs. It was revealed that he will
i make another speech soon on his idea
of American-French policy. He
j made only one passing reference to
the United States Monday night but
bitterly denounced Britain for at
tempting to destroy the French fleet,
attacking French colonies and sup
porting Russia.
FEARS BOLSHEVISM
Adopting the same arguments
used by German propagandists in
justification of the war, Laval said
that if Germany were defeated a
tide of bolshevism would sweep all
Europe.
To disturb Hitler's birthday were
reports from the south Russian front
that Marshal Scmyon Timoshenko
was massing a great array of new
recruits and a winter's accumula
< tion of new tanks, cannon and
American-made planes for the com
ing crucial battle over the roadway
to the Caucasus.
STEPPES ALIVE'
Henry Shapiro, United Press cor
respondent who has just flown from
Tehran, Iran, to Kuibyshev across
the southern front, reported that the
thawed-out Russian steppes were
alive with people "preparing for the
offensive." including young men
flocking to the colors, and that thou
sands of guns and tanks were on
the move. He said he saw many
American-made Boston (Douglas)
bombers in the region.
