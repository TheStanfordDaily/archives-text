# Mining Professor Travels to Tacoma
## 
### 
Orson Cutler Shepard, associate
professor of mining and metallurgy,
will speak in Tacoma, Wash., to
morrow at a meeting of the Ameri
can Institute of Mining Engineering
on "Sampling and Its Reliability."
"The idea which I hope to present
is that greater reliability of sample
can be obtained at greater expense,
and in sampling we are purchasing
reliability of sample. The manager
of any sampling operation must de
ride how much reliability he is jus
tified in buying. To do this intelli
gently, a measure of reliability of
sample is required," said Mr. Shep
ard. This obtaining of a measure of
reliability that statisticians use and
applying it to mining is explained in
detail in the book, "Fire Assaying,"
by Shepard and Dietrich.
