# Indians to Meet Cal Cindermen
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman track squad
heads for Berkeley Friday to meet
I California in the "Little Big Meet"
! at Edwards Field.
The Cubs have a well-balanced
j team but lack first-place power.
I Against Sacramento J.C., California
took only two first places.
"Coat" Hanger, center on the frosh
cage team, nabbed one of those first
places with a high jump of 6-lVii. He
will have plenty of trouble with the
combined forces of Ross Dana, Jim
Kk.'sl, and Don Landale, Card jump
ers, who constantly flirt with the
I .six-foot marker.
The other California first place
j ugainst the capital city aggregation
was chalked up by Bishop in the
| discus with a heave of 131 feet 2\'.\
\ inches. Stanford's best is 115 feet.
