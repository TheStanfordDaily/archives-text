# Bruin Trackmen Beat Indians
## Stanford Suffers 71-60 Loss with Hertel Missing 
### 
By some strange quirk of fate, Stanford's varsity trackmen lost a meet
yesterday afternoon on Angel I Field. Use victor was U.C.L.A. by a 71 -GO
score.
Ed Stamm's sensational 49-foot 7 :! 'j-inch shot put was the high point
of the day for Farm rooters. Stamm, at the end of his first week's work
on the shot in a year, had a f

put after the competition that went
out 50 feet G inches. Later Stamm
came through with a 133-2'/k throw
in the discus to give him second in
that event.
Handicapped by the temporary
loss of Ed Hertel, crack hurdler, the
Card forces took six first places to
the Bruins' nine. This is the first
year in the histoiy of the Ucla-Stan
ford dual meet that the Southerners
have not lost.
DUKE HIGH POINT MAN
High point man for the winners
was Hubert Duke, squat negro
sprinter and low hurdles*. He tied
Indian John Silva in a 10-flat cen
tury, lost a close decision to the
same Indian in the 220, and came
back to edge out Don Reiss of Stan
ford in the lows.
Silva also was appearing in his
first meet of the year for the Stan
fords. His times of 10.0 and 22.5 in
•dicate that he will be a definite
threat to Bear Hal Davis in Sat
urday's Big Meet.
Captain Ripper Kern's 23-4 broad
jump, Vern Hart's 6-4 :; h high jump,
and Russ Peck's and Ed Tomaso'o
13-2 pole vaults, all of these win
ning performances yesterday after
noon, ai'e also encouraging for Pitch
Johnson's forces. Peck's surprise
22-foot 11-inch leap in the broad
jump gave him a tie for second in
that event and stamps him as a two
event threat in the future.
REISS WINS HURDLES
Reiss, in winning the high hur
dles, also scored a personal triumph ;
since it was the first flight, of hur
dles he has finished in a meet this
season. His time of 15.5 was not
bad considering the fact that he
had the measles last week. However,
he should be able to cut that down
by Saturday. Lack of condition was
the only thing that kept him from
scoring a win in the lows too, since
he was nosed out in the last 20 yards.

By some strange quirk of fate, Stanford's varsity trackmen lost a meet
yesterday afternoon on Angel I Field. Use victor was U.C.L.A. by a 71 -GO
score.
Ed Stamm's sensational 49-foot 7 :! 'j-inch shot put was the high point
of the day for Farm rooters. Stamm, at the end of his first week's work
on the shot in a year, had a f

put after the competition that went
out 50 feet G inches. Later Stamm
came through with a 133-2'/k throw
in the discus to give him second in
that event.
Handicapped by the temporary
loss of Ed Hertel, crack hurdler, the
Card forces took six first places to
the Bruins' nine. This is the first
year in the histoiy of the Ucla-Stan
ford dual meet that the Southerners
have not lost.
DUKE HIGH POINT MAN
High point man for the winners
was Hubert Duke, squat negro
sprinter and low hurdles*. He tied
Indian John Silva in a 10-flat cen
tury, lost a close decision to the
same Indian in the 220, and came
back to edge out Don Reiss of Stan
ford in the lows.
Silva also was appearing in his
first meet of the year for the Stan
fords. His times of 10.0 and 22.5 in
•dicate that he will be a definite
threat to Bear Hal Davis in Sat
urday's Big Meet.
Captain Ripper Kern's 23-4 broad
jump, Vern Hart's 6-4 :; h high jump,
and Russ Peck's and Ed Tomaso'o
13-2 pole vaults, all of these win
ning performances yesterday after
noon, ai'e also encouraging for Pitch
Johnson's forces. Peck's surprise
22-foot 11-inch leap in the broad
jump gave him a tie for second in
that event and stamps him as a two
event threat in the future.
REISS WINS HURDLES
Reiss, in winning the high hur
dles, also scored a personal triumph ;
since it was the first flight, of hur
dles he has finished in a meet this
season. His time of 15.5 was not
bad considering the fact that he
had the measles last week. However,
he should be able to cut that down
by Saturday. Lack of condition was
the only thing that kept him from
scoring a win in the lows too, since
he was nosed out in the last 20 yards.

out 50 feet G inches. Later Stamm
came through with a 133-2'/k throw
in the discus to give him second in
that event.
Handicapped by the temporary
loss of Ed Hertel, crack hurdler, the
Card forces took six first places to
the Bruins' nine. This is the first
year in the histoiy of the Ucla-Stan
ford dual meet that the Southerners
have not lost.
DUKE HIGH POINT MAN
High point man for the winners
was Hubert Duke, squat negro
sprinter and low hurdles*. He tied
Indian John Silva in a 10-flat cen
tury, lost a close decision to the
same Indian in the 220, and came
back to edge out Don Reiss of Stan
ford in the lows.
Silva also was appearing in his
first meet of the year for the Stan
fords. His times of 10.0 and 22.5 in
•dicate that he will be a definite
threat to Bear Hal Davis in Sat
urday's Big Meet.
Captain Ripper Kern's 23-4 broad
jump, Vern Hart's 6-4 :; h high jump,
and Russ Peck's and Ed Tomaso'o
13-2 pole vaults, all of these win
ning performances yesterday after
noon, ai'e also encouraging for Pitch
Johnson's forces. Peck's surprise
22-foot 11-inch leap in the broad
jump gave him a tie for second in
that event and stamps him as a two
event threat in the future.
REISS WINS HURDLES
Reiss, in winning the high hur
dles, also scored a personal triumph ;
since it was the first flight, of hur
dles he has finished in a meet this
season. His time of 15.5 was not
bad considering the fact that he
had the measles last week. However,
he should be able to cut that down
by Saturday. Lack of condition was
the only thing that kept him from
scoring a win in the lows too, since
he was nosed out in the last 20 yards.
