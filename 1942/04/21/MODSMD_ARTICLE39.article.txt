WHY look at the dark side of the athletic situation at Stanford this
spring when theie is a bsighter side to be seen? For exasnple, why
weep about the lacings our baseball teams took at the hands of the Cal
vaisity and frosh over the week-end, and why worry about the poor marks
hung up by our ts-ack team yestes-day aftesnoon when the swimming,
golf, and tennis teams have scos*ed brilliant victories in the last few days?
Coach Johnny Lamb's netmen defeated the Beas-s, their neasest com
petition in the conference and in the country, by a 9-0 scoi-e. That is what
is called a "skunking," in less polite society. The Papooses did almost
as well.
Even with "Buzzy" Munroe, crack 100 and 220 swimmer, in the hospital,
the varsity went out and ovei'came a lead to win the "Big Swim" from the
Berkeleyites, 38-37. At the same time the best frosh swim team in the
history of California went down befoi'e our first year men, 47-28.
The Fasm freshmen broke five meet records on their way to victosy.
In overwhelming the Bear golf squad, as usual, the Cai'ds, vas'sity
and frosh, scored three times as many tallies as did their opponents. Also
every man that made the trip earned his letter.
In all, Starsford men met Cal men in eight athletic contests and came
out victorious in six of them.

/ I REW at Stanford was given a big boost over the week-end when the
J Cal rowers arrived back from their triple licking by Washington at
Seattle with a scull earmarked for us as a piesent from the Huskies .
now all that is needed to make this school the Poughkeepsie of the West
is a few boys out for cs'ew.

TIM CANNING, circulation manager of a local humor mag and frat
brother of Alexander Woolcott and Sheridan Whiteside, after having
spent three years of unheralded backbreaking work backstroking for the
varsity swimmers, was given the crowning blow yesterday when he was
represented as hailing from Cal after his second in the backstroke Satur
day had helped us eke out the Bears.
