# Masland Says Coast Bombing Inevitable

### BILL STEIF 
Young, dark John YV. Masland, assistant professor of political science
at Stanford and a leading authority on far-eastern affairs, contemplated
for a minute and then said. "I definitely think that the Japanese will bomb
the west coast before the war is over."
This was in answer to The Daily's query, and, in elaborating upon this

statement, Professor Masland
ed out that he believed the air at- ,
tack would have to be carrier-based. I
"The reason for this," said Professor ]
Masland, "is that the biggest bomb
ers have a range of only about 1500
miles one way and the nearest Jap
bases are two or three times that j
distance."
BASES FQRTUNATE
"In that respect," continued Pro- j
fessor Masland, "we are fortunate, j
With bases at Pearl Harbor, Dutch
Harbor, and Midway Island as an j
outpost, we have almost a two
thousand-mile jump on Nippon."
But Professor Masland, neverthe
less, thinks that the American j
bombing of Tokyo was a carrier
based affair, pointing out that if an ;
American task force, which included I
an aircraft carrier, could success
fully raid Jap islands within 800
miles of Tokyo as was done four or
five weeks ago, it would be entirely
possible for carriers to come that
close to Japan with light bombers j
and successfully sock Tokyo, Kobe, i
Kyoto, and Yokohama.
"The Japs," continued Professor '
Masland in relation to the strength
of Jap coastal defenses, "are fully
prepared to fight, raids, I believe. I
don't think that they would weaken I
their home defense under any cir
cumstance."
Professor Masland, moreover, be
lieves that the Japs, with compara
tively short supply lines, are going
to be hard to get out of Oceania.
"But," he concluded, "I'm optimis
tic." Which—with a rational twist—
is a pretty good idea these days.
