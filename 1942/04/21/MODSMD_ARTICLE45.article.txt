PROBABLY one of the least appreciated or
ganizations on the campus—least appreci
ated in that little is known of its good work—
is the Stanford Bookstore. Each year it makes
substantial gifts to University institutions such
as the Student Aid Commission and other schol
arship groups. As far as being an organization
partly run by students for students, the Stan
ford Bookstore has done more than its share in
contributing to the welfare of the student body
as a whole.
Then there is the matter which is probably
better known, the rebate system. With a war
going on, prices and taxes increasing, and a
general feeling of cutting down on everything,
the Bookstore has more than been able to keep
its head above water. Last week the board of
directors announced a rebate of eight per cent,
the highest paid since the boom year of 1929.
All in all, 57,400 in rebates will be given out in
June as compared with $5,600 last year.
All we have to do is save those green slips
they give us every time we make a purchase,
put them in an envelope, make a notation of
the amount on the outside, and turn the en
velopes in by May 15. Before finals are over,
when money is precious, we receive several
dollars back according to the number of pur
chases made during the school year.
We should consider ourselves fortunate to be
able to share in such a high percentage return.
As we have been told and know, "Things will
be different next year." We will be paying
higher prices for supplies and getting little or
no return on our investments.
There is still another rosy side to the story
of the Bookstore. Whether we realize it or not,
we are getting the highest possible grade of
books, paper, pencils, and other supplies at
reasonable prices.
We are indeed lucky to have such a group
in our midst working for the students without
the profit motive continually in mind.—John

higher prices for supplies and getting little or
no return on our investments.
There is still another rosy side to the story
of the Bookstore. Whether we realize it or not,
we are getting the highest possible grade of
books, paper, pencils, and other supplies at
reasonable prices.
We are indeed lucky to have such a group
in our midst working for the students without
the profit motive continually in mind.—John

PROBABLY one of the least appreciated or
ganizations on the campus—least appreci
ated in that little is known of its good work—
is the Stanford Bookstore. Each year it makes
substantial gifts to University institutions such
as the Student Aid Commission and other schol
arship groups. As far as being an organization
partly run by students for students, the Stan
ford Bookstore has done more than its share in
contributing to the welfare of the student body
as a whole.
Then there is the matter which is probably
better known, the rebate system. With a war
going on, prices and taxes increasing, and a
general feeling of cutting down on everything,
the Bookstore has more than been able to keep
its head above water. Last week the board of
directors announced a rebate of eight per cent,
the highest paid since the boom year of 1929.
All in all, 57,400 in rebates will be given out in
June as compared with $5,600 last year.
All we have to do is save those green slips
they give us every time we make a purchase,
put them in an envelope, make a notation of
the amount on the outside, and turn the en
velopes in by May 15. Before finals are over,
when money is precious, we receive several
dollars back according to the number of pur
chases made during the school year.
We should consider ourselves fortunate to be
able to share in such a high percentage return.
As we have been told and know, "Things will
be different next year." We will be paying
higher prices for supplies and getting little or
no return on our investments.
There is still another rosy side to the story
of the Bookstore. Whether we realize it or not,
we are getting the highest possible grade of
books, paper, pencils, and other supplies at
reasonable prices.

in our midst working for the students without
