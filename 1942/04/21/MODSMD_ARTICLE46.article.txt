# A 						Good Example

ONCE again Stanford ranks high above the
other universities in the country in doing
its part to help our country in its war effort.
Announcement came yesterday of the fact that
the University has now brought its total pur
chases of War Bonds to $100,000.
Such a sum may seem staggering to us, but
to the total amount needed this is a very small
total—but a very necessary part of the whole.
Besides the War Bonds, Stanford has put con
siderably more than 20 per cent of its total
security investment in other government bonds.
This is a sure indication of confidence and
security in our government which is exactly
what is needed now more than ever. It is very
much easier for corporations, companies, and
universities to make huge investments such as
that demonstrated by Stanford. But what is
more necessary is the investment by each citi
zen in War Stamps and Bonds to help our coun
try win its fight.
With the money that will flow into our na
tion's coffers from private sources—from people
who will have to sacrifice and realize that every
thing is not "as usual"—we shall have a much !
easier time securing our democratic way of liv- i
ing for future generations.
Let's follow the example set before us by
our University.—John Horrall
