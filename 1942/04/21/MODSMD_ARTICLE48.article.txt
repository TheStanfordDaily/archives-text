### AMIE REICHERT 
r pHE following article, under pictures of Hearst, Me-
Cormick, and Patterson appeared yesterday as an
ad in the San Francisco Chronicle. These are brave
words and it is time someone said them.
♦ * * *
You three know that 'aid to the enemy' doesn't
always come in the shape of a muffled figure sulking
around with secret plans and code messages.
You three know that mighty handsome aid was
given the enemy by flag-draped citizens in Norway
and France and Belgium and all the to-be-conquered
others. 'Our leaders are War-Mongers' . . . 'We're
being used by the British.' . , . 'We can defend our
selves' . , . 'Why should be fight for the Poles?'
"You know, all right. The seeping, sick phrases of
dissension and distrust . . . worth their weight in air
planes to the enemy.
"Now our country is at War. For our lives, we
must beat the Japs and Nazis and help our Allies
every where to beat the Japs and Nazis.
"So suppose you heard a fellow going around nor
—today—among the workers in a munitions plant or
Navy yard saying that our government . . ,
" 'neglects the interest of our own America ... in
order to be a bigshot and a big sap for every foreign
country and every alien people in the world.'
"Would you say that man was hurting morale and
thus aiding the enemy?
"Obviously YOU wouldn't say it, Mr. Hearst, for
you wrote those words.
"On March 10, 1942, you wrote them in your pa
pers —wrote them to aviation workers and men in
Navy yards and soldiers and sailors and the other
4,000,000 Americans that read your papers every day.
"Or suppose another fellow went around jawing
about aid-to-Russia ... 'If thereby we strip our
selves of adequate defenses . . . that will be O.K. by
the Russia firsters ... no matter what calamities it
may bring on us. The main thing is to save Holy
Russia . .
"Would you call that sly stuff 'aiding the enemy?'
"Obviously YOU wouldn't Captain Patterson for
you wrote those words on February 6. And your
Daily News also goes to munitions workers and sol
diers and sailors and civilians. To some 2,000,000 on
week-days and 3,000,000 on Sundays.
"Or let's say some people, mourning the loss of
an American boy in the Philippines, told everybody
in sight that this was a swell guy, that he'd never
'. . . gone roaring up and down the country shooting
for blood ... it is time that those who willed the
war were driven from their hiding places and sent
to the front ... to share some of the agony they
have created . . ."
"The old hoot and holler about 'War Monger
Roosevelt' again. Would you call such talk 'aiding
the enemy'?
"Not YOU. Colonel McCormick, for you wrote those
words in your Chicago Tribune on February 9. And
about 1,000,000 Americans read it every day.
"You three merely call all this constructive criti
cism, and free speech, and a free pi-ess? And the
ceaseless drip of poison day after day . . . 'Churchill
remains in power . . . because he has succeeded in
dragging the U. S. into England's European entangle
ments' (Hearst) . a congress which taxes us to
destruction for war purposes and then spends two
billion dollars a year for boon-doggling' (Hearst)
'. . . It is too bad that social sessions in candlelight are
all that military and naval leaders of two countries
can find to occupy them while they are losing the
war' (McCormick) '. . . We can not attack Germany
in any effective way' (McCormick) '. . . see that
(Japan) does not defeat us—as she can do if iwe
fritter our forces away all over the world.' (McCor
mick) '. . . A scheme to wreck the republic' (McCor
mick) . A famous remark by Churchill . . . might
now be paraphrased to, Give us the tools and you'll
finish the job' (Patterson '. . . if the arsenal of de
mocracy is stripped of too many of its own defenses it
will be laid open to invasion and conquest' (Patterson)
'. . . What any (American troops) were doing in Java
and what they were fighting for makes an interesting
question . . (Patterson).
"Drip, drip, drip. Day after day after day. Bring
the fleet home, guard our own shores, will there be
elections in 1942, in .1944, the British this, the Rus
sians that, rumors of a separate peace, this Admin
istration has never, this Administration has always . . .
"What in heaven's name do men have to do before
YOU would call it 'aiding the enemy'?
"This page speaks for millions of Americans, an
gry and aroused by your present tactics—whatever you
call them.
"They don't feel that your past record for clair
voyance and omniscience now gives you a moral right
to claw at the policies of this nation at war. 'Certainly
it is not Japan which is precipitating this war with the
U.S.' (Hearst, Dec. 4) '. . . 'What vital interest of the
U.S. can Japan threaten? She can not attack ijs.
That is a military impossibility. Even our base in Ha
waii is beyond the effective striking power of her
fleet' (McCormack, Oct. 27) '. . . but for now and the
near future it is impossible to see how Hitler is a
serious threat to any nation except Russia' (Patter
son, Dec. 5).
"Sure, anybody can make mistakes. Sure, let by
gones be bygones. Okay, but listen—
"Today, American soldiers are dying and American
flyers are crashing in flames and American sailors and
freighter crews are clinging to life rafts and Ameri
can workmen are straining through extra hours . . .
"Today there is aching muscle and no toys for the
kids because of defense stamps . . . there is the sick
fear always and that waiting for a telegram regret
ting to inform you and the secret weeping at 2 a.m. . . .
"So millions of this nation's men and women ask
you three what you are up to now—today—with your
endless carping, your spreading of unease, your con
stant spittle of suspicion of our government and Al
lies? These millions know the difference between all
that and sincere criticism.
"So what are you doing? Not 'aiding the enemy.'
Of course not. You are patriotic men. Hurrah for the
Red, White, and Blue."

always come in the shape of a muffled figure sulking
around with secret plans and code messages.

r pHE following article, under pictures of Hearst, Me-

ad in the San Francisco Chronicle. These are brave
words and it is time someone said them.
♦ * * *
You three know that 'aid to the enemy' doesn't
always come in the shape of a muffled figure sulking
around with secret plans and code messages.
You three know that mighty handsome aid was
given the enemy by flag-draped citizens in Norway
and France and Belgium and all the to-be-conquered
others. 'Our leaders are War-Mongers' . . . 'We're
being used by the British.' . , . 'We can defend our
selves' . , . 'Why should be fight for the Poles?'
"You know, all right. The seeping, sick phrases of
dissension and distrust . . . worth their weight in air
planes to the enemy.
"Now our country is at War. For our lives, we
must beat the Japs and Nazis and help our Allies
every where to beat the Japs and Nazis.
"So suppose you heard a fellow going around nor
—today—among the workers in a munitions plant or
Navy yard saying that our government . . ,
" 'neglects the interest of our own America ... in
order to be a bigshot and a big sap for every foreign
country and every alien people in the world.'
"Would you say that man was hurting morale and
thus aiding the enemy?
"Obviously YOU wouldn't say it, Mr. Hearst, for
you wrote those words.
"On March 10, 1942, you wrote them in your pa
pers —wrote them to aviation workers and men in
Navy yards and soldiers and sailors and the other
4,000,000 Americans that read your papers every day.
"Or suppose another fellow went around jawing
about aid-to-Russia ... 'If thereby we strip our
selves of adequate defenses . . . that will be O.K. by
the Russia firsters ... no matter what calamities it
may bring on us. The main thing is to save Holy
Russia . .
"Would you call that sly stuff 'aiding the enemy?'
"Obviously YOU wouldn't Captain Patterson for
you wrote those words on February 6. And your
Daily News also goes to munitions workers and sol
diers and sailors and civilians. To some 2,000,000 on
week-days and 3,000,000 on Sundays.
"Or let's say some people, mourning the loss of
an American boy in the Philippines, told everybody
in sight that this was a swell guy, that he'd never
'. . . gone roaring up and down the country shooting
for blood ... it is time that those who willed the
war were driven from their hiding places and sent
to the front ... to share some of the agony they
have created . . ."
"The old hoot and holler about 'War Monger
Roosevelt' again. Would you call such talk 'aiding
