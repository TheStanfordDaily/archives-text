### MIKE CHURCHILL 
Vt/HY Mr. "What to do?", do you really mean it
when you say in Campus Opinion that you don't
want to marry a Stanford girl for the duration?
These are treasonous sentiments at times like this,
Mr. "What to do?" With all the fllows joining the
services, feminine morale is at a low ebb this spring.

the Caucus has gone from Hall and Row the
old question of "split ballots" has again raised its
ugly head.
Assuming that Hall votes one way and Row an
other, a false assumption at best, more than one can
didate from either camp, far from jeopardizing the
chances of the party with the greater number of can
didates, actually increases the chances of some one of
that party's candidates being elected.
Illogical as this may seem, the reason is that to win,
a candidate must poll over 50 per cent of the ballots.
If he does this then it doesn't matter if there was one
or ten candidates of the other "party" against him.
It practically needs diagrams to explain, but so
help me, it's the truth.
