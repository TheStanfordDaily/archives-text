# Rooney's Mug Still Brings Down House
## 
### 
"THE COURTSHIP OF ANDY
HARDY," now playing at the Stan
ford in Palo Alto.
"The Courtship" is about the same
as the other eleven Hardy pictures,
and therefore will probably gross an
other million at the box office.
Let it be said, however, that
Mickey Rooney's mugging can still
bring down the house, despite cur
rent critical comment that he has
calmed down. In fact, it sometimes
seemed that he might offset the
highly viscous sentiment which has
slithered around. The ending was
not the ending of the picture, but the
ending of chapter 12.
Second bill is Shirley Temple's
comeback attempt, "Kathleen." The
plot of this picture, even discounting
the child's flights of fancy, is a little
fantastic.
Now it has been noised about that
Shirley Temple has grown up. That
is an exaggeration. But she shows
definite possibilities, and it is too bad
her studio did not wait a couple of
years for her cramped voice to
settle.â€”Covey
