# Farm Elects 27 A.S.S.U. Officers Today
## Voters to Choose from 111 Candidates; Polls Open from 8:30 to 2:30 Today Longest Ballot in Farm History Results from 'No Caucus' Decision 
### 
Student voters will choose from the largest ballot of can- ;
didates in Stanford's history in today's student body elec
tions.
One hundred and eleven candidates will compete for the
27 offices to be filled by the election. This wide-open race has
apparently been caused by the newly initiated "no caucus" I
policy adopted this year by campus leaders for the first time.
Polls at four parts of the campus will open at 8:30 a.m.!
today and close at 2:30 p.m. Polling places will be located at
the English Cornier, Main Library, Engineering Corner, and
Biology Corner.
All students must bring their student body cards to the
polls to be eligible to vote. Elections board officials will be on
duty at each of the polls during the day.
The preferential ballot system will be used in today's elec
tions. Voters will indicate their first, second, and third
choices on each ballot.
As soon as the polls close at 2:30 p.m. today, elections
board officials will begin tabulation of the ballots. Ex Com
mittee will meet at 10 o'clock tonight to approve the results
of the elections.
Full election results will be announced in Thursday's
Daily.
The elections board reports that Nancy Summerfield, La
gunita, is running for Women's Council, and Helen Savory,
Dee Gee, is running for junior woman on Excom, although
neither candidate was included on yesterday's list of nomina
tions.
Three nominees declined to become candidates for elec
tion. Jean Montgomery, Pi Phi, has declined the nomination
for senior class vice-president, and Frank Bauman, Beta, and
Tom Ohligcr, Chi Psi, have declined their nominations for
senior class president.

Student voters will choose from the largest ballot of can- ;
didates in Stanford's history in today's student body elec
tions.
One hundred and eleven candidates will compete for the
27 offices to be filled by the election. This wide-open race has
apparently been caused by the newly initiated "no caucus" I
policy adopted this year by campus leaders for the first time.
Polls at four parts of the campus will open at 8:30 a.m.!
today and close at 2:30 p.m. Polling places will be located at
the English Cornier, Main Library, Engineering Corner, and
Biology Corner.
All students must bring their student body cards to the
polls to be eligible to vote. Elections board officials will be on
duty at each of the polls during the day.
The preferential ballot system will be used in today's elec
tions. Voters will indicate their first, second, and third
choices on each ballot.
As soon as the polls close at 2:30 p.m. today, elections
board officials will begin tabulation of the ballots. Ex Com
mittee will meet at 10 o'clock tonight to approve the results
of the elections.
Full election results will be announced in Thursday's
Daily.
The elections board reports that Nancy Summerfield, La
gunita, is running for Women's Council, and Helen Savory,
Dee Gee, is running for junior woman on Excom, although
neither candidate was included on yesterday's list of nomina
tions.
Three nominees declined to become candidates for elec
tion. Jean Montgomery, Pi Phi, has declined the nomination
for senior class vice-president, and Frank Bauman, Beta, and
Tom Ohligcr, Chi Psi, have declined their nominations for
senior class president.

Student voters will choose from the largest ballot of can- ;
didates in Stanford's history in today's student body elec
tions.
One hundred and eleven candidates will compete for the
27 offices to be filled by the election. This wide-open race has
apparently been caused by the newly initiated "no caucus" I
policy adopted this year by campus leaders for the first time.
Polls at four parts of the campus will open at 8:30 a.m.!
today and close at 2:30 p.m. Polling places will be located at
the English Cornier, Main Library, Engineering Corner, and
Biology Corner.
All students must bring their student body cards to the
polls to be eligible to vote. Elections board officials will be on
duty at each of the polls during the day.
The preferential ballot system will be used in today's elec
tions. Voters will indicate their first, second, and third
choices on each ballot.
As soon as the polls close at 2:30 p.m. today, elections
board officials will begin tabulation of the ballots. Ex Com
mittee will meet at 10 o'clock tonight to approve the results
of the elections.
Full election results will be announced in Thursday's
Daily.
The elections board reports that Nancy Summerfield, La
gunita, is running for Women's Council, and Helen Savory,
Dee Gee, is running for junior woman on Excom, although
neither candidate was included on yesterday's list of nomina
tions.
Three nominees declined to become candidates for elec
tion. Jean Montgomery, Pi Phi, has declined the nomination
for senior class vice-president, and Frank Bauman, Beta, and
Tom Ohligcr, Chi Psi, have declined their nominations for
senior class president.

Student voters will choose from the largest ballot of can- ;
didates in Stanford's history in today's student body elec
tions.
One hundred and eleven candidates will compete for the
27 offices to be filled by the election. This wide-open race has
apparently been caused by the newly initiated "no caucus" I
policy adopted this year by campus leaders for the first time.
Polls at four parts of the campus will open at 8:30 a.m.!
today and close at 2:30 p.m. Polling places will be located at
the English Cornier, Main Library, Engineering Corner, and
Biology Corner.
All students must bring their student body cards to the
polls to be eligible to vote. Elections board officials will be on
duty at each of the polls during the day.
The preferential ballot system will be used in today's elec
tions. Voters will indicate their first, second, and third
choices on each ballot.
As soon as the polls close at 2:30 p.m. today, elections
board officials will begin tabulation of the ballots. Ex Com
mittee will meet at 10 o'clock tonight to approve the results
of the elections.
Full election results will be announced in Thursday's
Daily.
The elections board reports that Nancy Summerfield, La
gunita, is running for Women's Council, and Helen Savory,
Dee Gee, is running for junior woman on Excom, although
neither candidate was included on yesterday's list of nomina
tions.
Three nominees declined to become candidates for elec
tion. Jean Montgomery, Pi Phi, has declined the nomination
for senior class vice-president, and Frank Bauman, Beta, and
Tom Ohligcr, Chi Psi, have declined their nominations for
senior class president.
