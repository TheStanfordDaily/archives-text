# JAP PLANE SINKS IN PACIFIC
## 
### 

HERB'S THE PROGRESS of one Japanese bomber that literally "look
a dive" while attacking units of the U.S. Navy "somewhere in the
Pacific." At top in the dotted circle an anti-aircraft burst hits one of
seven enemy planes as other "ack-ack" bursts dot the sky. Next, the
twin-motored Jap bomber, afire and its port engine shot away, glides
over an American destroyer and dives into the ocean after attempting
to hit the aircraft carrier from which these pictures were made. At
bottom, an airman's camera views the cloud of smoke arising from
the spot where the plane crashed into the ocean.
