# FDR: 'We Are Getting Places'
## President. Discusses Strategy With Pacific War Council: Hull Raps Laval 
### 
WASHINGTON, April. 21 (UP). —President Roosevelt today devoted
major attention to the Far Eastern war theater, discussing strategy with
the Pacific War Council which agreed "we are getting places" in the light
against Japan.
Besides presiding over a 90-minutc strategy huddle with the seven-

nation Pacific Council, Mr. Roose-4-
velt held separate conferences with
Chinese and Dutch military and dip
lomatic leaders. He also conferred
with Russian Ambassador Maxim !
Litvinov and then had a luncheon
meeting with Harry Hopkins, lend- \
lease chief, and Lord Beaverbrook,
former British production minister. ;
Meanwhile, Secretary of State !
Cordell Hull strongly denounced ;
Pierre Laval, new chief of govern- |
ment in France. He said his state- |
ment of last June accusing the Laval- :
Darlan "clique" of plotting to sell
out France to Germany now applies !
more emphatically and more acutely
than ever. He doubted that the peo
ple of France would endorse col
laboration with Germany under j
Laval's leadership.
Hull's rebuke coincided with a
Congressional demand that the
United Nations seize the French In
dian Ocean island of Madagascar, if
it is not certain the island will re
main in friendly hands.
Rep. Carl Hinshaw, R., Calif., said
Madagascar in unfriendly hands
would be "a tragedy of the first
magnitude to the United Nations in
the fight for freedom."
"Apparently Vichy France has
sold out to the Nazis," he told the
House. "But that doesn't mean that
all of the French have sold out by
any means. I believe the Free
French and the millions of those
within Vichy France who are de
termined to be free some day, would
welcome the taking by the United
Nations of that highly important and
strategic island."
The White House war conferees |
heard an extensive report from j
Hopkins on his recent mission to
London with Gen. George C. Mar- |
shall. Army chief of staff, describing |
the report as interesting and encour- j
aging, met in an atmosphere of j
growing encouragement—engendered
in part by the bombing of Tokyo.
The President still refused to com- |
ment officially on the air raids over j
Japanese cities.
