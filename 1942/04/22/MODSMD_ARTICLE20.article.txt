Tliis war is a popular war. Dr. 11. 11. Tawney, staled yesterday in <lio
Tuesday Evening Series ledure on "EJritisli Labour and the War" in the
Education Building Auditorium.
Dr. Tawney went on to qualify (his statement. "Although we dislike
fighting, we dislike it less than tlw alternative. The war is personal and

the British people intend to see it
through," he said.
In regard to the psychological as
pects of the war, Dr. Tawney said
that British labor had a definite hos
tile feeling toward the Nazi party
from listening to Nazi speeches, see
ing Nazi policy especially toward
labor, and by talking to German
refugees.
EXPECTED WAR
When Ibo Munich compromise
enmo the British people "expected
war, had intended to fight, and fell
a personal indignation when it didn't
come." The same feeling was shown
when the civilians threw them
selves into all available was activi
ties in May, 1940.
In discussing the economic back
ground of the war Dr. Tawney
stated, "The ability to pay is not the
standard that must, be used for the
distribution of commodities. Ration
ing by the government must be the
determining factor."
"The necessity of articles and of
commodities should be determined
only by the necessities for victory,"
he stated.

! In regard to the war's political
I background Dr. Tawney said that
| the government has been able to
| carry out many changes that it could
not ordinarily do.
COMPROMISES
"There are revolutionists who now
accept demands for compromise that
in ordinary times they would suc
cessfully resist because they are not
•willing to have England "liberated"
by Hitler.
"To win a war, (1) Ihe people
should be treated as full partners in
the war, and (2) changes should be
effected through co-operation, so the
people will know and love what they
arc fighting for,'' Dr. Tawney
stated.
Because of this policy, the work
ers in the factory and the mine now
regard this as their war, he said.
