### BILL HORNBY 
If you would like to plank your |
size elevens down on some of the
best faces at Stanford, walk through
the office of the 1942 Quad where a
hard-working staff on a 24-hour-a
-day basis is collecting a pile of prints, j
copy, and philosophy which will
eventually develop into Editor Bill
Rowland's "dream" child.
The floor of the institution is now
carpeted with the Farm's &est in an
effort to separate living groups from ;
social clubs, professors from stu- j
dents, and the photographer's pro
fessional work from the products of 1
flash-bulb punchy brains, termed j
"candids."

The latter, shots of spring sports I
activity, late debates, spring social
snaps, and election shots will com
plete the shooting schedule for the

plete, the Quad will be delivered
shortly before examination time, re
ligious authorities and the priorities
board willing.
"We haven't run into any trouble ;
because of priorities yet, and we ;
hope to have the book out on j
schedule, although everything seems
to be in a pell-mell state now," stat- '
ed Rowland.

Meanwhile the photography corps
shoots scenes of Stanford, develops
them in the darkroom to the tunes
of the midnight record programs,
watches while various staff mem
bers hack their masterpieces to
pieces, and goes back for more.
And the best faces in Stanford
stare up from the floor, hoping that
eventually they will find their niche
in the great book so that, someday,
grandson or granddaughter will
look at the product and resolve to be
a face on the floor at the Farm too.
