### H.D. THOREAU 
| DENMARK, a Palo Alto
youth who starred in track,
football, and basketball at Paly
High, is coining back home next fall
after a two-year absence, at least
so says a rumor.
Il seems that his girl friend
moved to Long Beach after grad
ual ion from high school here, so
(■rant had no alternative but to
go South too. He entered Long
Beach Junior College, which is a
slightly different set-up than the
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity, where he has been a sensa
tional maplewund maneuverer
and platter thrower.
Grant is a big boy—6-4. 190
pounds. Last spring he threw the
discus over 145 feet and will prob
ably do better this season. Pitch
Johnson could use him, since his
best man has done 133 feet.
He has been all-Southern Cali
fornia Jaysee center for the past
two years. To give you a relative
idea of how good the team was,
they beat the Trojan frosh by 20
points.
lie's coming back home next fall,
and will enter Stanford as a junior,
despite the evil influence of South
ern California.
* * *
A QUICK look at the Big Meet,
which will be upon us very soon,
shows that although Stanford may
not win by an overwhelming score,
a repeat of last year's farce, in
which the Bears captured all first
places, is highly improbable.
If Ed Hertel's muscle injury
heals, he is a lead pipe cinch to
lake both timber-topping events.
Both Vein Hart and Willie Smith
have cleared (i-4 in the high jump,
a figure not approached by the Cal
jumpers.
Ed Stamm's terrific shot putting
Monday stamps him as a threat to
Berkeley Bob Biles in that event.
Fifty feet in his first meet is not to
be snofezed at. Biles' best official
mark is only four inches better than
Stamm's and Bob has been doing it
for years.
If Jim Jurkovich remains out
of the broad jump as he lias for
the past two weeks, Ripper Kern
should lie in. Maybe he will be,
anyway.

VOW that Helen Crlnkvch has en
tered the University of Califor
nia, the scene is set for some exhi
bition diving duels between her and
Stanford's Marjorie Gestring. Both
have, at one time or other, won the
national title and the latter, if my
memory serves me correctly, was
Olympic champion at the age of 13.
There are, however, a few, no. 15
or 20. drawbacks to this plan. First,
Marj hasn't done any diving in com
petition for several years, second,
she has no time to get into shape—
what am I saying, third, it's out of
the question.

Both Vein Hart and Willie Smith

Ed Stamm's terrific shot putting

Berkeley Bob Biles in that event.
Fifty feet in his first meet is not to
be snofezed at. Biles' best official
mark is only four inches better than
Stamm's and Bob has been doing it
for years.
If Jim Jurkovich remains out
