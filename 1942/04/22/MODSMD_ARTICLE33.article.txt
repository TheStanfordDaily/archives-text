## 
### 
Stanford's chances for a victory in the southern division I'.C.C. swim
ming meet Saturday at Berkeley took a big jump yesterday with an offi
cial okeh on Ted Munroe's participation in the meet.
Whether Munroe, who has won both the 220 and the 440-yard free
styles consistently this year, will lie in (tip shape is a question. llow-

ever, he came off a hospital bed
after a flu attack to win both dis
tance races against Oregon a month
ago.
With Munroe back, Stanford, de
spite an earlier dual meet defeat by
the Trojans, has a very good chance
to win, according to Coach Ernie
Brandsten.
With points on a 6-4-3-2-1 basis
and four men allowed in each event.
Brandsten figures to take 13 points
in the 220 with Captain Don Smith,
Munroe, Rey Rule, and Bill Ala pel
going one. two, three against the best

j the coast can offer.
The great improvement shown re
! cently by Todd Gardner in the
breast stroke and Jim Canning of
■ Stanford in the backstroke may
' bring in points not expected earlier
in the season.

VICHY. April 21 (UP). —Max
Schmeling, former heavyweight
