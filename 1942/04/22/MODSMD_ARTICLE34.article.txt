# Hertel's Leg Heals; May Run in Meet
## 
### 
Although Ed Hertel has not worked
out since he pulled a groin muscle
Saturday, he will probably run
against California Saturday in the
Big Meet.
Hertel, after skimming the hurdles
in the fast times of 14.5 and 23.7,
will be favored to win both the high
and low hurdles if he can get in
shape.
The team as a whole took it easy
in practice yesterday afternoon,
since most of them had run grueling
races against the Bruins Monday
afternoon.
Although there is no danger of
Stanford winning the meet, which
will be held on Angell Field, indi
vidual battles in most of the events
will provide the excitement.
John Silva's wins in both sprints
against Uclan Hubert Duke have
given Farm supporters hope that Hal
Davis will not be too far out ahead
of the Indian dashmen.
Ed Stamm and Hank Norberg
worked out with the weights today
and may cut Cal's iron-men Jurko
vich and Biles out of points in the
shot discus.
