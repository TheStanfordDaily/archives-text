# How About That Stamp Day?
## 
### 
WAR STAMPS will be on the block tomor
row, Thursday, in a specially designated
Stamp Day for Stanford students. They will be
sold every Thursday in living groups for the
duration.
The sale of stamps and bonds is in charge
of a committee working under the Stanford
War Activities Co-ordinator, and after several
enthusiastic students have carefully mapped
their plans, their wares will be up for organized
purchasing tomorrow.
This committee is not just another committee
which has been organized because somebody
thinks it would be nice to be on a committee.
In other words, this organization is not a com
mittee typical of Stanford student committees
of the past. It is a literal revolution among
committees.
One of the co-chairmen is a person who was
at one time so active in committee work that
she grew fatigued and figuratively retired to
pasture. Her interest in awakening Stanford to
the life-and-death necessity of buying stamps
and bonds drove her out of retirement and into
training again. She is making a successful
comeback, to say the least.

The other co-chairman is a man who feels
that if Stanford had done nothing but make a
tremendous success of one thing—the pur
chasing of stamps and bondfe—this year, the
year would have been the most important in
student history. And it may well be.
Every minute of his spare time and, we ven
ture to say, a lot of his academic time, is dedi
cated to promoting the sale of stamps and bonds
in the belief that if we do not win the war,
everything we have done in the way of study
ing and planning for the future will be in vain,
and everything we have now will be worthless.
The important thing, in his mind, is to invest in
the war and reap the happiness which victory
will bring.
There has been some criticism of the idea of
designating a Stamp Day. Some persons are
liable to resent being told to buy a stamp on
any one day, because it is compulsory. They
have not been fully informed of the purpose
of a Stamp Day.
EVERY DAY IS STAMP DAY—AT STAN
FORD AND ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES.
Members of the stamp committee will ask
students in each living group each Thursday
whether they have bought stamps during the
week, and they will ask them how many they
have purchased. The purpose is merely to tab
ulate Stanford purchases, and results will be
carried each Friday morning in The Daily, along
with a comparison with other West Coast col
leges. In the event these committee members
find a person has overlooked his purchase of
stamps, they will ask him to make a purchase
at that time each Thursday.

The committee, then, will merely serve as a
convenience to Stanford students and as an in
spired adding machine to feed The Daily's
barometer of Stanford enthusiasm.

find a person has overlooked his purchase of
stamps, they will ask him to make a purchase
at that time each Thursday.

The committee, then, will merely serve as a

spired adding machine to feed The Daily's
barometer of Stanford enthusiasm.
WAR STAMPS will be on the block tomor
row, Thursday, in a specially designated
Stamp Day for Stanford students. They will be
sold every Thursday in living groups for the
duration.
The sale of stamps and bonds is in charge
of a committee working under the Stanford
War Activities Co-ordinator, and after several
enthusiastic students have carefully mapped
their plans, their wares will be up for organized
purchasing tomorrow.
This committee is not just another committee
which has been organized because somebody
thinks it would be nice to be on a committee.
In other words, this organization is not a com
mittee typical of Stanford student committees
of the past. It is a literal revolution among
committees.
One of the co-chairmen is a person who was
at one time so active in committee work that
she grew fatigued and figuratively retired to
pasture. Her interest in awakening Stanford to
the life-and-death necessity of buying stamps
and bonds drove her out of retirement and into
training again. She is making a successful
comeback, to say the least.

The other co-chairman is a man who feels
that if Stanford had done nothing but make a
tremendous success of one thing—the pur
chasing of stamps and bondfe—this year, the
year would have been the most important in
student history. And it may well be.
Every minute of his spare time and, we ven
ture to say, a lot of his academic time, is dedi
cated to promoting the sale of stamps and bonds
in the belief that if we do not win the war,
everything we have done in the way of study
ing and planning for the future will be in vain,
and everything we have now will be worthless.
The important thing, in his mind, is to invest in
the war and reap the happiness which victory
will bring.
There has been some criticism of the idea of
designating a Stamp Day. Some persons are
liable to resent being told to buy a stamp on
any one day, because it is compulsory. They
have not been fully informed of the purpose
of a Stamp Day.
EVERY DAY IS STAMP DAY—AT STAN
FORD AND ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES.
Members of the stamp committee will ask
students in each living group each Thursday
whether they have bought stamps during the
week, and they will ask them how many they
have purchased. The purpose is merely to tab
ulate Stanford purchases, and results will be
carried each Friday morning in The Daily, along
with a comparison with other West Coast col
leges. In the event these committee members
find a person has overlooked his purchase of
stamps, they will ask him to make a purchase
at that time each Thursday.
