# How About That Hall Smoker?
## 
### 
THE Row reflected "righteous indignation"
yesterday over the Halls' action in holding a
"smoker" Monday night. After the Row had
agreed, along with the Halls, to dump the cau
cus, it seemed to feel the Halls were playing
out of bounds; that they were holding not ex
actly a caucus but at least a political campaign
meeting.
In the first place, the old Hall and Row split
seems to have been calked more tightly this
year. What leakage there might have been was
stopped by the no-caucuses plug.
Probably in retaliation for the Halls' smoker,
at which Hall candidates were introduced,
someone on the Row had signs printed and dis
tributed urging sororities and fraternities to vote
solid Row. They did not recommend any par
ticular candidates, however, and little signifi
cance should be attached to these posters, since
they are not illegal so long as they do not plug
a candidate.
Both the Hall smoker and the Row posters,
however, look a little fishy and it would cer
tainly not be a step backward to finish the clean
up job and eliminate them next year.
