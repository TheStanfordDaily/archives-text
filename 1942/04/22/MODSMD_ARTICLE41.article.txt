### AMIE REICHERT 
IV/TSNDELL WILLKIE is hot for being President of
the U.S. in 1944, and he isnt' making any bones
about it. He isn't trying to fool anyone; he isn't play
ing hard to get. He's working all the angles, and he's
working them early.
liis campaign isn t a very subtle one, since even
I can recognize it for what it is. I don't know whether
such tactics are shrewd or not, but an awful lot of
people are betting that he will be our next President.
Willkie's working all the angles, all right. He has
always been ahead of his party, but now he's ahead
of the opposition party as well.
Yesterday Willkie, the impudent, aggressive up
start shouted down the isolationist greybeards of the
G.O.P. (yes, I mean you, Senator Taft) and forced
the adoption of a resolution by the Republican Na
tional Committee which pledges the party's support for
a program of post-war international co-operation.
Thus did Wendell Willkie begin his campaign for
President in the 1944 election. No, that's not quite
right. I suppose he began it when, on the night of his
defeat in November, 1940, he said something to the
effect that We will carry on the great fight, we will not
give up the magnificent crusade.
What fight was being carried on, what crusade was
referred to was not quite clear at that moment, for the
Republican party was mainly the party of isolation,
and Willkie was an interventionist. So the great fight,
the magnificent crusade, could only mean the election
of Wendell Willkie.

B UT shortly after, the great fight, the magnificent
crusade became disassociated from the musty
G.O.P. and became bigger than Wendell Willkie. It
become what the isolationists of Mr. Willkie's party
called "war-mongering" when Mr. Roosevelt did it.
Mr. Willkie made "interventionist" speeches and
took a look-see trip to England and came back and
conferred with the President and made some more
speeches.
And suddenly the fight and the crusade was no
longer for Wendell Willkie, but for Wendell Willkie
and defeat of the Axis. And now it is for interna
tional co-operation after the war as well.
It has really developed. And Mr. Willkie's election
chances have developed with it. And now it looks as
though the whole Republican party is going to develop
with it, too.
A declaration such as that issued from Chicago by
the Republican National Committee is certainly a pre
mature one militarily, but perhaps it is not politically.
I don't know about these things.
But it looks as though Mr. Willkie is going to lake
over the G.O.P. now the way Franklin Roosevelt took
over his party, and purge it for the contest ahead.
Willkie is giving his party a new record to look
back at and refer to when voting time comes.

IV/TSNDELL WILLKIE is hot for being President of
the U.S. in 1944, and he isnt' making any bones
about it. He isn't trying to fool anyone; he isn't play
ing hard to get. He's working all the angles, and he's
working them early.
liis campaign isn t a very subtle one, since even
I can recognize it for what it is. I don't know whether
such tactics are shrewd or not, but an awful lot of
people are betting that he will be our next President.
Willkie's working all the angles, all right. He has
always been ahead of his party, but now he's ahead
of the opposition party as well.
Yesterday Willkie, the impudent, aggressive up
start shouted down the isolationist greybeards of the
G.O.P. (yes, I mean you, Senator Taft) and forced
the adoption of a resolution by the Republican Na
tional Committee which pledges the party's support for
a program of post-war international co-operation.
Thus did Wendell Willkie begin his campaign for
President in the 1944 election. No, that's not quite
right. I suppose he began it when, on the night of his
defeat in November, 1940, he said something to the
effect that We will carry on the great fight, we will not
give up the magnificent crusade.
What fight was being carried on, what crusade was
referred to was not quite clear at that moment, for the
Republican party was mainly the party of isolation,
and Willkie was an interventionist. So the great fight,
the magnificent crusade, could only mean the election
of Wendell Willkie.

B UT shortly after, the great fight, the magnificent
crusade became disassociated from the musty
G.O.P. and became bigger than Wendell Willkie. It
become what the isolationists of Mr. Willkie's party
called "war-mongering" when Mr. Roosevelt did it.
Mr. Willkie made "interventionist" speeches and
took a look-see trip to England and came back and
conferred with the President and made some more
speeches.
And suddenly the fight and the crusade was no
longer for Wendell Willkie, but for Wendell Willkie
and defeat of the Axis. And now it is for interna
tional co-operation after the war as well.
It has really developed. And Mr. Willkie's election
chances have developed with it. And now it looks as
though the whole Republican party is going to develop
with it, too.
A declaration such as that issued from Chicago by
the Republican National Committee is certainly a pre
mature one militarily, but perhaps it is not politically.
I don't know about these things.
But it looks as though Mr. Willkie is going to lake
over the G.O.P. now the way Franklin Roosevelt took
over his party, and purge it for the contest ahead.
Willkie is giving his party a new record to look
back at and refer to when voting time comes.
