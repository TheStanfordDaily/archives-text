IF IT ISN'T THE NAVY
IT'S FROGS
YESTERDAY a fellow wandered up to the Lake be
tween classes. My, he said to himself, there are a
lot of pollywogs.
I, he went on to himself, would like to catch one,
put it in a jar, and watch it grow.
Then the horrible thought struck him. Every polly
wog in that lake, and there are millions of 'em, could
grow to be a good-sized frog if everything went the
right way.
Just think what that would mean, he mused, no
room for a single student to swim, no use for canoes.
Why, things might even become so congested in the
lake that the frogs wolud have to take over all the
baths and wash basins in Roble and Lagunita. Anyone
that has ever watched a freshman girl in Elementary
Biology will realize the panic that would ensue.
And none of these frogs could be killed, for Stan
ford is a game preserve. They would be all about, in
the Union and Library fountains, in the D.U pool, in
El Toro soup. My what a state that would be. They
might even want exchange dinners with the Tri Delts.

was a car parked in Chancellor Wilbur's
driveway the other afternoon. Through the rear
window was visible one male, and sticking out the door
was a limb, obviously not male.

This was what the Chancellor saw when he turned
into his driveway. Steeled by long years as a public
servant, he simply beepd his horn in the hope that
they would move away. They promptly did, for it
seems that the girl had hay fever and the boy was
just administering nose drops.

r pilE unprecedented number of candidates, almost
as numerous as the pollywogs, gave rise to a
funny situation Monday. The supply of nomination
blanks at the Law Steps was quickly exhausted so
the managers converged on the A.S.S.U. office.

Some quick-thinking fellow, not the least bit anx
ious to run all over for the 15 signatures, passed his
blank around among the other managers, quickly got
it filled without leaving the building. The idea caught
on and it became the practice for the rest of the day.
A guy like that should be running for office, not man
aging somebody else.

was a car parked in Chancellor Wilbur's
driveway the other afternoon. Through the rear
window was visible one male, and sticking out the door
was a limb, obviously not male.

This was what the Chancellor saw when he turned
into his driveway. Steeled by long years as a public
servant, he simply beepd his horn in the hope that
they would move away. They promptly did, for it
seems that the girl had hay fever and the boy was
just administering nose drops.

r pilE unprecedented number of candidates, almost
as numerous as the pollywogs, gave rise to a
funny situation Monday. The supply of nomination
blanks at the Law Steps was quickly exhausted so
the managers converged on the A.S.S.U. office.

Some quick-thinking fellow, not the least bit anx
ious to run all over for the 15 signatures, passed his
blank around among the other managers, quickly got
it filled without leaving the building. The idea caught
on and it became the practice for the rest of the day.
A guy like that should be running for office, not man
aging somebody else.
IF IT ISN'T THE NAVY
IT'S FROGS
YESTERDAY a fellow wandered up to the Lake be
tween classes. My, he said to himself, there are a
lot of pollywogs.
I, he went on to himself, would like to catch one,
put it in a jar, and watch it grow.
Then the horrible thought struck him. Every polly
wog in that lake, and there are millions of 'em, could
grow to be a good-sized frog if everything went the
right way.
Just think what that would mean, he mused, no
room for a single student to swim, no use for canoes.
Why, things might even become so congested in the
lake that the frogs wolud have to take over all the
baths and wash basins in Roble and Lagunita. Anyone
that has ever watched a freshman girl in Elementary
Biology will realize the panic that would ensue.
And none of these frogs could be killed, for Stan
ford is a game preserve. They would be all about, in
the Union and Library fountains, in the D.U pool, in
El Toro soup. My what a state that would be. They
might even want exchange dinners with the Tri Delts.
