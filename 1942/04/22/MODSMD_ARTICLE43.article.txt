## RE DR. TRUEBLOOD 
### 
'T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
On the topic of Dr. Trueblood's sermons: I agree
with "Disgusted." Why must Dr. Trueblood discuss
the war situation at his Sunday morning sermons?
Las Winter Quarter I heard him preach twice. The
first time he summarized the war from the point of
view of We, The Right, fighting Them, The Wrong.
The second time he discussed everything from the
problem of India to the American Negro situation. After
listening to such discussions during six days of the
week, we really need some change on Sunday. Also,
when I do listen to a commentator on current events,
I like to hear one who is an authority on the subject.
