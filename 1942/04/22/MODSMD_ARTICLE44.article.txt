# PREFERENTIAL FOREVER
## 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
I only hope that as the Stanford student body goes
to the polls today they either hold in their hands the
editorial printed on the front page of yesterday morn
ing's paper or else hold in their heads what was said
in those inches.
In the 15 years that I have been voting for every
thing from rushing chiarman of our Sunday school
class to president of the United States, I have never
sen a fairer or more efficient system of casting ballots
than the preferential system, if the pople who vote
understand what they are doing.
In yesterday morning's speeches, one of the candi
dates remarked about the poor election system. Ob
viously, he doesn't understand the system himself.
Not only may the best man win, but may the second
best man come in second, the third best third, etc.
The voicc of experience
