# A 						Great Day For 'Big Ed'
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
It. was a great day in the life of
Edward Alcock Stamm, six feci and
five inches worth of new student
body president.
In the morning the Portland, Ore.,
Zete had a Bawlout average of 122
plus 113, his usual robust (200
pounds) health, and an excited feel
ing. Twelve hours later he had added
to his collection the highest office in
the Farm's .student democracy, the
handshakes of the multitudes, five
Kappa kisses, and an even more ex
cited feeling.
A good majority of Stanfordites
decided that the athletic engineer
was their man, and they marched to
ten small green boxes to do some
thing about it. Several proceeded to
mail letters and postcards home
through the medium of the election
boxes, which perturbed Margaret
Harper's vote-counting brood no
end; but the greater number marked
a determined X in front of E.
Stamm's name. Similarly they hon
ored ljcslie F. Langnecker by voting
her into the vice-president's spot.
SCENE SHIFTS
From there (he scene shifts to the
Nitery at 2:30. With various cam
paign managers, constituents, and
janitors hanging around like vul
tures, the election committee func
tioned. "Stamm, one—Haas—Stamm
—Stamm—Parker—" etc., on into
the night the drone droned, as elec
tion managers got weaker or stronger
depending upon their horse.
When the presidential vote was
counted and the Zetes had marched
ofT for their first celebration of the
evening, the crowd left.
But the work was just beginning
for the election committee. After
sorting the mail and taking it to the
post-office, they were faced with the
job of determining the outcome of
the twenty odd other contests.
NEW SYSTEM EFFICIENT
The job was finished just before
Excom's official canvas at 10 last
night. According to officials, the new
counting system, with quarters mov
ed indoors to the Nitery, worked
more efficiently than in any previous
session.
