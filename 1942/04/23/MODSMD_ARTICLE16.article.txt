# STAMM, LANGNECKER WIN TOP POSTS
## Row Sweeps Major Posts as One-Half Farm Students Vote 
### 
Lid Stamm led a surprisingly strong Row landslide which
swept 24 of 28 offices in yesterday's student body elections.
Stamm, a Zete, was elected A.S.S.U. president over A1 Haas,
El Campo, on the third count by 292 votes.
Leslie Langnecker, Alpha Phi, was elected A.S.S.U. vicc
president by 74 votes over Chris Moody, Lagunita, in a close
race which was decided on the third count.
The total number of votes cast in the election reached 1733,
approximately 50 per cent of the student body. This is
slightly less than the 57 per cent vote recorded in last spring's
election.
Stamm will replace George Jackson as A.S.S.U. president
and Miss Langnecker will Replace Pat Adams as A.S.S.U. vice
president at the beginning of Summer Quarter. Both Stamm
and Miss Langnecker plan to attend Summer Quarter.
"It is a great honor for me to have been elected president,"
said Stamm. "And it was a privilege to have run against such
fine sportsmen as A1 Haas, Norm Ross, and Shelley Parker.
I want to congratulate all those who were elected yester
day and to pledge them my full co-operation during the com
ing year," added Stamm.
"I'm terribly surprised and very pleased and I consider it
a tremendous honor to be elected A.S.S.U. vice-president,"
said Miss Langncker. "That may sound like a lot of superla
tives, but it's the way I feel.

Lid Stamm led a surprisingly strong Row landslide which
swept 24 of 28 offices in yesterday's student body elections.
Stamm, a Zete, was elected A.S.S.U. president over A1 Haas,
El Campo, on the third count by 292 votes.
Leslie Langnecker, Alpha Phi, was elected A.S.S.U. vicc
president by 74 votes over Chris Moody, Lagunita, in a close
race which was decided on the third count.
The total number of votes cast in the election reached 1733,
approximately 50 per cent of the student body. This is
slightly less than the 57 per cent vote recorded in last spring's
election.
Stamm will replace George Jackson as A.S.S.U. president
and Miss Langnecker will Replace Pat Adams as A.S.S.U. vice
president at the beginning of Summer Quarter. Both Stamm
and Miss Langnecker plan to attend Summer Quarter.
"It is a great honor for me to have been elected president,"
said Stamm. "And it was a privilege to have run against such
fine sportsmen as A1 Haas, Norm Ross, and Shelley Parker.
I want to congratulate all those who were elected yester
day and to pledge them my full co-operation during the com
ing year," added Stamm.
"I'm terribly surprised and very pleased and I consider it
a tremendous honor to be elected A.S.S.U. vice-president,"
said Miss Langncker. "That may sound like a lot of superla
tives, but it's the way I feel.

Lid Stamm led a surprisingly strong Row landslide which
swept 24 of 28 offices in yesterday's student body elections.
Stamm, a Zete, was elected A.S.S.U. president over A1 Haas,
El Campo, on the third count by 292 votes.
Leslie Langnecker, Alpha Phi, was elected A.S.S.U. vicc
president by 74 votes over Chris Moody, Lagunita, in a close
race which was decided on the third count.
The total number of votes cast in the election reached 1733,
approximately 50 per cent of the student body. This is
slightly less than the 57 per cent vote recorded in last spring's
election.
Stamm will replace George Jackson as A.S.S.U. president
and Miss Langnecker will Replace Pat Adams as A.S.S.U. vice
president at the beginning of Summer Quarter. Both Stamm
and Miss Langnecker plan to attend Summer Quarter.
"It is a great honor for me to have been elected president,"
said Stamm. "And it was a privilege to have run against such
fine sportsmen as A1 Haas, Norm Ross, and Shelley Parker.
I want to congratulate all those who were elected yester
day and to pledge them my full co-operation during the com
ing year," added Stamm.
"I'm terribly surprised and very pleased and I consider it
a tremendous honor to be elected A.S.S.U. vice-president,"
said Miss Langncker. "That may sound like a lot of superla
tives, but it's the way I feel.

Lid Stamm led a surprisingly strong Row landslide which
swept 24 of 28 offices in yesterday's student body elections.
Stamm, a Zete, was elected A.S.S.U. president over A1 Haas,
El Campo, on the third count by 292 votes.
Leslie Langnecker, Alpha Phi, was elected A.S.S.U. vicc
president by 74 votes over Chris Moody, Lagunita, in a close
race which was decided on the third count.
The total number of votes cast in the election reached 1733,
approximately 50 per cent of the student body. This is
slightly less than the 57 per cent vote recorded in last spring's
election.
Stamm will replace George Jackson as A.S.S.U. president
and Miss Langnecker will Replace Pat Adams as A.S.S.U. vice
president at the beginning of Summer Quarter. Both Stamm
and Miss Langnecker plan to attend Summer Quarter.
"It is a great honor for me to have been elected president,"
said Stamm. "And it was a privilege to have run against such
fine sportsmen as A1 Haas, Norm Ross, and Shelley Parker.
I want to congratulate all those who were elected yester
day and to pledge them my full co-operation during the com
ing year," added Stamm.
"I'm terribly surprised and very pleased and I consider it
a tremendous honor to be elected A.S.S.U. vice-president,"
said Miss Langncker. "That may sound like a lot of superla
tives, but it's the way I feel.
