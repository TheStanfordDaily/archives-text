# Commandos Raid France At Boulogne
## British Cross Strait To Work Sabotage, Return Unharmed 
### 
LONDON, April 22 UP).—British
Commandos fed the fires of rebel
lien and chaos in France today with
a raid on Boulogne, in the very
heart of the German anti-invasion
defense system.
Gorman firing squads were work
in; 1 . overtime in a futile attempt to
suppress a wave of assassinations
and sabotage incident to Pierre La
val's rise to power in Vichy, and
German Marshal Gerd von Rund
:,tent was roaming the western coast
of Europe supervising erection of
Larriers against American-British
invaders when the Commandos
struck their newest and boldest
blow.
The Commandos slipped across the
Dover Straits in the night, sprinted
over Boulogne's sandy beach —past
German pillboxes, spent two hours
i t reconnaissance and, presumably,
in wholesale sabotage. They escaped
hack to their landing boats without
losing a man, London reported.
It was a humiliating and potential
ly dangerous event for the Germans,
:.nd was believed certain to inspire
i l ic French to new outbreaks. There
was evidence that Frenchmen may
h:ive aided in it. It was reported
that, about the time of the raid, a
: 1 ip blew up in the harbor at Eta
j l'-'s, 15 miles to the south, presum
al ly from a boiler explosion, and
it,.it a ship caught fire at Calais, 20
miles to the north. German military
< fficials were said to have seized
several Frenchmen standing by in
Loth places and to have shot them
on the spot.
Only the day before the Germans
had shot 20 Frenchmen at St. Na
zaire for aiding Commandos in their
recent raid on the submarine base
their. There have been hints that
some of the split-second timing of
the Commando operations may be
attributable to advance work done
by spies, possibly dropped by para
chute at night.
