"The California-Stanford Fresh
man Day is strictly a no-date af
fair," stressed President Bill Spra
giris of the of '45, in discuss
ing this annual event to be held im
mediately after the Big Meet.
"There is no charge for the af
fair," Spragins further stressed.
"However, all attending must be
freshmen from either Stanford or
California. They will have tags to
identify their class standing."
It was learned yesterday that, due
to the fact that California students
might be leaving about 10:30 to catch
the northbound trains, a nickelodeon
will furnish the music for the
dance.
