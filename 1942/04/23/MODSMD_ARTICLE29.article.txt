# Netsters Win; Ted Schroeder Defeated
## Tom Brown Knocks Over Indian Star 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Stanford's varsity tennis team con
tinued its win streak this year by
defeating California for the second
time in less than a week, (>-3, at
Berkeley.
Although the Indians dropped the
first and second singles and second
doubles matches, they easily an
nexed the remaining contests for
their sixth consecutive victory this
season.
Tom Brown, Bear boy wonder, de
feated Card Ted Schroeder for the
day's biggest upset, ti-2, 2-6, 7-5.
Although Schroeder took Brown's
measure on the local courts last
week-end, he was no match for the
Berkeleyite on the fast Cal courts.
STOW JUGGLES MEN
Emery Neale, No. 2 Farm player,
evidently ran into the same trouble,,
since he lost to George Spencer in
three sets also, after winning from
the same opponent last week.
Despite some line-up juggling by
Tom Stow, Bear coach, the hosts
were unable to garner another
singles match. Larry Dee, Jimmy
Wade, Andy Roberts, and Ben Olson
all won two set matches from Gunny
Ammonette, Jim Livingston, Harry
Buttimer, and Jim Hobart, respec
tively.
The comparatively new combina
tion of Schroeder and Dee had little
trouble with Cal's top team of Brown
and Livingston, but Neale and Wade
ran into more than they could han
dle in their second doubles match
with Spencer and Bob Tout.
FINAL DUAL MATCH
Tom Kruger and Paul Wilson won
from St. Goar and Ammonette to
give the Cards the final point.
This match is the final dual match
of the season, the team's next com
petition being the P.C.C., Southern
Division matches Friday afternoon
on the Berkeley courts. From these
matches will be decided those men
who represent the coast in the inter
collegiate matches at Haverford, Pa.,
in June.
