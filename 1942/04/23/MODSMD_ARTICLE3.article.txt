# Nippon Troops Near Mandalay In Burma War
## Japanese Outflank Allies, Take Pyinmana As Chinese Retreat 
### 
CHUNGKING, April 22 UP). —
Japanese troops were reported to
night to have occupied the Burmese
town of Pyinmana, 155 miles south
of Mandalay, and to have outflanked
the Chinese defenders of the town
of Loikaw, 70 miles to the east near
the Thailand border.
A communique said that severe
fighting was in progress in the south
ern suburbs of Pyinmana but it was
reported that the main Chinese
forces bad withdrawn to previously
prepared positions north of the town.
The communique, however, ap
parently covered action earlier this
week and later reports said that the
Japanese had reached the northern
suburbs of Pyinmana, athwart the
highway and railroad to Mandalay.
JAPS REACH LOIKAW
On the eastern, or Salween river
front, the communique said that the
Japanese, aided by tanks and air
planes, reached the vicinity of Loi
kaw on Sunday and immediately
began to attack the town on Mon
day.
"Chinese troops, defending Loi
kaw in the midst of extreme diffi
culties, are holding their positions,"
the communique said. "Bayonet
fighting is a daily experience there.
Both our, and the enemy's casual
tics, are heavy."
The communique said that another
Japanese detachment "tried to out
flank us by attacking a point seven
miles north of Loikaw. However, we
halted them."
OUTFLANK DEFENDERS
Reports from the front said, how
ever, that Japanese still were seven
miles north of the town, and thus
had outflanked its defenders.
On the Irrawaddy river front,
around the oil fields of Ycnangyaung
to the west, the communique said
that Chinese troops, after having
occupied that town, "continue their
sweeping operations against the
Japanese" south of it.
(Dispatches received in London on
Wednesday said that Japanese troops
had driven back into Ycnangyaung
and that Chinese reinforcements,
sent there to help British Imperials
to escape from a trap last week,
were fighting a delaying action while
the British withdrew to the north.
It was believed that the Chungking
communique referred to fighting pre
vious to the reported Japanese re
entry into the town.)

"Chinese troops, defending Loi
kaw in the midst of extreme diffi
culties, are holding their positions,"
the communique said. "Bayonet
fighting is a daily experience there.
Both our, and the enemy's casual
tics, are heavy."
The communique said that another
Japanese detachment "tried to out
flank us by attacking a point seven
miles north of Loikaw. However, we
halted them."
OUTFLANK DEFENDERS
Reports from the front said, how
ever, that Japanese still were seven
miles north of the town, and thus
had outflanked its defenders.
On the Irrawaddy river front,
around the oil fields of Ycnangyaung
to the west, the communique said
that Chinese troops, after having
occupied that town, "continue their
sweeping operations against the
Japanese" south of it.
(Dispatches received in London on
Wednesday said that Japanese troops
had driven back into Ycnangyaung
and that Chinese reinforcements,
sent there to help British Imperials
to escape from a trap last week,
were fighting a delaying action while
the British withdrew to the north.
It was believed that the Chungking
communique referred to fighting pre
vious to the reported Japanese re
entry into the town.)
