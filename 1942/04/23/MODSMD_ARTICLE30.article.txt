# West Olympics Face Failure

### 
(Compiled from U.P. reports)
The Pan-American games, sched
uled to take the place of the Olym
pic Games this year with only West
ern Hemisphere nations participat
ing, face indefinite postponement as
a result of the United States decision
not to compete. â€¢
Both Uruguay and Brazil are ex
pected to recommend this week that
the games be postponed until after
the war as a "gesture of solidarity"
with the United States.
On the other hand, other South
American nations, notably Argen
tina, are urging that the games be
postponed until after the war as a
"gesture of solidarity" with the
United States.
On the other hand, other South
American nations, notably Argen
tina, are urging that the games be
held whether the United States en
ters or not. and yesterday in Chicago
Avery Brundage, chairman of the
United States Pan-American com
mittee. said that he was "in sym
pathy" with South American pleas
that this country send at least a
small team to the games, which were
to take place in Buenos Aires.
The reason the United States has
decided not to compete, however,
according to Brundage, is the im
practicability of transporting a team
to South America at this time. To
send them by ship through the sub
marine-infested Caribbean would be
too dangerous.
(Harry Wolter, Stanford baseball
coach and a member of the Pan-
American Games Baseball Commit
tee, yesterday told The Daily that
although he would "like very much
1o see United States athletes partici
pating in the games, the problems of
transportation obviously make it
impossible at this time.")
Ten and a half million people at
tended the San Francisco Fair in
1939.
