# Twiggs Turns Out Champions
## 
### DON SELBY 
A football coach turns out an un
defeated team one year and he's a
miracle man.
But it's doubtful if you've heard
genial Eddie Twiggs, who has turned
out golf teams which have won the
national intercollegiate title three
out of the last four years, called
anything of the sort.
But in circles where men who
| know golf congregate, the name Ed
! die Twiggs brings up a man who can
really teach the game. Year in and
year out, Twiggs is one of the most
popular coaches in the country with
the men who know him.
Especially is he popular with the
sports writers, a group of whom
gave a party in his honor when he
arrived at Columbus, 0., last sum
mer for the N.C.A.A. tourney. And
the reason is that •he "plays ball"
with the boys.
"I've never had a sports writer
double cross me," Stanford's (>:»-
year-old golf coach says. That can
be attributed to the fact that he
is not suspicious of the journalists
I and treats them as friends.
In 1938 Eddie's Stanford team, led
by the great Art Doering, walked
j off with the national intercollegiate
| crown. The following year Warren
I Berl, then a sophomore, paced the
[ Indians in a successful defense of

the championship and himself went
to the finals before dropping the
duke to Tulane's Vince D'Antoni.
The team set a new team scoring
record of 601 strokes.
After his 1940 team dropped to
sixth place in the 1940 tourney,
Twiggs went east in 1941 with what
he terms "the best group of college
golfers ever assembled."

If they weren't it will be hard
to prove it. for Bud Brownell, |
Warren Berl. Bud Finger, and Dee
j Replogle far outdistanced the field
to come home with the team title j
I and a new and far superior scor- j
ing record of 580 strokes. The !
score was made over the par 72
Columbus course, and Twiggs pre- 1
diets that it will be a long wait be
fore another college team turns j
the same trick.
The team not only qualified four |
| men for match play and had in Fin- |
' ger the runner-up for medalist hon
ors, but Brownell did a repeat of I
Berl's showing in 1939 by going
through to the finals. Earl Stewart
of Louisiana State defeated him. |
three and two, in the big match.
You'd think that would be enough |
but back before the time of most of
the present generations of Stanford ;
students Twiggs turned out one of
the best golfers the country has |
known—Lawson Little. Along with
Little came Vein "Spec" Stewart,
and then Doering.
So, while Coach Eddie Twiggs,
who, incidentally, is one of the j
smoothest dressers on the Farm, may j
not be known as a miracle man,
Stanford can rest assured that as
long as he stays here Indian golf j
teams will be among the best in the
country.

EDDIE TWIGGS
A football coach turns out an un
defeated team one year and he's a
miracle man.
But it's doubtful if you've heard
genial Eddie Twiggs, who has turned
out golf teams which have won the
national intercollegiate title three
out of the last four years, called
anything of the sort.
But in circles where men who
| know golf congregate, the name Ed
! die Twiggs brings up a man who can
really teach the game. Year in and
year out, Twiggs is one of the most
popular coaches in the country with
the men who know him.
Especially is he popular with the
sports writers, a group of whom
gave a party in his honor when he
arrived at Columbus, 0., last sum
mer for the N.C.A.A. tourney. And
the reason is that •he "plays ball"
with the boys.
"I've never had a sports writer
double cross me," Stanford's (>:»-
year-old golf coach says. That can
be attributed to the fact that he
is not suspicious of the journalists
I and treats them as friends.
In 1938 Eddie's Stanford team, led
by the great Art Doering, walked
j off with the national intercollegiate
| crown. The following year Warren
I Berl, then a sophomore, paced the
[ Indians in a successful defense of

the championship and himself went
to the finals before dropping the
duke to Tulane's Vince D'Antoni.
The team set a new team scoring
record of 601 strokes.
After his 1940 team dropped to
sixth place in the 1940 tourney,
Twiggs went east in 1941 with what
he terms "the best group of college
golfers ever assembled."

If they weren't it will be hard
to prove it. for Bud Brownell, |
Warren Berl. Bud Finger, and Dee
j Replogle far outdistanced the field
to come home with the team title j
I and a new and far superior scor- j
ing record of 580 strokes. The !
score was made over the par 72
Columbus course, and Twiggs pre- 1
diets that it will be a long wait be
fore another college team turns j
the same trick.
The team not only qualified four |
| men for match play and had in Fin- |
' ger the runner-up for medalist hon
ors, but Brownell did a repeat of I
Berl's showing in 1939 by going
through to the finals. Earl Stewart
of Louisiana State defeated him. |
three and two, in the big match.
You'd think that would be enough |
but back before the time of most of
the present generations of Stanford ;
students Twiggs turned out one of
the best golfers the country has |
known—Lawson Little. Along with
Little came Vein "Spec" Stewart,
and then Doering.
So, while Coach Eddie Twiggs,
who, incidentally, is one of the j
smoothest dressers on the Farm, may j
not be known as a miracle man,
Stanford can rest assured that as
long as he stays here Indian golf j
teams will be among the best in the
