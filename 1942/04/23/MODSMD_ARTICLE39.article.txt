California's track varsity, picked !
at the moment to defeat Stanford in J
their meet here Saturday, defeated 1
Connie Warmerdam and his Olym- |
pic Club squad last week-end, 90 2/3 j
to 40 1/3.

hopes of tipping the larger univer- |
sity squad, the size of the score in- |
dicates that the Bears have been con- I
sistent in improving through the
season. Ralph Dewey pounded out a I
record-breaking two-mile run in j
9:22.8, the best performance for the 1
students.
