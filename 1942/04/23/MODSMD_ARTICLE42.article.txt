# For the Good of Stanford
## 
### 
AS the official voice of the Stanford student
body, The Daily takes great pleasure in
congratulating the newly elected A.S.S.U. offi
cers for next year, and in wishing them every
success in handling the wartime responsibili
ties they face.
While the Row captured the majority of avail
able offices, the old Row vs. Hall bugaboo
will crawl back into its grave for another year.
Elected student body officers, whether Row
or Hall representatives, have nearly always
forgotten traditional pre-election rivalry imme
diately following announcement of results.
The election-time Row and Hall split at Stan
ford guarantees the necessary two-party sys
tem for a democracy. Therefore, it is a good
thingâ€”at election time.
But just as surely as Stanford divides into
two parties each spring, the elected repre
sentatives who sit around the Ex Committee
table every Tuesday night forget these minor
party differences and legislate for the good of
Stanford.
There is one particular thing of which to be
proud in Stanford student government. Every
Row man and woman and every Hall man and
woman is first of all a Stanford man or woman.
