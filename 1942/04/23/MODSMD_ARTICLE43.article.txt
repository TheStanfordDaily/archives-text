# How to Cut Fraternity Expenses
## 
### 
IN the past two quarters fraternities have been
hit and hit hard by the long arm of Uncle
Sam. Less boarders chew the fat with the broth
ers; less roomers hold bull sessions on into the
night; consequently less money flows into the
house coffers.
At a meeting of the National Interfraternity
Conference held two weeks ago, several im
portant and practical suggestions for holding
down chapter expenses were presented. If any
one of these many ideas were to be adopted
by houses on this campus, a considerable
change for the better would be noticed in no
time.
Among the recommendations were: careful
purchasing of supplies and invoice checking;
a use of co-operative buying (this method has
been in use here for over 25 years); low cost
but appetizing menus; penalties for failure to
turn out electric lights upon leaving rooms;
dances without "party frills" such as name
bands, expensive programs, decorations, favors,
and refreshments.
The suggestions went on to emphasize the
importance of the reduction of rushing expenses
to a minimum; elimination of unnecessary serv
ants, with members and pledges taking over
their work; the abandoning of offering "free
rides" as an inducement for pledging; reduction
of the size and expense of chapter publications
with the elimination of gossip-column trivia
about undergraduates.
Probably the most logical of all suggestions
was the "pay-as-you-eat-and-sleep" policy, with
bills paid promptly and no accounts receivable.
The University uses this plan in its dormitories,
there is no reason why the fraternities could
not set up a similar system and avoid a lot of
grief.
Another means of having more cash on hand
continuously would be to solicit debts owed by
alumni, letters to parents of pledges making
clear the financial obligations of membership,
the training of two or more assistant treasurers,
the suspension, if it can be arranged, of prin
cipal reductions on mortgages for the duration,
and if possible the modification of interest rates.
These are only a few of the many ideas. The
Council even went so far as to recommend the
lowering of barriers against non-fraternity men
eating in the houses. This will probably never
come about on this campus because it would
tear down two of the strongest traditions in fra
ternity association -the dinner table singing
and the boarding house reach.
All in all, these suggestions are worth more
than a casual glance. The National Interfra
ternity Council put days of careful study into
Iheir report. John Horrall
