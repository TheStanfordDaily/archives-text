### AMIE REICHERT 
W/HEN Singapore fell somebody around here with a
loud voice said that it would cost a million Amer
ican lives to retake it. In two days, everyone was go
ing around and saying it as though it were the gospel
truth. I object.
It seems to me that the United Nations would be
foolhardy if they went about beating Japan by direct
ing their offensive against the territories that we have
lost. I doubt if we will do this, because it probably
would not knock the Japanese out of the war half so
quickly as another strategy will.
This other offensive strategy was begun last week
end with the air-raids over the three Japanese cities.
This was a move that had double strategic signifi
cance: first, the obvious one, of smashing Japanese
industry and other military objectives; second, luring
the Japanese fleet away from the great naval battle
that was raging in the Bay of Bengal, back to defend
its own waters.
The strategem worked admirably well in both cases.
It is only the beginning.
To beat Japan there are just two things the United
Nations have to do. The first is sink the Japanese Navy,
and the second is sink the Japanese islands.
We have already made a fair-sized dent in their
navy but we still have quite a job ahead of us. But
by now we should have the ships and the planes over
there to do it.
Meanwhile, we can use our bombers to smash the
supply centers at home, and in the bases (such as the
Philippines) which the Japanese have already con
quered.

DO NOT think there will be any need to fight inch
by inch over the conquered territories of Malaya,
the Philippines, Java, Sumatra, and the other Dutch
islands.
Some fighting in these areas, yes, but no great
storming of the bastions of Singapore. That will not
be necessary if we have foundered the fleet and
smashed the island industry.
Singapore was vital to the Japanese in order to
smash the center of Allied resistance for the surround
ing Dutch island group. The whole area was vital to
the Japanese for bases and supply centers.
The Japanese, remember, are now fighting on a
10,000-mile supply line.
The problem for the United Nations is not the
same. We have bases and supply centers in Austra
lia, India, China, the Aleutian Islands, and ultimately
we will have the use of northeastern Russia.
We will strike at the heart of the Japanese empire
and strike hard from these bases. We will strike at
her navy from these bases and from our aircraft car
riers. If we succeed there will be no need to lose
those million American lives to regain Singapore.
