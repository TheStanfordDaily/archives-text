### MIKE CHURCHILL 
SOMETHING NEWS BEEN ADDED'
is being written before the polls close, and for
that reason is based upon surmise rather than
upon the results of the election which are not yet
available.
Regardless of who wins what positions each candi
date will at least have the satisfaction of realizing
that he participated in an honest and free election, a
situation that has been the exception rather than the
rule in years past.
A great deal of the credit for this must go to one
man. This fellow went through the mill of last year's
row caucus and probably knows as well as anyone the
ingenious machinations and Machiavellian tactics that
preceed a caucus.
He came out of last year's row caucus as Interfra
ternity President. It has doubtlessly hurt him to hear
his office called a political football, called heart balm
for a political might have been, hurt him because re
gardless of the man who got the office, these accusa
tions were in the main true.
But Jim Haugh has done two things for which the
Row in particular and the campus in general should be
grateful. First and foremost he removed the election
of Interfraternity President from the spring elections
and ended its life as a bag of shekels with which to
barter.
Then last week he took the initiative in a drive to
rid the row of its blackest mark, the caucus. Against
not the nicest kind of opposition he stuck to his guns
and won his point. The row did not have a caucus.
Unfortunately Jim Haugh's record as Interfrater
nity President is not as satisfactory as that of polit
ical crusader. Fraternities are not easy groups with
which to deal and more than once he took the "well,
don't do it again" stand rather than invoke the law.

last quarter and even before that, the Uni
versity had garbage cans, pails and a miscellany of
containers filled with sand and placed in strategic spots
all over the campus. The reason for these sand pile es
tablishments was thought to be plain to everybody
Apparently it has not been.
