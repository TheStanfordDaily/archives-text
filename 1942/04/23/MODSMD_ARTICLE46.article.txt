# CAMPUS OPINION
## RE: HALL SMOKER 
### 
HP HE EDITOR, SIR:
Though there is little point in now criticizing pre
election activities, we feel The Daily was a little off
the beam in its editorial, "How About That Hall
Smoker?"
In the first place, the editorial actively plugged the
Row by stating that the "Vote Row" posters were
perfectly legal. We call the editor's attention to the
Constitutional provision governing this matter and
trust he will see there is no reference to whether any
one candidate is plugged:
"There shall be no expenditure of money for cam
paign purposes. There shall be'no written campaign
ing of any type. There shall be no publication of any
campaign material on the campus other than that con
tained in The Stanford Daily."
And as for that Hall smoker, both Toyon and Bran
ner have a certain sum allotted for smokers to be
held at any time during the quarter. Granted that the
candidates, nominated without compulsion by anyone
who wanted to nominate anyone, were introduced to
about 70 residents of the two halls, Toyon and Bran
ner. The director of men's halls. Dr. Sharp, was also
present at the meeting to outline to hall men their
duties and activities in the blackout rehearsal (later
cancelled.)
Whether or not this was "expenditure of money for
campaign purposes" is a debatable point.
But there should be little debate as to whether the
"Vote Row" posters come under the heading of "pub
lication or distribution of any campaign material."
We of the Halls wish to compliment The Daily on its
very comprehensive and fair handling of all the elec
tion material up to this time. However, agreeing that
•nir smoker may not have upheld the spirit of this
election, we feel that this editorial was untimely and
not exactly in line with the unbiased record of The
Daily in this campaign.
