A tiny pin-hole in a telephone eahle ean admit
moisture, causing short circuits and service inter
ruptions. But Bell System men have found a vay of
heating this trouble to the punch.
They charge the eahle with dry nitrogen under
pressure. Then should a leak develop, the escaping
gas keeps moisture out. Instruments on the eahle
detect the drop in pressure ... sound an alarm at a
nearhy station., .indicate the approximate location
of the break. A repair crew is quickly 011 its way.
