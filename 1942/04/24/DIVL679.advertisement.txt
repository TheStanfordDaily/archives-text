PRESENTS
Joe Setton. the head of
the color division of Nich
olas Johnston Studios, in
his Palo Alto Studio, be
ginning April 27. Espe
cially reduced rates for
these beautiful natural
color portraits, will give
everybody the opportunity
to have his natural color
portrait by Mr. Setton.
Owing to the fact that
natural color portra : ts are
becoming more and more
popular and desirable, we
want to be the first por
trait studio which extends
this possibility to the
Stanford students. As Mr.
Setton will be in Palo Alto
only for a limited time,
appointments and in
quiries concerning these
natural color portraits
should be made immedi
ately.
