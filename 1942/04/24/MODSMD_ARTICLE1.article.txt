# Farm 'Buys' Army Jeep With Stamps
## Proceeds from War Stamp Sales Total $505, Say Chairmen 
### CHARLEY ALLEN 
Stanford bought an army jeep
yesterday.
The proceeds from the 25-cent
War Stamp sales on "War Stamp
Day" yesterday totaled $505, enough
for the purchase of one army jeep,
according to Sylvia Berry and Irv
Ilcllman, co-chairmen of the War
Stamp Division of the War Activi
ties Committee.
Approximately 43 per cent of the
students purchased stamps yester
day during Stanford's first "War
Stamp Day."
Not only was the "Buy a Jeep"
program an outstanding success, but
the returns from the "Dimes for Di
plomas" contributions were termed
remarkable by the War Activities
Committee.
More than $109 was collected from
students' 10-cent contributions to
the "Dimes for Diplomas" program
at dinner throughout the campus
last night. Approximately 58 per
cent of the students contacted con
tributed to the "War Stamp Scholar
ship" fund, which will be used to
establish scholarships for Stanford
students who enter the service be
fore completing college.
These scholarships will be set up
and administered by the University,
and all Stanford men who were not
able to complete their college work
before entering the service will be
eligible to apply for a "War Stamp
Scholarship." Both graduate and un
dergraduate students will be eli
gible.
The Chi Psi's, Hawthorne, and
Mariposa subscribed 100 per cent to
the "Buy a Jeep" program, and Roble
subscribed 100 per cent to the "Dimes
for Diplomas" fund. The Alpha
Phi's bought $29.50, and the Delta
Chi's purchased $18.75 worth of
War Stamps to lead the Row pur
chases.
Next Thursday will be Stanford
"War Stamp Day" again, and the
War Activities Committee expects to
exceed today's sales.
