# Europe is Now Seething With Fears of Invasion
## Russ Claim U.S. Plane In Siberia 
### 
LONDON, Fri., April 21 (UP).—
Russia announced today that one of
the American bombers which raided
Japan last Saturday made a forced
landing on the Siberian coast, thus
providing the first confirmation
from an Allied source that U.S.
fliers have bombed the enemy coun
try.
The bomber was forced down by a
"defect," and was interned along
with its crew in keeping with inter
national law, the Moscow radio said.
The scene of the landing was not
given, but the Russian maritime
province coast extends to within 600
miles of Tokyo and would be the
most likely place for an American
flier to seek if his plane had been
crippled over Japan.
Moscow gave only meager details,
but it was recalled that the Tokyo
radio, in reporting on the raids this
week, claimed that two U.S. planes
were damaged, one of which dis
appeared in a cloud and the other
at sea, leaving a trail of smoke be
hind.
Moscow's announcement still left
the Japanese to wonder where the
raiders came from and where most
of them went.
(Washington officials issued a
brisk "no comment." They have not
acknowledged that U.S. planes were
involved in the raid.)
