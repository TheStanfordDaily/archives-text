### 
CHUNGKING, April 23 (UP).â€”
Japanese forces with numerical su
periority as high as 10 to 1 have
swept to within 140 miles of Manda
lay on the central Burma front, cap
tured Loikaw in the cast and may
have outflanked the Chinese at Ye
nagyaung in the west, a Chinese
communique announced tonight.
The Chinese fell back 12 miles
north from Pyinmana on the cen
tral front under terrific tank and
plane attack, the communique said,
and fighting is now raging in the
vicinity of Kyidaunggan on the Man
dalay railroad. Latest Japanese
thrusts in that direction were re
ported repulsed, with the Chinese
knocking out one armored car, bul
a gradual withdrawal was admitted.
The communique said the Chinese
held Loikaw for nearly a week al
though outnumbered 10 to 1 and
finally were forced to withdraw in
bitter hand-to-hand fighting to avoid
encirclement. The invaders arc now
progressing northward into the Shan
states from Loikaw, it was indicated.
