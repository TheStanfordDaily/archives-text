PRETORIA, April 23 (UP).â€”The
Union of South Africa today became

ports circulated that South African
troops might occupy Madagascar,

Field Marshal Jan C. Smuts, pre
mier of the Union, handed a note
to the Vichy minister reading:
"Developments have taken place
regarding the French government
i which make it impossible for the

j Changes have taken place from
! which the Union government infer
i with sorrow that the French gov
ernment, under strong pressure, de
cided radically to change its Course
: and to accept collbaoration with the
! Axis."
