# Army Teaches 'C.D.' Students As Farm Makes New Friends
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
(Editor's note: Following is the
first of two articles describing the
Army civilian defense school now
functioning on the campus. A later
issue will carry personal inter
views with defense students.)

During the last two months, the
Stanford family has obtained a dis
tinctly different type of member—
the civilian defense expert, trained
on the Farm to return to Pacific
Coast communities prepared for the
eventualities of "total" war.
Since February 11, when the first
10-day course began, school in
structors have trained nearly 500
citizens from California, Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Montana, and
Nevada.
Occupying the second floor of
Sequoia Hall and a suite of first
floor offices, the present group of
(58 students is the sixth class to
enroll and will graduate on April
29. Detectives, school teachers, fire
chiefs, college instructors, carpen
ters, postal clerks, chemists — all
types of men have left responsible
civil defense positions in their
home towns to be trained at Stan
ford.

Their time isn't wasted. The fac-
I ulty includes some of the finest tech
nical instructors in the United States,
officers revealed, including heads of
chemical and physics departments of
some of the nation's leading univer
sities.

Lieutenant Colonel A. C. Bilickc

who offer the following list of courses
i during a single term: Aerial War
i fare Tactics, Air Raid Warning Sys
' tems, War Gases, First Aid for Gas,
Explosive Munitions, Civilian De
fense Organization, Aerial Bombard
! merit and Effects, Gas Identification,
Blackouts, Decontamination, War
fare Incendiaries and others.
The typical student is of middle
age, probably returning to college
life for the first time in ten or
j twenty years. Stanford officials
have arranged programs to make
j the adaptation as enjoyable as
| possible. Tours of the campus, use
of athletic facilities, and lectures
by regular Farm professors have
! been arranged for each class of the
school.
Especially emphasized in the cur
| ricula are gas warfare protection

i methods and incendiary fighting
I techniques. Stanford professors of
physics and chemistry aid in the
I demonstrations in the Jordan Hall
j classrooms.
The school is one of six in the
' United States and is the first organ
ized after Pearl Harbor. Originally
the Edgehill, Maryland, Arsenal
School of Chemical Warfare was the
sole civilian defense school, and
when the War Department decided
to expand its program, officers from
] the Maryland organization came to
| Stanford.
Every two weeks a new class is
graduated, and every two weeks
Stanford gains from 10 to 90 more
friends.
The time these students have for
observing Stanford college life in
action is limited, but they manage
to get a lot of college flavor with
their gas masks.
The combination is producing
friends for the Farm in places whei'e
indifference was common —in the
barber shop on Main Street or in
the fire department in any town one
can pick. A cross-section of West.
Coast America has come to the Farm
and liked it.

During the last two months, the
Stanford family has obtained a dis
tinctly different type of member—
the civilian defense expert, trained
on the Farm to return to Pacific
Coast communities prepared for the
eventualities of "total" war.
Since February 11, when the first
10-day course began, school in
structors have trained nearly 500
citizens from California, Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Montana, and
Nevada.
Occupying the second floor of
Sequoia Hall and a suite of first
floor offices, the present group of
(58 students is the sixth class to
enroll and will graduate on April
29. Detectives, school teachers, fire
chiefs, college instructors, carpen
ters, postal clerks, chemists — all
types of men have left responsible
civil defense positions in their
home towns to be trained at Stan
ford.

Their time isn't wasted. The fac-
I ulty includes some of the finest tech
nical instructors in the United States,
officers revealed, including heads of
chemical and physics departments of
some of the nation's leading univer
sities.
