# Business, Labor Parley Collapses

### 
SACRAMENTO, April 23 (UP).—
Confidential negotiations for an ar
mistice of political hostilities betwcn
labor, agriculture and business broke
down tonight but the state Senate
interim committee on economic
planning pleaded for public demand
against "politics as usual" in the 1942
wartime elections.
The committee declared old •dif
ferences could be discarded for the
war's duration and a program of
unity substituted. All efforts are
needed "to provide ships, planes,
food and fiber" for the armed forces,
the committee said. Instead, the in
creasing political battles over "Ham
and Eggs" pension plans, "hot cargo
and secondary boycott" and other
labor matters were "a definite threat
to California's war effort."
Senators Robert Kenny of Los
Angeles and John Phillips of River
side County said they offered the
committee as a neutral medium the
past 30 days to work out a settle
ment. Opposing leaders seemed will
ing to harmonize differences until
sudden withdrawal of one group
broke off negotiations. Kenny and
Phillips declined to identify the
b.-ilking group for the present in the
hope negotiations may be resumed.

So unorthodox in his dress was
General Grant, commander-in-chief
of the Union forces during the Civil
War, that his own men frequently
did not recognize him as a soldier.
