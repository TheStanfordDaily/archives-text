### 
WASHINGTON, April 23 (UP).—
Congress armed the government
with a powerful weapon against war
profiteering today when it completed
action on legislation to limit profits
on war contracts and recapture sal
ary and bonus payments deemed
excessive.
The measure—a rider to the $19,-
151,597,000 supplemental war ap
propriations bill which now goes to
the White House for signature—
was an outgrowth of congressional
hearings which disclosed that some
arms producers were reaping profits
ranging from 20 to 1300 per cent on
war orders.
Final action came when the Sen
ate adopted by voice vote a House
approved conference report which
threw out a lower chamber provision
qaUing for a fiat 6 per cent profits
limitation.
