### H. D. THOREAU 
students have been wor
rying as to why Ed Stamm could
put the shot in the intramural meet
Tuesday afternoon after he had won
a meet for the varsity on the pre
vious day.
Well, he didn't. His 48-foot mark
was made about two weeks ago in
the preliminaries, although it wasn't
recorded until after the finals Tues
day. Incidentally, Stamm was re
cently elected student body presi
dent too.

TF YOU like sailing and would like
to see the BIG RACE, the Stan- |
ford-Cal sailing meet, I can let you
in on the best seats in the house for
next to nothing.
All you need is your student
body card to gel by Big Jim Bar- ;
num and his B.A.C. ogres and I j
can get you a seat on one of the
boats. Of course you'll have to
pull a rope and let out a whatsis j
now and then, but it's really no
trouble.
In fact, Howard Wright, admiral |
of the Stanford navy, would be most '
happy to have you come along | p\o
Berkeley.

COUPLE of local kids beat their
brains out regularly for the
benefit of soldiers and little kids in
surrounding arenas and never get
any credit for it. Hank Claflin and
F. Q. Hewitt are the boys, but if
they don't mind, I guess we shouldn't
j kick.
