# Labor Trial Ends Railroad Dispute
## 
### 
PEORIA. 111., April 23 (UP).â€”A
federal jury today acquitted three
Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad
officials of charges of violating the
Railway Labor Act, ending an 18-
day trial which President George P.
McNear said was delaying arbitra
tion of a labor dispute which led to
government seizure of the road.
McNear rejected the most recent
War Labor Board request that he
submit the labor dispute to imme
diate arbitration with the assertion
that he could not consider arbitra
tion while he was on trial. He had
no comment tod;iy when asked if the
end of the trial meant that he now
would yield to the WLB demand.
