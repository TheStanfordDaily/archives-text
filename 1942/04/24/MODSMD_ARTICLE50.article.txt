# Bears to Invade Angell Field
## Tomorrows Final Result Almost Sure 
### 
Stanford's hapless track team faces
its biggest test at 2 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon on Angell Field when it
meets California's Golden Bears.
Only a first-class disaster can keep
the men from across the Bay from
winning the 44th annual renewal of
this Big Meet. Campus books have
been quoting 5 to 1 odds in the
Bear's favor (PA 8709).
Despite the Indians' poor pros
pects, a repeat of last season's clean
sweep of all first places by California
is highly improbable. Ed Hertel,
hurdler; Ed Stamm, shot putter; and
Vein Hart, high jumper, each have
an excellent chance of taking their
events.
HERTEL WOULD THREATEN
Hertel would be a threat to the
meet marks of 14.4 and 23.2 in the
timber events, had he not pulled a
groin muscle last Saturday. Al
though it has healed well, he will
not be in his best condition.
The flat races present the locals
with the worst- problem. Such men
as Hal Davis, • Duane Lewis, Grover
Klemmer, and Ralph Dewey are al
most certain to win their events.
Cal also has good reserve material
in the flat races.
HURDLE WINNERS
The majority of Stanford's points
will be garnered in the hurdles. Don
Reiss, second Indian hurdler, de
feated Cal's best man, Lee Angelich,
last season when the latter was at
Sacramento J.C.
Hart, teamed with sophomore
Willy Smith, will limit Cal to very
few digits in the high jump. Both
have done (5-4 this season, two
inches better than the best Bear,
Guinn Smith.
Indian Captain Gene Kern should
win the broad jump, if Iron Man
Jim Jurkovich remains out of the
event.

wife who's boss often learns soon

will be garnered in the hurdles. Don
Reiss, second Indian hurdler, de
feated Cal's best man, Lee Angelich,
last season when the latter was at
Sacramento J.C.
Hart, teamed with sophomore
Willy Smith, will limit Cal to very
few digits in the high jump. Both
have done (5-4 this season, two
inches better than the best Bear,
Guinn Smith.
Indian Captain Gene Kern should
win the broad jump, if Iron Man
Jim Jurkovich remains out of the
event.

A man who starts out to show his
wife who's boss often learns soon
enough.
Stanford's hapless track team faces
its biggest test at 2 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon on Angell Field when it
meets California's Golden Bears.
Only a first-class disaster can keep
the men from across the Bay from
winning the 44th annual renewal of
this Big Meet. Campus books have
been quoting 5 to 1 odds in the
Bear's favor (PA 8709).
Despite the Indians' poor pros
pects, a repeat of last season's clean
sweep of all first places by California
is highly improbable. Ed Hertel,
hurdler; Ed Stamm, shot putter; and
Vein Hart, high jumper, each have
an excellent chance of taking their
events.
HERTEL WOULD THREATEN
Hertel would be a threat to the
meet marks of 14.4 and 23.2 in the
timber events, had he not pulled a
groin muscle last Saturday. Al
though it has healed well, he will
not be in his best condition.
The flat races present the locals
with the worst- problem. Such men
as Hal Davis, • Duane Lewis, Grover
Klemmer, and Ralph Dewey are al
most certain to win their events.
Cal also has good reserve material
in the flat races.
HURDLE WINNERS
The majority of Stanford's points
will be garnered in the hurdles. Don
Reiss, second Indian hurdler, de
feated Cal's best man, Lee Angelich,
last season when the latter was at
Sacramento J.C.
Hart, teamed with sophomore
Willy Smith, will limit Cal to very
