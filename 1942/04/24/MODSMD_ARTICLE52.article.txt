# Milers to Meet in Penn Carnival
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, April 23 (UP).
—The 48th annual Penn Relay Car
nival opens on Franklin Field to
morrow and, although close to 3,000
athletes are entered, the two-day
meet already has been narrowed to
a duel between two men—Leslie
MacMitchell of N.Y.U. and Camp
bell Kane of Indiana.
Kane, master miler of the Mid
west, is counted on to spark a Hoo
sier drive which may dethrone New
York University as carnival cham
pion. For Indiana is rated stronger
than last year when it won two
major individual titles to finish sec
ond to the Violets.
But matching strides with Kane in
four important events that will de
cide the championship will be Mac-
Mitchell, the kid who learned his
running on the sidewalks of New
York. MacMitchell, mile king of the
recent indoor campaign, outran Kane
last spring to give N.Y.U. this relay
crown.
