# Harry Wolter Will Start Battery of Dyck, Walkup For Final Cal Ball Game
## 
### 
Willi a feeling that they are definitely hot due to their hitting power
shown in last Tuesday's St. Mary's games. Coach llairj Woltei's varsity
hasehallers plan to hand the Califc.rnia Bears a heating tomorrow after
the Big Meet on the Sunken Diamond.
It is the last game of the series; Cal having won the first two games

easily by scores of 16-0, and 18-7.
It is the last game for Clint Evans's
team, while the Cards have two yet
to play with Santa Clara.
Due to his impressive showing in
handcuffing the Phoenix of St.
Mary's, Harry Dyck will be the
starting pitcher. Except for a bad
third inning when they got five runs
off of five hits, Dyck was the master
of the situation at all times, al
ways keeping ahead of the batters.
WALK I I' RECOVERED
Ward Walkup is now completely
recovered from a bruised leg that
slowed him up in the St. Mary's
game, and will be behind the plate
calling"signals and directing the in
field. Walkup is one of three Stan
ford batters that are batting over
.300 for league play; the others are
Leland Scott and Ray Hammett.
At the present it is not certain if
Botch Caruso's ankle is strong
enough to play on, and Harry Par
sons will start for the team captain
at second base. Hammett will be at
first base, Tod Nell, the defensive
star of Tuesday's game will be at
third, and Scott at shortstop.
Hitting the ball with great vigor
in the last three games, Ed Wash
burn has won himself a permanent
posit ion in right field. Washburn is
the team's leading hitter for the
past week. Carl Kellenberger, who
came in fast from deep centerfield
to make a spectacular circus catch
of a low fly ball Tuesday, will be
in center. Howie Dallmar will start
in left field.
BEAR INFIELD
Evans will probably have an in
field composed of Ken Norris, first
base; Alva Mc√üroom, second base;
Don Weir, third base; and Jack Al
bright, short stop. In the outfield
will be George Wilson, Hal Cates,
and Ray Amling. Mario Rodriguez
has been filling in for the injured
Stan Sharp as catcher.
Bill Werle, who the Cards blasted
from the box in the first inning last
Saturday, may get the call to start
on the mound. He is backed up
quite ably by Clarence "Rudy"
Ruonavaara. Ken Kipp. a compara
tive newcomer, won an easy seven
hit affair for the blue and gold last
week against U.S.F., and may see
some action tomorrow.
