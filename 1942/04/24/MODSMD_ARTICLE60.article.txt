# Frosh Runners, Cal Clash Today
## 
### 
With the opening mile run begin
ning at 3:15 sharp, the Stanford
freshman track team comes to the
climax of their season in the "Little
Big Meet" with the California fresh
men tomorrow at Edwards Field in
Berkeley.
California's strength lies mostly in
the field events, especially the high
jump, shot put. and discus. Chuck
Hanger and Cliff McClain have both
cleared six feet, Hanger having won
the Cal-Sacramento J.C. meet with
6-1 ,/ 4. Bob Bishop leads the Cali
fornia weightmen. He sent the dis
cus out 131 feet last week.
Where California's strength is
waning, however, the Cards are all-
Dowerful. There's Jim Pettit, A1
Hoisch, and Dick Hambleton in the
sprints. There's John Fulton, Bob
Sears, Bruce Meyer, and George
Grimes in the middle distances.
There's "Loping" Larry Grey in the
mile.
Making up ihe nucleus of the Card
men in the field events are Jim Kresl
and Don Landale in the high jump,
Ed Chynoweth and Fritz Sander
man in the w< ight.s, Frank Kelly in
the pole vault, i:nd Al Hoisch in the
broad jump.
