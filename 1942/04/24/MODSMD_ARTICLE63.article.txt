## Coach Strands ten Picks Card Swimmers to Win PCC Meet 
### 
Despite an earlier 43-32 dual meet defeat by Southern California, Ernie
Brandsten, Stanford swimming coach, expects his fast-improving varsity
mermen lo win the southern division P.C.C. meet tomorrow at Berkeley
hy a comfortable margin.
Ir.als in swimming races and finals in the diving will be run oil' in the

morning at 10:15, while the swim
ming finals begin at 2:.'JO.
Giving his opponents an even
share of breaks, Brandsten's dope
sheet gives Stanford 53 points to 45
for U.S.C. and 42 for California.
Chief explanation for his optimism
lies in the return of Ted Munroe, ace
distance swimmer, to the squad after
an attack of the measles which sent
him to the hospital on the eve of
last week's Big Meet.
POSSIBLE 220 SWEEP *
With Munroe in shape, Brandsten
figures Munroe, Captain Don Smith,
and Rey Rule to go one, two, three
in the 220 for 13 points in the one
event. Bill Mapcl might slide in for
a fourth or fifth and give Stanford
a clean sweep.
Smith and Rule, who have been
hitting some 55-second flat 100-yard
races, are near top condition and
will do heavy duty tomorrow. Smith
is slated to swim the 100, 220, and
both relays with Ride doing the 220,
100, and final relay.
POINT WINNERS
Although Smith, Rule and Munroe
will do heavy duty, Brandsten is
counting upon Brad Young and Bob
Jones in the 50. Todd Gardner in the
breast stroke, Jim Canning and Pete
Lee in the back stroke, Bill Gard in
the diving, and Doc Colyear, Bob
Regnolds, and Clint Eastman in the
relays for some crucial points.
Most unpredictable event is the
50, where Jones and Young meet Bob
Hill of California, Sexton and Hink
ley of U.S.C., and Dore Schwab of
U.C.L.A. in a race where anything
can happen. All hover around the
