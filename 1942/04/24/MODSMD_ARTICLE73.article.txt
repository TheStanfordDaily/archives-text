# Stamps for a Jeep
## 
### 
STANFORD'S first War Stamp Day yesterday
not only saw the purchase of enough
stamps to buy an army jeep but proved that
Farm participation in the war effort has been
materially strengthened by organized purchas
ing.
It takes five hundred dollars to buy a jeep.
Yesterday's total was five hundred and five
dollars. The committee chairmen estimate next
week's purchases will rise to seven hundred
and fifty dollars, and that this rate may possibly
increase on successive weeks during the quar
ter.
At this rate, Stanford will have purchased,
through V/ar Stamps alone, seven or eight jeeps
during spring quarter, and there is every rea
son for the plan to continue on into summer
quarter and for the duration.
The one hundred per cent contributions of
Chi Psi, Hawthorne and Mariposa to the jeep
program and the one hundred per cent score
of Roble for the "Dimes for Diplomas" fund de
serve commendation.
We regret to add, however, that five frater
nities and one sorority contributed nothing.
This is a miserable record for these houses.
Their contributions should be one hundred
per cent next Thursday.
