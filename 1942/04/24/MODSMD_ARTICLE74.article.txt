# Lesson from Lockheed

YOU can afford to be "snotty" in normal
times.
But during a v/ar it's a matter of pulling to
gether, and no one is excepted. There is not
one reason for anyone being above or beyond
doing his part. War is the great leveler. Right
now it doesn't make any difference how much
wealth or influence you have, you still can't
get a tire without strangling yourself with red
tape.
The best example of the co-operation that is
needed can be applied to Stanford very easily.
Down in Southern California workers going to
and from Lockheed, Vuliee and the other big
plants band together in groups of four or five
in one car.
They have it worked out in a system, in which
one worker uses his car for a certain period,
picking up the other fellows in the morning
and letting them off at night. The next week,
one of the others uses his car. It has proved
so handy and economical that some of the men
will probably still be using the system after the
war is over.
Stanford supposedly has this system going
already with a tradition known as the "Ride to
Paly," something which is harped on every year
by car-less students and tradition-lovers.
Since the war started there has been quite a
noticeable increase in the carrying out of this
traditional responsibility, but there is still room
for more co-operation and economy in local
automobile traffic, and, if nothing else, it's a
good way to meet people. Hap Everett
