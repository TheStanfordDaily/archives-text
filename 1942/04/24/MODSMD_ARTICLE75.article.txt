THERE comes a time once each year when
jaded upperclassmen give way to youth and
beauty at the Daily Shack. Comes Sunday and
freshman and sophomore transfer members of
the staff will write and edit the complete Mon
day morning issue, the annual Freshman Edi
tion.
To Freshman Editor Irma Cunha and her
staff, the best of luck.
Incidentally, any upperclassman who dares
enter the Shack Sunday is to be traditionally
and promptly thrown out on his eat.
