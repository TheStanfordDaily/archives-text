### AMIE REICHERT 
j A . NY day now the big race may be on. The big race
between the Axis and the United Nations fleets.
The big race for the island of Madagascar.
Last night the rumors were flying thick and fast
from Pretoria, South Africa, that South African forces
would occupy the strategic island. The Union of South
Africa yesterday broke off relations with the new
Laval government of Vichyfrance.
Trouble in those waters seems imminent. Japan
j has long eyed the island, which lies of! the East
I African coast, with a greedy eye. It is the most stra
tegic spot on the Pacific map at the moment. It lies
j astride the main Allied supply lines and is vital to
the United Nations war effort.
In Axis hands Madagascar would be a powerful
weapon pointed against the Allies in many directions:
it would be an important naval and air base for the
Japanese to be used for attacks in the Indian ocean;
and if the Japanese were successful in dominating the
Indian ocean and closing it to the United Nations, this
would be an invaluable asset in the Axis plan to join
hands somewhere in the Middle East.
The United Nations therefore cannot afford to let
Madagascar drop to the Japanese. The United Nations
will fight and fight hard for Madagascar; and it looks
as though a great race is in the offing. The future of
I the war may depend on who gets there first.

B7ARLY this month Churchill announced that a
strong Japanese fleet—three battleships and five
aircraft carriers—was in the Bay of Bengal-Indian
Ocean area.
This is the unit which would be expected to seize
Madagascar. It is under the command of tough, shrewd
Admiral Yamamoto of the Japanese Navy.
Whether this unit is still intact is questionable,
however, and that it is no longer concentrated in the
Indian Ocean area is more than likely. For two rea
sons: first, a great naval battle between British and
Japanese units raged all last week in the Bay of Ben
gal; and second, because the recent air attacks on
Tokyo have probably drawn some of the fleet back to
protect Japanese waters.
Churchill at the same time announced that Brit
ain's ace naval chief, Admiral Sir James Somcrville,
had assumed command of the British fleet in the
Indian Ocean, but how much of this fleet remains in
fighting shape after the battles of the Bay of Bengal
is open to conjecture, too.
The Japanese will be stretching their supply lines
pretty thin if they attempt that jump for Madagascar
right now. They are already fighting 10,000 miles
from home. Their original plan probably was to take
Cevlon and, using it as a base, make the hop for the
island in easier stages.
Now, however, when the Allied pressure is on, and
it looks as though we are after the prize too, the
Japanese might bypass Ceylon and strike directly at
Madagascar in a desperate attempt to beat the United
Nations to the draw.
What Laval would do in case of seizure of the
island—by either side—is a question, too. If the Japa
nese were to take it, the chances are he would act just
as Petain did last year when they took Indo China:
that is, hang out the welcome sign, and turn his back.
If the Allies were to get there first, Laval might
send the French fleet to resist the occupation, and
thereby achieve two important ends: (1) bring New
France into the war against the democracies; (2) and
at the same time use this to sell the war to France on
nationalistic grounds.
