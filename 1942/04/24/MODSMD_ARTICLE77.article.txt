### MIKE CHURCHILL 
LIKE PEPSI WITII BETSY?
DUSY from 3:30 to 5 o'clock Friday, April 24? No?
Then perhaps you would like to run up to the
White House, San Francisco purveyors of all that is
feminine, and meet up with the editor-in-chief of
Mademoiselle.
According to an ad in yesterday's Daily just about
everybody is invited to "have tea (or Pespi-Cola, or
orange punch) with Betsy Blaekwell, Mademoiselle's
editor.
I am a fool for free invitations, particularly when
they are going to serve Pepsi-Cola. Of course our
editor got a personal invitation, which makes me feel
a iittle small, just getting mine through an ad, but
that won't keep me down.
Making conversation with the editor-in-chief of
Mademoiselle is not the easiest thing, I am sure. Do
you slink up and, slapping her on the shoulder, say,
"What's doing in dirndls, darling?" or perhaps, in an
off-hand way, "What's the fashion, passion?"
Assuming that I will get introduced I then became
concerned with possible topics of conversation. I there
fore grabbed a past issue of her magazine and thumbed
its pages. It took me some time to get past the founda
tion ads, but at last I came to an article called "Guts
and Glamour."
It is of course about women. In the third para
graph it is stated, "Long before trouble began, they
(women) were there—looking for it."
This is the sort of admission I never expected to
find in a women's magazine.
Beneath a peculiar picture of two young things it
said, "The minute you hit the country, pour your
long, lean legs into trousers —they're young, they're
smart, they're you." They're also pretty horrible.
When I read that "things in general are becoming
no cheaper, rapidly," I was a little terrified, lest I
would not lie able to understand the conversation.
An article entitled, "These Make the Most of You"
speaks of a "fluid, form-fitting 'success torso'" as
though it were something to be strived for. Well,
you can strive for one if you like, but I'm staying
away from that sort of thing.
We'll sec you at the White House, in the College
Shop, second floor. Perhaps we can even form a two
some and "get teary over an all-out blow . . . you
woolly-brained little bistro blossom."
