## WHAT IS A GOOD SERMON? 
### 
'THE EDITOR. SIR:
Yesterday "Disgusted II" criticized with consider
able vigor Dr. Trueblood's discussion in his sermons of
the war situation and of such problems as that of
India or of the American Negro. Ho declares that he
hears such discussions six days a week and wants a
cha.tge on Sunday.
I should be interested in hearing Mr. Disgusted's
definition of a good sermon, but I do not see why a
discussion of the principles of Christianity should be
divorced for the benefit of the listener from the world
in which we are living. Personally, I think that one of
the most important functions of a good sermon is to
apply these principles to problems which are affectvd
by men's attitudes or conduct. And this, to my mind,
is what Dr. Trueblood continually succeeds in doing.
