# Cal-Card Picnic Follows 'Meet'
## Jousting to Feature Lake Entertainment 
### 
"Everyone should bring a bathing
suit to the picnic at the lake," stated
Bill Spragins last night in discussing
the entertainment to be furnished at
the picnic part of the California-
Stanford freshman day tomorrow to
begin immediately after the "Big
Meet."
"There arc going to be canoe
races, swimming races, and jousting
contests," Spragins added, "but there
will be no pre-arranged partici
pants. All who wish to take part
must volunteer at the time." Box
dinners will be served about six
o'clock.
At the conclusion of the picnic the
men will return to Encina and the
women to Roblo where they will
prepare for the sport dance to be
held at Encina from 8 p.m. to 12.
California will be well repre
sented, according to Bob Arnold,
president of the Bear freshman class,
who has spent many hours planning
California's share of the "day."
The program is entirely a no
date affair. Identification tags will
be passed out to all freshmen of
both schools, and only those who
have these cards will be admitted to
the picnic and dance.
Students at Encina arc asked to
furnish dressing quarters to all Cal-Â»
ifornia students needing them. The
same plan will be used at Roble,
only a sign-up system will be in
voked.
