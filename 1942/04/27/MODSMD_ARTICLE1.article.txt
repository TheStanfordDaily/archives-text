LONDON, April 2(1 (UP). â€”RAF bombers streaked 600 miles across
Europe early today to deal a stunning blow to the mammoth Skoda Arms
Works at Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, coincident with the third straight night
assault on the ravaged German Baltic port and airplane center of Rostok.
Targets in south Germany, the docks at Dunkirk and airdromes in occu-

pied France shared in the night's
disasters as British fliers ranged far
and wide over the continent, one
third of the way to the Russian
front, in an offensive that is gaining
force every day.
The Germans struck back with a
two-hour raid on Bath, an evacuee
filled watering place in southwest
England, demolishing many homes
and causing fairly heavy casualties,
but the damage in Britain paled into
insignificance by contrast with the
havoc done in three nights at Rostok,
especially to the Heinkel warplanc
factory and the docks there.
