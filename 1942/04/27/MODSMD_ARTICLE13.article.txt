# Tuesday Series Speaker To Tell Of Army Command
## 
### 
The Committee on Public Exercises announced that Frederic 1... Paxson,
Margaret Byrne Professor of History at the University of California, will
speak on "The Command of the Army" on the Tuesday Evening Series,
April 28, at 7:30 in Memorial Hall.
Professor Paxson, who served as a major in the last war, was attached

to the War Plans Division of the
General Staff from 1918 to 1919. He
is the author of "America at War,"
and editor of "War Cyclopedia." In
his lecture Professor Paxson will
discuss Army command problems
from 1776 to date, with particular [
emphasis on the problems of com
mand arising during and since the
last war. According to Professor
Paxson, "our very existence may be
on the road to wreck through our
culpable neglect to take thought
upon the problem of command and
to follow through with action. For
two decades since the last war the
training schemes for our officers and i
the planning by the general staff j
have carried on, hampered by our i
public indifference but still contin
uing." As an example of his ap
proach to this problem, he says this
of the great Secretary of War. Elihu
Root: "His constructive genius in
time of peace marks the real begin- :
ning of American forethought in an- j
ticipation of war. To him at this mo
ment we are indebted for every week j
in which we escape defeat, and for j
victory if we achieve it. The cap
stone of the job was the creation of ;
the rudiments of a real command." j
Professor Paxson, who is a grad- i
uate of the University of Pennsyl- j
vania, taught at the University of
Colorado, Michigan, and Wisconsin,
before joining the history depart
ment of the University of California.
