# Kreps-Haley To Review Price Ceiling
## Experts to Address Stanford Audience After F.D.R.'s Talk 
### BETTY TREMAYNE 
"Price fixing is an indispensable |
part of winning the war at home," |
Dr. Theodore John Kreps, professor ;
of business economics, said yester- j
day in regard to the price-fixing
plan which is to he reviewed by
President Koosevelt's speech tonight.
In a "follow up" of the President's
speech, Dr. Kreps and Dr. Bernard
Francis Haley, professor of eco
nomics, will speak tomorrow after
noon at 4:15 in the Education Au
ditorium. They will not only speak
on the price-fixing plan which "is
to have a vital effect on every Stan
ford student," but they will also i~e
view important facts of the Presi
dent's message.
ACTION VITAL
The kind of price action which
the President recommends tonight,
Kreps said, "is vital to all, although
it remains to be seen if the freezing
of prices of March 1 will be ac
cepted.
"It is important to win the war
at home as much as it is abroad.
If we let prices distort the economic
picture wc will set up tensions which
will affect the home economy and
retard the execution of war. The
inflation of World War I must not
happen again."
IMPORTANCE EXPLA9INED
Dr. Kreps worked on the price
fixing plan last summer in Wash
ington, D.C., while Dr. Haley will
work in San Francisco when the
price-fixing plan goes into effect.
According to George Hellyer, co
chairman of the Consumer Commit
tee under the Campus War Activi
ties Board, the Krcps-Haley speeches
tomorrow will make clear to stu
dents the exact importance of the
ceiling on prices which will affcct
them primarily through clothing
and food.
After the speeches the program
will be open to questions and dis
cussion from the floor. Questions
for discussion may be handed in be
forehand to Room 13 in the Old
Union, Hellyer said.
