QUARTERS IN AUSTRALIA, April
26 (UP). —American fighter pilots
downed all 11 of the planes which
the Japanese lost yesterday in their
first raid in three weeks on Darwin,
Allied stronghold on the northwest
Australian coast facing enemy-occu
pied Timor, it was revealed today.
The battle, fought over the town
and the adjoining coast, was called
by observers the biggest and most
successful from the Allied stand
point ever waged in Australian
skies.
The Japanese lost a third of the
33 planes participating in the attack,
eight out of 24 bombers and three
out of the nine fighter planes, mak
ing it a costly venture, especially as
the bombs they dropped on Darwin
—numbering about 100 —caused only
a few casualties and slight damage,
according to the communique.
