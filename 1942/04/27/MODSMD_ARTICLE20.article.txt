# Stamp Drive Branded Failure by McClintock
## 
### 
"Stanford is still asleep!" de
clined Colin McClintock, speaking
last night from the stage of Memorial
Theater to a crowd of Sunday
movie-gocrs.
Branding the Farm's first Stamp
Day a failure, McClintock stressed
that the majority of Stanford stu
dents are not co-operating; he em
phasized that a small contribution
from each of the University's 4,000
students would amount to a con
siderable sum. "A one-cent dona
tion from every American would
add up to $1,300,000," he went on.
Challenging Stanford with the
words of a Hollander who ran for
A.S.S.U. president in 1939, "Stan
ford students don't know what's
happening in the world, McClintock
demanded that last week's miserable
record not be repeated.
