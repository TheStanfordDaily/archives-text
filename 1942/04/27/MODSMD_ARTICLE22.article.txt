# Army and Navy Expand Plans For Induction
## Air Force Reserve To Let College Men Finish School Work 
### 
The United States has expanded
its programs for inducting men into
both army and navy air forces, re
leases from Washington indicated
this week.
For the first time, the United
States Army will accept college men
for enlistment in the Air Force Re
serve and will defer their entrance
into service until they have com
pleted college work. Technically,
they would be subject to call at any
time, but actually the army wishes
them to complete scholastic work,
the release declared.
Simultaneously, the United States
Navy anounces that its V-5 naval
reserve program has been expanded
to include men of 18 years who
have completed high school.
Qualified high school graduates
who can fulfill the physical require
ments and pass a mental aptitude
test will be taken after April 27.
The program previously required
two years of college work.
