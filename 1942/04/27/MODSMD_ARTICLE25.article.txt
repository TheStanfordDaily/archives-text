# Hitler Gains Complete Personal Power Over Restive Nazi Citizens
## Fuehrer Vents Wrath Against Own People, Hints at Year's Extension Of Fighting for Russian Forces 
### 
IIKRLIN, April 26 (Radiocast Itccorded by U.P.. New York). —Adolf
Hitler, in a hurried trip hack from the eastern front, demanded and ob
tained from the Reichstag today full power to force any German, regard
less of rank, to "fulfill his duty," and he sharply warned civil officials and
judges against laxity on the home front.

(Trouble on the home front was
apparent in Hitler's speech, recalling
reports reaching high British quar
ters last Friday that he was urging
Germany's war industry chiefs for
failing to keep pace with American
war production, and that he had
thrown Heinrich Koppenberg, man
ager of the Junkers dive bomber
factory at Dessau, into the Dachau
concentration camp for a let-down
in his plant. It was the first time
since his rise to power that Hitler
had vent his wrath on the German
people, who he always insisted were
solidly behind him.)
He broadly hinted that the Ger
man army faced another winter in
Russia, he vividly described the hor
rors he and the army had undergone
there the past winter, and disclosed
that he had had to intervene in
army affairs there "in a few single
instances" when "nerves of discipline
failed, or lack of a sense of duty in
the fulfillment of certain tasks be
came evident." He said his decisions
had been "hard."
INVASION OF BRITAIN
He threatened to retaliate "blow
for blow" for British air raids on
German "civilian populations," but
he evidently renounced an attempted
invasion of the British Isles by say
ing that "against Britain, herself,
however, the submarine is the prin
cipal weapon."
He warned British Prime Minis
ter Churchill that "the (submarine)
menace will master him."
His reference to another winter of
war in Russia came when he re
ported that Russian railways, over
an area as large as Great Britain,
had been regauged to handle German
j rolling stock. He said that "the test
which the front and the country
! passed through this winter must
teach us all a lesson. The German
| railways will during the next win
j ter, wherever it may find us, do
more justice to their task than in
the winter before."
He asked the Reichstag to confirm
that he has the legal right, at any
time he deems necessary, to draft
any German, by all means available
to him, for "the fulfillment of his
duties," and the right "to punish him
accordingly if such duties are vio
lated."

which the front and the country
! passed through this winter must
teach us all a lesson. The German
| railways will during the next win
j ter, wherever it may find us, do
more justice to their task than in
the winter before."
He asked the Reichstag to confirm
that he has the legal right, at any
time he deems necessary, to draft
any German, by all means available
to him, for "the fulfillment of his
duties," and the right "to punish him
accordingly if such duties are vio
lated."
IIKRLIN, April 26 (Radiocast Itccorded by U.P.. New York). —Adolf
Hitler, in a hurried trip hack from the eastern front, demanded and ob
tained from the Reichstag today full power to force any German, regard
less of rank, to "fulfill his duty," and he sharply warned civil officials and
judges against laxity on the home front.

(Trouble on the home front was
apparent in Hitler's speech, recalling
reports reaching high British quar
ters last Friday that he was urging
Germany's war industry chiefs for
failing to keep pace with American
war production, and that he had
thrown Heinrich Koppenberg, man
ager of the Junkers dive bomber
factory at Dessau, into the Dachau
concentration camp for a let-down
in his plant. It was the first time
since his rise to power that Hitler
had vent his wrath on the German
people, who he always insisted were
solidly behind him.)
He broadly hinted that the Ger
man army faced another winter in
Russia, he vividly described the hor
rors he and the army had undergone
there the past winter, and disclosed
that he had had to intervene in
army affairs there "in a few single
instances" when "nerves of discipline
failed, or lack of a sense of duty in
the fulfillment of certain tasks be
came evident." He said his decisions
had been "hard."
INVASION OF BRITAIN
He threatened to retaliate "blow
for blow" for British air raids on
German "civilian populations," but
he evidently renounced an attempted
invasion of the British Isles by say
ing that "against Britain, herself,
however, the submarine is the prin
cipal weapon."
He warned British Prime Minis
ter Churchill that "the (submarine)
menace will master him."
His reference to another winter of
war in Russia came when he re
ported that Russian railways, over
an area as large as Great Britain,
had been regauged to handle German
j rolling stock. He said that "the test
which the front and the country
! passed through this winter must
teach us all a lesson. The German
| railways will during the next win
j ter, wherever it may find us, do
