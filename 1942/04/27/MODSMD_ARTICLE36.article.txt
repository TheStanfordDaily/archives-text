# Band Rehearses For War Concert
## 
### 
The Stanford band, under the di
rection of Frederick P. Search, is
now rehearsing for a concert of
semi-classical music and band
marches. The band was to have pre
sented a concert two weeks ago but
it was cancelled.
According to Mr. Search, there is
a definite need for music in war
time. Building up spirit is essential
if we hope to carry on with the war.
Mr. Search expressed a desire to
have the band give a concert every
week but since it is impossible he
hopes there will be a band concert
every other week.
The band has recently added a
number of band selections, including
war songs, to its library. Mr. Search
promises to present a medley of these
songs at the next concert.
