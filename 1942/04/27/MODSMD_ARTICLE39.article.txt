## 
### 
Led by the remarkable perform
ances ol I'.d I lertel, Ed Stanim, and
Johnny Kilva. the Stanford varsity
track team avenged the accusations
that a record score would he rung
up in the Big Meet last Saturday at
Angcll Field even though they were
defeated by California 91 to 40. The
Golden Bears were geared for 102
points. They fell short by 11.
Ed Hertel came into the meet
"cold," and took both the high hur
dles and lows in 14.7 and 23.7, re
spectively, remarkable time consid
ering the facts. Hertel was pressed
by a Cal man in both events, Lee
Angelich in the shorter race, and
Johnny Meier in the longer, whereas
teammate Don Reiss took a third
both times.
Two weeks of actual practice was
all that Ed Stanim needed to defeat
California's highly-touted Bob Biles
in the shot put with a toss of 51 feet
(J inches.
Contrary to every "dope" sheet
that predicted the meet, little Johnny
Silva of Stanford chased Hal D avis
twice to take second in both the 100
and 220. He edged out Dave Rhodes
of Cal in the century and Murray
Shipnuck in the furlong at the tape.
Silva's 0 points were very influential
in preventing the record score.
