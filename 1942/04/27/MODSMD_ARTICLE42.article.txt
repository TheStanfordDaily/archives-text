(STANFORD at least turned the
tables on the skeptics over the
week-end when they made a fine
showing in the annual Big Meet on
Angell Field. Ed Hertel, Ed Stamm
and John Silva came through in
great style for the Cards. Hertel
wasn't given a chance in the hurdles
because he had pulled a groin muscle
which had prevented a single work
out all week. Ed won both the high
and low hurdles, however, and in
the fairly good times of 14.7 and
23.6; pretty good for a "sick" boy.
Big Ed Stamm pushed the pellet
out a distance of 51 feet. 5 1 â€¢> inches.
This is about two feet better than
Ed has ever done before, and he
hasn't been out for practice long,
either.
"The boy that didn't even have
a chance," Johnny Silva. even
though he didn't win the event,
surprised everybody by hitting
the tape second only to the Bears'
Hal Davis in the 100 and 220-yard
dashes.
In the two-mile Stanford's Bob
Compton refused to let McCampbell
of Cal get ahead of him. The two
boys put up a real battle for second
place, Richards of Cal winning the
race.

"Pitch" Johnson's frosh
scanty-clads were the victims of
bad breaks in their track meet. Ev
erything went wrong in the field,
events, it seems. Even the Bears'
staunchest supporters were afraid
the frosh yearlings would take the
meet until the results of the field
events came in. Mixing the two
teams up, a combined squad of Cal
and Card trackmen would be quite
an unbeatable combination. Some
of the times for the Card frosh in
the dash division proved better or
at least the equal to some marks
set by the upper division tracksters.
Harvard is the most richly en
dowed American university.
