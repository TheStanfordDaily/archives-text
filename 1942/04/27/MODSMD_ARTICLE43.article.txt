# Cardinal Sailors Shade California
## 
### 
Stanford, sailing in competition for I
the first time this year, barely sue
ceeded in defeating California J
points to 130 :l i points. Aided by a
stiff breeze, which shifted just before
the race and caused an alteration of |
the course, the Farm sailors won I
three out of five heats.
Captain Howard Wright and Peter !
Boesche,. aided by the daring wins |
of Sunny Simonds and Frank Jame- I
son, sailed their Olympic monotype
catboat to capture enough points to J
clinch the afternoon's victory.
The meet was one of the most en- |
thusiastic and successful yet en- j
joyed by the two universities, ac
cording to Commodores Milt Ton- i
nini of the U.C. Yacht Club and [
Wright of Stanford.
The Stanford team of Bob Hamp- j
ton and Bud McDonald had to drop
out of the meet because one of the
Cal boats commanded by Chet Rice j
and Jack Lilley was out of com- j
mission.
