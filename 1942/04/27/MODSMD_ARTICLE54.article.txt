# Fire Trap?
## 
### 
IT is common gossip around the Quad that
Encina is a fire trap. People take one look
at the freshman hall, listen to cojnments made
by its present and past occupants, and from then
on they know the awful truth.
But the thing that most people don't do is
think back and remember what Encina's fire
precaution set-up was a few years ago.
Until 1939 Encina had no fire escapes; now
there are three of them. This may seem like a
small number in comparison with the number
of men in the hall, but there are also six door
exits and several first story windows that can
be used for escapes.
The alarm system was not connected to the
fire department. Conseguently, fire alarms
were set off almost daily. But now the fire
system is connected directly to the Stanford
fire station, and there is a $100 fine for false
alarmers.
Another improvement has been made by
having the front doors swing outward instead
of in. Now there won't be a jam in front of
the front door when a group of fellows have
to get out in a hurry.
And as a final improvement, Encina has re
cently bought 1600 feet of new fire hose.
According to Stanley L. Sharp, director of
men's dormitories, Encina sponsors and corri
dor representatives will meet to plan a fire drill.
With all of these improvements going into
effect, it looks as though the rumor about En
cina, fire trap, may soon be a thing of the past.
