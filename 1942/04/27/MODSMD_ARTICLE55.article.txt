# No Business as Usual

### 
THE Stanford most upperclassmen are fa
miliar with is not the same Farm the Class
of '45 will know.
Stanford is not going to be nearly so much a
place of leisure, an excuse for four more years'
sponging off Dad before the problem of earn
ing a living must be faced; the Farm will not
offer much attraction to those who go to college
only for the social life, or to attain "Cultchah."
Not that we're going to forfeit all our social
activities; rather, in the face of gasoline and
rubber shortages, we must follow the clumsy
lead that has already been given us and carry
on these activities on a smaller, on-campus
scale.
Education is becoming a full-time job; stu
dents can no longer afford to waste that valu
able three months of summer which may mean
the difference between being a college gradu
ate and just "having gone to college for a
while."
Selective Service and the prospect of a simi
lar labor draft for women are forcing students
to concentrate their programs; incomes dwin
dling in the face of rising prices and rising
taxes, by making it increasingly hard for fami
lies to send their sons and daughters to college,
are forcing students to get the utmost out of
each guarter they may remain in school.
Students are going to make learning their
business, and it will not be business as usual,
but business as never before.—Dillinger
