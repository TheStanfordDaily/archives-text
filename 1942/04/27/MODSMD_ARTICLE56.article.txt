# Minus Shaf & Co.

### 
YESTERDAY was our day in the Shack. That
was the day that Shafer and the other old
timers took a day off for a big party while we
Frosh, still wet behind the ears, tried our best
to get this paper to you on time.
Yesterday when the Frosh staff walked into'
the Shack and looked at the assignment sheet,
they found orders signed by the Claw, Jr., in
stead of by the Claw. They found that they
didn't get only small number 7's to write; there
were really big things for them to cover this
time.
And when Shaf and Jean and some of the
ordinarily feared members of the regular staff
had nerve enough to poke their heads into the
Shack, they were greeted with waterbags and j
invitations to leave, or else. This time they
had to take the orders.
So here's our effort. We aren't boasting, but ;
neither are we apologizing. You'll probably
find mistakes in proofreading; you'll probably
object to' some of the headlines. But we had
fun without the big boys, and we hope the
paper's okay with you.- Irma Cunha
