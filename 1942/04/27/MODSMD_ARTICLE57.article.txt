### DICK TURNER 
/ QUISLING and Laval are not traitors. They had
been working for a Fascist victory many years.
We Americans still refuse to realize that Norway and
I* ranee succumbed to a strong and well organized
movement which many men considered so valuable
that they sacrificed life and property for its success.
Thus we believe that after we go to Europe and
set the boys straight, everything will be happy and
peaceful again. But a "Hitler's puppet" is much more
than a traitor, an insincere democrat wrested from
the natural attraction of liberty by the lavish offers
of Germany's dictator. If we examine Quisling's rec
ord, for instance, we can see why he is not a traitor.
In 1931, Quisling gained prominence as Minister
of Defense for Norway. Very conservative, he op
posed the liberal laborites in the cabinet and created
such a row that he almost caused the government to
resign. This affair did not prevent him, however,
frpm quitting the progressive Farmers' Party and or
ganizing his own fascist National Union in 1932. Stand
ing at the head of his party, he went to the voters
the following year with the reactionary platform of
suppression of the "revolutionary parties" and the
"freeing" of labor from union domination. In July
1937, he attended the conference of Nazi emissaries
in the German legation at Riga. Here he represented
the Norwegian Nazis and got Hitler's promise of the
Norwegian premiership.
Nor is Laval a traitor. As far back as the first
World War. he went to Switzerland twice and discussed
with German agents the possibilities of getting France
to sign a German peace. In 1935, when he had con
trol of foreign relations, Laval successfully scuttled
the collective security policy, purposely saved Musso
lini's Ethiopian campaign from the destructive effects
of an oil embargo, and shelved ratification of the
Franco-Soviet pact.
We have enormous faith in American democracy
as the basic, internal, normal structure of human so
ciety. Therefore, we censure Laval for having crept
from the fold and betraying us when actually he has
been fighting all along for the establishment of Fascism.

ganizing his own fascist National Union in 1932. Stand
ing at the head of his party, he went to the voters
the following year with the reactionary platform of
suppression of the "revolutionary parties" and the
"freeing" of labor from union domination. In July
1937, he attended the conference of Nazi emissaries
in the German legation at Riga. Here he represented
the Norwegian Nazis and got Hitler's promise of the
Norwegian premiership.
Nor is Laval a traitor. As far back as the first
World War. he went to Switzerland twice and discussed
with German agents the possibilities of getting France
to sign a German peace. In 1935, when he had con
trol of foreign relations, Laval successfully scuttled
the collective security policy, purposely saved Musso
lini's Ethiopian campaign from the destructive effects
of an oil embargo, and shelved ratification of the
Franco-Soviet pact.
We have enormous faith in American democracy
as the basic, internal, normal structure of human so
ciety. Therefore, we censure Laval for having crept
from the fold and betraying us when actually he has
been fighting all along for the establishment of Fascism.
/ QUISLING and Laval are not traitors. They had
been working for a Fascist victory many years.
We Americans still refuse to realize that Norway and
I* ranee succumbed to a strong and well organized
movement which many men considered so valuable
that they sacrificed life and property for its success.
Thus we believe that after we go to Europe and
set the boys straight, everything will be happy and
peaceful again. But a "Hitler's puppet" is much more
than a traitor, an insincere democrat wrested from
the natural attraction of liberty by the lavish offers
of Germany's dictator. If we examine Quisling's rec
ord, for instance, we can see why he is not a traitor.
In 1931, Quisling gained prominence as Minister
of Defense for Norway. Very conservative, he op
posed the liberal laborites in the cabinet and created
such a row that he almost caused the government to
resign. This affair did not prevent him, however,
frpm quitting the progressive Farmers' Party and or
ganizing his own fascist National Union in 1932. Stand
