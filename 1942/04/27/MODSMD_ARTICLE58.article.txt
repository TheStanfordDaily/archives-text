### BILL HORNBY 
1%/JICHAEL CHURCHILL is seeking a new founda
tion. After a heart-to-heart talk with Betsy
Blackwell of Mademoiselle, Mikey realized his mis
shappen approach to life. He wants something that
will give him some pull, but he doesn't want too many
deceptive gadgets—the things have millions of them.
At present he feels as if somebody or something is
taking him in.
Foundations always remind me of bases. Bases call
to mind baseball, this athletics, this stocky builds and
this Roble. Ruble makes me think of Encina, mainly
because Roble sometimes doesn't and sometimes does
think of Encina—a beautiful study in inconsistency.
And Encina makes me think of freshmen.
What with the boathouse continually offering new
angles on life and the faculty still putting up a losing
struggle against the natural law of spring, a frosh sel
dom pauses to look backwards. So we will.

J>EMEMBER when you shook the hand of Dr. Wil
bur and then spent the evening originating smooth
Stanford ways to ditch the "not-even-the-ratio-can
help-me" social companion you received—when the
sponsors told you about Stanford's "T" grid murder
ers and you lost faith in mankind about Big Game
time —The Pajamarino and Roble's rosy reception
(that's supposed to be subtle) —the coffee at the bon
fire building—the day after it —your first "SWISS"
steak at Encina—the day after it—the frosh book that
made your favorite femme look like an anatomy dis
section specimen—the Gaieties and the bodies by
Fisher that you hoped you would grow up to take
out—the Fiftieth Anniversary celebration and the way
it made this year's frosh more understanding of Stan
ford tradition—Herbert Hoover, the living example
that Encina can be lived through—the first exchange
dinner at Roble—the good-looking gal who was a
sponsor unfortunately—the first Roble formal when
all of fifty Encina lads showed up—Johnny Philips
and what we learned the hard way—rushing and the
night you started eating what was put in front of
you, regardless—Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin—the time
you found out that a Cal man is a Cal man, but that
a Cal woman can be friendly—the morning after that—

/ iR IF you want to look around the corner, you might
see that the Class of 1945 will probably be chum
mier than any previous. It will be sticking close to
home. If you don't like what you see around the cor
ner, remember the first and last normal college year
you will have 1941-42.
0.K., Churchill—if you are snapped in and/or out
of it yet, come on back.
