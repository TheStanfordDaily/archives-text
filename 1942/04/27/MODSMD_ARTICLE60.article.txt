# TEAR IT UP, 'DISGUSTEDS'
## 
### 
HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Although I am no expert on sermons, I think that
Mr. Trueblood is very badly treated by the "Dis
gusteds.'' I know only this one rule in English, and I
didn't learn it in class. If you write anything too in
sulting to put your name after it, tear it up.
The "Disgusteds" are masked stabbers. Poor Mr.
Trueblood can't stab back because although they know
his name from his prominence, he can't find theirs
from their obscurity. It is easy to attack those in re- j
sponsible positions, but it is much more difficult to
rise to such positions.
Sincerely,
Andrew Noble, '43 '
