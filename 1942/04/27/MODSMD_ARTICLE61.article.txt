# Technicolor, O'Hara Liven Marine Film

### 
"TO THE SHORES OF TRIPOLI,"
now playing al the Stanford The
ater in Palo Alto.
In wartime anything resembling
propaganda in movie form is a dan
gerous investment. But with the
combination of John Payne, Randy
Scott, red-headed Maureen O'Hara,
technicolor, and enough well-plan
ned humorous incidents, the old
theme of tough-guy vs. the national
anthem is stepped up to the point
of being entertainment. Payne,
worthless and aggressive, runs into
the dynamite, threefold straight
jacket of a sergeant, nurse, and mus
tard plaster. Against such odds,
action and valor are likely to be
aroused in any man. Payne is no
exception. And pretty soon the Ma
rines have an imminent, potential
threat to the Nursing Corps on their
hands. Can they handle him? Can
she?
The second bill, ''The Night Before
the Divorce," with Lynn Bari and
blonde Mary Beth Hughes, is an
odd combination of old, worn "an
gles." Murder, escape, misunder
stood male, clinging blonde, and
farce call for the quick thinking of
Bari to keep her happiness from
ruin. The picture is somewhat tiring
for even the most patient imagina
tion.
