# Dance Highlighted By Circus Gayety
## 
### 
Ringling Brothers circus and the
general spirit of spring gayety took
over Friday night at the Roble For
mal. The dance, said to be one of
the best of the year, was held in
Roble lobby and dining rooms, with
music by Curt Sykes' orchestra.
The success of the dance, however,
was not attributed to the locale or
the music, but rather to the un
usual decorations and sideshow.
Starting with two tunes by Kathie
Baxter, the show continued with an
act by Janet Tillson and Jane
Spaulding, and wound up with an
authentic hula by Rosemarie Price
to the ukelele music of Irma Cunha.
Decorations consisted of animals,
balloons and streamers — all the
props of a circus.
