For the first time since 1919, an

George Jackson, president of the
Associated Students, yesterday re

prominent rugby players asking that
their sport be made a major sport.
Ex Committee will discuss the
matter tonight and Jackson has
urged anyone with an opinion on
the matter to come to the meeting.
Lai ry Dec and Chuck Taylor, B.A.C.

ALL INTERESTED ATTEND
"This proposal," said Jackson,
"will be considered this evening at
7:30 by the Eexecutive Committee,
and any student with an interest in
athletics who feels strongly on the
matter, should be there."
The move has the approval of
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur and
Frank Fish Walker, financial vice
president, who was a rugby star for
Stanford at one time.
In addition to discussion of the
petition asking that rugby be made
a major sport, Ex Committee will
hear the Stanford War Activities
Co-ordinator's budget proposal, ar
rangements for the military ball, and
plans for a program introducing
new student officers to Stanford
problems.
CAPTAINS SIGN PETITION
The rugby petition sets forth the
advantages and importance of rugby,
emphasizes the competitive interest
and physical fitness advantages. It
was signed by A1 Wool, 1942 captain;
Howard Council and Roger Laverty,
co-captains-elect, and George Jede
nofl, veteran and member of the
Northern All-Stars.
Rugby at present is not even a
minor sport. No award is given for
rugby. When American football was
adopted over 20 years ago, rugby was
dropped. However, enthusiasts of
the game continued to get a team
together and play other schools and
clubs.
FULL STATUS DESIRED
The petition asks that the A.S.S.U.
raise rugby to the full status of a
major sport, equal to football, bas
ketball, track, baseball, and tennis.
The last time a sport was given this
boost was in 1919 when tennis be
came a major sport.
To do this, the Executive Com
mittee of the student body must
give its approval and must pass the
necessary by-law.

raise rugby to the full status of a
major sport, equal to football, bas
ketball, track, baseball, and tennis.
The last time a sport was given this
boost was in 1919 when tennis be
came a major sport.
To do this, the Executive Com
mittee of the student body must
give its approval and must pass the
necessary by-law.
For the first time since 1919, an
athletic group at Stanford is for
mally seeking recognition as a major
sport.
George Jackson, president of the
Associated Students, yesterday re
ceived a petition signed by four
prominent rugby players asking that
their sport be made a major sport.
Ex Committee will discuss the
matter tonight and Jackson has
urged anyone with an opinion on
the matter to come to the meeting.
Lai ry Dec and Chuck Taylor, B.A.C.
representatives, have been invited
to give their angle on the subject.
ALL INTERESTED ATTEND
"This proposal," said Jackson,
"will be considered this evening at
7:30 by the Eexecutive Committee,
and any student with an interest in
athletics who feels strongly on the
matter, should be there."
The move has the approval of
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur and
Frank Fish Walker, financial vice
president, who was a rugby star for
Stanford at one time.
In addition to discussion of the
petition asking that rugby be made
a major sport, Ex Committee will
hear the Stanford War Activities
Co-ordinator's budget proposal, ar
rangements for the military ball, and
plans for a program introducing
new student officers to Stanford
problems.
CAPTAINS SIGN PETITION
The rugby petition sets forth the
advantages and importance of rugby,
emphasizes the competitive interest
and physical fitness advantages. It
was signed by A1 Wool, 1942 captain;
Howard Council and Roger Laverty,
co-captains-elect, and George Jede
nofl, veteran and member of the
Northern All-Stars.
Rugby at present is not even a
minor sport. No award is given for
rugby. When American football was
adopted over 20 years ago, rugby was
dropped. However, enthusiasts of
the game continued to get a team
together and play other schools and
clubs.
