# Farm to Stage Disaster Drill Tomorrow Eve
## Full-Scale All-Campus 'Blackout' to Be Held At Order of 4th Army 
### 
Stanford will "black out" during
the daylight on Wednesday.
Because of new regulations issued
by the Western Defense Command
of the Fourth Army, the first full
scalc campus air raid blackout and
disaster drill will be held from 7 to
8 p.m. on Wednesday.
DAYLIGHT BLACKOUTS
These regulations specify that any
practice disaster drills must be held
during full daylight.
Although the "blackout" will be
held during the daylight, it will be
rigidly enforced by air raid wardens,
just as if it were a night blackout.
No air raid warning sirens will
sound, but every campus resident
is expected to extinguish his lights
promptly at 7 p.m. Wednesday. All
campus traffic will be stopped as
soon as the mock "blackout" is be
gun, and no automobiles will be al
lowed to move until the "all clear"
at 8 p.m.
About 7:20 p.m. several disasters
will be simulated at various parts of
the campus. These mock disasters
will be reported through the em
ergency telephone system to the
Control Center in the Corporation
Yard.
COTTRELL HEAD
Professor E. A. Cottrell, in charge
of the disaster squads, will be sta
tioned in the Control Center and he
will dispatch disaster squads to areas
which have reported disasters.
During the drill officials of the
Stanford Civilian Defense Commit
tee will tour the campus inspecting
both blackout and disaster condi
tions.
