# Stanford to 'Hoof' to Classes Tomorrowâ€”'Carless Wednesday'
## Farm Gets Off Dime For National Defense 
### 
Stanford will walk to classes to
morrow in the first "Carless Wed
nesday" held on the campus to con
serve gasoline and tires. Tentative
plans schedule "Carless Wednesdays"
for every other week.
Bob Collins, Stanford War Activi
ties Co-ordinator, has issued these
four principles for a successful
"Carless Wednesday":
WALK, BROTHER
1. Walk to class no matter how
far or how late.
2. If you have to go to Palo Alto,
do it on Tuesday or Thursday or
walk.
3. Off-campus residents should
participate by co-operative driving
if walking is impossible.
4. Professors are expected to co
operate also.
"There were 55 cars in the libe
parking lot at 10 o'clock Monday
morning. Tomorrow there shouldn't
be any; and there's no priority on
energy and shoe leather," declared
Collins in urging the campus to make
"Carless Wednesday" complete.
CO-OP DRIVING
In addition to reducing campus
driving the consumer conservation
commtitee, directed by Dodie Crile
and George Hellyer, plans to stress
co-operative driving for ofT-campus
jaunts. Students will be urged to
make arrangements within their
own living groups for short trips,
and lists will be posted in the Cellar
so that students can combine for
drives to San Francisco and San
Jose.
