# Wilbur Sets Up Guard Priorities
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, April 27 (UP).â€”
| The State Defense Council commit
tee on State Guard allocations,
! headed by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
I of Stanford University, tonight set
up a priorities system on allocation
of guard units to duty at installa
tions of importance to national de
fense.
At the same time, Dr. Wilbur de
clared that he believed that the
guard would be recruited up to al
lowed strength of 7,000 men on ac
tive duty "in a very short time," that
the number might become inade
quate in the near future, and that
the guard so far had "done a good
job under difficult circumstances."
Water resources were given first
priority for allocation of guard units,
followed in order by power instal
lations, oil facilities, transportation
and communications. However, Dr.
Wilbur said that the more important
installations in each category would
be guarded although the entire force
of guardsmen possibly could be ab
sorbed by one category.
