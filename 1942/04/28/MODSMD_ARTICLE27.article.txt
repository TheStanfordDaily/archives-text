# FDR Offers Congress Sweeping Seven-Point Anti-Inflation Program
## Price-Freezing, Income Limits Are Proposed 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 27 (UP).—
President Roosevelt today proposed
the freezing of commodity prices,
rationing <>f scarce goods, stabiliza
tion of wages, and heavier taxes on
war profits in a sweeping effort to
check the rising cost of Jiving.
Without mentioning inflation i>y
name, he laid before Congress a
drastic, seven-point anti-inflationary
program affecting every man, wom
an and child in the nation and
coupled it with the admonition that
"our standard of living will have to
come down."
Highlighting the program were
recommendations that individual
earnings be limited to $25,000 yearly
and that the people liquidate their
debts and voluntarily subscribe to
war bonds.
CITES INCREASE
He said that legislation would bo
necessary to effectuate only two of
his proposals — stiffer profits taxes
and repeal of the law which prevents
price ceilings being placed over farm
products until they reach 110 per
cent of parity.
The President said the cost of liv
ing has increased 15 per cent since
the autumn of 1939 and that "the
time has definitely come to stop the
spiral" of rising prices.
Mr. Roosevelt's seven-point "na
tional economy policy" is based on
current arms expenditures of $100,-
000,000 a day—a figure he said will
be doubled soon.
FIX ALL PRICES
The program would:
1. Tax heavily, and in that proc
ess keep personal and corporate
profits at a reasonable rate, the
word 'reasonable' being defined at a
low level.
2. Fix all prices—consumers, re
tailers, wholesalers and manufac
turers, and impose ceilings on rents
for dwellings in all areas affected by
war production.
3. Stabilize wages through the
War Labor Board and limit indi
vidual earnings to $25,000 annually
after payment of taxes.
4. Stabilize farm prices.
5. Encourage all citizens to con
tribute to the cost of winning the
war by purchasing war bonds.
6. Ration all essential commodities
of which there is a scarcity.
7. Discourage instalment buying
and encourage liquidation of debts.

be doubled soon.
FIX ALL PRICES
The program would:
1. Tax heavily, and in that proc
ess keep personal and corporate
profits at a reasonable rate, the
word 'reasonable' being defined at a
low level.
2. Fix all prices—consumers, re
tailers, wholesalers and manufac
turers, and impose ceilings on rents
for dwellings in all areas affected by
war production.
3. Stabilize wages through the
War Labor Board and limit indi
vidual earnings to $25,000 annually
after payment of taxes.
4. Stabilize farm prices.
5. Encourage all citizens to con
tribute to the cost of winning the
war by purchasing war bonds.
6. Ration all essential commodities
of which there is a scarcity.
7. Discourage instalment buying
and encourage liquidation of debts.
WASHINGTON, April 27 (UP).—
President Roosevelt today proposed
the freezing of commodity prices,
rationing <>f scarce goods, stabiliza
tion of wages, and heavier taxes on
war profits in a sweeping effort to
check the rising cost of Jiving.
Without mentioning inflation i>y
name, he laid before Congress a
drastic, seven-point anti-inflationary
program affecting every man, wom
an and child in the nation and
coupled it with the admonition that
"our standard of living will have to
come down."
Highlighting the program were
recommendations that individual
earnings be limited to $25,000 yearly
and that the people liquidate their
debts and voluntarily subscribe to
war bonds.
CITES INCREASE
He said that legislation would bo
necessary to effectuate only two of
his proposals — stiffer profits taxes
and repeal of the law which prevents
price ceilings being placed over farm
products until they reach 110 per
cent of parity.
The President said the cost of liv
ing has increased 15 per cent since
the autumn of 1939 and that "the
time has definitely come to stop the
spiral" of rising prices.
Mr. Roosevelt's seven-point "na
tional economy policy" is based on
current arms expenditures of $100,-
000,000 a day—a figure he said will
be doubled soon.
