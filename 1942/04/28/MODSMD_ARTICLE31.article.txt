# Three Enemy Columns Driving Steadily Toward Burma Road
## Lashio May Fall Within the Week; Chinese Lend-Lease Supply Periled 
### United Press 
The easternmost of three Japanese columns driving steadily forward
toward North Burma appeared today to be less than 100 miles from Lashio,
western terminus <if China's Burma Road, and there was a chance that
U.S. Lend-lease supplies for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, valued at
many millions of dollars, might have to be destroyed to prevent them from

lailing into the invaders bauds.
If the Japanese maintain the rate
at which they have advanced for
the past several days it was indi
cated that Lashio might fall within
a weekâ€”long before the last of the
vast accumulation of war materials
Washington has been sending to
China could be removed to safety.
FRANTIC EFFORTS
Lashio is the northern terminus of
a railway from Rangoon where
lend-lease sunplies for China were
unloaded betore the port city fell to
the Japanese on March 9. It has
large warehouses and is the seat of
ihe Chinese administration which
lias charge of the Burma Road over
which hundreds of American trucks
have been operating.
Scattered reports for the past
month have indicated that the Chi
nese were making frantic efforts to
remove the accumulated war mate
rials but that the facilities of the
Burma Road were inadequate.
SCOUTS SCATTERED
United States fighter planes based
on Free French New Caledonia
Island, off the east Australian coast,
dispersed Japanese planes trying to
scout the strategic island, which is
one of the guardian points for our
supply line to Australia. Allied
planes continued their bombings of
Japanese bases in New Guinea and
elsewhere and plans for a sustained
drive northward against the Japa
nese were continuing.
