# Farm Players Direct Comedy
## 'Wind and the Rain' To Open Tomorrow 
### 
''The Wind and the Rain," a fast
moving comedy of university life
by Merton Hodge, will be presented
by the Stanford Players in the Little
Theater, April 29, 30, May 1, 2, and
4.
The production represents the
first step taken by the drama de
partment to give the students more
experience in actual production.
Norman Philbrick, graduate student,
author, and previous instructor and
director at Pomona College, will
direct the play.
The cast, headed by Marcia
Shaughnessy and Dwight Ewing, is
now ready for the final dress re
hearsal and last-minute polishing,
according to Director Philbrick.
Others in the cast include John
Lawry, Helen Livingston, John High,
Paul Hostetler, and Gordon Gibb.
The comedy deals with a group of
medical students, presumably in
Edinburgh, and follows the career of
one Charles Tritton in schoolâ€”a ca
reer greatly complicated by the
presence of a social butterfly and a
sculptress.
Although the play is practically a
sell-out, seats can still be obtained
for various performances. Tickets
may be secured from Chester
Barker, secretary of the Department
of Speech and Drama.
