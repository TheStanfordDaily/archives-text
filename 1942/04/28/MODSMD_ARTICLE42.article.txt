# Tornado Sweeps Oklahoma Area
## 
### 
TULSA, Okla., April 27 (UP).—All j
available doctors, nurses and ambu- !
lances were summoned by radio to
night rush to Pryor, Okla., where in- i
formation indicated scores were i
killed in a devastating tornado.
All communications into the cen- |
ter of the storm area were out bul
some meager reports from the
fringes of the stricken area said that
the death toll may mount "into the
hundreds." The tornado apparently
was a giant. Reconstructed from the
first reports, it seemed to be some 10 i
miles wide and its full fury was spent 1
on an area 50 miles long.
Right in the middle was Pryor, a |
boom town whose normal 5,000 '
population is swelled far beyond :
10,000. And most of the residents
particularly the newcomers—live in
hastily constructed frame residences,
in tourist camps or in trailers. They
would be prime bait for a heavy
wind.
