f JP UNTIL the last few weeks there
has been no point in mentioning
the Farm's trackmen in relation to
collegiate performers in other parts
of the country, but with the great
improvement shown by several of
the men within the past few days,
such a comparison is now not out of
place.
* * *
piRST the 22-inch improvement
made by Ed Stamm in the shot
deserves top mention, since that 51-5
put stamps him as one of the na
tion's best, and if he keeps getting
better as the season progresses, he
will have very few peers.
Hi' must contend with A1 Blo
zis, the best shot-putter in the
annals of track who holds all rec
ords except the official world's rec
oi (I which has somehow eluded
him. His best put of 57 feet 9
inches was made after the compe
tition had ended in an indoor meet
when he has performing for pho
tographers.
Mi-hind Blozis, however, there
is no college performer with more
potentialities than has Stamm. Carl
Merritt of U.S.C. and Ed "You
Can't" Beetcm of Penn are the
only other undcrgrads having bet
ter marks. However, Beetem has
not approached his 52-6 mark
since his sophomore year and is
now lucky to hit 50 feet. Merritt
hit 51 -11 at last year's Fresno re
lays. hut hasn't been over 51 since.
Thomas and Thompson of U.S.C.,
Delaney of Notre Darne, Kruger of
Rhode Island, Minini of San Jose,
Lach of Duke, Johnson of Alabama,
and Deal of Rice are the only other
men in the nation's colleges who
have surpassed 50 feet.
All of these names and numbers
mean little to you now, but along
about the second week in June when
Stamm is competing against these
men, they may be worth remember
ing.
There is. however, one little
hitch in this beautiful plan to
make Ed the No. 1 shot putter in
lite country next spring. Enrolled
at U.S.C. now—yes. it's the
Trojans—is a chunky gent named
Earl Audet. As a frosh last year
at Georgetown he pushed the shot
54 feet 1 > inch in a dual meet.
This fall he left the non-Atherton
security of the Iloyas to enter
S.C., where he is now an ineligible
sophomore.
