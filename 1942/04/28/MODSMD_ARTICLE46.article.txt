# FELLER SETS RECORD
## 
### 
NORFOLK, Va., April 27 (UP).—
Bob Feller, the former Cleveland
Indian star, established a new per
sonal strikeout record here yester
day when he fanned 21 batters, as
his Norfolk Naval Training Station
team trounced Wilson, N.C., of the
Class C Bi-State League, 8-2. Feller
also clouted a two-run homer.
The entire content of a rattle
snake's venom is worth about 20
cents at current commercial prices,
scientists estimate.

• Ho showed that ho is still in shape by throwing over 53 foet at the
Long Beach Relays where he could compete unattached. Next year, if all
goes well, he will be eligible as a junior.
Therein lies the hitch.

A LTHOUGH he is still suffering recurrences of the muscle injury that
hit him over a week ago, Ed Hertel is also considered as one of the
country's best hurdlers. So far he has scored marks of 14.5 in the highs
and 23.G in the lows. •
Wright of Ohio State. Iliad of Michigan Normal. Cunimins of Rice,
Biewener and Browning of S C.. Saunders of Miami. Stickel of Pitts
burg. and llalcy of Washington State will he his big competition.
As things stack up now Ed will have to hustle to place in the N.C.A.A.
and A.A.U. meets, but if he improves as much between now and then as he
has from March to the present, he will be in the money.

TOHN SILVA in the sprints. Bob Compton in the mile. Don Reiss in the
•" hurdles, Gene Kern in the broad jump, Vern Hart and Willy Smith
in the high jump, and Russ Peck and Ed Tomaso in the pole vault are
other probable point-winners in the Coast Conference meet at Seattle.

ment.
