# Pettit in Suit as Spring Grid Practice Hits Halfway Mark
## 
### 
Stanford's spring football hit the halfway mark yesterday, and 40-odd
players were still on hand for the regular workout. Jim I'ettit. frosh half
of last year, made his initial appearance and Al Iloisch, another frosh track
man, will suit lip for today's session.
Neele Johnston, lineman on the '41 Papeese, worked at quarterback

in nifty fashion as did Bobby An
drews, also of last season's yearlings.
Milt Vucinich, the converted full
back. macktrucked it like a sprinter
at center. Voos is really cooking at
his new position and looks as if he
is working harder than any man on
the squad.
Head Coach Jim Lawson restricted
yesterday's practice to running
through plays. The boys have been
scrimmaged for about a week, how
ever, and more body contact is in
store as the spring wears on.
MEN MISSING
So many of last year's top-flight
players were missing that no indi
cation of team placement is possible.
Most of those at practice yesterday
were sophs, and from the looks of
things, the Redskins will be at least
three-deep at some positions.
There were too many comparative
"unknowns" to mention, but their
names will find a place as soon as
we find out who they are.
