# Baseball Team Treks to Meet Broncos Today
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team, with two
wins and ten defeats, travels to
Santa Clara today to play the
Broncos in the second game of their
series.
Two weeks ago "Wild" Bill Wilson
dropped a 4-2 decision to Coach Len
Casanova's team, and will be on the
mound tomorrow. Sunday Santa
Clara had little trouble in beating
St. Mary's, 16-0. Duane Pillette set
the Phoenix down with four scratch
singles, while his teammates gath
ered 15.
WETZLER STARTS
Bill Wetzler, conqueror of the In

eighth-inning relief hurling with
the bases loaded and but one out
was outstanding.
Captain Botch Caruso is definitely
out of today's game. Yesterday he
had X-rays taken of his ankle to de
termine if it is broken. Last week
he injured his ankle in practice and
was kept out of the St. Mary's
double-header. In Saturday's game
against Cal, after replacing Harry
Parsons, he pulled up lame at first
base after singling sharply to right
field.
STARTING LINE-UP
Coach Harry Wolter will have
Ward Walkup behind the plate.
Walkup displayed a strong arm Sat
urday when he consistently cut off
men attempting to steal second base.
Ray "Duke" Hammett will be at
first base; Harry Parsons, second
base; Ted Nell, third base; and Le
land Scott, shortstop. The outfield
will be composed of Howie Dallmar,
Carl Kellenberger, and Ed Wash
burn. John Brooke, Bill Cunha, or
Don Pendergrass may also see
service in the outfield.
The Santa Clara infield will be
composed of Crawford, first base;
Mullins, second base; Reese, third
base; and Briganti, shortstop. In the
outfield will be Graham, Freitas, and
Crowley. Fiscalini will catch.

Clara had little trouble in beating
St. Mary's, 16-0. Duane Pillette set
the Phoenix down with four scratch
singles, while his teammates gath
ered 15.
WETZLER STARTS
Bill Wetzler, conqueror of the In
dians, will probably be the starting
pitcher with Buzz Meagher in re
serve. In the last game Meagher's
eighth-inning relief hurling with
the bases loaded and but one out
was outstanding.
Captain Botch Caruso is definitely
out of today's game. Yesterday he
had X-rays taken of his ankle to de
termine if it is broken. Last week
he injured his ankle in practice and
was kept out of the St. Mary's
double-header. In Saturday's game
against Cal, after replacing Harry
Parsons, he pulled up lame at first
base after singling sharply to right
field.
STARTING LINE-UP
Coach Harry Wolter will have
Ward Walkup behind the plate.
Walkup displayed a strong arm Sat
urday when he consistently cut off
men attempting to steal second base.
Ray "Duke" Hammett will be at
first base; Harry Parsons, second
base; Ted Nell, third base; and Le
land Scott, shortstop. The outfield
will be composed of Howie Dallmar,
Carl Kellenberger, and Ed Wash
burn. John Brooke, Bill Cunha, or
Don Pendergrass may also see
service in the outfield.
The Santa Clara infield will be
composed of Crawford, first base;
Mullins, second base; Reese, third
base; and Briganti, shortstop. In the
outfield will be Graham, Freitas, and
Crowley. Fiscalini will catch.
