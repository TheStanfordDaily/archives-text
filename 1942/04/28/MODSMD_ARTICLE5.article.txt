## Pan-Hell Promises Games, Concessions 
### 
Old-fashioned fun, street dancing,
and out-door concessions will at
tract Stanford women, their dates
and numerous stags to the Upper
Row Friday night for the May Day
street dance for the American Red
Cross.
Sponsored by Pan-Hellenic Coun
cil the dance will be held Friday,
May 1, from 8 to 11:30 and all pro
ceeds will be donated in full to the
Red Cross, according to Leslie Lang
necker, general chairman of the
affair.
Dancing to records on the upper
Row, which will be blocked off for
the evening, is the main feature of
Pan-Hellenic's May Day dance. In
addition there will be Coca-Cola,
ice cream and hot dog concessions
contributed by all nine sororities,
Pan-Hell anounced.
Stags as well as couples will be
welcomed to the street dance and
they can purchase tickets at 25
cents at the dance. Informality is
the keynote and dates are purely
optional, sorority officials stressed.
"Stanford has always co-oper
ated in supporting charity drives,
and we on Pan-Hellenic Council feel
that this street dance is an oppor
tunity to have fun and aid the Red
Cross for 50 cents, the price of ad
mission," Hank Wallace, Pan-Hell
president, said.
