# OAKLAND SKIDDING
## 
### 
The Oaks proved this week that
pitching is not enough to win a
pennant. Getting of the best
hurling this circuit has ever seen,
Vergez' boys saw Seattle go by in a
breeze up there this week-end. The
reason is terrible hitting. Christofl
is still dragging it and Westlake is
tailing off after a sensational start.
Good old Marv Gudat and Hugh Lu
by continue to carry the burden.
