# Rugby Recognition

### 
ECOGNIZING that rugby is a sport of
Xl major importance . .
A petition was presented to the Associated
Students yesterday. It is the first time in 23
years that any Stanford bunch has asked to be
recognized as having the status of a major sport.
Here are some of the reasons given for mak
ing rugby a major sport:
Rugby is compatible with the government's
war policy of developing physical fitness in
the students of our colleges. Rugby develops
co-ordination, speed, agility, team-work, and
endurance.
Rugby is unguestionably popular with Stan
ford students. This year 107 students partici
pated; in each of the past four years more than
90 students went out for rugby.
Rugby enjoyed major sport standing at Stan
ford in the period from 1914 to 1917. Rugby
in reality has never been anything but a major
sport at Stanford.
Since its revival, ten years ago, rugby has
brought credit to Stanford without receiving any
sort of recognition from the student body which
it represented. No petition has ever been made
for minor sport standing because it has always
been recognized by students, players, and
coaches as being above minor sport standing.
For ten years rugby has attracted participants
with no incentive other than the love of the
game.
Rugby has had exceptional success at Stan
ford. We have lost only four games in the past
five years. The Stanford varsity won 33 out
of 36 games during the past five years. What
other major sport can match this record?
Rugby enables more men to receive excellent
physical exercise than any other major sport.
Everyone gets a chance to play.
Rugby does not compete with other estab
lished sports at Stanford. The rugby season is
in winter guarter. There are no other outdoor
sports that guarter.
This recognition will reguire the expenditure
of no additional funds. Rugby operates on a
very small financial budget—no expenses are
reguired for coaching, eguipment is very light
and inexpensive. Award winners are willing
to purchase their own Block "S" sweaters.
Rugby helps t6 develop athletes for other
sports.
It is definitely growing in popularity. It is
very easy to adopt, to introduce, and to learn.
It involves few injuries and can be played by
men of all sizes.
Rugby has a very bright future in the physi
cal fitness program. This is another place where
Stanford can aid in the emergency.
Rugby is played at Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and the University of California. It is a sport
of international fame and international popu
larity. Stanford rugby teams have traveled to
Canada, Australia, Paris, and Antwerp.
The competition for the varsity team has been
very keen. This year 107 students competed
for 15 positions.
The purpose of having a Block "S" is to re
ward those men who have brought credit to
the students of Stanford University in the field
of physical education.
There is no doubt that rugby men in the past
few years have done a great deal for the Uni
versity in fostering sportsmanship and display
ing plenty of courage in a tough game.
In time of war all the other sports are coming
down and rugby, which has the Navy's good
word, seems to be coming up to meet them
half-way. However, rugby has not even had
the status of a minor sport and it is going to be
hard to make the jump from an unofficial ac
tivity to a sport egual to football and still main
tain the same inexpensive simplicity and lack
of involvement that the game enjoys here today.

90 students went out for rugby.
Rugby enjoyed major sport standing at Stan
ford in the period from 1914 to 1917. Rugby
in reality has never been anything but a major
sport at Stanford.
Since its revival, ten years ago, rugby has
brought credit to Stanford without receiving any
sort of recognition from the student body which
it represented. No petition has ever been made
for minor sport standing because it has always
been recognized by students, players, and
coaches as being above minor sport standing.
For ten years rugby has attracted participants
with no incentive other than the love of the
game.
Rugby has had exceptional success at Stan
ford. We have lost only four games in the past
five years. The Stanford varsity won 33 out
of 36 games during the past five years. What
other major sport can match this record?
Rugby enables more men to receive excellent
physical exercise than any other major sport.
Everyone gets a chance to play.
Rugby does not compete with other estab
lished sports at Stanford. The rugby season is
in winter guarter. There are no other outdoor
sports that guarter.
This recognition will reguire the expenditure
of no additional funds. Rugby operates on a
very small financial budget—no expenses are
reguired for coaching, eguipment is very light
and inexpensive. Award winners are willing
to purchase their own Block "S" sweaters.
Rugby helps t6 develop athletes for other
sports.
It is definitely growing in popularity. It is
very easy to adopt, to introduce, and to learn.
It involves few injuries and can be played by
men of all sizes.
Rugby has a very bright future in the physi
cal fitness program. This is another place where
Stanford can aid in the emergency.
Rugby is played at Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and the University of California. It is a sport
of international fame and international popu
larity. Stanford rugby teams have traveled to
Canada, Australia, Paris, and Antwerp.
The competition for the varsity team has been
very keen. This year 107 students competed
for 15 positions.
The purpose of having a Block "S" is to re
ward those men who have brought credit to
the students of Stanford University in the field
of physical education.
There is no doubt that rugby men in the past
few years have done a great deal for the Uni
versity in fostering sportsmanship and display
ing plenty of courage in a tough game.
In time of war all the other sports are coming
down and rugby, which has the Navy's good
word, seems to be coming up to meet them
half-way. However, rugby has not even had
the status of a minor sport and it is going to be
hard to make the jump from an unofficial ac
tivity to a sport egual to football and still main
tain the same inexpensive simplicity and lack
of involvement that the game enjoys here today.

ECOGNIZING that rugby is a sport of

A petition was presented to the Associated
Students yesterday. It is the first time in 23
years that any Stanford bunch has asked to be
recognized as having the status of a major sport.
Here are some of the reasons given for mak
ing rugby a major sport:
Rugby is compatible with the government's
war policy of developing physical fitness in
the students of our colleges. Rugby develops
co-ordination, speed, agility, team-work, and
endurance.
Rugby is unguestionably popular with Stan
ford students. This year 107 students partici
