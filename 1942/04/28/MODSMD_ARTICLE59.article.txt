# On Tonight's Christening
## 
### 
TONIGHT at 7 the Stanford Radio Workshop
christens its student-built studio here on the
campus with the first of six programs to be
broadcast over KQW.
Years of work are behind this move which

is the grand finale or possibly just the begin
ning of a series of programs which will help
further good will for the University.
To Bud Cady, who is directing the show, and
to all the others who have put a lot of time and
effort into this work, congratulations and good
luck! John Horrall
