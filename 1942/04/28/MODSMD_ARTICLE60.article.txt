### AMIE REICHERT 
T'ODAY I would like to write a short piece about
the Daughters of the American Revolution and
their friend, Mr. Martin Dies. I think it is right cosy
the way these two have found one another. Why
shouldn't the Dies Committee and the D.A.R., two of
the most pernicious and decadent institutions in Amer
ican civic and political life, become allies? Let them
go down together.
These two organizations have much in common.
They carry a torch which they call Americanism and
the suppression of subversive activities or something
high-sounding like that, and in the name of these
ideals they commit the most odious crimes of red
baiting and race-discrimination.
Mr. Dies, intent upon tracking down and scourging
the "subversive elements" in the U.S., has been so
busy with the Communists and the people whom he
says are Communists that to date I don't think he has
snagged a single Bundist. He never got around to in
vestigating the Magnesium Development Covporation
or Alcoa's affiliation with Krupp or Standard Oil's
dealing with I. G. Farben. No, he was too busy trying
to prove that the whole nation was rapidly turning
six different shades of red. Mr. Dies has been so busy
and so worried about Internationa' Communism that
he didn't notice that Russia was our ally and Germany
our enemy.
He continued to smear charges of Communist af
filiation on everyone in Who's Who and the telephone
directory, and he forgot about the men who traded
with the enemy, made economic deals with him, sold
him trade secrets. Mr. Dies only cares about the
Comintern and he figures that the panacea for all our
ills is simply to prove that everyone we don't like has
been affiliated with it, and that will settle everything.

IVOW the D.A.R, comes into the picture because last
week Mrs. William H. Pouch, President Pouch, that
is, outlined plans for the forthcoming D.A.R. conven
tion in Chicago. These are to attack Clarence Streit's
Union Now; to attack foreign-language schools; and
to praise "that great American, Martin Dies."
This is really a constructive, far-sighted policy, is
it not? This is the sort of program one might expect
from the ladies who several years ago refused the
rent of their hall for a Marian Anderson concert, be
cause the singer is a negro. In short, this is the sort
of program which one expects of the D.A.R.—the
D.A.R. of the radio gags and the movie gags and the
New Yorker cartoons. I never realized until now that
the radio and the movies and the New Yorker haven't
been fooling all these years.
It is obvious from the outline of the program for
the convention that the D.A.R. proposes something
new for the nation—something as new and as con
structive as isolationism and red-baiting. Whether the
objections to Union Now are specifically for that plan
or for any sort of international co-operation is not
indicated, but it appears from the second item (oppos
ing foreign-language schools) that the ladies want to
get themselves so completely isolated that even if
they do hear any internationalist talk, they won't be
able to understand it.
