### MIKE CHURCHILL 
DEADLIER THAN THE GUNN
I N THE past, when asked if a certain book was
good or bad I could usually assume a studious
expression, quickly recall its reviews, and then give
an opinion.
I have just read a book where this is not possible,
and will probably end up out with my neck stuck.
I am, of course, referring to the just-published "Dead
lier Than the Male," by James Gunn.
Gunn is an undergraduate here at Stanford and a
Kappa Alpha. I have yet to meet him but from all
my scout reports, despite the fact that he has "written
a book," it doesn't show at all and he is perfectly
human.
I have always thought that when I reached 45
and my endowment policy paid off I would get a
lonely cabin, a shaggy tweed suit, a pipe, and then
write my novel. Gunn has defied the sacred tradi
tion of novel writers and turned out a very enjoyable
book as an undergraduate, wearing jeans, living in
the K.A. house.
* * $ *
J DIVIDED Gunn's book vaguely into two parts. It
is something like a convoy. For the first half he
gathers his characters and lays a background as at an
assembly port. Then his work moves out to sea with
increased action and interest, and is the better for it.
His turn of phrase, his similes, are very clever in
the early pages, but descriptive and down to earth as
they are, his dialogue and conflict does not reach a
level plane of naturalness until the book is well under
way.
In the first half you have some candidly amusing
expressions and descriptions to entertain you, in the
latter part there is splendid action, a couple of fights,
a murder or two, blackmail, all you could ask for,
expertly woven together with conflict and climax.
A peculiar thing about "Deadlier Than the Male"
and well handled is the subordination of the male
characters to the female. While it is a male who does
the killings, the girls carry the story. They carry it
in a sturdy, not-too-feminine way.
It is not a murder mystery, despite the killings.
It is a brisk interesting story about three women in
particular, one a jaded boarding house keeper past
her prime, intent on finding the murderer of her neigh
bor and best friend, another who had a terrible time
adjusting her natural tendencies to her desires for
economic security, and the third who marries, and
supports, the book's nearest approach to a villain.

J DIVIDED Gunn's book vaguely into two parts. It
is something like a convoy. For the first half he
gathers his characters and lays a background as at an
assembly port. Then his work moves out to sea with
increased action and interest, and is the better for it.
His turn of phrase, his similes, are very clever in
the early pages, but descriptive and down to earth as
they are, his dialogue and conflict does not reach a
level plane of naturalness until the book is well under
way.
In the first half you have some candidly amusing
expressions and descriptions to entertain you, in the
latter part there is splendid action, a couple of fights,
a murder or two, blackmail, all you could ask for,
expertly woven together with conflict and climax.
A peculiar thing about "Deadlier Than the Male"
and well handled is the subordination of the male
characters to the female. While it is a male who does
the killings, the girls carry the story. They carry it
in a sturdy, not-too-feminine way.
It is not a murder mystery, despite the killings.
It is a brisk interesting story about three women in
particular, one a jaded boarding house keeper past
her prime, intent on finding the murderer of her neigh
bor and best friend, another who had a terrible time
adjusting her natural tendencies to her desires for
economic security, and the third who marries, and
supports, the book's nearest approach to a villain.
DEADLIER THAN THE GUNN
I N THE past, when asked if a certain book was
good or bad I could usually assume a studious
expression, quickly recall its reviews, and then give
an opinion.
I have just read a book where this is not possible,
and will probably end up out with my neck stuck.
I am, of course, referring to the just-published "Dead
lier Than the Male," by James Gunn.
Gunn is an undergraduate here at Stanford and a
Kappa Alpha. I have yet to meet him but from all
my scout reports, despite the fact that he has "written
a book," it doesn't show at all and he is perfectly
human.
I have always thought that when I reached 45
and my endowment policy paid off I would get a
lonely cabin, a shaggy tweed suit, a pipe, and then
write my novel. Gunn has defied the sacred tradi
tion of novel writers and turned out a very enjoyable
book as an undergraduate, wearing jeans, living in
the K.A. house.
