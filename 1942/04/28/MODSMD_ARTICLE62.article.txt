## THANKS FROM MESSINA 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
I should like to take this opportunity to express
my sincere thanks to the Stanford Student Body for
making the Convalescent Home Drive a huge success
this year.
Despite prevailing war conditions, Stanford rallied
to this worthy cause, showed abundant enthusiasm,
and unlimited support. Eighty boys and girls, "Stan
ford's Children," appreciate the energy and time you
have offered and the kind generosity you have dis
played.
May I especially thank the workers and co
workers for their splendid organization and efficiency
and The Stanford Daily for its co-operation in pub
licityâ€”all of which accounted for the Drive's success!
Joe Messina, Chairman
