# Composer Talks To Opera Class
## Douglas Moore Sees College Opera Field 
### 
"There is a destiny ahead for
American dramatic music," Douglas
Moore, composer of "The Devil and
Daniel Webster," said yesterday to a
Stanford audience. "American com
posers have been brought up in the
symphonic tradition, when a more
natural bent would be in the field
of opera," he said. "I doubt if there
will ever be any great symphonies
which are non-German."
The best chance for American
opera, Mr. Moore concluded, is in
the educational systems, which can
form a league and produce operas
commissioned for college produc
tion.
'MET' IS OLD FASHIONED
Modern opera will not come out of
the Metropolitan Opera House, in
Mr, Moore's opinion, because "the
attitude at the Met is very intoler
ant of new ideas."
American composers must recog
nize certain principles if American
opera is to succeed, he said. They
must realize that opera is enter
tainment and not purely culture.
They must incorporate modern de
velopments in stagecraft and in their
libretti.

If the American language were
set with a proper sense of its ac
cents, Mr. Moore asserted, a new
mode for opera would be devel
oped. Our popular music is synco
pated because our language is syn
copated, he went on to say.
How successfully Mr. Moore han
dles these principles will be ascer
tained Friday, when his opera, "The
Devil and Daniel Webster" will be
performed in the Veterans Audito
rium in San Francisco.
