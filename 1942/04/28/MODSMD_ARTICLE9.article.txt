# Farm Presents Radio Program From Local Studio Tonight, 7
## Bob Rockwell to Take Male Lead In First Show, Mr. Smith' 
### 
A student-built studio, located on the Stanford campus, will be the
scene tonight at 7 o'clock of the first of six radio programs presented by
the Stanford Radio Workshop over KQW.
The program consists of a Ram's Head prize-winning comedy, "Meet
Mr. Smith," written by Bud Cad.v and adapted for radio by Carlton Cross.

Bob Rockwell, Jeanne Smith, John
High, Bob Libott, Allan Armer, Don
Shannon, and Georgia Haviland will
take part in the play.
ROCKWELL LEADS
Rockwell, the male lead, will be
right at home in a comedy. For years
he read funny papers to the kiddies
on Sunday mornings for NBC as
Uncle Bobby.
The new Stanford studio, built by
the Department of Speech and
Drama, is a student studio in the
real sense of the word. Last quarter,
when construction was begun, mem
bers of the Radio Workshop class
carried by hand two tons of tile
from the sidewalk in back of the
theater into the room.
"I think this demonstrates as
nothing else could the students' tre
mendous interest in radio," Cady,
director of the programs, said yes
terday.
LOCAL STUDIO SUPERIOR
The same amount of sound-proof
ing exists between the control room
and the studio as in the new San
Francisco NBC studios. The local
studio is far superior to the one in
the Hoover Library from where the
Wealth of the Nations series origi
nated a year ago, according to Cady.
"The set-up is unusual in that
students do not. leave the campus for
the broadcast — a broadcast loop
connects us directly with KQW," he
added. "This advantage means that

a„wide variety of Stanford programs
may, before long, be broadcast from
here."
Specially-built jogged walls pre
vent the reverberation of sound
within the studio.
"However," Cady said, "the studio
is so "live" that students have to
hide behind a blackboard in the cor
ner to accomplish a fadeout."
The design of the studio was the
joint work of James Walters, Skip
with Athey, and Cady, with Art
Hansen acting in an advisory ca
pacity.
The introductory fanfare of
"Come Join the Band" will open
and close the program.
