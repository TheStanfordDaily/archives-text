► L ast year, on 39 different college campuses, men were asked for can
did opinions about clothing styles. This poll, conducted by The Saturday
Evening Post, is being repeated this year for more than reasons of fash
ion. It should have important usefulness in the national conservation of
cloth and other materials.
Manufacturers and retailers want to know exactly what kind of
clothing college men like best —what they find most practical. Govern
ment, regulations about clothing make it vital to get such facts in advance.
Maybe you were one of the 4,179 college men who helped provide
the information last year. Maybe you also saw the Post Portfolio of' Col
lege Styles in your favorite store when you bought clothes last fall. It
made buying simpler for a good many men.
The 2nd Annual Post Poll of College Styles will be made very soon
through cooperation of the STANFORD DAILY.
Results will again be available to you in leading stores this fall. When
your local reporter asks you for information, your answers will be
appreciated.

FOR 1942-43
