# Stanfordites To Observe Car-less Day
## Move to Co-operate On Paly Rides to Aid Tire Economy Drive 
### 
New patriotism and traditional
Stanford spirit will combine today
when the campus walks to class to
â€¢ save rubber and gas. The first
"Cai-less Wednesday" on the Farm,
il will be repeated regularly on
campus.
Empty parking lots and crowded
sidewalks are what the Stanford
War Activities Board hopes to see
today. The advantages of "Car-less
Wednesday" pointed out by the cam
pus consumer committee include the
conservation of gas and rubber, re
duction of wear and tear on the car
and increased sociability.
The committee quoted from the
speech Riven yesterday by Profes
sor Theodore Kreps, who said, "Too
many students operate on the theory
that il they aren't going to have their
cars eventually anyway they might
as well use them like mad until
they're complete wrecks. That is
the action of a good follower of Hit
ler, for he is destroying part of the
capital of the United States."
Meanwhile, another means of con
serving rubber and gas is being put
into effect by the consumer com
mittee under Dodie Crile and
George Hellyer. A campaign to in
crease co-operative driving will
soon get under way in living groups
where students will be urged to
combine on rides to Palo Alto or
nearby places.
Within a few weeks, lists will be
posted in the Cellar for people to
sign if they are seeking rides to San
Jose or San Francisco or can give
them. It is hoped that unnecessary
duplication of trips can be elimi
nated this way.
