# Excom Says 'No' to Rugby Recognition
## Council to Circulate 'Public Opinion Poll' On Farm's Honor Code 
### HAP EVERETT 
Ex Committee last night voted
down the proposal to make rugby
a major sport, 7 to 2. The two-hour !
battle was the longest discussion of ;
the year.
Larry Dee and Chuck Taylor, rep- j
resenting the Board of Athletic J
Control, led the opposition to the
move. George JedenofT and Ted •
Cole presented the ease for rugby
and were supported by Till" Denton i
and Dick Driscoll of the committee.
Harry Maloney outlined the his
tory of the sport although he made j
it clear to the committee that the
proposal was entirely a student j
matter.
DEE AM) TAYLOR OPPOSE
Dee and Taylor summed up the
opposition with statements of the
current athletic policy at Stanford
and in the nation at large. Dee re
vealed that the Board of Athletic :
Control, in a meeting some weeks |
ago, had voted southern trips for j
tennis, track, golf, swimming, and J
baseball by only a 5-4 margin.
"Stanford would look silly adding
a sport at this time," he said, "when
the policy of all colleges is to cut !
down."
HAM METIS FIN DINGS
Ray Hammett, junior man on the J
committee, opposed the measure and j
presented findings of a quick sur- ;
vey of the situation.
Dropping a minor bombshell into
the meeting, Bob Morton asked Dee |
and Hammett if they were speaking j
for A1 Masters. Both opponents of j
the proposal said they were giving j
their own opinions, although Dee j
added that he considered his opin- j
ion to be that of the board.
After the measure was defeated, j
Driscoll proposed some recognition J
for JedenofT, Cole, and other leaders j
of rugby who will leave school this j
year. Both men refused the con- !
sideration.
"We fought for something we think !
is right," JedenofT said, "and if we !
lost, we lost, and we don't want any I
consolation."
DRISCOLL APPOINTED
Driscoll was appointed to look
into the matter further. Other busi
ness follows:

DEE AM) TAYLOR OPPOSE
Dee and Taylor summed up the
opposition with statements of the
current athletic policy at Stanford
and in the nation at large. Dee re
vealed that the Board of Athletic :
Control, in a meeting some weeks |
ago, had voted southern trips for j
tennis, track, golf, swimming, and J
baseball by only a 5-4 margin.

a sport at this time," he said, "when
the policy of all colleges is to cut !
down."
HAM METIS FIN DINGS
Ray Hammett, junior man on the J
committee, opposed the measure and j
presented findings of a quick sur- ;
vey of the situation.
Dropping a minor bombshell into
the meeting, Bob Morton asked Dee |
and Hammett if they were speaking j
for A1 Masters. Both opponents of j
the proposal said they were giving j
their own opinions, although Dee j
added that he considered his opin- j
ion to be that of the board.
After the measure was defeated, j
Driscoll proposed some recognition J
for JedenofT, Cole, and other leaders j
of rugby who will leave school this j
year. Both men refused the con- !
sideration.
"We fought for something we think !
is right," JedenofT said, "and if we !
lost, we lost, and we don't want any I
consolation."
