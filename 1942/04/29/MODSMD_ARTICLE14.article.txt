# Class of '43 Signs Ernie Lewis For 'Southern' Junior Prom
## 
### 
Steamboat 'round the bend! Here comes the Show Boat!
Set to the theme of the Show Boat Shuffle, the Junior Class will pre
sent its annual Prom on Saturday night, May !), in the atmosphere of old
Mississippi paddle-wheelers passing cotton-laden levees.
Tickets for the Prom, featuring the music of Ernie Lewis, go on sale

today at the A.S.SU. offices for only
$2.20. Dance bids are limited, and
dance co-chairmen Amie Reichert
and Ray Hammett urge that the
tickets be purchased as soon as pos
sible so that no one will be dis
j appointed.
Lewis was signed last week after
| the dance committee had auditioned
a half dozen bands in the Bay Area.
Don Dillon, after securing Lewis'
signature, said, "Here is a band that
definitely has something to offer a
Stanford audience. He's a real find."
Lewis cancelled other obligations
so he could perform for the Prom.
He has a wide variety of specialty
numbers which will be presented
during the intermissions. One is the
"Cats and Jammers" quintet, with
Lewis himself cutting capers on the
keys. This group broke all attend
ance records for five straight weeks
at the San Francisco Hot Music
Society last year—and that includes
Count Basic's record.
"Due to the war and the anti-big
name-policy, we couldn't hire a big
name band, but Lewis is far supe
rior to anything in these parts," said
Hammett.
Lewis plans to play his smooth
arrangements of popular sweet mu
sic to refute the theory that a col
ored band is restricted to only blar
ing "gut-bucket." Stompy Jones is
widely known for his wailing tenor
sax, and some claim that he is to be
spoken of in the same breath as Ben
Webster of the Ellington crew.
Plans for the Junior Week were
outlined yesterday to the Junior
Council by President Don Dillon.

"Due to the war and the anti-big
name-policy, we couldn't hire a big
name band, but Lewis is far supe
rior to anything in these parts," said
Hammett.
Lewis plans to play his smooth
arrangements of popular sweet mu
sic to refute the theory that a col
ored band is restricted to only blar
ing "gut-bucket." Stompy Jones is
widely known for his wailing tenor
sax, and some claim that he is to be
spoken of in the same breath as Ben
Webster of the Ellington crew.
Plans for the Junior Week were
outlined yesterday to the Junior
Council by President Don Dillon.
Steamboat 'round the bend! Here comes the Show Boat!
Set to the theme of the Show Boat Shuffle, the Junior Class will pre
sent its annual Prom on Saturday night, May !), in the atmosphere of old
Mississippi paddle-wheelers passing cotton-laden levees.
Tickets for the Prom, featuring the music of Ernie Lewis, go on sale

today at the A.S.SU. offices for only
$2.20. Dance bids are limited, and
dance co-chairmen Amie Reichert
and Ray Hammett urge that the
tickets be purchased as soon as pos
sible so that no one will be dis
j appointed.
Lewis was signed last week after
| the dance committee had auditioned
a half dozen bands in the Bay Area.
Don Dillon, after securing Lewis'
signature, said, "Here is a band that
definitely has something to offer a
Stanford audience. He's a real find."
Lewis cancelled other obligations
so he could perform for the Prom.
He has a wide variety of specialty
numbers which will be presented
during the intermissions. One is the
"Cats and Jammers" quintet, with
Lewis himself cutting capers on the
keys. This group broke all attend
ance records for five straight weeks
at the San Francisco Hot Music
Society last year—and that includes
Count Basic's record.
