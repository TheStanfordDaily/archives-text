# FDR Appeals to Nation For Support of Drastic Anti-Inflation Program
## Henderson Acts On Program As President Talks 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 2K (UP).—
President Roosevelt, appealing for
national support for his drastic anti
inflation program, said tonight that
the price for civilization must he
paid "in hard work and sorrow and
blood" and added that "this price is
not too high."

He promised in a fireside chat,
which was broadcast throughout the
world, that he will use all the ex
ecutive power at his command to
carry out the seven-point anti-in
flation and war economy policy
which he submitted to Congress
Monday and which he restated to
night as necessary to avert economic
disaster.

The program—-formally launched
earlier tonight when the government
issued a general price and rent freez
ing order—calls for overall price fix
ing, stabilization of wages, a $25,000
limitation on individual net incomes,
near - confiscatory excess profits
taxes, rationing of scarce commodi
ties, parity price ceilings for farm
products, increased voluntary sav
ings, and further restrictions on in
stallment buying.

Two phases—the ceiling on indi
vidual earnings and farm parity
prices—are under intense congres
sional fire and the President struck
sharply at this opposition.

He made a direct appeal over the
heads of the representatives to.spe
cial groups—the farmers, laborers
and businessmen—to co-operate in
the supreme economic effort. And
he pledged that (he Allied war effort
will not be impeded by the "faint of
heart," by "bogus patriots" and by
a handful of "noisy traitors."

The President cited the plight of
the people in lands conquered by
Axis powers in defense of his con
tention that "the price for civiliza
tion ... is not too high."
