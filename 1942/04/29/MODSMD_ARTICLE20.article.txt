"Chance and random factors, es
pecially weather, must be consid
ered in planning regulation or 'con
trol' of agricultural production and
exports," said Dr. V. M. Timoshenko,
economist with the Food Research
Institute of Stanford University in
his study, "Variability in Wheat
Yields and Outputs."
The study was published this week
by the Stanford Food Research In
stitute as the April issue of Wheat
Studies, and is the first to appear
under a special grant made to the
Institute by the Rockefeller Foun
dation.
"Comparison between wheat yield
cycles and business cycles reveals
various similarities and many differ
ences," says Dr. Timoshenko.
"First, the average durations of
cycles in wheat yields differ signifi
cantly from the average duration of
business cycles, with one exception:
cycles in wheat yields in North
American regions (3.7 years) have
nearly the same average duration as
business cycles in the United States
(about 4.0 years)."
