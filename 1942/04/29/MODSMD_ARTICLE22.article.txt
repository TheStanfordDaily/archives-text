# GUNN'S MOODS BEAR FRUIT
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Tlu* 1 mist's raged rampant on (lie
Kappa Alpha sun porch during
spring vacation a year ago.
Oil one side of the porch sat Jim
Gu.nn,- a portable typewriter an
chored firmly between his feet,
grinding out the last five chapters
of his book, "Deadlier Than the
Male," just released last Thursday.
On the other side were A1 Zelver
arid Harry Muheim, deep in the
process of turning out this year's
spring show, "A Sale of Two Cities."

Author Jim Gunn will auto
graph copies of "Deadlier Than the
Male" in the bookstore from .'I to
5 p.m. tomorrow.

The show was not finished until this
winter, incidentally.
"All you could hear," Muheim said
in a recent interview, "was the click
of typewriters, and the chirping of
the birds, broken occasionally by
brief snarls of creative anguish."
According to Muheim, Gunn had a
"game attitude throughout, which is
more than 1 can say for Zelver and
myself."
Author Gunn said yesterday that i
the book was begun in the spring of j
'40 in a directed writing course giv
en by James Cunningham, instruc- !
tor in English, but that the thing |
hung fire, "what with one thing and !
another," until the following spring
when it became evident that Mr.
Cunningham was not going to wait j
much longer.
• "I got the publisher's letter ac
cepting the book on the day Roose

velt declared war," ho said reflec
tively. "I do not think this is sig
nificant."
In regard to the chapter process
oi writing the book, Muheim said
that Gunn was subject to something
called the "blue Chapter 8 mood."
He recalled a conversation he had
with a Kappa Alpha alumnus who
returned for lunch one day.

"Who," said the grad, indicating I
| Gunn, "is that guy I sat next to? He
J didn't say a word, but ho damn' near
ate my arm when I reached for the
I butter."
Muheim has the following opin- '
ion of "Deadlic r Than the Male":
"The book is one which you will |
not easily confuse with Santayana's
I 'The Last Puritan,' but it's good."

"All you could hear," Muheim said
in a recent interview, "was the click
of typewriters, and the chirping of
the birds, broken occasionally by
brief snarls of creative anguish."
According to Muheim, Gunn had a
"game attitude throughout, which is
more than 1 can say for Zelver and
myself."
Author Gunn said yesterday that i
the book was begun in the spring of j
'40 in a directed writing course giv
en by James Cunningham, instruc- !
tor in English, but that the thing |
hung fire, "what with one thing and !
another," until the following spring
when it became evident that Mr.
Cunningham was not going to wait j
much longer.
• "I got the publisher's letter ac
cepting the book on the day Roose

velt declared war," ho said reflec
tively. "I do not think this is sig
nificant."
In regard to the chapter process
oi writing the book, Muheim said
that Gunn was subject to something
called the "blue Chapter 8 mood."
He recalled a conversation he had
with a Kappa Alpha alumnus who
returned for lunch one day.

"Who," said the grad, indicating I
| Gunn, "is that guy I sat next to? He
J didn't say a word, but ho damn' near
ate my arm when I reached for the
I butter."
Muheim has the following opin- '
ion of "Deadlic r Than the Male":
"The book is one which you will |
not easily confuse with Santayana's
I 'The Last Puritan,' but it's good."
