# Japs By-Pass Mandalay, Sweep 93 Miles in New Burma Drive
## Lashio, Vital Burma Road Junction, Endangered by Strong Enemy Attack 
### 
C HUNGKING, April 28 (UP). —Japanese mechanized forces, in a light
ning 93-mile sweep around the eastern end of the Allied Burma line, have
penetrated to within 67 miles ef the vital Burma Road terminus at Lashio
and have by-passed Mandalay, a Chinese communique announced today.
The communique placed Japanese spearheads near Konghaipinc, 93

miles north of the road junction of'
Taunggyi, which the Chinese had
recaptured and still held, and at
Mongsung, 46 miles east of Kong
haiping. This latter column was
closest to Lashio, 67 miles to the
northeast.
SKIRT CHINESE LINES
Another Japanese column, which
had struck from Thailand into the
Burma Shan states, was reported to
have reached Kunhing, 75 miles east
of Loilem, where earlier reports
from British headquarters in New
Delhi said the Japanese had skirted
the Chinese line and advanced 50
miles. The column at Kunhing
threatened to box in the Chinese
forces on the Burma-Thailand bor
der, "thereby facilitating the attack
toward Lashio," the communique
said.
The Japanese now were well
northeast of Mandalay. and appar
ently would drive on that bombed
out provisional capital later while
they smashed on toward Lashio or
the Mandalay-Lashio railroad south
west of the Burma Road junction.
Their new gains put them only 35
miles south of the railway town of
Hsipaw.
CHINESE RESIST STUBBORNLY
The Chinese were reported resist
ing stubbornly along the entire
Shan States front in fierce fighting
that cost both sides heavily in cas
ualties. Unless the Chinese can pre
vent the invaders from expanding
their spearheads "the battle for
Lashio may be fought before the
battle for Mandalay," a spokesman
said.
The swift Japanese drive into
northern Burma, paced by tanks and
covered by war planes, appeared to
have been accomplished in less than
two days and it marked a grave turn
in the fortunes of U.S. Gen. Joseph
W. Stilwell's Chinese troops. They
had retaken Taunggyi and seven
miles of surrounding area.

two days and it marked a grave turn
in the fortunes of U.S. Gen. Joseph
W. Stilwell's Chinese troops. They
had retaken Taunggyi and seven
miles of surrounding area.
C HUNGKING, April 28 (UP). —Japanese mechanized forces, in a light
ning 93-mile sweep around the eastern end of the Allied Burma line, have
penetrated to within 67 miles ef the vital Burma Road terminus at Lashio
and have by-passed Mandalay, a Chinese communique announced today.
The communique placed Japanese spearheads near Konghaipinc, 93

miles north of the road junction of'
Taunggyi, which the Chinese had
recaptured and still held, and at
Mongsung, 46 miles east of Kong
haiping. This latter column was
closest to Lashio, 67 miles to the
northeast.
SKIRT CHINESE LINES
Another Japanese column, which
had struck from Thailand into the
Burma Shan states, was reported to
have reached Kunhing, 75 miles east
of Loilem, where earlier reports
from British headquarters in New
Delhi said the Japanese had skirted
the Chinese line and advanced 50
miles. The column at Kunhing
threatened to box in the Chinese
forces on the Burma-Thailand bor
der, "thereby facilitating the attack
toward Lashio," the communique
said.
The Japanese now were well
northeast of Mandalay. and appar
ently would drive on that bombed
out provisional capital later while
they smashed on toward Lashio or
the Mandalay-Lashio railroad south
west of the Burma Road junction.
Their new gains put them only 35
miles south of the railway town of
Hsipaw.
CHINESE RESIST STUBBORNLY
The Chinese were reported resist
ing stubbornly along the entire
Shan States front in fierce fighting
that cost both sides heavily in cas
ualties. Unless the Chinese can pre
vent the invaders from expanding
their spearheads "the battle for
Lashio may be fought before the
battle for Mandalay," a spokesman
said.
The swift Japanese drive into
northern Burma, paced by tanks and
covered by war planes, appeared to
have been accomplished in less than
two days and it marked a grave turn
in the fortunes of U.S. Gen. Joseph
W. Stilwell's Chinese troops. They
