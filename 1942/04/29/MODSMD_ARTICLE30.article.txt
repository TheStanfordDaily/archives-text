# Blackout Cards Issued to Drivers
## 
### 
Palo Alto is meeting the need for
! standard lighting equipment dur
ing blackouts by issuing "E" ex
i empt cards to drivers who are en
titled to them by city ordinance. This
I arrangement is a temporary provi
â–  sion to be effective until the state
'or army authorities provide ade
quate regulations.
The Palo Alto action requires that
vehicles which have to move during
blackouts must have a separate cir
cuit for blackout lights. These lights
should be hooded so that the rays
| cannot go more than 12 degrees
above horizontal.
