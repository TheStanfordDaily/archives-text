# Broncs Wallop Card Nine; Teams Will Meet Again Saturday at Season's End
## 
### 
Sitiiin Clara took a (i-1 game from the Stanford nine yesterday on the
ISrone diamond wlion the Indian batters failed to come through in the
clinches on several <li lie rent occasions.
Card i::il Wilson pitched steady hall ii|) to the sixth inning when Santa i
Clara nicked him for one mil. tying the score. From then on it was all

hi unc, with the hosts pushing across
throe digits in the seventh and two
in the eighth.
CARDS LOAD BASES
Stanford had its big chance in the
seventh but '"Ace" Smith forced
Harry Parsons into a double play
with the bases loaded to end the
scare.
Each team collected eight hits dur
ing the game. The difference lay in
the fact that the Card infield, both
ered by a stiff wind, booted several
important, chances. The Santa Clara
.scores in the late innings were more
;i result of double steals and errors
than they were of potent Bronco
hitting.
WALKCP TRIPLES
Wilson had good control all the
way and walked only one man be
sides singling in Stanford's lone run.
This hit, following Walkup's three
bagger the day's only extra base
hit was one of the few instances
when the Farm players hit in the
clinch.
Twice the Cards had the bases
loaded, and they even had two men
on in the ninth, but they were un
able to come through. The Broncs,
though bail led by Wilson's curve,
which limited all their hits to in
field dribbles, managed to bunch
their hits and the one walk into
two big innings, while "Ace" Smith
was making the harder hitting In
dians scatter their wallops over the
whole nine frames.
MEET BRONCS AGAIN
"It was a much closer game than
the score indicates," according to
Farm Coach Harry Wolter. "It was
a tough one to lose," he added.
Saturday the Cards and Broncs
meet again, this time on the Stan
lord sunken diamond. Coach Wol
ter. using pitcher Dyck instead of
Wilson for this game, hopes that his
number one hurler's steadiness will
keep the visitors from bunching
their hits. Wolter's team, however,
will be in for a tougher time in
the hit department themselves, for
the Broncs' star pitcher. Pillette, will
be heaving them at the Cards.
TROJANS AHEAD
Though the conference title is
pretty much the property of Cal and
SC.. the third place Broncs will be
fighting to keep clean the spotless
record they have maintained so far
this season against the hapless
cellarite Redskins.

This hit, following Walkup's three
bagger the day's only extra base
hit was one of the few instances
when the Farm players hit in the
clinch.
Twice the Cards had the bases
loaded, and they even had two men
on in the ninth, but they were un
able to come through. The Broncs,
though bail led by Wilson's curve,
which limited all their hits to in
field dribbles, managed to bunch
their hits and the one walk into
two big innings, while "Ace" Smith
was making the harder hitting In
dians scatter their wallops over the
whole nine frames.
MEET BRONCS AGAIN
"It was a much closer game than
the score indicates," according to
Farm Coach Harry Wolter. "It was
a tough one to lose," he added.
Saturday the Cards and Broncs
meet again, this time on the Stan
lord sunken diamond. Coach Wol
ter. using pitcher Dyck instead of
Wilson for this game, hopes that his
number one hurler's steadiness will
keep the visitors from bunching
their hits. Wolter's team, however,
will be in for a tougher time in
the hit department themselves, for
the Broncs' star pitcher. Pillette, will
be heaving them at the Cards.
TROJANS AHEAD
Though the conference title is
pretty much the property of Cal and
SC.. the third place Broncs will be
fighting to keep clean the spotless
record they have maintained so far
this season against the hapless
cellarite Redskins.
Sitiiin Clara took a (i-1 game from the Stanford nine yesterday on the
ISrone diamond wlion the Indian batters failed to come through in the
clinches on several <li lie rent occasions.
Card i::il Wilson pitched steady hall ii|) to the sixth inning when Santa i
Clara nicked him for one mil. tying the score. From then on it was all

hi unc, with the hosts pushing across
throe digits in the seventh and two
in the eighth.
CARDS LOAD BASES
Stanford had its big chance in the
seventh but '"Ace" Smith forced
Harry Parsons into a double play
with the bases loaded to end the
scare.
Each team collected eight hits dur
ing the game. The difference lay in
the fact that the Card infield, both
ered by a stiff wind, booted several
important, chances. The Santa Clara
.scores in the late innings were more
;i result of double steals and errors
than they were of potent Bronco
hitting.
WALKCP TRIPLES
Wilson had good control all the
way and walked only one man be
sides singling in Stanford's lone run.
