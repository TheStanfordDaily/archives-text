# Dekes Lash Delta Chi; ATO Falls to Breakers
## 
### 
The Dekes. l>ehind the seven-hit pitching of Jim Pollard, lashed out a
12-2 w in over the Delta Chis in the feature game of yesterday afternoon's
intramural softhall play.
She.'m Selix let the A.T.O.'s down with the same number of runs
while his Breaker teammates scored a dozen counters behind him.

The Sigma Nus edged out
I A.K.L. ten by an 8-7 score. Errors
I by both sides made the game sloppy
\ throughout. In a similar game the
j El Toro team slugged out an 11-7
victory over the Chi Psi lodge. En
j cina 2W won by forfeit from En
| cina Basement.
Although the Dekes lost their first
| game, their showing yesterday
| stamps them as one of the teams to
I watch. Their lineup was studded
j with basketball aces. Don Burness
I guarded the initial sack, while Tom
i Fuller played the hot corner. Pol
[ lard, with Athertonized Gridder
j Bill Joslyn as a batterymate, kept
j the Delta Chi hits well scattered and
was in no trouble at any time in
i the game.
This afternoon's schedule is as
follows:

Alpha Delta Psi vs. El Campo.
Field 1. 4 p.m.
Beta Theta Pi \s. Stanford Daily,
Field 2, 4 p.m.
Theta Delta Chi vs. MI Capitan.
Field :5. 4 p.m.
Theta Chi vs. Sigma Alpha Fpsi
lon. Field 1. 5 p.m.
Kappa Sig II vs. Phi Sigma Kappa.
Field 2. 5 p.m.
Alpha Sigma Phi vs. Phi Delta
Theta. Field !>, 5 p.m.
The afternoon's outstanding game
: from the standpoint of the brand of
ball displayed will probably be the
Beta-Daily fracas. The latter will
i uncover its new pitching sensation,
George Kauffman. who is one of the
new journalists of outstanding merit
on the paper and a good pitcher.
