### H.D. THOREAU 
tXDR all devotees of high class soft
ball, let this hereby be an an
nouncement. or should it be a warn
ing, that the Stanford Daily softball
ten will make its second league
showing tomorrow afternoon on the
local intramural fields.
The outfit so unlucky as to have
to tangle with tlr >,e potential ma
jor leaguers is called the Beta
Theta Erat Club. Erom all re
pot ts they too Ixtast a top-notch
club, but are destined to fall easy
prey to the gentlemen from the
fourth estate.
It any readers are so skeptical as
to chick the records on the Daily's
first game, I might mention that a
si lies of Heaven- ent disasters were
the sole reason for their 12-0 edging
out by the Alpha Delts.
Allln ugh Associate Editor John
lierral pitched nearly invincible
ball in our first out. allowing onl\
one home run in seven innings,
(Jeorge KaulVman, new reporter of
the stalT. will probably take the
mound in tomorrow's game. This
is partly due to Hie added re
sponsibilities John has taken on
recently.
The Dippy keystone combine of
Harold Shafer and Hulbert Everett
played such tight ball around the
second sack that the roving short,
the tenth man in softball who roams
around behind second, handled only
four chances all afternoon. This un
heralded -sensation, although he ap
peared to be the most polished man
on the field, polished off only one of
the four chances.
Only the fact that the opposition
never got men on first and second
with none out, kept the Bulge-to-
Ilap-to-Shaf-to-Sahy infield com
bination from scoring innumerable
triple plays.
Fortunately only student body
cards will be necessary to get a view
of this outfit in action before they

move up to a faster class of ball.
Come early, however, because the
SRO sign will go out early. Bring
your own seat if you like (o sit
down. While you're at it bring one
for a friend, too.

first game, I might mention that a

out by the Alpha Delts.

the stalT. will probably take the
mound in tomorrow's game. This
is partly due to Hie added re
sponsibilities John has taken on
recently.
The Dippy keystone combine of
Harold Shafer and Hulbert Everett
played such tight ball around the
second sack that the roving short,
the tenth man in softball who roams
around behind second, handled only
four chances all afternoon. This un
heralded -sensation, although he ap
peared to be the most polished man
on the field, polished off only one of
the four chances.
Only the fact that the opposition
never got men on first and second
with none out, kept the Bulge-to-
Ilap-to-Shaf-to-Sahy infield com
bination from scoring innumerable
triple plays.
Fortunately only student body
cards will be necessary to get a view
of this outfit in action before they

move up to a faster class of ball.
Come early, however, because the
SRO sign will go out early. Bring
your own seat if you like (o sit
down. While you're at it bring one
for a friend, too.

ball, let this hereby be an an

ten will make its second league
showing tomorrow afternoon on the
local intramural fields.
