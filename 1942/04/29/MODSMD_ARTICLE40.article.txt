AS usual, President Roosevelt made a fine
speech yesterday.
However, President Roosevelt has been mak
ing fine speeches for some time now, but the
acts of his administration have often been woe
fully different from the fine pictures painted by
their leader.
Now that we are at war, and the Administra
tion is faced by a "national emergency" the ex
istence of which no sane person will dispute, it
is necessary that the legislation which the Ad
ministration-controlled Congress passes must be
as wise as the President's words.
In speaking of his seven-point program to
keep down the cost of living, Mr. Roosevelt
said, wisely and truthfully:
"The important thing to remember is that
each one of these points is dependent on the
other if the whole program is to work."
The Roosevelt administration has always
been a labor administration. It has been proud
of it.
On the other hand, Congress as often in the
past is being dominated by a powerful farm
bloc.
The temptation to give in to the farm and
labor segments in the government will be great
as Congress takes up the price and wage prob
lem; legislators with an eye cocked to next No
vember's elections would like nothing better
than to soothe these vote-rich segments by fa
voring them in the coming legislation.
The ability of the Administration to pass this
hurdle will be a good test of its competence in
leading the country during the war.—Vic Mina
