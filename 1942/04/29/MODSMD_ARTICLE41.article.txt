TODAY being car-less Wednesday, it be
hooves The Daily to mount righteously upon
its high horse and inform its readers of their
patriotic duty on this particular day.
We could publicize car-less Wednesday until
we were blue in the face and we could insist
editorially that you must leave the "hot-iron"
where it stands today, and walk to class.
We won't, though. We're going to fool you.
Because if you and you don't care, then we
don't care. The reason is that we are fighting
a popular war, which means that total war is
everybody's war.
So we're not going to beef at you and we're
not going to poke our finger in your eye. Don't
resent the fact that car-less Wednesday sounds
compulsory—naming one special day to save
automobile parts and tires seems to evidence
good organization for group contribution. While
it may be a gentle prod to the sophisticate and
to the one who says, "Let the other guy win the
war, why should I bother?" it happens to be a
convenient way to get you to stop driving your
car when otherwise you wouldn't get around
to it.
We publicly and even shamefully confess we
probably wouldn't, but car-less Wednesday
takes care of the "Do-it-tomorrow" philosophy,
and also forms some basis of self-respect be
cause without too much trouble we can rational
ize it into feeling it is a voluntary contribution.
