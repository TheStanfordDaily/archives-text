STOP washing the swallows out of the Quad!
The University, set on economy, is throw
ing money away by hiring hosemen from the
fire department to wash down the nests on the
Quad.
Now these swallows have gone to a lot of
time and expense to build these nests and they
form an integral part of the Franciscan archi
tecture here. Stanford is built along the lines
of California missions, famous as havens for
swallows. Besides, Stanford is a game preserve.
Not only are these nests washed down once.
The frustrated birds come back and rebuild
them and the whole thing starts all over again.
It is a waste of time and money; it is wrecking
one of the guaint and artistic features of our
distinctive architecture; it violates the game
preserve regulations; it is cruel.
Upon investigation we found no reason for
driving away the swallows, except one little
obvious one; and if the brothers at Capistrano
can stand it, we certainly can.
If the University is so set on cleaning some
thing up why don't they get rid of those dead
frogs just off Memorial Court?
Leave those swallows alone. Hap Everett
