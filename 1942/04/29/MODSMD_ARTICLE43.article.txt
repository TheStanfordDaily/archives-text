SEE, in democracy when the people are dis
satisfied, they change their leaders, but in dicta
torship when the people are dissatisfied, the leader
changes them—permanently. And this is one of the
fundamental differences between Herr Hitler's way
and our way. This is one of the reasons we are fight
ing.
They say today—in London, in Washington, in An
kara—that Der Fuehrer is getting ready for another
purge. They have been saying that ever since his
speech the other day which was a unique speech for
Adolf Hitler because it was a defeatist specch.
Also it was a unique speech because Herr Hitler
"asked" the German people to give him the right to
dispense with the services of anyone he disliked. He
"asked" carte blanche for murder.
That is a strange thing. When Hitler purged Rhoem
and the 70-odd other high Nazi officials in 1935 he
didn't ask anybody—except maybe his inner self. In
those days his position was a lot more queasy than it
is now, he was by no means firmly established, and it
would have been logical then perhaps to "ask" the
German people for this favor, at least for appearances'
sake.
Now Herr Hitler is asking favors of his people in
his own little way and this is a strange time. What
he is really doing, many people say, is striking the
first warning note of a great purge.
I wonder. Of course there is no reason why Hitler,
being Hitler, should not have a nice purge and out
with it. But there are a hundred reasons why a
purge at this time would be a most dangerous thing for
him to do.

r l' , o BE SURE, the German people are not ready for
revolt yet. Perhaps some day they will be, but
we can never count on that, and the fact is that they
are still a long way from lifting a finger against their
Nazi masters. The Terror is still all-powerful in Nazi
Germany.
Hitler wants this purge. He wants it for psycho
logical reasons mostly. He is suffering under a tre
mendous strain. And his people are suffering under a
tremendous strain —which they have been for some
time—but which is now beginning to tell because Der
Fuehrer has not brought them the victory he prom
ised for last year, or the great offensive he promised
for this spring.
Reports from Ankara—usually an excellent news
source—tell of the dangerous conditions in Germany
among civilians, soldiers,,and industrial "workers. The
reports speak of a general weariness among workers,
a shortage of manpower—in the factories and on the
battle fronts both—a lengthening casualty list which
has left virtually no German family unaffected, and
the growing fear of typhus.

r German people are becoming bitter under the
increased suffering and hardship and the failure
of Hitler's armies and the growing list of dead and
wounded and no respite from the awful eternity of
war. But they will not revolt yet.
Hitler feels that he must do something. He must
pretend to be doing something, to be organizing, to be
reconstructing, to be breaching the gaps.
He must make a big noise and look active because
now there are no victories to divert his people from
brooding on their terrible lot and on the utter empti
ness and failure of the "New Order."
Perhaps a purge will be the answer, but it will be
only a temporary answei*. The United Nations have
the real answer.
