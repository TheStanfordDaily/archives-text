### MIKE CHURCHILL 
IT'S CONSERVATION
FROM HERE ON IN
/ defense is on the march here at Stan-
J ford. Rows of Sylvia Berrys are at work organ
izing, preparing; gleaming bins bulge with sand at
strategic places in the University's buildings; people
are knitting, giving blood, learning first aid; hundreds
of Malla Macks are entertaining soldiers, feeding
them, dancing with them, making them happy.
Even The Daily is not immune, isolated little cul
tural isle that it is. Monday, a man appeared, and with
the grim determination of a Bataan defender, pro
ceeded to paint all the windows in the Shack an im
penetrable black.
Three claustrophobes and a night editor pleaded
for him to stop, with tears in their eyes and despera
tion in their throats (they had swallowed their gum
apparently), but he went on painting, painting every
window black. It was really frightfully grim.
Nothing could stop him. Protestations that this is
spring, that The Daily needs sunlight if anything does,
were to no avail. So here I sit as in a cavern, divorced
from the world of light, and spring, and reality. Curse
you, Hirohito!

r F , HE LATEST program for aiding the war effort to
be brought forth is that of Car-less Wednesdays,
which is not to be confused with Carlos Monday,
Breakers '37.
The idea, it would seem, is to refrain from driving
pars every Wednesday. Whether one is supposed to
refrain from wearing shoes with rubber soles the same
day has not been announced.
This is going to be rough on the Fijis. Already there
is some talk along the upper row about succeeding
from Stanford and joining Santa Clara. The argument
is that they can drive to San Jose quicker than they
can walk to the Quad.
I have what I think is a better suggestion. It is on a
sort of school bus basis. Each department would get
an adequate vehicle to transport their members and
this would go around in the morning and bring them
all in to the Quad.
The philosophy department would only need a sta
tion wagon, but the Econ Department might need a
Greyhound.
It would be interesting to see this bus arrive at the
English Corner of a morning. All the staff disgorging
from the door, merrily shouting and shoving, each with
his lunch clasped tightly in his hand, would be quite
a sight.

izing, preparing; gleaming bins bulge with sand at
strategic places in the University's buildings; people
are knitting, giving blood, learning first aid; hundreds
of Malla Macks are entertaining soldiers, feeding
them, dancing with them, making them happy.
Even The Daily is not immune, isolated little cul
tural isle that it is. Monday, a man appeared, and with
the grim determination of a Bataan defender, pro
ceeded to paint all the windows in the Shack an im
penetrable black.
Three claustrophobes and a night editor pleaded
for him to stop, with tears in their eyes and despera
tion in their throats (they had swallowed their gum
apparently), but he went on painting, painting every
window black. It was really frightfully grim.
Nothing could stop him. Protestations that this is
spring, that The Daily needs sunlight if anything does,
were to no avail. So here I sit as in a cavern, divorced
from the world of light, and spring, and reality. Curse
you, Hirohito!

r F , HE LATEST program for aiding the war effort to
be brought forth is that of Car-less Wednesdays,
which is not to be confused with Carlos Monday,
Breakers '37.
The idea, it would seem, is to refrain from driving
pars every Wednesday. Whether one is supposed to
refrain from wearing shoes with rubber soles the same
day has not been announced.
This is going to be rough on the Fijis. Already there
is some talk along the upper row about succeeding
from Stanford and joining Santa Clara. The argument
is that they can drive to San Jose quicker than they
can walk to the Quad.
I have what I think is a better suggestion. It is on a
sort of school bus basis. Each department would get
an adequate vehicle to transport their members and
this would go around in the morning and bring them
all in to the Quad.
The philosophy department would only need a sta
tion wagon, but the Econ Department might need a
Greyhound.
It would be interesting to see this bus arrive at the
English Corner of a morning. All the staff disgorging
from the door, merrily shouting and shoving, each with
his lunch clasped tightly in his hand, would be quite
a sight.
