## IS A TRAITOR A TRAITOR? 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
If Father Coughlin were suddenly able to estab
lish a fascist dictatorship in this country, we might
not be surprised that he was the head of such a
movement, but we would certainly call him a traitor.
Dick Turner may have been right when he said
that Quisling's and Laval's present actions are con
sistent with their past records. To say that neighbor
is a traitor because both have worked for a fascist
victory, however, certainly fails to discriminate be
tween the desire for personal aggrandizement on the
part of the two men and the national welfare of their
countries.
That their 'actions may have been consistently in
one direction does not hide the fact that Quisling and
Laval have sold out their countries.
